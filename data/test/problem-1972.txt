Harry gathers his scarf and his jacket and is about to step through the Floo when there’s a sudden angry flapping noise at the front door. Grimmauld Place is warded against unwanted mail—a hangover from the days when Harry’s admirers were a little too ardent—so he draws his wand carefully as he eyes the way the mail slot is starting to bulge and rattle. The noise starts to increase, and the tiny screws holding the metal surround of the mail slot pop free, as the flap folds back in on itself and an absolute torrent of envelopes and small packages begin to pour through the door.
“I can go without you,” Draco clarifies. “I just wouldn’t want you to think that I wasn’t doing everything I can to complete the job as quickly as possible. You know, that I was
He thinks Seymour secretly likes the wide-eyed way his students stare at Harry as if he’s just sprung from the pages of one their textbooks. The Seventh Years are bright and friendly, keen to show off what they’ve already learned to Harry, who puts them through their paces, pushing them now and again with harmless little hexes they haven’t come across in their studies. By the time they break for lunch, he feels run ragged and he wonders how Seymour keeps up with them all term.
The Arrows look shaken and seem to be steeling themselves for a lecture, but Malfoy just casts a spell to project the recording from his Omnioculars into the air. It’s Leila who addresses the team.
“I spoke to Nigel this morning,” she said, when she’d composed herself again. “He’s expecting you this weekend.”
Aiden North’s jaw falls open, and he stares at Harry as if looking for back-up. And it’s true that Harry had stopped him from doing that just yesterday, because it might be permitted by the rules but it still
Harry rounds on Malfoy, determined to give him a piece of his mind, but Malfoy literally holds his palm up to Harry’s face to silence him. “Save it, Potter,” he snaps. “I’m going to watch the game.”
“I think you’re doing a great job,” Harry assures the boy, pulling his thumb away before it becomes one with the pinecone.
Ron agrees. “I’ll get her and bring some sandwiches for lunch. I need a break from all this before my hand turns into a quill anyway. BLT for you?”
She gives him a strange look. “Well, whoever is behind it, they’re not going to succeed. You’re going to win the election, extend the Post-War Prohibitions, and if Malfoy is swanning around in breach of them you can throw him in prison with his father. It’s time to get things back on track.”
Harry waves a hand impatiently with a smile. “No, no. Of course not. The vault is yours, the house is yours. And, I mean, look at it!” The kitchen positively gleams in the late winter sun coming through the high windows to the garden. All of the bad memories of Harry’s past have been banished. “How did you get it like this? It’s a miracle.”
“You’re both welcome to stay if you wish,” he explains, “but there’s no need. This anchor is spelled to draw me out of the dream if any of my vitals exceed set ranges, or after an appointed time. There will be no need for you to intervene.”
carved in stone over the door. Harry has only been here a couple of times. Once for some flashy fundraiser when he was a player, and then occasionally over the years when Balham insisted on meeting here for a drink while they discussed the team’s performance. It has a musty, closed-in smell, and virtually no sunlight makes its way in through the tall, narrow windows. There’s a stuffed dragon head mounted above the fireplace in the library that makes Harry feel ill every time he sees it.
“I’ve been thinking about that little copper rune that was showing up in our trace diagnostics. At first I just assumed it was something standard that I’d overlooked but I’m very good at diagnostics so that didn’t really make sense.” Luna says this without a hint of bravado. She toys with her earring.
The bartender just rolls his eyes and smirks. “Oh hush, I know you’re keeping it secret at work. But god, we don’t usually pretend in here.” He pats Harry on the hand, and then mimes zipping his lips. “Your secret is safe with me. Your’s and the rest of central London’s.”
Hermione’s face is very red, even in the half-light. “Would you, though? Would you have come if I’d told you?”
“It’s heat,” Neville yells desperately, trying to sidestep another vine. “Sunlight. Fire. Anything you can think of in that vein. Cast
“Harry is a senior Auror, about to be the next Minister for Magic,” she says to him. “I think he can handle one former Death Eater for twenty-four hours, don’t you?”
Harry leans his hip against the edge of the desk, just a fraction too close to Malfoy to be entirely comfortable. Malfoy pushes his chair back to put more space between them.
“You’ve always told us that it’s all you want to do, even when you could do any number of things that paid better and offered you more prestige. Over and over again you’ve said that the game is the only thing that means anything to you, and I tried not to take offence, I really did, because it’s so patently true. You live in that old house by yourself. You don’t date. I can’t remember the last time you went on holiday. The club is basically your whole life.”
Luna nods, patting his knee with a smile. “I did. But once I realised it was you, I decided I didn’t need to write the story after all.”
“Look, you say it’s not a curse, and I trust your professional opinion,” Harry barrels on, despite Malfoy’s increasingly skeptical expression. “But ever since I said I was going to host Christmas at my house, the wheels have been falling off. And the only thing that seems to connect all these disasters is an advent calendar.”
. My sense of self-preservation is a lot more well-developed than that. You saw what sort of mood he was in.”
“You look very festive,” he manages. He suspects her earrings might be actual Christmas tree baubles. They cycle through a series of different coloured lights in a way that is already starting to give him a headache.
The bartender laughs, placing a scotch and soda on a napkin in front of him without him asking for it.
The sled glides to a halt in front of the stable, and Malfoy wriggles around behind him, clambering out.
As if on cue, an elf pops into the room, letting them know that Narcissa is ready to receive Hermione. She wraps Harry in a tight hug before she goes. “You’re wonderful too, you know,” he says, pressing a kiss into her tangled mass of hair. When she pulls away her eyes are shining, and then she’s gone.
Harry studies his profile. His bright blond hair falling softly across his face in the breeze. His stupidly patrician features. The long, lean lines of him — tall and strong and unbroken, even after everything.
“The inscription is supposed to glow when the person who gave it to you is thinking of you,” she said. “But my grandmother sat right beside me and it doesn’t work. Not since I fell on it.”
“We don’t have good school memories, Harry. We hated each other. You fought and won a war I was on the wrong side of.”
. You said it yourself. It’s a set of rules I have to follow, so it doesn’t work if I’m not doing it properly. I need to ice-skate with a bloke.”
Harry’s finding it hard to catch a breath. He dashes to the tunnel, where the players are still shaking hands and posing for pictures. Maxwell is at the centre of an adoring clutch of fans, blushing and happy. When he catches sight of Harry, he extricates himself.
A Healer kneels beside Harry where he sits on the stone steps in the sun. She runs through a battery of diagnostic charms.
screams at him from the front page of the sports section, right over a picture of Harry and Draco that he didn’t realise was being taken. They’re sitting in the coach’s box, and as ever, Draco’s got his ridiculously long legs kicked up on the guardrail, sunglasses pushed high in his blond hair, looking for all the world like he’s on a sodding holiday in the Riviera somewhere. Harry, with his wild mop of black hair, looks like a thundercloud, biting his fingernails and concentrating on the game.
Draco rolls his eyes, but inside his heart is hammering in his chest. He should say that they can get another room somewhere. That they’re in a city with a thousand hotels. He definitely should not take Potter home to his flat. But however this thing with he and Potter ends, it might be worth it to see Potter's eyes sliding shut in ecstasy against his Slytherin-green bed linen. The sight of it alone would make his teenage self turn the same colour.
The Arrows have a bye, and so Draco’s absence isn’t causing too many difficulties, but the players keep looking to Harry for explanations that he doesn’t have. Maxwell continues to insist that Draco charmed his broom before the game, and certainly has no reason to lie about it. And Harry’s frustrated because Draco owes him a bloody explanation himself, but is nowhere to be found and isn’t answering Harry’s owls. Which, if Harry was looking for more proof of his guilt, is frankly pretty compelling. He really should have seen this coming.
does. Don’t prove them right by refusing to follow it now.”  She refastens her robes as she stands. “It’s nothing. I’ll check it out, sign the Manor off as uninvolved, and you can go about your day.”
A door at the far end of the library swings open and Ron comes in. He’s showered and changed out of his hunting attire, but the magical silver ribbon is still pinned to his chest, over his shirt pocket. Harry refrains from rolling his eyes.
“I’ve not once said that I’m sorry,” Harry says quietly. “For your loss, I mean. I know your feelings are… well, I know how much he hurt you and your mother. But he was your father. And I really am. Sorry, I mean.”
Andromeda pauses at the counter, where she’s wanding various sandwich ingredients together as they dance out of the pantry. She frowns slightly. “Is everything alright? You know, if you want me to sign the Black vault back over to you, you only need say the word. I mean, this house is more than generous enough…”
. By all accounts, he basically invented entirely new branches of magic to restore to them what he felt they were owed. But with Harry? He did the bare minimum and was done. Just enough to complete the work they’d agreed on months earlier. The bloody rings weren’t even fixed, by his own admission. Just put on ice, like burying radioactive waste in the ground. Draco couldn’t have been clearer about how he thought of Harry.
Draco was determined to get through the morning without crying, but now he’s not so sure he’s going to make it.
Curse Breaker Sato sucks in a gasp as if Harry’s just suggested running over a puppy in the street. Malfoy is merely looking at him with one eyebrow raised, as if Harry’s just confirmed every negative impression he’s ever had.
The rest of the week is a bit of a shambles. Malfoy and Wood continue to butt heads over even the smallest things, leaving Harry caught between a rock and a hard place. While it pains Harry to admit it, about half the time Wood is being a bit unreasonable, but Harry will be damned if he’s going to side with Draco Malfoy against the captain he specifically hired and has played with since he was eleven. And that leaves Harry feuding with Malfoy over everything from what the players should wear for their training practices to whether it’s appropriate to punish tardiness with flying laps.
“I’m surprised the goblins signed off on hiring him,” Hermione muses. “It’s been incredibly difficult for anyone with the Mark to get work legally. McGonagall wanted to take pity on Gregory Goyle’s father and let him do a bit of groundskeeping at Hogwarts. The Trustees weren’t having a bar of it.”
“How on earth do you have that amount of balance on a broom?” he blurts out, before wondering if he’s being rude, but Leila seems unfazed. She glances at Malfoy, and they seem to have a brief, unspoken conversation using only their eyebrows.
“I didn’t do it for you, Harry,” Luna replies calmly. “This work can have all kinds of benefits in player rehabilitation and physical therapy. Kinesiological spellwork is very new, and this Healer is doing some cutting-edge research. I’m learning a lot.”
Merry Christmas to those who celebrate and to those who don't, I hope you have a wonderful and peaceful holiday. Come hang out on
could appear at any minute, for Merlin’s sake, Harry is surprised to find that he feels comfortable. At home. “Hey,” he asks, as they stack the last of the beams. “If I wanted to fix a wooden step, where would I start?”
. “Yeah, what. So he can slap his name on a new hospital wing at St Mungo’s or something? Bask in all the glory?”
loud and angry. It’s not even a noise. Robert’s never experienced magic like this. Never been able to actually sense it vibrating in the air around him. He’s struck with the urge to leave immediately. He feels a bit sick.
“She’s just being practical,” Malfoy offers quietly. “Hannah’s not going to be able to do anything more for Neville than Hermione could have sitting by Ron’s bedside.”
“It’s a horrible feeling,” Malfoy says, pushing back his empty plate. “Knowing that we somehow met and got to know each other and…” He trails off, leaving the end of the sentence heavy with suggestion. “And now I have no idea what that was like.”
The photographer gives him a look like he’s someone to be avoided — unpredictable and angry — and moves off quickly into the rush.
“I like to fly,” Draco says absently, taking in the details as he sits in the grass. Potter is still wearing glasses, but not the cheap, cracked plastic Muggle frames of his childhood. There is no scar on his forehead.
“What happened to you?” Harry whispers, horrified and awed and horribly turned on all at the same time.
It honestly hadn’t occurred to Harry that they’d go. Frankly he’d rather have food poisoning again than venture into the Puddlemere stadium if he doesn’t have to, and says as much.
Bill probably thinks this is an olive branch. A way for Harry to ease himself back in by catching up with one of his oldest friends one-on-one. It only goes to show that he doesn’t really know Hermione at all. Although, to be fair, Harry supposes
Hermione turns over the packet of cookie cutters and gives Harry a look. “Ambitious,” she smirks. “You never struck me as much of a baker.”  He takes them off her and shoves them in the pantry.
Harry stares at him. He’s tall and thin. Too thin. His face is gaunt and tired looking. His bright blond hair is chopped short, in a haphazard sort of way that might be stylish, but Harry wouldn’t really have a clue. He’s wearing plain, dark Muggle clothes that make him look even paler than Harry remembers.
.” He whispers the last words, as if the two of them weren’t completely alone in a greenhouse, surrounded by a howling snowstorm.
“It sounds really hopeful. Should I… speak with Draco about it as well? I think he’ll want to help. He really doesn’t blame Ginny.”
until he just up and does it. He’d never seen a broom before the first time he trounced you flying one.”
does a three-page spread about the heroes of the war returning to Hogwarts. Skeeter devotes a half page to the Saviour’s mysterious absence. Granger is quoted as saying that Potter is taking “some well-deserved time to himself.”
Hermione’s whole face is a mask of tired disapproval. In the years they’ve been Auror partners, it’s a look that’s become all too familiar.
!” Harry glances in astonishment between her and Ron, both of whom seem unfazed by this clearly earth-shaking revelation.
Harry glances back toward the Manor. The absolute last thing he wants to do right now is play-act his way to the end of this fiasco of hunting party, but he doesn’t want to give Malfoy the satisfaction of watching him storm off in a huff either. He still feels keyed up, the energy from arguing with Malfoy in the woods sparking under his skin. Malfoy, of course, seems completely unaffected, ignoring Harry entirely as he tends to his guests.
“I assume because she has nothing to tell them. She didn’t have anything to do with this. Whatever she says will be pure fabrication. If she stays silent, she can’t contradict the evidence.”
The cold shiver seems to take up residence in Harry’s stomach then. All he’s ever wanted? That doesn’t seem right. Politics is necessary, certainly. Stopping the Death Eaters from ever being in a position of power again is vital. And that’s what really matters. But
Zabini, appearing not to have heard him, says, “Excuse me, sir? I didn’t catch that. Would you like to say a few words as well?”
It’s been a long, disastrous sort of day, and Harry’s cheered to come home to his tree. He remembers the calendar picture that Rose had revealed, and digs around in his Christmas shopping bags for the candles he’d purchased. Sure enough, when he lights a couple on the windowsill, the seventh door glows contentedly. Behind door nine, he finds a picture of a Christmas cracker. Something he hasn’t bought yet and definitely needs to. It can go on the list for when he stocks up on the groceries at the weekend. It’s not that he doesn’t trust Kreacher, but the elf’s cooking can go astray, and it won’t hurt to have a few back-ups in the pantry.
“I can’t stand England,” she hisses at Malfoy as she leaves. “Never forget that I’m doing this for you.”
Again, the light is suddenly far too bright. Harry blinks, shielding his eyes with his forearm, trying to let them quickly adjust. When he gets them open properly, he desperately wishes he hadn’t.
“So much of the Estate needed restoring after the war that the buildings themselves were the focus for the first few years. But now that work is complete, Draco has been able to move on to the flora and fauna.”
Harry knows better than to bug Malfoy about his progress, so to pass the time he resolves to try and do what he can to appease the cursed calendar.
“Wait here,” he says, dashing from the room and taking the stairs two at a time. The absolute last thing he needs is Malfoy seeing how grim his living arrangements are. But to Harry’s shock and surprise, the upper floors of Grimmauld Place feel almost …
“The argument turned physical. He kept… shoving at my chest, trying to goad me. And eventually I just snapped and shoved him back.”
During the week, the separate practices become less and less useful. Wood seems to be under a perpetual thundercloud, and Harry starts to worry that he might quit. It’s not like Parkinson’s tied
Among the many reasons Harry didn’t want to come to the game, seeing just how ridiculously good Puddlemere are was certainly among the top ten. Their opponents, the Magpies, are a class act, but Puddlemere is in a league of their own. Disciplined, unrelenting, and utterly unforgiving of any mistakes. It would be depressing, except that Harry’s quickly swept up in the energy of the crowd cheering for Montrose at home, their black flags and banners flapping like Dementors all around the stadium. While Draco takes copious notes, Harry finds himself just enjoying the feeling of being surrounded by thousands of excited fans, united in their love for their teams and their love for the game. Parkinson really has achieved something remarkable, he realises.
Confronted with the tall, blond reality of a not-remotely-threatening Draco Malfoy in his sitting room, Harry finds the words caught in his mouth. He feels stretched taut between the rage, suspicion and distrust he
"I'm sorry, Dragon, but I have to go. If I can save my position as a spy, then I must take the chance. I will come back and find you as soon as I get back. Also send word to Dumbledore." Snape gently pulled Draco's hands off his robes and summoned his Death Eater robes and mask.
Harry was so far gone that he didn't even feel Draco's eyes on him, something that the former war survivor would normally have noticed right away. He continued to stroke himself as he lathered up his hand with soap. Slowly he spread his legs, gingerly circling his entrance with one finger, before sliding it in, adding a second moments after.
“Why don’t you go out for a walk by the lake and have dinner down there? We did it last week and it was nice.” Blaise spoke as he settled in close to his brother. “You should go before it gets too cold.”
“No need to thank me at all. Why don’t you get a cup of coffee from Blaise, there is water in the kettle if you prefer tea, Sir, and I’ll talk to Harry about whipping up some food for Lady Malfoy.”
“No, but they have been watching after you and they are so proud of who you have become. They wanted to see you too, but they can’t just yet, not until it’s your time and this is certainly not it.”
"Honestly, Potter. You're pretty good at coming up with ideas, but you're really shite at researching them if all you do is stand there. You do know that to find a book you have to look at it right?" Hermione rolled her eyes in a good natured fashion as she often did with Ron, and Harry took that as a good sign. Since her move into the dorm, Pansy and Hermione seemed to become fast friends.
Draco wasn’t the only one, Harry hadn’t known either and by the look of startled respect on Severus’ face he’d also been the none the wiser.
"You wouldn't dare." Draco laughed. He was completely naked and he laid back down on the bed, spread out for Harry's enjoyment. Before he could brace himself, Harry used his catlike reflexes to run and pounce on the bed, effortlessly landing on top of Draco, their eyes meeting as a spark of magic went off around them.
“I’d prefer to go with you, or at least have one of us join you.” Draco finally said out loud and Harry shook his head.
“We’re all going to have to help out researching this to figure it out, do you think Dumbledore will give you any more information?” Hermione asked as she finished scanning the last page.
Harry sighed as he put the letter down after reading it over at least three times. He wished Ron would just grow up sometimes. It was very typical of Ron to think that everything Harry did was his way of either taking Ron's side or going against the red-head. Harry had been hoping that with time he would realize that not everything in Harry's life revolved around his best-mate. His wishes had yet to be granted seeing as Ron still threw temper tantrums over everything.
"It was a good meeting, I'm impressed with how well organized you have the students, Harry." Harry colored slightly at the compliment, but took it in stride.
“Excuse me?” Harry hissed before quickly healing his hand and cleaning his glasses with a few wordless spells. He was far beyond hiding his magic from the old wizard. He had a feeling that the night would more of him than he could give without showing his hand. That and he was sure that Dumbledore knew just how powerful Harry was, as every feat of magic he performed in front of him didn’t garner any reactions.
him had shaken the boy to his core. He never asked again, but he always made sure to kiss and lick every one, to worship Harry's body and let the boy know that no matter what his past held, he would always love him. This time, he moved his hands from the scars on the boy's side and instead moved his hands to his sensitive back. Draco's hands were less gentle as he dug the pads of his fingers into Harry's spine, slowly working out every knot they could find. Moaning, Harry let his body relax into Draco's touch, letting his mate take the lead.
"He likes me?" Honestly Harry was a bit flabbergasted. It wasn't that he didn't think that he was likable, but knowing that Draco was actually interested in him and he hadn't just completely scared off the other boy was more than he could hope for. He might seem confident in himself this year, and for the most part he was, but Draco was the exception. Draco was always Harry's exception to everything.
No, if he never talked to the man again it would be too soon. It was only the fact that Dumbledore was obviously hiding something that made Harry keep him close and the clock was ticking on the time that he had left. Like he had said to Snape, it was only a matter of time before the old wizard was taken out of the school again and that was the real reason Harry was going to talk to Bill. Harry knew that there would come a time when he would have to leave the school to a safe location, somewhere where he could bring the closest Order members whom would be in the most danger and continue to train them until the final battle. In order to do that, Harry would need a house and a secret keeper. He would also have to tell Bill as little as possible, as the man would not be the secret keeper, but Harry had faith that the eldest Weasley son would trust Harry enough to help him. That and when Harry was done, he would be allowing the man access.
The collective gasp from the room was enough to draw the attention of the girls, though neither dared tear their gaze from the other. Pansy nodded slightly, tucking her wand away and holding her hand out to Hermione, the smirk replaced by a genuine smile.
"Mr. Potter, you will serve detention promptly after dinner. Arrive at my office no later than fifteen past eight. Do you understand?" It wasn't a question, but Harry nodded anyways. They where keeping up the act just incase someone was watching outside the door.
“Yes. You have come in contact with one of them already. The diary that you destroyed in your second year was no normal diary.”
"You're right." Harry backed down, bowing his head knowing that he was acting childishly towards his two closest friends. They would have not idea what as going through his mind anymore because he never let them in.
But the most important thing to consider was how Draco felt. While Harry had a good idea and Ginny seemed to think that the boy also liked him, it didn't mean anything until Draco said the words himself. Harry turned to look to his side. Draco was taking notes diligently in a way that would make Hermione proud. His long elegant fingers gripped the feather with ease, achieving a grace that Harry could never pull off. They were truly opposites, day and night, but maybe that was what brought them together in the end. While Harry found these differences endearing, would Draco find them annoying?
"He is, but I'm not sure about his attitude." Katie shook her head as Cormac made an overly dramatic flip to add flare to the save, but missed the quaffle and Ginny did a victory lap around the goals looking rather smug while Cormac looked less than happy with himself.
“While we’re talking about learning things, I heard that you might have figured out a solution to us needing to bring the furniture from Harry’s vaults to the house when it’s built.” Draco commented from his spot on the couch. Ron was sitting with him flipping through a Quidditch magazine and he stopped to listen. Neville and Dean were working on homework at the table while Pansy, Blaise, and Seamus were in the kitchen putting together snacks and drinks for everyone. The room quieted as every stopped to listen to what the girl had created.
"Why don't we sneak off?" Draco whispered in Harry's ear as their friends began to head off in small, unassuming groups. "I'm sure no one will miss us." Draco's tongue licked a gentle path up the shell of Harry's ear making the boy shutter and his eyes close. "I'm sure I can think of plenty of things that we could do to kill time."
There was a cold draft in the dungeons and it made Snape's cloak whip around him. It was his turn to patrol and it was nearing midnight. The night had been uneventful, but it was far from over. In all his years being a spy he knew that the cold feeling crawling up his spine could only mean that something bad was going to happen. He took his last round of the hall and nothing seemed out of place, though he kept a trained eye for any sign of movement. There was a noise from around the corner and Snape turned quickly to catch the student before they got away.
I just wanted to thank everyone of my readers! You guys are the best! If you’re looking to read more of my work, I’ve self-published a book! It’s about vampires set in a fantasy world in the equivalent of a medieval era. They are on the brink of a civil war as well as being dangerously close to being exposed to the ignorant humans who live right on their borders. The book is called Born in Shadows and can currently be purchased on Amazon both in paperback and Kindle. Here is the
"You know that the offer still stands, we could move you in today." Harry tried gently, knowing that Draco wouldn't take his offer well.
"Well you're eager to tell someone, so spill." Ginny smiled patiently, knowing that Harry would tell her.
"I mean we're going to all build it together." Harry smiled sheepishly and Draco rolled his eyes, kissing the boy on the cheek.
“Hufflepuff?” Dumbledore asked confused and Harry snorted in response, turning to face the miserable creature to give the man some privacy as he wiped the lingering tears from his eyes.
“Because I suspect that these chests are made of the same material and imbued with the same spells.” Dumbledore spoke in the tone he often used when he wanted to sound wise and all knowing, there had been a time when that tone had worked on Harry, but even now he was sure that the old wizard truly believed the words he was speaking.
Draco found Harry in his room hours later. The sun was setting and the light played on the man's skin making it seem even more golden than normal. How suiting. Draco thought to himself, smiling when Harry looked up from his book to meet his eyes.
"Oh, hey." Draco looked up to Harry, his gaze uncertain. "You know it's not fair to them that you're always coming here to talk to me, but won't give them the time of day." Draco's gaze bore into Harry and the Gryffindor instantly felt ashamed. He was right.
“That is not of your concern.” Draco drawled, falling back into his pureblood mask and Pansy did the same. Harry would have been more impressed if he hadn’t been watching the pure hatred in the elf’s eyes turn into reverence as his eyes fell on them.
"I'll let you unpack your things." Harry said after the moment passed. He could tell that a lot was running through Draco's mind and he made to leave to give him space.
“If we had joined forces we could have kept Tom at bay, we could have insured the world took the turn we wanted. We could have remained together.” Gellert had moved closer, so close that he was able to cup Dumbledore’s face. “My dear we could have had it all and instead you threw me in prison and condemned me for taking your ideas and bringing them to life.”
“There is strong dark magic in this room,” Dumbledore spoke, his voice no longer betraying the strong emotions that Harry had witnessed the man express just moments before. He was closed off once more and the boy found this man much easier to deal with because he was much easier to hate without having to do any introspection.
"Dumbledore can no longer be trusted." It was a statement, not a question, one that Harry was more than a bit relieved to here the older man say.
This chapter was edited and reposted on 3/28/2020. As always, all mistakes are mine. This story is not BETA'd.
"Merlin that is just what we need, Potter getting it in his head that he's a leader." Severus' groaned, rubbing his face with his hand.
"You are both very similar, I know." Blaise said, understanding that there were things about Draco that he would never relate to. As much as he didn’t like that Potter was the one who was there for him, he was at least happy that Draco had someone to talk to who could empathize with him.
“Are you insane? If that doesn’t work then we’ll both be dead.” Harry stared at the wizard as if he had never truly seen him before, though Dumbledore seemed hardly bothered by the look.
It seemed the snakes finally realized that they were not alone when the rumble of the stone moving into place passed and they halted in their circuits to scrutinize the young wizard.
It took longer than Harry thought it ought to for the students to empty the room. Some of the students were clearly trying to hang back to see what would happen between the two. Harry noticed that most were members of the DA. He had a sinking feeling that Ron and Hermione were not the only two that he had completely shut out without meaning to.
The beater tryouts went faster than the chasers. There where fewer people trying out and many were disqualified straight away because they were too young and or too small to even lift the bat and swing at the bludgers. After Harry angrily cleared off his over eager fans, the only two left were Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.
"Changing the topic?" Harry responded with a question of his own, his hand going into his pocket to retrieve the note that Pansy slipped there. He kept his eyes on the girl, holding the parchment in front her vision. "Tell me about this, what was so important that you risked being seen in broad daylight?"
“Home indeed,” he whispered, though the cheeky grin thrown over Hermione’s shoulder made it obvious that she had heard.
“Okay, enough,” Harry cut in before the two could continue to bicker, though his fond smile told Severus that this was a fairly regular occurrence and not something to worry about. “I want to talk to Narcissa, if that’s okay, Draco and Severus I’d like you there, not that I think I could convince either of you not to come, Neville, would you mind joining us?”
“Sev’rus,” Narcissa whimpered by his side. She moved toward him, wrapping her arms around him before effectively burrowing herself into his embrace.
"Yes well, she might be a bit flighty, but I know for a fact that she was the one who set up all the traps for Ginny. It seems that dear old Daphne has been telling her stories about our first and second years, so I suppose that's why she was trying to mimic them, maybe to make you think that it was an older student. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that we have a bigger problem on our hands."
"What if they choose you?" Draco responds. He looked almost childlike and his eyes grew wide in obvious fear. It broke Severus' heart to see him that way and Harry reflexively pulled the blond in for a strong hug.
"We're just going to wait for the others to show up first, if you want to have a seat." Harry said to Pansy, indicating the chairs around the large oak table. "Draco and Ron can fill you in on what we know so far, if you could wait for everyone else to start discussing what we know about the attackers, I would really appreciate it."
. Harry realized, shaking his head at Voldemort. He was disgusted at the monster’s latest crime against wizarding kind, specifically to children who should not be tortured for things that were never in their power. But what did Draco telling him mean? He was sure that Voldemort had a back up plan set up. He was sure that there was no way that anyone actually expected Draco to succeed. While this didn't mean that Professor Dumbledore was in the clear, what did this mean of Malfoy and his loyalties? Slowly coming to himself, Harry realized that his magic had been let loose, quickly retracting it in time to hear the sharp intake of breath on Malfoy's part.
That was when Draco noticed the sound of water coming from the bathroom that was connected to Harry's room. While part of him really wasn't sure if going into Harry's private bathroom was a good idea, a stronger part (the part that really hopped that Harry was fine and that he would be able to catch a glimpse of him naked) overruled whatever sense he had left in him and opened the door. The sight that greeted Draco made his mouth go dry.
Harry couldn't wrap his mind around his own emotions and so he did the only rational thing he could think of, he headed to his room where a bottle of firewhisky and shot glass sat waiting for him.
Harry wasn’t sure if the man meant the end of his time at the school or if he truly meant that he was meeting his end. Harry knew that Snape had been forced to take the on the task that had been meant for Draco. He knew that the two would have plan in place for what was to come next, but it surprised Harry to see a man who seemed to believe himself above the rules admit that his life was over.
The fight from just the past week rose in Harry's mind again and he briefly wondered if the man was reading his mind again, but a quick check of his mental walls reassured him that he was still very well protected. Apparently he was not as good at hiding his insecurities as he had once thought.
Harry made sure to pump his fingers in and out of himself at the same speed that he stroked himself, turning the hand around his cock pulling more heated groans from his lips. When he finally found his prostate, Harry's knees almost gave out and he came into his own hand crying out Draco's name.
“The leprechaun gold? No, we’re well past that.” Fred laughed, taking his other arm and leading him with his twin to the back room. They waved to Tom in unison and waltzed into the back room of the bar, kicking the door closed together before hauling the thief into the nearest chair.
"So I know what a lot of you are thinking. I know that we've once again brought two new members into our circle without consulting all of you, and believe me when I say that I'm really sorry that this has all happened the way it has. I know that you're all weary of accepting both Professor Snape and Pansy Parkinson as you were with Draco and Blaise, maybe even more so, but you have my word and the word of all of your instructors that you are still very safe here. They are meant to be helping us and I don't know about all of you, but I appreciate all the help that I can get. Now I know that you will all have a lot of questions, but it's already late and there is a lot that needs to get done today. You know who your instructors are, pull them aside at the end of the night, or in your dorms tonight if you know that you're not being overheard and ask your questions then." Harry paused long enough for anyone to object. He looked to every member of the junior order, each nodding to him that they knew how to handle any possible problem brought on by one of the younger DA members. When Harry was satisfied, he continued. "Okay good, so our first order of business is very important, we're going to be breaking you up into groups. Today is going to be a practical lesson for not only defense, but also for potions. One half of the group will be working with the assigned defense instructors on the left side of the room, the rest will be working with myself, Draco, and Blaise, and Professor Snape on simple potions that we will then keep in our personal DA stock, just incase. We're going to call it a little early tonight for the younger students, the rest of you know what's expected of you after the meeting." Hermione had been the one to suggest to have Severus and Pansy sit in on their first junior order meeting that night rather than complicate things which Harry had been very grateful for the suggestion.
"You're not fooling me, you know, I know you're planning something with that traitorous son of mine." The spittle flying from Lucius' mouth was enough to make Severus flinch back in utter distaste.
“Do you really think that he would let young Draco follow him into what will certainly be his own doom? He has heard the prophecy at this point. One cannot live without the other. He is a child, but he must know what that means.”
"Draco can fill you in when he feels ready. I have to talk to Professor McGonnagal. I think it would be wise to move you and Draco into the Gryffindor classes, it would be safer."
"I'll go to Dumbledore." That seemed to seal the deal. The man visibly deflated and seemed to give up entirely. He reached into his desk, pulled out a stack of parchment bound together by string, and placed it on the table.
The halls were empty since most of the students were in classes with an exception to the sixth years. A majority of their year would be in the library as exams were close with end of term so near and Harry was mildly surprised that Hermione hadn’t been orchestrating a very elaborate study plan for the group already. Draco held his hand loosely in his own while he gently guided them through the castle. They passed portraits who bid them good afternoon and even one of the castle ghosts was out, with whom they’d nodded to without stopping. Otherwise they stayed in a pleasant silence. Harry was just going to ask where Draco was taking him when they rounded a corner to a set of stairs that only lead to one section of the castle. Draco took them to the empty wall and walked past it three times. When a small, nondescript door appeared, Harry smiled, allowing his lover to take his hand and lead him in.
“Here, take this,” he whispered as he held out the antidote. It would not cure her of her madness, but it would take away much of the physical effects of her torture. It seemed that she did still recognize him as Voldemort suggested, and she trusted him enough to take the potion without question. The ever present trembling in her arms and legs seemed to disappear instantly and she looked at him in awe.
Harry nodded and went up to the second level of their private living quarters to the washroom connected to Draco's room. He had used it many times before as he had a habit of falling asleep on the couch during long study sessions with both or either boy and various Gryffindors from their year who shared classes with them. When he entered the sizable room he was happy to find his spare toiletries right where he had left them as well as the spare set of clothes that he made sure that Dobby kept clean and stocked in the cupboard. If Harry hadn't known better he would say that it looked as if he as lived in the chambers, or was at least dating one of the men who did. Maybe this was what Blaise was getting at, the boy wondered as he stripped down and stepped into the hot water that he had spelled from the tap.
"We should have Slytherin as our portrait, he wouldn't let in any Gryffindor in without asking." Blaise glared at the amused portrait.
"Harry, you just need to talk to him." Hermione piped up again, bring the conversation back to the topic at hand. She didn't really need to know much about the boys' private lives, just the idea alone made her insides feel funny and it was not exactly the right time to be investigating why the idea of her two male friends going at it like rabbits made her a bit giddy and red at the ears.
"No we're over because you can't let go of the past and move on!" Hermione shouted back and tears came back to her eyes. She fingered her engagement ring for a moment longer before slipping it off and letting it drop to the floor.
"Are you speaking about Mr. Nott?" Minerva nodded glad that they were getting straight to the point. "Severus and I already discussed this, but we're going to let the incident go."
"Why now?" Harry watched him for a moment. "And if you say why not now I will not hesitate to leave you here." Draco surveyed him as if to see if he was being serious, it seemed that he had decided he was because his next answer was more forthcoming.
"Meet me in my dorm after, we need to talk." Draco brushed his hand over Harry's arm as he passed, making the action look accidental, but Harry knew better. He felt much calmer knowing that Draco seemed to understand.
“Well, there’s no reason to waste a good opportunity.” Harry agreed which Draco nodded along with enthusiastically. They made their goodnights quick so they could run to their room, matching grins stretched across their faces.
“Oh Mum, I’m so happy to see you,” Draco mumbled, into his mother’s hair. Her unmistakable tears hit his cheek where their cheek’s were pressed and he felt his own tears of joy spill from him.
"Slow down, we're both okay." Harry reassured and Luna nodded slowly from her place still in Harry's arms.
"Good, now be a gentleman and walk me home." Draco rolled off the Gryffindor who moaned at the loss.
"Well then don't try so hard, let life take you where it wants you to go." Ginny patted the back of his and in a loving manner.
"The older girl in my group seems good." Draco nodded towards the girl in question who as flying circles and doing loops with Ginny.
Severus did his best to guide Narcissa to the mouth of the opening by the light of the fire, dying as it was. There was a ladder that descended no more than six feet before hitting the tightly packed dirt ground. He made his way down the ladder first, knowing that if Narcissa should fall, he would be there to catch her. They made their way into the tiny cellar with relative ease and Severus pulled the handle on the latch, closing them in. He heard above them as the rug slid back into place, muffling and noise from the bar.
"Please stop watching me. I'm not going to run away." Draco spoke with a harsher edge to his voice than he had meant. He instantly felt guilty when he looked up and saw the hurt clear on Harry's face. "Sorry."
Harry settled back down next to Draco, pulling him into a hug again, this time placing his head on his shoulder, laying his own head on top of Draco's. Whatever they were, he wasn't sure, but he did know that in that moment it felt right. For once in Harry's life, he felt like he belonged and somehow he knew that he would only ever feel this way while in Draco's arms.
“We have a pretty shiny galleon for you and everything, how does that sound?” George pulled the coin from his pocket and held it out. The wretch scrambled out to grab the coin as he examined it to make sure it was real.
“Bugger off Gin, unless you want burnt breakfast.” Harry called back, though his smile betrayed him.
Neville nodded and smiled, collecting the dirty dishes and rejoining his friends in the loud kitchen. A quick glance showed worried looks from both Severus and Draco and he smiled to them and nodded to show that all was well. The pair visibly sagged with relief at the slight gesture and Neville accepted the fresh mug of tea that Luna handed him in favor of handing over the dirty dishes.
“Oh yes, my boy. You must be tired. I think it’s best if I tell Harry that I need to speak with him. I fear his trust in you could still use some work.” The look he received told him that Dumbledore very seriously doubted his own words, but Severus knew better than to push his luck.
"Good or bad, we need them." Hermione simply nodded, knowing that the conversation would have to wait. There were too many things that needed to be done that night and Severus and Pansy would just have to try and integrate into the group just as fast as Draco and Blaise did.
There didn’t seem a good reason to argue his point and Harry couldn’t find it in himself to try. “Okay, if you are sure.”
“What was taken?” Voldemort roared, his wand drawn as the second man began to rise up before the enraged wizard.
“Well then if this is the real thing, and as rare as you suggest, then does that make the whole story real?”
"Harry what's taking so long, we're all waiting for you!" Ginny called as she ran into the locker room, stopping in surprise at the intimate moment she surely just broke. "Oh, sorry just be out in the pitch in a second."
Harry wasn't sure if it was the show of self deprecation, or the hint of maturity in the Slytherin's eyes, that made him lower his wand, but he did. His stance became more relaxed though his guard was still up and sat back down in the grass.
"That's the third score for Gryffindor! That brings them 30-0! This might not be much of a game after all!"
“Alright and then everyone else can keep working on trying to figure out the rest of the horcruxes.” A collective groan went through the room and Harry chuckled. “I know, it’s not ideal, but there has to be something we’re missing.”
In the days that passed since his meeting with Dumbledore the core worked on what information they would provide to the rest of the Junior order and to the DA at large. They didn’t intend on lying to anyone, but it was obvious that the horcruxes were extremely sensitive information and the fewer who knew of them the better. Luna often sat out during these conversations, being too much a free spirit to hammer down strategies and hard lines and she spent the time with Harry instead, the pair setting up camp in front of the fire in joined silence as the arguments raged on behind them. Harry wasn’t ready to put his own ideas on the table as of yet, especially when he wasn’t sure just what it was he was feeling.
“We tried to follow the children, but they apparated away and their trail went cold.” The man on the ground cried.
And then Harry saw it. Beyond Ron's angry exterior, he was looking at Harry as a friend still. He was clearly worried about his best mate, though he didn't show it well. As Harry had thought about the past summer and the few times that Ron tried to seek him out he realized that he’d snubbed him every time. Eventually the red-head had given up and had been aggressive ever since, but had never left Harry's side. Normally Ron would have just left, he didn't often stick around when upset, but for Harry’s sake he’d stayed. After all that they’d been through, Ron was not going to abandon him again. And Hermione, her way of showing that she cared was through mothering and bugging someone until they gave in and spilled their secrets. They had both meant well and Harry had thrown them aside and clung to Draco because the boy just seemed to understand without needing to be told. But Harry couldn't run anymore, hiding was for cowards and he was a Gryffindor.
"I'm so glad that they have each other." Godric said, a small, sad smile gracing his lips. He and Salazar had stayed with the two through the whole time. He turned to his lover, pulling the man into his arms. Harry's pain had hit both of them just as it had Draco and the somber mood remained in the room despite the two leaving.
"So the last thing that I wanted to tell you, and I promise that after this I will let you go," laughter could be heard around the room. It was nearing one in the morning and many of the kids where trying to stifle their yawns, "because I was training with my wandless magic over the summer I was able try out new spells because I couldn't be traced by the ministry through my wand. The reason why I seemed to know so much about the patronus today in class and subsequently about animagus' is because I became an illegal animagus." Harry nearly laughed at the collective gasp let out by everyone in the room.
"Or that I suppose. Though if I were a politician I think I would run out of patience too quickly and be out of a job." Harry rolled his eyes at the mere thought. He had been approached by the Ministry once. Of course he had turned them out point blank and they made sure that no news had ever made it to the public, they hadn’t needed the bad press at the time, they certainly didn’t need any of it now.
”Good." Harry let go of the other boy's hand. Draco hadn't noticed that he had been holding it, but instantly missed the comfort it brought. There was some sort of calm power radiating off of the other boy and while he hadn't noticed it until their hands touched, now he couldn’t ignore it. The ominous power that had just minutes ago nearly suffocated him seemed to now envelope him in protection.
Harry took his time rimming Draco, loving every gasp and moan that fell from his lips When he was sure that he was extra sensitive, Harry pulled away and lined up his leaking cock with Draco’s hole. The Slytherin had little time to complain as Harry pushed into Draco’s welcoming heat. They had done this enough times and Draco was prepared enough that they didn’t have to start slow and Harry rocked his hips at a bruising rate. Draco clawed at his shoulders and cried out with every thrust.
With a curt nod, Harry left, knowing that the conversation was far from over, but he wasn't about to push Snape further. He simply had too much to do before the night was up to bother with the man.
Harry allowed the old wizard a moment before he made his way through the door. It wouldn’t do to leave him behind, but he also needed a moment to collect himself and Harry could allow him that much. He could not fathom what it must have been like for him to face off the love of his life and to not only capture him, but also know that he was rotting in a prison. Harry didn’t want to think what he might do if that had been him and Draco.
"Harry," Draco spoke softly, placing his hand on his arm to talk the man. Hermione stood behind Draco with Neville.
"Thank you." Draco whispered, his lips grazing over Harry's neck in the process. The Gryffindor sucked in a breath, his heartbeat running faster at the feel of the smooth lips on his skin. Draco, realizing what an effect he was having on the boy, decided to continue to talk with his lips just grazing his neck. "Are you alright Harry? I can feel your heart racing. Maybe you want to call the meeting early? I'm sure they would understand."
"Easier said than done, my boy. It has taken me a long time and I’ve only found one more though I have yet to destroy it." This was when Harry finally looked at the man. His eyes traveled down to the hand that was being held out to him and he saw the gray, dying look of the skin and the harsh ring sitting on his finger.
“I know it’s long overdue. Maybe it’s too late, I don’t know.” He runs a hand through his hair and leans forward on his knees, looking down at the carpet. “All I can say is that back then, I was young, stupid, and not in a good place. I’d had six months in New York and it was such a welcome relief to feel anonymous and free of expectations. And Nigel and Thomas had been so supportive, and I finally felt like I was starting to understand who I was.” He glances up. Hermione is frowning, but she’s listening.
Around them, Harry’s guests are starting to chatter animatedly, piecing together what must have happened. It feels almost like a party again, particularly now that the horrible weight of suggestion has lifted off his shoulders. Harry turns to Draco to say as much and is startled to find him looking bereft, twirling an empty champagne flute in his fingers.
“No idea,” he sighs. “I guess I’ll need to wait and see what this new CEO wants to do. I get the feeling there’ll be a lot of cost-cutting involved.” Harry can’t see how there won’t be. He’s seen the accounts. He knows how bad it is.
“I think he feels it’s something he has to do,” Lovegood says, scraping her spoon noisily across the bottom of her bowl. “I see him an awful lot when he’s injured. Harry has a strong sense of duty.”
“No one likes stripping wallpaper,” Draco argues back, but he takes a couple of cold beers to the East Wing around five and sits with Potter in the fading sun talking about nothing anyway.
“I didn’t think ghosts could do that,” Neville gasps, kicking away the bits of stone that surround them where they dropped. “Poltergeists, sure, but not ghosts.”
to break some bad news.” She looks him up and down, and her panic is replaced with confusion. “What’s going on? Why are you here?”
Harry shakes his head. “I don’t think so, no. Coaching is what makes me really happy. But I should be
“Still working on that bit,” Ron admits, as the fire lets off a whoosh of sparks. “Just saw the Knut-boxes full of this trash and sort of… grabbed them and Apparated home before I really thought about it.”
. The awful part is he doesn’t even really recognise such a relaxed and happy version of himself. Lately it’s felt like his life has consisted of nothing but his Auror cases and the campaign. More recently it’s just consisted of feeling exhausted and paranoid all the time.
He nurses his drink, looking around the room desperate for clues, anything he recognises, but there’s nothing. He’s sure he’d remember coming somewhere this distinctive. When he finds himself studying every blond who enters a little too closely he swivels back to the bar to order something stronger.
Harry feels taken aback at Draco being so conciliatory. He tries to accept the olive branch for what it is. “They played really well today. They were so fast. And the way you’ve gotten Maxwell’s feints to come along. He’s so much better than even a couple of weeks ago.”
“Are we ready?” she asks quietly, and when they’ve all nodded and taken out their wands, “Then let’s begin.”
“OK, quickly,” Hermione says, rushing across the corridor. “The defence classroom will have a set of
“No,” Draco says, “I think Harry had his party. It’s just that no one who was invited can remember going. In fact, they didn’t remember he’d even planned to have one.”
Draco seems satisfied with that explanation and goes back to practising his part of the spells. Harry studies him from his spot on the sofa. It took the rest of them weeks to get their roles prepared to Hermione’s satisfaction. Draco’s had only days — hours, really, given everything else they’ve been contending with — but already his wand movements are clipped and precise in perfect order. Harry doesn’t want to examine the warm feeling he’s experiencing too closely for fear it might be pride, or something worse.
In the immediate aftermath of the roasted chestnut bombardment, it felt like every person working in the Ministry came running. The mediwizards made sure that no-one’s injuries were serious, refusing to let Harry do anything until he’d submitted to a completely unnecessary examination.
“Everyone had a reason to loathe Lucius. Draco’s friends because of what their parents put them through over the years at his urging or insistence. Our friends because of the things he did to us at school and during the war. But I think the important part of this is not what happened in the distant past, but how those things have played out in our lives since. That’s what I think this is about.”
“So, Harry, counting down the days now, I suppose?” Arthur asks. “I must say, it will be good to have some clear direction from the top.”
Later, over lamb stew and smoked eggplant, Harry is laughing and insisting that Draco can absolutely
,” Hermione gasps, and he realises that all of the magic in the ritual is now flowing through them and into the centre of the circle. It’s too much. It would have been too much had it only been the four of the them, but the four of them imbued with all of the power of the founders is catastrophic. She collapses to the floor.
Ron spins around to glare at Harry’s pack, but as far as Harry can tell it’s just plain green canvas, no arachnids in sight.
And then suddenly they’re in the middle of Harry’s bedroom, and all the blood has definitely departed from Harry’s brain, and so he’s confused when everything jerks to a halt and he’s left half-in, half-out of his shirt, Draco frozen still in front of him.
Harry’s trying to muster up an outraged defence. He’s here every Friday, after all. And he loves Ron and Hermione and their kids. He always remembers Teddy’s birthday. And he loves Christmas at the Burrow. It’s not
“And that’s why you’ve been coming to dinner. Because you want to help with the Trust? That’s the only reason?”
“Listen, I’m knackered,” Harry finally sighs, what seems like hours later. His eyes are swimming and his neck aches, and there’s a weird lump in his throat about the idea of discussing sleeping arrangements. He needs to be somewhere Malfoy is not, so he can stop thinking about how ‘hot scholar’ is definitely a look that suits him. “I’ll leave some pyjamas and a towel in the guest room.”
“Right, I’ve had enough of this,” he announces, glaring at all of them. Harry’s stomach sinks. “Our little group has had too many misunderstandings of late, so we’re not going to have any more.”
Harry’s not sure, really. Some time in the last couple of weeks, he supposes, without him really realising. Maybe that time he’d felt all frayed at the edges and Jack had handed him the wallpaper steamer and pointed at the East Wing and he’d worked for hours, hot and sweaty, tearing at the strips of ugly mauve paper, and just as he’d finished Draco had appeared with cold beer and asked him exactly nothing about why he was there.
“I’m going to look around,” Harry decides, pulling his scarf up over his nose. “We need to work out where that came from.”
He gets up out of the wobbly guest chair, once again taking up too much space. Harry feels tired and uncomfortable. He thinks he should probably be able to muster up some sympathy for Balham’s financial situation, but all he can think about are Luna and Nev and whether there will even be jobs for them come next week. For a second, Balham looks like he’s about to say something else, but then seems to decide better of it. He waddles out the door of Harry’s office without so much as a backward glance.
Harry refuses to let go of Draco’s hand as they push through the crowds at Kings Cross, finding a clear space to Apparate them both to the stadium. The moment they land, he starts tugging at the black bands around Draco’s forearm. Draco laughs at his impatience, untucking the end and unwinding the crepe bandage more carefully to reveal the clutch of lilies. The angry red mark is gone.
Harry finds it all a bit hard to believe, really. He so vividly remembers the first time he saw Quidditch played at Hogwarts, and that ill-fated World Cup. He’ll never get over the sheer talent and determination and skill involved when great players take to the sky. Why anyone with access to magic would want to shuffle a ball around on the ground with their feet is utterly beyond him.
So he has the Manor to himself for the moment, but he hates it. The halls feel lonely and echoing, and he decides to find the volumes he needs on the role of love in spell and curse casting and take them home to his flat.
“So what are we going to do?” Regardless of Malfoy’s motivations, the reality is that they still have a dysfunctional team and no ability to work together. Harry’s not sure there’s any sensible way to change that.
“No, wait! What about the rest! The snowman, and the house lights, and the….” Harry trails off before the word “mistletoe” can escape his lips.
He’s dressed as casually as Harry’s maybe ever seen him, in dark trousers and a sky blue shirt, and he kisses Harry hello as if he does it every day, and the whole effect leaves Harry a bit breathless.
Harry has a sudden, visceral flashback to that awful night in the Astronomy Tower. The way Malfoy had cried out,
Harry’s confused, but he doesn’t flinch when Draco gently takes hold of his forearm, raises the wand between them, and incants. The feeling of relief is instantaneous, as the inflamed nerve endings settle and a cool wash of magic passes over his arm. Harry exhales heavily.
charm,” Neville answers, scratching notes on a parchment in front of him. “Lifts the weight of the player and allows a much tighter corkscrew. The player can be upside down for longer without fearing that they’re going to slip or fall.”
He throws the paper in the bin and goes straight to Ottery St Catchpole, planning to collect Teddy and head home. Hermione is in the kitchen, kneading what looks like bread dough. He gives her a questioning look.
They don’t discuss sleeping arrangements, but after everyone has cleaned up, the girls head off to Hermione’s old dormitory leaving Harry and Malfoy alone.
Harry takes a long breath and strides up the wide stone stairs. The double doors swing open in front of him without so much as a knock, and he’s greeted immediately by a free elf in a snappy little uniform, who somehow seems even more impossibly obsequious now that he has his own clothes and is being paid for his services. He insists on taking Harry’s duffle, even though it’s almost twice his size, and grovels and fawns over Harry all the way up to a bedroom on the second floor in the East Wing.
Harry has a sudden and very vivid memory of the Lestrange vault and the endlessly multiplying, searing hot metal. He sucks in a short breath. Malfoy gives him a curious look, but Harry can’t bring himself to explain.
“It came with the house.” Harry feels slightly awkward saying it, as if he owes Malfoy some sort of explanation for inheriting a house full of Black heirlooms that would probably otherwise have passed to him, but Malfoy just looks curious.
orbit after so long, but Hermione has many more reasons to feel more strongly about it than Harry does.
“You’re right about that. At first, Hermione was simply very interested in the way the ceremony worked and what it meant for a couple’s magic. But you know her. Once she could see that there was a whole branch of magic she couldn’t have access to, she was determined to change that.”
He looks a little worried at this, as if perhaps this dereliction of duty contributed somehow to the ensuing tragedy.
Only Ron seems as taken aback as Harry, but as soon as he realises he’s been left in everyone else’s wake, he leaps over a nearby log and starts running as if he’s chasing a Dark Wizard. Harry still finds the whole thing a bit ridiculous, but he needs to speak to Malfoy, and that’s enough to propel him into motion after them all.
“I haven’t been here, on account of the ice and all,” Harry retorts, rolling his eyes behind Malfoy’s back. Malfoy reaches out and tries to open door twelve, but doesn’t have any luck.
To his surprise, Draco hasn’t changed out the magic on his windows, which still show the Manor grounds. In fact, the office now has two visitor chairs and an actual pot plant. It’s a spiky, ugly thing that doesn’t do much to soften the room at all, but Harry feels like it’s progress.
And so far he’s managed. Taught himself what he needed to know to get by in the Muggle world. Eked out an existence from his personal vault: the birthday gifts and small bequests from the Black side of the family that he’d amassed over the years. And he’s earning his own money now. Not much of it, not nearly enough, but that there’s any at
Casey does an actual double take when he sees Harry approaching, and then looks disgusted with himself. “You’re lucky McFrosty’s not on duty this afternoon. Even those jeans wouldn’t be tight enough to stop him from hexing your balls to the ceiling.”
They sit in a silence that stretches to become awkward. Neville drains the last of his coffee. “I should be getting back,” he says, as Harry reaches for his cup. Harry nods.
Harry’s head jerks up, and he looks shocked and disappointed, but Draco needs him out of his bedroom. Out of his
Luna comes back from the coffee cart with two steaming paper cups of hot chocolate, and Harry casts a surreptitious drying charm at a park bench for them to sit.
, Potter,” Parkinson barks. “He told me what happened, assured me he hadn’t broken any rules, and then he disappeared. He’s not in the hotel he’s been staying in. He’s not back at his place in Prague. I’ve tried his usual haunts and come up empty.”
Cassie draws in a quick, surprised breath. Ron puts his face in his hands, rubbing tiredly at his eyes.
Both Harry and Draco have lost any pretence of professionalism, screaming themselves hoarse in encouragement right along with the rest of the crowd. The Chasers form up in a final V, Beaters hot on their twigs, wildly casting hexes with the last of their energy, clear-cutting a path through the Harpies who are forced to dive away in all directions. Ninety seconds.
Teddy seems dismayed to learn there is now nothing to do but wait for the biscuits to cook and cool, and when Andromeda suggests he help with the washing up he’s immediately overcome with a theatrical range of cold symptoms and assures them he really needs to be back in bed.
Draco won’t even dignify that with a response, changing the subject immediately to the photo shoot for Pansy’s new fashion line and whether she’s managed to discover if the ferociously hot model she hired for the shoot is queer or not. His friends are easily distracted, and the wine flows freely as they catch up. They order olives and pita and hummus. Blaise complains about his job even though neither Draco nor Pansy have any idea what he does. Something involving hedge funds and foreign exchange that has them both faking exaggerated yawns within minutes. Now and again Draco wonders if Blaise is actually an Unspeakable. No one could actually do something so boring for a living; it must be a cover.
Harry, horrified, starts to cast wildly to bring the hurricane of deliveries under control, but they continue to fly around him, pinging off the stair bannisters and slapping against the floorboards. It’s like his Hogwarts letter all over again, but somehow a great deal more threatening. Postcards and tinsel-wrapped padded mailers keep shooting at his head and he’s forced to destroy them with hexes of increasing ferocity. With one final push of excess magic, he fires an Auror-strength sealing spell at the door and the deluge trickles to a halt. Stunned, Harry takes stock. Somehow, the barrage of mail that usually gets held at the owl centre and carefully sorted for him has managed to pile its way throughout his impenetrable home. There’s even a couple of Christmas cards that have flapped around and found a resting place on the mantlepiece.
“I honestly don’t know what you and Parkinson think you’re playing at. But I’m not getting involved. She’s tied my hands for a season, but there’s nothing in that sodding contract that says I have to work with
Hermione opens her mouth and closes it again several times like a fish. Harry can practically see all the unasked questions flying around inside her brain fighting to get out first.
It’s too much. Harry standing there in front of him, all expectant and hopeful, having just poured his damn heart out at Draco’s feet. As if Draco’s ever done
He reminds Draco of a cartoon character he’d loved as a child, who’d had a terrible temper and was always surrounded by a tiny thundercloud. It was supposed to be a morality tale, he thinks, looking back. But Draco had always been transfixed by the way the tiny lightning bolts had shot across the page.
“Some of us like to be diligent about our work,” he sniffs, taking a swallow. It produces a delighted peal of laughter from Potter that Draco wishes he could make happen again and again.
?” Her wand hand twitches as if she wants to resume whatever fight Potter might have started in the dream realm. Draco refrains from rolling his eyes.
On Friday it seems harder than usual to get out of bed. He lies there thinking about making a bacon sandwich but he doesn’t have bacon. Or bread. Eventually he pulls on yesterday’s t-shirt and jeans, glaring at the suit hanging in its carrier bag on the back of the door, and walks to the cafe on the corner. The coffee tastes burnt and the bacon has too much fat and the day feels too bright. The sort of sun London is unprepared for at this time of year, people crowded into parks and standing around outside the pub on the corner drinking in the middle of the afternoon.
“Anyway,” Harry goes on, steeling himself for further mockery. “Yes, Draco will be joining us this evening.”
Hermione takes off her pack, but doesn’t make any move to get the teaspoon. “We need to think about this for a second.”
incantation, a silvery arrow firing with unerring accuracy at a nearby tree, dissipating into a cloud of harmless sparks on contact.
Malfoy’s through the Floo and gone before Harry can say anything further, leaving him to head upstairs to bed pondering where he’s going to get mulled wine, a Christmas pudding, and perhaps most crucially, some mistletoe the next day. Harry falls asleep thinking about Christmas lights, the cold sensation of snow under his hand, and Malfoy in one of Molly’s jumpers. It’s the best night’s sleep he’s had all month.
Somehow, in all his agonising over Harry, Draco hadn’t foreseen this particular horror. That he’d just turn up one day and attempt to smooth things over so they could go back to shagging. But it makes an awful kind of sense. Harry’s used to getting things his own way, and if he’s fashioning himself as some sort of transatlantic playboy these days, he’d obviously assume Draco was on board. And the absolute worst of it is that there’s still part of Draco that wants to say
Somehow information has reached the elves that Master Potter intends to take Master Malfoy his morning coffee, because Holber appears out of nowhere, obviously scandalised.
Harry shrugs. “If you mean that ruin in Godric’s Hollow, then it’s sort of academic, isn’t it? Not like I’m going to be living there again.”
Andromeda hugs each of them in turn. “Dinner on Sunday,” she says with a stern expression. “Family dinner is family dinner, with or without Teddy.”
Sandwich Guy—maybe his name is Tom? Harry feels like he knows his name but he’s suddenly not sure that it’s Tom—taps the sandwich on the left. “That’s the BLT, the other one’s the egg and cress.”
“Master Harry’s bed is just upstairs,” she reproaches, twitching her duster at him as he stretches the kinks out of his spine. He tries not to make a habit of it. Sometimes, he just gets lost in his work.
It feels a little bit like a trap, but one that Draco wants to spring now, rather than wait. It’s one thing to have a quickie out the back of a pub. It’s another to put years of animosity behind them. If Potter is going to get high and mighty about Draco’s past, he’d rather get it all out in the open, so he can politely decline this job and get on with his life. He doesn’t
“I’ll be back in a minute,” he says, straightening his jacket and thinking about what he needs to say. “I just need to see Robards.”
“Only me,” Dawlish reiterates, ignoring Harry’s dismissal altogether and folding his note into a crane that quickly swoops away.
“Salazar, Harry, I don’t have time for whatever this is right now. Can’t you just...I don’t know, take whatever revelation you’re having elsewhere and we can discuss it another day.”
behind the pile of riverstones being ransacked by the wealthy witches on the other side of the counter.
“Right,” he says, shaking off the distraction, and settling into his armchair. “We’re leaving Dickensian England behind for something more wondrous.
When he turns back, Harry’s still standing in front of his bag, holding a flat jewellery box in his palm. Lying within, on a bed of red silk, is a medal. His Order of Merlin, First Class, Draco realises with a start. Harry stares at it for what seems like an age, a puzzled expression on his face, before reaching some sort of conclusion and carefully closing the box, stuffing it back deep in his bag. Draco busies himself with putting his own robes on and says nothing.
“It wouldn’t have mattered even if I’d told you the truth, Harry. I knew that you weren’t offering anything more.”
Harry retreats back into his tent, showering quickly, his mind more alert now as he runs over their plans for the day. Hermione decided their most likely point of entry would be the boathouse, where as first years they’d come into the castle under the cliffs for the first time, wide-eyed and wondering.
Hermione seems surprised but returns to her armchair, notebook on her lap. “Do you want to go over your parts of the spells again?”
Harry’s about to interject but then it’s as if Malfoy remembers that Luna is here to help them and he needs to be more polite.
“As I started to understand more about affinal magic, it occurred to me that the patriarchal history of it was artificial. There’s nothing inherently different about a witch’s magic, and no reason why a
. Kreacher has reinstated the Black family bell and expanded the family library. Though Master might not find some of the additional catalogue to his...
Ron looks at Cassie for reassurance, but she just shrugs. “Nothing about this case has been by the book, Ron. I’m not sure why you’d start to worry about that now.”
Downstairs, Kreacher is definitely humming, which Harry suspects has rather a lot to do with Draco’s boots standing neat and shiny by the front door.
Hermione arches an eyebrow and gives him a wry smile. “What, supporting his cousin? Being around children? Christmas in general?”
“No, go ahead. I just want to ask his advice about something.” Harry would far rather confess to his Christmas misfortune with no witnesses if possible.
Harry’s pretty sure that’s not the reward Luna thinks it is, but nods as she drifts from the room humming Deck The Halls under her breath.
knows how you feel about me. But let’s be honest, you haven’t thought any of this through. It’s all very charming when it’s just the Saviour with a little crush, but it’s not like anything
The pub is warm and busy, with groups of people clustered around tables and around the bar. The crowd is younger than Harry was expecting. Two boys who look like they’re still Hogwarts-age walk past him holding hands. The taller one is wearing a t-shirt that reads
Draco turns and surveys the room. “She was always protecting me from him. Right from the start. She made this place so it would be a refuge for me. He thought of child-rearing as beneath him, so she knew he would never come in here. I can actually remember the first time she brought me up, I was really small. Maybe four? One of the elves was waiting — they would always do absolutely anything for her. And when I came in, she cast some enchantment that made all the pictures all over the walls come to life. All my favourite bedtime songs and stories — Babbity Rabbit, the Wizard and the Hopping Pot, the Three Blind Mice—”
Draco laughs. “Come on then, are we going up to show him how we Blacks do things?” The family name is one they use with each other sometimes at home. Teddy had been so delighted when the Grimmauld house magic repaired the embroidery on the family tapestry, and both of their names appeared, stitched together in gold.
“Chessington is expensive,” she explained to him, though afterwards when Draco offered to pay for more children to attend she rolled her eyes at him. “It’s not the money, trust me. You do not want to be in charge of more than six of them at a theme park.”
“Better head back,” he says with a sigh. “Before Malfoy manages to make my team forget there are any rules to Quidditch at all.”
The conversation passes easily without Harry needing to contribute too much, but he knows he’s not doing a very good job at pretending nothing is wrong, because Hermione keeps shooting Ron concerned looks over the top of Rose’s head.
Bill levels a stare at him, and it’s the first time his shiny, professional veneer slips, just for a moment.
He scribbles on the note and sends the owl off with some crumbs of very blackened bacon from the edge of his plate. He pokes at the watery pile of eggs and something that might be kippers, his heart sinking.
It seems like a terrible idea, but it’s been a long time since Draco was someone who avoided his problems, so he Apparates straight to Grimmauld Place and raps on the door. It’s dark blue and very shiny, and he realises absently that Harry must have painted it recently. The knocker is a bright silver, and the mat underfoot is new. He’s just taking in the wrought-iron railings and the freshly dug look of the flowers in the crooked planter box under the window when the door flies open and startles him.
Draco’s mind races, trying to think how to play this out. Perhaps Potter thinks he’s putting his unfortunately first-hand knowledge of the Dark Arts to good use. Potter sets off down a corridor toward the staffroom and so Draco walks with him.
“Inventive,” Draco retorts with a roll of his eyes, which earns him a scowl. “He seemed to be the right age, but I think he was still teaching at Hogwarts. We both were.”
The comparison makes Harry uncomfortable; he feels the back of his neck heat. He looks around at the oppressive walls containing them and prods at the wounds on his hands.
She narrows her eyes and gives him a very calculating smile. “No, Draco said as much. Beholden to a cursed calendar, I hear.”
“We talked about it,” Hermione says, pushing back her own bedclothes and swinging her legs out slowly with a groan. “We worked through a bunch of contingencies yesterday.”
“I swear I wasn’t even close!” Harry insists, though he twitches at his transfigured peacoat all the same, wondering if somehow he’s grown a tail he’s not aware of.
a bit of a shambles, it’s true. Maybe too much for someone like you who needs a lot of order. But you’re so clever and so...” Harry waves a helpless hand at Draco, trying to indicate his whole flawless appearance, “...
Harry clenches his jaw to refrain from commenting on her unwarranted optimism. The book Hermione needs is Rowena Ravenclaw’s diary from the time of the founding of the castle. Hermione’s plans for the ritual have all been based on secondary materials and she’s said from the beginning that she’s certain her calculations are correct, but no self-respecting magical historian is going to proceed without checking their work against the original.
“You know him. Always slightly bent out of shape about something. I don’t think he wants me there but he can’t think of a reason to object, I guess. Striding about like he owns the place.”
Hermione seems to gather herself, drying her eyes and tugging at the sleeves of her shirt to straighten them. “I said I needed to see the place where the castle’s magic began.”
“I doubt it,” he shakes his head. “I don’t think they’d want to be associated with me even to rip me off.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Malfoy sounds irritable. “He must have hit his head. I didn’t see if he was injured, but I assume that’s what your Healers have told you.”
“I thought we were starting over. If we’re going to actually try to work together, the least you can do is use my name.”
“I think her versions are better,” he responds easily, closing his file and resting his chin on his hand with a slightly mournful expression. Harry follows his line of sight to the depressing Christmas tree, still listing unsteadily in its pot. Someone has managed to mute the Wheezes decorations so that they hum quietly. It sounds a little like the hold-music Muggle telephones sometimes make.
The door appears just as it had, and Harry exhales in relief when they let themselves in to find they’re in the right place. The fire is still burning happily in the grate, a feat of magic he has no way of understanding, and it casts warm shadows on the bare walls. He looks up at the Hogwarts crest above the stone mantel and hopes with all his might that they can achieve what they’ve come here to do.
He shoves his chair back abruptly and storms back to the now-empty changing rooms, finding Maxwell’s locker and casting a viciously overpowered
Harry hasn’t experienced anything like the dedication and teamwork that the entire Arrows squad brings together in the days leading up to the final since, well…since the final days of the war.
The big double doors to the Cyprian Youdle Memorial Dining Room are closed, but Parkinson barely pauses, flicking her wand out of the sleeve of her jacket and casting so that they swing back dramatically on squeaking hinges. The twelve owners of the other teams in the League look up in unison, startled. Little fairy cakes and club sandwiches are piled high in the centre of the table, and they look almost comically out of place, as if the very old and very wealthy wizards were playing tea party.
Harry notices the vein standing out on the side of Malfoy’s neck and the way his non-wand hand is trembling slightly at his side. There’s colour high on his cheeks, and his eyes are so bright they might almost be tearing up.
Harry had been expecting Viktor, and so turning to find Draco strolling into the room momentarily startles him stupid. He looks pale and tired, his hair limp, with dark shadows under his eyes. Even the clothes he’s wearing seem completely unlike him. A pair of soft-looking trackpants hang low on his hips and despite his tall frame, he’s almost drowning in one of Viktor’s old team sweaters. And yet even looking so hurt and defeated, he’s impossibly attractive.
Neville sucks in a breath. It is shocking, to see the words in black and white like this. Harry realises that spending the last six weeks living and breathing the maps and the plans has had him thinking about the castle a lot. The idea that it might simply be destroyed is hard to wrap his mind around.
of all things. He’s at a table in the back with Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini and honestly, Harry could be forgiven for never wanting to know that Malfoy looked like that when he laughed. Carefree and happy in a way Harry’s pretty sure he’s
“Well, that was certainly a disturbance,” Malfoy mutters, toeing at a dangerously sharp bit of metal that looks like it had once been the leg of a chair.
“We could go there on the way,” he suggests, but one glance at the clock and Padma assures him they definitely do not have time.
Ron and Cassie join them all in the drawing room after a few minutes and make the very unwelcome announcement that they’d like everyone to remain at the Manor for another night.
The scotch now tastes sour on Harry’s tongue and he pushes the glass away, tossing some Muggle cash down and heading outside as fast as he can. He’s starting to feel like whatever elaborate prank is being played on him may actually succeed in making him crazy after all.
“The thing is, I’ve been having a run of bad luck lately. Just the last two weeks, really.” Harry starts to outline all the things that have gone awry. The way Christmas trees seem to hate him, Floos refuse to behave around him, and he can’t seem to find all of the pieces of his uniform to wear at once.
…for every day Draco is not here at work when he should be, the binding contract he signed is exacting its penalty. And trust me when I say it’s not a penalty you’d wish on Draco whether you currently consider him a friend
Harry is suddenly, viscerally aware of how close they are. His wand is still loose in his hand. Part of him wants to press it to the pale skin of Malfoy’s throat to support his threat. A smaller, more traitorous part of him wants to mark that same skin with his teeth. He glances up to find Malfoy breathing just as heavily, staring at Harry’s mouth.
Potter’s wearing dark jeans that are substantially tighter than any he’d even look at in a store, and his t-shirt hugs his chest in a way that makes Draco feel like there definitely isn’t enough air conditioning in this bloody basement.
Harry drew in a sharp breath, feeling like his view of the world had been twisted and reordered all over again.
“Eleven or so?” says Harry, looking around for a clock but not seeing one up here among the children’s toys. “Maybe time for lunch.”
, we literally just cast Luna’s diagnostic trace. Every person who fell victim to the last spell will show the copper rune. And every person who doesn’t…”
house. Now that the Potter family ring is back on your finger. I must say, you’re coming to it a little late in life, but it’s wonderful to see you shouldering your responsibilities. I’m sure there’ll be a lady wife and children in no time.”
. Draco’s hoping to take the memories out, alright, but he’s not going to put them in a Pensieve. He’s going to use them to plug the holes in the magic of Lily Potter’s ring. The places where
Malfoy is mean and focussed as a coach. Nothing at all like Harry’s own more encouraging, convivial style. He barks orders and yells corrections, swooping into the sky like a maniac and diving down alongside players to demonstrate all the myriad ways they’re doing something wrong.
Obviously, the wedding can’t go ahead, but Harry’s forced to admit to himself that if it did, Malfoy would play the part of the doting husband to a tee. It unsettles him, watching this performance. He’s used to his own far more antagonistic interactions with Malfoy — at least those feel genuine.
They are standing outside Lucius Malfoy’s study. Cassie leans against the hallway wall, one eyebrow slightly raised, her expression one of calm appraisal. Harry and Draco are on either side of Ron, all three considering the magical seal in front of them, the intricate shimmering silver lines interlocking across the door like a grate.
Malfoy looks dumbstruck. It doesn’t seem like an act. Harry realises that he genuinely thought he was telling them the truth. That, until this moment, he believed he was responsible for his father’s death.
at one another. A Beater narrowly misses a glowing red spell, flipping upside down with seconds to spare and still, miraculously, managing to bat away the Bludger. The crowd lets up a cheer in a language Harry doesn’t recognise, and the cheer quickly turns to excited yells as another hex goes wide, striking a wooden sign at the edge of the pitch and causing it to splinter and smoke. The screen goes black.
“There’s nothing to talk about,” he says, squeezing his hand and rolling up onto an elbow so he can lean down and kiss him properly.
It left Harry overwhelmed to see the lights and the tree, feeling a bit the way he had that first Christmas at Hogwarts. And so now each December he leaves the aging elf to it. Even if it means he was kept awake half the night as Kreacher clanked around in the attic above him.
“Tell me about the fight,” Harry says encouragingly. “Draco and his father argued before dinner, or after?”
“What’s this spell of Parkinson’s, cast around midnight?” Harry stares at the incantation. Something about it tickles the back of his brain, as if he’s heard it before, but can’t think where.
For just a second, he recognises the Parkinson he last saw at school, before her face closes in again.
“Any time,” he says, looking wistfully at his overflowing desk and wishing he could stay and dig into the investigation himself. A glance at the clock on the wall snaps him out of it. He has somewhere to be.
A predictable silence follows, while Cassie and Ron absorb this and spin to stare at him, identical looks of confusion and concern on their faces. Harry’s stomach sinks.
They all smile broadly as he ushers them out to the garden. “Come on through, I’m about to make a speech.
"Right,” Ron agrees. “Truth is none of this is quite by the book. If it weren't a holiday weekend we'd have a different team in. Honestly, Harry? I could use your help.”
“A routine investigation,” he goes on, in response to her questioning look. He figures he can leave out the bits about him being suspended and going anyway. They’re not really germane to the story. “Probably someone trying to cause trouble now that Ma...Draco is back.” The name feels thick and unfamiliar in his mouth.
Harry finds himself growling, ready to drop his wand altogether and punch the smug git with his bare hands, but Malfoy quickly deflates, his shoulders sagging.
“How do you even have this?” Hermione asks, passing the notice to Ron, who has reached out and waved a hand for it.
“No, something you normally use while not plugged in, like a … mobile phone. Merlin I’ve clearly had too much wine. My mind feels positively sluggish.”
With the Gillyweed no longer protecting them, Harry feels the cold of the water keenly. They need to get out and get dry. Ahead of them the top steps emerge from the lapping water, meeting the double oak doors to the Castle.
Malfoy asks Hannah, “Is there anything they would do at St Mungo’s to make him more comfortable that you’re not able to do here?”
Harry glances at Luna, nattering away about mushrooms. “He’s been learning so much: it’s fascinating. Did you know Muggle trees are connected, underground, by fungal networks? They use them to talk to one another,” she says. “It’s like magic, really.”
The elves immediately start bringing out endless, lavish courses of food. Harry concentrates on that, rather than the truly bizarre setting. He asks Hermione a question about her recent work on werewolf rights, because he knows that she’ll be happy to talk about it incessantly, and he can nod in all the right places and try to pretend that none of this is really happening.
Luna arrives, wearing a gorgeous pale green gown and a matching leafy brooch. “Can’t be too careful,” she murmurs, tucking another small handful of leaves into one of Harry’s pockets. Ron stations two Aurors at the Floo to cast the diagnostic traces, and she demonstrates to them exactly what they’re looking for. Harry shows the Minister and the other Aurors to the library to wait, checking that Kreacher is under strict instructions to ensure they’re well-fed.
“We’ll start with these,” Malfoy says, tossing leather straps to each player. They stare at them blankly. “They’re wrist holsters,” he explains patiently, pushing back the sleeve of his jacket and extending one tattooed forearm. His own holster is fastened neatly around the neck of an inked green dragon. Harry stares at it, fascinated. The dragon breathes a little puff of smoke towards Malfoy’s palm.
Harry’s always amazed by the matter-of-fact way Luna describes her imprisonment, as if it wasn’t something terrible. Something difficult to recover from.
“Look, Draco, I’m not saying you two are fated to end up together. But I think you have to at least accept that Harry’s around for the long haul. Stop skipping pub nights and avoiding the Burrow and sending Teddy through the Floo by himself just because Harry might be there.”
The bartender looks up as they come in and gives them a broad grin. “There you two are. You’re too pale to have been sunning yourselves in the Med, what on earth have you been up to?”
nice,” Draco says agreeably, taking another sip of wine. Too nice. The idea that there’s a universe in which Potter would invite him to a cottage by the sea for the weekend. Make dinner for his godson, and invite Draco to share it. And then what? How many bedrooms are there in this tiny little place?
“I didn’t,” Harry sighs. “She must have overheard me talking to Bill Cahill after the Tutshill game.”
“That was a while ago. I spent some time coaching kids’ Quodpot. I’m working with an educational programme now for… Muggle-born kids. Getting them ready for school at much younger ages.”
Draco finds himself glancing frequently at Potter, who starts the evening scowling and fidgeting with his cutlery, but gradually relaxes back into his seat, drawn into discussion with those around him. A small smile finally starts to edge up the corners of his mouth. Draco watches as he excuses himself between courses and makes his way out to the loo. His shoulders seem a little less slumped, but Draco is still struck by how wan he looks.
Oliver Wood had a vibrant career for Puddlemere. After he and Harry overlapped for the one season, he went on to lead the team to repeated victories for another eight years before retiring. Quidditch flows in Oliver’s blood though, and he was so bored as a sporting celebrity trotted out for charity dinners that it didn’t take much for Harry to convince him to come lead the Arrows for a season or two. The problem is that he’s impatient, driven, and used to winning. He seems to think the Arrows’ lack of success is simply down to them not working quite as hard as his former teammates. And he has a tendency to point that out a little too frequently.
Malfoy is at Belle’s bedside when Harry arrives. He’s taken off his suit jacket today. Somehow seeing his crisp white shirt sleeves—French cuffs forming sharp lines at his wrists—makes him seem more vulnerable than if his arms had been bare.
“A box of quackers!” Casey announces, snorting to himself and reaching for another mince pie. The staff groan.
“I appreciate you have divided loyalties in this matter,” Mrs Malfoy says primly, her black-gloved hands clasping one another tightly. Harry wonders how much she knows — specifically whether she’s aware her son spent part of last night in Harry’s bed. “But your former colleagues seem to have already settled on my son’s guilt, and I need to do everything I can to ensure he is treated fairly.”
. Hermione is shouldering repeatedly at the closed door to the corridor, as if it should open out when Harry knows it opens in. He can’t see Neville at all.
He shrugs at her, still failing to understand. He supposes this is why she takes the time to explain
Hermione laughs. She gets out her wand and a small grimoire and heads upstairs to start inspecting the wards. Harry goes to find Rose.
“We can’t keep this up much longer!” he yells over his shoulder. “Hermione, you have to find a way to get us out of here!”
“You really think you can tangle up one of my best friends in this awful mess and then just come here...” Harry aims for incredulousness, but the back of his neck is heating up and his grip on his wand tightens.
“You’re ashamed to be seen with me?” Potter smirks. And it is sort of funny. But it’s also not funny at all, because Potter’s just vacationing in this world. He’ll go home and Draco will be the one who has to live with the fallout.
Behind him, he hears Draco swear. “Bugger this.” Harry chances a glance over his shoulder in time to see Draco casting to end the disabling charms on his broom, flexing his arms in relief and rocketing towards Harry. Harry’s too surprised to be outraged. Draco tucks his body tight to the broom, knees in close to his chest, and spirals forward, swinging upside down as he passes over Harry’s head like a Muggle fighter jet, overtaking him cleanly and grabbing the Snitch.
“I mean this with the greatest respect, Hermione. But you have no idea what you’re talking about when it comes to Draco.”
His first night’s sleep is fitful. His bed feels lumpy and uncomfortable and not at all like he remembers.
was thrown around a lot. McFrosty demanded they send you a Patronus immediately, but the two guards were so scared of him neither of them could manage it. So, McFrosty fires
Hermione shakes her head, flipping open a beige folder in the centre of her desk. “Belle Russell. Twenty two years old. Born in Surrey to magical parents, both of whom were killed in the war. No siblings.”
“That’s pretty strange though, isn’t it,” Malfoy points out. “That both Luna and I would have written down that you were having a party.”
The glowing otter isn’t really pulling a face, but Harry feels like it is when it opens its little mouth and yells in Hermione’s voice, “If you send me
“So we use the spiral staircases,” Hermione declares. “At the ends of the floors. It will be fine.” No one else says anything.
Draco feels like he’s choking. Harry will never believe that all of this is a lie. Why should he? No one else
“Hermione can take him,” Harry says with a rush. “It will only—I only need a few minutes, I promise.”
“I’m very happy for you Luna,” Ginny says quietly. “We all deserve to find a little joy in our lives.”
Harry nods, and Rose promptly descends and begins to drag her little temporary step ladder across to the other wall, making a dreadful noise on the floorboards that Harry is sure will send Kreacher into conniptions. He twitches his wand to speed things up.
“Headmistress McGonagall has asked me to come coach at Hogwarts. Seems there’s significant renewed interest in the game and they want someone who can teach the new rules to children safely.”
Hermione wrinkles her nose at the chalkboard decorated with holly leaves. Their usual offerings have been replaced with eggnog lattes and chestnut praline hot chocolates.
The article is just as prurient as you’d expect from Skeeter. He swears that Kyle sodding Travers is the “source close to the couple” who has described their “heated embraces” at the Bent Wand. He’ll hex his ballsack to the floor the next time he sees him. The innuendo is terrible, and it does everything but call them a pair of deviants spitting in the face of the Victory Day celebrations. Draco’s furious. And
Draco fidgets with the menu. He should order something to eat. With these two he always winds up drinking too much. “It’s nothing. The work is interesting. The sex is…” he pauses, wary as ever of giving them anything in the way of ammunition, “…good. I’ll be finished in a couple of weeks, and Harry will be back across the Atlantic where he belongs.”
“Your Floos are working,” Malfoy notes, glaring a little at the fire. “And yet you thought I would still enjoy a walk in this weather.”
to be here,” Parkinson snips. “But the elves refused. Apparently Narcissa insisted we all come down.”
As she stands there, the soot stains begin to retract back on themselves, shrinking in toward the wood. The blackened oak wrinkles and rights itself, becoming smooth and polished again. And then, as if it had never been there at all, the door disappears altogether.
“You were lying?” Nott asks. “So, what now… you’re going to count every cushion and see which one is missing? How does that help anything? You’re still not going to know who did it.”
, he thinks immediately. Because he built himself back up from rock bottom. He’s made a life for himself, even if Ginny doesn’t seem to think much of it. He’s
,” the blonde witch agrees with a sigh. “He looks like someone from a Muggle fashion magazine, but all … buttoned up.” Harry’s definitely met her before. Melissa. Or Melinda? “I’d really like to unbutton him.”
They gather around Ron’s bed as she lifts the stasis, the green field dissipating. Ron blinks and lets out a weak groan.
“I mean, he was obviously a dreadful man,” Zabini points out unnecessarily, tipping a slug of whisky into his coffee. “But I didn’t wish him
“Of course, moments later he let loose a tirade in French so ugly our translation charms bleeped it,” she continues. “But for that brief glorious interlude, he seemed like an actual human being, and not a Venomous Tentacula in the body of a runway model. It was nice.”
In the end, the evening feels like something of an anticlimax. Harry supposes he expected some sort of rousing speech about courage and history and whatnot, rather than yet another recitation of how many pairs of socks they’ll need.
“You misunderstand me, Mr Nightingale. These are not the Arrows’ results. These are the aggregate numbers for the League as a whole.”
It feels a bit pointless. If he opens his eyes he’s only going to have to tell her that he tried his best and failed, and then she’s going to curse him dead where he lies anyway.
Which is how they now find themselves at the International Portkey Station, duffles and training bags looped over their arms, clutching at a battered-looking Muggle hockey stick. Harry stands next to Luna, who’s wearing a bright pink peacoat and a clashing orange knitted hat he’s pretty sure Ron must have made her.
Now, his arrival at Grimmauld Place has him even more confounded than he was at the all-new Leaky. The house is freshly painted, with a shiny red front door and an ornate brass knocker. Harry’s suddenly unsure. Should he knock? Should he have called first? He last spoke to Andromeda a month ago, but it didn’t seem important to trouble her about this trip once he made plans. He’s only going to be here a day or two, at most. He lifts his hand, but almost immediately he feels the wards flex in welcome as the door swings open.
“I’ll throw an apple next time,” Malfoy sneers, taking the remaining steps two at a time without looking back.
She was right, Harry realises. Whatever past versions of Draco they'd seen in the Room of Requirement, they’d never have made it to this point without him here and now.
“Still quite sharp, then. Those Auror spells aren’t up to much,” Ron bites out, his voice quavering.
in his life to deserve such an offering. He thinks if he opens his mouth nothing but broken sobs will come out, so he just sort of lunges at Harry, wrapping his arms around him and burying his face against his neck.
The room is just as dark as the rest of the castle, so they move inside cautiously, their torches aloft and wands out. But as soon as the door clicks softly closed behind them, they’re suddenly blinded by overwhelmingly bright light.
Harry’s not sure what that’s got to do with anything. He’s tried and tried to get Neville to understand he doesn’t have to stay out of a sense of loyalty to Harry, and he—
“No, Harry. Be sensible. You’re suspended because you couldn’t follow protocol if your life depended on it, which it
Ron gives a shrug. “It was still pretty dark. But the moving staircases shifted into position just fine. I walked right up here, no ghosts, no knives.”
“That seems sensible,” Harry nods encouragingly. “And when you were outside the door, could you hear what it was they were fighting about?”
“It’s too much of a coincidence,” Harry argues, annoyed at himself for how unconvincing he sounds. Malfoy is involved somehow. He can feel it with a certainty he can’t explain.
Unbelievably, Draco’s blush only deepens. “How long do you think we need to stay here?” he asks, and his gaze is so heated Harry would happily Side-Along them home right now, but he still has Robards’ words ringing in his ears.
He takes his time in the shower, whistling a tune he doesn’t recognise, and lingers over toast and coffee at the kitchen table. His own face stares back at him from the front page of the
Sure enough, when he digs around among the crates and the dropsheet-covered furniture in one of the dustier, darker corners of the attic, he finds two large cardboard boxes with “XMAS” scrawled across the side. He casts to send them downstairs to the sitting room, figuring he can come up in the daylight and look for other things he might have missed. Sitting nestled in a ratty pile of tinsel inside the first box is a large wooden frame full of tiny, numbered wooden doors. An advent calendar, Harry realises, thinking back to the chocolate ones from Marks & Spencer that Dudley would have devoured before the third of the month, wailing until a replacement was purchased that then quickly suffered the same fate.
They thank the man for his help and head back out to the street. Harry rubs at the back of his neck. There’s a headache building high behind his eyes and staring at this stupid form isn’t helping.
. All I know is that I was foolish enough to suggest to my family that I could host Christmas, something they take
“I know, I know,” he says, getting up and helping her collect and stack the scattered purchases. “I won’t stay. Come with me, for a coffee. I’ll explain.”
At first Harry wonders if Hermione will help him look for answers in the Malfoy library, but thinks better of it given how she’d seemed earlier, and how quick she’d been to jump to conclusions about Malfoy’s guilt.
It was the right decision, leaving. Now he can focus on doing what he does best. Following his gut instinct. Helping people who need it. And there isn’t a single form that needs to be filled out at the end.
Thank you so much for coming with me on this journey over the last twenty five days. It's been such a delight to get your comments on the way through cheering me on to the end. Thank you also to the organisers, particularly sassy-cissa who found all the awesome prompts. And I couldn't have done this without inveigler81 and diligent-thunder, who read every word and gave me the best ideas.
he be like that? Nothing for him has ever lasted. Everyone died, everyone left, every glimmer of hope he had was always snuffed out within hours. He was let down left and right by adults he should have been able to trust. And in the end, he learns that he wasn’t even supposed to survive at all. He was supposed to walk calmly into Death's welcoming arms. So he did.”
The team is almost as delighted as Harry that Draco is back. He makes a big show of being offended by their sentimentality, immediately ordering them up into a truly punishing set of drills, yelling loudly that Harry has let them all go soft, but Harry can tell that underneath it all he’s secretly pleased.
She gives him an indulgent smile. “The language is all agreed, Harry. Stop fretting. You’ll be late for work.” He would argue with her, but she’s right. Time keeps running away on him. The sooner the election is over and he can get some rest, the better.
The little wizard huffs, and then turns around and totters back through the little door behind him. For one terrible moment Harry thinks he’s pushed him too far and the recordkeeper has just abandoned him in protest. But a few minutes later the wizard returns, bearing a giant leather-bound ledger almost as big as himself. He hefts it up onto the counter.
