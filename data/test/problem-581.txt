As Draco held little Rose in his arms, he indulged in the luxurious fantasy of daydreaming that the tiny, bright-eyed girl was his.
Admittedly, Harriet almost thought she was in heat the next morning, when she woke up cuddled so closely to Draco in their cozy, temporary home.
“Right, then!” Dr. Krause said cheerily as she picked up a small device, which was connected to the machine by a grey, rope-looking object, “Let’s have a look, shall we?”
Draco silently admired his wife for a moment. He watched the light in the bathroom glint off of her head and highlight the colors of amber and red that made up her hair.
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
She remembered feeling exactly like that as the nurses had helped her onto the bed to deliver Scorpius.
When she looked over at him, she wasn’t sure whether to laugh or cry at the look of grave concern on his face.
With a hateful snarl, Draco sneered at the receptionist before he dashed towards the Auror secretary.
“No.” Draco hissed in an irritated tone, vexed that the man had spoken and interrupted his special second with Harriet, “No rings.”
He deftly moved so that Harriet’s hips were directly over his as he sat up in bed and held her delicately in his strong hands.
“Dobby is so happy to see Harry Potter again, sir!” The house elf declared joyously as Harry carried little Scorpius into the large Malfoy kitchen to make them both breakfast.
Narcissa sat beside Lucius and she sought to ease some of the tension as she spoke to Harriet, “Draco told me that you two bought some things for the baby.”
Harriet folded the baby’s clothes again, Harriet rearranged the plush toys and restacked the bins that were already in straight rows.
Freed from his father’s disruptive commentary about his life, his choices, and his mistakes, Draco smirked at himself in the mirror.
“Hello there!” A friendly woman behind the counter chirped at Harriet as she stepped inside the shop, “How can I help you, Miss?”
“Don’t you think it’s about time?” Lucius asked sharply as his grey eyes narrowed disapprovingly at what he could see of Harriet’s belly over the table.
Draco’s handsome face was still twisted as he snapped back, “-She can, actually. My mate is more than capable of seeing to our son’s needs. Stand back, both of you! If she needs your help, she’ll ask for it!”
As every man in his position feared, Draco numbly considered what would happen if things didn’t go as well as he hoped, if Harriet rejected him and refused to be his bride.
Nothing harmful, of course, but the use of magic would bring the need for more magic to cover his tracks and Draco would prefer a simpler resolution.
As Harriet pulled away from Draco’s kiss and smiled while he laid his forehead against hers, she felt a deep peace wash over her that she had never known before, not even after winning the final battle against Voldemort.
Harriet glanced over at Draco and she smirked victoriously when she saw that his frown had disappeared.
“Now, then, Miss Potter, let’s help you become Mrs. Malfoy, shall we?” The man asked as he turned to Harriet, “Repeat after me, “I, Harriet Potter……”
She understood then that the woman behind the counter wasn’t just a clerk, she was a…..a photographer.
Later, when Harriet finally opened her green eyes and blinked up Draco from where she lay on his chest, he smiled gently.
She shivered when she felt his hot breath strike her skin in just the right way, contrasting sharply with the cold, morning air.
Draco nodded. As they sat together, he didn’t mention anything else about the clerk or Harriet’s tears, in an effort to protect his mate’s pride.
Draco cracked one of his signature smirks at Harriet and she grit her teeth in vexation. Since the day they had met when they were children, Draco’s smirks had made her oscillate between wanting to slap him and kiss him at the same time.
As the afternoon gradually passed, Harriet and Draco sat on the Weasley’s sofa and sipped their tea while they chatted with the hosting couple.
It didn’t matter, though, even if Draco had noticed the faint marks that lined her belly or the way her hips had spread ever so slightly, which he inevitably would at some point, he would have embraced and adored each and every change.
“The chances of my son or daughter being born a squib are very low.” Draco said seriously, “When they’re young, if they grow up in a muggle family, their talents will be frightening and confusing. Have you forgotten that even in a muggle household, the Hogwarts letter will still come, right?”
That simple phrase hurt Draco more than any curse ever could, but he swallowed his tears and held his heart high.
Draco thought their innumerable amorous frolics should have been more than sufficient to launch them along the road to parenthood.
“To work, Draco.” Harriet replied with a shrug, “I’m already an hour late! They’re going to sack me if I don’t hurry.”
The uncharacteristic animosity in her voice finally got her alpha’s attention as Draco looked over at her and scowled, “What, Potter?! Can’t you see I’m trying to get this finished?!”
The fact that his journey brought him directly face to face with an apartment door in Hogsmeade which he assumed belonged to Harriet should have been proof of enough of his paternity.
Her pink lips seemed so kissable that Draco smiled bittersweetly at the barrier that existed between them.
Draco laughed and he looked up at Harriet with a bittersweet grin, “Have you gone mad? ‘A farm and everything’? Isn’t that what people do with dogs? Consign them to farms?”
Harriet groaned in displeasure and rustled around in the covers for a moment before she cracked her eyes open and blinked at her husband sitting at her side with their two tiny girls.
As he watched, Draco’s manhood twitched almost painfully in his trousers when Harriet’s cleavage bounced tantalizingly as she pulled the fabric of her dress so she could fasten her buttons.
“Everything alright, Malfoy?” Ron asked as both alphas stood on the cottage’s small porch and stared out into the distance.
Harriet shrugged her robes around herself, trying to hide her changed figure in the heavy volumes of fabric.
“You’ve done so well.” Draco said proudly as he sat back and smiled while he admired the sublime scene of his beloved mate feeding their little one.
The happy, soft smile that he found on her pink lip sent an unexpected pang of arousal coursing through his body as he felt himself start to grow agitated with need.
Harriet took a breath as his elegant, skillful hands slid around her waist and from there, began to trace over her curves.
Draco smirked at his mate when he heard her back down from her stubborn stance and willingly acknowledge the fact that a break from the stress of her career had been needed.
They were careful to keep their voices hushed and their steps quiet so they wouldn’t wake their little boy, but Harriet and Draco walked over to the canopy bed that held their nest and together, they snuggled under the multitude of blankets.
Unlike the weaker alphas that he and Harriet had as classmates, Draco had never looked away from the screen during the visual aid part of their classes.
Draco’s kiss was no longer sweet, it was deep and dangerous, and as he sucked on her bottom lip for a moment, Harriet found her mind going into all sorts of lascivious directions, until he pulled away with a gentle, teasing bite~.
In the two weeks that led up to the Malfoys’ tea date with the Weasleys, Draco’s quest for a baby crescendoed into an outright obsession.
“Thank you, Hermione.” Harriet said as she clutched her friend’s hand in her free one, “Thank you so much for being here…..and…...the basket….and…...everything! Thank you!”
As her irritation rose with her pain level, she was very grateful to be there, in her home, in her nest, not on some unfamiliar hospital bed with bright lights glaring down in her face while strangers surrounded her and stared at her most private bits.
Draco took Harriet’s hand out of instinct. He was trying to protect his omega from an environment which he deemed hostile and dangerous.
Draco frowned and kept his brooding stare at nothing as Ron added, “You need to stop putting so much pressure on her, mate. She loves you, you know?”
After a day of babies, cake, toys, and mingling with guests, Narcissa thoughtfully took over Scorpius’s bedtime routine and let the tired parents go to their room early to get a good night’s rest.
She assumed that the box was what Draco had referred to, it had to be, it was the only box in the room…….
The midwife answered the lengthy list of questions that Draco had already managed to compile and then she took her leave.
“Yes.” Harriet admitted with a blush, “He does, indeed. He’s been very lovely and very gentle. I wanted to do something nice for him.”
The spell could only be performed with unmanipulated and unadulterated free will. Harriet utilized it as a way to let her friends know she wasn’t acting under the imperius curse or any other forced means of action.
When Harriet was finally able to purchase her completed pictures, it was all she could do to manage leaving her nest long enough to venture out and complete her transaction.
Draco carried his little ones out of their nursery and across the hall. He mumbled under his breath and handlessly opened the door to his and Harriet’s bedroom.
The island served only the most wealthy patrons and as part of the luxurious services the remote resort offered, there were plenty of nannies available for childcare.
Instead, Narcissa thought about the probable results from her son’s actions, and that put a smile on her face.
Draco didn’t seem to be in much of a rush as he laid in bed and watched Harriet strip down to change her clothes.
One rainy afternoon, with Harriet’s permission, the photographer Draco had hired arrived at the grand estate and the young family of three posed for him to capture their likeness.
If Harriet continued to be that stubborn about everything, it was going to be a very long nine months.
Harriet and her mother-in-law insisted on dressing the Malfoy twins in fluffy, frilly outfits, but Draco didn’t mind.
Draco’s gesture was loving and sweet, but Harriet would have much rather had him place his lips elsewhere on her.
They whispered greetings to the couple and Draco helped Harriet to sit up with a groan. As she clutched onto him, he gently parted her legs so the two female healthcare workers could perform their exam.
One of the reporters accidentally showed Draco and Harriet a small mercy. The man was clumsy enough to drop his camera. He shouted in horror as it crashed to the floor and the glass lense shattered on the cold stone.
Working in the capacity that he did, the officiant knew when he saw a bride and groom truly in love.
The alpha felt pride swell in his heart as he looked down at his tiny son and admired his chubby little cheeks and the fluffy tufts of platinum blonde hair that lined his head.
The air between Draco and Harriet filled with icy tension as she dressed, washed up, and apparated off to work.
When the Malfoy family was left standing alone in their elegant dining room, Narcissa frowned and glanced worriedly between her warring husband and son.
Later in the day, Ron and Hermione arrived at the Malfoy’s flat to collect little Rose. A part of Harriet was worried that Draco wasn’t going to return the baby to her parents.
The preparations had been overwhelming for her too, yes, but Harriet wasn’t angry at Lucius or Narcissa over it all.
“I…..I suppose I’d better go check on him first.” Harriet said as she too left her seat and scurried out of the room.
A part of Harriet was foolishly worried that her friends may resent her son or daughter due to their paternity, but as Hermione gazed down at Harriet’s son and he gazed at her with his adorable, huge eyes, a warm, genuine smile lit up her face.
Harriet scowled as she heard that odd sound once more from one of the bedrooms that was close to hers and Draco’s.
The Slytherin princess hadn’t been watching the clock and so, she didn’t panic when another pain hit her middle, as sharp and as sudden as the last.
Harriet’s bold attitude fell away as her alpha’s arousal ground into her bottom cheek. She turned her head and they both abandoned their battle as their lips locked together.
Since she had reached the final weeks before their baby’s arrival, Harriet didn’t have the energy or the desire to do much besides curl around her belly and lay in her nest.
“I was disappointed.” Draco revealed, “I thought that you felt the same….spark...that night. I was expecting to wake up beside you and show you what a day being a Malfoy is like, but you were already gone……...Why? You didn’t have to do this on your own, you know.”
Harriet didn’t look up at Draco. She didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing the smirk that slipped across her lips.
“Biscuits and quail make him that happy?” Lucius asked sarcastically as his eyes scanned over the food on the table.
A smirk danced across his face as Harriet let out an exasperated sigh and he dared to plant sweet kisses along her jawline.
There were several paintings on those walls that captured the likeness of Malfoys who had lived before cameras were in existence.
The first female Malfoy in generations had green-eyes and a bright smile as she joined her older brother, who had celebrated his first birthday only a few months prior.
The thought amused Draco, that he and Harriet had mated and had their first child together, but that evening was their first actual date.
She sighed as she pulled herself up, using Draco as a crutch, until she was sitting on her bottom in the middle of the bed…...the bed which served its true purpose to Draco’s omega once more.
She didn’t appreciate that her alpha was silently trying to guilt her into scaling back her hectic schedule.
Draco was half sitting on the bed beside his mate, looking down over his love and their baby, and half ready to pounce on anyone who came too close that he didn’t approve of.
Lucius and Narcissa looked on in horror as their son removed the knowledge of his impending fatherhood from each of the reporters’ minds.
Draco Malfoy was always deeply offended when he didn’t get his way, but this was different. This time, his wealth and status didn’t guarantee him a solution. Although Draco’s father had clearly heard about his current plight, nothing had changed.
Draco didn’t hesitate to immediately press against her. The head of his arousal ground obscenely against her plump bottom cheek as he leaned down to his in her ear, “This is how you want me, Potter? Like a bloody animal?”
It was a small group, composed of only Lucius, Narcissa, Ron, and Hermione, but Draco had been assured by his mate’s friends that that's the way Harriet would prefer it.
Draco wasn’t foolish enough to believe that Lucius would pay him any kind of compliment, that wasn’t going to happen.
Harriet ended up sitting on the side of the bed, with her legs dangling down towards the floor while she groaned through another pain.
In the aftermath of destruction and pain, hate had blossomed into something entirely different between the two former enemies. Not long after, the handsome, platinum-haired alpha had happily claimed the last surviving Potter as his mate the day that he took her as his wife in a lavish ceremony in front of hundreds of guests.
Harriet was glad that her other best friend was finally being introduced to her son, but Hermione was busy admiring how handsome Ron looked holding a baby~.
Narcissa, on the other hand, reminded Harriet of an elegant spider. The Malfoy matriarch looked at the Potter omega like she was going to eat her.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
She had heard plenty of stories about what omegas endured, but she wasn’t entirely certain about what to expect.
Regardless, amidst the publicity frenzy over the Malfoy bombshell, Harriet and her alpha faced a daunting task.
Draco was very displeased that apparently, the two of them had differing ideas on when exactly that time would begin.
Why wouldn’t people be interested in knowing about his tortuous path to win over his beautiful omega and keep his adorable son?
As long as Harriet had her beloved Draco as her alpha, her husband, and her lover, her hair would stay messy and her cheeks would stay pink, no rogue required~.
“Wonderful.” Narcissa replied with a smirk that was reminiscent of Draco’s, “He’s going to have the best engagement party ever.”
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
A spoiled only child, Draco Malfoy was not used to being denied what he wanted, and what he wanted was for Harriet to return his feelings, acknowledge the fact that they were mates, and let him be a part of his child’s life.
A pained look crossed Draco’s face for a split second and then he forced a snide grin on to his lips as he stealthily placed the box back in its original storage place without her notice.
Even though he had only seen her naked once before, he remembered every inch of her, every line, every freckle…...
It wasn’t that Harriet found her husband’s angst funny. What Harriet found funny was the way that Draco insisted on pouting.
Together, the Malfoy family walked away from the platform, wondering what adventures Scorpius would have at Hogwarts and what great things he would grow to do.
“Draco, we need to get the healer and the midwife.” Narcissa said with a quiet urgency to her voice. Draco recognized his mother’s tone well, it was the same one she had always used whenever he had been sick as a child.
Hermione and Narcissa looked on while Draco sat on the edge of the nest and reached out to touch the baby’s little hand that poked out over the blanket in which he was swaddled.
The worry was still on Draco’s face as he watched his omega cuddle against him and close her eyes very tightly as if she were trying to escape from some disturbing mental image.
Of course the Potter omega had always smelled lovely to the Malfoy alpha, but when Draco opened his eyes that particular morning, he was positive that he was no longer in his own room.
“Not for much longer.” Draco replied. His statement would have usually come with an arrogant smirk but the reality of the situation painted a very serious look on his face instead.
With a gentle purr, he lifted the soft blankets of the nest that he and Harriet were enveloped in and he tenderly cuddled against her.
“There, there, Potter…...there, there, I’m here….alpha’s here~.” Draco whispered soothingly to Harriet as he walked over and wrapped his arms comfortingly around her.
Inside the tangled mess of covers, Draco could just barely see Harriet’s head poking out. He smiled softly when he heard her gentle, rhythmic breathing.
When she needed Draco, he held her, when she was in pain, he comforted her, when she was hungry, he fed her whatever she asked for.
With his mother, Hermione, the midwife, and the healer waiting outside, Draco was finally free to see to Harriet’s needs.
Harriet grabbed him to pull him down beside her, but he caught her hand and replied, “I’ll be in soon, I have a bit of reading to do first.”
“I’m not making you beg for anything, Draco.” Harriet snapped, “We both agreed that we weren’t going to have children. You only want a baby because you think it’s a doll you can play with and then when you get bored with it, you can put it on a shelf.”
Draco kept his scowl as he watched his little boy huff in such exasperation that his small shoulders rose and fell dramatically as he stomped towards his father.
Besides her neediness, Draco was enraptured by the fullness of her curves and the sweet, pleasant blush to her complexion that she kept every day that she carried their son or daughter.
“No, I…..I need to be excused. Pardon me.” Draco murmured under his breath as he laid one hand on his chest and rose from his seat.
Draco had his eyes squinted and his hand outstretched. He was going to catch it, he was going to catch the snitch, end the game, and win himself a baby.
“I hope it’s still here, anyway.” She mused as she led Draco by the hand down to the end of the street.
“No.” Draco laughed as he glanced over at Harriet, “I want children because I’m an alpha and alphas want pups. Looking after Rose here has only been a grim reminder that I don’t have any of my own. Honestly,” Draco chuckled as he grinned over at Harriet, “Do you expect me to believe that seeing me like this is doing nothing to your ovaries right now, omega?”
He had to corral his parents and get them to understand some basic principles about his situation, regardless of what they wanted it to be.
Harriet’s robes did an excellent job of hiding her condition, but as she turned, with her hand pressed on her middle, Draco saw the outline of her new curves.
Draco kissed down her jaw line and opened his mouth to clamp down on the sensitive, inner area of Harriet’s neck and shoulder.
The discomfort built to such a degree that a small whimper escaped Harriet’s lips before she could stop it and the sound caught the attention of Narcissa, who was passing by Draco’s door on her way to breakfast.
Her eyes widened as he latched onto one of her tight nipples and began to suckle greedily. Harriet instinctively spread her thighs and the readiness of her wet center allowed him to all but slip in, despite his adequate size.
Draco brought Harriet every letter as soon as the owl landed on the window sill, but Harriet neglected to answer. As the days passed, she even began asking Draco to open them and read them to her, which he gladly did.
Her lips threatened to turn into a frown when a painful stab of sadness hit her squarely in the heart during her musings.
“I’ll break the lease, don’t worry about that……..Tell everyone you’re going on holiday abroad and you’re not sure when you’ll be back.” Draco shrugged.
She didn’t even have any difficult assignments at work, but she started and ended each day feeling drained.
Even under the blanket of evening stars, the stark beauty of nothing but the calm, black sea and the gentle glow of the moon was breathtaking,
That didn’t matter. Sharing a kiss with his beloved after months of bitter parting was incredible enough. Draco felt like he may actually have a chance of breaking through the icy walls around Harriet’s stubborn heart.
Every night, while Harriet snoozed in her cozy little nest composed of Draco’s scent, he laid awake on the opposite end of the hallway, wishing that he could hold her close instead of a pillow.
Draco lay back against the pillows and Harriet put her head down on his chest. She continued to weep softly while he tenderly stroked her hair and kissed the top of her head.
The overpowering beauty of the ocean and the sky placed them in a stark yet comforting void that made Siren’s Slip seem like the true world and everything else seem false.
Draco’s eyes narrowed to slits as he looked at Lucius and replied, “Have you lost your hearing, Father?”
As she changed, she felt Draco’s grey eyes watch her every movement and her heart fluttered in her chest.
“That’s more than apparent, Potter.” Draco hissed. He was so preoccupied drinking in the sight of her body that his eyes never traveled up to her face. Draco was enraptured by how beautiful Harriet looked. Her fair face was framed by her long tresses, all the color of dark, burning embers. Her green eyes glowed at him, along with her cheeks, radiant with the promise of the new life she carried.
Finally, the live band in the corner of the massive room began to play their music and everyone quieted in preparation for the bride’s appearance.
“Someone help me get her to St. Mungo’s!” One of the secretaries called out as she wrapped her arm around the unconscious omega.
Among the papers were advertisements for Hogwarts and several other elite, magical education institutions, some that even offered graduate programs.
Harriet stood beside her alpha while they gazed over the magical pictures that had been laid out across the dining table while Scorpius cuddled against his mother and cooed softly.
“I can do this on my own, you know.” Harriet said one morning, towards the end of her cycle, when Draco had continued to stay home from work with her, even though her immediate need for him had passed.
When the morning of the alumni game arrived, Harriet felt like she was sixteen again as she pulled on her old quidditch uniform and retrieved her Firebolt from storage.
It was convenient for Draco that he had parents who were so willing to help, because most of his attention had to be focused on Harriet.
She tasted sweet and addictive and lovely and suddenly all of his rational thoughts turned to an incoherent jumble of fragments inside his brain.
“Draco, love, what’s wrong? Do you feel alright?” Narcissa asked worriedly when the blonde dropped his fork and by doing so, attracted the attention of everyone at the table, including little Scorpius, who blinked at his father from his ebony high chair.
As Draco ordered a coffee and Harriet ordered a hot chocolate, he narrowed his eyes while he started to plan.
“As am I.” Draco agreed as he turned and pecked Harriet’s cheek, earning a laugh from his wife when Lily made a noise of disgust at the sight and the sound.
Despite Draco’s tender attention, Harriet couldn’t hold back the moans and whimpers that left her throat.
With a scowl marring his handsome face, Draco deftly slipped out from under Harriet and pulled on his green velvet sleeping robe.
Draco had been away for the past three days on a business trip with Lucius and for that, she was glad.
“I’m the mother.” Harriet snapped, snatching the photograph out of Draco’s hands, “It’s my choice, Malfoy.”
Draco looked down in the witch’s arms and he noticed she was holding a basket filled with small toys and toiletries for the baby.
“You’re being sued for paternity by a…...Draco Smith? He claims to be the father of your child. He’s asking for a definitive test and it seems the court has already granted him an order to have it performed. If he can prove the child is his and the court deems him a fit parent, then I’m terribly sorry, Miss Potter, but the Roberts family won’t be able to adopt your baby.”
Draco continued to oversee Harriet’s care, which included daily exams from the healer, proper nutrition, ample fluid intake, and an adequate sleep schedule.
From the way his brow was furrowed to his grey eyes that threatened to fill with tears of disappointment, the pout on Draco’s lips made it obvious.
It was a bit awkward between the mother and father-to-be at first, but after breezing through several shops, they were pleasantly surprised.
Neither Harriet nor Draco heard the couple allow the reporters from the Daily Prophet to enter the house and set up all of their cameras and media equipment in the Malfoy dining room.
A moment passed and Draco kissed Harriet reassuringly until the midwife interrupted again and asked the couple, “Would you two like to know the sex?”
Harriet didn’t break their kiss while she reached between them and vanished her undergarment with a murmur.
It slightly annoyed him that he had to do so at all, though, hadn’t his actions so far proven to her the true desires of his heart?
Draco stepped forward to gaze out of the glass and he blinked at the private infinity pool outside that looked as if it’s waters could effortlessly spill out into the sea.
Harriet started to pant for breath as she began to bounce on top of him. Through clenched teeth, Draco forced his words out in a husky growl, “If Slytherin wins…...when Slytherin wins…..I’m going to knock you off your broom and put a baby in you right on the quidditch field…….in front of the whole crowd. Do you hear me, Potter?”
“Then…..I can…..I can build a piece suited to whatever needs you seek to meet, sir.” The jewelry salesman offered, desperate to gain some of the Malfoy family’s gold.
The next sentence from the Malfoy heir’s mouth shocked his parents more than anything else he had told them that night. Out of anyone he could have named, neither Lucius nor Narcissa expected Draco to look at them and say, “Potter…….My omega is Harriet Potter.”
“You’ve known about his impending arrival for how many months and you haven’t chosen a name?” Lucius scoffed, “Your mother and I had yours selected before her belly had rounded. Draco, after the dragon. A proper name for a Malfoy.”
Since Draco had watched several educational videos, he had seen enough that he had become familiar with the concept of muggle television.
As the server stepped to the side, Ron and Hermione both stared down at the blonde alpha who was seated at the old, wooden table.
When she and Draco heard only shuffling from the other side, the secretary gently turned the knob and cracked the door open.
Snuggly, soft, and sweet, with Draco’s blonde hair and Harriet’s friendly disposition, the secret Malfoy effortlessly charmed his way into the heart of each person that he met.
As the hours passed and morning drifted into afternoon, the option of sleeping through the contractions disappeared for Harriet.
“We can’t stay gone!” Harriet laughed in exasperation, “Your mother has at least three different cake tasting appointments for us tomorrow! We can’t just disappear!”
Draco stepped back and Harriet slipped into a pair of black shoes before she quickly scurried over to hold Draco’s hand.
Before he could control his hands, he placed his open palms possessively over his mate and Harriet sighed at the sensation as she scooted herself up and let Draco nuzzle her soft mounds.
“Hello.” Harriet murmured, barely stopping as she swished past him and made her way towards the door.
He wouldn’t even let Harriet walk. Instead, he insisted on carrying her while he apparated them back to Malfoy manor and carefully tucked his omega into her nest.
Despite her previous reluctance, Draco’s omega understood that the fact she had birthed his son would become public knowledge at some point, with or without her consent.
Instead, she cleared her throat and put on her outfit for the day, brushed her hair, and prepared herself for the slew of meetings and testings that would come too soon.
That had been nearly four weeks ago and since another of Harriet’s heats had concluded without resulting in a pregnancy, she was very anxious to get her alpha away from the ugly reality they faced.
He blinked up at Draco curiously as if he were trying to determine whether his father’s claim was legitimate or not.
When Draco noticed Harriet’s eyes welling with tears, he grabbed her hand and led her quickly out of the shop.
Ron would have been lying if he said he didn’t enjoy the look of utter defeat on Draco’s face, but he remembered Harriet and that’s what stopped him from smirking in triumph.
After her little digestive system righted itself at last, Harriet changed her one more time, dressed her in clean clothes, and laid her against her chest.
As Harriet entered her seventh week, she didn’t understand what all of the excitement was about with pregnancy.
Lucius Malfoy would never admit it, but he had seen the head and the arm of his grandchild as well as his wife.
“No………” Harriet replied with a saddened sigh of acceptance, “There’s nothing you can do at all to help me, Draco.”
After the Malfoys’ tea with Ron and Hermione, Harriet had taken her friends’ advice. With the help of a traveling planner who worked in the wizarding world, Harriet had arranged a romantic, stress-free vacation for herself and Draco.
From the look on Draco’s face, she worried for a moment that he would climax from her statement alone.
“I give you my body, Harriet Potter.” Draco repeated, and as he did, his grey eyes shimmered at Harriet in the moonlight and she grinned.
When the next contraction crashed into her, Draco couldn’t continue to voice her concern to Harry. Falling dead weight onto her knees, Harry’s expression of happy excitement turned serious when Draco leaned forward and retched all over the floor.
Harriet noticed that Hermione had let go of her and Narcissa had stopped rubbing her back as their attention became focused on something other than her.
Narcissa held up a hand and her spouse fell silent, “She is now, Lucius, and she will be forever, whether she likes it or not. Sit down. I’m going to go and collect the children.”
She could no longer have a simple conversation with Draco, all he wanted to talk about was the baby.
“Go ahead and get comfortable for me, dear.” The woman said with a smile, “We’ll choose your outfits, then I’ll help position you a bit.”
Part of Harriet had wondered if Draco would really see his wish through after her pregnancy ended and the real work began.
Harriet saw a muggle car parked by the side of the road on the outer edge of the land behind the waterfall. She watched blankly as the man walked towards it for a moment before she turned to Draco and cried, “Are you mad?!”
Harriet thought Draco’s hunger that night was because he had missed their intimacy, that must have been why he clung to her so desperately, that must have been why he kissed her so ravenously.
As Harriet began to zoom around the stadium, she gripped her broom with white knuckles. A strangled gasp escaped her lips as she narrowly avoided a raging bludger by dodging out of the way just before it slammed into her face.
It was a well set trap, Draco had to admit that. Whether his mother and father had laid it on purpose or they had simply misunderstood his current stance with his lover, he didn’t know.
The all-inclusive resort had seen to it that their guests needn’t leave the privacy of their exclusive quarters to have quality meals. All Harriet or Draco had to do was tap their wands on the kitchen counter and under the bungalow’s enchantment, whatever they wanted to eat appeared on plates, in bowls, and in cups, ready to be consumed.
He couldn’t detect it in his mate’s scent, but as he walked over, slid into the nest beside her, and held her in his arms, he could feel it…….something was very, very wrong.
“As you wish, Mrs. Malfoy.” The midwife nodded, “Allow me to prepare your paperwork from today’s visit, then you and your husband will be free to go.”
All Harriet could really hear was the blood pulsating in her own ears as she took a deep breath and bore down again.
He found himself temporarily distracted when his grey eyes roamed over Harriet’s appealing curves while she battled to stretch the tight fabric of her dress over her body.
She was very pleased with how suddenly accepting Draco seemed of the muggle world. The pregnancy hormones flooding her veins were suppressing any suspicion she may otherwise have held about his eagerness.
Harry kept glancing over at his wife while he dressed for the day. As a well-established healer that worked at St. Mungo’s himself, Harry wasn’t the least bit nervous about the birth of his second child, but he wished Draco would hurry up.
Draco covered Harriet in kisses and saw that his mate had all the tea and witch hazel-soaked pads that she needed to aid in her postpartum recovery, but Harriet had it easy compared to most new mothers.
“I beg your pardon, sir.” The receptionist replied as she blinked up at Draco over her glasses, “......But first you’ll need to tell me who your wife is.”
Instead, he pulled a very old volume from the ebony shelf and opened it up. He scowled in concentration as he skimmed over its pages.
Really, based off Rose’s current appearance, since she lacked Hermione or Ron’s hair, her parents could have been several people…...her mother could have even been Harriet~.
Harriet had been very glad when her old broomstick, given to her by her late godfather, had been recovered after the war.
Harriet struggled against the tears that welled in her eyes as she walked back into her small living room. Sitting down on the sofa, she placed a hand to her face for a moment and tried to forget Draco’s pleading words.
“I now pronounce you, man and wife.” The man declared quietly, hoping not to break the reverence between the newlyweds, “You may kiss and make your union known.”
Those were the lies that Harriet constantly told herself when she knew deep down inside that she had no intention of taking time off or a leave of absence until the birth.
There was something boldly alluring to him about it all, besides the beauty of his mate in those frames.
Harriet’s walls gripped onto him like a vice. While Draco was drowning in her, Harriet’s eyes were closed as she let herself surrender to the bliss that came with being filled by her alpha after spending the entire day craving Draco.
The alpha sought to give his darling a peaceful place to labor in, and so, after he closed the curtains and made sure the room was warm but not too warm, he crawled into the nest and cuddled Harriet up with him.

By the time she had the baby bundled into a blanket, Draco was waiting anxiously with his arms outstretched.
Finished with his teasing, on edge with the urgency of his own need, Draco moved up and bent his head to kiss Harriet’s lips once more as he purred, “Tell me how you want me, love~. I’m not the one with child.”
“I hope I’m not interrupting, sweetheart.” Narcissa said to her son, glancing behind him suspiciously at the rumpled covers on his bed.
As they both found their pleasure, Harriet still had her legs wrapped around Draco and she squeezed him tightly with her thighs when he neglected to leave her.
Harriet moved away from the mirror and entered an empty stall. Instead of swallowing any of the pills, Harriet let them fall from her hand into the toilet, which she promptly flushed.
Undeterred, Draco pressed his forehead against hers and whispered, “I know that you care for me too….and our little one.” His gentle voice was even softer as he splayed both of his hands over Harriet’s tummy that proudly protruded between them, “We can live every day like this, you and I…..and our son or daughter. No more wars, no more pain, no more-“
A proud grin spread across Draco’s pale face as he pulled the covers over them both and let Harriet stay nestled against him while he closed his eyes as well.
The couple had retreated to their flat the night before. Draco watched as Harriet rushed around to make herself decent for the momentary arrival of their guests.
Draco’s grey eyes widened as he looked on in disbelieving horror while the on-screen muggle doctor grasped a scalpel and slit the woman’s abdomen in a motion that was eerily smooth.
The baby girls giggled at Draco and he smirked as he picked them both up. He held Lily in one arm and Narcissa in the other.
With an exasperated sigh, Draco placed a piece of parchment down on his desk and picked up a quill. He glanced up and saw that the enchanted owl he employed to carry his daily message to Harriet was already waiting outside on the roof of the manor.
“Nine weeks is practically tomorrow!” Draco exclaimed in a terrified tone as he looked down at Harriet.
“Yes, my letters. I have a hunch that you’ve received at least some of them.” Draco said suspiciously as his grey eyes flickered back down to her belly.
Draco’s son had settled into a nightly rhythm, he only woke twice from the time he fell asleep until the morning, which Harriet tried not to begrudge.
The elevator doors opened and Harriet stepped out, but behind her, Draco clutched onto the machine’s walls with his arms spread and his grey eyes wide.
As he thought to himself, Draco felt fear stir in his heart and he looked over at Harriet as she lay slumbering in her nest.
“Correct as always, Granger.” Draco said with a taunting smirk as his eyes flickered between Ron and Hermione, “Of course I would have brought Harriet, if I wasn’t intending to speak about her with you two. What we’re about to discuss is not to leave this table, is that understood?”
“Is it because you still haven’t come to terms with the fact that you’ve mated with a Malfoy?” Draco sneered.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
In that moment, Draco despised those stupid muggle classes. With what Harriet faced in that brutal contraction, “breathe” was a flimsy defense.
Mr. Roberts thought that the man in front of him was expressing his disappointment, but really Draco was already starting to feel guilty about what he was preparing to do.
The woman working at the reception desk sniffed at Draco’s threat and combed through her records for a moment before she looked up at Draco and adjusted her glasses.
Draco and Lucius glared at each other for a tense moment before Lucius retorted, “I’ve never seen a man who claimed to be so in love look so dreadfully dismal.”
“Well? What are you standing there for? Hurry up! My distraction won’t last forever. Open that box there and put on your dress. Be quick about it, will you?” Draco huffed.
That particular evening, Draco had barely been paying attention to Lucius’s stern voice as the eldest Malfoy droned on and on.
“She’s still being examined by one of our midwives, but yes, Mr. Malfoy, she’s awake and you can join her.” The healer nodded.
The smile that brightened Harriet’s face warmed Draco’s heart and he struggled not to purr at the look of happiness in her eyes.
“You can’t feel anything yet, Draco.” Harriet chided while she let her fingers comb through his blonde hair.
Draco’s heart leapt in his chest when instead of pushing him away again, Harriet placed one of her hands over his own.
The floors and walls were nearly black, with flocked wallpaper covering the area above the molding that wrapped around the room.
To make his plan a reality, much to his dismay, Draco had to do a fair amount of research into the muggle world.
“You don’t understand.” Harriet replied seriously as she glanced over at Oliver, “I can’t afford to lose today.”
It seemed endless to him, the amount of people that Lucius and Narcissa deemed necessary for the event, the chefs, the planners, the decorators, the bakers, the endless array of supposedly vital services…...
Harriet pressed a hand to the side of her belly and groaned, not only from the pain, but to gain her mate’s attention.
“You think I don’t already know that?!” Draco thundered, “That’s why I’m pursuing this paternity test to stop it! I will get my child, Potter! Whether you end this foolishness and give them to me, or I win them back through the ridiculous muggle court system, or I steal them in the dead of night from whatever family ‘adopts’ them, I will have my son or daughter! I have just as much responsibility to them as you do, though I doubt you’ll admit that…..You know, I thought Gryfinndors were supposed to be brave?”
It was even better than Draco remembered, of course, the first time, Harriet hadn’t been so deliciously tender~.
Draco had written his parents a letter updating them on the situation, detailing how he had saved his child from adoption by a muggle family and that Harriet was staying in the manor as he doted on her.
Harriet grinned at Draco and he smiled back for a second before he turned and closed the door gently with a flick of his wand.
Outside, the waves continued their tranquil, never-ending roll as Harriet’s nails raked her alpha’s back, letting him stifle her cries with a hand over her mouth so their baby could continue his nap.
Harriet and Draco talked about everything and nothing at all, but they didn’t once speak of a baby, and at last, after months of tense suffering, Harriet saw her alpha smile again.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Little Scorpius slept in the wooden crib that he had been provided for the night with his tummy full and his face relaxed, swaddled in the warm blankets that his parents had brought with them from home.
Langston heard a click on the other end as the phone hit the floor and Harriet tried to hold onto consciousness.
“That’s all about to change, Potter.” Draco said confidently as he rose from the bed, “Your alpha’s in charge now. What would you like to eat?”
“I’ve never heard of anything like that, but I think it’s a brilliant idea.” Draco replied as he fastened the buttons on his green and black silk pajamas, “St. Mungo’s doesn’t offer those. Our family healer told me I won’t be allowed in the room when the baby comes and I’m afraid that won’t work, Potter. Apparently, it isn’t a wizarding tradition for the father to be very hands-on. ”
A fragile hope rose in Draco’s heart when he saw the saddened look on Harriet’s face as she watched him walk out the door.
Harriet didn’t feel the slightest bit intimidated when she came home each evening to find her husband flying around on his broom in the yard while he trained for the upcoming game.
“Mmm…...alright…...” Harriet agreed without paying any attention to what Draco was saying as he began to kiss her sore body again while his hands dipped down to her bottom.
When he brought up the idea of a postpartum depression to the midwife and the healer, they shrugged Harriet’s issues aside.
“Good morning, Potter.” Draco smirked at his omega for a moment. He paused to admire how beautiful she looked before he bent his head and placed a kiss on the curve of her belly, “Good morning, my little one.”
When she turned her face up to look at him, Draco glanced down and met her gaze with a gentle smile on his handsome features.
Harriet watched as he looked down at their little boy lying in her arms and whispered, “No one will know we’ve left until we’ve already returned.”
Harriet said nothing to Draco about her excursion but she was bursting with excitement to hand him the finished product.
Once they arrived in the middle of Draco’s bedroom, he was startled when he looked down at Harriet and saw her wiping away tears that fell from her eyes.
Ron stood outside in the hall while Hermione helped her into her very expensive and very grand wedding dress.
“Potter!” Draco cried, racing over to his omega and shaking her slightly to see if she would rouse, “Potter! Look at me!”
Their kiss was long and languid and genuine…...and Harriet mourned the moment when Draco finally pulled away.
Hurriedly taking her change and her bag from the clerk assisting her with her purchase, Harriet picked up her parcel just as an arrogant voice called out.
Draco was frightened he’d angered her by telling her friends they had mated, but that wasn’t what made Harriet weep.
Harriet was grateful that the pub was mostly empty that morning, that meant there was little chance that anyone would overhear their conversation.
To assuage Hermione and Ron’s fears, that night, Harriet sat down at Draco’s writing desk, picked up a quill, and penned a reply:
Harriet reached out and grabbed Narcissa’s hand. As the baby inside her womb moved again, Harriet let out a breath and guided Narcissa’s hand to her abdomen, where she laid it to rest gently.
“But you take pills?” Draco grunted as Harriet moved around on the bed. His grey stare was transfixed by the way the extra fullness in her breasts increased their jiggling.
The sheets were white, the walls were bright, and the glimmering new day reflected off of the rippling ocean just outside of their massive window.
Baby Scorpius didn’t hear Draco’s guttural grunts as he held Harriet’s hips in his hands and thrust into her from behind.
Draco knew they weren’t together, that Harriet didn’t want him, but that still didn’t remove the pain of hearing her say that out loud to others.
Making sure his fingers were moistened by a simple spell often used at the hospital for examinations, he let Draco lean on him so he could gently check her progress.
He scowled nervously as he handed the wailing baby over to his mate and looked on as the midwife and the healer began their attempts to assist Harriet with giving her tiny son his first dinner.
Mirroring her son, Narcissa frowned too, but Lucius’s eyes remained narrowed and he stared at Draco incredulously.
Harriet stood and tied her night robe loosely around her swollen middle. Using magic, she carefully unlocked the bedroom door and silently padded out into the hallway.
Towards the middle of the afternoon, Harriet felt another worrying wave of nausea but to her relief, it passed without event.
Didn’t his omega understand that the last people he wanted to see, especially then, were Granger and Weasley?
Draco knew that Scorpius would be thrilled to spend a moment in the company of his favorite house elf.
Draco didn’t care that the gelato shop was small, run by a muggle family, or too chilly for his liking.
“-I can have anything you want to eat or drink brought to us right here.” Draco said as he smoothly interrupted his omega.
With his palms spread over what he recognized as the swollen belly of an expectant mother, Draco’s grey eyes flickered accusingly from Harriet’s bump to her face as he spat, “What the bloody hell is this?!?!”
Trapped there in his omega’s nest, focusing his efforts on pleasing her and helping his uncomfortable mate relax……..squeezed to breathlessness by the tender flesh of her creamy thighs…..it wasn’t the worst death that Draco had ever imagined for himself.
The commotion attracted the attention of several  others who all hurriedly gathered around the spectacle.
When they finally pulled away from each other, Draco was on his side and Harriet was on hers, facing him, while they chatted.
“There’s no need.” Harriet said as she yawned and pulled the covers over herself, “Gryffindor will win.”
Ron and Hermione had built a small house adjacent to the Burrow and Draco wrinkled his nose at the sight of the humble dwelling as he stood beside Harriet while she knocked on her friends’ front door.
They barely heard the words that fell from their own lips, they were only for ceremony anyway, Harriet and Draco had already pledged their oaths to each other.
When the midwife confirmed what Harriet already knew to be true, Draco came racing out into the corridor and threw his arms around his mother.
“Where?” Harriet asked with a chuckle, “We can’t just disappear, Draco, not for days, they’ll notice we’re gone…...What are we supposed to do with Scorpius? I can’t be away from him completely for more than about two hours at a time. They’ll definitely notice the baby’s gone. Your mother likes to carry him around like a little girl with her doll.”
The sudden rush of fluids that poured from her center caused the midwife’s eyes to widen and Draco’s mouth to fall open.
When the push ended, Harriet gasped in exasperated anguish and felt lips press against her leg, just above her knee.
Harriet wasn’t one for showy, pompous affairs, but having a day to spend partying and laughing with all of her friends and introducing everyone to her new son, well……
Harriet kept having unwelcome flashbacks from her time at the Dursleys, the brutal battles of the war, and the arguments she had had with Draco, although she had started most of those…...but they were all there, all her negative memories, in the forefront of her mind.
Both she and Draco quickly discovered that caring for a baby was more than just cuddling and admiring.
Before Ron could protest, Hermione dragged him up the steps to the shop and barged through the door.
Harriet didn’t want to accept Draco’s invitation, but she thought that maybe if she gave in to his demands, sat down with him, and explained the situation, perhaps he would finally leave her in peace.
Draco’s facial expression had nothing to do with Harriet or his feelings for her, but he was eager to stop verbally sparring with his father and focus on the day that laid ahead as he answered, “I apologize, Father, but with all due respect, this is one of the happiest days of my life. I’ll thank you to stop berating me, it’s really hampering my smile.”
“I’m sorry about dinner.” Draco apologized to Harriet after their torturous meal was over and they were back in his room, safely cuddled together in Harriet’s nest, “My father’s very old-fashioned.”
Harriet woke and rose from bed, feeling perfectly fine, with her belly still enviously flat three days after she had told Draco about her pregnancy.
The next two days, when Harriet was at home, Draco was glued to her side, but she laughed off his hovering and insisted she was fine.
Unbeknownst to either Draco or Harriet, far away, Lucius and Narcissa were making some last minute arrangements before they returned home.
Harriet didn’t reply, but she squeezed her eyes shut at the frustrating feeling of emptiness as she wriggled her bottom against him, trying to force Draco to stop his teasing and just give her what she wanted.
Ron and Hermione were very apprehensive as they walked into The Three Broomsticks together one afternoon.
Narcissa sighed as if her son had said something ridiculous and she scowled back, “Draco, this is a wedding. Did you honestly think that we could just use the draperies that are already on the rods?!”
“I expect if we do, you’ll have to hear about it for the rest of the week, eh, Potter?” Oliver asked. His question earned him a chuckle from the rest of the team. It was no secret that Harriet and Draco were happily married.
Harry’s voice was soft and sympathetic as he cooed to her, “I know it is, sweetheart. Let’s get you to-“
Draco’s grey eyes shot wide open as he looked at Hermione. Wordlessly, he turned and raced down the hall towards his mother’s voice.
“SHE’S HERE!” Draco screamed excitedly at Harriet as his mate fell back against the pillows, panting.
She groaned when he decided that he’d like to have a taste and suckled her as she lay helpless underneath him.
Ron had already taken his seat, but Hermione walked behind her to insure the flowing train of her veil didn’t get caught on the aisleways of the temporary benches that had been placed in the Malfoy ballroom.
Harriet’s face looked so soft and lovely like that. The gentleness in Harriet’s eyes melted Draco’s heart in his chest. As if Harriet wasn’t enough to ruin him, Draco scanned over the baby girl and he marveled at how small and adorable she was, staring at the miniature socks on her miniature feet.
“........That’s fine.” Harriet said after a long moment of holding her jaw clenched and her eyes closed.
However, on the morning of the Malfoy company board meeting during Harriet’s seventh month, she was glad to see Draco go.
She leaned in to kiss Draco’s cheek but instead, he caught her lips with his and pulled her in close.
He gave a single command and two house elves appeared in their bedroom doorway a moment later. The house elves scurried over and gladly took Lily and Narcissa from Draco’s arms. Both of the elves wore bright smiles as they carried the giggling Malfoy girls off to the dining room.
After Draco helped his lover cross over another peak of bliss, as he felt her shudder against his lips, her grip on him relaxed, and he looked up as her legs gently slipped to drape over his shoulders.
Harriet felt eyes upon her and she turned around. She nearly started when she saw Draco standing in the doorway.
At the last glance she had taken, Harriet had seen Draco still standing at the order counter and that gave her hope.
Even if his efforts had been successful and he had managed to sire a child, she wouldn’t feel anything the day after her heat ended.
“Very well.” The healer said with a sigh that sounded almost irritated, “You may take your leave now, Mr. Malfoy. I have work to do.”
Harriet peered out and noticed a man waiting on the edge of a nearby clearing, but it was the incredible beauty of the landscape which surrounded them that really captured her attention.
Hermione left a little while later and while Harriet took a brief nap, Draco took his son to meet his grandfather.
As the next two weeks passed, Draco’s watchful vigil of Harriet heightened to a point that she didn’t realize was possible.
In response, Draco smirked down at his son, which caused a wide grin to break out across Scorpius’s small, pale face.
Once Draco left her body, Harriet sighed as he peppered her face with soft, gentle kisses, content with a morning well spent.
Their time was mostly spent either lounging in the round bed or languishing about in the infinity pool.
Draco hovered over Harriet once they had finished, sweat gleaming on his skin as he dipped his head down and nipped at her breasts, laying his face against her chest to enjoy the strong beating of her heart.
Hermione had delivered her second child a couple months prior and as soon as Harriet felt like it, the Malfoys and the Weasleys congregated for an afternoon to introduce one another to the newest members of their families.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
When she was satisfied with how she looked, she stepped out of the lavatory, and walked back into the bedroom.
To Harriet’s regret, Draco didn’t seem to be all that enthused with the prospect as he looked down at their intertwined fingers and wondered, “But you were in heat……..”
Harriet rolled onto her back and murmured under her breath to crack the window open slightly with a spell.
He held his beloved’s well-being in the highest of regards, but Draco was nearly positive that if his delicious mate came any closer, he wouldn’t be able to control himself from showing her just how much he did want her.
“It’ll be over soon, love.” Draco whispered as Harriet whimpered when he helped her stand to her feet.
Beside her, Scorpius was snoring gently on Harry’s chest, lulled into slumber by his father reading him a bedtime story.
Thank you very much for your concern and the kind words that you’ve sent. I’m very sorry for everything that’s happened and I look forward to speaking about it with you and Ron soon, if you two can forgive me. I promise that I am not under any sort of coercion (see below) and that I am here, at Malfoy manor with Draco, of my own free will. The Malfoys are treating me well and everything is fine. Can you reply with a time that you and Ron will be free for tea soon? I would invite you here, but I don’t think we’d be able to speak privately.
“Shall I tell them you’re coming back to work tomorrow?” Draco teased in the same haughty, arrogant tone that Harriet had heard him use so often during their youth.
She saw herself sitting in the cupboard under the stairs, but Draco was there beside her and they were both children.
Harriet shifted on the bed and Draco boldly moved closer, seeing the apprehension about what to do next clearly in her green eyes.
During those three weeks, the midwife and the healer released Harriet from all of her postpartum restrictions, beyond the foods and drinks that would interfere with her milk, and little Scorpius celebrated his first three months of life.
He would have immediately apparated home and taken Harriet into his arms, if she hadn’t been carrying such precious cargo.
The awkwardness that Harriet and Draco had experienced during their visit to the gelato shop was almost comforting in contrast with the frigid unease in the Malfoy dining room as they ate with Draco’s parents an hour after Narcissa’s visit.
Harriet was beginning to worry about Draco when an ample amount of time passed and he failed to return home with his files from the office.
Harriet’s parents were resting in their graves and her dreams of holding back an announcement from Lucius and Narcissa until the right time were thrown right out the window by her overzealous alpha.
She and Draco both had forgotten to draw the curtains the night before, but as Harriet sat up in bed and watched the sunrise, she was genuinely glad about their mistake.
“Do you think we have a moment before our day starts?” Harriet asked Draco as she looked over at him.
Harriet wasn’t sure if Draco was really that focused on his task or if he just chose to ignore her outright, but he offered no response.
“I had trouble getting you out of the nest with the girls, too. Perhaps it’s twins again!” Draco mused as he pushed the covers out of the way so that Harriet could have room to stand up.
The omega grit her teeth and squeezed Draco’s arms while she widened her knees and bore down hard, following her instincts’ command.
“I…..I don’t know a Draco Smith.” Harriet replied in annoyance. She swallowed thickly when her throat began to  tighten.
“Oh, come off it, Potter, are you really going to make me beg?” Draco scoffed as Harriet stood there in the temporary nursery and cuddled Rose.
So then, the elation he felt as Harriet kissed back in silent acknowledgement of their loving tryst, was immeasurable.
As Harriet entered her last trimester, fueled by the nervous happiness that only expectant fathers knew, Draco began to make preparations for the birth. While Harriet took naps, he took lessons from the healer on what his omega’s labor would be like and what he could do to help.
If his son grew up to be one of those muggle accountants, or whatever they were called, instead, Draco would be just as proud.
“Potter….er, Harriet Potter…..” Draco began as he looked up into Harriet’s green eyes and pulled out a black, velvet ring box from his suit.
From his bassinet, Scorpius whined in displeasure at the unwelcome noise though his grey eyes remained closed.
Draco was glad that he had Harriet back, really back, and that she was acting like her old self once more.
“I am.” Harriet replied as she scribbled down her response to her friends, “If you don’t want to come, then don’t come. We’re around your family all the time. I think it will do me some good to visit with Ron and Hermione.”
To Draco’s irritation, not every detail had been remembered or recovered but what he sought was there.
Draco didn’t waste his time browsing through the cases of sparkling offerings that other customers poured over, no.
Harriet had never been displeased with any of their encounters before, but there was something about lying there in her nest, flushed and sore and needy, able to feel Draco’s strong arms around her and his breath on her neck while he used all of his strength to give her what she craved………
Behind her, Draco smiled for a moment before he shook himself out of his thoughts and began to dress himself in his brand new, perfectly sized black suit.
“Mummy’s going to be fine.” Harry nodded confidently to his son, then he turned to the house elf and ordered, “Dobby, take Scorp to play outside.”
As soon as she made it outside, the baby kicked her sharply in the ribs and the severity of the sudden motion forced her to stop and place a hand on her side.
As the evening wore on and dessert was served after three prior courses, Harriet asked her mate with a laugh, “Alright, Malfoy, tell me the truth.”
Harry thought it was lovely. Though he had been frequently annoyed by Dobby in his youth, the house elf was rather talented when he wasn’t cowering in fear.
“No, I expect you to quit and stay home with me and the baby.” Draco replied, laughing with Rose as she giggled at him curiously, “I run the family business. I can do that from the manor. The income from my father’s many companies in a single year is enough to last a generation. You don’t need to work, you never have.”
Harriet was certain that once the wedding was over and she was alone with her alpha in their room, he would take a moment to admire the tight buttons that trailed from the nape of her neck, all the way down her spine, stopping just above her round bottom.
Her smile was bright and her blue eyes were mirthful as she looked down at the sweet, blonde newborn in her arms.
Draco’s family was one of the wealthiest in the wizarding world, of course the ring he had purchased for Harriet was real.
Everything was finally ready, even the baby in her womb, which gently tightened underneath Harriet’s hand while she slept.
Draco’s heart raced when Harriet decided she’d had enough of the hindrance. He watched as she pulled away from him for a moment and wriggled out of the confining envelope of terrycloth to sit in her nightgown.
Draco wanted to break down when she met him with more resistance but his heart lightened as she spoke again to add, “But…...I suppose I could stay awhile….. to feed the baby, like you suggested.”
Lucius indeed sat at the head of the table with a deep scowl imprinted on his handsome features. It was difficult to determine whom he silently fumed more harshly at, Harriet, or his own son.
His steely stare skimmed over Harriet’s messy, dark hair, tousled and wavy as it hung over her shoulders, trailing to her full breasts and the mound of her tummy, splendidly highlighted by the green dress she wore.
“Very well, then.” The man nodded with a smile at the couple, “You two have chosen a beautiful setting to elope! The Isle of Skye attracts many visitors…...Though most people do come during the day….that’s alright! You can see the waterfall better at night anyway!”
“I’m nothing.” Harriet snapped, “I…...brewed an elixir incorrectly and it caused some bloating, that’s all.”
Harriet’s face was twisted as she struggled to speak but she nodded and managed to gasp out, “I…..I don’t know where Draco went……”
One was delivered in the morning, two were delivered in the afternoon, and several were delivered in the evening.
A dry moan of self-restraint escaped Draco’s throat as he resisted the urge to shred Harriet’s thin nightgown from her body and admire her changed form.
Once she was finished reading its contents, she picked up her wand and placed the tip against the parchment. Harriet watched as a tiny flame burst from the wand’s tip and very gently turned Draco’s letter into ashes, which she gathered in her hand.
“Everything looks good and healthy.” The muggle doctor announced to the couple once she was finished. Before she removed the wand from Harriet’s abdomen though, she gave the couple an option.
When you were the son of the company owner, you could do whatever you needed to get through the work day.
Obeying the primal command that issued from somewhere deep within her, Harriet leaned forward and parted the cover on the carrier.
Draco’s motions would have felt even lovelier if she had been in her nest instead of on the concrete floor with only a foam practice mat to support her aching body.
Draco’s face lit up in a smile when he heard the sweet little voices simultaneously cry out, “Daddy!”
“My nest is the only place where I feel comfortable at this stage.” Harriet grumbled as Draco stood and draped one of her arms across his shoulders.
Every time Draco looked at his son, he saw himself, but when he looked at his daughters, he saw his wife,
Hermione had witnessed Draco’s devotion to Harriet with her own eyes when she watched the tender support he showed her during the birth and after.
When Draco saw the bewilderment on Harriet’s face, he grew angry and shouted at the two women attacking his beloved, “STOP!”
“I don’t want to.” Harriet sighed stubbornly as she laid back against the pile of soft things in which she was happily entangled.
Close to dawn, as Harriet laid against Draco’s sweat-dampened chest, she raised a hand up and felt the heat in her cheeks.
Harriet seemed disheartened for a moment and then Draco watched an uncharacteristic expression of pure dismay cross her face. He frowned as she raised a hand and covered her eyes while she cried out to him, “You just want me to be miserable!”
Harriet knew that she had Draco’s unwavering support, which gave her courage when her green eyes snapped wide open one night.
“No, I’m fine.” Harriet said as she let out the breath she had been holding, “That happens sometimes.”
Draco Malfoy refused to accept defeat. As he took his hands off of Harriet’s abdomen and wrapped his arms around her shoulders, Draco promised himself that he simply wouldn’t allow Harriet to reject him.
“Yes…...to prove you’re the father?” Mr. Roberts asked, “The adoption order has already been issued by the court. As the adopting parents, it would be almost unheard of for us to rescind our offer. I’m not certain that we can….. My family and I will gladly honor your request, Mr. Smith, but this is out of our hands now. You’ll have to take the appropriate legal channels to disrupt the process at this point.”
Draco was skeptical about Harriet’s friends’ ideas but he took their advice and proceeded with the actions that they recommended.
Draco accepted his loss and he hadn’t mentioned anything about it to Harriet, yet he couldn’t free himself from the feeling that he had been……..cheated.
Scorpius furrowed his tiny brow at the noise and squirmed in her arms before she cradled him against her breasts until he cooed softly and burrowed back down to sleep.
Draco’s grey eyes snapped up to her face and he started to speak, “No, love! Wait a moment and I’ll—“
Draco, Narcissa, and Hermione were all hovering so close to Harriet that their proximity, along with the physical and emotional shock of her labor starting made the omega dizzy and she weakly dropped Hermione’s hand to shakily place her fingers on her temple.
When he saw no one there, he looked at Harriet again and nodded, “Yes! Come on! We’ve got to hurry! Put on the dress I bought you so I can take it off you later~.”
Harriet’s chest heaved as she looked up into her husband’s darkened face. Her cheeks were flushed and her green eyes were begging him silently to just give her what she wanted.
Harriet had been so relaxed and so satisfied during her heat that she hadn’t prepared herself for the onslaught of crushing pressure that came afterwards.
The midwife hastily dropped down to examine Harriet and when she determined things were moving too quickly, she used everyone’s assistance to reposition her patient to a safer angle.
Harriet bent over the bassinet and felt her nipples threaten to leak as she scooped her son up into her arms.
Harriet was relieved that Draco understood the error of his ways, but she had no issues forgiving her alpha as they resumed the usual, daily dynamics they had previously established.
From outside the room, he heard Harriet open the front door. He heard the whispers of voices as she, Ron, and Hermione started to chat.
Hermione stared at Draco. Silently, she asked for his side of the story, but Draco only shrugged as he took another bite of his gelato and replied, “You heard Potter, Granger, we’re not together.”
Draco had thought that he and Harriet would interview those such artisans together and ask for samples of their work, but clearly, Harriet had a different idea in mind.
Draco’s grey eyes widened when she pulled him down in the bed with her, though he did nothing to protest.
Draco’s smirk melted into a soft smile and as he watched his mate stare at their new baby, contentment bloomed in his heart.
Harriet didn’t want Ron and Hermione to come to the Malfoy’s house because she was convinced that whatever they spoke of, Draco, Draco’s parents, and the entire staff of house elves would somehow learn all about it.
After only a few days of her plight, Harriet’s cheeks had hollowed and what little light that had been left in her eyes was gone.
Harriet wanted to frown but the way that Draco’s grey eyes smouldered as he glanced from her belly to her face made her smile instead.
Harriet’s dress’s straps hung off her shoulders and left a good amount of her cleavage plainly in Draco’s view. He wasn’t certain which he enjoyed staring at more, that, or the creamy suppleness of her thighs that the hem of her new dress skimmed over.
Harriet tapped her fingers against the back of his knuckles to calm him down as his frown turned into an angry scowl, “Every day she wakes up exhausted! She comes home from work exhausted! Look at her! Her color doesn’t look right, something’s wrong!”
Harry had delivered quite a few babies in his time as a healer, Scorpius being one of them. From Draco’s primitive cry to her posture to the look on her wan face, Harry knew that they weren’t going to have the leisurely wait for the baby they had imagined.
Draco reeled in his fantasies, although from the way Harriet melted in his arms and happily returned his kiss, it was probable that the omega would have gladly accepted his advances.
“The child complicates things.” Draco huffed, “She pushed me away…….she’s going to give the baby to a muggle family with a farm.”
She pushed the thought from her mind and nodded at him reassuringly while she promised him, “Your father, your sister, and I will all write to you every day.”
Draco tried to talk to Harriet about her wishes for the birth, but whenever he did, she changed the subject.
“Of course I’m not upset, Potter.” Draco replied with a scowl, “All men want sons anyway. Look at him, he’s healthy and strong. He’ll be a fine heir to house Malfoy and house Black when he grows.”
He smiled lovingly at his mate and watched in happy anticipation as she raised her arms and pulled her nightshirt off………
“Hey, love.” Harriet greeted her alpha with a coy smile as Draco looked at her like he wanted to scream with joy, “Did you get my letter?”

“Of course, sir, and congratulations to you both!” The man said cheerfully before he turned and hurried away.
Harriet frowned. Without her wand, she couldn’t apparate. Muggle taxis didn’t come to Malfoy manor and she was in no condition to walk.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Ron’s eyes were glued to Harriet’s rounded belly as he repeated, “You’re supposed to be on holiday!”
Harriet flipped through a few of them while the elderly woman spoke. She didn’t know what she had been anticipating, but Harriet was amazed at how warm and kind the Malfoy’s midwife seemed to be.
Shuffling noises took over the room while the class’s instructor popped the video tape into the vcr.
Draco began to stroke the back of Harriet’s knuckles and she felt a surge of want bloom in her lower belly as she and Draco moved closer together on the couch.
Harriet brushed her hair and looked at herself in the mirror to make sure her clothes were on straight.
Harriet enjoyed a quiet sense of arrogant pride and as she chewed, she contemplated different ways to break the news to the future grandparents.
“You’ve finally decided to bear pups for me, Potter?” Draco growled as he positioned himself over top of Harriet.
His pounding heart raced faster when Harriet took a deep breath and he unashamedly watched the subtle movement of her breasts that the simple motion elicited.
Harriet‘a cheeks burned with anger, shame, and guilt. Had someone dug a hold outside the gelato shop, she would have walked out and crawled in it.
“I’m sorry, sir. We don’t have anyone currently admitted under the name ‘Harriet Potter’.” The receptionist informed the flabbergasted alpha.
It was impossible to know if the child was magically inclined or not yet, but as Draco gazed at his infant, he realized that didn’t matter to him at all.
It was difficult to say if Scorpius leaving for Hogwarts was harder for Draco and Harriet or himself and Lily.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“You can let me hold my baby, Potter.” Draco shrugged as he crawled onto the bed and burrowed into the layers of covers to be close to Harriet.
The night before the Malfoy wedding, Draco and Harriet spent the evening apart with their separate entourages.
Draco and Harriet began to establish consistent, daily routines and from the morning's tea to their last kiss before bed, the two of them settled into their patterns as if there was no other suitable alternative.
Hermione was not going to abandon Harriet in the middle of the omega’s greatest fight since the war.
As soon as the reporters noticed movement, the cameras began to flash and the quills began to sway back and forth as pictures were snapped and reports were documented.
“Full head of blonde hair!” The midwife announced before Harriet whimpered and curled forward to push again.
He had lost count of the times he had thrust into his mate as they lay cuddled together in her nest.
It always put a grin on Draco’s lips each morning when she looked up and gazed into his grey eyes as they greeted the sunlight of a fresh new day together.
She contemplated asking Narcissa, but she had been assured by her care team at St. Mungo’s that it was safe to apparate, even in the late stages of pregnancy.
Harriet looked at Draco over the soft mounds of her breasts and she laid a hand gently across her flat belly as she answered his question silently.
Lucius had stayed respectfully on the other side of the house throughout the ordeal but when Draco stepped into his study that evening, holding the small bundle in his arms, Lucius immediately looked up from his desk.
Narcissa looked like she was in great pain as she gazed at her son and spoke softly, “Draco, darling-“
Harriet had noticed that her alpha’s fears of being inadequate for his family had been overpowered by his pride and desire to protect her and the baby over the last couple of weeks.
“Did you order the flowers?” Lucius asked his wife while they packed up their belongings and prepared to leave.
While Harriet was busy getting ready for the night, Draco opened up a secret compartment in the bottom drawer of his ornate dresser, removed the velvet ring box that lay within, and slipped that little box into the inner pocket of his jacket…...
“No, Mr. Malfoy, your omega’s not carrying twins.” The midwife answered with a nod as Harriet raised a hand and stroked her baby’s tiny, chubby cheek.
Harriet didn’t realize it, but Draco laid awake while she snoozed. He kept his grey eyes fixated on her, watching for any signs of discomfort, with one hand tenderly over her small belly, waiting hopefully to feel his little one moving inside.
“Of course.” Harriet said, returning her friend’s smile, “She’s beautiful, Hermione. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of her.”
Harriet enjoyed making her alpha happy and the many rewarding moments that came with having a family.
“In the muggle world, proposing in a restaurant is considered ‘cliché’.” Hermione educated the alpha across from her, “Perhaps it is in the wizarding world too, I’m not that familiar with magical engagement traditions.”
“You enjoy seeing me like this, don’t you, Mr. Malfoy~?” Harriet asked as she let her fingers drift over Draco’s chest.
“I can hold him so you can go back to sleep?” Draco offered as he watched tears well in Harriet’s eyes.
Suddenly Draco didn’t matter so much as she squeezed onto Hermione and gave a harsh grunt as she listened to her body and pushed again…….hard.
Harriet was breathing hard as Draco rose behind her. He knelt on the bed so he could look down over his vulnerable darling as she waited for him to pounce and take~.
After such a torturously long time of her husband pulling away from her, Harriet hadn’t felt so “well” in weeks as she did that day when Draco finally made love to her.
Between the dressmakers, the hair stylists, and the jewelers, the Malfoy-Potter wedding staff put a tremendous amount of pressure on the bride-to-be.
She walked over to open the box but just before her fingers graced the lid, Draco swept over to her side, and grabbed her hand.
“Alright, alright…..” Draco said soothingly as he took Scorpius by his little hand and led him back into the house, “You can play with the pixies again tomorrow, how does that sound?”
Outside of Harriet’s office door, two secretaries passed by each other in the hallway and they heard the heavy thud as her body fell from her chair and crashed deadweight into the hard floor.
Slowly, Mr. Roberts stepped aside and welcomed his unexpected visitor into his home, “Well, Mr. Smith, won’t you come in?”
No, he decided that the safest place for his mate was the womb-like seclusion of his childhood home.
Harriet sat up from the examination table and pressed two fingers over Draco’s lips to quiet him, “I won’t hear it, Draco! I know my body…...I’m fine…...Alright?”
Whether Harriet was a better flyer or not, the fact remained…...Draco Malfoy was her alpha and that was something that he was careful not to let his brazen omega forget.
He wanted to know exactly how he should look after his little one and he wanted to know exactly how he should care for Harriet before and after the birth.
“We have an errand to run first. Prepare our room. Mrs. Malfoy and I will arrive in half an hour.” Draco ordered.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
The newborn whimpered softly. At the sound, Harriet groaned as she rolled onto her back and instinctively picked the tiny baby up into her weak arms.
“Shit, Potter……” Draco exclaimed in a husky, breathless gasp as his eyes widened at how impossible wet and accepting and tight Harriet felt.
Neither Harriet nor Draco fretted anymore over small details or their own projections of how the occasion should be conducted.
“I just want whatever’s breast…..er, best…..for you and the baby.” Draco said quickly, clearing his throat.
Draco opened the bathroom door and walked down the narrow hallway that led from the lavatory and the side of the shop out into the main dining area and the counter.
Draco sat down on the bed with his little girls clutching onto his shirt. He deftly maneuvered them onto his lap before he gently reached a hand out and touched Harriet.
Draco hadn’t been with his lover for a terribly long time but he knew from seven years of observing her and staying by her side those past, lovely few months that Harriet just wasn’t herself.
Draco had signed himself and Harriet up for the finest education on birth and babies that London’s muggle world could offer.
“That’s a lie.” Draco replied, Harriet smiled as he kept his hand in place and stared at her abdomen as if he could see through her skin, “I can feel them right now, in there, our little son or daughter.”
As the days wore into weeks and weeks melted into months, Draco celebrated each of Scorpius’s milestones with an enthusiasm that rivaled even Harriet’s and his parents’.
A worried scowl marred his face when he saw Harriet standing tensely in front of the table they had shared. Draco’s pulse quickened when he saw how bewildered his omega looked.
“Oh, that’s alright. Don’t worry about it.” Harriet said as she pretended to casually shrug Lucius’s comments off.
“This is your wedding, not your funeral. You need to at least look happy for the photographers. I don’t want to see any speculation in the tabloids that my son isn’t pleased with his union, it’s embarrassing enough that the world knows you fathered a child out of wedlock.” Lucius sniffed.
Draco would let her sit in his lap while she ate, cooing to her about how beautiful she looked and how pleased he was that she had finally been kind enough to give him a pup.
Draco sat down on the bed with his little girls clutching onto his shirt. He deftly maneuvered them onto his lap before he gently reached a hand out and touched Harriet.
Draco’s father tried not to think about the technical mechanics of what his son was doing with the Potter girl, but Narcissa decided not to focus on the gory details of her son’s…...private life.
No, what bothered Harriet was how overbearing the Malfoy family had become ever since they thought that she would be bearing a new Malfoy.
“Do you feel that you’re still capable of maintaining your usual hours?” The midwife asked, “I can write a letter for you to hand to your superior. Under magical law, a woman in your condition has the right to request a leave of absence or…….perhaps a reduction in the amount of time you’re in the office each day?”
He was a bit surprised when Ron and Hermione accepted his invitation. He and Harriet both scooted their chairs over so that they could sit with them at the small table.
Draco grit his teeth and positioned himself, growling as he sank into his omega, exhaling at the feeling of being sheathed within her once more.
Harriet laughed at the softness in her mate’s grey eyes as he knelt in front of her and gently touched her flat belly with his hand.
Draco didn’t want Harriet to think that he was some kind of deviant, so he had tried to be respectful about his unspoken new feelings that he was certain would be most unwelcome.

Nearly a month after they cared for Rose, Draco still brought up his desire to become a father on more than a few occasions.
Before Draco could protest or stop her, Harriet apparated away from The Three Broomsticks and arrived back at her apartment.
“I wasn’t talking about the baby being real, Hermione.” Ron said in a voice that was so serious, Hermione stared at him with her eyes narrowed.
Draco was wearing his most muggle-appropriate suit, which was simple and black, hoping that it wouldn’t draw too much attention.
Harriet didn’t slap Draco, or scream at Draco, but she did pull him down until his lips crushed against hers.
Draco had been very pleased when Harriet invited him to sleep in her nest after that first night. She passed her request off under the guise of wanting him close by in case she had another nightmare, but he knew the silent truth.
As their son squirmed in Harriet’s arms, something gave Draco peace of mind knowing that it would probably be quite a while before Harriet even considered returning to the office.
“Are you ill?” Draco asked urgently, “I bought some anti-nausea potion for you. It’s right here on the nightstand, I can-“
They fell into such a familiar routine that one night, when Draco wrapped around Harriet, he noticed she was actually arching her spine towards him.
Harriet Potter was his omega and Draco knew that she loved him as much as he loved her. If it took the rest of his lifetime to get her to admit that and accept it as fact, then so be it.
He assumed that the wedding officiant had already concluded the ceremony and he chose to end his own frustrating wait to kiss his gorgeous bride.
“I’m fine.” Harriet reassured him. He watched as she rubbed her eyes to try and hide her blushing cheeks from him, but Draco wasn’t going to let her downplay what had happened the previous night so easily.
After one particularly productive meeting, Draco slipped back into the nest beside Harriet just as she was waking up and he smiled as she cuddled against him.
“Good morning, Mrs. Malfoy~.” Draco purred, smiling slightly when Harriet’s attention snapped over to him and she blinked in surprise.
Draco deftly rose from the bed and looked down at his mate as he asked, “You’ll shout if you need me?”
“I’ve packed everything you’ll need.” Hermione told Harriet as she and Ron stood in the Malfoys’ small living area.
Draco moved his hands down her sides until they came off of her torso and gripped her soft thighs instead.
Harriet’s cheeks filled out along with the other places in her body that had been impacted by her sudden and rapid weight loss. As her appetite grew, Scorpius began to fill out too, and his parents along with the healer and the midwife were pleased with the baby's steady growth.
Draco’s thoughts were interrupted when a hard, low cramp gripped her abdomen, spreading to wrap around her body.
He was grateful when his wife spoke up and saved the conversation from becoming any more awkward, “Sure, Mrs. Malfoy. I’ll be glad to meet with her.”
“But, sweetheart, your letter said you had gotten her back, that she was staying here.” Narcissa frowned incredulously at Draco.
Mrs. Malfoy wasn’t interested in pawning off her baby boy under normal circumstances, but while she was in heat?
She could still pursue her dream and Draco could stay home and raise his own. He could even take their baby with him to his office.
It was overwhelming to Harriet for reasons she couldn’t fully explain. The unwanted touching and the sudden exposure of her naked chest felt like a violation against herself and her own intentions to help her baby.
He wasn’t sure how he had imagined it would all go, if Harriet did decide to be with him and raise their child together. Of course his overbearing parents would be involved and that meant that they would have to interact with Harriet during several different points in time.
It registered to Harriet that that horrible pain had ended and then, shockingly, Hermione moved back and Draco sat a tiny bundle next to her on the bed.
“Give me an entire quidditch team~....” Draco growled as he licked the cruel love bite he had placed on his beautiful wife.
Yes, as a matter of fact, he was going to get down on his knees and ask Harriet to marry him, until she had to pipe up and say something about it.
Harriet stopped stretching to look down at Draco and laugh as she said, “Then why have you been hiding from me?”
Harriet looked out the window and tried to forget the hypnotizing touch of the blonde alpha she had fallen into bed with those few months ago.
The couple watched the pleased look in her eyes when she saw them both sitting up in bed, wide-eyed, and very awake.
“.....Nearly there.” Harriet sighed as she rolled onto her side and Draco followed her movement to readjust his position.
“No, Slytherin lost, Gryfinndor won.” Harriet snapped. She was very irritated that after so narrowly avoiding death, the first thing on Draco’s mind was his pride and their ridiculous wager.
He heard a rustle behind himself and turned over in bed to investigate. His green eyes softened as he watched his beloved wife, Draco Potter, shift around uncomfortably.
Nearly six months have passed since that night. I’m certain you know which one I’m referring to. I realize that you’re apparently not interested in pursuing anything further with me. May I ask why you allowed me to claim you? All I want is to chat. I have no idea where you are or if you’re well or if this stupid owl is even sending you my letters. If you have received my messages, could you at least have the decency to respond to one of them, even if it’s just to tell me to piss off? It’s a bit disappointing, really, to find out that the girl-who-lived is nothing but a coward.
Draco kept his scowl on his face as he took a step back. He glanced between Lucius and Narcissa in such melancholy disappointment that it disturbed both of them.
“It’s not a guarantee that conception will happen during a heat, you know that as well as I. You were in health class with me in sixth year.” Harriet chided quietly.
Later, at dinner, Harriet and Draco sat across from each other while they shared the evening’s meal with Lucius and Narcissa.
He cracked his grey eyes open and spied Harriet lying beside him as she rustled around while she slowly woke.
During her time with the Malfoys, she had become surprisingly close to Narcissa, and while it seemed like a good idea at first glance to advise Draco to spurn his parents’ help, reject tradition, and do things entirely differently, Harriet could understand how such actions would come across as…….terribly rude.
His happy smile faded as Harriet became more and more vocal about the unpleasant sensations running through her body, but every time he looked over at the midwife, the healthcare worker kept a calm, relaxed smile on her face.
“His eyes are closed in this one.” Harriet said, pointing at one photograph before she pushed that particular picture over to the side.
As the intensity of Harriet’s heat faded, her restless desire died away with the arrival of her menstrual cycle.
Once the initial, exciting chaos of the baby’s arrival wound down, Harriet fell asleep as quickly as Scorpius that night, but Draco was wide awake.
He thought at first that she may be wearing perfume but as he leaned his face towards her more, he noticed it was her scent he smelled, raw and natural, the scent of his mate~.
Scorpius whimpered softly and Harriet bent down to kiss his tiny, round head as Draco asked, “Tell me, Potter, what do you think of this one?”
While Harriet sat, nibbling on her gelato, a man and woman happened to pass by the windows of that small shop.
Narcissa threw Lucius a dangerous glare, “No, Lucius! The Potter girl! The child that she carries! Draco’s elated, and I refuse to see my only son’s light extinguished at the hands of his own father.”
“Potter, this isn’t your fault.” Draco said as he spoke to Harriet. She didn’t reply but she stared back at him and Draco knew that she was listening, “It could be…..it could be from the hormones, played against your fears or worries…...it could be everything you’ve seen and lived through, but you need me right now, Potter. I’m the only one that realizes how much trouble you’re in!” Draco exclaimed.
Harriet stared out at the ocean, while Scorpius clung tightly to her, holding onto her breast while he enjoyed his morning meal.
Neither Draco nor Harriet felt the years as they passed, but to the couple, it seemed terribly soon that their family of four was standing on platform nine and three-quarters, facing the Hogwarts Express.
Draco rubbed a hand over his face and looked away for a moment before he heaved a great sigh and glanced back over at Harriet as he admitted, “I have to save you, Potter, because the truth is…... I need you far more than you’ll ever need me and I don’t think there’s anything that can ever change that now.”
Less than two minutes later, Harriet sat back against a mound of pillows, clutching Draco’s hand in one of her own as she listened to him coach her on her breathing.
Harriet would never admit it, but he was right. As she looked at her alpha, her alpha, tall and handsome with his sharp, grey eyes and pristine platinum hair, standing and cradling an innocent baby in his strong arms, warmth did fill her heart and desire did coil in her lower belly.
Sandwiched between his parents, Scorpius squealed with delight and Hermione wiped away tears as she watched the happy couple embrace.
“What are you doing, ‘Cissa?” Lucius asked with narrowed eyes as he watched his wife order the house elves about as they brought in the newly selected food items for the evening and began to place them on the table.
Little Rose had a rough time during the final night of her stay with the Malfoys’. Draco and Harriet took turns walking the floor with her until dawn while she wailed and wailed, stricken with a bad tummy ache.
Harriet’s green gaze bore into Draco’s grey eyes as she declared with absolute seriousness, “I, Harriet Potter, boldly state that you, Draco Malfoy, are bone of my bone and blood of my blood. I give you my body, Draco Malfoy, that we two might be one. I give you my spirit, Draco Malfoy, until our lives shall be done.”
Everything had to be picture perfect. The photos that would be captured in a short while were going to be printed alongside the article that would launch the Malfoy family name back into good standing.
Draco glared at her but Hermione swallowed back the tears that gathered in her eyes as she pleaded with him, “Draco, she’s my best friend! Surely you can understand that! I only want to sit with her for a while! I promise I-“
“......What do you say to a day of shopping, then?” Draco asked as he bent his head and kissed her cheek.
Draco was worried that she wasn’t getting proper nutrition but when he consulted the healers he had hired, they didn’t seem too concerned as they exchanged knowing glances with one another.
Thank you so much for reading and following! I hope that you enjoyed this story! I have more Drarry works planned for the future. If they interest you, I hope you’ll consider checking them out! Thanks again!
From his bed, covered with duvets and blankets that were all Slytherin green, Harry Potter opened his eyes and glanced out the window to admire the bright sunlight of the day.
The doctor nodded, took the wand off of Harriet, cleaned her patient’s belly, switched off the machine, and stood with a nod, “Give me a moment and I’ll have your pictures ready.”
Draco remembered staring into the void as the secretary attempted to make small talk with him to pass the time, but he didn’t remember what she said, nor did he really hear.
Harriet looked at Draco while she walked and the bright smile that spread over her lips as she gazed at her groom made his breath hitch as it hit him squarely in the heart.
“Clearly, my only son has forgotten about the war.” Lucius said as he bitterly reminded his wife that the Potter family were not traditional friends of the Malfoy household.
Behind them, the reporters apparated away one by one since none of them could remember why they were there at all.
“I’m not pregnant. My next heat’s going to come soon, possibly tomorrow, possibly tonight.” Harriet said as she sighed again and looked back over at her husband.
Draco’s father, Lucius, and grandfather, Abraxas,  had their own family portraits on display in that hall too, also taken when the Malfoy men were in their infancy.
Draco held her lithe body in his hands while he nipped and licked, releasing her breasts to make his way down her flat belly.
Before the family apparated away, Draco stood in front of Harriet, kissed Scorpius’s round, little head and looked deep into his wife’s eyes as he whispered quietly, “I love you, Potter.”
“The baby isn’t a Slytherin.” Harriet laughed at Draco as they playfully squabbled over the color of the upteenth baby blanket they were purchasing, which was made out of the finest, softest fleece on the market.
It was a rapid and unexpected change from languishing about Malfoy manor, as they had done since Harriet had come to stay, to bustling about, planning the grand wedding.
“Is it, Granger?” Draco snapped, purposefully ignoring Ron’s comment, “The two of us already share a son and a bed~. She’s mine and I’m hers. I’m tired of lollygagging around. She should be my wife and she will be…...I need you two to assist with that.”
He felt himself melt at how beautiful she looked with her hair fanned behind her on the pillow and her fair face relaxed as she rested.
After a moment passed, when they began to grind against each other again, Draco lamented the fact that they had gone this long before experiencing one of Harriet’s heats together.
The healer and Draco exchanged icy glares before she eventually yielded, turned, and followed the midwife out of the room.
“That’s for the best. You’re going to need it, love.” Harry said as he bent his head and kissed Draco’s cheek, “Call me when you need me, alright?”
It still seemed odd to her most days, that Draco Malfoy, cold, calculating, sneering Draco Malfoy…...could be so loving.
With a dry swallow, Harriet shakily pulled her toothbrush out and gripped the porcelain sink while a cold sweat broke out over her skin and her stomach ominously turned.
On his second try, Draco’s actions earned him a roaring applause, a wide grin from his mother, and the tiniest, slightest, but truest of smiles from his father.
Since Draco was directly behind Harriet, she didn’t see him move his arm out to the right during one of the camera’s flashes while the photographer snapped his shots.
Draco gasped in disbelief as she looked down at her small daughter, gazing into her green eyes, in awe of how alert the newborn was.
After he recovered from his sudden surprise, Draco scowled back at Harriet, “I wasn’t talking to you, Potter! I was speaking to my child, thank you very much!”
From where Draco knelt, he placed the ring on his beloved’s finger and then quickly stood to claim his prize.
“Lucius and I are very glad that you’re here.” Narcissa told Harriet as she stared down at her belly with a happy smile.
Harriet was embarrassed by the rush of happiness she felt knowing that her alpha wanted to be by her side and support her.
Harriet glanced over at Draco angrily at first, but her face softened a bit when Draco glanced at her then looked back over to ask Ron and Hermione, “Unless the two of you want to join us?”
Harriet didn’t glance over at Draco in the bed but she tried to move without disturbing her alpha while shuffled over to the bassinet where her little one lay waiting for her.
Harriet whimpered at the word and sat up in bed, exposing her swollen breasts and flushed skin directly to Draco’s view. His grey eyes widened as they greedily consumed the sight of his wife in such a vulnerable condition.
Harry was too preoccupied with his task to worry about if his excited grin had offended his wife or not.
As he began to disrobe himself, he watched his omega lay back and spread herself wide for her husband.
Rita Skeeter and a crew of her fellow, vulture-like journalists pounced on the opportunity and wrote a short novel on the dramatic, passionate affair against the two enemies-turned-lovers.
As she lay there without a decent distraction, the constant ache she’d felt in her back for days returned. She winced as she struggled to sit up more in her nest.
“That’s not her, Hermione. She’s on holiday, remember? I’m sure she owled you about it too.” Ron said, dismissing his lover’s claim.
Trying to win the battle her emotions were waging against her, Harriet reached out to the end table and picked up another letter she had received about a week ago.
“Miss Potter?” Harriet heard her attorney ask but the phone fell out of her hand and she didn’t bother to try and grab it.
Low, deep cramps rolled through her empty womb as she fought back a nauseating urge to construct a safe place in which she could rest.
Harriet groaned longingly at the contact but Draco clenched his jaw and hissed his repeated command, “Say it, Potter!”
Across the house, as Draco held Harriet’s hips in his hands and thrust into her like a wild stallion, he imagined her rubbing her swollen belly as she sat in her nest.
Harriet furrowed her brow just a bit as she listened to Draco and she watched while he took his hand in hers and held it tightly.
“No, really, it’s alright. I don’t eat very much.” Harriet replied, placing a hand on her bump as she tried to quiet her growling stomach.
That thought broke Draco’s heart. He wasn’t sure he could withstand the hurt of seeing that idea validated, but in spite of himself, he turned to glance back at Harriet just before he left the room.
“Potter,” Draco said quietly, “Please, make this simple for everyone. All you’re doing is causing pain and chaos. I thought heroes didn’t like pain and chaos?”
Draco would have gladly let his languid kisses with Harriet flourish into a lovemaking session but he was too attentive to his mate’s needs to push her any further when he sensed her enthusiasm lessening.
Harriet felt her temperature raise and her skin burn as her core heated and the area between her legs dampened. In desperation, she looked around and tried to decide where she wanted to be.
Draco had slept a solid, uninterrupted four hours, which was the longest he and Harriet had gone without each other since the first night of their stay at the beautiful island.
One warm, summer evening, Draco stood at the manor’s back entrance with a scowl marring his handsome face.
Hermione didn’t know if she should ask about the baby or not…...it was making things even more awkward that Harriet hadn’t said a word about her pregnancy.
Two weeks went by and there was still no change, however, Harriet’s hours did increase at work and for that, she was grateful.
The classes had said that nursing helped omegas relax with their babies and would help cultivate a sense of safety and peace, but as he looked on at his omega and their son, the anxiety that was ingrained into Harriet’s features frightened Draco.
“No, no, I’m fine, that was……..that was brilliant…………..Now I’d really like to sleep, though.” Harriet said with a yawn.
“Don’t worry about it, Mother, Father.” Draco said coldly to his parents, “What difference does it make if my son or daughter is born a bastard? My child’s just an ‘unfortunate mistake’ anyway, right? So is my love for Potter, I assume? Tell me, did you two feel the same way about me?”
Harriet gave Draco a pleading look and he smirked as he realized that she did, in fact, want his help.
Draco was snoozing peacefully beside her. Her face softened as she looked at him and thought about the devotion he had shown her.
He moved one of the ebony rocking chairs from the nursery into his and Harriet’s room along with the bassinet.
The midwife was standing over her, with the top of her wand against Harriet’s covered belly. As his paternal instincts raged, it was all Draco could do not to slap the midwife’s tool away from Harriet.
Harriet blinked and laid a hand on her belly as she listened to her husband, “........Is the company in trouble?”
“That’s fine, we don’t need to be gone for more than an hour or two.” Draco said contemplatively as he moved up on the bed to sit directly beside Harriet.
His grey eyes were wide with anxious horror as he lunged towards the reception desk and shouted at the woman behind the counter, “Where’s my wife?!?!”
Draco himself was battling the urge to weep bitterly as he sat his omega down on a bench outside and let them both collect themselves for a moment.
She didn’t think that her prejudices ran deep enough to allow her to hate Draco’s child, no matter who the mother was.
Harriet looked up from the baby and met her alpha’s gaze with her own as Draco swallowed and nodded, “We have a son.”
“Nothing’s wrong, Draco darling…..” Narcissa replied, “But you two need to get dressed! All the bakers have come early. We’re waiting for you downstairs.”
Draco’s body went limp upon impact and startled gasps rippled through the crowd as everyone in the stands fell silent.
Harriet jerked away from Draco so hastily that he jumped. He had been so focused on comforting his unborn that he failed to notice the baby’s mother had woken.
Time was not something Draco had in ample amounts. It took him only a few seconds to whirl on his heel and face his father with a grimace.
Draco knew that Scorpius would be thrilled to spend a moment in the company of his favorite house elf. He watched as the creature led Scorpius down the hallway towards where Lucius and Narcissa sat waiting at the dining table.
“Hello, Rose.” Harriet said with a gentle smile as she looked down at the infant who blinked up at her with wide, green eyes, “Do you remember me? I’m Harriet. I’m a friend of your mummy and daddy’s and I’m going to look after you until they come home.”
Harriet watched Draco stare reverently towards the screen and her grip tightened on his as she watched him gaze at it as if he were looking into the future itself.
In the chaos of the flying players, the cacophony of cheers and claps from those seated in the stadium, and the buzz of the whirling balls as they whizzed by, Harriet slowly remembered how to play.
Draco scrambled over to Harriet and took Narcissa’s place after she knowingly moved out of the way before she was pushed aside by her frantic son.
“I don’t know anything about muggle hospitals.” Draco sneered, “Did you really want the attention that our sudden arrival in St. Mungo’s would bring?”
Draco brushed a stray strand of hair out of Harriet’s face as they both silently remembered what had happened between them the last time they had been together on Draco’s bed…..
Harriet knew her alpha loved the enhancements that nursing their little one had brought to her body and the gentle way that he liked to remind her of that was in no way unwelcome to the omega.
Narcissa and Hermione looked up as a gentle little cry sounded after Harriet’s ended and Draco waited impatiently for the midwife to cut the cord.
As time began to pass though and Draco watched his parents start to age, he thought about life more carefully.
Hermione let Harriet clutch her close sympathetically and Narcissa frowned, but at the foot of the nest, the midwife and the healer were hard at work.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Harriet’s eyes snapped wide open and Draco smirked at his shocked wife while he replied, “What's the matter, love? Did you have a date?”
Lucius eyed his son with a cold, scrutinizing stare as he stood behind Draco, who faced a long, claw-footed mirror.
To distract himself from the mind-numbing, potential reality he was about to face, Draco thought about his experience with the receptionist.
“What’s the matter with her?” Hermione asked while the midwife and the healer parted Harriet’s legs.
Draco smirked as he looked up into Harriet’s green eyes and whispered arrogantly, “Do you trust me, Potter?”
The tie of her bathrobe was firmly fastened over the swell of her belly. No matter how she turned or laid on the bed, she couldn’t ease the smarting pain that burned in the center of her lower back.
“Of course, Mr. Potter!” Dr. Krause smiled at Draco, “You two get to keep the pictures, that’s half the fun!”
If Draco hadn’t been worried about tiring his bride too much, he would have made love to her, but when he saw that her eyelids were already heavy with sleep, he scooped her into his arms and quelled his own desires for the time being.
Two weeks after the game, her alpha had healed from his injuries, but bothered Harriet and said that his signature smirk had not returned.
“Potter and I are mates.” Draco said simply, deciding that he would interject after all, since Harriet couldn’t find her own words, “And our gelato is melting, so you’ll have to excuse us, Granger.”
“Not much, Mr. Malfoy.” The midwife shrugged at Draco, “The first weeks are often difficult, her body will adjust as time passes.”
Harriet had to abandon the idea of enjoying some quality time with her alpha, he simply didn’t have the available room in his schedule for that.
Draco had no knowledge of how the muggle world worked and he had no one to contact about such matters. He wanted to at least gather Mr. Robert’s opinion and compare it with another later.
Since the wizarding world lacked an equivalent curriculum, he saw no better way to prepare himself and his mate for parenthood.
“Potter! What’s wrong?!” Draco demanded, seeing Harriet huddled in bed with tears pouring down her cheeks, “What’s the matter?! Are you in pain?!”
While he waited for the healer to arrive, Draco pulled a chair next to Harriet’s bedside and sat down. Lovingly, he took one of her hands into his and gently stroked the back of her knuckles with his long, pale fingers.
“Harriet Potter-er, Malfoy….Harriet Malfoy! I am extremely wealthy and she is extremely famous! How do you not recognize us?!” Draco shouted in exasperation.
The classes and the books all mentioned what a delightful, blissful time for Harriet and Draco the first few days of their baby’s life would end up becoming.
When Harriet felt her breasts start to become tender and those familiar, low cramps begin to roll through her belly, she was filled with a greater sense of dismay than she had anticipated.
Draco struggled not to purr as the toddlers fondly pulled on the collar of his suit and used their tiny hands to pat his face.
“You can slap me or scream at me if you want to, Potter.” Draco whispered to Harriet, with an unfathomable softness in his grey eyes, “But I simply have to kiss you.”
“A mother’s milk can ebb and flow like the tide.” The midwife nodded at Draco, “I’m not worried about your baby’s weight, Mr. Malfoy. I’ve looked at him, he’s perfectly healthy.”
Harriet didn’t protest but she seemed a little uneasy about being left alone with a healer she hadn’t selected.
Draco had painstakingly monitored Harriet’s diet and he followed all of the instructions the midwife had given him on how to care for his wife, but it just wasn’t enough.
Harriet looked from one side to the other in awe of the tranquil beauty of the area’s rolling hills and swooping patches of deep, rich green.
“Our destination is a surprise, Draco. I told you I called the travel planner last month and she booked us a holiday. You agreed to go with me wherever I chose, remember?” Harriet asked as she locked their trunks.
Harriet didn’t know the intricate details, but she was aware of Caesarean sections and what they involved.
“It means overdone…...trite.” Hermione explained, then she nodded, “You were right, Harriet would have hated that.”
Draco growled in his throat and clasped his hand over his eyes in an exaggerated gesture of exasperation.
That was his baby, there, inside his mate’s marvelous belly, round and full and vulnerable, dependent on him to protect. From her ample breasts to her supple thighs, Draco didn’t know where to begin on his omega.
A sense of unease prickled up his spine and Draco was suddenly gripped by the instinctive feeling that something was wrong.
As a result of the unbearable hovering that Draco was already showing her he was capable of, Harriet hoped that her pregnancy went quickly.
Draco would have noticed the way she craved sugar and consumed everything from fruit to chocolate in vast amounts.
Draco didn’t care for anything about the muggle world, but he was quite confident that the hospital was his least favorite.
He never mentioned it to Harriet, but on some days there were rippling echoes in his mind that he couldn’t ignore.
When Scorpius needed to have his nappy changed, Draco took his baby to the nursery himself, insisting that the house elves wouldn’t lay a scraggly finger on his precious son.
“Lily.” Draco chided as he glanced over at the toddler that stood in her bed and looked at him with her emerald eyes, “Narcissa,” Draco added as he turned his gaze on the other small girl who was standing in her own crib, which was directly across from her sister’s, “What have I told you two about holding onto the rails like that? You’re going to slip and pinch your fingers.”
“I think I’m going to have to do a bit more than that.” Harriet grinned as she looked down at Draco and let her fingers idly ghost through his platinum blonde hair.
He had a son of his own, a little boy that would one day grow to be a man and inherit all that his noble family held.
Draco’s grey eyes were full of hurt and confusion but he obeyed his omega’s wishes and turned his attention towards the screen.
“Rose, this is Draco, my husband. Draco, this is Rose, our little guest.” Harriet said with a quiet chuckle.
That was when it occurred to Harriet that she may have started a battle for which she wasn’t properly prepared……..
He diligently read baby book after baby book in an attempt to understand how best to look after Harriet and his unborn.
Draco slid his wand from his pocket and with a single flick, he closed and locked the door behind himself without a second thought. He kept his eyes fixed firmly on Harriet as he stalked towards her predatorily.
Draco reached out and let his elegant fingers ghost along his wife’s tender glands, scowling as he cruelly pinched the rosy tips that fattened under his tantalizing attention.
Draco snatched the black box off of his desk top and fumbled with its sealed sides as he attempted to pry it open.
Harriet was content that she had a few moments alone. During her school years, she liked to be able to clear her head properly before a game.
Draco heard his wife’s coworkers clapping behind them, but he didn’t care, he didn’t care if they were happy about it or not.
Draco propped himself up on one arm and looked down at Harriet. Despite her abrasive attitude, he took his hand and began to trace soothing lines with his fingertips up and down her belly.
Harriet saw the small sparkle of excitement in her alpha’s tired eyes before she reluctantly stood from the bed and walked towards the cavernous closet in Draco’s bedroom.
She feigned being inconvenienced by the hastiness of their departure, but as she stood there with Draco, preparing to go on their romantic adventure together, she wouldn’t have preferred it any other way.
“That’s just where I ate too much last night, Draco, you’re being ridiculous.” Harriet said dismissively.
Harriet felt very loved to have an alpha that didn’t mind the way her hips had spread or the thin, silvery souvenirs towards the bottom of her belly that proudly announced to the world she had carried his child.
The stubborn omega trudged through her days until her nausea abated without help from Draco’s potion.
His smirk faded when he thought back to their gelato outing. Unconsciously, he tightened his grip on Harriet when he thought about the fear in her eyes and the way Weasley and Granger had cornered his poor mate. Draco knew that Harriet had been in no danger of physical harm from her friends, but that didn’t quiet his instincts or the urge to protect his pregnant lover. He struggled to suppress a low growl at the thought, frightened it would wake Harriet, when a knock sounded on his door.
She needed to be on the bed she shared with Draco, even though he wouldn’t be beside her until later.
They were far too concerned with making sure their union had been undoubtedly consummated to consider slumber.
As soon as they arrived in the foyer, Lucius turned and walked towards the wing of the house that he shared with Draco’s mother, Narcissa.
“Alright.” Harriet agreed. Draco was about to speak again but Harriet added, “........I’d like that.”
Harriet couldn’t even bear to look at Draco as he gazed at her with all of the lavish sentiment that a Malfoy in love possessed.
Draco sighed to himself and went the opposite way, towards the part of his family’s massive estate that he inhabited with Harriet.
Harriet’s green eyes were soft and loving as he took her wailing newborn from his father’s arms, but she became startled and frightened by the way the healer and the midwife took over as soon as she had the baby within her grasp.
They were certain the plan they had devised would work and Draco trusted their judgement as Harriet’s best friends.
“We’ve gone over positions and exercises, different methods, and the various risks and benefits of several interventions.” The teacher reminded her class, “Today, we’re going to examine an alternate route, the Caesarean section. I understand it isn’t a popular choice among alphas and omegas, but it’s my job as your educator to make you aware of your options in the event that on the big day, things go differently than you imagined.”
“I apologize, Mr. Malfoy.” The receptionist said with another smile that was sickeningly sweet, “You see, I work in the emergency department, not in the maternity ward.”
The trio sat and chatted for hours by the fireplace in the wing of Malfoy where they had been temporarily housed.
Lily and Narcissa looked at their beloved daddy curiously and he reached his arm around Lily to put a finger to his lips as he glanced between his daughters.
A few minutes later, Draco used a charm to disguise their faces and together, the couple apparated to a distant town outside of London.
It was a lovely feeling, a representation of the love her alpha held for her and it placed in her such a deep sense of comfort, one that Harriet, who had been raised as a mistreated orphan, was so unaccustomed to that it drove out all of the fear and the doubt and the pain and the poison she had managed to bottle inside herself after Scorpius’s birth.
Harriet’s dress was dark and short, with a flattering fit, and a plunging opening between the high, lace collar, and the sweetheart neckline.
Harriet’s heart thudded in her chest as her hormones once again consumed her and she shifted uncomfortably in her nest, impatient for Draco to come over to her and give her what she craved.
Draco, like the rest of the Malfoys, wasn’t that interested in traveling, especially not at the moment.
Harriet’s green eyes were fixed firmly on Draco’s as she began to breathe slowly through her nose and out of her mouth exactly like they had been instructed in the muggle classes they had taken.
While he assisted Harriet, he scowled over at the healer and retorted, “I wasn’t a hindrance when my baby was conceived. Tell me, Healer, how many wild thestrals have you brought to drag me away from my mate? That’s the only way you’ll get me to leave her side now.”
“Well, Mummy is the Mummy, Daddy.” Harriet countered with a warning scowl as she pushed Draco’s hands away from her sides, “And Mummy tells Daddy when it’s time.”
Gently, Draco rubbed the omega’s swollen womb until he felt a small jab land against his palm. His breath caught in his throat, but Harriet seemed too busy eating to notice.
All she needed to do was find it. That sound, that high-pitched whizzing, that minuscule golden streak in all of the commotion, that’s what she needed to do.
Well, whatever it was, Lucius Malfoy secretly thought that it was rather clever…..for the muggle world, of course.
Relentlessly, they hounded her throughout the day and chased her like angry ghosts all night every night in the form of nightmares, from which she woke shivering and drenched in sweat.
“I just need you two to sign the license, sir.” The officiant said as he handed Draco a paper and a pen.
Harriet herself laughed at her groom’s eagerness as she placed a hand on his cheek and welcomed his kiss.
As Harriet sat at the table, waiting for Draco to come out of the bathroom, she was unmistakable to her friends.
“Why wouldn’t it be?” Ron asked with a frown, “They both said they weren’t together, but their mates…….but they aren’t together.”
“Thank you…….You look very handsome.” Harriet nodded in approval as she walked over to her mate, placed her hands on his chest, and looked up into his eyes.
“I want to keep you like this forever.” Draco confessed. That pompous smirk he had worn so often during their school years crossed his face as he went on, “I want to watch you carry my children and have you be completely dependent and reliant on me. I want you to give yourself only to me and let me use you exactly how I want to, touch what I want to, nibble what I want to…....”
“Not as beautiful as you~.” Draco replied in a voice that was both tender and husky at the same time.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
One evening, as Draco sat on the small sofa in their bedroom, kissing Harriet fervently while he tried to maintain his composure as she clawed at his shirt, a thought entered his mind that saddened him just a bit.
“We…….we can’t…...do that yet, Malfoy!” Harriet huffed while the skin on her face burned bright red.
Draco was worried about the baby, but Harriet’s headache had nothing to do with her pregnancy. Her headache was from imagining how she was going to explain everything to Hermione and Ron.
He flicked his wand to confirm that his office door was locked and then he hastily unfastened the fly of his trousers.
Draco closed his eyes as he began to move his hand, recalling with perfect memory the exact pitch of the sharp cries he had drawn from Potter’s throat, after he brought her back to his room and claimed her for his own.
Normally, she loved it when her husband chose to keep his grey eyes adoringly fixated on her, but that night, after what they had learned from the midwife, Harriet knew Draco wasn’t giving her the kind of attention she hoped to receive.
The only thing in the world at that moment that saddened Draco was the gut-wrenching knowledge that they couldn’t stay in that second, in that room, in that bed, forever.
“Yeah……..” Harriet said absently, grimacing as low cramps curled through her abdomen, triggered by the baby’s hungry motions.
Draco scrambled out of the muggle elevator so quickly that Harriet couldn’t resist the urge to laugh again.
Harriet began to explain, handing the picture over to Draco as she spoke, “I’ve placed the baby up for adoption. There’s a wonderful family who will welcome them with loving arms.”
Draco’s vision fixated on the swollen glands. They seemed much plumper and rounder than he remembered. Harriet’s darkened nipples protruded through the thin fabric of her nightgown, begging him to peel the airy fabric away and latch on…..
Harriet adjusted well to life at Malfoy manor and with Draco’s parents still away on their business trip, he and his beloved had no interruptions during their days together.
She cried out at the sting of pain as she felt her womb twitch inside her, eager to obey her alpha’s order.
“I’m very sorry, Mr. Malfoy,” the midwife chuckled, “Gender detection isn’t always accurate. It seems that you and Mrs. Malfoy have become the proud parents of a Slytherin prince instead.”
“I think he’s perfect.” Harriet whispered as she tucked the blanket that her infant was wrapped in a little tighter and kissed the top of his round head.
“Well…….Well, we were told that we were having a girl!” Draco frowned at the midwife, “We bought clothes for a girl….. We’ve prepared a nursery fit for a Slytherin princess! What are we supposed to do now?”
When Harriet brought Scorpius back to bed and crawled under the warm covers to feel Draco beside her, she offered her breasts to her baby while her new husband let one hand cup her face as he leaned in for a kiss.
Draco removed his shirt, shoes, and trousers to change into the shirt and slacks that he preferred to wear when he lounged.
Draco pulled the blankets over herself and shivered in the morning chill as she thought happily about how their little family was growing.
He tried not to dwell on the fact that though several, grim minutes passed by, the medical staff did not leave Harriet’s room.
“I’m hungry too. Let’s continue our day, shall we? Perhaps you could show me something muggles like to eat.” Draco suggested, “Is there anything that you’d prefer right now?”
No longer encumbered by the stress from work, Harriet could eat whatever she wanted, sleep whenever she wanted, and do both as much as she needed.
The nervous alpha outwardly appeared calm as he watched a majority of the crowd whisper to their neighbors, about which Draco assumed was himself and Harriet.
“Then see that you do.” Lucius spat, his breath hitting Draco in the eyes, “I’m warning you, son. No Malfoy’s ever been born a bastard, and I won’t stand to see the first while I’m the head of this family.”
…..But Draco sucked in a breath as Harriet rolled onto her hands and knees and offered herself up to him, feeling a blush spread across her cheeks as she felt his eyes take in the view of her rounded rump.
Draco to fall on his knees as soon as they were back in his room and express his love for her again?
The clothing and the dinner reservations were easy, but the custom ring he had designed for Harriet required three long weeks to be crafted.
The primal groan that left the blonde’s lips made Harry frown but all Draco felt was pain and anger as she bore down.
