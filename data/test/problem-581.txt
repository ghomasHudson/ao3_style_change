“Healer Malfoy, that tone will not be accepted in this hearing. You will show this committee respect, or you will leave,” Healer Perkins warns, voice so cheery that it’s unsettling.
Draco nods and presses his forehead to Harry’s. “Where did we go for our honeymoon?”
“Mr. Malfoy, your request is denied—”
“No. Kept it in check, more like,” Draco chuckles.
She clears her throat before chiming in. “Letting patients with impaired memories languish in unfamiliar environments is not only ineffective, but potentially harm-inducing. Harry would do better at home, where he can find routine and be supported by his family,” Hermione says in a tone implying there is no room for dispute.
“Yeah?” I ask. I lick a smudge of strawberry from his cheek and press our foreheads together, unsure of what that means.
Nausea rips through Draco’s body, making him shudder as he makes his third leap from Mayenne to Hémonstoir. He plants his palms on his knees to empty his stomach into the field beneath his feet before straightening to wipe his mouth with the back of his hand.
Harry appears in the doorway, wearing an old Chudley Cannons jersey and frayed track pants. He’s tied his hair in a tight knot at the top of his head, but stray curls and shorter strands escape from the bun, framing his faze in a frizzy halo. The smile on his face is bright as he leans against the frame, allowing his lingering stare to crawl over Draco’s body.
He doesn’t mention the failed Legilimency trials or the experimental muggle pharmaceuticals. It’s selfish, he thinks, but, some days, he can’t bring himself to talk about anything but Harry as he relates to himself.
He sticks the note just above the photo and smiles. A wrinkle-free Draco waves at the camera while Harry sneaks a hand behind his back to pinch his bum. Harry cackles while Draco poorly feigns a scowl, and the photo starts over on its loop.
“In La Trinité-sur-Mer.” Draco nods against Harry’s shoulder. “You remember?”
“Draco, are you even listening?”
“You look… broken,” he says, gaze assessing Draco’s dark circles, his chapped lips, his dull hair.
Later, Draco unconsciously glances towards the clock on the wall as they emerge from a memory of a seeker’s game they had at the Burrow about a year ago. He could smell the wildflowers as the snitch flitted about the field, feeling neglected as they chased each other more than they worried about the game. The snitch had buzzed above their heads, glinting with the light of the setting sun, when they’d finally settled on their backs in the tall grasses, talking aimlessly and stealing kisses between breaths. They’d struggled to contain their laughter when Ron couldn’t find them for dinner but didn’t hesitate to hop up when Ginny hollered with a threat of a Bat-Bogey jinx from the back porch.
Pansy’s heels tap on the tile as she strides towards Draco, leaning down to drop a kiss on his cheek and snatch an orange slice from his hand. She takes a bite, careful not to smudge the crisp line of her black lipstick.
“What does that even mean? Draco, please, just let me help you. I just want to-”
Over the years, Draco was careful to tend to this memory, to maintain its fidelity. He smiles weakly as the familiar sun-soaked beach comes into view, littered with shells and pebbles. Their cottage sits in the distance, tucked into a cove of trees whose leaves ruffle in the light summer breeze. Harry is sprawled, barefoot and bare-chested, over the hot sand while Draco sits cross-legged next to him on a towel, hunched over a book.
“Harry, you have to sleep.” He imprints the words into Harry’s cheeks. “We’ve been there, darling. We’ve tried... and it isn’t pretty. I need you to trust me and take this, please. Take it for me.”
Time hurtles ever forward as Draco meanders towards the pile of smoldering embers, knees creaking as he takes his seat next to Harry. He brushes his sand-covered hands on his shorts and leans over, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“And I remember us staying at a cabin, laying in a hammock. We slept there all night, didn’t we?”
With a flick of his wrist, Draco starts the coffee pot and plops into a chair at the kitchen table, resting his bare feet on the wicker stool across from him. Another meow from Patches prompts the continuation of his morning routine as he directs his wand at a tin of cat food, cracking open the lid and emptying it into the little bowl on the countertop. Draco snorts at the glare he gets in thanks. He watches with amusement as Patches hops gracelessly onto the counter and settles in for breakfast like she hasn’t eaten in years.
“I could stay,” you say. Your guts shift pleasantly in your belly as he releases your finger with a loud
“You haven’t even read the appeal!”
Draco nods, and his mouth goes dry. “It was a Ministry gala. They were serving berry tarts for dessert, and you said you wanted to—”
“I love you, Draco,” he whispers.
“It’s quiet,” Draco repeats. “Stay with me?” he asks, letting his chair legs settle on the floor with a
Draco leans back in his chair and laces his hands together in his lap, granting silent permission for Odette to continue.
My chest aches at the dissonance between what was and what is. What should have been and what will no longer be.
Draco grimaces. “Close, Harry. Very close.” There is no easy way to correct these answers, Draco’s discovered. “It’s 2017. Good try though.”
Countless stars fill the sky above the isolated countryside, as though it’s been speckled with paint. Under the endless sky, Draco shudders with the realization that he can’t go back, can’t turn around and undo what’s been done. An unwelcome seed of anger takes root for a fleeting moment. Whether Harry improves or, Merlin forbid, the curse tightens its grip, Draco is all Harry has left.
You reach for the dial, but all the radio spits out is static. “It wasn't my fault.”
You twist your lip, pulling the tender flesh between your teeth and biting, hard, until a spot of blood blooms against your tongue. Malfoy's attention follows the uneasy fidget of your mouth. He licks his cherry-stained lips as he watches you climb into the Cadillac.
Before Harry and I got married. After the War. Before the Ministry so graciously allowed me a wand again. After Harry lost the vision in his left eye as the cursed scar tissue tightened its grip.
“Honey, you’d follow me to the ends of the earth if I asked you to.” Draco’s smile is confident, but not arrogant. I can’t help the roll of my eyes as he finds a way to recover from his uncharacteristic confession. “But you know what, Harry?” he asks, crowding me further against the counter.
Draco reaches trembling fingers to cup Harry’s cheek, smoothing his thumb over Harry’s cheekbone before pulling him into a kiss. He clings to Harry like he needs him to breathe, like Harry, alone, sparks the electricity in each one of Draco’s heartbeats.
Draco laughs, full and easy, before pulling Harry in for a kiss. “Last one, love,” he murmurs against Harry’s lips.
“Just watch. We’re not done yet,” Draco whispers, unable to peel his eyes from the scene as it comes back into focus. His chest aches as he watches himself fall apart in Harry’s arms.
“Don't have one. Haven’t had one since 2004,” you mutter, crossing your arms over your chest. Your vision blurs as you stare at the road, a concrete haze as it slips beneath the vehicle, and then—
and in front of his friends, no less.
Instead of raising his wand, Harry feels his feet drag him towards Draco, as though drawn forward by something mystical, magnetic. The stage seems to lengthen as he walks, the distance between him and Draco stretching further and further. He can feel the prickling gazes of his classmates, dissecting and judging each footstep towards the Slytherin.
“I might be dead tomorrow, anyway. Nothing’s guaranteed these days,” you say, overwhelmed by the need to let go, to feel his hands on your neck and your back and your cock.
Outside, the summer air is thick with humidity, but the darkening sky lessens its weight. A chorus of crickets chirps from the field behind the house, lulling Draco into a strange sense of nostalgia. It’s disconcerting as it mixes with the panic he carried with him through the floo.
sits on the bedside table in the same spot as yesterday, and an unfinished dinner tray lays on the floor next to the door, sandwich untouched but treacle tart completely gone. Harry’s glasses case sits cracked open on his pillow, containing a wrinkled lens cloth and his medical identification bracelet, which he, for whatever reason, can’t stand to wear. Draco’s eyes finally settle on Harry, who sits cross-legged on his bed, hunched over a chess board in deep contemplation.
“Hermione?”
from me.”
An irritating buzz sounds from the captured light above Draco’s head as he moves to stare at the rotting tart. He clenches his hands around the counter’s edge and inhales, letting the foul stench of decay fill his lungs. With a disgusted curl of his lip, Draco sends the plate hurtling towards the wall, flinching at the sound the porcelain makes as it shatters. His strides match the rapid pace of his breaths as he crosses the room to assess the damage.
“And a garden and cat you shall have.”
For a moment, however brief, you're back at the Ministry, surrounded by heads and bodies. You can control it, the wild magic that lurks beneath your skin. You told them so, but they didn't listen. Didn't believe you.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s. Every evening after work, Draco counts them. He notes the piece of gum that sticks to step seventeen and the chipped paint on steps three and twelve. Seeking an anchor, he runs his clammy palm over the cool metal railing. His footsteps echo in the narrow tower of concrete, and as he nears his destination, the sound slows like a thready pulse.
after the war.”
“Harry?”
Harry stands, still transfixed on the tangled mess of limbs and the growing pile of clothing on the floor. He reaches absently for Draco’s hand, interlacing their fingers before mumbling, “I had to ask you twice… You said ‘no’ the first time.” He turns, wide-eyed, to look at Draco. “Why did you say ‘no’ the first time?”
with his ankles crossed properly in front of him; others, he tucks into a muggle novel, his long legs criss-crossed and contorted beneath him. Occasionally, and more often in recent years, he dozes off with his arm tucked under his head, not yet ready to face the day.
“Draco, can I kiss you?”
“So predictable,” Harry chuckles.
“You looked so hot in that Slytherin quidditch kit. Those pants are so good for your arse. We should play quidditch when you bring me home.”
Those closest to you have been extremely helpful in providing
The ever-present monitoring charms coat room 332 in a green glow, and twilight seeps, muted and fragile, through Harry’s tiny window. Though Harry appears calm at Draco’s side, the rapidly blinking heart rate above the bed betrays his demeanor. In the low light, the anti-apparition wards shimmer on the wall like an expanse of delicate but sturdy spider webs. They hum, low and steady, in the otherwise silent room.
“Excellent. And what year is it?”
he watches her lips take the familiar shape in understanding of Draco’s silent request.
There are two stray kittens that meow under the yellow porch light, scratching expectantly at the back door. Every evening, Harry feeds them a tin of cat food and scratches under their chins while Draco pretends to roll his eyes and ignores the fact that he bought the extra tins to begin with.
“What the fuck are you doing?” Harry bursts through the door and yells over the blare of the alarm. “How long have you been in here?” He clambers onto the countertop to reach the horrid device, fumbling with the buttons before finally ripping it from its base on the ceiling. It falls to the floor; a smattering of dusty plastic shards decorates the floor on impact.
The kitchen table sits in the corner, covered in a layer of dust and grime. My chair is still here, shoved against the wall, and Harry’s lies on the floor (though they aren’t really
“All right, wands at the ready,” the Bloody Baron shouts from his spot on a windowsill above the crowd.
Autumn air lingers in the living room, dewy and smelling of the earth as it slips in through the open windows and patio door. Draco hovers over me with a crooked smile and slides my glasses onto the bridge of my nose, bringing his face and the room around us into focus. We’re surrounded by a mound of blankets and pillows strewn in front of the hearth. The clock on the mantel says it’s half nine.
As the sun sinks towards the horizon, Ron casts an
“It took you forever to convince me to go camping, but I’m so glad we did, Harry. It was so good; you were so good,” Draco’s words trample over each other to leap from his tongue.
“I really don’t want to hear it right now, Odette. How did he do today?”
They’ve established a routine these last few months. Odette never offers information until Draco asks, and Draco only asks when he’s ready. Some days, they chat for a while about their patients, or books, or the most recent batch of clueless residents. Other days, Draco can’t stand the small talk.
Draco attempts a smile, but is sure it’s more solemn than intended based on the look Hermione gives in response. In an instant, she wraps her arms over Draco’s shoulders, standing on her tiptoes to pat the space between his shoulder blades.
“Mhmm,” Harry hums as he prods Draco’s thigh with his foot. “Funny, I remember loving your chronic state of indecision, your unsatisfiable need for tidiness, and your love of Celine Dion.”
“What’s wrong?” I ask, eyes wide and incredulous as an unhinged laugh crawls out my lips. “Are you seriously asking me that question?”
“You look so pretty, Potter. So pretty with your eyes all fuzzy and your stupid mouth hanging open, just for me,” he murmurs, rutting against your thigh as you reach for his flies. “I want to taste you bleed.”
Draco glances back at the
A step creaks under his feet as Harry lazes down the rest of the stairs, muffling a yawn and scratching an itch between his shoulder blades. Draco glances up at the sound and unashamedly smooths his gaze over Harry’s body beneath his barely-there pajamas. The cheeky glint in Draco’s eye fades to reluctant amusement when Harry sticks his tongue out for no reason at all.
“It’s all right, Harry. It wasn’t important,” Draco sighs, releasing a shuddered breath.
It didn’t. He didn’t.
“I know we will.”
He vaguely feels the mattress dip as a hand removes his glasses and brushes the stray fringe from his sweaty forehead. Though he can’t be sure, he thinks those same fingers entwine with his as he’s dragged into a heavy sleep.
“Who says I’d go?” I inhale and feel the press of his fingers in the spaces between my ribs.
The idea that he stays for me is an admission that I never expected to hear. I steal away the thought for safe keeping.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
“Don’t say sorry. We went back to my flat, and you drank a sobering potion, much needed by the way. What we did after was better than anything we could’ve done at the bar,” Draco drawls and wiggles his eyebrows in a way that he’s sure makes him look ridiculous. But Harry laughs, and Draco would do almost anything to hear that sound.
As you collapse further against the hood of your smoking truck, another set of headlights appears, a pinprick of light against the darkness of the deserted parish road. Unwilling to watch another car pass you by, you bury your head in the crook of your elbow as you raise your thumb into the air with all the enthusiasm of one volunteering as a human sacrifice. Much to your surprise, instead of the parade of trucks and minivans and rusted beaters that have demonstrated just how devastating the doppler effect can sound, the low rumble of the engine hums, pitch steady as it stops at the side of the road.
“Fuck. Draco, I’m so sorry.”
“Harry!”
“Depends,” Draco breathes, sinking his fingers into the muscle of Harry’s arms. “What did you get me for our fourth wedding anniversary?”
“What’s your favorite color?” Harry asks on day one hundred and forty-two, precisely two weeks following St. Mungo’s Ethics Committee’s denial of his release. Ignorant of his mandated captivity, he sits at the head of his hospital bed with his legs draped over Draco’s lap. Janus Thickey’s anti-apparition wards hum in Draco’s ear as he leans against the wall. An encouraging spark glimmers in Harry’s eyes as the curse takes a breath and loosens its grip.
“Need me, then. It’s that easy. Draco, just—need me.”
Your blood is a violent river in your veins, agitated by the thundering constriction of your heart. Malfoy flashes you another toothy grin, showing off the harsh point of his incisors. It makes you dizzy, the thought of Malfoy’s hands traversing your body like an unexplored land. Those teeth grazing the flicker of your pulse, his tongue lapping at the salt of your skin.
“What did you get me for my sixteenth birthday?”
“Draco, I can’t do this,” Harry growls. “You can’t make me do this.”
“I wonder if I’ll molt.”
“I’ll see you both on Sunday. Goodnight, Draco.”
“Granger’s a smart one, she knows what I mean.
Harry lies back onto his pillow and focuses on the rise and fall of Draco’s chest as he is gently lulled into a dreamless sleep.
“Come on through. She’s out on the back porch,” he says, bewildered, before prying Rose’s fingers from his beard.
“Oh, Draco.”
It’s become a game, figuring Draco out over the past few months. Though the more we play, the more I realize I’ll never win. That I’m along for the ride as long as he’ll have me, but I’ll never know where we’re going.
Like I’m still a child who doesn’t know what to do with his hurt.
“Never mind about the hair. Get to the point, Odette.”
“You have to sleep, Harry,” Draco murmurs into his ear. He doesn’t elaborate.
He quirks a brow, clicking his tongue against the back of his teeth. “Lots of creatures in these woods, Potter. Could be dangerous.”
“Merlin help you if I am disturbed at four in the morning,” Draco laments, dramatically resting the back of his spare hand on his forehead. “Ah, what was it from the movie we watched the other day? Oh, before sunrise, he’s
“It had to be you stranded on the side of the road, didn’t it?” he asks, though it doesn’t sound like a question.
Harry got his first gray hair that year.
So, he did what anyone would have done really, and sat on the opposite end of the couch, stretching his legs alongside Malfoy’s. He pulled out the snitch he’d nicked from the broomshed the previous week and began to mindlessly fiddle with its wings. The evening proceeded uneventfully, allowing Harry to indulge in his favorite pastime of watching Malfoy: the way he chewed his lip and tapped his quill when he was stuck, the way he started to lazily drag his left hand across the parchment at the end of the night, smudging the ink on his palm.
Harry feels like Harry today, the real and full Harry. To Draco, he’s a lure on a line that continually gets ripped from his grasp. On days like this, he can’t decide whether he wants to smile or scream.
of Apparition rings, then another. Neither of you break your rhythm as you summon a flash of muddied green, the relentless pounding of Malfoy’s cock in your arse, unhindered by the smell of burnt skin. Two dead Aurors lie on the side of the road as a scream rips through your throat and your cock pulses against the heated metal of the car. Malfoy’s fingers tighten in your hair, stinging your scalp and stilling your neck as he twitches deep inside you.
“Maybe the papers were right, after all,” Malfoy says through a throaty chuckle. “You are a nut.”
Draco’s fingers turn numb and cold, but his face is hot as his heart pounds behind his ribs. He lets his disbelieving stare smooth over each member of the Ethics Committee, lost for words as they all evade his gaze.
“Evening, Odette.”
The spine of a single feather, sleek and wet with blood, erupts from the thin skin draped over my collarbone. It mocks me in the bathroom mirror, unsightly and pale quills stained pink. My shoulders droop, and my spine rounds, a weary folding beneath the weight of an unsurprising development, as a crimson droplet runs smooth down my ribs.
“Cheesy,” Harry whispers into Draco’s ear, sending a shiver down his spine. “You’re getting soft, old man.”
Draco pulls his hands from his face and holds out his palms. Instead of the gold that pours from Harry’s skin, his palms drip with bright crimson blood. A single droplet slides down his pale skin to suspend from the string wrapped around his wrist before falling to the flooded floor below. Harry can only watch as bursts of blood bloom across Draco’s chest.
relegates the shadows towards the corners. The light reveals the piece of treacle tart that rests on the countertop, molding and stinking despite the stasis charm. Harry’s trainers sit in a pile by the back door, still muddy from their last seeker’s game back when autumn had taken its first breath.
Harry begins to wrap the thread around his wrist as he follows it into the night.
Ron nods in encouragement before taking Harry’s forearm and disappearing with a
“I wouldn’t bet on that just yet, Harry. Every day, I’ve brought memories with me. We’ve reviewed them in hopes that it may trigger a release of the curse that has a hold on your mind,” Draco explains.
Draco says. An urgency coats his voice, and fear burns his throat. His heart thrums in time with the irritated pulse of the wards as another layer shatters, emitting a brief glimmer as it falls, like the flash of a shooting star in the night sky.
When Draco enters Harry’s room, he almost smiles at the sight of its decorated walls and cluttered surfaces. After their first denial, Hermione suggested that if they can’t bring Harry home, they should bring home to Harry: mementos and photos, familiar clothing, and random trinkets to supplement the otherwise sterile environment. At first, the Healers weren’t happy about it, but Odette fought ferociously to let the little pieces of home remain in Harry’s room. So now, photos in varying stages of aging hang above Harry’s bed, near the door, on the bathroom mirror. A stack of worn flannel shirts sits on the table along with his favorite Canons’ pajama bottoms, and a snitch flits about the room, frustrated by the enclosed space.
“Of course.” A haughty smirk settles over his face. “Got yourself into quite a bit of trouble, hm?”
“Draco, I’m not afraid of you,” Harry hears himself say as the scene of the Great Hall dissolves around him. His words echo off the walls of the prefect’s bathroom and evaporate in the haze of steam that hangs in the air. “No, no, not here. Please, not this.”
Peeking out from the cave of his arms, Harry finds the blond leering over him, a teasing smirk firmly in place. There’s a slight tension in the lean muscles of his neck, despite his otherwise casual demeanor, and the downturn of his eyes is reminiscent of worry. Harry is certain he’s hallucinating.
as that’s the only
“Just glad you remembered, is all. I was looking forward to those waffles, today,” Harry says with a wink. “Also, it’s hot when you wear my pants.”
“We?”
“We have to bring him home,” she sighs before taking a sip, wrinkling her nose at the bitter taste.
Draco shoves his hands in the pockets of his Healers’ robes as he watches his younger self assess Harry with a wide-eyed expression of stunned horror. He takes a moment to observe the older Harry standing beside him, who stares at their former selves with a similar visage of disbelief.
Draco flips on the wireless and starts in on the batter, pulling ingredients from the refrigerator while summoning others from the pantry. He flicks his wand at the coffee pot and dumps ingredients in a large bowl while the warm and comforting scent of the coffee fills the room.
“If only,” Draco whispers back.
“I know, love. I’m trying, I promise.” Draco pulls him closer, counting each of Harry’s breaths and focusing on the beat of his heart under Draco’s palm.
Draco; get with the times. And are you going to pretend she’s wrong? All the pining, and moping, and sighing, lately? If I had a galleon for every time I heard a pet name fall from your mouth, I wouldn’t be wearing fake Louboutins right now.”
A no-longer-precariously-perched fork.
“Alright, gentlemen, I will take that as my cue. If the gifts aren’t wrapped by now, they’ll never be.” Hermione stands to wrap her arms around them both in as much of a hug as she can manage with her belly between them. Draco pats her shoulder and Harry plants a kiss atop her frizzy hair before she turns to leave.
After too much chocolate, Rose collapses in Ron’s lap, fully immersed in a sugar coma. Pansy rests her head on Ginny’s shoulder as she prods at the fire with a stick, eliciting a gasp of sparks as it takes another breath. As the sun dips below the darkening sea, Harry takes a seat next to Draco in the sand, brushing his bare foot over Draco’s shin before stretching his legs toward the fire. Draco shifts closer in the sand, lining their legs up, hip to ankle. The fire heats the bottoms of Draco’s feet and fills his lungs with a pleasant burn.
A single, vehement beep pierces the thick air of the bathroom, cascading into a series of agonizing tones as the fire alarm protests the steam of the shower.
Harry sits on the floor next to him and gently pulls Draco onto his lap. Draco doesn’t fight it, but buries his head in Harry’s neck and wraps his trembling arms over Harry’s shoulders. The memory blurs as Harry rubs circles into Draco’s back, and Draco crumbles like shattered glass under solid footsteps.
“You’re leaving?” Harry turns around to ask, expression panicked.
“Did you say something, Draco?” he shouts from down the hall. I wait, listening for footsteps that don’t come.
You're too late. The raccoon didn't stand a chance against the front tire. Let alone the back one. You flinch, feeling the rattle of the wheel bearings in your bones.
"So fifth year, then?"
Another car passes, headlights foggy with the dense humidity of a Louisiana summer. The engine gurgles and sputters as the driver flips you the bird, rejecting your crooked thumb, pointed skyward in question. You release a frustrated sigh as that fifth or sixth or eleventh car disappears down the shadowed, two-lane highway, its red tail lights flickering like a warning against the inky black sky.
She grimaces. “He should be done with dinner by now. Good luck, Draco.”
Loving him is too much.
Draco inhales and releases, letting the practiced incantations slip repeatedly from his lips.
“We still started with a blank slate this morning, like the gods wiped everything clean while he slept.” Odette squirms under Draco’s stare.
Draco closes the gap between them, no longer cognizant of what their younger selves are doing on the kitchen floor. They’ve gotten here before, although it’s not every night that Harry remembers moments that aren’t given to him. Despite his best efforts to quell his hope, Draco’s heart accelerates in his chest.
“But this doesn’t make any sense... You’re not making any sense!” Harry yells frantically, temper flaring and intensified by panic. “This isn’t alright, how can you say it’s alright? I’m so sorry, Draco, how could I… What I did, I-”
“Nothing, love.” My eyes fall to the open tube of toothpaste as I reach an unsteady hand out behind me, softening once I feel the slide of Harry’s fingers between mine.
In the dusty corner of Draco’s cell at Azkaban, he’d found a phrase, etched into the crumbling stone and barely visible through the erosion from the elements. When he couldn’t sleep, he’d trace his finger over the shallow scratches in the wall. After all of these years, he can still see the words if he closes his eyes:
a clink of metal on rotting, wooden floors.
“No. There was one night when I panicked, and I almost didn’t,” Draco admits.
Draco nods and leans precariously on the back legs of his plastic lawn chair. “It’s quiet—” his stare glazes for a fraction of a second before he continues “—and we can see the stars.”
Draco stands to offer his hand, and Harry reaches to interlace their fingers immediately. Some mornings are still better than others when it comes to Harry’s memory. Since coming to the cottage, however, there is a noticeable improvement in how quickly he’s able to ease the curse, as though lulling a serpent into a harmless stupor. Though his day-to-day memory is still shoddy at best, there are some days that Draco’s sure he notices a spark of familiarity in Harry’s eyes.
Harry sits up, letting the blankets pool around his waist. Glancing down, he contemplates the sharp lines of his emerald green dress robes, the patterned stitchwork of a charcoal vest, and the shiny silver buttons of the crisp white shirt underneath. He doesn’t remember why he slept in his dress robes, but decides not to question it.
Some mornings, Draco flips through
Malfoy wraps his arm around Harry’s waist, supporting him as the unlikely pair silently treks up to the common room. About halfway through their climb, the staircase shifts, overwhelming Harry’s already blurred sense of balance. He briefly considers letting himself tumble down the stairs, but clings pathetically to Malfoy’s bony shoulders instead.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
“Is this what you want, you sick fuck? You got hard the minute you saw these fucking teeth.”
Summoning a sense of calm, Draco closes his eyes and breathes deeply through his nose, imagining the bright scent of geraniums and the crisp tingle of Hermione’s magic in the garden at Grimmauld. The same humming that emanates from the far wall enveloped them both in the garden, night after night, as Hermione constructed wards around the perimeter. The charms she cast grew increasingly complex, though their monumental presence stood only long enough for Draco to meticulously peel them apart like layers of skin.
There are thirty-two freckles on Harry’s left shoulder blade. Every night, Draco kisses them, one by one, and traces the twenty-four bumps of Harry’s spine with his fingertips.
Harry opens his mouth to argue but his mouth fills with sand and his vision rapidly fades to black.
“Unfortunately, no,” Draco admits, clicking his tongue behind his teeth. “But what about this one: what can you tell me about why you’re in St. Mungo’s?” He stutters an exhale as he waits for Harry’s response.
The sweetness of the strawberries still lingers on his tongue when he slides it between my lips.
I could blame my inability to pull away on the old, bitter liquor we’ve sipped on all night. I could say my mind is fuzzy from the heat. I could say a lot of things, but I’d mostly be lying.
In the tarry black, you only hear Malfoy as he leans in, ghosting his breath over your ear as he purrs, “Turn on a light.”
Draco smiles and reaches for my hand. He brushes his lips over my knuckles and plants a kiss in the middle of my palm before pulling me onto his lap. Grains of sand cling to our hair, and sweat coats our skin. But the pleased hum that resounds in Draco’s throat is worth the discomfort and then some.
“You in there, Potter? Or has your brain gone to mush in the heat?” he asks, a flicker of curiosity in his eyes.
Seeing Harry outside of St. Mungo’s feels like gazing at a cruel mirage, desperately longing for it to be true but knowing it’s impossible. Draco walks towards him slowly, his mind not yet ready to believe what his eyes are seeing. Mid-laughter, Harry glances towards Draco, eyes bright and trusting. Harry slips from under Ron’s arm and strides across the beach, meeting Draco with an embrace that lures the air from Draco’s lungs.
Ginny and Ron are already waiting on the beach when Draco lands on his knees in the cool, moist sand. His belly contracts as he dry heaves, resting on his elbows and holding his sweaty hair from his face. A gentle hand rubs his shoulders, and he catches familiar, fiery waves out of the corner of his eye.
He lays his palms on either side of Harry’s face, gentle, trembling, before stuttering, “I thought you deserved better than this. We were emotional, tipsy, and I didn’t want to wake up to you thinking it was a horrible mistake.”
Sorry you’re a snitch short of a broomshed, darling.”
Draco shrugs. “Long. Started with an Amortentia overdose and ended with a very bizarre situation with a Draught of Living Death. My head hurts just thinking about it. You?” He plops into a chair across from her and steals a handful of Every-Flavor Beans from the plastic bowl on the table.
“Shh, Harry. This isn’t forever. I won’t let it be.”
charm rings, and a warm breeze ruffles the curtains at the open window. Draco looks at Harry, who lays in their bed beside him. Out of habit rather than necessity, he counts the steady rise and fall of Harry’s chest as Harry remains submerged in his dreams. Though Draco imagines reaching out to trace the bumps of Harry’s spine, the curve of his bony hip, he refrains. Harry would only turn over to find a stranger in his bed.
Thoughts blurred, I gasp as he ruts against my arse, as I thicken in his hand and a heady rush soothes the irritable magic that bristles beneath my skin. I groan against the pressure of his palm over my throat, feeling the vibration in my chest.
“You’ve softened in your old age, Draco.” Ginny says as she uncorks the bottle of champagne. “That bum gets to have a lie-in every day as it is. Harry!” she yells between her laughter as she tries to contain the overflow of agitated bubbles to the sink. “Up, up, up!”
Harry leans forward again, resting his elbows on his knees. He’s never been able to sit still, but the nervous habits have gotten worse with the memory loss. Some days, it’s like keeping track of a snitch.
Salty air lazes on a gentle current through the window, and the gulls chatter on the rocks in the distance. Though it’s early morning, the mid-summer sun already hovers above the horizon, casting a golden shimmer over the gentle waves from the bay. Patches, their three-legged tabby cat, lazes in the warm rays on the windowsill and meows when she looks towards Draco. A not-so-subtle request for breakfast. Draco absently scratches behind her ears and leans against the window frame, letting the morning air fill his lungs and seep into his pores.
“Well, hello, beautiful. Nice of you to join the world,” Draco murmurs and presses a chaste kiss to Harry’s lips. “Is this how you want to spend your last day on holiday?”
Every night, Draco answers the same questions, albeit they vary slightly from day to day. Every night, Draco prepares himself for what to expect, for how to answer, for how to approach each subject without scaring Harry or making him uncomfortable. And every night, Draco is thrown off his feet by the courage and the pure, unadulterated trust that Harry gives so freely. After learning that his memories have been stolen from him for months with little progress towards recovery, Harry’s first act, without fail, is to ask how Draco is holding up.
“As I’ll ever be.”
“Is that it?” Harry asks, stepping back towards Draco. “What happens next?”
They’d argued that morning, before Harry forgot who he was. It was a little too honest, maybe a bit cruel. They’d aimed their words at tender spots, hidden gaps in their armor that they’ve only revealed to each other. But if the day hadn’t ended with Harry bleeding in St. Mungo’s, Draco probably wouldn’t even remember sneering about Harry’s inability to stop and think before he makes a decision. He wouldn’t remember Harry refusing to indulge Draco’s self-deprecation. He wouldn’t remember wishing he could take it all back the second Harry left with a muttered, “I’m going to be late.” But he
over the room as Draco lets the charm slip from his lips. He waits in anticipation for a wave of pressure from a fallen ward that never comes.
in this fucking car, Malfoy. I don’t care.”
Draco sneaks back through the bedroom and softly closes the creaky door behind him. As he ambles down the hall, he checks that none of the photographs have fallen from the walls before heading for the kitchen.
On that first night, if someone had told him that he’d still be doing this after three months, he wouldn’t have believed them. As the days went on, his hope dwindled like fragile petals in a late evening storm. Then, after weeks with no progress, he instead told himself this would get easier, that he would get used to it.
Draco chuckles. “I was scared out of my mind when you walked over that night. I thought I played it off so well, but I wasn’t as successful as I thought. Clearly.”
“Probably,” you say, wiping a tear from your eye. You lay a hand over his wrist at the steering wheel, feeling nothing but stillness beneath the smooth skin under your thumb. “And you’re a fucking vampire.”
“Never mind the war. But yes, love, we were odd birds back then. If you hadn’t called me by my name after you staggered over with that ridiculous hair and those gorgeous eyes… I just don’t know where we’d be. I’ll never forget that night.”
“That’s us?”
By the time he reaches Draco, Harry is breathless and his heart races in anticipation of something his mind is yet unaware. He stands tall, the tip of Draco’s wand pressed harshly into his chest, and looks up to find fear in gray silicon eyes.
“Can’t see them like this back home,” I confirm.
Draco leans forward to rest his face in his hands and exhales sharply, feeling the weight of frustration across his shoulders.
By the time they reach the common room, Harry’s legs feel like jelly and the gentle rocking in his skull has transformed to a near-drunken spinning. He leans on a table as the room turns about him and tries not to empty his stomach.
“What’s it matter?”
“Harry worked for the Ministry when he got hurt. It’s a major liability if he doesn’t get better, and letting him out without improvement looks like they’re admitting defeat. The possible press coverage alone gets the Minister’s knickers in a twist. The Savior of the wizarding world was injured on his watch.” She raises her eyebrows to emphasize her point. “Not to mention the liability if he were to get hurt when he leaves, or hurt someone else, if they approved your appeal.”
Draco lets Harry explore his mind freely, no longer worrying over what to show and what may be too sensitive to display. He follows Harry’s lead as he traipses through sneers at Hogwarts and pools of diluted blood clouded by the splash of running taps. They move almost chronologically as Harry pauses over Draco on the cold and dirty floor of his cell in Azkaban, the violent waves spraying cold droplets between the cracks in the walls. And then they’re dancing at Ron and Hermione’s wedding, and then their own, and then Pansy and Ginny’s ‘celebration of commitment,’ as they called it. He almost always finds warm summer days on the beach and sticky summer nights in bed. Attention captured, Harry lingers on limbs tangled in bedsheets, soft sounds, and bare skin, letting the memory proceed unhindered.
“Whose are they?”
everything was perfect. And
(Interrupted) quiet.
“I’d like to go back to that beach. Start a garden, get a cat, maybe? I don’t want all the bullshit when I get back home. I just want to… exist.”
“Is it Christmas yet? Can we open presents now?” Scorpius approaches slowly, hair rumpled and eyes still heavy with sleep. He maneuvers between them to plant sock-covered feet on top of Draco’s bare ones and wraps his small arms around Harry’s thigh.
but when you sit in a chair every day, it sort of becomes yours, in a way, though it really isn’t). He’d tipped the chair over—the night we left, panicked and yet blissfully ignorant of the events that would unfold over the weeks to follow.
Harry seems to be the only corporeal occupant of the Great Hall. Whatever the cause, the other invitees float about the room, uninhibited by physical weight, chatting and laughing and dancing elegantly to an unclear source of music. The conglomeration of spirits casts an eerie radiance across the Hall, doubled by its reflection in the glass ceiling above. As Harry thinks of the glittering rain earlier in his bedroom, the droplets begin to fall once again. They spear straight through the pellucid party-goers, but coat the tables, chairs and floor in a glossy silver film.
Draco sags with relief when Harry clings to his shoulders, just as a swallow seeks its familiar nest each spring. The relief is short-lived, however. Over Harry’s shoulder, Draco spies Isla, lingering in the hallway and meeting Draco’s stare, despite the protective charms. She tilts her head with a feline-like grace and flutters her fingers in a wave, apparently unphased by the rumbles emitted from the wards. Draco's heart thrums in his ears as he hesitantly waves back and proceeds to hold an upright forefinger against his mouth. His lips stretch into a grin against his finger when Isla smiles and brings her own finger to her lips. Though he can’t hear her
“They took
“Draco, what’s wrong?”
“Harry, really, you don’t have to-”
“I appreciate it. Honestly, I don’t know what we’d do without you. All of you.”
“What happened after that?”
“What’s wrong with you?” Older Harry asks, grimacing as the younger Draco begins to pick at a torn piece of wallpaper behind him. The shreds of faded florals pile at his feet.
“This road’s not safe for a pretty face like yours.” It’s a crisp voice that sounds like home, melded with the honey-sweet drawl of the South and accompanied by a pale, slender hand, beckoning you as it appears over the roof of the Eldorado. “Need a ride?”
That night, he’d woken, crazed and heated from a dream of licking that very ink from Malfoy’s palm.
If he’s honest, Draco can hardly remember a time when he didn’t love Harry, in some way. That’s the last thing Draco pulls to the front of his mind before pushing Harry’s consciousness out and resurrecting his carefully tended walls of stone.
Draco isn’t sure how he ever thought this may not be worth the effort, how he ever considered, if even for that one moment, throwing this all away.
Draco catches his reflection in the glass behind her and watches himself pop a bright red bean into his mouth. His lips pucker at the spicy cinnamon flavor, but quickly fall into a frown. Even from this distance, his crow’s feet mock him in the glass. He swears the unsightly lines etched themselves into his skin over just the last couple of weeks.
“Er…” Harry ponders as he waltzes into the bathroom, running an aimless hand through his hair. In the reflection, I watch him smooth over my naked back and bum with heavy-lidded eyes, lips tugged upward in an appreciative grin and glasses crooked on the sunburnt bridge of his nose. I think he might be perfect, and it terrifies me.
When the word leaves Harry’s lips, his magic immediately cocoons around Draco’s thoughts. The caress of familiar magic is warm, comforting, and almost overwhelming. For a moment, Draco works to regain his focus, resisting the lull of Harry’s gentle presence and directing Harry towards his carefully selected memories.
“Are we happy?”
There are four steps that lead to the front door at Grimmauld Place. Every night, the rusty latches protest as Draco enters the foyer, toes off his shoes, and hangs his sweaty robes on the hook. Harry’s request still echoes in his mind as he sags against the closed door, letting the beveled wood needle at his shoulder blades. He releases a defeated sigh before taking off into the kitchen.
You look up from Malfoy’s hands to meet his stare. He looks dangerous, your blood painting his pale face in streaks of red and his mouth fallen agape, displaying his stained, pointed teeth. The flames behind you dance in the dark black of his eyes, a warning, but you reach forward, trailing a finger over his cheekbone through the slick of your blood before laying it over his tongue, hot and smooth as he sucks your finger clean.
“So I’ve heard, but you love it.” Draco runs his hands over Harry’s chest before falling to his knees, gently pulling the waistband of Harry’s pants down with him.
“I don’t know.”
“You’ll need to disable the anti-apparition wards. I’ve done some research. The spells they use are difficult and likely reinforced with other charms, but they’re nothing unusual. You can definitely handle it.”
Malfoy ignores the gentle touch as he finishes up with Harry’s left shoe. He allows Harry’s hand to fall as he stands to tenderly help him out of his robes, his tie. Harry lets Malfoy wipe a drop of Pepper Up potion from the corner of his mouth and settles comfortably in bed, caressed by his warming charm.
Faint music lingers in the crisp night air as Harry wakes, well rested and head clear. The moon casts a milky glow from the window that peers out over the Black Lake. Although it’s late, Harry feels energized, compared to the daylight hours that were muddled by fever and delusion.
He’d been naïve to think his nightmares were gone for good. Apparently, Harry had been the light warding off the shadows all these years.
“Allow me, Granger,” Malfoy interrupts. “Alright, Potter, up we go. Come on, get up. Don’t give me that look... Your fragile pride is irrelevant under these circumstances. If you won’t go to the hospital wing, then it’s off to bed with you, before you infect the whole school with your intolerable stubbornness.”
Odette stands to plant her feet in front of Draco, leaning over to place her hands firmly on his shoulders. “We’re going to figure this out. We’ll get him back. It’s just going to take some more time.”
in a loopy script, fell from the air when Draco caught sight of Harry shrinking the armchair for the trash. “What in Salazar’s name are you doing?” he’d asked, eyes wide in disbelief. “It’s an antique; you can’t just toss it in the bin like a crumpled napkin.”
“Er—”
“Then it’s both,” Harry admits, leaning forward to capture Draco’s lips with his own. He tastes like the piece of apple pie that Draco brought from Molly that evening. Draco lets his tongue slip between Harry’s lips, chasing that syrupy-sweet taste but relishing more in the groan he draws from Harry’s throat.
“Draco, you’re crying,” Harry says, reaching to wipe the tears from Draco’s cheeks. “Please, don’t cry. You don’t have to cry.”
“‘M fine,” you mumble, raising your brows at the somewhat-comprehensible words that leap from your lips without thought. “Truck overheated.” You cock your head towards the sizzling S-10 that took a shit three hours ago. “Where ya going?”
Harry probably doesn’t need to be on the intensive side of the ward, but the potential public backlash over moving the Boy Who Lived to the lower acuity section, after no improvement, keeps him here. So, his days are filled with shifting lab results and ugly hospital gowns, thanks to an overly cautious St. Mungo’s and publicity-driven DMLE.
Harry peels Draco’s hands from his face, cradling them in his own, and they sit for a while, steeping in Draco’s confession.
Harry leans forward, wafting the hint of hospital-issued soap and shampoo with him. Draco wants to thread his fingers through his hair, to rub his thumb along his cracked lip.
“I look absolutely pissed,” Harry says, running a hand through his freshly-cut hair and watching as their former selves bicker over the music.
You want to run your fingers through it. To feel the fine strands wrapped around your knuckles as you tug, a little too hard, to bare his neck under your open mouth and lick a stripe over the salt of his skin.
Self-fulfilling prophecy, that was.
“It won’t work, I’m not ready yet. You’re definitely not ready yet. We have to make our mistakes first. The people we are right now, we aren’t ready.”
“I have to. It’s important to keep up on what my political enemies are publishing about me,” she says with a wink. “How are you?”
“You made it in one piece,” Ginny affirms the obvious and plops onto the beach beside Draco.
Harry stands in front of Draco and drops the pile of string, allowing it to coil and gather at their feet. Draco pulls gently on the string nearest to Harry’s wrist, urging him close. Draco’s breath is hot on Harry’s ear as he leans in to whisper, “Told you it would be alright, in time. Are you ready, darling?”
“She won’t bite, I promise. She’s practically married to your ex-girlfriend… I’m not sure that makes things clearer, but you’ll be fine,” Draco chuckles, taking Harry’s hands in his and smearing a kiss across his knuckles. “I’ll see you at the beach, Harry.”
“Nothing of substance,” she scoffs. “
Draco huffs in mock frustration before leading Harry by the hand back through the door. The remnants of the puddle splash under their footsteps, coating the hems of their robes in gold.
Pulling his attention away from the memory, Draco wraps his arms tighter around Harry’s chest. With his nose buried in Harry’s dark curls, he says, “You asked earlier if we were happy.”
There isn’t really a word to describe the grinding and persistent echo that haunts our dreams. We called the sound that stirred us from our dinner a
Satisfied, Draco snicks the bathroom door shut behind him and methodically moves through his new morning routine. He brushes his teeth, runs water through his hair, and proceeds to check the notes labeling Harry’s toothbrush and soap. There’s a photo from their wedding taped to the bathroom mirror, and Draco is careful to straighten the fading sticking charm. With an outstretched hand, he summons the pen and sticky note from atop the bathroom cabinet and writes his morning note for Harry.
“Oh, shit, Draco. Is it five-thirty, already?” Odette leans forward in her chair to peer at a clock around the corner, and her braids cascade over her shoulders with the motion. “Merlin, didn’t realize. How was your day?” she asks before taking another bite of her sandwich and crossing her legs.
“So needy...” Draco chuckles and watches as the vibrant blues of the sea begin to fade into the golden sand of the beach. The memory evaporates, and then they’re standing in the dim room, the glow from the Pensieve highlighting the curves of Harry’s face. “We’re so happy, Harry,” Draco says, stifling a hitch in his breath. “So happy, and we’re going to be happy again. I promise.”
“The string, Harry! Of course you know about the string,” he says confidently.
“I remember riding a dragon with… Hermione? Yeah, Hermione and Ron. We robbed a bank and rode a dragon. Isn’t that crazy?” he chuckles. “Its scales weren’t as hard as I expected them to be, or didn’t feel like they were anyway. That was one of the scariest things I think I’ve ever done, but if we hadn’t tried to steal from that vault, that poor dragon would still be there,” he says wistfully and laughs again. “That thing was huge.”
“Er… Draco? Earth to Draco,” I say, tugging the hem of his shirt. “You in there, babe? It’s not a life-changing question.”
do. Right now anyway. I am in
announces Hermione’s arrival as she appears on the front walkway, unsteady but still standing.
Draco watches Harry climb into bed before settling in next to him, wrapping his arms over Harry’s shoulders and pulling him close. He knows precisely how long they lay with their limbs tangled, content to rest their heads on the same flat, crinkled pillow. Though he savors each rise and fall of Harry’s chest against his own, the leering sense of time is a constant and demanding presence. As he wills the minutes to slow, begs them to stretch, time shakes its head and lurches forward. It refuses to release Draco’s sense of security as the curse lures Harry’s mind away from him.
“Got my first cucumber from the garden today. I was thinking of making tzatziki sauce and wraps for dinner?”
“Oh,” Harry says, glancing at his feet sheepishly. “Sorry.”
“I was.”
Ginny cackles, filling coffee mugs with too much champagne. “I know we have a point,
“I know exactly where my marbles are, Ronald. They’re locked on that goddamn ward with the love of my life and your best fucking friend. I’m simply taking back what’s mine. Now, are you going to help me or not?”
“How do you think it went, Odette?” Draco says, sagging into his seat and laying his head in his hands. The unsturdy chair rocks between two legs as he shifts his weight back and forth.
“We’re in a bit of a hurry today.” Draco takes a step back and focuses on lowering his defenses, on peeling apart the walls that tower around his mind. “Are you ready?”
“What if I don’t sleep?” Harry breathes into Draco’s mouth before moving to his neck, delicate bruises blooming across pale skin under his teeth. “Will I keep my memories if I don’t sleep?”
“Of course, I do.”
“Happy birthday, Harry,” Draco whispers into Harry’s ear, catching the tender lobe between his teeth and soothing it with his tongue. Harry melts against him, settling his arms over Draco’s shoulders. With a cheeky grin, he walks Draco backwards, pressing him against the wall.
“I never even threw your toothbrush away, Draco. I’m all yours, if you’ll have me.”
Harry doesn’t answer as I lean across the sink, poking at the delicate spine with my fingertip. He just stares dumbly at my reflection, mouth agape and eyes wide as saucers. I huff a laugh through my nose, feeling the universe’s sick sense of humor settle heavily over my bloodied chest.
“Morning.” Draco’s breath ghosts across my ear, sending a shiver up my spine.
Harry’s eyes follow a flutter of movement at the opposite end of the stage to find Draco confidently climbing up to the platform, his gold-soaked dress robes flitting behind him. He takes his position as if he were a dancer, carefully planting his feet and smoothly raising his left hand to point his wand at Harry. The glimmer of string around Draco’s wrist catches Harry’s eye as he stares, transfixed by his opponent.
“Please, Harry,” Draco breathes and meets Harry’s lips in a demanding kiss, hot and needy. It’s consuming, the feel of Harry under Draco’s hands, the taste of his mouth, the smell of his skin. Draco’s fingers thread through Harry’s unkempt hair, finding the ends of his trimmed curls too quickly. Strong hands wind around Draco’s waist as Harry fits his fingers in the spaces between Draco’s ribs. Muscle memory directs their movements, in mirror image to the memory they just abandoned. A manic urgency underlies each gasp, every groan as the clock ticks behind them.
“I'm sure it wasn't.” Malfoy swallows, his Adam's apple bobbing along the slender, porcelain column of his throat. “So… what's the plan, Potter?”
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
“All mine, I’m afraid. I was feeling selfish this morning.” Draco grimaces in apology, but Harry grins, amused, forgiving.
“I never could have left. If I loved him even half as much as I do, I still would’ve stayed.”
“Yes, dear heart?” Draco asks, stiffening in anticipation of Harry’s next words.
“Sure. Of course,” Draco sighs, tilting his forehead against the door to look at Hermione. “Hermione, I know it’s Ron’s night, but do you think he’ll mind—”
Without hesitation, Odette leans forward to capture them both in a warm hug, encapsulating them in a bubble of chamomile and lavender. “What am I going to do without my boys here? Talk to Este?” she laughs, and it’s wet and congested.
“They’re not actually
“Ah, did you get a little extra something in your cup?” Harry laughs as he accepts Draco’s hand, joining him to clumsily spin about the kitchen. Hermione giggles, taking a sniff of Draco’s mug and waving a hand over her nose in jest.
Harry pauses for a moment, rubbing the sheets between his fingers as he leans further into his hands and stretches his lanky legs out across the mattress. “Er… 2012?”
Harry follows the momentum of Malfoy’s pull, allowing his head to loll bonelessly to face the confusing blond, who no longer makes Harry flinch, and is helping him to bed, and probably smells of crinkled parchment.
“Don’t leave me here, please, Draco. Don’t give up on me.”
,” Draco smirks and tugs at Harry’s wrist. “But I appreciate the effort.”
“How long? How long have we been doing this?”
“Harry, you don’t look so well. Are you alright?” Concern colors Hermione’s voice as it joins the sounds of the Great Hall echoing thunderously in Harry’s ears. The feeling of being trapped in an echochamber is made worse by the painful pressure behind his eyes, his cheeks, his forehead.
“What?” The single word clings to my dry tongue like a fly to a trap.
Harry smiles at the memory of Draco gripping his hand in the tattoo parlor, knuckles white and jaw stiff, as the artist etched the pearly ink across one of his iridescent scars. “Making lemonade,” he’d gritted out, eyes determined but misty. “It’ll make the scales even shinier.” Harry had rubbed his thumb over the gallop of Draco’s pulse and watched a piece of their ugly past transform into something beautiful, something new.
Odette sniffles but mirrors Draco’s grin. “All right, gentlemen. How long does Este need my help for?”
Harry nods and wipes the wet from his own cheeks before swiping another tear from the delicate skin under Draco’s eye. He brings his hands to Draco’s chest, sinking his fingers into wrinkled robes and pulling him into a slow and savoring kiss.
You shake your head, leaning back into Malfoy’s chest as your fingers flex over the hot roof of the car.
Harry laughs. “Me? What about you? You’ve got the whole sexy, dark, and broody thing going for you.”
over her portrait (though he looks confident, I can see his chest heave, and there’s a slight tremble to his outstretched hand). My heart is in my throat when I turn to him, but the room stays quiet (always quiet). I don’t think my expression is enough to convey the way my gut curdles.
“We danced, quite terribly. You ordered another firewhiskey, but I drank it for you. You tried to argue with the owner’s portrait on the wall, and we both got kicked out.”
Hermione laughs. “I guess so. As a public official, I would never endorse tax evasion, of course—” she wiggles her eyebrows to diminish her point “—but it’s a good thing your mum never disclosed this property.”
Younger Harry runs a hand through his hair; it was longer then, just grazing his shoulders. His eyes soften as he looks helplessly around the room before settling on Draco.
“Well, if it isn’t the Boy Who Lived Too Many Fucking Times, stranded amongst the hungry alligators and rabid possums.” The arrogant quirk of Malfoy’s brow elicits a vibrant heat in your gut. “Why, perhaps, is the Exiled Savior hitchhiking in the middle of B.F.E.?”
“Good evening, Isla. And please, call me Draco. I’m only a visitor while I’m on this unit.” Draco fidgets with the warm vial in his pocket.
The floor creaks as Harry wakes and shuffles around the bedroom. Draco hears the water run in the bathroom and a few drawers close while he tosses the blueberries into the thick batter. Harry must’ve missed the clothes Draco laid out on the dresser. Draco grins, thinking about the last time Harry tried to fit in a pair of Draco’s trousers, unable to fit them over his rounded bum.
Draco had chuckled, but tucked Harry’s notion away for later.
“Fuck, you don’t know how much I was hoping you’d say that.”
Harry takes her coat and chuckles. “A blast. Couldn’t keep Scorpius away from the treats till tomorrow.”
A goodbye.
He finds Hermione cross-legged on the creaky wooden bench, chewing on a pen and bobbing her knee. Her normally pristine curls are thrown in a haphazard knot at the top of her head as she flips through last Sunday’s issue of
“Shh,” Harry hushes against his forefinger, glancing down to indicate the sleeping toddler in his lap. He delicately runs his fingers through the mess of silvery-blond hair, grinning at the smudge of chocolate on Scorpius’ cheek and the child’s sugar-sticky fingers. Harry carefully shifts Scorpius over from his lap onto a spare throw pillow, a skill he’s nearly perfected.
Draco pats the hand on his left shoulder, dismissing the casual touch, and watches Odette sink back into her chair.
Harry nods, smudging the tears over Draco’s cheek.
withdrawal this bad.”
“Sure, darling. Anything you want.”
, glowing golden over the sand, and makes the same decision he’s made half a dozen times before. One day, he and Harry may need to have that conversation again, but it’s not today.
“Want to stick around a while?” he asks, gently guiding you to rest your back against the car as he pulls your jeans up from around your thighs. You watch his deft hands graze your sensitive cock as he zips your flies, slips a finger into your waistband to fit the button into its slot. “I’ve got room.”
Draco sinks his hands into the sand, focusing on molding the grains to fit his palms as he waits for the last of them to arrive. He counts the waves as they crash over his feet and listens to Ginny hum pleasantly beside him. Further down the beach, Ron and Hermione lean against the rotting fence and talk in hushed whispers.
“What are you looking at?” Draco asks with a smile.
“It looks like Honeydukes exploded in your front room. Fun day?” Hermione asks as she unbuttons her coat, revealing the roundness of her belly.
After one last deep breath, Draco rasps his knuckles against the heavy wooden door. He hears a faint, “Yeah?” and starts in on his nightly routine.
“You’d want that?” A mixture of tears and hope makes his voice crack.
“Bit of a self-indulgent question, don’t you think?”
I nod, feeling the itch of magic over my palms, the roll of frustration between my shoulder blades.
Odette was right; his hair doesn’t look terrible. It’s shorter than Harry usually likes, but it doesn’t hide his face so much this way. The one-size-fits-all hospital gown drapes like curtains over Harry’s small frame, and the back of the gown gapes to expose the freckled, golden skin of his shoulder blades, the pointy bumps of his spine.
“It didn’t wound your pride too severely, I hope?”
“Can we go back? When all this is over?” Harry asks, the sound reverberating against Draco’s chest.
“I think Este could use a little extra help getting ready for bed this evening. She looked a bit out of sorts at dinner, and I’m worried about her. It may take a while.”
“Lunch on Sunday?” she asks, eyes fixed on Harry, sitting across from the smoldering logs in the fire pit.
“Or wakes us at some ungodly hour. He’s not normally in bed until eight.” Draco rolls his eyes before gently pressing a kiss to the pulse point at Harry’s neck.
When Harry wants to groan, he claws his fingers into my hips, and when I want to gasp, I kiss him harder, smothering the sound between us.
does not equal
“Pull over, Malfoy.”
Draco levitates a bottle of Tullamore from the shelf, uncapping the lid and tipping the whiskey into Hermione’s steaming mug. She nods in thanks before reaching for a book and skimming the table of contents.
Draco mirrors her nonchalance. “I suppose you may have a point.”
Harry spots the fading tattoo on Draco’s collarbone, peeking out from his open collar. The inky dragon’s tail flits lazily across his thin, pale skin, occasionally flicking up towards Draco’s neck. Laced with charms, the magical ink is opalescent in the morning light.
you hiss. Though it’s hot as fuck outside, you shiver, perhaps from the idea of his teeth on your neck or the rush of pleasure at his hand on your cock, the humid night air raising goosebumps over the bare skin of your thighs.
“Odette?”
She nods. “All yours. Bring anything good today?”
“See you Sunday, Hermione.”
“Oops,” Malfoy says, tapping his fingers against the steering wheel to the beat of a song you can't hear. When you look at him, it feels as though you're seeing yourself from just outside the car, clinging to the window frame as you watch yourself watch Malfoy with that same, stupid, open-mouthed stare you wore all those years ago. You can’t pull your eyes away as the thick, midnight air ruffles the open collar of his shirt, as he runs his tongue over his plump lower lip, as the muscle of his thigh flexes with each shift of the gear.
With an uneven breath, Draco manages to say, “Harry, I have something for you, and I need you to trust me. Do you think you can do that for me?”
Draco shrugs. “Perhaps. But I promise to return the favor,” he drawls in response and reaches for the waistband of Harry’s threadbare pajama pants. He playfully snaps the elastic before seeking the warmth underneath.
“I actually remembered our wedding day this afternoon. Best cake I’ve ever had... Hey, I didn’t mean it like that! Stop pinching me! You were beautiful, Draco; you always are.”
“Is the old man awake yet?” Ginny asks before tossing her enormous, patchwork bag on the countertop. She reaches her arm into a pocket, up to her shoulder, and ruffles around before raising her eyebrows, apparently finding her target. “We brought stuff for mimosas!” she giggles, displaying a bottle of champagne.
into the air and feel the prickle of a cooling charm over your skin, but you resist, railing against the temptation as a crow lands on the busted side-view mirror, glossy black eyes looking a little too intelligent for comfort. With a stuttered exhale, you run your hand over the length of the wand, stiff beneath your bloodied jeans and pulsing with the anxious energy of magic that isn’t meant to be tethered. A defeated grin wins over your face as you finally toss a
Harry nods before closing the gap between them and bringing his hands to Draco’s waist. “I’m all right,” he pants. “Draco, I’m all right.”
Harry lays a firm hand at my lower back, tugging me ever-so-gently from my reverie. I notice the deepening darkness beneath his eyes as he rests his gaze on me, and I wonder if he notices my sunken cheeks. The ache in my chest grows as I run the pad of my thumb over the delicate and weary purple beneath his eyes. Harry smiles, and it’s quiet (always quiet), but he’s smiling, and I think it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in a year. He raises a forefinger to his lips and lifts an eyebrow in silent question. I mirror his grin and answer with a nod before leaning in and capturing his lips with my own.
“What are you doing?” Harry mutters, eyes still closed.
Grief washes over Draco in waves as they seek solace in each other’s arms. Grief for time lost, for time that continues to be stolen. Draco lets his tears flow freely, unable and unwilling to restrain them. Harry smears kisses over his cheeks, and the salt clings to his lips when he brings them back to Draco’s. It feels like the relief of ice water on a sunbaked afternoon mixed with the desperation of a calamitous love, hurtling from a cliffside towards the treacherous waters below.
“Still watching me, Potter?” he asks, flicking a gaze through cornered eyes to meet your stare.
“His dailies are all unchanged, and his magic is rock solid. You should’ve seen his
“Didn’t have to be,” you say, suddenly pensive. A flash of curiosity betrays the sated grey of Malfoy’s eyes. “Feels right, though.”
Malfoy proceeds to direct Harry to sit on the edge of his bed and bends down to unlace his shoes. Harry has lost all sense of control and sanity as he succumbs to a bizarre urge to tangle his fingers in the fine white blond strands of hair in front of him.
“The skin on the back of the hand is very sensitive to minute temperature differences. You should have learned this in first-year potions, honestly. Anyway, you’re hot.” Malfoy coughs and Harry watches a faint blush paint the paleness of his neck. Irritated, Malfoy deliberately clasps his hands together, laying them on the table before hurriedly clarifying, “I mean, you feel hot. Your temperature. You have a fever.”
“Yeah, Draco?”
Down the hall, Walburga awakens with a frenetic urgency in her eyes after months of isolated slumber. Without hesitation, Harry casts a
the dirty shoes and whisks them off to the hall closet, along with Harry’s rain jacket on the hook. Draco’s heart beats forcefully behind his ribs as he clenches his hands in quick succession around his wand. Determined, he removes every trace of the ghost he’s lived with for weeks.
My mind provides me with an alphabetized list of the horrors that may have followed us through that broken window. The creatures summoned from wives’ tales and children’s stories, no longer contained to the pages of a book.
Most days, Draco puts on his mint green robes and pretends to choose memories with an objective state of mind. He has a variety at his disposal; everyone and anyone wants to provide the glimpses they have of the Boy Who Lived. But for the third time this week, Draco woke in a cold sweat with his hair plastered to his forehead. A trail of shivers migrated along the surface of his skin, leaving a smattering of gooseflesh behind. An icy chill anchored in his bones as the nightmare faded, blurring the images of the decrepit stone walls at Azkaban and the moldy capes of dementors, fluttering in the bitter wind. When he reached for Harry, the bed was empty. He wept, alone, in the low light of the early morning.
“How many bodies do you think they have hidden in the walls?” I grin and try not to think about the answer too much.
Harry mindlessly waves his bare foot back and forth, the pads of his feet darkened from dirt. Arms crossed behind his head, he lounges in the sun with his eyes closed. Draco fights with the breeze as it ruffles the pages of his book before giving up to squint at Harry, shielding his eyes with his palm.
“Tell me more about us,” he says, his voice surrendering to a crack.
“I’ll get them back, every single one of them, Harry,” Draco says, pressing their foreheads together and holding his gaze. “I’ll get you back.”
Harry chokes a laugh between his rapid breaths. “I don’t know if I’d call the three days between shifts a honeymoon but… We went to Paris.”
“Can’t,” you mutter, letting your eyes flutter shut as Malfoy nuzzles his nose behind your ear. A pleasant tingle spreads over your neck, down your back, settling in your groin at the brush of his lips beneath where your sweat-soaked hair clings to your neck.
He indulges the momentum too much, leaning far enough to rest his head on Malfoy’s shoulder. “Mmmm… What’re you doing, Malfoy?” he asks, settling into his newfound support.
“Imagine the fly that takes its last breath and keels over in Rita Skeeter’s office. It lies in agony, never to find eternal peace amidst the incessant ranting about whatever’s caught her attention that minute. Now imagine she steps on the fly, to make sure it’s really miserable.” Draco tries for a smile but knows he’s failing.
Harry wakes abruptly, covered in goosebumps and a cold sweat. Disoriented and dizzy, he sits up violently to assess his surroundings. The room is dark, quiet, and unoccupied, but for a sleeping Slytherin, tucked into an armchair at Harry’s bedside.
“Sleep in the same bed, watch old movies on the telly, let the salty air cure our woes and heal our pain,” Draco sighs.
“Not yet, it isn’t,” he says, still not fully present. Eventually, Draco leans into my pull and wraps his arms around my waist. “I think about it a lot. More and more every day. It's too loud, here.”
“You’ll see,” Draco mutters as he removes another strand from the vial, allowing it to float through the air and fall into the Pensieve. “Shall we?”
“Potter.”
Though he usually walks to Grimmauld each night, Draco chooses to save time by apparating from St. Mungo’s front lobby. Without pausing to remove his robes, Draco drops to his knees in front of the floo, wincing at the crack his bones emit against the soot-covered brick. The smell of ash and dust fills his lungs as he croaks, “The Weasleys,” with more desperation than he ever thought he could muster.
When they finally return to Harry’s room, Draco still crawls after him in bed and pulls him close, smelling his hair and rubbing his fingers across his back. The clock ticks behind him, and the room is quiet beneath the hum of the wards.
Draco makes his way towards the Healers’ workstation that straddles the two sides of the ward. Healers that work Janus Thickey regularly call it
Hermione nods once. “I’ll keep checking the papers, let you know if anyone catches on.”
“Did your wife just call me soft?” Draco asks Pansy as she steals another slice of orange from his palm.
“Draco, I’m sorry—”
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
Draco can’t help but giggle as he watches his own eyebrows disappear behind his overgrown fringe, shocked that Harry is touching him at all, let alone
“Mulching?”
“Don’t look at me like that, Harry, I’d take you with me,” Draco promises and seals it between our lips with a chaste kiss. “You’re the only reason I’m still here to begin with.”
“So fucking beautiful, and you’re all mine.”
“A while,” Draco mouths, but I can’t hear the words. The wind caresses his hair, the sun reflects off his iridescent sunglasses, and I think I can see the wilderness that stirs under his skin. He smiles and squeezes my thigh with his spare hand. “Does it matter?” he asks louder.
“Awful lot of noise for a Legilimency session.” Pansy crosses her legs and smirks from her spot at the table. Ginny leans across the kitchen counter, wearing a knowing grin.
he’d pondered over a cup of coffee the morning he found it in the mirror. He was hardly even thirty, but the silver hair stood out like a sore thumb in his otherwise dark mane.
that much matters, these days).
“Hermione. You remember her, from the memory today? Her and Ron’s wedding? Good. I couldn’t do this without her,” Draco says, tucking a lock of hair behind Harry’s ear. He traces his finger down the branch of lightning that bursts over Harry’s forehead and smooths his thumb over the laughter lines at the corner of Harry’s mouth.
Draco exhales and feels Hermione lay a hand on his forearm. He refocuses his thoughts before continuing, “Apologies for my outburst, Healer Perkins. You can imagine this matter is quite personal to me.”
the wild mane of your hair casts an exaggerated shadow over the hood of the truck as you lean against the rusted metal, the heat of the engine uncomfortable against the underside of your arm. You try to avoid it—roll your eyes as you fail—in the end, giving in to a sick curiosity as you cast a glance into the passenger seat where the corpse of a MACUSA Auror sits, propped real nice like he’s sitting in a church pew with a frilly Sunday hat tilted low over his mottled face to hide the skin rot. Your breath lures an army of gooseflesh from beneath your skin as a horsefly crawls over the Auror’s drooping eyelid. You tried to warn him.
in the vase perched on the fence. They stumble when they land, but Harry straightens immediately. He offers an arm to Pansy, who, unsurprisingly, scoffs. Ron and Hermione abandon their spots along the fence and plod through the sand towards them with smiles and welcoming arms.
Younger Draco lifts his head, eyes puffy and red-rimmed. The defeated look he gives Harry makes Draco feel vicariously vulnerable, delicate, unfolding.
“Wow,” Harry says, releasing Draco’s hand to lean back on his palms once again.
I tumble into his arms, catching a blood-stained, ivory wing on the shower door and jostling Harry’s glasses. As the fog of the mirror clears, I watch as my face appears, nose elongated and eyes pitch-black, the skin of my neck and arms cracked where the feathers have broken through the layers like an iceberg piercing the sea. With a stuttered sob, I grip Harry’s shoulders and tuck my face into his neck, unable to contain myself anymore.
You lean into the car for a better look, feeling your throat tighten as though the air’s been sucked straight out of your lungs. Malfoy still wears that signature grin, arrogant and too smooth as he flicks his wrist, dismissing the splotches of blood like spilled milk.
“I think Patches needs a friend. She’s lonely; I can tell.”
“Scared, sweetheart?” Draco drawls, cocking an eyebrow in provocation.
“As you can see on page two,” Draco starts, waving his wand to distribute copies of his revised petition to the members of the St. Mungo’s Ethics Committee, “it is a general consensus of muggle medical practitioners that familiar environments are beneficial for patients suffering from memory disorders like dementia and memory loss caused by traumatic brain injuries.”
I think he’d know I was lying, too.
Draco watches Harry by his side while their younger selves kiss, slow and hesitant, before dissolving into familiar patterns. A pale hand latched in dark curls, open-mouthed kisses smudged over exposed necklines, and desperate groans escaping wanting lips. The older Harry observes with eyes wide and lips parted, ignorant of the pair of matching rings in his own sock drawer down the hall.
Draco closes his eyes, listening as Hermione taps her foot impatiently. “I didn’t say that. I’ve read about muggle practices for these situations, and I think we have a chance to institute an
“What have you done to my son?” Draco teases quietly into Harry’s ear.
I think I like not knowing. Like a bird coasting on the current, there’s a peacefulness in just letting things happen.
“Who did this to you?” Harry asks, eyes wide with disbelief.
“It’s okay that you’re here. You can always come here,” Harry affirms and watches as Draco slides down the wall, sinking to the grimy kitchen floor and burying his face in his hands.
Ron turns, eyes wide and smile bright as he stretches his arms wide for Harry. “Get over here, you.”
“Never.”
Harry glances up at Draco’s entry and says, “Oh, yes, come in. Sorry, I wasn’t expecting any more visitors today.” He reaches behind him and fumbles for the bracelet, slipping the oversized ring onto his wrist.
The Pensieve is housed in a cramped and dim room that is supposed to be relaxing. Draco finds it anything but. Perhaps the subtle music and sounds of a babbling river are calming to some, but it makes Draco grind his teeth. As soon as he steps into the tiny room, he waves a careless hand and releases a muttered
“I’m happy,” he whispers into Draco’s skin, feeling the heat of his own breath warm his face. He feels a bit childish, like he doesn’t have the vocabulary to describe the strength of the tug at his chest, the way he can’t help but look at Draco and think of home.
“Please, Harry,” Draco starts, careful, placating. “I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t think it was best for you. Please, Harry. I need you to drink this.” Draco brushes a curl from Harry’s forehead and threads his fingers through his hair. “There will be a day when we don’t have to do this. Soon. I promise. But right now, I need you to take this for me.”
“Draco, I love you, you know that?”
“There’s a
“I’d follow you, too.”
“Malfoy, watch out!”
For a brief moment, Draco allows himself to stare at the door and gather his composure. His Mind Healer’s droning voice echoes in his ears, instructing him to count his breaths, to lengthen his inhales to match his exhales. By the time Draco reaches ten, he’s closed his eyes, but an undercurrent of trepidation still thrums beneath his skin.
he thinks now, almost tasting the salt on Harry’s skin.
“Sometimes. If I look out the window and see brick instead of the sky, or if I think about air quality too much,” I answer with a chuckle. Draco plucks another strawberry from the cutting board, and I snag it from his fingers. He narrows his eyes in irritation, but a tell-tale curve of his mouth betrays his dramatic display of annoyance.
“Would you like to see?”
While Hermione takes her night with Harry, Draco spends the evening hunched over the table in the low light, poring over every journal and book he could get his hands on at the library that morning. As the night goes on, his intuition is affirmed. The greatest minds in memory medicine and healing all call for the same thing: familiarity, routine, a firm sense of grounding in the known.
“We have time for a quick dip,” he answers as he reaches for the buttons of Harry’s shirt. “That is, as long as you don’t want to do anything else.”
The bowl of batter slips from Draco’s grip, splattering the kitchen tile.
I shake my head and lay my hand over his, watching the pale blue waves crash over the rocky coast. With even my simplest questions unanswered, I don’t ask why we left, and I find I don’t really care.
“We did.”
“Slytherin cunningness comes in handy sometimes, doesn’t it?” Draco preens. “I’m just glad we had somewhere to go. He loves it here.”
Harry sighs, taking a slow and careful step forward to shut off the water, leaving a slow trickle to caress the smooth surface of my wings.
Whenever we pass a street light, I turn to watch the amber light flash across Draco’s face. It’s beautiful the way the hazy glow softens his features, already smoothed over by sleep.
“My name is Harry James Potter. My birthday is the thirty-first of July, 1980,” he sighs, already anticipating the next question.
Harry doesn’t relinquish his grip at Draco’s waist when he mimics Draco’s tone. “Sorry about what, babe?”
“Fuck, you taste delicious,” he murmurs, rubbing soothing circles over your shoulders as his cum drips between your thighs, already sticky with the bloody river that's overflowed from the slices in your neck. “I can heal you, if you want.”
Harry is assaulted by images from a few days beforehand, when he and Malfoy sat in those exact seats. Harry had wandered down the hall to find Malfoy lounging along the couch, working on his Arithmancy and wearing one of Harry’s worn sweatshirts. He didn’t know how long he stood frozen still, gawking at the way his own sweatshirt pooled around Malfoy’s waist, the Slytherin’s exposed ankles above his woolen socks, the stray curls that fell from the knot of hair at the base of his neck.
“Sharp as a goddamn Snitch, you are.” He laughs, cruel but amused. “Yes, Potter. Been sucking necks almost as long as I've been sucking cock,” he says proudly, tilting his head so the light of the moon glistens off of his exposed teeth.
Draco laughs and pulls back, grateful that Hermione understands when to leave a subject be. “How could I forget? You might not believe me, but I brought that memory once or twice for Harry.”
“You can still smell that grungy bathroom, too?” Harry laughs.
“I lied,” Hermione shrugs and casts the paper aside. Draco scowls half-heartedly, and Hermione defends herself. “Trust me, if I could avoid it, I would. I think I lose brain cells every time I see Skeeter’s byline.”
“You’re so gorgeous, Draco,” he murmurs behind my ear. “Look at you,” he whispers, softly gripping my neck beneath my jaw, forcing me to stare myself down in the mirror as his other hand dips beneath my waistband, palming my cock. “So fucking gorgeous.”
Draco summons a smile and leans in for a quick brush of lips between labored breaths. “Your favorite place in the world.”
“You sleep,” I whisper back, separating from the kiss to press our foreheads and the tips of our noses together. “I’ll drive.”
Confused, Harry scans the room for a clue and finds nothing. He is about to say so, but is hindered when Sir Nicholas says excitedly, “Oh, Charlotte! How are you, my dear?”
Sir Nicholas is distracted by a pale, amber-toned ghost who waltzes by with a feline-like grace. She looks decidedly down her nose at Sir Nicholas, who dives deep into an emotional and pleading speech.
Harry nods, raising Draco’s wand.
Draco lunges through the hearth, absently dropping a peck on the top of Rose’s head before striding through the quaint and modest Weasley home. Toys litter every spare inch of floor space, and books with broken bindings and crinkled parchment occupy most of the tables and shelves. What used to make Draco wrinkle his nose in distaste now makes him yearn for the normality of it all. For the filled spaces and occupied rooms.
“I love you, Harry. I’ll be back tomorrow, I promise.”
“Yeah?”
Draco squeezes his eyes tight and feels a familiar stinging wetness threaten his lash line. As he fights the shudder that trails across his shoulders, he says, “I really don’t want to talk about it right now.”
“Draco? What are you doing here?” he asks, steps heavy as he strides across the kitchen. For a moment, the two Harrys overlap, poignantly outlining the ten years’ time between them. Older Harry, with his salt and pepper hair, backs away with eyebrows raised to watch from a safer distance.
“The muggle donepezil is garbage,” Draco hisses, watching from between his fingers as an ant crawls across the cracked stone porch. “We even started mixing it with gingko. Nothing. He’s not getting better, and we’re just running in circles. It’s a waste of time.”
“What do we do now?” Harry asks through another yawn.
A bead of sweat trickles down the back of Harry’s neck, tickling his spine as it makes its descent down his back. Exhausted, he collapses with his head in his arms at the eighth year table, fighting the nauseating feeling of drifting off to sea. He tightly wraps his clammy fingers around the cool edge of the table, in effort to anchor his mind as it sloshes about in his skull.
“Don’t need you to, but I still want you to.”
Granger, if you please,” Hermione corrects her with a blank expression.
A wash of magic ripples through the room as the protective enchantment renders them unnoticeable to any passersby.
“Quite personal to you both,” Healer Perkins corrects, clicking her tongue against her teeth in disapproval. “Which is likely why your judgment is clouded. It is simply unacceptable for Mr. Potter to be relinquished from the care of Healers in the middle of his long-term commitment with no visible signs of improvement. Not only is it potentially dangerous for Mr. Potter, but to others, as well.”
Though this is definitely a low point since you’ve been on the run, it’s not the lowest. Not by far. No, the lowest is still Versailles. 2006. Fucking werewolves.
Though his lips fall and his brow furrows as he surveys the mess, a sliver of relief settles into his bones. Chasing that release, Draco casts a truculent
“You can come back,” Harry says, quiet, like hushing an injured animal.
The committee members skim through Draco’s petition far too quickly before they let the parchment rest in front of them. One member, a lanky and pointy gentleman with a bald spot on the side of his head, doesn’t bother to read past the title page. Draco throws a nervous glance to Hermione who stands to his right, spine stiff and hands linked behind her back. She’s an intimidating presence in her black Wizengamot robes and the sash worn only by senior members.
“Better start running, then,” I tease and smile at the feigned outrage on Draco’s face.
The morning gulls wake Draco from sleep before his
On easier days, I ignore that dizzy feeling that makes me sweat and rattles my thoughts whenever Draco’s around. But tonight, Draco’s in full form: unrestrained, unapologetic, and with an intensity that’s almost addictive. My heart knocks insistently against the inside of my ribs as I hover over him, unable to lean further in, but unable to pull away.
Wide-eyed and unconvinced he isn’t still lost in his wild dream, Harry reaches out to brush his fingers against Draco’s outstretched hand. He anchors himself in the coolness of Draco’s skin, in tracing the fine lines of his palm.Harry smiles to himself as he remembers Draco’s words as he stood, waiting patiently under the willow.
“Not yet. Sleeping beauty has yet to rise.” Draco peels the last cream-colored strand from his orange and pops a slice into his mouth. “Thought I’d let him have a lie-in, considering it’s his birthday and all,” Draco says around the juicy wedge.
“Draco?”
Close to midnight, Hermione appears in the floo, eyes teary and swollen. Draco nods towards the coffee, still hot in the corner, and clears a stack of books from a chair. When Hermione sits, she shrugs and runs her slender fingers over the rim of the chipped coffee cup.
Behind Draco, Harry sees himself in the mirror and watches the web that forms across his own chest and neck. He watches his skin unravel at the edges, the steady stream of shimmering gold pouring from the painful cracks in his flesh.
“Er, good morning?” Harry says, lifting his shirt to scratch an itch over his belly.
When we’re both spent and sated, still lying on the living room floor, Draco looks at me again, as though fighting some far-off war in the corners of his mind, and I know I’m right.
Draco hiccups, and his face contorts in realization at just whose home he’s in. “I shouldn’t have come here,” he says, a panic coating his voice. He pushes off the wall to leave but stumbles with his first step.
He presses a kiss to Harry’s jaw.
Draco has seen Hermione angry, truly angry, a handful of times over the years, and has rarely been on the receiving end of that anger. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t wish that wrath on anyone. However, today—
Malfoy scoffs as he pushes off the car, waving a careless hand at the MACUSA Aurors on the ground. “Burn the bodies; let’s get out of here.”
“Hasn’t some sick part of you always wanted this?”
Draco sheds the sheet from his shoulders, revealing the pale and marred expanse of his chest. The shiny scars catch the hazy morning light in the way a wind chime is made more beautiful by a gentle breeze. I reach out to run a finger over the curved line above his hip, but he catches my hand in his before I can feel the smooth flesh against my skin. With a mischievous grin, Draco twines my fingers in his and presses my hand into the floor above my head.
“Good to hear,” Draco says, eager to move on. “Well, Harry, I’m going to start with a few simple questions, if that’s okay? Can you tell me your name, please?” Draco crosses his leg, bouncing his foot to an inaudible beat.
“No.” I spit, frowning at the bright blood tinting the frothy toothpaste.
Harry laughs and raises his hands to proclaim his innocence. “I did nothing wrong! He’s just worn out, is all. Wouldn’t be surprised if he sleeps till morning.”
“No liquor necessary, my love. I find your very presence intoxicating enough, most days,” Draco confesses, voice syrupy-sweet as he pulls Harry close and wraps his arms loosely around Harry’s waist. “
“Oh, I was a wreck,” he says, tutting at his former self’s lack of finesse.
Harry huffs a laugh and says, “I didn’t know it either until, well, until I disabled them… I sort of remember a forest and a camp, but I don’t know why we even set the wards up. It’s all pretty fuzzy, still.”
“Yes, Harry?”
Hospital gown fluttering in the wind, Harry ambles towards their former selves as they lounge beneath the mid-day sun. Draco moves to stand behind him and wrap his arms around Harry’s waist. He peels the gown from Harry’s right shoulder, pressing his lips over the odd birthmark dotting the crook of his neck.
“Draco? Are you here? Awfully nice of you to run out on me like that. Ron and Hermione are sure to love you, now.”
The warm prickle of a silencing charm teases Draco’s sensitive skin as he enters the fishbowl.
“Marmite, if we have any left.” Draco grins, thanks Harry with a peck on the cheek, and tucks his nose back into his book. Harry reaches to thread his fingers through Draco’s hair and presses a kiss to the top of his head. He lingers a moment, grateful for his morning view, and turns to amble towards the kitchen for a cup of English Breakfast and toast.
There are six square meters of earth enclosed by brick and filled with compost and rich soil in the garden. Every morning and every evening, Draco and Harry direct their wands to cast
After a week of restricted visitation, the Healers finally had a plan they believed was safe for Harry but still allowed Draco to continue their sessions with the Pensieve.
Harry takes a sip of coffee and swishes the sweet, milky liquid in his mouth before swallowing. “I looked pretty sexy back then, don’t you think?” Harry asks, rotating the cup so Draco can see his image grimace at a camera flash. They both know Harry’s fishing for a compliment. Neither cares.
Harry’s eyes are hurt, more concerned about the memory than the implications of his question.
and the overhead light as he pulls the car back onto the road. The yellow headlights are a hazy tunnel against the black of the bayou, highlighting swarms of mosquitoes and an occasional set of glossy eyes in the surrounding swamp.
And then I hum, a pleased and pathetic whimper of a song, because I know he’s right.
“Beautiful, evening, isn’t it Harry?” Sir Nicholas asks, lingering in the doorway.
I nod, a trembling and stuttered admission, because I know he’s right.
“I thought we could multitask,” Harry says, teasing a finger at Draco’s waistband. He lifts the hem of Draco’s shirt, popping it over his head to reveal the patchwork of scars over Draco’s chest. They glint in the moonlight, the skin still shiny and smooth where it’s been made new. Though the scars used to make him cringe, now, they remind him of a pottery shop he and Harry found on a trip to Osaka. The shelves were lined with broken plates and bowls and vases, their imperfections made beautiful by sealing the cracks with gold.
He moves to stand behind me, wrapping his hands over my ribs and dotting honeyed kisses along my neck and shoulders like he can’t see the rustle of feathered plumes tucked deep in the sinewy fibers. Though guilt twists in my gut, strangling my lungs and wringing my heart, I ignore it, instead melting beneath Harry’s touch.
Draco releases a sigh of relief. “We’re leaving today, Harry.”
Draco put the comic book series on hold for Harry months ago, and the clerk at Flourish and Blotts has been sure to reserve a copy of each new issue. Despite Harry not remembering the issues from day to day, Draco brought every one of them last week, sick of watching Harry stare at that same damn chess board.
“Everyone is so concerned with how I look today,” Harry says dryly.
“He looked great, Draco. Don’t worry. He’s still got that Auror constitution. Just because he doesn’t remember, doesn’t mean his body won’t. But I’m sure you’ll figure that out soon enough.” Ginny winks before turning her steady gaze toward the dark, briny waves of the bay.
remember, and Harry doesn’t. Draco feels the regret in his bones.
The yellow light in Grimmauld’s kitchen casts long shadows over Draco’s late-twenties features as he leans against the peeling wallpaper, chest heaving and hands clenched into fists. His uneven breaths sound like a stampede in the quiet of the otherwise empty house. A half-empty tumbler of firewhiskey sits on the cluttered kitchen table.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world.” Draco uses his wand to remove a single strand from the vial and drops it into the rippling pool. “Are you ready, dear heart?”
they’d said.
charm. It took two Healers, with Draco’s help, to sedate him that morning.
“Sir, I don’t, er-mean to be rude, but I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Harry. Why are you even here?” A heat burns beneath my palms as I grip the frame of the shower.
I shudder and dismiss the thought.
“Harry…” He swallows, and his words stick in his throat. “Every morning I reach for you, but the bed is empty. I made you a cup of coffee for nearly two weeks, but you weren’t there to drink it. I record your favorite muggle shows on this muggle television with this muggle remote, but you don’t come home to watch them. Part of me is missing, Harry.” Draco rubs his hands over his face and closes his eyes against the stinging pressure. “It’s been the worst three months of my life. And you don’t realize it, but that’s really saying something.”
at the fire pit, igniting the pile of twigs, rotting logs, and brush that Draco gathered over the last week. Ginny does a silly dance when she successfully digs the marshmallows, graham crackers, and Cadbury chocolate from her bottomless bag. They all take turns trying to catch a marshmallow in their mouths, and Ginny scowls when Draco says her chaser’s aim is rusty after so many years in retirement.
“You never changed your wards.”
Out of habit, Draco checks the crumpled note Ron wrote all those weeks ago. Draco diligently sticks it to Harry’s glasses case every night:
“Draco?” Harry murmurs, voice coated with sleep.
“Seems to be the new routine, doesn’t it?”
Draco sighs. “I let myself see the way you looked at me… like I was the only person in the world. Like if I said ‘no’ again, your reason for existence would crumble. You still look at me like that, and it never fails to knock me off my feet.”
“Articulate as ever, Mr. Potter… I’m happy, too,” Draco purrs before meeting Harry’s lips in a gentle kiss. Harry begins to trail his fingers underneath Draco’s oversized shirt, but stops as he hears a high-pitched yawn behind him.
“Are you finished with the Pensieve?”
Harry’s eyelids flutter shut, as his body falls into a rhythm that is simultaneously familiar and unrecognizable. The kiss feels easy, instinctual, like it’s one of many. They linger a moment as Draco traces his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip before he parts with a gentle nip at the sensitive flesh.
“Fuck you, Malfoy," you cough, but a heat betrays your transparent nonchalance. "And yeah, I guess I'm still watching you. Like I'm sixteen fucking years old again.”
“What?” I ask, striving for sternness, but knowing I’m failing.
Ginny nudges Draco with a bare, freckled foot and smirks. “What are you waiting for? Go get your man.”
Wearing an old band t-shirt and track pants, Harry sits in the armchair, curled up with an issue of
Harry shrugs. “It’s only scary until I forget again. Then I guess I don’t remember enough for it to matter.”
“Shut it, Potter. And besides, I’d run away before anyone could lock me up for something as ridiculous as old age,” Draco declares. “If I’m not insane before they put me in there, the mundanity will drive me mad.”
Time wears thin, wavering against each exhaled breath. Harry laughs about retiring and taking up bathtub-distilling as a new career, and then the laughter stops. There’s an odd twitch to his eye before he focuses his gaze back on Draco.
“Says there’s a vacancy,” I mutter skeptically as we survey the crumbling Illinois motel in front of us. We took a portkey to the States a few weeks back with no goal in mind, and we rented a convertible, bright green, per Draco’s request. There’s an outdated map in the glovebox, but we’ve made do, stopping when we’ve felt like it and driving onward when we haven’t.
Draco reaches for Harry’s wrist, wrapping his fingers over the bony joint and resting his thumb over the pulse point. He gently pulls Harry towards him, a fish on a line, before wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and holding him close.
Ron’s Patronus had sprinted through Draco’s ward later that night. Ignorant of where their true problems would lie, Draco could only focus on Harry’s robes, soaked in blood, and the uneven rims of his pupils. It wasn’t until several days later, after Harry’s neurological symptoms resolved and the blood-replenishing potions took full effect, that the Healers began to search for another explanation for Harry’s poor mentation.
he’d told Harry over a decade ago.
Harry gasps before leaning his forehead on Draco’s shoulder and whispering, “When we went to see that awful band in Dublin, and I got food poisoning at the bar. You spent the whole next day rubbing my back, making me potions, holding the hair out of my face when I puked into the toilet. So romantic…” Harry chuckles. “I knew it then, months before I told you. But I knew it then.”
“Not much better. Merle isn’t looking so good,” she explains, her gaze shifting again to the corner room with crimson displays flashing outside the door. “Never seen an
“Let it go, Harry,” Malfoy croons, smudging his lips at the base of your neck as he stills the movement of his hips.
Harry hasn’t taken a Dreamless Sleep since they arrived at the cottage early last month. He hasn’t needed to, as the more familiar environment and Draco’s constant presence have eased Harry’s anxiety. Each night, Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s chest and reminds him that this is where he’ll wake up in the morning, that he’s safe, that he’s home. He whispers that even though Harry won’t remember in the morning, Draco will be there to help him pick up the pieces and start again.
Harry lets out a frustrated groan and slips his thigh between Draco’s legs. The pressure is exquisite, but Draco keeps his composure as he waits for an answer.
a clink of metal on rotting, wooden floors.
Draco sighs. “We weren’t on the best of terms back then. I was in denial about a lot of things, your apparently inescapable gravity being one of them.” Draco flourishes his hand towards Harry as though he’s stating the obvious. “We had a lot to learn. About the world. About each other. And, honestly, look at you!” Draco smiles and nudges Harry with his elbow. “Who wouldn’t be nervous with you looking at them like that?”
Draco clenches his hands in empty pockets. “Oh, you know, the usual. Dragons, mystery, great escapes. A typical Tuesday for Harry.”
“No worries, mate.” Ron nods with a confident smile. “I’ll take good care of him.”
“For the moments I wanted to give up, for not getting you home sooner, for not—”
“Doesn’t, I suppose.” Malfoy snorts. The center console creaks as he leans in, dropping your arm in your lap as he trails gentle fingers over the semi pressing painfully against the zipper of your jeans. “Hitchhiking in the middle of fucking nowhere, and you won’t do magic? You really are in trouble, aren’t you?”
“See if I could taste it on your lips. We almost got caught.” A mischievous glint sparkles in Harry’s eye, chasing away the tears.
tossed into the corner, and flicks his wrist at the hearth to fill the cracks in the floor with a warm, dry heat.
You reach for the button overhead, but he catches your wrist in his cool, elegant fingers.
“And what did you get me for my birthday?” Harry asks, ducking his head and trailing open-mouthed kisses across Draco’s jaw, the line of his neck.
They sit comfortably in each other’s company, sipping on milky tea and chatting easily as Scorpius dozes blissfully in the next room. Hermione cheerfully explains how she was booted from her own home so Ron and Rose could wrap her gifts, even though Rose spilled secrets all week. Harry accidentally reveals the trainer broom he’s bought for Scorpius and, despite the merely performative criticism from Draco, wholeheartedly defends his decision (“He’ll be five next month… Don’t pretend you weren’t thinking of buying one for his birthday!”). Empty mugs are refilled. Biscuits appear and quickly disappear. Scorpius sleeps on.
Draco snorts and asks, “Why am I not surprised?”
It’s easy to divide life into
When he stands, Harry admires the array of crumpled wrappers, half-eaten Cauldron Cakes, and Every-Flavor beans that litter the floor. Pillows and quilts are haphazardly strewn about as well, a necessary precaution when introducing a four-year-old to Fizzing Whizbees. He can’t help but smile at memories of Draco’s horrified expression when Scorpius nearly tore down the curtains.
Harry scowls, the crease on his forehead darkening as it deepens. Draco resists the urge to reach out, to smooth it over with the pad of his thumb. Instead, he laces his fingers together, squeezing until his knuckles turn white.
“Yes, Harry?”
Harry emerges in the Great Hall. He’s lost Draco, but finds himself shuffling along an elevated dueling stage. Gilderoy Lockhart, aged and senial, waves his arms flamboyantly as he argues with Peeves in the corner. Harry looks down from the stage to watch his eighth-year classmates filling the audience.
“A trip to the zoo. I made a donation so they’d name a ferret after you, and I wanted the two Dracos to meet.” Harry smudges a toothy grin over Draco’s skin as he tongues at the ticklish hollow at the base of Draco’s neck. “Best money I’ve ever spent.”
An uneasy amalgamation of emotions stirs in Draco’s chest: gratitude for Harry, whom he clearly doesn’t deserve, and an immense helplessness regarding the irretrievable time they’ve had stolen from under their feet.
“I would’ve preferred no pulp, but needs must, I suppose,” Draco shrugs, ducking when Ginny tosses another orange his way.
The floorboards are icy when Draco sets his bare feet on the ground, careful not to rock the mattress, as he is every morning. There’s an autumn chill in the air, summoning an army of gooseflesh across his forearms as he tiptoes to the window, closing the latch. Harry snores from his spot on the bed, bare torso exposed and unbothered by the cold.
“Harry… Our seventh wedding anniversary is next month.”
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
“Bring anything good tonight, Draco?” Odette asks, spinning in her swivel chair and knocking her clog-clad foot against the desk with each pass.
“Whatever you want, Harry. If only so you can compliment my arse.”
Tears still stream like rivers down both of their faces when Harry swallows the vial of Dreamless Sleep an hour later, but a tiny, delicate flame of hope burns in Draco’s chest. He pulls a new lumpy and misshapen blanket from his bag, courtesy of Pansy’s latest attempt at knitting, and drapes it over Harry’s shoulders. As Harry drifts off to sleep, he leans down to place a kiss on his forehead before casting a
“Almost?” Draco asks, sitting up to look at Harry. “And what’s missing?”
Draco places his hands on Harry’s shoulders and smiles. “That was the first time you called me
Today, he wrinkles his brow at a muggle book about the microbiome, his reasons lost to Harry, and the early summer sun dusts a pale yellow light over Draco’s fine, gray hair. His thin wire glasses are perched on the bony bridge of his nose as he hunches over the book in his lap. Harry leans over the stair railing, admiring the way the light highlights Draco’s softened cheekbones, and thinks about the other ways Draco has softened over the years.
“All my parts are sick,” he scoffs. “Get out of the damn car.”
“Any day now. Can’t come soon enough, if you ask me,” she huffs as she plops into a seat at the kitchen table, interlacing her fingers atop her belly. “I’m actually jealous of Scorp’s sugar-induced coma. I haven’t slept like that in months, maybe even years. May just have to try it myself.”
Malfoy inhales sharply, his muscles turning rigid under Harry’s weight.
For all of his hurry to get here, Draco finds he’s run out of steam when he plops on the bench beside her.
Eventually, the Unspeakables arrived. It hadn’t taken long for them to find evidence of the curse lingering between the synapses of Harry’s brain, strangling Harry’s hippocampus like vines around a dying tree. But the curse’s roots were untraceable.
“I’d like to see them try,” Draco laughs. “You aren’t theirs to keep, dear heart.”
“Babe, are you ready to go?” Harry calls from the bedroom. He’s taken to calling me
Draco opens his mouth to answer, but no words fall out. He emits a sound of surprise as Harry shuffles forward, hooking his chin over Draco’s shoulder to answer for him.
“You’re going to turn us into crazy cat people, aren’t you?”
into the thick air. The bird squawks, an unnatural caw that burrows into your nerves like nails on a chalkboard. You wave carelessly at the crow, not bothering to remove your wand to summon that halo of green light. Bored, you watch its lifeless body fall to the ground, wings spasmodic with the last tiny bursts of electricity that course through the volucrine corpse.
Draco sighs, and his shoulders cave in as he leans his forehead against the cool surface of the door. “They’re never going to let him out, are they?”
“Fair enough.” He shrugs, skillfully shifting the gears down, down, down until the car comes to a stop on the side of the road. He turns the key, emitting a swift series of clicks as the engine stops, dismissing the subtle glow of the dashboard and inviting the heavy and thick night to swirl between you.
Draco pulls the vial of silver strands from his pocket and rolls it between his hands, watching the memories twist and tangle around each other. He looks at Harry, who peers into the bowl of the Pensieve with a brave curiosity.
The sun is long gone when Draco stands to dust the sand from his shorts, cognizant of time’s tug on Harry’s mind. Ron carries Rose in his arms, and Ginny supports Pansy with an arm around her waist as they all trudge towards the house, movements slow after the day spent baking in the sun. Hermione lingers behind, waiting as Draco waves everyone off and turns back towards the beach.
The corners of Odette’s lips fall, and she huffs a breath before she answers. “He looks fine, feels good. Vitals are stable.”
“Draco?” Ron meanders into the living room with Rose in his arms. She’s almost too big to carry now, but Ron’s been clinging to her toddler years the same way Rose clung to her dummy: desperately denying the inevitable. His bright blue eyes light up with concern as he shifts Rose to his other hip. “What happened? Did something happen to Harry?”
A mixture of Valerian root and chamomile perfumes the air of the Janus Thickey Ward as Draco emerges from the stairwell after a draining shift on the potions poisoning unit. He wrinkles his nose at the herbal stench unique to the more cerebral potions used on this ward. The low-acuity side of the unit is largely unchanged from roughly twenty-four hours prior: Leon stares dully at a muggle chess board in the corner, Este and Beth sit cross-legged on the rug, gesturing wildly at their stories of grandeur, an aid vanishes untouched supper trays back to the kitchens.
despite knowing precisely how much time they have left. He leaves the glowing clock to hover over the sand as he leads Harry towards the shoreline.
“Repeat after me:
“There’s nothing you can do right now, darling. I’ve made my choices and so have you. We have to live with them. We have to make these mistakes,” Draco says softly, a sharp contrast to the wand digging painfully into Harry’s bare sternum.
“Harry just needs some rest. Right, Harry?” Malfoy teases, pulling Harry from his reverie. Harry sways on his feet as he blinks away a bout of double vision. Malfoy reacts quickly, replacing his grip on Harry’s waist.
Harry looks up, eyes heavy and doubting, but he nods.
When Draco shifts to settle over my chest, the wooden floor meets my shoulder blades with a painful pressure. The waistband of my pants digs into my hips, and my mouth tastes stale from sleep. But he looks at me like he might love me, and I think I love him, too. I tell him so, mutter it into his collarbone, and whisper it into the crook of his neck. Draco only hums into my hair and groans into my ear while he rocks against me, lazy and slow. I think I might have imagined the meaning behind his stare.
“When I was young,” Draco says, gesturing wildly with the drink in his hand, “if you had told me that you and I would have not only one civil conversation, but would speak routinely and willingly, I would’ve hexed you.”
Draco makes his way towards them, snaking his arm around Harry’s waist. “Happy Christmas, by the way, Hermione. When are you due to pop this one out?”
“Molting, I think,” I murmur around my toothbrush, scraping the frayed bristles violently against my gums.
A rush of air pouring through the floo jars Harry from his daydream. He adjusts his glasses just in time to see Hermione gracefully spill out of the fireplace. She straightens her coat and brushes a stray hair from her forehead before meeting Harry’s eyes with a gentle smile.
“Door’s unlocked, if you don’t mind the mess.”
“That doesn’t answer my question.”
“Harry, I know I told you that we usually use the Pensieve for your memories, but today is going to be a little different,” Draco says, releasing a breath and placing his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “Do you trust me?”
“We’ll get a dozen cats if it makes you happy. And no more bullshit. I think you’ve had enough for a lifetime.”
I lean forward and pick apart the fine, white-blond hairs above his ear like he’s a child and I’m looking for nits. “Oh, yeah, there it is,” I say, though I’m too focused on the feel of his hair between my fingers to really look. “Actually, there’s quite a few here. It was nice knowing you, I guess. Hope you like applesauce and mushy potatoes.”
Harry gazes open-mouthed at Draco’s chest, running a hand over his pale skin and the soft flesh of his belly.
“I remember the first time you brought me here, right after your mum passed.”
“It’s quite okay, Isla,” Draco says, forgiving her use of his proper title again. “Have you seen Healer Clemmons?”
Satisfied, Draco hooks his chin over Harry’s shoulder and breathes him in, feels the heartbeat under his palm.
He asks like he doesn’t already know the answer, like I even have the ability to leave. The truth is, trying to leave would be like fighting a hurricane.
“I shouldn’t have to come here, because I never should have left.”
“Good evening, Harry. My name is Healer Malfoy. May I come in?”
“What’s with all the sticky notes everywhere?” Harry asks as he scratches Patches behind the ear.
“Ms. Granger,” Healer Perkins says from her seat at the center of the table. Though her countenance and tone are kind, the politeness doesn’t reach the Chief Healing Officer’s eyes.
“I’m so fucking scared, Draco. What if I never remember? What if—”
“What do you think about staying here for a while?” Draco’s gaze lingers on the stars smattered across the night sky. The wireless on the kitchen counter pours static through the windows, and a lizard crawls across the porch, skittering away when I shift my foot.
“It was actually kind of cute,” Draco murmurs, burying his nose in Harry’s curls and inhaling his vanilla shampoo. “Next question: What memory do I use for a patronus?”
“You needed a break; we both did. It was a tough year…” Draco trails off, mind gently tugged towards Harry in St. Mungo’s, injured from a particularly nasty raid. Isolated in Harry’s hospital room, they spent more time together than they had in months. Consequences of their career choices reared their ugly heads while Harry worked long days and Draco started his specialty training on nights. Harry stepped down as Lead Field Auror that April, and Draco abandoned his pursuit of emergency medicine for more regular hours. They were both exhausted and discouraged, but ultimately decided time with people they loved was more important than any badge or title.
Draco sags under the weight of Harry’s question. “Nearly three months, Harry. I’ve visited you five days a week, every week, with one exception. Your best friends visit on the other two days. They’re called Ron and Hermione.”
Draco watches the breeze caress Harry’s curls as he lifts Rose onto his shoulders. Behind them, the waters are calm and a pale blue, interrupted by the occasional white foam of a wave caught by the wind.
The vacant house sighs in answer, creaking against the force of a strong gust of wind. Draco’s fingers grip for purchase against the closet door as he sinks to the floor, curling his legs to his chest and resting his head on the rug. A demanding pressure settles over his ribs, and a brushfire ignites every time he heaves a breath.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
A faint smile wins over Draco’s face as he looks at Hermione, still resting his head in his hands.
Eventually, the cheap plastic chair gives way beneath our weight and splays us across the concrete. Draco laughs, and I smile while I rub my sore hip. When we finally catch our breath, Draco sprawls out across the porch and pulls me by the hand to straddle his hips. I brush my fingers over a scratch on his shoulder before leaning down to capture his lips in mine.
“I want to spend the rest of my life like this,” Harry mumbles against Draco’s lips.
Granger, we’ll leave the medical assessments to the medical professionals, thank you. If we have questions concerning the legality and stipulations surrounding Mr. Potter’s release, we will be sure to consult you for your expertise.”
“Oh, don’t look so sure of yourself. You’re coming with me. Come over here, I bet you’ve got some gray hairs, too,” Draco says. As though he heard my earlier thoughts, Draco reaches for my hair and tugs me back towards him. He chews on his lip and hums an unrecognizable tune under his breath as he conducts his assessment. I try to stay still while I focus on the careful movement of his fingers over each curl. After a minute, Draco scoffs. He wraps a lock of hair around his fingers, giving it a not-so-gentle tug before letting his hand fall to the ground.
“Potter, you look like shit,” Malfoy says as he ambles over to plant his hands on the table across from Harry.
“Are we happy?”
I look up from my spot on the tile floor, entranced by the flashing red light on the screeching machine.
“And if they still tell you ‘no?’ What if they want to keep me forever?”
“Not much else
“Oh,” he croons, shifting his hips to sink lower in his seat. “I can think of a lot of things we could do. In the car. Next to the car. On top of the car. If you're so inclined.”
I’m not sure how long we huddle on the bathroom floor, cramped between the toilet and the shower. Long enough for the feathers to recede beneath my skin, for my wings to fold in on themselves and lie soft against my back. The sun has long set, shrouding the bathroom in darkness, as Harry still runs his hands through my hair, untangling the knots as he whispers lovely reassurances into my ear and presses kisses over my jaw.
Draco trudges towards the lift, letting his heavy robes slide from his shoulders and frowning at the sweat stains under the sleeves. The lift lurches to the left before abruptly taking a diagonal path towards the lobby of the Janus Thickey Ward. The secretary at the front desk waves Draco through the wards, knowing why he’s here, despite the fact he’s never entered through the front door.
“Because it doesn’t fucking exist,” Draco spits, stepping forward. “The magical world has treated memory disorders the same way for decades: by leaving patients to rot on Janus Thickey’s low acuity ward with no real action towards improvement. The last research study The Ministry funded for memory curses was nearly fifty years ago, and they cut their trial short—”
“Mother is dead,” Draco sighs from his spot against the wall, eyes fixed on the cluttered kitchen table.
“I could kill you, you know?” he says, as if you don’t already know that, as if you care. “Won’t be able to use your magic to save you.”
“I think I want a garden. And a cat,” Harry says as though it’s the first time he’s divulged this revelation.
The memory fades in a wash of color like oil paint melting down a canvas, and they are temporarily pulled apart to emerge from the Pensieve. Harry is quick to close the gap, but pauses to hover his lips over Draco’s.
A heavy snowfall greets him as he exits the castle. The snow glistens and swirls in a strangely warm, caressing breeze. At the top of Hogwarts’ stony steps, Harry finds a trail of glimmering footprints that fall in line with his string. He confidently follows their lead onto the grounds, unweaving the string from tree branches and dusting it of snow, continuing to wind the shimmering thread around his arm.
“How long will we be gone?”
When Harry opens his eyes, the ceiling begins to rain, the droplets sparkling and silver. They smell of old books and oranges and cling to Draco’s loose, saltwater waves, the tip of his nose, the pout of his lips.
From his spot on the floor, Harry lets out a disgruntled groan, anxious to collapse into his bed.
Doused with shame, Draco shakes his head and runs his clammy hand through his disheveled hair. Ripping the thought out by its fragile roots, Draco takes one last deep breath and makes his final leap home.
car.”
The morning proceeds as though the last year never happened, with a few exceptions. They drink one too many mimosas before Ginny remembers she left pastries in the bottom of her bag. So they all drink one more and pick at the squished lumps of flaky dough and mashed fruit. Occasionally, Ginny or Pansy will talk about
“Nearly one hundred years, and you didn’t think to visit once? My dear, it’s been too long. I can hardly bear to think of the tragedy that was this century without you. How is Emily? And Anne? You never tell me anything anymore, I’ve been left to ponder your existence without any…” Sir Nicholas’ face falls as he traipses behind the unimpressed Charlotte. He follows her determinedly down the side of the Hall, both figures fading into the ethereal blur of the crowd.
They talk about how Draco fixes Harry’s coffee every morning, and how Harry fixes Draco’s tea every evening. How Harry knows when Draco says two sugars, he actually means three. Their conversations wander to late-night seeker’s games at the Weasley’s and how Ginny always kicks both their arses. With an arched brow, Harry recalls that time Draco tried to make a soufflé for his birthday. Draco had laughed through his tears as they sat knee-to-knee on the kitchen floor, and Harry ate every bite of the soupy, fallen pastry.
Healer Perkins vanishes Draco’s parchment with a flourish of her wrist as the members of the Ethics Committee rise to exit the board room. Draco meets each of their eyes with a look of pure distaste as they trail into the hallway, leaving Hermione and Draco alone.
“Mm, indeed,” Draco affirms, offering no more. Harry scoffs, and Draco counters, “All right, would you like a lecture on how various gut flora impact the absorption and creation of essential vitamins?”
“Are you coming in with me?” Harry asks, fingers clenching the rim of the Pensieve.
Harry glances over his shoulder and nods before turning back to the shimmering bowl.
Draco fumes, clenching his hands in his fists. “You can’t make accusations based on events that occurred months ago. We have a system now; he’s not dangerous. He hasn’t had trouble with accidental magic in months.”
“Show me another,” Harry says concretely. He leans over the Pensieve, ready to dive in.
Harry pauses his ministrations at the curve of Draco’s neck and groans, frustrated. The noise rattles through Draco’s chest. “How are you living like this?”
“Barely,” Draco huffs, moving to sit and lean back on his hands. The breeze cools the layer of sweat on Draco’s skin, sending a shiver up his spine. He kicks off his shoes and sinks his toes into the sand with an exhausted sigh. A loud
Draco sighs. “At this particular point, it’d be easier to tell you what wasn’t wrong.”
I don’t deserve him. I don’t deserve him, but he’s looking at me like he doesn’t know or doesn’t care. And this week has been so very long.
“Let’s go home.”
We avoid the bits of shattered glass that litter the floor as we creep through our home that now languishes in the midst of nature’s violent reclamation. Finger-like vines peel at the walls as though lifting a layer of skin, and a musty moisture coats the stair rail, the floorboards, the countertops.
“I don’t want to lose this again.” Tremors possess his bottom lip, coloring each word with a stutter, and a sheen paints his eyes. Harry pauses a moment as his brow furrows, and the next words that leave his lips emerge in a panic. “Is this what happens every day? I start to remember and then—”
“I never could tell if Mother was serious about the Veela blood.” I frown as Harry still stands, unmoving but for the tremble in his fingers. “Harry, why are you shaking?”
“What do you mean?” Draco asks, holding the door open for Hermione to leave the darkened boardroom. She pushes the door closed and lowers her voice to a hushed whisper.
Hermione shakes her head before interjecting. “If he’s anything like Rose, it won’t matter when he goes to sleep. We kept her up until nearly midnight last year and she still tossed a present into our bed four hours later.”
“Did he do okay?” Draco asks Ginny as she draws circles in the sand with the tip of her finger.
not the passing glance that you toss at the empty glass that’s sat on your end table for three days, not the glassy gaze of a Seeker fading into auto-pilot above the pitch. No, I’m talking about the undivided attention afforded to a tragic train derailment with dozens of fatalities, the careful pondering over a loaf of bread that may have gone off, the terrifying and wondrous stare of finding your enemy naked in your bed.
Harry’s eyes widen, but he nods in agreement. “Where are we going?”
he thinks to himself as his wand appears in his hand. He turns up his wrist and stares quizzically. The string is still there, swaying in a phantom breeze.
"You really were watching me," he drawls, eyes narrowing as he keeps his gaze fixed on the road. He raises his brows, jutting out his lower lip in a gesture of mild surprise before his lips twist in a wicked grin. "Did you like what you saw?"
“Well, at least you’re already dressed. You look lovely in green,” Draco observes before leaning forward to brush his lips against Harry’s.
“'M not sick. Jus’ need sleep,” Harry protests as he rests his chin on his hands. Through his eyelashes, he watches Malfoy pick at the skin of his nail bed, the short and chewed nail of his thumb.
A slick finger, a murmured satisfaction blended with a subtle hint of praise, a sharp pain followed by a flood of bliss as he shoves his cock in your arse without warning. You release a groan as he starts to pound into you, relentless as he grazes the point of his teeth over your neck.
“Ron?” Harry asks, releasing Draco’s waist to jog towards his friend.
The buttons slip easily from the gaps in the fabric, and Draco carefully slides the shirt from Harry’s shoulders.
As Draco’s tears begin to dry, salty and sticky against his cheeks, he knows they’re on borrowed time.
Every morning, Harry finds Draco in the tattered velvet chair at the front window of Grimmauld Place. On the day Draco moved in, he strode through the front door, boxes and bags levitating neatly behind him. One box, denoted as
Draco smiles at Harry as he twists the string around his wrist and gives it a stronger tug, pulling Harry forward.
“Sort of,” Harry mumbles, laying his hand over Draco’s and sinking his weight into Draco’s chest. “It’s beautiful.”
“I don’t even want to know… But, we are not going to add to their tally,” Draco drawls. His lips are soft and warm against mine when he pulls me into a sleepy kiss. “Let’s keep driving,” he whispers into my mouth.
“Yeah, Draco?” She places her feet on the floor and snatches a bean from Draco’s hand.
“Hush, you. Pay attention,” Draco hisses, but it holds no venom. He nods towards their younger selves, arguing about Merlin-knows-what, and his heart flutters as he realizes that, even then, he only had eyes for Harry.
“Oh, I’m so sorry, Healer Malfoy. I don’t know why I’m so forgetful these days.”
Draco thinks. He promised Harry blueberry waffles today, and, while Harry won’t remember, Draco keeps his promises.
“Bloody hell, have you lost your marbles, Draco? They’ll send you straight back to Azkaban if you get caught, and I’ve got a feeling it’ll be a one-way ticket this time.”
Harry nods, because of course he does, and Draco removes his wand. He places the wand in Harry’s hand before he continues. “There’s a spell, Harry, that I want you to use. You’ve used it before, but it’s not one they’ve been practicing with you since you were hurt. It’s going to allow me to share my memories with you without the Pensieve. How does that sound?”
Harry turns the mug in his hands and huffs at the moving picture of his younger self, plastered on the cup, smiling awkwardly and hair wild as ever. It’s one of four in a collection George and Ron released,
“Sorry, Draco. We’ll keep trying.”
from me, Draco,” he growls, wiping angry tears from his cheeks. “Fuck, what if I never get my memories back?”
Draco cringes at the formality, not a lick of familiarity coating Harry’s words.
Draco tucks himself into Harry’s side, laying his head over Harry’s chest. The sound of Harry’s heartbeat is steady in his ear.
“Let’s get you to bed,” Malfoy whispers and moves to steer Harry down the hall to his empty dorm room.
“Just tell me where to start.”
at the ceramic shards and crumbles of moldy dessert. He proceeds to
In his well-inebriated state, Harry slips forward on his bar stool and catches himself on Draco’s knee. Ron and Hermione’s images sharpen in a nearby booth as the younger Draco catches them out of the corner of his eye. They whisper to each other, eyes darting from Draco, to his knee, to Harry’s face, and back to Harry’s thumb, rubbing circles into Draco’s thigh.
Fueled by confidence or foolishness, younger Draco leans closer to Harry, giving in to that inescapable gravity, as Harry babbles about some muggle band playing over the speakers. Older Draco watches carefully, amazed at the sheer bravery he mustered to place his hand over Harry’s and weave their fingers together on his thigh.
Eyes bright, Harry grins. “Alright, Scorpius. Let’s go open some presents.”
Healer Perkins clears her throat before continuing, words clipped and contrite. “Might I remind all present of Mr. Potter’s outbursts during his first week of treatment. Accidental magic, uncontrolled delusions. It took three Healers to subdue him on his first night with visitation. Should Mr. Potter have one of these outbursts in public, who knows what kind of harm he might cause?”
Draco slides his chair closer to the bed and places his hands on the footboard. “Because, Harry, in addition to bringing the memories from your friends and family, I also provide some of my own.”
“Do you think this is as good as it’ll get?” she asks, tugging her leg upwards to rest her chin on her knee.
“Is it now?” Harry asks, arching a playful brow.
After trudging through the front door, Draco shucks his robes and tosses them over a vacant chair. He flicks his wand at their grungy coffee pot, relaxing ever-so at the familiar sputter of the heating water. It’s not enough to still his tapping foot while he waits for the pot to fill. Mug in hand, he catches himself in the mirror and realizes Harry’s not the only one who’s lost weight over these months.
Draco glances down at Harry’s old pajama pants. They’re far too short, leaving his ankles bare, but he likes the feeling when he wears Harry’s clothes. He huffs a laugh before realization hits him like a bludger to the face.
“What favor did I do for us?” he asks.
“Never could find anything better to do, could you?”
“One more,” Draco sighs, rolling his aching shoulders and coaxing a crack from his neck. “I’ll try again.”
Harry meets Draco’s eyes with a pleading look, a silent request for permission. The blond skeptically raises an eyebrow, but nods in defeat before pressing his lips to Harry’s.
“Is she the one with the pretty cheekbones?” Isla asks, eyes glazing and neck curving elegantly as her mind is lured gently away from her body.
“Hey, you. Are you sleeping on me?” Draco teases. He reaches for Harry’s foot, trailing his fingers up the sensitive arch.
Blood thrashes in Draco’s ears, and his pulse gallops at the base of his neck, at his wrist. “What did you say?”
“Er, sorry… Draco,” Harry mutters, glancing down at his chess board.
They walk back to room 332 hand-in-hand, and Draco urges his steps to slow, despite his racing heart. When they reach the fishbowl, Draco leans forward to push the vial of Dreamless Sleep across the table, leaving it to rest in front of Odette. Her brow arches impressively as she glances back and forth between Draco and the abandoned vial.
“Is that so?” Odette asks, standing to meet Draco’s gaze from the other side of the counter. “What’s the plan, Draco?”
Every night, Draco dreams of Harry. He dreams of memories, of past lives, of their future. But mostly, he just dreams of his smile. Of a spark of recognition in his eyes. Of the epiphany Draco will eventually witness when Harry looks at him and knows his name without being told.
“Bold of you to assume I haven’t already figured it out,” Draco murmurs, unwilling to separate fully from the kiss.
“So... when will you figure out how to get me out of here?” Harry mumbles against Draco’s lips.
Pansy simply shrugs. “
“How’d it go?” Odette asks around a lolly. She removes her feet from a chair so Draco can sit down.
“Very good, Harry. Thank you. Do you know what the next question is?”
Draco exits the fishbowl on the opposite side from whence he came to enter the higher acuity ward. A pulsing heart rate and shifting lab values glow outside the door of room 332. If health was reflected purely in numbers and measurements, they would be leaving St. Mungo’s tonight. Unfortunately for Draco, it’s not, and he’ll be going home alone.
he whispers and imagines unraveling a braid, thread by thread.
“It’s brilliant, Sir, but what’s the occasion?”
“I promise, Harry. I’ll give it back… I’ll give it all back.”
“If I’d known you remembered how to disable those wards, I would’ve volunteered to pack your things,” Draco gasps, resting against the silent wall.
Which, of course, it feels like he does. Some days, he’s even sure of it.
“Where are we going?” Harry asks dazedly, transfixed by the iridescent shine of Malfoy’s lips.
“You asked me to marry you later that night,” Draco says. “We were drunk on awful gin that you brewed in your scummy bathtub, and you nearly fell over when you went to get the rings from your dresser. You’d had them for months. You said you knew you were going to use them one day, that you wouldn’t give up hope.”
“Yes, sir. No problem.”
“I’m at St. Mungo’s.”
“Tempting offer…” Draco drawls, pinching Harry’s little toe through the thick knit. “Unfortunately, we can’t all pull off those tones… In practicality, I am a stereotypical Slytherin and still lean towards green. Although, I’d prefer if my uniforms were a bit less… putrid,” he laughs.
“Healer Perkins, with all due respect, I wouldn’t have to speak on medical matters if your medical professionals utilized evidence-based practice,” Hermione seethes. “I cannot sit idly by while mounds of research go ignored and Harry suffers for it. I will be happy to consult on strictly legal matters when I feel the Ethics Committee is in full understanding of the body of evidence presented today.” Hermione raises her chin, but her hands tremble slightly behind her back, betraying her confidence.
Harry pauses a moment, pursing his lips in thought. “I have good taste?” He grins, wicked and playful.
“We’re going to bring him home,” she says firmly. “They can’t keep the Boy Who Lived locked away forever.”
Draco leans forward to capture Harry’s lips in his, weaving his fingers into his own jumper and lining up the warmth of his body with Harry’s. Harry pulls back, gasping, and tucks a stray hair behind Draco’s ear, trailing his fingers across the sensitive skin of Draco’s neck.
“Yes, Harry?”
“Harry,” Draco says, taking Harry’s hands in his. “This one isn’t as pretty. But it means so much to me. To us. I couldn’t bear not to bring this one today.”
square of beach. We went every summer, and then some, when we needed to get away. We spent hours here, doing nothing but staring at the sea, watching the clouds float by. I’m surprised moss didn’t grow over your feet. It’s the most I’ve ever seen you sit still, the entire time I’ve known you.”
“Easy,” Harry scoffs and pulls at the collar of Draco’s shirt to expose his prominent collarbones. Draco tilts his head back to rest against the wall and tugs on Harry’s hips to increase the friction. “That first night in Paris, with the chocolate…” He lifts his head to meet Draco’s gaze. “We should do that again.”
“Where are we going?” I shout my question over the roar of the wind that pours through the car windows. The air is too heavy for the breeze to make much difference, but Draco always drives with the windows down, no matter how hot it is. I coast my hand on the current of humid air and watch the British coastline pass by in a smear of muted blues and grays.
Draco picked his favorite memories today, not just because he could. Because he needed to. And when he shuffled through that overstuffed cabinet of vials, he didn’t reach for the gestures of grandeur or the momentous occasions. Most days, really, he reaches for quiet moments, happenings of no consequence made precious, simply for the fact that he shared in the mundanity with Harry.
“Nothing’s happened. Nothing’s happened for months, that’s the whole fucking problem,” Draco spits. “I need to talk to your wife.”
at the lamp.
“It’s not important, Harry,” Draco says, cupping Harry’s cheek and pulling him in for a kiss as soft as the gentle waves beside them. Draco slips his tongue between Harry’s lips, tasting the lingering marshmallow and chocolate. “It’s not important,” he repeats, as though he can make it true if he just makes Harry swallow the words one more time. A sense of urgency overtakes his movements as deft fingers work at Harry’s pants, and then his own, until they both stand, naked and vulnerable, under the moonlight.
“When did you grow a beard?”
Very little changes in Harry’s room from day-to-day. Today’s issue of
Harry’s left the cap off the toothpaste again, leaving it to ooze onto the bathroom countertop. I could easily dismiss the caked-on paste from the porcelain. All it would take is a snap of my fingers, a muttered jumble of pseudo-Latin under my breath to make it disappear. However, a crescendo of unfortunate events through the week culminated in a Ministry-issued number that replaced my name, a reminder of the creature that replaces my identity. The thought numbs my limbs, rattles my nerves, and prickles at the remnants of my fleeting patience.
Patches hobbles down the hall with a toy mouse in her mouth, dropping it at Draco’s feet in request for her morning meal. Draco empties a tin into her bowl and watches as she blatantly ignores the offering, choosing to laze on the windowsill instead.
“Isla, stay with me,” Draco cautions, placing steadying hands on her shoulders. Her head ticks upright as she refocuses on the present. “Good girl. As for Healer Clemmons’ cheekbones, I’m afraid I’m not the one to ask. No matter, I’ll find her. Thank you, Isla.”
“Only temporary, love. Don’t worry. We’ve gotten this far; we don’t want anyone following us,” Draco reassures him. “Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are going to pass you around like a baton before you make the final leap to La Trinité-sur-Mer with Pansy.”
Draco traces the tip of his nose along the taut muscle of Harry’s neck, settling just behind Harry’s ear.
“Wait and hope. It’s all we can do, dear heart.”
“Do I know you?”
“They took
“Oh, I love this one,” Draco says, minutes, perhaps hours, later as the sounds of a piano pleasantly fill the kitchen. He starts to tunelessly sing along, “
Harry wakes, shivering, on the floor of the Great Hall. He stares at the starry ceiling above him, where shining orbs of green and blue and orange dangle from invisible strings. The little planets orbit around the room, an entire solar system contained within the halls of Hogwarts. Intrigued, Harry reaches up to touch a small, rosy orb with golden rings as it whizzes by above his head. He pulls his hand away to find a shimmering dust coating his fingertips.
Draco rolls the vial between his fingers again, the warmth of its contents reassuring against his skin. “If I told you, I’d have to kill you.” His poor attempt at a joke falls flat, and Odette’s posture deflates like a crumpled soufflé.
“Shh, Draco. Stop, please. It’s okay. I’m home now,” Harry whispers into Draco’s ear. “I’m home, and you didn’t give up. I’m home
“Don’t give up on me,” Harry says, peeling the Dreamless Sleep from Draco’s fingers.
“I’m ready,” Harry says, arms full of crumpled photos and Weasley sweaters. He’s donned an old pair of pajama bottoms and one of Draco’s jumpers, like he could’ve been plucked from one of Draco’s memories. Like none of this is real, and they’re going to wake up in bed any moment.
Pulse galloping at the base of his neck, Draco clears his throat and removes his wand. “Harry, can you gather your things while I take care of the wards?”
“Yes, Harry. May I?” Draco offers his hand, and Harry, always trusting, accepts it without hesitation. He lines up their palms to show off the matching bands that each of them wears on their ring fingers. Harry’s is looser than usual, but it’s undeniable that the shiny silver rings are a matching set.
When the ink was fresh, Draco complained relentlessly about the near-constant tickling sensation as the restless Antipodean Opaleye came to life across his skin. Now, Harry probably notices the little movements more than Draco does, still enraptured by the dragon’s shimmering scales when the sun hits them just right.
Odette’s eyebrows disappear behind her tightly wound curls, and her stare abandons the potion to alternate between Draco and Harry. Draco simply huffs a laugh, shrugs, and says, “Odette, thank you. For everything. I don’t know how I would’ve gotten through these months without you.”
“Can’t or won’t?” he drawls, still holding your wrist in the air like an unlit torch. Your arm goes limp under his grip.
Before Harry came home, Draco wanted to ensure that Harry woke knowing two things every morning. The first: that he was safe. The second: that he was so irrefutably and catastrophically loved. So, they took a day, he, Hermione, and every Weasley they could find, to plaster the cottage in photographs and newspaper clippings and letters and notes. Encouragement to guide Harry through those first scary moments of waking up somewhere unfamiliar, instructions to help Harry find himself in the unknown.
A sense of emptiness unfolds when Harry releases the last thread of memory and recedes from Draco’s mind. They’re both breathless and sweating when they pull apart, and the smile Harry wears coaxes the last puff of air from Draco’s lungs.
“No shit?” Harry asks, still clinging to Draco’s hand.
“Not at all, Draco. I’ll tell Ron; he’ll understand. Tell Harry we love him,” Hermione says with an encouraging smile.
Unsteady and exhausted, Draco calls on the nauseating pull of apparition. It’s Harry’s grip on his waist that keeps him grounded when Isla and room 332 vanish in a smear of color around them.
Today is one of those days.
Draco lays down his knife and looks at the bowl of berries and batter, though he’s not really looking at the bowl at all. He tugs his lip between his teeth and furrows his brow in that way that means his mind is somewhere else, leaving his body and me behind in the kitchen.
Draco pulls the vial from his pocket, and holds it between them. “I need you to drink this, Harry.”
“Hello, Healer Malfoy.” A petite witch with honey-blond hair and piercing green eyes skips towards Draco. Though she has energy in her steps and a quaint smile on her face, the cheer doesn’t reach her voice. Prior to her downgrade to Janus Thickey, Isla occupied a room on Draco’s unit, oscillating wildly between an agitated delirium and near-comatose unconsciousness.
and Harry will look to Draco with downturned lips for reassurance, for validation. With an encouraging smile, Draco will pat Harry on the shoulder or squeeze his thigh under the table. He lets his hand linger as if to say,
The sun wasn’t even out when Draco woke me up this morning with the heat of his mouth and the weight of a suitcase at the foot of the bed. “I’ve got to get out of here,” he’d said between the kisses he smudged across my belly. “Come with me.”
“It’s cold, Potter. Don’t leave your clothes lying around if you care so much about who wears them,” he’d snarked defensively. Harry could only chuckle, a bit bewildered by the curl of warmth in his stomach.
bony hip knocked against the table’s edge. No. A gasp (smothered). No.
“Hey, Draco?”
A kiss. A grasp. A niffler after a watch. No—me after Harry’s touch (suffocated groan). Harry, tugging my hips. Heated skin. A curved back. Harry, pushing me backwards. A bony hip knocked against the table’s edge. No.
We’ve been in a rental in Joshua Tree for two weeks. It’s the longest Draco’s wanted to stay anywhere since we left all those months ago. I already know he likes it here because I’ve never seen him sit still like I have when he sits on this porch. Though I'm not sure why, the bare and lonesome desert has subdued Draco's restlessness that usually trickles out through fidgeting fingers or tapping feet.
“Can’t you go easy on me if it’s my birthday?”
Draco and Hermione sit on the back porch, watching as Ron and Harry help Rose build a sandcastle later that afternoon. The recognition in Harry’s eyes grows stronger as the sun tracks its path across the sky, but Hermione gazes on with a skeptical twist to her lip. Her long curls dance in the breeze, catching on her lip or her eyelashes. She huffs a breath and casts a charm to secure them in a knot at the top of her head.
Without a word, Malfoy snaps his fingers, extinguishing your
The heat of the shower burns my skin, painting my limbs and the tops of my feet in a pink, watercolor flush. I let the water strip away the remnants of the evening, the cigarette smoke that clings to my hair and the grease and salt lodged beneath my fingernails. It doesn’t wash away the memories of the Weasel’s grimace, or the distasteful curl of Granger’s lip. Instead, they linger, trapped in the clouds of steam like a bird’s wings, wet with oil.
The kitchen flares in a bright green light as the floo roars to life. Past-Harry spills from the hearth in blood-stained Auror robes. He frowns when he lays his eyes on Draco, but his gaze isn’t malicious.
My vision blurs, the yellow bathroom light, shining stellate over the grungy shower tile.
The sleeve of Harry’s gown falls to expose his shoulder as he leans in to look at the younger version of Draco more closely, much like one watches a violent collision of quidditch players. Cringing at the sight, yet unable to look away.
A newfound determination ignites in Draco’s belly when he immediately slips out of Harry’s bed and snicks the door shut to room 332. As he plods down the forty-eight stairs to the first floor with more energy than he’s had in months, a question echoes between the walls, drowning out the sound of his footsteps: What the hell are they doing at St. Mungo’s that he can’t do at home?
Hermione sighs and rests a hand over Draco’s shoulders, patting the sore and tired muscle. After a long stretch of silence, she finally says, “Well, let’s bring him home then.”
Draco casts a
“I’ve brought you more photographs. And your favorite soap; it smells like Christmas biscuits.”
“Hey, now. That’s one of your favorite things about me.”
We’ve learned a lot of things over the last year or so, but the most important is the art of body language. Instead of asking which direction, I direct my gaze between deserted roadways and wait for Harry’s nod. When Harry is tired, he holds a hand over a silent yawn and mocks laying his head on a pillow with his hands clasped in prayer under his ear.
“Why do you keep making me do this?” The words slice through the air like a blade. “Why are you letting them do this to me?”
“Draco, we’re going to get through this,” Harry whispers, although he has no additional information to offer. Just hope and trust. Draco glances down at their hands and catches the shiny glint of Harry’s scar:
Harry nods and squeezes Draco’s hand before plunging his face into the shimmering pool.
“Let’s take that swim, yes?” Draco says, planting a kiss over the birthmark on Harry’s neck and returning to Harry’s lips. He takes careful steps backward, leading Harry into the ocean and not once parting to catch his breath.
“Did we sleep on the floor?” I ask, inducing a series of noisy cracks from my aching spine.
Anxious anger burns a trail starting at the tips of my fingers, drawing claws to break through the skin beneath my nails and a black, tarry flush to creep towards my elbows like my arms have been dipped in soot. I roll my neck at the feeling of hundreds of feathery needles piercing through the skin of my collarbone, my neck, my shoulders. A flash of pain, lightning hot, grips my spine as a set of wings punctures the surface between my shoulder blades, hanging low in the tight space of the shower.
“Then don’t,” Draco says, slouching down on the hard seat to get more comfortable.
The grin that spreads across Harry’s face is wicked and teasing as he stands and offers his hand. “Do we have time for a swim?” he asks as Draco lays his hand in his, accepting the help.
“I know you are. I know,” Harry says, shifting to press a kiss to Draco’s temple, trailing wet lips across his jaw until he covers Draco’s lips with his own. The taste of treacle tart lingers on his tongue.
Draco laughs, not even trying to hide his relief. “No shit, my love.”
Draco spent a few days reading up on furniture restoration spells, and before long, the chair was good as new, no longer splitting at the seams and its deep cerulean velvet, smooth and unstained. A couple of decades later, that chair is still a staple of Draco’s morning routine. Occasionally, when he’s feeling a bit prickly, he likes to remind Harry that he almost threw it away.
Harry feels his eyelids grow heavy as he settles into the plump cushions of the loveseat, intoxicated by the dense smell of pine and citrus suffusing the sitting room. Outside, a gentle snow falls steadily, the large flakes illuminated by the porch light. The evening, in its ease and simplicity, gently lulls Harry into a wistful reverie of snowy mornings at Hogwarts, chunky knit sweaters and endless supplies of treacle tart.
“Trick question, you bastard. You were a right git back then. Much more tolerable these days. Now can I touch you?”
It doesn’t take long for everyone to recognize Harry and Draco’s need for privacy. Eventually, Hermione fakes a yawn, despite the spill of excess energy into the tap of her sandaled foot. With a nudge to Ron’s ribs, they both say their goodbyes and head towards the guest room in the cottage. Soon after, Pansy casts Draco a knowing smirk and drags Ginny by the hand in a dramatic and impossible search for shells in the dark.
“Gentlemen, I don’t want to interrupt, but we are in a bit of a hurry.” Draco strides towards the reunited friends and pats Ron on his shoulder. “Ready for the next jump?”
“Do I know you?”
at the climbing beans, blooming peppers, and towering tomatoes.
Draco stifles a yawn as he proceeds through the familiar routine of checking notes, straightening photos, and scrawling out his morning introduction to his husband. Though some days it’s still disheartening, he’s found a certain charm in getting to meet Harry all over again every day, in curating what photos and what memories Harry gets to witness first. He adjusts the sticking charm on the photo of them visiting Charlie at the dragon reservation and thinks that he could live with this. That if this is the best they get, it’s worth the battles that the last year has brought them.
“Mm, now you are,” Draco hums and dog-ears a page. He crawls to lean over Harry, blocking the sun from his face. When he notices the shade, Harry peels his eyelids open and grins, lazy and crooked, up at Draco.
“So, why you? Why doesn’t Healer Clemmons do this with the rest of my—" he waves his hand in a vague gesture “—whatever the hell it is we do every day?”
“What the fuck am I doing?” he whispers to the empty bed.
“What’s the verdict on your birthday?” he asks, jaw shifting uncomfortably against Harry’s bony shoulder.
“Still started with a blank slate this morning.”
He catches my eye in the mirror, raising a brow in silent question. I nod in answer, preening at the satisfied smirk that overcomes Harry’s face as he slips a spit-slicked finger inside me, a delicious mix of pain and pleasure.
Our dinner plates are just as we left them, except not quite. The pasta is molded and emits a foul stench. My fork is tilted precariously on its edge, as though the ghost of my former self may settle at the table any moment to nibble at a decaying piece of courgette.
Almost, my dear, but not quite.
likes to guess; they all do. But none of them have come anywhere close.”
“Pansy, please help yourself to a piece of my breakfast,” Draco announces, gesturing generously.
He stands uneasily, feeling a bit off balance, and hears a familiar, gruff voice behind him.
“Worth it,” Draco huffs.
In the light of your
Drowsy, Harry shakes his head in slow motion and slides his hand behind Draco’s neck to pull him into a deeper kiss. He threads his fingers through Draco’s hair and melts under his touch.
Before the magic leaps from my fingertips, I catch Harry’s eye, and he shakes his head (just once, but his movement is soft; not the curt dismissal of a child but a tender denial, a loving warning, if such a thing exists. If it doesn’t, leave it to Harry to make it so.).
Though at first, Draco tastes like sweat and tequila, underneath it all, he tastes like home.
“Are you going to kiss me, or are you just going to stare at me like a frightened kneazle?” There’s an arrogant curl to his lip. I want to know what it tastes like.
“I wish you’d gotten to see it with her. She loved it almost as much as you do.”
“I want to go home,” Harry whispers into his ear, and his hot breath tickles Draco’s sensitive skin.
“What are we going to do?” Harry asks, looking up to Draco with misty eyes and downturned lips.
Though his sense of smell is lost, Harry imagines that Malfoy smells of his citrus shampoo, his strange cologne that says it smells like a library. Harry is certain it smells nothing like a library.
Odette snorts and stops her spinning to look at Draco. “Sounds about right. Good luck, Draco; Pensieve’s all yours.”
Harry leans into the pull and captures Draco’s lips in a slow and easy morning kiss, perfect despite their chapped lips and morning breath. Perfect, perhaps, because of them.
Draco is uncertain how long he lays like this. Long enough to count the lines in the floorboards and the wrinkles in the duvet. His back aches, and his hip twinges when he finally peels himself from the floor. Though his hands tremble, he extends his wand, summoning Harry’s pillow and favorite quilt from the shelves. His steps are heavy as he retraces his path: replacing Harry’s toothbrush in the cup at the sink, laying his placemat at the table, and setting his trainers at the back door. Eyes stinging and tender from swelling, Draco grabs Harry’s rain jacket from the closet and slips it over his shoulders.
“What’s it called when little birds shed their feathers?” I ask my reflection, arching forward until my breath fogs the glass. My nose wrinkles at the stench, prompting a swift snatch of my toothbrush from the plastic cup on the sink.
Draco feels his fragile cage of rib bones collapse on his burning lungs. His fingertips turn numb, and his lip quivers as he fights to maintain his composure.
“What do you need, Draco?”
“Harry, I’m so sorry, darling. I was trying to do better, but I was so scared. I didn’t know what else I could do.” Draco begins to quietly sob, painting his face in glistening gold as he smears his hands over his dampened cheeks. “I’m not brave, like you are. It’s going to take a bit of time, yet, but I’ll get there. You’re not quite ready either, but it’s going to be alright. We’ll have a soft place to fall, you and I, love, just wait a bit longer.”
He’s not gentle when he pushes you against the door, meeting your lips in a violent crash. It makes your thoughts blur, not enough blood to spare for your brain as your cock thickens against his palm. He tastes like someone else when he plunges his tongue into your mouth, hot and insistent as he tears at your pants and splays an icy hand over your belly. Your soft belly, your soft arms, and your soft neck, flesh so easily torn by a swift, sharp bite.
“It’s either be surprised by everything or be surprised by nothing. I’ve chosen the latter.” He rests his chin on his knees and finally snaps the stray thread on his pants.
Healer Perkins purses her lips and replaces her glasses on the bridge of her nose.
Draco smiles before capturing Harry’s lips again, allowing his tongue to leisurely explore Harry’s mouth, morning breath and all.
Purposeful swaying soon evolves to a lazy circling of the kitchen, both men unwilling to abandon the moment entirely. Harry nestles his face into the hollow of Draco’s neck, inhaling the smoky-citrus of his cologne.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” He lets the words slip out, just barely a whisper.
Clad only in his hospital gown, Harry meanders across the kitchen, and Draco can’t decide if he looks horribly out of place or strangely suited to the grungy and eclectic feel of Grimmauld. Maybe both.
Malfoy gently lays the back of his hand against Harry’s forehead. Harry is surprised when, instead of flinching away, his body leans in to the soothing coolness against his skin. His eyelids drift closed as he relishes the feeling of the icy hand against his face.
Not mulching.”
You nod, mind too fuzzy to do much else as you watch the restless flames singe the forest floor. A possum skirts across the road, baring its razored teeth before skittering into the trees. As the warm prickle of Malfoy’s magic skims over your sticky neck, you hum, delighting in the feeling of his fingers over your skin.
