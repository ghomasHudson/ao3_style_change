He held onto the wall as he slowly somehow made his way into the sitting room, where he knew Malfoy was waiting for him.
“I’m gay,” he whispered into the stillness of the night. He held his breath for a second or two as if expecting a blow of some sort to happen. As if confessing he was gay, the world would blow up or something. However, Harry did no damage. The world remained the same.
It had just begun to snow as Harry left his house for the first time in a week. He groaned as he stood on the stoop of Grimmauld Place, holding his keys tightly in his hand, the cold metal pressing painfully into the skin of his palm. He looked around the snow-covered streets. He stood there for a second or two contemplating about going back inside or not. The simple trip to the grocery store didn’t seem all that simple any longer. But he’d promised Hermione and himself that he would attempt to get out of the house today.
There was a brief pause as both men continued to stare at one another before Draco was reaching out for Harry’s hand and pulling him close. “Dance with me.”
Draco drew the curtains with a flick of his wand before removing Harry’s glasses from where they still rested on top of his head. He carefully folded them and placed them on the bedside table. He pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple, wishing him sweet, happy dreams before leaving the bedroom.
He rubbed at his eyes as he came down the stairs, the old worn wood groaning with each step he took. As he came into the sitting room, he stopped short at what he saw. Draco had Sirius’s old recorded player out on the coffee table. Scattered all around it was piles of recorders. Usually, it was all kept tucked away in a chest in Sirius’s old bedroom. Draco, who Harry was learning had a thing for music, must have brought it down sometime since Harry had fallen asleep.
“You’re acting very strange, Potter,” remarked Draco. He didn’t know if he should be amused or weirded out by Harry’s overall perkiness. He couldn’t recall ever seeing Potter so upbeat and just plain happy before.
There was no reply. An uneasiness then fell over Draco as he took a step further into the living room. He didn’t like how quiet it was in the house. It was too quiet, he thought.
The Headmistress had assigned the returning 8th-year class to their own dormitory on the Northside of the castle. It was to promote inter-house relations and such. They had their own school colours too of orange and teal. Some people were upset about this and didn’t understand why they couldn’t just return to their old house dormitories. Harry hadn’t cared, though, which had not only surprised himself but for others too. Harry had always been a proud Gryffindor. And he still was to a certain point. But Harry was no longer that skinny kid anymore. He was changed, no longer caring about stupid house points and rivalries. He didn’t care about school either. But he had nothing else to do. He no longer cared about becoming an Auror as he initially planned to do back in his fifth and sixth years. So when the owl had first arrived during the summer with the school letter attached and Hermione’s constant pushing, he’d agreed to come. He couldn’t figure out a good enough excuse to give.
It wasn’t until Solomon Burke’s Don’t Give Up On Me began to play that Draco pulled Harry’s body closer to his. Harry brought his head down and nuzzled at Draco’s neck, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne on his skin.
Harry hated these questions. He hated when Hermione went into her healer mood like this. She already knew he didn’t like talking about his feelings or being treated like one of her patients at Mungos. He’d rather she just treated him like her friend, just Harry.
Harry hissed slightly as the bright sunlight burned his eyes. It had been days since he’d seen actual sunlight. He closed his eyes and buried himself deeper into the bed. He felt like a vampire suddenly who was being exposed to daylight. The light made everything clearer. He didn’t want to see anything clearly at the moment.
Hermione just rolled her eyes and shook her head at Draco’s eagerness to hear the story. She took a sip of her tea before beginning to explain.
The blond glanced up from his phone and met Pansy’s eye in the mirror. Draco had confided in the woman earlier about how Harry was going to be late. At first, it had just been a work thing, which hadn’t bothered the blond. He knew how much of an ass Harry’s boss could be at times. But now, there seemed to be a delay on the Tube. “Unfortunately, yes,” sighed Draco as he hit send before placing the phone back into the little bag at his waist.
“DRACO!” Harry screamed out in frustration as he attempted to get to his feet, but it was too late. Draco was already out of the room and heading towards the Floo.
“No. No, no worries,” spoke Malfoy with an understanding smile. There is a slight note of disappointment in his voice though. He’d been looking forward tonight just as much as Harry had. “The flu is a nasty bugger. Especially during the summer.”
From afar, it might not look like much, but anyone close to them and paying any attention would know it wasn’t all that innocent.
Harry, for a moment, thought that Neville was calling him out on his hard-on. However, he quickly realized that Neville was asking if he wanted another butterbeer.
Soon the darkness was back, sitting on his shoulders like a familiar weight.  It happened a few days before Christmas. Harry didn’t know where it had come from all of a sudden. He’d heard of seasonal depression and the holidays being particularly hard for others. But that had never been an issue for him before. Maybe growing up Christmas had never been his favorite time of year, but all those miserable Christmases with the Dursleys had been made up for with years worth of celebrations at Hogwarts and The Burrow. He always looked forward nowadays to the cheerful, rowdy, mulled wine-infused, stuffed with mince pies Weasley’s Christmas’s.
Harry’s eyebrows fused in confusion, his phone once again drawing his attention. He swiped at the screen again and immediately sent Draco a text, telling him that he was finally here. He hoped that by seeing the text, Draco would come and meet him outside.
With this thought, Harry, in one fluid motion, pushed the small thin piece of clothing that still remained down the other man’s thighs. The blond let out a hiss of a moan as his erection was released from its confinements and bobbed, brushing against Harry’s.
When the Muggle doctor he’d gone to see, referred to him by his Healer, diagnosed him with being Bipolar, Harry couldn’t help but feel like a weight had been lifted off of his shoulders. He finally had a name for it, a reason for why he acted and felt the way he did at times. It was all due to some chemical imbalance in his brain.
“Welcome to The Funk Room!” the hostess announced as she pointed up to a pink neon sign above the archway. Harry’s eyebrows rose high up on his forehead in surprise as he glanced up at the sign. It flashed ‘THE FUNK ROOM’ at him.
To Harry, it felt like ages before Draco was finally kneeling between Harry’s legs. The blond began to rub his cock around Harry’s ass, spreading his precum everywhere. Harry responded by pressing the heels of his feet firmly into the mattress and thrusting his hips upwards. He wanted to feel Draco’s cock stretching his ass.
“I can do this anymore. I thought you felt the same way about me. But I was wrong. You hurt me tonight.”
“Of course, I don’t know what you’re feeling,” replied Draco softly. “And the last thing I want to do is project myself on you. I just think you’re being a little rash with all this. “
He frowned as he studied the red brick exterior of the building. He wasn’t sure if this was the right place or not. It didn’t look like any of the clubs he’d frequent in the past. Instead of just being a large iron door, a flashing neon sign, and a giant bouncer standing guard, two large potted plants were on either side of a modern glass door. There was no music pouring from inside out onto the streets as most clubs had. There wasn’t even a lineup of people sectioned off by a red velvet rope.
His boyfriend wasn’t controlling or anything like that. Harry knew that Draco liked him no matter what he wore at the end of the day, no matter how much the blond made a bit of a fuss sometimes about what Harry chose to wear. But tonight was about Draco. It was his birthday, and Harry wanted to make Draco proud.
It was a few hours later, and Harry was adequately drunk. Along with most of everyone else at the party.  The common room was pulsing with the beat of the music. Someone had dimmed the candles on the walls, giving the entire room a moody feel to it. Everyone seemed to be up and dancing at this point in the party. All the heavy furniture had been moved to the sides of the room, making room for a makeshift dance floor.
Draco immediately leaned back into Harry for support as he sank into the waves of pleasure beginning to build within him. He was glad that Harry had enjoyed his present so much as he’d enjoyed wearing it. He’d never been one to wear something so private as a butt plug out in public like that for as long as he had. He’d been playing with it earlier in the day while getting ready for the evening and had just decided to leave it in. It had taken some adjustment. He wasn’t used to walking around and moving normally with an object inside him. However, the foreign feeling soon wore off and was replaced with arousal and excitement. Draco grew accustomed to the small thrill that shot through his body with any sudden movement he made. Wearing the butt plug had made dancing a whole new exciting challenge for him.
He didn’t bother to wipe the cold water off as he lifted his head and once again appeared at himself in the mirror. He tried to smile, to mask what he is truly feeling inside. And for a second it worked. He looked happy and content. But then there was a peal of high pitch laughter at the back of his head. Laughing at his idiocy and thoughts of wanting to be happy for once.
“Hey,” whispered Draco. He removed his hand from Harry’s knee and brought it up to the side of his husband’s face. He cupped Harry’s chin, brushing away the tears with his thumb as they fell.
“Owl me?” asked Harry, looking up hopefully at Draco. He hoped that his foul mood hadn’t royally fucked up his chances for another date with the blond. He did want to make it work out for once. He was so fucking tired of feeling lonely. He wanted a love like everyone else seemed to have. He wanted a partner to weather the storm he was constantly battling with.
Draco turned his head slightly to the side and pursed his lips. He was still pretending to be mad at his boyfriend but knew he wouldn’t be able to last much longer. Harry’s words and apologetic face were making him melt. “Well, you can start making it up to me by dancing to the rest of this song.”
He didn’t waste another moment as he kicked off the covers and got out of bed. He was bursting with energy, his whole body practically vibrating as though someone had flicked on a switch in him, making his magic hum through his veins. He dressed quickly, not paying attention to what he was grabbing as he pulled it from the wardrobe. Harry had never been good at “fashion.” And on any other day, he didn’t pay attention to what was on his body. The only thing he asked of his clothes was for them to be comfortable.
He placed the bag onto the footstool, in the stall corner, before turning on the shower. A small moan of pleasure escaped from his lips as the hot spray of water hit his back, and his hand immediately went to his cock. He didn’t waste any time as he gripped his shaft and twisted his hand upwards. He squeezed his eyes shut and allowed for the image of the Indian prince to return.
“Do you want tea?” asked Hermione as she kneeled down in front of Harry. She made a small movement with her hand, like she was going to reach out and touch him, but decided against it. She knew Harry didn’t like to be touched when he was like this.
He hadn’t gone on another date with Malfoy. But the blond had owled Harry as promised. They had written a few times over the last couple of weeks. But they were just friendly letters. They’d yet to make plans to meet up again. Harry was fine with that. He was feeling better, but he was scared that something would happen that’d force him to push Malfoy away again. No, it was for the best, he thought. It was for the best if they just remained friendly with each other.
Their eyes bore into each other as their bodies slowly began to move as one on the dance floor. Their hips are gently bumping into one another every so often as they moved to the beat of the music.
“I’ll give you five minutes, Potter. I’m not waiting here all night for you,” instructed Draco as he pushed his way past Harry.
The blond wore a fitted navy blue muggle suit, blazer, and all. He wore a white button-up shirt underneath. It was barely done up, though, showing off a pale strip of the chest. Draco looked like he’d just walked off the photoshoot or something. He looked sexy as hell, and it was making Harry’s mouth water. Harry shifted a little in his seat as he felt himself get a semi-hard on. He immediately placed his now empty butterbeer bottle onto his lap, covering himself. He knew that no one could probably notice, but it still sent a wave of embarrassment and shame through him. He shouldn’t be getting hard over any man, let alone Draco. He felt his cheeks flush, but he hoped that Neville didn’t notice as he tore his eyes away from the blond and over at him, instead.
Harry at first had just said he was cutting back on drinking because of new year, new me, and whatnot. And then started saying he'd had too much the night before. But he soon grew tired of constantly lying. He was already pretty much doing that on a daily basis with his old school friends who still didn’t know about his illness. And then, eventually, he just stopped going out altogether when the idea of just sitting there surrounded by happy drunks made him loathe himself.
Harry awoke abruptly the next morning to the sound of an owl tapping at his bedroom window. A slow smile crept across his face as he immediately recognized the magnificent grey eagle owl. Only Draco Malfoy would have such a beautiful bird as a pet. Kicking off the covers, Harry went to the window and allowed the bird inside. The owl hooted loudly in greeting as it flew onto Harry's outstretched arm and offered him his leg.
He pulled at the collar of his sweater, where it had begun rubbing uncomfortably against his neck. It was a dark navy blue wool sweater with specks of grey and white in it. It was one of his favourite sweaters. He’d gotten it at a charity shop a few years ago. Maybe it was because he’d grown up wearing Dudley’s hand-me-downs that he found some sort of comfort in wearing pre-loved clothes over brand new ones.
!” drawled Pansy as she came to stand beside Draco in the mirror. The petite brunette tucked her perfectly bobbed hair behind her ears and, like Draco, admired her reflection. “What are you doing hiding out in here? You’re missing your party.”
And like on most Friday night’s there was a party going on in the 8th Year common room. Since most of them were over eighteen, the Headmistress let some things slide for the older students and turn the other way, pretending not to notice what was going on behind the closed doors of the 8th year dormitory, e.g. parties and drinking.  The 8th year already had 24 hour access to the castle and Hogsmeade. No curfew was set in place for the older students. The Headmistress thought they’d already been through enough in the last few years of their young lives and had earned the right to be treated like adults. And with being an adult came with the benefit of freedom and certain liberties.
A smile slowly crept across Harry’s face as he continued to lay there for a second, staring up at the ceiling, listening to the birds singing in the bright summer morning light. Today was going to be a good day, he thought. He could feel it in his bones. He hadn’t wakened with the sense of dread looming over him, pressing the whole weight of the world down onto his fucking shoulders. No, today Harry Potter felt as light as a feather and it was bloody brilliant!
“Malfoy! WAIT!” Harry called out. “I didn’t forget. It’s just been a long...day. Give me a couple of minutes. Come in. Come in.” He pulled open the heavy black door even further, allowing Malfoy room to come in.
“Darling,” spoke Pansy softly as she turned to face Draco. She took a step towards him, the heels of her stilettos making a clicking sound against the marble flooring as she did so. She held out the lipgloss to him before reaching up with her free hand and cradling the side of his smooth-shaven face.  Draco’s eyes locked with Pansy’s for a second. The corners of her lips turned up into a tender smile. “Don’t frown. It’ll give you wrinkles.”
Harry didn’t necessarily want to die. But living was becoming harder to do. He just figured it would be easier on everyone if he just died.  He would no longer be a burden to Hermione and Ron, who had their own lives to live. He wouldn’t have to keep on lying to everyone about why he wasn’t working or seeing anyone. He wouldn’t have to keep worrying the Weasleys when he didn’t show up to Sunday brunch without an excuse.
“You’re a fucking idiot, Harry. That’s why,” he thought bitterly to himself. “ARGH!” He cried out in frustration as a new set of tears stung his eyes. He pushed his glasses off of his face and into his hair before pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. He began to sob uncontrollably as he relieved one of the worst moments of his life, over and over again.
He hated that his body and mind were betraying him at this exact moment when something good was about to happen for once to him. He fucking hated how the universe was once again spitting in his face.
Harry, himself had his arms out to the sides, but now and then, he would bring them in and innocently touch Draco ever so briefly on his hips. His fingers softly brushing up against his sides before pulling shyly away.
“He does,” agreed the blond with a smile. He didn’t bother to mention that he’d sent Harry a very detailed birthday list a few weeks prior, with this shirt being at the top of said list.
It wasn’t until Draco reached out and touched Harry on the knee that the brunet finally looked in his direction. A fresh set of tears filled Harry’s eyes as he looked at Draco’s worried face.
As he eventually made his way to the produce section of the grocery store, the contents of his basket contained: a jumbo bag of salt and vinegar crisps, a bright pink jug of laundry detergent, birthday candles, and a six-pack of bottled Pepsi.
As much as he tried to fight it, the sadness came. Like it always did despite him taking his medication and everything else.
“Malfoy, fancy seeing you here!” spoke Harry warmly as he came up to stand beside Draco in front of the peaches. He grinned sheepishly at the blond, wagging his eyebrows playfully.
Harry tried to show Draco that he couldn't get out of bed. That the reason for not getting out wasn't because he didn’t care. Because he fucking did. Deeply. It just felt like he was moving the entire sun to simply climb out of bed and walk.
“Yes, frankly I am,” spoke Hermione honestly. She’d thought for sure that Draco would go running off and telling his friends about Harry’s mental state. The Malfoy she knew from school would’ve been running to the Prophet with the news on how The Chosen One was a mental case.
“Please, don’t give up on me,” whispered Harry into Draco’s neck. There was a brief moment of silence and for a second the brunet thought that his boyfriend hadn’t heard him or thought maybe he was singing along to the song.
Harry slumped his head against the pillow, squeezing his eyes shut firmly and allowing for the sensation of Draco’s tongue on his body to take over. Draco licked at him leisurely. He explored his ass slowly, taking his sweet time opening up Harry and penetrating him lightly. A finger soon slipped in as Draco’s sucked on Harry’s balls, but it wasn’t nearly enough. Harry needed more.
Harry’s eyes flashed towards Draco as he turned on the light. The other man's gaze was hard. His blond hair was effortlessly tousled. His bowtie was undone and hanging loosely from his neck. The first few buttons of his shirt were also undone, exposing Draco’s pale skin.
Harry shifted in his seat. He turned his gaze once again back towards Draco. The blond was looking at Harry with genuine interest and concern in his eyes. Draco gave Harry a small smile as they continued to look at each other before Harry replied. “I’m coming off of a low,” replied Harry honestly. “Tonight I’ll be pretty manic.” He scratched at the back of his neck nervously. This was the most he’d ever talked about his moods and conditions with someone who wasn’t his therapist or Hermione.
“Yes. So good,” Harry murmured back. He ran his hands along Draco’s back, feeling the lean muscles underneath before coming to rest on his ass. He dug his fingers into the fleshy cheeks, pulling them apart slightly.
The sound of Draco clearing his throat brought Harry’s attention away from the group of students and back onto the blond.
As he smelled the earthy scent of the wine, Harry couldn’t help but ponder what Hermione and Ron would make of his date with Malfoy. They’d been shocked at first to hear that the former Slytherin was only living a few blocks away from Harry and that they’d become some sort of friends. He didn’t think they would be outraged when they found out that their relationship had taken on a more romantic note. Of course, Hermione and Ron didn’t know Malfoy quite like Harry did. And yes, the blond had apologized to both of them, along with several other people at Hogwarts after the war. They’d all come to some sort of truce and mutual understanding to put the past behind them.
Anyone with eyes couldn’t possibly look away from Draco as he continued to show off his disco moves.  The blond didn’t care if he drew attention to himself as he sang at the top of his lungs to his friends. He was drunk, it was his birthday, and he was having a good time. Plus, he really liked this song.
He was coming out of a low period. And today he’d woken up feeling like he could get out of bed.  If he’d been in a manic state, he would’ve loved to see the snow-covered streets of London. But not today.
“Thank you for being honest with me, Harry. About everything,” spoke Draco softly as he pulled away and locked eyes with the brunet. “Can I owl you?”
His stomach growled loudly at just the mere thought of them. Harry closed his eyes and let out a groan as he began to salivate on how good that would be at the moment. Slamming his hands down onto the counter, he opened his eyes and decided that was what he wanted.
Draco just stared at Harry blankly for a second before letting out a dry laugh. “That’s all you got to say. I know you are a man of very few words, Harry, but come on! You’ll have to fucking do better than that. You humiliated me tonight in front of all my friends. No, you hurt me. I’ve been looking forward to tonight for weeks. Tonight meant the world to me, Harry. I was finally getting to be with all the people that I care for the most in the world under one roof. But you betrayed me. At first, I thought something had happened when you didn’t show up like we agreed to. I even owled you, but you didn’t respond. I was worried, then pissed off.”
Draco smacked his lips loudly together before a devilish smirk spread across his features. “What’s mine is yours.”
“You haven’t told anyone? Not even your close friends?” asked Hermione, generally surprised by this.
Draco pushed Harry down onto his back before straddling his hips. He smiled wickedly at him before going down between his open legs and returning the favour. Harry couldn’t help but moan with pleasure as the sweet hotness of Draco’s breath against the cool air was exhilarating.
However, his conscience continued to urge him to go forward with the date and to see it through. It had been a while since his last one. His up and down moods made it hard to date, let alone having any sort of relationship. He barely managed with his friendships, let alone romantic ones.
“Oh, nothing. It’s just a wonderful day. Don’t you think? A wonderful day for peaches!” beamed Harry with a bright smile.
“Do you want me to stay? Can I get you anything? Soup? Tea? Medicine?” Malfoy was nervous and rambling a little now. He was torn between staying and nursing Potter back to health, but another part of him was screaming at him to get the hell away.
Harry looked out the window for a second as he nervously pumped his leg up and down underneath the table. Harry could feel himself sweating even though it was quite cold in the coffee shop. The front door had been left open for a delivery, allowing a cold breeze to filter in through the room.
“I don’t remember,” mumbled Harry as he removed his arm and sat up a little. He didn’t remember the last time he ate. A while ago, he thought. It wasn’t probably normal for him to be able to go days without eating. But years of living with the Dursleys had gotten his body used to not eating for long periods.
Harry didn’t allow any time to pass after Draco had closed the flat door before he was pushing him up against the wall and kissing him. His gym bag dropped with a thud to the floor as he did so. He couldn’t take the wait any longer. He’d been hard since first seeing Draco dancing away on the dance floor.
Being with Harry was like eating peaches and cream and a little bit of acid all at once. You never knew what you would get from one mouthful to the other. One moment it was sweet creaminess and the next bitterness.
Harry found himself getting lost in the kiss. He loved feeling the rough brush of stubble rubbing against his own. The urgent wetness of Draco’s pointed tongue dancing around his. It had been so long since he’d kissed someone like this before. He couldn’t help but marvel at how wonderful it all felt.
They continued to dance. Their hot and slightly sweaty bodies continued to press against each other to the beat of the music. Harry’s heart was racing with excitement and arousal as he continued to get lost in Draco’s eyes. He wondered if Draco was feeling the same. Or was it just him who was hyperventilating slightly?
Harry didn’t say anything as he fidgeted with his glasses. A million thoughts were racing through his head as he continued to look at his boyfriend. He wanted to apologize to Draco. Tell him that he was an idiot and had meant to come. However, no words came out of his mouth. Even though his brain was screaming at him to talk, to say anything. Just like his ability to move, he’d lost his ability to talk too it seemed.
Harry smirked at this; he didn’t need to be told twice. He pressed his mouth to Draco’s shoulder at the same time as he sank his aching cock deep within him.
After finishing their second cups of coffee and sharing a piece of chocolate cake, they exited the coffee shop and stepped into the early evening light.
Harry rubbed his eyes and tried to stop the tremble in his hands as he brought the glass to his lips. He let out a shuddered breath, trying to make sense of everything. He didn’t remember what had triggered the episode. But it didn’t take much to set his mood spiraling down low. His moods were always up and down, up and down like a rollercoaster that Harry very much wanted to get off of, but couldn’t.
And that’s where Harry headed. He didn’t bother to put away the milk or eggs he’d just pulled out. The fluffy french toast with juicy perfect peaches on top was long forgotten as Harry sought shelter in his bed.
“This has been nice Potter,” spoke Malfoy as he ran a hand over the strap of the brown leather messenger bag and adjusted it on his shoulder.
Harry continued to watch Draco as he twirled and threw his hands up in the air. He sang out loud to each one of his friends, pretending to be the lead singer. Harry was torn between going over there and joining in on the fun and holding back and continuing to watch this carefree side of Draco from the sidelines.
Harry’s eyes narrowed at Hermione before abruptly looking away altogether. It physically hurt to hear Draco’s name come out of Hermione’s mouth. It wasn’t like he’d forgotten what had happened. But hearing his boyfriend’s name made it feel fresh again. Tears filled his eyes as the void in his heart began to throb once again.
“You sound like Hermione and one of her mental health books. You both don't know what you're talking about. I know what I feel like. Not you. Or my doctor. I feel good. I feel really good. Like myself!” stated Harry. His green eyes bored into Draco’s. He was so fucking tired of everyone telling him what he should and shouldn’t be doing with his body. He knew he might seem manic at the moment. But he really wasn’t. He just felt better. He didn’t understand why Draco couldn’t see that.
After leaving Grimmauld Place he had headed to the first place that had come to mind: Hermione’s and Ron’s quaint little cottage. He had grown close to the couple, especially Hermione, since getting back together with Harry. Hermione was the person that Draco went to first with any questions he had about Harry and his bipolar disorder.
He’d heard of it happening enough times in his bipolar support group to put him off of telling anyone else about his disorder. Plus he was stable now. Him having an episode since getting together with Draco hadn’t been an issue. He felt like he was on the other side now.
Harry once again met Draco’s eye. They exchanged a heated look before Harry’s hands were on the blond’s body again. His mouth attacked the side of Draco’s neck as his arms wrapped around his waist. His cock slid in between Draco’s cheeks as Harry held onto the curve of his hip firmly as his other hand began to play with a peaked nipple, rolling it between thumb and forefinger until it marbled.
Draco grunted and groaned loudly, not caring if he woke up his neighbours as Harry continued to pound into him. He reared his back and matched Harry’s savage thrusts stroke for stroke. He could feel his orgasm building, but he didn’t want to cum like this. He was suddenly overwhelmed with the need to see Harry. As much as he liked taking it from behind, he took great pleasure in seeing his boyfriend cum.
Draco sighed as he stretched out his back. He figured he wouldn’t be getting any more sleep that morning. He glanced over at Harry, who was propped up on his elbows, watching him with a smirk.
“You are beautiful, Harry. Any boy would be lucky to have you.” Luna then leaned forward and touched the side of Harry’s face, cradling it gently.
He looked gorgeous, he thought. He knew it was a little big-headed and narcissistic to think of himself as attractive, but he didn’t give two hoots at the moment. Draco Malfoy was young and beautiful, and he knew it. And damn, it was his fucking birthday! He was utterly entitled to feel good about himself.
The blond winked in response to this, continuing to move his body to the music. He couldn’t believe how good he felt at this very moment. Tonight was turning out to be exactly what he had hoped it would be. When Harry had first texted Draco telling him he was going to be late, he’d been upset and thought for sure that that was a sign that nothing would go his way tonight. Draco had had disappointing birthdays in the past. He always had these high hopes and expectations on what he wanted them to be, but in reality, nothing ever quite measured up. But tonight, for once, fate was turning out to work in his favour. Sure Harry was late, but he was here now, dancing with Draco. Secretly that’s all he had wanted for his birthday.
“It’s okay, Harry,” Luna whispered again after a second. She scooted herself closer to Harry so that they were now pressed side to side, shoulder to hip. She only let go of his hand for a brief second before taking it once again into her own. She rested their intertwined hands on her knee while the fingers of her other hand traced circles along Harry’s knuckles and wrist. “I know it’s hard. But people will come around. There were tons of gay people in the world. It’s not a big deal.”
Harry’s shirt clung to his back and chest with sweat as he exited the Uber and stepped up to the club entrance. As soon as he could, he’d gotten off of the Tube and took an Uber, not wanting to be late any further.
The conversation continued to flow between the two men after this. The anxiety in Harry’s stomach soon faded away to a dull thump as he found himself once again. It felt good to be not only outside of the house but to be having a conversation with someone who wasn’t Hermione and Ron or his therapist or doctor. It was a relief, talking to Malfoy about everything and nothing at all. He liked how Malfoy talked so he didn’t have to. He liked how Malfoy didn’t push him to talk about himself or his feelings or what his mood was at that moment. With Malfoy, it was like talking to a friend.
No instead of telling Draco what was really bothering him and how he’d really been. Harry went with his default answer. It was too soon to tell Malfoy anything about the mess that was his brain.
His hands moved up Harry’s sides, sliding along his chest as he thrust his hips, making a flawed interpretation of Elvis. Harry couldn’t help but let out a bark of a laugh as Draco continued to dance up against him. The mood had shifted now between them. The intense desire which had been there between them only moments ago had simmered down to a carefree playfulness. If given a chance, Harry would still drag Draco off this dance floor and somewhere more private. But they both knew this wasn’t the time for easy hookups.  It wouldn’t look right if the birthday boy ditched his own party.
“If that’s too soon, I understand. I just mean to say that I quite like you Potter and don’t want to wait around any longer.”
They stayed like this for a while, kissing and simply exploring each other’s bodies over their clothes before it all became too much. Neither wanted it to end, but they didn’t want to rush it either.
He quickly went into the bathroom and brushed his teeth poorly. He reached for his wand and debated about doing a shaving spell, but he had never quite mastered grooming charms well and didn’t want to make a bodged attempt now. It would have to do, he thought.
Her heart pounded against her chest as a feeling of nervousness washed over her. She didn’t know what she was walking into. She could feel Ron’s hand on the small of her back, but she took no notice as her eyes fell onto the form on the bed.
However, Draco was a different story. Draco liking him was still all new and fresh. They didn’t have years of friendship behind them. They had more years of hating and loathing each other’s guts than actual true friendship. Harry didn’t think Draco would judge him or anything, but you could never be quite sure how some would react until the moment came.
The room was dark as they stepped inside. No one bothered to turn on a light as they once again faced one another. Draco brought Harry’s hand up to his lips and kissed it softly in a moment of tenderness before dropping it. The blond then once again pulled Harry’s face close to his and kissed him. The kiss was softer and slower than the one shared previously.
They’d decided on adoption quite quickly. They both didn’t care if the child was biologically theirs or not. That wasn’t important to them. Neither if the child was of magical descent nor not. They just wanted a healthy baby to call their own. As a whole, they were both open-minded.
The other boys in the room with Harry were a Ravenclaw that Harry had never remembered seeing before until he first stepped into the dorm room. When he’d complained about this later to Hermione and Ron at the feast, it had been pointed out to him that he'd had a lot going on in the years previous, so it made sense that he would remember everybody from their school year. The other boy was a Hufflepuff that he did remember, Justin Finch-Fletchley.
He knew this was going to be his only chance of telling Draco the truth about himself and he was as nervous as hell. When he’d told the others about his disorder, a part of him had been nervous to do so, even though he’d always known the outcome in a way. He knew the Weasleys would continue to love him no matter what his mental state was. The same went for Luna and Neville. They were his friends and loved him for who he was. Being bipolar didn’t change that in the slightest.
He must’ve dozed off for a second because the next thing he recalled was the dip of the mattress on the other end of the bed. He lifted his head to meet Draco’s eye. “What are you doing?” whispered Harry. Draco was supposed to be going out that night. It was Pansy’s birthday party.
“Harry!” she cried out as she sank to her knees beside the bed and placed a hand on the side of Harry’s neck, seeking out his pulse.
The whole idea of the thing made him anxious. He wasn’t afraid to be in a room full of Slytherins. He was past all those old house rivalries. He was more anxious about being at a party and being the only sober guest. He still avoided parties when he could with his own mates. Harry quite liked the taste of alcohol. At one point, it had helped calm his nerves. But he knew drinking with the amount of medication he was on wouldn’t be a good combination. Draco had reassured him after he’d brought this concern up, that no one would care if he drank or not. But the thought still made him anxious.
After an awkward stumbling conversation over the peaches, twenty minutes later Harry found himself seated across from Draco at the coffee shop where it had all begun. He couldn’t quite believe that he was here again with Draco after months of not seeing him. However, when the blond had asked if he wanted to get a coffee, Harry hadn’t hesitated.
He’d never been good at getting dressed up and looking presentable. But now, his nerves were making it almost impossible to get ready. He was already running late due to stupid Andrews and his last-minute meeting.
Draco didn’t like to play games. He didn’t see the point in waiting to owl someone you liked just so it might not appear too eager or whatnot. Maybe it was the pureblood manner coming through, he wasn’t sure. He liked Harry and wanted to go on a second date with him.
“Thank you,” he stuttered as the hostess bowed before leaving him alone. Where the fuck was he, he thought as he glanced over his shoulder at the door that the hostess had just left through.
It wasn’t until a year later that they got a phone call that changed their lives forever. A baby, a little girl, had been abandoned at St. Mungos over an hour ago and the hospital had immediately contacted the agency who had Fire Called them right away, saying the baby was theirs if they wanted it.
“To whatever it is that is going on in your head this evening that’s more interesting than this.” Draco waved his hand vaguely in front of him. “You shouldn’t feel obligated, Potter. The date was a dud.” He sighed as he ran his hands through his hair, tucking it behind his ears before dropping his arms dramatically to his sides.
Right after the trials and funerals had come to an abrupt end a month or so after The Battle of Hogwarts.
Pansy had wanted to come back with them, something about an afterparty, but Harry had quickly shut that idea down. He knew he should allow his boyfriend to do what he wanted, and it was his birthday, after all. But Harry was acting selfishly, and he didn’t care. He wanted to have Draco all to himself. Luckily, Luna had stepped in and offered Pansy to stay over at hers for the night.
“Do you want to maybe grab breakfast? I was going to make french toast and grilled peaches for myself. Did you want to come over?” requested Harry. He knew it was a long shot in asking Draco to come over to his house, his home, let alone for breakfast. But he didn’t want to spend the day alone and thought it might be fun to get to know the blond better.
“Aw, look. There goes Cinderella off to the ball!” said Seamus with a smirk. “Don’t forget to be home by midnight, or you’ll turn into a pumpkin!”
“Comin’ up!” The queen turned her back, causing the sequins of her dress to reflect off of the disco ball, launching every shade of the rainbow against the surface of the bar and Harry.
The room soon filled with the filthy sounds of their sweat-coated bodies moving rapidly against one another in a slapping rhythm.
“Coffee then? There is a coffee shop just around the corner from here that does the best dark chocolate mocha!”
“Thanks,” whispered Harry, not quite being able to meet Luna’s eye as he took the glasses from her outstretched hand and shoved them back onto his face.
A tense beat of silence passed before Harry decided he had enough. He took a step closer to Draco, invading his personal space. He gave the blonde a heated kiss on the mouth before beginning to kiss the side of his neck. Harry’s mouth left a trail of hot, wet kisses down the blond’s neck to his chest. His fingers quickly worked at the buttons of his shirt as he did so.
Harry’s eyes were wet, but he tried to blink back the tears. He didn’t want to break down in front of Draco like this. They were in a very public place. But it felt so good to be telling Draco all this. Finally saying it out loud felt like the elephant which had been sitting upon his chest for all these years had finally taken one of its feet off of him, allowing him to breathe.
“Some fool decided to jump in front of a train. There’s a delay on one of the lines,” muttered Draco as he crossed his arms over his chest. “I knew he should’ve taken a fucking Uber as I suggested.”
“That’s not important.” The blond looked at Harry for a long second before reaching out and caressing the side of his face. “You’re the most important thing at the moment. I’m here for you, always.”
Harry had been in the process of making tea when the depression crept up on him, unnoticed. It was like some had snuck into the house and thrown a pillowcase over his head, blinding him into darkness. He’d been reaching up to get his favourite type of tea from the top cupboard when he realized it was out. An overwhelming sadness had overcome him. He knew it was stupid to feel sad and depressed over something as small as being out of his favourite tea. But sometimes that was all it took to submerge him in a deep low depression. If this had happened to anybody else, they would’ve just simply either had another tea, making a mental note to pick up more on the next grocery run or pick up the phone and call their partner who was already out at the store and ask them to pick up more. Draco had a mobile phone for this very reason. So that Harry could get in touch with Draco at a moment’s notice.
The couple continued to kiss heavily for a few moments longer before breaking apart. Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s, looking deeply into his eyes as he tried to catch his breath. Draco licked his lips, a small smile appearing there. Harry found himself returning the smile.
Pansy snorted but didn’t say anything as she took the tube of lipgloss from Draco and applied it over her already red-stained lips.
“Like this,” said Draco into Harry’s ear as he spun him around so that they were now front to back. Harry swallowed over the sudden lump in his throat as he felt Draco’s hands on his hips as he pressed his pelvis into his backside. His heart was beating rapidly as a flutter of emotions came over him. He didn’t know how he had gotten so lucky to call Draco his own. It took all of Harry’s willpower not to melt into a puddle of mush underneath Draco’s touch.
Draco was in no immediate rush. Despite being exhausted and drunk, the blond wanted to savour this moment as long as possible with his boyfriend. Something in their relationship had shifted tonight. Neither knew what it was nor could put their finger on it. There was just an overall feeling.
Their lips met again in a heated passionate kiss as the rest of their clothes were quickly discarded and they climbed onto the bed.
Harry was always the first one out of bed and cooing over Nova when she woke up in the middle of the night. He hated to hear her cry.
The blond stood at the bottom of the stoop, looking up at Harry with a sneer on his face. He looked like he was about to tell Harry to fuck off. However, something changed in his face as he continued to peer up at the house. His face softened and before Harry knew it, Draco was making his way back up towards him.
“Go away!” called out Harry, not bothering to look up to see who it was. He hoped that his voice held enough edge in it to scare whoever it was away. A deadly silence followed, and for a split second, Harry thought he’d succeeded in making the person go away. However, he was wrong as he lifted his head from his knees a moment later and looked up to see Luna appearing down at him.
The room was silent except for the heavy breathing and the wet sound of lube. Harry quickly screwed the lid back onto the jar, careful not to get any on the sheets. He had learned the hard way rather quickly how messy lube could get when left open. Harry then kissed the back of Draco’s neck as he ran his hands softly up and down his sides briefly before coming to rest on his ass. With one hand, he then pulled one of the cheeks to the side as the other held onto his cock and guided it to Draco’s entrance.
“Yes, yes. Of course,” said Harry as he closed the door behind Draco as he stepped into the foyer and took in all of Grimmauld Place. It had long ago changed from that drab, dark place it had been during the war. One of the first things that Harry had done before moving into it permanently was hiring a team of decorators and contractors, both muggle and magic to redo the entire place top to bottom.
Harry sat off in the far corner of the common room on one of his favourite swishy armchairs, nursing a butterbeer. Neville was seated in the chair adjourned to his. Like Harry, Neville instead sits on the outskirts observing everyone else make drunken fools of themselves than participate. Neville tried to make conversation with Harry; however, Harry wasn’t into it. It’s not that Harry didn’t like Neville or want to talk. He did. He considered Neville to be one of his good friends. It was just that he was distracted tonight.
But as much as Harry did his best to take care of himself and make sure he did everything properly, his little bubble of bliss soon came to a crashing halt.
Harry stared at his reflection in the mirror and sighed at what he saw. His hair was stuck up at all different ends, there were four days worth of stubble on his face. He looked like shit, he thought. He didn’t look like the person that deserved to go out with Draco Malfoy. He knew this was going to be a bad idea, but Draco was already fucking downstairs in his foyer, waiting for him. He couldn’t fucking bail now. He really did like Malfoy and wanted to make this work.
However, Hermione and Ron would probably still have doubts and concerns, naturally, once they found out about Malfoy and him. Of course, if it went in that direction. It was still way too early to tell if this thing between them would go anywhere, let alone a third date.
As Harry anxiously waited for Draco’s reply, he hopped into the shower, not quite remembering the last time he’d taken one.
As they continued to get lost in the kiss, Harry began to allow his hands to wander. His fingers rubbed at the outside of Draco’s thighs, from the middle to the beltline and back, enjoying the sensation of the soft wool of Draco’s pants against the pads of his fingers. Draco still had his arms around Harry’s neck, his fingers playing with the soft curls at the back of it.
“Oh. um. A flat white. No sweetener,” fumbled Harry nervously. He was suddenly finding it hard to string words together.
On the other hand, Draco loved parties, both attending and throwing them; he oozed confidence in a crowd. The blond positively shined when schmoozing with people. It was one of many things Harry admired about the man.
Harry made a noise in agreement. However, it probably had everything to do with how good Malfoy’s mouth looked with milk foam on it and nothing to do with what the blond had just said. “Whatcha get?” asked Harry in a rush as he hooked his fingers around the handle of the cup and took a long sip from his drink.
Harry spent the rest of the day cleaning and getting the house in top form for his date with Malfoy. His energy levels were good. They weren’t low or high. They were level for once. Normal, some would call it. Stable his doctors would say. It helped that he’d remembered to take his medication that morning. He didn’t usually take it. Some days he forgot, some he couldn’t be bothered to.
Harry hated how everyone couldn’t just let him be happy for once and truly enjoy this good thing he had going for himself for once in years. Telling Draco would just put a damper on everything. Harry didn’t want that. He didn’t want Draco to look at him with pity like he saw Hermione and Ron do sometimes when he found it hard to get out of bed. Or walking on eggshells around him when they thought he might lose it and go off on them. He didn’t want Draco to be like that around him. He only ever wanted Draco to look at him with those small soft smiles and bright grey eyes. He wanted nothing but those little adoring looks.
Harry smirked into the nape of Draco’s neck at hearing this. He already sensed that he was driving the blond mad, but hearing this breathless confession made his heart sore. He loved hearing how the simple touch of his hand could make this beautiful specimen of a man squirm and lose control.
Alcohol coursed through Harry’s bloodstream, making him feel utterly relaxed and not having a care in the world. It seemed he only felt like this on Friday nights as he danced and laughed with his friends. He was not caring for once if he looked like an idiot. Somber Harry hated dancing. He never really knew how to move his body or what to do with his hands. But drunk Harry, that was a different story. He was a confident drunk and loved to feel the vibrations of the music take over him. He loved the feel of other’s bodies pressed up against his own, moving all as one like one giant being or something. He had been dancing in a circle of friends with Ron on one side of him and Hermione on the other. Neville was dancing beside Hermione’s other side. Next to Neville was Luna, then Seamus, then Ron. There was laughter and giggles as they all let loose and threw their hands up in the air.
” slurred Harry as the pleasure built within. He tried not to lose himself too quickly, though, in the rhythm of pumping into Draco. As much as he wanted to cum, he wanted it to last a bit longer. His hand gripped Draco’s hip as his other came up behind and took hold of Draco’s cock once again. His touch was deep and rough, just like how he knew Draco liked it.
It wasn’t until Draco made an impatient noise that Harry moved things further along. He pulled at the gauzy underwear, pushing it down Draco’s ass and thighs to his knees, before beginning to stroke the cock.
“Fuck,” swore Harry as he pawed at his cock through the already damp cotton of his briefs, taking in the sight of Draco in a thong. He’d seen his boyfriend in a thong before. Draco preferred wearing them over traditional men’s briefs, especially when wearing tight trousers. However, the sight never lost its magic for Harry. It didn’t seem to matter how many times he caught a glance of Draco’s perfect small round ass swallowing the small string of fabric between its cheeks. It always sent a shiver of arousal through him. “You’re beautiful.”
And then everything changed. Dumbledore was dead, and Harry had to fight. When he had broken up with Ginny after the funeral, what he’d told her was true. That those last couple of weeks with her had been like something out of someone else's life, Harry knew deep down, no matter how hard he had tried to convince himself that Ginny was the one, that it was all just an act. That he didn’t love her, not in the way that he wanted to and not in the way that Ginny deserved.  Harry had used Voldemort as the reason at the time for their break up. And he’d been right; if Voldemort had known Ginny was his girlfriend, he would’ve used her again to get to Harry. However, looking back, Harry knew the real reason he had ended it with Ginny when he did was also that he would be the one to hurt and use her in the end.
Hermione couldn’t help but wrinkle her nose in disgust as the strong smell of dampness and unwashed flesh hit her. She brought the pale pink scarf that was woven around her neck up to her mouth and neck, covering it as she took a small step into the room.
“You know there was one time where I couldn't stand to deal with Harry. It almost cost our friendship,” explained Hermione casually as if she was commenting on how the sky was blue.
Luna continued to look at him for a second longer before her face broke out into a bright grin as a sudden brilliant idea struck her.
Harry stumbled as he got up, but he forced his legs to move. He will not surrender, he thought. Not yet.
Ginny had wanted to get back together after the war. Everyone had thought they would too. But Harry has much as he wished and hoped he could, he couldn’t. He was a mess after the war and didn’t want to continue to live a lie. He was tired of putting others first and doing what was expected of him. As much as it terrified him, he wanted to be free and his true self for once.
Draco just shook his head. “You aren’t even fighting me. You’re still in fucking bed.” The blond gestured towards the bed, where Harry still sat. He glared at the other man for a second longer before shaking his head in sad disbelief.
“He’d been drinking though. We all were. But Harry shouldn’t have been drinking with all the medication he was taking. I should’ve been monitoring him. But I wasn’t. He didn’t need to be babied that night...I thought he didn’t need to be. I didn’t want to, to be honest. So I allowed myself to pretend that everything was normal. That we were all just normal young adults partying.” She took a brief pause to take a sip from her tea and gain control over her emotions. She didn’t want this story to be a sad tale. And it wasn’t really.
Harry, in his young teens, hadn't known what it all meant. Hogwarts not having any sort of sex ed course, he was left to his own devices when learning any information on sex and the confusing feelings he was having. He’d thought about going to Hermione and asking, but the mere thought of it broke him out into a cold sweat. So he just did what he did best and compressed his feelings and thoughts deep down inside of himself.
He knew he should send an owl to Draco, telling him he was going to be late. But that required energy and strength he did not have. He hated how fucking useless he was at times like this. That he couldn’t even do the simplest thing of writing a letter to his boyfriend.
“Mocha,” spoke Draco sheepishly as he licked the foam from the corner of his mouth. “I’ve to admit, ever since you introduced me to this place Potter and those delicious dark chocolate mocha, I’ve been coming here at least once a week.”
The couple didn’t exchange another word as Draco helped Harry to his feet and led him to the bedroom. They had a routine down pat now when Harry had a depressive episode. Draco made sure that the bedroom was dark and just to Harry’s liking. He helped Harry strip down to just his briefs before climbing into the bed. Harry liked to be weighed down with blankets and pillows. Within seconds of Harry’s head hitting the pillow, he was fast asleep.
“Harry,” said Draco softly as he came to kneel beside Harry. The blond held a whimpering baby in the crook of his arm.
Harry couldn’t help but smile a little at the blond’s offers. It was a nice thought. But no amount of tea or soup would fix him. “Thanks for the offer, but I don’t want to get you sick either. I think I just need to sleep it off, you know?”
They continued to take their time exploring with tongues and hands before it became too much and the need for more took over. Clothes were then quickly discarded and left on the floor.
Draco sighed with pleasure at this. He thrust harder into Harry in response. “Fuck. You’re so tight.”
Harry debated his opinions; he could quickly draw the curtains around his bed and cast a silencing charm. Something he would’ve thought twice of doing back in Gryffindor. However, he wasn’t a teenager anymore. Well, technically, he was still a teenager by age. He was only eighteen. He just didn’t feel like one. He felt older. It didn’t feel right to jerk off anymore in a dorm room with other guys around. He much rather takes care of his needs in private. So with his erection still making itself known, Harry quickly and quietly rose to his feet, grabbing a towel and his toiletry bag off of the top of his trunk and heading out into the hallway. He didn’t bother with his glasses, leaving them on the nightstand beside the bed. He then headed to the shared boy's bathroom at the end of the hallway.
A part of him knew that Draco wouldn’t judge him or be angry with him. This wasn’t the first time Draco would come across Harry immobile on the floor. Nevertheless, that little thought always lingered in the back of his mind. There was always a first for everything. This was also the first time that Harry’s bipolar would be affecting their daughter.
Harry had returned home from a long day at the Ministry. It was the middle of the long stretch of trials for the convicted death eaters. He had felt numb and raw after hearing the long list of charges, which ultimately made him relive the battle at Hogwarts. He had come home and wanted to forget everything. He’d gone straight over to the makeshift bar, which was just an old bar cart. He’d grabbed a bottle of Firewhiskey, not bothering with a glass as he drank straight from the bottle. Usually, when he was feeling this down, he would firecall Hermione and Ron. They knew what he was going through. However, the couple at the moment was in Australia, trying to hunt down Hermione’s parents. As he drank, he thought about going to the Burrow. The Weasley's, despite their grief, would welcome him with open arms. However, he hadn’t been back there since Fred’s funeral. And he didn’t know when or if he could ever go back. It was hard enough being around the family as they grieve a son, a brother, a twin. Seeing them like that made Harry blame himself for what happened with Fred. No, he couldn’t face that guilt tonight. Or ever.  And then there was also what had happened with Ginny.
“Snap out of it!” He cried loudly in the mirror. “SNAP THE FUCK OUT OF IT!” His voice cracked at the end. He knew it was no use. He knew what the outcome would be, no matter how hard he fought with his mind. The sadness crept in.
Harry’s bipolar was still a constant battle. But things were better for him. He still had episodes of depression and mania, but Draco had learned the beginning signs of them over the years and knew what to do now when an episode occurred. Harry was still going to therapy and support groups weekly. They were still trying to come up with the right dosage of medication for him to take to make his episodes less frequent and not have him spinning into an alternate persona at times.
As his eyes continued to search Draco’s face, he found he couldn't take it any longer. Despite not wanting his first kiss with a man to be a drunken mistake. The need to kiss Draco was too overpowering. The need to find out what kissing a man would feel like. Would it be like kissing a girl, soft and wet? Or would it be rough and hard? He needed to know.
“You bastard!” cried Draco in mock rage. “You’re late!” He hit Harry lightly on the chest. Harry caught the hand with his own and brought it up to his lips to kiss, his eyes never leaving Draco’s face.
Harry didn’t know why he’d done it. He hadn’t been thinking. That was the problem. He hadn’t been thinking. He’d just let his body work on its own accord, not stopping to think about the fucking consequences of his actions. He loathed himself even more than he’d previously.
Over the last few months, Harry had developed a crush on Malfoy. He’d always had a thing for blonds and it wasn’t until he’d gotten to know the softer side of Draco that Harry realized his feelings. Of course, their friendship hadn’t started off easy by any means. They had put each through a lot during their Hogwarts days. But Draco Malfoy was a changed man. He wasn’t the same snarky pompous ass he’d been at school.  And Harry was all for putting the past in the past.
Harry knew he should get back on the horse as they said and start living his life. He knew that being bipolar wasn’t a curse and he shouldn’t let it define him. But at times it did feel like that, a curse. He wasn’t in control of his emotions at times and he hated that unknown feeling. He never knew when he would completely lose it.
Harry smiled weakly back at Draco. He shrugged his shoulders, suddenly feeling a little lost on the dance floor without his boyfriend. He stood there for what seemed like forever, watching Draco and Pansy do their disco routine before Luna came up beside him.
"Yeah," replied Harry as he looked over his shoulder and met Draco's eye, smiling devilishly at him.  He was in a really good mood, he thought.
Harry pulled his mouth away from Draco’s tip, making a popping noise as he did so, and grinned sheepishly up at the blond. “Don’t you want to?” he asked playfully as he gently continued to stroke Draco’s shaft. His touch was soft and teasing. He knew he must be driving Draco wild and that was exactly what he wanted.
The couple stayed like this, dancing as one for a few seconds longer. They were both too lost in each other to take in the rest of their surroundings. At that moment, it was just the two of them in the middle of the dance floor.
“What?” asked Harry in confusion. It couldn’t just be over. He should at least be allowed to explain himself first, he thought. Draco wasn’t even giving him a chance.
He was surprised to see Harry in a good mood. Today had been one of his therapy days and, usually, Harry came back feeling pretty crappy about himself. It must’ve been a good session, he thought. He was glad to see his boyfriend smiling and carefree for once. Not that Harry was constantly moody or anything. It just seemed to take a lot to make Harry happy some days.
Ever since their first date, when Draco explained to Harry how his name meant dragon, he couldn’t get the image of a dragon out of his head.
The two lovers continued to glare intensely at each other for a second longer before Draco let out a deep sigh and abruptly turned away from Harry. He couldn’t be here, he thought suddenly. If he stayed any longer he would say or do something stupid that he would regret
The alcohol and medication he was on didn’t mix well. In general alcohol only seemed to add fire to his already unbalanced brain chemistry. It fucked with his head. The first two or three drinks always felt good, amazing even. But then an hour or so in, the rose-tinted glasses he’d been wearing that whole time would be lifted off of his face and darkness would settle around him. He would get extremely down and sad within a matter of seconds. It didn’t seem to matter who he was with or what was going on around him at the moment or if he was mid-laugh mid- conversation. The darkness always found him.
“Good night, Potter,” said Draco softly, his eyes darkening slightly as he took a small step closer to Harry. The blond then leaned forward and kissed Harry goodnight. It could hardly count as a proper kiss. But it was the promise of something.
It had been several months since his last depressive episode. It’d been right before the baby had been born. That was four months ago now. Just yesterday he’d been the happiest man on the planet. He hated how he’d thought he was out of the woods. How he allowed himself to be optimistic for once in his bloody life. He’d hoped it was all over, but then the darkness crept out of fucking nowhere.
Harry shook his head. No, he wasn’t physically hurt. Just mentally. He let out a shaky breath before biting down hard on his lower lip. He could feel himself being close to losing it again and he didn’t want to. He tried to blink back the tears but they came anyway. They filled his eyes before falling one by one down his cheeks.
Harry’s hands continued to cup the sides of Malfoy’s face, pulling his mouth close to his. His tongue darted around the warm concaves of the blond’s mouth before slipping out and sucked softly on the bottom lip before running his tongue along the edge of his teeth. Harry couldn’t help but marvel at how good Malfoy tasted. There was a sweetness there. The blond tasted like honey in some odd way.
Draco let out a soft series of moans and cries of approvals as Harry made his way down to his cock. Harry hadn’t meant to find himself on his knees so quickly, but here he was. His fingers hovered over the waistband of Draco’s briefs His green eyes looked up at Draco before moving any further. He only wanted to go as far as Draco wanted to. He didn’t want to push the blond towards rushing into something too quickly.
Draco Malfoy materialized suddenly out of nowhere. Like Harry, he too had a shopping basket swinging from the crook of his arm. The blond had his back towards Harry as long fingers touched and picked up peaches before discarding them. It looked like Draco had the same craving as Harry to find the perfect, unbruised peach this morning.
“Are you sick?” asked Draco after a moment had passed. His grey eyes bore into Harry taking in his appearance.
Draco nodded his head. He remembered the whole conversation quite clearly. He’d played it over in his head numerous times over the months.
He rolled slowly onto his back and looked up at the ceiling, listening for a second or two. He felt groggy and out of sorts like he usually did when he woke up suddenly in the middle of the night from a deep sleep. He let out a wild sound of a yawn before stretching out his legs and getting out of bed.
Harry knew if he continued to stay there, allowing for Draco’s tongue to lick and kiss his skin that he would be cumming in a matter of seconds. And as much as he wanted to cum and release himself, he wanted to make Draco feel good too. It was his birthday, after all. He wanted this night to be only about Draco and what he wanted.
“Thank you!” sighed Draco dramatically from his side of the bed. The mattress squeaked and shifted as the blond turned onto his side and placed a pillow over his head.
Draco continued to suck Harry off until he couldn’t take it any longer. As good as it all felt, they both wanted more. Draco kissed his way up to Harry’s torso to his chest. His tongue flicked playfully at his nipples before sucking on each of them hard and filthy.
Draco nodded his head before turning his attention to the task at hand. The tip of his smooth, hard cock poised at the entrance of Harry’s body for a second before moving forward.
Draco immediately responded to Harry’s touch as he threw his arms around Harry’s neck and returned the kiss happily. They stayed like this for a moment as their mouths pressed and moved hungrily against each other. Harry slid his hands down the side of Draco’s face to his hips, holding him firmly in place against the wall. Draco ran his hands through Harry’s curls before cupping the sides of his face and pulling his mouth closer against his. His tongue parted Harry’s lips and began to explore.
Just as Harry turned towards the fridge and began to pull out a carton of eggs and milk, the weather outside shifted and so did his mood. The sunny, blue skies that had once promised him the perfect day, was no longer as grey clouds rolled in and it began to rain. Now the weather didn’t always trigger Harry and his moods. He rather liked the rain, very much. But not today. His brain took it as a sign from the universe that he wasn’t allowed to be happy, that he would never get to have the happiness he saw his friends experiencing.
Was this what he thought it was? He had heard of speakeasies, but he didn’t know any were still in existence. He ran a hand carelessly through his hair, not giving a fuck if it made it look more wild than usual as he slowly descended the stairs.
normal.” He rubbed at the side of his face before running his hands through his hair. Forgetting that his glasses were perched there, he knocked them askew and flew across the room. Harry blushed embarrassedly as both he and Luna looked towards the glasses, where they lay in the middle of a row of desks, just a few feet away.
They’d gone through with meeting a young expectant mother who was a muggle-born. They had the nursery up and ready to go. Everything had been put into place. It wasn’t until the baby had been born, that things changed. The mother had had a change of heart and decided to keep her baby. They’d both understood the mother’s decision not to go through with the adoption, but understanding didn’t take the pain away. The incident had caused Harry to go into a downward spiral. He’d been looking forward to finally expanding his family and becoming a father.
Just when his life had been starting to feel like his own again, after everything he’d gone through with The Dursleys and then Voldemort, the universe was handing him a third fuck you, Harry Potter! At this point, it felt like he would never truly get to live the normal, easy, simple life he craved. And then there in the middle of all this, Harry was also coming to terms with his sexuality.
“I’m not hiding out,” replied Draco as he smacked his lips together and closed the tube of lipgloss before holding it out to Pansy. “I just needed to powder my nose.”
The address was correct. Harry looked up from his phone and once again studied the exterior of the building. It still didn’t look right; he thought as he chewed on his bottom lip.
“How was therapy?” asked Draco as he brushed his hair out of his face and braced himself for Harry’s answer. He knew that Harry wouldn’t give him any details on what they talked about. And Draco didn’t want to know. What Harry talked about with his therapist was a private matter. Draco just asked more in a sense of knowing what side of Harry he would be dealing with for the rest of the night. Happy, go-lucky Harry or sad and withdrawn Harry.
Ron looked at Hermione then at Harry before nodding his head in understanding. He didn’t say a word as he reached out and squeezed Hermione’s hand before exiting the room.
Harry didn’t know what to make of this information. He’d never heard of the term pansexual before. He’d never heard anyone describe themselves as one as Luna had. He’d never heard anyone say that they are simple like everyone, no matter their gender.  It made sense to him to hear Luna describe herself as this. But it still didn’t comfort him in the slightest that he was gay.  Luna was used to being different and having people talk about her behind her back. Harry wasn’t. Well, he was used to people looking at him and talking about him. However, he wasn’t used to people talking badly about him or judging him. Unless you count most of the fourth year and a little of the fifth year. Being gay only drew more attention to himself, something he didn’t want.
Instead, Harry turned onto his side and curled up around his daughter. He lay there, watching the soft rise and fall of her chest.
The birds were singing a joyful tune outside the bedroom window, calling Harry like a shimmer of hope out of his slumber.
The house was eerily quiet as he stepped through the Floo and brushed the ash from his hair and shoulders.
“Ron, why don’t you go downstairs and make Harry some food,” spoke Hermione as she turned to address her boyfriend. She knew that Harry was more likely to be willing to talk to her about Draco if Ron wasn’t present. It wasn’t that Ron wouldn’t understand. It was just that Harry seemed to come to Hermione more about his romantic relationships than Ron.
“Yes. But not yet. Not like this,” Draco hissed back as he tried to regain some control of the situation.
There was an awkward pause in conversation as Harry waited for the hostess to say something, but when she didn’t, he continued. “I’m looking for ‘The Funk Room’?” He held his breath, half expecting this tall posh woman to snort in his face. However, she didn’t.
Draco and Hermione shared a smile before Hermione was offering more tea to Draco, who gladly accepted.
It looked more like some posh restaurant than a club to him. A posh restaurant wouldn’t be out of place for Draco to have his birthday party, but Harry was pretty sure that it was meant to be a club. He recalled, pretty clearly, the blond going on and on about wanting to go out dancing for his big day.
Classical music greeted him as he pushed open the heavy glass doors of the building and entered. A tall woman with ebony skin stood behind a desk a few feet away from the doors, slightly hidden away from the street view.
There was an awkward silence as Draco took in this information. Harry studied him for a second before focusing his attention anywhere else. He watched as a group of students came into the cafe. They were all rosy-cheeked and wore big smiles as they talked loudly about something. Harry watched as two boys shoved each other playfully back and forth before being told off by one of the girls in the group to knock it off. The interaction immediately made him think about how he and Ron had been during Hogwarts. He sometimes wished he could go back to those simpler days when all he had to worry about was exams and killing the Dark Lord. They hadn’t seemed simple at the time. But now in comparison to his constant battle with bipolar, they were like walks in the park.
Harry was quiet. He just stared at Luna in disbelief. He was used to her saying strange things. But this was on an entirely new level, even for her.
Sobriety had been hard at first. He hadn’t quite known how to socialize without a drink in his hands when others did. Despite brunch on Sundays at the Burrow or just hanging with Ron and Hermione, all his social life happened in pubs or at parties at someone’s flat. He knew he didn’t need a drink to have a good time. But he hated feeling left out when everyone was getting wasted just because it was Friday night or any night for that matter and they could. His old school friends always seemed to be able to find any excuse to celebrate and throw a party. Maybe it was the fact that they’d all been forced to grow up too fast in the last year of the war and they knew how precious life was.
“I love you,” whispered Harry softly. He didn’t know if it was too soon in their relationship to be saying this. He’d never been good in the past at judging when an appropriate time was. He always either said it too soon or too late. But Harry had needed to get it off of his chest. He’d been feeling deeply about Draco for some time now, and he couldn’t wait any longer.
“But don’t you wish to be normal?" pressed on Harry, not understanding Luna's desire to be different, not understanding at all her easy acceptance of being different.
Harry found his hands immediately going to Draco’s face. They cupped the sides of his cheeks, pulling him close to him.
“I’m trying to be honest. I’m trying to give people a chance...to get to know the real me,” Harry’s voice broke slightly on the last word. He hadn’t meant to break down like this. He hadn’t really when he’d told the others. But coming out to Draco was the most important, he guessed. He wanted Draco to see him for who he really was and not the outgoing, eccentric manic side of himself or the sad, depressing side. He wanted him to see every side of himself and not the two versions that were constantly at battle, butting heads.
Draco moaned and encouraged Harry to go harder as he lifted his hips and matched Harry’s thrusts. He resisted the natural urge to close his eyes as he wrapped his hand around his aching cock and twisted it upwards.
Harry’s bright face faded into a frown, forehead creased and eyebrows drew close together as he looked out the kitchen window and saw the rain pour down. And then just like that, his mood sank.
“Jeesh, Draco you make it seem like I had a choice or something,” spoke Hermione, laughing slightly as she sat down opposite Draco. They were seated outside on the small garden patio at the back of the cottage. The early summer sun was just beginning to set in the distance.
“It’s okay, Harry,” spoke Luna softly as she crossed her legs and sat down in front of Harry. She reached out and took his right hand and squeezed it.
“You came back,” whispered Harry as he opened his eyes and looked up at Draco, sleepily. “I thought you weren’t.”
But he didn’t move. He couldn’t move. The heaviness was still there, sitting upon him like a bag of rocks. He blew out a deep breath, twisting the bedsheet which covered him tightly in his hands. He was frustrated with himself. He hated how useless he was. He wanted to get up and function like a normal human but his body wouldn’t work.
“Because no one else knows what it is like,” spoke Draco almost shyly as he played with his now empty cup.
He’d even allowed Pansy to do his make-up. It was nothing over the top, just some contouring and eyeliner to enhance his natural features. He often liked to play around with make-up to make himself look more feminine and so on. He loved the endless possibilities that make-up could give him to change up his features and look. Playing around with different coloured eyeshadows and blush was fun; he didn’t understand why more people didn’t do it. To Draco, it was just another way to express himself.
Not another word was spoken as Harry pulled briefly out of Draco, and they rearranged themselves on the bed with Draco lying down on his back, his legs thrown over Harry’s shoulders as his boyfriend entered him once again.
It started as a small prickle in the centre of his chest, like an itch. He pulled at the collar of his shirt and pressed the heel of his right hand to his chest and rubbed at it for a second. His eyes continued to bore into the television screen, but he was no longer paying attention to what was happening. The itch soon turned into pressure of sorts, spreading outwards.
So on that first Friday of the school year, Seamus had broken open a bottle of Firewhiskey and, hence, the first party's start.
The music pounded around them as they continued to dance. Harry tried to keep some distance between him and Draco. However, the sea of people dancing around them was making it fucking hard to maintain. After a second or two of fighting it, Harry gave up. Deciding he could just blame it on the sweaty dancing bodies that enveloped them if someone asked why he was dancing so close to his former enemy.
“I don’t usually. But I could make an exception for you.” His voice dropped slightly, taking on a low flirtatious tone. He’d suddenly found his footing again as he smiled at the blond before turning to open the door. He didn’t wait for Malfoy to respond, already assuming the answer.  Draco just shook his head in bewilderment before quickly following Harry into the house.
“Mhm!” huffed Hermione in disaprovement. “I really wish you would let me and Ron come over when you feel like that.” She knew that the last thing that Harry wanted was for her and Ron to be around, hovering over him when he was in a bad place. But, she was always afraid that one of these days that Harry would sink so low into himself that he wouldn’t be able to get out. He’d never done anything in the past to make her worry about it. However, she’d read enough to know it was a possibility that Harry might decide he’d had enough of living.
At some point, someone did the necessary cleaning and protection spells needed before engaging in anything further below the waist. Harry waited for the always awkward discussion on who would bottom and who would top. Harry didn’t have a preference. He liked both if he was honest. He liked these things to come naturally, so he always relied on his partners to make the first move on who would do what. Since Draco was already on top, it only seemed right that that was the way things would go.
It was the early morning hours, so he luckily didn’t run into a soul as he made the long awkward walk towards the bathroom. Pushing open the heavy wooden door, Harry quickly made his way to a shower stall at the far end of the room. He hung his towel on the small hook beside the stall before shoving his boxers down and stepping out of them. He couldn’t help but moan slightly as his erection sprung free from its prison. Harry then stepped into the shower stall with his toiletry bag in hand and closed the curtain behind him.
They both groaned at the same time. Harry closed his eyes briefly as the feel of being encased in the tightness of Draco’s flesh washed over him.
At first, he had been diagnosed with PTSD and put on antidepressants right away. Those had helped for the first few months, but then suddenly it was like his body was rejecting them. He would go through mixed states where he was constantly anxious and agitated. Wired but tired, as his doctor had described it. And the cycle just kept on repeating. He would have a depressive episode that could last anywhere between two weeks to a few months, followed by having a sudden burst of energy and then followed by another depressive episode. It took about two full years, though, after that first dark episode before he was properly diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.
“You don’t look sick. But I haven’t heard from you in the last two days and then when you didn’t show up tonight...I thought the worst had happened. But here you are tucked up nicely in bed.”
“Why did you come here, Draco?” asked Hermione. This wasn’t the first time that the blond had wanted to discuss Harry. But Draco never just popped over suddenly out of the blue like he had tonight. He was so formal with making arrangements. There was usually an owl sent with several times and dates to pick from.
Draco was hesitant at first. Potter did know his love of chocolate and coffee and he did have a few minutes to spare before he had to be at work. “Alright!”
“Why would I be disgusted?” asked Luna softly. She titled her head to the side and locked eyes with Harry.
The sounds of Gilda could be heard from the other room as Harry just stared at the fireplace, lost in thought. He felt like crying. He hoped that Malfoy would be true to his word and would indeed owl him. However, he knew that the possibility of that happening was slim to none. Why on earth would Malfoy owl him for another date? Yes, they’d had a good time over coffee but that was it. Harry had hardly been present last night and now this. Malfoy probably thought the worst of him. The blond was probably thinking that Harry was messed up and that he had dodged a bullet.
Not when he’d found Harry up at 2 am, painting the kitchen a bright lemon yellow because he’d promised Draco months ago to do so. Or when they had gone to Greece for their first anniversary and Harry had spent the entire trip curled up in bed. Or when Harry lost his temper at the smallest of things like when his Quidditch team lost a match or Draco hadn’t washed his favourite sweater yet, the one he’d planned on wearing to The Burrow for lunch.
There was a brief pause as Draco positioned himself at Harry’s hole. His grey eyes flickering to Harry’s face for reassurance.  Harry locked eyes with Draco and nodded his head firmly.
A low wail of pain escaped from the back of his throat as the tears finally began to fall down his cheeks and he allowed them to. There was no more fight left in him.  He bit down hard on his bottom lip, drawing blood, but he took no notice. He squeezed his eyes shut and began to rock slowly back and forth on the seat.
Harry didn’t say anything to this. He just continued to watch Draco through blurry eyes for a second before closing his eyes and letting out a deep breath. He could hear Draco opening and shutting drawers before the scratching sound of a quill filled the stillness of the room. Harry wanted to ask what the other man was up to, but he couldn’t muster the energy to form the words with his tongue.
A silence then stretched on for a second or two as Luna continued to look at Harry with a goofy smile on her face. She looked at him like someone who looks at a kitten—something that is so utterly adorable it makes you want to cry.
“Because...because you said you couldn’t deal with me...” Harry's voice trailed off as a sudden wave of emotion took over him. “Last time, you left...you never came back.”
It was childish of him to be like this with his medication. He knew he should take it every single morning. It was there to help him. However, Harry hated the idea of relying on pills to make him functional. Hermione always scolded him like a child when she found out he wasn’t taking his medication properly. He knew she counted his pills when she came over. Harry knew the medication made him feel better about himself and helped curve his depression and so forth. But he was still as stubborn as he was back at Hogwarts. Maybe even more.
“I dunno,” shrugged Harry. “It wasn’t something I told anyone. Besides Hermione and Ron, no one really knew.”
“I have to tell you something,” blurted out Harry suddenly. His voice rose slightly as he sat up straight in his chair like someone had zapped him suddenly with a taser gun, shooting an electric current through him.
It was times like these that he wished that actual magic existed in the world. That with the snap of his fingers or the wave of a wand, he could be dressed and pristine. But, no, magic didn’t exist. Harry was left to his own stupid uselessness to get ready and make himself look decent for his boyfriend’s birthday party.
Harry, who had been the boy to walk to his death, ran from the room in utter shame, not daring to look at anyone as he fled.
As Harry’s cock hardened, he began to move his hips, thrusting in and out of Draco’s hungry mouth. Draco responded to this by locking his lips around Harry’s shaft and sucking harder. Harry lifted his hips and pushed his cock further up into Draco’s throat with each thrust, giving the blond as much of his swollen cock as he could handle.
Harry opened his wallet and waited to hear what the coat charge would be. But the man behind the counter just grinned at Harry as he handed him over a numbered ticket. “Enjoy your evening.”
Draco didn’t say anything as his heart began to race and continued to take in the dragon’s details on the coin pendant. He was at a loss for words for once. The necklace was beautiful and better than anything else he’d received tonight for his birthday. He swallowed roughly over the sudden lump in his throat. There were a million things he wanted to say to Harry at this moment to convey what he was feeling. But words failed him. He didn’t know how to put his deep feelings towards the man beside him into words, and besides, The Funk House didn’t seem like the right setting to do so either. So instead, the blond smiled and bought a hand up to the side of Harry’s face.
Harry immediately felt the heat in the cheeks as he turned a deep crimson in embarrassment. Never before had he been called beautiful.
“You can't do that. It's my decision to go or not. Not yours. Paul from group therapy stopped seeing his therapist and went almost completely off his meds too.”
“Why aren’t you more disgusted? Why are you treating me so nicely?” pressed on Harry in annoyance. He didn't deserve Luna's kindness, he thought. She should be disgust and appalled by him as Ginny had been. Like how everyone will be after they found out the truth.
Draco just stared at Harry’s back for a long second. That was not at all the answer he’d been expecting to come out of Harry’s mouth just now. Since they’d gotten back together Harry had always gone to therapy. Every Tuesday and Thursday. There was a calendar on the nearby wall with Harry’s schedule along with when he was to take his medication. To Draco’s knowledge, therapy was good for Harry. It helped in his recovery and stabilized his moods. Not going was like a red flag of sorts, a warning sign. Or so he’d read about in the numerous books on mental illnesses he could get his hands on at the nearby library, and what he’d learned from others who had bipolar partners and loved ones. He’d been attending a support group for loved ones of bipolar patients.
Draco smirked in delight at hearing this. He loved the power he had over his boyfriend just by simply choosing to wear a more flimsy piece of underwear. He'd had partners in the past who hadn’t been as approving of his underwear choice or simply didn’t care as Harry did.
"What do you want?" asked Harry in a hoarse whisper. His heart was racing in anticipation of what Draco’s answer would be. He was willing to do anything the blond suggested. He was up for anything.
Harry stood at the display of pink and red boxes for a second or two, just staring at them in slight disbelief. He couldn’t believe it was Valentine’s Day already. He knew some time had passed since New Year’s. But some days, it felt like only yesterday that Draco had broken his heart. He had talked at length with his therapist about Draco and the breakup. They were still trying to get to the bottom of why Harry hadn’t told Draco about this disorder in the first place.
The snow just seemed like another burden he would have to face today. The snow meant that his twenty-minute walk to the grocery store would be hard and grueling as he tracked his way through the slush- and ice-covered sidewalks.
Harry was the first to act. His head was buzzing as his body seemed to reach out for Malfoy on its own accord. Hands came to rest on either side of the blond’s face. He held him there for a second, glazing into his eyes before bringing his mouth down onto his.
Harry reached out with both of his hands and cupped the sides of Draco’s face. The couple looked at each other for a second longer before Harry pulled Draco’s mouth onto his in a passionate kiss.
Guilt and shame twisted painfully in his stomach as he just sat there like a sack of potatoes listening to his daughter’s cries. He hated how useless he felt at this very moment. His brain argued with his body. An inner battle he was constantly having. He should be moving, he should be rising to his feet and going to his daughter’s aid. However, he stayed immobile. Like his body had suddenly been paralyzed.
Harry just stared at the blond in disbelief for a second before nodding his head. He was suddenly filled with hope.
Draco immediately stopped dancing and turned on the spot to face Harry. His face broke into a grin when he saw the other man’s face. A lazy smile appeared across Harry’s in return.
He couldn’t help but smile slightly as he rose slowly up onto his elbows, careful not to shake the bed too much as he did so. Reaching out with his left hand, he traced a gentle finger along the plump curve of Nova’s doughy cheek. He resisted the urge to pick up the sleeping infant. He didn’t want to wake her.
His eyes grew dark as the sense of longing to join the blond grew stronger with each passing second as he continued to watch Draco. Harry wanted the man in every way possible. His cock twitched with interest as Draco shook that perfect tight little ass in his direction. Draining the remainder of his drink in one fluid motion, Harry ran his hands through his hair, welcoming the sensation of alcohol coursing through his bloodstream.
Harry’s hands traced the ridges of Draco’s spine as their bodies began to rock back and forth against one another. They shared a long passionate kiss, each enjoying the sensation of their hardened cocks rubbing together.
He felt disoriented as he tried to wake up from his sleepy state. He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he's had. He laid there confused for a second looking out at the moonlight shining in from the window. It was dark outside now, he noted. He didn’t know what the time was but figured he must have been asleep for a couple of hours.
Harry’s mouth went dry at the statement. He ran a hand through his curls as he looked from Draco’s face back down to his ass. He was unbelievably turned on at the thought of Draco wearing the plug, dancing and shaking his hips like he’d been all night at the club. “That’s bloody hot.”
“Okay,” mumbled Draco after a long pause. Despite the awkwardness and the weird withdrawnness of Harry, Draco did want to make this thing, whatever it was, last. He liked Potter. Like, liked-liked him. Like really fucking liked him. He’d always had a bit of a crush on Harry growing up. At the time of course he would’ve denied it, saying the only feelings he had for Potter were hatred and loathing. But now as a grown-ass man, Draco could see that he’d secretly liked Potter and had hidden it by mocking him, constantly. The blond had been happy to settle for Harry’s friendship, but when Harry had made his intentions known four days ago, that he too liked Draco and wanted to take him out on a date, he’d been over the moon.
“I have incredibly low periods. So low that I can barely move. I am impossible to be around. I’m unreliable as a friend...in fact, in some ways, I’m probably the worst friend to have,” Harry rambled on in one long breath. Now that the gates of communication had been opened, he couldn’t seem to stop. “And sometimes I have incredibly high periods. So high I feel like I can do anything. I create this endless list of projects for myself. I don’t usually sleep during these times. I’m so wired up like I’m having coffee pumped through my bloodstream 24/7. And when I crash, I crash so fucking hard.” Harry nervously bit his lip as he looked away from Draco and out the window. He could feel his pulse racing as he tried to gain control of his emotions. He suddenly felt very vulnerable and exposed, sitting there with Draco’s grey eyes on him.
“Fuck,” cursed Harry as his eyes snapped open and he looked towards the hallway. He shoved his glasses back onto the bridge of his nose before he moved.
Harry didn’t respond to this. He knew that his friends worried about him. They were the only ones who knew about his condition. They’d been with him when the doctor had diagnosed him with Bipolar Disorder.
Harry stared at the broken shards of pottery on the floor, laying only a few feet away from where he sat against the cabinet door. His eyes blurred with unshed tears as a familiar storm of darkness rained over him.
“You know when you asked me...if I was sick...on New Year’s,” Harry couldn’t bring himself to say the actual words break up.
“No. No. No. No, it’s not that!” said Harry in a rush, realization quickly dawning on him. “I don’t feel obligated.”
All kinds of thoughts raced through Harry’s mind as he sat there waiting for his husband to return home. He didn’t know how much time passed while the baby’s cries continued to increase in volume. There was probably a spell or something he could do, but his magic was shit when he was in a mood. He had a hard time controlling it when he was in a depressed state and didn’t want to take the chance of it going wrong where the baby was involved.
It didn’t take long afterwards before they were both losing control and coming, shouting out in completion as they did so.
You could say that Harry had always had a little thing for Draco. An obsession of sorts. One that he had masked over the years with pretending to loathe him. They said there was a fine line between love and hate, which was very valid for Harry and Draco.
Harry jumped at the sudden voice behind him. He tore his eyes away from the dancing mass of people to a broad-shouldered man. “Hi,” said Harry flatly to the man he noticed was standing in a small room off to the side.
Harry opened his mouth to reply but the words got stuck in the back of his throat. He was scared of what Draco would think of him; of how he just sat there on the kitchen floor as their daughter cried.
Harry closed his eyes shut, throwing back his head and giving Draco better access to the side of his neck as his fingers slipped around and under the thin waistband of the thong.
Harry chewed on his bottom lip as he continued to scan Draco’s face. He couldn't believe how close they were at the moment. This was the closest they had ever been before. This was also the longest they’d danced together too.
“It doesn't work like that Harry. You feel good because the medication and therapy are working. If you go off of them then your mood swings will come back. Bipolar isn't something you can just fix. You can only control it.”
This was the last thing he’d expected when Draco had told him he was throwing his birthday at a club.
Draco’s tongue worked with firm pressure around the head of Harry’s cock and along the shaft. Harry could feel all the blood pooling in his groin, his cock expanding into Draco’s throat. Draco sucked hungrily, lustily at Harry. Harry moaned and whimpered, crying out sweet words of encouragement with each flick of Draco’s tongue on his tip.
“Come on, come on, come on, come on,” he whispered urgently to himself. He could hear  Malfoy calling out his name from the other room. “Fucking come on.”
Draco raised a perfectly threaded eyebrow at hearing this. The blond shifted slightly in his seat as he lowered the mug to the table. He made a small gesture with his hand, signaling Harry to continue.
Disco music blared as a crowd of dancing bodies moved like one giant organ in the middle of the room. A large disco ball hung high above, cascading a rainbow of light throughout. Harry couldn’t help but feel like he’d somewhat been transported back in time to the ‘70s.
Harry pulled back and held Draco’s face in his hands for a second. The two men stared intensely at each other.
“Fuck. I wish someone would shut that bloody door,” commented Draco as he looked over his shoulder and glared at the offending door before cradling his piping hot mug in his hands and taking a small sip from it.
Draco turned his head slightly and met Harry’s eyes. They stared at each other for a moment before Draco was snaking his fingers through the curls at the back of Harry’s neck and pulling him into a long, deep kiss.
Harry nodded his head, tightening his grip ever so slightly on Draco’s hips. Feeling the heat of Draco’s breath against his ear made his cock twitch and swell with arousal. He thrust his hips on instinct into Draco’s. He wanted Draco to feel what the man did to his body. The control he had on him. Draco smirked at feeling Harry’s half-hard cock press into him. A shiver of pleasure ran down his spine as he felt the blood rush to his cock, awakening it.
Harry just shrugged and looked down at his feet. That was the problem. He didn’t know when he would be up for it again. A heated sense of self-hatred filled the pit of his stomach at the thought. He didn’t know what type of person he would wake up to being tomorrow or the day after. He could never predict his moods and he hated it.
Draco didn't see Harry approach. He was too busy shaking his ass and leaning into Luna. The two were awkwardly twirling each other as they both sang at the top of their lungs. Draco knew he would regret all this singing later in the morning. His voice wasn't trained or accustomed really to singing so loudly. But that was a later problem. Right now, he was having too much fun to stop. He couldn't remember the last time he had a night out like this. It had been a while, he thought. He was going to enjoy it as much as he possibly could.
Hermione frowned at hearing this. “What happened Harry?” she asked after a pause. “Where’s Draco?”  She didn’t want to push. But she figured that something had happened between them to put Harry in a state like this. It had been a while since she’d seen him in such a bad way.
“You look beautiful!” remarked Pansy as she stepped towards him again. She reached upwards and adjusted the collar of his shirt. “Where is your shirt from? It’s divine.”  She ran her fingers along his shoulders, feeling the soft lushness of the fabric.
“I don’t know why you told him to leave. I’m not eating,” stated Harry matter of factly like a stubborn child.
Of course, there had been times when Draco had threatened to leave Harry. But they were just empty threats now. He would never leave Harry, no matter how hard it got at times. He loved the man and would be with him as long as Harry wanted him.
“What? Oh yeah.” Harry had forgotten about his gym bag. He felt stupid about bringing it with him. He should’ve left it back in the gym. He opened the bag’s side pocket and took out his wallet and a small silver-wrapped gift box before handing over the bag to the cloakroom clerk.
But of course, just as he was wrapping up Sasha’s session, Andrews—the owner of the gym that Harry worked at as a personal trainer called an impromptu meeting with all the other trainers.  Andrews didn’t seem to give a rat’s ass that it was Friday night and that people might have actual plans. In Harry’s opinion, it could’ve waited until the annual Monday morning meeting. It hadn’t been as dire of an issue as Andrews had made it out to be.
Draco’s eyes continued to linger on Harry’s before looking down at his dark red lips, which were just screaming to be fucking kissed. His gaze shifted back onto Harry’s eyes which were dark with lust. As much as Draco wanted to, he resisted the urge to kiss Harry. Instead, he began to sing along to the song again, this time his voice soft, only meant for Harry to hear.
His heart was beating rapidly in anticipation of what Malfoy’s response would be. He would be lying if he said he hadn’t been thinking about inviting Malfoy in all night. He hadn’t obsessed over it, but it was something that he’d thought about since parting ways with the blond the previous day. It had been so long since he’d been with someone intimately. His bipolar usually affected his sex drive.
“Why not?” asked Draco, calmly, even though his first reaction was to be pissed and irritated at Harry. He knew that getting mad wouldn’t get him anywhere. He needed to remain calm in the situation.
Harry sucked Draco off for a while, savouring the taste of him, running his tongue along Draco’s hard smooth shaft and over his heavy, swollen balls. He was gorgeous, Harry thought. His entire pubic region was shaved smooth, and Harry loved the sensation of his delicate skin in his hands. He’d had numerous other lovers who’d shaved their lower regions. Harry had never really thought of shaving down there himself. He liked his pubes and shaving he knew was too much of an upkeep. But with Draco, it worked. It was so fucking smooth and soft, that Harry couldn’t get enough of it.
