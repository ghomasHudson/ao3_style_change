‘I was awake?’ He asked the witch.
Aspen had been crunching very loudly on sugar snap peas, which were his favourite, but he stopped chewing when Harry mentioned a friend. He was quite a social fox, they had discovered, even though that was highly unusual, and Harry had seen more of his friends in the past month than ever before.
‘No way! You’re cute, ok? Deal with it.’
‘I can’t believe you ended up being good cop. How did that happen?’ He wheezed, shaking his head. Draco grinned but couldn’t really muster a proper laugh.
‘Potter what are you-’
will support you in this. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about you in the last decade, it’s that you’re honest, and I don’t think you’d make something like this up.”
‘What does it mean, Pans?’ His eyes were already drooping, and he was struggling to fight his meds long enough to hear her answer. He felt her adjust the pillows behind him so he was laying down again, although it felt more like he was drifting out to sea than laying in a hospital bed.
‘Three weeks. You’re lucky Harry has the temper he does. When he realised I’d told you about Gringotts he was determined to go after you and explain. If he hadn’t, well…’ She trailed off. She placed her outer robes on the back of the spare chair in the corner of the room and stood where the healer had been when she’d checked on him before.
‘Me too. I want to hear all about school!’ He said enthusiastically. Teddy grinned, his hair turning back to his favourite shade of turquoise save for a couple of blond strands at the front. It seemed he had marginally better control over his abilities and it warmed Draco’s heart that he mattered enough to Teddy that he wanted to mimic any part of him.
‘You don’t owe me any such thing.’ He said honestly. He didn’t resent Hermione for trying to make him stay, he understood now why she had thought it so important, and he would never have confronted half of the issues he had if she hadn’t stopped him from running away.
“Ron?” Harry called through the door. There was no sound even as Harry pressed his ear firmly against the white-painted wood to listen. He knocked loudly for good measure but quite frankly he had more pressing issues than forcing Ron out of bed. It was the weekend after all.
‘You’re too good to her.’ Harry said when she was far enough away to be out of earshot. Daphne had opened the salon even though it was supposed to be closed just so that she could give Ella her first haircut. Draco had had the idea weeks ago when he’d noticed her hair was getting too long to be manageable but had been so busy, he’d totally forgotten to arrange anything.
’s first Instagram post gets over 300 likes. It turns out one of his precious Margaret Atwood novels is a very rare edition, and bookworms all over the world want to know where he got it. His subsequent posts are just as popular, since he’s found others who are as obsessed with his perfectly organised bookshelves as he is.
‘Well, I bought the manor myself at the auction on a total whim. I’m not sure why but it felt like it was important. I stressed for ages about it and then I thought maybe I could turn it into an orphanage for magical children. I went to Kingsley and talked through the possibility of having a mix of muggle and magical staffing so that there wouldn’t be any more Tom Riddles in the world. That’s how I met Helen, she’s helping with all the muggle side of things. Paperwork, government approvals and CRB checks and all that kind of thing.’
‘BECAUSE I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU LOVE ME AND YOU’RE GOING TO LEAVE!’ Harry’s hold on him dropped. Draco could hear the shrillness of his own voice ringing in his ears, clawing at his eardrums like nails on a chalkboard.
‘You know I’m not always right and you should never apologise for coming to see me. Honestly, you have enough to say about Gryffindors but you’re being the most Gryffindor person I’ve ever met. Don’t be so stupid. I love you and I want to help you. We all do. When are you going to get that through your thick skull?’ He sighed and squeezed her tighter for a brief moment before stepping away.
‘What happened?’ The mediwitch was busy pouring out a tincture of potion but glanced at his arm. Her face remained impassive, which surprised him.
Pansy was beginning to get exasperated by Draco’s inattentiveness. He should probably be careful not to push her away too – Blaise wouldn’t even talk to him anymore because he was sick of either being ignored or hearing Draco complain about Potter, or a lack of Potter. Blaise had also taken the disappearance badly since he had a massive crush on Potter. Not that Draco had a crush of course. Draco was purely concerned about the implications of the knowledge he possessed; going to prison because of Harry
As he stood, the icy wind came whistling through his cell, blowing right through his thin clothes and making him shiver, but he didn’t let it stop him. He thought about how it had felt the first time; the low centre of gravity, the ruffle of his fur as he moved, the unusual sensation of having a tail offset by enhanced hearing and sense of smell. He imagined fur the same colour has his hair, maybe a little darker. It wasn’t easy when he still wasn’t entirely sure what animal he had become, but it was working.
‘I had planned on starting my own business, but my loan application was denied after that awful newspaper spread on Harry and his new girlfriend.’ Draco said bitterly. He’d never brought it up with Harry, but he hadn’t quite forgiven him for it. If Draco was any wiser than he was, he’d be able to admit that it wasn’t Harry’s fault. He wasn’t.
‘I won’t ask you again, Oliver. What do you want?’ Wood started trailing kisses down Harry’s neck and Draco thought he might be sick.
‘You spoke with Potter?’ Draco’s eyebrows were quickly disappearing into his hairline.
‘He’s not anyone’s! He’s not an object, he’s a person! And if he wants to be with me then that’s where he stays! I won’t give him up!’ He was screaming now, although the more raucous he got the less it seemed to bother Smith.
‘I wondered if you’d teach at the orphanage.’ Harry looked sheepish as though he expected Draco to be angry with him. ‘It’s not much, but those are the muggle papers you need to fill in before you get approval to work with children. It’s a basic criminal record check, it’s supposed to prove you’re safe. We have to have them so that any of the children in the muggle social care system can be transferred without us having to obliviate anyone.’
‘I think this is the best birthday party I’ve ever thrown.’ Harry said with a beautiful grin. He showed Ron and Hermione to the floo, as if they didn’t know where it was already, and disappeared out of view. Draco knew he should be heading off soon, but he didn’t really want to disturb Teddy too much.
‘I can do that. Can you do that? He moved out and you stopped loving him and you were always angry with him. Did he hurt you? Because you’re not supposed to love people who hurt you.’ Draco frowned. Teddy’s voice sounded so small for someone who was so wise. He wondered what it might’ve been like for him to live with Harry these past years. Draco very rarely spoke of Harry when Teddy was around, unless it was to ask him what he’d been doing or when he needed to go back home. Maybe Harry hadn’t been so careful.
‘You have no idea what it was like seeing you like that.’ Harry’s voice was thick, and he could tell he was holding in tears. Draco hoped he wouldn’t start crying; there were few things that could make Harry cry and if he did, Draco wouldn’t be far behind him.
‘This is great Malfoy. I really appreciate your support on this. I’ll have St Mungo’s contact you directly. I think in the future, you could accompany the aurors on any fieldwork concerning the case. The signature may be on file, but I’d be happier knowing someone with intimate knowledge of the issue is on hand at any given time.’
Harry decided to take a different route. “Ok, so when was the last time you saw her.” All the colour drained from Ron’s face.
‘I suppose.’ It seemed to satisfy Smith.
Harry pushed the vial into Draco’s outstretched fingers and Draco desperately tried to pull the stopper off, but his hands were shaking so badly he couldn’t do it. He heard a sob and he belatedly realised it was his own, but Harry was already taking the vial back out of Draco’s hands again. Draco cried out thinking Harry had changed his mind, but instead Harry tilted Draco’s chin up so that he was forced to look him in the eye.
‘What? What are you talking about?’
“Yes. Brutus is
Silence. They were together like that for an indeterminable length of time. Forcing himself not to think too much about everything, Harry managed to get rid of that swimming feeling. He didn’t feel very calm about the situation, but he couldn’t figure out what to do until he could think straight. He wanted to take comfort in Lyra, feeling that calm which passed over him whenever he heard her sing, but now her name jangled in his head like an alarm bell and he didn’t understand why.
The stubbornness that prevented him from expressing his childish curiosity had persisted.
‘There’s nothing to say.’ Draco said shortly. He didn’t want to talk about it and the middle of the work day was absolutely not the time or the place.
‘How much have you been drinking?’ Draco asked him. His voice came out strangled and uneven.
‘I think this might be a way we can get rid of Wood without having to put ourselves through purgatory.' Harry’s brow furrowed and he walked over to the ratty old sofa. He sat down and started turning the pages over. Draco leant against his desk and put on an air of ambivalence even though his heart was thudding heavily in his chest and he was terrified Harry would be angry with him.
‘Are you done with your random nudeness?’ He looked over his shoulder at him. He was smirking.
It was impossible for his thoughts not to stray to Potter. Granger hadn’t sugar coated anything when she’d told him that he should expect to be mistreated. He had expected that, which is why he’d kept his mouth shut all those months.
‘It’s not bad. I quite like having you to myself too.’ He pulled Draco against his side and kissed his cheek quickly. Draco pretended his cheeks didn’t flush like a teenager.
‘How did it go at the mind healer?’ She asked him once she’d finished clearing some of the surface of her desk. It occurred to Draco that he’d dropped in on her in the middle of the working week with no warning and she had work to do.
“You’re in Azkaban, boy, where you belong.” Suddenly his senses came into sharp focus and Draco realised that everything was so dark because he had just been deposited inside a cell. It shouldn’t have surprised him. In fact, he had predicted this very thing from the beginning, and yet he was still overcome with the urge to cry. Maybe part of him had thought Granger would have been able to pull it off after all.
He flipped through more pages. There was surprisingly little about his divorce, all things considered. He’d been keeping his thoughts on it to himself since he’d moved back in. It didn’t seem right to dwell on the past, it made him feel guilty for not appreciating the present. There was so much guilt. All the time.
‘What do you mean, here?’ He looked right into Harry’s eyes as Harry searched his face. He looked tired, lines of worry all over his expression. Draco knew he should be doing more for him. He had so many responsibilities between the orphanage and Draco and just being Harry Potter. He just didn’t know what he could do to help.
“I can’t believe you let this happen!” Harry watches Draco pace up and down the living room in agitation. He feels truly terrible for putting Draco in this position, but he absolutely didn’t do it on purpose.
Draco ripped into his present first. ‘Oh my!’ He exclaimed as a coil of knitted scarf fell into his lap. It was navy blue with thin Slytherin green stripes across it and the letter D on one end. He looked over at Harry who had a similar scarf in black with red stripes and a letter H. Draco was astonished.
‘Of course he has, I’m his favourite.’ He said smugly as he gave Teddy a squeeze and let him go. Teddy’s hair quickly turned platinum blond with turquoise tips and Draco was smug as all hell knowing that Teddy had changed it because of him instead of Hela. Helen.
That obviously hadn’t been applicable in Draco’s case.
‘He didn’t lie about fashion week,’ she said quietly, ‘but he’s really worried there’s something in this house. Don’t underestimate how much he cares about you. We’ve seen you go through a lot and we just want you to be happy.’ Draco felt like she was saying a thousand things all at once without really saying anything at all and he appreciated that about his ex-Slytherin friends. They always knew what to say without making a big deal about it.
it happen; it just did! It was a complete accident!” He protests. Draco pauses his pacing long enough to glare at Harry like he just told him he kicked a puppy. If only Hermione still had her time turner, he would have gone back an hour and prevented the whole thing from happening.
He didn’t know how long he’d been crying on the floor, but long after the sun set and he sat alone in the darkness, he heard a clank from outside the door. He lifted his head and waited a few minutes as footsteps retreated down the stairs. He stood and opened the door a crack to find a plate of food set on the floor. He shut the door again. He didn’t want it.
‘Oh. Yes, absolutely. How can I help?’ He said awkwardly, straightening his already perfectly straight tie.
‘I see.’ Draco said, trying his utmost to keep his tone neutral. ‘What exactly has led you to that conclusion.’
‘Uh,’ Harry blushed. ‘I was a bit busy?’ Draco shook his head in amusement at Harry’s ignorance.
‘A significant proportion of memory? What are you talking about?’ Surely, he would know if he’d forgotten something.
He only hoped it wouldn’t all be for nothing.
“You thought I didn’t?”
‘Love you too. I’ll see you later.’ He felt guilty as soon as he walked away. It wasn’t right for him to disappear every time things went wrong. But then, wouldn’t it be worse if he stayed? Teddy had already seen so much, and it wouldn’t do to have him witness a breakdown on top of everything.
When he opened the door, it was instantaneous. The chatter stopped and everyone turned to look at him. The first thing he noticed was that Sirius and Remus were sat at the same end of the table, their chairs pulled close together, their heads bent towards each other. Harry couldn’t help the smile that crossed his face knowing that he had managed to bring them together again. What surprised him though was Lyra and Ron at the other end of the table, already engrossed in a game of wizards’ chess. It was too early in the game to tell who was winning, but the concept of the two of them finding common ground had something warm blossoming in his chest.
‘Are you sure? Dad was really worried. He called like, everyone and he was shouting at everyone for not fixing you. Aunt Hermione says Dad is the best when bad things happen because he always knows what to do, but this time he was hopeless like Uncle Ron when Aunt Hermione had Rose.’ Draco huffed a laugh. When Hermione had gone into labour, Ron had quite literally lost his mind with the strangest display of adult accidental magic Draco had ever seen. Thankfully Draco and Harry had been there to make sure everything ran smoothly.
“Never take my name in vein like that again,” he said threateningly, but at the last minute he cracked a smile and the illusion was ruined.
‘I really am sorry about the bathroom.’ Draco said sheepishly for the hundredth time. Harry didn’t even look up from the paperwork he was reading.
‘What am I supposed to say to him, Mum? I know you never fully warmed to him, but you knew he’s a good person, didn’t you? I thought he was a good person, but I’m not so sure now.’ A gust of wind blew through the thick fabric of his coat and it wasn’t enough to prevent him from shivering.
Draco was still reeling from the sensation of Potter’s arm being, well,
Lyra’s objection was instantaneous. “Absolutely not. You are not going alone under any circumstances.”
“Oh! I forgot to mention that Lyra is staying with me for a while. She’s having some renovations done but I’m sure you’d know all about that.” Luna said lightly. Harry didn’t have a clue about any renovations, and he was sure he would’ve been the last to know even if he was party to such things. It did at least explain why Malfoy had been wearing Luna-style clothes the night before.
September last year.” Granger’s voice became strained and Draco could see how hard she was trying to keep it together.
Sometime later, when they’d finally managed to acquire a pensieve, Draco watched as Harry withdrew a memory from his temple.
The doors rotated two or three times, or at least, that’s as high as he managed to count before he got confused. “Well, what now?”
But he also knew that even if he had the energy, she wouldn’t want to hear it.
‘I can’t tell you that Draco. What I can tell you that there’s a man out there who loves you more than he loves life itself, and a little boy who thinks you’re his world, and if you love them too all you have to do is let them in.’ Draco thought of Harry. How he’d felt that morning after their little get-together after Teddy went to school. He should’ve known when he hadn’t jumped straight out of the bed and left and proceeded to cry himself to sleep in Harry’s arms, that his decision had already been made.
He pinched the bridge of his nose. ‘You’re right, I’m sorry. I’m just really wound up over this. I didn’t mean to snap at you. Thank you for telling me.’
‘Johnny wet the bed again,’ she whispered, ‘He went to see Matron.’ Matron was the orphanage’s onsite nurse. They’d tried their best to find a woman who would be motherly rather than the slightly brusque Madam Pomfrey. Johnny, a little boy whose parents had gone missing just a couple of years ago before the last of the Death Eaters had finally been found, was still having terrible nightmares despite only being three.
“You are so your father’s son, Harry.”
‘Draco?’ He asked. It was a stupid thing to ask, Harry knew it was Draco. Grimmauld Place was warded so tightly it was harder to get into than Fort Knox – Harry’d made sure of that when Draco’d had a death threat sent by owl in the week after they’d gone public with their relationship.
‘You’re dropping crumbs on me!’ Harry whined as Draco returned to his previous position.
'You did it, Draco. You really did it!' Harry's smile was blinding. He looked at Draco as though he were the centre of the universe. Draco shivered under its effects and the hope he'd kept quashed in the pit of his stomach bubbled up inside him. He knew he and Harry were thinking the same thing. This could be the beginning of the rest of their lives. He could tell, because Harry had never kissed him with such care and attention in all the years they’d been together.
‘I actually came straight here. Well, after an appointment with that sodding mind healer.’
“No, Potter. I’m sorry. I should have thought. Sometimes when I get stuck into something I get carried away. Of course you’ll be thinking about how you can help these people – it was insensitive of me.” The rapidity of his apology makes Harry wish he had seen more of Malfoy in the past few years. He seems a much more rounded person now.
‘I’ve told you not to stare at me when I’m sleeping,’ Harry said groggily, his hand running gently down the bumps of Draco’s spine. He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, and Draco found it oddly endearing that he was so relaxed around him. He often would wake up with a wand in his face in the early days – Harry had had less control over his nightmares back then.
‘They love having you around,’ she said instead. He sighed.
‘I didn’t mean to lie so much, honestly,’ Draco began. ‘I stopped seeing my healer when the potions stopped working and I was using the labs at work to develop my own anti-anxiety solution. I kept having to stay late because I couldn’t do it during office hours and I didn’t want you finding it in the house. I shouldn’t have lied, it was a terrible idea, but I never meant to make you feel like I didn’t love you because I do love you. Did love you.’ He corrected himself quickly, but it wasn’t quick enough.
“What time is it?” He asked instead. Lyra frowned and pulled the sleeve of her jumper back to look at her watch. It was silver but looked much fancier than the gold one Mr and Mrs Weasley had bought for Ron on his seventeenth birthday.
Today he sat cross legged on the slightly damp grass, closing his eyes and allowing his thoughts to wander to the earth beneath his feet. He could feel wisps of silver, thin like spider’s webs reaching out towards him. There was an instinct to run, as if he needed to catch something. The earth was solid beneath his feet, but he could sense the rumblings of life beneath the surface. A hunter, then. The wind blew through his…fur? And as he ran branches and thorns snagged on his tail. He was getting closer; he could feel it. Heart pounding heavily in his chest, he took a deep breath and brace himself for-
‘Yeah, well, I hear he’s very busy with his new girlfriend these days so that’s probably why. Interesting that he hasn’t brought her to meet you though.’ Draco knew he was shit stirring but really, would he be Draco Malfoy if he didn’t? Oh, wait…
He was so caught up in watching her, he didn’t know where she was in the letter when she paused. She tapped the pen twice against the page and then let go of it, reaching up to her hair. Harry watched with fascination as she scooped her curls up in her hands and seamlessly twisted them onto the top of her head, a few loose waves falling down at the side of her face. The whole action took mere seconds, it clearly being a familiar and practised movement, but it left Harry stunned.
‘Tired Harry.’ He said a few minutes later.
‘Are you feeling better now?’ She nodded and squirmed in his lap, hiding her face in his jumper.
What on earth could he give him that meant that much? It needn’t be something expensive, just something that mattered. He looked back at the photo-filled baubles currently displaying generic muggle stock photos and an idea struck him.
‘I’m not annoying.’ He crossed his arms with indignation.
“You mean, you haven’t thought about this already? Are you serious? You’re supposed to be doing all of this
Draco smirked. ‘You total barbarian. Imagine how you’d feel if I were talking about wine in French.’ Harry groaned and his head dropped to Draco’s shoulder which only made him throw his head back with laughter.
Harry had pulled a couple of strings at the Ministry so that they could take the portkey from their own home. He’d said it was because he knew how much Draco hated going to the Ministry unnecessarily, but Draco was fairly sure it was because Harry was worried about them being seen together. It didn’t help the knots in Draco’s stomach.
“Yeah, well, I did what I had to do.” Ron muttered into the cushion. Harry didn’t think it was a wise topic of conversation for the time being. It had only been a month since their big split, and with emotions so raw, neither of them seemed to know what to do without each other. Harry had mercifully been spared the agony of having to choose one friend over the other, but it wasn’t easy. When Hermione had found out Ron was staying with Harry it had very nearly been the end of their friendship, but thankfully there were some bonds that weren’t broken so easily. Even Hermione conceded that at the very least Ron couldn’t move back home to The Burrow where Molly was still crying at every small reminder of Fred.
‘Draco look at me. Don’t panic. You’re with me, you’re safe. They’re just people who want to look around the same as you and me, you don’t need to fear them.’ He knew he was just trying to help, but it didn’t matter. His heart was already in his throat and he could feel himself shutting down. He squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head, but it didn’t help.
‘Potter. You need to leave.’ Draco could feel his anxiety building and he was not about to have a breakdown in the middle of work.
“This door is as old as the land itself,” he told Granger to force his thoughts away from his father. “This land was gifted to my ancestor Armand Malfoy by William the Conqueror after the Norman Conquest. The door was carved from the trees that were felled to build the main house. It’s imbued with so much magic I’m not even sure how much of it is really wood anymore.”
“You. You were ill this morning too.” She didn’t pose it as a question, but he knew what she was asking. He was not ill really, or at least he didn’t think he was. Whatever happened in his dream has started something, and he wasn’t sure what was real and what was not. He sat up and turned to face her as if ready to engage in the uncomfortable topic of conversation but instead he changed the subject on her.
‘I really couldn’t say. A potion is more conventional, as pills are far more muggle and not as easy accepted among a lot of wizards. Having said that, private clinics often trial more experimental drugs and apothecaries have been trying to create pill style treatments for their longer shelf life.’
‘Why should I? This is
Draco couldn’t bear the thought of such a beautiful house, their home, being tainted by yet more grief. It had already seen a divorce, and Teddy leaving for Hogwarts, and Draco’s incident, and it was barely even five years old. Harry obviously didn’t think that whatever had gone on between him and Wood should warrant Draco leaving him, or he’d have tried much harder to make himself heard, wouldn’t he? Honestly with Harry, Draco didn’t even know anymore.
‘Bring us some tea please. And don’t let me hear you speak with such poor grammar again. I know you’re capable of better.’ He heard his father in every word.
‘Something to help me get better. At least, I think it will. I don’t really want to tell you about it yet, I need to keep it for myself. I thought you should know about it though because I’m going to spend some time in my old flat. For the space.’ Harry frowned.
“Did you just…?” She was frozen in position, her eyes wide and her mouth slightly open.
How much had Potter suffered that by the time they were at school he was such a target? The thought brought tears to Draco’s eyes.
Harry shot bolt upright in his bed. The sheets were damp with sweat and Aspen was sitting on his lap screaming at him. It was clearly still the middle of the night. His blood rushed in his ears and he gulped in air like he was oxygen starved. He reached for the fox and it curled into his arms like a small child. Luna had advised that under no circumstances should he let Aspen sleep in the bed with him, but on this occasion the pair of them went back to sleep together, Harry holding Aspen gently against his chest.
he’d made didn’t make him feel any better. He’d also never heard of mind spells before. Was that Smith trying to dumb down medical terminology for him? He’s not an idiot, he tried to get into healer training himself. Passed the exams with ease even.
‘I already have to-to take turns seeing you and seeing Dad and I haven’t seen you all week and-and when I go to school I’ll have to choose who to see at Christmas and-’ He babbled, almost running out of breath. It still hurt Draco hearing Teddy call Harry ‘dad’. He’d started doing it when he was five. Draco remembers how he couldn’t understand why Harry couldn’t be his dad when his first one wanted him to be. It was really simple logic, and no one quite knew how to argue with him so from then on, Harry became Dad.
‘Think you’re being funny, do you?’ He snarled. She shut up immediately.
, he mused wearily as he snuggled under a blanket he had lifted from the arm of the sofa,
‘Don’t be silly, Ted. You’re not defined by your house; just give it a go and you might surprise yourself.’ Draco watched words appear on the thick parchment in a chicken-scratch hand almost identical to Harry’s – it wasn’t difficult to figure out who it belonged to.
‘It really took that long?’ She nodded.
Despite how serious the situation was, Draco had to try very hard not to laugh at the way Pansy told her story. For some reason completely unfathomable to Draco, she refused to admit to any of her friends besides him that she was in a relationship with Granger. It had boggled Draco’s mind when she’d first told him, but she was also happier than she’d been in a long time. The most confusing part to Draco was that Granger could so easily forgive Pansy while still hating him. Although, if she really was going to help him, maybe she didn’t hate him as much as he thought…
He couldn’t move to Paris soon enough.
It was absolutely wrong. They’d only been getting along for one afternoon, and even then, it was begrudgingly on Malfoy’s side. But then he hadn’t been able to take his eyes off her all day, nor had he been able to when he’d seen her at that open mic. He’d blamed it on her singing then, but she wasn’t singing now.
‘A psychotic episode.’ He whispered. He bit his lip as it started to tremble, and he wished more than anything that the floor would swallow him whole.
‘Think about it though would you? He’s getting…incessant.’ Draco felt that in the pit of his stomach. He was doing this to Harry, he was making him suffer. He just didn’t see how going public now would help them. What if someone found out his mark was back? What if he was demonized all over again? He wasn’t sure he could handle it and he couldn’t face pushing Harry away again. Maybe he was already…
‘I can hear you thinking from all the way across the chateau.’ He jumped when Harry’s voice came from directly behind him. ‘Sorry, love. Didn’t mean to frighten you.’
For the first week and a half the fox was nocturnal, waking Harry up in the middle of the night as he hunted through the apartment. Thankfully, Aspen’s body clock began to adjust to domesticated living, and he eventually synced with Harry. Sort of.
‘I missed you too sweetheart.’
‘Christ. She doesn’t think you’re a horcrux, does she?’ He was back to looking worried again, just when Draco had been getting used to being carefree.
‘So… he wants to see you now? Why? Did something happen?’ Trust Teddy to ask a million questions before giving a second for an answer.
“Where are my manners? Let me take your robes.” Malfoy seems overly polite considering he has hated Harry for the better part of two decades, and Harry fails to stifle his laugh as he removes the outer layer he’s required to wear when he goes anywhere on official business.
‘You should leave it until he comes home,’ Draco said to him. Harry nodded but didn’t look away from the empty treetop. Draco slipped an arm around his waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. ‘You’ve done really well you know. You made it through his first term away.’
‘The visions you had during the separation of your magic have your healers believing it may be psychological damage stopping your magic from returning. I’m here to help you discover any underlying issues that might be causing this blockage.’ Smith kept a neutral expression whilst Draco rolled his eyes. He’d heard this a hundred times before and he didn’t believe a word of it.
Draco let go of Harry and braced himself as he walked out the back of the house where a large tent had been constructed. Percy Weasley had once told him that it was the tent they’d bought for Bill and Fleur’s wedding which was now used for family events since there was so many of them now. Draco could well imagine that their wedding had been a far cry from his and Harry’s, but from what he’d heard it had been beautiful up until it had been destroyed by Dolohov and his lackies. At least, Draco thought it was Dolohov – it had been so long he hardly remembered.
‘Well, it’s rather urgent actually, which is why I’m making this call myself. My auror department has been investigating a series of unfortunate cases of severed magical cores. We’ve had every specialist at St Mungo’s on the case, and no one can seem to figure out what’s causing it. I was wondering if we would be able to bring in your potions expertise to help solve the case.’ Draco was incredibly surprised.
Draco was walking through the streets of London arm in arm with his mother. He was taking her to Kew Gardens since she loved seeing the flowers and no longer had the Manor gardens to look at. Draco prided himself on caring for his mother now that his father was gone – he loved her dearly and knew how much she’d sacrificed for him to be here now. She looked better than she had in a long time, her dark hair swept in an elegant swirl and pinned with a dragonfly hairpin on the left side of her head. He’d adored that hairpin when he was younger. He could sit there and stare at it for hours. She was even smiling as she talked – he hadn’t seen her smile in a long time.
Draco eyed him suspiciously. ‘What have you been planning?’ Harry’s lips twitched upwards in an almost smirk and Draco’s stomach clenched in anticipation.
‘For the love of god Malfoy, why do you have to be so defensive all the time. I’ve left you alone, I’ve made an effort to make sure I give you space, I’ve never once got in the way of you spending time with Teddy.’
It was completely irrational, but Harry wanted the fox’s attention back. “What do you think of Aspen?” He asked him. They waited while he stood on the table and pondered Harry’s question. After a little while, he sat down and looked right at Harry, although he wasn’t sure what the fox wanted from him.
‘I know. You like this one though,’ Harry said with a smile. Draco huffed but that only made Harry’s smile grow. He offered Draco a hand and when he took it, he led him downstairs. It was a particularly frosty morning, there had even been snow forecast, and the chill had bitten its way through the warming charms, particularly against the glass panels in the living room. Harry waved a hand absently in their general direction and the draught stopped immediately. Draco pushed the surge of jealously away and focused on Harry instead. He’d been up and dressed before Draco, choosing to hang around the house in a long-sleeved shirt and joggers. Draco had thrown a fit the first time he’d seen him in a pair, calling them an abomination and an insult to fashion but now, now they were just Harry and of course, Draco owned a pair himself. Whenever Harry wore them Draco knew he was seeing the soft Harry who wasn’t a dangerous wizard, who let the kids use him as a human climbing frame and it made him relax just a little more.
‘I’m sorry.’ He leant over and kissed him gently.
‘I’m really sorry Teddy but you’re due back in Headmistress McGonagall’s office in half an hour so we need to head home.’ Harry interrupted them. Teddy looked up and nodded solemnly.
‘I feel like I’m missing something, like I’ve gone outside without any clothes on or forgotten my keys or something important. He’s my responsibility, I promised Remus and Tonks I’d look after him and he’s hundreds of miles away. What can I do from here?’ Harry’s voice wavered as he spoke, and Draco struggled to hold back his own tears. He felt the same most of the time, except he’d never said anything aloud because he could never tell if it was the feeling of his lost magic or missing Teddy.
‘Nothing…I just thought t-that you wouldn’t be h-here and I’d have to w-wait all day to see you but you’re here n-now and I really, really, m-missed you and-’
Potter twitched and Draco jumped. Forgetting his new agility, he flew much higher than he expected. Luckily, he had the appropriate reflexes and managed to land quietly. Having more than pushed his look for one night, he stalked over to the bed Potter had made and dragged it over to Potter with his teeth. He would have to move it back before either wizard woke the following morning, but for now this is where he would try to sleep.
Beneath the stark headline was a picture taken in Diagon Alley. Floating lanterns were lit along the cobbled street and hordes of people crowded in shop doorways and along the pavements, each holding a candle. There were small children on their parents’ shoulders delighted by the twinkling lights, unaware of their significance, and teenagers with tear-streaked faces. Potter’s face loomed above them, looking more regal and far more distinguished than he really was with his head tilted just so and perfectly groomed stubble. There were similar photos taken in the Great Hall at Hogwarts and at the stadium where the Harpies played, the largest quidditch stadium in England, full to bursting. It appeared the whole wizarding world was in mourning for a man Draco wasn’t sure was even dead. Certainly nothing official had made any hint of it.
‘Wait! There’s something I need to do first! Meet me in the snug.’ He got up off the chair and darted out of the room faster than Draco could question him. He was a little put out that he didn't get his kiss but he shrugged and cast a warming charm on the hot chocolates before levitating them so they followed him as he went downstairs.
Sirius huffed but put up no further argument and walked out of the kitchen to transform. Harry never tired of seeing his godfather become that shaggy black dog, and he briefly wondered why he had never tried to become an animagus himself, however there were more pressing matters.
‘Stay there.’ He said sternly and walked out of the room. Draco’s heart rate picked up and his fingers started twitching. He felt like an eleven-year-old boy in detention with Hagrid all over again.
‘Fire me if you want.’ Draco said, his voice shaking. ‘I’ve done more to solve this case than the rest of you morons put together. Fired or hired, get the hell out of my office.’ His breathing was becoming uneven and he was twitching with the effort of restraining himself. Harry needed to get the hell away from him in the next couple of minutes or it would all go to shit all over again.
“Anyway,” she pressed on. “One of the names mentioned in this experiment was a Brutus Malfoy. I think it’s safe to assume he’s one of yours?” She said
“Some people do,” Harry concedes, “but you can add your name separately, so lots of people choose something that matches what they want to post about. Maybe you can think of something bookish?” He suggests. Draco bites his lip and frowns in concentration as he thinks about this. His father always taught him that branding is everything, so it’s very important to get this right.
‘And you didn’t tell me, because?’ Draco asked him. Harry sighed and looked down at his hands, one of which was clasped in Draco’s. He played with Draco’s fingers and he would’ve been irritated at the obviously distracting tactic, but still couldn’t really feel it.
‘I can’t do both of those things, you’re going to have to pick one.’
‘Ok so low-down. You’ve been asleep for a week and a half, they’ve been doing all manner of tests on you every day, I look hideous under these hospital lights but I’m putting up with it because let’s be honest, no one can look worse than you do right now.’ Despite himself, he cracked a smile. He loved his school friends – anyone else would be fussing over him – but not Pansy.
No. That was ridiculous. They were way beyond that.
“Harry what-” she wasn’t quick enough to pull her arm away before he pushed her sleeve back and exposed the creamy white, silky skin of her inner arm. Without a dark mark.
Helen wasn’t in yet and Draco was silently grateful since it took a lot of energy to maintain civility around her. Especially when her default tone had become so overly professional with him. He’d just finished his last batch of scrambled eggs when a flash of dark curls appeared in the corner of his eye and made him grin.
‘Harry I-’
Harry turned back and set both mugs on the counter before motioning to the potion.
‘Afternoon to you too. Wait…are you smelling me?’
‘I’m fine!’ Teddy yelled back. That was enough for Draco, so he went straight to the kitchen to put the kettle on. With the kettle making an absolute racket, he didn’t hear the floo and didn’t notice when someone else entered the room.
Draco snapped that particular book closed before he was sick all over it. Although that might have been an improvement.
“Well…? You’re a wizard. Fix it!”
‘It’s important for him to see you well though. He spent the end of his holiday watching you out cold in a hospital bed. One time, Harry had to take him home because you did that weird, awake but no one’s home thing. Even if he hasn’t told you, he’ll be worrying about you up at Hogwarts.’ Draco hadn’t known that, he hadn’t even thought about it. For once, he thought the Weasel might be right.
’ The elf bowed so low his long, hooked nose touched the floor.
The view inside was beautiful, even if it didn’t quite match the ornate relief work on the outside. The one aspect that was better from the inside was the effect of the stained-glass windows.
He went with a classic white shirt, although he’d been sorely tempted by the icy blue one. He wasn’t feeling very pretentious and Harry was already wearing enough colour for them both. That purple shirt had been a good buy if he did say so himself.
‘Shhh. That one’s only for the grownups.’ He whispered in Draco’s hear as he took a seat on the sofa. Draco was unable to supress a shiver as he felt his hot breath against his skin.
It wasn’t that he couldn’t see things from Pansy’s perspective, because he could now, but if he didn’t help Granger do this she would only try and pull it off without him. As it happened, he was pretty useless in most aspects of the plan since he couldn’t leave the Manor grounds, although he had now perfected the spell that would allow him to do just that.
Draco started crying some time during Harry’s little speech, but by the end he was both laughing and crying and could only imagine how disgusting his face looked. A greater Slytherin than him would’ve left Harry kneeling there on the cold for even longer, just to memorise the terror in his eyes at the prospect Draco might say no. Draco had no intention of that though, he never wanted to go another day without Harry either.
to be annoyed at Ginny, she was more than entitled to get pregnant, but she didn’t have to quit the team permanently. Where was he supposed to get a chaser this short notice? He’d expected Ginny would be back from maternity leave by now. A considerate witch would have told him sooner.
‘Don’t,’ the first tears slipped from his eyes into the grimy sink below. ‘Don’t…tell me what’s wrong…I can help you…’ Myrtle came floating over. Myrtle, the only soul he’d ever been able to talk to. The most annoying ghost in the whole bloody school.
“Wait!” Draco has to switch the chairs over because he has to sit in his specific chair, but he also has to be on the left of Harry, or everything is just… wrong. Harry hasn’t noticed the chairs are the wrong way because to him they all look the same.
Getting caught up in the moment, Draco edged down onto the small gap between Potter and the edge of the cushion. His body was small enough for the fox to curl up right in front of his face, although he wasn’t sure he was quite that daring. He wanted to sit right there all night; finally able to get this close without fear of taking a hex to the chest or worse. Potter could be quite fierce when conscious, but asleep…
Communication via the coin was difficult. Each message could be a maximum of six short words written around the circumference of the coin face. Anything more than that made the letters too small to read. Granger seemed worried that excessive use would wear the magic out, or make it easier to detect, so she only communicated with him at irregular intervals. He allowed Pansy to stay at the Manor if she wanted, although it seemed she had gone to stay with Granger, and he couldn’t blame her for that. They’d both promised to go there every so often to keep the elves company and give them something to do, which was more than he had asked.
‘I never thought about doing that. I suppose I could try it.’ He admitted reluctantly. He hated to have to see things from Harry’s perspective. It wasn’t that he didn’t care how Harry felt, he just hated the amount of energy it took him to deal with all of the emotions it evoked. His potions got less and less effective the more he took them, and he was always scared if he doubled the dose he would have less time.
‘You’re not a cuddler and you never have been. Is everything ok?’ He didn’t really want to talk, he just wanted to enjoy being here with Harry, like this. The motion of Harry’s fingers on his back was soothing and they didn’t often take the time to stop and be.
‘Yes Master Draco?’
It was obvious when they reached the danger zone because the stillness of the air was obliterated. Even without his own magic, Draco could feel the waves of pure magic radiating through the corridors.
By eight in the evening he was well and truly done. He was practically falling asleep on Harry when Molly suggested they might want to think about heading home. They were among the first to leave, unsurprisingly, but Draco was happy that no one seemed to think the worst of him just because he had to leave early.
‘I sent him an owl after I was released, he seems a lot more settled this term than the last.’
‘Alright. But you promise you’ll floo call me if the slightest thing happens, and you won’t use any of the kitchen appliances?’ He really wasn’t sure about this, but Teddy was nodding furiously, and he supposed he would have to do it eventually. ‘Then I suppose I could. Only for an hour though. It’s a trial run.’
‘He has? Why haven’t you? You know there’s nothing you can’t tell me…’ Draco couldn’t look him in the eye. He just couldn’t.
Draco was tired by the time they reached the east wing. He was determined to find the self-same room he’d discovered on his first day here with the floor to ceiling windows.
‘You’re serious about it? Draco, when I said do something different I meant buy a new flat or get yourself out on a date, I didn’t mean run away.’ Pansy’s tone shifted to something a lot softer, which was so much worse than angry.
and something fluttered in Harry’s chest at that. There wasn’t time for him to respond because Sirius and Remus emerged from the doorway.
“You have no idea what this is like.” Draco hisses at him. Harry doesn’t like the tone at all, but Draco stops his pacing to come right up in Harry’s face. “You’re an only child. You have no concept of what it’s like to have your heart living outside of your body. Because that’s what it’s like you know, having a twin.”
‘You ran away to France to get away from me. Now you’re hanging around in your old flat to get away from me.’ Draco’s heart broke for him. He didn’t mean to make him think that.
‘Draco!’ She greeted him warmly as he entered her office. Unlike Kingsley, Hermione didn’t have a secretary yet, she’d been interviewing since she’d taken on her new role, but no one would never match the standards of the organisational queen that was Hermione Granger-Weasley. She rose to kiss his cheeks as always. ‘I wasn’t expecting you. You’ve not come to cancel our get-together, are you? I’m having a hellish day and I was really quite looking forward to it.’
Sirius and Remus burst into the room with a clatter. Harry’s vision wasn’t up to much by that point, even with his glasses on, but he could see that Sirius’s eyes were red-rimmed and raw. He was shocked, however, to see the fiery red mop of hair sticking out from behind Remus’s head. Ron pushed his way through between Harry’s godfather and his best friend and started babbling away.
‘You’re right. I’m sorry.’ Harry said as he relaxed a bit. That was when Draco realised he was treating Harry exactly as he had when they were married. Harry seemed to realise it too and he jerked his hand away from Draco. ‘I’m so sorry Draco. This isn’t your job anymore. I didn’t mean to make you feel like…I’m really sorry. I should get back to work.’ Harry jumped off Draco’s desk like he’d had a hot poker up the arse and all but ran out of Draco’s office.
Teddy’s face reappeared in the train window just at the train doors closed and Draco took in a shaky breath as his eyes welled up with tears. “A Malfoy never cries, and especially not in public.” His father’s voice echoed in his mind.
The healer passed the forms to Harry who signed them like a fan was asking for an autograph. Draco still couldn’t really feel his fingers, but he held the pen shakily and ignored the tingling pains down his arm long enough to sign his name in a wonky fashion above Harry’s.
‘No. Shut up.’ Harry’s chest rumbled underneath him as he chuckled.
‘He’s far more precious that a china doll, Potter, how dare you degrade our son like that.’ Harry shoved at one of Draco’s legs and it slipped off Harry’s lap, his ankle bone clanging on the edge of the seat painfully.
He tilted his head up and pressed a kiss just under Harry’s stubble covered jaw and didn’t complain at all when he felt the roughness under his lips. Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head and responded in a way that Draco wouldn’t forget for the rest of his life.
“Yeah, you’re right. You look like you could use a nap.” Sirius threw his head back and barked out a laugh, shoving Harry’s shoulder playfully. His entire faced changed when he laughed like that; he seemed younger, more alive, more like that teenager Harry had seen in Snape’s memories. He would have liked to have known Sirius back then, but he was immensely grateful he was getting to know him now.
‘Are you sure? It took ages to convince them I wasn’t some sort of evil mastermind and then it was all so messy when we split. It was crazy enough they all forgave me for everything I said about them…’
His heart began to settle into a steadier rhythm as he took another measured lungful of chilly air. It seemed that as he calmed down a throbbing sensation began in his temples and his ears started to ring. It was a long time since he’d been somewhere as loud as that pub. Ron hadn’t followed him outside; he’d maintained that ability to read Harry better than anyone, even Hermione, and Harry supposed Ron wouldn’t mind if he went home. Part of him thought it would be awful to abandon Ron with Malfoy of all people. Then again, Malfoy probably didn’t want to go near Ron any more than Ron wanted to go near Malfoy.
‘Draco, stop it. How many times do I have to tell you? You don’t have bloody wrinkles. You’re beautiful, ok?’ Draco’s fingertips froze where they were, and he gaped at Harry. He felt his cheeks flame like an awkward teenager being complimented for the first time. When was the last time someone had said something like that to him? He couldn’t even remember.
be on his cards, Draco was using his time to really appreciate the manor’s gardens. Of course, there were conditions for release set on him already, so the prospect of going to Azkaban wasn’t terribly new. However, being in that cell was the longest Draco had actually ever been contained, and he was realising anew that Azkaban was no laughing matter.
The memory ended, and the present Draco found himself on the floor of his dingy little flat.  In the end, Draco had taken the floo to Luna’s where he’d cried himself to sleep. When he’d tried to return the next day, Harry had blocked the floo. Weeks of unanswered owls had told Draco all he needed to know. In the end, Hermione had gone to the house to collect Draco’s things. A few weeks after that, divorce papers landed on Luna’s kitchen table and Draco wondered where in the world his marriage had gone.
‘I vote we eat first and talk later,’ Harry suggested. Draco nodded in agreement. He needed a few minutes to calm down and Teddy didn’t need to be barraged with information the moment he’d stepped through the door. He’d just been at Hogwarts for the first time.
Draco wasn’t solely interested in his new estate however. Some days he really didn’t feel like straining his eyes of oil canvases or dealing with yet another boggart in the closet. He also spent time in the flat he was renting, trying out new potions. He decided, despite his growing love for restoration, that if he were ever to get an apothecary up and running, it would specialise solely in mental health. Draco didn’t believe that mental health problems should be dealt with only with pills and potions, he firmly believed in the benefits of a strong support network, mind healers and even simple things like trying to smile and have a positive mental attitude. Because of this, some of his potions had no medicinal properties whatsoever. Some were muscle relaxants or sleep aides, some were herbal concoctions to induce calm or aid sleep. His knowledge of herbology grew in leaps and bounds, not that he hadn’t had an acceptable amount of knowledge to begin with, and it had even led to the occasional exchange of owls with Neville Longbottom, who fully supported Draco’s venture into mental healthcare after his own experiences in the war.
‘Merry Christmas to you too,’ he muttered under his breath.
Tuesday 19
“Oh for heaven’s sake!” Pansy burst out. “You Gryffindors always make things so difficult! Tell him the rest, would you? Before he implodes.” Pansy fidgeted in her seat and Draco’s stomach sunk to the floor. She has that familiar maniacal look in her eyes that told him there was a terrible plan afoot.
Making puff pastry was a lot harder than he thought it was going to be.
“I see. Well, things must be bad if you’re coming to someone like me for help. I bet it took you at least a day just to stop retching at the mere thought of coming here. I’m so sorry to disappoint.” Malfoy’s words are venom. Surely Harry hadn’t gotten it so wrong when he thought to come here. Surely Malfoy wouldn’t turn him away.
Friday 28
‘Tell me where you went on Boxing Day.’ Draco had forgotten all about it in the madness which had ensued.
“Listen, Lyra…” He was searching for the right words when Aspen finally stopped staring at him immobile. The fox screeched and pounced, flying two feet up in the air before slamming his front paws directly into Harry’s groin. Harry saw white.
Once they’d stepped back out into the street Draco realised it was already getting dark. It made navigating the crowds much harder with the ever-dimming light. Draco was frustrated by his inability to shrink his purchase and keep it save from being jostled and he had to make do with putting it in one of the muggle bags they’d picked up earlier. His heart was racing as he stepped into the throng of people and he was breathing deeply to keep himself together.
“Yes, I am aware of the contents of my own library.”
The fox faced the dog and bared his teeth. It was the first time Harry had truly seen Aspen behave like a wild animal and it was rather a shock. It had been easy to see him only as a pet in the few weeks he had been in Harry’s care. They shared a bond now that meant they trusted each other, but Harry could see that Aspen would not accept a dog just because Harry did.
“What don’t I understand?” Malfoy leant forward, folding his arms on the table, his face softening into an expression that was almost pleasant... for Malfoy. Harry didn’t say anything. For all that Malfoy had gone through during the war, and Harry wouldn’t be the one to deny everyone had lost something, he had no comprehension of how Harry felt to have been so close to having a real family only for it to be ripped away again.
‘I don’t think that’s the full truth.’ Draco felt like Smith was staring right into his mind and he shifted uncomfortably.
‘I know.’ Draco croaked hoarsely.
‘You guys go have fun. I’m kind of tired anyway.’ Harry hadn’t seemed to understand the implications of what Hermione had told him yesterday, although Draco knew, and it was making him sick with worry.
Harry didn’t reappear throughout Ella’s haircut which was a shame, since he would’ve loved to see her face when Daphne gave her a glass of orange juice in a real wine glass. His heart could’ve burst with how sweet she was, yet Harry’s words were lingering in the back of his mind. It wasn’t fair that he was doing this for her and not for the others. They were all as special as she was in their own way – it was simply coincidence that she happened to have bonded with him.
When he got home that night, he decided that’s exactly what he would do.
As he was dragged from the room, his head began to spin. He was hit with flashes of the first time he had been arrested, albeit in a less calm fashion than Ponytail and Knock-Off Vince. Back then the Aurors had stormed into the Great Hall where Draco and his parents had been sitting, bewildered and largely ignored, and demanded they be brought to the Ministry that instant. He saw flashes of dusty emerald green robes as Professor McGonagall had tried to reason with them. Most of the words were lost to him now, but he remembered, as the lack of bloody supply to his fingers turned them slowly numb, that she had tried to plead his case as a minor. Perhaps he had never appreciated the Gryffindor Head of House nearly enough; she may have been strict, but she was fiercely protective of all her students.
‘Nevermind.’ Teddy said sleepily as he helped Draco get him into his pyjamas. ‘I’m glad you came. Dad said you weren’t coming.’ He said as he slid under the covers. Draco frowned.
“What?” His face was mere inches from hers and it was impossible not to see how perfectly her face matched the man in his dream; everything fit feature for feature. But those eyes. He’d seen those eyes somewhere else too. Somewhere long before he’d had that dream, but he didn’t know where.
Once he’d placed the drinks down at the table, his brain registered what his ears had been hearing. Malfoy was covering a song Harry had heard over and over on the radio but was surprised that Malfoy knew it since it was written by a muggle band.
“Whether Harry goes alone or not, we all need to sleep before we can make any decisions. What you’ve said has given us all food for thought, Harry, I’m sure we could all use some time to mull it over.” Something about Remus’ tone didn’t sit well with Harry, but he knew he was right. Harry was exhausted and he’d been out cold for hours, never mind the others who hadn’t slept at all.
“Well you can’t exactly keep calling him ‘it’ can you?” Malfoy appeared behind him, presumably intrigued by the screeching, and Harry was sure he was about to faint. He had never looked at Malfoy twice during school, but now that they were free of the constraints of Hogwarts houses, she seemed like she was more…her. There was less of that chauvinistic air to her and more calmness. The same confidence, but more of the right kind than the misguided kind.
“I thought- it’s hard to tell with you.” He forced himself to look away from her as he swayed on his feet once more. It wasn’t doing him any good to be this close, and yet he couldn’t help it.
‘I had no idea you were so serious about it.’ He could feel the intensity of Harry’s gaze and in the reflection of them in the shop window he saw a look of pride he’d never seen before. ‘Is that why you were spending so much time brewing?’ Draco stared at their reflections as he cast his mind back to the last fight they’d had before the divorce, when Harry had accused Draco of spending too much time in his lab and not with the family. He’d ended up accusing Harry of the same thing with the orphanage.
He was just about to cry with frustration when a tapping on the window caught his attention. He strode over to where Eltanin was excitedly scratching at the glass. Draco let him in and Eltanin swooped around the room before landing on Draco’s shoulder. He pulled two letters from his leg – one addressed to Harry and one addressed to himself. He smirked in amusement. They hadn’t told Teddy about Draco’s moving back in, since there would be an awful lot of information to tell him via owl and they didn’t want to distract from his studies.
“Don’t you remember how much paperwork we had to fill out to allow me to move in? They only let Granger pass because they thought there was no way in hell she’d ever go against them. She’s still one of the golden ones.” Draco wasn’t quite so sure about that anymore; he was starting to see just how determined Granger was.
‘Everything’s fine. I just take time to process.’ Harry nodded but he didn’t look like he believed him.
‘He should probably go to bed now, Harry.’ Luna said in passing. She was walking around the garden and picking up the odd discarded cup.
‘Ugh. You never told me Gryffindor was contagious.’ Harry bumped his shoulder as he laughed.
‘But what does that have to do with Draco’s magic?’ Harry looked as confused as Draco felt.
“Yeah, why?” He frowned.
‘He really put a lot of effort into this. I’ve never seen him plan like this before, you know how he feels about birthdays and parties.’ Draco was surprised. Harry hated celebrating his birthday, he hated big groups of people and more than anything else, he hated unnecessary attention.
Draco sniffled. ‘Merry Christmas Harry.’
It seemed Harry could feel Draco’s hand skimming lightly through his hair because he unconsciously pulled Draco closer and nuzzled his face into Draco’s neck just like he had when they were married. Draco’s heart was ready to explode with need and want, but then the spell was broken.
He could hear Harry mumbled in the background and he decided to interrupt Daphne and Ella – he wasn’t about to keep sitting there on his own like a lemon.
He wanted to give Harry something sentimental. That was the only way. They didn’t need
“You really thought this through.” It wasn’t framed as a question, but Granger nodded anyway. He had to admit, she had prepared for a lot more eventualities than he had, although perhaps she didn’t view herself as so disposable.
‘Not now Teddy. Go back upstairs.’ Draco couldn’t look at him, his eyes were trained on Harry, watching his every move. He didn’t react to Teddy’s presence at all.
He was busy contemplating the abstract art on the wall – he couldn’t decide if it represented a pile of shit or a pile of rocks when the stupid phone snapped shut. Harry came storming over and Draco almost cowered until he remembered it was Harry and Draco hadn’t done a thing.
which said physical exercise was good for mental health issues. He’d also been testing out his circulation potion against the new weather conditions. A tingling in his palms and a slight pain in his right wrist told him the formula wasn’t quite right yet.
‘Well, you know how everything felt to you, but maybe you could pick a time when you felt uncomfortable or upset and try to think about how Harry might have felt about it.’ She suggested. He could feel her watching him intently, even though his eyes were trained on his plate.
‘Better.’ He assured him. Harry’s shoulders visibly dropped, and Draco felt a selfish degree of warmth that Harry still worried about him.
after all.
‘Anyway, as much as I would love to lounge around with you, we really should head to the orphanage. Susan floo called a few minutes ago and said Ella finally slept because she tired herself out, but she’s been throwing a fit since six and still won’t cooperate.’ She was one five-year-old against a team of trained adults, surely she couldn’t overpower all of them.
Harry watched her approach the fox. He seemed wary of her but didn’t try to run as he had before. He was hesitant, but Malfoy was patient. She held her hand out in front of him and waited. Patience is a virtue and so she was rewarded; he sniffed at her hand like a dog and seemed to approve of her, although he whined as if trying to actually speak to her.
thing. You think you’re so much better than me just because you got that stupid scar and have the whole world fawning all over you!’
He leaves some of the rustic wood surface in view in the gaps between the books and he intersperses some of the white hydrangea he has in a vase nearby. It takes a few minutes of adjusting the position of the books exactly how he likes them before he’s prepared to take the camera anywhere near them. Once he’s happy, quickly he snaps a few photos from different angles, plays with the brightness and the saturation just a bit because the light isn’t brilliant.
They were all smiles when they arrived at the orphanage of course.
“I’m sorry, ok? I was more concerned for your wellbeing than knowing what junk you’ve got.” The fox opened its mouth wide, exposing its sharp white teeth, and whined. Harry was confused for a second until he realised it was laughing at him.
“Are you feeling ok?” He asked her with a half laugh, though he couldn’t see her because he kept his eyes closed.
An hour and a half went by and they found nothing. They barely spoke other than to qualify certain words for each other in some of the Latin passages. Quite a few of them were written in Early Modern English but predominantly they were Latin. Pansy had another tray of tea sent up for them, probably hoping it would speed them up. Not long after that the light started to fade, and Draco lit the lamps in the room so they could keep reading. He was about to give up when suddenly Granger made a triumphant
She wandered back over to Draco and planted a wet kiss on his cheek and wandered out of the room. Not before sticking her tongue out behind Harry’s back.
So, it was Draco who began the explanation. He told Pansy of their plan to go into the heart of the Department of Mysteries, where once Granger had been in search of the prophecy his father tried to obtain, to the Veil. First thing tomorrow morning, Granger would go to the Ministry and retrieve Potter’s wand from the evidence lockers, on which part of the spell they had found would be cast.
‘Sorry. I’m so sorry. Shit.’ Harry raked a hand through his already messy hair and it stuck up even more. ‘There’s more though, isn’t there?’ He said eventually. Draco nodded.
When she spoke next her tone was flat and cold. “Don’t say that to be polite, Potter. I don’t need validation from you.”
‘Alright mate? Sorry, Mr Grinch.’ The Weasel nodded in acknowledgement. His jumper was even worse – two gingerbread people in fighting poses called “ginjas”. Where did they get such crimes against fashion?
‘It’s a big change, it’ll take a while to get used to. He’s off having fun and making friends. Surely you remember our first year, there was barely a moment to think.’ He tried his best to avoid the fact that Harry hadn’t had any family back home missing him the way Draco’s mother had. ‘He’ll be coming back soon, and he’ll be all over you like a rash,’ Draco told him. He gave him the most convincing smile he could muster but he wasn’t sure Harry believed him.
“I know. I- I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t understand.”
Harry is quick to put a gentle hand on Draco’s arm. “No, no, you go ahead. I like it.” He types it into the box-thing without a space in the middle. It looks weird to Draco to have the two words mashed together like that, but when he says so Harry explains that the usernames can’t have spaces in them. Draco supposes he’ll just have to put up with it.
‘You’re right. I’m being unfair.’ He wasn’t, Draco was. ‘I promise you it’s not what you think. I’ll admit I slept with him and that wasn’t fair on you and it wasn’t right for me to keep it from you either. I just knew how it would look and I’d only just got you back and hell, listen how much of an arse it makes me sound. It was a stupid mistake. I went to a bar. It was one of the first nights you’d been stable enough for me to leave you for a bit. God, that makes you sound like such a child. That’s not how I meant it.’ Harry released Draco’s hands to scrub at his own face with frustration. Draco pulled his hands away before he could do any damage.
“No, please,” he begged her, “anywhere else but here.” When they had been up there before the floo flared, Harry hadn’t taken much notice of the room besides that tapestry, but now he saw that there were random items of furniture hidden beneath dust covers.
‘Look who decided to show up!’ He said as he detached Johnny and hoisted him into his arms. The poor thing still had red raw eyes, obviously from the tears his nightmares had caused, and Draco felt terrible that he couldn’t help.
Pansy pinned him with a look that seemed to say
He pulled the wand from his pocket. He’d started carrying it since Harry had made him realise that by casting it aside, he was too close to accepting he couldn’t fix what had been done. It felt warm in his hands again, like his magic was reconnecting. His heart thumped louder as a glimmer of hope sparked inside him. He looked up at Harry who was smiling at him encouragingly.
Carefully and meticulously cultivated by his mother, the gardens had been falling into disrepair in the past couple of years – there was no time to prune and weed when the house was infested with Death Eaters. Although Draco was no horticulturalist, he was doing his best to stop the borders and the rose garden running rampant. Spring was just getting its act together and the temperature had risen enough that he could spend a few hours outdoors without freezing his arse off.
The man in his dream looked just like Lyra. Same hair colour, same eye colour, same cupid’s bow lip, same pointed chin and sharp jaw. Harry’s head spun as pictures flickered across his vision. Standing in Madam Malkin’s on a platform with a snobby little boy blabbering away about Hogwarts houses while Madam Malkin was poking him with pins. Him following the same boy, now almost a man, all the way to the girls’ bathroom where he found him crying, minutes later blood pouring all over the floor and Harry’s stomach lurching in fear and guilt. The man looking him in the eye as similar looking people, presumably his parents, watched on with anxious looks on their faces: “I can’t- I can’t be sure”.
‘Of course.’ She opened the door further and as he stepped into the room he gasped in shock. The whole bedroom was destroyed. The curtains were torn and ripped from the railings, the feathers from the pillows were scattered across the floor, the bedside table was laying on its side, chipped to hell. He’d forgotten the power of accidental magic.
And that is how Draco found himself in a muggle nightclub on a Thursday night.
The snug was much warmer than the outside air, much to Draco’s relief. He cast a quick incendio at the wood fire and it roared to life. He swaddled himself in one of his many blankets and curled up on the sofa. He watched the fire crackle and spit for a few minutes before turning his attention to the climbing plants. They were starting to die off again – he really needed to stop coming when the gardens weren’t in full bloom. He’d finished half of his hot chocolate by the time Harry returned looking flushed and downright terrified.
, Pansy. How
‘Teddy we should get going.’ Draco interrupted. Wood turned to him looking irritated.
“But he waited for you, didn’t he? What happened?”
“It’s you. And you’re a Slytherin. So yes.” Harry adored it when he got to see the affectionate side of Draco, but he also knew that it didn’t make an appearance without a reason.
‘Good afternoon Mr Malfoy, I do apologise for interrupting your afternoon.’ Kingsley had been one of the few people to support Draco and Harry’s relationship when the first came out and Draco would be eternally grateful.
“Malfoy, are you worried about me?”
. He battled with the fresh tears threatening to leek from his eyes, the traitorous bastards. He wondered for the umpteenth time how he’d ended up here. He missed his mother. Without Harry he had nowhere to turn. Hermione had her own family to care for, he couldn’t burden her with this. Pansy – well, he hadn’t heard from her since she and Harry had told him she was back. Maybe he should’ve checked in on her, made sure she’d been settling ok. Who even knew where across the globe Blaise was anymore, and now apparently his situation with Harry was as rocky as he’d suspected. He needed his mother. He needed someone, anyone who was just for him. Was that selfish? He was finally starting to understand what people meant when they said that one could be in a room full of people and still feel alone.
‘It’s hideous!’ Draco whined as he adjusted his jumper. Molly made a rule after the war that Christmas was a day of silliness. Draco had only spent Christmas with the Weasleys after he and Harry were married, but Harry had told him how difficult that first Christmas without Fred had been. As such, they all had to wear amusing Christmas jumpers to lunch and Draco and Harry always bought theirs for each other. This year, Draco had bought Harry one with bells on it that said, “jingle my bells” and Harry had gotten Draco the worst jumper he’d ever owned.
“I see.” Her face shuttered just as he expected. His refusal sat heavy between them and even though he desperately wanted to reach out and kiss her again, he knew it wouldn’t be appreciated.
‘What was her name? Hilary? Teddy hates her by the way.’ Draco knew he was being petty, but he couldn’t help himself.
“WELL WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME THIS SOONER YOU UTTER BUFFOON. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO RAVE ABOUT MARGARET ATWOOD WITH YOU?!”
“It’ll just be for tonight. It’s late, you’ve been drinking, and I’m really tired. It’d be better to deal with it when we’ve slept.” Even as he said it he was thinking it was probably just a dream or a hallucination induced by a long and difficult week. As soon as he let go of the silver fox it skittered across the room and into the corner where it bared its teeth at them. Ron finally took some initiative and filled a bowl of water while Harry retrieved a sofa cushion to transfigure into a bed. He wasn’t sure the fox would sleep in it but even if it didn’t, he'd at least feel like he tried.
He ran to the hallway where they always apparate to, but there was no one there. They’d made a pact after first moving in together that they’d always apparate to the hallway because they’d both been jumpy after the war, and they’d occasionally given each other a nasty shock by popping out of thin air with no warning. Draco hadn’t complained that time Harry had apparated directly into the bathroom, desperate to pee, and found Draco in the shower having a bit too much fun. Ignoring the surge of interest that came with that particular memory, Harry went to the kitchen. He thought maybe that would be the next place Draco might apparate to. There was no one there either, even Kreacher appeared to have gone to bed.
It didn’t feel natural for them to sit side by side like that, so Harry got up and wandered to the base of the willow tree, gesturing for Draco to follow.
‘Right, right, sorry. I have a meeting today that should sort it all out anyway. If not, well, we’ll figure something out. Besides, I have far more interesting things to do right now…’ He got up from his desk chair and grabbed Draco’s hand, pulling him back to their bedroom. It was weird how easily Draco had reverted to calling it that, when he’d spent the first month here in the guest bedroom.
“You probably wouldn’t believe me if I told you that was my Aunt Bella when she was a girl. It’s a Dutch commission, one of my favourites actually.” Harry jumps when Malfoy’s voice is much closer than he expected. There are many questions he wants to ask. Was she really once an innocent girl like the one in this picture? Or was it a great effort to have her sit for her portrait? Is it Malfoy’s favourite because it’s of his aunt? Or does he like it for the use of light and colour that drew Harry’s attention?
“Oh, I see. So, because my father used blackmail and bribery, you think it’s ok to show up here and demand access to my family’s old, and fragile I might add, library whenever it pleases you? And what? You’ll lock me up if I say no? Obstructing the course of justice, I dare say!” Harry has no idea where this is coming from and it upset him to see Malfoy looking like a deer caught in the headlights.
‘Take some time to think about it. I don’t want you to feel rushed into anything. There’s so much else we have to deal with.’ This was one of the things he loved and hated about Harry. Everything was always
‘I’m happy to see you too!’ And he hugged Draco again.
‘Look Daddy! Asphodel!’ Teddy ran over to a group of lilies and started examining them carefully. He got a few strange looks from people whom Draco presumed were muggles, since they didn’t appear to be accustomed to eleven year olds knowing the appropriate name for the flowers. ‘You can use these in Wiggenweld and Draught of the Living Death! But I’m not old enough to learn those yet…’ He was babbling away excitedly, and Draco felt a rush of pride that he seemed to have developed such a passion so early. He wouldn’t put pressure on him of course, but if he put as much work in as he did enthusiasm, he could go far.
He routed around in the storage cupboard for an old potion he’d made a long time ago. He’d always kept a supply of all manner of potions, sometimes just to practice brewing them and other times so that he could isolate certain elements when he was experimenting. Eventually he found what he was looking for and he raced back into the kitchen where Harry was sitting with a deep frown on his face. Draco set the two potions down on the table in front of him.
“I was out a long time then,” his heart thudded dully in his chest as his brain started to wake up properly. Had he ruined Sirius’ and Remus’ reunion? Where was Ron? Why had seeing the tapestry made him feel so ill in the first place? The tapestry! As if seeing his thoughts beginning to spiral, Lyra cut off his stream of consciousness.
‘Are you stupid? He is my relationship. What the fuck?’ He stood up. He was not about to give this fool another minute of his time.
. How tacky. He glanced down at the front page spread below where Harry and Oliver Wood had been photographed at a quidditch match. There didn’t seem to be anything untoward about it – they were old quidditch teammates, it was perfectly logical they might go to a match together, although Draco didn’t know they were still in contact.
‘You’re going to go with Harry now, ok? I’ll see you again in a bit.’ Johnny frowned at him, scrubbing his head and messing his dark hair up.
“We should talk about this.” Lyra said. He looked at her properly for the first time in the glow of the solitary lamp and he could see her face creased with concern. His stomach swooped as she pinned him with that same piercing look that she’d had at the open mic night.
‘No, sir. Sorry sir.’ Draco nodded.
‘Please, don’t say anything else. I haven’t had time to prepare this at all and if you interrupt me, I think I might be sick. I want to prove to you I won’t leave again, if you’ll let me.’ Draco was about ready to start screaming at him for answers when he pulled a box from his pocket and dropped to one knee. His heart really did stop for just a second.
A few days later Draco found himself at Hermione’s, holding a very sleepy Hugo whilst Harry sat on the floor tickling a squealing Rose.
‘I like it when you speak French.’ Draco wasn’t so sure he was supposed to hear that, but he did.
Draco grinned at Teddy’s ability to flit from subject to subject so quickly. He remembered when he tried to write his first letters to his father, all of which he refused to respond to until he thought the style sufficiently succinct. Draco would never be like that with Teddy. He wrote a quick response, assuring Teddy that Hufflepuff was a perfect fit for him and that he was very proud of how well he was settling in. He let Eltanin rest for a while since he knew the new owl didn’t have much experience with such long-distance flights.
‘Maybe. His heart is all you though.’ He shook his head and forced himself to move, going to his bedside table to take out his journal. He looked around for his reading glasses and eventually found them under his pillow. He didn’t remember leaving them there.
‘The Ministry doesn’t just move people’s offices, Hermione. I’m not stupid enough to believe they’re that organised. What haven’t you told me?’ Hermione had the gall to look sheepish, which Draco appreciated. She levitated some boxes off the chairs so they could sit down.
‘Because we’re family, Harry! That’s what families do!’
Draco glared at Harry even though it wasn’t really his fault. Harry said nothing but smirked at him arrogantly, the bastard.
ancient magical artefacts, were they? Oh right, you’ve been Mister Hot-Shot Head Auror for so long you probably don’t remember such
‘For Christ’s sake Draco, I wouldn’t even be here without you. When did you become so bloody Gryffindor?’ He couldn’t say anything to that. It was highly insulting after all. Gryffindor his arse.
‘I’ll tell you about it when we get home.’ Harry said.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I tried.” Sirius said to him a few minutes later when he had returned to human form. Harry had successfully calmed Aspen down and was holding him lightly in his lap.
They walked together to Grimmauld Place on autopilot. It assuaged a little of Harry’s guilt knowing that it couldn’t have been too long since he last saw Sirius if he still knew the way like the back of his hand.
Happy New Year everyone! This will be my last update of 2018 although for many the new year has already started.
‘He’s a bit intense isn’t he.’ Harry jumped and clutched his chest.
‘I did tell him that. I told you that too. Hell, I think I told everyone that.’ Draco wasn’t angry, not anymore. He knew his friends just wanted what they thought was best for him. At the end of the day, the only one who really knew him was himself.
“Maybe. But I think it can wait.”
Teddy was oblivious of course as he ripped off the red and white paper with gusto. He lifted the lid of the box underneath and sat perfectly still. He blinked down at the contents and Draco was filled with trepidation as he watched him. Harry slipped a hand into his and squeezed it for reassurance.
‘Shit. But marginally less shit than last time.’ He said bluntly. His voice still sounded off, but not quite as bad as it had last time.
“He calls him Snuffles?” Lyra giggled. It was one of the sweetest sounds Harry had ever heard.
‘Ted?’ Draco scanned the surrounding area and was relieved when Teddy’s head popped up from behind a set of three-foot penguins. Honestly, who would buy that crap?
“I suppose I might like that.” Malfoy’s surprised smile is like nothing Harry has ever seen.
‘Bloody hell Malfoy, no need to be so enthusiastic about it.’
‘Oh for heaven’s sake Pots, you know he hates surprises. Stop tormenting the poor bugger.’ Draco’s head snapped towards the far corner of the living room where Pansy was perched against one of the side tables. He’d been so busy staring at Harry he hadn’t even noticed her.
He kissed Pansy on both cheeks as they parted ways, with promises of coming back here once he’d made the place structurally sound again so she could begin her designing. He thought she could use something to occupy her spare time. She was of course highly busy with whatever it was she was doing in Dubai of course, but reading between the lines Draco was sure much of what she told him what somewhat embellished. Twice now she’d taken last minute trips to visit him. The Pansy of five years ago would never have had the time to drop everything with no notice at all. He wasn’t oblivious. Still, she was ever the proud Slytherin.
‘Bitch please, one puppy-eyed look Potter’s way and he was leading me straight to you.’ She said with a smirk.
It was confusing for Draco, part of him wanted to relax into the idea Harry would come swooping in like a knight in shining armour – he had done that after all. Another part of him wanted to push it away, tell him he didn’t need to be protected. Maybe he did now.
Draco looked sideways at Granger who shook her head as if trying to wake herself up. “Okay… go for it,” she said warily.
His name isn’t even Harold.
‘None taken Weasel. If your wife wasn’t such a genius I wouldn’t come near this hovel.’ He enjoyed the bickering. There was no real heat in it now, their hatchets were long since buried, but it felt…normal.
“Malfoy said he’s not from these parts. Where is he from?” Harry asked Luna. She positively lit up like Hermione did whenever she was asked about something she’d read about.
‘Jacob sounds like a good friend,’ Draco agreed. He didn’t want to push too soon, Teddy had just come home after all, emotions were running high. He knew this would be a conversation they’d have to have – and before Christmas at that.
“It used to,” Sirius admitted, “but now I think it’s for the best. The era of my family and it’s ignorant values is over, maybe it’s best they go with it.” There was that same look on his face that there was when Harry had mentioned Remus to him; a kind of wistfulness tinged with sorrow. Harry didn’t like to see him that way. The image of the man in the arch who looked just like Lyra surfaced again and his stomach swooped.
‘No, Granger. He somehow neglected to mention that in his terrible excuse for a note. How he made it through Hogwarts with that chicken scratch for handwriting, I’ll never know.’ Hermione’s smirk made Draco want to send her a nasty stinging hex, but he refrained. There were children present.
‘Sometimes I think nothing pleases her. Pay no mind. Did you hear she’s dating someone? If she’s still worrying about you and me when she’s dating someone else, then it’s her own fault.’ Draco nodded in agreement and hoped Harry could feel it.
‘He what?’ He swivelled round on his chair to find Pansy propped up against the metal table behind him, staring at him intently.
Malfoy turned to Harry abruptly. “I think you should call him Aspen.”
‘The same as always,’ he said quietly. Harry sighed. He sat down on the floor next to Draco and pulled him into a one-armed hug that Draco really didn’t want. He didn’t want sympathy, he wanted to not have to think about it for even an hour. It seemed like everything reminded him of what had happened. There wasn’t a single aspect of his life unaffected by his lack of magic.
when staying well away from him would keep my name out of this?” He was getting agitated. “Besides, I didn’t ask to see him,
‘He’s not off having fun and making friends.’ Harry muttered quietly, and Draco wasn’t quite sure he’d heard him correctly.
‘I’ll leave you two to catch up.’ She said, shooting Harry a pointed look. She left without picking her robes back up from the back of the chair, so Draco assumed that it wasn’t the last he’d be seeing of her.
It was a shame the winter hadn’t quite left Paris yet, as the park on their right was still a little dull and dead. Still, Draco remembered how beautiful it had been in the autumn when he’d first visited and the trees and been all manner of orange hues.
‘I was worried,’ Teddy said quietly. Harry took the glasses, now filled with water, from Teddy’s hands and put them on the table. Then he went to fill the third. Teddy didn’t move from where he stood by the sink, he just stood there watching.
‘I’m sorry I always call you Draco. I thought you might not want me to call you anything else because you’re always so proper. You are my dad though, just like Harry is my dad.’ Draco wouldn’t have told Teddy that he’d called him Daddy at least twice already even if he could. As it happened, his throat was too tight, and his eyes were too hot with tears to say more than a few words.
‘You can say no to this if you want to. I don’t want you to feel like I’m putting pressure on you, but I’ve been keeping these in here for a week now and I’m sick of thinking about it.’ He pushed the stack of papers across the desk towards Draco who could just make out the title page without his reading glasses. Honestly, Harry could’ve warned him he’d be reading, then wouldn’t have taken his glasses off.
“I heard some of the fifth years were planning on throwing a first year into the lake before dinner to battle with the giant squid. Wouldn’t want to miss that, would you?” He smirked and wandered off. Harry almost laughed. Draco had developed this mildly amusing and weird way of inviting Harry places without openly doing so by pretending to taunt him.
‘What time is it?’ He’d forgotten his watch again this morning. He’d started forgetting his watch a lot lately, he wasn’t really sure why.
‘I would’ve helped you fix it, you know. I understand how important it was to you that the house was made by hand.’
He couldn’t stop thinking about Ella either. He didn’t want to be going to the orphanage too much. He knew his relationship with her was already causing issues, but he couldn’t help but worry. It felt no different to the way he worried about Teddy though, particularly since Teddy had gone to school and he would worry about inane things like did he eat his vegetables today? Can he find matching socks? Are his friends including him? It was the same with Ella – although she was much younger, so it was a little different.
‘I like that some of them are very pretty and some of them are ugly, but they’re all still useful for something. And I like how sometimes the pretty ones are poisonous and the ugly ones are good. When I went to school I found lots of old newspaper articles in the library about you and Dad and I think you two are like plants.’
The man stared at him menacingly through the bars and Draco waited for him to say something else. He was surprised that he wasn’t even angry, but his limbs felt so heavy that he doubted he had the energy to feel anything at all. He wanted to ask what would happen to him, how long he was going to be here, whether he would be allowed to fight the charge or write letters, but he knew by the victorious look on the man’s face that it would be futile.
‘Why do you think you can help me?’ He asked her. She shrugged.
“For fuck sake, Granger! What do you take me for?!” He slammed his hand down on the piano, making the strings beneath vibrate in an eerie drone. They, all three of them, were sat in the parlour. Draco had been running up and down every arpeggio he had ever learned to keep his hands from shaking. He sneezed, his head pounding twice before settling again.
‘Is the right answer. Don’t ever let me see you do it again.’ Hannah nodded and scurried out of the room quickly. He turned his attention back to Harry who was gaping at him and he frowned.
He couldn’t bear to stand in his hiding place any longer. He stepped out from behind the bush and walked with false confidence to the conservatory. Malfoy was still singing, now with her eyes closed, and didn’t open them again until Harry was almost right in front of her. As soon as she saw him, the music stopped. In the split second that her face remained open and serene he noticed how long her eyelashes were as they brushed against her cheekbones when she blinked.
“What do you want me to say? I don’t know.” He said firmly. Granger looked at him with a piercing stare until she decided she was satisfied he was telling the truth. She returned to her seat and scrubbed her hands over her face in frustration and it left her looking even more tired than she had when she arrived.
‘Oof,’ he huffed as her little body slammed into him. He felt her tense in his arms and for a second, he was worried she’d hurt herself. She held herself far enough away from him to look at him with her wide blue eyes.
As he threw up onto the gravel driveway, he was suddenly struck by the difference between expectation and reality.
‘Well alright then.’ Harry said as he walked over to the floo.
‘No. No you’re not.’ Draco’s voice cracked. His father was dead, he couldn’t hurt him now. He could feel it, everything was wrong. Magic prickled harshly across his skin, like he was being stabbed with hundreds of tiny needles.
Malfoy clears his throat awkwardly and Harry releases his hold of him. He turns away, embarrassed that Malfoy caught him staring and thinking about the pins and needles sensation he now has in his palm down to his fingertips. Now isn’t the time to get distracted; there are lives at stake.
“There you are!” He jumped when he reached the bottom of the stairs, crossed the hallway, and almost ran directly into Pansy coming from the other direction. She was already dressed and had a full face of make up on – red lipstick included. He didn’t know how she did it so early in the day.
good. In the few minutes Draco had withdrawn into his mind, Hermione had sensed a shift in the mood.
Kissing Malfoy was nothing like kissing anyone else. It should have been fierce and energetic like they had always been with each other – competitive like they had always been. But it wasn’t. She tasted like the tea she had been drinking earlier, but there was an aura about her that reminded him of vanilla. Not the overly sweet kind that made your teeth rot, but something spicier. She let him take over, but she gave as good as she got. Before he knew it, his hands were in her hair, unravelling the bun she had wrapped it in and running his hands through those perfect curls he was so obsessed with.
Draco watched as Teddy practically danced down the street towards the ice cream parlour. He took in the delight on Teddy’s face that was there just because he was spending time with Draco, and he was sure that whenever his time came, he was most assuredly going to hell.
“What?” He snapped.
Pansy followed them all the way out of the house and down the long driveway until they were off Malfoy property, where Draco was promptly apparated away. Her indignant shouting rang in his ears and the image of the elves staring mournfully out of the first-floor windows was burned into the back of his mind. Before he could recover from the discomfort of side-along apparition, he was being dragged unceremoniously forward. Trying not to trip over his own feet, he realised the indignity of his situation. He was being escorted through the middle of the Atrium, where both Ministry employees and visitors alike could witness what was happening – and witness they did.
He glanced at his watch and realised he was going to be late. Last night he’d finally managed to break through the last ward and would be stepping inside the chateau for the first time. He’d asked Pansy to accompany him in case he came across anything untoward. He tugged his cloak further around himself as the chill of the evening stung his cheeks. He’d started a new routine since he’d moved which meant he walked down to the nearest park before apparating to his chosen destination, to get some fresh air in his lungs on days he was stuck indoors. He’d found an interesting article in a French
Draco glanced over at a picture frame above the fireplace. It had been taken when Teddy was a small baby, before he and Harry had been married. Teddy was squirming in Harry’s arms and wiggling his chubby little fingers at Draco. Mrs Weasley had managed to capture the exact moment Teddy’s hair had changed from his favourite turquoise shade, but he’d had less control over it when he was a baby, and it ended up half white-blond, half jet black. Draco realised that it wasn’t just about him and Harry. Teddy had been, and still was, as much part of their relationship as he or Harry ever were. Draco owed it to Teddy to own up to his mistakes. He’d taken yet another happy family away from a kind hearted little boy who deserved so much more. He shook his head as he made his choice. It was now or never.
As he left the kitchen, he felt a cool hand on his arm. Lyra was looking at him with a soft expression.
He cleared his throat awkwardly.
” She was screeching at the Hit Wizards as they checked the strength of Draco’s painfully tight bonds. Draco wished she would shut up before she made anything worse, but his words failed him.
“You’re not well, Draco.”
“Potter?” Harry wonders if Malfoy realises his posture straightened stiffly when he registered him. “Whatever it is I have nothing to do with it!”
Harry finished getting undressed and slid into bed next to Draco. He pulled him flush against his chest, but Draco didn’t react to him at all.
‘How much do I owe you?’ He asked Daphne as Ella scuttled off, her now much shorter curls bouncing prettily behind her.
‘Master prefers this room to all others.’ Draco jumped half out of his skin and let out a rather undignified squawk. He wheeled around to find a craggy old house elf so decrepit, he made Kreacher look lively.
‘Does that mean you forgive me?’ He asked him hopefully.
“No matter Tressy, you are not in trouble. Please, leave us.” Tressy’s large eyes watered, and she wiped her nose on her grubby sleeve. Draco had never once regretted his decision to give the elves clothes. He could rest easier knowing the elves still at the Manor were there because they wanted to be, not because they had to be. She didn’t look as if she wanted to leave, but when one of her friends, Simon, nudged her on the shoulder, she conceded. He was touched by her loyalty.
‘Will you manage the apparition back? Or do you need longer to calm down?’ Draco didn’t really care. They’d had a great day so far and even if the apparition made him sick, it wouldn’t dampen his mood.
‘I trust you!’ She said sweetly, her cute little dimples flashing when she smiled at him. He felt the familiar squeeze of apparition and he tried not to breathe until it was over. His stomach flipped a full 360 and he held Ella closer as if she would protect him from the feeling. The little girl on the other hand, had no such issues.
‘Hot date. You’re so full of shit, Draco.’ She laughed. It was funny seeing Hermione without the kids around because it was like she made the most of the opportunity to swear. ‘Don’t let Ronald hear you say that.’ She shot him a playful look and he rolled his eyes.
Now that he thought about it, these ideas were harder to grasp. He frowned, trying to picture the look on Malfoy’s face at the top of the Astronomy Tower that fateful night, but the harder he tried to match the face before him to the memory, the further away from him it seemed. It was like he was losing touch, drifting away, anchorless.
‘Don’t be ridiculous, it’s just that the letter “d” happens to be the easiest sound to make. Shouldn’t you know- never mind.’ She passed Hugo to him, who promptly started crying.
Hermione nodded sagely. ‘It’s not surprising really. The first term away is always the hardest. I swear the kids become different people when you two are here, they haven’t been this quiet in weeks.’ Draco glanced over to Harry and found he’d stopped tickling Rose and instead she was tucked against his side with her thumb wedged in her mouth. If Draco had his camera with him, he wouldn’t have hesitated to snap a photograph.
‘I’ll never be as clever as you! But…I think…well, it’s a bit stupid, I only just went to school…’ Teddy dropped his hands under the table, looking self-conscious suddenly.
“Whoever it is, Tressy will show them through if it’s important.” Sure enough, a couple of minutes later their guest, or guests, arrived at the breakfast room door. However, while Draco had expected cordial greetings and offers of tea, he was about to find his pitiful breakfast curtailed.
“There’s nothing there,” Draco says, frowning at the mostly blank screen. Harry explains to him that he needs to sign up to see anything, but Draco doesn’t like the idea of signing anything. His father told him to always read the small print, and he can’t even see the large print! Meanwhile Harry is miles ahead of him.
‘Isn’t this what Smith said was stopping you? Isn’t this what you were hoping for?’ Harry was a Gryffindor through and through. If this were him, he would jump in without a second thought. Draco wasn’t like that though, he was cautious, he assessed everything. Maybe that was what held him back to much. Maybe once in a while he needed to be more Harry.
He took hold of the other half of the button with the hand that wasn’t holding Harry’s a minute before the hour. Just before the clock struck, Harry let go of Draco’s hand and wrapped his arm around his shoulders – Draco guessed he knew that this was going to be difficult for him, although he wasn’t sure he’d be able to keep his hold while they travelled.
‘It seems they found out you were on the case somehow. Turns out they were trying to find a way to kill off muggleborns without there being any direct contact involved between the neo-Death Eater movement and the general populous. You moved right into the area of their supplier and suddenly you take ill with the worst case ever? Not a coincidence.’
“I’ll deal with her,” Granger said, getting up to follow. Draco caught her wrist gently.
Out of interest, he pressed his hand fully to the bare wood of the ceiling beams. The effect was intense. It was as if he could feel the life of the building run right through him.
