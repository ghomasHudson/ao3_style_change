"I'll be by with dinner later, something healthy but comforting," Molly promised. She brushed a kiss to his temple and headed back out the door. Harry heard his front door slam as he slumped back against his pillows.
"Right, yeah," Harry turned back to Draco and realised he was still holding his hand, "Um, bye?"
Harry nodded into Draco's neck, sniffling again and clutching Draco's arm close.
Harry fell silent, staring at the ceiling and listening to the faint chime of the monitoring spells.
"It should have been me. If I'd been sitting away from the wall-"
"Go home, kick out your lover. Make an appointment with Luna, she's a Mind Healer now. She might agree to help you - now anyway," Draco instructed.
He heard Charlie's rough voice whisper to his mother, "I've got him Mum, Harry's here, he's safe." Molly looked like she'd been Kissed by a Dementor, all her warmth and love had been eaten by her grief. Harry mumbled his condolences, clutching his hands into his filthy jumper. Percy was holding George tight against his chest, trying to contain his wordless anguish. Bill and Fleur clung to each other as though they were still bracing for death. Hermione was on her knees at Fred's side with Ron, who looked like he too had died in the battle.
"I want to stay with Uncle Harry," Teddy whined.
Molly sniffled with watery eyes before pulling Harry into a smothering hold. "You are always welcome in our house, Harry. You're as good as my son and you always will be." Harry nodded into her shoulder and pulled back, fixing a kiss on her cheek as he did. "George, can I get Teddy? We're going back to Grimmauld now." The family looked shocked at Harry's casual
"They do, we do," Harry smiled, "Thank you, Winky. I'll drink it."
She was drawn out of her musings by the ground of the Hall shaking under her feet. Unsteady while getting up, she felt Ron pull on her sleeve as he stood with her, his strong arm wrapping around her waist as they moved across the trembling earth to Harry. She felt the wild magic under his skin as she took his right hand, the magic easing when her thumb ran over his clenched fist. Harry turned, fury clear on his face as he looked at Hermione, but the ground stilled slowly after a moment as his face smoothed out again.
"I didn't know," Harry stared at the grey eyes, filled with unshed tears.
"What the fuck are you doing here, Potter!" Ginny screeches, "Leave!"
"Yes, but why won't you call me Harry?" He pleaded to understand.
"It's good that you're back to you again, dear. I missed you," Molly sniffed.
Minty chose that moment to wake up and cry in delight that 'Nana' had come to sleep over.
"Meanwhile, I haven't left your side, I always complete your reports for you, I accompany you to all of those social events, so what does that say?" Draco hummed into Harry's ear.
"I still feel the same," Harry scowled out the window at a sparrow on the tree outside.
"Hi, Hermione, Ron," Harry nervously sits.
"I believe it was this morning," Molly turned to mix the curry she was making on the stove.
"Haven't you told her that Fleur is expecting?" Harry laughed.
"Luna, you won't call me Harry?" Harry sat in a squashy purple chair.
Harry whirls around, dropping the mug on the floor, "Hi."
"We gotta... go downstairs. Before our first time is on Ron's bed." Harry bit his swollen lip and pushed Draco back to open the door.
"Sit," Ron points at a solitary chair just to their right.
Hermione was annoyed. She had been ready and waiting in the living room of The Burrow for an hour. Ron was gathering last minute items that she had
The snow storm howled outside the windows as Draco hurried through the corridor. November had arrived abruptly, bringing with it the coldest winter Hogwarts had seen for a long time. He looked down at his watch, he still had an hour before the Library closed. He had a permission slip from Professor Flitwick to access some books in the Restricted Section for Wheezes, he and George were working on some therapeutic products to extend their post-War comfort line. Clutching his cloak against the chill of the castle, he hurried through a tapestry, taking a shortcut that Hermione had taught him. If he got the restricted books quickly, he could grab a few of the romance novels that Madam Pince had recommended after she caught him and Hermione reading a Victorian novel instead of studying.
"What?" Harry looked up so quickly he felt the room begin to spin.
"I'm gonna go, thank you for seeing me," Harry got up awkwardly.
Draco sucked in a shaky breath, "I'm not leaving him, Mother. I won't abandon him, not now."
Harry glanced at the ground behind them, at Lucius's corpse, unable to protect or harm his family further now he was dead. Harry was immediately angry, only because of Draco and Narcissa's actions, had he had the chance to destroy Tom Riddle. Harry knew that they had just followed the head of the family out of misplaced trust and familial loyalty. How could Harry have ever expected them to reject everything they'd ever known in the face of either submission or death? One of the Aurors was casting an
“How are you so good at this?” Draco asked, the words sounding stuffy, his nose blocked from the crying.
“there was a time, in fifth year, when Blaise went through this period of feeling intense jealousy towards Draco. Draco went through puberty first out of all the boys- Goyle, Crabbe and Nott included, and so he was much taller with a deeper voice and all that, which Blaise seemed to find somewhat emasculating. Then Draco and I entered into what was a very fake relationship so Draco could try and dispel his father’s worries that he was gay, and get Lucius off his back about arranging a marriage.
“I’m confident enough in my academic ability that hopefully my grades will allow me a place” Draco said, trying not to let himself think of what he would do if he didn’t get in.
He had the opportunity to wear a suit, though, which he loved. He was not so politically radical that he didn’t also revel in the luxury his father’s wealth afforded him. He selected a traditional two piece, a dark charcoal grey with a crisp white shirt underneath, and cufflinks inscribed with the Malfoy crest, that matched his signet ring that he had received for his sixteenth birthday from his father.
At Molly Weasley’s request (not that he could ever say no to his surrogate mother) Harry saw a mind-healer daily, and as August dawned, Harry was slowly but surely on the road to recovery. As a birthday gift, Ron and Hermione bought him a radio to replace the one that helped him so long ago, and Harry began to listen to the more modern music played on the more modern stations; Doja cat, Ariana Grande (perhaps an indication of the sexuality he had not yet discovered).  Now that Harry knew he was safe, his enjoyment of music tentatively stretched from listening, then singing and now to dancing along whenever he felt the unfamiliar feeling of happiness and freedom roll through his body in large cresting waves that peaked in his chest and rolled all the way down to his toes. He didn’t have to be good, he was alive and had a body to dance with, and so he danced.
Eventually, Draco dragged himself away, in search of alcohol to distract himself. He landed on a garish looking bottle that called itself ‘raspberry sourz’ and he began to swig with wild abandon. Sometime later, he had no idea how long but long enough for Draco to be almost to the bottle of his second bottle of the weirdly addictive sourz drink, he found himself stumbling on the stairs that led to the loo. He felt a large hand grip his elbow and a deep warm voice laugh behind him. The exact voice he had been trying to avoid all night.
“the Irish muggle from earlier, Hoozy? Hozy?” Draco was cursing his shit-awful memory when he heard the voice again “oh Hozier! I think you’ll like this one” said Harry and soon a slow, mournful song filled the room;
He was studying me again, and it took all of me not to shrink from his gaze. I knew the answer, of course, but he wouldn’t like it.
“Sorry! I’m so sorry I’m late” he pants, standing in the doorway, looking around with an air of apprehension.
“and then- get this! I got here just as Diggory did, and then I had to hide in your bathroom for what felt like hours as I waited for him to leave the whole wing! Nice hair mousse, by the way” Harry said, and then winked at him.
“None taken darling. We are equally uninterested in each other”  Luna said with her characteristic bluntness.
“You look beautiful, Pans” Draco said, taking her hand and twirling her round.
Draco gasped, and received a weird look from the woman manning the sandwich table. He blushed and hastily walked away. He saw Ron reach for Bryn. Harry grabbed Ron by the bicep and pulled him away, followed by Remus. Bryn looked right at Draco and Draco tripped over his feet in an effort to turn around and make it look like he hadn't been watching the whole exchange.
Draco slapped him on the arm, letting his hand linger.
“christ Malfoy not like that. I meant that if you shuffled over to me then my body heat would stop you shivering so much. I’m using my fleece as a pillow; you can wear it if you want”
Paris, Madrid, Rome and Athens, passed by in a blur of self-exploration and hedonistic enjoyment. In the humid heat of the arrondissments, in between nightclubs in plazas, Harry discovered in a month what he should have come to realise over the course of years. In a letter to Ron and Hermione (who had gone on a romantic getaway to the granger’s Australian residence) he wrote about the god-like Greek he had met, introducing him to the wonders of bisexuality. He talked of the beaches of Sitges, where men could love each other openly, freely, and purely. He talked of fleeting kisses stolen behind the colosseum  and among the ruins of Delphi. Harry danced across Europe, revelling in the gay muggle community he found there, waiting to accept him with open arms.
Harry ate quickly and left, grunting something about seeing to his pigs, leaving the kitchen faster than Draco had ever seen him.
He showed the phone to Sirius, happy to have found another person who was unequivocally in his corner.
They wandered back to the car, and Sirius knocked on the door of the house they had parked in front of. A tall black woman opened the door, her face set like thunder. She broke out into a smile when she saw Sirius though, and drew him into a crushing embrace.
“Did you say visitor?”
“I don’t belong to him, Pansy” huffed Harry, somewhat annoyed. Blaise was so far proving to be less of a prick than Draco, and Harry was not beyond considering the other dark skin man as a potential partner, if only for one night. He got the feeling that it wouldn’t affect any budding friendship between the two.
Pansy interrupted before they could get further by crowding into Harry’s personal space, coo-ing at Teddy. The baby reached out a chubby hand to grasp at her finger and she squealed with delight. “something about hot men and children” she said in a low, sultry voice. “my ovaries are barely hanging on.”
Pansy turned around and started to grind on Harry. Harry found this hilarious and gently placed his broad hands on her hips. He was having so much fun he missed the way Draco stared murderously at Pansy, and longingly at Harry. Pansy however, missed nothing and grabbed Draco, stepping away from Harry and pushing him into her place. Harry laughed at the look on Draco’s face but kept dancing with the blond.
“what music is this then, Potter?”
“you heathen”
“Yeah, that sounds good. We could watch a film?” Hermione asked. Draco nodded and offered her one of his t-shirts to sleep in. He let her change in his room and she came out again, his t-shirt, that was another school one, drowned her, covering her shorts and falling to mid-thigh. Before now, Draco hadn’t quite appreciated the height difference between them, but he often forgot how tall he was, because of how small he had always felt at home.
“She can come back ‘n visit anytime, lad” he said, the deep cadence of his voice comforting, and Draco was distracted from his sadness of seeing Pansy go by just desperately wishing Sirius and Remus could have been his father’s instead. Sighing, he let Remus gently turn him and lead him back to the car, and they drove back in peaceful silence, occasionally broken by gentle conversation, Remus inquiring as to how he knew Pansy, and what made them such close and strong friends.
“Not today. too hungover” Harry groaned.
“come on Draco, you’ll like this next one better.” Said Harry. The second shirt was a deep forest green, with large silver and red snakes embroidered on each side of Harry’s chest.
“it’s not like I have anywhere else to go” shouts Draco back, his defensiveness a sharp contrast to his silence the past few weeks. “I’m not going to be celibate like you. Unlike you, people actually want to fuck me. People actually like me” he’s not sure why he says this. He knows Harry is loved more than Draco will ever be, but Draco relies on his pull nights to feel some semblance of self-worth and validation, and he cannot bear the thought of that being taken away.
Harry laughed and wriggled out from between the two Gryffindors. He linked arms with Blaise and Pansy and the three went down to the living room.
I’m sipping wine in a robe
“I cannot imagine how hard it must be for you to be in this position” Harry says softly, and Draco feels a large, warm hand cover his. He opens his eyes again, looking down at the contrast between brown and white skin.
Here, Draco seemed unable to get the words out, as if saying Blaise’s name would poison his tongue.
“you really don’t have to, it’s fine.” Harry insisted, even though he reallyyyy wanted to know what it was like to drive in a Bently.
Soon they were all dressed, and Harry was just zipping up Luna’s dress when the door opened.
“the duke of Edinburgh, or DofE awards are a muggle educational initiative designed as a form of fun learning experience that strengthens university applications. There are three levels, bronze, silver and gold. I assume we would only be doing bronze?” Here McGonagall nodded, and said “and only the expedition” and so Hermione continued. “the bronze level consists of spending six months developing a skill, doing consistent exercise, and volunteering as well as the expedition. the bronze level expedition is a weekend of camping basically, but hiking too. Its designed to help develop skills like teamwork, map reading, navigation and orientation, and so on. In small groups, usually of about six, students must plan a route of a set number of kilometres through the countryside over the course of three days and two nights. This route must pass through specific campsites for the group to sleep at on the two nights. On DofE, the students must carry their tent, sleeping bag and roll mat, as well as all their food and portable camp stoves. At most muggle schools, the bronze level is completed in year ten, with a practice weekend expedition with teacher guidance, and then a second real ‘examination’ weekend with no guidance but regular checkpoints to ensure safety.”
They talked about future plans; Ron saying he was going to work in the joke shop, Parkinson saying she was interested in pursuing muggle fashion, and Hermione replying that she could help Parkinson apply to central saint martins. Harry voiced his wish to travel far and wide before even considering work, and Zabini said he was off to Italy with his mother and step-dad number 5.
Harry’s gentle voice soon joined in, ‘oh mama don’t fuss over me. The way she tells me I’m hers and she’s mine, open hand or closed fist would be fine, blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine’
Pansy immediately turned her back to him and curled up, indicating that she wanted him to mirror her position behind her, and he did, tucking his knees behind her knees and wrapping an arm around her stomach.
“Bathroom’s easy t’understand. It’s only a shower though so if you’re ever wanting a bath you come up to the house alright? It’s usually just us, but people drop in and out all t’time. Alright?”
“congratulations Weasley, you can read” drawled an obnoxious voice from behind them.
His giddy mood was cut like a knife when we opened the door to his dorm to the screams and cries of his roommate, clearly in the throes of a nightmare.
“come and sit, Granger. It’s nice to have a fellow girl in and amongst all this testosterone.”
“yes, I must admit I rather do” said the blond. It was sweet, thought Harry, the pretentious way in which Draco talked. Now he knew of Draco’s feelings, he was seeing the blond in an entirely new light, and quite a positive one.
“woah, what’s up mate?” asked Dean, bringing his hands up to hold Harry’s shoulders.
He doesn’t know what to do, and so he does what he thinks he would want, if he were in Draco’s position. He goes to get Teddy from Molly, and carries the napping infant into their bedroom. Draco is asleep, on his back, looking so peaceful, as if the day before had never happened. Silently, Harry lay’s Teddy’s body on Draco’s chest, and silently retreats. Teddy’s small, chubby body offers a unique sort of comfort that only children can provide.
“I think today is going to be another of those times” he says, crossing my floor and turning my desk chair round so I’m facing my bed, which he then sits down on. I distantly notice that he put a t-shirt on before coming to talk to me. He heaves a sigh again, and I am suddenly scared for what he is going to say.
“there’s nothing to forgive, Mrs Malfoy. I do, however, have a favour, or a request of sorts I suppose. As you know your sister Andromeda is Teddy’s grandmother, and she’s very overwhelmed with grief at the loss of Tonks and Lupin at the moment. I was hoping you could write to her maybe, try and rebuild the bridge between you. She told me she missed the time you two spent together as girls.” Harry said, shifting in his seat. Narcissa’s tears started in earnest now, and she looked at Teddy reverently before saying, “I miss my Andy so much too. Would she meet with me, if I asked?” she asked, looking up at Harry, her grey-blue eyes boring into his green ones.
Remus’ eyes filled with love and Draco had to look away for a moment. His Father had never looked at his mother like that.
Draco was rooted the spot, unable to tear his eyes away, and even missed the cheers and whoops as Hermione began to do the same with Ron, as no-one had ever seen her so that loose at a party.  The song began to end, and Draco heaved a sigh of relief, hoping the spectacle was over, but to his disdain a new song with the same beat and accent began, and Harry and Bianca showed no signs of stopping, in fact Harry yelled in delight as the song came on, and the two went at it with renewed vigour.
“Shit. He must be working his way up. we have to get him up before Diggory leaves that room” Ron said, glancing towards the bathroom that was worryingly silent.
“not really, Potter” Blaise growled, and before Harry had a chance to ask what was wrong, Blaise was grabbing the lapel of Harry’s shirt, slamming him into the wall and kissing him, rough and hard. Harry slammed his hands into Blaise’s chest and pushed with all his strength, causing the other man to stumble back.
The words hung above, but never would form
“Thank you for trusting me with that, Draco” Harry said, sincere all of a sudden. Draco let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He had still half expected him to take the piss. He hadn't realised how good it would feel to be accepted. He still sort-of saw it as a problem. That there was something wrong with him because of it. Harry’s earnest reaction lessened that feeling somewhat.
Luna floated over, dress floating around her legs like a cloud. “they’re not coming, you know. Voldemort Killed Harry’s parents 18 years ago today.” He hated how the harsh words sounded in her soft cadence, and he hated himself for forgetting. He was supposed to be Harry’s friend. Harry was always there to pull him out of a nightmare, to defend him when people remembered his initial role in the war, and yet he was sat here, having fun while Harry was suffering what must be the worst day of the year. He stands up on wobbly legs, and determinedly makes his way up to his room. Harry’s name dies on his lips when he enters and he sees the broad, muscled body of Ron curled possessively around Harry, and Harry’s body curled around Hermione’s in turn. His body turns to lead. How could he ever think he could help Harry at a time like this, when he followed the man that caused all of Harry’s pain. How could he ever even think of Harry as a friend, when he was so unworthy of the kind of friendship Harry offered. He cast a silencing charm on himself, grabbed the bottle from his bed and stumbled unnoticed into the bathroom, before he climbed into the bath, prepared to drink himself into oblivion.
“Come in, come in you must be frozen dear” she said, wrapping an arm around him and pulling him into the house, kissing him on the cheek before insisting on helping him out of his coat.
“Did your mam never teach you consent, Bryn?” Remus said, stepping up behind them. Draco saw Bryn blanch before he turned around.
He was thinking about Draco a lot…
Much to his surprise, Harry and Ron returned later that evening. He had though Harry would want to spend the evening with Sirius. He said as much, but Harry had explained that he felt he had missed too much school already, but he was leaving Friday after lessons to spend the weekend with Sirius.
The first few days of the Christmas holidays passed by in a blur of essays and textbooks. Hermione forced all the boys to get their work done before Christmas and new years so that they could party guilt-free for the rest of the holiday.  The golden trio went to the burrow for Christmas, staying Christmas eve, Christmas day and leaving boxing day afternoon. With the added guests of Luna and her father, Harry had a wonderful, if bittersweet time there. He was reminded of how he had thought all of his Christmases hence would have been spent with Ginny by his side, before they ultimately decided that the war had impacted their relationship beyond repair. Molly dealt with the grief of the first Christmas without Fred by keeping busy; she didn’t sit down for a moment and was churning out mince pies and knitted vestments like a one-woman factory. Arthur and George were broody and withdrawn, and Ron, Bill and Charlie tried to make up for the obvious, glaring lack by being louder and more cheerful than anyone could stand. But still, this was Harry’s family, and he would not change them for the world. Presents were small and shared in a subdued manner as if everyone present was thinking the same thing; just being alive and together was gift enough for this Christmas.
Draco is so overwhelmed by the invitation he forgets to protest. Forgets to remind himself that the Gryffindor’s won’t want him at their Christmas. He’s too giddy and it’s all he can do to breathe and say “yeah, okay” before grinning into his pillow like a maniac.
“They taught you good manners then,” Sirius said, standing. “Tea?”
“Yes, please”
Eventually, he felt Hermione’s head drooping onto his shoulder and he helped her up and steered her to the bed, going as far as to tuck her in, before he pulled a hoodie on, not bothered to get the blanket from the farmhouse, and fell asleep.
“Thank fuck for that” Harry breathed.
Her and Potter had been having, well not quite an argument but definitely what my mother would describe as a ‘heated discussion’. I couldn’t quite hear what they were saying but it got more intense until Hermione stepped back, tears in her eyes and walked off, sniffing as Potter yelled behind her “’mione, no, I didn’t mean- I didn’t, shit ‘mione I’m sorry!”
The only slightly dark point of the weeks that turned May into June was that Harry hadn’t warmed to Draco any more. He was coldly polite, bordering on near-friendly sometimes, when Draco was traipsing after him on the farm, but he still maintained his distance, and though Draco loved that Remus and Sirius seemed to like him so much, he still craved the company of someone his own age. There was more often than not one of the Weasley son’s round, often Ron, and they always took up Harry’s full attention, Draco left somewhat forgotten on the end of the table, talking to Remus about something or other.
“Aye, that he is,” Harry sighed. “He tried t’kiss me last summer and I was just drunk enough that I let him for about a minute before pushing him off, and since then he won’t leave me alone.”
“Had a wonderful night that I can barely remember and is never to be repeated” Harry said.
The drive back consisted of Draco and Hermione discussing their studies after realising that they had both studied English and History. Hermione had then also studied politics and sociology, and Draco had done French. They discussed which exam boards they had done, what their A-Levels had been like, and discovered they had also done the exact same History exams.
“Just focus on her being here now. I can leave youse, if you want more time with her?” he asked, and Draco was shocked at the apparent consideration. Harry seemed to really dislike Draco, and he had never struck Draco as being a particularly kind person. Nice, maybe, but not kind.
“who was that?” I ask
He took a deep breath, and reminded himself that from now until November he was at these people’s mercy. Summoning all the good manners beaten into him as a child he nodded and said
Given that it was about 11am, Harry accio’d his book, and settled in to read. Soon enough, he heard Draco shift and a leg was thrown over his. Around fifteen minutes later, Draco moved again, curling his whole body against Harry’s side.
And so, Draco talked. There wasn’t much to say, really. Just that he thought he had hated his father before but now he didn’t think he could ever look the man in the eye again and if he should tell his mother, and if he should then how. And Harry listened, patiently.
Draco fell into the monotony of his steps, walking a good few metres behind the rest of the group, surrounded by the sound of his breathing and the thump of his feet hitting the soft springy grass that carpeted the valley they were in. Before he knew it, Granger had announced that they had reached their campsite for the night, and Draco heaved a sigh of relief, knowing that there was only a few hours hike the next morning before they would be safely back in Hogwarts, and he would never half to walk again. He then felt melancholy descend over him when he realised that he would never get to spend this time with Potter again, and he felt a horrible crushing sensation in his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because he likes you, you tit. It’s obvious.”
“you really are arse over tit for him aren’t you Malfoy”
“Y’alreet Harry?” Remus asked as the boy sat heavily down at the table .
Later, sat in his Harry-less room, Draco felt the oppressive weight of the emptiness and silence begin to weigh on him, and without thinking too hard he reached for the bottle he knew was tucked under his bed. Feeling a mixture of pride (this was his first time succumbing to the comfort of muggle vodka since returning to Hogwarts) and disgust (the minute he was alone he reached for the comfort held in the neck of a bottle) he unscrewed the top of the bottle and drank deeply.
Ron was in just a pair of pants on what must have been his bed, on his phone doing something or other. The floor was a mess of clothes and socks and books, but there was a clear line down the middle, differentiating whose clothes and socks and books.
Bolstered by the darkness, and perhaps by the fact that Harry pretty much couldn’t run away, Draco said
“right” said that same voice from right behind him, as the hand withdrew. “this is as good a place as any; lunch time”.
“how is it that I’m suddenly this awful person, and you are everyone’s best friend”
“I am so sorry harry, more than you could ever know. I am sorry for all of it. I am sorry I tried to give you up to you-know-who during the battle. I’m sorry I didn’t apologise the minute I first saw you; I just didn’t know what to say.”
Is this just fantasy
Theo held a massive new years party, and invited Ron and Harry and Hermione, as well as Luna and Ginny. Harry had the time of his life, meeting loads of new people, going to a party with Draco on his arm, kissing Draco at midnight with fireworks in the background. It was the best holiday Harry had ever had.
brief warning, this chapter has mentions of cancer and death from cancer, so please don't read if that will upset you!!
“Sure, sounds good” Harry said, climbing onto the bed next to Draco.
“sure Pansy, I can take you out later if you want?” Harry said, “I think Draco is out for the day to be honest.” Pansy gave him one of her rare, genuine smiles.
The night was lovely, and the two groups of friends got along like a house on fire. The club was heaving, and alcohol was flowing freely. Much like the night before, harry noticed that Draco was supremely bad at holding his liquor. At one point, he looked very close to being sick, so harry manhandled him out into the alleyway that served as the smoking area, and not a moment too soon. The minute the fresh air hit Draco he doubled over, one hand bracing himself against the wall and threw up, a lot. Harry propped him up and rubbed his back. A kindly smoker gave Harry a bottle, and after making sure it was definitely water, he held it to Draco’s lips and helped the sweaty, wasted blond take small sips. He knew he should get Draco home, but he didn’t want to leave the others with no explanation. In his drunk state, he could think of no better option than to mutter under his breath “accio Blaise”, immensely grateful for the fact that he was a powerful enough wizard to do so.  A minute later, Blaise stumbled out of the door looking very confused at how he had been magically dragged there. He saw Draco and then Harry and before Harry got a word in said “he always does this. Good thing you were there to get him outside. Take him home, I’ll look after the others.”
“who the fuck is laughing this early” said Dean
“I’m not quite sure what you mean” came Ron’s voice, deep, and teetering in the line of threatening.
“of course mate, you’re family, yeah? You want to stay with me?”
“there’s your feelings. Those are important, and I’m sure you have a lot right now” Harry said, still just standing in front of Draco.
“ I know this is going to sound horribly insincere, but I wanted to apologise to you. All of your friends of course, but you first. Nothing I can say will ever excuse my behaviour, however if you would be so kind as to give me an opportunity to explain it,” here, Harry nodded warily, still not breaking his intense eye contact with Draco. Unable to bear the heat of Harry’s gaze, Draco looked down. “I see now that my father was only sustained by his perceived superiority over others. He was a small and weak man, and I learnt this summer while reading family history accounts that he was also a sickly child who was unloved by his mother and father alike. His pureblood status was all that he had, and it became his lifeblood. He forced these beliefs onto me, perhaps seeing my penchant for femininity and my closeness to my mother, and believing that I would never be a ‘man’ in the traditional sense, and thus that I too would need the security of the supremacy of my blood to be the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning.” He huffed a weak laugh here. “it was, you know, the only thing that kept him living. When the war was lost and he was forced to face his own inferiority, and weakness, he lost his sense of self, his whole identity. He died before he even made it to Azkaban.” Draco looked up now, made confident by the fact that he was yet to be hexed. “I’m not my father though, as much as I used to want to be. I have things that get me out of bed in the morning, and I refuse to let blood-purist ideology and prejudice be one of those reasons ever again. I am so sorry Potter, and I also wanted to thank you for speaking on my behalf; it was undeserved, and I will be grateful for it until my last breath.” Draco closed his eyes now, finally done with the speech he had rehearsed ceaselessly on the train. He repeated his mantra; he didn’t need to be forgiven, free was enough. (and yet… some small part of him ached to hear words of acceptance, recognition of his penance)
The night passed with easy, teasing conversation. Teddy fell asleep in Harry’s lap early on, but Harry was enjoying himself too much to drag him away to his nursery, so he let the baby sleep on him.
Harry said, perching himself on the edge of Draco’s bed, as Draco sat on his desk chair.
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn
Malfoy shuffled over to Harry, moving like an ungraceful caterpillar, until the two were nose to nose.
“Er, no. is he your dorm mate? That’s a couple floors up, I think” Ron said, as Harry looked on in mild amusement.
The one benefit of no one other than Remus, who was currently engaged with Molly, talking to him was that Draco was left to observe the little world he had stumbled into, and he was noticing more and more discord with every passing day. If he had been at school, he would have filed away this information to later use against them. Private boy’s schools were more cutthroat than given credit for, however despite the clear undercurrents of stress and pain and conflict, this world was peaceful on the whole, and Draco was loath to bring that discord to the surface.
Harry took a deep breath.
Draco was so happy to be home. Back in his massive house in his massive bedroom in his massive bed. He missed his mother, and it was nice to see her again. He had spent all of last night with her in her dressing room, braiding her hair like he used to when he was younger, while he told her all about school and his new friends Harry and Ron and how they were rugby boys but not prejudiced and so unlike the rugby boys of the years before.
Granger had mad tea with the left-over hot water though, thank god for small mercies. Pansy sat now, a steaming mug in her hand as she watched the Gryffindor men build a bonfire. She wondered why- they didn’t have enough matches for extra fires outside of lighting the camp stove. She said as much, and was taken aback by Potter’s answer.
Harry felt strangely nervous for Draco’s imminent arrival, and busied himself by baking. He gave Teddy to the Weasleys for a night and barely left the kitchen. When we went to pick Teddy back up on Tuesday evening, he gave Molly and Arthur a batch of scones, a tub of biscuits and a banana loaf cake for their trouble. Less than half of what he had made. As Teddy didn’t seem to want to sleep, he sat on the armchair with the boy in his arms, feeding Teddy little bites of biscuit as Harry methodically made his way through a whole batch. Soon Teddy got drowsy, so Harry put him to bed and fell asleep in the armchair, content to stay with his godson for a while longer; tomorrow, it would no longer just be the two of them. It was a bittersweet feeling. Harry awoke, body stiff and aching from his night in the armchair. He realised that in his reminiscing he had forgotten to bathe Teddy the night before, and so decided to do it that morning. He took the large bucket he used, always too scared Teddy would drown in the bath, even with only 3 inches of water, and decided to bathe Teddy whilst he made breakfast. While the bacon was sizzling away, he gently soaped Teddy’s body while the baby wriggled and splashed him, giggling. Harry loved this so much. He wrapped Teddy up in a towel whilst he ate, realising he had forgotten to ask Draco what time he would be moving in.
"I'm sorry," Harry told him.
"What are you doing?" Ron snapped.
"Insanely lovesick" Blaise added and Draco only smiled.
"It was NOT a one-night stand!" He yelled without thinking.
"Uncle Dwaco!" He threw his little arms around Draco's neck and smiled uncontrollably. "Wello"
“I’m doing an online course about law and politics whilst I decide what I want to do. My dad has sickle-cell, and gets quite ill, so me and mum like to be there for him. Harry loves it here too much to ever leave, and this farm is his birthright here. He fits in here as much as the cows do, and he has his a-levels should he ever change his mind. Ron is the same. They’re happy here together. I know- I know that you might not understand that, given the world you grew up in, but there's a lot out there outside education, you know? And lots of people struggle within the traditional academic structure. Ron is really dyslexic, and he found school near-impossible. For him, uni would likely be the same” Hermione said.
Seemingly eager to change the subject, Sirius stopped abruptly and said “right. We just need to pick up Hermione then it’s home for lunch” with forced cheer.
“order? Oh god no. I made it all” explained Harry as he picked up Teddy and gestured to his guests to sit.
He skidded into the classroom twenty minutes late, and collapsed into his chair next to Harry, who looked upsetting put together for the first Monday back from the first holiday of the year.
There were pictures of Harry and Ron, wet and smiling in swim trunks by a river, Harry and Hermione standing in school uniform with massive backpacks and too-big blazers, more of Harry with Remus or Sirius or both. Pictures of Harry with the grandma that Draco had met.
He fell asleep before he got there though, and awoke to cries muffled by the bathroom door. He lurched upwards, and saw that Harry was once again alone. A drunkenly cast tempus showed it was past 3am, and Draco scrambled over to Harrys bed, before climbing in fully clothed and lying on his back, Harry facing away from him. He thought of what to do. His mother had always comforted him as a child. She had done so in French so Lucius could not understand, and so now Draco associated French with love, and comfort, and gentleness. Before he knew it, he was softly slurring into the darkness, reaching out to grip Harry’s hand.
“Come here” Harry said, before pulling Draco against him. Draco cuddled into his side, and Harry dropped a kiss to his forehead. Draco blushed at the domesticity of it.
Harry felt all the tension drain out of him like someone had turned a tap. He grinned and said “no, no of course we’re okay with it.”
Still upsettingly hungover, Draco made his way to dinner from the library, where he had sought the quiet to soothe his headache. He was shocked to see Harry and Ron sat at a table with Theo and Blaise, talking earnestly about something. As he neared, he heard their conversation.
"I can't even eat Molly's pies anymore," Harry sighed, "And she makes the best steak and kidney pie."
"That was a lie!" Harry blurted out, rather more loudly than he meant to.
"Draco, come for a walk with me?" Harry stood up and jerked his head towards the back door. He grabbed his coat and Draco's before they stepped outside into the wintry air.
"Yes, Luna has me in every two days for a session though," Harry mumbles, cleaning up the smashed mug with a Reparo.
"You feel bad for me?" Harry's voice was muted.
"Fuck!" Harry raced back to the Burrow (forgetting Apparition in his panic). He barged into the living room, dripping wet and out of breath, but Draco was not there. Narcissa gave him a disappointed grimace and rushed out the front door, her crack of Disapparation heard soon after.
She knew he loved Draco. "Harry! Breathe, breathe!" He felt the panic swell and deflate in his chest. "Harry, Ron and I like Draco. I know it seems hard to believe considering the past, but he has been nothing but loving and supportive of the entire family. He pushes to learn more to overcome his bigoted childhood than anyone could hope. He respects and adores my parents. Just, don't break your own heart for anyone else's sake, okay?" Harry nodded and she dropped the
"Draco, you were very fortunate, for things to work out as they did," Narcissa's gentle voice broke into his grief, "Harry would be upset if he saw how tired you are, risking your recovery."
"Ready?" Andromeda looked to Draco, who nodded sternly.
"Honestly, I can't think of anything else to do with it," Draco suddenly grinned, "Finnegan, you've always been good with pyrotechnics, do me a favour and try to brew something explosive in there, will you?"
Draco stared back at Harry and pulled up his sleeve, baring the Dark Mark to all, "I shouldn't have been given the choice between servitude to a killer or my mother's life."
Healer Gurjeet raised her eyebrows, "Are you alright?"
Harry stood with Kingsley and his friends, feeling his rage turn into satisfaction, the monster in his chest settling into prideful triumph.
Harry was breathing hard, eyes darting around the room furiously before his eyes fixed back onto Draco. "You - were - dead," Harry's voice was croaky from his dry throat.
Harry sighed and stared down at his bony wrists, he reminded himself to eat more. Draco was always on him to eat three wholesome meals a day.
Harry sat up and yawned, he would fall asleep if he laid down any longer. Pansy looked over at him, "Alright Potter, if we're boring you? You can do this quiz with me." Harry chuckled, "Right then Parkinson, what's the quiz." Pansy shot him a dangerously evil smile, "Well, Potter, let's find out 'What Kind of Man is For You?'" Harry flushed and glanced at the back of Draco's head. He hadn't acknowledged their conversation at all. He nodded at Pansy to begin. "Okay, Potter, first question. What are you most drawn to in a guy? A - his smile. B - his eyes. C - his clothes. D - his car." Harry thought for a moment, "Well, only person I know with a car is Arthur, and his car is running feral in the Forbidden Forest." Pansy laughed. Harry continued, "So I guess it would be his eyes." Pansy moved on, "Okay, when you like a guy, how do you get his attention? A - flirt with him blatantly. B - become his friend and get to know his deepest secrets. C - ignore him except to give him sexy looks. D - tell his friends you're interested." Harry thought it over, Ginny yelled out, "It's B. Harry couldn't flirt if he tried, and he's never ignored anyone in his life. Case in point - Harry and Draco for years one through six." Harry blushed and nodded at Pansy, who smirked knowingly.
Malfoy and Hermione caught the brunt of the blast. Kingsley just said that Malfoy got up a Shield Charm a second too late to stop the bomb completely. I can't believe he knew what it was once he saw it. What the fuck did Death Eaters get up to for Malfoy to know what bombs are? Shit, sixteen are injured. Proudfoot told Ron that it had enough power to kill half the Great Hall if Malfoy had not reacted in time.
Draco stood and eyed the ring box, "I'll leave that with you."
Harry clung to Draco with shaking hands, allowing the medi-witch to force feed him Pepper Up, followed by Insta-Hydrate and a nutritional potion.
"Harry..."
Harry all but tripped off the stool to pull her into a hug. "I don't say it enough but thank you."
Harry stood when the healer did, he automatically reached for Draco - to comfort, to apologise, to something - but he withdrew his hand and turned to Narcissa instead. He promised to keep Scorpius as long as they needed; he would key them into the wards so they could collect him at any time. Harry returned home, drained and desperate to curl into Ginny's reassuring embrace, only to find Albus and Scorpius sitting in the living room waiting for him.
"One more?" Harry pleads, holding Bill's newest baby in his arms.
Harry shrugged and took another mouthful of ale, "I'm fine, Ron. I need time."
Harry turned to Draco's mother and aunt, "Er, Grimmauld is your family's home, would you like to come stay?" Narcissa looked like she was going to protest again, but Andromeda gripped her hand and turned to Harry, "Thank you Harry, we've been staying in an Order safehouse since before Teddy was born, it would be nice to be somewhere familiar," she looked at Narcissa and smiled, "and with family once more." Draco nodded, "Mother, I think with Harry and Andromeda would be the best place for us." Harry gave Draco a weak smile, and gently squeezed his cousin's foot through the blanket before placing his hand on Draco's lower back. "I'm just going to go see the Weasleys, and then I'd really like some food and sleep. Come with me, Malfoy?" Draco nodded and followed Harry to the flaming haired family, dread in his heart.
Draco picked at some lint on his robes, "Three broken ribs, one broken nose and a severe concussion."
Ron shook his head, "I've never seen you like this, it's like you're a shadow of yourself. I need you around, mate."
Draco looks him over seriously, casting status charms and taking Harry's vital signs.
, before Draco dropped his sleeve. Harry felt a swell of nausea as he made the connection between Hermione's injury from Bellatrix and Malfoy's arm.
"I'm so happy for you, congratulations, Teddy and Victoire," Harry raises his glass to the room.
She releases his wrist and he tumbles into the memory.
"Not a bad life, not bad at all," Draco smiles at the Mediterranean sunset.
Draco flushed pink and his grip tightened on Harry's wrist. "Shut up, Potter. I'll take the night off but don't think I'm dropping this 'Phoenix Team' nonsense."
"Just surprised to see him smile," Harry said the first thing he could come up with. "Never seen it before, so it was surprising"
"Hey," Harry replied in a small voice before shrugging his bag off his shoulder and hanging up his robes on the little hooks Draco had insisted be in the room.
"Shit" Draco mumbled when Harry pressed up against him at a specific angle that caused Draco to hiss. When Harry felt Draco's body stiffen a bit, he quickly captured the other boy's lips and efficiently captured Draco's moans as well. And when Harry pulled Draco's hips down one more time it was over for both of them.
"I understand," Remus said while tugging Sirius closer to him. That's when Harry noticed that Sirius was crying softly.
"Do I want to know what this is about?" Harry asked Hermione who looked a bit frazzled.
"Absolutely"
"Love you," Draco said.
"Remus!" Sirius barked, "Come sniff this boy"
"Draco..." She warned, but Draco was unprepared for her to jump on him and practically rip his shirt off of him.
"Oh, alright then"
"Oh, Merlin! Next, you're going to tell me you're in a relationship with Potter" Draco winced and her mouth went agape, "Holy shit you're dating Harry Potter"
"He's sleeping, so it turned a light purple" Draco supplied, "it's tied to his emotions and behaviors"
"Thank you," Draco mumbled.
"Intriguing"
"Handsome"
"Is this a regular occurrence?"
"Is this about the mark?" Pansy asked. Draco froze, it was definitely not about the mark....but it was an easy out.
"How long have you had these rings on?" Hermione asked.
"Harry..I-" Draco kissed him fiercely, "Need to...I-"
"I'll see you two at dinner," He said before hurrying off to the eighth-year dorms.
"So how does this relate to the rumor?"
"What?" Remus asked.
"I believe you will be just fine, Mr. Potter"
"Tell me"
"Well?" Someone else asked. Harry shrugged and stood up.
"Never do. Just happens"
"It's stupid, don't worry about it" He said in a low voice.
"I can feel his emotions and when he's hurt I can take the pain away" Draco offered and Harry nodded.
"Idiot"
"Then I see no problem. Congratulations Draco. Now tell us about the Godfather ring" Blaise encouraged and Draco couldn't help the ground-breaking smile that erupted before he sprung into Blaise's arms.
"I don't want you to get upset hearing it..." She trailed off.
"Happier than I've ever been," Draco replied honestly.
"You know we don't care" Blaise replied.
Harry opened his eyes and blinked a few times. There was quiet bustling around him, and he could see white surrounding him like a blanket.
"Oi!" Harry yelled across the hall towards the Slytherin table. Now everyone was quiet including the staff table which included Sirius and Remus who were both looking confused. "Malfoy!"
"If It's about me, I ought to know" He turned to Hermione - the reasonable one.
He pushed open the classroom door and all eyes fell on him. There were quite a few raised eyebrows and amused looks. Some people had furrowed brows and a couple of snickers came from both sides of the room. Most of the Gryffindors just looked either confused, concerned, or angry. What the hell did he just walk into?
"Wello to you too, little one" Draco replied with a smile. Harry couldn't help but melt at the sight. Every time those two interacted it made Harry overwhelmed with love. He couldn't wait for Draco and him to have their own little shit shows running around and wreaking havoc.
"I'd say, 'I know, thanks'" Draco replied with a smirk.
"Okay," Draco said with a smile, "Okay"
"Yes," Draco mumbled.
"Very well, off to your potions"
"Pretty Please?" Harry begged.
"Do you have memory loss?"
"Yeah, but I do" Draco replied with a shrug.
"Why yes I did" Harry replied with a lazy smile, "Thanks for asking"
"I'm good" Harry assured him, "Just a little confused about the rumor going around" Draco stilled under Harry who then promptly sat up, straddling Draco's hips and giving him a questioning look, "You wouldn't have anything to do with this little rumor...Would you?"
"Yes, Ron?" Harry asked while turning to the red-haired boy.
"That's long enough for it to recognize your magical signatures and your bond, even without the marriage aspect. It's peculiar that you haven't noticed. Do you two have any other abilities?"
"Almost five years," Draco told them with a smile.
"Of course, love" Harry replied as they split up. Draco turned away while Ron, Hermione, and Harry all turned towards the great hall for an early lunch. Ever since the war, Harry had a tendency to cause hallways to lapse into silence in his presence, but now, nearing the end of his eighth year, it was finally getting better. However, as the trio wandered toward the Great Hall there was the low hum of people falling silent and then whispering.
"Errr....no?"
"You...don't know?"
"'Him?' You're gay!?" Pansy's eyes were wide, and Blaise was just wading in the water with a shocked expression.
"I'll be off then," Harry said with a smile. He stood up and made his way to the door, "Thanks again!" He called out.
"You've been together almost five years!" Pansy is shaking his shoulders, "And I didn't hear about it!?"
"Yeah. Yeah I am"
"Feels' nice" Harry mumbled into Draco's shirt.
"We can talk to each other in our minds," Harry said, "But that was an ancient spell we found"
"You have to answer," Draco said while pulling away a bit. Harry's eyes flickered over Draco's face, noticing the slight insecurity. It was reminiscent of the war. Everyone had scars. Draco was always worried he wasn't deserving of love, and Harry made sure he was reminded every day that he couldn't be loved more.
"In your dreams" He sneered, but it didn't have any venom.
"Do try to not injure yourself"
"Er... you said whoever I chose to be with could be Teddy's godparent," Harry said shyly before tugging the ring out from under Draco's shirt and showing Sirius.
"That's bullshit" Pansy tugged his shirt again and he jumped back more, "What is up with you?" Draco knew Pansy wasn't interested in him, that wasn't the problem. He was not worried about her hands touching him intimately, he was worried about her discovering something very intimate underneath his nice shirt.
"If you don't mind, I'd prefer if you continued this another time. Maybe not when everyone is supposed to be eating dinner?" Minerva pointedly looked at them and then flickered her eyes towards the shocked room.
"You're serious about him?" Pansy asked quietly.
"Sorry mate, but that didn't clear anything up," Neville said with a laugh, "Think that just made me more confused"
"Anything that ties you two together that isn't normal?"
"I'm not a girl"
"What?" Harry asked at the same time Draco asked.
"And he treats you well?"
"Because you, Mr. Malfoy were the one to tell me Mr. Potter was in the hospital wing, and then Potter came in here with the same story"
* * * * *
At the end of potions class, Harry knew something was amiss. Draco hadn't said much, and every time he looked over at Harry his cheeks tinted ever-so-slightly. On top of that, the whole room was gossipy and Harry wasn't being passed any of it. Finally, while putting the last ingredient in the potions and stirring it clockwise seven times, Harry decided to ask Draco.
"You're soulmates!?" Hermione yelled from behind them.
"I Love you too" Harry mumbled back before kissing him again. And Again. And Again, until Draco was tugging Harry's shirt off and then pulling his own soft gray shirt off in one swift motion. Harry took a second to pull away from the kiss and admire Draco. The little bite marks and hickeys were still very prominent on his lover's chest and he wouldn't have it any other way. He took note of every unmarked skin and vowed that by the end of the night, Draco wouldn't have a sliver of his chest not covered in the beautiful marks.
Draco almost expected Harry to be mad, but he just laughed and then pressed his lips to Draco's. Draco greedily reciprocated the kiss, pushing forward and deepening it almost immediately. Draco pulled barely away - lips still slightly connected and whispered, "I Love you so much"
"When did I say that?"
"Pretty" Draco retorted.
"Yes Professor" They all chorused before packing up their stuff and heading into the hall.
"Thank you," Draco replied before grabbing Harry and tugging him out the door, ignoring all the disappointed looks from their fellow students. Everyone wanted to ask them a million questions, but Draco couldn't care less. He had other things he needed to attend to.
"Potter!" Snape called from the front of the room.
"Love you too, you prat. Now tell us who the hell your Godson is"
"Teddy," He said with a smile, "Sirius and Remus' kid. They both had to go into hiding during the last bits of the war and so Harry took care of Teddy for a while" Draco laughs nervously and rubs the back of his neck, "Technically Sirius and Remus don't know that Harry made me a godfather, but in all fairness they did tell him that whoever he decided to be with would be welcome to be a godparent with him, so that means me"
"Mmm" Harry hummed in reply and Draco just huffed before threading his fingers into Harry's raven-toned hair. Draco put both his hands into the boy's hair and began massaging his head causing Harry to shiver and tighten his grip around the blonde boy.
"I'm not your pet" Remus shot back but still stood up and walked over to Harry - unable to say no to Sirius. "Sorry Harry," Remus said and Harry only laughed and waved him off.
Poppy pursed her lips, "Perhaps a social call may be more enjoyable for the both of us, then. I don't need people trying to kill themselves every time they want to chat with me"
"I'm not"
"Love you too"
"You know? I'm good right here, thanks" He replied while laying back and enjoying the sunshine.
"Are you feeling okay?" Draco tugged Harry's hair so he could better look at his boyfriend. Harry's eyes were half-closed and tired but he was smiling and pressing his nose into Draco's neck.
When they got to their shared dorm, Draco waved his wand and their beds merged into a king-sized bed and he cast a variety of different silencing and locking spells before tossing his wand to the side of the room and grabbing Harry's jeans - guiding him towards the bed.
"What did I do this time?" He asked in a gravelly voice. She thrust a glass of water into his hands and he took a tentative sip.
"Oh, Harry" He moved forward and held the ring. It was a beautiful little ring and the stone was charmed to change to correlate with whatever Teddy's moods were. It took a long time, and a lot of energy but they finally got the spell right and it couldn't be more perfect. The stone changed from a golden color to a lavender, and Sirius raised an eyebrow.
The magic hummed in beautiful harmony and the two boys intertwined their hands and the rings connected. They continued kissing languidly as the dragon flew around their hands and around them before settling in their hearts. Draco could feel the thrumming of Harry's heart now as if it were his own, and Harry could feel the love and happiness coming off of Draco in waves. It was as overwhelming as it was comforting.
"Yes," He mumbled again. It seemed to be the only word he could come up with.
"And we can push emotions to each other as well" Harry added and just as a little demonstration he sent a flood of love towards Draco who shivered at the feeling before lapsing into a crooked smile.
Pansy noticed the rings first and gasped.
"Yes, Mr. Malfoy?"
"Both of you gave me the same story - one that neither Granger, Weasley nor other Gryffindors were able to give - and that is not something that happens often, or at all"
* * * * *
"Okay...?"
"You're a good man"
"Now I can't get upset because Teddy clearly likes him" Sirius shook his head and watched as Draco shifted the boy onto his back so he could give him a piggyback ride. Teddy settled right in and promptly fell asleep on his back as if this was a normal occurrence. "How...?"
"Hey," Draco said in a soft and lazy voice. He looked up from his book and smiled slightly at Harry.
"Soppy"
"Like you want to snog-" Pause for Ron to gag, "-him"
"Prat"
"C'mon" Pansy came over to Draco and tugged on his shirt, but he swatted her hands away and tugged the shirt down in an attempt to keep it on, "Draco, I know you hate wearing clothes in water, take your shirt and pants off, it's not like we haven't seen you in your underwear before"
"We wanted to keep it hidden, it wasn't safe for him-" Draco began.
"As long as you're happy" He replied. Draco pulled back and attempted to straighten himself back out, but it didn't work because he was blushing profusely and his whole chest looked like someone beat him up.
Draco reached out and tugged on the chain around Harry's neck. Their rings matched except for one exception. Both rings were a little silver snake that was biting its tail to create a circle, with a little emerald on the eye. Silver and Green. Slytherin colors. However, when they moved close enough, Harry's ring lit up a beautiful silver while Draco's ring glowed a fiery red. When they touched, the colors combined, and a little silver and maroon dragon danced between them. Magic was a wonderful thing.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy" Harry began. He held Draco's face between his hands and looked intensely into his eyes, "I love you so much it physically hurts me. I want to be with you for the rest of my life, and I would love to marry you"
"I'll be checking that with Poppy," He said curtly.
"You are out of your mind," She told him sincerely, "But you're happy" He looked up hopefully and she continued, "And if you're happy, who am I to judge?"
"Fine" Blasie said before splashing Pansy, "Suit yourself"
"You grew up with the wizarding world and you didn't realize?" Hermione was now standing next to them and looking curiously at the little dragon. It almost had a Patronus look to it.
"Since fourth-year" He mumbled with his eyes squeezed shut.
He looked up when there was no noise still. He turned to Ron in question and he just furrowed his eyebrows.
"Yeah yeah, whatever. You win" Harry resigned and Draco smiled, like a true smile which made Harry tilt his head and admire it.
"Yes sir" Harry replied before turning to Draco to see a confused expression and a slight blush on his cheeks. Draco then raised his hand which confused Harry to an extreme.
A few snickers went around the room and when Harry turned to Draco he could see the boy hiding in his laughter.
"Draco!" Harry snapped, "What on Earth did you tell the fools of this school?"
"I don't want to" He huffed, backing away from Pansy's curious hands.
"You're happy?" Blaise finally spoke up.
"I wonder if it worked purely because of your bond?" Hermione was in full-on curiosity and learning mode. "Anything else?"
"I sorta slipped up because of how excited I was to be able to talk about us, so I said something about dating you while some Ravenclaw was around, and then they went and told someone else, and then they told someone else, and then boom the whole school thinks we are dating. Though, no one is really sure if it's true or not"
going to be in Ronald's bedroom - or the Burrow for that matter."
"Sorry, it took a little effort to find it!" Andromeda took a seat next to Rose and looked at Narcissa expectantly.
"No permanent damage, Mr. Malfoy. You were quite lucky, the barb shot straight through your back before it could pump the venom sac. You can go home today," Healer Gurjeet gave him a weary smile.
Harry didn't think anyone had noticed but himself, but he caught Scorpius' eye and suppressed a laugh when Scorpius winked at him. Harry was making a note to speak to Scorpius about it when an owl landed in the tureen of peas, upending it over the table and greatly disturbing Minty, who hated peas with a passion.
"Oh," Harry had nothing to say to that logic.
"What? Finally!" Charlie immediately leapt up and yelled out, "Phoenix Team! Assemble!"
Sixteen Aurors fall over themselves to try and locate their missing captain. Voices are yelling confused directions, Unspeakables have Trace magic racing over the country.
Hermione turned to Kingsley, "Sir, what is going on?" Kingsley cast a cautious glance at Harry before fixing Hermione with a knowing look, "We were attempting to take Voldemort's soldiers into custody to await justice-" Harry hissed in response to his words, "but Harry feels that Mr. Malfoy and Mrs. Malfoy should not be included in the arrests." Hermione turned back to Harry and then considered the two figures behind him. Hermione knew it would be easy to be angry at them and blame them for the evils she had experienced in their home, but the pleading in Harry's eyes gave her resolve to speak with forgiveness.
"I'm not swapping beds, you shouldn't have to sleep in my sweaty sheets," Harry raised a brow, amused.
"Salud, mi familia," Ginny cheers, looking to her husband Blaise for confirmation that she'd pronounced it right.
The living room Floo shone violently green, Hermione and Pansy stepped through into the room and looked at Harry warily.
"I didn't want to try this, but I have no choice," Healer Gurjeet's voice was urgent now.
"Fuck me, I'd like to do that again." Harry sighed against Draco's mouth, reclaiming it once more.
Molly's face softened, "You really don't recall any of it?"
Harry pulls out of the memory, having seen enough to know the horrific thing he's done.
Harry's body jumped again, Draco's heart was racing and his lungs failed to expand.
Hermione raised her head slightly, "Is he awake?"
"I just... Can I fix anything? With anyone?" Harry looked into the faces of the two people who had always been on his side.
Draco stepped into the entry hall at Grimmauld Place and instantly thought he had arrived to the wrong house. It was all light wood and bright fixtures. He immediately slammed into the back of Harry, who had stopped to gape at his hallway. "So, I take it your reaction means you weren't expecting this either?" Harry drifted through the doors to his left, Draco followed him into a wonderfully warm sitting room, complete with a wall of books and a fireplace. "Wow, er, Kreacher?" Kreacher appeared beside them with a crack, "Yes, Master Harry?" Harry looked at Kreacher like he was unsure how to word his feelings, and promptly dropped to his knees and hugged the ancient Elf tightly, "Thank you, I can't believe you did all of this."
Harry Potter grinned at Kingsley Shacklebolt as he accepted his stripes, marking him as a fully qualified Auror. Draco Malfoy, Harry's unlikely training partner, clapped politely for his colleague. Ron Weasley and Seamus Finnegan showed no restraint and whooped loudly from their seats in the civilian section.
Draco stared at Harry as if he was an imbecile and tugged on his wrist, leading Harry over to his bed. Draco pulled back the covers with one hand, climbed into the bed and yanked Harry until he fell into the bed after him.
Draco was nervous about coming back to Hogwarts. He knew he had Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny, Luna, Pansy and Blaise who would support him, but he had done a lot of damage to the safety of the school. McGonagall had allowed him to return under the provision that he helped Madam Pomfrey by brewing potions for the Hospital Wing. He felt that it was barely a punishment, between his potions work for George and Madam Pomfrey, he was set on what he wanted his future occupation to be.
"In Florida?" Teddy lit up.
"I'm asking Hermione to marry me, you promise you'll be my best man? I can't do it without you standing up with us, it's always been us, mate," tears were dripping down Ron's long nose.
"'Mione says it was obvious - 'at least to anyone with bloody eyes, Harry!'" Harry mimics.
"No changes?" she asked, smiling kindly at him.

"That I'll never be able to walk through that office again without wondering if I'd done something different, would Gin would still be here? You're right, as usual." Harry felt his throat close up and the tears threaten to return.
Hermione had been awoken from her light doze by a slamming door. Looking up she saw Harry throw himself on Draco and then kiss him. "Fuck me,
"Not much to look at, is it," Draco gave her a weary smile which she responded to with a tut.
"On the 2nd March 2000, Trainee Aurors Harry Potter and Susan Bones entered the Duffield Mansion to help with clean up of a crime scene. The place had been used by smugglers of dangerous Dark artefacts. Trainee Auror Potter cast a detection charm on a cupboard which showed no danger. He opened the cupboard at the direction of his training officer, Senior Auror John Dawlish. Trainee Auror Potter overestimated the strength used and pulled the cabinet onto himself. It is estimated the cabinet did minimal damage to the Auror, aside from six cracked ribs, however serious curse damage was done by an Australian fire opal with some type of memory curse which resulted in Trainee Auror Potter losing all memories of his life thus far. Trainee Auror Potter was admitted to St. Mungo's at 09:47 in the morning and was pronounced stable with retrograde amnesia with no hope for recovery," Draco read from a file in front of him, "Of course, we'll have to amend the prognosis. What time did you wake up this morning?"
Kreacher looked astounded at Harry's lack of manners and pulled back into a bow, "Master Harry, Kreacher is living to serve the Noble House of Black. Master Regulus always wished for more books so Kreacher was honouring him, just as Master Harry is being telling Kreacher." Harry smiled at Kreacher, "Yes, I'm so happy you have honoured Regulus, I hope you will do me the favour of taking his old room for yourself? Draco and I don't want to sleep in his or Sirius' rooms." Kreacher scrunched his face up in a horrible expression of grief and began wailing, "Oh, Master Harry, you is being improper, Kreacher cannot be having a room which belonged to Master Regulus!"
"You're so thin, are you eating? Are you drinking enough water? When was the last time you properly slept?" Molly pressed her hand against his forehead, checking for fever, before brushing her fingers through the limp hair hanging in his face.
"I imagine no one is stupid enough to do it more than once," Draco's voice is acidic behind him.
Andromeda and Narcissa were already sitting together, baby Teddy in an antique looking bassinet which was rocking itself slowly beside Narcissa. "Kreacher is being hopeful the young Masters found their rooms. Kreacher is thinking that the attic might be being welcome to Master Harry after living outside, Master Harry might be missing the openness of the sky." Harry smiled wearily at Kreacher and nodded his thanks. Draco added, "It is wonderful what you've done with the house Kreacher, it feels most befitting a Noble and Ancient family such as the Blacks." Kreacher's face shone with pride as he started to serve soup to the table, small loaves of bread at each place with large pats of butter in a dish.
Hermione was drying him off and Ron was fetching Harry a drink when Minty toddled over to cling at Harry's leg. "Daddy, where's Nana and Papa?"
"So, er. You know what that is. I, er, I really like you. Well, I guess that's not correct. I mean - I love you. I've loved you for more than a year now and I know this is shit timing because you're with Celia and you seem really happy but I want to court you. Actually, I want to marry you and forgo all the dating but I think that would be a bit soon and er, Draco?" Harry breathed in deeply and regretted it, the winter air biting his lungs.
I should be happy, now. I should have a girlfriend and should be having fun. Why can't I stop feeling hunted? I probably deserve to feel sad, it's my fault they're all dead anyway. I wonder if Malfoy feels like this, like he's not allowed to be grateful or sad or happy or anything because we shouldn't have survived the war at all.
" Luna cleared up the mess.
"I've loved you from the moment you beat me to the nursery to soothe Araminta in the middle of the night." Draco's words shook Harry to his core and made him question the last three years.
Harry felt embarrassed, he was covered in filth and Draco was treating him like a small child. He tried to push Draco's hands away and Draco looked up at him, grey eyes meeting green. "Harry, let me look after you. You're exhausted." Harry bit his lip, nodding, feeling his cheeks colour at the smile Draco gave in response. Shoes and socks removed, Draco moved to help Harry with his shirt and trousers before turning and fiddling with the taps. Draco ran a pearly pink bath for Harry, the water giving off little wisps of rose coloured steam. "It's a healing bath, it'll calm you and relax your muscles and help heal the cuts." Draco turned away while Harry shucked his pants before stepping into the wonderfully hot water.
"I think you ought to rest, don't you? You've been here long enough," she looked concerned.
Ginny didn't question why her husband was suddenly home on a Wednesday afternoon, she simply drew Scorpius into her side and whisked him upstairs to Albus. Harry had paced for a few minutes, carding his hands through his hair before Ginny sighed and told him to check up on Scorpius' family before he wore a hole in their carpet. He Apparated into Hermione's old office at St. Mungo's (and apologised to the terrified Mind Healer and her client using the room) before demanding a passing Mediwitch to give him the Malfoy family's location.
"I have to know, Luna. Please," Harry is on his knees and begging.
"All of it. Me being awful about you being an orphan, me being awful about the Weasley family," Draco sighed, "Here I am, an orphan on Christmas, welcomed with open arms by the Weasley family for dinner."
"I've lived here for two years, bugger off!" The witch slammed the door in his face.
"Are you two still bickering over who loves who more?" Dean Thomas had accepted his stripes and plonked down next to Harry.

"Thank you for giving me this amazing man," Taylah whispers back.
Hermione appeared in his Floo, her face creased with worry, "Harry, you've been sleeping - ever since..." Harry sighed, his old Floo had been dropping out lately.
." Harry looked to Draco, confused as his father's corpse disappeared. Kingsley spoke up, "May his soul know peace," before quietly telling Harry, "she has returned him to his family crypt."
Harry wipes his tears on the back of his hand and sits up. The tall blonde man in the doorway is his Draco - but it isn't his Draco at all. This man has his hair cut in a neat fashion, short back and sides with the top combed over so it falls in a soft wave across his forehead. The narrow half-moon spectacles perching on his nose are new, as are the lime green robes of a full Healer - not the washed out aqua of a trainee.
"Third chance," Harry agrees.
"Andromeda is bringing Teddy to Christmas dinner," Molly informed them on Christmas Eve, "And her nephew, as he's not anywhere else to spend it."
Harry looked at the Chudley Cannon's blanket tucked around his feet, "Is Ron really proposing to Hermione?"
"Hot date, mate?" Harry laughed.
"S'fine," Harry muttered.
"What's in it?" Harry stared down at the soft golden liquid.
"If you don't wish for me to get fired for hexing you senseless, you'll leave," Susan storms away from him.
Harry thanked them again and exited from via the Floo. He sunk to his knees when arriving at Grimmauld, his chest bursting with pain and grief.
"There's been no change," the healer was disheartened, Draco could hear it.
Draco was Harry's medical proxy, all non-standard treatment had to be approved by him, "Go on."
"Very well," Luna started to write, "I will owl you when I know more."
"You're beautiful," Parvati kissed Lavender's scarred cheek, "You're strong."
"Clear the area," the healer said before placing them to Harry's skin, "Shock!"
"Get out, get out of my house. I remember nothing about you, I remember being with Draco and being cursed and now I have no idea what happened for the last five years," Harry's throat was dry, "Please, I don't know you, could you just get out?"
He said as much, announced it into the stale air of the kitchen. Harry and Hermione both turned wide eyes on him. Hermione immediately started protesting.
“Right here mate” Ron groaned from the other bed, and Harry could see a tuft of curly brown hair poking out of his duvet.
“Blaise sounds like Ron, only worse. I think that if I had ended up with you, Ron may have done something similar. Insecurities lead to ugly actions, even from good people.” Hermione says at last.
He took the plates and cutlery over to the sink before handing a tea towel to Malfoy. “I’ll wash, you dry?” he asked. “I do it the muggle way because I find it’s a nice way to wind down, and it’s what I’m used to” he explained, filling the sink with warm water and soap. The two worked in companiable silence before Draco coughed awkwardly and said, “you’ve changed so much. You’re a war hero, but he you are, living like a single dad and you’ve only just turned eighteen.” Harry smiled. “we’ve all changed, Draco, and I love Teddy and I love being able to fulfil the father part of godfather. It’s all I had hoped for when I was a kid” Harry explained.
Still though, little could dim Pansy’s excitement, and he humoured her as they walked.
The minute he was safely back in his room, the adrenaline left him completely and abruptly, and he leant heavily against the door.
“You were WHAT?” I shriek at him and he scrambles back, falling on his arse.
“Yes Ronald, but you have the emotional capacity of a teaspoon.” Hermione replied, flicking him on the nose.
When that made him feel too pathetic, he instead turned his mind to writing the postcard for his mother. Purposefully only his mum and not his Father, who Draco took every opportunity to undermine, such as pretending he didn't exist.
“She sounds like ‘mione. ‘Mione always gives t’best advice,”Harry said, still smiling at Draco, which caused Draco’s stomach to wobble a little more.
A hush fell over the crowd as the two teams made their way onto the pitch, and Draco got sucked into the drama of the game (watching Harry run and tackle and run some more) and before he knew it, Hogwarts had won. Yet another win in an inexhaustible list of the undefeatable school. Everyone there for Hogwarts students cheered and shouted, and some over-excited dads (and Ginny) ran out onto the pitch to congratulate their sons (and brothers). It was sweet to see the happiness brought on by victory, and Draco supposed he was starting to understand why everyone at his school was so obsessed. He still adamantly maintained that he should have been at the top of the pecking order. The rugby boys (bar Harry, of course) may have been successful Neanderthals, but they were Neanderthals nonetheless.
Blaise slithered off Harry, going to lie across Pansy on the other sofa instead.
“Is that him?” Pansy whispered in Draco’s ear. Draco grinned and nodded as he walked over to open the door for Harry.
To his eternal gratitude, he wasn't awoken the next morning until breakfast time, at about nine, meaning he had a chance to sleep off the cider. Breakfast consisted of eggs, bread, beans and mushrooms. Almost a full english.
… and ran straight into Harry in his haste to leave the farm house.
“you’re lying” I croak. “they might be okay with me being your friend, but not your boyfriend. No one forgets the past that easily.”
“Fuck you, Harry” Draco heard Ginny say, tears evident in the thickness of her voice. She sounded so upset he couldn't even feel happy that Harry hadn’t wanted her, especially because he knew there was no way Harry would ever want him. He stepped out of the shower and towelled off, shimmying into a clean pair of Ginny’s cargo trousers and a t-shirt that he had stolen from a friend at school. Jamming his feet into his walking boots but not arsed to lace them up, he traipsed across the lawn to the big house.
He stumbled into his clothes he had laid out the night before, eschewing his trainers for a pair of brand new shiny walking boots his mother had insisted he buy, with all the latest mod-cons of hiking.
“oui, bien sur, je suis desolee” Potter responds in an upsettingly good French accent. Rugby boys weren’t supposed to be good at things like French. This was Draco’s domain, where he reigned.
“You- you’re not Draco” he said, slurring.
Today of all days, see how the most dangerous thing is to love
“I know, I just, I can't help but feel like I'm not enough.” Draco said quietly, aware he was putting even more emotional stress on Harry and resenting it.
“you better not step on my toes in those” grumbled Harry, coming up behind Draco and wrapping his arms around him, resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder, even though he had to bend slightly to do so. “I don’t want broken toes”
They were half way through their powerpoint, writing about how France’s immigrant population increased massively after the war due to France bringing in men from the overseas colonies to make up for lost manpower when Harry’s phone rang.
“aw dray you’ve gone bright red”
“I’m sorry” he whispered into the darkness, desperately hoping it was enough.
(See the end of the chapter for
Never mind that they almost always got bollocked for stealing the expensive stuff from their parents, or that at the start none of them had actually liked the taste of wine. It had made them feel rich and important and grown up, and as fifteen-year-old trust fund brats, those were the three most important feelings in the world.
“Awfully sorry, Peterson. We must be going. Have a good remainder of your night” Harry says stiffly, and immediately begins pulling me away, out of the hall, away from the ball and down the two flights of stairs to the auror department. He pulls me into his office and I flop into his chair.
“thanks, love” Draco replies, kissing Harry on the cheek and going up to shower.
Harry awoke to the sound of Teddy crying, and rolled out of bed to run to his godson. In his haste, he forgot about his guests and so was only in his sleeping shorts. He carried Teddy downstairs and fed him his milk and some banana slices for breakfast. After a late night and rude awakening, he was exhausted, and was so focussed on trying to make sure the banana went into Teddy’s mouth and not on the floor he didn’t hear the footsteps behind him.
“Sorry to bother you, I was just hoping you could help me with the French homework.” Draco said, looking everywhere but where Harry was leaning against the doorjamb, exuding a confidence and ease that Draco had never quite been able to master. He was confident, sure, but that came more from his expensive clothes and posturing than it being from him the way Harry was in simple sports shorts and a t-shirt but had the air of a god.
“I can’t say I’m a fan of that, to be honest. Can’t bear anything involving the destruction of the family unit” Harry says.
One thing led to another, and we got together. It was weird. He was older, and when you’re sixteen and in your first relationship with a man, that year difference feels so much more significant, and he lorded it over me a lot, made me feel inadequate. We dated for five months, and the week before our six-month anniversary, he told me he ‘wasn’t looking for anything serious’ which was bullshit, because six months is pretty bloody serious at our age, quite honestly.
“they’re baby jabberwockies” she said when she noticed Draco staring at the creatures that wriggled across her pyjamas. “aren’t those from a muggle poem?” Harry asked, already making space for the girl in his bed. Draco felt a pang in his chest at the knowledge that the three of them would be in one bed, and he would be alone.
Harry couldn’t make out the words, but he could feel the anger and sadness in them and he hated that. He knew it was because they loved him, but he hated to think that anyone else would ever be affected by his upbringing. The pain it caused him was enough.
“simnel cake. It’s Easter tradition” Harry says, handing Draco a marzipan chick to snack on. Draco breaks off the head and gives it to Teddy, who grabs it in a chubby hand and drools all over it. Though Teddy is oblivious to it, the air between them is fraught, tense. Harry almost feels like they’re back at square one, the distance between them now feeling as wide as it did at Hogwarts.
Draco’s stomach lurched as the tractor pitched and rolled over the pot-holed and uneven country roads. It was a hair-raising ride and Draco was more than glad when the tractor stopped in front of a farm house even more dilapidated and run down than Harry’s. It looked to be falling down, and Draco worried for the safety of its occupants.
“And remember, you can go whenever. I had a friend who went to uni aged twenty six. There’s no age limit on these things” Sirius reminded him, reaching for another scone.
Draco leaned over the balcony, watching the almost angelic scene beneath him; the two women cuddled up to Harry, who sat in the middle, watching the fire and singing some of the most beautiful words Draco had ever heard. Loathe to interrupt, he walked slowly down the stairs and made himself a cup of tea- his preferred way to start the day. He walked past the trio on his way back to his room, but Luna reached a nymph-like arm out and pulled him down gently to sit on the sofa by her feet. His heart constricted at the kindness of the gesture, especially after Luna’s ordeal at the Manor, but she said she had forgiven him last night, and here she was proving that her words rang true. He absentmindedly rubbed at the forearm where the faded mark lay, heart aching at the pureness that remained in Hogwarts, despite Voldemort’s (and his, he supposed- he had let the Car rows in, after all) best efforts to corrupt the school to its core.
“Yeah, our house is in Wiltshire, about half an hour drive from the school.” Draco replied, unsure of where this was going.
Draco was somewhat saved at this point because Pansy and Potter returned.
“it’s Cedric” Harry said, looking at his hands.
God, Harry’s voice sounded sexy like that. All gravelly and even deeper than normal. Draco nearly swooned.
He enters Draco’s room to see him lying on the bed.
Draco came downstairs the next morning to see three Gryffindors sitting only in t shirts and underwear at the table, ravenously digging into a full English. He was suddenly struck by how young and boyish Harry looked when he wasn’t looking after Teddy. It was, attractive, Draco had to admit. As was the small golden hoop earring glinting in his ear, which certainly hadn’t been there the day before. In fact that was more than just attractive, it was hot. ‘be calm my raging libido, he hates me right now’ thought Draco to himself, before helping himself to bacon and plopping down at the table.  The three collectively groan at the sound, and he laughs at the teenage-ness of it all. He feels young and free for the first time in a long time. He considers that Dean and Seamus must have slept at Grimmauld in a spare room, as the double bed was no longer in the nursery, having been transfigured back to its original state.
The first week of the half term passed uneventfully. Draco did all his schoolwork so it wouldn’t be a mad Sunday-night rush.
It hurt to be reminded of that connection.
“Draco, remember that day at Hogwarts when I asked you a question and then you told me I wouldn’t like the answer?” I nod, still to hurt to look at him.
“god Malfoy how much did you drink?” asked Harry, slightly worried when Draco was still being sick thirty minutes later. It was then that he heard the loud shouts from downstairs
Draco asks Harry to meet again that week. Harry cannot wait to go to Draco’s house. After the cupboard at the Dursley’s, he thought Sirius’ townhouse was big, but it was a cottage in comparison to where Draco lives. Harry desperately wants to explore it.
Soon enough, the funeral party filed out of the church, their collective breath fog in the crisp, cold January air. Like a school of sombre fish, they gathered around at the grave side, and Dudley, as well as some other men Harry didn’t recognise, came out bearing the coffin.
“I’m torn between Luna and Ginny” said Harry and Draco nearly groaned. Luna was a new name. How many girls were in Harry’s life?
Draco just nodded, grinning at Harry who had sighed, rolled his eyes and said “let's get you some air” before manhandling Draco out of the room, down the hall and out into the small courtyard in front of the building.
You don’t have to be beautiful, to turn me on
Harry laughed. “it’s not so bad mate” he said, patting Ron on the shoulder.
”. He laughed even harder at her indignant huff behind him.
Theo said imperiously, before reaching into his bag and withdrawing a bottle of Glenfiddich that Draco knew to cost upwards of £400. At least he would be getting drunk on the best money could buy. Of course, as Lucius would say, and Malfoy should do nothing less.
“Go away, Bryn” Draco heard Ron say, voice low and menacing. The lanky boy- Bryn- tightened his grip on Harry’s arm and turned his saccharine sweet smile to Ron.
Oh, but she burns like rum on a fire
“Where are Ron and ‘Mione?”
Draco woke up to the worst headache he had ever had. He immediately knew he was better off than Theo, because he had been woken up by the sounds of violent vomiting coming from their bathroom. Draco groaned as he tried to sit up, and saw that he was still in his clothes from the night before. Those wrinkles would be a nightmare to get out. The whole outfit would have to go to the dry cleaners. What a start to a Sunday.
Her brows pinched together and Draco knew if she could, she would’ve been pacing the room.
“Thanks for helping me, you’re a much better teacher than Snape ever was.” Draco felt a pang of guilt at that. He never liked going behind Severus’s back.
Hello! So I was super bored over the summer and I never have time to write fanfiction once school picks up, and I decided to try and write one now. Because why not. I like drarry, I like fanfiction. Anyway I wrote this thing. And it's like 7 or 8 chapters long. I don't want to give too much away but I don't really know how to describe this. I mean there's drarry? And love? And letters that Draco writes? Lemme try again.
Hermione gave Harry a look. “She’s right, you know, I think they deserve to know.”
“I’m shite at Occlumency, they’ll find out soon enough.” About them. Everything they had done in the past year. No, not in the past year. In the past five. Draco shook his head.
“It’s too bad you can’t go with Harry though. Perhaps you could ask him for a dance at the ball?”
I should feel triumphant. I bested the golden trio after all. Except I don’t. There is a weight on my chest that I don’t know how to explain. Though I’m sure father would be bloody thrilled. I insulted Granger in front of the Quidditch team and made a fool of the blood traitor. I should probably stop writing these letters. They seem to be messing with my head.
“I-I didn’t know how he felt now.” he finally said.
Dear Harry,
Harry’s face broke into a grin. “Brilliant, thank you.”
“They’re going to be here any second.” He said thickly, doing his best to ignore the tightening and swirling of his stomach.
“Alright! What is it you aren’t telling us?” She demanded, glaring at them angrily. Draco was glad he wasn’t on the receiving end of her anger.
“Stop this immediately.” Draco felt as if he had been punched in the stomach. Stop. This. Immediately. But it had not even begun.
“Yes! Yes, he was talking about you. That’s what I just said.” She groaned. “Come onnnnn. What’s the worst that can happen?”
“Draco!” A quiet voice hissed. Draco jumped and nearly slammed his head against the wall.
Draco was sitting in the kitchen very early one morning, drinking coffee that Hermione had taught him how to make, when he heard a frantic knock at the door. Immediately he stiffened, and placed his cup of coffee down on the counter. Slowly he drew his wand from his pocket and crept towards the front door.
“Someone…”
She didn’t speak for a few moments, her brows were furrowed and he could tell she was thinking hard about something.
“Yes.” He replied flatly, not even bothering to look at the man. Flashes of anger had risen inside him, and he wasn’t quite sure why. Severus was only trying to help. At least he hoped he was trying to help.
“I can’t. It needs to stay where it is. Can’t you just tell me how to do it?” he asked, his eyes flickering briefly to the shadows.
Sincerely,
Draco Malfoy your “worst enemy”
I despise my Aunt Bellatrix. She’s insufferable and extremely weird. She keeps sending me letters and I want her to stop. Apparently now she’s staying with mum and father is off doing the dark lord’s bidding or something. She keeps saying she can get me in with the dark lord but I don’t want that. I don’t want to be “in” with the dark lord. She’s mad. Absolutely mad. I have a stack of letters from her now and they don’t burn. I can’t burn them. I tried tossing them out the window but they keep coming back. Potter I’m probably going to see her this summer. And I will probably have to see the dark lord. I don’t want to see either of them. I don’t want to be a death eater. I want to have my own free will and do what I want. I know as soon as the dark lord meets me that’s it. That’s the end of my freedom, of everything. I don't know what to do. Severus has been helping me with Occlumency, and that’s good. I guess. Now though the dark lord crowds my thoughts even more than you do. Which is certainly saying something. Anyway I would really like to kiss you again but you barely even look at me anymore. And that really fucking hurts Potter. I feel trapped. I wish this wasn’t my life.
“It’s me.” Croaked Hermione’s voice from outside the door. His first instinct was to fling open the door and make sure she was alright, but he held himself back.
“My newspaper.” He held out a hand for it.
“Was, Malfoy.” Spat Weasley. He opened his mouth and raised his wand, he was going to curse Draco. Shit, shit. Think of a spell, you’re not this stupid come on.
“Yes. I have to do something, you can’t stop me.” Both of them knew very well that was not true. Draco had never worked well under pressure or spontaneously.
Sincerely,
“Over here alright?” Harry asked, pointing at an empty table near a window. Outside rain had started to fall lightly. Draco had always enjoyed watching the rain from inside.
“Detention! Both of you! And I’m giving both of you a quidditch ban for life!” Draco actually felt a little bit lighter after those words. He wouldn’t have to pretend to like quidditch anymore. Then he looked at Potter’s face and he didn’t feel so good anymore. Potter looked completely devastated. He wanted to tell them that it was just a dumb sport on a broom but he had a sinking feeling that would be no help at all. He had never been very good at comforting people.
“Well what would you have us do?”
“Quite.” Draco shook his head. What exactly did his father want him to do? Egg Potter on? For some reason he didn’t particularly want to use this information against Potter. However a few days later it became apparent that he would have to. He received two more letters from Lucius, both telling him different ways in which he would present this information to Potter. So, he supposed the only thing he could do was pick a fight with Potter and...hint at some information? This was going to go brilliant. The perfect opportunity came in potions the next day. Draco ended up working with both Potter and the Weasel, and Finnigan brought up the subject of none other than Sirius Black. Draco’s ears perked up at the mention of his name. Aha, this was his chance. He was about to open his mouth to say something ambiguous about revenge when he felt Potter’s hand brush against his as he reached for the caterpillars.
“I’m sorry?” he looked back at her, tearing his gaze away from Harry.
You are the bloodiest Gryffindor in the history of Gryffindors. Of course you have taken it upon yourself to save the Weasley girl. Of course you couldn’t leave it to the adults for once in your life. I will not waste my time worrying this time. There’s probably nothing down there in the Chamber. I have no idea how Ginerva got down there but it wasn’t anything to do with Salazar Slytherin. It wasn’t. You’re going to come back. You’re going to come back in a few days and we’ll end up screaming at each other on the train back home. In a few hours everything will be fine again and you will be back safe. Not that you’re not safe right now. I’m sure you’re having a perfectly fine time with the Weasleys down there. You’re perfectly fine and I’m sure by the time I’m done writing this letter you will be back. And probably awarded hundreds of house points for some bullshit you did down in the chamber. Anyway, you make my life miserable. There are so many ways I could be spending my time and yet the only thing I can seem to do is worry. So, screw you Potter. I hate you.
“You can’t simply wander around all night without any sort of plan in mind. Now if you would tell me what you were supposed to be doing maybe then-”
Ginny took another loud slurp and glared at him. “That’s what I just said.”
Sincerely,
“It’s too late for that!” Draco said, not bothering to keep the annoyance out of his voice.
“Er…” Harry took a long breath and brought his eyes up to meet his. “What do you think about…” He trailed off, eyes darting away again. The suspense was practically killing him.
“Oh are you talking about sex? Obviously I know all about that.” Draco shook his head at Severus’ silliness.
She opened and closed her mouth a couple seconds before responding. “Don’t listen to Ron, he’s just being stupid.” She huffed an angry breath. “As usual.”
Your worst enemy who is very concerned about your well being
“Cedric Diggory was not killed!” Umbridge’s voice was high, and she almost sounded scared. “His death was merely a tragic accident, you’re just innocent children who know nothing of the real-”
“A head start on things!” Ginny said in outrage, burying her face in her hands. “Hermione, no! You know we have to stick together, it’s dangerous out there. And you’re not going to do anyone any good if you get yourself killed!”
Harry closed his eyes and breathed deeply. Draco resisted the urge to sigh loudly.
“You’re going to need to put some of your blood on the house, and after that say your name. If I’m correct, which I don’t mean to sound conceited but I know I am, the wards should fall for a couple seconds. Then you can go in. Once you’re inside you can bring them down permanently since the house will have recognised you. You can get the potions, and then get Harry and you should be able to apparate right back. I think.”
“You can’t say anything, you know it’s true. Back and forth for five years and finally-” She rolled her eyes. “Finally you got together. I always knew it would happen.”
“Who?” Theo wiped at his eyes as his voice cracked. Draco twisted his hands together, desperately trying to find the right words.
Ginny came stumbling down the stairs, rubbing at her eyes.
“Bloody hell mate, mum thought we’d lost you.”
Draco swallowed, he could feel his heart pounding against his ribcage. “Okay.”
“Er-tell me something happy?” he asked, trying to break the dark mood.
“Draco, what are you doing on the floor?” he asked quietly. Draco jolted away and grasped Severus by the shoulders.
He shook his head.
Draco was constantly worrying these days. It was all he could do really. In his mind there were no loopholes. There was absolutely nothing he could do to get out of this situation. So he worried. Every single second he worried. About every single damn thing. And he could no longer send letters to Pansy and Luna because the mail was being watched. He would have to wait until they got onto the train to tell them. Which was quickly approaching and he still had not figured out exactly what he was supposed to do in this dreadful situation. Eventually his mother told him that they would need to go to Diagon Alley for some new robes and his books when a rather brilliant idea struck him. He would simply pretend to kill Dumbledore until he could think of an actual solution. He would pretend he was trying but not able to succeed. And surely after he bought himself a couple months he would’ve thought of a real plan. A real plan in which no one got hurt and perhaps the dark lord ended up dead.
“Okay, I get it.” Theo said he was shaking now. Looking down at his feet.
“Alright.” A witch wearing bright green robes spoke first. “We will hear you out and then decide what to do with you.”
“Yes we do.”
“Walk with me?” she asked quietly, moving to stand next to him. He nodded, jerkily.
“I know! Merlin.” She buried her face in her hands for a moment and moaned. “This was a terrible idea. Maybe we should’ve just gone to Dumbledore in the first place.”
“Nothing.” he spat.
“Severus. I don’t know if he’s on your-our side.” He corrected himself before continuing. Hermione nodded approvingly, a small smile on her face now. “He’s been acting oddly though, when he’s around me. And I don’t know what to think. There’s no way of knowing now I guess, so it’s not like it matters much.” He shrugged, doing his best to keep his voice at a neutral tone.
“Right.” Together the three of them walked onto the train. Pansy and Draco waved to Theo as they slid into the Prefect’s compartment. Draco bounced his knee up and down as he waited for the signal that they could go sit with their friends. He needed to find Luna and tell her what had happened. Not what had actually happened obviously, but bits and pieces to explain his disappearance over the summer. Weasley and Granger kept glancing at him, and he started to get rather annoyed by it. Why did they always have to stare at him like he was some sort of puzzle that needed piecing together? He was not a puzzle. He was a death eater in love with Harry Potter. Once the headboy and girl had come to tell them they could leave, Draco leapt up and hurried out the compartment door. He had to find Luna. Would she be with Theo and Blaise or...Potter. She was probably with Potter, because Ginevra was there. And now wherever Ginevra went, Luna went. Muttering under his breath he stalked down the train, looking left and right until he could find Luna. Finally he skidded to a stop when he spotted them. Luna, Ginevra, Longbottom, and Potter. Obviously. Luna was swinging Ginevra’s hand back and forth, yet she did not look blissfully happy. She was chewing her bottom lip and kept glancing out the window. Draco stood there for a few more moments, wondering exactly what he should do when she turned her head and realized he was there. Her eyes widened and she quickly flew out of her seat and shut the compartment door behind her. He had a second to view everyone’s confused glances, and Potter’s flushed face, before Luna yanked him down the hall.
A few weeks later Harry told him about a funeral that he had gone to the previous night. For a giant spider named Aragog. That certainly had not been what he was expecting Harry to tell him when he said he wanted to tell him something. They were in the room of requirement, their legs tangled together as they sat on the couch that had appeared when they entered.
“What were you doing wandering around the castle this evening?” He immediately began, narrowing his eyes on Draco.
“Sorry.” Hermione didn’t look very sorry in Draco’s opinion. He noticed the shadows under her eyes were more prominent than they had been before. She didn’t look like she had slept at all.
“Urgh, what?” Came Ginny’s sleepy voice. He heard soft footsteps approach and Luna opened the door, her hair messily strewn across her face.
“Brilliant!” Luna smiled and her eyes held a luminous joy Draco had never seen there. At least he had made her happy. A little while later Draco, Luna, Theo, and Pansy were all freezing in the quidditch stands.
“Harry and Dumbleodore aren’t here.” She breathed, shaking her head like mad.
“Draco! Merlin, I thought you were still stuck there!” Ginny’s voice sounded far away to his ears. He felt as if he was watching the scene unfold from above. He could see himself, arms wrapped snugly around his knees, breathing harshly.
“Here you are.” The girl came back and placed their coffees down on the table. Now she was grinning from ear to ear. Draco must have had a confused look on her face because hurriedly she said,
Draco sighed and tucked the letter away in a box. How was he supposed to wait a whole day (or possibly longer?) to meet Harry. Ever since he was a small boy he had been dreaming of this day. And now that it was so close he was a mess of nerves. What if Harry didn’t even like him? What if they never became friends? Draco pushed those thoughts away hastily. No of course he and Harry would be friends. They had to.
“Set a good example!” Pansy said in dismay.
He was hopeless.
She nodded quickly. “I will. The wards…” Draco let out a strangled laugh. Merlin nothing could shake her focus.
“Hello?” he called in uncertainty. In hindsight it would’ve been much smarter for Draco to have just kicked off the ground before someone caught him.
Okay that's a wrap. BUT THANKS FOR READING LOVE UUUUUUUU.
“Will you make some coffee while we go check up on her Draco?” Ginny asked him, following Luna out of the room.
“It’s alright Draco.” He realized it was Theo he had flung himself into.
“He was really staying at your house.” Dismay wrote itself all over her face.
Draco nodded vigorously, “Of course.” Theo turned and really did leave this time. Draco went to the nearest staircase and sat there thinking for a long while. He should’ve listened to Pansy. Should’ve told Theo right away instead of letting him believe they might ever have a chance together. Draco was a complete mess of a person, he couldn’t understand why even Theo liked him in the first place. But that really wasn’t the point right now. The point was, he had hurt someone he cared about. And although he would really like to blame this on Potter, it wasn’t his fault. It was Draco’s.
“Malfoy?” Draco pressed a hand to his mouth and swallowed hard. So Harry only remembered the worst enemies thing. He couldn’t decide if that was better or worse than having been erased completely. After blinking furiously he stepped forward and illuminated Harry’s face. His eyes widened as Harry realized it was in fact his worst enemy who had come to see him.
Luna glanced at him sharply. “She’s beautiful.” Ginevra looked their way and smiled at Luna, her cheeks a little pink. A pink tinge crept into Luna’s cheeks. Wait…
Draco’s father had always urged him to say the word mudblood instead of muggleborn. It’s their proper name, he had insisted. But Draco had never wanted to say it. He didn’t really know what it meant, yet he still did not want to say it. It shouldn’t matter, he knew that muggleborns blood was dirty. Or something along those lines. He wasn’t sure why it was dirty. That’s what his father had always told him, so he had simply accepted it as fact. Why then did he feel so utterly ashamed at what he had said earlier that day?
“It’s okay, Draco will help.” Luna handed him a towel and began instructing him. “So you’re going to hold this to her side, and I’m going to take off her shirt so we can clean her up a little better.”
“Thanks love.” Ginny winked at her. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and turned his focus back to Hermione.
Dear Luna,
“Hermione and Luna are okay, they were being chased and they ended up bumping into dad.” Ginny brushed a hand against her eyes. “They’re safe now, and dad knows where Ron is so that’s good.”
“Do you want…” He swallowed. “To talk about it?”
P.S. I met this lovely Ravenclaw girl. I simply need to make sure you don’t make fun of her. I know you and Weasel have a talent for hurting people’s feelings. Her name is Luna Lovegood and I believe she was sorted into Ravenclaw. So...just keep your words to yourself this time. Please.
She studied him for a moment before continuing. “Okay...well, Harry gets really upset by everything that she says. And obviously it makes sense because it’s like she’s trying to turn everyone against him and make everyone believe he’s a liar. And seeing Cedric die was so terrible, and I hope you don’t think he tells me all of this. I'm just around him and Ginevra a lot now so I hear a bunch of stuff but that’s not that point. Anyway he’s terribly upset about Cedric’s death, and now Umbridge is trying to tell him that none of it happened and it’s all so terrible and awful and I hope a bunch of nargles crowd her brain and go out her nose!”
“Yes, we’re almost there-” Draco broke off as a hooded figure stepped in front of him. He let out a muffled scream and made for his wand.
Luna drew in a long breath. “I hate her.” She shook her head furiously.
“Look, Harry-”
“Er-what makes you calm?”
Dear Father,
“About…” Draco motioned about, waiting.
“Er-”
I want to make one thing very clear. I couldn’t care less about you. I don’t care if you live if you die. I am sure I can very easily find a new enemy if need be. You don’t mean anything to me at all. We are merely enemies. Enemies who loathe each other. I don’t care about you or your heroic life. I won’t be thinking about you at all this summer. And if I do, it will be to spit at the mention of your name. The very thought of you nauseates me.
“Po-Potter, what are you talking about?”
“Yes, let’s go right now.”
His eyes widened. “Well I’m not going to just let you die! I don’t know what the bloody hell to do!” He said angrily, his voice rising. Why why why, had she left the house without someone again?
Draco Malfoy
“Okay, okay.” Hermione was pacing back and forth shaking her hands out as they went over the plan one last time.
“Come in.” he called, trying to keep his voice steady. His mother came in, looking pale and shaken.
“Did you call me father?” he asked.
Draco Malfoy (no longer your worst enemy)
Everything. Anything. He could not go in there and sit next to Potter. Yes he would very much like to, however he was a death eater. And it was dangerous to be anywhere near Potter now.
“It’s been sort of like that for him too, recently at least. He told me he has flashbacks about the two of you, and there are odd spaces of time he doesn’t remember anymore. That have nothing to do with you.” She twisted her hands together. “You have every right to be furious, believe me, I would be fucking pissed. But he wanted to know, I suppose, about what was happening in those memories and he thought those letters had the answers to all of his questions.”
Draco felt himself flush.
Your worst enemy and first love
Your worst enemy
Nothing’s terribly wrong just yet so don’t panic. But I’ve begun to worry. I’ve been exchanging letters with Pansy and Blaise and both have said their parents have told them that they’re currently in service to the dark lord. My parents won’t tell me anything. I think they’re trying to convince me that the dark lord isn’t actually back, but I know better. I fear both of my parents have returned to serve the dark lord Draco. And I’m scared to think of what will happen to them. My mum used to tell me about how she regretted ever taking part in all that in the beginning, so I don’t understand why they decided to go back. I didn’t mean to write about this for so long. What I really wanted to tell you was that I’m bisexual. I figured it out this summer and I told Pansy and I wanted to tell you too. I’ll probably tell Blaise soon as well. That was all, I hope your summer isn’t completely terrible.
Draco smiled a little. Potter thought that they were unbelievably excellent.
“I’m so happy for you.” he grinned at her.
“Ron stop it!” Granger and Potter came barrowling out of nowhere.
“Urgh, shite.” Pansy muttered under her breath at the sight of them. Pansy had always hated Granger for some reason unknown to him. Both Granger and Weasley had their heads bent together and were violently whispering, when they noticed the two new figures in the car they straightened immediately. Both seemed to make it a point to look anywhere but at Draco. What the bloody hell was going on. Draco swallowed and slid into a seat next to Padma.
He nodded even as he was internally screaming about the fact that by the time they found potions, it might be too late. Healing potions weren’t just sold anywhere.
“Ginny, there’s no use in getting mad at her right now. We have to help her.” Luna ran down the stairs to where Hermione lay on the couch, in a pool of her own blood.
“Where are we going boy?” Amycus asked, clearly annoyed with Draco.
“Not your fault.”
“Don’t worry I’m not going to report you, and neither is Harry. He’s not that senseless, he still cares about you.”
“Don’t sweat it. And call me Hermione.” She nodded at him firmly.
“Is everything alright?”
She rolled her eyes.
“Shoo, damn. Don’t look at me like that.” Draco glanced over his shoulder, ready to make a run for it, but he was caught by the back of his beck and he let out a small gasp.
“Is everything alright?” he asked tentatively. Snape straightened and sighed.
“Of course my lord.” He tried nodding to make it seem more convincing. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see his mother shaking. Her eyes glistened with unshed tears.
anywhere near Potter. He had been minding his own business, studying a statue, pretending to not notice when Potter and his friends passed by. So maybe he was feeling a little bit annoyed at Weasley for elbowing him earlier in the day and he stuck out his foot and Weasley tripped. However Weasley didn’t notice it was him, and neither did Granger.
Harry made a choking noise then nodded sharply. “We should find the others.”
Sincerely,
“Draco you’re crying.” Luna said softly, grabbing his hand gently.
“Hey!” Harry protested weakly.
“Oh, er-It’s Harry.” After a beat. “Potter.” Well duh Potter. How many Harry’s did he know?
“Fine.” Draco clenched his jaw and stormed out of the library.
“I know, but I’m fine really. How are you-” And Ginevra, he had been about to say. But then Harry walked in, head whipping around and Draco realized with a jolt he was probably looking for him. He stood and nearly knocked Luna over in the process. She whipped her head around to see Harry standing there, staring at Draco with a small smile on his face, his cheeks red.
“Right.” Draco said, twisting his hands together.
What mattered was getting out of here as swiftly as possible. Steeling himself, he walked into his house and let the door click shut behind him. Okay. First up. Potions. Severus kept some stored in the basement he believed. Fuck he really hated the basement. His father had locked him in there for three hours once. He didn’t even remember what he had done. Draco listened for a beat, praying he didn’t hear the quiet murmuring of a death eater meeting. Then he frowned. Now that he thought about it, his dark mark should’ve been stinging whenever meetings were called. Granted he had barely been gone a week so perhaps they hadn’t had a meeting. Yet...something didn’t sit right with him. Well now wasn’t really the time to contemplate such thoughts. After only silence answered him, he crept down the basement stairs. Trying to make as little noise as possible, in case someone happened to be home. After shakily shoving the correct potions into a bag, he speed walked up the stairs, accidentally slamming the door behind him.
Despite his eagerness to see Vernon dead and buried, Harry’s heart ached for Dudley. To carry your father’s coffin before the age of seventeen is something no child should have to go through, and from one orphan to what Harry supposed was a half-orphan, Harry pitied Dudley, with all his soul.
“I’d only had it once before coming here. I’m sure Sirius has told you but my family, ah, aren't the most open minded. I’d always wanted to try it again, I’m glad it's properly homemade here.”
“Draco, sweetheart I love you. I go beyond ‘not caring’, I support you, a hundred percent”
Draco then returned to Ron’s family and Hermione, and the latter immediately engaged him in conversation about a book they had both read recently. He got caught up in talking to Hermione who was a challenging conversation partner. She constantly questioned his opinions, confronting him with how many of his opinions on literary works were borne out of classism and his assumed superiority he had developed due to his race and class. He came out of the other end of the interaction thoroughly chastened and questioning his entire upbringing. That was the point of a gap year, he supposed.
The Potter boy-Harry- says, smiling.
Winked. At. Him.
“Oh, what a shame, it’s on Thursday” he simpers, unable to fully hide his victorious smile.
“Really Hermione, him? You’re going to get with him?” he said, venom lacing his tone.
“it isn’t hard to see that she adores you. She looks at you like the sun shines out your arse”
Draco’s throat clogs up with tears.
“you have us too, Sirius. Like it or not you’re part of the family now” Ron said, grinning up at Sirius.
"I am very well aware of that fact"
Draco waited for her outburst but she just shook her head.
"Hmf" Draco scooched over a bit before pulling Harry into his arms, "A bit of warning next time might be nice"
Draco frowned before recounting his conversation with Pansy and Blaise the day before:
"C'mon Draco, it's so nice" Blaise offered.
"Marry me" Draco whispered as if it were some great secret.
"Shit Draco" Blaise's typical joking mannerism was gone and replaced with a serious expression, "How long?"
"I-I thought Harry put magic into it. Plus we aren't technically married so I didn't think our rings could produce soulmate magic"
The hall became quiet pretty quickly and everyone was looking around to find the source and when they found the whole Gryffindor table looking at Harry intently; they followed suit.
"Yes ma'am," Draco and Harry said at the same time, and then Draco handed Teddy over to Remus who gave him a bright smile and a squeeze on the shoulder.
"Harry James Potter!" Came a loud voice from the staff table and Harry couldn't help but stifle a laugh when he realized Minerva was trying to conceal a smile as well.
"Then take your shirt off"
"And you love him?"
"Arrogant"
"Like a damn king"
Draco gave her a hug too, "I love you guys so much"
"Draco," He said over the mind link. It was a piece of old magic they had found in the room of hidden things back in fourth-year. It used to take every last bit of magic they had, but over time it got easier and easier, and especially easier after a specifically fun night in the Room Of Requirement where their magic mixed in such a way where the mind-link was practically as easy as speaking out loud.
"Kinda"
"Professor" He replied in a respectful tone before making his way to the front where Draco was sitting. Snape had put a Gryffindor with a Slytherin together for each pair, and it was actually working out well because if a Slytherin tried to ruin a Gryfindors potion they were also ruining one of their snake's potions.
"Godfather ring" Pansy supplied. It was a pureblood tradition. A promise ring for a serious relationship that wasn't quite ready for marriage but both parties were practically already engaged. And the godfather ring.
So, Harry made his way to his first-class - potions. That fact alone probably would have made his mood drop a year ago, but he didn't mind potions much anymore. After the war, Snape became increasingly less grouchy and now that everyone wasn't trying to sabotage each other's potions, he was finally receiving good marks - great marks. Harry was actually really thankful that Snape carried anti-venom with him whenever meeting with Voldemort, or else he never would have survived Nagini's attack.
"I hate you"
"I get it"
"You're insane," Pansy said lovingly.
"Don't be silly" Sirius opened his arms and Harry rushed into them, "You too, young man" Sirius said to Draco over Harry's shoulder and the other boy joined the little hug. It was a little squished but it was nice.
When they separated, Harry grabbed Draco's hand to show his godfather the ring, but when they touched and the dragon popped out, everyone gasped.
"Are we dating?" Harry yelled across the hall and the smirk that slinked across Draco's face made Harry smirk as well.
"Why were you in the Hospital Wing?" Snape asked Harry.
"You brought it up!"
Draco lay there on Harry's chest, soaking in the warmth and bliss that Harry provided. Neither boy could imagine anything better than this. They laced their fingers together and Harry continued to place lazy kisses on any part of Draco he could get his mouth onto.
Draco held the ring in his hand and kissed Harry again. Then, Draco casually slipped the chain off his neck and pulled the ring off. Kissing Harry again, he slipped the ring onto Harry's ring finger and sighed when he felt the familiar magic settle between them. Harry smiled against his lips and followed suit - pulling Draco's chain off and slipping the silver ring off and onto Draco's ring finger, before putting the chain still holding Teddy's ring back over Draco's neck.
"And where might you have been this morning?"
"Nothing is, 'up with me'" He replied stiffly.
"Oh but you do," Draco said to Harry over the link. Harry just shot a glare at him.
Pansy didn't see what he was holding, but she did see the insane littering of hickeys that covered his whole chest but promptly stopped in a very strict line where his shirt would end if it were present. Draco had a glamour on, to cover any skin that wasn't normally covered by his shirts and robes, but he didn't want to cover the marks that were under his clothing. He liked being able to peek at them or feel the soreness from a particularly tender spot.
* * * * *
"Draco Lucius Malfoy!" Sirius bellowed. If the scene wasn't so hilarious, the headmistress may have attempted to stop it, but she couldn't miss this.
"I didn't mean for it to slip," Draco told him with a guilty look.
"I don't know"
"I will," Draco replied with a sigh. He closed his eyes and just let himself feel free for a few moments, before all of a sudden he was being lifted off the ground and thrown into the water. "PANSY!" He shrieked.
"I dunno, sir"
"What is going on?"
"Why would I be upset? Surely there have been worse rumors than whatever nonsense this is" He looked back and forth between his two friends but neither said anything. He made an exasperated sigh and turned around.
"Well isn't that the question" She tutted and then held her wand over him - doing scans he would presume? "Well you don't look like you're dying"
"Well..what is it?" Harry asked, turning to Ron who was flushed and shaking his head.
"Please?" Harry looked over at him with the best puppy dog eyes he could make - Sirius was teaching him because 'When you get a lover, Harry, you can make them do anything you want by giving them these eyes'. And then Remus had whacked him over the back of his head.
"I'll keep that in mind," Harry replied before frowning, "What happened?"
"Potter" Draco replied in the same tone as he too stood up.
"It wasn't that" Harry assured, "It was the war. We just wanted to have something that wasn't open or shared with anyone but ourselves"
"Still feel a bit bad" He came forward and stuck his nose to Harry's neck and took a long sniff and then smirked, "Have a nice shag last night?"
"Love you" Harry repeated before they both promptly fell asleep in each other's arms. Harry was more than content. He was happy. They both were. The war was over, and they had each other, and their friends were supportive and Harry and Draco couldn't think of anything more they could need. They had each other, and that was more than enough.
"It is....odd" Is all Snape could say.
"I'm glad they know," Harry told Draco in a soft voice while rubbing his thumb over Draco's pale cheek, "You need friends who you can confide in"
"Why are you looking at the ferret like that?"
Teddy came running into the room and jumped into Draco's arms.
Harry's knees hit the mattress and Draco pushed him down, crawling over top. Harry smiled at the possessiveness of the following kiss. Draco settled between his legs and pressed their hips together. Harry could feel just how much Draco wanted him at that moment and he couldn't help but pick up on the clear arousal through their soulbond.
"That's bullshit and we both know it"
"Draco," She said quietly while reaching out for the silver chain that held two rings. As soon as Pansy touched them, he knew it was over. "Are these...?" He knew what she was asking.
"Calm down Dray," Pansy said with a laugh. Blaise was laughing softly from further in the water and Draco couldn't help but frown and huff.
"Sir" Draco said as he slid forward gracefully from the Slytherin table and came up right beside Harry. Their fingers automatically intertwined naturally and there were several shocked gasps and a bunch of money being pushed towards McGonagall.
Draco was sprawled out on Harry's bed when Harry got into their little room. McGonagall thought it best to pair people from different houses up together to promote house unity. Harry and Draco pretended to be appalled by their housing situation, but it couldn't have been more perfect.
Draco closed his book and stretched slightly, causing his soft gray shirt to ride up and reveal a little sliver of pale skin. Harry smiled and walked over to his bed. He reached out and tugged the shirt down before flopping down on the bed next to the other boy.
"Draco!" Pansy yelled from inside the lake, "Get your ass in here!"
"Yes, yes it is"
"Harry you're not like-" Ron began, but a clearing of a throat stopped their discussion.
"You are rather pretty" Harry tried not to laugh at that.
"Well, bugger" Sirius sighed.
"Well to be fair you are always fooling around. Can't keep a girl for over a week" Blaise points out.
"I hate you" He mumbled. He was still in his dark green shirt and black trousers and he hated wearing clothes in the water, but he refused to reveal what was under them.
"How come you need to check that with Madam Pomfrey? You never check" This was also a new development in Snape's classes. You were allowed to ask random questions and he would either give you an answer or politely tell you to ask some other time. It was weird at first, but now everyone was just appreciative of it.
