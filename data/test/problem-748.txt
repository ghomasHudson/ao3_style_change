“I’m sorry. I know you loved him. But if you feel this way then there is no good. You can’t build relationship constantly fighting.”
I hope you are having a fantastic day, decent at least, and as you always have to read to my rants, please - let me know how are you and what you are up to these days!
Draco looked after him, heart beating fast. He couldn’t properly process what just happened. Did Harry really want to kiss him or was it just his imagination? And did he walk away because someone wrote to him to meet, or just because he wanted to run away from Draco?
With a loud click and an uneasy sensation in his stomach that almost made him sick, he found himself on the empty sidewalk. He had no idea where in the world he was, and looking around at the houses did nothing for him. But before he could say anything, Ana outstretched her hand to the street and waved. Nothing happened for a good minute, and as he wanted to question that, a three-story bus appeared right in front of them, and a short man, not older than him, got out.
As if it was some routine, after eating Hermione leaned against the tree, with newest edition of Hogwarts: The History, in her hands, that she purchased in Hogsmeade just yesterday. Harry laid down, and Draco sat in close distance reading Madame Bovary, Salem in his crossed legs, as he appeared out of nowhere. His book was an very old copy that he brought from  home, full French, which he spoke fluently since he was four. His mother insisting that he had to have French tutor. Not that it was anything pleasant.
“We didn’t feel like watching the game,” Hermione explained. “I never liked it. It’s very primal and brutal, and the last thing I want to see is Ron getting beaten in the head by Bludgers. And Harry, well, he can’t play, so it isn’t the most pleasant thing to watch what you can’t do, right?”
Hermione left and he continued with his essay. He didn’t envy her at the moment. He knew that Ron could be a bit … nasty. Not only from hearing Hermione’s stories of their friendship and relationship. He remembered all the times him and Harry didn’t talk for some reasons, few years back. And it wasn’t like it all was Hermione’s fault. Some relationship just didn’t work, and it was one of them. Draco just wished the best for his friend and that she didn’t
He was coming back from Slughorn’s classroom, after finishing his task of cleaning, when the Weaselette approached him. She was angry, she knew about him and Harry, and she threatened him. For a moment, his mind told him, that she was the one that pushed him, but it wasn’t the case.
They sat down and Hermione started unpacking the basket that must have been enchanted to hold all of its content. It turned out to be a small feast, a little bit too big for only four, with big variety of foods, and Draco’s favorite dessert of strawberry shortbread with whipped cream. With stomachs filled with food, slightly aching in some cases, they proceed to the after-lunch lounging that there never was time for at Hogwarts, as they would usually rush to their next periods. But today the Charms and Arithmancy were cancelled so, they’ve decided to take the opportunity and leave for the picnic. That was also why Weaselette wasn’t with them. She still had classes. Not that Draco minded. The least he saw there, the better.
“I will go tell your friends to leave now, if you are sure you don’t want them here. And I will give you a moment.”
“You know Aunt A hates it when you jump on the counter. You are running outside all days catching germs, and then you walk on the kitchen counter,” he scolded. Salem was uninterested in what Draco had to say, fixated on the fish that was soon presented to him. “You don’t even care, do you,” he sighed, petting the cat.
Well, it was sort of sneakier than doing it out in the open field like him and Harry did, less than an hour ago.
The boy nodded quickly, looking at Draco with anticipation. He chuckled to himself and got up from his warm, cozy bed, and put on the thick robe before taking the boy’s waiting hand and going to the kitchen.
He didn’t notice how Harry moved closer to him, their faces just inches apart. He didn’t notice the hand that crept his way up, until warm thumb wiped away his tears, and the palm rested on his cheek.
Hermione, nor Madame Pomfrey, wasn’t lying. After their short conversation, Draco got a big dose of potions, topped with Dreamless Sleep. He didn’t wake up until the noon of the next morning, feeling a lot better. Hermione, Luna and Neville came to visit him after the dinner and spent good hour at his bedside. Hermione stuck around longer, and Madame Pomfrey had to rush her out. He wasn’t discharged for another five days, the trio visiting him every day. He finally left the Hospital Wing on Saturday, after having dinner in the solitary of the Hospital Wing, that he shared with two first and second years, that didn’t pay him any mind.
“And if we are on the lunch, I would eat something. I didn’t have breakfast. Too much going on for anyone to care about me.”
With a mug full of steaming coffee – with cream and sugar, he sat down at the table with his aunt and Teddy and made it a point for himself to scarf down as many of the pancakes as he could. And then have a nap. But first, he made sure that the boy’s breakfast was ready alongside his cup of juice. It quickly became a thing – Draco mothering over Teddy. It came so naturally that it was almost frightening how close he grew to the boy he haven’t seen before. The only thing was that he regretted not being in his life sooner. Or that he wasn’t needed there, that Teddy would have his parents at his side. But those were wishes he would have during the dark, sleepless nights that he was haunted with dawning past.
He saw the way Harry was smiling all the way downstairs and even once they left the house into the freezing cold and falling snow.
Hermione continued to fiercely relating him the story of her unfairly graded essay, how the professor was wrong, and in which moments exactly. He found the fact that he could somehow uplift her spirits, at least he told himself it was him that did so, heartwarming. He couldn’t be more grateful for he had found Hermione. That after many years he finally found it in himself to say sorry. He never dreamed of gaining a friend like her, and he couldn’t be happier.
He was more than sure he would cry, since just the thought of being so close with a man he loved so deeply made his heart swell. But now, as it came to it, he couldn’t put together a single thought, and even though his eyes watered, tears pricking, he didn’t cry. He let Harry hold him close, enjoying every second of the warmth of his boy that he could get. It was perfect. Truly perfect.
“Somehow I’m not convinced. Are others giving you hard time? You could tell me, you know? I met few of them on my way here. They asked me out on a beer later but I have no intentions of going. Carrow is the worst asshole I got to know. Is he giving you a hard time? Because I would suspect him.”
Harry’s lips made contact with the exposed skin of his neck, leaving soft kisses, trailing up to the sensitive spot behind his ear. He closed his eyes, melting at the spot, knees budging a bit, so he had to lean against Harry’s chest.
“It’s just strange, for the biggest part. I find myself missing them, thinking what they would thing about this or that, and then I think … that I can’t be thinking that because I never knew them. I never knew who they were, what kind of parents they were and stories of few people are not enough to make up for that. But for most I just hope they are okay, wherever they are. After the cemetery with Tom I couldn’t stop wishing that they were finally left alone and at peace. And it’s … it’s all just so messed up,” Harry said, sighing deeply and dropping to lay flat on the blanket.
“I’m not sure. Harry found you on his way back from Hogsmeade. You were beaten up and jinxed. He went straight to Headmistress once Madame Pomfrey took care of you, and I came. Do you remember anything?”
Draco frowned, trying to understand the riddle, but nothing came to his mind. He did know some French girls, mostly his very distance relatives that he got to meet on few occasions, but he never got to drawing any of them.
“Don’t look so dumbfounded, Draco. You and Blaise know each other for years. And he is a good catch. I was surprised when his mother approached me, telling me he asked for my recognition over your hand. We could not find you a better match. Other than him there was only that Rowle man and Selwyn’s father. Both are quite good, but Zabinis are beating them. They are almost as rich as we are.”
First of all Harry knew that he was gay, and regardless he decided to be so close to him. Two, he was being nice to him, assuring that there was nothing to worry about, and comforting him. And, above that, was the fact that Draco had admitted before himself the giant, silly crush that he had been nursing since the fifth year. His heart was pounding like crazy every time Harry did as much as looked at him, not to mention the sparks he felt when they caught eye contact or touched. Which was rare, so this moment, where Harry was straight-on having his head on his thigh, resting so peacefully, and listening to his stutter, it felt so…out worldly. But in the best way possible. He had never felt this way before, and as sad as it was, he wasn’t sure he wanted.
He felt so lost and lonely that not even Salem’s presence brought much comfort these days. He was in constant worry about the future, trying to figure out what to do, and constantly blaming himself for putting himself in such a position.
“Thanks. No, really, I regret it. I was just stupid boy, living here and now, and I let this happen even though I shouldn’t have. It was unfair towards her, even though she was the one to propose it, I just …”
He carried on with the task of making endless pancakes and eating a leftover cinnamon roll from yesterday that he reheated. One thing that happened in the past few weeks he was at his aunt’s, the morning sickness went away, and he ate everything in his sight and still had space left for more. Due to that, he gained a lot of weight. So much that he didn’t recognize himself in the mirror anymore. His face rounded up and so did the rest of his body. No more ribs were poking out, no pointy shoulders and collarbones. And his bum, hips, and cleavage just got crazy. The only thing that didn’t grow was his stomach. Other than few more centimeters that he gained around his middle, it stopped. He was concerned at first, but the healer assured him that baby was growing just fine and he had plenty of time to grow. Not that he minded any of it. As long as it kept his baby happy, he wouldn’t complain. And he was sort of happy too. He didn’t feel any of the awful tension that he had for months. Leaving his home did help.
Draco was the first to withdrew after a long moment, breathing heavily and looking at Harry carefully. Only now he noticed that something was really up. It wasn’t the first time that he encountered Harry looking this way. So distant and tired. He had bags under his eyes, stumble on his chin and his skin had this sickly grey color. He never dared to ask, worrying he might be overstepping his boundaries.
Hermione looked at him dumbfounded, as if he gone totally mad at the spot, and he couldn’t really blame her. He was going mad while desperately trying to keep it together.
“I’ve learned about this place during our forth year. It was second task of the Tournament … and you probably don’t want to hear it. Sorry.”
Harry sighed heavily, hugging him tighter and placing few soft kissed on his face, understanding perfectly. Draco didn’t want this nigh to end. He wanted the clock to stop or the time to at least drag on slower. And sleep was only bringing the inevitable end quicker. He was be alright with one sleepless night if it was the prize he had to pay for being with Harry.
He didn’t say anything, so she left, closing the curtains around his bed. He wasn’t sure he felt so lost and scared in his whole life. If felt like some sort of crazy dream that borderlined on a nightmare. In spin of what felt like moments he lost his friends, the love of his life turned out to be a liar, and now, on top of that, he learned he was having a baby with the said love of his life.
“But that’s alright. I got used to the idea. My father was an asshole before he learned I’m not going to be a perfect manly man…”
“Oh, darling. I was just like you. Thinking that life is all about love. But then I met your father, and I understood that it all wasn’t about it. Life is about having a face and good backup. I never loved Lucius, no. But we are great partners. I never was short of anything. He provided me with everything I needed and more. Most importantly, it was what my family wanted from me, so I did it. You are going to do so too. For your family. Zabinis are the most liked family these days. No doubt tying a knot between two of you would make us look better.”
“Hello! This is Mrs. Tilly speaking. I am sorry to interrupt, but may I speak with Andromeda Tonks, please? … Yes, yes. Thank you very much! … You too! … Oh, hello there, Andi! I am sorry to interrupt your stay, darling … I hope you are having fun? … Yes, yes! I have someone here that needs to talk to you. Have a nice stay, dear, I will see you soon.”
I like this chapter, though it was struggle to get through it. I'm not in the best place right now, so I'm finding writing a bit hard, but I'm getting better, and I'm getting more writing done. I know I always write too much here and no one cares, but I wanted to say that I'm really thankful for my readers and that you all stuck around this long and are waiting for more <3 We are oficially ending sort of 'part' one of this story with next chapter and I'm kind of excited, because I was waiting to write this next part for so long.
“Grandma is still asleep,” he asked, helping Teddy to sit on the counter as he always did. The boy just nodded in agreement.
But life wasn’t that nice. And especially people in his life. He couldn’t see what could really happen. His mother was an unpredictable in her actions, and it was hard to even wonder what her reaction would be.
Harry stubbornly avoided his eyes, silent. Draco grew only more concerned. He moved closer and put hand on his cheek, nagging Harry to look at him, which he finally did.
“I … I’m sorry for coming unannounced. But I had an argument with mother, and I had to get out of there,” he said, quietly, not wanting to get into details not in person.
The silence that fell after those words were so heavy and almost frightening. His mother’s face was even paler than usual, and when she started talking again, her voice was chillingly calm.
When the brown-haired man sat back next to him, their eyes couldn’t meet as they were both holding slight shame of what had just happened.
“Can you believe that only three more months and school will be over? We won’t come back here. Ever,” Harry said. He got apparently too bored by the book.
“I am her nep … niece. I am her niece.” There was no point in proving the woman wrong. He did look more like a girl these days, no doubt. His hair was all grown out, and he let his mother take him to her hair stylist to have them cut just under his shoulders with some layers. And what he was wearing wasn’t exactly considered manly. To that, if he was really to stay there, he wouldn’t just parade around all pregnant, as Muggles weren’t exactly used to seeing pregnant men. So, for now, he would be considered a girl then. “I didn’t tell her I was coming. I … there was a bit of a situation, and I didn’t have time to tell her I would be coming.”
He was found at the loss for words once again, not knowing how to act or what to say, standing frozen with a bowl of salad in the midway to the table. First of all, he was panicking, wondering if the oversized sweater was hiding his belly just as it did this morning, but looking at how Harry wasn’t freaking out himself, it did. Then there was a case of
“It’s fine, it’s alright,” Narcissa murmured, more to herself than to him. “I know just a person. I will fire call her now, and I am sure she will have us an hour from now. And no one will ever know. It will be like it never happened…”
“He was my godfather, as you know,” Harry said, quietly. “At first I thought he did get my parents killed as everyone said, but he didn’t, and that you know too. I just … I got really close to him, even though we didn’t have much time together, and him being a bit out of it due to his isolation, having to stay put and in hiding. He was closest to a real family I ever had. He knew my parents, was close with them, and he kept telling me how I was just like my father. I think that’s what brought us the closest. Him and Lupin were closest to my parents, and it drew me in. Unlike Lupin, Sirius was very talkative and never shied away from speaking about them. I was looking forward to better times, to living with him in peace and quiet. For a long time, he was my only hope, you know. But once he was gone, I didn’t have this hope anymore. I felt left alone, and ready to die more than to win. But somehow I managed to do it, and made it out alright. I had half a mind of selling Grimmauld Place, or whatever wizards do with ancient, crazy houses, but I came around thinking that it was the only piece of
He called the House-elf and asked to have lunch served in the greenhouse, one of the least chaotic places at the moment, and after tea was finished, he and Blaise made their way there.
Luna has gifted him with the most extinguished, odd looking, and colorful scarf he had ever seen. It was thick and long with colorful tassels on each end, whole made of small patches of different colors of yarn, each seemingly different color and shade. He decided it was nothing compared to the present he gave Luna. His set of handmade sunflower jewelry he purchased through Owl Post and book on Muggle mythology was appearing blandly now.
I am so happy to be back and writing, though I am sad there are only five more chapters left. How in the world are we already here? I just started this story (and took so many breaks) that it feels like I should be on chapter three, not two thirds in.
Draco smiled as Harry laughed it off and came back to his homework. He came back to drawing, but couldn’t stop thinking about the other’s words. Did it mean that Harry would like to spend more time with him once the school was over? It did sound like it. They couldn’t get any Muggle device to work at school and there were no more occasions to leave, so summer sounded like the only option. He got a little excited at the prospect. Movies were fun, even though he just saw one. And movies with Harry were another level, even though he didn’t really saw one
Just as predicted, that was the end of nice weather. Autumn came rumbling and angry, heavy rains, thunders and storm barely ever go away. Everyone were stuck at the castle, not even willing to go to Hogsmeade as attentively as before.
His eyes were travelling around the room as he tried his best to not look at Draco, that was blushing like mad, sinking further into water.
He looked at him surprised. Harry looked unfazed, still laying with his eyes closed and face relaxed.
He sneaked into Dungeons just before the class before lunch ended, and luckily he avoided anyone’s prying eyes, especially the ones he didn’t want at all. When he was in the safety of his own room, he finally let the tears that he didn’t know he was holding back, run. It took him a long time before the tears stopped and his head stopped being all fuzzy and full of awful thoughts. He laid curled up in his bed, hugging Salem, staring into the darkness of the room before he finally fell asleep.
He settled on making treacle tart as a dessert and roast for the main course. He was perfectly aware that it was Harry’s favorite food. Just as he was aware of what brand of Butterbeer was his favorite. And that he liked it cold, fresh out of the fridge. And he put extra effort so the man would get it. Which was utterly stupid.
“Draco,” Harry said softly, in attempt to start his rant that was getting him dangerously into bad headspace.
“I hurt my back in the final battle. I fell from very high on my back. Didn’t feel how bad it was until the adrenaline wore off. Hermione says it’s chronic pain, or something. Might never go away. Only some potions and work outs are helping out, but flying on the broom is too uncomfortable and it hurts like hell. Also too risky, I should risk bigger injury with the state of it.”
“Don’t be. It’s alright. I mean, if I was playing I couldn’t be here with you, enjoying our picnic, could I?”
“Wait,” Draco added quickly. “Can you take my presents with you? I mean, I got one for Hermione, Ron and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and for Teddy and for you too…” he said, suddenly embarrassed. It sounded more stupid spoken out loud.
he win was entirely different question. At this point in his friendship with Hermione he understood that, perhaps, they were real friends, and it would last longer than he initially thought. And that meant it was high time he started getting along with Ron, at least for her sake. So, he stood before difficult question of whether to be beaten, to let Ron feel better about himself, or to win and make him dislike him more. But on the other hand there was a possibility that Ron would like him more if he turn out to be good and won.
Harry took away the parchment and pencil and put them on the table, as he was no longer drawing, just staring at it. The brown-haired man moved his chair closer, so close that their thighs were touching. He leaned in to Draco, just so they could hear each other.
Eventually, the decided it was high time to go back to school. They paid and left the pub. When they were already outside, he took only few steps, before he felt a hand wrap around his arm. He turned around to see Harry. He was alone, unsure smile on his lips. The brown-haired man leaned in to him.
They were buried in the talk about the new law that Department for Magical Creatures was trying to pass. Well, Harry, Hermione and Neville, at least were. He himself didn’t want to even open his mouth about anything that related politics, not only because he had no idea about anything of sort, while Luna read the Quibbler and Ginny was stubbornly silent, showing how displeased she was to be around them.
Harry planted few soft kissed on top of his hand, before stopping. He was still holding Draco’s hand, not saying a word, so blonde look up at him, just to see Harry examinate his uncovered wrist. An uncomfortable wave of realization hit him. Harry was looking at the nasty, old scar that was blemishing his pale skin with its pink color and awful texture.
“Yes. But it isn’t really based on true story, right. They just took this situation and made it into romance. So, there is this rich girl and poor guy that are on this cruise, and they fall in love. He can draw and she is posing for him and she says ‘draw me like one of your French girls’, which is where the reference came from.”
“You can use Prefect Bathroom. No one goes there after nine thirty. Ron says they have a strict schedule. It’s the fourth door to the left of statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password is
They didn’t press the subject anymore. Instead they both started doing their homework, in silence this time. When it was time to leave, they both started putting their books away.
“O-O-Of course! It was so much fun. Scary a bit. Grinch was scary. But he t-turned out n-n-nice!” he said, overly excited what made Harry laughed a bit, and him blushed. “S-S-Sorry.”
After everything settled down, as much as it could have, his mother came up with a brilliant idea of getting back in touch with her sister. After all she was the only family they had left. They met few times, that Draco knew of, and he met her once, for tea with her mother, but it was cut rather short. Andromeda didn’t love who Narcissa was, and vice versa. They were just too different and there was too much between them to rebuild their relationship. Which was pity, because after all Andromeda was the last piece of family he had left beside his parents. And she was extremely nice, smart, and kind woman. He wanted to get to know her better, perhaps have a real aunt, but he never got such chance.
be there. He asked Kreacher for some food before left to walk around the house, take a tour of his own, now that he could focus more. He found out that were few untouched bedrooms and rooms, staying dusty and cluttered with more furniture than they were meant to be holding.
He felt bad for lying to Hermione, as the only thing he wanted to do was to tell her everything. But he couldn't. The thing between Harry and him was strictly confidential.
Blaise didn’t comment, just nodded. They spend a good hour just talking as the uncomfortable silence and tension finally melted away. But Draco couldn’t say that things were the same as before. Everything changed because of Blaise’s intentions and Draco’s condition. It wasn’t the same anymore.
Anyway, TMI of today - I've got another plant baby, it was gifted to me for my birthday and on the second note - college is starting in three weeks though I vividly remember it being five months away (it's my first year, and no, I'm not that young, I 'should've' started it a few years back if I went straight after high school).
He was shaking with nerves when the Monday came. He woke up to nausea first thing in the morning, and didn’t even make it to the door before he had a puking spree to the rubbish bin for good part of an hour. He wasn’t sure if it was nerves or all of suddenly pregnancy symptoms decided to kick in, but he prayed for the first option. Last thing he needed now was upset stomach and puking every five minutes. NEWTs were only a week away, and he needed all the focus he could get.
. I mean, not him in particular. It’s just … we were sort of connected. And I could see or feel some things he did and felt. And I had a lots of nightmares when he was obsessed getting a prophecy from the Ministry. Almost every night I would dream of this door and hallway, and I had this awful feelings to that. It was the worst moment when one night I sort of got into his snake’s head as it was attacking Mr. Weasley. It was so horrible. It was as if my brain just turned and I wanted to kill Mr. Weasley myself, do those things to him. When I woke up I was so terrified and no one would listen to me, everyone were so calm, treating me like a hero that saved Arthur, and they would keep me in the dark, deciding it was better for me. When, in fact, I was going mad, thinking I am a threat to everyone. So, those nightmares … they come back every now and then. Tonight was one of them. It started alright, but then I slipped into what seemed like this vision, that I was attacking someone. I couldn’t wake up, and when I did, I felt so awful … I was scared for a moment that it was a dream that I defeated Tom and that he attacked someone again.”
They never really talked about getting more intimate than kisses and what they did that one time during their picnic, but they both felt like distance was needed here. They didn’t feel quiet ready to cross that line.
He knew it was this sort of feeling that no one else in the world could spark. That it was something that barely anyone in this world was lucky enough to know. But he knew it was not his to have. That it was his for only a brief moment. So, he made sure to rejoice the single moment he had.
it will be fun. It’s so warm outside still, we need to enjoy this long summer. I will organize food, and we will take a lots of blankets, and maybe few pillows. We will invite the rest too. It will be lovely, I promise.”
Ana left, and soon enough Blaise walked in, looking way too handsome in his black suit and black shirt. And that half-smile he was sporting wasn’t helping. Draco often thought that, in a different setting, he would see himself falling for Blaise. If only the other man liked men and had a bit of interest in him.
“Oh, you never been to one? Right, that’s stupid of me. I forgot that Hermione told me it was just a Muggle thing. Well, zoo is the place where you can see animals from all around the world. Like elephants or zebras or lions, many birds and reptiles, everything. Oceanarium is the same but with fish and everything that lives underwater.”
“Are you feeling alright, Draco? You are as white as a wall. I mean, you always were, but it’s different,” Blaise said, his voice heavy with concern.
“She was Tonks’s mother, I’m not sure if you knew her, she was part of The Order. Also, she was Lupin’s wife. They had a son, Teddy, who is my godson. He is staying with her. They will be at Weasley’s.”
Draco tries to come to terms with the school ending, but everything that is going on isn't helping at all.
He could see the top of Hogwarts’s towers when he felt some sort of curse hit his back. The last thing he knew was the awful, prickly stiffness overtaking his body as he fell face first into cold snow.
His head was throbbing with pain, and so was his left hand. He felt heavy and dizzy, and he found it hard to open eyes. It was a vividly reminding him of the situation he was in few weeks back. And just as he assumed – once he opened his eyes, he was welcomed with sight of Hospital Wing. His mind was fuzzy and he couldn’t quite put together how he ended up from coming back from Slughorn to getting in here.
He remembered the burn of the cuts all too vividly on his skin. He remember that awful, awful smile on Umbridge’s face, the way she sipped her stupid tea, as if it was the most pleasant September afternoon, and she got to caught her favorite program on wireless. But it was only him, struggling to keep the tears from running down his face, as he was forced to hurt himself for particularly no other reason than being his father’s son. And for Umbridge was no one else but a psychopath that freely could shake hands with Voldemort himself. But he figured that she would be too much even for The Dark Lord himself.
The caring note in his voice and his soft, concerned features were just heart-warming and it did things to Draco. It was as if someone really cared about him – Harry of all people. He rubbed his eyes furiously, trying to get the gathering tears dry before they escaped. Harry was quick to grab his hands, gently, taking them away and keeping in place between them.
He walked Blaise to the Floo point, and they hugged before saying their goodbyes. He stood there for a moment longer, hating the idea of going back to the castle. It felt almost normal while having lunch with Blaise. He was his only old friend and meeting with him was so natural. There was nothing awkward about it, even though so much time passed. But now Blaise was gone and they probably wouldn’t meet before the year was over.
He was sure Harry would comment it some way, everyone would jump the occasion to badmouth Lucius Malfoy, no doubt. The more dirt on him the better.
With a small smile on his face he continued reading, Harry never stopped him, only listed in attentively. It was a bit surreal, but so nice at the same time. Having Harry so close to him shouldn’t feel this way. It was nothing but a friendly gesture. There were people that were touchy by nature, and Harry must have been such. But he couldn’t shake off this warm feeling that lingered due to that.
Harry shifted on the bed, moving o his side and pulling Draco in closer to his body. It all felt so right, so normal. And even though he shouldn’t, Draco let himself live a fantasy for a night. As if he was right in sharing ed with Harry, and have a children talk. As if there was point in any of it.
“Welcome to my home,” Harry said. “It’s still not in order. I hope next time you visits it’s more presentable.”
After showering and getting dressed into his coziest, biggest sweater, he went down to have breakfast. There were whole of ten people staying behind for Christmas, not counting him and Harry, most of them from Hufflepuff. They were all in Great Hall already, sitting at one long table that took place of the four usual. Harry was already there, sitting the closest to the entrance, eating and reading The Daily Prophet. He spotted Draco immediately and he smiled widely, waving at him to sit next to him.
“Thank you. For everything. I … no one ever has been so considerate and kind to me like you and Hermione. And you already gave me nice Christmas. The best one I ever had. Besides, back at Hogwarts I have whole Dungeon for myself and there will be Christmas dinner. It doesn’t get better from here,” he said, giving a faint, reassuring smile.
Eventually Draco withdrew, but not too far. They faces were close, eyes locked together. Harry never took his hands off his body, and so didn’t Draco. They were silent, just staring at each other, and he had a strong urge to move his eyes down Harry’s face, to see his big lips framed with two days of hair growth. He wanted so badly to have the brown-haired man pull him in closer, to seal their lips together in the comforting kiss. So they knew they were there for each other. That no shadows of the past and no expectations of future were of concern. That there was just two of them there, no worries.
“Well, of course. It would be a scandal if the Young Master Malfoy would decide that he wasn’t feeling up to have a party for the sake of all the uptight assholes,” he said, sitting next to Draco again.
“I never told her, Draco. I promise you. I would never expose you like that. And I never thought it to be anything short of what it was. I’m in love with you, Draco. I think I have been since that day when we were fifteen. When we were partnered up at potions and you were so good at it, but still smiling gently and blushing whenever you did something good or Severus said your potion was the best in class.”
“I bloody hope you are. I don’t want to talk or think about it anymore. We are having guests for dinner tonight.”
His voice was sad, and Draco could understand it. It felt like Harry really loved Quidditch and had to resign against his own will. It was also sort of weird to hear him speak so openly. For the first time Harry confessed something to him. As if they were really friends. Hermione did confided few things in him, but it was different with Harry. It felt almost intimate. Especially with the mention of war that held so much sadness and pain on its own. He has never talked about it with anyone else than Luna. But it was only twice. With Hermione they didn’t pick up a subject ever since he apologize.
It was just a little painful to watch Harry as he played with his godson, unaware of the things that were going on in Draco’s life, that would much affect his own. And it certainly didn’t help how he felt little flutters in his belly. He wondered if he should tell Harry. Just sprang it on him, not caring about anything else. But something stopped him. Maybe some sort of trauma from before the summer, or simply because Harry said himself he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship with him. And having a baby was far over being in a relationship, wasn’t it?
Harry stood before him, as he sat on the edge of the bed, and pulled off his beige turtleneck that Draco liked so much. His upper body was everything he could imagine. Tanned as the rest of him, tight, but not so defined, muscles visible under the skin, and there were plenty of scars scattered over him. But it wasn’t what he wanted to think about now.
“It’s my bedroom. I reckoned that it would be most useful to have it finished. It was first thing I got fixed once I started working on the house. Before that I slept in Sirius’s bedroom on questionably dusty bed.”
She outstretched her hand to him, and he quickly grabbed Salem and his trunk checking again if he got his money on him, before he took House-elf’s hand.
It wasn’t long before Blaise was knocking at the door. Draco took the cardigan from the wrack and wrap it tightly around himself, seeing Andromeda to the stairs before he opened. They looked at each other for few good moments, before Draco let out quiet ‘Hello’.
He left, without a second look, and ignored his mother’s calling as he made his way back to his room.
“Yes. She was mad at first, but eventually wrote to apologize. She says she understands that not all the relationships work out, and if we are meant to be together, then maybe we will be one day, and if not, that it is okay. And that she don’t want to lose me because she thinks of me as a part of family. Which is nice, and I wish Ron was so understanding. I really want to go to that wedding, but I don’t know … Ron has the ability of making everything awkward.”
“You had enough of learning. You are on top of Slytherin class. And you come at the same level as Hermione in classes we have together. You are already prepared for the NEWTs better than anyone else, so you can have few hours of rest.”
“Thank you. It’s the most amazing gift I’ve ever got. And I’m not lying. I love drawing, I never tried painting but it always seemed fun. And I couldn’t get it for myself, because my father didn’t think it’s a thing for men to do, and even though you would think I have money to spend as I please, I don’t. I need to pay for everything in check so every receipt goes to Gringotts so father knows what I spent every Knut on.”
With just a slight sounds of protests, both Draco and Hermione collected their things, and followed Harry outside. They sat on the stone benches not far away from the entrance, and dug into late lunch that Harry had brought from the kitchen.
“Draco,” he said, sternly. “You know that they are just pieces of crap, and they are not even a bit right, do you? You are great guy.”
Blaise didn’t wait for his answer, he only took his hand and led to the dance floor where few pairs were dancing to the quartet’s music. Draco didn’t object, letting himself be slowly led in the dance.
He nodded, thoughtfully. He couldn’t even imagine it. His grandmother was deceased long before he was even born, but all the stories he heard drew him a nice picture. He wouldn’t want to go anywhere near her. His father used to say she was just as nasty and crazy as Bellatrix, but more to herself and somehow it made her only scarier. And now, hearing what he has, he couldn’t help but dislike her a little more. It also gave him a new light on his mother. She said she never loved Lucius. But he supposed it didn’t change the love for her child that she would be having. It made it all that much clear why she was this way towards him. He could feel a bit of understanding after all these years. He wasn’t sure if he would be this way, but if he tried, he could see why things were how they were.
“Have you ever met my mother,” Draco said. “She would drag me there with pneumonia or Troll-pox. She says that a bit of make-up, few charms, and I will be as good as new. She put too much effort into this ball, and it would be a scandal if she just canceled it, wouldn’t it?”
Harry tensed under his touch, but Draco joined their hands that laid on his chest, in a comforting manner.
Draco couldn’t stop thinking about what he just learned. He didn’t care about Carrow or anyone else. He cared about Harry’s words, the fact that he cared for him. He didn’t want to let his mind wonder places it shouldn’t. That he pulled it to something else than deep friendship.
Andromeda knew about Harry. He had told her the same evening he came to live with her. He couldn’t contain his emotions, crying like he hasn’t in years. She didn’t judge him and she promised to keep his secret.
“Okay. So be it. Just…whenever you are ready to talk, I will be waiting. I guess. Good luck with your NEWTs.”
“Of course. There is only so much they can squint at. Though I can already assume that Ron will make a nice show. Did I tell you that I think he is going out with Katie Bell? I mean, I don’t think, I know. But everyone pretend like they are not. As if it would hurt me, so they are changing the subject whenever I come near. Harry is the same. Why would even care about who Ron snogs? Which, by the way, I saw them do. They weren’t exactly sneaky about it. They were sitting on the stairs to boy’s dormitory.”
out loud, but he wasn’t used to it. It was sort of a taboo, and it sounded almost vulgar in his ears.
“You are perfectly at right to have such feelings towards her, Draco. I am not trying to defend her, no. She did a very awful thing but … she understood that, and she is very sorry. You are her only child, Draco. She wants the best for you and she thought she was doing the right thing,” Andromeda said.
He had no idea where exactly his aunt lived. He only knew the address through the letters, and finding a house of the said address wasn’t that easy. He walked around for a bit before he made up the courage to ask someone for directions. Three different people gave him three different directions which caused him to walk in circles with no results. Finally, a nice old man that was selling fruit, told him the right way, telling him to send his regards to Andromeda. He could cry from happiness if he wasn’t so emotionally exhausted from the emotions the day has brought him when he spotted the mailbox with the correct number and
“What are you wearing?” she said in a low voice. “Elf was supposed to leave the clothes that came from Madame Pirburry in your room.”
He shook his head, blinking away his tears. It all was too much. He didn’t know what to believe, what to even think. He wanted to believe Harry, wanted things between them to go back where they started. But he needed some time before that, to put his own mind in order. And so did Harry, as it seemed. If he was to tell him about the baby right now, supposedly he would be ruining Harry’s progress. More than anything he could understand and cheer for the other. Harry needed some help coming to terms with everything that happened, and Draco was happy that he finally started thinking about himself, trying to help cast the shadows away. And telling Harry about the baby would probably ruin it. One thing was undeniable, Harry had savior syndrome. He was just too nice and too good-hearted. Instead of looking after himself and investing time into his own healing, he no doubts would invest everything into looking after Draco, and that wouldn’t take them anywhere.
Draco rolled his eyes, but let Harry put the notes away as he turned around and sank into the water all way up to his chin. Maybe Harry wasn’t
Nothing made much sense for him anymore. If the things that Ginny said were true, why would Harry go out of his way to see him and explain? Why would he tell her now, not months back as she told Draco? And why would Ginny be so alright with Harry letting her go?
He was sure that he imagined the way Harry slowly moved his way. But it was too brief to really notice, as at the very same moment an paper plane swooshed between their faces and dropped to the table, right on Draco’s drawing. They both moved away quickly, breathing a bit too heavily for it to be just friendly encounter, and Harry quickly grabbed the paper while he was looking around, in fear of someone seeing there. But there was no one. They were still alone.
“I … yeah. Ron is close to being my friend, I suppose. For Weasleys just chocolates and liqueur for their hospitality, and for Teddy because … he is my cousin’s only child. He is only remains of the family I have. It was kind of stupid of me, wasn’t it?”
“I will tell you a story, okay? Don’t take it as a pity party, or anything, and maybe just listen and don’t say anything, if you feel like you might want to say you are sorry, or whatever. I … there was a time, a long time ago, when I didn’t know who I am, didn’t know about magic, anything. And it was time when I was really … sad, very lost. Life wasn’t really the greatest. The people … Muggles I lived with were horrible people. This years, when I was sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs, and even when I attended Hogwarts and knew I had a godfather and slept in a normal room, that was once my cousin’s toy room, because in that life, toys, things, were more important than me, a stupid, good for nothing kid. I … I was always thinking about the future. About doing things I could do to escape there, thinking what job I could land to get money and get the hell out of it. Then with Dumbledore and stuff, when I still had to come back to the Dursleys, I was so angry and lonely, wondering what am I doing wrong that I need to be back there. It didn’t even get easier once I knew I had money. I … fuck, this is really a pity party, I’m going nowhere with it … Ugh … What I mean is that I thought that I was good for nothing, thinking that my faith was already settled. Firstly the faith those Muggles chose for me, as I thought at the time, and then what Dumbledore had planned with me sacrificing myself, guiding my life as he pleased, and all … And it took a long time before I understood that I’m master of my faith, that it wasn’t laid for me. I never had to listen to Dumbledore and anyone else, I never had to listen to prophecies, I could have done whatever I wanted, no matter where it led me or anyone else. But I always let others control my life anyway they wanted. Maybe it’s fine when you are a child, but once you are old enough to make your own decisions it’s good thing to try an fight for yourself, have your own dreams and be your own person. It may be hard, you may fail and all, but there is always day after night.”
“It’s nightmares,” Harry said finally. “And my back. I couldn’t sleep well and it started really hurt and there isn’t much I can do about it.”
He quickly went into spiral of hateful thoughts. Starting with his stupidity of telling Harry so many things about himself, of hugging him, ending somewhere where he couldn’t stop thinking how everyone would be just so much better without him.
“You are great in every other subject, anyway. And I think if you wanted to, you would become a great potion master, so who cares about some charms, right?”
Draco spent the rest of the day at the library, with the trio and Salem, that decided to join. They did endless revisions and homework, before calling it a night. He didn’t bother going back to his room, instead he waited to the very last minute to leave the library, and then spent another half an hour crouching in the shadows of the hallway, wishing that he wouldn’t get caught.
“Yes. I guess the roast didn’t agree with me. Goodnight Teddy.” He went to hug the little boy before Teddy got occupied with toys again.
He sat at his spot, blankly staring at the page before him, not bothering to even read it. He couldn’t believe that Hermione was gone from his life, just like that. He was mad at Harry and for most, he didn’t want to see his face any time soon, no matter how hard he was taking their ‘break up’. No matter how things were and turned out to be, they both were his friends, something that he didn’t know too much in his life, and he treasured it deeply. If anything, Hermione was the best friend he ever had. She was so attentive and helpful, always there when he needed her the most. Luna was close to it, but she had a lot on her own plate, and more often than not, she would run away in her little world, trying to show him how easy things were, when in fact they weren’t. There was a thread of understanding between him and Hermione, it seemed they were just on the same page all the time no matter his depressive thoughts at time.
Spring came faster than anyone suspected. In late March the snow has already melted away, due to hot sun, and some early flowers started to bloom. No one really complained, looking at how tiring the winter was. Many students took advantage of the nice weather and went to explore the grounds.
“Yes. And Blyth is very lovely healer that works at the sanctuary. I met him the Christmas previous year. Charlie introduced him as a friend, but I knew something was up. And now they send the invitation. Molly already wrote me a long letter to tell me how mad she was, but happy at the same time. I don’t blame her. She is very attentive when it comes to her children and Charlie, well, he is a bit closed off.”
Hermione leaned against the tree with book of newest edition of Ancient Runes, while he sat right on the corner of the blanket, legs crossed with cat between them, reading his copy of Pride and Prejudice. Ron was close to his girlfriend, fixing chess board, and Harry laid not far away from Draco, looking effortlessly breathtaking with hands tucked behind his head, sunglasses on, and letting sun heat his face.
“Blaise Zabini. I refused and … we argued. I left and came here. Aunt A was nice enough to let me stay.”
“I fear we had seen it all. In spring and summer there is more animals to see, as some are now asleep or just in places they are warm.”
“Through the Floo. I already asked Headmistress to let me use it. I’m sure she won’t mind you coming with me.”
Soon enough they were at Cornwall, and Ana left, thanking him again and wishing her best. He was left alone with his thoughts, looking at the floor, because looking through the window was giving him motion sickness on top of the ride itself. There were few times when he was sure he would puke, but managed to keep it in.
“I suppose. I just wish it could stop. All the thinking, all the crap I have in my head. I want to be happy with how things are. With good memories I have. Hell, can I really complain about things now? I mean, it sucks to be an orphan, but at some point I had loving parents, which many people didn’t even have that much. And now? I have money, I have beautiful house, I mean it will be beautiful once it is redone. I can do
“I’m not sure, Aunt. I … am I the bad person because I’m sort of … scared of her? I know it is stupid. She did not do anything. But …”
“If it isn’t a trouble, could I have some mint tea,” he said, halfway through his meal. He could feel that it didn’t necessarily agree with his stomach, but he wouldn’t go and ask for something else.
They were sitting a little bit too close, Blaise a bit too much leaned in to him over the table, and Draco was blushing, which he shouldn’t.
“Of course I want to. But … are you sure? You know how things are. And I wouldn’t forgive myself if I hurt. If I did something you may regret later.”
Being a daughter of such people, destined to marry whoever they chose, growing up with the only purpose of being married and having an heir. He wouldn’t put it past Lucius to think he could take advantage of her though he didn’t know his father all that well, especially his younger self. And all in all, to be pregnant at seventeen, coming from such a conservative family, just to have your baby forcefully snatched from you, to carry on like nothing ever happened, to marry the said man and have a child. But a child only to fulfill the duty of having an heir. It was just sick, and all of the sudden, he couldn’t blame his mother all that much for the distance she put between them. He wasn’t sure how he would act in such a situation. And he would never want to know.
He looked up at the brown-haired man, eyes wide. Harry was standing right next to him, hand on the chair, smiling widely.
, meeting people that supposedly weren’t going to whisper or point fingers and nasty looks at him. But it was just wishful thinking. If Harry didn’t say it to make him feel better, and Weasleys agreed to having him over, it meant they were just such goodhearted people. But there was no need into straining that. He was who he was, no use trying to pretend the truth was different.
His mother would go nuts once she knew. Even thinking about it now, he knew that getting rid of it, even though it was an option, was not going to happen. It was his, and Harry’s, baby. That was it. He was having and keeping it. There was no other way out, it never crossed his mind, no matter how shocking and life-wrecking the news seemed.
Draco felt a bit foolish as sudden tears prickled his eyes. He  quickly blinked them off, before intertwining his fingers with Harry’s. He didn’t like thinking about the past, especially the darkest years and certain people. Like this one.
for an answer. He wanted me to be little posh dog that would do anything he wanted. And I never did. He want me to be friends with you, to treat people that didn’t do anything wrong to me as if they were below us. He always made me play with Crabbe and Goyle who were such awful bullies. It got worst when
His whole body felt sore. Some spots were worst, radiating with sharp pain. The worst parts were his stomach, face and left leg. He opened his eyes, blinking slowly, trying to understand what was going on.
“You know that whatever he says, whatever he thinks, doesn’t define you, right? Just because it’s expected of you by your family, doesn’t mean you
“Of course I am. Actually, it’s him that said it first. We tried to talk it out and pretended like we did, but I know we didn’t, and it’s high time it ended. I have more important things going on right now, like NEWTs, worrying about internship, getting into good program. I don’t need fighting and worrying about Ron.”
To take his mind off of it, he decided to talk again. Something that maybe wasn’t all that light, but something wanted to know about.
October 1981. At least now I can go visit their grave. I couldn’t do it with everything going on. I was seventeen when I went there for the first time. It’s a bit weird because it’s hard to grief over someone you never knew. But they were my parents, my family. My mother basically sacrificed herself for me, which for a long time I questioned but that’s beside the point, and I kept hearing all those things about them, how amazing people they were. The most I regret that I don’t have much more to remember them by. I have only few photos and a piece of memories from Snape’s past. Which weren’t all that pleasant memories.”
“I swear to God. What is wrong with them both? Ginny and Ron, I mean. They act like two biggest brats. They always had a big ego, but that is beyond anything,” Hermione whispered, heatedly.
“So,” Andromeda started, putting down her cutlery. “We are going to have a guest for dinner tonight.”
With autumn in it’s fullest, Halloween passed, and Christmas approaching faster than anything, Draco found himself caught in the overflowing amount of homework, essays, and learning for the midterms. He barely ever left the library, though now there wasn’t much time for reading his favorite books as he was too busy with actual school work. On top of that he had his assistance to Slughorn taking up many hours every week, so he barely ever saw Hermione for anything other then revising their knowledge. He didn’t even take the invitation to go to Hogsmeade with her and Harry, siblings having Quidditch practice that day, because he felt exhausted and wanted nothing more than to sleep away whole Saturday. And so he did.
But just a moment later Harry wasn’t close anymore, having moved away from him, in rush, hearing some rustle not far away. He heard it too, and got slightly startled, in fear someone might have caught them.
Author reccomends to listen to this song while reading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm_-cbNLNpk (All I've Ever Known by Bahamas) because it's such a mood and works perfectly for this chapter, especially after the first *.
“She approached me and told me you told her about us. That you apologized to her and said everything between us was just one big lie.”
He went to his room, surprisingly not in the mood to cry at all. He turned on the wireless, already set on his favorite station of classic music and late-night reading of poems and books. As he was lying in bed, cuddling Salem as if he was a plushie, he couldn’t help but wonder if he was doing the right thing.
“Hermione said you wanted to be alone. Did something happen? And are you alright? I haven’t seen you in days and that fall. Did…”
“I’m sorry that he had to go so soon. And that it was because of my aunt. I wish you had more time with him…”
Draco suddenly hated the way Harry looked at him, so attentively and carefully, as if he was the center of the world at the moment. Harry was this way, paying him all the attention when they were together. Now, unlike anytime else, he didn’t want that attention.
He wrapped his arms around Harry, cradling him in a tight hug. There wasn’t much he could do other than to assure him that everything was alright, and that Harry wasn’t alone.
He had no idea how he managed to get through all of his NEWTs without a mental breakdown, and sill think he did somehow acceptable of a job. It ended up to be a big blur filled with switching off his brain to work mode, and going to sleep after his tests of the day were done. It became his new tactic. Switching off his brain and sleeping it off. Just to not think, to not fall into the pit of grief over his lost friendships or fear of upcoming return to the Manor.
He was on the edge of crying, something in his chest tightening. He didn’t say anything, keeping his eyes on the evening sun, even when Harry stood next to him and he could feel the green eyes boring into him.
Draco could feel more tears running down his cheeks. He wanted to say so many things, but Harry said against it. Instead, not thinking what he was doing, he leaned in and hugged Harry tightly, clutching to him.
It wasn’t all that big of a lie. He was excited about working his dream job. He was just a bit more excited about having their baby.
“It’s alright, Draco. You are my guest. And I don’t mind sleeping in that room. It isn’t half bad. I’ve slept in worse places than that.”
“I do not see anything against it, now,” Blaise said. “Unless … are you with your child’s father? Are you getting married?”
Thank you so much for reading! And I am extremly sorry for not uploading chapter in time, but I had pretty rough week and only now manged to get back on track. Anyway, I hope you loved this chapter! I wrote the ending first, the whole thing in the Room of Requirements, and now, re-reading it...it's  just amazing, really. Make sure to let me know how you liked the chapter and what you think about Harry's acting and confession. Like, I don't want to spoil anything, and it isn't a spoiler really, but I want to make clear that it is a confession, that he have this deep feelings for Draco, but he is too scared to let go of Ginny because even though he doesn't love her, she is his safe haven with whole Weasley fam.
I hope you liked it, lovelies! I am not sure how I feel about this, but I say it isn't the worst. Things are taking turns, don't they? I must say, I was planning this part to come out a bit different, but I certainly like it much more this way. Also, somehow, the part where Mrs. Neighbor takes Draco for a girl is my favorite - don't ask me why.
I hope you liked the chapter! It's a tiny bit ... I don't know, weird, but it's probably because things are progressing finally. And sorry for those who ship Hermione and Ron! I don't even know why I've done this, but it is what it is now! Make sure to let me know what you think of the chapter. And also sorry to all of you that were commenting without having an account, but due to some circumstance I've decided to change the comments for registered users only.
Hermione shook her head and vigorously stabbed her food with fork, eating it fiercely as if it was at fault, not her ex-boyfriend.
Draco smiled compassionately, giving the invitation back. He knew it was off the subject, but at that moment his mind drifted to wishing that Mrs. Weasley was so understanding with Harry. That he could broke up with Ginny, and still have his substitute family, as if nothing ever happened. So they could be really together. But he knew it wouldn’t be happening. Firstly, because Harry was too scared. Secondly, because Ron was Ron, while Ginny was beloved only daughter, and having her heart broken would be entirely different story.
On the Christmas Day Draco woke up feeling lighter than he did in a long while. There was not even one Slytherin staying behind so he could roam freely around the Common Room, not worrying about anyone. He woke up before five, just to savor each and every moment of peace and quiet. He sat on the sofa, in front of fireplace and beautiful Christmas Tree, reading his book and petting Salem. His mother didn’t even bother to send him a Christmas gift this year, and he didn’t care one bit. It was the last thing on his mind. Just before his departure for breakfast a single gift, wrapped in most bazaar wrapping, appeared under the tree. He was quite sure it was from Luna, and he wasn’t mistaken. He read the card attached to it, wishing him best Christmas and making sure to watch out for mysterious Manten-somethings that lived in the snow and loved attaching to one’s shoes to be taken home and cause trouble.
Every week Andromeda would take the boy to a healer that helped kids adjusting to their Metamorphmagus skills, and today was Teddy’s usual appointment. It was quite a trip since it was in London, but Draco didn’t mind one bit. He would appreciate having a bit of lonely time to cry while baking a pie.
or something in the same lines. He didn’t care about all the other Slytherins, not anymore at least. He had his friends and that was all he needed.
Is this chapter late two weeks? Yes. Is the author extremly guilty and sorry? Yes. Will they step up their game? They shall try, but won't promise anymore. Anyway, please enjoy the chapter! It's adorable and sad in just two thirds!
“I am. Trust me. It will be nice. Much nicer than eating Christmas dinner here with teachers. That I would very much like to avoid.”
“I wanted to apologize to you. I acted like an asshole, I hurt you so much. I just want you to know that … you were, and still are, the most important person in my life and someday, when the time is right, I would like to try and have it all back.”
“I…please, tell them to go. Tell them I don’t want to see them,” he said, feeling his heart beating fast, breath erratic. He was so scared of what Ginny may do. More than anything he wanted Hermione and Harry with him now, but that was out of question. Their relationships were bound to end, so it didn’t matter it came to the halt so soon and abruptly. It hurt like hell, but it didn’t change anything.
His mother was a whole other story. As much as he was terrified of telling her, she made it easy by never being there. They just had breakfasts and dinners together, and other than that she was out and about, doing her own things, while he lounged around in the solace of his own room.
Water never was going cold, staying in it’s perfect temperature, keeping him warm and relaxed. He could just fall asleep like this, or never go out. That wouldn’t be so terrible.
, that he found in the library, and sneakily swiped the covers with harmlessly looking novel. Salem was curled up on his chest, and the fire from the nearby mantle was giving cozy warmth. It was the middle of the summer, but Manor had it to itself that it was chilly and gloomy through the whole year, so the fire was always handy. He dropped his favorite summer activity of spending the whole day on the blanket in the fields, a while ago as summer heat and the sun made him all too lightheaded, nauseous, and tired.
“Yes. And they were still there. They run away into the woods and I needed to get you back to school instead of chasing them. It wasn’t hard to know who it was. I checked my memory few times and I knew all the faces. Carrow, two other Slytherins and one Gryffindor. I told Headmistress that I didn’t know who did it, that they were already gone once I found you. She didn’t believe me, obviously, but let me have a free hand. I think she also knew how it would end if she went on to reprimand them. So … I took care of it. Which wasn’t easy, because suddenly all of them were missing classes or disappearing before I got chance to get them. But then Salem came in handy. I don’t know how he knew but he managed to get Carrow out of the Dungeons. I don’t know how he did it, but that prick was running out of there as if he saw some monster. Anyway … you have nothing to worry about. I promise you. They won’t lay hand on you and I made sure they spread the word around that it is high time to leave you alone.”
He felt as if the whole world shrunk just to him, and there was nothing else but the sound of blood running through his veins, giving out a rustle as loud as a church bell.
“I can’t believe it was two years already,” he said. “Just four more years and my father will be out of Azkaban.”
Harry got to his feet to check the bushes it came from, while Draco sat down to do his shirt. His heart was beating fast, and cheeks were burning. It was only now that it got to him what just happened. He let Harry touch him in such an intimate way. In the open space, of all places. Where anyone could come by and see. Did he had no shame whatsoever? It didn’t sound like him one bit, but he also couldn’t find it in him to regret anything. It was nice. And he craved Harry’s every touch and stroke of affection.
“It’s alright. You couldn’t have known. No one does. Just Hermione. She was going through books, trying to come up with something but it just won’t happen. I’m okay with that, though. I got used to the idea.”
"You are different. I mean you are acting different. You are so quiet and deep in your thoughts. Did something happen?"
He smiled at Hermione as she passed him his iced butter beer. It has been a while since he last came to Hogsmeade, and ever longer since he came with his friends. Him, Hermione, Luna and Neville were sitting in one of the booths, having finished with their shopping. He didn’t went to shop this Saturday, having particularly no reason. Instead he was waiting for them at Three Broomsticks, drawing and having downed two iced butter beers already.
Harry looked utterly shocked and he couldn’t continue drawing his face anymore, so he focused on unruly hair.
The greenhouse was one of his favorite spots in the whole house, and he would solemnly miss it once he was moved out. It wasn’t too big, but it held the most splendid green plants in various sizes and shapes. It was here before he was even born. A little corner of this damned house that was full of life.
He wanted to roll his eyes and slide down the chair in the most dramatic fashion. He wondered whether Minister himself was coming, or he would have twelve different people to deal with.
Draco laughed softly, imagining Harry in such slippers. He let Harry lead the way to the office, saying a shy ‘good day’ to Professor McGonagall. Harry and her chatted for a while, before she left called for by Professor Finnick. They walked to the fireplace.
He looked away at the sight of Harry pulling off his school vest. He went back to sitting with his back to him, sinking into the water so much it covered his lips and almost touched the lower lip. He didn’t look at Harry even for a moment but he could hear him take off his clothes, walk and then sink into the water few feet away. Draco still stubbornly looked ahead of him.
Draco smiled gently, resting his head in the crook of Harry’s neck. It was so sad to hear to most of Har’s stories, this one being no exception, but he enjoyed the level of closeness it brought them.
Eagerly, he pushed away all the books and parchments, letting Hermione present him with the food. What surprised him was the fact that she got food for herself too. It wasn’t that uncommon lately for her to be spending dinner time with him, missing it completely or going to the Great Hall at the end. But they never ate together in the library. It was Draco-sort-of-thing.
“Ana is going to Cornwall. She is going to see sea and sea birds and visit her friend,” she explained.
Harry sat there for a moment longer and it seemed that he wanted to say something else, but words and logic failed him. Eventually he just lifted from his chair and left, eyes fixed on the floor and it weirdly looked as if Harry wasn’t really there.
He turned around to face Harry, seeking green eyes with his silver. Harry wasn’t smiling, he was looking at him attentively, with something that Draco wanted to read as deep adoration and even more. With love. He was the first one to lean in for the kiss. Now, perhaps for the first time in a long time, he felt good. Like he was in the place where he belonged. Where he could be himself, let his guard down, not to be scared of what was going to happen to him next. And that was a big potential problem. Considering Harry a missing piece that made him feel at home, because it was people that created the home, was a wrong idea. Because it was only temporary.
, what might have been the most embarrassing and nerve-wrecking thing in his whole life. She just nodded, giving the rest of the week off to get himself in shape after the incident. So, in the end, he had full of four days off and wouldn’t have to get to class until Monday, having his meals delivered to the dorm, curtesy of the Elves. Which gave him potentially enough time to come to terms with things and come up with some plans, but at the same time not enough at all.
He carried on with making the table and put the kettle on for tea. Salem, seeing there was no threat, resumed eating his tuna just to warm himself a spot in Harry’s lap moments later. At first, they didn’t talk at all. Harry sat at the table, watching him intensely and petting Salem. And they didn’t talk for a good few minutes when tea was served, and Draco was sitting in front of him in uncomfortable silence.
Therefor he found himself tagging behind Hermione, Ron and Harry on the Friday noon, just after their classes, and before their last period that would be only before dinner. He was carrying his fluffiest, greenest blanket, bag filled with sweets and books and Salem. They reached the outskirts of the Lake where they seated their blankets in the shadow of the tree. Weather this year was really unlikely. Draco couldn’t remember when was the last time one could step outside at this time of year to be blessed with sun instead of heavy rain.
It was already middle of April, and they were running out of time. Draco was sure that the closer they got to NEWTs, the less time him and Harry would have for each other, both too busy with learning, and after the NEWTs ... it was over. They time would be up.
“L-L-Look at me. I’m a mess. I w-won’t be able to talk to them. I would be too stressed. And they hate me. Don’t say they don’t. Your girlfriend hates me, Ron barely tolerates me, and everyone else have no reason to like me either. My father … my father was who he was. He had done terrible things that led to deaths of many people. He supported V-Voldemort. And he was always mean to Weasleys. Why would they want me at their Christmas? A Malfoy. Spoiling the time with their family.”
Draco felt excitement growing inside of him. He had heard of those animals, he didn’t live under the rock exactly, but he always thought they lived in their natural habitat only. It never crossed his mind that huge elephant could be found in London. All he had ever seen were some magical creatures in the circus when he was little. Wizarding world didn’t care about lions or cheetahs or whatever else. They were more interested in five-heads dogs and unicorns and whatever else they got their hands on.
He turned around to see a woman approaching him from the neighboring house. She was short and plump with short brown hair, smiling widely as she was wiping hands into a tea towel. He quickly understood that by
“Yes. I felt awful, though. Madame Pomfrey said I had internal bleeding and broken leg. I … I can’t even imagine walking back into the Dungeon. It’s just horrifying.”
It was crazy, really, how Harry made him feel. It was the kind of love that he read in books about. And now, experiencing it, it felt magnificent. Something he wanted to last forever, but he knew was bond to end soon.
. Don’t look at me like that. Hermione told me that. My point is, that it’s the same for us that have been brought up in pure- or half-blood families. It isn’t common, though. And frowned upon, because if you are the one to
It was just how things worked, especially in Wizarding community. They were all from different places, hundreds of kilometers apart, and even though they could Apparate and Floo, it was easy to stop keeping track on it, finding excuses not to. If people weren’t sharing the same circles, liked him and Blaise and other purebloods for example, it simply didn’t work. He knew Blaise, Pansy, even Carrow, whole his life, and if he wasn’t to step away from this life, he would continue to have more encounters with them than his actual friends.
Harry’s mouth was back on his in matter of moment, kiss changing in its pace and being much more intimate. He felt fingers working his tie undone completely, and then opening his shirt, button by button. Chill air made the goosebumps appear on his skin, nipples prickling with sensation due to the cold, in most pleasant way. He felt hot blush splashing his cheeks as Harry moved slightly to take a look at his naked chest, pushing his shirt open. He had a faint smile on his lips, but there was nothing less than adoration in his eyes. His hand stayed at Draco’s chest and they were kissing again, Harry’s warm, rough hand travelling over his sensitive skin, finding its place on his left peck, fingers tracing over his nipple, sending little sparks of warm pleasure through his body.
They sat in the same spot as the last time, and Draco had to say that it was even nicer than it was before. With only Hermione and Harry he felt far more comfortable. He spoke much more, especially since Harry barely took part in the conversation, seemingly deep in his thoughts, spacing out many times. It reminded him of Luna sometimes, but there was so much hurtful feelings in his eyes, that Luna didn’t have in her.
He flipped pages of his notebook and found the small panting hidden there. It was very colorful watercolor painting of the meadow, woods in the background, a man – one that he tried to not base on Harry – sitting in the grass and flowers. Harry examined the painting, smile forming on his lips.
He agreed, though he wasn’t exactly convinced. It was true that the weather was just amazing for the middle of October. And idea of the picnic seemed more than appealing, but idea of adding there more people than Hermione, wasn’t. He would gladly be there just with her, but at the same time it wasn’t big deal either.
As if it was nothing, he placed his chin on Draco’s thigh, eyes fixed on the book. He looked down at the mop of dark hair, as if Harry gone mad. What he thought he was doing exactly?
“Yes and yes. I was wondering … can you tell me about Sirius? It seems he was a big part of your life, and I don’t know much about him.”
. It was as if Harry expected him to be around longer, long enough to have him as a guest in his own house that could take ages before being properly livable and for people to see. Absolutely despite Draco’s wishes, he felt his heart swell and warmth spread in his chest. He wouldn’t mind sticking around more. And especially wouldn’t mind being frequent guest at Harry’s house.
“Oh, shush. Now. Let’s eat and finish our homework. I haven’t got a chance to start on mine yet. I stayed behind after classes to discuss the grade I got on my essay.”
“Mm. Yes. I just … I was so mad. That Ministry wanted to make me some delusional freak and, to that, stop us from learning how to defend ourselves. It was pure madness.”
“It’s okay, Draco. It’s just me. I am not going to judge you, or anything. So there is no need to be so nervous. I am your friend, not a threat.”
“Don’t even let me begin about what your little scene could cost us. I am trying to put this family out there again, step up in this bloody ladder, and you do something like this. I swear to Merlin, Draco. Have I ever done anything bad to you to treat me like this? I always have your best interest as a goal. I ask nothing of you but one appearance, and you are making it a source of all the gossips at today’s breakfast and next social occasion.”
“We are going to sit with them,” the Weaselette announce, interrupting Neville. She was already sliding out of her place, pulling Harry by hand.
“I had fun. Sort of. I read a book I found. I suppose nothing here would show Muggles in right light.”
“Are you alright? I’m sorry I didn’t come to see you at the Hospital Wing, I had some things to take care of.”
“I have no idea. We don’t talk or exchange letters. He got it slightly better, I suppose. He surrounded himself. He went to the Aurors, and handed is wand. If it wasn’t for that, he would never see the outside, I suppose. He gets to have two visits a year, two hours each. It is always my mother that goes. He never asked for me. He hates me, actually.”
“I got a very nice pair of hand knitted-or-something slippers in most … pink color I had ever seen. But they are very nice and cozy, so no complains.”
He decided to put this year’s ball into the back of his mind, pretending it didn’t exist until necessary. He was spread on the sofa in the main sitting room, reading a tome of
“Oh, but she left three days ago! She and Teddy left to visit her friends in Devon. Did she forget you were coming to see her? And who are, darling?”
It all sounded so nice, but there was one problem – there was no Harry in his future, and that was a main down of every plan he could make. It almost felt pointless, to fight with his mother, and possibly father, to go against their word, to not marry out of convenience, to build something on his own. But even without Harry, the prospect of a small flat and his own Apothecary was much more pleasant than marrying some posh old man and living in another huge, empty mansion, having some awful man touch him. No, there was o way in the latter, at least he was convinced so for now.
He felt and heard the water rustle and moments later he could feel Harry’s body next to his, his wet hands coming to take the notes and self-writing quill away.
Harry was already waiting for him, his own black bag on his shoulder, and Draco had to admit that he looked immensely handsome in beige turtleneck, long black coat and Gryffindor scarf wrapped around his neck loosely.
“I see. That’s nothing to be ashamed of. I’ve seen many people try and fail, but with enough hard work it is bound to happen. I had difficulty with it myself. If you want, I would be more than happy to help you.”
“Because it would be even worse. McGonagall won’t do anything. It will be just like that until school ends.”
They went through the portrait hole, the portrait of The Fat Lady letting out a startled shrink as Harry spoke the password out of thin air. They passed the empty common room and went all the way upstairs to the room at the end of the corridor. Only in the comfort of two-bed room, with door securely closed, they dropped the Invisibility Cloak.
Draco nodded, even though the other wasn’t looking his way. He was not expecting that. Most of the times they met, they went to the Prefects Bathroom or The Room of Requirement, even fewer times. So, to go to Harry’s room, all way in the Gryffindor tower, felt so strange, yet almost pleasant. It was almost like visiting at Harry’s home. Well, Hogwarts was sort of his home for duration of ten months, so it seemed only fitting. But back when he visited Grimmauld Place, they were friends. Maybe even less than that at the time. And now, they were in sort of a relationship, which changed things entirely.
Blaise didn’t push the subject further, instead carrying on with the conversation about his work that Draco started. He had to admit that it was pleasant. He was happy to meet Blaise after such a long time, and that there were no sort of tension between them. He didn’t have even a slightly hard time speaking. It was so easy with Blaise, and he wanted it to last a bit longer. He didn’t need to worry about anything, about anyone peering over the corner, ready to say something nasty to him or to start some new rumor. And even if there were, he didn’t care one bit.
“I share room only with Ron now. And he promised he wouldn’t come back. I think he sneaked out to The Room of Requirement.”
“I-I live here now,” he said quietly, finding his words. “Aunt A and Teddy are in London for Teddy’s weekly appointment. Sit down. Do you want something to drink?”
He made his way back to the school. The sky was dark shade of grey, bathing everything around in shadows. Somewhere in the middle of the walk back, when the snow started falling for what felt like thousandth time this winter, he heard some laughter and loud voices not far behind him. He picked up his steps, perfectly aware whose voices they were. It wasn’t long before he heard his name being called, along a chain of insults. He cursed himself for not looking for Hermione in the village, but it wouldn’t be the first time he went this route on his own. But until now nothing really happened. It was just his damned luck.
Draco moved closer to him, taking his hand into his own and squeezing it reassuringly. He them moved even closer, leaning his body against Harry’s, head coming to rest on his broad chest. Harr wrapped arms around his form, stroking his hair with one hand.
“That’s … unfortunate, sorry to hear. But Muggles made movie about it. Like that Grinch movie, but about this ship sinking.”
Discussing his mother at the moment was the last thing on his mind. He was perfectly content with looking into the space ahead.
She passed the handle to Draco, and he looked at it puzzled before taking it, and putting it to his ear as she did. He could hear some creaking in the receiver and the distant sound of people. He was silent for a long moment, words failing him.
pregnant, they just look and treat you like a woman, basically. Especially in pure-blood families. They already treat me like one. There are either two roles in marriage and in this world. A provider, or a child-bearer. Guess where am I. My father is very happy, as you may imagine. Always was happy to have a heir to carry on family name and now, with me, Malfoy name is going to die in couple of years.”
They bid him goodbye and he was on his way to the dungeons, dreaming of nothing more than hot shower and bed. But that wasn’t happening. Too many Slytherins in the common room.
He followed Harry further into the house where it only looked more like a construction site. Everything they passed looked empty, raw, some spots already renewed. But there was barely any furniture, light put out everywhere. And it was so cold, almost as much as it was outside. Getting a house tour from Harry, no crazy House Elves in sight, he couldn’t stop thinking about the words from few minutes back.
No matter how much it hurt him, he had to get over it. He knew that him and Harry were bound to break from the beginning. There was no reason of crying over it, especially since it was just big, fat lie.
“Anyway,” Draco said after a long moment of thoughtful silence. “What are you doing here? I don’t mean to be impolite, but it’s Saturday, and you are always busy working at this hour.”
By the end of her speech Hermione’s face was red and she looked at edge of tears, so he did the only thing he knew, and hugged the girl. She did the same, sniffling only a bit.
“Have you purchased the book I told you about?” Hermione asked, not caring for politeness. “I was serious, it will really help you with getting a better score at your Transfiguration.”
Draco just nodded. He really liked the idea of spending Christmas outside of the castle, especially with his friends. He hoped he wouldn’t be too big of a bargain, though, but he trusted Harry and his reassuring words.
“What is wrong with me, Salem,” he sighed heavily, flopping to his side to cradle the cat in tight hug. He got a snark in response. “Thank you very much. You are not helpful at all.”
Hermione was as immersed by the school work as him, so they spend most of their time together, at the library. The girl refused to spend more time at the Gryffindor Common Room than needed.
"You know. Just the usual," Harry said, shrugging his shoulders, visibly reluctant to go into the details.
Draco leaned in to shush him with a gentle kiss. Harry seemed surprised but gave it back, his lips moving slowly in answer. The kiss carried on, slow and not rushed, the conversation dissolving. They didn’t need that kind of negativity between them. Especially since it was all in the past. He didn’t want to even think about what Harry went through, and how it still reflected on him to this day.
He was stunned, at lost of words. He thought that Harry just got him to the Hospital Wing to have him taken care of. But this … it was something he would never expect. Not only because Harry was just his friend, and he didn’t have anyone that would stand up for him, ever, but also because it didn’t sound like Harry.
She was mad at him. For appearing in the clothes she didn’t choose and fleeing the party in so many emotions. He was surprised that she wasn’t reading Prophet’s article about pathetic Draco Malfoy in tears, out loud.
He swallow thickly, trying to regain his sense, and calm down his crazy beating heart, moving eyes from Harry to his book. He could do it. It wasn’t a big deal.
“I do not love you. I never knew you were interested in me. You always were my best friend, and I will always be fond of you in that way. But it wouldn’t be fair towards any of us to be in a relationship. I love someone else, and I am going to have a baby with him. It is complicated but … I just cannot do it.”
Hermione was already at their usual spot, two feet tall stack of notes on her left, and a parchment, where she was scribbling away, before her.
And Draco would be left alone, with only Salem at his side, trying to desperately put his life together and not go crazy. Trying to fight off all the predictions and expectations his family had of him, which was already proving hard, even though it didn’t came to it yet. All he would have would be memories of one school year when he had two new, amazing friends, one of them being the love of his life that he had a chance to experience in its fullest, not only admire from afar.
“You finally woke up, Mr. Malfoy,” Mrs. Pomfrey’s voice brought him back from heavy thinking. She was quick to get to his side with a tray filled with potions. He wasn’t looking forward drinking any of it.
“Yeah. I mean … I did like it. I really did. But I shouldn’t have done it here and like that. We are outside, and anyone could just be passing by. I didn’t think. I am really sorry. I didn’t mean to … risk exposing you like this.”
He didn’t wait for the words of answer, only rushed back to the castle and then to the Dungeon. He hated being at school, with all the Slytherins and other people that despised him, having to hide in the corners. But here was better than home. Here he wasn’t alone, left for his own thoughts twenty four hours every day. His mother was out of it, in her own world as she has been his whole life. Back at the Manor there was no Hermione or Harry or Luna, and he doubted that neither of first two would contact him ever again once the school ended. Harry wouldn’t, for obvious reasons. He had some faith in Hermione, but she would forget him rather quickly, he was sure. There was no way he would be able to meet with her, and he had a feeling that once his mother would catch wind of letters from Muggleborn, it would be the end of it. Luna was his only hope, but she and her father were leaving to Nova Scotia and then to Norway in search of some mystical, non-existing things that he didn’t remember the name of. So, Luna too would be too busy to see him or write more than every other month.
In the perfect world, his parents would be angry just for a moment, and come to terms with it, support him. They would let him stay at the Manor as long as he needed, supporting him financially and mentally. He would get his Potioneer diploma, open his little Apothecary and move out to his own place, with the baby. And he would be perfectly happy with her or him, having his dream job.
Even thought of such simple thing made a small smile appear on his face. Oh Merlin, when did he become so simple?
Moments like this, when he thought about the baby, about the scary future, he couldn’t help but have his mind drift to Harry. After all, Harry was the father of his child. Which felt so unreal that he had a hard time wrapping his mind around it, despite being perfectly aware that there was no other possibility.
“No,” he said fast. His blush got even more dark. He lifted his eyes, shily, to look into green ones. “It’s not because I can’t do a Patronus. It’s because I can’t cast anything. Some minor spells work sometimes, but most of the times it’s just few sparks and it dies down. I … I have seen many people through last few years, but they all say the same – it sometimes happens and there is faint chance it will come back. That’s why I’m doing essay for Charms. I always do. Professor McGonagall came up with this solution.”
He blushed faintly, ripping through the paper of one of the wrappings. He had purchased a very old book on potions for the other. He remembered Harry telling him about how he got into potions once he could focus on his studies and Slughorn was teaching them. One of the times they went to Hogsmeade as a group and walked into the bookstore, Harry had picked up that book. It contained many hand notes, had recipes of very rare and powerful potions and iy picked his interest, but due to distraction (being Ginny making him leave with her to Three Broomsticks) he didn’t buy the book. Instead Draco did, having Christmas in mind.
He just nodded, looking away from intense green eyes. He wanted to say so many things, but he found himself unable. It was as if they first met the previous semester, when he couldn’t let a single ‘yes’ slip through his throat. And now it was the worst possible moment. Because he wanted to tell Harry he
At once they stood up and started packing, rushing towards the castle. They didn’t get a chance to run too far when the heavy rain and cold wind hit them with great force, making them wet at the spot. As usual, Salem was tripping him, in sake of trying to find the hiding spot from the heavy rain, but he was too busy with the basket and trying to protect the book he got from the library and didn’t want to ruin.
be doing it with Ginny. Draco was his friend if anything, and being friend didn’t mean taking one to see your place or spend the day sightseeing, going to the movies.
For few moments he considered telling Harry. It would make things so easy, he figured. He would dump the Weaselette, and they would be together. Three of them. Draco liked the sound of it, and maybe, just maybe he would do that. Only if the circumstance were different. First of all, if he wasn’t who he was.
Choked up on emotions, Ana put on the blouse that was way too big for her, and the silk would no doubt be wasted away in no time from being pulled on the ground. But who would care of the matter? Ana was free and he was close to being too.
“Fine. Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, Charms, Transfiguration and Care for Magical Creatures. You?”
Tears were running down his face, and he couldn’t stop them any longer. He had spent so many nights thinking about it, dwelling over the fact that the most amazing thing in his life turned out to be a lie.
Please, enjoy this chapter! It is rather short and rather chaotic, but I poured a lot of love inside!
“No. Don’t be. I’m glad you had so much fun. It reminds me a bit of myself, back in the day. When I first came to the zoo and all. I haven’t been to the cinema until last year. But I figure I take those things for granted, still finding this bazaar that wizards don’t know what zoo or telly is.”
Also, I decided to keep a tiny schedule to have you know when to look here for a new chapter, so I will be posting new chapter every Friday, but there shall be extra updates sometimes.
The way she was looking at Draco made him feel conscious. His first thought was that his mother was coming. And he didn’t like this idea. Sending money and asking for updates on him was one thing. But coming over for dinner was the other. He didn’t want her anywhere near him. There was some weird sense of self-preservation in him.
Luckily, before he could get scolded or send away to change, a family that he didn’t care to remember came to wish him a happy birthday, and rant about their new summer house. He had to face a few of such encounters before he could walk away in search of Blaise. It was so pathetic. Having a birthday party and not be able to talk to anyone. What was even worse was the fact that from one moment to another, he started noticing more and more fellow Slytherins, which made his last year of school a living hell.
Draco was still in awe, looking through the balcony and Harry took this moment to lay down the blanket he got from the thin air.
“Let’s hope she won’t. So, anyway, we will Floo there. It’s in London. I thought we could go after breakfast and go for a stroll around the town, maybe see a movie, and then go to Weasley’s? I just need to have you know that my place is crap. It was empty for years before Sirius moved back there and then it was empty again, and I have people working on it, but I don’t think it looks much better.”
He stood in the entrance to the kitchen, looking extremely handsome and put together. His hair was pulled back, seemed freshly cut, and even though he had stubble, it didn’t make him look any less fresh and clean. He was wearing a black turtle neck and light-wash jeans and that black coat. And he made Draco feel just how much he missed and needed him there throughout this whole time.
“I suppose that if you put so much effort in it, I would let you stay. But don’t slip like this again, promise?”
With a final deep breath he walked downstairs to the ballroom, that was beaming with people. He started looking for his mother, and he could swear he saw a flash of red hair two times.
“Don’t … Don’t say it, Draco. I can’t … you can’t marry someone you don’t know, someone your parents set you up with. You deserve the world. Nothing short of it. And to think that you would marry some pureblood psycho, that would treat you God-knows how badly … you can’t let that happen.”
“Welcome to the Knight Bus. My name is Stan Shunpike and I will be your conductor today. Get in, get in. Let me take that for you.”
Then there was very stupid scenario that Harry planted in his mind – drawing someone’s nude picture. Harry’s nude picture. Just thinking about it made him blush. Not that he imagined it per se. He would never even want to imagine. It was too awkward, too embarrassing. But just the idea itself … no, it was still too much.
“Now, we can talk,” Harry said. He had settled himself couple of feet away from Draco, turned towards him.
In the end movie was almost as much fun as the zoo. It was nothing close to the pictures his governess took him when he was a child or the ones he had a chance to go to with Blaise. Those ones were just so … bland compared to muggle thing. They were all centered around the wizards, magic, things he already knew. They were all so boring and unnecessarily long and no fun at all. Places where they showed them were no fun either. There were no snacks, no posters, no nice smell of food, and definitely no hot, buttery popcorn and overly sugary, fizzy drink. It was so much fun that he felt sad that he never got to be to such a place earlier. But what made it better was the fact that he could be there with Harry of all people, for his first time.
“We are wizards, Harry. It’s almost cute how little you know about this world even at this age. But yes,
"Who are you and what did you do with Hermione Granger?" Harry said as he popped behind her out of nowhere, taking an empty seat next to Hermione.
“You can leave your things here, Salem can roam around freely. You don’t mind leaving him here, do you?”
Draco makes new friends with people he thought would be least wanting to have anything to do with him. He also starts to talk, which doesn't come out as smoothly as he would wish.
With that she was gone, an he wasn’t sure he felt more pathetic in his whole life. He wanted to cry, but there was no tears left to cry, even if he tried hard. It felt like his life was falling apart, even though it was just starting, and things that he had to face now were nothing compared to what life would have for him in upcoming months, he felt.
“And where did I ask for your opinion? You are my son and you will do what I tell you to. Now, I want to see you at the fireplace at nine, no fussing, no nothing. In a couple of days, it will be as if nothing ever happened. No one will hear about it, no one will know. You will marry Blaise in autumn just as it was planned, and everything will be just alright.”
He took Draco’s suitcase, giving a side-look to Salem that hissed at him. Draco was close to being out of it. There was no way for his mind to wrap around what was going on right now. He just followed Ana into the shaggy inside and sat down on one of the chairs. He grabbed the piece of railing from the wall, holding onto it for his dear life as the bus drove off. The chair were all moving around and everyone seemed deeply unaffected. Even Ana, that was long gone with her chair to the middle of the bus, just sat there, happily wiggling her short legs.
Harry cut off, even though Draco knew what he wanted to say. That he would be alright on his own. Which would be hypocrisy on Harry’s part to say, since he perfectly knew that all Draco wanted was to be with him. That he was perfectly happy by his side and would continue to be for the years to come if he had a chance. But Harry had his life put together already, had a woman that would be his wife and at his side, which left Draco with nothing. And they both already knew that Draco didn’t have it in him to fight against all the odds that were standing before him. With no one at his side to support him in the slightest, there was no way of him making it on his own. He could walk away from his parents, turn his back on Lucius’s ideas and lifestyle that he planned for him fully, but he would be left with nothing. He didn’t have a Knut to his name. The only money he had, weren’t his. It was only a dowry that his father created once he understood there was no way of Draco marrying a woman. Even if he got married, he would be cut off from Malfoy values, being left for the sake of his future husband and his generosity, his dowry given to his husband to do as he pleased, while he could not even see a glimpse of it.
He started the colorful, delightful smelling water and placed his pajamas and towel next to the bath before slipping off his school. Shivering slightly from the cold, he quickly stepped into nearly full bath, letting his body be covered with hot water. He really needed that. He loved learning, and working with Slughorn because he could learn even more due to that, but it was so tiring. Adding the fact that he had to hide before any Slytherin in eyesight, not being able to have proper meals at the Great Hall, only whatever he got from the kitchen, Hermione brought him or mountains of snacks from Hogsmeade, were making it worse. He wished that everything was more simple, that he didn’t have to live in fear of sitting at Slytherin table to have his Daily Prophet and big bowl of Magick O’s followed by eggs and toasts.
The room was dark, save for the moonlight coming through the tall windows. But just a moment later, by Harry’s magic, plenty of candles set all around the room came to life. His attention came to rest at the bed in the farer corner. There were few red roses laid there, and more candles standing on the nightstand. It gave him certain idea of what this all was about. And he didn’t mind one bit.
His best chance was to go to aunt Andromeda. It wasn’t ideal, he was nervous to just appear out of blue, asking for a shelter. But it was the best idea that he had, if not the only suitable thing. He considered Hermione for a moment, but he didn’t even know where she lived. But it also wasn’t the best idea, looking at how he gave her a cold shoulder after months of friendship and now would just go to her in time of need.
Draco nodded in response. He started the very important task of putting everything he could on his plate and filling his bowl with honey puffs, wanting to get as much as possible. It wouldn’t be too long before everyone were back and he couldn’t come back anymore.
"No, nothing happened. I am just ... worried. I need to get top marks with the NEWTs I'm taking if I want any decent career."
Even though there was a high possibility that they may never find a way back to each other, that once Harry decided he was ready to start a love life again, he would fall out of love with Draco, or understand that he was just a charity case at the time, he was willing to take this risk.
He got up from his spot and looked around, in search for the brown-haired man, but there was no one in sight. Until Harry appeared out of thin air, Invisibility Cloak in his hand.
The thing with money was that it could be cut short any moment, no matter his mother’s change of heart and good intentions. So, he had a plan of starting his practice as soon as possible. He came up with a plan for himself, that he would try his best to execute. Starting with his training at the small apothecary in town in a week, to opening his own. But about the latter part, he would see. First of all, he had to give birth and see how things will go with looking after the baby.
“Positive. He thinks I have a company. So, even if he was planning on coming back, he would rather sleep in the common room than to walk in onto something that would scar him for life.”
Ron seemed surprised, and he was a bit too. It wasn’t like he would make a fool of himself. He knew how to play chess. Even perfectly so. If it wasn’t reading or sorry attempts at drawing and painting, he had spent long hours playing chess, and reading books on chess if he was stuck in the game or failed to win. His mother, tired of his plays with House Elves, that would go cry to her about ‘Master Draco was forcing them to put up a real fight in a game with him’, purchased him the most splendid, hand-crafted chess set, that was enchanted to be an opponent on its own. Opponent very hard to beat, that is. So, he had his fair share of practice.
He started at the other man for a moment, stunned with his invitations. He wondered for a moment if he heard correctly. Did Harry really wanted him to stay at his house, while there was only his bedroom available to inhabit, and he wanted to make an excuse from his ‘family’ obligations, from spending time with them, to spend his Christmas with Draco?
There was a loud rustling in the corridor, and tapping of two little legs came into the kitchen with loud ‘Uncle Hally!’, and he didn’t get to finish his words, being occupied with Teddy. Andromeda followed inside and looked cautiously between Draco and Harry. She rested her hand on his shoulder, asking if everything was alright.
He nodded, taking a handful of a powder from the fireplace before stepping inside. With shaking hands he spoke the words and dropped the powder. With a bit of turbulence that were always there, he appeared in a strange fireplace to walk into gloomy, what he supposed to be, sitting room. It was big with renewed wooden floors in dark color, walls raw as if in middle of repainting, and most of furniture, save for an armchair in the corner, pushed to another corner and covered with white cloth.
Draco could swear that the cat was more charismatic than many humans. The way it looked at Draco as if e was just dumb, and then started stretching its head towards the house, meowing accusatory. Only now Draco understood that the house was most likely empty. Curtains were drawn in all the windows, and while he would suspect it to be due to summer heat, several piled-up newspapers on the lawn proved Salem’s point.
“I am saying that I do not have a problem with it, Draco. I can raise your child as my own. We can have more children, together, if that is what you would want.”
“Hermione mentioned you like drawing and you enjoy paintings but don’t have too much time for it. So, I figured if you had supplies maybe you would make a time. As I’m saying it out loud I’m hearing how stupid it is, because if you wanted, you could have obviously buy it for your…”
Harry nodded and they both went downstairs to the sitting room to Floo. Once at the fireplace, Draco gave Harry all the neatly wrapped gifts, and he picked up Salem ready to go.
“I’m aright, I guess. I just think it is too fresh still. To remember this all, think and talk about it. Think about everyone that are gone, “ he added quietly. “But they deserve it. To be talked about and remembered. So, I have to endure it for them. What about you?”
He would very much like to tell him the reason. But, if Harry didn’t want to be with him, he didn’t want him to be in a relationship with him just because of the baby. He wasn’t sure if Harry’s therapy worked if he looked out for himself now. He wasn’t going to risk Harry doing a decent thing. For now.
Before he even knew it, Harry scooped Salem from his feet, putting, almost soaked, blanket over him. What came as a bigger surprised was that Salem didn’t go hissing, and biting, and scratching. He let himself be carried by a total stranger. But it might have been a circumstance. Draco came to learn that Salem could be a total sweetheart, trying to crawl under his skin if he could, just to comfort him, but also turned to total drama queen. That cat has the biggest attitude that Draco has ever seen.
, which also many people don’t even know exists. And I have friends and girlfriend. Nice one, I suppose. MacMillan once told me she was a good catch. Maybe he was right. I guess I just don’t see it. But the point is … she is alright. And she wants to be with me. Few years from now we will have kids. I will have family that I dream of. It’s all better than many have it,” he said, but his voice didn’t sound convincing at all.
He wanted to cherish those moments, and emotions that Harry caused, but it was hard, knowing perfectly well that it was all happening in his head and was leading nowhere. Harry had a girlfriend and even though he was pretty nice about it, he wouldn’t want him the way Draco would want him. There was no possibility. So it was more than stupid of him to feel this way because of simple, friends-like gestures. It was almost fucked up.
Draco smiled faintly. He knew perfectly well that Ron thought that Harry was seeing his sister. That unwanted tightened in his chest happened, but he chose to ignore it. He wanted to enjoy this moment. It was first, and maybe only, time he could spend with Harry like this, so he wouldn’t let that slip or be taken over by the negativity. He would think of what a horrible person he was tomorrow.
“No,” she assured. “Nothing of this sort. I thought you may be already familiar with the situation, but is seems you are not. Mr. Malfoy, you are pregnant,” she said, carefully.
He felt Harry’s hand on his back, big and warm, stroking his clothed skin gently. He found it really comforting.
“I understand,” Blaise sighed. “I suppose I should have given you a sign earlier, but I always thought that we do not need such customs being brought up the way we were. Anyway … may I at least know who?”
Harry’s face didn’t light up despite the small smile that appeared on his face. He was taken aback, not sure whether to agree or just leave. It was few hours before the curfew, but it didn’t change the fact that it was Harry, of all the people. And it was what decided.
“But no tonight. Soon. I want you to sleep on it couple of days, to know you are sure. And then I will arrange everything.”
Fully intending to cry the whole night and planning how to avoid Hermione and Harry, he took his things and stormed to the Dungeons. He was so sad, for so many reasons. Primarily because of the situation, but as he calmed down eventually, blaming it all on sadness of them both, he couldn’t stop thinking about Harry’s past. He wanted to hear more, to be able to comfort him. Harry didn’t tell him all that much, only some bits and pieces, but it sounded horrible enough for him. It looked like his stupid excuse of a childhood traumas weren’t adequate. Harry had it hard, so much harder than anyone else he knew, than he himself. And he was stupidly pitying himself, thinking he had anything bad.
“Fair well, I will do that. No need to get so flustered over it. But still, I think we should talk first.”
His thoughts took him in so much that he barely paid any attention to Harry as they walked all three landings, not getting into the basement that Harry made out to be close to some toxic hazard area. He got his reason back as they were back on the second landing, Harry opening the door to one of the rooms.
Even Salem sensed how uneasy he was, stirring awake and meowing, paws running up and down his stomach. Just moments later cat found his way under his school vest and up to rub head against his neck and chin in comforting manner. That little clingy alien. But it did help a little bit. Draco moved his hand to pat Salem on the back, grateful for the comfort.
His eyes went a bit wide at the prospect. Sharing a bath with Harry? Not even Prefect’s Bathroom was big enough to make him less nervous.
Draco’s heart fluttered a bit more when he was standing in the reptile section, so close to Harry that he could feel the taller man’s breath on the back of his neck, as he listened to the story of his first visit to the zoo and how he let the python loose. But he reassured Draco there would be no snakes running free today.
He opened his eyes, rubbing the lasts of sleep off them. The small boy was standing next to the bed, his white untamed hair and big brown eyes watching him intensely.
I had. My parents’ house went to ruin, and Grimmauld Place was Sirius’s childhood home. Even though he resented it. It was place he grew up in, and which he left for me. So, I decided to do what he was trying so hard to do while living there. Renovate, making sure it looks nothing like the awful, old place it was. So, this is what I’m doing. I got rid of all the awful paintings, and believe me when I tell you they were awful. It was very tricky, and it felt as if I was murdering someone, but I never felt better in my life than when I was hammering down his mother’s portrait. She was … not the most pleasant person.”
that got to him. Draco was supposed to leave before the other came, pretending he wasn’t there, and now it was out of the question. He would be sitting at the dinner table with Harry, pretending like nothing was going on.
He moved to Harry to hug him tight. The other did the same and soon enough they were laying in the warm sun again, but doing nothing more than hugging.
The words were spilling, leaving Harry shocked, an him still unimpressed. He was already at peace with the idea. Sure, it wasn’t top of his dreams. His dreams being married to Harry, living at Grimmauld, having
He left Blaise on the dance floor and left to the closest balcony, glad that his friend didn’t follow him. He needed a moment to himself to calm down.
But soon enough gloomy thought came. His mind was filled with idea of Ginny moving into this very house to live with Harry, to have her things around, their photos hung up in the sitting room and everywhere possible, to have her way around the house, decorating it as she pleased. Well, it sounded only reasonable looking at how she was his girlfriend of couple of years now. More than once he heard Ron plotting about them getting married after they are both finished with Hogwarts, more than once Draco saw the couple here and there, talking, smiling, holding hands, hugging … it was silly to be sad about such a thing. It was natural order of things – getting relationship you were happy in to another level. But the thing was that as much as he could live with his one sided crush, he didn’t want to lose Harry’s friendship. What was bound to happen once Ginny came into picture, once they were married or at least moved in together. She hated Draco, for some unknown reason, and he didn’t like her either for the way she looked his way. And Harry wouldn’t care about him when it comes to woman he loved.
