Parkinson’s face was stricken—perhaps the news that the all-confident Draco Malfoy she’s known all her life wasn’t so all-confident had broken her. Harry’s lips twitched; no, it was the fact that Harry (and maybe his parents and a select few others, but he wasn’t choosy) was the person who could bring out something she couldn’t in him.
How easy it had been for a piddling of misconceptions and altercations to poison their shared affection.
“You know,” Parkinson hums, leaning back on her elbows to pinpoint Harry with her gaze. “I’d like to see what the Chosen One’s got hiding in his closet.”
“This was your idea; take responsibility.”
Sometimes Harry forgets how possessive they each become over each other. Not as if they were both property to be displayed or owned, but as if they were Harry’s and Draco’s selves that needed to be held close. And Harry would never allow himself, or anyone else, to be embraced by heavy chains.
There were a few shifts, and he didn’t have to glance up to see Lisa Turpin, Padma, and a few others getting up to leave. “We, uh, just thought we’d leave it to you.” They’re given soft good nights; their quiet shuffles were silenced by the click of the Room of Requirements entrance door.
Everything was hot all over.
He hadn’t contacted Ron since the day he moved out in a rush of half-closed baggage and a flurry of anxiety. It was madness, and he’d grown himself a foundation of fury, dejection, and eventual vacantness.
It wasn’t his place to ask about it.
When the door closes, he trudges to his room, undrinken glass of juice forgotten and his tiredness restored. He still had a headache.
“You know,” Hermione starts off a while later when they’ve both calmed down and are sitting down by the burning fireplace. He’s soaking in the warmth on his back when she begins speaking. “Ron misses you.”
Licking the Buffalo sauce off of his lips, he glances at Ron. “You all know how the Prophet is, they can never stop printing this… this type of drivel.”
“Hermione,” he gives her a look, drawing out her name slowly just as his neighbors did when Petunia told them that he was ‘special’. “What happened to letting things be? I thought we were accepting how things turned out.”
“Too bad you can’t throw far.”
The Burrow is a mess, redheads scurrying in and out of the makeshift home in bouts of chaos. He runs into Mrs. Weasley whose shaky fingers squeeze him into a tight hug.
She nods. “They won’t have to worry about you, and they’ll have cooperative citizens as well.”
The Prophet article slaps down beside his plate of chicken, corn, and scallop potato leftovers from Mrs. Weasley. Harry takes a quick scan of the headline, pausing in carving his chicken breasts into smaller portions to point his knife at Hermione. “It’s a load of rubbish.”
A gold-tinted smoke had settled onto the floor during her speech, and Harry watched in awe as it curled around his feet. The amazement was temporary, because the news reporter in front was snatched down by the billowing cloud.
Somehow, Harry forgot Malfoy was such a bastard, because his ears were ringing from how fast his glasses were snatched off. There was a rising self-satisfied smile forming on Malfoy’s face—cooperating with the twinkle of sordid amusement in his eyes.
“I will,” he replies, sitting up, tugging down the sleeves of his sweater.
“Say ‘Harry’, Teddy,” Harry sat back up and tickled the infant on his toes.
“Oi! If the lad’s never done it, get off his back,” Seamus snaps, gaining the support of others in their quiet silence.
Ginny shakes her head, huffing and falling into a patch of Lily’s. “No.” Her hands shake against the grass; she brings them to her face.
There was a round of snickers to go around, and even Neville looked to be chuckling at the dare. Harry wanted to collapse into himself, the mortification evident on his face. Zabini whipped around to gaze at Harry, delight bright in his eyes. “What do you think this is, Potter? A First Year's party?”
“We…” she paused when his eyes grazed the empty seat beside her.
Or maybe that’s him trembling. Maybe that’s him seeing things and crying.
“All right.” When their glee became too apparent, she told them, sternness seeping from her every pore, “But just for this once!” They all ignored Malfoy’s rude snort into his hand.
One of the hooded silhouettes looks at him and jolts.
“No, no, none of that,” he assures her, spooning his own Apple Crumble ice cream slop around in its pint size cup. “Just tired.”
Malfoy hadn’t spoken a word throughout the memory trading; he hadn’t spared them a look. He brushed off the guilt slithering in his chest, and watched the Wizengamot glide back into the courtroom after their twenty minute deliberation.
“Well,” Seamus says into the quiet. “I, erm, hadn’t expected that.” He clears his throat shifting to give Harry a weak air pump through the stifling awkwardness they’d created. Ron doesn’t give him a glance, and his jaw was set which meant some heavy apologies on Harry’s part. “Good on you, Har—!”
Renovation came easy—he picked out new colors, new furniture, and new wallpaper. He would help Kreacher pull off the walls and scrub at the floorboards. Even if the elf grumbled and happened to be nowhere near the gratefulness any other person would have been at.
“Well?” He repeats, “Define well. ‘Well’ as in great, or well in
“Um,” he sagged back into the legs of the chair behind him. “No one…” Harry felt a tug at his heart for the boy, because no one should have to be put in a situation like that.
Utter chaos.
The house elf had been murdering them with his eyes since Harry and Ginny settled into the kitchen. He skulked from the doorway, making abrupt screams every time cake batter dripped onto his freshly waxed floors. Harry shivered; he could still feel his gaze.
But her letters only come once she’s grilled him for his hasty actions in the court and with Nixon.
she corrected—and he hadn’t seen any way to help Malfoy leave his trial without being Kissed.
“How certain?” Nixon didn’t seem like the type to leave any loopholes around. He didn’t seem like the type to tolerate backhanded dealings either. “It’s risky, isn’t it?”
Harry, glamoured in thick layers of spell work, could taste the anticipation and sharp resentfulness on his tongue. It was buzzing on his magical shields.
Kingsley had said, voice tilted in suspicion and eyes scanning him with copious amounts of wariness. He gave himself a pat down, straightening his robes and squishing his hair to accommodate the more ‘formal’ setting.
“Oh, have you never had it then?” She’s mocking him; they both knew he had.
garden, she corrected. That meant he had to work extra hard on it.
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice is faint, subdued even, in the softness of their dying conversation. “You can talk to me—to us. It doesn’t… we can…” Her words drift off on a shaky breath.
"Something he can make his own," Draco said. "No expectations."
"John's fine," Draco said, and still didn't look up. "But he's your baby, you can call him what you want."
Hermione sat down next to him, and very firmly removed Jonny from Harry's arms. "I want a cuddle," she said. "And you need a shower. He'll be fine for twenty minutes. Have a shower. And you need to leave the house. You can't sit here and wait for Draco to ring the doorbell."
And then Draco walked over, and took Harry's hand, and dropped to his knees on the quilt. "I'm sorry," he said. "I'm so, so sorry."
Ron rubbed his back. "He's made his choice. From what you said, it doesn't sound like it was easy for him."
Harry, never that good in an emotional crisis, patted him awkwardly on the arm. "Are you okay?"
Ron glanced down at his jumper and then back up again. "Just checking," he said. "Thought I might have accidentally turned into Hermione."
"Harry," Draco said, and he was crying, and Harry couldn't get the door open quick enough. "Harry, I can't do this."
"You shouldn't have gone outside in this," he said finally. "It's too cold."
was the worst.
Draco emerges, chin tilted towards the light, from the depths of his bedroom. "My audience awaits," he says. "I'm thinking… 1950s, at home with a matinee idol, a casual laugh to the camera like this—" he laughs. "My easy laugh says one thing, my eyes say another. Just a hint of my inner agonies. Recreate one of those magazines spreads I was showing you. At home with Draco Malfoy. You know."
Harry stomped his way inside. He hadn't had much sleep. He had no idea what to say. Feelings were rubbish. "Draco!"
"I can't see him," Draco said. "Please don't let me see him."
"We'll have display cases for your animals," Harry said. "I'll get them for you."
"Excessively good luck," Harry said. "Would you like a biscuit?"
"It was looking at me," Draco says.
"Not specifically cheese," Harry said. "Cheese and, you know, other things."
Oh fuck, he was having a baby.
"No," Draco said. Harry was upending salad leaves into a bowl, and half-heartedly quartering tomatoes. Draco, because he was forever perturbed by Harry never dressing his salads, started rummaging in his cupboards for oil and mustard and balsamic vinegar.
Harry, for want of something better to do, nodded, and left.
"He's pregnant, Ron," Hermione said. There was a fond sort of exasperation wrought across her face. "The hormones."
Draco clung to his hand. "I didn't want to be alone."
"Its not a monster," Harry says. "Draco's just scared of it."
"You are too," Harry said.
soundtrack) of him decorating a Roomba with greenery and wild flowers - "I steal it all," he tells me, as he lights his first cigarette of the interview. "I don't even have a garden."
Harry made a face. "Do I have to?"
Molly took one look at him and cried, which Harry had half-expected but still didn't know quite what to do with. Ron had given him a look of half raised-eyebrows, half understanding, and then begged a hold of him, so perhaps Harry just wasn't prepared to deal with anyone's reaction to the presentation of Harry's baby son. Hermione just got all soft around the edges and then curled up on the sofa with Jonny sleeping in the curve of her elbow, which gave Harry a good five minutes to make himself a cup of tea and stare out into the garden.
"I could murder a curry," Ron said, plucking the wine out of Harry's grip and heading for the kitchen.
Inside the Flourish and Blotts bag was a copy of
"We all just got the memo," Hermione said, holding a scrunched up bit of parchment in her hand. "You didn't want a leaving party and you've spent the last month handing over all your casework. You've left. It makes it sound like you've been fired and they're trying to cover it up."
"I'll do it," he said, Mothercare bag still in hand, when Draco answered the door. "I'll bring our baby up."
"It was cloudy," Harry said. "And we were drunk. We were very, very drunk."
"No," Hermione said. "Because you are an idiot, and you still won't flipping admit you're in love with him."
"Just like that?"
. I think we're probably the opposite of just like that."
Harry apparated to the cafe, barefoot and in his pyjamas, and found Hermione and Ron there with their wands out, Draco standing frozen by the counter, and Sheila sitting carefully next to the phone. Harry was in front of Draco in seconds, reaching behind him for Draco's hand, their tattooed snakes entwining around their wrists, Sheila watching on in shock.
"You know that Potter's not still at Hogwarts, right?" Draco said. "It's a bit too late for him."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I wasn't inviting you," he said. "There is no way the two of us can arrive together at a healer's and not have someone eventually find out. That won't be happening."
"It's not that. It's just a bit complicated. But I'm ready. It's fine."
"So," Ron said, when they'd found a spare ten minutes to go to the bakery and get a pasty each and call it lunch, "how's things?"
"In here," Draco called back. He was in the living room with Ron, where they were talking in general terms about the possibility of maybe at some point in the future possibly playing a game of chess together. Luckily it wasn't just Harry who was shit at relationship building.
Harry is somewhat in awe of Pansy Parkinson and her planning skills.
There was an awkward pause. Draco continued to bury himself in the cupboard.
"The pub was closed and I had firewhisky here," Harry said. "So we came back to have some."
"Um," Hermione said, cracking open the wine and turning the bottle straight upside down to decant furiously into a jug. Someone had once told her this was the equivalent of letting it breathe, and as Harry had no fucking idea whether it was or not, she continued to do it every time they met for dinner, and Harry proffered no alternative opinion, although this time Draco did wince. "But aren't they going to notice when the two of you pop up with a baby?"
He didn't cry.
Harry didn't even bother getting up. He only had a certain amount of energy these days and he was saving it for necessities.
"Such a silly thing to love," Draco said softly, late one evening when he was awake and Harry was curled into his side on the bed, arms wrapped around him.
"Malfoy," Ron said, stopping dead in the kitchen doorway.
"Personal, social, and health eduction," Hermione said, pushing past Ron so she could get to the corkscrew, which didn't seem a bad idea to Harry, all things considered. "Seemed like a good idea to spread information rather than misinformation."
"Got it," Harry called back. He was flicking through. The first few pages showed the baby's growth in the parent's tummy at each month. He counted back to the night of the full moon, and hesitated over the
"She could just give us our baby back," Draco said, eyeing the door. "Then everyone's happy."
"You'd better," Draco said, and then he turned to face the window and he didn't look back, and Harry had no choice but to stand up with his baby, and leave.
"I'll start to worry when there's even the slightest possibility of someone in the Ministry understanding Instagram Stories," Draco says. "Until then, I don't think we've got anything to worry about. They're still bemused by the existence of the rubber duck. There's no way any of them is going to get TikTok."
"What is it?" Hermione asked again, more urgently this time, and Harry looked up and said,
"How'd you know I wouldn't buy one myself?"
"I'm fine," Draco said. "It's just a few months."
"For fuck's sake, Harry," Hermione said, and Ron stopped grinning.
"Minerva will like that," Hermione said, patting his knee. "Harry, what are you going to do?"
Draco reached out then, touching Harry's arm. "Don't come back," he said. "Don't bring him back. Please."
Hermione shook him awake. Her eyes were bright. "We've got something to try," she said, and Harry's mind went blank. He was back in Draco's room, in that horrible house where his flatmates hated him and he didn't know how to live in a Muggle world, where he had nothing but two tiny animal figurines, and Harry had found him.
"A good mix," Harry said, and then he stumbled into Hermione's arms and buried his face in her shoulder. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped."
"Don't think I could have lasted much longer. All that hand holding and looking in different directions. We would still have been doing it when Jonny was at school."
"Hi, Draco," Harry said, after a pause. "Why don't you come over here and meet your son."
She smiled at him. "Proud of you," she said. "And not just because you're the reason Hogwarts finally has a PSHE curriculum."
Harry backed down of course, not wanting to do more damage than he’d already done. Why had he let his bitterness allow him to be so hurtful and rude? As his beating heart pounded, and slowed, he was washed over with shame and guilt. Had he been so overcome that he’d outed Parkinson’s feelings to the public?
He had four letters in the Family pile today; he went to place them in the spelled woven basket underneath his desk. It was where he kept all of his Family letters. An object had gotten jammed in the cover, however.
“I said not another word!” Mrs. Weasley pours some gloss brown gravy onto her mash potatoes. Oddly enough, the actions make her appear more angry. “You’ve worked too hard to not finish your education, young man.”
When he looked away from the floor—his chest caving with heavy pumps and his mind fizzling out—he was attempting to swallow down a yell.
Her entire body was blanketed, and the small appearances that her foot showed was the lone reason he didn’t go into complete hysterics. She struggled from the smokey hold, but her attempts were fruitless. The chamber doors opened, and she, amongst others who were fighting the fluff’s grip, were spit outside.
Teddy was on his back, tiny foot in his tiny hand, smiling using all of his gumminess. He used the wet knuckle that had been in his mouth a few minutes prior to point at Harry and coo an unintelligible sentence.
Except, there were two Unspeakables. Between their arms was a ragdoll like figure, dragged along in whatever top secret escapades Unspeakables kept themselves to.
he asked her to do—at Tesco.
Perhaps he should come back after all, he mused. Harry supposed it would make Hermione more happy. Glancing back at the kitchen window, he catches the gaze of a familiar silhouette. Ginny hesitates, but waves at him, a small smile adorning her wary face.
was below them in big pink letters alongside charts dedicated to their gene, blood, and magical compatibility (which were all at a horrifying low).
He went to sit next on Hermione’s right side, overlooking the empty chair and plate beside Ron. “Hey, there.” Ron stretches tight beside her, acknowledging Harry’s presence in a soft grunt.
“How did you get in?” Hermione doesn’t address his question, sliding further into his dining room.
“But Headmistress McGonagall said we weren’t allowed alcohol,” Hermione stressed, her hands held clenched tight together. Ron shifted beside her in uneasiness, all signs of his thrilled expression fading away into the distance. Many just appeared plain out annoyed with her imposal. “That means no intoxication.”
Harry finds that Hogsmeade is shiner; the materials used during the Hogsmeade clean-up was the cause of the pristine condition it was now in.
Ron passes through the kitchen at a quarter to six to snag an orange, and, paying no mind to his mother’s pestering, he gives Harry a bumbling greeting on his way out. It’s awkward, but he appreciates it and returns the salutations. Wednesday morning he’d woken up to him, at what he was sure was Hermione’s insistence they speak, that they have a game of Quidditch.
Harry swallowed when Malfoy, the graceful git, knelt down in front of him, his throat parched and breaths unable to come out the proper way. When had he given this boy so much power over him? And why? Harry felt the tickle of Malfoy’s breath against his ear when the other leaned forward to say. “Lift your arms.”
“Whiskey?” he answered, making an effort to keep up with the woman and her fast-paced commentary.
He was holding a vanilla folder in his left hand and scribbling onto a small pile in his right. He glanced up, motioning for Harry to come in.
Yet getting into the Ministry wasn’t as smooth as he’d thought it would be. Upon flooing into the Atrium, he was trampled back into it by a crowd of overzealous fans.
“When did you?” If there was a tone of rudeness in his voice, Harry swears he didn’t mean to put it in there. He was frustrated at this point; hating the way Ron and Hermione eyed him. Seamus and the others couldn’t be bothered by him not sharing these kinds of things with them.
Her red nails were clenched in her lap. “Well, if that’s what the people—!”
It’s better than his first experience with changing Teddy. He’d seemed like such a calm baby the entire time, but as Harry had gotten his nappy off, he sprayed all over his shirt.
It’s a near relief, and he feels weightless from the tension that disperses in her present.
Her appearance was a ruse, because the words that came from her peach-tinted lips were depraved. Skeeter seemed to be in some sort of writer’s heaven, her quick quill scratching down comments at god-speed.
A truth was to be written on the front; the back a dare. Harry decided to go for sweet and simple.
It was the Ministry’s emblem, with a few former markings that don’t appear in the new symbol.
The courtroom’s magic tickled his nose, flying past him to re-arrange the setup in a spectral burst. A dozen seats merged together to form one row behind the accused: Draco Malfoy.
where others
He glances back up Ginny in confusion. “What’s this?”
Trulock raised a hand to rub at his temple, and he sighs, “Mr. Potter.”
It skidded to a stop at Hermione. “A-ha! Something tells me Granger is going to be amusing! Go ahead, give us an incredible show.”
He didn’t want to talk. Too much was happening at once, and in reality he just wanted to curl up and scream. His stomach dropped;
Though he deflated, Seamus nods.
Harry allowed himself a brief moment of silence to contemplate what
His communication with his friends are limited, at best, but after a tentative letter to Ginny he finds his previous angst over missing his friends is dulled. Ginny writes to him like she talks to him—fiery, impassioned, and all Ginny.
“I do?” Neville questions. He flinches when she reaches over Malfoy to pat his thigh.
The feather grazed his light brown cheek. “Mr. Potter, what do you believe would be the correct way to mend this problem?”
“Pretty stupid,” Harry agrees, spooning his scrambled eggs aside on his plate. Her smile is watered down from its usual gleaming state, and he notices her wiping tears away from her eyes. “I’m sorry.”
They played around—meaning Harry behaved like a fool to make Teddy laugh—for another twenty minutes until Andromeda called for him to be changed and fed.
“Merlin, Teddy,” Harry coughed, casting a smell blocking charm on his nose. He leaned back, hurrying to drop the used nappy into the garbage tin beside the changing tables leg. “What is she feeding you, by Merlin…”
The paper in his hand vibrates at his gaze before shoving it in his jacket and leaves. He takes several measures to make sure he doesn’t run into any workers of the Auror Department.
“With them endorsing the Ministry’s tripe, more wizards and witches will be inclined to rebel less.” And Harry does think, taking it in for a moment and coming to the conclusion that it makes enough sense.
he looked
Nothing smeared—the ink smudged on the sides of his fingers looked to be permanent.
“That has nothing to do with this,” he groans, closing his eyes and ignoring her defensive mutterings that were mildly amusing to him now. “You only say that when you can’t think of a proper comeback.”
Malfoy snarled, but whatever scathing response he’d been prepared to throw out was diminished by Parkinson.
“Gin?” he calls out, taking small measured steps further inside. She doesn’t answer.
Everything was hot all over.
He drags himself to bed and falls into a deep slumber, dreaming of
She unsheathes her wand from her holster, and, while her hand flicks and twists with gold swirls falling from the tips, she commands the curious crowd. “This case has become a restricted trial, and is no longer accessible to the public. This will be my one and only warning—failure to comply will lead to severe consequences.”
Irked—but not shocked—by the reporters, he struggled to save face and not let his irritation show. It was the least of his wants at the second to have a dozen or so articles in the paper screaming ludicrous theories about the frown shaping his face. However, he did want to know how they managed to get past the wards if, by Kingsley’s word, they were spelled to keep them out.
She doesn’t make a move to answer him, so he grasps it in his hands and takes a closer look. The new guidelines for the Blood Act must have been mailed out during his conversation with Kingsley.
Ron appears more furious at her proposal. “Like hell—!”
His skin was itching and he wanted to leave.
Kingsley was seated behind a wide maple desk that stretched to the ends of the room. He couldn’t take a look at the tabletop because it was smothered by files and mountains of, what Harry assumed were, paperwork.
By the day of the brunch, all Harry could manage was a half-assed letter of salutations. He didn’t attempt again when the letter was sent back the next day.
The hoard of owls left just as fast as they came, a dull brightness seeping back over the group that was the sunshine.
A Ministry owl flutters by the open window, impatient to be let out and return to its sender. Ginny is stretched out over the couch with a letter pressed to her face, “You got a letter.” She holds it out for him, and sits up to allow him room.
“And you were never gonna tell me?” There was a certain distinction of hurt in his tone, and it makes Harry’s insides tremble. There was a clench in his stomach, but he couldn’t say anything more because he wasn’t ready. Harry wasn’t ready to come out yet.
Pansy Parkinson hated him with everything in her being, but she also respected him. This was her one plan, and her final plan, to bring him down without the mass-destruction that came with it.
“Those in favor Draco Malfoy receiving the Dementor’s Kiss please raise your wands,” she announces, and Harry’s breath leaves him as members of the Wizengamot begin to vote.
There were three piles: Family, Press, and Official. It was rare to receive more than one letter in the Official pile per week. This week he received none.
The figure on the left tugs Malfoy forward, his body dropping from the help of one person to pulling his body up. Harry’s eyes trail on the stained baggy standardized garments, and the other Unspeakable comes forward to pull the drooping side back up.
The protesters were whirring about around the inside of the Atrium. Their loud complaints were hardly being managed by the poor group of Auror trainees tasked with guarding the level nine entrance.
“A pregnancy lasts about nine months, Harry,” she looks back up at him, flower crushed between her hands and misery in her eyes. “Do you believe they’ll wait for me? With plenty of other players to choose from?”
Draco burned—a brutal frostbite, a creaking heartbeat. He was an inferno of ice. His breathing was cold against the empty dent beside him; the blank space, the gaping faces, the shocked places of people that didn’t even fucking matter to him. Harry was his, and he’d never let the bastard leave him no matter how hard it took to pry Weasley’s hands away from his gaping heart.
they'd told him. To destroy it, he would have to destroy the binds that sealed the contract. It couldn’t be spelled away. It couldn’t be removed by hand.
“As Saviour of the Wizarding world, how do you feel about the Malfoy Family’s demise and the passing of nearly 100 accused Death Eaters?”
“Hermione, I didn’t understand a word of what you just said.” She opened her mouth, and he continued over her. “I don’t particularly want to know either.”
“Provided that you decline them,” he hums, pulling out a second quill that was a deep blue instead of white. “Well, Ms. Weasley will be turned into… what was that you named it? Livestock, yes? Ginevra will be put into a breeding system.”
“Memories, Potter,” Trulock cut him off, unimpressed at his anxious babbling. “Hand them here.”
He sits by the fireplace until the dying flames make a home in his knuckles in the form of glowing embers. Harry wonders if he should be concerned—if this is it for them, and whether or not their seven year friendship will come to crushing halt.
“Oh, Harry, are you alright, dear?”
There were a few murmurs that were canceled out by the sound of her pleased hum. “We’ll use a bottle to choose our contender. Longbottom is up first.”
“Ms. Ginevra is a minor at the moment,” Nixon reminds him, lips closing into slits in his impatience. “Her legal guardian would need to be here in the event that you decline my offer. Be that as it may…”
, but he had a good idea about what the Head Warlock was going to say.
Maybe it was the way the stars had been aligned that very night. Maybe it was the way electricity bounced off of his fingertips as he spat out something rude—
“Even infants understand the effects of alcohol, Granger,” Malfoy grouses, all but rolling his eyes when Harry and Ron set their eyes upon him. All thoughts of being elsewhere with Malfoy vanished under the premise that the arsehole wasn’t supposed to talk bad about his friends. Nonetheless, he still found himself fancying just one friendless night in bed reading
And, yet, he can’t comprehend for the life of him, conceding that he brushes aside the tensions and the strains, whether or not the downfall was triggered by him or them. Perhaps it was a coexisting crime that had rotted at their friendship’s foundation.
Harry’s back straightens. “Yes, sir?”
He squealed, squirming around,
It’s not even ten yet, and he’s already got a headache. It seems he gets headaches in more frequent intervals then he used to. Combined with the phantom sores that are appearing all throughout his body, he is in too much pain to deal with Hermione’s pestering.
“Of course,” she responds, “This is our last chance to finish our education.” She goes on to prattle about the benefits of taking their N.E.W.T.s, and, for a second, Ron and him share a dry look.
The brunch was next Thursday, and all he had done was visit his godson and pace around his sitting room. A recent habit, he found, that had earned him a cranky lecture from Kreacher when he’d run through the new rug.
She’d sent Pig back an hour after his letter panting and weary an hour after his letter to write that ‘
“I’m surprised, Potter,”
He thinks he sees Ginny’s face trembling—he thinks he sees a haze of a person huddled on the ground squeezed tight into themselves. But it’s background noise, and background noise can only be the sound of glass breaking and Ginny’s face crumbling into tears.
The glower didn’t last long, a grin twitching onto his face till the baby lifted his leg up to chew on his foot.
He shakes his head, “That’s not true.”
Harry disappears in a swirl of green.
, she calls him, in spite at first but fond furthermore. Molly and Ginny, according to her, are not on speaking terms at the moment.
Ron’s face reddens and he jerks forward. “Mate—!”
The Unification Committee was dead set on upholding the law, meaning no one was exempt from their rule. It’d be silly to think a flip of his hair could change that.
It was complicated; the entire process, the hand movements, the amount of power he had to put into the spell, all of it, complicated.
he thought. His mind flashed to Scrimgeour and he thinks
It all blares out, and she’s overpowered by the fury and the disorientation they have for the boy who now looks up at Harry. Malfoy looks up at him, wide-eyed and mouth hanging open, which was a stupid expression that Harry had never, ever had the pleasure of seeing on his face.
But images of crying Hermione pile on his conscious, so the words he end up saying are:
she rushes over, choking up and vehemently denying whatever words he was prepared to throw out in denial. “It is, and you know it!” she croaks, eyes filling with tears. His stomach clenches, and he raises his hand to speak. “Please. Promise me you’ll look after yourself more—stop worrying over us, we’ll be okay. It needs to be the other way around.”
Parkinson’s laugh boomed throughout the room, “A virgin? How precious!” No one else was laughing though.
Harry decides now is a better time than ever to go out on a limb and speak up for the poor bloke. “Malf—Mr. Malfoy called me here to speak as his witness.” The courtroom went wild for it, with the two seated columnists scratching their quills down at an enraged pace.
“What a waste of magic,” he murmured, sliding into one of the seats and desks that circled around Harry. He placed a file marked HARRY POTTER CASE in bright red letters in front of him.
“And I said that it’s bullocks,” Ron repeated, “Why do they want Harry and Gin together? They’re not even together anymore!” Harry grimaces, and Ron sputters out a quick apology.
Malfoy had been quiet sitting (a big surprise, that was) between Parkinson and Zabini. It had been many of the Gryffindors great pleasure to find that he was an odd mixture of old Malfoy and post-war Malfoy. Loud, but quiet.
Everything was so cold all over.
The temperature dropped as it did each time he entered a dungeon. The temperature dropped, Harry noted, and there was no one in sight. A lone feathered post-it note floated through the air with the time ticking in bold numbers.
Harry flinched at the quiet crack, lifting his head back up in time to take note of Nixon vanishing his previous quill’s remains.
“We don’t need a mental image, Ron,” Hermione interrupted, a tint of repulsion layering her face.
And the illumination of the sun can only be the tears sliding down his face and a fallen boy screaming.
She’s too furious to put an end to her fire, which is why he doesn’t reject her demand that they go get scooped ice cream in Muggle London. She remembers his favorite flavor, Salted Caramel not Apple Crumble, and he remembers to give her his full attention. It’s not hard when she’s the only one trying to get it.
“I’ll do it,” Harry announces, and if he seems too eager he adds, “It’s just a game.” It’s a lame excuse; maybe the saddest he’s ever told in his life, he knows this, yes. He can’t stop himself from looking Parkinson (maybe a little at Turpin too, but no one had to know that except those two) in the eye, challenging her in the form of a stare. Her pale lips form into a predicted grin.
In the third year of his lower school, Harry liked to draw. He liked to draw so much, in fact, that his teacher suggested an art career pathway to Petunia and Vernon. This included paying extra for afterschool art classes.
He’s allowed off stage by a slight nod, and he traces his steps back to his seat with minimal interactions. It’s empty and nothing looks touched, but he clears all drinks and foods regardless. Someone curses behind him. His sits, eyes burning and body sagging into the chair. It’s been less than two hours, and he’s already drained.
“Uh, I shouldn’t, er, I’m not,” he stuttered out, flinching but leaving once he was pulled along into Acken’s muscled hold. “...brilliant.”
There was a shift, and then a quick murmuring as Malfoy followed the paper's directions and spun again. Harry was horrified to hear excited whispers of all things. He had experienced jealousy many times in his life, but this type of jealousy was a different breed.
He knows there are things Ron should be saying that he isn’t, things that Harry hasn’t said to Ron that he knows he should.
“How could you do something like that, Harry,” Hermione uncrosses her arms to step forward. Her face twists in frustration. “How could Ginny even allow you to do something like that?”
The light would help. As though listening in on Harry’s musings, the soil shifted in on itself.
From Hermione, he learned that the longer bond magic sits, the stronger it becomes.
“You carry the power to decide her fate, not her mother or father. Not even herself, Mr. Potter. Their presence would be, at most, another person to share the news with.”
But the person twitched, his dirty platinum blond hair flopping away from his face and Harry couldn’t move along.
Once he was finished with his writing, he rose from his sofa and dropped the paper in as he sat down. He hoped their game wouldn’t take too long. Maybe someone would get too pissed to continue, and he was given the right to help them to their dorm.
Mrs. Weasley pulls back at an abrupt speed. “Harry,” she says, hands caressing his cheeks, tired eyes checking him over. “It’s wrong of me to ask you this, but please do your best to watch over Ginny.”
Out of the three of them, Harry had never doubted that Hermione would be the most level headed one in their group. She would be the best, and he loved her for her even when she wasn’t.
Because whenever he was with Draco Malfoy, his temperature never failed to surge.
“How’s Ron holding up?” He clears his throat, becoming anxious when her vicious fighting with her purse comes to an abrupt waver. “Is he alright, I mean?”
“We’ve all spoken to Ginny, mate.”
It could have been the way the stars were aligned that very night. All he knew was that something astonishing had happened, because intoxicants were known to do pleasing things. But Harry wasn’t capable enough to carry the burden of the sweet-smelling fluids in his stomach for the night; he wasn’t haunted enough to feel the consequences.
‘Avoiding’ couldn’t quite cover the umbrella of issues they were sliding over. And, if he were being honest, he couldn’t find any correct terms to use for identifying their growing problems. ‘Avoiding’ seemed braud enough.
“Are the headaches getting worse?” She questions, pulling a notebook out her bag beneath the table. A fleck of bacon flew off the table, and her glossy black hardback took its place.
Once he climbed down the staircase (determined to ignore the door leading to the Department of Mysteries) leading to the level 10 chambers, he noticed two things.
Harry peeled at blistering burns settling down onto his bony knuckles and his aching palms. They bubbled up from his grip on the rake while he worked away in his Aunt's garden under the summer heat. Her
“I can’t—I can’t take it,” Harry shakes his head, pushing himself up to push the folder away. “Why do I get it? Why does it have to be me?”
Curious, but not horrified, Hermione replied. “Drinking games?”
She waves her wand and, behind her, the door to the kitchens opens, a line of bobbing plates floating straight through it. Hermione pats Ron’s head in a display of fake consolation, but he laps it up.
“Pansy Parkinson.” Another pureblood. There was no doubt she and whoever pureblood they handpicked for her were going to be strutting out from here arms linked. Perhaps they’d lounge at the tables daydreaming about their future pureblood ankle biters.
Hermione was quiet for a moment, and then she sighed.
“I—um…”
Press had four letters:
Deputy Trulock groused beneath his pointy hat and thick, brown mustache before returning order. “The court has read the accused’s briefs, and we—!” A nervous Ministry worker whispered into his ears, and he stopped to flower at Harry.
“Never Have I Ever slept with two people at once,” Deans says, turning to Seamus. “And then, the people who have..”
He sighed. “There’s no reason for you to feel guilty, Gin, I already told you I—!”
“For the headaches?” A water drop dribbles down from the mug—his favorite mug that Hagrid bought him, sheepish and smiling, when he visited during his volunteer hours a few weeks back—to his knuckles.
“That may be true, but there’s always room for improvement, Harry,” she comments, reshuffling her papers into a nice, neat stack.
It was comical those two weeks ago, but now it was pitiful. Harry’s stomach clenched at the fact that he was worrying over the prat, and he damn near vomited. He wouldn’t have to… trouble himself over what was happening to the boy once he released him from, what the Wizarding World hoped would be, the Kiss.
Harry heard about it through Hermione.
“And you believe that?” It was bullshit. If Nixon didn’t see that, Harry wasn’t going to spend his time persuading him otherwise. “It’s…” He couldn’t find the correct word to describe the bubbling feeling that was resonating deep within his stomach. “It’s..”
It was an incredible and casual display of power. But Harry’s mindset never faltered. “Rest assured that they are well in health, and
A choked whimper; and his torso is thrusted into the roasting air.
“Blood is—!”
“I’ll go,” Her jaw clenches when she glowers at him. “Never Have I Ever had sex more than once in a day.” Harry knows she’s targeting him; knows she thinks he’s a whore as well. And maybe that’s why she hates him. Because she’s afraid for Malfoy.
“You and Ron’s talking has been long since overdue, Harry,” she tells him, digging her spoon into her Raspberry and Chocolate flavored ice cream. “You never told me what you two were bickering about, but I’m glad it’s over.”
“We’re deciding whether or not we want to pair up for a union,” she sighs, slumping forward onto her cupped hands. Her face is obscure, but hears the crack in her voice, “I suppose it would be the most logical decision, but…”
“Ew!” Seamus exclaims when even Dean and Neville begin unwrapping theirs as well. “I swear to Merlin I hate you couples who do these sorts of coupley things!” He’s shoved aside with a ‘shut up’ from Dean, and a squeak from Neville. Harry begins to laugh at the scene, when a disgruntled noise comes from Ron.
“I reckon that,” Hermione shifts in her seat to nod at the envelope sitting on his counters. It’s Ministry seal wax was glinting in the light. He’d gotten it dropped into the wards the second Ron and Hermione apparated to the door, “will be your coercion.”
Harry never said anything more of it, but his heart would clench whenever Ron and her would sneak away in a flurry of whispers and tears.
Molly’s thrown herself into the grips of Arthor's arms, and Percy is cursing. He’s cursing and pulling the letter closer to his face as though he’s in a position to dissect the exact reason for its existence through his fogged reading glasses.
She jolts up, wiping her face while running down the stairs of the house. He stands and watches her wobbling figure, uncertain and concerned, before deciding to follow her.
Because, though Potter would never be good enough, she could almost always see the way Draco’s eyes lit up when they were close.
“Wha—me? Why!” He spluttered.
Only to spit it back into his cup, a strangled cough being his sole reaction to the burn in his throat. “What is that?”
“What in the hell?” Ginny muttered, peeling the envelope from off of her baked chicken.
Neville jumps, taking his eyes off of Parkinson to meet Harry’s stare. “Dean suggested Never Have I Ever.”
“You’re saying you’re not able to do it?” The predicament with his magic wasn’t a pleasant tale—he was bursting in it, and the consequences of that were becoming all too real. Little amounts were straining in a way that meant he’d neglected to find a middle ground between too much and too little.
Ink smatterings from their fallen ink bottles—dropped in their haste to dip and go—seeped across the floor near his feet. The court reporter waved his wand in a vicious slash to clear up the puddle, and his eyes never strayed from his parchment paper that was scrawling out sentences at a frantic velocity.
Soon renovation replaced whatever development he’d started before. Harry didn’t mind it, because Hermione promised them they’d get over it even when she visited him less and less these days.
“Eh?”
“You’re gay?” Ron doesn’t look for confirmation, soHarry doesn’t give it to him. His body wants to move, but he stares at the floor, head hanging and body burning. It was as if someone had stolen all of the air from his stomach—as if Parkinson had just ripped his very soul from his body. “Fuck, you’re gay.”
A deep-seated ache drilled itself further down, stinging his chest in some sort of bitter-tainted karma. It was pointless to sit here burning.
He takes his time too, making the decision to scrape the darkest chunks of chicken into Hermione’s plate. Hermione still gives him a thankful smile. “Thank you, Kreacher.” He grunts in aversion.
“I’ll go start us off, and then maybe you’ll understand it better.”
Malfoy was watching them both, face incredulous as Parkinson began to unwrap her candy in shame. There’s a fire in his eyes—Harry knows he will pay for it. He ignores his burning gaze—Harry knows he will pay for it—feeling a sense of accomplishment as Turpin flushes against her wrapper as well.
He doesn’t like to think back to how messed up he was after Sirius’ death. He’d go out about everyday and try to forget; it never took much work to find someone to warm his bed.
Malfoy’s veins are pressed to his skin—and they’re tinged white.
Mrs. Weasley calls out for them to come eat not even thirty minutes later. The long table is set up using eleven seats and plates, yet there were eight people present.
That twinkling laugh Teddy had learned how to emit this month. It made looking like a lunatic worth it.
Harry had tried to take it from his chewing mouth, but the boy had let out an offended cry thereby sending him into panic mode. Teddy seemed smug afterwards, sucking on the tail for added effect.
“You don’t have anything to do with this conversation,
He was breathing.
Water from his shower dripped down his neck and into his old t-shirt. The shower had helped. He brought back the hand sliding along the rim of the pot, and rubbed his fingers together.
Harry purses his lips.
“I’ll go.” It was harsh and rude.
It’s a lighthearted photo, no doubt taken sometime during their third or fourth year based off of their more youthful appearances. It’s lighthearted, but his heart grows heavy as he glances at it now. Still, it warms him.
“Are you going to sit there quiet the entire time?” His ears were ringing—he could still hear Ron’s anger in the background. He could still hear Malfoy’s crisp voice.
He felt the loneliness and cold dark ache in his chest—
“Tell us about—!”
There were pieces of soot coating Malfoy’s hair—his locks were dangling to his throat. His face wasn’t visible. Yet the way his grey-tinged skin stretched taut against his sharp bones said enough.
Chief Warlock Paris Nixon’s face didn’t betray whatever emotions he had bubbling beneath his skin. “I see.” It was his eyes that told Harry everything.
There’s a flash, “Mr. Potter! Please make a statement about the Pureblood Masacre!”
When he first sees it, he doesn’t make much of it.
Her gaze swayed. “I’m so sorry, Harry.
“Mum thinks that we’ll be partners for this, and it started a huge argument between us. I don’t want children, at least, not right now,” Ginny’s fingers crush the pale yellow orchids by his feet. “The Harpies offered me a spot on their team this year.”
It was a disturbance in the Ministry. “I can’t destroy it.”
! Harry would never touch you!” Hermione has to pull Ron back from knocking him sideways with his fist, and her face showed neither anger nor joy.
Pansy burned—her heart pounded, her eyes stung. She was ignited. Her nails dig into her palms; the dirt, the bedroom door, the curtains. The way they moved hurt her so bad, and yet she couldn’t quite speak her mind.
“Merlin’s saggy balls, it was so awful,” Ron groaned, sliding his elbows off the table and letting his head fall onto the table in one fluid motion. “They hounded the wards for weeks. We couldn’t even leave the house without reporters three inches up our—!”
The letter comes quiet; soft paper, immaculate stamp. Simple and quiet. On the inside, however, the words are loud, so loud that he has to take a second to breathe.
Once, he glanced at the pages she kept so hidden and obscured, his eye snagging itself on a single line of bright blue highlight:
Hermione stops mid-rant to stare at him wide eyed and concerned, “Are you unwell? You did look rather peaky when I came in.”
A few people cheer the lantern on, and it radiates one last strong glow before it disappears within the opening. Harry sits back onto his seat, gripping the table as an anchor to keep himself reality.
Harry lifted his arms, trying not to jump when Malfoy’s cool fingers touched his waist. His white button up was rolled up to his elbows, and all Harry could see was the black trousers that came with their school uniform. All he could see was the muscles forearms that would manhandle Harry when he needed it on occasion. He licked his lips and glanced up to find two dark gray eyes flashing bright.
“Er,” Seamus stumbled, hand going to scratch his head. Was he always this awkward around Malfoy? “Are you playing, Malfoy? You don’t, uh, have to go if you don’t want..”
A tall, heavy-set woman trudged toward the stage in a light blue dress. Her name sounded familiar, and it was only when she reached the stairs that he understood the familiarity. She was a Ravenclaw in their year; in academics, Morag was fifth in their class. If he recalled correctly, she was a pureblood.
And then he opened the chamber doors.
Hermione inhales, “Harry, do you remember the day of…” Her hand twitches towards her wand on the table. “The Battle of Hogwarts. They snapped a picture of you and Ginny hugging by the gates?”
He eyed the toy in Harry’s fingers, causing him to cough, placing it back on the colorful rack. “I don’t, for the most part, sir.”
“All bloodlines are significant, and, because the pureblood lines have been severely weakened, one pureblood woman is more significant than ten pureblood men.”
“I figured you’d be the type to wait until marriage.”
If he wasn’t so tired, he’d flinch from the sound of her cursing. It wasn’t a usual occurrence, he knows this.
He would not let her win. “Truth.” A crinkled, white paper was scratchy in his hand, but he read on anyway.
his mind screams, because they couldn’t, right? They weren’t going to attempt to marry him off to make the untruthful images of ‘223 Marriage Is A 100% Happiness Guarantee!’ try to seem more real. They didn’t have that type of jurisdiction, none of that power.
you are welcomed to jump, and countless wizards similar to yourself are daft enough to trust that they can simply
Harry stares at his food, listening to the hesitant voices starting to fill the table again. The glistening chicken was unappetizing, even as his stomach gurgled for it.
“Alright.” He closes his eyes once again, focusing on the sound of the fire beginning for the second time that day.
“And, I, for one, think that Finnigan’s proposal is a splendid idea. With adjustments, of course,” she added with a sniff, when too many imposing eyes laid bare on her.
What kind of question was that? Harry’s simple questions then seemed much too inadequate in a situation that was becoming much more complex. With self-consciousness in his cheeks, he tried not to make it obvious.
Over the next few turns, nothing happened to an extreme, but there were a few mentionable things. Padma Patil had to tell them the last time she masturbated and where—Harry wished he hadn’t known, lest he would still be able to look at the Gryffindor couch the same. Seamus and a few others felt different. They whispered in furious tones with leery glints in their eyes.
She had been snatched up by Mrs. Weasley the moment she stepped in the Burrow. Mrs. Weasley’d approached weary and tired looking, sweat clinging to her brow as she wiped her hands on a dirty washcloth. “The meat needs marinating, Hermione. Be a dear and help me?”
“Would you say that one man and one hundred women can produce more offspring than one hundred men and one woman?”
There, in highlighted yellow, was the cause of everyone’s grief:
At that moment—through the warm curl on his chest and the teetering edge of his vision—he wanted her gone. “Never Have I Ever watched a friend have sex.” The boisterous laughs were muted in an instant, and it was silent. But Harry had eyes for Parkinson.
He hears Teddy cackling from in front of him, and he turns his head to glower at the baby, “Oh, ha, ha. Laugh it up while you’re still able, Teds.”
Living was a kind of suffering after Sirius had passed away.
The air from his lungs is squeezed out of him in one shuddering breath. “Immunity… but…” What about Ron and Hermione? What about the others?
“Why, of course, Neville.”
“Fire call me tomorrow, Harry. I’m positive I’ve found something this time.”
Dots surpass his vision—
Hermione discovers a way into Grimmauld. “You will not go on like this,” she tells him while Kreacher cowers behind Harry in the surprise at her sudden appearance. “I won’t let you go on like this.”
Titling over with his plump camera, a photographer tried his best to capture the impassioned assemble. From the corner of his eyes, he could see Rita Skeeter writing down the overzealous words coming from a prim looking middle-aged woman.
Just a little bit of time, and then things would go back to normal and he’d no longer doubt himself. The flower petals he’d been caressing seems to die a little more at the thought.
Malfoy was chained to the center stage in the courtroom, head bowed and overgrown hair dangling in limp, greasy strands just over his knuckles. The tattered uniform engulfed him, the cuffs on the pants and sleeves rolled in.
“As you are aware, Ms. Ginerva Weasley was falsely verified at the Unification Committee. We are here to set that straight,” Nixon clarified, voice close to a purr in his confident sense of satisfaction.
He skimmed through the disarray, and stiffened, his blood running cold, at the sight of Malfoy’s gaze. He was watching him, but his eyes were faraway and bloodshot.
He throws his wrapper to the ground with gritted teeth. “Never Have I Ever been in love with my best friend.”
“We’re not saying that,” Hermione disagrees, dabbing her face with the napkin Kreacher had been begrudged to throw—at—beside her plate.
Harry straightened his wizarding robes, shying away from the hard scrutiny of the Wizenmagot. The members were scarce at the moment, yet they’d granted him 2 of the 26 remaining to handle his session.
“That’s—!”
He tells her that it's brilliant, because it is, but his eyes stray to the book in her hands like they always do. ‘How to Pinpoint a Psychopath’, the cover read.
He wasn’t certain why people were so convinced he’d get them shadowbanned from ever working in Wizarding London again.
this is the part where i apologize for the late chapter. but i won’t. so i hope you enjoyed:D
Harry can feel his face frowning before it even begins to frown, and Hermione rushes over to continue, “It would be good for the both of you. To talk, for once.”
He unclenched his grinding teeth and knocked on the plated gold
Hermione reaches for him, but his breath sticks in his throat and his head hurts and—
He exhales, allowing his buzzing magic to sink into him, vanishing the dust without a single twitch. It still crackled at his skin, but the silence was pure bliss.
Dean had smacked him so hard that he’d obtained an actual limp back to his seat.
Harry bites back his own smile. “Even if I had wanted to, Gin already registered it.” He thinks back to how her face looked at the realization she’d never get a chance to try for her dreams. “It wouldn’t be fair to take that away from her now that she’s got it. ”
Upon closing his eyes and succumbing to sleep, he wonders if Ginny would ever speak to him again if hadn’t chosen her.
“I doubt they have the means to,” he says, putting his glass down. “If they did, they’d make no mistake of doing it and coming out wrong.”
“During the summer…” Harry licks his lips as all eyes land to him. “The summer before Sixth Year.”
He nodded, thanking them and choosing to neglect their overwhelmed display of regret. They waved at him in goodbye with panic in their eyes.
The exhilaration was daunting.
—to Parkinson. But Harry knew otherwise, because he knew, without a doubt, that it had been when Malfoy took a long look at them both with something hot and heavy that settled over their hearts and consciousness.
Charlie begins to ramble on about his newest dragon, Mrs. Weasley clutching onto each detail, a worried expression taking over her face.
Outside his window pane, storm clouds were gathering in dark groups and migrating towards him in silence. He peered down at the large plant pot hanging in his hands. More water wouldn’t do for the furthering the health of his fiddle-leaf fig.
He focuses on fixing his stiff gray shirt, trying his best to ignore the holes she was burning into his skull. She spoke as though she were being asked a question she’d answered multiple times before. His ears burned. “I mean it, Hermione. Let it be.”
He wouldn’t be getting anymore favors after this it seemed.
They disappear into the lift before Harry speaks another word. He’s glad they’re gone, because now he’s unable to keep himself from laughing out loud.
“Wait,” he holds up a hand, pausing from where he’d been sliding the towel off from his neck and into his hands. Kreacher would probably snatch it the second it touched the table. “You said there wasn’t anything left to research.”
“It’s Harry Potter!”
At his stare, she huffs and sets it down.
Harry collapses into a cold slumber by the time the first ray of sunlight pokes through his curtains. His room is soon filled in silvery golds and a purple blend that is the illumination of the sun.
The heat starts up again, and he coughs. “I’m a bit tired, ‘Mione.”
She hesitates before she leaves, but she shakes her head. “You’re not alone anymore—remember that for me, alright?” His mouth gapes, and she’s gone. His dumbfounded look melts more into a grim guilt. He takes out a recent letter from his basket once the tingles of shock have faded.
on it. At their disbelieving stares, he pulled back his glamours. They jolted, scurrying to unchain the lifts and allow him entrance.
“I already know what he’s writing to me about.” Well, he didn't exactly
“Never Have I Ever drunken butterbeer,” Seamus’ voice is excited, his butterbeer jostling by his side from his jittering.
56,043 Galleons, 7 Sickles, and 20 Knuts. Harry had to pick up his jaw from the floor at the sum, despite Narcissa Malfoy’s fine in May being five times as large.
In response, Harry pressed his wand to his temple—
A small quirk of Malfoy’s lip was a paradox. “You wish,” was a cool blessing.
“Harry doesn’t have to answer you, Parkinson! He’s without a doubt—!”
Again, no one ventured into Hog’s Head. His eyes scanned the near-empty bar. No one except a head of red hair seated at a small circular wooden table that looked to be on its last breath.
Hermione smiled at him, and moved her head to face Ron. “I think your eyes are nice,” she told him, and for a second they gazed into each other’s eyes.
But, for one minute, he didn’t have to see anything or keep his mouth closed or forgive and forget.
It’s quiet for a moment, the muffled sounds of the park and the busy streets sweeping through his unwarded walls. Grimmauld had always been too hushed—he realized this the day he’d moved in on the first of June. His magic had eaten through the wards like a termite in a growing forest during the first night.
Her head twisted, and there was a brash whispering between her and, who Harry assumed to be, Ron. “I’m sorry, I have to go.” She muttered out a farewell, cancelling their call mid his response.
—to shout, He could feel his eyes burning with tears and indignation, because he could taste the wheels cracking in his head. They were both breathing hard, and the crazed gaze she’d squired was gone. Now, panic was shown as he stumbled backwards into his chair.
“Why are you here?” He asks, shifting away from the cold water dripping from his slicked hair. The towel—he’d thrown it over his neck at the insistent buzzing his floo had made while he was drying—wasn’t holding up so great. “You and Ron were… avoiding me.”
"Can't sleep," Draco said. "Can't do anything."
"I'm rubbish at everything else," Harry said, pulling away. "Up to and including getting someone pregnant. I'm just all right at this bit of it."
"We have a window box." This from his flatmate/assistant, Harry Potts, who features in the majority of Malfoy's Instagram stories, and pops up fairly regularly on TikTok, primarily as part of Malfoy's
"It's fine," Draco said. "I've made my decision, and now it's up to you to make yours. Will you bring this child up? If not, I'll speak to my solicitor about the adoption process."
"Where's Jonny?"
Jonny was still tiny and more red-faced than not, but he was starting to uncurl a little, starting to stretch out his legs as he took his bottle from Harry's arms. Harry had no clue what he was doing at any given time, but Jonny appeared to be doing okay for a very new baby, in that he wasn't losing weight and he was sleeping and crying and eating and using his nappy and the visiting healer seemed happy. Harry wasn't entirely sure he could recognise any of those things on his own, because his life had shrunk down to two hour intervals of waking and crying and feeding and changing and sleeping, and because he was so worried about Draco he couldn't fucking see straight anyway, but somehow that was magnified by Draco actually being in his house.
"I don't any more," Harry said. "And I didn't really then, either. I just wasn't exactly certain when cheese, you know, entered the whole food chain thing."
"Is everything all right?" he asked.
Draco looked at him. "I can't. What if I made him into me? What if my father made him into him?"
"I realise we're doing this backwards, but that still doesn't mean you're privy to the ins and out of my personal life."
"Hi," Hermione said, but she sounded a little careful. "Harry—"
, it said, in Draco's shaking hand.
"We don't have a shed."
"Ugh," she says. "Stop being hot. It's awful. You're awful."
"A long way away," she said. "I lost Draco and there was nothing left."
"I'd be on the guest list," she sniffs. "Hey, Harry, why don't we take some pictures of Draco reclining on his bed. That's the kind of thing underwear models do, isn't it?"
"In my defence," Harry said, "I had no idea that I should have been paying attention to the moon cycle. I'm not going to lie, I didn't even know men could get pregnant. It's been like, one long life lesson all round."
he'd done it, but it felt too private to share with Ron and Hermione, and — now that he's here — not quite the right time to share with Draco.
, or perhaps,
"Perhaps," Draco said, stroking Jonny's face with his finger.
"That was good of her," Harry said neutrally, resolving to rugby tackle Hermione to the ground next time he saw her, just so that she knew the extent of his gratitude.
"Then you've got to tell my mum."
"It's fine," Draco said shortly, and turned back around to go down into the kitchen. He sat at the table and waited for Harry to divide up their dinner.
Harry was very, very aware of how responsible he was for the baby Draco was carrying, and at the same time, a little bit pissed off that no one had every bothered fucking telling him the ins and outs of what it meant to fuck a man in the wizarding world.
"Might be," Harry said.
"I didn't know you were seeing anyone."
At the time, Harry had rather assumed it was a general statement on their poor fucking life choices, but with hindsight he was leaning towards it being slightly more about the specificity of their fucking awful timing.
When the doorbell rang, Ron called, "That'll be Hermione. I'll get it."
"I'm sorry," Draco said, but this time it wasn't directed at Harry, and Draco was crying. "I'm so sorry, Jonny, that I wasn't here."
Harry waved the Thai menu in Draco's direction. "Thought I could buy you dinner and we could talk."
Harry, who was learning how to do bookkeeping in an evening class at the local adult education centre, and who used Draco's shifts as an excuse to do his homework at the same time as carrying the coffees over to customers when Draco's hands shook too much for him to do it himself, tried to smile.
"There is no me and Draco," Harry says, which is something that could be approximately 36% true, on a bad day. He's watering the plants, in preparation for taking some pictures of Draco in his new underwear range. Pansy's just here because she - apparently - likes the aesthetic even if Draco doesn't do it for her. She's dating a banker who works 60 hour weeks, is heading for retirement, and already has a divorce and three children behind him; she can't think much of him but he has a nice bank account and, according to Draco, Pansy has already planned what she's going to do with her divorce settlement once they're finally married and she can do the decent thing and move on. If she can do it quickly enough, the exchange rate at Gringotts is set to make her a mint.
Pansy, when she came in, was dressed in very spiky high heeled shoes, and the kind of tight business dress that could quite clearly market a lot of dwellings in Basingstoke.
"Yes, I know about hormones," Ron said, "I'm not an idiot. I'm just amazed Draco Malfoy can demonstrate any kind of emotion other than gigantic fuckwit. Sorry, Harry, I know you had sex with him once."
"The compelling fragility of not standing still," Malfoy says. He stares at me and I stare back.
Harry made a face. "That sounds terrible. It's much easier when we don't."
"I am not," Draco says. "I'm taking it for a walk, aren't I? So it can feel the wind in its vents."
"It doesn't matter," Harry said. "You're here now."
"Who indeed," Hermione said, relatively faintly. "How are you this oblivious?"
"Are you all ready?"
"How's Draco?" Hermione asked, over dinner.
"I very clearly missed that part," Harry said. "Very clearly do not remember any of you ever saying, 'hey, Charlie's knocked up, he hasn't just got some random girl pregnant, the person having the baby is actually Charlie'. I'd have remembered that."
"Hmmm," Pansy says. "Who knew that Draco Malfoy could make such a good muggle?"
"Have you changed your mind?"
"Okay," he says, rather than make eye contact with either Pansy or Draco.
It's possible that's a euphemism.
"Old thing?" Hermione mouths at him, after Harry's failed to react in any way other than a general sense of pinkness around the gills. "Ginger beer? And what's with the, you know?"
"It's all sorted," Harry said. "You don't need to worry." He doesn't know why he's not told them about the nursery. Why he's not shown them it any of the hundreds of times they've been over. Why he's not told them that he'll be bringing their baby up by himself. Why Draco doesn't want to be a part of it.
"I've never had it," Draco said.
Ron showed up in advance of Hermione, bearing a chicken salad, some casserole dishes that he swore could just be warmed up whenever Harry was hungry, and a cake tin. Harry, who had slept for four hours in one go and consequently felt slightly less terrible than he had done for the past week, was relatively proud that he hadn't dropped to his knees in front of Ron just to beg him never to leave.
, Harry," Hermione yelled, barging past him and into his front hall, Ron in tow. "What the fuck?"
Harry bought a large mango on the way to Draco's flat for a takeaway and conspicuous non-discussion of their impending child, because that was how big the book said their child was, and because he quite liked mango and had never actually bought one.
"All right," Harry says equably, despite not knowing.
"Let me know if you need anything."
"Harry."
"We're not," Harry said, but Draco was already on his feet. Harry tried to pull him back into another hug, but Draco was already out the door and into the hall.
Ron came and touched his arm. "You all right?"
"I'd be less of a coward," he tells me finally, stubbing out his cigarette on the wall he's leaning against. "I'd be a hundred times braver than I ever was before. Can I keep these jeans?"
Harry continued to buy things for the nursery, up to and including a
"I've had my time to think," Draco said. "Come back in a couple of weeks and we'll talk."
"If you want me to." Draco reached out and touched his fingers to Harry's hand. "If you're asking me to stay properly."
"You're not," Harry said fiercely. "You're not alone."
"Are you drunk?" Harry asked, rubbing his eyes. He was still half asleep. He'd been asleep up until a fairly solid 63 seconds ago, and was currently standing on his doorstep in yesterday's pants and wrapped in a blanket instead of a dressing gown.
"Hello, Pansy," Harry said. "Long time, no see."
"No," Draco said. He looked paler than normal. "I'm busy, Potter."
Harry sighed miserably, and apparated to Basingstoke.
"I heard that," Draco says, throwing open his bedroom door. He's resplendent in a silk, floral dressing gown. It's new; a gift from some company or other that Harry had to sign for that morning. "And I'm not a muggle, I'm just pretending to be one. For the Instagram fame. And the presents."
"What the fucking
"Me too," Harry said. "I want that too."
"You're what," Molly said.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "What now?"
"No," Harry said. "Leave them just where they are."
Jonny responded in the only way he knew how, which was to regurgitate milk down Harry's neck, because Harry hadn't remembered to put down a cloth.
"I'm scared," Draco said. "It hurts."
"Course I did," Harry said, and he went over and wrapped his arms around Draco's shaking shoulders. "Of course I came."
Harry didn't want to go into the intricacies of his personal childhood, so he didn't. "Don't make this decision lightly," he said finally, echoing Draco's advice from a previous conversation.
The healer tucked their baby into the crook of Harry's elbow instead. Red-faced and angry, fiercely furious at being forced into the world, he was scrunched up, fists clenched, knees up to his chest. He cried in tiny, angry little wails, and Harry gathered him to his chest and knew that everything he'd ever known had changed, forever. He leaned in and pressed a kiss, his baby's first, to his forehead.
"Maybe your wards need adjusting," Harry said, looking at a point somewhere over Draco's left shoulder, just for kicks.
"Bit harsh," Harry said, eating a cheese and onion pasty. He'd started eating it whilst holding Jonny, but then he'd dropped crumbs on his head and Hermione had rolled her eyes and taken him for a fierce garden pace. "We're all right."
"Withholding pudding is a crime," Harry said, and elbowed him.
I imagine the Malfoy parents. Staid, elderly, dry. I have to imagine them, because the internet has no mention of them, at all, and Malfoy doesn't speak of them. Whoever they were, they exist as far out of society as perhaps Malfoy once did. Malfoy is notoriously elusive before his Instagram appeared, as if by magic, last year. In a world where our every action is documented online somewhere, Malfoy exists nowhere prior to his arrival on social media. It's the kind of gap that's normally compelling to a journalist, except both Malfoy and Potts laugh it off.
"My son," Harry said. "I might not be all that bright, but I wasn't ever not going to look after him."
. He stares into the middle distance. For a moment, I'm entranced by his cheekbones and forget I've asked him a question. Have I asked him a question? I wait, regardless, for an answer.
"He's got the right idea," Harry said as the back door slammed behind him.
We let him keep the Levis. I look back as we walk away. He's holding hands with Harry Potts. I don't know if that answers a question or just asks another one. He's a calculated enigma. I take a picture on my phone, and walk away.
"You are both completely incapable of dealing with normal human emotion," Hermione told him fiercely, pacing up and down the garden with Jonny in her arms. He was all wrapped up in a little coat and a little hat and little mittens and a blanket. "You are a shipwreck of a human. The two of you are completely emotionally illiterate."
"No," Harry said. "It was just on a list, you know, of things that I didn't know. When you could give them cheese. But I'm learning."
"He got quite big towards the end, you know, with the baby and everything."
"Probably true," Hermione said, and graciously allowed Harry a sip of her tea. "What do you need?"
"Well," Harry said, turning away. "That's exactly what you've got. For as long as you want us."
"Right," Ron said. "Christ, I'm going to be an uncle. To Malfoy's baby."
"Yes," Draco said. There was a pause. "And because I'm scared shitless. Also because of that."
"Harry—"
"It's possible," Harry said. "In my defence, I don't know many. Or any, really."
"Indeed," Draco said. There was a pause. "There's going to be a baby, Potter."
Harry nodded. "Yes."
Harry rolls his eyes. "You are more famous than me here."
"Yes, well." Harry nudged his way inside, past Draco and the curve of his stomach beneath his pullover, and in the direction of the metal hooks in the hallway so he could shrug off his cloak and hang it up. "Again, not my fault the subject didn't come up. And I was hardly going to get the birds and the bees talk from my aunt and uncle, was I?"
"I wouldn't know," Harry says, trying not to go pink. Draco seems relatively enthusiastic, not least because they have the extra lights set up in Draco's bedroom so he can film content and use the mirror.
"She won't get me just one book," Harry said. "And she'll tell me I'm an idiot for not getting a book before today."
"So," Pansy says. "You and Draco."
"Is he all right?" Draco looked worried.
By the time Harry got to the front door, he was properly gone, apparated away into nothing.
"We're taking the roomba for a walk," Draco says, as if it wasn't obvious to everyone that their roomba was nestled gently in a little box attached to a skateboard, which was in turn, attached to a string that Draco was holding. "We're going to the park. Even monsters deserve sunlight."
"I'm not a Weasley."
"I won't," Draco said. "I'll wait."
She nodded. "Ms Granger-Weasley's preparing her research to review with me. I believe I may have some ideas that may help." She paused. "Why all the animals?"
"Well," Harry said. "I learned that you can't give them cheese straight away."
." For a second, he thought the tears were going to come, and he was going to give himself away.
Harry held a hand out. "Come on," he said. "He's been waiting for you."
"Anyway, she didn't go," Draco went on, as if Harry hadn't kissed him. "She just made me an awful cup of coffee and asked me what I wanted more than anything else."
"Draco's only watching really old films this month," Harry says, attempting not to meet Hermione's eye. "And associated literature."
"That boy is Ferret Face Malfoy," Ron said. "How on earth did you get to the point where you were fucking Malfoy?"
"Excellent idea," Harry said. "Or work it so she gets baby sick down her neck."
"This just gets better," Hermione said. "How could you have been so stupid?"
"I don't want to."
"In my defence," Harry said, "that was around the time me and Ginny broke up, and it wasn't like I was around all that much, and no one had mentioned that it was even a possibility, so it's not my fault I didn't notice."
"Well," Harry said, as lightly as he could manage. "You can be whatever you want to be."
"Hermione says if you can put up with how crap I am on a day to day basis, I'm really quite worth knowing," Harry said. "I think she takes it as a personal affront every time I don't know something."
"More than once, actually. She doorstepped me three days in a row."
