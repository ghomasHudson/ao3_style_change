Deaths that occurred because of him. “I was taken to the manor with Ron and Hermione by the snatchers – I barely managed to get them out with the prisoners. I couldn’t leave.”
An amused smirk formed on his lips, as he stared at Malfoy. He directed an icy glare at Harry, but it didn’t affect him. It never did. Harry chuckled, and headed to the small pantry to get the rest of the essentials. “Isn’t Otryzan enclosed by ancient magic? Can’t you ask the Island to prepare the breakfast?”
He fished out the artifact and placed it on the counter with a sigh. It wasn’t a watch. It had a glamour charm on it. A potent charm. One would perceive it as a regular watch, however, it wasn’t one. It was the cup.
. He walked over to Malfoy uncertainly, and halted behind him, as his gaze landed on the picture placed on the mantle.
It wasn’t wise to go out and argue with Potter. As satisfying as it would be, he didn’t want to give in. If Potter wanted to get a rise out of him, he would only fail. Draco Malfoy didn’t want to give Harry Potter a win.
“Of the infinite lights,” He cocked his head to the side with a slow exhale while his eyes were fixated on the sky, and in a soft whisper he said, “Quite prefer the stars over the moon.”
It disturbed him, in a way. Not that he cared about Draco Malfoy. He didn’t stress over the untouched plate. Malfoy probably didn’t have an appetite. Or if Malfoy had a twisted idea in his mind, he wouldn’t know.
“Oh, no you can’t,” He said, and the corner of his lip twitched and curled into a smirk. “Previously on
Harry exhaled, slumping off the blond and on the soft sand, focusing on the stars in the night sky, to offer another distraction to the mind. “Oh, you’re an arse.”
He felt a stab of pain in the chest and for a brief moment, he felt sort of insulted, felt the familiar itch to retort with an insensitive comment, to refute the untrue accusation. Or, perhaps, comfort Draco, for once.
He looked up at Draco, admiring how the soft light spilled and splashed over Draco's hair, making it almost glow.
wasn't a straight Romeo and Juliet esque romance. It was a gay romance novel and it had intrigued him. A soft sigh escaped him, as he turned over the page. Reading the words on a page overthrew the hushed whispers in his own head.
“No, you don’t, and neither do I – if you want me to trust you, earn it for yourself – It’s not a one-way street. I’ll earn yours; you earn mine.”
–” he said with a small scoff and stared at Draco for a moment, while he calculated the next words. “don’t care about each other, Malfoy,”
Or not. Not that he cared. He would be glad to have Potter out of Otryazan. It was infuriating enough to be in a severed Island. He couldn’t deal with Harry Potter. And at the same time, he wanted to. Because he had been alone in Otryazan. Alone for five months. Or more. He didn’t count. Not anymore.
Slightly more tragic – Courtesy of a certain dark wizard – Or Tom. ‘I Am Lord Voldemort’ was such a pathetic anagram for ‘Tom Marvolo Riddle.’
He didn’t understand Malfoy. Yet, he didn’t suppose that he wanted to be on the other side of the war. It was self-preservation. A price to pay, to keep his family safe. To keep them alive. And it would induce a sort of fear. Fear of death if you don’t obey. To watch death. No, he didn’t understand Draco Malfoy.
Draco felt another stab of pain in the chest. He reached out, and caught his elbow without thinking and the brunet paused. He wanted to hold onto the self-preservation. Yet, he didn’t. A silence engulfed them, and he was unable to string a coherent sentence.
“Yes, sure,” He said in a slow, sarcastic drawl, while he, with a brief moment of consideration, inched closer to the blond, “sure, you don’t care.”
The blond pursed his lips in impatience, staring at him with steady, earnest eyes. Interested in finding out what the artifact was, if not a regular pocket-watch. “I want you to clue me in on that thing.”
Malfoy nodded, as Harry walked to the fridge and fished out the eggs, butter and milk. He closed it softly, and glanced at the blond placing the metallic items on the prep table. “Can you crack the eggs into the bowl?”
The next hallway was pitch black, but he continued through it. His scar was burning against his forehead. He scanned the area, and frowned. It was the east wing of the Manor. Yet, he had only seen a gist of it. Voldemort wasn’t here often, was he?
He could’ve refused. Yet, he hadn’t. He couldn’t pinpoint why Draco hadn’t rejected Harry the way he had, on the train, when he was eleven when he had the chance. “I – why didn’t you?”
"Consider what exactly? Whether you can actually trust me? And what, now you do?" A scoff made its way out of Draco's mouth before he could even stop it.
Draco mutters something that sounds a lot like "uncivilized brute" but Harry chooses to ignore it as he goes on.
Neither could he lose it. The ordeal was slightly infuriating. It was warmer, and pulsating in a rather familiar way. He couldn’t un-glamour it either. Or else Malfoy would find out.
He closed his eyes, as he heard the soft clinking of teacups and a frustrated groan. It wasn’t a note-hunting if he hadn’t even left one. Harry could barely refrain a chuckle.
His voice trailed. He didn’t know if he could trust Malfoy or voice those two words. And he didn’t want to get into another argument or a fight. He wasn’t sure if he would fight back.
“Or we can curse,” Draco continued to curse, undeterred with the fact that he couldn’t string words into coherent sentences. It was sort of comical to watch the feeble attempts. “Finished, Malfoy?”
He wanted to obliterate the fucking watch. The closer he was to it, the worse it would be.  It wasn’t an actual pocket-watch, he had cast a glamour on it while he was in the Malfoy manor.
“Mhm, not quite,” He said with a chuckle, the hand on the back trailing to the right shoulder and adjusting it, and with a twitch of the fingers, he extracted it. “now, practice the wand motion.”
He clenched his jaw and his fists were curled to the side, with his fingernails buried in the calloused palm as he exhaled unevenly. “It’s nothing.”
“Put the goddamn ice skates on,” Harry said, loudly than he’d been wanting to. They received a few stares from the muggles, and Draco gave him a sharp glare. “Do you want me to drag you there?”
“You had to ruin the hope, didn’t you?” He said with a scoff. “I wanted to wish on a genie – if we ever find a magical lamp – and ask for a flying carpet, and find a way out of the fucking Island.”
He stared at a distance and with a faint smile, he said, “well, I suppose you did, considering you still didn’t light me on fire. Yet.”
He half-turned to leave, the weight of tears behind his eyelids getting heavier by the moment, and whispered a soft, “I didn’t have one.”
“You can,” Potter whispered with a ghost of a smile on his lips. It was almost surreal. No banters. No arguments. Only a light conversation. “It’s just not the world you want to be in because it’s harsh.”
He walked out of the bedroom, and let out a resigned sigh as his gaze flickered to Malfoy nibbling on a chocolate chip cookie. “You finished half of the batch.”
No, he didn’t get splinched. That would’ve been paradise, considering he was still on the Island, only a few yards away from the seashore. In the same Island as Draco Malfoy.
Harry shifted in place with a soft grunt, fingers searching for the small branch poking one side. “It’s not –” The fingers circled around the thin branch and he tossed it aside. “comfortable.” A sigh. “why are we here?”
“Oh, no.” Draco said with a short laugh and re-adjusted to cast the Patronus which still wasn’t precise. “I’m better than everyone else. An opinion that is backed up with sufficient evidence, Potter.”
He let his magic build up, and directed its flow at the shell as he willed it to himself. The magic in him was shifting, and he was trying to keep it steady. The shell was unable to make up its mind, and it alternated between floating in the air and coming towards him – It decided to stay afloat.
“You should rest.” Draco cut him off with a relented sigh. The Patronus charm was complex with a wand, and to conjure a corporeal one without a wand in Otryazan was undoubtedly insanely exhausting and he didn’t want it to worsen.
“I’ll find a way out,” He said with a relented sigh, carding his fingers through the unruly black hair falling over the right eye. “If I want to win the war, considering the fate rests on the so-called Chosen One.”
With an uncertain sigh, Harry pushed the door open. It created a soft creaking sound. Draco was perched on the bed, reading a novel. “Draco –” He whispered with a soft knock on the door. “can I come in?”
If he even performed a simple charm, it would tax him to an extent where he would be out for as long as a week or a month.
He didn’t reply. Instead, he closed his eyes and exhaled softly. “We have our own ways of dealing with grief. And I knew that you wouldn’t cry. You wanted to channel the grief into another emotion.”
“I’m observant.” He cursed under his breath. It wasn’t even remotely convincing – Because Harry Potter wasn’t supposed to know how Draco Malfoy liked his tea. “As the saying goes: Know thy enemy.”
"Sweetheart, let me do it, you'll end up burning the pan." This was delivered with a soft kiss on Draco's cheek and Harry being indignantly shoved away from the stove.
He sighed. Reciting the story of Rapunzel while baking cookies was certainly a sign of losing whatever bit of sanity he had left. “Can’t we bake in peace?”
“You don’t pause for one second to calculate your words, do you?” Draco underlined the words with a glare. “The one person you don’t want to be with – who would you rather prefer, Potter?”
“You probably have a broken jaw with a frankly worrying number of cuts and bruises and it will scar. I don’t care if you decide to drown yourself or get back to your useless attempts at getting out of here, Potter.”
"Hey," He whispered in a slow, uncertain voice as he nudged the blond. It had to be subtle. Not a 'I'm uttering a quick apology because my conscience decided to guilt-trip me into it. No, certainly not. It had to be subtle, yet sincere. "I - erm - never knew you weren't offered a choice."
Or the Patronus charm to be precise. He was rather stunned when he had produced a corporeal one without a wand or a sporadic result. It was certainly progress, considering he could barely levitate seashells four days ago.
“No, we’re not sworn rivals,” He paced over the other side of the counter. “You’re a Malfoy with blond hair and posh robes,” Draco softened and cracked a small, uncertain smile, “we’re friends.”
It caused the familiar flutter in his chest, with a hint of warmth. The blond untwined the tangled fingers, and cleared his throat. “You can point a constellation and not a star?”
“Will you,” Malfoy intoned, stifling a laugh with a hand placed over the mouth. Yet, it didn’t work. “ever – ever shut up about
"Your endearments are absolutely absurd, Potter," Draco frowns at him for good measure, "And I'll have you know I detest them."
There was a dark feeling that the horcrux behind him was emitting. And his own panic and desperation. Bellatrix was expectant, gleeful at the prospect of hurting him.
“Why would you care?” Draco’s said with a small shrug and his features feigned indifference. “In fact, why, pray tell, would you offer a chance at a friendship, when you are intent to find a way out of Otryazan?”
“Y-yeah.” Malfoy had a pink tint on the cheeks. It was faint. Perhaps, it was the cold. “yeah, sure.”
one. “not fractured, I hope.” Draco lifted a brow at him. “oh, for Circe’s sake, I’ll adjust to the friends with Draco Malfoy concept within a few –” A beat. “a week, I’ll adjust within a week.”
He could go to the Order base. Ron and Hermione would certainly be there, and he had no other location in mind. Besides, he wanted to see Remus.
With a chuckle, the brunet removed the black cloak he was wearing and draped it over Draco’s shoulder. “Oh, it’d be worth it to watch you suffer from cold,” He whispered with a slight shiver. “so fucking worth it.”
“It’s – a healing charm,” He curled his fingers into a fist at the side. It wasn’t a clever idea – which was becoming a running theme – to heal the cuts. “It was–”
“If we’re clear about the fact that I still can’t stand you and I fucking don’t want to be around you –
on me,” It wasn’t accusatory. It was soft, and almost pained. And it caused a pang of guilt in his chest. “and I still couldn’t find a way to detest you, Potter.”
“You – fucking – liar.” Draco said, punching him a lot harder. Once. Twice. Until it was a lot, and he stared at Potter. And the softness in the gaze was enough to make him pause. Only for a moment. “He can’t be dead.”
The blond frowned, and the corner of his lip twitched. In retrospect, he should’ve known that the cup would be in the manor. It would’ve saved him the trouble.
The knife wouldn’t work. He could work with a teacup, and possibly shatter it. He wanted to get a reaction out of Malfoy. Only once.
He had struck a nerve. In hindsight, he shouldn’t have played the Sirius Black card. He had witnessed a momentary flicker of guilt across Potter’s face. He didn’t suppose that Potter would bare his soul in front of Draco Malfoy. Not again. Not after Draco had used it against him.
“Where are we going?” Draco asked, out of curiosity. Harry only chuckled, because the blond had absolutely no idea and he would probably have a stroke if he knew. “Will you just – I won’t kiss you.”
He couldn’t leave. It wasn’t an order. It was an obvious conclusion. He had to leave. He had to find the horcruxes. And he didn’t have a lot of time. “Where are we, Malfoy?”
“No, I didn’t.” He muttered as he turned his gaze towards the window, and focusing on the soft sound of the waves crashing against the shore. “All the pain – the loss – the guilt – It turned into rage.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered softly, with a brief touch of fingertips, and it sent shivers down his spine. “I know.”
A silence lingered in the air, and for a brief minute, Draco couldn’t quite figure out when the exchange of silent confessions of truth had started with Potter. “Are you fond of the night-sky?”
"Very much so," Draco sneers but it loses most of its effectiveness because of the blush still staining his cheeks.
Instead of worsening it, he walked into the bedroom and closed the door behind him. It wasn’t a lot. A double bed was placed in the centre, and a white wardrobe was against the wall. A small candle chandelier hung in balance, casting a soft light on the room.
On that night, the owl returned with two notes. One was in the familiar elegant cursive and it said: “
The corners of Draco’s mouth curved into a small, brief smile, which wasn’t the reaction the brunet had anticipated, yet he was
A hint of curiosity flickered across Malfoy’s face, as if he wanted to hear about it. Only for a second. “To have hair with healing powers is insanely absurd, Potter.”
Harry frowned as his fingers curled around the mirror in his pocket. It was a shard of the two-way mirror. A broken piece of a gift, given to him by Sirius. He had asked for a way out of the Malfoy manor.
“I am too proud to ask, and you won’t talk because: a) You’re stubborn b) ‘It’s Draco Malfoy – A death eater. He always has an ulterior motive.”
The familiar fear coursed within him, and he had to focus on the crash of the waves to send the thoughts out of his mind. On Draco’s warmth and the soft snores.
He stepped backwards, when the curve of Malfoy’s back uncurled. “wait – don’t rush into it – concentrate for a minute before you cast the Patronus charm.”
Harry was lying on the sand, with his eyes closed. He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he was drained – Had he conjured a fucking wandless Patronus? It was absurd. To conjure a corporeal Patronus by a wand was a feat. He would’ve applauded himself, only if he wasn’t screaming in pain.
He guided the wand in a circular motion and a silvery mist, stretched and curled around him, even as it started to dispel. It was pronounced than the ones he had cast before He caught a breath in excitement.
“Yes, Frodo.” Draco said with a sarcastic drawl. “Blaise gifted it on my fifteenth birthday, and if we’re quite finished with the pleasantries, why don’t you find a way back to the shire?”
He had a perfect incentive to infuriate Draco Malfoy with the sarcastic retorts or quips – minus the insensitive ones, considering he wasn’t in a condition to fight. “Won’t.”
“It’s –” Draco’s warm breath brushed on the side of the brunet’s neck, causing a shiver to travel down his spine, his arm circling around Malfoy’s waist in a firm grip. “It’s not – no.”
“Yeah, it is.” Malfoy muttered, with a scowl “It’s Otryzan, Potter. Not Ogygia. And I’m not Calypso. The Dark Lord wanted me to suffer, not send me on a vacation. If I use my magic, the Island provides. It does not obey.”
That earns him a punch on the arm from Draco–a hard one at that. And he drops his hands, cackling and totally unbothered by the icy glare directed at him.
He wished Malfoy would’ve written that down and left it on the counter. And he would’ve retorted with a clever quip. He wanted a light banter with Malfoy.
“It’s not the saviour complex,” Harry said with a soft snort while he cast a glance at Draco in faint concern when the blond stifled a grunt of pain. Perhaps, the Patronus had worn him out. “Plus, the operative word was wanted and I can’t focus on career options when I'm not certain if I'll survive in the war, can I?"
It floated in the air and into the room with an added weight. Odd. When he received a muffled ‘thank you’ in response, he placed his wand on the counter and wiped a sheen of sweat on his forehead.
Malfoy was sort of confused, and perhaps uncertain. He paused to consider, frowning at the kitchen counter. “If you tone down the excessive sarcasm and the smart, wonderful Potter bit, then yes.”
“Quit with the saviour nonsense, for one.” Potter whispered with a small snort, pacing over to the bed, his calm composure shifting slightly, “I’m not the saviour or the Chosen One.” A beat. “you can’t rely on The Prophet.”
Harry stared at the sea, and inched closer to the edge. With a shaky breath, he focused on the destination and disapparated with a faint pop.
A silence lingered in the air. He wasn’t sure if he should ask him about the reason he was here. He wasn’t entirely convinced that it wasn’t one of Voldemort’s plan. In the end, it was about self-preservation. And he didn’t trust Malfoy. But the sneaky glint in his eyes was missing, and his mouth was set in a thin line.
The usual raw energy pulsing around Potter was much calmer considering he was asleep. Draco stared at his face. He looked different while he was sleeping. He had a childish innocence on his face. It was probably because the eyes weren’t glaring at him. Weren’t sending cold stares.
Harry arched an eyebrow at him. His first instinct was to laugh. The second was to decline the offer with a quip or a retort. However, he settled for the third. “At what price?”
In retrospect, he shouldn’t have used the ‘death eater’ card. It was a cheap shot and a sensitive topic at that. But Malfoy had used the ‘Sirius’ card. It was insensitive. Harry had lost his patience. Not that he had much patience to begin with.
He wanted to ask. He wanted to ask a lot – Yet, Malfoy wouldn’t answer for the same reasons he wouldn’t. He had secrets of his own. And so did Malfoy.
“Moronic fuck – yes, we’ve established that thrice,” He whispered a soft curse while he forced the small flutter out. Yet, he couldn’t ignore the fact that his hand was clasped in Draco’s cold ones. “friends?”
His eyes cracked open, as he heard a soft chuckle above him. Malfoy had an amused smirk on his face, and a gleam in his eyes. “Still lurking around, are you?”
He had described the sky near the seashore at night, under the light of the stars. Yet, the curiosity lingered in the air: Why had Draco Malfoy painted the sky of Harry's fancy?
The soft silver light of the stag was comforting. The presence of a patronus twined and circled around him in a cocoon of warmth. The hum was slower. It was nearing the end.
The water trailed down his body, and he rested his head against the tiles. He was so tired. So tired of finding a way out of Otryazan only to fight one more battle with barely any room to recover.
“Yes, Potter.” Malfoy said with a long sigh, not quite thrilled with the interruption. “It’s spontaneous, which is the reason you obtain a sporadic result and it wears you out – control it – will it to obey you.”
Yeah. Bold of him to assume. In his defence, Malfoy had draped a fucking blanket over him. And it seemed like Draco Malfoy did care. A bit. He couldn’t get used to that either. He didn’t retort. The crepes were divine and he wanted to eat in peace.
The silvery mist began to take a vague shape; tall, with four legs and a long neck, floating in the cold air for a minute or two until it vanished. “I – It was – well, vague.”
“It all begins and ends in your mind.” Harry said, with a strained smile. “What you give power to, has power over you, if you allow it.”
“Plus, if you screw it up,” One corner of Harry's lip twitched and quirked upward. “we won’t sort it out for four or five weeks when your inflated –” A pause. “when rule six in your code of conduct forbids you to.”
?” A sharp pain flared in his right side, causing him to wince, wishing it wasn’t a fractured rib. Or ribs. “If you couldn’t walk –”
In conclusion, he couldn’t ignore Malfoy for more than five seconds. He could barely resist a sarcastic retort. Plus, teaching Malfoy to produce a corporeal Patronus ensued a few serious conversations and he wasn’t certain if he wanted to converse with Draco Malfoy. “Why a stag?”
“If I had wings, I would fly to Neverland and leave you in Otryazan, Potter. I can barely stand you for two seconds.”
“Well,” Malfoy mumbled, placing the wand in the cloak and carding his fingers through his hair with a relented sigh as he leaned against the rough bark of the tree. “
“I could, if you quit with the threats – Or the not-so intimidating glares – We could start with the Patronus if you want to and I place five sickles on it.” He said with a faint smirk. “I’d place more if I had it.”
On that night, Draco Malfoy draped a warm blanket over Harry Potter. He watched, as the flames of the fireplace danced across his face. And a warmth coursed through him, even if only for a brief moment.
Harry snatched the can, and pointed it at the blond. Malfoy backed away, and gave him a warning glare. “It was an accident, Potter. Don’t you dare –
“I know,” He said, sighing softly as he carded his fingers through his hair. “I’m used to it. Four days isn’t a lot.”
“No. I don’t care. It’s – well, I’m returning the favour considering you didn’t leave me on the rooftop when you could’ve and," A beat, "I won’t light you on fire, maybe.”
Malfoy smirked. “Not that I care about you, Potter. But if you die in Otryazan, your death will be a minor inconvenience – I’ll mourn the crepes.”
with a small shrug, holding out a hand, which was sort of – odd – Harry Potter didn’t offer Draco Malfoy a helping hand up. Draco was rightfully sceptical. “Come on.”
Harry tilted his head up to accept another kiss, jumping as the clock struck midnight, and the end of the Yule Ball. "I suppose that forever is a fantasy that we can't have, can we?"
He cursed under his breath. Malfoy was his – arch nemesis. Or was he? An acquaintance? Sort of debatable. He wasn’t in his right mind, was he?
He was no longer outright laughing, but the sparkle of amusement was still behind his eyes. Draco tried to send a withering glare at him, but it didn't faze him. “You’re infuriating, Potter.”
Malfoy arched an eyebrow at him and as if he was speaking to an invisible crown said: “Oh, the overachieving chosen one.” He said in a monotone. “I resented your overachieving abilities.”
He smirked, as he stared at the blond. In the soft light of the moon, his pale skin had an almost angelic glow and he had a glint in his grey eyes. “We’ve already established that, haven’t we?”
An uncomfortable silence lingered in the air. The wind brushed against his face, and he closed his eyes to listen to the sound of the waves. The sound of water crashing and retreating to the sea, only because it could overthrow the whispers in his own head.
He frowned in confusion, as he scanned the area. To the south-west, he saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was still buried in the mist. They were sharp and conical in figure.
“True,” He said, closing the files and placing it on the side as he leaned in to place a chaste kiss on his lips. Only a brush of lips. “Night, Malfoy.”
Perhaps, the sky was sort of a black canvas for Draco and he was painting it with stars and constellations. He traced back to the canvas the blond had painted. “Yeah, it’s quiet.”
Malfoy absent-mindedly inched slightly closer to him as he whispered, “Because you were always so fucking perfect and I wasn’t.”
“Right, I’ll consider it as a back-up career,” If he could trash himself in the Prophet for a good laugh, it was a good back-up career option. Besides, it’d be a definite improvement from the fictitious news of how he was the
“Right,” The air which was comfortable a second ago, was now taut. He untwined the fingers with a slight reluctance and curled it around the cup. It was warm. “former rivals, now friends.”
He closed his eyes, as he thought about a sky of his own. “Beautiful. A perfect mix of deep violet and black. Alive with raw energy – Stars lighting the sky like snow-flakes. Chaos – infinite and eternal. Yet, the stars aren’t bright.”
“You don’t say.” Harry said, with a hint of sarcasm. He couldn’t put up with Malfoy. He would rather get splinched than stay here any longer. A missing piece. He was missing a piece of this puzzle.
and flip the bird at fate. Or not. It would worsen the situation. Not that he never wanted a vacation, but to be stranded on a severed Island with Draco Malfoy was not a fucking vacation.
Draco stared at him; the confusion evident on his face. Harry would always use a pet name, and give him a kiss. At least one. “Is everything alright, Harry?”
He lifted his eyes off the floor with a soft huff, a corner of the mouth curving into the well-practiced smirk while he said, “Oh, what’s the fun in that, Potter?”
"Mhm, yes." Draco said with a short laugh while they turned to the rhythm. For once, it felt like there were less eyes on them. Like there was just one single tree in the forest.
“Hey,” The brunet smiled, and nudged him softly with a chuckle. “Quite a surprise to find out you aren’t the insufferable, snot-nosed, numb-skulled git you were for six fucking years.”
When he had paused, he had seen a flicker of understanding in Potter’s eyes. It was almost as if he had known. Or he had been there. “Why?”
And then, he couldn’t take it anymore. He felt a loud ringing in his ears. The voice that was too close yet too far away. He clenched his fists to his side, his fingernails digging into them. He didn’t want to hurt Potter. Because he wasn’t fighting back.
Malfoy was quiet, a frown etched on his face, probably calculating the next words, fumbling with one of the gloves he was wearing. “Do you suppose your Patronus will be related to one of your – to Narcissa or Lucius?”
Narcissa would often sing it to him when he was eleven. The hum was closer to her and he wanted to be eleven for one second.
It wasn’t laced with malice. Instead, it was sort of a sarcastic, offhanded quip, which caused a Potter to smile in soft amusement. “I’m sorry?”
“Wouldn’t dream of anything else,” Harry chuckled. “I didn’t want you to have a fit at seven in the morning.”
"Giving in to what?" Harry breathed, slightly breathless at the way Draco held him close again, swaying lightly to the music.
"If I said I want you to dance with me forever or if I want you to kiss me under the light of the thousand ceiling stars," Draco whispered, in a soft, vulnerable voice, "would you?"
He focused on the shell and on the magic coursing through him. It wasn’t working, and he groaned in frustration, wishing that the ridiculous shell would move. And it did.
A pitch-black sky didn’t long for permanence. It didn’t have any stars to carry. Only a never-ending loneliness. And he was the sky, in a way. Alone. A black sky was a mirror of absence.
“Draco –” Potter crossed his arms over his chest in a typical closed-off stance and leant on the doorframe, fingers circled around the cup. “can we not fight for five minutes?”
He gave a shake to his head, staring fixedly at the floor. Harry chuckled, as he poured another portion of the batter into the pan. “Get a few strawberries and whipped cream, if you have it – t’s a request, Malfoy. Wipe the scowl off your face – And chop the strawberries into small slices.”
Malfoy tilted his head to the sky, closing his eyes for a brief minute and exhaling slowly. The corner of the mouth downturned, and his voice cracked when he said, “I – erm – Yes. I’m still mourning father.”
“It’s not nothing,” Draco said with a scoff, resisting the urge to reach out and when his fingers twitched at the side. “You performed a complex spell without a wand and it’s taxing you.”
“M’fine,” He whispered in a soft voice, which was rather daft, considering the blond was leaning on him and couldn’t stand upright without support. Or the fact that he was burning up. “it’s cold.”
“Add one cup of flour,” Harry said, with a small smile. With a scowl, Malfoy added the flour into the mixing bowl and placed it down with a soft groan and a few curses, mostly with the ‘f’ word. “Always the dramatic one.”
’ bit wasn’t on his to-do list. Or on any to-do list. It was on the not to-do list. He didn’t have one.
The sound reached to his consciousness and he absent-mindedly curled his fingers into the maroon sweater the brunet was wearing with the faintest smile and he shifted a bit.
“An astute observation, Potter. I would’ve applauded, but I’m occupied with a crucial task of finishing the rest of the cookies.”
it on purpose,” Draco cut him off mid-sentence, with his mouth caught open on the soft vowel sound. “we argued –” He winced. “where you said that I –” A beat. “was the one person you didn’t want to be with,” Draco’s ribs tightened at the crack in his own voice, “why are you here to sort it out if you don’t care?”
Harry stared at the canvas. It was a night sky, and it was oddly familiar. A perfect mix of violet and black. Dim speckles of stars and a soft orb of moonlight in the sky.
A beacon of light pierced through the delicate glass. Warm yellow rays were drifting through the window. Dust modes floating, suspended in the air. Draco mused through the kitchen cabinet, only to close it with a loud thud. He set the saucer and the cup out, pouring the tea with a delicate swish of his hand.
Malfoy circled around the couch, and ran back to the kitchen and around the island with a wide grin on his face. Harry caught his wrist, and drew him close until they were nose-to-nose.
It wasn’t cold – well, not much anyway – it was sort of moderate temperature-wise, which was sort of confusing but Otryazan was an odd place and it was wiser to not question it. “Draco, can you walk?”
The words were cut short when Draco tripped over a protruding stone, fingers clutching into a fist on Harry's sleeve and throwing the both of them off-balance, sending them crashing together on the sand.
He lost control over the charm, causing the small rocks and seashells to tremble slightly. It halted as he dismissed his concerns. He had to believe Ron and Hermione were safe. Alive and safe. Or it would be a never-ending cycle. And he had a lot to stress over. A lot, including – No, he couldn’t think about it.
He, however, wasn't good with reassurances. In fact, he wasn't good with words. He could come up with a quip to lighten the situation. Yet, he had an odd constriction in the throat and he couldn't force out the words. So, he waited. Reconsidered. "No, wait, why wouldn't I -" He could barely maintain an even tone, "Oh, for Godric's sake, why wouldn't I care, Draco?"
“Oh, shut up.” The blond wrapped a warm cloak around him. “If you’re quite finished with the remarks –”
A silence engulfed them. Pregnant and uncomfortable. Maybe Malfoy was still pissed off about the entire ‘
Draco cursed and extracted his arm with a sigh, ignoring the flutter in his chest. “Rest – I’ll brief you on it when you can function – Besides, I could do with a bit of peace and quiet.”
It was pitch-black, for a while. He waited. Waited for his pupils to adjust to the absence of light. Within a moment, the outline of Draco’s figure was visible. A faint luminescence of the moon cascaded inside through the windows. “Godric, what –”
He tilted his head at the sky, and could vaguely trace a constellation with his fingertip, lining it with the three stars and at a bluish star – Regulus.
He wasn’t exactly familiar with building a raft, and he didn’t suppose that it would get him out. He could sense the magic that the Island was radiating. It wasn’t going to be that easy.
He opened his eyes and wisps of silver were circling in front of him, only to vanish in the air. No, it wasn’t the right one. He had to focus on something else.
“It’s not a –” Draco arched a brow while he squinted at the cup. If one charm could conceal the cup, to perceive it in a certain way, it was a rather potent one. He could slowly feel himself giving into his curiosity but thankfully, his frustration at Potter was overpowering then. “not a sufficient clarification for what you said a while ago.”
“If the genie can fulfil wishes, you could wish for the war to end instead of flying out of Otryazan with a carpet and fighting a war against The Dark Lord.”
Draco cursed under his breath. He had tossed the parchment aside instead of leaving it on the kitchen counter. And he wouldn’t admit it out loud, but the notes were an effort. An effort to have a subtle conversation – A banter – instead of an apology.
“No, you’re fucking infuriating and I can’t deal with you, Potter.” Draco said, with a soft sigh, raising his gaze from the sky to stare at the brunet. “A Hufflepuff – certainly. A Gryffindor – Never.”
“Of course,” He whispered, with a reluctant smile of his own and ignoring the small flutter. “I wouldn’t forget the matches, considering I won against you, would I?”
He sighed, carding his fingers through the unruly hair. If the note wasn’t on the counter, it was probably with Malfoy. A subtle way to answer the question on the note.
“Oh, who said I had a change of heart?” Harry said with a scoff while he nicked the cup off the bed and absent-mindedly started to turn it in his hand. “The operative word was
The surface was soft, but he groaned in pain. He frowned, searching frantically for his glasses. His fingers brushed against the familiar frame, lying on the ground. He placed his glasses back in place, and cursed under his breath. The lenses were cracked. And he didn’t have a wand.
It was a cloudless night. The moon wasn’t shining too brightly. The stars were bright and twinkling and he could make out a few constellations with no effort at all.
“Why, thank you – It’s a privilege to be the worst the Chosen One has ever trained – wait, didn’t you run a small group in the fifth year, Potter?”
A short, yet amused laugh escaped Draco’s mouth which caused the brunet to curse and he was quite pleased to earn a reaction out of Potter. “Glad we cleared it out.”
The calloused fingers curled around the hand and Draco’s grip tightened on the wand. He couldn’t relax. Not when Potter was holding Draco’s hand in his own, raising it to point the wand in the front while hand resting on the back. “You’re tense – ease up.”
The blond lifted a brow in skepticism and for a brief moment, a wry amusement flickered across Draco’s features. “Aren’t you fluent in childish trash talk though?”
The blond offered him a curt nod and he returned to the novel, flipping to the next page and muttered, “It’s a gay romance.”
“No,” Draco said, trying to still his tremble with a force of indifference. “You fucking don’t know if my father is dead – You’re a liar – You fucking don’t know.”
’ I will not quit, considering it’s an incentive to rile you up, Malfoy.” He said, casting a quick cleaning charm on the plate. “Ever.”
“Wait,” He said with a faint smile, wanting to diffuse the tension. Not that he was perfect. It was sort of an incentive to irritate Malfoy, considering he had said it. “you think I’m perfect?”
Draco drew the cloak closer – a soft warmth with a familiar earthy, peaty scent with the touch of lilac engulfed him – and it was comforting. “Chances are that you – our dear little Chosen One – will catch a cold.”
A death eater was firing spells at him, and he was barely dodging them. Yet, he wasn’t scared. He had managed to get Ron and Hermione out of the manor, with the prisoners. His lips curved into a satisfied smirk, and he stunned the death eater.
No. He couldn’t blame Potter. His father had known. He had fucking known, that if he extended even the slightest bit of help to Draco, he would be breaking the vow. And he had done it anyway.
“No, fuck you, you don’t care,” Draco countered in a hoarse whisper. He sounded wretched. Yet, he had a bitter lilt to the tone, “you and I, we’re rivals and I would prefer it to remain that way.”
“I don’t,” He whispered, as he marked the page and placed it on the table. Holding the man by Timothy Conigrave. An Australian author. A muggle. “It's good."
“I’ve read Boy Culture once. Or the half of it,” Potter said, and Draco forced the relentless thoughts out of his mind and arched an eyebrow at him. “It was Seamus’, I suppose. I didn’t finish it.”
“Not everything,” He said and the corners of his mouth quirked up. “when you were eleven, you were fond of fairy-tales –
“I’m astounded,” Draco said with a soft snort while he cast a contemplative glance at the brunet. “How did you solve such complex riddles over the course of six years with your low level of intelligence, Potter?”
He could hear soft footsteps approaching him, but he didn’t care. He was tired, and he wanted to fall asleep before he died. Or before he was set on fire by Draco fucking Malfoy.
“The ancient magic in Otryazan will wear you out with the simplest charms.” Malfoy whispered; his gaze fixed on a picture on the mantle. “It’s easier with a wand.”
Potter had said it in such a small voice, laced with regret and Draco had absent-mindedly reached out to comfort the brunet with a touch. One brief touch.
Harry let him on the ground for a few moments before skating over and pulling him to his feet. He clung to him as he guided him to the wall again. He caught a look at Draco’s sulking face, and his peals of laughter broke out again.
The silence returned, and it was rather uncomfortable. He turned to leave, and Malfoy reached out and caught his elbow without thinking, tightening his grip and he only half-turned back.
Malfoy had a faint smile on his lips. It was kind of a small amused smile and it caused a tiny flutter in his chest and a warmth coursed through him briefly. “You?”
Hermione would’ve figured it out. Would’ve figured out what it was. He wished Ron and Hermione were with him. Seven years. Seven years with a family. Not friends. A family.
She would be a lot calmer as she cleaned the house and hummed along with the music. She was a little tolerant and wouldn’t yell as much. And it was the only reason he still liked the song.
“It’s –” Draco swallowed and half-turned with a soft sigh, his Adam’s apple bobbed in the soft candlelight and he whispered, “forget it, Potter,” a moment, “you won’t care.”
Perhaps, it was love that was stuck there in his throat, if the rambling passion he felt for him that he couldn't form words, "Draco I -"
“No idea.” Draco said with a soft chuckle, shifting with a groan. “we’re –” He winced and raised his nimble, trembling fingers to the cut on the top of the cheekbone. “well, we’re in an incredible amount of pain.”
With a minute of consideration, he yanked Draco sideways with the collar of his cloak and was halfway on top of the blond, pinning him down with one thigh, and Malfoy’s lips split into a smile. “Quite finished, Malfoy?”
“Draco, what –” He was cut off when the blond raised a hand with a slight quiver and rose from the bed and paced over to the door, he paused for a brief second, however, when Harry whispered, “Draco.”
It caused a flicker of curiosity in Draco, yet he maintained a mien of indifference on the face. He was certain it was the artifact and he intended to find out what it was, considering it certainly wasn’t a normal pocket-watch.
Draco softened, the back of the index finger clinking on his own and it lingered for a minute. Two. “Who wouldn’t want to be friends with the Chosen One?”
“Oh, are you?” He said with an unamused snort, and he scowled at the oh-so satisfied smirk etched on Malfoy’s face. “you’re possibly the worst I’ve ever trained.”
“Oh, fair enough.” He said with a snort. A pause. Draco placed a hand on his mouth, stifling a laugh. Christ, the situation was an ongoing catastrophe. “wait, perfect face?”
He exhaled softly, and avoided Potter’s gaze as he exposed his soul slightly. “A small quest to discover the universe of fairy-tales and fantasies.”
Falling stars. The whisper of wish on the stars. The flashes. The owl didn’t wait. It soared in the sky, and towards the owlery. He read it out-loud and for a brief moment, a falling star flashed in his mind. Yet, it was only a blur.
Fantastic. The never-ending chaos wouldn’t cease. He had to focus on the flow of the magic if he wanted to perform advanced spells. An advanced spell to find a way out of Otryazan.
The kitchen was small. The upper cabinets were white. On the left was the stove, below the stove was an oven. The peninsula was white, with grey cabinets and a silver refrigerator adjacent to the peninsula.
He shivered slightly, as he rubbed his palm to produce a bit of heat. Malfoy chuckled and he slid a spare cloak towards him. “I was fairly certain you would come to find me.”
“Yeah, I don’t. Your death, on the contrary, would be a minor inconvenience. We don’t want the Chosen One to die, do we?” He said in a slow drawl. “The fate of the wizarding world rests upon you.”
"Draco, I want to dance with you tonight," He said with a soft sigh. "the prophet can fuck itself, plus, it'll be factual news for once and I'd rather not focus on it when I can dance with you," A beat. "can we?"
He waved a hand through the air in front of him, as if doing so would help him search for the right words and grab them out of thin air. His mind was still muddled with regret from his ignorance of wording and whiplash from Draco's sudden change in attitude. “Our fight, right now,” he couldn’t, however, obtain them. It truly wasn’t his forte. “Lord of the Rings,” he cleared his throat. “Poetry? Be more clear, please.”
He was focused on the small cut on top of Draco’s face. A tinge of red on the pale skin. He frowned. It would scar. “Can you –” Uncertainly, the brunet reached out, cut Draco mid-sentence, tracing his thumb in the direction of the cut, whispering a soft ‘
He tilted his head to the sky, and his eyes were fixed on the white orb of light within the stars. The moon was uncertain. Alone. Created with imperfections. Yet, it was still beautiful. Human. It was human in the chaos.
“I’ve lost track of our conversation now,” Draco closed his eyes for a brief second and carded his fingers through his hair, “can you forget about the skin and hair care routine or will I have to
, Malfoy,” He raised his hands in surrender when Draco lifted a brow, not amused the poor imitation, “your words, not mine,”
As they're cuddling on the sofa, Harry nuzzles his face into Draco's hair to hide his shit-eating grin.
The sunlight leaked under the curtain, flowed over the windowsill and saturated the duvet cover. He wiped the beads of sweat on his forehead with a soft sigh.
He cursed. “Weren’t we clear over the fact that I had to leave Otryazan to defeat the wicked witch of the west with red cat eyes?” A quip to lighten the situation. “We were, right?”
“Pardon me, we’re baking chocolate chip cookies for supper and you were reciting a fairy-tale a few minutes ago. Is that what enemies do?”
“I was,” Draco said with a small smile, tracing his mind back to when he was a child, and would stare at the wide-expanse of the night-sky for hours. “It’s beautiful, of course, yet –
An odd sort of guilt stirred in him, as his mind traced to the brief flicker of hurt across Malfoy’s face. He should’ve calculated his words carefully. He had been insensitive and sort of irritated. Not that it was an excuse or – wait – He didn’t care about Malfoy. It wasn’t supposed to trouble him. It shouldn’t. Yet, it did.
He walked back to the house. A bit of magic had cleared his head. He wasn’t stressing over the argument. He had an impending doom hanging over his head, and he didn’t want to add Malfoy to the list of crises he had to deal with. He had to rest. Not worry.
“I’m not. It’s an emotion specific to those who care. I don’t care about you, but your arrival here is quite inconvenient, Potter.”
A frown creased Draco’s forehead. The odd glint had faded. The eyes were unfocused. Confused. It was one of the effects. “I – what?” The voice was small. “what is that –” He stopped short, sighing, mouth twisting as he fought to find the right word. “what is that thing?”
It was to save his family. It was self-preservation. But that was only a tiny fraction of it. He was a knot of fear, resentment, uncertainty and panic. He couldn’t stop the trembling in his voice as he said, “I – I didn’t want to.”
It wasn’t prancing as it usually would. It was dissolving into the air. Harry felt a shiver run down his spine as he struggled to stay upright, but his knees gave in.
“You wanted to be friends not five minutes ago,” He paced over to the other side. “In fact, you’ve wanted to be my friend for six years,” Draco directed a rather sharp glare at him which he returned with the similar intensity. “Now, when we are friends, why would you change it?”
Harry stared at the two seagulls standing still, ominously gazing at the ocean's surf and it was unsettling. The sea was turbulent. He walked at the edge of the shore, watching the waves crash. The sun was rising at a distance, and its soft light was falling on the water.
Harry smirked, and let go of his hand, and Draco pitched forward. The smirk was wiped off his face, when he realized that he could skate without his assistance.
“Okay, Stuart Little – wait, he was a mouse and you’re a fucking ferret – Stuart The Ferret is rather fitting and if I die, you should write ‘
He couldn’t deal with the next stab of pain. It was overwhelming. He didn’t want to fucking care whether Potter despised him or not. Yet, he did. Only a little. “Fuck off, Potter.”
Briefly, a dark, wispy cloud eclipsed the moon, and it was like a soft halo around the cloud, a dull aura of lunar luminescence. It was a cold, gusty night.
He was almost half a mile away from the sea. He never ended up at another location, and that was utterly infuriating. He knew that the only way he had was to alert the Order, and he wasn’t going to trust Draco Malfoy – Who would set him on fire while he was asleep, given the chance.
The entire situation was kind of odd. He was on the rooftop with Draco Malfoy, who was leaning on him and snoring and he couldn’t move until the blond would wake up.
Malfoy didn’t find the quip amusing. “I’ll ignore the pun, and I want to – erm – can you recite the fairy-tale if you’re planning any other references to the –
“We’re not –” The brunet paused, considering his next words. He wasn’t certain what they were. Wasn’t certain if he could forget the six years of animosity for once. Yet it had reduced, hadn’t it? “we’re
“It’s my code of conduct,” Draco said with a slight quiver to his voice. He unlaced the entwined fingers with a curse and said, “why can’t I write it?”
He walked to a corner of the room, towards the canvas easel. A blank canvas rested on it. On the side, was a wide collection of paints and paintbrushes.
“Can’t argue with you on that.” He wasn’t certain if he could argue at all, considering the faint ache in the side. He would appreciate a cold shower. And – he ran his hand over his jaw – a shave.
Harry frowned, mouth simpering, while carding his fingers through his unruly hair. Once, the prospect of working in the Ministry had been sort of appealing. Now, when he considered recent events, he was conflicted. Plus, he wasn’t concerned about a career when he wasn’t certain if he would win the war. If he would survive. Yet, he had an ambition once. “Oh, I wanted to be an Auror.”
It was a quip, and it caused the blond to scoff. “I don’t think I can cast a corporeal one. We were supposed to learn it in the fifth-year.”
He laughed. Again. Only Malfoy had that effect on him. And he didn’t know if he felt particularly thrilled about it.
When he neared the end of it, a head drifted to his shoulder and he paused. The soft blond hair brushed against his chin and tilted his head a bit and stared at Malfoy. He was kind of beautiful and kind of close to perfect.
A distant rummaging. The clink of teacups. Draco smiled – Potter was searching the note he hadn’t written.
“No you don’t –” He cleared his throat, carding his fingers through the unruly hair and in an uncertain, voice, he whispered, "wait, no, right now, you do,” It elicited a laugh out of Draco “it’s a rare privilege.”
A distraction would probably work. He didn’t want to think of the artifact. And it wasn’t a fucking watch, he was in denial and he didn’t want to voice the truth in his mind or out loud.
No ‘Good morning, sunshine – I love you.’? He couldn’t even recall if he’d done anything wrong. He didn’t suppose that Harry was being an arse on purpose.
A laugh. Not a chuckle, or a snigger – An actual laugh. And it was a pleasant sound. Draco smiled softly, and raised his eyebrows at him. It was almost unbelievable. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy having a bit of a banter. “Are you quite done, Potter?"
“Oh, shut up.” Malfoy mumbled, underlining it with a glare. It didn’t have the effect the blond had intended it to, and he cursed under his breath. “I can’t stand you.”
Harry levitated a few more shells for an hour, and it drained him slowly. Yet, he wasn’t going to give up. He wasn’t going to let Otryazan or modern-day ‘
A silence lingered in the air for a moment and for a second, he was certain that the blond wouldn’t reply, yet, he breathed a laden, quivering exhale, and whispered, “I’ve trusted you for a while now, Potter.”
“And I didn’t sign up for dealing with the Chosen One, who is insanely sarcastic and has a shit load of absurd names for me.”
He nicked the cloudlike towel and draped it around his hips, walking into the room, only to find Malfoy standing near the door. He scanned Harry, a little longer than required. Harry realized he was in the middle of the bedroom wearing only a towel, his wet hair dripping onto his bare torso. Awkward.
“M’fine, Potter.” He whispered, voice strained, turned his head to squint at the brunet, “now, for the second time, if we’re finished,” A familiar tense returned to his shoulder, “with our conversation, which, for the record –” The lights in the room started to flicker, in a rather incessant manner, “Oh, fuck."
“Oh?” He said with a sinister laugh, pausing for a moment and inching even closer until they were nose-to-nose, scrutinizing the silver eyes. “You didn’t fucking try enough.”
He couldn’t neglect the war or Voldemort would win and the wizarding world wouldn’t be a safe place any longer. The thoughts overcrowded his mind as a raw energy surged around him and a teacup shattered.
Harry glared at Draco, and he would’ve been slightly fazed if he wasn’t tired after the panic attack earlier.
He had to practice more if he wanted to perfect it. The summoning charm, however, was the one charm he hated - second to the flutters in his chest around Malfoy – It was fucking infuriating, to put it mildly. It hadn’t been easy with a wand, in fourth year. It was a nightmare without a wand.
“You’ve read the fairy-tales, and you weren’t allowed to talk about it because of the Pure-blood status or because you want the others to see you as a ‘cultured pure-blood’, is it?”
“I – Malfoy, I don’t trust you” Potter said, his gaze drifting back to the waves. The waves that softly crashed against the shore were insanely calming. They always had been. “Don’t you have to be infuriating somewhere else?”
He raised the trembling numb fingers to his temple. A chill raced down his spine, the cold settling within, and the thin cloak he was wearing wasn’t offering a layer of insulation. A soft exhale condensed into a misty plume.
“No, I’m not coming in there.” He said, planting his feet firmly to the ground as his voice grew louder. “I don’t –
“Yes, I did and don’t gape, Malfoy.” Potter said with a stifled yawn and mumbled a curse. The idiot wouldn’t fucking rest. “I can read if I want to. Or at least I can read if I’m in a modern-day Neverland with you.”
“I – when I was in your compartment for an introduction,” He said with a tone of impatience and had a strain to the voice, his eyebrows creating a small, sharp crease which Harry strangely wanted to smooth out. Draco exhaled, forming a cloud of fog in front of the face. “On the train –”
“Of course not. You can’t expect me to resist a reference, Malfoy. When I was six, I believed that wizards had flying carpets and if you have one – which won’t obey the laws of physics – I wouldn’t be astounded.”
create a conflict,” Draco said with a faint snort. The familiar comfort of antagonism was well-suited for a proper, light conversation. “We would’ve had a small fight-fest over it.”
It sparked one of the memories he had forgotten. A memory of when he was in front of the Mirror of Erised with Ron in the first year. He’d said similar words.
He had a chaos to deal with – The chaos of a war – A war he had to win. If he was in Otryazan, he couldn’t win the war. He had to find the rest of the horcruxes. He had to face Voldemort and defeat him.
For once, a simple levitation charm wasn’t wearing him out and he was a tad bit pleased with it. Malfoy was a decent tutor. “I could practice a few more simple charms.”
He gazed out of the window, and at the sunset. As the sun dipped lower, it illuminated a quivering path across the water. It bathed the ocean's meek waves and the wispy clouds in a soft shade of red.
“The chosen one who fainted when he saw the Dementors which was rather amusing to you and your house-mates and you created quite a spectacle out of it.”
Perhaps he didn’t care. Not entirely. Yet, the words caused a stab of pain in the chest and he couldn’t ignore it.
When he tried to move to get closer to the blond, he felt his skates slip out to the side. Harry yelped as they fell onto the ice. He landed on his bottom, his leg out to the side, tangled with Draco’s. “Not the worst way to spend Christmas.”
Draco tilted his head to the ceiling, perhaps to offer a distraction, and a small, soft smile formed on his face. "On purpose?"
“Right, of course,” Draco’s tone went light, clipped, superficial. A tone Harry was familiar with. It was laced with a trace of venom but it was forced. “Why would you, indeed.”
Draco scowled, yet it was replaced with a similar concerning frown when Potter’s teeth chattered and the lean body started to tremble. “We should continue with the Patronus.”
It was clear that the brunet despised flattering Draco, and he had been subtle about it. He wouldn’t say it out loud, but it was slightly easier to have conversations with Potter. It was light-hearted. Sort of amusing.
Harry nicked a warm cloak, and walked out of the house. He wanted to get away even jf only for a moment. Otryazan was surging with ancient magic. It was overwhelming. Overpowering. He didn’t want a place to hold that kind of power over him. He wouldn’t give in. And he wanted a distraction. A distraction from his thoughts and Malfoy.
He glanced at the blank canvas momentarily. Violet and black – A perfect mix. Indistinct speckles of white with a hint of silver. Chaos. Eternal chaos. And he gasped softly as realization dawned on him. It was the sky of his own fancy. Draco Malfoy had painted the sky of his fancy.
When he returned to the house, he didn’t find a note with the untouched tea. With a little effort, he cast a vanishing charm over the teacup and a quick cleaning charm.
He sipped his tea, as he stared at the canvas. Out of all the skies, he had painted the one of Potter’s fancy. Why? Why had his mind wandered to the night near the sea – A moment of vulnerability – When he had asked Potter if he had a sky of his own?
He wanted a distance and didn’t want to lean on the brunet anymore. The soft hum caused one of his repressed memories – one of his fondest – to resurface. He didn’t want to ruin it. So, he remained in place with his head resting on Potter’s shoulder and listened to the familiar hum.
“You’re a full tilt diva.” The corner of his lips quirked in pure amusement, as Draco directed a piercing glare at him. “We were stating facts, weren’t we?”
Harry closed his eyes, and inhaled sharply. He needed answers, and his patience was wearing out. Or he could get out of here. He wasn’t intent on staying here with Draco Malfoy. Yet, he was curious.
He smirked, folding it to the middle and placing it on the plate with a final touch of whipped cream and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. He slid the plate across the prep table over to Malfoy, and prepared his own.
In hindsight, he would’ve not asked had he known it was a private, family-related memory. It was a sore subject. Plus, when he paused to think about it, it was sort of intrusive. “Mhm, yeah.”
“Right, you can revel in your glory – It doesn’t fucking mean you can come up with sarcastic retorts to rile me up, Potter.” Malfoy had a rather inscrutable mien on his face.  “Plus, you’re rather daft.”
,” Draco said in a monotone with a soft snort, yet a brief flicker of concern crossed his face. “how is it, by the way?”
“I’ve got this, Potter. I can surely glide on ice without you.” Draco started as he stepped onto the ice. He managed to walk clumsily, maintaining a balance. He held onto the wall, lifting his feet up to walk like normal on the ice. Harry smiled, shaking his head.
“The protagonist is a moronic fuck and if he could teach the purported rival in a proper way, it would be quite fantastic.” Draco countered, underlining the words with a glare. “
Draco just laughed. "Of course, you want me, Potter. If you didn't then you wouldn't be here, and your hand wouldn’t be on my arse.”
Draco had a reluctant smile on his lips, and he returned to the novel. He had added the collection of Lord of The Rings and he had included Holding the man and Boy Culture with the painting supplies in a bag, casting an undetectable extension charm on it. He figured if he would be stranded on a severed Island, he could read or paint, existing in an unrealistic place he created in the mind.
“Malfoy,” He said with a tone of warning, a pained mien crossing his features for a brief minute at the mention of Ron Weasley, the fear rising within. “It’s Ron Weasley. Not Weasel. Clear?”
Harry drew his lips in a thin line, and frowned. The world assumed that he would be the light. The hero. Brave and courageous. In his own mind, was he the hero? Or had he shaped himself to be one? Who was he before? Not ‘The chosen one’ or ‘The boy who lived’ or ‘The savior’. He was Harry.
“No.” He said, staring into the grey eyes. He had never been fond of lying, because he was pathetic at it. Well, he couldn’t manipulate the truth either. “I have to leave. The war –
He paused abruptly. He felt something in his chest swell almost painfully at the thought of his father. The pain still ebbed and flowed, but the turning tides were less intense, less overwhelming. Yet, it didn’t cease to hurt.
“Right,” Draco was, of course, not intent to continue with the conversation. He would rather save the civility for a Kneazel instead of forcing it with Harry Potter who was an insolent, self-righteous prat. “if your two minutes of ruining my moment of peace are over –” Draco flicked two fingers at the door. “Out,
No one had learnt anything practical in the fifth-year. Plus, Malfoy wasn’t a part of the Dumbledore’s Army. In fact, none of the Slytherins were, considering a few of them were in the Inquisitorial Squad. “It isn’t tricky.”
Harry nicked the cloak, draping it over his shoulders. The cold air brushed against his face as he opened the door. With a final glance at a confused Malfoy, he closed it and fished out the pocket-watch.
He inhaled sharply as he neared the house, his fingers twisting the doorknob slowly. He slipped in, closing it behind him with a soft thud. Instinctively, his gaze landed on the countertop, and a piece of parchment placed on the side with familiar elegant cursive.
He sat at a considerable distance, and watched the night sky as a comfortable silence lingered in the air.
Harry felt a warmth in his face, and he was certain he couldn’t sound confident in return. Instead, he cleared his throat, and angled for a quip, “well, since you asked so nicely.”
“You – wait,” He was sort of confused, to put it mildly. If Draco wanted to be his friend, he couldn’t comprehend why had he been such an obtuse fuck for the six years. “you wanted –” A beat. “no, wait –”
Harry apparently had to work on the summoning charm, because the teacup didn’t even twitch. It was the most challenging aspect of practicing wandless magic. He couldn’t focus on the spell and the direction of magic at the same time.
“It’s a fairy-tale, Malfoy,” Harry chuckled, walking towards the oven with the tray and placed it inside. It would barely take ten to fifteen minutes for the cookies to bake.
Draco laughed harder. "You do realise that just means 'a good view'? I was just asking for a room with a nice view."
Draco looked to Harry, offering his hand a tight squeeze. He couldn’t believe how fast things had moved, but by Merlin, he was glad they had. He was looking forward to the future, and all the possibilities it held.
Draco surged forwards, until he was only inches away from Pansy, and touched her face just like Potter had done to him, palm against cheek, thumb brushing away an invisible smudge of soot.
Malfoy tilted his head, something Harry was starting to notice he did more and more. "To clear your head?" He looked back towards the shower. "That's why I'm here."
Draco sat up, enjoying the slight spin of the room as he downed the rest of his glass. “Top me up then, gorgeous. I’ll need my strength.” He drawled.
He’d suddenly lost all of his Gryffindor cockiness, and would look away immediately when caught staring, his heart racing. Exactly one week after their meeting in the locker room, Malfoy pulled him aside after class, into the same alcove that Harry had pinned him in a few weeks ago. He had him up against the wall, a hand on either side of his head.
“Should we feel bad for practically holding a jury about him?” Harry asked, frowning into his pint glass. The drink was making his thoughts foggy, and he suddenly felt strangely sad. Like all he wanted to do was hug Malfoy. Merlin, he probably gave fantastic hugs. His long arms would probably wrap so perfectly around him, and he’d smell so good; Harry was sure of it. Smell like rain in the morning, Merlin, Harry loved the smell of rain in the morning.
"Not as much as I should be." The darker man leaned in close and Draco got another whiff of his intoxicating scent. "I had too much fun."
“I’m a useless gay and he’s a useless straight.” Draco whined, throwing himself back against the sofa. Yes, he loved a bit of dramatic flare. But he wasn’t wrong, was he?
“Because you’re good at teaching people and making them believe in themselves?” The herbology teacher took a bite of his jam-laden toast.
"What are we talking? Sickness?  A secret injury?" Rita gasped. "Did you spend time in an institution?" She whispered.
"Tickle Daddy! Tickle Daddy!" the little boy screamed and Harry let him go, watching as he tumbled through the grass towards Draco.
Harry read, and re-read the letter at least five times, barely even tasting his coffee. Was it true? Did Malfoy really care for him? He couldn’t deny that the slytherin had been his thoughts since the end of their eighth year, but to think he had been in his? That was insane, unbelievable. And yet, here he sat, holding the letter.
Draco bit his tongue and ignored him, his ridiculous fear of banter with the Gryffindor driving him away. He gave Sylvia a scratch under the chin. “You must persevere with the potion. After a week or two, the nightmares should stop. You need to finish the full thirty nights taking the potion, and then the nightmares should be gone.”
Draco hadn't realised he'd been staring until then, and he hurriedly picked up his drink and followed Potter out of the coffee shop.
“Oh, my dear. More than you think.” Pansy picked up the bottle, topping up both their glasses. “Écoute attentivement (listen carefully), because I’m about to teach you so many things.” She leant back with a devious smile. “Draco dearest, you sound like a brat, so let us hope Mr Potter can handle you.”
He gulped, swallowing his tears as Fred held out his arm towards him, Harry’s wand grasped tight. Harry wrapped his fingers around the other end, still holding his gaze.
"I know I do. I'm trying to be better." Draco gently tugged at Harry’s hand, but it didn't move from where it was folded against his chest. "Try to be better with me, together."
I hold a rather large grudge, fuelled almost completely by my own damaged pride. Pride bruised by a lack of you in my life, and pride bruised whenever you are in my life. It is quite the conundrum, I tell you.
He gave Potter a slow look up and down, his cool facade both a protective strategy and a way to mess with the poor man. Who said he wasn’t allowed some fun? “A thank you?”
“Am not!” Both Harry and Draco denied her at once, voices overlapping. They looked at each other, and Harry released Malfoy’s shirt. The Slytherin stepped away, raising his chin as he smoothed his clothes.
“Oh, shove off.” The blond replied, spinning on his heel to walk away. But Harry wasn’t having it, grabbing him by the sleeve and pulling him close. He backed him against the wall, smirking up at him.
“I’m not sure.” Harry’s words pulled him from his thoughts, and Draco focused on his lips. “A lot of things, or nothing at all. I’m a strong believer of making the most of what you have.” He turned to face Draco fully, his head blocking the sunlight, his curls glowing like a halo. Fuck, he was gorgeous.
Harry huffed. “Well it certainly wasn’t to stay up all night grading mock exams.” He pulled a plate of pancakes towards him. “I had more than enough of my own bloody OWLs and NEWTs.” He grumbled. “Should’ve thought this through more.”
He didn’t move, deciding not to dignify Malfoy with him standing up. A moment later, Malfoy appeared in the doorway, his coat thrown over his arm.
Draco and Balveer both stared down at their linked arms, both as equally shocked. What on earth was Potter doing? The heat radiating from his was delicious and zapped any sense Draco had to pull away. In fact, he practically leaned into it.
"I felt what I had to say could help a lot of people."  He watched as she retrieved the quill with a quiet "ah-hah!"
“Lovely to meet you.” Potter nodded, half dragging Draco towards the dance floor. They left the poor man in shocked silence.
Draco winced, ducking his head as Teddy hid his face in his shirt at Andromeda’s shouting. "Je suis désolé (I’m sorry), Andy."
Harry nodded, looking around the pub. He knew not to argue with Hermione. She deserved an apology for all the horrible things Malfoy had said and done in school. But he knew Malfoy had changed. Or at least stopped being as much of a prick.
“Well, you certainly seem to be just as passionate about each other as before.” Pansy raised her eyebrows in a we-both-know-you’re-both-a-mess kind of way.
“Of course, come in. It’s in the kitchen.” She smiled at him and moved out the way, not calling him out on his obvious lie.
“Merlin, I could kiss you!” Harry lunged at him, pulling him in for a bone-crushing hug. The blond let out an uncharacteristic squeak, arms limp by his side in shock. The darker man let go, the smile still plastered on his face. “You’ve bloody done it! You’ve cured Alfie!” His heart beat rapidly, the whole front of his body tingling from the heat of the hug, and he blinked at Malfoy. His skin was flushed, his hair sticking up a little. “Oh. Sorry. I guess.. Er, I guess I got a little carried away.”
Draco scowled at her. “More often than you think.” Maybe he was being a little bit childish, but he couldn’t go around hoping Potter was gay. Even if he was, why in Merlin’s name would he be interested in him? No, hope was not an option. He would only end up being hurt.
The Slytherin smirks, hooking his finger’s into Harry’s belt loops and pulling him flush against him. “I thought it was obvious, given the amount of time I spend making you moan my name.”
This was far too serious for a first conversation over lunch. Draco tried to push down the anxiety in his stomach, fighting the urge to run away.
“I am not cute!” Harry pouts and Draco chuckles again. He walks forward, putting his hands on his boyfriend’s hips.
“Come here, Bear.” Draco held out his arms for Teddy, and Harry reluctantly passed him over. The toddler immediately started pulling at his earlobes as Draco let out a chuckle. He pulled back to look at his hair again and frowned. “Dammit. I thought it would work.”
“Of course, master.” Kreacher’s voice crept in from somewhere in front of him, but by the time he opened his eyes, the house elf was gone.
“I haven’t seen you since Christmas.” Luna blinked at her. “Why did you want to meet?” She tilted her head. “I know you find me very odd.”
"I shouldn't be enjoying myself as much as I am." Potter conceded with a coy smile and Draco blushed deeper. What had the world come to? Was this really happening?
Draco's jaw dropped as the other man threaded his arm through his, feeling the heat radiating from him. Where did this man get such bloody big balls? He hadn’t even asked to link arms, just dove right in and grabbed him.  Draco wondered, not for the first time in his life, what it was like to be an unmannered Gryffindor. A second passed as Potter offered him a cheeky smile before catapulting them through the air, Draco squeezing his eyes shut to the churning in his stomach as he was apparated to fuck knows where. When he opened them, Harry was pulling his arm from his, walking ahead with a wave.
Potter signaled to the waiter and ordered the same for himself. “You seemed in quite a rush.” He said nonchalantly.
“Merlin. Are we really bringing out the dad jokes?” Draco whines, shaking his head in mock pain. Harry reaches up, placing a hand on his cheek, and Draco opens his eyes to the touch.
“Guys. I love you so much, but please, for the love of Merlin. Shut up and let me speak.” Hermione made a zipping motion and Ron held his hands up in surrender. “Okay, so as I was saying. Malfoy owns this shop, and it’s really nice inside actually, but anyway. I asked about the potion and he said he developed it himself. He said-”
It was like siren call, the sound of Harry Potter begging him to fuck him. He pushed his cock in further and further until he finally bottomed out. He stilled for a second as he tried to catch his breath. Potter was so tight, and so warm, and fuck, he felt so good.
“You’re right; I don’t.” Harry took a deep breath. “Thanks for saying it anyway.” He shrugged, his emotions raw. He was trying his hardest not to cry again, and it felt like Draco was trying his hardest to make him.
"No problem, Harry. I was just enjoying the sunshine." Luna smiled, her face turned up to the spring sun. It was the warmest it had been in months, the sun beating down. Maybe he should've worn shorts, Harry thought, feeling the sweat starting to form on his forehead - or was that just from the anxiety? Merlin, he hated stuff like this - there were bound to be reporters. At least he was with Luna; she had a way of reassuring people even when she didn't say anything.
"He didn't kill anyone!" Harry burst out, barely keeping his voice below a shout. "He didn't kill anyone. He even saved my life." He couldn't help himself from saying it. For some reason, Harry found himself caring about what people thought about Malfoy.
“Look, I obviously misread the situation. I’ll just go.” Malfoy’s hand reached up to clasp over Harry’s as he tried to peel his finger’s away. The Gryffindor placed his other hand over the Slytherin’s.
Draco chuckled again. Who knew it would be so easy to talk to his ex-enemy? Sure, they hadn’t been at each other’s necks in a long time now, but still, banter? It was enough to make one’s head reel. “Let’s just say that there’s someone here tonight that I’d like to avoid.”
“I’ll only be a-” The gryffindor started, but Draco was already out the door. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think.
Pansy rested her hand on Draco’s knee, making him look up at her kind smile. “We’re still young, Draco. It’s easy to fall into the traps of immaturity.” She gave his knee a squeeze before sitting back. “At least you’re aware of what you’re doing, and ready to change.”
Draco ran his hand through Harry’s mop of curls, humming happily to himself. “Are you excited for tomorrow?” He felt his boyfriend’s head shake as he laughed.
"One, two, three!" The two slytherins downed their shots one by one, shivering at the burn in their throats.
Draco watched Potter flounder, his own amusement tainted with a nervous ball in his stomach. Lunch, with Harry Potter. Were pigs flying? Potter’s visit was certainly unexpected, and the fact that he was asking him out to lunch? Completely fucking unprecidented. Fourteen year old Draco would have creamed himself right then and there.
“Alright! Merlin, can’t a girl bully her best friend every once in a while..?” She muttered, sipping her wine again. “How many times have you seen him now?”
“Merlin, you did not just call him ‘Snako’.” Harry rubbed his hands over his face. He wished his coffee would hurry up.
He pushed open the door to the shop, the wind chime jingling softly above his head, the warmth of the shop a welcoming reprieve. Malfoy appeared from the back, gold rimmed glasses perched on his nose, apron on, a smudge of (what Harry assumed to be) soot on his cheek; it was almost endearing. Almost. The second he saw Harry, Draco’s face soured.
Harry pulled away first, breathing heavily. Draco looked exactly the same, panting a little, skin flushed, eyes bright. “Fucking hell.” Harry breathed.
"A top, Potter? I am, when the mood takes me." Draco ran his thumb over Potter's lips. "And it seems to have taken me now."
Pansy snorted. "You know full well that won't be happening after what happened last time. No, this is far more exciting." Draco rolled his eyes at Pansy; most things Magda said were "exciting".
"Next time, when you're ordering just the one drink, try paying with one of these." Draco looked down to where Potter was waving a note with a 5 on it. Draco sniffed and grabbed the money and wallet back from him.
"I just… thought that was a courtesy. For my mother." Draco's voice was incredibly small. Harry came to a stop.
Grabbing a flask and dropping a tea bag into it, he called out: “Kreacher, do we have any pastries? Donuts or something?” Barely two seconds had passed before a paper bag appeared next to his flask as he filled it with water. “Cheers.”
"No we don't. I'm more than happy to keep our relationship to a professional one." Malfoy looked pointedly ahead, refusing to look at the Gryffindor as he tried to walk away.
“I’m sorry I hurt you, baby. But even you can’t be so dim as to not see how tense it is between me and my mother.”
The pool of yellow to his left came into focus - Luna’s golden hair splayed around her head, her bright eyes wide open, vacant of their joy, blood streaking out of them. Harry’s hands flew to his mouth, his scream trapped in his throat. He stumbled backwards, something soft cracking under his foot. He looked down at the dark hand, following it to Parvati’s face, half hidden under rubble. A sob escaped him, and he tried to run, but his legs wouldn’t work. Instead he staggered, looking half-drunk, away from the two girls. He didn’t look where he was going, as long as it was away.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I may not be as smart as you, Malfoy. But I’m not stupid.” He slid the coins across the counter as the cat gave his hand a lick.
The blond had to stop himself from rolling his eyes at her dramatic words. “Indeed.” They had both bumped into Potter at work before, so it wasn’t as if he’d ever disappeared. The Gryffindor was simply more out of the spotlight these days. Draco flicked his eyes back to him. He had already been swarmed by nosy housewives and their adoring daughters. Poor bastard.
Harry snorted. “Yeah right. What does daddy think of all of this, huh? Cavorting with muggleborns and the children of the people he fought?”
The waitress points to something on the menu. "I'd recommend the Chapelle d'Ausone, it's a lovely French red with a merlot base."
Draco smiled devilishly. "Hmmm… I suppose so." The teasing didn't work however, as Potter beamed from ear to ear.
Harry tilted his head. “It’s fine, it was my fault anyway.” He looked down at Draco’s empty glass. “Let me get you a drink to say sorry.”
Harry nearly choked at the sight. He cleared his throat. “Don’t make this more difficult, Malfoy. It’s mortifying enough as it is.”
“Draco! Language!” Andy tutted, resting her free hand on her hip. Draco ignored her, standing Teddy on his thighs and looking at him in wonder. He giggled, pulling on Draco’s ears with his tiny fists.
“Please.” Harry called back. “Where’s my little man?” He called out, searching for the familiar giggling mound of raven hair. He heard Teddy before he saw him, and he turned to see the familiar face of Edward toddling towards him, but with a full head of white blond hair. “Oh my god!” He shrieked, diving forwards and scooping up the toddler. “What the hell is on your head?!”
“Come on, Tedster.” Harry took Teddy’s hand and took a step up the stairs, with a devilish grin. “Door under the stairs, I’m sure you can find your way around.” He winked.
Draco smirked, wrapping his arms around Potter's neck. It was his turn to lean into his ear. "Just wait until you see what else is impressive."
Draco unlocked the door to their room, opening it to reveal a quaint space with wicker furniture and orange accents. The plan was to stay for three blissful days with Harry and then he would go and spend the rest of his time at his mother's chateau. He walked in and turned round to see Harry slam the door shut, rushing up to him and pulling him into a rough kiss. Draco kissed him back and when they pulled apart to catch their breath, Harry pressed his forehead against his. "Shit, Malfoy. You're so hot when you speak French."
“I might just take you up on that, Potter. After all, I did have to shut the shop early for your Gryffindor pride.” The blond smirked back.
Pansy looked absolutely mortified. "I know you like to keep away from the papers Draco, but you must have heard of them." She tutted at him teasingly, but at his quirked eyebrow, added incredulously, "The singers? No? Well anyway, they're gorgeous and they're glamorous and they're opening up a club here in London." She took a sip of her wine. "Its supposed to be extremely lavish and at least a little bit outrageous. We have to go!"
“Malfoy-” Potter murmured, his eyes searching Draco’s face. The paler man sucked in a breath, pulling away, but Harry grabbed his wrists. “Draco, I -”
The blond contemplated this for a moment. “What do you wish for?” He lifted his hand to his eyes, shading them from the sun. He took in the man before him, eyes cast with a far away look, freckles dancing in the sunlight. He was beautiful. And here he was, sat beside him, in a quiet garden in the gently aching sunlight. He wouldn’t need any muggle money. His wish had already come true.
“Merlin’s tits!” Draco’s hand flew to his hair, running them through nervously as he began pacing. “Merlin’s fucking tits!”
"Draco, darling, you wouldn't believe what Magda just told me," Pansy practically purred with excitement as she slid in next to him, a large glass of wine in hand.
“Oh." Luna raised her eyebrows. "I turned the open sign to closed when we walked in so no one would come in. Your arguing might be bad for business.” She explained with a shrug, putting Sylvia down.
The most famous, most brilliant, most bravest man to ever exist. Who’s arse we must all kiss, and lick, and fondle, though that may be just me. It really is a nice arse you know. Have you ever looked in the mirror? A truly fine specimen. You wouldn’t think it spent so much time on a broomstick being a bloody show off, but here we are, you with a nice arse and me with a picture of it in my head. How delightful.
“Your hand did.” Potter murmured, trailing his fingers over Draco’s clenched fist. He let go in shock, looking at the other man with wide eyes. Harry wasn’t looking at him, pushing the door open without another moment’s hesitation. “Morning, Paeson.”
“Don’t be a prick.” Potter’s words were right on cue and Draco stopped. “I’m just trying to be nice.”
“Make it?” Draco spun around to face her, his mind racing. What had he said? He didn’t even remember half of it. He was pretty sure he mentioned Potter’s arse, and maybe his father? The memories were returning slower than he’d like. Had he signed it?! “What time is it?”
Harry felt almost elated with the exhilaration of arguing with Malfoy again. This must be what adrenaline junkees feel, he thought, chasing the high. If only his high wasn’t going blow to blow with Malfoy.
Harry tried to pull away, but Draco wouldn’t let go as he backed him up against the wall once again. He probably could’ve gotten out of it if he wanted to, but he didn’t - not really. Now he had had his epiphany, it was all Harry could do not to melt at the other boy’s touch. No wonder Malfoy had noticed; it was like a switch had flipped overnight. It all made sense now. How could he have been so stupid to miss it? What he felt for Malfoy was a lot less hatred and more… fuck knows what. Lust? Harry wasn’t sure. All he knew was that he wanted to be closer to him.
Harry chuckled, his hazy mind cocky with drink. He put his hand on Draco’s face. "Don’t worry, I've got this." He said, pulling him in close. Their lips touched and Draco let out a small gasp. He tasted of mint gum, beer, and the salty sweat of the night. Harry kissed him hard, his arm around his waist. After the initial shock had faded, Draco leant into the kiss, their lips moving together hungrily. They stayed like that for a long moment, bodies pressed together, lips colliding, until the group had walked past. Finally, Draco shoved himself away.
"You don't look too bad yourself Potter, for a tramp that is." He laughed at that, and oh boy, could Draco get used to that sound.
“It appears so.” Draco murmured, reaching down to stroke Lucy gently. “Bonjour, ma chérie.” He whispered.
“I know you’re not.” He thought about their school days. “You just need to be careful, you have a habit of being reckless.” Draco said quietly, unable to stop himself.
"Well, you've certainly come to the right place, Mr Potter. I'll get your story heard." She gave him a wan smile and he tried his best to return it. "So do tell me, what is it you have to say?"
Harry ignored him, walking forwards to grab Draco’s sleeve, dragging him out of the shop. They stopped a few feet away. “I did not name my snake after you.”
Harry pulled his hand away, suddenly embarrassed. “Thank you.” His cheek was still tingling pleasantly from the kiss.
“Which brings me back to my point.” Pansy paused, eyeing up the two intruders; maybe it was fate that they were here. “Granger, Weasley. I may require your input. Take a seat, won’t you?” She flicked her wand at the next table over and two chairs danced towards them.
After winter break, the slytherin gang returned anew, often found in fits of laughter in the eighth year common room - or pelting each other with snowballs in between every class. They would sit at their desks casting drying spells, their eyes bright. By the time spring rolled around, each one was as outgoing as they had been before, and had even formed some delicate friendships outside of the traditional house groupings.
Malfoy withdrew his hand, tucking it tightly into his trouser pocket. He rolled his eyes. “I should’ve known you’d be too immature, Potter. I doubt you even know what the word ‘truce’ means.” He snorted. “Shall I go and fetch Granger to define it for you?”
Draco looked away, more than a tad uncomfortable. He didn’t care about Potter, not anymore. The golden boy was a childish fantasy that he had put aside a long time ago. So why did he want to ask more?
Draco must have dozed off, worn out, because when he woke he was alone in his bed, and he could hear clattering in his kitchen. He pulled on a pair of boxers and walked out of his room to find Harry bent over, rummaging through his cupboards. He leant against the doorway with a smirk. "Well isn't this a nice view."
Draco watched as a boy, the same age as him, with unruly hair and round glasses walked into Madame Milkin's. He stood on a stool next to him.
They stared down at their joined hands, both unaware of each other’s racing hearts and stomachs full of butterflies. Malfoy pulled away first, his pale skin even pinker than before. He cleared his throat again. “Yes, I can imagine she’s not one for eager expressions.” He joked. He stepped away, eager to get some space between them before his heart exploded. “His magic is fixed? The other owls are okay?"
Draco didn't respond, stepping back and lifting his arm as Potter spun around. The other man let out a surprised chuckle and Draco found himself smiling. He brought them back together, pressing their bodies against each other once again. Potter smelt incredible, earthy and spicy, and Draco wondered if he could get drunk on his scent alone.
Harry apparated home, shaking with anger. Anger towards Malfoy for being such a god-awful prick, but also anger at himself for going back to him again. It was like he was intoxicated on the way the slytherin held himself, the way he smirked, his arrogant manner, and by Merlin, his bloody french... It sparked a fire in Harry that he couldn’t describe. “Fucking hell!” He cursed, kicking the bannister in the entrance hall and grabbing at his toes as they throbbed in pain. He yanked off his shoes as a light jingle alerted him to Lucy’s arrival.
How had it taken him so long to realise this? Teddy was nearly two! Harry remembered Lupin saying something about his hair when he was born, but everytime Harry saw him, Teddy had had black hair. Once or twice, he had caught a glimpse of lighter brown hair, but had blamed it on a trick of the light, because whenever he was there, his hair had been black. He supposed it should be a compliment. Even when Hermione or Ron had visited, Teddy’s hair had always been black. And since he lived with Andromeda, he probably didn’t find her brown hair very exciting.
Later that afternoon, after a wonderfully nightmare-free nap, Harry meandered down Diagon Alley. Wrapped up in a scarf, with his nose covered against harassment, not many people recognised him. He spied a new addition to the shops, nestled at the end of the row, fresh green paint around the windows, and a sign reading Grotte aux Remèdes in navy blue. The window display sported a large arrangement of plants and a wooden coffee table scattered with dried herbs and potion bottles. A small dragon sat in the centre of the table, seemingly looking down at it’s horde of medicines. Warm orange light leaked through the glass in the door, and when Harry pushed it open, wind charms jingled above his head.
“Love, come on. We’re going to be late.” Draco rolls up his shirt sleeves as he looks himself over in the mirror, humming quietly to the music on the muggle radio that Harry had bought him. Out of everything muggle that the Gryffindor had tried to get him into, this was the one thing that Draco is actually grateful for - though Merlin knows he would never admit it.
Draco sighed again, pushing away the covers. He stood up, glancing down at the pajamas that were doing nothing for his sanity. They smelt like Harry, like wood and spice and mint chocolate. He resolved himself to making a cup of tea, padding quietly down the hallway, and stopping just outside his friend’s door. Opening it slowly, he poked his head in.
Harry blinked away the water from his lashes, taking in Draco’s silver eyes tinted blue in the light, his pale skin glistening, his lips pulled up in an unsure bite. He looked exquisite, otherworldly, beautiful, dashing, gorgeous, so many words that he would need to learn and more, to even try and describe how incredible he looked, gazing up at him. His whole body felt the most alive it had in a while, his heart pounding, his skin tingling.
“Master, I have brought your tea, along with a second pot and cup in case Mr Malfoy hopes to enjoy some.” Kreacher said, bowing low to Malfoy as he walked in with the tray.
Harry sat on a bench in the park down the road from Grimmauld Place, Teddy in his pushchair in front of him. He opened the chocolate mousse, licking the excess from the lid. “Don’t tell grandma, Tedster. This little treat is just between us.” He scooped up a little onto the spoon, offering it to the toddler.
“Just forget about it mate.” Ron slapped him on the shoulder. “We’re gonna miss the carriages, come on.”
The broad shot them both an annoyed look and ambled back into the crowd. Harry dropped his arm as Draco leaned into his ear. "Thanks!" He shouted. Potter shot him a lopsided smile, taking his hand and leading them back out to the dance floor.
"I mean slightly, Potter, yes." Draco paused, taking a deep breath. "I'm more surprised that you like death eater cock, though."
"Except that wasn't what they wanted, they just wanted a threesome." Pansy's eyebrows drew together and she swallowed thickly. "But they didn't tell me that until after… after I'd slept with them." Her voice quivered and she looked away.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You could say my face looked like an eighty year old ballsack and it would still be hot in that accent of yours."
In the heat of the moment, neither had bothered to look at anyone else; too absorbed in each other. Prying eyes and low whispers followed them as they moved to the edge of the dance floor, and Harry worried at his lip.
Malfoy looked back down at him, seemingly only now taking in Harry’s sprawled form. He offered a hand and Harry took it without thinking. His hand was warm, and somehow familiar. He lifted him up, and Harry immediately looked away.
“Draco, est-ce que ça va (are you okay)?” His aunt’s shocked face morphed into worry, her brows pinched together.
He was so caught up in his thoughts that he almost missed the flash of hurt in the other man’s eyes.
The two had been friends for well over a year now, and it was comfortable as they lifted their joined hands above their heads, throwing their heads back and singing along to the music. The two danced the hours away, until the club closed and they found themselves stood on the street, drunken smiles on their faces as they stumbled down the road.
“If it wasn’t true,” Draco whispered softly with a bit of confusion in the voice, stuttering out a breath, fingers curling into the white sweater, “you wouldn’t’ve said it.”
Potter arched an eyebrow at him as he circled his fingers around the cup. “A burnt tongue won’t stop the sarcastic and clever retorts, if it’s what you’re aiming for.”
And it left a note (Or a symphony) of curiosity in the air. Harry always used those sappy endearments, and he secretly loved those. He didn’t understand the sudden change in his behavior. “Harry, love, are you sure that everything is alright?”
“I’m luring you into being a dark wizard.” Draco said, as the brunet gave him an innocent grin, and it made his heart flip a bit. “It’s a part of our secret Pure-blood subject.”
“You’re a pure-blood, and I’m certain you aren’t supposed to read a novel written by the ‘non-magic’ folks. Plus, in the drawer of the bedside table is the collection of Lord of the Rings – a gift – I figured it out.”
Draco’s mind traced to one of the recent memories – of when Narcissa and Draco had escaped the Manor for a few hours and had wandered into London – a few care-free hours. “
He lifted a brow at the blond in confusion. “A proper death-eater?” The malice laced in it was downright infuriating and he could’ve refuted, if not for the evident fury on Draco’s face and for once, he would rather not worsen it. “Or the Dark Lord himself, perhaps?” He rasped with a low growl. “Or would you –”
“Perhaps,” He whispered, in a low, uncertain voice. “but her sacrifice has sort of woven an intricate pattern of protection and it will remain in place – for a while – with the Patronus, it’s – it’s a simple pattern of Dad’s.”
Perhaps it wasn’t fractured, but the pain was lancing on one side. “It’s not –” The words were cut off when he turned to one side, perching up with a hand placed on the rough bark, rising to his feet. “Oh, fucking –” A sharp pain flared to his side, causing him to wince, “I can’t figure out if it’s fractured or not.”
“Oh, why not?” He said with a sharp laugh. “You said I was the one person you didn’t want to be with and now, you contradict yourself with the ‘
It was a subtle way to ask for a clarification, because he was insanely confused. Weren’t Pure-blood supremacists like Draco Malfoy supposed to ‘detest’ the ‘outrageous inventions’ of a muggle?
"Pansy, can I borrow your best friend for a while?" He said when he walked over to the table, eyes fixed on Draco, who was turning the glass of wine in his hand, a small smirk on the mouth. "if you don't mind, of course."
Harry didn’t even know if they were safe. He didn’t care about the fucking horcruxes. He cared about Ron and Hermione. He wanted them to be out of danger. He wanted them to be safe.
Another shrug. It was sort of awkward. He traced his mind back to the argument, and sighed softly as he raised his eyes to the night sky. “And for what it’s worth, I don’t despise you entirely, Malfoy.”
He figured he could offer to prepare a cup of tea, considering Potter didn’t leave him out on the rooftop. “I’ll prepare a cup of tea for you. Rest on the bed for a while.”
Fantastic. Perhaps, it was self-preservation and he was familiar with it, yet Malfoy was still an intolerable moronic fuck. “We’re back to the part where I remind you that I don’t – can’t – trust you.”
In his defense, he hadn’t barged into the manor willingly. He wouldn’t go in there, knowing that Voldemort was having cocktail parties with the death eaters in the manor. “No, Malfoy. I was taken to the manor. I’m not here willingly either – You can blame your precious father for that.”
“Oh, right,” Malfoy’s lower lip had protruded in a petulant pout, “oh, don’t pout, it’s not attractive on you.”
He started to hum in a soft voice – The familiar song – The one Narcissa would sing to him at night when he was eleven. It was distant. He was seventeen. He wouldn’t find that childish innocence again.
Draco snorted. He shouldn’t have said it last night, because Potter could be utterly infuriating if he decided to be, and he was excessively sarcastic – A trait he fucking loathed because Potter would always have clever sardonic retorts. “Yeah. Too fucking soon, Potter.”
“Of course.” He was surprised at how quickly he said it. And how certain he was about it. He felt a pressure in his mind, like it was filled with smoke, before the feeling retreated. “If I find a way out.”
“I’m stranded on a severed Island with my arch nemesis, baking chocolate chip cookies for supper. Of course I’ve lost my sanity, Malfoy.”
“I can recall the short conversation,” It was a rather one-sided conversation, considering Draco Malfoy had a proper upbringing and had a clear – if prejudiced – idea of the wizarding world. “what’s your point?”
“Yes,” He said, peering into the confused grey eyes. He chuckled, as he said in a soft voice, “If it’s a sad ending, why shouldn’t it mean it isn’t beautiful?”
He gave a slight shake to his head, and turned to the small pantry and mused through it to gather the ingredients. “Er – I was thinking of having pasta for dinner.”
“Quit trying?” Malfoy said, voice rising at the accusation, and he inched closer to the brunet, staring into his eyes with evident anger. “Oh, I’ve tried. Once. Twice. Countless times. And I failed – I. Fucking. Failed.”
“I wasn’t –” Potter cursed, fingers twitching on the side while he frowned at the artefact and the corners of his mouth downturned, “wasn’t in a stable emotional condition.”
“Quit counting points, Potter.” Draco mumbled with a rather dramatic eye roll. It was astounding that the brunet could send him in a frenzy – only he had the effect on Draco – and it was infuriating.
“Oh, we are. But,” Draco said in a strained voice, biting the insides of his cheek to distract himself from the next stab of pain in the chest. “We’re all born into our ways of life. We have to play in those ways.”
One song drifted to another familiar one. A song he was rather fond of. It was a song he would play on the road-trips with Draco. “Oh, it’s our favourite song.”
He had to fix it. Wanted to. He hadn’t intended to hurt Draco. Yet, he had. He had wronged Draco. A small, small part of him wasn’t sure. Was considering an alternate way. That part of him was quickly stamped down.
“I’m not – do you want a trip down memory lane where you were a school bully, or the times you’ve tried to ridicule or maim-slash-seriously-injure my best friends and I, Malfoy?”
“Yes,” The confusion was clear on Draco’s face, which was sort of comical. Writing a code of conduct for Draco Malfoy was an idea he could entertain. “Rule One: Never thank your overachieving favourite Gryffindor.”
Steve was levitated for a while, until it returned to existing as Steve the ordinary seashell. If Steve was sending curses at him, he wouldn’t know.
He was sort of pleased with the familiar comfort of a retort-fest and considering the six years of animosity, the silent confessions and uncensored conversations with Draco Malfoy weren’t well-suited. “You exhaust me.”
He snatched the artifact in a swift movement with a curse. “I warned you –” He paused when a low growl escaped Malfoy’s mouth, the flicker of malice crossing the features. “Draco, you weren’t –”
The smile turned into a scowl while he whispered a variation of profanities. The curses, french ones included, were now familiar to him. “It wasn’t a smile.”
“Yes, continue to flounder,” Draco said in a sardonic, apathetic tone, yet the brunet could detect a trace of uncertainty in it. “It’s very
And he had seen the light fade. Because if stars were the ones around him, he had watched the slightly bright stars fade out of existence. And he didn’t want to have a bright star if it would eventually fade and darken the sky.
Or without the soft, silver light of the moon. It wasn’t offering a distraction. The small glimpses of Draco Malfoy were swirling in Harry's mind. Glimpses of the one part of Draco. The one which was a careful secret.
“Never,” Draco said, and he detected a slight shake to his head. Harry laughed, and pressed closer to him to steal his warmth. Draco pulled off one of his jackets, draping it over his shoulder. “I asked you to get another jacket.”
The brunet didn’t answer, but stared ahead at the sea. Draco thought that he was just going to ignore him, but then: “No, I don’t.”
“No, Draco –” A pause. “I figured out where I might’ve screwed up –” He inched closer to the blond. “I can’t stay on an Island forever,” It wasn’t the perfect place to start. “If I had a choice, I wouldn’t leave you in Otryazan.” It elicited a scoff out of Draco. “I wouldn’t want you to be alone.”
“Yes, I still fucking despise you.” He said, as he jerked his arm out of the grip and Draco reeled a couple of steps back. Potter turned, with his lips curled and he stared at Draco. “I’d rather die than be with you on a fairy-tale Island.”
The vain attempts at finding the note continued for a few minutes. Malfoy didn’t even bother glancing at food on the counter. When he didn’t find one, he walked back into the bedroom with an irritated growl, closing the door behind him with a loud thud.
“Oh, we would’ve had an interview,” He cut him off with a soft snort.  The prophet would’ve glorified the article if it involved Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. “from rivals to friends: A closer, exclusive insight.”
“Why wouldn’t I?” He repeated with the similar soft, patient voice. It was sincere. Draco felt the pent-up rage within starting to subside. “you’re a –” Potter cleared his throat. “you’re tolerable now, aren’t you?”
“Hush, you.” Potter said, as his lips curled into a sly smirk as he half-turned to face Draco “Don't sound too upset, I might think you don’t like me– Too soon?”
He was overwhelmed by the guilt, and his stomach clenched uncomfortably as he traced it further to Malfoy’s almost limp body, covered in blood and the cuts – No. It was too painful.
"Wasn't your proudest moment when you danced in the Yule Ball or when your date ditched you, was it?"
“You could write articles about yourself,” A beat. “of how you’re a moronic fuck with a saviour complex.”
The retort was on the tip of the brunet’s tongue, but before it could slip, he paused and focused on Malfoy’s eyes. One of it was the lightest shade of blue and almost in a trance, he whispered, “You – Your eyes.”
Malfoy's voice was suddenly reverberating through Harry's stunned mind, the statement ricocheting around his skull in clamoring echoes until he was feeling nearly dizzy from the force of it. “Don’t assume that I have no regrets. You don’t fucking know, Potter.”
The brief touch of fingertips – the one fraction of a moment – had caused a tiny flutter in his chest, and a warmth had coursed through him, as if it was the touch of a warm, soft star.
Baking cookies while listening to a fairytale is one of my favorite memories w my bsf. Had to include that.
“It’s not,” Malfoy said calmly. “I want to know if my father said anything to you, and the events at the Malfoy manor.”
Harry tried to catch hold of something, but he was already falling. And then he wasn't. Draco's arms were back around him, holding him in a dip off the ground.
“Yes,” He said, and drew his lips into a thin line as Draco arched an eyebrow at him. “Scar, I suppose.”
“Oh, shut up.” Malfoy said, with a soft groan. It was insanely amusing to revel over the tiny victories. Not against the house, but against Draco Malfoy. “I would’ve won the match in our second year if the Bludger –
“Never,” Harry said, with a soft chuckle as he placed his crepe neatly on the plate, folding it and topping it off with whipped cream. “I can never get used to The Draco Malfoy complimenting my crepes.”
In the evening, he received yet another note. An eagle-owl had a piece of parchment in its beak. He stroked the owl softly, as he unfolded the note. “I
He stepped around Malfoy, and uncertainly reached out. Adjusting the shoulder – a hand on the back – so that his arm was at the right angle. “Try now.”
on fire and reattain the peace and quiet you had when I wasn’t around, and I didn’t want you to come up with any new ideas – and with a minute of consideration – oh, we’re not on first-name basis.”
Harry opened a cabinet, and set out the cups. He didn’t have a specific preference with tea – But Draco Malfoy did. His mind traced back to the events of last morning. It was still fresh in his mind. He would’ve fought back. Yet, he knew that Malfoy had to vent it out.
“It was a smile.” He said in soft amusement, a corner of his mouth upturned. “I’m certain, you –” The lights of the room flickered for a second, “found it humorous.” He cast a careful glance around the kitchen, “or it was sort of humorous,” another flicker, “I’m rather pleased with myself.”
Harry couldn’t maintain a serious voice, and his lips were slightly upturned as he said, “Was it amusing to watch the entire
“Not patient, are you?” Draco turned the right ankle – uncurled the curve of the back – adjusted the position of the shoulders and pointed the wand in front of him. “and quit with the quips, Potter.”
They danced through the entire night, both feeling oddly comfortable in the other's arms. They swirled and swayed, rather like the snowflakes that continued to spin down from the inky black sky, scattered with pinpricks of light. Harry smiled as he looked up at the stars, noticing how the moonlight settled down upon Draco's hair, making a halo of moonbeams dance around his head.
He smiles inwardly and with an air of indifference, abruptly changes the topic, "Want to watch a movie? There's one I've been dying to watch and I think you'll like it too."
Harry let it slide. He scrambled to his feet, his knees trembling slightly. God, he should’ve saved the wandless Patronus for later. “Upset, Malfoy?”
He frowned in confusion. The blond couldn’t notice it, though, because he was watching the soft crashing of the waves on the shore. “wait, why?”
He cursed under his breath and cleared his throat as he tilted his head to the sky as he said, “Er – I wasn’t – I was thinking about - Never mind.”
“Draco, why did Voldemort exile you to Otryazan?” He could vaguely recall it, considering it had turned into an argument and he had dislocated Malfoy’s jaw and cursed. A lot.
Draco’s gaze flickered towards the couch, where Potter was curled up comfortably with his eyes closed. A soft sigh escaped his slightly parted lips, and he relaxed further into the red blanket.
“No – you certainly are – if you’re finished with the sardonic remarks and the quips, I have to travel underwater and befriend Ariel and the fishes.” He said with an amused snort. “Or perhaps, I can befriend –
“I can’t find myself among the stars mother,” Draco said, staring at the painting on the wall with a pained grimace. And he wished that she was here. Wished that she would ruffle his hair again and smile. “I am the dark sky without the stars.”
“Oh, the Bludger that was focused on killing me on the pitch?” He arched an eyebrow at the blond, while his lips curved into a teasing smirk, yet it faltered as a strand of hair fell over Malfoy’s eye. “Yeah, of course you would’ve won if it had succeeded, Malfoy.”
“I will, if you will.” He said softly, as he stirred his cauldron anti-clockwise. “It’s not 1996 – You were competitive in the sixth year. Your performance is preposterous in the eighth year, Potter.”
He raised the trembling fingers to his forehead to wipe a streak of sweat and heard a few whispers in the classroom, yet they sounded rather distant. He forced it out of his mind and stared at the cauldron as he exhaled slowly.
“I trusted my instincts of the dark mark branded on your arm,” He retorted. “I wasn’t wrong, was I?”
"You have a terrible way of showing it." Harry chuckled, tripping slightly. Draco kept him from falling, but Harry still pitched forwards, his head resting against Draco's chest. He tried to move away, but Draco wouldn't let him, placing a hand on the small of Harry's back and keeping him against his chest. Harry could just make out a heartbeat from beneath the layers of Draco's soft dress robes.
“No, I fucking tried enough – I was in Otryazan for six months – away from home and I miss it. I miss it more than anything in the fucking world – so, quit with the accusations.”
“Er,” Harry said, clearing his throat awkwardly. “Is eggs and bacon alright? Or I could make crepes.”
“Would you like me to continue or are we finished? Oh wait, you fucking asked for a reason, I’ll give you another one – You cursed Katie Bell. It doesn’t suffice? Ron almost died because you spiked the mead.”
?” It was a softer tone, “if I fail to convince you, you can return to your room and continue read Lord of the Rings –
Harry paused all movement, and set his fork down. He didn’t want to talk about Sirius. It was insanely painful. Yet, it was the only way to empathize with the pain Malfoy was in. He inhaled sharply and gave Malfoy a soft nod, “Sirius Black.”
Harry turned to Draco with a faint smile while he continued to ignore the flutter in his chest when the blond returned the smile and said, "You lost a bet, didn't you?"
Malfoy laughed and unclenched the fists at the side. The tension lingered, yet a part of it had vanished. “Don’t mistaken the fact that I didn’t light you on fire for trust.”
The blond tensed and frowned at the sand, and in a soft voice, he whispered, “Of the nights when mother would read fairy-tales at night – when I was –” He paused “eleven.”
“Oh, of course.” He said, with a ghost of smile over his lips and the amusement twinkling in his eyes. “Posture coaching. Perfect attire coaching –
“You wanted to be an Auror five minutes ago,” Draco squinted at the brunet and crossed his arms over his chest, lifting a brow in skepticism, “why the sudden change of heart, Potter?”
The brunet’s lip twitched and curled into a small smile. Oh. He placed the cup on the table, continuing to read the novel and said, “Couldn’t resist a reference, could you Malfoy?”
“I’ve been there, Malfoy.” He said, with a dismissive shrug. “You wanted to vent it out. The guilt. The loss of your father – It’s your way of dealing with grief.”
“A rant?” Draco repeated flatly and underlined the words with a glare while he forced out a low, humourless laugh. “Clearly, you’ve lost your last brain cell, Potter, which, by the way –”
He could get used to the banter. Or the forced civil conversations. He could get used to preparing breakfast with Draco Malfoy. It was absurd, but he didn’t have a choice. He was starving, and he didn’t want to stress over the fact that he was in the fucking kitchen with Malfoy – Draco Malfoy – making crepes for breakfast. “Get a mixing bowl, a pan and a whisk, will you?”
contradicting you over the fact that I’m a moronic fuck when you’ve convinced yourself that I will –,” It elicited a scoff. “continue to remain an unbearable moronic fuck to you, Malfoy.”
“I was offended when you refused my offer at a friendship,” He said sort of loftily, pulling at a thread on the duvet, but he cast a glance up and stared squarely into Harry’s eyes. “and chose
Harry arched an eyebrow at him. If Malfoy was aiming for the element of surprise, it wasn’t working. Granted, he hadn’t been anticipating Malfoy to be out by supper, it was certainly another small victory. “Out of the room you imprisoned yourself in, Rapunzel?”
“Quit with the titles, for the love of God,” Harry said with a soft sigh while he carded his fingers through the unruly hair, “now, could you, perhaps, shut up for two seconds – no interruptions – and for
Blood was tricking from his nose, and his jaw was bruised with a few cuts and possibly dislocated. The corner of his eye was red, and the glasses were broken. “I don’t want to.”
“It won’t –” He paused with a soft sigh. The artifact was a potential risk if he couldn’t obliterate it. Yet, it was confidential information. Malfoy couldn’t find out. “right, it might.”
The sky was a shade of violet and black, corpses of infinite stars lighting it, twinkling in the inky canopy. The moon was bestowing a dim light upon the water and it cast a silver luminescence on the sand.
He didn’t suppose that Potter would leave a note with lunch. He would find the crumbled piece of parchment, and read it. He wouldn’t leave another one.
on fire.” Malfoy turned an interesting shade of crimson. It was rather amusing to watch, and he couldn’t resist another quip. “I was flattered, you know?”
With a groan, the blond paced over to the fireplace across the room and leaned on the mantelpiece. A low growl escaped Draco’s mouth and he said, “It’s a dark artifact, isn’t it?”
“No,” Draco placed the cloak near the door and sauntered to the counter with a measured pace, legs quivering while he dropped down on the chair. “it bothers you, doesn’t it?”
Unfortunately, they couldn’t be avoided. Especially now that he had fought so hard to regain the dignity of the Malfoy name. He had to save face after all. A charity event here, a Ministry function there, donations left and right to orphans and Hogwart’s and Azkaban. All to make nice and show how reformed he was. It was all a show. He didn’t give a rat’s ass about any of it, but he had to appear as if he did for the sake of his son. Scorpius didn’t deserve to inherit Lucius Malfoy’s mistakes and Draco would do everything he could to see that he didn’t.
Draco grabbed his wrists and held them over his head while using his hips to pin down Harry’s. “Stop fighting, you little monster,” Draco growled. Harry tried in vain to free himself, quickly realizing that Draco was physically strong enough to keep him in place. “Why do you have to be so difficult? We could be having breakfast. I haven’t even had my coffee yet.”
“I fail to see why that’s an issue worth hiding from,” Draco said, rolling onto his back and crossing his ankles. “It’s the second time the two of you split, if I’m not mistaken. Why is this time so terribly depressing?”
“Calm down, Weasel,” Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s new and today isn’t about us.” He stepped over to give Hermione a hug, “Congratulations. I know how hard you’ve worked for this.”
Draco couldn’t help but to be intrigued. What could possibly have Potter needing his help. “What exactly have you figured out?”
“I’m not sure what the two of you are up to and I don’t particularly care, mind you,” Blaise said when Draco had left, “But he’s one of my only friends and you’d best not hurt him.”
“This is what’s wrong with you Gryffindors,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. “You don’t think about the long term or the big picture.” He stood and started pacing the small room, gesturing as he spoke, “If we only go to the ball together, people will know it was a gimmick. After all, we’ve been fighting for years. They’ll suspect something. However, if we start to spend time together, people will think we’re actually dating. Enemies to lovers and all that. People will believe it because they want to.”
They dressed in relative silence, Harry thinking about what had just happened. How had he gone from wanting to run from any alpha to being perfectly content that Malfoy had claimed him? As they started to make their way out, Harry asked Malfoy just that.
Draco smiled slowly, feeling powerful as he watched Potter’s reaction to him. He loosened his belt and pulled it free slowly. He had a brief moment where he just stared at Potter while trying to decide what to remove next. He decided to go ahead with his socks. There was absolutely no way to look sexy removing socks so he pulled them off quickly, thankful that he didn’t fall while doing so.
He got his trunk from the corner and grabbed the few clothes he had that weren’t already in it. Pulling his wand, he quickly shrunk it and stuffed it in his pocket. He looked around the flat, making sure he didn’t forget anything before he left.
“I know, but I like having you this close,” Draco said softly. He hadn’t seen or scented anyone else, for a bit and it was making him nervous. He was on edge until they exited the hunting grounds, only relaxing when Hermione ran up to them. He finally set Harry down, but kept his arm around him, holding him close.
At Pansy’s surprised look, he shrugged, “I’m not going to hurt a beta on purpose. I’m not a monster.”
“Good news, Malfoy,” Ron grinned. “Harry lost a bet when you agreed to play so now he owes us both one favor.”
Draco chuckled, pressing his forehead to Harry’s, “That was about the same as a cold bucket of water.” He kissed Harry briefly before pulling away. “Do you feel like being social or do you want to lock him out?”
“I can do that,” Draco shrugged. When Potter gave him an odd look, he explained, “I’m sleeping on the sofa in a flat that Pansy and Greg share. They never complain about me being there, but I don’t want to be a burden and I can’t afford to help them with bills at the moment.”
“You can call me Harry too,” he grinned. “That is my name after all.” He shrugged, the smile never leaving his face. “She wrote to me after the trials thanking me for speaking on your behalf and invited me for tea. We had a really nice chat and she invited me back. Now I go every Sunday.”
“I have one condition,” Draco said as he traced his thumb along Harry’s jaw. “You have to let me return the favor.”
His entire career at Hogwart’s, Draco had thought Muggle studies was a waste of time. At first, thanks to his father, he thought he was above it. He thought wizards were better than Muggles. After returning to Hogwart’s, he had thought it was a waste because he felt that his time was better spent on things that would actually help him get a job. After experiencing his first class with the new professor, he had changed his mind.
As he continued to stare at today’s pizza, he wondered how much longer he had until he was in fact desperate enough to sell himself. His friends didn’t complain about him losing so many jobs, but he worried that they might run out of generosity for him eventually. He did his best to keep the small flat clean, but he wasn’t certain it would be enough.
As they started to eat breakfast, Narcissa began excitedly, “So, I have had a busy morning while the two of you were sleeping in.” She ignored the blushing and kept going. “As it is Christmas Eve, I think you two should take a break from your practice to enjoy the holiday. I have sent invitations to your friends to come over this evening for a small dinner party and they’ve all accepted.” She was smiling broadly and seemed quite pleased with herself. “Honestly, Harry, I wasn’t certain your Weasley friends would accept, but I’m quite happy that they did.” She continued to fill them in on the plans for the evening as they ate and then enlisted them to help finish decorating the dining room and drawing room.
Harry writhed beneath him as he moved lower, hooking his thumbs in the waist of Harry’s pajamas. “Yes?” he asked, starting to slide them lower.
“The swords,” Draco answered as he faced Harry. “My only concern about us is that I’ll be an ass and mess it up.”
“You’re completely determined to keep me from reading, aren’t you?” Malfoy sighed as he stood and crossed the room. He stopped just in front of Harry, “Would you like to step aside or are you going to continue doing this odd impersonation of a door?” Harry glared up at him, but stepped to the side letting him pass. He went to one of the wardrobes and shuffled through his hangers. Turning he handed Harry a grey jumper and a pair of shorts. “You can borrow this for tonight.” He left the room giving Harry privacy to change.
“I don’t think so,” Harry said, meaning it. “I don’t think she really has girl friends either. I’ve only ever really seen her spend time with Draco and his friends.” He stopped talking as Draco entered the room, blushing a bit as he was pulled into a hug.
Potter’s hands were shaking as he gripped the waistband of Draco’s trousers, but he undid the button and zipper easily enough. As he shoved them over Draco’s hips and ass, he took Draco’s underpants with them releasing his now rigid cock. He lowered himself to his knees as he pulled the clothing to the floor. “Is this alright?” he asked as he leaned forward to lick the head of Draco’s prick.
“Keep telling yourself that, Potter,” Malfoy said as he entered the room. Harry could hear him moving around for a moment before the lights went out and he crawled into the bed, as well.
Draco was surprised at how neat and tidy the kitchen was compared to what he had seen of the house. He had expected cobwebs and dust, but had been welcomed into a warm, clean space that was surprisingly cozy given it’s size.
Potter nodded his head as if he understood. “I’ve never liked feeling like that,” he agreed.  He was quiet for a moment and then added, “I’ll be here for a bit while Teddy plays. Do you want to go get your stuff and I’ll wait for you?”
“Sounds like Hagrid’s rock cakes,” Potter shook his head laughing. “He means well, but they’re quite bad and the name says it all.”
“Understandable,” Draco agreed. He took the bottle from Potter and put it away. Turning he pulled his desk chair out and gestured for Potter to have a seat. “I’d tell you to relax, but it doesn’t look like you’ll ever be relaxed again.”
“Yea, I will,” she nodded and looked at her watch. “Oh, shit! I have to run or I’ll be late. I love you, take care, come see me,” she called over her shoulder as she ran out the door.
“Stop being so jealous, you ass,” Harry muttered, rolling his eyes. “What do you mean it’s about time?” he asked Seamus.
“I used to when I was younger,” Draco shrugged. “Mother said that it was a better use of my time than climbing the trees in the garden.”
When Harry’s marriage started to fall apart, Draco stepped in to help his friend in much the same way. Taking the children so that they wouldn’t hear the arguing. Making sure that Harry ate because he forgot to sometimes. And when things fell completely apart, he opened the doors of his home to Harry and his children. The renovations weren’t complete in Grimmauld Place and it was no place for children. Draco had insisted they stay with him.
“I imagine that if she had known that we could cast spells with the swords, she wouldn’t have taught us how to use them,” Draco agreed. They lay together in silence for several moments before Draco asked, “Do we have an end goal in mind for this? I do enjoy it, but is there a reason we’re doing it?”
Harry wasn’t looking forward to leaving the common room. The Yule Ball was only a few weeks away and he’d already turned down four invitations. He had made himself very clear in the great hall that he didn’t intend to go with anyone, but that hadn’t stopped the starry eyed girls that had already asked and he doubted that it would stop anyone else that had it in their head.
Again Draco woke up hot with hair tickling his nose. Instead of trying to get up, he gently combed his fingers through Harry’s hair and thought about the talk he had the previous day with his mother. Did he like Harry as more than a friend? It had never really been a thing that had crossed his mind. He’d never particularly liked anyone as more than a friend, not even Pansy and their relationship had gotten physical a few times. But he didn’t like being around anyone for too long. Usually he needed time to himself to feel normal, but Harry was different. He looked forward to the time they spent together. He was already dreading the return to Hogwart’s because he liked waking up with Harry.
“If Harry’s up to it, we might go later,” Draco shrugged. “I need to get him something for Christmas and it’ll be good to be seen out together.”
“It doesn’t have to end yet,” Draco said softly as he leaned in to kiss Harry’s neck. “If you don’t want it to,” he whispered, his lips ghosting across Harry's skin.
Potter seemed confused as he stared at Draco’s large four poster bed. “Why is it so big?” he muttered.
“You’ll feel better if you socialize,” she had pleaded. “And tomorrow’s Saturday so you can read alone in your room all day if you want.”
“I would like to be your friend,” Hermione said slowly, “But I don’t see why Ron would be off limits. He and I aren’t together so if you want to flirt with him, it’s fine.”
Malfoy gave him an odd look and laughed softly, “You must be kidding.” Seeing the look on Harry’s face, he laughed louder. “Are you serious? I think you’d best go to the hospital wing, Potter. Clearly, you’ve gone round the bend.”
“I know,” Draco laughed. “Now get dressed. We’ve been in here so long that I’m sure people think we’re fucking.”
“It’s just,” Harry started. “Well, with the nightmares… Sometimes, it’s easier to have a familiar face nearby when I wake up.”
“He was avoiding the Minister earlier,” Draco laughed, then paused as he realised what Weasley had said. “My boyfriend? He’s not my boyfriend.” But Weasley had already moved out of ear shot. ‘Does he really think he’s my boyfriend or is he just having one over on me?’ Draco thought as he watched Weasley move through the crowd.
When they entered holding hands, she grinned up at them, “Do you want to open presents before we have breakfast?”
The two other bedrooms on this floor were much the same as the ones below. Four poster beds with tattered hangings, lofty ceilings, sturdy detailed furniture that was covered in dust. Draco was surprised to see a bathroom on this floor, as well.
“I would have gone,” Pansy had said when he told her about it. “No work,” she scowled at her work apron as she said this. “Just be Blaise’s girlfriend and live a carefree life. Sounds good to me.”
Harry couldn’t stop grinning, especially as the light caught the ring on his finger. He’d have to tell Ron that he had been right. They hadn’t picked the wedding colors yet, but there was plenty of time for little details. In the end, it didn’t matter as long as they had each other.
“I had heard stories, but you never know what’s true and what isn’t,” Narcissa said. “Alright, darling,” she kissed his cheek. “You get some sleep. I’ll see you in the morning.”
Draco stared into the fire, watching the logs pop and crackle. All he wanted was some small semblance of peace, but Potter’s friends insisted on ruining it with their idle chatter. They all had a tentative truce since returning to Hogwart’s and he was doing his best to keep his mouth shut because he didn’t want to break first. However, it was becoming increasingly difficult to ignore them. He finally gave up, deciding that eavesdropping would be better than being irritated.
“Not that I could find,” Narcissa said. “You might want to check the school library or talk to your professor about it. If she doesn’t know, she may know where to look.”
“It’s interesting, if a bit boring,” Harry shrugged. “I appreciate the thought, but I don’t know if I still want to be an auror.” He set the book down as Draco leaned against the pillows, his cheeks turning a bit pink as he watched him. “I want to do something, so tell me if it’s not alright,” he said, his voice soft and a little unsure.
“It’s ok to enjoy a kiss, Harry,” she gave him a soft smile. “Honestly, I think he likes you more than he wants you to know. Maybe don’t think too much about it and just enjoy it.”
“I would think that you’d want me closer considering that I’m the one that can make you feel better,” he shrugged as he continued to get closer.
When the final guests were either in bed or gone, Harry felt exhausted and was ready for bed himself. “What are you doing?” he asked when he saw Draco stretching out on the sofa.
Luckily, they found a table in the back with enough seating for them all. Pansy insisted on sitting between Ron and Hermione so that she could chat with her new friend. “There’s a new shop at the end of the road that has makeup and hair potions. I wanted to buy some for you, but Ron said that it would be better to wait since I didn’t know what color your dress was.”
As far as the old clothing, I’ll send you the addresses for several donation services. I know of several that are always grateful for anything in good condition, even if it is out of style.
Stepping into the bedroom, he looked around for several moments. Finally, he stepped into the living area, “Did the elves maybe leave my trunk in here?”
Draco smiled and leaned forward, his tongue running a hot stripe up Harry’s prick. He licked across the slit, lapping up the dribble of precum that had formed. “I told you that you looked good enough to eat,” he said softly as he wrapped his lips around Harry’s shaft and sucked, sliding down until Harry hit the back of his throat.
“Fair point,” Draco nodded and held the door open to a small secondhand shop that Harry hadn’t noticed. “They have some interesting antiques,” Draco mentioned at Harry’s questioning look.
“Oy, mate,” Ron said, looking very seriously at Harry. “You’ve messed up. Now you have Hermione and Malfoy making you study.” He cracked up laughing and flinched sideways, watching Hermione’s elbow.
“We have to give them a little or they’ll hang us out to dry,” Draco shrugged. “Think of all the bad press you’ve gotten. If you had taken the time to give them just a little bit of the truth, they wouldn’t have been able to lie so much about you. Always give them just a bit. Just enough to keep them back.”
“Please tell me that I’m not still asleep,” Harry said when he saw Draco watching him. “This just seems too good to be true.”
Draco and Harry spent the remainder of the day practicing different defensive spells while taking turns attacking each other. Draco wasn’t surprised when Harry was able to cast Expelliarmus with his sword, effectively disarming Draco. “I’m beginning to think that’s the only spell you know,” Draco teased. He yelped and ran to grab his sword when Harry smacked him across the butt with his sword. They only stopped when his mother made them take breaks to eat and hydrate, both falling asleep quickly after showering.
“If she suspects anything, she won’t mention it,” Draco said. “She’s been avoiding set ups just as long as we have.”
“It’s a hickey,” Harry hissed. Her eyes widened. “I don’t want to talk about it right now, Mione,” Harry groaned and started to fix his plate.
“I’m happy you’re here,” Harry grinned up at him before turning back to check that his food didn’t burn.
They went to their rooms to change, agreeing to meet in the common room before dinner. Harry was surprised to find that Draco wasn’t alone when he was finished changing. Neville, of all people, had Draco cornered and had his finger in his face.
On a particularly windy evening, Potter approached Draco in the common room, “Can I have a moment?” he asked quietly.
“Yes, it hasn’t been used since my mother had it remodeled. She’s changed nearly every room in the manor,” Draco said hesitantly. “She wanted to remove every trace of what it was when they were here.”
“I’m sorry for that.” Malfoy rolled back onto his side and opened his arms for Harry again. When Harry curled up against him, he had to smooth his unruly hair down to keep it out of his nose, but he didn’t complain. He wrapped his arms around him and held him as he drifted off to sleep. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“Do you really want people trying to help you heal your broken heart if we break up?” Malfoy stopped in front of him and crossed his arms over his chest. “If the big, bad death eater breaks your heart, everyone will be crawling all over you. You think it was bad when you and the girl weasel split, imagine if it was me and all the publicity that would bring. Relationships make the papers, but break ups are headlines, Potter.”
“It’s almost time for dinner so we had best get you back to your Gran,” Potter said, still smiling. “She’s probably missing you.”
Draco looked at Potter, confused for a brief moment. Potter just nodded across the street causing Draco to look in that direction. He watched as a house appeared between Number 11 and Number 13. When he looked back at Potter, he was grinning at him.
“No, he may be right,” Granger interrupted. “If anyone can get to Harry, it’s him. He’s never failed to provoke a response. It just might work.”
“Well, if you wanted different things you wouldn’t have been happy together after a while,” Potter mumbled. Draco gave him a look and he seemed to realise what he had said. “I guess it’s not so much a heartbreak as me mourning a future that never really existed then.”
“Coffee is fine,” Draco said, accepting the cup when it was offered to him. As he was adding cream and sugar, Potter stood and retrieved two plates from the stove. He placed one in front of Draco before sitting and removing the stasis spells. Draco looked at the plate, heaping with eggs, bacon, and toast and grinned. “You’re going to make me fat.”
Macmillan just stared at him for a moment before grinning with mischief in his eyes, “Are you into girls or blokes?”
“What work could we possibly have to do? It’s Saturday,” whined Harry. He lunged at Draco trying to grab his pillow. This resulted in a tug of war that caused Harry to pull Draco down on top of him.
Ron considered chasing him, but decided he much preferred holding Pansy’s hand so he let him go. “If he’s going to run from me, then he’s definitely afraid of Hermione,” Ron laughed.
Malfoy looked down at him, taking in his wet hair and clothes. His eyes seemed to soften just a bit as Harry watched him. “We’re both adults, Potter,” he sighed as though he was extremely put upon. “I think we can share a bed that large without making a big deal of it.”
Draco grinned at him, “I like it, as well.” He stepped close to Harry and ran his thumb across Harry’s lips. Leaning forward, he kissed him gently. His lips barely ghosting across Harry’s before pulling away and leaving him wanting more. “Let’s get something to eat,” he chuckled as he took Harry’s hand and led him out into the corridor.
“I didn’t see anything. Nothing at all. I have nothing to talk about,” Ron’s words came out in a rush as his face grew impossibly redder.
“This is more than alright,” Draco grinned and closed the distance between their lips. He gripped Harry’s hips and pulled him closer before sliding a hand up his back, under his shirt. He was again surprised at how warm his skin was. He leaned forward, kissing down Harry’s neck, enjoying the little gasps that he made as soft lips brushed his skin. As he neared his collarbone, he leaned away long enough to pull Harry’s shirt over his head. Moving back in, he once again captured Harry’s lips while his hands explored the smooth expanse of skin he had revealed.
“Nothing happened so calm down,” Harry rolled his eyes. “He had a nightmare so I let him stay. We both know what it’s like.”
“Honestly, I have no idea,” Potter shrugged. “I think maybe the drawing room and then the dining room. Those are the places that would be used the most often. Hermione and Ron helped me clean up a lot when…” he trailed off and glanced at Draco. “When we were hiding from Voldemort.” He shrugged again and shook his head as if to clear it. “Anyways, it’s pretty clean, but everything just looks so old and worn. You can tell that it was nice at one point, but it’s all faded and…”
Harry tried to pull free. “I am, but I need space.” He struggled harder to get free, pushing forward then pulling back suddenly. All this accomplished was to pull Malfoy on top of him.
Ron stared at Harry in shocked silence for several moments. “Yea, you’re right. I should be calm. I look great. Better than Percy ever did,” he muttered the last bit while looking in the mirror.
“I’m in a different corridor,” Draco shrugged. “Would you like to see it?” When Harry nodded, Draco led him down the hall and up a different corridor. He opened a large door and showed Harry into his bedroom.
“We haven’t really talked about it,” Harry said, shrugging his shoulders. “Draco thinks the longer we keep it up, the more real it looks. And we agreed to escort each other to other functions, as well. So, I imagine at least through the spring or maybe longer because I’ll need a date to a few ministry fundraisers Kingsley invited me to.”
“Yes,” Hermione looked a little excited. “I don’t really have friends that are girls. I’m looking forward to getting ready with her. Is that pathetic?”
He sighed dramatically as he stood and walked away from his friends. He received a few curious glances as he crossed the room into the corner that the Slytherins had claimed for themselves. He was used to getting looks so he ignored everyone until he stopped in front of Malfoy.
Harry had to swallow the lump in his throat before he could respond, “What exactly would you consider to be a proper thank you?”
“I don’t have time, Ron,” Harry shook his head. “I have to finish my Transfiguration homework and I haven’t even started my Potions essay. Find someone else. Since we’re all stuck here together, maybe someone from another house will play.”
“If you keep doing that, I’ll be back to sleep,” Harry said, pulling away from him. “I’m visiting Hagrid today. Do you want to come?”
“Yes, darling,” Draco sat on Harry’s bed, leaning back onto his elbows. “I’ve decided that the most reasonable beginning for our relationship would be if I had been tutoring you. Of course, Granger’s been helping you for years, but it hasn’t really changed your study habits. Not to mention she doesn’t really have time with her course load this year. So it makes perfect sense that you would need someone new.”
Their school week passed by much the same. Draco walked Harry to classes, helped him study, and took most meals with him. The whispers had mostly stopped after the Daily Prophet ran the article Wilkes had written, even though the Patil twins and Lavender were doing their best to keep the rumours going. About halfway through the week, Draco received a letter from his mother reprimanding him for not telling her about Harry and making her read about it in the Prophet. She didn’t seem overly mad, just mostly curious as to when he’d bring Harry for dinner.
“The furniture itself seems to be in good shape,” Draco noticed as he wiped the dust from a bureau. They just need a good cleaning and new bedclothes. Definitely some new wallpaper or paint if you want it to be a bit less formal.”
Draco quickly dusted him off again, smirking as he said, “We’ll be finished sooner if you can manage to stay clean for a few minutes.”
“It’s alright,” Harry shrugged. “I was enjoying spending time with you,” he added, causing his cheeks to heat. “I’ve never spent time with anyone like that. Just laying together. It was nice.”
Potter entered first, leaving space for Draco to come in after Teddy so that he was able to close and lock the door. Draco followed him from what must have once been a grand entryway, down a darkened corridor, and into what had to have been the drawing room. The furniture in the room was old and had clearly seen better days, but it was clean.
“If I agree to this,” Malfoy said, turning Harry’s desk chair and sitting so that they faced each other, “I want to be able to leak to the papers that we’re dating. I also want to have the exclusive right to escort you to Hogsmeade on weekends. It’s my right as your boyfriend, after all. Also, I want to reserve the right to have you escort me to one function of my choosing for every function I agree to escort you to.”
He groaned dramatically, laying back on his pillows. “I swear, I think she wants us to be sleeping together.”
Draco growled as he pulled away from him, “We can easily fix that.” He pulled his shirt off and tossed it away from the bed. “Touch me anywhere you like,” he murmured as he started kissing Harry’s neck again. He shuddered as warm hands slid over his back and chest, slowly at first. Exploring his body gently then more roughly as he gripped him tighter. He groaned as Harry’s thumbs flicked across his nipples, drawing them to small peaks.
Harry blushed a bit at this and walked over to the window. “You have a really nice view,” he said, changing the subject. “So, I’ll be way over there, all alone?”
‘I must have used up all my luck,’ Harry thought as he heard someone following him. He thought that maybe if he could at least get to the water in the tunnels, it would cover his scent, but he didn’t make it that far.
Harry looked a bit sad, which surprised Draco until he said, “So, you like being close to me just because we’re friends?” He sounded so disappointed that it made Draco’s heart clench. He pushed away and started to get up.
“Does it really matter?” he asked, shrugging. When they reached Harry’s class, he leaned in and gave Harry a quick peck on the cheek. “I’ll see you later,” he said as he turned away.
“Come on, Harry!” Ron exclaimed, his tone sounding just a bit whiny as he gestured to the chessboard he had set up near the fireplace. “There’s nothing else to do anyways.”
Draco chuckled, “I can fix that.” He grabbed Harry’s wand and did a few quick cleaning spells so that they were clean along with the sheets. He pulled Harry into his chest and kissed his forehead. “Can I tell you something?”
Harry breathed deeply, taking in as much of Malfoy’s scent as he could. “I don’t want to die again,” Harry mumbled against his chest.
“We can do something else tomorrow, if you like.” Draco reached out and trailed a thumb over Harry’s jaw. “Maybe look at the books we have on the sacred 28. See if we can find out more about your family.”
“Not really,” he answered. “I suddenly don’t feel much like going to the great hall. Can we rain check?”
“Yes, I’ve been told,” Malfoy sneered down at him. “Just remember that it’s my ass that you’ll be kissing for the foreseeable future if we both agree to this.”
“Who knows why the ministry makes the choices they do,” Draco shrugged. “I’m not going to question it. I’m just planning on enjoying it.”
When Harry was finished, it took Draco less time than usual to shower and get through his evening routine. When he stepped out of the bathroom, Harry was sitting in the middle of the bed, reading the book Hermione had gotten him.
“So take someone that doesn’t like you,” Ron shrugged. “If you have a date, even if they don’t like you, it’ll get everyone else to leave you alone.”
Draco leaned forward and fixed his glasses. “Just breathe, Potter. It helps.” He stood slowly and took a step back, loosening his tie as he moved. Taking his own advice, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes trying to focus on the music. As he listened to the soft beat, his body started to move along to the rhythm. Deft fingers released buttons easily until his shirt was joining his tie on the floor. His undershirt was removed just as easily, pulled over his head so that his hair was left slightly ruffled in a messy halo.
“What?” Harry seemed a bit taken aback. He looked confused for a moment and then a little hurt as he stepped away from Draco. “What did Ron say to you exactly? Because I never implied to him that we were a couple. I never wanted to push you into anything just because of my feelings.” He stopped talking as he saw the surprise on Draco’s face.
As they ate, they talked about what spells to try next. Should they stick to defensive magic or try offensive spells? “If I had the ability to wield a sword, I think I would like to be well defended first and fast second,” Narcissa added from the head of the table where she had been watching them. “If you can cast defensive spells quickly and accurately while still physically attacking your opponent it will give you the upper hand. Master that first and then work on spells that manipulate the weight of your sword and your movement. Then you’ll be faster and your sword lighter so you won’t tire as easily.” She smiled softly and sipped her tea. “I do have one request. I would like to ward the room you're using so that your magic is contained. We don’t want any misfired spells harming anyone or anything.”
“I wouldn't have expected less, Potter,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I was honestly surprised that you didn’t try to put up a fight in the Great Hall.”
The day of the Yule Ball was a bit hectic. Pansy and Hermione disappeared after breakfast, refusing to allow anyone but Harry in and they kicked him out after he brought them lunch. It then became Harry’s job to calm Ron, who had decided at the last minute to wear a Muggle style suit instead of traditional wizards robes. Harry kept assuring him that he looked great, but it was to no avail.
“Um, yea. I promise,” Hermione smiled at her. She wondered briefly if this was how other girls acted or if it was a Slytherin thing.
After turning up a side street and into what looked to be just another Muggle neighborhood, Potter leaned towards Draco and said, “Harry Potter lives at Number 12, Grimmauld Place.”
“I’m much better than ok,” Malfoy huffed as Zabini sat next to Harry. Goyle looked at the couches and shrugged, sitting on the rug and leaning back next to Malfoy.
Malfoy growled low in his throat as his knot began to swell. He leaned forward, licking the tender spot where Harry’s neck met his shoulder before biting it sharply. With the taste of blood on his tongue, he shoved his knot into Harry, groaning as he came.
Harry opened his mouth to answer and a yawn slipped out before he could speak. He chuckled and shrugged, “Sorry. Tea would be nice, but I’d like to get some rest for tomorrow.”
“Calm down, Potter,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Haven’t you ever heard of sealing it with a kiss? We just made our contract magically binding.”
“You wish,” Potter returned, his cheeks heating in frustration. He stared up at Draco for a moment before sighing deeply. “Let’s just get it over with.” He turned and headed towards the dorms, Draco following behind him.
Everyone settled in to pass out presents, Molly teared up when she unwrapped a lovely green scarf from Narcissa. “I didn’t have time to do more shopping so I hope these are alright,” she said passing lumpy packages to Narcissa, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise. “I didn’t want anyone to feel left out. Thankfully, Hermione was able to help or I wouldn’t have finished them on time.”
“Glad to hear you have a plan,” she said, her tone approving. “I suppose I’ll let you get back to your studies. Behave yourselves.”
Harry inhaled the steam coming from the mug and sighed, “It’s perfect. Thank you.” He sipped it slowly, the steam fogging his glasses. The tea really was perfect. Not too sweet with just a small splash of cream, just how he liked it.
Potter’s face lit up, “Yea. That would be amazing. Thank you.” He led Draco to the entryway and stopped at the bottom of the stairs. “I hope you’re ready for a bit of exercise. There are three floors above us.”
“None of them play quidditch for one,” Hermione shrugged. “Oh, don’t look at me like that. Everyone you’ve dated plays quidditch. You didn’t even look twice at Ginny until after you’d seen her on a broom.”
