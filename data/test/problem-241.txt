“Maybe one drink, I suppose…”  And before he could even finish, he was being dragged off to the Slytherin common room – leaving a flabbergasted Harry behind.  “See you later?” he’d called to him hopefully over his shoulder.
Harry closed the remaining distance and dropped his radio onto the seat with a clang.  He sat on the Malfoy-side of it, using it as an excuse to sit somewhere in the middle without looking ultra-pushy.  Not that he wanted to look like a manspreader either, but oh well.
.  “Yes, Harry, it is.  You’re telling me these parts of your past as if I was a neutral third party – but I
He attempted to pull away, feeling more undeserving of Harry than ever.  But the man’s grip only tightened.
DRACO: [dryly] Nothing yet.  [At the long pause, he schools his expression into one of forced professionalism and continues.]  Ahh, you mean for my landscape?  Yes, today I’m going to make a gingerbread replica of the Bourges Cathedral in France.  My family used to visit it during the holiday season, when the view was at its most exquisite, so that’s what I’m drawing on for today’s theme.
It was a bit after nine o’clock now, and he commended himself for killing enough time that ten was no longer some faraway peak in the distance.  He would just spend a little while going over the charts and adding ideas about how to best organize his two classes to help the students most effectively-
“You think?”  Kat smirked and performed a twirl, which sent the snake-locks snapping through the air.  “I worked for
,” Draco choked out, because before him was the picture of depravity.  Harry’s prick was impossibly hard – completely
One week blended into two, and Draco spent every second he wasn’t teaching either brewing or reading or cursing the fates for entangling his life’s thread irrevocably with Potter’s.  Days like these, it truly felt like his feelings were coming up in knots – smooth and pleasant in some places, while snarled and unclarifiable in others.  It was maddening, and somehow his mother chose that exact week to show up unexpected at the castle.
He watched Harry chew on the passive aggressive comment, no doubt selecting his next words very carefully.  It wouldn’t matter – the topic was already upsetting, so no amount of etiquette could disguise it.
Correction; Ron Weasley didn’t seem to have ever laid eyes on the boy in his life. Harry on the other hand looked and acted as if he had known the boy forever but kept up a flimsy persona of a cheery stranger excited to make new friends.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other in surprise, assessing. It had been only a few months and yet Neville couldn’t imagine them not together.
The problem was, Hermione Granger didn’t like Probable. She liked certainty, clarity, surety. So even if she was almost, quite really,
Ginny flushed as everyone in the common room looked at her oddly at that. She covered her eyes and groaned. But just because her brother was wilfully blind, didn’t mean she was.
(Well. She'd actually been woken up last Friday by Parvati’s shrieks of anger because Lavender had left the window open the night before, and the rain had soaked through her quilt. They’d only had six weeks of being roommates and the three girls were still working on becoming a cohesive unit. Hermione was slightly worried that it would end in homicide before they reached that point.)
Draco arrived late to the party, flustered. Many cheers went up from their group at his fearless escape.
“He’s our best friend.” Ron pointed out, not being able to imagine not having the arrogant but charming blonde around.
“Maybe you should just go back then” Harry said, pointing towards the tunnel entrance which had led them out to the shrieking shack of all places.
They both pushed the round stone door, but the fire pushed back. Neville could feel the heat of it on his palms, warming the stone rapidly. There was an inch of open space still unclosed. Tendrils of flame reached desperately through. Harry was chanting under his breathe.
Harry shook his head, “No. Ron’s right. We need to make the meetings weekly again. Even if it doesn’t come to Hogwarts,” He paused, “We need to be ready, wherever it is,”
When he was out of sight Luna swung her legs back around and lay back down. But she didn’t go back to napping. She just stared at the sky and thought.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, but then realised she really didn’t have the energy right now to care about his plots. She rolled her eyes and went to wash her hands next to a fidgety Harry.
They step into a simple room, made plain in its banality. Softly carpeted, tastefully wallpapered, lightly furnished. There was two stuffed high-back armchairs facing a small spindly table with a record player atop it. Next to the table was a milk-bottle crate filled with records. Just as her mother’s had been.
Hermione stopped at the door of an abandoned classroom “I suppose this would be poetic.” She said, smiling tightly ta Harry. She looked at Ron, “This was where Harry told me.”
Ginny turned eleven years old, finally, before Harry Potter came to stay at the Burrow. Eleven felt no different than ten had. Molly pinned up Ginny’s Hogwarts letter with the six others on to the side of the well-worn welsh dresser. Bills was already yellowed with sun and age, a few shades darker than Ginny’s, which was still fighting against Molly’s sticking charm, trying desperately to curl back into the scroll it had been delivered in. It was neither the first- and so far never the final- time that Ginny had come last in a line of her brothers.
“You appeared out of no where on Platform 9 and ¾ last September, eleven years old again” Hermione supplied, mind flickering back to the first time she’d seen Harry all the way back at the beginning of the year.
“I’m not dramatic about anything” Draco exclaimed, dramatically. There was a brief pause as they all digested this obvious lie before Draco spoke again “Alright maybe you have a point”
“I can’t believe how calm this whole thing has been.” Harry said with disbelief as the sat in the stands surrounding he maze.
The fourth year DADA class had seen Tonks accidentally start and hastily put out four fires. It was only the first week of November.
He stepped up and plucked the box out of Harry’s hand, tossing it nervously in the air and catching it. Harry gave him a wondering look. Sirius grinned ruefully, and then he turned and knelt down in front of Professor Lupins armchair.
“Oh, call me Molly” Her mum said, coming forward to envelope the scrawny boy in a hug. Ginny could tell that her mother was already making plans to adopt him as her eighth child.
Harry still stood by his first-year habit of hiding under things as often as possible, whether that be the table, a tented book or in Hermione’s hair. Small shrieks of fear and deep flushes of embarrassment clouded Harry’s every step in potions. Every time he was tasked with going to the ingredient’s cupboard, he treated it like some deadly mission- tiptoeing around the classroom and hiding behind pillars every time he thought Snape had spotted him or was coming his way.
Luna had also decided to sneak into Gryffindor tower rather than stay with the Ravenclaw lot. She was the first one down the stairs, dressed in a floaty orange dress that was just on the slight side of garish. She had clementine earrings to match and her shoes were large, hob-nailed boots. Harry grinned at her widely, offering her his arm.
“Ugh. Even when you’re bullying her it’s sickeningly cute,” Ginny said, making an exaggerated face of disgust.
She’s honestly thought they were having a perfectly normal day. The Granger’s and their guests had caught the train into the city early that morning. They’d had a lovely breakfast, a quick tour of the usual tourist traps, a lovely lunch, and then on to the main event. Hermione’s current raison d’etre. The Natural History Museum in all its glory.
Luna loses things often- her shoes, her belongings. Her herbology homework (especially when she doesn’t want to do it). She lost her mother.
“Not a clue” Fred said. Then he grinned devilishly “Let’s go check it out and see if we can make it fun”
Neville didn’t know where the cup went after they stole it. He still didn’t know why they had stolen it, at all. The trio remained as tight lipped as ever, and Neville was never again invited to one of their meetings.
Luna had walked past Ron, sitting town and softly telling him the news. Ron had watched Neville’s face go parchment white, his hands coming up to clutch uselessly at his jumper. Ron’s stomach dropped to watch it, but Luna swept him into a tight hug.
“Well at least it isn’t that.” He said with relief. Hermione gave him a soft smile and he blushed, though he couldn’t say why.
“Cedric Diggory.” Dumbledore called out warmly, on the night of Halloween. The Hufflepuffs burst into raucous applause and the rest of the hall followed sedately behind.
“You never know,” Draco said grimly, “In these times.” But he sat down on a gold-bowed chair either way, falling into grinning chatter with Harry.
This boy made out of stainless steel knives and chrome keeps himself alive, but he is not the boy I know. He ruffles the ink-black hair with the same hands, blinks through the same emerald eyes but a person is much more than their body. A person is their mind.
Ron stared at her for a long moment, brows scrunched. Then he scoffed, grabbed Ginny’s Bertie Botts and headed up the stairs to his dormitory.
Pandora hadn’t been like Molly Weasley. That’s what Luna remembers. Where Molly Weasley was brilliant in a softer way, Pandora had been all sharp edges. Sincere and unfailingly honest with Luna. Tidy in every place but her lab which sat at the bottom of their rook house. Luna would sit, feet dangling, on whichever work bench Pandora wasn’t working on, padded out in a bubble of protection charms, and ask a million questions. Pandora would answer every single question with the same brutal honesty, regardless of whether it was age appropriate for how ever old Luna was at the time. Pandora Lovegood did not believe in censoring the world for Luna.
Draco was like a kitten. He constantly sought Harry’s attention, good or bad. If he had to irritate Harry into giving him that attention, he would. Then when he had the attention he’d act aloof and preen, then sulk when this inevitably made Harry stop paying attention. It was a vicious cycle, but it was funny to watch. Draping himself on Harry and being as close to him as possible was one of the blondes favourite methods, it seemed.
The wedding was beginning to wrap up when Neville found himself sitting next to a forlorn looking best woman. Tonks was dressed in a suit, too, and had morphed her hair into the classic Black family raven curls. Though she did keep the ends bubble-gum pink.
Another sigh.  “Very well.  I was planning to speak with Harry already, given the situation with his classes this morning, so I suppose I might as well confront this while I’m at it.”
“Gloves, huh?” he muttered, as the pieces began falling into place.  “It’s all starting to come together.”  He pressed Harry’s mouth open with a thumb to his bottom lip, cataloguing the glazed eyes and quickened breath as he did.
The last curse sent Harry over the edge, and he was clawing Draco like an animal as his body shuddered and spilled.  Spasms wracked that body, and Draco milked them from him, savoring every jerk and jump of Harry’s cock against his palm.  His fist flew even faster now with the cum slicking between them; the obscene sound it made drove him higher and higher until he, too, exploded.
That was how, in the frosty beginnings of March, Draco came to be employed at Morpheus’ Miscellany.  He lived in the back room, which the owner didn’t seem to mind as long as he didn’t steal ingredients (he counted them daily, too), and he spent his weekly wages on food sent for with his boss’ owl.  It was a pathetic sort of existence to be sure.  But, worst of all, Draco didn’t even
He’d peeled at them then, fighting snaps and ties as the wet garments clung, heavy and constricting.  The thrill of it alone had had Harry panting before anything else even happened; when his cock was freed, he’d groaned aloud at the rush of air and warm water sensations.
, he wanted to say.  Instead, he conveyed his question slowly, emphasizing the consonants in some irrational attempt to make Morpheus remember it all correctly.  But, as usual, this only backfired on him, as the man got it in his head that Draco was mocking him.
. There are important events and conversations that will be mentioned, but not rewritten in their entirety, to cut down on redundancy in this sequel. However, there's also going to be new bits featuring portions of Draco's recent past (the two years between the war and then teaching). Therefore, this story is going to be a bit darker and angstier than TNFI, just by nature of Draco's journey being a little darker and angstier.
him.  But Draco wanted to be hurt – he wanted something less fleeting than Potter’s spellwork ghosting over his skin.  His body ached with the hunger for it.
He found Harry eventually, leaning against the risers behind the pitch, and was startled to see Sam slumped beside him.  From a distance, Harry looked up and caught his eye, tapping a finger to his lips with a sad smile.  Draco nodded; Sam still hadn’t looked up, so he backtracked, slipping behind the risers and out of sight as he left.
“Fine!  Fine.  Look, Ginny…now’s not the best time-”  His voice jumped in pitch as Draco pinched him hard enough to tug free of Harry’s grip, and then his mouth was latched around his cock again.  He tried – rather unsuccessfully – to stifle both the gasp of surprise and subsequent groan of ecstasy.
Draco stood, grinning like a loon.  “Wouldn’t miss it,” he said – and he wouldn’t.  Not for anything in the world.
Clearly inspired by the interest, Grant undid the final clasps of Draco’s trousers and yanked them down so he could grasp him.  Draco was only partially surprised to see that he was hard.  He’d wanked to countless, faceless men, after all; though, more often than not, they took on a very

Draco’s heart pounded in his chest, watching the messy black locks fall in Potter’s eyes as he walked.  Other than the papers, he hadn’t had a chance to lay eyes on him in so long.  Merlin, how had he
He gathered his things, aiming his smile at his stack of books and trying not embarrass himself.  Teaching might not end up so terrible after all.
“No really – it’s my longest and most elaborate prank yet,” he insisted, actions belying his words as his face inched closer and closer to Harry’s.  They kissed, and it was a cataclysm of hands and cheeks and eyelashes.  Draco pulled Harry in with a firm grip at his nape, while Harry surged against Draco like a wave.  He crowded Draco against the wall with searing hands.
His humor had mostly faded by the time he reached the Manor, but there were traces of it left in his system – enough so that, having kept a perfectly neutral expression for the past few minutes, he suddenly broke into a smile remembering Harry’s adorable incredulousness when he’d said he had to leave.  The next few moments, of course, were inevitably spent rearranging his face so that his parents could read nothing of the events that had transpired – and, in that way, they could belong to no one but him.
“You’re not getting out of this through diversion, my little almost-Slytherin,” he murmured.  But instead of answering, Harry just shivered and licked his lips in the most delectable way.
Grabbing his spoon with a vengeance, Draco dug in with a glare.  His mind was still whirling with all the possible arguments he could make to dismantle his father’s illogical conclusions.  But that was the point – they were
She stared out the darkened window for a while before continuing.  “So in the beginning, I didn’t mind, you see.  That we were welcoming in convicts.  In those days, Bagman had me convinced that we’d created a safe place for Wizarding folk like us who had lost ours – that the system was unjust, and we were fighting back.”  She heaved another sigh, this one lifting and dropping her shoulders with the weight of disillusionment.
like a date,” Anna continued, “so we’ll leave you to it.”  She smiled, and her friends giggled nervously – other than the one girl who was still murmuring things like “oh my god,

His eyes flicked to hers.  He was losing the battle – he knew they were bright with unshed tears.  “Why are
forgotten, Draco had spent the rest of the class watching Harry closely, eyes trailing him as he circled the class to offer help, miraculously never ending up in the same corner as Draco thereafter.  Draco had busied himself with a study of the back of Harry’s head – and was his neck slightly darker than usual, with the tinge of unwanted blush?
.  Who’s to say when you’ll be attacked next?  You could be crossing the street one day and get in front of a nasty hex-and-run.  It’s vital to be prepared in moments like these.”
Draco yanked down Harry’s trousers enough to expose his arse, but didn’t bother going further.  They hadn’t the time – everything else would have to stay on.  Draco needed him
Had he not grown to anticipate the way Harry’s pupils would dilate at the imperious tone, he might have thought it too much.  But, once again, Harry’s body was projecting these tells – leaving a trail of clues to his surprising, tangled desires.
Finally, after clunking up the stands to an irrepressibly vivacious chorus, Harry made it to where the 8th years were sitting.  As promised, Ron had sat somewhat near Malfoy – though, their definitions of “near” seemed to differ, as Ron had left room for about half the class between them on the bench.
He finally met Harry’s eyes and found that they were wide and nearly as shocked and delicately hopeful as he felt.  “Wait, you’re not…kidding, are you?”  He
“With…Ginevra?” Draco repeated, as he processed that possibility for the first time.  If Potter had had a fight with the Weasley girl, then maybe – just
“Yes, Hermione,” he droned.  “‘Oh Malfoy – you look like someone who appreciates fresh produce!  Won’t you accompany me to the farmer’s market?  Or, better yet – let’s cast aside this corporate wasteland and both join a
VOLDEMORT: Right.  Well, that leaves this one… [he gestures to CEDRIC’s – surprising no one] in first place!
“Mister Malfoy is joining us again?” one of the students asked as Harry bustled around the room, prepping.  Draco didn’t think there were any particular preparations needed for
In fact, he was so deeply focused on the story being written between his and Harry’s glances that he hardly noticed McGonagall announcing the results of the decoration contest, and it was only the loud cheer from Hufflepuff table that startled him from his overly-invested analysis of the shape of Harry’s ears.
[HARRY sighs and continues whisking.  All of a sudden, the camera jerks away from the pot and catches the tail end of DRACO, retreating.]
Something in Potter seemed to snap at that sentence, and when he looked up at Draco again, his eyes were burning with a barely-muted rage.  “What do you want, Malfoy?”  His voice was hardly audible in the wide, stone hallway.
“Draco!  Draco, you won’t believe it!”  Naturally, it was this very moment that Harry’s voice came echoing down the hall.  There were two quick knocks on the door before it was thrown open, and the man himself was halfway into the room.
Remembering their argument now, Draco was astounded by his former naiveté.  It had been less than a month ago – really only a few weeks – and he’d already tired of the sex and the men he’d thought would release him.  For so long, he’d felt crushed into an unsuitable mold and believed that cracking it open would unleash him.
He worked Harry open gently – giving him the time that none of his hook-ups had ever afforded Draco.  He would make this
“Sit down!” Father commanded.  And, because Draco had exhausted himself with his tirade, he complied.
And then Potter was stepping back – down another step, head tilting upwards to meet Draco’s gaze for a millisecond before darting away for him to mumble “thanks.”
“Like you’re one to talk,” he finally managed – and from the confused expression on Kat’s face but rapid blush on Marla’s, he realized that maybe he’d been too hasty in his assumptions.  Dammit – now he felt
[The bakers scramble to wield their weapon of choice: the mighty Kitchenaid.  Grit and determination show on their faces as they set their jaws and buckle down for one more round of battle – the only way they know how.  With the scene set, it cuts back to FRED to introduce some more recaps.]
Harry’s eyes clouded, pained.  Draco’s words hung unexpectedly heavy in the air, and after several moments he rushed to dispel them.
Those eyes flittered open, and Draco’s stomach dropped with relief to see the familiar light of defiance burning brightly within them.  It took a moment, but his lip quirked slightly as he responded, “You wish.”
Discomforted no doubt by the intensity of his reaction, Harry was now blushing.  “Err, I suppose.”  He said it like it didn’t matter – like this was just some casual, alternate path he could’ve walked and been fine with.  Not the earth-shattering realization it was to Draco.
The man looked thrown by that, and his lips curled downward into an indignant frown.  “I know words, Draco.”
The former star laughed as he handed Draco a broom.  “Oh, rejects, villains – people down on their luck, like you and me!  There’s a whole slew of champions that the official league would never take.”
The following week flowed by sweet as honey.  In the long stretches of afternoon after Draco’s flight classes, he’d begun carting his books up to Gryffindor tower to lounge in Harry’s office while he worked.  He read a mixture of books on gender theory – disillusioned to look like Potions books – and
“How long?” Harry finally asked.  And Draco was so confused by the context, and immediately, possibilities flitted through his mind only to be promptly rejected.
can help.”  He looked up at Draco with such resolute, hope-filled eyes that it made him wither with guilt for causing him distress.
He wished things between them could be simple again – just tea and murmured horoscopes and carefree walks on windless afternoons.  They would never be that way again, he knew, and acknowledging that fact was harder than postponing the confrontation indefinitely.
“I know,” Draco said, “I just like doing it, because it makes me feel commanding. By the way, how did you like going to Flavortown?”
He took a sip of his tea, permitting himself a few seconds warmth from her praise.  It was a pity they couldn’t always be like this.  There had been a time when things were easy – or perhaps he just told himself that to get by.
Harry’s gaze snapped to his, eyes widening at the confession.  He sucked in a deep breath.  “You mean…even fourth year-”
Tuesday afternoons were usually reserved for watching Quidditch practice, as it gave the 8th years an excuse to get fired up about the sport they weren’t allowed to participate in, as well as the opportunity to hide drinks under the bleachers and pass them around when McGonagall wasn’t looking.  Today was no exception, and the only divergence from the routine was that Harry showed up in a crop top with a boombox over his shoulder blasting Y.M.C.A. by the Village People.
Draco was in a foul mood that evening after their duel, and he had almost made it back to his chambers from dinner when he was halted by a shout and a great shuffling of robes.
t/w: more flashbacks to consensual yet uncomfortable sex (not with Harry) and some unnegotiated pain-play in the first section; (later), blowjobs and handjobs in the "present"
After about an hour of practice, he had given all the advice he could think of, and he bid them good afternoon when they decided to stay on a bit longer.  It sort of reminded him of his own days of practices when he was a student – the long hours he’d run drills, even after the rest of the team had finished, in order to beat Potter to the snitch.  It had never worked, at least not then.  But perhaps tonight would be the match for his luck to change.
[The camera whirls around as Harry tromps back to his pot.  The milk is bubbling and brown around the edges – clearly burnt.]
[MINERVA looks touched, but VOLDEMORT seems to be holding back an eye roll at the blatant sentimentality.  DRACO is
As Draco woke, his thoughts flew immediately to the previous night.  Had it been a dream?  Or had he really gotten off with Harry after reading smutty prose?  The description alone sounded unreal, and he forced himself to focus on the series of events to make sure they followed a logical, worldly progression.

known – would’ve known those eyes anywhere - but it didn’t matter either way.  His indecision in that moment had helped neither Potter nor him, so he didn’t see why the man was so fixated on it.
He didn’t mean it – not really.  So when Harry wrapped his arms around his neck and pulled him down for a kiss, Draco let himself melt into it.  He gave as good as he got, and within seconds, he felt the unmistakable rush of arousal lancing through him.
He liked it though – the thought of it.  Not being the one to try so bloody hard all the time for the reward of resounding apathy, a frown in his direction if he was lucky.  Draco decided that, for once, he would indulge his fantasies.  Just for a moment.
are complicated because of your mutual past, then I can only imagine the mess of complications you must feel for
Draco rolled up his sleeve and looked at his Mark in disgust.  There was no point in hiding it – everyone knew it was there.  When he covered it, the only one he was hiding it from was himself.
He cleared his throat with effort, trying to chase away the damning thoughts.  Trying to reign the conversation back to safer grounds.  “I’ll have plenty of opportunity to beat you at
I feel like life has hit me hard lately, and summer has really demotivated me to write anything at all, so I'm not going to pretend that writing one new chapter has magically cured me of being untrustworthy, but I will do my genuine best not to let it get this long between updates.
Inside, Draco’s heart was hammering in his chest, but it didn’t prevent him from offering a cocky smile.  “Potter, you haven’t given me a time.”
So Draco told her.  He described the working conditions, the mistreatment, the threats that Morpheus had leveled against him that night as well as the discoveries his breach of privacy had purveyed.  He outlined as much as he could remember as
GEORGE: Welcome contestants, welcome Voldemort and Minerva!  And welcome to your final. Showstopper. Challenge.
Draco felt a smile split his face, and he transmuted his happiness the only way he knew how when dealing with Harry: he became an utter prat.  If he didn’t, the only alternative was professing his love on his knees – and,
The man’s eyes trailed him up and down.  When they reached his eyes again, they lingered, and something in that predatory gaze was reminiscent of Nagini’s glare.  It pinned him down almost effortlessly.  “Then you better make a friend quick who can.”
Potter seemed a bit like he might explode, and his voice was at least three octaves higher when he screeched, “Have a little shame!” before ducking his head from the sight.
Malfoy hummed in response, and by the time Harry looked up at him again, his eyes were back on the game.
so bloody much…”  He broke off, rubbing his eyes.  It was suddenly too much to continue that sentence.
it – after years of lusting and dreaming.  It had a good girth to it, and the velvety skin felt even more perfect in his grip than he could have imagined.
Harry made a snarky comment about what would happen if they lost their “star performer,” which Draco played into with ease.  For once, the atmosphere between them was warm and softened from its usual animosity.  He was so busy basking in it that he reached the double doors quite by accident and stopped, unsure how to proceed.
He ignored his father’s indignant huff and kept his eyes trained on his mother.  She drew in a sharp breath before answering.
For a while, she said nothing.  Instead, she let her hand droop, broom falling to rest on the ground.
.  Which is the reason I test it in isolation.  You could say something you regret horribly – which is the very nature of dealing with
But Potter looked so open and hesitant here, in a way he normally only observed from afar.  He found his thoughts looping back to the question that had plagued him for weeks now: was Potter
“Maybe,” he said at last, with just enough cheek to make Draco reach out and cup his face while smiling radiantly.  It was cheesy, he knew – but for once, he couldn’t help it.
“Good,” he said briskly.  “I expect your mother has dinner waiting in the dining room.”  He turned without further comment, and Draco found himself almost running to keep up.  It reminded him of doing the same thing as a child – always following his father a few, eager steps behind, and he felt sick.
His father, as it turned out, had caught wind of his illicit Quidditch dealings – but, more importantly, his illicit dealings with
“…Thinking.”  He couldn’t very well say “counting all the ways in which I’ve fallen in love with you.”
“Thank you, Clover,” Draco said through gritted teeth, resenting his mother’s presumptuousness.  “That will be all.”
RON: [confessional aside; speaking faintly] Mum’s going to kill me… She told me I’d better make it to the finals, or I could kiss my chances of inheriting her Yorkshire pudding recipe goodbye.  She’s never shared it with me – even when I begged her in fourth year for a cooking contest.  Now I’m never going to get my hands on it…  [He looks a bit green as a realization washes over him.]  Heck, she might even give it to
Then, the world exploded into sound as a bludger crunched into his shoulder from behind.  He pushed up from the ground, blinking determinedly as his eyelids caught with something tacky.  Through the whirlwind of bats and fists descending upon him, he zeroed in on one distant figure sitting as a spectator in the stands.
Harry met his eyes for a long moment, seeming – for once – like he was measuring his words carefully.  “I would rather people didn’t make such a big deal out of my life.”
[CEDRIC carries up his perfect platter of rugelach, split evenly between the two flavors down the middle.  Delicate blossoms complement the biscuits and create the overall effect of elegance that it is clear the judges are looking for.]
to calm himself down when something vexing happened (usually as a direct result of Potter these days).
Draco watched his muscles work, clenching and relaxing his cheeks in waves of soreness.  Before the final blow, Harry surprised him by sticking his arse out a fraction in anticipation.
Each morning, he woke with the conviction that he was going to quit.  He sat up woodenly on the bench that doubled as his bed and got halfway to the front of the shop before he inevitably froze.
of breaking his promise to Judge Graddlethorn.  Then, reading Harry’s look of wonderment again, felt distinctly like he was missing something.  “Do you want me to?”
At that, he promptly shut up because A) they were being too loud – even under a mild silencing charm – and B) he was absolutely mortified.  Which meant, of course, that Harry was going to latch onto it and continue this line of conversation.
Then, he sagged against the doorway, wand arm falling back to his side.  It was over – finally.  And, as good as it felt to knock the ego out of Jameson, Grant’s words haunted him as he considered his prison again.
Harry laid a hand on his shoulder and faced him.  “I think that if you asked her, Minerva would give you permission too.”  He said it seriously, too, like he truly believed it.
you?”  Ginny’s face was flushed from laughing so much.  Beside her, Luna giggled over her butterbeer.
But what to do with it?  He could simply transfigure a bunch of copies of it for Potter’s office.  That would be fun.  But it lacked originality - he was better than that.  What else could he do?
Draco could hear his racing heartbeat in his ears as he backed up a step and dared to hope.  “Just a game?”  If it was
way to use them,” he remarked.  He continued further into the room, choosing to lean against one of the desks facing Harry.  “Anyway, I wanted to talk.  Well, to
It would be incredible to ride, he knew – despite his nerves, his fingers were twitching to hold one, to test it out – but riding an unknown broom into a match also made him incredibly anxious.  He was thinking about refusing when they hit the final step and a cacophony of noise washed over him.  Then, his thoughts fell away altogether.
Before he realized he was moving, he had his wand at Lucius’ neck.  When he spoke, his voice came out low and furious.
“No, I’m good!” Harry yelped, dodging his friend’s overeager attempt to help.  “I had to sit through you plunging a needle through my ear for this – I think I’m going to keep it a while.”  He didn’t mention that he also enjoyed twirling the stud when class got particularly boring.
He tried to speak as evenly and emotionlessly as possible, to pretend he didn’t care how vulnerable he was making himself.  But he made the mistake of glancing up at McGonagall’s mask of sympathy, and his voice stuttered before continuing.
Potter was trying to drive him crazy – it was as simple as that.  And he wasn’t going to take that lying down.  Draco ripped the sheet from his wall and took off towards the pitch.
GINNY: It wasn’t going to be done on time, so I figured a healthy brown glow would be better than serving ‘raw dough.’  I know how Voldemort hates that ‘raw dough.’
it be?”  She tapped her wand against the papers, and they sorted themselves nicely before floating into the appropriate filing drawers.  When she looked back at him, she seemed to have regained some of her composure – which, with a woman like Minerva McGonagall, was a reassuring sight.  “What is it this time?”
Potter was uncharacteristically tidy, in a sleek, grey suit that fit snug to his body.  A green waistcoat showed off the narrow lines of his waist, and the white shirt beneath it remained open at the collar.
“How could he do that?” Harry interrupted, eyes glittering with a barely-suppressed rage.  “How could he, after everything you’d endured – everything
Draco drew himself up, trying to regain some wounded pride with a dignified sniff.  “It was an ambush, really.  Psychological warfare.  She came at me in the common room yesterday, talking about how she had once dreamed of going to the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts – how she was practically an actress anyway, despite not having any formal training, and that she would be the star of any production Hogwarts could conceivably produce (though we both know it won’t, given the ban on all theatre performances for the past decade).  Anyway, combined with how she keeps wresting control from me regarding the decorating contest, I was a little irked to say the least.  So I
MINERVA: That sounds like an awful lot.  [She pushes her squared-off spectacles higher on the bridge of her nose.]  Are you going to be able to make all three doughs and get them chilling with enough time to complete the bake?
“So how’d it go, mate?”  Ron had tentatively forgiven him for both standing him up at the library and getting Hermione involved in the plan, but only after Harry had pleaded and threatened to have Hermione formulate a grand make-up plan for the two of them.  Really, though, his protests had mostly been for effect, and Ron seemed content to spend this time with his girlfriend – especially now that they could chat about it over supper instead of hiding away in the library all the time.  Ron still insisted that books gave him rashes.
HARRY: Mine, sir.  [He, too, looks ashamed – though he is facing it with as much bravado as he can muster.]
Harry had just started to ask him something starting with “Do you-” when a knock broke them from their sappy stares.
She smiled slightly.  “We are – though we’ll get to that.”  She paused, glancing at him seriously.  “But for now, I think it’s time you tell me what is going on.”
Mourning the loss of touch already, Draco straightened his back for the unavoidable conversation to come.  Seeming to notice his hand for the first time, Harry released his shirt quickly, shuffling backwards on the desk with a blush.
Another second of shuffling, and his trousers were tugged off completely.  Harry kicked off his shoes next, stumbling and hissing as the wand dug further into his neck, but the bulge in his pants growing all the while.
“Not literally,” Slughorn rushed to add at the expression on his face.  “No – certainly not!  I would never accuse…
He stewed on the events of the day, not even realizing he’d gotten lost in his thoughts until he felt Harry take his hand gently in his and begin to rub circles against his skin.  “How long do you think he has, then?”
From his seat at the table that he’d sank into, Draco merely stared.  It was his father’s cue to continue – which was what he was looking for, anyway.  A reason to continue berating him.
[The bakers scramble to read their packets and ready their machines.  The pressure is higher than it’s ever been before – and it shows in their demeanors.  Well…in HARRY and DRACO’s, that is; a bland smile remains upon CEDRIC’s face as he flips a page while humming a holiday tune.]
He was cleaning up the quaffles and dismantling charms after class when he felt a light tug on his robes.  “Yes, Ella?  Did you need something?”
It had been irritating at the time, of course.  But it had also been all that kept him this side of sane with the Dark Lord living in his house.  Potter’s frantic attentions had been
A sudden clap broke the hush that had settled over the room, startling Harry from where he’d been wordlessly staring at Malfoy.  He tore his gaze away to see that it was Ginny.
.  They were supposed to be fighting, he thought; all the other Auror trainees were watching them supposedly demonstrate hand-to-hand combat.  But he could’ve sworn he’d heard Malfoy’s taunt before, but in a completely different context—
“Draco, how’d it go?” Harry asked as Draco stepped out of the fireplace.  “I was starting to worry.”
“Oh,” Harry mumbled, face flaring with color.  He scrubbed the back of his neck with a hand, trying fervently for a casual expression.  “Hopefully you weren’t thinking about how my drooly, sleeping face is a deal-breaker.”
like a showstopper piece.  And because you didn’t add anything to it, the flavors will- [he takes a haughty bite] will…  Okay, that’s actually quite nice.  But the frosting- [he stabs more onto his spoon and takes another bite] is…actually very good as well.
It was freeing; it was thrilling; it was…utterly unhelpful for improving their Quidditch techniques.  But he figured a practice or two like that wouldn’t kill them, either.  He wished
As he came closer, however, Bagman threw on his most unctuous smile and clapped a hand onto his shoulder before Draco could move to stand.  “
“They’re gone,” she said, grabbing his shoulders and easing him back onto the bed.  “It’s okay now.  I was just beginning to heal you.”
Grant tapped his wand to Draco’s ribs, and even that slight touch made him crumple with the pain.  “
Draco had spent the afternoon with Hannah the other day, only to hear an endless stream of horror stories about all the things students could incorrectly transfigure salamanders into.  (The worst of these was, undoubtedly, a singing blowtorch, which harmonized with Peeves as half the classroom went up in flames.)  Not having anything sufficiently terrible to relate in return, Draco had awkwardly described a Quidditch scrimmage in which someone had fallen into a patch of stinging nettle.  Hannah had not looked very impressed.
”  He cleared his throat quickly and forced himself not to sound too surprised.  “That’s rather…impressive.”
“Well?” she asked once they were seated.  It really felt like an interview, too: all awkward and like he’d gotten off on the wrong foot before it even began.
” And like magic, probably because it was, Harry was perfectly lubed up and ready to go. Draco went down and began to lick between his cheeks. “Mmmmm, the flavored lube worked.” He licked around Harry’s rim and then gently dipped his dingus into Harry’s warm crevasse.
DRACO: [Reluctantly, he puts down his measuring implements, though his hands drum on the table with impatient energy.] I’m making three different kinds of rugelach with three separate doughs.  The first will be a chocolate and peppermint rugelach with chocolate dough, cream filling, and crushed fresh peppermint leaves.  The second is going to use a traditional dough and be paired with a strawberry-rhubarb filling, topped with candied ginger and bits of gold leaf.  And the final one is going to be a savory one, combining an herby, smoky paprika dough with a thin layer of stilton and jamón ibérico.
His memory of their first hookup was driving Draco insane.  For some idiotic reason, he had suggested
The familiar spell caught him off guard, and then he was flipping through the air and hitting the wall with a crunch.  It scratched at his itch.
[Scene dawns on the lovable red-headed emcees, FRED and GEORGE WEASLEY, smiling as they hold neatly bundled holiday biscuit packages up in front of their faces.  Snowmen and reindeer shimmer delicately through the cellophane, and the homey festivity of the scene plays upon the audience’s familial nostalgia.  They peek at each other from behind the biscuits.]
Harry’s façade of casualness was crumbling now, and he was beginning to chew at his lip.  “Err, no.  The…first one.”
SIRIUS: [confessional aside] Snivellus?  Hah, he’s just mad that my bread chain does better than his – that, and I don’t need to kill myself with work to make it so.  His bakery tanked, and then he was forced to become a professor for money.  You know what they say: if you can’t do,
Draco met his gaze for a long moment before answering.  It wasn’t a part of his heritage he was eager or even prepared to share, but it wasn’t something he could lie about – not now.  Not to Harry.  “
Harry glanced up with interest at that.  “Why?  I won’t laugh.”  He began tracing his fingers up Draco’s calf.
Which was likely why it hurt so much for the dream to be stolen from him later with a sarcastic comment from his father.
nervous for, however, was the dinner Harry had set up for tomorrow between the two of them, Weasley, and Granger.
Draco pulled out his wand, whispering the protection and lubrication charms, before sliding a finger inside him.  Harry took it easily – like maybe he’d already tried it while Draco was out.
“Yes,” he whispered back, and the word sent a thrill up Draco’s spine.  It unlocked a well of possibilities.

“I mean, he’s always been such an imposing, influential presence; I can’t imagine a world where he’s not there.  In the Manor.  Looking down his nose at whatever letter he’s received from the Ministry.  Taking tea in the garden and sending it back if it’s not perfectly steeped.  Generally being a pompous git.”

“You know, the spell would go much better for you if you admitted he makes you happy.  Trust me, that’s the only way I got it to work.”
He slipped out of bed, pulling on some trousers, a shirt, and a soft, cashmere jumper.  He was in the process of buckling his belt when he noticed the outline of an owl perched imperiously by the window.
by the end of the lesson, including Sam.  Though, for Draco, that made his feeble attempts all the more humiliating.  He tried thinking back on those warm memories of his mother, the way the two of them would primp before a gala once Father was safely out of the room.  He thought about the way she’d coo about “her little Gemini” and tell him the legends of each constellation before bed.  In those moments, he could see the glow of the spell beginning at the tip of his wand.
Marla plopped heavily into the chair in front of his desk.  “Yeah.  Just…leaping toadstools.  They’re not the most fun to catch.

Draco descended the stairs into the basement.  He’d had no wand to check at the door, and the bartender had shot him a complicated look before stepping aside to let him pass.  That, more than anything thus far, knocked into him a sense of foreboding – a feeling that Bagman was clearly trying to dispel, as he chatted endlessly on the way down.
DRACO: When I’ve done the timed runs at home, I’ve been going a little over.  But I’ve written myself a new timetable, so if I adhere to it, I think I’ll be okay.
went on in the girls’ dorm.  Other boys went crazy speculating, but he had always been rather blasé until now.
The waiting was no good.  It made him deadpan and overanxious in turns, and his last performance had left him most unsatisfied – he’d started off too eager, as it were, having been delighted at the sight of a person, and that had altered the course of the whole event).
each, as is procedure, and you will answer a short series of questions in the five-minute window that provides.  If, for whatever reason, you have not answered all of my questions at that time, you can choose either to forfeit your opportunity to regain your wand at today’s meeting and reschedule for another time, or we will administer another drop and proceed in that manner until either you’ve forfeited or completed all the questions.  Do you verbally acknowledge that you understand the outlined process?”

, because Mother’s next move was to blink dramatically at him, saying, “Oh, Draco dear!  I had all but forgotten you were here.  After all, you showed no interest, I believe, in ‘chatting over tea.’”  She smiled.  “Unless you’ve changed your mind?”
until his mind felt suitably expanded with new ideas.  In fact, he kind of wanted to give it another go after dinner.
They finished up their safety check within the hour, and he rushed back to his chambers to sleep before the game that would come in the morning.  He knew it wasn’t possible – not tonight, at least – but for a brief moment, he entertained the thought of stopping by Harry’s room on the way.  More than anything, he wanted to see him and continue the kiss from this morning that seemed so long ago already.
[They both take a bite, and VOLDEMORT makes intense eye contact with CEDRIC as he chews.  It lasts far longer than is comfortable and is definitely part of the psychological game he plays with contestants.  Eventually, he breaks the silence.]
“Fine,” Draco echoed, the high of his refusal mingling with fresh fear and foreboding.  He stared Grant down until the man turned and left.
Hannah grinned right back.  “He didn’t really respond to it much, just grumbled that she was being ridiculous and ‘as bad as Ron and Hermione about it,’ and that ‘he’s definitely
And this was too much, too soon – too early in the day.  They hadn’t even had a proper fuck yet, and Harry was expecting him to unload his daddy issues.  “I don’t need you
After all, what did Potter have to keep him busy these days?  Like he’d previously established, it wasn’t likely that the man was spending all that time
In order for the house elves to find him, though, he had to use his real name – so he had no illusions that the food went untampered with.  Some days, his soup tasted more like a bowl of spit than “potato leek” – or whatever they were advertising – and, poor as he was, he just had to eat and bear it.
For the scrimmage, he told his class to land and take notes of the moves they recognized in a desperate attempt to rein his thoughts back to professionalism.  It was a
He knew it was mean, but Potter had been craving punishment with his own little prank.  It was only fair.
Draco sat up straight.  “Student?” he mouthed to Harry, full of compounding guilt for the office-hour prank.
’ to practice against?”  He felt more than a little disgusted.  With Potter for suggesting it; with himself, for inevitably going along with it – if that was what it took to be near him.
[It seems he is not the only one who is annoyed, as we cut to DRACO, who has clearly overheard their conversation from his bench.  His eyebrows pinch together even more than they had already, and the effect is a permanent line of disapproval etched into his forehead.  MINERVA, VOLDEMORT, and GEORGE walk into frame.]
, just acknowledging they had their work cut out for them; however, he decided at the last second that it was best not to argue with his students.  Even if they were only three years his junior and had been on the team when he, too, had played (and even if he had always found them a little intimidating, if he was being truly honest).
” he shouted desperately until the hands evidently released him, and he scooted back in palpable disgust.
Harry writhed a bit under his hands, shivering away and thrusting into them all at once.  “Draco, the spell-”
The Slytherin common room was nostalgic.  He’d been there, of course, since coming back to Hogwarts – many times, given the Halloween escapades – but there was something so different about sitting in the old armchairs with the express purpose of relaxing.  It brought back memories of countless nights when he’d stretched out next to his classmates with his feet up on the table and had the audacity to be

like Harry was feeling him out, so he put that one back on the list of possibilities.  “Harry, you can’t expect me to believe you Apparated us away from a reporter in the middle of the street without having any thoughts on what you want to tell the press.”
As soon as they returned to the room, Draco was all over Harry – lips pressed to lips, bodies flush against the door.  Harry’s robes were still drenched from the spell, and he laughed hoarsely against Draco’s mouth before pushing him slightly away.
.  In fact, I’ve been meaning to find a time to chat with Harry.”  She turned to the man in question.  “Is it alright if I call you Harry, dear?”
[Cut back to a close-up of SEVERUS, narrowing his eyes as they walk away.  A montage of cake-rolling follows in which GINNY curses over two large cracks splitting down her confection and leaking cream onto the table.  SIRIUS BLACK laughs with the emcees in the background while the camera shifts its focus to the table on which his carefully-constructed sugarwork is sliding off the icing with a pointed sense of foreboding.  NYMPHADORA TONKS puts the final fondant bat on her goth-punk yule log, smiling as FRED calls time.  We jump once again to the judging: SEVERUS stands in front of a stark, plain roll with no decoration other than the black frosting coating it.  VOLDEMORT and MINERVA exchange a knowing glance before cutting into it.]
His hair was truly awful today.  It would have even brought a laugh to Draco’s lips had he not been so panicked.
He met her piercing gaze and found himself nodding in disbelief.  “I won’t!  I mean, really – I promise.”  Could it really be that easy?
They retired to McGonagall’s office, which opened to the surprising password of “Well done is better than well said.”  After taking a seat across from her, Draco couldn’t take the pressure any longer and spoke.
Harry scowled spectacularly.  “Yeah, ha ha very creative.  If anything, the fact that you made those buttons proved that back then
VOLDEMORT: Alright, in third place… [he walks in front of DRACO’s and gestures with both hands in the mechanical way that has launched internet conspiracies over whether or not he’s a cyborg from outer space] this one.  Whose is this?
“Like that, Potter?” he growled, praying to Merlin that he did.  Because, even after two hits, he could feel the addictiveness of it all set in; he felt the rush of physicality as his hand swung into the hit, the utter satisfaction of watching Harry’s body jerk and absorb it.  The quiver of Harry’s skin as pain faded into prickling pleasure.
“You look…good,” Harry said, eyeing him up and down once he opened up the door.  Draco did the same – but more discreetly – and bit back the flush rising to his cheeks at the compliment.  Harry was dressed in a comfortable-looking jumper and a pair of dark-wash jeans that looked so becoming on him that Draco immediately went on the defensive.
A warm sense of relief was washing over him, stark in its contrast.  Harry was serious about him.  What they had – it was real.
[Cut to the tent, where bakers are slamming their doughs into the pastel fridges to cool.  Time has been very crunched up to this point, but they now have a rare moment of respite before starting their fillings.]
But there was that tiny, senseless voice in the back of his mind that nonetheless wondered “what if?”  He hated to admit it, but a shamefully significant portion of him still believed that Harry could do anything.
cautious about dosing with experimental potions, as it would undoubtedly make the biggest headline if anything ever happened.
it.  His hand was totally numb to the touch.  “Hey, it’s okay.  You don’t have to forgive him.  It’s okay.”
By the time Draco returned to Hogwarts that evening, he was doused in misery and a sense of hopelessness that sounded like his slow steps across the grounds.  Even a year after disowning Draco for being gay, his father still seemed to be in denial that it was true.  He treated Draco’s sexuality as both a choice and a
He filled both his hands with a catalogue of Harry’s flesh, murmuring, “Alright?” as Harry squirmed at the unfamiliar sensations.  The man nodded, and Draco situated them back until they both stretched comfortably down the bed.
But before Draco could do something self-destructive like make fun of Harry for it, he felt the other man pulling his hand from his face.  Harry gripped Draco’s hand between his palms like he was warming it, and it felt so nice that he twisted and interlaced their fingers together.  It felt a bit like his lungs had expanded and made his chest overfull.

“Good,” she replied, nodding.  Then, glancing over her shoulder, “That will be all for you, Missus Malfoy.”
He tried not to think about it, but throughout the day, his thoughts kept circling back to how oddly Potter had acted, and that flush upon his face that must’ve been fever, the more he thought about it.  But even if
Since the incident, Malfoy seemed to have gotten over whatever sympathy he felt for Harry too, as he’d been more infuriating than ever.  In the middle of tactical lectures, he would find Malfoy watching him—but whenever their gazes met, Malfoy’s face would morph into a smirk.  A smirk that told Harry he had lost, that Malfoy had beaten him in a game Harry had invented quite by accident.
His vision tunneled in arousal.  “So eager,” Draco muttered, adding a second finger once Harry began rocking himself back rhythmically onto the first.  He leaned up by Harry’s ear, deciding in that split second to try something.  “
“We have no way of knowing.  It could be less than a year, it could be as much as five or ten.  The only thing we know is that it’s affecting his magical core and strength, so the full extent of his lifespan is lost to him.”  For a wizard, that could be upwards of two hundred years, so the loss was significant – if not immediate.
“Alright, but who’s going to tell them that, if they’re just walking through the dungeons like it’s a haunted house?” he asked.
Her and Potter had about as much chemistry as Draco and a hippogriff), but that had only served to make it funnier.  As he read it, he had imagined the growing look of outrage on Potter’s face with each subsequent section.
But her disapproval had been dwarfed, even then, by Draco’s wonder at having spent another night with Harry.  Another blessed night – as if it was going to become a regular thing.  And his tentative, explosive hope at the prospect really should have foreshadowed the storm that was coming his way.
because he’d lived with the Dark Lord.  He could possibly attempt the reverse and perform a basic Legilimency too – but that was useless by way of healing magic.
Harry stood up defensively spreading his arms and making himself larger, like a bear protecting its young, although Harry is obviously more of an otter, “Shut your mouth! I was just getting the hang of things then. And for your information, it didn’t help that you were always distracting me, Pretty Balls.”
Harry smiled slightly, the tension of their argument fading into the good humor of the conversation.  “It’s okay, you’ve
“Perhaps I should go,” Mother said, her voice sounding miles away.  Vision still tunneled, he barely registered Harry nodding and his mother gathering her things before stepping into the Floo.  “I am sorry, Draco.”  Her eyes caught on his, slightly glistening.  “Please come talk when you’re ready.”
He wondered vaguely if Morpheus would notice his absence; the man lived above the shop, after all.  But if he had, he hadn’t said anything – not yet, anyways.  Draco didn’t particularly care either way, but if he could avoid a confrontation for the time being, he certainly would try.  The man was unpleasant even in amiable circumstances, so Draco couldn’t imagine how the man would act if he actually did something wrong for once.
“You like that, Harry?”  he couldn’t help asking, gratified when Harry only managed to bite his lip and nod.  “Fuck,” he repeated, falling back to Harry’s neck with reckless abandon.
in his general direction, which the man only narrowly dodged.  When he didn’t have the immediate satisfaction of watching leeks sprout from Potter’s ears, he burst out, “You absolute git!  You filled in the entire page with utter nonsense!”
” Harry spluttered, looking around to make sure none of his followers were about.  “And I really am bad at it.”
“And what do you feel?” Draco asked, heart rate spiking – in anticipation or empathy, he couldn’t tell.
one to have Harry like this – to touch him readily, like he had permission.  To lead him stridently onto a path which he would trust.
His hands paused over a sleek grey suit he hadn’t found much occasion to wear.  He’d gotten it in a rare splurge at a Muggle shop back when he thought that Quidditch might drive him out of the Wizarding World altogether, but in the end, he had endured – the way he’d endured the many places and people who’d caused him suffering before.

The elf regarded him with narrowed eyes for a long moment, finally murmuring something about “having heard of Mister Potter’s affinity for snakes, yes,” but also of “sneaky Slytherins would ought to stay out of the Kitchens in the future.”
Harry smiled sincerely and moved closer to him on the couch.  “You’re so difficult.  I lo-” he cut off, continuing rapidly with, “
Okay, so I messed up some of my timestamps for the jumps to Draco's past, and I SINCERELY apologize.  I did bad math the once, and then it messed up the subsequent ones as well. 😱😱😱  So if you noticed the timeline was bad and were just too polite to say anything, know that I am suitably ashamed of myself and have gone back to correct past chapters.  Therefore, the "1 year, 3 months earlier" sections that appear in this chapter are following the ones from previous chapters in sequence.

Draco could see the fine fissures where Potter’s lips were chapped.  They were parted slightly and full; they were only six inches away.  He ached to kiss them wet and soft again.
Harry blew out a sigh of relief before he started shifting uncomfortably on the floor.  Realizing that his knees must be hurting him, Draco pulled him to his feet.  Harry leaned in for another kiss, and Draco couldn’t stop himself from being an arse and asking, “What, can I help you with something?”
[They taste each of HARRY’s rugelach, pausing to praise each of his unusual combinations.  The camera flashes to DRACO’s face in the background, becoming steadily more annoyed.  He puts his head in his hands when they reach HARRY’s final rugelach – the wild strawberry one, bound for failure – and have only nice things to say.]
Was this a result of their Quidditch match?  But they had played matches since they were kids; as much as it pained him to say, Potter knocking him off his broom was nothing new.  Perhaps the man had finally deciphered the latent desire in Draco’s gaze – though, given his track record with these kinds of things, it didn’t seem likely.
Draco sidestepped it automatically.  “Really?  The jelly-legs jinx?”  His smugness was completely automatic, but it caused the pleasant side effect of Potter scowling fiercely and casting a quick disarming spell in succession – which he dodged as well.  “Surely you can do better.”
“Why would I fire you?” she continued.  “You’ve performed wonderfully so far as a flight instructor, and the students all like you.  I would be out of my mind to get rid of someone like that in the middle of the semester.  Do you think I

“I can’t say I’ve really had the chance to practice much,” Draco said carefully, apprehensive about where this was going.
He let Ron wax poetic for a little while about all the “great tips,” before finally steering them back on track.  By the end of the tangent, he felt no wiser to the ways of seducing men than when he started; he supposed most of the advice in the book was rather general mandates like “don’t be a dick to the one you love.”  Which, while true, was not the groundbreaking revelation to Harry that it had been to teenage Ron.
And hell, if Draco’s heart rate didn’t spike at the combination of “boyfriend” and Harry glancing bashfully at him right after.  Harry seemed to be waiting for him to say something – to clarify their relationship, maybe – but as long as Harry wasn’t opposed, Draco swore on his life he wouldn’t correct him.
VOLDEMORT: You’ve done well today, Draco.  I can’t say I was expecting it, but it seems like you learned an important lesson at a very opportune time.  [He glances fleetingly over at HARRY, and DRACO follows suit with a nervous gulp.]
didn’t seem to realize that he was being had – and if he did, then he certainly wasn’t following the right venues to resolve the matter himself.
But, of course, these moments were only temporary.  In the back of his mind, folded carefully under layers of Occlusion, lay his thoughts of his father and what they might mean.  Thoughts that were too often dragged to the surface by well-intentioned urgings by Harry, of all people.
When he realized he wasn’t going to win this fight, Draco drew the two vials from his inner pocket reluctantly.  “For the record, I think this is a bad decision, and you’re a stubborn idiot for making it.”  He uncorked the vials, feeling grim.  “You’re getting one drop of each – the
“They might do something like this.” Harry unzipped his trousers and pulled down his pants. His dick stiffly flopped out, slapping him in the lower abdomen. His dick throbbed longingly as he sunk his tip into the pudding cup, resting it atop his cock like a helmet. Pudding ran down the sides of his thick shaft as pleasure pulsed through his eight-inch member.
“Er, Ginny, I… I mean…”  Harry scrambled to tuck away his still-softening dick.  The wet leather of his trousers made the task almost impossible.

CEDRIC: Of course.  I’ve decided to make two separate doughs to go along with my two different sets of rugelach – one sweet and one savory.  My savory dough is going to be seasoned with black pepper and parmesan, and the filling is going to be a homemade traditional pesto.  For my sweet one, I find that taking inspiration from the flavors that would typically be used in ‘baklava’ works really well – so I’m doing a honey and walnut filling, and then adding little bits of honeycomb to the dough itself.  When I’ve practiced it at home, I’ve always had biscuits to spare.
A surge of annoyance crossed Harry’s face, but he blew it away with a sigh.  “Yeah, whatever.”  It seemed to diffuse the tension a bit, because Harry moved back over to sit with Draco again.
It was fine – Harry could keep his secrets.  Draco knew more than anyone how it felt to have them pried from you.  But something in him whispered that it wasn’t the confession that seemed to make Harry panic.  Rather, it seemed something he was afraid to
Hope everyone is well, and thanks for reading!  Your comments on this story and TNFI really do inspire me to keep working (on a defined and consistent basis)!
But if there was one thing he and Granger had always had in common, it was being insufferable know-it-alls.  He could see Weasley’s eyes glazing.
Draco’s lips curled into a smirk as he realized he might be the first person Harry dared sharing this with.
At that, Draco couldn’t help but cross his arms and shake his head in awe of how incredibly oblivious his partner was.  This was “
.  He’d have to tread carefully.  He’d reaffirm his mental rule that he wasn’t to touch Potter – one he’d gotten dangerously close to breaking last night.  If Potter was interested, then he’d have to come to
“So you’re…gay?”  And the look on Harry’s face was so forcedly casual that Draco nearly burst out laughing.
After his mother’s unwelcome visit, it was only another two days before Draco snapped and checked with the elves.  He hadn’t gone down to the Kitchens much growing up – he’d been far too wary of detentions for that – but it hadn’t stopped Blaise from sneaking down for snacks late at night.  So, intentionally or not, he knew exactly how to tickle the pear portrait to open up the door, and when the elves took immediate notice and asked him what he needed, he knew better than to be surprised.
with Draco’s plight – certainly not that – but he really got a kick out of reminding him of his pitifulness.  He gave Draco a job in the back – one with a paltry salary – brewing potions where customers couldn’t see.
The unwavering sense of hopelessness could not be shaken by his obsessive focus, nor could he abuse his body enough for it to forget.  He was trapped – trapped in his own skin, a place he’d learned in the war was a terrible place to be.
Harry’s eyes flew to Malfoy, who was watching him with obvious surprise, but also a hint of that inscrutable expression he’d been wearing last night at the party.  Their eyes met for an uncomfortable instant, and Harry all but darted his gaze away.
“Better than…usual.”  Harry laughed awkwardly, hoping came off as self-deprecating rather than self-conscious.  If it was self-deprecating, then it meant he could handle a harsh reply.  If it was self-deprecating, then Malfoy wouldn’t see he was stupidly invested in his opinion.
After a few moments, Harry opened his eyes again.  At their bewilderment, Draco grinned.  “See you after the match,” he whispered against the man’s lips before standing and turning to go.
me, Potter,” he stated, feeling cold and cutting as he said it.  “It’s not like we’re… It’s not like we’re
And Potter’s eyes kept drifting over to Draco like he, too, couldn’t quite help it.  Like he couldn’t quite believe he was actually there in his classroom, listening peaceably to him talk.  Draco could hardly believe it either, and each glance had him preening – standing a little bit straighter, grin a little bit wider – while the Savior droned on and on about wandcraft with increasing fervor.
Kat skidded through the door after Marla, eyes sparkling with the news of their discovery.  “They trapped one in the seventh floor corridor!  All the creepies hang around there.”  She sounded so excited when she said it, too, and Draco tried to hide his instinctive frown at hearing the location.
But he remained resolutely quiet as he floated a stunned bat to the bottom of the wardrobe.  He’d run into it yesterday on a nighttime walk around the grounds and had decided that it would be a suitably festive prank to play at the dawning of October.
Potter’s brow crinkled in pain, and the moment teetering on vulnerability was gone.  The precipice of possibility was gone; his face was closed off, his jaw set harshly as they stood facing each other on stagnant, level ground.
Draco froze.  “Are you okay?”  Had it been his fault – had he been pulling Harry down too hard?  He’d been keeping it fairly shallow, as that was all he really needed anyway – it was easily the best thing he’d felt in his life already.
But he found Harry smiling at him in amusement, face still flushed and sweaty as he asked, “Was it everything you dreamed of in Potions?” to which Draco could only laugh weakly into his neck.
now?  It was like he’d never had his teenage crisis about liking men in school then promptly gotten over it.
When she spoke, her voice was devious.  “I propose we beat them at their own game.  Like I said before.”
Potter’s mood shift since last night had not brought him any closer to a clear answer – if anything, it had confused him even further.
“I don’t want to be!” Potter shouted, and the words were loud and angry enough to shut him up entirely.
You thought I was skipping another week, I bet!  Well, HAH!  (Seriously though; I'm trying my hardest to stay on schedule 😭)
VOLDEMORT: What’ve we got here?  [They’re in the judging round now, and he’s come to a stop still several feet away from RON’s station.  RON goes very still.]  What’ve you done to it?
“Well, you know…” Harry started, rolling his eyes like Draco was pulling his leg.  At Draco’s unchanging confusion, he hesitantly continued.  “Because it takes your choice into consideration.”
His thoughts fell, like they sometimes did, to inquiries about Potter.  He’d heard a rumor once that the man had been forced to live in a broom cupboard.  While he doubted that was true – who would deny the
He didn’t quite believe that he was; but he decided to indulge himself by playing along.  He needed more information, and playing Potter’s game was the best way to gather it.
would write and visit more (and also try not to antagonize).  This was how it was to be in the After – after they’d become resigned to his father’s eventual decline.
But Potter merely frowned – frowned, and looked rather pensive.  “Not ‘happy,’ I suppose…but relieved?” he finally answered.
Draco was in bliss.  He didn’t think he’d even been wound so tightly before that the conclusion brought such relief.  Eyes squeezed shut, he pumped out the residual climax almost lazily, stopping only when it began to feel more like pain than pleasure.
He flipped towards the noise, but pain lanced in his stomach so sharply that he nearly passed out again.  He crumpled over, clutching his side, and it took all his energy to glance up at his present company.
, 51, 52, 53…  There’s supposed to be 54 windows on this side – where’d the 54th go?!  [He sticks a sugar glass window into the empty spot on the spire without the extra piece.]  No time to find it.
Harry clunked his forehead against Draco’s, still staring into his eyes, and whispered his answer against his lips.  “Obsessively.”
what Father thinks!” Draco exploded.  Because – really, she knew better; she could’ve just avoided that topic altogether.  “Complain to me about correspondence all you like, but I’m not going to sit here – in my own home, in my place of employment – and listen to what
“Really?” Harry managed, though inside the stall, he was engaged in a silent battle that consumed all his focus.  Draco had gone for his dick again, and Harry – in a panic – was holding him back by the hair.  Clearly furious with this tactic, Draco was pinching the sensitive skin of his inner thigh as a means of getting revenge.  “We’ve talked…sometimes.”
His eyes scanned the sparse piles of books and quills on his desk – he really needed to spruce the place up before someone came to visit.  It was the first office he’d ever had for his own, after all.
Draco felt his vision squeeze down to a single speck, located somewhere between her set chin and empathetic eyes.  His mind reeled.  Father…
He caught Harry watching and was surprised to see that the man still had enough shame left to blush.  “Fuck, you’ve done it,” he murmured, hiding his face behind a splayed hand.  “You’re killing me.  This is definitely my demise.”
[Cut to the contestants processing outside with their wonderful gingerbread constructions between them.  Rows of picnic tables are set out in the open, snowy field, and heat lamps glow interspersed amidst former contestants, friends, and family.  They break into cheers when the trio come into the light.]
“No – slaloms!  We get to do the fun dives, like a roller coaster,” a Muggleborn girl argued, which was incomprehensible to Draco.
“That’s not how it happened… I’m- I’m just sure you look ridiculous as a flight instructor, and thought it’d be funny to see it!”
had found the courage to change sides when it mattered, it didn’t mean that his parents would have been freed of the consequences.  The Dark Lord had always known it was the best way to manipulate him.
Marla’s lips curved into a contemplative frown.  “It’s not… I mean, I don’t think she even noticed.  And it’s not about that – not entirely.”
For long hours, he tried to practice his feints, but he found his euphoria matched by a terrible impatience.  He couldn’t focus; he could barely keep from clawing his skin off.  But he’d waited eighteen months to get here – he could wait another few hours yet.
VOLDEMORT: This one…is sublime.  They’re neat, they’ve got filling, they crunch, and there’s 24 of them.  They
.  That much hadn’t changed in two years - but, for once, his circumstances had.  For the first time in his adult life, Draco had been offered a glimmer of hope.
“He loves snakes,” Draco said evenly.  “Talks to them sometimes, in fact.  This will surely cheer him up.”
It reminded him of another professor who had given him a second chance - only then, he hadn’t taken it.  And the regret still swelled in his throat like a dense, dead thing.
Harry blinked at him for a moment, dumbly – likely taken aback by his easy victory.  “Really?” he asked.  “That’s great!  Do you…want me to come along?”
“—and then, instead of fighting him, Harry grabbed the ferret’s hands and pulled him into a dance!  Can you believe that?”  Ron threw an arm around his shoulder and scuffed at his hair, despite Harry’s huff of irritation.
knew about this and felt threatened enough to start a fight about it?  He knew it was petty (and probably not the best morally either), but his heart soared at the thought.
In sum, Draco was no longer the same boy who had grown up in this place.  It felt as distant as it did familiar, abstracted from him in the never-ending river of tainted memories.  And his mother’s motivations, focused as they were on mending the past, remained irrevocably alien to him.
Draco slapped a hand over his mouth to stifle the snort that erupted from him.  He cast a quick silencing charm, nearly wheezing.  Then, he put his ear back to the door.
“Or?”  Malfoy echoed, once it was clear Harry wasn’t going to continue that sentence on his own.  He raised a daring brow to go along with it.
He frowned.  If only that were true – but if it was, Potter wouldn’t run from him like he was escaping a curse.  The man was attracted to him; that much he couldn’t explain away in waves of self-deprecation.  However, the fact that Potter ran away
But a year had passed, and Draco had neither seen nor heard from him.  He’d received no angry letters demanding that Draco thank him for testifying.  No letters about the life debts.  He hadn’t caught Potter lurking when he’d ventured into Diagon Alley for a job – like he half-expected to find.  Throwing glances over his shoulder in Knockturn, he was more nervous to find
Draco sucked in a sharp breath as Harry pressed a kiss to his hip.  Encouraged, Harry began kissing along his hipbone to his abdomen, his teeth catching softly on the waistband of his pants when he reached it.
McGonagall announced the Halloween Ball at that dinner the following night, and Draco was torn between feeling proud and nauseated when she announced he would be taking Slughorn’s place.  On the one hand, it was an honor – he’d be stepping in as Head of House, a position that would reflect well on him if he performed capably.  But, on the other hand, it was a lot of responsibility to heap on a new hire whom had only interacted with first-years in the specific situation of flying class.
away!  And instead of hooking up again before then, Harry seemed to take this invitation as a reason to hold out and pleasantly endure until then.
was more than he could bear in polite company, and, quite ruffled, he found himself skating a hand up Harry’s thigh under the table.
let slip; it was so pathetically obvious.  And yet, Potter kept standing there with his too-open expression and his too-soft green eyes, eyes not meant for
from this demonstration, and Harry had only succeeded in making himself look foolish in front of his classmates – and two particularly nosy Slytherins.  Ron had been way off this time; he would have to find something else.
Maybe it had been Draco’s last cheeky comment when Ludo was drawing up his winnings, but the team under the Minister’s financial advisor, Warsnick, was flying relentlessly today.  He’d been jostled away from the snitch on three occasions now – all by players who had drifted significantly from their proper placements on the pitch – and Jameson, their Seeker, had all but kicked him in the face on his last fly-by.
of them aloud would make him self-conscious, so he tried to choose the most mundane, “let’s see… ‘I can’t drive,’ ‘I can’t cook,’ ‘mushrooms are friends,’ ‘sitting is hard’…yeah.  But I can make you a different one if you want!”
Grant had a firm grip and a commanding presence that Draco tried his best to view as attractive rather than overbearing.  He was gruff and expectant, and he’d developed a habit of waiting as long into their hookups to heal Draco as he could.  It’d started with something small – just a bruise on his side that Grant had forgotten and that Draco had reasoned he merely hadn’t seen.  The next time, it’d been the hungry look in his eye as he ran his finger over a scrape on Draco’s cheek before healing it; he’d realized
Hannah blinked a few times following the rant before shaking her head and responding.  “Wow.  That’s…”
HARRY: So to start, I’m doing a honeyed apple one for Rosh Hashanah.  Then, I’m doing a savory lox and cream cheese one for Yom Kippur, topped with capers.  Next is a lemon and heart of palm one in honor of the etrog and lulav at Sukkot.  Moving along to Purim, I’m planning a sweet poppy seed filling like would traditionally be used in hamantaschen.  For Passover, I’m planning an egg salad filling that incorporates horseradish to represent the meal at the Seder.  And, finally, I’m doing one with freshly-harvested fruit for Shavuot.  I couldn’t find too many wild fruits this time of year, so I’m actually just going to be using some wild strawberries I found along the roadside and seeing what I can throw in to up their flavor.
Draco reclined reading a potion recipe book on creating different flavored lubes while Harry scribbled down his illegible lesson plans, close-fisting a crayon. Harry looked up for a moment from his chicken scratch to ask Draco a question.
When he reached the gryphon statue after dinner, he intoned “punctuality is key” a few times, until he heard the telltale click of McGonagall’s sensible shoes behind him.
“Why?”  Now, he was genuinely curious.  What had bothered the Savior of the Universe enough to ask around and find him?
“How’d you know?” Harry asked, once he surfaced – reluctantly – from the embrace.  He could vaguely hear the cheering of his friends in the background.
He had decided all that, he really had – but then, of course, he received a new and fascinating snippet of information from Hannah that afternoon when she found him moping in the library.
This time, he hit Harry’s other cheek, loving the way his brown skin flushed darker where he left his mark on him.
The line of his neck was so fucking gorgeous; his hair, only partially wet from the spray, clung to his temples distractingly.  Merlin, only
His next idea didn’t come to him until he stumbled upon Peeves tormenting several first years in the first floor corridor.  He was showering them with a maelstrom of parchment that seemed to have spilled from one girl’s bag, and it wasn’t until after Draco had spelled it all back to rights that he realized the opportunity.
When he finally was down to the hilt, Harry moaned loudly with pleasure. As Draco pumped slowly and powerfully from behind, he reached around to stroke Harry’s cock. On all fours, Harry couldn’t hold it back any longer. He came all over the bed, tightening his sphincter around Draco’s smooth cock. The tightness made Draco cum, shooting load after load into Harry’s hole. Draco pulled out, aimed his wand at the mess and said, “
.  He fucked Draco deep into his throat with soft little gasps, clawing at his legs like he wanted more.  He certainly didn’t look like he
In answer, Harry leaned forward to catch his attention.  “Can I touch you yet?” he asked.  His messy hair fell in unruly curls across his forehead, and Draco forced himself to be present.
for the girl.  He, more than anyone, knew the pain of a one-sided crush.  “Never mind.  You all should go check out the Ball.”
They hit the ground in a messy pile, and the impact was enough that Draco felt nothing for the first few seconds, followed by a rush of feeling
looking.  He’d been ignoring it as best he could, but the stares were beginning to stick as people noticed something unusual going down.  From across the room, he heard Kat’s delighted, “See, I
,” Draco groaned, letting his head thunk forward onto the library table.  “Just kill me; I can’t deal with this.”
But, unable to handle the silence, Harry went on to add, incomprehensibly: “I’m sorry if I’ve caused problems with your family.”
They will see this as a declaration of war on ‘peace of mind!’  They will set psychological traps for each under the guise of ‘spooky fun’ – and the faculty will not be immune to these dark machinations!”
He smiled.  “Well, Marla, the reason I called you here is that I’ve been doing some reading for you.”  He gestured to the stack of books on his desk, ranging from theoretical anthologies to queer coming-of-age paperbacks that he’d mixed in to keep it a shade lighter.  “I think these would all be helpful for you to read, if you’re up to it – this isn’t an assignment, so obviously what you choose is up to you.”
him, and they hadn’t even begun.  Draco hated that.  He needed to know what Potter was thinking; he needed to know what he could do to fix it.  He didn’t want to believe that this meant nothing to the man in front of him, when it meant everything to him.
His thoughts were still lost in a swirl of Harry’s intentions.  Perhaps, like a complicated arithmancy problem, he could solve it with enough dogged effort.
There were no secrets to keep him skulking; no pursuers to run from in the night; no obvious, important fanfare to occupy his time.  So what could he be
hundred.  They were an exclusive series of dragon hide.  Antipodean Opaleye.”  Something clicked in his mind, and he drew back a fraction.  “And I’m surprised you knew that.”
Draco flipped idly through the book.  He had read it, of course, when it had come out.  It may have felt a bit pitiful to set down at the register in Flourish and Blotts – he distinctly remembered purchasing a whole stack of books on that day to divert attention from that particular title – but he hadn’t been able to resist.
which had margins packed with crayon-penned commentary and critique seemingly addressed straight to Tolkien himself. In the inside cover, in pink crayon, had been written ‘Lily Evans, Age 8’ with an address for a place named Spinner’s End. A map had informed her this was somewhere above Nottingham.
Hermione sighed, “Honestly. Just rip the plaster off.” She looked at Ron dead on, “Harry is a time-traveller.”
Harry shrugged, running a hand roughly through his hair. The two men’s eyes alighted upon the gesture.
Luna plucked a Ravenclaw-blue record up with her fingers nimbly and shook it lightly at Draco. “This is a record, it has all the actual music on it. When you put the record on the player and then put the needle down, it spins and that makes it play music.”
They both looked at him horrified, then at each other with comic disgust, “Harry?” Hermione exclaimed with disbelief. “In what world?”
It was early may and they had been generally taken up with revising for exams (“I didn’t have to do them last time.” Harry had said with a pout. “Yeah, but last time you had to fight a dragon, so.” Ron had pointed out, which had shut him up.) or revising dark necromantic rituals. It was an odd mix. But fitting for them.
Hermione laughed exasperatedly and grabbed a chair, pulling it over so that it was positioned in front of the door. She plopped herself down on it and gestured for Harry to do likewise. He just stared at her warily. “Don’t worry Harry. I’m not a death eater or a vampire or whatever else it was you were convinced Professor Vance was. But no, sorry. There isn’t actually a boggart in here”
After the Easter holidays Hermione wrote a featured article for the Oracle about the cruel practices of magical-animal slavery across what she called 'The corporate wizarding world'. In it she referenced Gringotts and its poor Dragon five times. It caused a humanitarian outcry in the school population and went on to be picked up by the prophet itself, with Hermione smiling smugly the whole time.
“So that’s what you’ve been doing at the burrow.” Neville surmised. The Weasley’s had been surprisingly reticent in their visits that summer.
In one story the boy isn't born. His mother bleeds out only a few weeks in. He is hardly here at all. His mother has another baby. Black hair, hazel eyes. A girl.
It was true. It was widely known that Pansy had been groomed to take over from Iphigenia and Kassandra when they graduated, with Ginny Weasley as her second in charge.
“Yeah,” Hermione said drily, “Just think, if we were older, we might have had to watch Harry blunder his way through the competition.”
Ron and Harry were behind them, because they’d been left to pull the cart quickly off of the tracks and into the side shadows of the cavern they’d all stepped into. The Goblin inside had been imperiused, something Harry apparently knew how to do, and forced to follow along behind them.
He wondered desperately, as he had before, why the fourth member of the odd quartet had not been allowed into the inner circle.
“Because I want to know what you’re up to. I’ve wanted to know all year” The other two exchange a weighted look. Ginny hesitates “And because I can help. I’m a better witch than people think”
“No, she’s excited,” Harry said, his own voice verging on joyful, “I’m telling her I’m going to set her free.”
“He didn’t vanish” Harry hissed scornfully “He just turned into a bloody rat again. What’s the point of trying to keep everyone safe if I—” Harry cut himself off, looking disproportionately frustrated. Luna exchanged a glance with Ginny who was next to her. Hermione lay a comforting hand on Harry’s knee.
Harry tapped the parchment with his wand, muttering something. Then he unfolded the parchment- it seemed larger and Luna could see that ink was scrolling itself across the yellow page.
They watched as a brown haired boy named Neville saves the world, and they cheer for him and turn back to their living.
They’d been told that morning at breakfast what the first task would be, after the champions and been led away that was.
ha ha ha! remember when i said i'd have this done by christmas? well merry christmas you filthy animals and have chapter 3 i guess lmao.
That had been when they’d spotted it. About half a mile before the Thief’s downfall there was a small ridge carved into the side of the stone-face.
When she glances up, she sees Draco staring at her warily. She smiles at him widely. Unfortunately, she’s been chewing liberally on her quill for the last ten minutes and so the smile is rather bluer than intended.
Draco limped home that night, consumed by a kaleidoscope of emotions that overwhelmed him until he shut down.  Apathetic, he burst through the shop’s front door, not even caring to do it quietly.
As always, Harry spotted Malfoy right away, laughing and looking delicious in the corner with his cronies.
He turned and sped away, leaving Draco befuddled and utterly at a loss with two partially finished breakfasts in front of him.
Then, two things happened at once: the snitch was caught in the game overhead, and Draco realized he was holding the Green Flash in his distracted grip.  Before he could even appreciate the artful lines of its aerodynamic body, Bagman was clapping him on the shoulder and saying something alarming like, “You’re up.”
“You don’t need my help for that,” he said, grinning.  Hell.  Now that he’d said it, he’d have to stand by it.  He rested a hand on Harry’s head, wending his fingers through the messy black curls.  Tugged on them slightly.  “Now, are you going to be a good little Gryffindor and suck my cock?”
Potter’s recoiled, expression shuttering, brows drawing together in defensive fury.  “Well maybe if you weren’t such a git yourself, you’d have more people worrying about you!”
going to be Potter.  As many times as he’d fantasized, it had been an impossibility from the beginning.  And if it wasn’t going to be Potter, he reasoned, then it might as well be
“So, did I steal you from your sweetheart back there?” Fenn asked, sliding into the seat next to him.
He was gratified when she swatted him with a roll of parchment, lip twitching even more dramatically.  “Don’t be insufferable, Mister Malfoy.  I hear you came to ask a favor.”
But he needn’t have worried about showing too much emotion, as Harry was clearly wound up in his own thoughts.  “Yeah,” he murmured, taking a sip.  “I just wish there was something more I could do for him.  There are only so many times I can say ‘it gets better’ – what if it
With a sigh, he decided it was about time to head down to the Sorting feast.  It still felt so strange to be back here as an instructor and not a student.  It hardly seemed like two years had passed since he was here, but at the same time, he couldn’t claim his childhood innocence either.  He just hadn’t expected it to hurt - to know that he could never return to those days lounging about the common room with his friends, a bright and shining future ahead of him.  Nothing would ever be the same.
Thanks to everyone for reading!  Sorry again for so much repeated dialogue; I feel like this part has a lot of scenes that are necessary to see from Draco's perspective or it'd create a weird gap in plot/emotional state.
A dark thought crossed Draco’s mind, and he let himself say it.  “I just wish he could be healthy so I could go back to hating him.”  It was the core of his tangled emotions, he realized – the ugly, hidden center.
Harry watched, enraptured.  His face was close enough for Draco to see the ring of green surrounding his pupils – but only just.  His fingers danced before him like he was still eager to grab.
He must have been standing there frozen for a while, because Harry’s next move was to repeat himself while taking Draco’s hand.  Like he might have just not heard him the first time.  “Yes.”
He smiled at the clumsy antics.  “Yes.  Tea would be lovely.”  He kicked off his shoes and slumped onto the sofa, rubbing his face several times to rid it of his perpetual scowl at the Manor.
After an outraged pause, Potter gritted out a “maybe” that sent Draco’s toes curling in delight.  He was so pitifully
He’d risked the relative peace of being ignored by his father, the only job he’d ever come to enjoy, and his own blasted
Potter worked his jaw, fighting it, trying to speak through an unmoving tongue.  His eyes were wide with surprise.
On the edge of being tipsy, Draco only had the wherewithal to smirk in response.  They were ascending rapidly now, but Harry surprised him by pulling them both into his office once they reached Gryffindor tower.  Probably since it was closer than his bedroom.
The weight on his lungs shifted suddenly, and – freed of it - he found he could push himself into a sitting position, and his hand flew to his head to rub at a particularly sore spot.  Finally, he managed to crack open his eyes.
Not that there’d be any news.  Draco had half a mind to hex her for getting his hopes up, for hyping up the romanticism of such an event as a Ball, when he knew Potter’s avoidance strategies all too well by now.  The man could barely stand to make eye contact for more than two seconds; he couldn’t even
In the aftermath, Draco rested his wand tip gently against Jameson’s forehead.  Softly.  The man blinked dazedly up at him from the ground.  In his calmest, quietest voice, Draco said, “I’m asking you again to leave.”
There were some rooms above The White Wyvern, and that was where he’d go.  The Quidditch ring had already claimed him – both in practice, and now in a more visceral, physical way as well.
“Of course.  Just because I find your antics amusing doesn’t mean I don’t sympathize with his situation.  I’d help if there’s something I could actively do.”
He sat up a bit, propping his chin on his palm and looked at her properly.  “Good heavens, whatever would compel you to do that?  If it’s worth saying, it’s worth paying for – that’s what I always say.”
He had been expecting maybe a slap, definitely a spattering of Malfoy’s undignified stuttering.  What he
Potter was acting inexplicably weird this morning, and it bothered him that he had no idea as to the cause.  First, he showed up at breakfast with dark bags under his eyes, and now he was sputtering and spilling drinks, and Draco could’ve sworn he had flinched away from him when he had reached across him for a roll.
Instead of enriching the color of the potion, the horsehair made it swirl like a maelstrom, and the steam coming out was definitely not spiraling
And it was in this vulnerable moment that Draco blindsided him with the original question.  “What was the
“It’s time for dinner,” she said simply while both of them continued to gawk and sputter at the audacity.
, and he jolted into motion, snatching a broom from the closet and heading out the doors before he did anything he regretted.  As a teacher, he had
Either way, the sex was rough and quick.  Once, when he was drunk, Grant admitted to inviting more players from losing teams because “they had more aggression to work out against him,” which always “made it more fun.”
Draco waited with bated breath until Harry chuckled lightly and said, “Err, no.  Definitely not a ‘passing fancy’ – not for me, at least.”  Then, he could breathe.
It wasn’t right to assume; he knew that.  But the interest in Potter’s eyes was unwavering, and he just couldn’t figure it out.
Draco eased the ragged pair of glasses from Harry’s face and folded them into his grip, not quite willing to let them go.  How many times had he teased Harry for these?  How many times had he drawn crude little sketches of unthinkable cruelty befalling this man – whom he had characterized only as a pair of glasses and a scar?  Though, even then, Harry had been more to Draco than that.
to have.  When their eyes had locked for the first time in two years, Draco was surprised goblets hadn’t been knocked over in a burst of wild magic.
But despite his resentment, there were good memories mixed in with the bad.  Ones that his father was party to, if not directly responsible for.  He was like a summer storm, Lucius – one where you never knew whether it was bringing a reliable rain or a savaging violence.
The elf scowled spectacularly but did eventually admit, “Mister Potter sir has been out of sorts lately…”  He gestured towards a decadent plate of linguini in a light cream sauce.  “There it is.”
Harry’s eyes widened at this barrage, and Draco forced himself to be silent.  Then, he sighed and couldn’t help making one final comment.  “I should have known…  Things would’ve been so different if you had been a Slytherin.”
He hummed his approval.  “I do like the sound of that.  Alright, Potter – I want you to tell me what kept you aroused in an empty room for the past hour.”
Draco drew his wand with only the slightest tremor of emotion belying the mask of confidence on his face.  The truth was, he
Harry sobered enough to laugh, muttering, “fair enough,” before leaning in to kiss him sweetly instead of hungrily.  It was a blissful way of passing those five minutes – one that Draco would choose any day.
He forced himself to sit in one of the armchairs, and she mimicked him in its opposite across the room.  “Are you saying that in contrast to places I’ve worked before?”  He knew it was bad manners to start a fight on a social visit – the first in a series of long months – but he couldn’t quite help it.  There were just so many unresolved issues lingering between them, the air was dense with them.
The footsteps stopped directly behind him, and the menacing little huff of laughter that sounded after sent the hairs on the back of his neck prickling.
Potter’s eyes finally flicked from the wand up to meet his.  They were shocked and narrowed and furious.
.  Why hadn’t they just continued right there, against the lockers where Harry had confessed he’d wanted Draco to keep his Quidditch gloves on next time?  Even thinking about it was enough to make him all hot under the collar again.
He hissed as he pulled up his shirt to examine his side in the mirror.  One of his ribs was definitely broken.
[Cue a montage of hands shaking and fingers slipping as the bakers cut their rugelach.  DRACO holds a protractor to the dough with one hand while he slices the circle into even wedges with the other.  HARRY eyeballs it as he cuts, and we hear several “oh shoot”s as the occasional piece comes out wildly uneven.  They roll the wedges with the utmost precision, and the montage concludes with CEDRIC popping his perfect trays into the oven.]
He was getting too attached.  He was building his hopes too high, and they would surely get come crumbling down.
Harry, clearly driven into a manic state by this reply, flipped the book open dramatically in his hands and began reading aloud:
Harry’s cheeks were still flushed, and he looked nervous, but there was no doubt when he answered, “Yes.”
Lucius had opened his mouth – to unleash more vitriol, no doubt – when Draco felt both of their wands wrenched from their grip.  Narcissa caught them deftly from the air, mouth setting in a hard line as she determined where they should go from there.  Draco cursed that he had forgotten about her – a fact she had unmistakably taken advantage of.
, and thank YOU for reading!  I had a lot of fun writing wizard-court this week (maybe there's another story in there somewhere, someday LOL).  So I hope y'all enjoyed.
MINERVA: Wonderful bake, delicate flavors.  It definitely feels like eating a baklava without the same crumbly effect of the pastry.
“Well, I sort of suspected-” he stammered, “I mean, there were rumors about why you were suddenly avoiding everyone-”
Potter’s eyes flicked towards the door, like he still had the opportunity to escape.  Like he had the
him to visit his class?  He seemed rather determined about it, in a way that both shook Draco to the core and terrified him.
The judge handed it to his mother – and his relief at seeing her reunited was only quelled by the overwhelming fear for himself.
[HARRY seems frozen by his words – either that, or his proximity – and after a minute of intense eye contact, DRACO releases him without another word and leaves.  HARRY continues to lean against the tent long after he’s gone, saying nothing – eyes distant and considering.]
Draco blinked at him in confusion, watching a new blush rise to Potter’s face.  Then, he excused himself immediately, muttering that
Perhaps it was a subconscious flattery, since Draco wanted his job.  But, perhaps it was also that he saw himself in that defensive way Slughorn carried himself.  Like he knew he’d chosen wrong at some point and would forever be working to pay off his second chance.
At that, Harry’s grip tightened infinitesimally on his hand.  “And what does that compromise entail for you?”  The worry in his voice was evident, which would have been amusing had Draco not been intimately familiar with paranoia and doubt.
The worst part about realizing that Malfoy hadn’t wanted to dance with him was finding that he, himself,
“I came to one of your classes,” Potter continued, a bit restlessly.  “I thought it’d be fitting if you came to mine.”
want to know, but, as usual, Potter only scowled and reacted defensively.  “Not really.  Anyway, aren’t you going to show me your dumb haunted house or whatever?”  He shoved his hands in his pockets and scuffed his shoe on the ground in a terrible impression of casualness that made Draco’s grin widen.
Harry sipped moodily at his drink.  He was so lost in thought that he barely noticed Ron clearing his throat several times—and only responded when his friend jabbed his sharply in the ribs.
After a short pause, Harry began to nod.  “Right.  I mean, I didn’t think you’d have volunteered or anything.  But yeah, that sucks.”
Harry tried to nod once, but the wand at his chin prevented him.  Instead of moving, though, his eyes slid closed in a wave of startled pleasure.
Draco started unbuttoning his shirt, able to remain more composed without Harry’s hands drawing that pitiful shakiness to his skin, like the slightest touch of kindness could break him.
”  Draco immobilized it, as the fall had jolted it into reanimation, sending it thumping wetly across the stone floor.  “How?”
It was a question that had haunted Draco for the majority of his life.  Only, with the nauseating addendum:
“I suppose,” he drawled, picking up his part once again.  “Now that I’ve gotten my shirt out of the way, so you won’t crumple it.”
However, he was disgusted by how easily he was being manipulated back into the Manor – back into their lives – simply because the timeline was vague.  But it was also serious enough that he couldn’t point it out without making an arse of himself.  Which he resented.
But Potter didn’t seem to appreciate Draco’s subtle manipulations when he arrived.  By the look on his face when he stormed across the green in an attempt to cut Draco off before reaching his students, he seemed to actually
“Potter,” he started, causing the man’s gaze to snap up suddenly to meet his.  His eyes were wide and hurt and green.
FRED: Ooh, ooh – I am!  I think I saw The Nutcracker once!  But what are you getting at, George?  That’s not the technical challenge!
Draco leaned back in his chair, enjoying the argument more than he thought he would.  It felt familiar in a way that the rest of his life didn’t.  “Why do you think, Potter?  It shouldn’t take a genius to figure it out.”  He smirked, knowing it would drive Potter crazy.  And still, after everything, he loved driving Potter crazy.  “Can ‘The Boy Who Lived’ make a simple deduction?”
But Potter still wasn’t meeting his eyes.  The man’s gaze was firmly downcast, shoulders by his ears – and leaning into his space like this, Draco realized not for the first time that he had gained a height advantage over Potter somewhere in the past few years.  It filled him with a drunken sense of accomplishment that he certainly hadn’t earned, along with the urge to press closer and cover Potter’s entire body with his own – just to see how it would fit.  Just because he could…
After leading them down the hall into the first available classroom, Draco spelled the door closed and sat Harry gently on a desk.  “Breathe, Harry.  Breathe.”  The man’s fingers remained entangled in his shirt, so he fell into a crouch beside him.  “Look at me.”
He would start by brushing off Draco’s earnest worries, then go on to politely reminding him they weren’t necessary in the first place – how presumptuous of Draco to assume anything else!  He felt his face heating in mortification – if that was the way Potter was going to be, then Draco would deny it to the end.  “I wasn’t ‘
He dragged his thumb shakily across Harry’s bottom lip, like the man had done to him only the previous night.  At the time, he’d thought he might die, and this moment was no different.  His elation was so overwhelming, he worried it might end him.
With a start, he realized all over again that his father was dying, which was the reason he was here.  It was so easy to forget, when the man said things that made Draco want to punch him in the face.  He was like a cornered snake, his father – rattling his tail and hissing as his night drew to a merciless close.
.”  He tossed the idea out there casually, like it was fodder for their banter, but nothing more.  Certainly not something he expected Draco to admit to – which was partially why he
Draco shook his head in amusement.  “Spare me.  That might be the most pathetic thing I’ve ever heard.”
Regardless of recent anger towards the man, he nearly sagged with relief.  He was far too strangled with noise to make words of his own.  If the Golden Boy could convince Flitwick to end it… He only
and then another 40k of this story to catch up so they could beta for me regularly going forward, and I am infinitely grateful 😭💕
The man shifted a bit to face him.  “Ahh, I see Bagman here hasn’t explained yet.  No surprise there.”  He swirled his drink consideringly before taking a deep sip.  “They’re no-magic games.  No wands, no healing spells, no
The man startled, blinking his half-lidded eyes fully open.  They were almost an iridescent green.  “I, er… well, why do you say that?”
And Merlin, he would’ve settled for a kiss.  He would’ve settled to ignore that fear, to extract and act on the lust, but even as the thought crossed his mind, he dismissed it.  He was too greedy to ever be satisfied with just that.
Draco yawned unfazed by Harry’s frenzied expression. “All Sam said was that we must be having lots of messy Muggle food sex, seeing as you’re half muggle and all, and then I told you he was being presumptuous, because obviously we’re not doing that.”
Draco floundered for a moment, unsure how to phrase what seemed so necessary for him to say just minutes before.  “Potter’s…not eating.”
“Shut—”  Harry flew to his feet, only to halt when he realized there was nothing he could really say to that.  After all, it was
Draco was sure he could’ve come up with a witty and clever retort to that, had another question not eclipsed that line of thought.  “So you and Ginny… are over, I presume?” he asked as neutrally as he could, hoping his depthless fear of the answer would not show.
“Nothing!” they hissed in sync.  Both were quiet for several moments while Hermione read the instructions aloud for the third or fourth time, until “everyone would just be quiet and listen.”  Then, once they had settled into the game – and Harry thought that Ron had forgotten their conversation – the redhead leaned over and whispered, “Let’s meet at the library tomorrow – I’ve got a new plan to try.”
Their former professor glared down at them, irritation playing quick and determined across his face.  “Fine,” he said at last.  “
[It cuts to CEDRIC, humming relaxedly as he stirs his dry ingredients into his butter.  The judges appear at his work station, along with GEORGE.]
He still did, honestly.  It would mean that there was a measure of normalcy to his father’s actions that sickness hadn’t had the opportunity to touch.
, don’t I?” he snapped.  He met Draco’s eyes with all the wildness of a caged ridgeback.  After a beat, he set his drink down on the table.  “Sorry, didn’t mean to yell…”
Remembering Harry’s reaction to his earlier order, Draco fisted the hair gently along his neck.  Not too tightly – just enough to show that he was still there.  Harry stiffened for a moment, and then a shiver of pleasure raised goosebumps along his spine.
Draco’s heart skipped as his thoughts fell utterly silent.  Potter’s body was mere inches from his, the man’s eyes locked steadily on Draco’s neck.  Widened slightly, like he’d realized something momentous.
Despite Hannah’s unsolicited relationship advice, Draco spent the greater part of his weekend feeling sorry for himself, and only a small portion of time practicing Quidditch moves to show to his classes.  He’d be fine though – Quidditch was the least of his worries.  One of the jobs he’d had after Hogwarts had seen to that.
“Yeah, I guess,” Harry admitted, flinging an arm over his forehead as he sank further into the couch.  “It sounds silly, I know – wanting to do something to make up for a situation that can’t be changed.  I just…don’t laugh – but with you, it all seemed so
He worked him looser before pulling his hand out and wiping the excess lube on Harry’s arse cheek.  The sight of him, messy and used like this, got Draco off more than he’d like to admit.
Merlin and Morgana, Harry was a beautiful man.  Completely naked, there was nothing for him to hide behind.
do.  He’ll learn the rest as he goes.  He swirled his drink before taking a long sip, hoping he looked calmer than he felt.  “It’s unfortunate, but you can’t save his relationships for him and be the hero.  Not this time.”
you,” Draco quipped, shocked when Harry didn’t immediately protest.  He tugged the man’s cheeks apart, tracing a finger across his rim, while Harry jolted beneath him.  “You’re so sensitive,” he breathed.
His shoe scraped on the stones of the dungeon, and he realized he’d been unconsciously backing up.  Remembered that this was a
It was the mysterious looks and mixed signals – in short, the obfuscated clarity – that drove Draco crazy.  They allowed his hopes to swell, loud and buzzing in his chest until he almost combusted.
While this story charts Draco's perspective starting from the same point as TNFI, you should definitely
“What’re you…doing?”  Malfoy asked, taking a few hesitant steps closer, like he wasn’t sure what this situation in front of him entailed nor if he wanted a part in it.
He slipped off his outer robes and hung them by hand in the closet, liking the way the routine made his restless body feel useful.  Then, he slumped down on the couch, kicking his legs up on the coffee table, and finally let himself relax.  “The visit was…tense.”
“I…”  He decided against bringing up his involvement.  Namely, that he’d promised Potter they’d start it up again

“Just a bit more, I think.  Then, it should turn a healthy lavender and emit clockwise steam wisps, if my predictions are correct.”
[The contestants are called back to the front for the final judging.  It seems HARRY and DRACO have not had a moment yet to hash things out, as they keep stealing questioning glances at one another.  In front of the tent, MINERVA holds the coveted prize cake stand, while VOLDEMORT holds a pretty bouquet.]
GEORGE: Well, that was enlightening.  It seems that more is at stake today between those two than a set of perfect biscuits.
He craved Potter’s attention more than he craved sunlight or a comfortable bed – it was an indulgence he often forbid himself from seeking, even in fantasy, under the cadaverous light of that back room.  But on days he was feeling particularly hopeless, he let himself slip into the fruitless vice.  The pain of coming down from such reveries was always acute enough to prevent its quick recurrence.
At first, Draco thought it to be his own, but then he saw the expression on Harry’s face.  Biting his lip, face screwed up with lust – he’d never seen anything more beautiful in his life.
“Good form, Marla!  Kat – just aim your broom slightly to the left, and it’ll give you a better seat for a return serve,” he called, and they turned and flew over to where he was walking onto the green.
Instead, he smirked.  “But I think, in this case, the original does it better, don’t you think?”  He swiped at his own lip with a pointed glance at Potter’s, and the man thankfully got the hint and wiped his mouth with a rough stroke of his hand.
Heyyyyyyyyyyyy everyone better be getting spooky up in here, because it's about to be OCTOBER!  (aka Halloween season!)
“Why should I help you?” he asked, leaning against the doorframe.  “After all, like you said, ‘I shouldn’t want to show my face in front of the students after yesterday.’”
Which really must’ve been the final straw, because then Draco was breaking into hysterical laughter and cursing under his breath as he tried to speak.  “Are you kidding me?  You still don’t get it?  I always knew you were thick, but this is really too much!”  Harry’s confused expression drove him on, more furiously than before.  “I’m not mad about the article,
Draco catalogued him for a moment with narrowed eyes.  “It is,” he said at last, deciding.  It felt good to have the privilege of decision.
He finished dressing with a smile, and when he ventured onto the pitch, it was with a rare sense of contentedness.
give me that look – and so it just worked out that way.  But they were really dedicated to practicing, so I didn’t even have to do much.”
that he had described - well, it was in full force, and he couldn’t fathom attempting to break it.  Or even circumnavigating it like Potter had done.
With that, Ginny blew him a kiss and turned for the door.  It clacked shut with a swift, smothering silence.
colors).  But more than that, his previous job had guaranteed his improvement.  That job weighed heavy on his mind at the best of times, but his improvement was the singular positive note from it – and what he chose to focus on.
HARRY: [confessional aside; he stares into the middle distance with a frown] I’m sorry, what was the question?
if I want to!” he yelled, slamming his hand down on the table.  For one of the first moments in his life, he saw genuine surprise color her face – and it wasn’t even an occasion he could savor.
He nearly laughed – here they were, after all these years, right back at the beginning.  Their second year duel was still so vivid in his mind: the rivalry, the excitement…  It was no different now than it had been then – though a world of circumstances had shifted.
He swallowed a sip of his drink, considering.  These kinds of questions were often more about the speaker than the person they questioned.  “I suppose I returned because there
He glanced up with surprise.  After all, he was fairly sure that the two of them had never even spoken back in school, while him and her husband had most
What if Grant was right?  He needed an ally in these games – whether he wanted to fuck them or not.  To Ludo, he was an investment, but to the others?  He was a fancy jewel: one to be collected for status or smashed.  And after his recent arrogance, he could only foresee the latter.
“Something like that,” the man said, letting loose a malicious chuckle.  “So go ahead and turn in your wand.”
life to look forward to,” he hissed.  “You, me, and Mother – all cooped up together in the house where the Dark Lord once roamed, doing
“Oof,” he grunted, struggling to find his footing (and the natural rhythm of his heart), before Harry could catch him off guard again.  Remembering himself, the man pulled off a moment later – but instead of letting go, tightened his fist around Draco’s tunic and dragged him the distance to the backside of the locker room.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, letting his fantasies run wild against the inside of his eyelids. He took a deep breath and looked at Draco. “Well, for example, you see that pudding cup over there?” His heart began to race as he walked over to the chocolate pudding and picked it up. He took out the spoon and licked it clean, letting out the quietest moan. The moan was like the volume a mouse would moan at if they were capable of making a human-like moan, so Draco didn’t really notice it.
A few of the men in the booth snorted, and Bagman squeezed at his shoulder laughingly as he answered.  “Draco, Draco – the pitch is right here!  Or, well, not a pitch, really…”  He leaned in closer, as if imparting a secret – something, Draco noted, he seemed to do annoyingly often.  “More of an…
In the background, he heard Potter belatedly rushing to strip off his clothes, and – just as he pictured – when he turned, he saw the man’s back turned to him in a precious self-consciousness.  Merlin, the smooth, brown lines of his shoulders and waist just begged for Draco to run his hands down them.
Draco was so startled by the civil contribution that he took a moment to gather himself again when Granger asked for an in-depth breakdown of the ingredients he’d been testing.  Once he was in it though, he found he couldn’t stop, and they discussed both his
.”  He yawned, settling against the doorframe with a grin he was a little too sleepy to prevent, even annoyed as he was.  “I assume this means you got my note.”
She nodded once before at last breaking her gaze.  And, after some shuffling and signing of papers, his wand was in her hand – and then, it was all he could see.  The smooth hawthorn length was so nostalgic, so perfect.  He reached out eagerly, and then he was finally holding it again, amazed at the thrum of magic that buzzed through him.
He woke long before Harry, which was to be expected.  The lovable dolt was sprawled in a frankly ridiculous position with an arm slung casually over Draco’s hip, leaving a handprint of warmth where they touched.  The bed – normally overlarge for him – felt safe and comfortable and warm.  It was the perfect place to rest and think, and Draco had a lot to think about.
Draco smiled, holding eye contact through hooded lids as he drew the carrot from the end of his fork.  He let his eyes flutter closed, wondering at the effect it would have on Potter.  If the man was imagining a less wholistic scenario, like he was.

McGonagall glanced up at him quickly, resignation fighting wearied amusement in her eyes.  “Of course.  Why
Draco slid his fingers out of Harry in a rush, fumbling to undo his belt – which had remained neatly buckled until now.  He tugged open the fly and released his cock with a groan he couldn’t stop in time.  He was past caring.
“Pssshhhhh. I know that! What fool would think Muggles talk like that! Not me, that’s for sure,” Draco tucked a torn-out page that read “Muggle slang” deeper into his pocket.
Cutting off that line of thought, he sought to undo Grant’s Quidditch leathers.  After a moment’s scrambling, however, his hands were pushed away so the man could do it himself, faster.
. It’s horrifically inaccurate.” Harry nervously eyed a half-eaten chocolate Snack Pack on his desk.
With dark bags beneath his eyes and a perpetual headache, he’d struck out into the Wizarding world for a job.
Draco watched it happening and mourned the loss even as he grasped desperately for a way to reverse it.  He opened his mouth, but was cut off by Potter.
MINERVA: [confessional aside] They call Voldemort the ‘King of Saucy Puds’ – and for good reason.  He has years of experience studying them, baking them, and tasting them.  They’re not going to get anything by him when it comes to the veracity of their bake.
.  But it seems like a yes, because she is then launching herself at him and they’re kissing, and twirling, and then breaking into choreographed dance.]
“Is that what you’ll do, my traitorous offspring?” he continued, eyes never leaving Draco.  “Sic the Aurors on me?  Get
He hadn’t gotten any further in his ponderings when Bagman’s eyes roamed the room and caught on his, quite by accident.  The alcohol from the two drinks Draco had downed seemed to sieve from his veins as he watched the man mumble something to his companion and then stand to approach him from across the room.
That, in and of itself, was rather surprising.  No one knew about his office – no one except McGonagall and now Hannah, whom he’d casually told the other day over dinner.
Inside, he gestured to a seat, raising his brow at how firmly Slughorn shut the door behind him.  “Please.”
He hated this murky mixture of emotions that swelled like liquid in his throat; he was drowning, and the only one he wanted to save him was the same insufferable scarhead who landed him in this turmoil in the first place.
They had some Treacle Fudge.  Then, Peppermint Toads.  Then, a handful of sherbet balls.  Everything was delicious, but nothing was satisfying.
HARRY: Well, Fred, I’ve got one ‘tried and true’ dough here that I’m going to use for all six of my rugelach varieties.
Draco released Harry’s shirt with a shove, laughing – despite himself – then masking it with a hand to his mouth.  “You quarrelsome
FRED: [off screen] How do you feel you went wrong today?  Do you have any plans on how to make it up tomorrow?
Kat and Marla crowed at that, clearly delighted to see a teacher admitting to being sneaky.  He’d learned, by now, that that was a secret to teaching – you just had to demonstrate that you were also human, and it made them infinitely more comfortable being imperfect in your presence.  For kids, especially, that was important.
Harry pushed himself loudly to his feet, chair screeching across the cold stone ground.  And Draco might’ve said something then, if he hadn’t felt utterly gutted by the words hanging between them.
to him.  Reading’s not his forte, unfortunately.”  He was hoping that would be enough by way of explanation, but the seventh-years were loathe to let him go; he was beginning to think he ought to have cut off their drink supply by now.
DRACO: [aside] I’ve just got one more round of trays to go, should be done in about 10 minutes.  [He checks his watch and looks vaguely sickened by what he sees.]  Make that 8.
