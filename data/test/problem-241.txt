'Fine — if you're that tired, I'll leave you alone.' The boy stood up with a sulking expression on his face but young Dumbledore grabbed him by the wrist before he could walk away.
Next thing I know you'll tell me you were spying on Madame Maxime and Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest as well!'
They had left busy London and exchanged it for the quietness with a creepy undertone of Grimmauld Place. Seated around the small table in the kitchen, they held their heads together as they discussed where the real locket of Salazar Slytherin could possibly be. Harry had discovered it had been a fake only days after Dumbledore's death; the message inside clear to any of its readers.
As Harry finally left the common room, acting as if he wasn't going on a dangerous trip to Merlin-knew-where, Draco also decided it was time for him to leave. He had been given more clear instructions from Castor that morning, after getting pushed into a dark alcove and having the blond basically shoved against him. 'Wear black tonight; and best nothing too complicated as we must flee right after our tasks have been completed,' he had said, his dull grey eyes staring into Draco's with a fire he had never seen in them before — and it had scared him the tiniest bit. 'And most of all,' Castor had whispered to him before leaving. 'Don't get seen.'
'Sorry, I just needed a way to start the story… But, did you know that there are not many Death Eaters left in Azkaban right now, as most of them died only a few weeks or months after their capture?'
he then said, looking into the twins their eyes. He could see their understanding; their love — that he hadn't meant to keep his return a secret for the two boys he cared about the most… beside from Harry of course. He then turned himself towards the others with a sigh. '
,' Harry said with still that cheeky smile upon his lips. It was the most cheesy thing the boy could've said, yet it was enough for Draco to turn a violent red and bury his face in Harry's neck to hide it.
The last few girls boarded the carriage and Draco remained the last one outside; staring at the chateau over his shoulder. Saying good-bye to it for a year hit him rather hard; he would miss every nook of the magical building. He had always preferred staying at the chateau than at home; holidays meant Pureblood lectures in a gloomy Manor.
!' Draco gave him a bright smile, one that Harry returned before yawning.
as much as Draco was. But now it was too late; and there was no-one Draco could ask for help anymore.
'Good. Well, I believe you have the most friends in Gryffindor, right?' Dumbledore then asked Draco, whom nodded his head. 'Then I now officially sort you into Gryffindor. I hope you won't mind wearing red instead of blue. If you want I can also put you in Ravenclaw—‘
Everyone agreed to Draco's words and followed him up the stairs again — Ron once again complaining about the unwanted physical activity he was being put through. As they stepped through the portrait hole, Harry's friends followed the golden footsteps in front of them that would lead them to their rooms — Draco and Harry staying behind for a bit longer. 'You're unbelievable, Draco,' the raven-haired boy suddenly told him.
Lifting his hand to wave them off — Harry was suddenly left alone in the home he had never felt welcome in. All the rooms were empty; the living room where Arthur once had bursted through the fireplace — the dining room where he had made aunt Marge float away from like a giant balloon — the kitchen where he had cooked a lot of food for the Dursleys and had gotten non of it himself — the cupboard under the stairs where he had dreamt of a better future. The door greeted him like an old friend when he turned its handle; the small room now covered with spider-webs and a few toy soldiers laying deserted on one of the shelves.
'Harry! What are you doing in my fireplace so early?' she says to him.
'I see,' Draco simply replies. He takes another sip from his tea and takes in Potter once more. The man looks a little messier than he did when walking in. His robes look more wrinkled, his hair a gigantic mess and his glasses are slightly crooked. It almost looks as if
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
. He told them that he had been under the Imperius Curse and together with generous donations and the fact that he had a newborn in his family to look after convinced every single soul that heard his speech. But of course he and
I do. And you should do so as well,' Draco told her. With those words said he rose from his seat. 'I'm going to study at the library.
"I have no clue
It was Harry who broke the silence after a few minutes. 'Can I ask you something?'
Another skip of his heart, but Harry had stopped rambling words. 'Draco,' he heard the boy say — almost whisper. But Draco shook his head, afraid Harry would start with his questions again the moment he would open his eyes and uncover his ears. 'Draco,' Harry repeated, and this time the boy's strong hands lowered Draco's. Hesitantly the French opened his eyes as well and looked straight into Harry's emeralds; surrounded by specks of bright red. His whole face was covered with it as if he had become a Weasley; covered in freckles. But it weren't freckles at all — it were spats of blood that had escaped from Draco's mouth as he had told Harry to stop. 'D-Draco,' Harry now stammered for a third time — this time with a great worry readable on his face as the boy stared at his own hands that were covered in red spots as well.
He kissed him again, and again, and
,' he answered, letting out a long breath before collapsing into Ansel's arms. 'Hold me for I can no longer stand of exhaustion.'
'Don't you sometimes want privacy then?' Draco asked as he took a step closer to Harry, invading his personal space just the tiniest bit.
, he thought to himself as a smile appeared on Draco's face.
'Yeah, I'm alright — just tired,' the boy answered while picking up a few branches. 'Are you?'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Potter is silent at that and Draco decides to continue.
'I'm just a little hungry, alright? Can't Madame hurry up already?' he responded with a sigh.
And so he did. The clear substance with tiny sparks of gold disappeared down Harry's throat — and for a second if was dead silent. Draco stared at Harry with big eyes, waiting for something to happen or for him to say anything. 'How — how do you feel?' he eventually asked.
Wizards were readying themselves for an upcoming battle, and Harry knew Draco was hungry to help along. 'You want to go help them?' he asked.
Harry's emerald eyes stared into Draco's silvers and it made his heart skip a beat; something the boy had already done too many times. He gave Draco a nod and seemed to wait for more words Draco didn't have. Well maybe, he had, but he couldn't talk about it in the presence of his friends. ‘Harry, can we talk for a second?’
With a small nod she disappears out of the room and returns a minute later with Ron on her heels. They both sit back down on the couch, eagerly waiting for what Harry's going to say. Rose makes an anticipating sound as well; as if she's also ready to hear an exciting story.
It was soon enough though that their blue, silk robes got stained with blood and dirt. Their hats fell off, their hair loose. The twins were staying close to Draco’s side, blasting curses together with him — joining their power. They looked older as well all of the sudden — as if they had aged with ten years since Draco had last seen them. The tears he had felt coming before he felt again — but he swallowed them away and kept his mind focused.
The note had simply read;
But Harry Potter didn't seem to mind; he put on a shy smile and scratched his head. His hair was a gigantic mess; a bird's nest even more tidy than that. 'I'm afraid I am… And you are?' his reply called.
‘There are also a lot of things that I
want to be friends with Harry again, even though he wasn't entirely sure if their friendship had ever even ended. Perhaps one could compare it to the small break-up Harry had with his best friends. Would the boy see it that way as well? For the first time in probably ever, Draco didn't have the courage to go over to the boy himself and ask.
His mother's words twirled around in Draco's head and confused him. Those words made it sound like the mother he knew again — but with an undertone of his father. 'We can make up for that mistake in a good way; in the
a beautiful animal on the outside but very stressed on the inside. Just like me,' Draco explained with a sigh.
Another red flare; this time even more violent was fired at Harry — but casted off with the perfect Protego spell. Draco decided to whisper a few protection spells of himself that would create a shield around him and Harry; that would protect them against any kind of curse that Bellatrix would try to fire at them. But as he was so busy doing just that, he almost didn't catch the woman herself transfiguring back into her smoke-like self and floating off in the direction of the Burrow.
Harry had turned himself to Draco again and had a look in his eyes Draco couldn't quite decipher.
As soon as he sets foot on the soil of the Manor's gardens, he feels the cold of the morning rush over his body — sending shiver and making the arms on his body stand aright. He acts like there is nothing wrong with his arm nor hand, and feels a gust of wind dance past his fingers. The wind escapes through the roses, and returns again a few seconds later. Closing his eyes, he thinks about his time before Hogwarts.
, he keeps saying to himself when waking up from the nightmare.
But Draco didn't know what to say; he wanted to tell Harry the truth of why he was there and what he had been given as a task — but he couldn't. He could feel the curse burning on his tongue; the slight taste of blood as the words were waiting to be spilled. 'If you wait just a second, mister Potter, I will explain everything. Will you please take a step back,' professor McGonagall commanded with a glare of her eyes.
'Why don't you take a seat over there while I get us some drinks, alright?'
It also wasn't as if Draco himself went unnoticed; he got approached multiple times by both girls and boys. A group of Hufflepuff girls had been following him on his way to the library, asking wether he already had a date. Draco had answered with a simple
They laid Harry in one of the bunkbeds the magically enlarged tent held, and tucked a few pillows under his head. Noticing how much the boy was sweating; Draco took his jumper off to replace it with the coolness of a thin blanket. 'He's having a fever,' he announced as he placed a hand on Harry's forehead.
Harry seemed surprised by Draco's appearance and gave him a questioning look with his emerald eyes. 'Hello, Draco,' he replied, pulling the hood of his hoodie a little straighter.
'But — but he needs help,' Harry said, glancing at Draco who still seemed to be in a lot of pain.
You will have to fight a dragon but that's all I know. B-but it's really late and I should go now
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
almost. It's like he's getting hypnotized by a studying Potter.
, but only this once!’
Catching for breath he'd not been able to breathe during the short moment, Harry let his head hang. "What was that?" he asked, slightly afraid to look at Draco once more.
'Can't I write under my father's name; James?' Harry proposed.
'Got it!' it then sounded, and Harry dived down from the pile, the sword of Gryffindor held up in his hand like a trophy. Not wasting a second longer between the objects of gold, Draco pushed open the vault's door again, letting the items stream outside and fall down the stairs with a lot of noise. Clattering down. The goblin still stood where they had left him, a blank expression on his face, even when a goblet hit him on the shoulder.
busy and not in the mood to answer any questions. Pushing through anyway, the duo managed to get all the information they needed; or at least, the information they could have access to.
Following Dumbledore out of the Great Hall, he felt all students' eyes on him and Harry whom was trailing behind them. What were they thinking? Were they thinking about his father being a Death Eater? About their failed love? About the boy from the tales being crazy? It could be anything and it probably also was. He heard a muted chatter start again once they passed through the doors, one that got silenced only a second later by a professor's voice.
Slowly, Lucius shook his head. 'You are indeed still a child, I see,' was all he had left to say, before turning around and leaving Draco's room.
‘What about this one? A curse that causes ink to spread throughout one’s body and stay there permanently?’ Potter interrupts on his thoughts.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
, Draco thought to himself as yet another boy ran away from him without even asking anything at all.
Dudley's friends ran away, afraid of the sudden turn of nature and Harry lowered his wand out of confusion; and out of fear. He knew what this feeling, this cold could be caused by — but he couldn't believe it. 'What have you done?' Dudley demanded, blaming Harry for whatever was happening.
'And not only the story of your scar,' Ansel added to his brother's words with a wink.
And so we only stayed in France during summer holidays and went back to the cold Manor in England for
A wind blew in Draco's face, sending a cold shiver down his spine. He was wearing the dark robes again, his wand given back to him and tucked into his left sleeve. Harry took out the invisibility cloak from his father, gestured for Ron to come closer to him. 'Alright,' Hermione then announced with a deep sigh. 'Ready?'
It takes a moment for Harry to process everything that's going on.
'I know of your task,' the boy had answered. 'As I have one as well, you see.' Draco had frown his eyebrows. Didn't only the Dark Lord and his mother know of his task? How was it that a boy the same age as him knew about it as well? 'And I know you can't talk about it to anyone. Just know my task has to do with yours; and therefore we should help each other.'
like it.
He leaned a bit closer to Harry's face. 'Take a guess, as you are so good at guessing.'
'Do you really have to wake up me up in the middle of the night for that? Tell me about it tomorrow for as I want to get at least some sleep.' Another yawn from young Dumbledore followed and a sigh from the other boy in return.
Draco eyes widened. 'You're getting closer,' he told Harry. 'But, let me just show you.' The blond boy turned himself towards the lake and drew his intricate golden wand from his coat's pocket. Harry noticed for the first time that at the end of its handle, a blue sapphire was shining brightly. 'Expecto Patronum,' Draco shouted and out of his wand came a blinding silver animal. Harry screwed up his eyes to see what creature had escaped from Draco's soul.
physical before, it was just that Draco hadn't really felt like having a
A little silence followed before his mother opened her mouth again, struggling to find the right words. 'There is something I must tell you, Draco. Perhaps you should sit down,' she said as she gestured towards the chair beside her.
. Glaring at Draco as if he just ate something terrible and is dying to spit it out, right in Draco’s face. The Weasel himself looks still the same as during his Hogwarts days; too tall, red hair too bright, too many freckles and probably hand-me-down Auror robes.
,' he concluded. 'You can celebrate that; but not for too long, alright? You all have classes tomorrow.'
Draco couldn’t agree as he hated, even
'Well well,' she then said.
'Out,' he said, but Harry had no plan to leave.
‘You don’t know the exact reason why it has that shape? What caused it?’
Harry kept staring from Draco to Hermione and back. What if Krum wouldn't be able to save Hermione within the hour? Hadn't the clue said that if one didn't succed; it wouldn't come back?
But his fame wasn’t as big of a problem in France as it had been in England — which had also been a part of their decision to move away. In London every Wizard or Witch would recognize him immediately. They almost couldn’t go anywhere without anyone wanting an autograph or picture with the famous wizards —
'About earlier. You told me Fleur doesn't need your help but- but I think I do.' He avoided Draco's eyes as he said it, fidgeting on his chair a little. 'I need a friend and as stupid as it may sound, you're the only one willing to be right now.'
“It was alright. Petunia’s cooking has never been the best, let’s face it… And Dudley was acting all strange." Draco's lips curled slightly, and there were no explaining words needed for the both of them to understand why exactly he'd been acting that way. "I was wondering though," Harry continued, "should I have brought something for you as well? Foods or drinks?”
“If you don’t want to, you—,” Potter tries, but the question has already been asked, and Draco’s unwilling to let the pair handcuff him for disobeying an Auror’s order.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
, let's get this shopping over quickly so I can change into something you do like,
' Madame Maxime said to him, interrupting his thoughts. 'You'll feel at home in Scotland as well;
will be too obvious as well, won't it?'
Why would you think that?'
Harry hadn’t returned, but Draco knew he was fighting somewhere himself — he had to be.
. You haven't even met him,' he replied, holding back a few tears of himself now as well.
'We can try and see?' he answered instead, moving closer to the door. 'Goblin, open the door!'
. Looking out the window of the Burrow's kitchen, Harry hoped to see the others arrive safely as well — or at least, a little less harmed than poor George whom had come stumbling in with half his ear blasted off. Ginny and Molly were taking care of him, holding a wet cloth against the boy's face and whispering soft words to him Harry couldn't hear over the beating of his heart. Where were Ron and Hermione? Were Bill and Fleur alright? And the others as well?
Making his way downstairs, he was met with the smell of bacon floating through the air. It made his painfully empty stomach grumble. Briefly, Harry looked into the kitchen where he found his nephew, aunt and uncle around the table, eating the very bacon he smelled and knew Dudley so desperately wanted. Nobody noticed him, and even if they had, neither of them would've invited him to come have breakfast anyway. Vernon had never changed his mind in sixteen years, and he definitely wasn't going to that day.
Draco handed over the girls to their dates almost as if he was giving them away on their wedding day. He looked every boy so intensely in the eyes that they all winced and couldn't leave his side fast enough, carefully taking one of the
Also, I'm planning on re-reading all chapters of Papillon and correcting some mistakes that I made! :)
'Now, let's eat!'
He had felt Arthur's eyes immediately pointed on him, though, as he had stepped inside and observed the Weasley's their home. He still couldn't blame them; especially not now that he got a task from the Dark Lord. Many ticking sounds and house-hold magic soon drew away both Draco's as Arthur's attention, and as Draco observed the interesting clock in the kitchen; he was reminded of his old timepiece he had given to Harry. 'You still have it?' he asked the boy, whom was standing behind him and observing the clock as well — even though Draco knew the boy had probably seen it many times before.
if you say so. Still, I want you to be careful.'
'Charms; I've always been obsessed with learning new spells and different techniques to cast one. That's why I also learn a lot of spells without a wand, you know.
Also know that this ISN'T THE ENDING, there will be more chapters all the way to the War and probably an Epilogue one beyond, so please keep checking for more updates! Thank you as well for all the loving comments and kudos!

I can to help hide his rebirth but—‘
Harry glanced from the letter to his lover and widened his smile. 'I'm here now; show me those beautiful Pyrenees and let's wait for those golden rays of sunlight to shine in,' he said before already walking to the window and searching for what Draco was describing in his letter. 'They are indeed very beautiful,' the boy concluded as Draco knew the Pyrenees could be seen from his window as well.
And so another task was added to Draco's list; providing all of the girls with dates. Every girl from Beauxbatons seemed to want his opinion on their date, dress and hairstyle. The blond got dragged from one corner of Hogwarts to another, taking a look at possible candidates. The girls somehow even planned a day for Durmstrang students to take a chance at asking one of them to the Yule Ball. It was quite the sight seeing those Northern beasts lined up outside in the cold wind, chins held up high and faces expressionless as Draco strode past them. He inspected the boy's face, body, haircut and even fingernails to see if they were fit candidates for the girls. The ones he didn't like, he just sent away by shaking his head at them.
A short silence fell. The sound of the waves could be heard again. A gust of wind wandered through the opened window. The faint smell of salt. 'What if—‘ Hermione started, but she stopped as if already deciding it would be a bad idea.
It makes Harry feel sad; suddenly realizing that Malfoy is on the edge of losing himself. And not even losing himself to just anything, no; once again a soul is slowly losing itself to Voldemort.
The boy now pushed the attic's ladder down, through the hatch and heard how it hit the carpeted floor of the hallway with a bang, then climbed down its wonky rungs. He yawned, let a hand ruffle through his hair and slowly shuffled his way to the bathroom. However, halfway through the hallway a door to his right opened and slammed him in the face. "
'Stop calling me that way,' Harry muttered with a grin but Draco already pushed him through the wall, the brightest of smiles on his lips before he disappeared out of Harry's sight.
'You look silly,' Harry declared, trying to snatch Draco's too large hat off his head.
Waving Harry's words away with an elegant gesture of his head, Draco rose from his seat. 'Let's go!
Draco shook his head. He hadn't found anything new the past weeks and also hadn't even thought about it anymore; his head had been filled with the Yule Ball the entire time. '
The Thestrals greeted them as if they had been awaiting their arrival, half of the group looking around the forest aimlessly to try and find the animals Luna had so animately been talking about. 'I can't see them, can you?' Ron asked his sister but Ginny shook her head.
'But I won't be needing your help with it,
'Well then, shouldn't you be happy to have me as a friend?' Draco asked, putting on a small smile. His smile probably looked more like a grimace as he tried to read Harry's feelings. It was so difficult, though, trying to read his eyes when he kept looking away.
The strangest images of pure white things flashed in front of his eyes, as if a movie was playing in his head, especially and only for him, created by this mysterious person.
, but you can keep this one.' Opening the top drawer of the dresser, she took out the most beautiful jewelry case Harry had ever seen — or at least, the only one he had ever noticed. It was decorated with small seashells and inside a ballerina was spinning rounds while waving at Fleur in a graceful way. There were a few pieces of golden jewelry, but it was mostly filled with photographs that hadn't made it into a frame. She took them all out, quickly looked through them and then handed Harry one with a little grin on her face.
!' A voice then demanded, louder than any voice Draco had ever heard before. He had heard Madame's shout but even she couldn't compete with what appeared to be Dumbledore's voice. Everyone in the Great Hall had immediately gone silent and looked up at the Headmaster with huge eyes. He had risen from his seat, an expression as calm as could be. In the heat of everything, everyone had seemed to forget that there were also professors in the Great Hall. It was a miracle, really that they had been able to shout at each other for more than five minutes without getting interrupted by them. 'Can't you see that you are hurting the poor boy,' Dumbledore sympathized, a hand gesturing slightly in Draco's direction. All eyes were now casted on Draco and he felt like disappearing right on the spot. 'Harry, mister Malfoy—,' Draco finally looked up at the Headmaster and noticed in the corner of his eye that Harry did the same. He had totally forgotten about the boy. Had he been shouting things as well? 'Could I perhaps have a word with the two of you in my office?'
…?' Draco replied, stunned as Harry's arms wrapped around his thin figure.
'Then why are you acting so strange — and why couldn't I hear about it as well?' Harry asked, not letting go of the subject at all.
Perspective change! (At least, for this chapter)
" Another cut in his finger with the potato knife.
“Where is Mother?” he however asks instead.
,' Draco said. 'I'm sure they're willing to tell you a lot about their school in return for stories about ours.'
'Harry,' the headmaster then said, stopping him in his pace. 'Whatever happens; know it's the only way.'
, Draco thought to himself.
He walked a few steps further but a little voice then interrupted his thoughts again.
to prepare a room for them.' Both Draco as Harry gratefully bowed their heads, and as they made their way towards the door again — they could hear Madame ask them one last question. 'You're not only hiding from him,
"What is it now, mother? Is it because I'm wearing these robes again? Is it my hair? You can cut it again if you want, I don't really care that much about it anymore," he says with a sigh.
Draco didn't know how to feel about those words. What was Harry trying to say? That he was glad Draco was helping him but that he'd rather wanted help from his friends? It didn't make sense and Draco also didn't want to hear any of it. He had just spent his entire day filling Harry's empty brain with knowledge on dragons and then he acted like that? He shook his head and continued his walk towards the castle, Harry trailing behind him.
Draco's hand trembled more with every sentence he wrote; the pain in his hand increasing to a point where he dropped his quill and spilled his tiny jar of ink all over the parchment. Iron; the taste of blood as it drifted on his tongue, mixed with salvia. His eyes were feeling strange and itchy — a blurry view. Had those few words already been enough to end his life? A cough followed; a hand brought up to his mouth. Stars of blood on his palm; a sign of near death.
'I will. Every day, if you want me to,' Harry replied with a smile. The boy's smile was something Draco would miss the most of all. Beside his mesmerizing green eyes, of course.
Turning his back to Harry, Draco tried to focus his mind — tried to find a solution to his current situation. He still felt weak, the pain in his arm and on his back still throbbing furiously. What could he do? What healing did he know to fix this? He'd have to analyze the wound first, analyze what exactly was wrong. As his mind wandered off, he didn't notice time resuming itself at first — until he saw a shadow on the floorboards lightly sway.
'What?'
A professor named McGonagall rose from her seat after Dumbledore's short speech to inform the students that there would be dance lessons provided by herself that they would
Harry seemed surprised by his words, and even his attempt at a smile. 'You're my friend?'
"I have been reading your mind since you were a child, but I understand it might be a little strange to you now. Just know I do
he shouted at Harry, his eyes closed and ears covered with his hands. 'Stop!'
It had been so clear; his mother's trembling hands as she had read her newspaper and sipped from her tea. A second chair that was drawn back a bit from the table and her grey eyes that had been glancing at the door behind her the whole time. She nodded her head as an answer and as if on cue, the same door she had been glancing at opened up a bit; a gleaming red eye staring in Draco's direction from the dark.
A wind's breeze. The smell of the sea. Sand underneath his hands and their grains sticking to his fingertips. He opened his eyes, looked at them and noticed how the color of his skin mixed itself with that of an evening sun. Crawling to his feet, he overlooked sandy hills and a sea in the distance — its sound loud yet peaceful at the same time. To his right he saw Hermione and Ron, landed next to each other and crawling to their feet. To his left he saw Draco, already standing upright as straight as a wand. And behind him was Dobby, another proud smile gracing his small face before he ran off towards the cottage — probably to tell everyone the others had arrived.
For a moment Draco wonders why Potter’s looking at him that way. Is it his pale complexion as if he hasn’t seen sun in years? Him wearing ordinary robes instead of flamboyant green ones? Perhaps the slight surprise upon his own face?
Remember you can always just stop reading if you're not interested in knowing what Beauxbatons!Draco will be like in the future developments of the Harry Potter series.
Whispers spread around the Hall and Draco looked at the Gryffindor table over his shoulder. Almost immediately he caught Harry amongst his friends, frozen and with eyes opened wide. The curly-haired girl, Hermione, gave him a push against his shoulder to get him to move but the boy shook his head. 'Harry Potter!' Dumbledore's voice called again, this time louder and more irritated.
"Your parents did, Harry. In their last seconds of Mortal life they begged their own Guardians to guard their child as well — that they trusted in God to protect you."
Draco thought as he hurried himself over to a girl whom seemed to be losing to an Acromantula. A single powerful curse was enough to silent the creature for good, and the first-year gave Draco a thankful look.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Lowering his head again, Harry was about to lower another rung when another thought struck his mind, and he looked up at the boy once more. "What is your
And then he had tried to wrap his arms around Harry instead, hold him close to try and calm him down, but it had made the boy angry. Harry had pushed him away, made him stumble into the arms of his friends. A glance at Hermione and Ron and they had seemed to be equally confused. Harry didn't only seem sad anymore; he had become
to hear over and over again. How much he had missed his smile, the green of his eyes and that messy hair of his. He dreamt away already while trying to imagine what clothes he would be wearing; worn-off denims and a hoodie three sizes too big, probably. He wiped a strand of silver hair off his own tailored trousers and decided then and there he would take Harry shopping for new clothes that holiday.
'If he was French,' Draco started. 'He would've written all these scribbles in French as well — not in English.
Hermione glanced at Ron, hoping to find some support but Ron seemed to have made the decision to follow Harry's plan; nodded at his best friend with much confidence. 'Fine,' Hermione decided. 'You two won't survive a minute without me anyway.'
'Silence,' he demanded.
'I indeed haven't,' his mother admitted. 'I wish I could; I wish we lived in a time of peace where there was no right and no wrong. Where we were a normal, happy family that weren't pressured to obey a man after making one single mistake. Shouldn't we deserve a second chance, Draco? Shouldn't we deserve a way to make up for that mistake?'
, he asked himself as he peered into the bowl of blue. A memory was floating around in it and luring him in like a sweet song. And before Draco knew it; he already bended forward and let his face meet with the blue.
“Are you going to keep standing there,
Ron isn't really feeling happy about the fact that they're visiting Malfoy, he told Harry that just when they’d arrived. Not to mention that it was written all over his face.
— H.P. —
Harry took a step forward, throwing his hands up in the air as if it was obvious. 'Oh, I don't know — maybe the fact that
The corner of Harry’s mouth lifted slightly. ‘I apologize for that — it was the only way.’
At first glance Harry thought it wasn't real — at first he couldn't quite decipher what it was
like one of his. "Wasn't that shirt —
A few goblins then came storming in, but the dragon held them back by blowing a large cloud of fire. It resulted in frightening Draco even more, and his feet finally moved — but in the opposite direction. He took a few steps back, closed his eyes and tried to block everything from his mind.
Hermione nodded, but dark circles around her eyes and chapped lips were saying otherwise. Ron seemed to be the only one to sleep alright in the house, but he always had been one to sleep quite fast and easily no matter when or where. Often Harry could hear his friend snore all the way to his room, waking him up from his nightmares.
The leather glove also gets thrown somewhere on the floor and black slender fingers curl and uncurl themselves in front of Harry's eyes. Harry can see the curse hover at the skin's transition from his shoulder to chest, ready to take over another part of Malfoy's body at any given time.

side more easily — believe he's the answer to all of the Wizarding World's problems.' Draco didn't recognize the voice, and by the frowned look on Harry's face; he probably didn't as well. But who was this man they were talking about; was it Voldemort? Were people starting to join his side — was he perhaps getting stronger?
But they were toys no more. And they most definitely didn't have time to play. The sword was here, Draco could feel, and had to be found. 'We better start searching, I'm sure we'll be able to find the sword with four sets of eyes,' Harry assured them, stepping into the vault and letting his eyes roam over the many, many objects.
Because of all his thinking, he almost doesn't notice Ron suddenly walking out of the drawing room, heading straight to the door, ready to leave — but Harry has still so many things to ask. Not really knowing what to do, and finding himself between two fires, Harry decides to follow Ron. But as he takes one step outside the room, he suddenly feels unable to take another step. Without even thinking about it, he turns around and asks Malfoy if he can come back later tonight. He wants to talk more to him, wants to know when the curse started spreading and so on. But of course he gets the reaction he expected; a firm and angry denial to ever set foot in Malfoy Manor again.
Harry shook his head with a grin. 'I wanted to ask you another thing — I kept forgetting about it but now that we're saying our so-called good-byes again,' Harry began. He then retrieved Draco's timepiece from his pocket. 'It acts strange whenever you're around, I noticed. It's almost as if—'
'Your middle
"Lumos," Draco whispers, after grabbing for his wand with his long fingers. The wood feels unfamiliar, just as it has done the past five years. A flicker of light; weak yet bright enough for Draco to see that his arm is still the same. It's itching again, and he knows it'll keep on itching for the remainder of the day. His Dark Mark has become invisible underneath blackened skin, caused by a curse. A curse of an abandoned Death Eater.
But they weren't safe just yet as the fire-serpent was rising, growing. They tried to get to the other side of the room, but it almost felt like doing parkour in the air as they had to avoid burning piles and hissed flames. They were almost there, could see the large door on the other side when Harry's eyes spot Castor on top of one of the piles; holding on to what seemed to be an old chair while keeping his eyes tightly shut. 'We must save him,' Harry heard Draco say, shout at him.
'Voldemort.' Looking away at the mention of the monster's name and feeling a shiver go down his spine — Draco could feel Harry's eyes trying to read his emotions. And yes, of course the brave Gryffindor noticed that that name had triggered something inside of him. As Harry shook Draco's shoulder a little in order to make him look into his emerald eyes again, he asked him another question. 'It has, right? You know about the task Dumbledore has given me — the task to obtain the memory from Slughorn in order to destroy him... has Dumbledore perhaps given you a task of you own as well?'
Draco jumped up from his seat and all the other girls followed almost as fast. As Fleur made her way towards Dumbledore, everyone clapped their hands and Draco decided to blow some magical butterflies behind her. One fluttered down on Fleur's shoulder and she threw a bright smile at Draco before shaking Dumbledore's hand and accepting his congratulations. Before she made her way to the door as well, Dumbledore took the butterfly from her shoulder and looked at it with great curiosity. Madame Maxime beamed from across the room and followed Fleur with her eyes as she left through the door.
Her eyes were casted towards the ceiling; where far above their heads a globe of light was visible.
Draco waved away his thoughts and pinched the bridge of his nose. He had to stop thinking those things or it would ruin his friendship with Harry all over again. At the thought of his name, Harry himself appeared in the dimmed hallway. Or at least his head did. The rest of his body was hidden beneath his invisibility cloak and therefore impossible to see. It would have surprised Draco if he hadn't known Harry owned one of those cloaks. A weird sight, that's what it was.
, Weasel!' The calmness he had wanted Harry to remain, he himself hadn't been able to keep. He looked furious all of the sudden, as if old wounds had been opened with the slightest mention of his last name and that of the
New chapter again soon and there might be slight twist in perspectives *hint hint*
A slap of a hand then followed; one Draco had expected to receive as a greeting but was now given as a punishment. 'How dare you talk about your father that way, Draco! And call him that name! He is obeying him for he must protect us!' A burning fire was now visible in her dull eyes; a fire Draco had never quite seen before.
Madame cupped his cheek like she had done before they had left weeks ago, staring into his grey eyes. 'I know it won't. You're not the one to repeat the same mistake twice,' she said. Her voice had turned serious; a tone she only used to make something
.' A weird gleam was visible in Voldemort's eyes, one Draco caught as dared to glance at the monster. 'There is a way, however, in which he can right his wrongs.' Voldemort rose from his seat at the head of the table, slowly sauntered behind everyone's chair before coming to a halt by Draco's. A pale, near-blue hand reached itself out forwards— placing a locket the color of the death-spell on the surface in front of Draco's eyes. 'This, my boy, you will protect with your life.'
Feeling something clam take ahold of his hand; he looked up in the beaming face of Harry. He couldn't return the look, for as he felt unwelcome and uncomfortable at the same time. Could he please crawl back through that dark tunnel and go live with Dumbledore's brother, please? But of course he didn't actually want to — but it was always an option. 'They don't want me here,' he whispered to Harry, the others not hearing him over their own excited shouting.
told him it was a lie. Yet he didn't quite know why. Draco returned the smile, though hesitant and slightly wary.
The others stopped eating; a bit startled by Draco's question. Come on, it wasn't as if he had offended the man or anything, had he? The man didn't think so either, as he sat himself down on the remaining chair, and answered him. 'Aberforth Dumbledore, is the name. And yes; I am Albus his brother,' he added at seeing the shocked eyes of Ron.
, he concluded. His feet already dragged him in its direction; the house towering above the trees like an angry demon. The little windows were darkened, only a few on the ground floor lighted up with the warm glow of a fireplace. A hedge surrounded the property; a magical one that would keep all trespassers away by strangling them to near death and blasting off the most awful alarm — but Draco knew a weak spot somewhere to the left; a small opening that he had discovered as a child. He hurried himself towards it, found it almost immediately and slipped through it as if it didn't contain any dark magic at all. The elaborate garden of the Manor doomed up in front of his eyes; hedges cut in the shape of peacocks and white animals alike passing by as he made his way closer to the house. A few roses to his left, colored red like blood and lilies to the right, reflecting the pale moonlight and blinding Draco's eyes.
, Raphael. Can I go in?' The portrait gave him a wink before he swung aside. Draco himself waited a few seconds, allowing Harry to go in first, before casually following him as if he hadn’t just sneaked in another boy into his room.
"To the attic."
Hermione answered his question with a nod. 'And it wasn't even the first time,' she turned herself to Ron again. 'Do you really think I won't notice you when I can see a speck of orange in the corner of my eye everywhere I go?
did this to you. I hurt you while I was supposed to
Draco then thinks by himself.
She flashed a few bright teeth at him, a smile Draco didn't return — but he wanted Fleur to look beautiful today as Draco expected her to join the Tournament — she was the brightest Witch of her year. Of course there were other girls that were capable of participating in the Tournament as well, but Fleur just had that little extra touch. Probably the Veela touch, that could enchant people and was a big advantage to her. Draco combed a little further through his hair with his fingers, tied it up perfectly and hid it beneath Beauxbatons' signature blue hat. He was ready for today and hoped that the girls were as well; they had to be as enchanting as possible. They had to beam and they had to be able to make any boy drop to his knees at the slightest glance thrown in their direction. As Draco opened his door and took a peek down the passageway again, he could see some girls running from one compartment to another; looking simply marvelous.
Draco turned himself to Harry one last time, kissed him as if he would never kiss him again and took out his timepiece from his robes' pocket. 'Take this,
, can you please hurry up a bit? I don't want to spend my whole evening waiting for you to take the potion,' Draco said to him to push the boy.
Sneaking downstairs on the tips of his toes, Draco tried to listen carefully to catch a hint of sound that would let him know where his mother was. A ruffling of paper then caught his ears; his mother probably reading the Daily Prophet over some breakfast. Entering the breakfast room with still zero sound, Draco looked at his reading mother; elegantly dressed as usual but with slightly shaking hands. Clearing his throat, he got her attention and made her jump slightly. 'Draco?' Was her reaction as she folded the newspaper and placed it next to her cup of morning tea. 'I wasn't expecting to see you.' Her eyes were a bit red and slightly swollen; as if she had been crying for two whole months -- the two months Draco had been hiding in his bedroom.
The smallest of smiles appears on Draco's face and of course it doesn't go unnoticed. Potter's mouth follows almost as quickly; making a wide smile appear and flashing bright teeth at Draco. Because the man looks so utterly stupid, sitting there all messy and uncomfortable but still smiling, Draco smiles brightly as well. It even hurts his cheeks a little; it has been
Red and gold, seated surprisingly far away from Harry that day, made up for an un-celebrating crowd. Throwing annoyed glances at Harry, it almost seemed as if Draco had returned to the Champions Selection day. Those Gryffindors who
To his relief, or maybe not so much, they don't even have to enter the building itself. A jailer meets them at the entrance with a straight, serious face and crossed arms. ”Heard you two were coming so 'thought I'd spare you the effort of making a way through. Would've been unnecessary,” he announces, rather without a care.
'He might not now, but I'm sure he'll eventually will, Harry. The monster's not stupid.
, a voice told Draco.
Hermione pushed him against his shoulder. 'What else should he have done? Let him die? You're unbelievable, Ron!' she said to the sulking fire next to her. It made Draco grin, realizing that the word unbelievable seemed to be a much better word to describe the house of Gryffindor with than
Dursley, the husband.
Taking his round glasses off, Harry washed his face with some water while trying to think of something else than the negative comments floating around in his head. His mind drifted off towards school again, and a slight nauseous feeling filled his stomach with dread. Lifting his face again, he dried it with a clean towel — kept it rested against his eyes for a moment longer. As he lowered it, and his eyes grazed past the mirror once more, he caught something moving in its reflection. Did the painting behind him just move a few inches to the left? Whirling around immediately, Harry took a step closer towards the very painting. The seascape depicted on it still looked the same, but its frame definitely didn't. With a little push, Harry hung it straight again, took a step backwards and gave it one final look before turning around again. A shake of his head.
he tells himself,
It went on like that for a month; Christmas creeping closer and only a few more days away. The holidays had arrived but lots of students decided to stay at Hogwarts; saw it as a safer place than going home. Perhaps they were right, Harry had thought to himself, or maybe not. He had grown suspicious of every move Draco did; keeping his eyes focused on every gesture the boy made. When he ate his toast in the morning, Harry glanced at his eyes to make sure he wasn't looking over at the Slytherin table. In class, he also made sure they weren't sitting too close to the blond git either. But nothing about Draco's behavior during the day made it appear that he was secretly meeting with Castor at night — when they crossed each other in the hallway they didn't even exchange looks or act strangely at all.
Draco gave Harry his own drink, a green one that tasted like apples. The boy grinned as he took Draco's glass and tasted the sweet apple flavor. ‘And Hagrid? You told me about him delivering your Hogwarts letter, but you never told me what he was like,' Draco asked him in return.
definitely isn't.' He had listened to her speech, of course, as there had been no escape from it anyway. Every student of his beloved school had had to listen to her squeaking voice explaining why she was there and what she would be doing. All the words that had come from her mouth had been disguised to sound pleasing — to sound
Finding the Department of Cursed Corpses was one of the most difficult things Harry had ever done. It was almost as difficult as finding a damn Horcrux! Together with Ron he explored every inch of the Ministry at least three times; not finding anything that could point in it's direction. Nobody talked about it, wrote about or even heard about, besides Kingsley of course.
to Orlin, but the poor boy had become sick on Christmas morning, leaving Draco to go to the ball on his own. 'Ah, well,' he had said to the girls. 'At least I'll be able to keep a closer watch on all of you.'
The boy shook his head, tried to form words with his lips but seemed to find himself unable to speak. With a deep sigh, Harry decided to trust this strange boy, and started walking back home.
And so it became natural for Harry Potter to roam the hallways of Hogwarts alone while getting shouted at, and Draco feeling pity for him. Some blond Slytherin even made awful badges reading '
with us,' Madame announced.
A week went by filled with nothing but normality. Umbridge her decrees increased by the day, they studied as hard as they could for their exams and took classes until they fell asleep at their professor's words. But one thing had changed — one thing was different than all the weeks before; Harry hadn't received a single letter from Draco anymore. He had been eagerly waiting on Monday morning for Hedwig to fly in, drop a letter on his plate with the name 'James' beautifully written upon it in gold — but nothing. His plate had stayed empty and Hedwig had stayed in the owlery amongst the owls of others. Of course it had worried Harry; what if his father had indeed taken him home — was Draco safe there? What if Umbridge had overpowered Madame Maxime's way of ruling Beauxbatons?
'Then let's apparate to the square,' Harry concluded. 'We'll walk to the Manor from there; I'm sure we'll be able to find it.'
Draco didn't dare to take another glance at the boy as he left the hallway, yet he knew Harry's eyes were following him, staring at him with what was probably unsatisfied hunger mixed with confusion.
pronounced, a bright spark of golden stars leaves Potter’s wand followed by red flames. They hit Draco hard in the chest, making him stumble a few steps back. His new china cup he got from Potter jiggles against it’s tiny saucer on the small table and another few trinkets in Draco’s room make themselves present with tiny sounds.
Of course they hadn't noticed anything; they never did. Draco opened his mouth to reply but got interrupted by Madame Maxime clearing her throat.
Hogwarts? Scotland?
. I'm sorry I didn't inform you before we left.'
.' It was then that Draco himself started to cry; tears rolling down his cheeks and mixing themselves with the last of the blood in his mouth. He had been close to dying, hadn't he?
Draco rolled his eyes, tried to make a way through the now covered floor, but touched a few items himself. 'It must stand out,' he said. 'There's mostly golden items in here, and the sword of Gryffindor is silver with rubies.'
Harry smiled because of his words and shook his head as well. 'I am also too young. Fourth year, you know. Beside, wouldn't even want to participate in the first place. Already had quite enough adventures in the past three years to skip them this time. And please, don't call me
Visiting Malfoy again left Harry with mixed feelings. Every time he saw the blond he couldn't help but feel sad and have pity for his condition. Why was it that he had to end up like he did; cursed and all alone. He never wanted Malfoy to end up like that at all; he wanted everyone to be happy and living an amazing life after the War. He had hoped the git got married and had many Pureblood babies with his Pureblood wife. Yet, the Malfoy heir was left alone in an empty Manor with his grieving mother and a curse.
He stormed out of the Great Hall, chin held up high as he tried not to sulk over Fleur's words. Just because she didn't want to communicate with anyone from the other school, didn't mean Draco couldn't. Of course he kept the girls as far away from the other students as he could, but that didn't mean they couldn't be friends with any. It was just a precaution to try and avoid hearts getting broken. Did no-one understand?
things that are wonderful about being an angel — and I am sure I shall tell you more about that as time goes by."
His green eyes find Draco's greys again and this time it's Draco who looks away. Potter is interested in his life? Since when?
Harry's arm slipped around Draco's waist and on the tips of his toes, he bend a forward a little to whisper something in his ear. 'Would you like to see where I sleep?'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Draco wondered.
'Care to share that idea?' Draco asked with a little smile, but Harry shook his head.
Dumbledore's soothing words were just the ones Draco had wanted to hear;
The castle neared and Draco noticed that Harry had gone silent again. The boy was looking down at his feet, hands tucked in his hoodie once again as well. 'Something wrong?' Draco asked him, worry resounding through his voice.
Draco called out, not even noticing he was saying it in French. Stepping closer to the house and feeling the fire's warmth sting in his face, he raised both his hands with his wand in one. Not whispering but shouting spells at the house now, he desperately tried to extinguish the fire that was destroying someone's beloved possession — someone's home. Tears were welling up in his eyes as he thought of the wonderful clock in the kitchen, the friendly portraits against the walls and all the other magical little things the Weasleys had collected over the years.
He heard the blond sigh. A sigh of tiredness. 'That I'm tired,' he answered with a yawn.
could keep a straight face when talking to her.'
‘Don’t be so harsh on them.’ Another man came into view. Hair like a bird’s nest, dressed in the most awful robes one could wear in the French Pyrenees. ‘He’s only a first year and you’re training him as if he’s Krum competing for the World Championship.’
Red, green, blue and even yellow passed by their table to wish Fleur good luck, neither of them daring to pat Fleur's shoulder like they did with Krum or Diggory. It probably was Fleur's Veela inheritance that kept them at bay, hands tucked away neatly in their robes' pockets. Fleur returned all of their words with little smiles and nods. It worried Draco that she was so silent, but perhaps she was just lost in thought.
The Fat Lady gave him a little smile, apparently pleased by his addressing. 'How can I help you, young man? You do not look like a Gryffindor to me, am I right?'
badges with great pleasure. Harry didn't seem to mind them any longer, just clenched his jaw and kept his eyes straight ahead. He made a turn to the left and Draco noticed they were on their way to the front gates of Hogwarts, which meant they were leaving Hogwarts all together.
Eyes opened slowly, their gaze lifted and staring into the cracked mirror of Harry's wardrobe. The reflection he saw confused him at first, but it didn't last very long as such an intense feeling overcame him that his heart stopped beating and his breath caught in his throat. Words weren't there to be said, thoughts weren't there to think. Everything stopped, and the overwhelming feeling of the unknown hit Harry like waves against a cliff.
'No, he isn't,' uncle Vernon answered. 'And he certainly doesn't want to, do you?'
arm… was a sign of the fact that you trust me… wasn't it?” Harry now asks.
'That she misses you — hopes you're doing well and that things are still the same at home. Something about being proud of you for being sorted into the house of bravery and courage,' Harry replied, reading a bit of the letter's content.
"Of course,
We have to take a bath for my plan to work. And hurry up a bit, we don't have all night!’ Draco took off the white shirt he wore underneath his jumper and at the sight of his pale, bare chest Harry seemed to wince. It only made Draco roll his eyes as he watched the boy hesitantly take off his own jumper.
The dining chamber was quickly filled with whispers; the words Triwizard and Tournament spreading like wildfire. Draco himself drew up his eyebrows, giving the twins a wide-eyed stare. Getting one returned he tried to remember everything he had learnt during
'He told us he'd wait,' Hermione replied, a nervous undertone hearable in her voice.
A sigh follows and Potter enters the Manor again, passing Draco by the doorway with a single wide step. 'It's nothing really… I just hoped I'd find out more by now. Disappointing you isn't something I want to do, you know.'
'So, I'm you’re boyfriend now?' Harry asked, eyes glittering and with a grin on his face.
at me, Harry!' He shouts in his face.
Draco thought he had assured Harry's worries but realized that he probably had confused the boy even more. ‘H-how do you mean-,' he started, eyes still focused in Draco's. They expressed
Of course Draco hadn't been able to tell them he had gone to Hogsmeade with Harry but he told them he had been too curious and gone off to explore the little village on his own. Upon entering a bookstore, he had gotten lost of all sense of time and returned at an hour way later than he had wanted to. The girls hadn't questioned his story; they took it as the truth without a second thought. Not even one of them asked what books Draco ended up buying nor did they ask to see them; they just believed him.
Harry didn't make an appearance during breakfast but Draco's luck turned when he spotted the boy during lunch. He couldn't help but glance over at the Gryffindor table every minute or so. His eyes kept observing the green-eyed boy, seated all the way at the end of the table, utterly alone. Hermione hovered close to him but the distance between the two friends was too wide to have a decent conversation. Harry also didn't seem to be very hungry; poking into his food every now and then to not take a single bite of it. After around fifteen minutes of staring and poking, the boy pushed his plate away and stood up from his seat.
'How many staircases can there be in this bloody castle?' Ron huffed, rolling his eyes and following Draco and the others into the room.
'. Reading and controlling minds, movings things by pure will, healing, flying… And then each angel has a special power that others do not possess. Some have the same, but there are a few rare ones out there as well. I, for example, have a
The twins chuckled at his words and Ansel's comforting hand patted him on the back. As they sat upon the benches again, a few first-years glancing at Draco with curious eyes, Draco told the twins all about his mission to capture the rotten apple that was his Portkey. They laughed but were worried at the same time; especially at the mention of thinking to have seen his mother's eyes. 'At least it weren't

feel about it! Do you think I find it amusing that my mortals always either seem to die, get really sick or suddenly lose their Faith?"
. You're the only one I can talk to right now. I don't want to wake any of the girls.'
Draco shook his head, to which the boy snatched the pastry away and indulged it like only he could. A nudge in the side followed by Hermione, but her attention soon got drawn away by Lavender Brown nearing the Gryffindor table. Her eyes were red and poofy, as if she had been crying all night. As she seated herself at the end of the table — far away from her dear Won-Won — she stared in their direction with fire in her eyes. 'Something wrong with her?' Harry asked, noticing her as well.
Harry gave him a weak smile. He missed Remus greatly but knew that a life as a teacher at Hogwarts wasn't ideal for him. 'The reason why I asked is, well, you told me before that butterflies are a returning theme in your life. So, I was wondering if—‘
he reminded himself.
Walking through the hallways of Hogwarts which Draco could now call a bit of his own, he couldn't help but miss the marble floors and golden detailing of the one he previously called his. Brown, grey and flames from burning torches were greeting him here; making shadows dance on the walls and bringing a medieval feeling with it all. Shaking his head at his own missing, Draco quickened his pace to keep up with the old man — whom was way faster than anyone of Draco's own age — and followed him back into his office. There Dumbledore immediately closed to door behind them and guided Draco to a chair for him to sit. 'What is it that you wanted to tell me,
And so he ran on again, faced more fears, faced more obstacles. And saved more Champions. Cedric Diggory had been the strangled one that time, but not by evil roots; by the strong hands of Viktor Krum. The Durmstrang boy's eyes had been as white as porcelain, clearly possessed, as he had made Cedric's face turn an unusual color by his strong grip. There also hadn't been any hesitation from Harry to help Cedric and he casted a stunning curse on Krum which saved the Hufflepuff's life; saved his opportunity to win the Tournament.
, don't be. I'm just... not
Noticing that Draco was starting to get confused because Harry had stopped, Harry quickly kissed him again, and felt a cold hand take ahold of his shoulder, pushing Harry onto his back. The roles had changed, and there was no way in looking around those raven eyes as they stared at Harry from above — almost the same color as the night sky.
Draco shook his head. 'They know I'm
Ron went straight to bed; his eyes puffy and tired from keeping watch from hours on end. Draco was starting to get tired himself as well, and moved Harry a bit aside to squeeze himself next to him; lay himself down in the same small bed. The pine scent that lingered around the boy was very faint now; had been taken over by the smell of sweat and fear — that of visions that were too frightful for the boy to witness. A pale hand crept its way around the boy's waist, his head against his shoulder. At least Harry would wake up assured and safe, Draco thought to himself. At least he would wake up with someone next to him that he knew, and loved.
'Me?' Draco asked with frown eyebrows. 'I will and always have been me,
'We'll see,
Draco's eyes grew wider with curiosity. 'And that is?'

, sugars in his tea and stirring the liquid with great force. "But yes, I do have to tell you something…”
So, Castor -- of course -- it basically the Draco 'we sort of know from the real books/movies'. I just thought it would be a fun way to bring like another side of him into the story, even though he's also an entirely different person. I've already mentioned him like 2 times before in other chapters but from this one on he will start to play an important role *hint*.
It had all gone greatly, though. The bird had been delivered without Harry following Draco and as Draco had wondered in bed what was going to happen to the bird; the blond Slytherin had slowly taken it away into a secret, hidden room.
'I can cast some drying spells as well, if you want?' Draco proposed, and Hermione nodded her head in agreement.
to do. He had never spilled a thing about it to Voldemort — Snape had been the person to blame for that act. Neither could he help to feel a certain sympathy, as he as well had once been under the towering, demanding figure of his father — but that was no more. The only person he would listen to, he would obey now would be Harry. Would be the

A shake from Draco's head followed as he tried to get up; get away from Harry again for his own good. But, as had been proven many times before, the boy was way stronger than Draco was — keeping him down in the cold snow. 'I
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Dumbledore turned around, his old eyes looking at Hermione with a weird look visible in them. Behind his back, the girl slowly sauntered away. 'Have you read about her?' Dumbledore asked in return, his eyes not leaving Hermione's. She nodded her curly head. 'Read it in that book?' His finger pointed at the book whom Draco had had in his hands only a few minutes ago. Hermione nodded again. 'It's rubbish!' he declared, walking over to it and throwing it onto the floor with a flick of his hand.
Letting out a sneer at the sight of the cup, Draco places it down on his desk. He needs to think about all the things Potter said for a second. Dropping himself down on the chair by his desk, he rereads the letter.
Finally Dumbledore rose from his seat and made his way around the table, towards the Goblet. The blue flames were still roaring brightly and as the old man clapped his hands, all other sources of light went out; almost like Draco had done during his entrance. Chatting students shut their mouths and all eyes were focused on the Goblet and its blue fire now. Dumbledore cleared his throat and freed his hands from his sleeves a bit. 'Now, the moment you have all been waiting for; the selection of our three Champions,' Dumbledore called out through the Hall.
He needed an explanation; he needed to know why his father had been acting that way towards him and how he knew Lucius Malfoy. And more importantly; wether he
Ron wrapped an arm around Hermione’s shoulder, guided her away to the Hall as well. After a while only Harry and Draco were left, standing side by side. Grey eyes glanced at Harry beside him; still holding on to Draco's wand as if he would have to raise it any second again. It wasn't going to be necessary, Draco knew, as the monster was finally defeated and the Death Eaters had fled. He placed his hand over Harry's, the gesture making the boy turn his face. Green met grey. A small smile, hesitant and close to a grimace but not quite yet. The wood left the boy's grip; warm and clam like Draco knew Harry's hands to be. He tucked the wand away in the pocket of his trousers; their light grey color looking black because of the dirt and blood — his jumper the same.
And he certainly also wasn't feeling like telling Harry about it, as he knew the boy would probably melt away of shame.
But as Mad-Eye rolled both his normal as his mad eye, Hermione already pulled a strand of hair from Harry's head and made it disappear into the flask. Giving her a glare with his eyes, he saw how she apologetically casted her own eyes away. 'Everyone — take a sip and put on these.' A huge pile of clothes were dumped on aunt Petunia's burgundy carpeted floor before the flask went around — slowly turning his friends into identical versions of himself.
way to fight the winged creature, right? Harry probably didn't need his help anymore so Draco could easily ignore him again and take care of the girls like was supposed to do. And study properly again, because that was something he also had abandoned for a while.
Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He then opened them again and whispered the incantation. A slight silver spark left his wand and Draco noticed how a bubble started to form around Harry's head. It grew larger and larger and when it finally had fully enclosed itself around his head, Draco didn't even hesitate to push the boy into the Lake. Harry's body disappeared into the dark water with a loud splash and for a moment Draco wondered if the boy could even swim.
Confused, Draco shook his head. ‘
Later that day Castor approached him as well, and Draco was prepared to hear him ramble on about his task again, yet all the boy had to say was one single word.
Hermione gave Draco a strange look. ‘Of course, he was here when you entered the Hall. Didn’t you see him?’
'Alright — Tonks. Are you also a member of this
'Please, don't go! At least, not yet…' Harry took ahold of his arm once again, the palm of his hand radiating a great warmth through Draco's dressing gown. 'Hagrid is a good friend of mine and just wanted to help me like your Headmistress wanted to help you. Or at least, wanted to help Fleur.'
want to be my friend?’
Dumbledore showed up the next day as if there hadn't been a battle at all; a delighted look on his face and a pile of waffles in front of him. They had found him at the professor's table during breakfast; the whole dining chamber glancing at the headmaster with curiosity. Draco and Harry had immediately stormed in the old man's direction once they had noticed what the others had been so curious about — had been looking at — and Dumbledore had greeted them with a mouth full of waffles and a beard full of crumbs. 'Harry, Draco,' he had said to them as a greeting. 'Hope you two weren't too worried about me?'
Swallowing because of the fact that that same Harry was standing right beside them, Draco looked away for a few seconds before being able to focus himself again. 'Right,' he answered. 'Then at least let me take a look at it again,
'It's not someone…,' Ron's eyes get a bit bigger as he continues 'it's
With that said, Potter turns around and makes his way to the front door, leaving Draco in the tea room. All alone and utterly scared.
Taking it as a green light, Draco rose as well and clutched the few books he had taken with him tightly against his chest. 'I'm going to the library to study a bit. If anyone needs anything or wants to go anywhere accompanied, let me know,' he told the girls in French. They all nodded and resumed their previous chatter; no longer paying attention to him.
a little voice told him.
Draco placed his pillow on top of his head, tried to bury his thoughts away with it, but of course it didn't work. After another few minutes he finally gave up and jumped out of bed, headed for the door. The common room was deserted and all portraits were asleep, snoring loudly with peaceful expressions on their painted faces. Draco turned himself towards the portrait of Raphael, whom had his face rested upon his single hand.
. But I don’t like to show it to just anyone; it makes people feminize me quite fast,' Draco said. He let a hand go through his long locks and Harry watched his every move with a strange look of hunger in his eyes, almost as if he himself would like to try brush through the silver as well.
?' Draco replied, eyebrows frown and eyes a bit bigger than usual.

, but Castor Idel, actually.'
'Draco?
But this wasn't an innocent way of running at all; this running was to stay alive — to keep his secrets and make sure he wouldn't hurt himself nor Harry. Yet the boy's legs were faster than Draco's and caught up with him in under a minute; tackling him down into the freshly fallen snow. Cold white overcame Draco as he hit the ground and got turned on his back by Harry; the boy's green eyes staring in his in an almost psychopathic way. 'Tell me the truth, Draco,' he repeated.
'I'm sorry,' he said once again and Draco rolled his eyes.
,' he told the portrait with a sob. The portrait swung aside and let him enter his small room. Draco immediately dropped himself upon his bed, pulled his pillow closer and buried his face within it.
“I see,” Harry replies. Flames in the shape of a Chinese dragon, a lion and a serpent dance in front of his eyes. Licking Malfoy's heels, chasing Crabbe and leading him towards death. It must've been horrible for Malfoy to have lost one of his closest friends, even though he mostly commanded the fool around. But also the fact that he almost lost his own life because of a stupid mistake must've been hard to deal with. Especially because it had been saved by the boy who hadn’t wanted to be his friend back when they’d been eleven.
'I can't!' Draco replied as he tried to get up again; only to get pushed down by Harry's strong hands. Snow slowly crept its way to his neck and he could feel the coldness of it burn his pale skin.
Both Draco as Harry smiled brightly as they watched Umbridge storm away, ready to explode. Harry's friends cheered from one of the tables and the students from Beauxbatons' gladly joined them as they were all too happy as well to have escaped from the pink devil's claws. Madame Maxime also sighed out of relief and placed a hand upon Dumbledore shoulder as if to say 'thank you', and Dumbledore smiled at her with a proud look upon his face.

Draco gathered his courage, gathered all his strength to lift the heavy sword again — to raise it above his head.
place by the looks of it.
, Draco kept reminding himself. And he was right as he saw a raven haired boy walk away from him a bit further down the hallway, clearly in a hurry and trying to avoid someone. Draco sprinted his way towards him, his heart beating fast in his chest as he grabbed Harry by his shoulder and turned him around. Emeralds of confusion and hate looked straight into his eyes. 'Leave me
Draco nodded. '
"Oh—" Harry was halfway down the ladder when he stopped, popped his head up the attic again. "Feel free to take a new shirt from my closet, before you catch a cold or something."
Draco turned to see that Harry's friends had gone quiet while throwing Draco confused glances. Harry on the other hand still smiled brightly and threw one end of his red and yellow scarf over his shoulder.
Harry had gone to fight Voldemort by himself. Didn't he trust the others? Did he have no faith at all that there might be a possibly that the good side would win this battle, this war? Draco shook his head. No, he just didn't want to see anyone else die. He had enough of it. He had enough of being the Chosen One — the one that was supposed to be the one to survive while others surrendered themselves for him.

Malfoy lets out a sneer. 'Something useful like that book that spread the curse even further?' His hand automatically reaches towards his collarbone, hidden away beneath the green fabric of his robes.
a porcelain statue of a dog, missing its head; an object any person would simply throw away instead of hiding in a special room at Hogwarts. 'Here, try this.' Throwing the statue in Draco's direction and hoping the boy would catch it, Draco saw how it suddenly collided into something —
Harry shook his head. 'No, they don't believe me. At least, Ron doesn't. Hermione is just… confused, I guess. She doesn't know who to believe or who to support.
Thanks for all the kudos and always be free to comment! :)
'I must admit I can believe that; you seem so much brighter a Wizard than any other fourth-year. Bet you'll do great as a charms professor,' Harry said to him. His words fed the warmth even more.
*wipes away tear* It's over... It's the end... I'm a bit sad, not going to lie. I truly enjoyed writing my French!Draco and everything Beauxbatons themed. Perhaps I should something similar but Durmstrang style, haha? Or just move the whole thing to Beauxbatons, what about that? I seriously am not ready to let anything from this magical, Papillon world go. But for now, I say farewell and thank you all for sticking around and reading my story. I truly hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

'Do go on, Harry James Potter. Spill that tea,' the woman said, grinning more with each word.
'I do? Then perhaps I should take it off,
Draco shook his head. '
Draco sighed. He himself had no idea at all nor did he know exactly how a vanishing cabinet worked. 'All I know is that a vanishing cabinet vanishes things; wether it disappears forever or shows up somewhere else — I'm not quite sure.'
Harry then heard footsteps near, turned his head to the right to see the perfect resemblance of himself storm towards younger Snape, a wand drawn and a smirk on his face. It was his father — accompanied by young Remus and Sirius — making his way to Snape. 'What are you doing here, Snivellus? That's our spot,' his father called out.

What was it that Davis had seen in Dolohov's body that made it resemble a Dementor that much? Sure enough it could have been as black as Malfoy's arm, but shouldn’t Unspeakables be used to seeing corpses burned and hexed? Wasn't that similar to an entire black corpse, anyway? It all became a mystery Harry was desperate to solve.
time since he'd heard his aunt's name. Mother didn't like to talk about her sister; she was supposed to be forgotten. Draco had always been rather curious to know why a Pureblood woman had given up her life of wealth and prestige for the life with a Muggle. Of course now he could understand her actions; love is stronger than any other emotion.

, spread around by a Ministry that wasn't in the hands of the good anymore. They had realized that soon enough, as they had read the Daily Prophet and seen its cover with a smiling Dolores Umbridge depicted on it. Hermione quickly speculated that Voldemort was behind this sudden new election. Even though Umbridge had seemed so highly against him, they were all convinced they would match perfectly evil-wise. The cruel woman was in charge of interrogating Muggle-borns and Half-Bloods now — of which most ended up without a wand or in Azkaban if they really were a disappointing matter in the eyes of the pink toad.
scar. He pushed the boy’s hair a bit more out of his face and lay a finger upon the lightning bolt without even asking. Harry didn’t complain; just watched Draco’s every move in silence. ‘I guess you could say it’s a bit similar to yours. It’s a scar that reminds me of how close I was to dying. One of the branches I fell upon nearly speared me; only a few inches deeper and it would’ve gone right through
Not only is Harry Potter standing in his tea room, he also had to bring the
'We know,' Harry answered him. 'We've met a few already.'
Potter let's out a snort. 'Right… I guess I own you some stories about my private life after all I know about you now. At least, what I'm finding out about you.'
'The others?' Harry asked, still a bit mind-blown by the discovery of the book belonging to Snape, Dumbledore's death and Draco's injury he himself had caused.
“What has become of me?” he asks the rose. A teardrop slides off his cheek and he wipes it away with his right hand, not daring to use his left one anymore. Draco lifts his face to look at the sky, and watches a flock of birds fly over the Manor, free to go wherever they want to.
'About that,' Draco began. 'I faintly remember You-Know-Who mentioning something about no-one being able to retrieve the locket from my neck but himself — yet Harry has succeeded in doing so.'
He takes another deep breath and watches how Malfoy sits down again, right hand going through his blond hair.
The girls hadn't been as angry at Draco as the boy had thought; they had rather been worried about him. Some girls had wanted to join him at the library but as they hadn't been able to find him, had started to panic. Panic had spread to the other girls as well and as one, blue group they had roamed the castle in search of Draco. Nobody had seen Beauxbatons' sole boy and out of desperation they had informed Madame Maxime about Draco being missing.
. If Harry would've asked him to twirl down the dance floor like a ballerina, even that he would have done. It was them being together so close once again that made him feel like nothing else mattered beside from the boy. ‘Just as I said;
‘I wish to speak to Fleur, please. It has to do with the Tournament.’
Pink and red spread through black. Draco could try to sleep as much as he wanted but whenever he closed his eyes he saw the colors of flushed cheeks and Harry's bruised lips doom up in the darkness of his closed eyelids. He had been fighting with his blanket, trying to fall asleep but his mind hadn't let him.
,' Draco let out as he took in the room. 'She has added quite a few things since the last time I came along a trip down here.'
, Potter?' he then whispers.
'Of course! They're a gift from your mother,' Harry answered. 'Why wouldn't you?' Draco shrugged as he put on the black one, positioned it a bit right and tucked the other two away in the box again. Almost automatically, he raised his chin a little and suddenly felt like putting his hands behind his back; guide a few girls through the hallway and make sure no Wizard would lay eyes upon them. 'Look at you,' Harry then called out. 'That's the Draco I know.'
Potter shakes his head. ‘I’m sorry, Malfoy, but neither I or any other Auror is authorized to examine Dolohov’s body. It’s currently being examined by a special department for cursed corpses.’
‘There is something I need to show you. Something that will help you with your second task.’
The second of December it was and Draco was seated at the Ravenclaw table as usual. Surrounded by the girls from his school and a few Ravenclaw girls as well, he listened to the words the old Wizard had to say. He cleared his throat, Draco noticed like he usually did, and spread his arms out wide. 'Dear students of Hogwarts and those of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Today, I am honored to announce a tradition to the Triwizard Tournament that once again will be revived;

'Just — be safe, alright? Tell me when things go wrong.'

'Then
"A little…"
,' Draco replied, feeling the boy take his hand in his. 'What's wrong?'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Hermione lifted her head and didn't even seem the slightest surprised to see Draco standing in front of her. She just put on a little smile and gestured for him to sit down with her hand. 'Take a seat, Draco. I wanted to talk to you anyway,' she replied.
Harry shook his head, confusing Dudley even more. 'But — but he said we had to leave for safety. Will he be alright?'
He knew everything they were talking about; added some of his own thoughts into the mix and often got positive feedbacks in return. Harry was even confident that with his help, they would definitely be able to win the cup again this year. 'I'm glad that you're our Keeper, Ron — and not McLaggen,' Ginny told her brother. 'Bet you are as well, right?' She glanced at Hermione, who's mood seemed to be lifted a bit ever since they had arrived at the Burrow.
Orange light filled the Gryffindor common room — the flames of a burning fire dancing against the walls. Hermione was seated next to him, Crookshanks on her lap as she flipped through her third book of the night — Harry no further than through half of his first. They were studying for their O.W.L.s and Harry could feel his eyelids getting heavier and heavier with every line he read. Ron had quit studying already an hour ago; was now lounging on the carpet in front of the fireplace and sorting his Chocolate Frog cards. 'Have you heard anything interesting from Draco recently?' Hermione suddenly asked. It drew both Harry's and Ron's attention and the boys stared at their female friend as if she had awoken them from a deep sleep.
A mermaid's song in the Merpeople's language. Draco had been lucky that he had heard it; it had given him all the information that he needed. When Fleur had opened her Golden Egg proudly in the carriage's common room, the same screeching sounds the mermaid had made erupted from inside. As all girls had held their hands to their ears, Draco had remained calm and had made the connection; it had to be a message in Mermish.

, maybe he did. He did think about the blond a lot the entire week. Of course it partly had to do with his hunt for the cursed corpse department and trying to come up with a cure for his curse. But he had also thought of Malfoy when he woke up, drinking his tea. His thoughts wandered off to Malfoy drinking tea out of the tea cup Harry had given him. And at night, while he was laying in his bed, he had thought about Malfoy as well. He had wondered what it would be like to lay in Malfoy's four-poster bed, the heavy curtains drawn closed and surrounded by the darkness of the blond's room.
‘Harry Potter,’ the voice said. ‘And Draco Malfoy as well, I see.’
. He should've known he'd come, shouldn't he? Yet Draco had been surprised, especially when hearing all the things Potter had told the Wizengamot about Draco. How he didn't identify Potter at the Manor, for example.
'We had no choice,' Hermione added to it.
Harry sighed deeply and gave Draco a nod, one that caused him to squint his eyes.
A few other students seemed to agree with the boy by nodding their heads. 'Must I inform you that mister Malfoy is
had given him a task; a task from a monster he had to obey in order to survive. His mother had been attached to him like a puppet attached to its owner by strings; only saying the things he wanted her to say. How could Draco have thought of her so wrong; how could he have thought she had been so alike to his father? He should've known there had been something wrong; his mother had always been against
Was there really nothing to be found about that place? Wasn't the Malfoy-line one of the most prestige Pureblood ones in history? Surely there would be
And as if on cue; the large doors of the dining chamber swung aside and revealed that same pink devil they had been talking about. You know what they say; if one talks about the devil… The stumpy, chubby and rose figure of Umbridge strode its way towards the professors table and judging by the look on her face; it wasn't to come and eat waffles as well. 'Dumbledore!' she called out, her screeching voice making some of Beauxbatons' students flinch. 'I demand to know why there are six students from Hogwarts in a French school!' She stumped her chubby foot which she had squeezed into the tiniest pink shoe ever and gave Dumbledore a look of pure hate.
Ansel frowned his eyebrows. 'Snitches? Thought you weren't interested in Quidditch,
there for Draco; he simply believed they had been following both him as the others of the family for already quite some time. Molly hadn't even dared to leave the house ever since Halloween, apparently. They had indeed been able to restore most of the Burrow the follows days — but the fire had done a lot of damage that magic simply couldn't fix anymore. Feeling guilty, Draco had left a small purse on his bed's pillow holding a few galleons — as his family had enough to spare.
'What — what does that mean?' Harry asked, his question meant for the word Draco had whispered but his eyes staring at the partying crowd in front of them, distracted.

The tall doors to the Great Hall were closed off and the Champions were told to wait in front of them, kept ready to parade inside and lead the first dance. Of course Draco knew he would see Harry there, but that didn't keep him from safely bringing Fleur to her date. Who knew what could happen in the hallway between the side and main entrance to the Great Hall?
Over an hour had passed by the time Harry slowly opened his eyes again, not having slept for a minute but having pondered to the point where his brain felt fried. A terrible headache was drumming against his forehead and his eyes stung as if he'd opened them in salty water. To his surprise, or perhaps not, Draco hadn't moved an inch — his pale eyes still fixated intensely on Harry. "Relax, Harry," his soothing voice suggested in whispers.
Draco looked down at his wrist, noticing that Seamus had never let go of it. 'Oh, sorry,' the boy mumbled and let go, smiling a bit awkwardly. 'I'm sorry about the other day as well — you know, when we didn't say anything to you. You were—‘
,' Draco responded. He went up the stairs himself, taking in the specks of rain the girls had left behind on each step. Hands clutched around his dressing gown, he pulled the fabric close to his chest. As he reached the top of the staircase, he gave the boy another curious glance before turning himself in the opposite direction.

seventh years and
No-one seemed to be noticing that something was wrong. The seconds of cheers felt like minutes; painful stabs into Harry's heart as he felt like they were cheering for the poor Hufflepuff's dead. Someone then finally noticed, a voice he recognized brought the crowd to a halt. He knew it had been Draco's voice as well as he knew it were his hurrying feet that were making a way towards him. But it wasn't Draco he saw appear in the corner of his eye; it was Cedric's father that collapsed at the sight of his dead son.
How he'd managed to get onto Harry's attic room was something Draco didn't quite understand, but as soon as he'd seen the familiar brown floorboards, he'd let himself collapse and lay down for a few seconds. In those seconds, Draco stopped time — one of the powers only a few angels possessed. It was still considered a
as well; I’ve told you that before, remember?’
But that hadn't been all of it. Waking up in one of the Manor's four-poster beds had never felt so familiar as his father had cast a spell on him that had made his long, silver hair grow back overnight. He had felt it immediately and had seen the silver locks draped over his pillows like they once used to do. It had upset him, and only a few seconds later the locks had fallen to the elaborate carpeted floor; his father throwing another disappointed glare at his short-haired son when appearing downstairs for breakfast. He hadn't tried it again; had somehow given up after a single try. Perhaps his mother had talked him out of it; maybe had told him it was a
At those words, Fleur suddenly seemed fully awake; eyes wide and a bright smile appearing on her face. Every normal boy would have melted at such a sight, yet Draco felt unmoved.
A bright smile appeared on Harry's face and on Draco's as well. The boy reached out his hand to
Who would send him a letter via white owl? Harry didn’t know anyone who owned a snow owl, as all his friend knew what had happened to Hedwig, and therefore wouldn’t even consider on getting one themselves.
All the girls their eyes looked from Fleur to Draco, awaiting an answer. Of course she understood; the smart Witch she was and always had been. Hadn't Draco told her about it? He didn't remember but he probably did. And so he nodded. It was indeed because of his father. 'But because of Harry as well,' he added to it.
A grumble from underneath the hood followed, followed by a sip of a damping liquid. 'It's not my fault, Dolores. Today's Witches and Wizards tend to be on

‘I do know the exact reason… but it’s hard to talk about.’ Draco slid his fingers across his scar and then looked at Harry’s forehead, eyes searching for
But Draco couldn't answer him; he simply wasn't allowed to say anything. 'I can't tell you,' he repeated for what felt the hundredth time. '
Another nod followed as Dumbledore poured the distorted memory of Slughorn into the pensieve. 'Take a look for yourself, my boy. Perhaps you will then understand what I mean.' Before Harry did just that, he glanced at Draco behind him — still aimlessly staring at something on Dumbledore's desk. 'Don't worry too much about him, Harry; he has worries of his own as well which are much greater than you may think.' Looking in the headmaster's bright blue eyes, Harry couldn't quite decipher what the old man was trying to say by that.
'Take me away? To where?' Harry frowned his eyebrows as he went through every possible option in his head. Hogwarts? The Burrow? Draco wouldn't take him to the Manor, would he?
Dumbledore's speculations at first — especially not after your babbling,' she glanced at Harry, reminding him of how hysteric he had been after the final task a year ago with simply a look of her eyes. 'But I do believe your word, Draco — I always have.'
Hermione sighs, looks at Ron and then back at Harry. 'I don't know, Harry. I never heard of a curse like that before. But- But I'll try my best.'
'We're looking for an item — something special like the locket Hermione just showed you. Something that would've triggered
'Certainly someone else will take care of this school; and probably do a better job at it as well,' Dumbledore answered. 'But I believe you don't really understand what I am trying to say, do you?' Admitting to his confusion, Draco shook his head. What else would the man be trying to tell him besides the fact that he was going to die? Was going to leave his precious school in the hands of another? Was going to leave Harry to defeat a monster that was too powerful for him? They would
Go kiss that Ravenclaw captain of yours,' Draco said to her, arms crossed and eyebrows frown. But Fleur ignored his words, wrapped her arms around him as well. She said something to Draco in French, making the boy smile and then took off to join her little sister again.
‘We can, Potter. But am I seriously the only one that reads the spell’s description? For the spell to work it has to be cast by the same wand or Wizard who cast the curse in the first place. I don’t really see
They were one of the last ones to leave the Great Hall, still held into an embrace to keep each other from falling out of exhaustion. 'I think we should go to bed,' Harry finally suggested. He had laid his head to rest upon the blond's shoulder, eyes hazy and tired.
It had all happened so fast, all in such a hurry and a blur that it was hard for Harry to believe it had actually happened. He lay on his back, his head sunken in his pillow and stared up at the ceiling. He held Draco's timepiece in his hand, wondered when Draco would reply to the letter he had sent only an hour ago. With frustration, worry and wonder Harry had penned down all his thoughts and experiences of the past events; of how Draco's prediction for trouble had come true.
Draco only nodded to his words and didn't dare to glance over at Harry again. His cheeks still felt hot and probably remained a blush pink as he left the tent thinking about Skeeter's words. The hug had looked nothing like a loving one, had it? Harry had hugged him because he was thankful that Draco had helped him find a way to fight his dragon, right? Suddenly Draco felt sick to his stomach and didn't feel any better as he took place beside Fleur. Her skirt was scorched at the ends and a few strands of hair had escaped from her neatly done ponytail. She didn't say anything to Draco but also didn't seem to radiate a certain detest towards him for not watching her performance.
‘It does if you want to be, and this time
, right? Draco bolted up to his feet in a matter of seconds. He had to find Harry after breakfast and start making plans with him. If he couldn't help Fleur; he could at least help Harry, right?
Harry opened his mouth to make another comment on that but Seamus hushed him and walked away, done with the conversation. One glance in Draco's direction and the boys both lost it as they laughed at their friend. Harry then closed the space between them and kissed Draco on the cheek. 'I'm glad you're here,' he said to him.
. That's very kind of you, Harry,' Draco said to him with a smile. He reached out his gloved hand for Harry to take. It was funny how he had hated any physical contact with Harry before and now couldn't seem to get enough of it.

But Lucius' dictionary didn't seem to hold that word. 'Do you want us dead?' he scowled, taking an angry step closer to his son.
