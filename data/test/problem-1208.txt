“I will inform Dumbledore of your findings, I assume you wish your personal matters to be left out of my report?”
Remus flushes, keeping his arm wrapped around Sirius and reminding himself that they are grown adults, not teenagers caught snogging in a broom closet. “Yes, well. We were um, rather busy.”
“You see, professor, it’s just been a peculiar week, is all. I see floating heads all the time, by Merlin we have far too many ghosts who enjoy pranking first years with ‘floating heads’ so it's really no big deal and I know I’m about to sound mad because we both know he’s supposed to be in the school but he really never does do what he’s supposed to, so who’s to say if I have gone ‘round the bin or not-”
“He did, Molly.” Narcissa says softly. “He found him, this is real. Your husband is going to be just fine.”
“Let me go!” Potter demands, trying to get free from the goblins that Draco had seen throughout the day. He moved in an odd way and suddenly his bag was ripping, contents spilling all over, including a familiar looking book.
“Nonsense,” Remus shakes his head, “All the teachers agree, and I doubt anyone in this room would say otherwise.”
“Will you tell me your story? Or are you going to let me believe Sissy isn’t as sharp as she used to be.”
He has to say, out of all the situations he’s ever found himself in, this is probably his least favorite.
“Don’t be shrugging at me! If-if you’re gone Misty will be alone again, and Misty….Misty can’t survive like that. We
Three books seem to call out to him, interrupting the peace and happiness he’d been reveling in. Since the nagging feeling won’t go away, Harry rolls off his bed and walks over to it, snagging the three that are demanding to be read, and plopping them on his coffee table so he can get comfortable on his maroon reading couch.
hi! i ended on a bad note, i know, silly Harry. warning for next chapter, there's going to be a sex ed scene. i debated putting it in and in the end i liked it too much to pull it so please look forward to poppy casually making harry want to crawl in a hole and never come out.
he’ll start hexing left and right, but mostly because he doesn’t actually want his friend, possible crush, to have a heart attack.
funny he almost forgot to be mean. Almost. Because the book was by his feet, and with Crabbe and Goyle on either side of him, nothing would stop him from picking it up, except, of course, Potter, still red in the face and huffing.
“You also got it all over the floor.” Blaise chuckles, splashing his feet in the puddle they created. “Our mums are ready for us to go, Pans.”
“It’s blank inside, and when you write in it the letters disappear. Someone else answers, father used to talk to it all night long. Outside it just looks like a normal old, used notebook. With black leather binding.”
For the first time since he’s met her Hermione looks confused. She has Weasley’s head in her lap- something about that is significant he’s sure- and her wand still clutched in her right hand, eyebrows furrowed as she watches LuLu.
“You’re telling me. I’ve got Potions covered, it’s McGonagall’s end of year project that’s going to kill me.”
The last thing he sees of the Dursleys' house is Aunt Petunia’s panicked face and the smell of burned turkey.
“What’s all this? What’s all this?” Lockheart asks, coming up behind them. As if the moment couldn’t get any worse. The blinding spot of gold pulls Harry into him, and Draco would feel bad if he didn’t have to get his note to Snape and then head to his last class. He’s much too busy for this, and why he stoops to this level he’ll never understand, much like he could never get why being mean to Potter was so difficult sometimes.
All Draco can do is glare. He glares while Fawkes comes to see him, he glares the entire week leading up to the first session, and he most certainly glares at the idiots walking in. As if Lockheart isn’t enough, naturally Potter and crew would show. Thank Merlin Draco remembered both his potions this morning.
“Listen,” Draco whispers, watching as his father raises his wand to unlock it, “Behind that door is ten Dementors.”
could cast. Or at least, that’s what he thought until Hagrid had said ‘um’ forty times, ‘right, then’ fifty seven times, and ‘so’ roughly a hundred times. Painful isn’t the right word, but Draco can’t think of anything else to describe Care of Magical Creatures at the moment.
“Sneaking out already? It’s only the first day back….unless you have other motives for coming here alone…..just the two of you…”
Draco can feel his teeth clench, looking around frantically for the idiot staring at a hanging cat with a scared look on his face. And then he sees Granger and Weasley beside him and he understands Potter’s fear. If a Slytherin made the chamber, his enemies would include muggle wizards, people who damaged the ‘pureblood’ name, someone exactly like Granger….A lump forms in Draco’s throat, if Harry is going to be at school during his father’s scheme, the least he can do is help protect those in danger.
Three sets of eyes meet right as the bell to change classes rings, thank everything he’d only missed Potions.
now, isn’t it? It’s not just keeping Harry safe anymore, we’re gonna have to fight our friends and-fuck- our families and he’s not even
She seems pleased by that, tutting ever so lightly with a grin spreading across her little elf face. “Misty is loving Mister Draco too! She is being in the green house, sir! And, Mister Draco’s friend,” She turns to Theo, “Welcome to our home, sir!”
Draco nods, kissing his mother once on her cheek, and then pulling Severus with him towards the darkening water.
especially if he could use the chance to lure them to the light side. And if he goes with Astoria, Harry can take Luna. That’s like three birds, one stone. Perfect.
He’s not really sure how it happened. He remembers stopping for lunch when Narcissa got hungry, he remembers Sirius talking about the renovations and a photographer snagging a picture of the teenagers bickering. He remembers the bad headache he got, Narcissa offering him a potion for it, Draco checking his temperature. He also remembers Blaise mentioning some weird training camp, and then Sirius was asking if anyone was staying over and now here they are.
Classes start back up and if Draco had thought his friends were worried before, he had something else coming.
“And when will that be?” Pansy snaps. Draco’s energy seems to return at the remark, filled with anger and annoyance.
Draco opens and closes his mouth a few times. If he told Potter...he would have to tell him everything. About being a spy, about how he had protected the boy, all the information he knew. It would completely expose him….but. Dumbledore clearly wanted it to happen. Last year, hadn’t he encouraged Draco to befriend Potter? Hadn’t he just told him to be honest? Just because he and Potter had a civil conversation didn’t mean he had to stop being a spy...it didn’t mean anything...him being by Potter’s bedside at two in the morning meant nothing, right?
Unfortunately, by dinner he still has no clue what the first task is, or what secret message Geia is trying to convey. Fleur isn’t there to save him from Pansy bitching about her dress, or Blaise bitching about his Death Garden at home suffering because the water system messed up and one of the repair-people stepped on a bush.
Also peep Narcissa literally going from 'Lucius! You're bleeding what the fuck!' to 'Lucius why in the fuck aren't you bleeding?'
“She’s raving right now, burned the Manor down and everything. In light of the event and her efforts to help us in the war I got her off house arrest. She’s gone to her villa in France, asked me to give you this.”
He quickly shoves one of the bags into a shaken Theo’s arms, grabs his briefcase off the floor, and steers him out of Mrs. Daisy’s shop so they can aparate back to the cottage.
LuLu warms up to him like she’d been personally birthed for his every need. Within an hour it’s like she knows him better than he knows himself, keeping still while he studies, rubbing against him when he begins to get frustrated. When there’s a knock on his door, one he recognizes as his Call for Crucio, LuLu blocks his path, growling.
shop owners, but Diagon is what’s recommended. I’m not experienced enough in potions, hell, I barely know the good ingredients from the bad ones. Carla says she doesn’t count, people like Sal is a little
He has no clue why Cedric is frantically waving at him to stop talking, all he’s doing is trying to calm Fleur down, but Krum is starting to look highly amused also….
I’d like to be able to make them too, but Cho wants something traditional and I have no time left. I also offered to make Krum's, it’d be rude not to, and though he didn’t accept because he’s going traditional, I did find out his color scheme so I can make sure the two of you match, Hermione. Which reminds me,
“We can ask...I just. I don’t want him to deal with any of it anymore. He deserves to be happy, Merlin, Remus, he’s never gotten a chance to have a regular childhood. You know Lily and James would never stand for it. They should’ve run away to Persia when he was born.”
And because Draco has learned his lesson about Professors offering him things to make him feel better, he quickly opens the frog and shoves it into his mouth. Somehow it makes his blood run a little warmer.
“Did you have a question?” Lucius asks, setting down his book. His arm is looking better already, Draco will have to take a close look at it tonight.
Arthur is, in fact, alive and well the next morning. Draco tugs a half-asleep Harry down for breakfast, pausing when Harry’s shocked enough to stop dead in his half alive steps.
LuLu belongs to because she’s so bloody cute. On the forth morning of break, he actually wakes up to her and Hedgwing cuddling by the window and decides to visit Hagrid again after dinner and learn a little more about his sudden new creature friend.
Snape, unfortunately, does not let him sneak into his office when he chews the two idiots out, nor does he say anything more than ‘yes, he’s safe’ and ‘no, you are not allowed to hex him’ followed by ‘get out of my office Draco, it’s past curfew’.
“Ah, you don’t talk much, huh? You the quiet wizard ol’ Sal was talking about? His son, little Willie, was raving about you yesterday, thinks all the younger wizards hang the moon and stars that one.”
The Black side is a little more interesting, but that’s just because of his mother’s Veela grandmother that caused quite the scandal. If it weren’t for the fact that his grandmother is...well the way she is, she would’ve been disowned like her father. Fortunately, Blacks cared about image just as much as the Malfoys did and a reunited child who was stolen by a mad veela sounds better in the Daily Prophet than ‘Black Son Fucked by Veela, Heir to Black Fortune Now a Half-Breed?” Also, if he thinks about it, the disgrace was probably more on the fact that Veelas create light and the Black line is riddled with Shadow Magic. Oh well, either way it’s information he already knows so having to reread it all from family accounts is just boring.
Draco freezes, looks around to make sure no one else is there, although he seriously doubts Dobby would be so stupid to appear where anyone could see him, and then promptly shoves the elf into a nearby closet.
A masked-hooded maybe?- person stands before him, shoving a cloth into his mouth. It tastes like the vinegar cleaner Petunia likes to use.
them, Harry summons four more blankets. His chest aches at the sight of tear marks on their faces, at the way Fred and George have their pinkies linked, how the four of them seem to be touching in some way or another. Be it a Ron’s foot on Fred’s stomach, Ginny’s ankle on George’s thigh, or Ginny’s head on Ron’s shoulder.
“A few things, Draco, are best to be learned about from a civil point of view. Severus has a deep hatred for those boys, he always had. It started back in their first year, as you can imagine, he was not popular among peers. I think in total he had two true friends, and one of them was lost to the group of boys, he called her that forsaken name out of anger once, and lost her forever. That combined with the bullying the boys did has tainted his view on them as people forever, but despite his opinions, I know the truth.”
Narcissa places a hand on Sirius’s arm, “We have a family physician we can contact for you at the drop of a hat, we wouldn’t trust anyone else to take care of him, you,
“Yes, yes I suppose I do.” Blaise sighs, and then he flicks his wand a bit and one of the books on the shelves comes flying out.
him. Crabbe glances at him, biting his lip with worry. “We’re not going to have to ride that thing, are we?” he whispers.
Pansy grabs hold of his arm. Most likely making sure it’s really him and not an impostor. “But what about your family?! Won’t your father be mad? What about your mother?”
“Very well, but until these strange circumstances are uncovered, I’m afraid you’ll have to forgo classes. Oh, and I will be alerting your Head of House of this most unfortunate occurrence.”
“Please,” Granger laughs, “If he’d take it I would’ve forced it on him ages ago. I’ve decided to take him one battle at a time. Right now we’re working on eating.”
Draco’s all but panicking now, his friends aren’t done though. They can see him shaking, surely, but their hands are soft on his arms, and for that he’s thankful.
It’s like the idiot doesn’t even care that people are out to kill him! Doesn’t he know how dangerous it is for him to be here? Draco went through so much, risked so fucking much just to protect his stupid ass, and he’s giving away
to them!” Molly has never looked dangerous before, “Do you think this is a game?! These are my kids!”
.” The girl blushes, Potter on the other hand, seemed very confused about the whole thing. That makes two of them, but before he can ponder over why it’s relieving that Potter doesn’t have someone special, Granger and Weasley Weasley come running and his headache stabs him. This is
Shock, then pure anger crosses both of their faces, and then Granger points out the obvious, “At least no one had to
“That’ll give you a laugh.” He snorts, watching very closely for any reaction. If he could guess who was actually sitting in front of him it would help Snape later. Obviously it wasn’t his friends, they would be rolling with laughter or asking to sneak sweets into their nightly study session. Instead Crabbe’s face morphs into a loosely hidden anger,  Goyle’s into sadness and guilt.
“Language Mister Weasley!” Lupin chides, nodding his head as Draco carefully pulls Harry out of the way. Old reliable Scar Head is gawking between him and his relative like they’ve grown extra heads, or mutated into something curious.
Lucius grimaces, “It’s okay, Harry,” Godric his first name sounds weird coming from the man who’s exclusively called him
Narcissa takes a step back, a smile still unreadable on her face. “We were beginning a new topic when you came in, can I inquire your opinions on it? It’s rather delicate, yet extremely alarming.”
Yeah, okay. Sounds reasonable, if Draco didn’t look like a zombie this past week Harry might even buy into it. Only, Draco looked worse than Hermione. Or maybe that’s because Hermione’s dark skin sometimes hides her bags, and Pansy’s been leaving her little scrunchies that she turns red and gold so her hair doesn’t get as messed up and abused. Bags show up on Draco’s pale skin like ink on parchment paper. His hair is falling a little above his shoulders, which means for the past week Harry’s had to watch him twirl and twist the pale gold locks as he studied.
you?” Pansy immediately starts the second he sits down for lunch. She blocks his left, Blaise on his right, Crabbe and Goyle in front of him. With nowhere to run, and barely any energy to spare, Draco sighs.
tight hug, running a hand through the other’s hair and kissing his forehead for the hell of it. They obviously forget their audience.
He’s honestly surprised that Ron doesn’t protest, but then he takes one look into Draco’s tightly concealed eyes and understands why.
fingers start moving through white hair too, and then playing with Blaise’s hand on top of LuLu’s stomach. He still hasn’t answered the question.
being clever,” Lupin replies, but the tension in his forehead has relaxed a bit, “Until you nosey lot decided to follow me. They waited until Madam Pomfrey left before they came in, and once they knew well….they decided to be good friends. It was your father’s idea, Harry.”
Harry tries to wait patiently, but it’s very dark, they never did put a light down here, and he knows it’s bad to eavesdrop. Aunt Petunia always questions him to make sure he doesn't listen in to her conversations, but he hears his
“Oh it’s you.” The redhead states, like anyone else would be stupid enough to bother Potter in public. “Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here, eh?”
Potter rolls his eyes for the second time and Draco fears he really might give the other boy a black eye before whatever this is ends.
Harry does not, he absolutely does not fume at the idea of Blaise and Draco cuddling in bed with LuLu by their side.
“Although the wards of the castle prevent flooing without permission and no one can Apparate into the building, I can tell you that Honeydukes never closes it’s floo...should you need the information…”
He doesn't plan on getting more than that, but then Howie tells him about a wizard’s microwave, perfect for everything from coffee to potions, and he has one in copper so Draco can’t
“There was someone in the woods!” George calls from where he’s wrapped around Fred, Ginny in the middle of them.
saw Harry again. Stupid idiot cornered him to complain about Ron wanting to ask Hermione to the ball and being sad that she already had a date, laughed at the shit Seeker was spewing, and then squeezed Draco’s arm goodbye. Draco went to dinner, and to run laps with Flint’s overly cheerful ass, feeling slightly better.
His friends make faces at him from his left and right, they had teased him the entire trip down and would no doubt be teasing him the entire trip back. Draco does not squeal when the game starts, but he does get joy from seeing Potter so lost in Cedric’s wake. He is supposed to be watching the yellow Seeker, but his eyes stray back to a certain scar face eyes time. Probably, no, most definitely, because Potter will end up getting hurt. It’s raining, it’s starting to get weirdly cold, lightning blinds them every five seconds, and that is plenty for the idiot to find some cursed way to injure himself. That’s the only reason Draco can’t stop watching him, he’s sure.
But they do eventually end up leaning on one another, LuLu curled up between their laps. Conversation has slowed to a stop and in the back of his mind Draco wonders how badly he lost track of time, how soon it would be until they had to go back- and they did have to go back. Pansy would have his head for being out so late, and he had a feeling Granger would react the same for Harry.
Potter gives him the saddest look he’s ever seen in his life, big emerald eyes staring right through him and into whatever soul he has left. For a moment he’s honestly scared the boy is going to hug him too.
Theo stops by again, exactly two weeks apart from seeing Draco for the first time. He finds Draco in Mrs. Daisy’s shop, in his usual counter seat, head bent over
The only thing Draco could weasel out of her was that she had ‘a friend’ in the Ministry who supported Draco. And
The first thing he does is take a well deserved shower. He kinda smells like snake, and Draco, plus he really needs something to wake him up. Just because Draco slept through most of the night doesn’t mean Harry did. Of course, he gets out of the shower right as the others are heading down to breakfast, which means Ron teases him and Seamus and Dean don’t fully get the joke but laugh anyways. Neville just looks tired, so at least he has that going for him.
All he knows is that one second his brain is calming, Misty is telling him about Monsteras, Salem is asleep in his lap, and then the door bangs open.
what's up, folks? it's 3 am and I have not slept and have been crying my eyes out because everything is fucky wucky so here's a chapter with hella good things! Like luna! I love luna! And Draco being a Disaster Gay! We love a Disaster Gay! We are a Disaster Gay!
“You is coming here because the ocean told you to.” The elf, Misty, tells him. “It called Mistress too, when she was upset, but the bad people came and took her away. Are they going to take you away too, Mister?”
“Helga...her name is Helga….do you think this is a fucking joke Roland? It doesn’t matter if you give Dragons
The man looks over at Harry and softens. “I couldn’t take my eyes off you at first. You look so much like James….I nearly cried until I saw the kid next to you. I’ve seen Peter’s rat form so many times I knew it was him even in black and white. At first I thought I was dreaming, but he was missing a toe and I just knew that little bastard was up to no good, probably waiting for Voldemort-” Draco flinches at the name- “to rise again so he could hand you over and finish what he started all those years ago. I couldn’t let that happen so one night, when they came with food, I transformed and was skinny enough to sneak through the bars. Then I swam away from that bloody island and came here to try and keep that fucker from getting too close. I almost convinced this Crookshanks fellow to help me, but he was worried about upsetting his owner.”
“Oh, you know.” Draco manages, straightening out his robes. “You ever find out that one of your closest friends is gonna die as a Dragon treat?”
Grey meets black and Draco lets out a sigh, the man never asked for the full truth, and that was really his mistake.
“He wasn’t always awful...I honestly don’t understand how he turned into the man he is now...I have all these memories of him just being ‘dad’ not Lucius Malfoy the Death Eater. He was kind, loving, and did everything he could to make me happy…”
One plant quickly turns into several, and before Draco knows it, he’s leaving with three Monsteras, a few Pothos, some Snake Plants
“He’s dealing. It’s hard for him to accept she’s gone, even worse...he screams sometimes in his sleep.”
“Draco, I know you’re going to hex me for this….” Blaise begins, “But should you need someone, even just to vent and then Obliviate, I’m here.”
“Draco. I seldom extend this offer, but given the circumstances, and our relations outside of school, I find it imperative that should you have any troubles, personal or otherwise, you come immediately to see me. It is rare to find a trustworthy friend among spies, but I believe we each fit the role. Furthermore, an old friend used to tell me that ‘bottling up emotions’ is extremely unhealthy, so be careful not to. Not when you can always come to me.”
December came at an alarming rate between classes, his Patronus lessons, Veritaserum lessons, Quidditch, and his friends growing more and more agitated with his secrets. Dumbledore was forcing Potter to stay for Christmas break so he would be safe from Black, and Draco wished he could share the same fate.
strike a weird chord in his chest, something akin to fear, mixed with a little bit of anger. He keeps one hand on his wand just in case.
And because that didn’t put him in a bad mood enough, Rita Seeker’s articles about Harry started releasing on Monday. So every damn day at breakfast the papers were released, and every damn day everyone was talking about it by lunch. Monday had been the story about how awful it was for Harry to communicate with such a dangerous beast, which could only mean that (gasp) Harry is dangerous. Because Harry, the idiot who once looked at a big stupid snake and thought ‘she needs help, lets help her’ definitely doesn’t have a heart of gold and is most certainly evil.
Harry opens his mouth to ask a question, then remembers where he is and shuts it. After a brief pet and a kiss to her forehead, Hedgwing takes off and Harry is left with a toy sized trunk, an empty cage, and a lot of confusion.
Hi! I have some exciting news, one of the fics I've been working on should be ready to post by the end of February. I'm nearly done with it, so as soon as it's completed I'm gonna post the newest chapter of this first and then post that for your viewing pleasure. I'm super excited about it, and I'll tell you all more about it when the time comes, but I have to say it's probably one of my favorite things I've ever written.
By Wednesday, Misty is tired of him going places without her, so they find little places to take small visits to. Her favorites are parks, conservatories, and the zoo. Draco, on the other hand, prefers to get coffee and mule about. Sometimes they’ll go to museums and Draco will explain the muggle objects he understands, sometimes they just walk around and take in the sights and smells. Misty’s been bugging him about seeing a movie for the past week, but Draco’s more inclined to take her to a play first.
Misty is practically bursting at the seams, but she still forces Draco into the wand shop, despite his many,
Hermione’s hair is half done, and Pansy is trying to fix it, but she keeps glaring at him in between spells. Draco’s so mad fire is building around him, Blaise and Theo are scarily composed. The only ones truly unbothered are his godfathers. Even Lucius seems a little miffed.
Draco raises an eyebrow, “I thank you for your kindness, it really does mean more to me than I care to admit, but professor, I haven’t taken anything from your storages since we made the anxiety potion.”
Dumbledore continues, although an uncomfortable look has settled on his face, “Of hiding such information from Harry is to avoid breaking him.”
The flashbacks come next, nailing him to the spot as he thinks of all the other times he’d seen it, of what this
And because he too is suffering the same as his elder, Draco merely nods in pity, steering them both to Dumbledore’s office. They take maybe three steps away from the dinning hall where people are beginning their meal right as Nevil Longbottom of all people rushes past them, straight to the mops of red hair.
Harry sputters at him, “Look! There is nothing going on between me and that- that- that scumbag! I was just happy to see his father in pain is all! Now are we going to the gift shop or not?” He pushes past the other boy, not knowing where he’s going so thankfully Cedric does take the lead again and before he knows it he’s looking at tons of wild stuff, Ron and Hermione snickering over miniature flying Firebolts.
So, instead, Harry begins with dusting. Then he’ll prep the turkey because it has to slow cook for twelve hours. As soon as that’s in the oven he cleans counters so he can clean the silverware, and the table, and the plates. He’ll have to shine them afterwards, but he won’t risk Aunt Petunia’s anger. After that he beats the dust off the couch, cleaning up the living room as quietly as he can. He sweeps and scrubs the floors, and when he’s done with that it’s seven in the morning, which means Vernon will be down soon, so he hurries to make coffee and a quick breakfast.
the stupid thing. And then there’s a pretty tense moment where Draco’s a hundred percent sure he’s going to die, right before Lupin bursts into the room with LuLu hot on his heels.
Draco refuses to throw the tiny box. He’s much too composed for that. He’ll go on a run when Pansy and Blaise leave, if they somehow manage to keep him from getting to his boyfriend because the more time goes by the more hell-bent he becomes.
Draco runs until his body collapses, which leaves him nearly falling off a cliff. By sheer luck he manages to stumble back, fall on his ass, and meet the endless ocean clouded by thick blankets of fog.
“Short is the wrong term, love. You weren’t mean, just overly polite. You forget that those guests were just friends. Sure, they’re not as close as we are, but they cared enough about your well being to turn in early. That counts for something, right?”
Harry barely makes it in the door before the bell rings, and he completely misses how Fleur stares after him with surprised eyes and a small smile.
The worst part about being in the competition is not being able to watch the competition. He wants to know what the others are doing, but he can’t because watching them is apparently cheating, and apparently you can’t do that in plain sight, no matter what Krum says.
His left eye pops open only because he hears LuLu huff and her body weight disappears from his side. Draco sits up with a yawn, dragging the white Kneazle back to his chest before addressing his loud little elf.
This dining room is very different from the one at the Manor. It’s smaller, filled with plants and windows that overlook the sea. The table itself is round, feels closer and more like something a family would eat at. Instead of thirty chairs there are only five. Draco likes it more, not that his personal taste has much of an effect on his home back in England.
Curly brown hair, bright honey eyes, clad in a pale grey business suit and a salmon tie, and standing at a solid 5 feet and 9 inches is Theodore Nott.
Which leaves him sitting in Mrs. Daisy’s bakery, head bent of a pile of papers, on his third cup of coffee, with Theo breathing down his neck.
Draco nods, taking one nervous look over his shoulder, and then turning back to the elf. “The three most important things about all this are?”
He’s not really sure how he knows it, but he opens the door and it’s like being punched in the face with the word ‘yes’.
Crouch gives him an outraged look and turns to start accusing another person, but he can’t pay attention with Harry’s breath on his neck again.
That the professor seems to understand, pointing at Dumbledore’s desk while he flips through a book with a Greek title. “Second drawer on the left.”
. Like he can actually feel his fingers and toes again...amazing! A small source of heat radiates from his side...LuLu, no doubt. He’d spent one too many days in here at the beginning of the semester to forget what the infirmary looks like, if only he could piece together the bits that brought him back to these wretched sheets.
But then it’s back to the Gang’s Room because on Wednesday they all have Transfiguration. The last core class, and in Draco’s opinion the hardest because McGonagall is an even harder grader than Snape.
hi friends! sorry in advance, i feel like all my chapters are late now lmao, i'm having a lot of life changes rn and just in case the links i put at the end of the chapter don't work, my pinterest is Secret Wonderland, yes i have an anime profile.
there? He could just be a figment of my imagination, like a weird twisted guilt for leaving the castle, which wasn’t smart because how am I supposed to protect him if I’m not near him, and it’s not like I can just blink and be back here when I’m at Hogsmeade, and that’s why I can’t figure out how the hell Black is getting in and why he hasn’t just killed Harry yet, like he’s had
“I suppose that makes sense. Ron said she wasn’t a threat, poor thing has been wound up by my feet all morning.”
He gets iron bar stools to go with the iron staircase, the actual seat a plush burned orange shell that’s apparently charmed to be
Kingsley raises an eyebrow and Draco doesn't care in the slightest. He knows it’s a right sight. Draco,
for the snake to get hurt! It’s been two years already, if anything he’s surprised Polly has managed to hold her grudge, but snakes are Harry’s deal, not his. Also a little shady that Polly will hang out with LuLu, his evil little Kneazle, and not him, who is arguably a lot nicer.
His mouth is stretching out in an grin that hurts, he’s squeezing LuLu so hard she’s hissing and-and-
Calm down, he needs to calm down, what would Snape do? Snape would be calm, Snape wouldn’t lose his composure over someone who wasn’t even his friend. Snape would look at the paper in Granger’s hand. Draco eases it out, careful not to let it rip, and then reads it over, filled with information about Basilisks, small bits of information clicking together in fragments of seconds. Potter was a parselmouth,  he probably heard the snake where it went, which is why he’d been at so many of the discoveries. It explained how the first Slytherin had controlled the beast. Why the victims hadn’t been killed, none of them looked directly in the eyes. Granger had even written down how it got around, through pipes.
Draco has no damned clue why she’s on his father’s side. He knows all four of them, himself included, would be perfectly fine with his father going to jail...except he fucking isn’t. Not for this. Not for something he didn’t do while he was trying to help. And why was he trying to help? What was there for him to gain by helping Draco rescue the Boy Who Lived? What was there-
Harry, thoroughly disappointed that the stadium isn’t bigger, slides off her neck and into the nest. The eggs are almost his size, which means he can easily avoid them and find the little golden wannabe tucked in the middle. He grabs it and turns, holding it out so she can sniff it.
“I had come to tell you that Granger has been attacked, but seeing the hour, I assume you already know. What might surprise you is that the girl figured it out. Most of it, anyways.”
“Sirius Black: As Pure As Snow?” He locks eyes with Winky, who nods so excitedly her ears flop, “Black, unfairly persecuted fourteen years ago
Ron and Hermione bid him goodbye at the tents, with them is a weird three headed snake patronus that wraps around him in a weird three-headed hug before vanishing. Draco’s apparently just as worried as he predicted.
“Alright, kiddo,” Remus pats Sirius’s back as he talks, “Today is the crappy paperwork day. We have an agenda of sorts, but we’re going to have to have a few talks first.”
Draco will go mad. Provided he doesn’t kill himself first, and that’s been quite the tempting option since he was fifteen.
He tunes back into the conversation before him, Potter standing on the dueling mat, glaring at Snape, and the beady black eyes smirking at him.
Narcissa is glaring again, but her hair is calming down so that’s a start. Molly looks like she wants to protest, but after last year she’s more than willing to do anything to keep Harry safe.
Draco can’t stop himself, but he does finally have enough feeling back in his body to realize two hands rest on his back. “There have been more attacks?”
She guides him through things Harry kinda already knows. Dragons are big, dangerous, and sometimes assholes. It’s best to get in and out as quick as possible, stay away from their tails and faces, don’t show weapons until the last second. Do not. Absolutely
Finally, I'm addressing my posting schedule because I know it sucks. I wrote chapters like 1-7 before posting them, and each chapter is 20 pages long. I just finished finals, so I'm kinda reeling from the school year and trying to keep up with a posting schedule while mentally fried is not fun (but I'm working on it!) I'm not gonna make any promises, but I will say that the longest wait between updates will be 2 weeks, and I'm trying not to let that happen often. I'll probably still post wither weekly or bi-weekly, but nothing longer than that! If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them and I'll see you in the next chapter!
But, in the spirit of fairness, he’d let Sirius and Remus badger him with questions like they’d been waiting for this moment all afternoon. They were making no sense until Harry found out that his ‘light afternoon reading with snacks’ had been more of a three day thing.
His type is wildly different. He doesn't usually care about height, but he does like his men tan. With nice smiles and enough muscle to end his life if they really want to. For no reason whatsoever, his wet dreams have always included laughter and glowing green eyes. He likes it when a man has witty comebacks, but can be respectful. When they laugh just as loudly as they moan. When they can hold both Draco’s level of conversation and his sexual desires.
Memory Draco is asleep on the wall again, and yes he can see Potter trying not to cry at the sight. Lucius strides in with only his knife, whispering something to make the chains release his body. Memory Draco sits up, opening his mouth as if to say ‘what?’ but it sort of gets cut off by his father’s boot.
Mcgonagall and Hagrid had been one of the few teachers who knew about Black’s connection to the Potters. Fudge was meeting with Dumbledore that night to express some sort of plan about the whole thing. Not to mention that Madam Rosmerta was more of a gossiping school girl than Pansy.
The first is the book on pureblood lineage from Lucius. He’d offered it casually, tucked a note on the inside of it, and told Harry to read it when he felt it was right. The second is the book Luna got him for Christmas last year, and the last is the photobook of his parents.
“Anyone’s better than the current guy, now hurry up, the sooner we shower the sooner we get to go to bed.”
“I did that so you wouldn’t get hurt you giant fuck face! When will you get it through your thick skull that
Another half truth, would they catch up with him one day? He hopes not. Either way, truth or lie, it seems to be enough for Snape.
“Don’t mistake me, Mr. Malfoy, I won’t pry into personal matters so early in the term. Your life outside these walls is not my business unless you choose it to be. Should you decide to talk to me about things, I would be thrilled of course, but given your father, I understand if you don’t.”
Lucius, being a cool dad for once: anyways, this is what happens when you mess with my kid and his friends
Sirius has to cover his ears so they’re not damaged by Draco’s victory whoop. “Really?! You got tickets?! Why wouldn’t I like this?!”
Harry supposes the elf is right. He is older, and probably wiser, than Harry is. They finish breakfast and Kreecher refuses to let him help clean up the kitchen, so Harry makes his way up the stairs to his room.
Harry knows a killer is after him, he knows Hermione is going to kick his ass for this later, but he still follows her down the hill and bloody hell is he glad he did.
Blaise has somehow managed to sit him on what he assumes is his bed, even though he has a death grip on Blaise’s shaky arm and has more than likely been useless the past few seconds. Blaise wipes at the wetness on his cheek, and Draco thanks everything for his friend’s keen sense on how much he
“See, I went to the Black ancestral home today, and while I was there I ran into an old friend of mine, two really. It seems they’re a pair, you remember my cousin Sirius Black and his boyfriend Remus Lupin, right?”
Harry tunes them out, turning to Blaise who offers a game of exploding snaps that Harry is more than happy to play.
The elf speaks, but he can’t listen. Something is very wrong, he feels like something is clawing at his throat, he can barely focus on anything other than the panic clawing at him. However, he is nothing if not a Slytherin to his very core, so he cuts the elf off mid sentence before he freaks out.
“You’re a right bastard.” He manages once he’s covered the taste up by nearly burning off his taste buds. Blaise just grins at him, starting up another conversation about how excited he is to meet his mom’s latest boyfriend,  the one from summer having proved a tad bit too clingy for the woman.
Molly looks between the two of them, and then quickly pulls them in for a hug, kissing both of their heads as she does so.
how you’ve been sneaking around so much! Like an invisibility cloak isn’t enough, you had a fucking guide book as well? Thank Merlin Lupin took it from you, only Salazar knows what kind of trouble you could’ve gotten yourself into!”
“So, no goodbye, then?” He asks, leaning casually against the doorway and pretending like he didn’t just hear Lupin give Harry the map back.
He only has an hour to finish the garden, and yes she’s upset at the idea of him bleeding in her home, so she makes him wash his cut up hands with a ridiculous amount of soap that stings so fucking bad. He winces once, and her response is to slap him, so he does not wince again.
that made him feel less like a monster, but mostly because he’d gotten to see Draco come alive in a way he hadn’t seen since the boy was ten years old and running after fireflies in the gardens. His son had yelled and screamed and cheered when the Irish won, excitedly pointing at Viktor Krum like he hung the moon and stars and Lucius had soaked in every second of it, not bothering to conceal his smile.
“Then surely you know that once a house elf has been contracted, when the wizard they’re bound to says ‘no wands’ they can’t even pick one up without burning their hands?”
Something about that sentence makes him uncomfortable enough to glance at his watch and shudder. Flint will kill him if he’s late to practice, especially if he planned on being at the Halloween fest in the Slytherin common room tomorrow. Excusing himself and making sure to give Fawkes a few good pets before he gathers his things and leaves, Draco ducks out the door and shakes his head. Surely the worry was getting to him. In what world would he and Potter be
“About that…” Harry looks at them, and they’re all a lot more knowledgeable than he is, but he's not ready to give it away. Not yet. “There are things I don't quite understand, I'll tell you about them as soon as I do, so uh, don't be mad, please? I know I did a bad thing, but I swear I didn't mean to, and if I have to wash dishes that's cool or whatever, I'll even dethorn your garden, I just...I didn't mean to upset you all.”
“It can grant people things when they’re in need.” Snap interjects, eyeing the bird. “He’s trying to go somewhere, who could need his help
“Try this one. It’s thirteen inches, Willow wood with Horned Serpent horn core, ’ve only just gotten it in from the States.”
Thursday, like the rest of the week, is hell. Bright and cold and early, Draco sits his Ancient Runes exam, and then spends the rest of his day studying for Arithmancy.
Sirius enters the room first. Clad only in a pair of loose sweatpants, holding his wand up like he’s still half asleep. “Move and I kill-”
Draco listens with wide eyes, picking up his tea just to have something to do with his hands. A descendant of Slytherin, and murked with the blood of a muggle. No wonder he was so vile, but also powerful…
Airs of mystery can bite his ass for all Draco cares. Unfortunately, Theo has him in a bind so he can’t voice this opinion, merely glare ever so slightly as his friend applies mascara and lip gloss.
“Of what? I don’t want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don’t think getting your head cut open makes you special!”
At night they eat a small dinner then shower and lay in bed. Sometimes they go night swimming in the ocean or the pool, sometimes they watch books, sometimes they play with magic. Draco’s transfiguration has gotten a
Harry blinks twice, just to make sure he isn’t seeing things. Only he is, in fact, seeing things, because as soon as the page number left his mouth it materialized on the paper. He couldn’t mistake it, the little number filling in on the top right hand corner as ‘958’, the heading reading
It’s a weird feeling to open gifts with this many people, but it’s a nice feeling. One that Harry decides he likes.
Like, did someone start a fire in the middle of July while he’s wearing a sweater, warm? It’s quite literally
1) From the beginning, in the fic that started it all, when Lucius realizes he hit Draco he freezes and immediately pulls the boy into his arms and says "I am sorry, Draco, I don’t know what’s come over me", trying to explain that his mark is being weird. SPOIL ALERT there's a reason for that. He also makes it very clear that he thinks his son deserves the world, to the point that he's willing to stick his neck out to make sure Draco is in good graces with Voldy when he returns, so from the first chapter of the first fic we know that Lucius Loves His Son, even after he loses it, he sends Dobby to check on him, why? because he's been there, and is scared. Wouldn't you be scared if some evil maniac could possibly return and kill the people you love if they weren't ready for it? Narcissa has managed before, but Draco is just a boy.
.” Lucius says, holding his wand to the masses. He moves in to grab his son, not knowing about the three in the present that follow him out of the room.
He’s going to die. Narcissa is going to kill him. Draco would stake his bet on the chocolate being poisoned if she wasn’t eating it too. But something isn’t right here...why is she so calm? She doesn’t
“Dearie,” Mrs. Daisy starts gently. Never a good sign where Draco’s concerned. “Those are things that
“You know I haven’t, how many times do I have to tell you before you believe me? Father won’t tell me
“Thank you, darling.” Fleur smiles, “But I have to ask, what are you going to do with the boys’ garments?”
The side of his head was beginning to bruise, but he was breathing which was a good sign. Harry made sure to carefully inspect the rest of him, no doubt his ribs were going to bruise too, the whole situation was really extremely strange, but somehow Harry felt like he had been meant to see it, after all if he hadn’t been there, Malfoy would have laid in the room for hours.
Not that having everyone over was a bad thing, he quite enjoyed seeing his friends, but that doesn’t change how hectic it got. Or how stressed Draco was feeling.
“Ronald,” Pansy smiles, all sly and creep. “How personally and intimately would you like to know me?”
“No,” Pansy laughs. She pulls away, all playfulness and kindness fading to the most serious expression he’s ever seen on her. “You guessed right, sir. There’s definitely a connection in there.”
“Yes? Harry needs time to move in and if you’re doing paperwork he’ll probably be tired, Merlin, I don't suppose he’s even picked a bedroom yet, hm? No, he needs a day to get settled and
“Look. What works for me might not work for you, but happiness comes in all shapes and forms. The things I told you help, but there’s also flying your first broom; realizing someone important to you didn’t die and was just being a big idiot; having someone tell you you’re the son they’ve never had. Anything that makes you feel a little less lost, something that gives you a sense of who you are. Those are powerful emotions, Potter. Even if the memories aren’t completely happy.”
Harry nods beside him and it’s then that Draco realizes who’s hand he’s gripping tightly. It calms him, gives him a clearer mind in this mess. After one final nod between the two of them, Draco turns to his father.
Before anyone can reply, and that does include the traitor in his arms, Draco walks away, robes flapping in the wind, Blaise and Pansy scowling behind him. He ignores the green eyes he can feel piercing his back the entire walk to the castle.
“You did say something about a new wand, right?” The kid asks. He reminds Draco of Theo, with big brown eyes, wavy brown hair. The only difference is the kid’s freckles.
The second afternoon Draco finds himself staring blankly into the water, there’s a loud whoosh and an elf appears to tell him people are there. He doesn’t register
Lunch bells rings and Draco almost curses it. “Good luck on your game tomorrow, I hope you give Potter a run for his money.”
“Come on, Draco,” Fuck, is he getting used to Potter using his name? “Think about it! You and ‘Mione are the two smartest people in the whole school! We have a better chance of saving Buckbeak together than we do separately, and you know it. Do you want to save him or not?”
He would puke if he didn’t find the look of pure frustration on Potter’s face somewhat therapeutic. Granted, the face did come with the price of listening to the golden asshole speak, so it was as much of a loss as it was a win. Professor Sprout cut him off before Draco could reach the hexing point.
“Actually,” Blaise muses, “I’d say you are. Flaming, that is. Now can you get out of the way so we can see Harry?”
Lupin spares a glance at an angry Snape, wincing a bit before saying, “They decided to become animagi, so I wouldn’t have to spend the moons by myself.”
“I get it, okay? I get what she’s going through. For the first ten years of my life I was forced to live in a small cramped space, I was bullied and starved and hurt by the only people I had the chance to interact with. She had friends, and they were taken from her just like my parents, Sirius, and Remus were taken from me. Riddle did the same thing to her that my aunt and uncle did to me. And even though she thought he was her friend, all he did was force her into a world full of death and misery against her will, just like me! She doesn’t deserve to be hated and- and fucking
Crabbe and Goyle let out screams, it’s only then that he realizes Buckbeak has lost it. Raised on his back legs, talons on the air.
Draco almost winces at his friend’s expressions, even Crabbe and Goyal are looking at him like he’s announced he is secretly a muggle. Pansy’s mouth hangs wide open, Blaise’s eyes narrow and disbelieving. Flint is acting like he’s gone crazy.
Draco returns to the cottage with all his items in an expanded shopping bag. He deposits Salem next to Misty, slightly worried that she still hasn’t moved from her spot on the living room, staring out into the ocean like she too is considering stepping over the edge.
Her back is turned just enough for Lucius not to see the way her eyes glimmer into daggers. The smile on her face seems more like a threat than the angry magic that’s starting to radiate off of her.
The boy turns around with a big smile, Fawkes burrowing into his warmth. “Sorry, Headmaster, I did actually come here to see you, I just can’t believe I haven’t come and seen Fawkes since his rebirth.”
But that sounds a little creepy, plus Blaise always checks addresses and Draco doubts that his friend would want to visit a house that’s on record as destroyed with possible ghosts. The second that Kingsley stops finding that joke funny Draco’s making him change it.
“You really are a handful, do you know that Potter? Hopefully I’ll get to take some of this frustration out on you eventually, not nearly as much as I’d like to, but enough to pay you back for the small things. Maybe one day you’ll listen to my warnings…”
“Be careful, I’ll cover for you, but you must be back before sunrise, or Father will notice that someone else prepared his breakfast. While you’re gone, I’ll see if I can come up with something to slip you past the wards so this is all a little easier. Okay?”
That seems more believable for him, heads that had turned rolling their eyes and looking away. All accept the four idiots in front of him, particularly the stupid boyish grin Blaise gives him.
Snape disregards him completely, striding over to Malfoy and lifting his chin, going over several assessments. Harry brings more bandages and warm water; Dumbledore instructs him to clean the cut on Malfoy’s arm. It’s in the same spot as his wound from Buckbeak...he washes it gently, listening closely to the conversation above him.
Theo turns around to look at him, smiling like Draco’s never seen him smiling before. “Draco...it’s...it’s really good to see you, to know you're alive and all that. You seem...happy. I don’t think you’ve ever been happy before.”
Draco shoots the two men a look before sitting down and having tea thrust into his hand from Snape. Dumbledore sighs deeply, taking in the condition of both the student and head of Slytherin.
From the first year to this one. Naturally the two dorks hadn’t believed him, so he brought out the Pensive and it was all downhill from there.
Draco gasps. He takes two steps between them, not entirely sure when he even stood up, closing the distance and gripping Theo’s arms rather harshly. “No you don’t. You
“Will you get on with it?” Ron groans. He gets a single manicured nail salute before Pansy continues.
Harry, who's never been on a roller-coaster but has heard about it from Dudley enough to know it would make him shit his pants: for fun?
Helga raises her head and Harry is suddenly eye level with the judges. He winks at Dumbledore, and the Helga takes flight.
Ron tells them about his morning, how he woke up super early because he was planning on surprising Harry with a ridiculous banner, Harry was completely right about the tail-jokes, but then Dumbledore sent a note saying to meet him in the headmaster’s office, so he went, thinking he was absolutely in trouble for the one joke about eating the other champions’ ‘tails’. But when he got to the office Dumbledore was as cryptic as ever, going on about friendship and loyalty and how valuable he was, which was great for Ron’s ego until
She’s the one who looks like she could use a good nap right now, and with finals right around the corner, they probably all could. Somehow, the bags under her eyes are just a bit darker than everyone else's.
“Then it is settled! We have come to an agreement, now you must excuse me, I have a meeting with Severus in roughly five minutes, I would assume he is not going to be pleased that I divulged so much of his personal life to you.”
A sudden thought strikes him. During the summer, when his father had boasted about having one of Tom Riddle’s diaries. He hadn’t even known how it was related to the Dark Lord, he thought it was something stolen and later filled with dark magic...he hadn’t known…
“It’s safe.” Is all she says, and then Draco peeks his head in the room, as if making sure no funny business is happening. When he spots them a smile breaks out onto his face.
“If you wish to help…” Malfoy begins, “Then stay here. At Hogwarts. I’m sure Dumbledore wouldn’t mind, and it’s the safest place in the world. Plus you could see me and Potter whenever you wished.”
For whatever reason, Kingsley has started coming around noon, spending half the day with Draco, and doesn’t leave until eight at night. Usually it’s because Kingsley is updating him on the world he left, telling him about the Ministry, how his mother is doing, any weird happenings that Draco might have insight on. It always feels a bit like saying goodbye to an old friend when he leaves, but Draco doesn’t mind, because he has Misty and Salem.
They all wave ‘goodbye’ and throw their caffeine back like they’re alcoholics on free shot night at the Three Broomsticks. An hour later and Harry is asleep again, leaving him and Granger crossing off yet another idea from their master list.
“While it is fortunate that he was able to prevent Arthur’s death, he shouldn’t have been there in the first place. His shields are too strong for
and didn’t kill him? He’s had so many chances, and if he is as good of a killer as people make him out to bed, wouldn’t Potter be dead by now? I don’t get it…”
And Harry hates to make his boyfriend wait, but some things cannot be ignored and this is one of them.
“I dunno who managed to get rid of Crabbe and Goyle,” Weasley says as he settles into the seat by the window, “But I say they deserve first hand in Exploding Snaps.”
Second year proves to be a lot for the man to handle, though he does laugh when Draco tells him about the Valentine's bullshit Lockhart pulled. They agree Azkaban is a lovely home for him. After assuring him that yes, Potter did beat Voldemort a third time, Sirius is practically glowing which leads Draco into the current year of bullshit, where instead of old Lizard Face he was facing a killer.
And then Lucius wraps his arms around his son to whisper a thousand apologies. “I am sorry, Draco, I don’t know what’s come over me. My mark burns everyday, the Dark Lord will no doubt return soon, and I need you to be on his good side when he does. I will not see my son tortured by even the most powerful of men, you must forgive me for losing myself at the thought.”
Helga comes out angry, cursing and speaking so fast Harry has trouble catching up with her. But when she spots him there’s no question about what she was saying.
Katheriene claps her hands together, smiling between Pansy and Harry with an obvious plan in mind. “Pansy, dear, this is a perfect opportunity.” Harry feels like he’s about to be apart of a weird science experiment. Katherine steps forward,  pulling Pansy to her side so two very similar eyes can look at him in a terrifyingly similar way.
“Of course, if it were me, I wouldn’t be acting like a good little boy such as yourself, I’d be out there looking for him. Nothing says revenge like a dead body, Potter.”
Watching the back retreat until he can’t see it anymore, he has only two thoughts. One, he really needs to get to Snape. Two, he really hates his father.
Harry shakes his head, opening his mouth to explain that he could have prevented the fiasco entirely, but he’s interrupted by the sound of running.
His own room has the same ceiling to floor windows, the same silky white sheets, as many pillows as he wants in his king bed.
Narcissa manages to corner him the day before he left. He’d been reading the last chapter for his summer History of Magic assignment, casually sprawled out in a patch of light coming through the library windows, willing himself to be ignorant of the plans his father had for him that evening. How the bastard convinced his mother to let his ‘training’ continue he’d really like to know.
And when Harry snatches the Snitch right of his hand, he can’t even bring himself to care about losing the cup because it means he can finally get some fucking sleep. The six of them agree not to meet the night of the final game. Draco takes a long, hot shower, puts on his most comfortable pajamas, locks his curtains, and sleeps until Blaise’s shouting wakes him up.
Well, it was nice while it lasted. Misty follows him and the goblin to the private meeting rooms, which might be a mistake because this is surely it. He’s about to be shipped back to the Ministry, thrown in Azkaban, and there won’t be a single damn thing Kingsley or Potter can do about it. On the plus side, maybe he can pester the Dementors into giving him a kiss once he’s back in his cell.
It’s been a while since it was just the two of them, so Harry reaches out to pet her, opening the book from Lucius first.
Or maybe he shouldn’t be surprised at all. Draco quickens his pace and arrives to the two at the same time Lupin steps into the light supplied by Snape’s wand.
For a moment he’s genuinely shocked, but then a smile spreads across his lips and he finds himself shaking her hand.
Howie just smiles at him. “Keep the paper if you’d like! Mister Griphook said you’d like to have your own copy, oh! Tell June ‘hello’ for me!”
Nagini hisses again, but Harry is to gobsmacked to do anything about it. Draco shoves him forward, which seems to startle some life into him.
Memory Draco looks bad, he’ll admit. The boy can barely walk, but he still stumbles up the steps, leaving a trail of blood behind him. They make it to the dungeon door, and out into the Manor. A clock tells them it’s exactly one in the morning, his father goes to bed every night at eleven. Draco sees himself grab his wand, a handful of floo powder, and then hears his dead voice whisper ‘Honeydukes’.
“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” Draco says, hoping that something was actually there, preferably notes so he wouldn’t have to invade privacy, or turn him in to Dumbledore.
By October of his final year, he was straying from his routine. Straying from safety, security. Taking any risk he could because he couldn’t bear to walk down those halls and not
And now he’s here, half naked in a dying house, wondering if she’d still smile at him after everything. If she managed to make it to Japan, if she was caught, or if she was-
Before he can make up his mind, the boy in the bed answers for him. “Lemme guess, going to save me from another Dementor attack?”
. Is that clear? Furthermore you should know that signing these types of contracts are extremely serious and cannot be broken once your blood is on the page. You’ll each need a copy of it and not, once it is signed you cannot change the contents but it will aid in your safety and I am willing to risk others for that at this point-”
They chuckle again, all too tired from classes to bother moving, besides, the warmth from either side of him is grounding.
Harry bloody Potter is supposed to be locked in a muggle bedroom, safe and very far away from the Wizarding World, not posing for the bloody Daily Prophet. He’s fuming for more reason than one the entire time Lockheart is speaking and maybe it’s the fact that he feels guilty, or the fact that Potter is not fucking supposed to be here right now, or maybe even the snotty voice grating on his ears. He’s really unsure why he does it, but there he is, sneering and snarling out some remark he can’t take it back.
this is stupid, but he’s hasn’t been meeting his yearly quota, and Hermione’s already pissed at him so there’s really nothing stopping him from adding to his Stupid Life Choices.
Snape’s hand comes into view, Hermione must be holding him down then. Pettigrew is no where to be seen. “Draco. Calm yourself or you’ll upset your wounds. Sirius will not let him get hurt, and I have three injured students and a real criminal on the loose. Lupin took his potions tonight, he will not kill even if his wolf wants him to.
Mr. Crouch turns a cool gaze on him and Draco doesn’t back down a single centimeter. “Doesn't have his wand? You expect me to believe Lucius Malfoy went somewhere without his wand? What type of fool do you take me for?”
“Oh, Draco,” Theo looks up, his eyes brimming over with fondness, tears, and disbelief alike. “You’ve been gone for so long….you’re-” He takes a deep breath, “You’re
They go in, Sisily makes tea, Draco takes his place on the couch between his friends, LuLu protectively in his lap. Narcissa sits opposite to them. No one speaks for the longest time, he has this unshakable urge to reach out and hug her again, to sit next to her, or in her lap like he did when he was little. Just to be close.
So maybe that last part was a lie. Not that it matters to Draco who sprints to open the door, pulling his mother close only to realize it’s Severus he’s captured in his arms.
“Family?” Sirius blinks a few times, looking at them for a moment before he’s rushing forward. “Harry! What are you doing here?” He asks, even as he throws his arms around Harry and drags him in for another hug. “Molly? Love, if you wanted to bring the kids home early, you could’ve told me-and where’s Hermione? Blaise? Pansy? Theo?” He pauses when his gaze meets Lucius. “Where’s Sissy?”
“They were at our house a lot over summer, sir. I couldn’t go anywhere without running into one, eventually I guess I built a resistance.”
In response the sea blows wind through his hair. Not that he really cares. His hair is a lost cause at this point. After Azkaban he’d given up on the matted tuffs, the frayed ends, and the lost shine. Thankfully there are no good mirrors in this stupid fucking house.
Neither of them laugh at his joke, another very weird thing. He brushes it off as them being a little too full to think, trying to ignore Snape’s warning in the back of his mind. They reach the common room gate, and just because he’s paranoid, he turns to Goyle.
Dread and anger filled his every atom. Harry Potter had Tom Riddle’s diary. The fucking Boy-Who-Should’ve-Died had the book that started all of this shit. He was three seconds away from grabbing his wand when the Female Weasley ducked her head. Blushing, looking at the book with wide eyes, horrified and embarrassed.
He gets a grand total of six hours of sleep before he’s dragging himself out of bed and to breakfast. Theo, surprisingly an even bigger plant person than Blaise gushes about how excited he is. “I’m a plant gay, you know?”
Charlie introduces himself to the others, explains that baby versions of the real dragons are going to be chosen from the box. Naturally Harry ends up with the most dangerous, the Hungarian Horntail. At least he knows her name.
Anyways, hope you all are safe and having fun times! love you and let me know if you appreciated the chapter <3!
Blaise raises an eyebrow at him and fuck, he really did just say that in front of at least five people, not to mention the Great Hall is filled with listening ears and prying eyes. Draco quickly amends.
Draco and Ron are a few feet away from the girls, playing Wizard’s Chest with his mother’s antique board.
be at the end of an angry snake. Before he could explain, Lockheart pointed his wand at Polly and the snake flew into the air with a loud bang. Draco gasped, whirling to raise up a storm at his pet’s treatment, only to see Polly hissing angrily and starting to some Hufflepuff, probably to strike.
Draco watches as they flee, noting that the two heads turn from brunette to black and red. Only two people in the entire school could be dumb enough to get caught while using a polyjuice potion. And only one witch was smart enough to make it and almost get away with it. He gives them a few minutes to get in the clear, and then heads back out to fill in Snape.
Instead of wondering down that rabbit hole, Draco pauses with Hermione mid-step. “Harry, Ron, do you two really not have dates?”
Remus, which reminds me, you should probably just set up a session for all three of you so everything is on a file...just in case. I’ve included a list of floo networks he might find useful and the pronunciation because Draco said he struggles sometimes.”
Harry’s seen a nature documentary in his life. He recognizes the look of sheer joy in Narcissa’s eyes that means whatever prey she has her sights on is about to die, and he’s kinda excited for it.
you, and Ginny! You can’t lie to me! I watched you in Foe Glass, you would’ve died if Fawkes hadn’t healed you! She’s not safe.”
“A perfect time, no less,” Dumbledore’s bitterness almost draws a laugh out of him, “Do tell me who it is.”
“We disowned him and refused to associate with him,” Draco clarifies, already laying on Pansy’s lap so she can play with his hair.
Draco ignores the fact that he hasn’t been able to feel anything since Snape brought him back from the pensive. He flat out refuses to acknowledge that he’s at a breaking point because if he does that…
“You can say that again,” Cedric sighs, “But Harry...we’re all lumped into this, okay? You’re competing just as much as we are.”
“We found anxiety and pain-relieving potions under your bed last year, and now there’s blood replenishing ones there too.”
As punishment for not paying attention and getting caught, Vernon exiles him to his room for the evening, no food, no water, not even his wand.
Draco whirls on the spot, wand raising, already stepping in front of his little elf friend, and finds...a blue form of a woman?
Not as a ‘let’s join the Golden Trio’ bullshit! I still think we need to take you to Madam Pomfrey and get your head looked at.”
Lucius smiles at him and Godric it’s such a weird sight. Nice, but still very strange. “Yep. We’re just doing this to see if it feels the same. On three. One. Two. Three-”
Three piercing eyes glance at him while he glares at Pansy who gasps at the words that have left her mouth. Blaise keeps his hands over his lips, eyes wide and a little scandalized. LuLu just blinks as though this should’ve happened ages ago.
Also Draco, during any form of test: if anyone other than Hermione beats my score I'll be killing part two
Tall, tan, with dark messy hair and weirdly blue eyes. A smile that’s a little coy, a little hopeful. Straight teeth,
“Ah, Remus already has him, I just wanted to get the papers so we can get all the paperwork over today.”
He’s finally released so Theo can pick apart his hair, a feat that’s constantly interrupted by the ocean’s winds coming through the window.
Blaise had accidentally pushed him out of a tree, and he’d been so angry about it that he set the tree on fire. Subsequently, Belle didn’t bat an eyelash, and that’s exactly how his mother and his best friend’s mother became so close.
For a while neither of them move. They stand in Harry’s bathroom that’s too big for comfort, so close that Harry might as well be a leech.
Never in his life had he made his mother angry. Annoyed? Of course. Frustrated? That’s a given. Sad? Due to recent events, likely. But never in his whole life has he seen the dark look that crosses her face directed at him.
To top things off, Flint and Cassius, the evil little bastards, decided to make the old team ‘brush up on drills’ last night, which is code for torture on a lesser degree, and also means Draco didn’t get back until ten minutes after curfew, was freezing cold, and still had to help Blaise with his Potions assignments.
They walk in silence for a bit, LuLu between them and perfectly content, if only he could say the same. One glance, all it takes it
Vernon is all force, no precision, no thought into his movements. He lashes out randomly, worse if Harry doesn't obey the rules. Aunt Petunia is the exact opposite. She likes to know how much he can handle and force him past that. They make it to seventy-five hits, repeatedly in three particular spots, the middle of his butt where it will hurt to sit, the back of his legs so it will hurt to stand, and the base of his spine because his aunt is a bitch.  By fifty Harry’s vision is swimming, by sixty he’s crying, and by seventy he’s having trouble counting.
too complex for Draco to fully understand what any of it means. It has precise heating charms so food never burns, whatever a double oven is, a griddle and an unbreakable glass stove top, a lot of knobs and buttons that confuse the fuck out of Draco, but it’s copper, will go with the rest of his apparent theme, and it might make Misty smile.
The best way to get to know your enemy is by studying them, and then form a plan of action. Naturally, Harry Potter turns out to live a rather miserable life that leaves Draco questioning Dumbledore’s sanity more than he usually does. Three muggles live with Potter, and Dobby described the kid’s situation to be 'similar to Dobby's, Master Draco!' But simply taking the boy’s mail had not been enough to derail his need to return to the school, and given that only two weeks are left, it is time for Dobby to interact.
like that muggle Santa Claus character. Well, maybe Santa Claus if the character’s beard wasn't so bloody long.
They didn’t come to him while he was capable of making reasonable decisions. No, they cornered him while he was in the middle of his first cup of coffee, half asleep, and lured into a false sense of security provided by Mrs. Daisy’s freshly baked scones.
Ron visible pales. “Does he think he can win or something? Because your dad is kinda smart, I might have to go all out.”
Malfoy turns to Dobby, “Get out of here. I’ll find Dumbledore and talk to him later, stay in the kitchens until I find you.” The elf looks like he wants to protest, but Malfoy shakes his head.
“Alright! Alright! I’m sorry I was reckless and got hurt, you can complain to Professor Lupin tomorrow.”
Surprisingly, when they’re not busy insulting each other, the two of them get along swimmingly. Granger leads him over to a desk with notes piled as high as a text book and they pointedly ignore everyone else in the room to dive head-first into them. Sometime during all their debate on whether it would be worth pointing out that Buckbeak was only reacting to his natural instincts, the rest of their weird combination had piled around. He does note that Weasley and Harry stay closer to Granger and Pansy and Blaise stay close to him.
“Leave me out of your letters, please. I can’t have her knowing anything, it could put her in danger.”
Harry steps closer to him, “He doesn’t, sir. If he had his wand, he would’ve taken Draco away the second those masked men started doing...whatever the hell they were doing.”
“Sorry if I scared you, I guess I should’ve warned you.” He says quickly, pulling away and noticing the lack of cups. “Where is everyone else?”
Draco shushes him, rubbing his back like Ron had. “I’m getting to hold my boyfriend, why on Earth would you apologize for such a thing?”
Memory Draco does not get up, as a matter of fact, Real Draco is almost positive Memory Draco is knocked the fuck out, but that doesn’t stop Lucius from beating him awake only to punch him back to sleep. Draco doesn’t bother hiding it from Potter this time, he thinks about it when his father grabs Memory Draco’s lifeless arm and puts a dark blade against his still bleeding wound, but the worst was surely over.
But Harry is gone. And Draco is standing in the bathroom with a giggling Myrtle, a headache, and a need to fucking shower.
“I cannot heal the wound on his arm with regular magic, I will need water and bandages. Lots of them.”
Eventually they do sit down, and Draco lugs over two blankets for them both. LuLu makes a bed in the middle of them, purring with every gentle stroke he gives her. Harry keeps his eyes on the sky and no one can blame him.
Narcissa steps between them, holding her hand out for Harry to shake. “Closet? In the nicest way, love, you don’t have much of a closet to go off of. When Sirius owled me last night Lucius had to stop me from sending you clothes then and there. On the plus side, this is a perfect opportunity to test the waters, hm?”
He hasn’t the faintest clue about what just happened, but Misty is still crying, and Salem is clawing up his leg.
Harry tries to dislodge his arm. He really makes a few token attempts, but this woman has a grip of steel not even Hermione can save him from.
I apologize in advance if this chapter is kinda messy, I wasn't planning on writing the scene with Hermione, but I got a comment and I wanted to try and clear it up? I'm also offering a kinda analysis at the end for anyone who's confused.
to think about, but he got it at the cost of having to kill a professor at the ripe age of eleven. A repeating theme, of course, because he gets to go back to the wonderful magic world, but only if he endangers his best friend’s little sister. He gets to make friends with his enemy, but only if he realizes that his parents were betrayed by one of their closest friends.
She takes it to eighty, kicking him out of the kitchen so his tears ‘won’t ruin the food of my good guests’.
hunted down Potter and begged him to stand trial- even though that was apparently happening regardless of what
Theo nods his agreement. “He’s a bit of a...tough person to manage. Not very agreeable, not kind, and
Snape, to Flitwick after finding out about Flora: if you wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on, but you're gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets, you don't even know my real name-
“Pans!” Blaise and Draco shout at the same time, which isn’t their smartest move because it only spurs the redhead on.
Witches, wizards, and humans surround her, try to rip her apart, scream and poke with knives. They can’t hear her pleading with them. And then, a familiar man stands in their way.
A sad attempt at a smile leaves him struck with dread. Anything that makes Dumbledore sad is either a very big deal, or a very big threat.
As soon as that’s done he doesn’t even eat. He blinks once in the classroom and then he’s being cornered by a girl that looks a lot like Daphne, only she’s wearing Ravenclaw robes, so it must be Astoria.
Nothing happens, so he waits, wand drawn and ready to strike. And then, to his utter astonishment, he hears a weirdly familiar sign and Harry Potter is appearing out of quite literal thin air.
Only Pansy is nowhere to be seen, and he ends up staring right at Harry curled up in one of the armchairs. That softens him up, partly because
Alice, the woodshop owner, asked for help in her displays. The Leopard Print Guy, Charles, asked how to stop scaring customers away. Plant shop owners wanted to know how to contact more nurseries, how to obtain rare plants. Those beauty shop workers that Draco still doesn’t like wanted to know how to appeal to more people. Even the
Houses belonging to pureblood families have their own magic, a different magic suited to the family’s magic that lived there. After all, most pureblood manors were built from scratch back in the old days, it only makes sense that those wizards and wizards yet to come would perfect it in every way possible, molding the house’s magic to respond in kind.
Potter to get Wolfsbane legalized. They’re planning on forcing whoever wins the Minister seat to make dispensaries for werewolves, where they can get their potion for free and pay a reduced fee for any therapy that might be needed.
“Sure.” Harry mumbles back, but then Geia hisses something from the pool and his eyes open. “OH wait. Oh-” Red flourishes on his cheeks and here Draco was thinking his eyes couldn’t get any greener. “Hello, um, good morning, I guess.”
Hello! I forgot to tell you all last chapter, but I do feel okay! My coworker got covid and very kindly spread it around to every last one of us. I'm pissed at her, but I basically did a speed run of covid where I felt like shit for three days and now I'm just waiting for my quarantine to end. I'm not a patient person and I have to give myself little projects so I don't go stir crazy, so I've basically been writing two wips, this one and another surprise one I'm not posting until I'm done, playing the sims, and getting to know my plants on a personal level.
Draco takes a seat, Fawkes greets them both before they settle in with tea and somehow spend the next two hours recounting their previous night to an asshole of an old man. Neither of them bring up the Astrology tower, Harry willingly goes along with the lie that he walked the boy straight back to his dorm. Somehow it makes the whole thing seem a lot more intimate than it really was.
