“I would have never thought we would be all together like this again, you know. I am so happy! Even if the circumstances are a bit weird…” Scorpius giggled and offered two glasses of champagne to Draco and Harry. Then, he levitated a glass for each person.
Apparently, it wasn’t the right thing to say.
Draco crossed his arms at his chest. “You told me that you were writing a book,” he said in mock offense. “It was believable; all the papers talked about your imminent book!”
No wait, it was Harry’s birthday, he shouldn’t be the one providing food.
He nodded to Malfoy, then disappeared to the nearest drinks point.
Potter grasped Draco’s thighs tightly and pushed them back, opening his mouth to swirl his tongue around Draco’s cockhead, repeating the movement once, twice.
"Fine. Harry, take at least four flasks of potion with you. And yes to what you said earlier, I heard you, bring your Cloak." And added, muttering in that way he only used talking to himself, “and I still don’t know, how is it possible you even own one of those!”
How do Draco's relationships hold out under detention with Umbridge?
He refused to patrol that night.
Draco grimaced. “Unfortunately.”
He’d succeeded.
Montague shrugged. “Don’t know really. Snape said he took care of it when I asked, but he didn’t say where he put it. Storage somewhere probably. Though I’d be happier if it was off the grounds to be honest. Don’t want those twins to use it on someone else.”
The girl-Lovegood, kept talking through the handshake, ignoring Draco’s hesitation. “I know you, Draco Malfoy. You can call me Luna. Even if you don’t want to talk to me next year you can always send an owl now you know my name. Not many people want to talk to me.”
They started the act by going to the Yule Ball together. Draco figured it had been successful. She didn’t whinge about him paying attention to Potter and she didn’t step on his feet when they danced. She’d only rolled her eyes and complied when Draco asked her to move her head slightly so he could get a better view of where Potter was sitting with the Weasel. In thanks, after Potter had left, Draco had let her off to dance with a couple boys from different schools.
Theo smirked through a greeting to Draco before turning to talk to Greg in the seat next to him. Draco would never admit it but Theo made him a bit nervous. They grew up in all the same circles, Theo also being a member of the sacred 28, but his father was a bit older than Draco’s. He easily could have been the so-called ‘prince of Slytherin’ had he put in more effort and tried to out-maneuver Draco. Instead he kept to himself, preferring to keep to the edges of Draco’s crowd and spend most of his time in his studies. That unnerved Draco. If Theo challenged him outright he could fight back and then it’d be done, but the way things were, it made Draco expect a knife in his back -- despite having now completed four years with no real problem.
see the thestrals now, which was frankly a bit baffling but also extremely good insight into how thestrals worked. Draco had taken to looking up existing thestral information in the library when he finished his homework early, but it was so incomplete that Draco could hardly believe it. Luna was now doing in-person studies with permission from Hagrid (whom Luna had forbidden him from calling an oaf while writing her).
Draco had little idea what Luna was talking about, but he was in a good mood and decided to play along. He clucked his tongue. “Why do you think it’s his parents and not him?”
Draco nodded, but as she’d turned to walk back to her office he couldn’t help calling out. “Wait!”
And he was worried. He couldn’t help it as it came over him looking at Potter’s friends. This was who he had on his side? These were the people helping him? If Potter had taken his hand he could have had Draco! Draco would have given anything!
The longer it went on, the more the praise started to sound like a rushing wall of noise that Draco could hardly even parse. Everytime the panic filled him, he’d freeze where he sat, staring off in the distance until Pansy or Blaise did something to knock him back into reality.
clear. I don’t need
At one point, a second year Gryffindor had passed by, on a dare from his friends to find the kitchens. Draco had been so irate he’d reduced the boy to tears. He spent the rest of the time waiting trying not to feel bad about it while staring at the notebook waiting for Luna’s message.
Draco let himself fall back against his pillows as well. “It’s not. You can believe me on that.”
Draco fell back on his pillows to think about the rest of it. He knew Luna wouldn’t mind the delay. He couldn’t actually go. That wouldn’t go over well. The glare on Potter’s face last time Draco wanted to help proved that. But a secret from Umbridge would be just the sort of thing that would help Draco feel better about being unable to stop her from torturing Potter. He sat up and wrote back.
Going into third year, Draco had hoped that he would be able to take at least one class without Granger in it so that he could be top of that class, only to have his hopes dashed and a punch in the face as a cherry on top. Even if he and Granger got exactly the same grade, the teachers always put Granger first because of his father’s animosity toward the headmaster. Uncle Severus was the only one to do otherwise, so he had managed to take the top slot in potions on occasion, but keeping that spot for any amount of time was incredibly difficult, yet his father wasn’t impressed.

Pansy smiled and returned the gesture.
victory on his tongue. He could
Blaise leaned in further in interest at Draco’s offer. Pansy, however, only glared at him. “Let’s hear this new favor first. If it’s another late night tonight, no glamour in the world could hide the sight of me passed out on the floor.”
He felt a hand on his arm and looked over at Luna. He could still feel the steel in his eyes. Luna was smiling a soft, secretive smile. “You wouldn’t be doing this if you weren’t.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That particular tower was especially dangerous for Slytherins, even if it was a prime spot for catching a misbehaving Gryffindor. Gryffindors tended to run in packs and a lone Slytherin Prefect was always a good target.
. Merlin, if it was Potter Draco would never be able to concentrate.
Draco thought he might have landed one or two of his own, before being completely overcome, pain blossoming from every inch of him as Potter and the Weasley twin attacked him in a blind rage. Potter ended up near his face. Draco was able to get a close up look at his eyes before his head was slammed backwards and his own vision grew hazy.
Draco gave an impossibly dry laugh. “Well we are, aren’t we? Slytherins are flocking to Umbridge like nifflers to gold! They don’t know that one wrong step, one word against her, and they’ll end up tortured!”
The tension finally came to a head that Friday, the last day of Potter’s detentions.
The wait for the meeting to be over was almost unbearable. Potter hadn’t come to find him beforehand this time. Draco wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad thing, but it did leave Draco alone, his anxiety building.
Potter’s voice was mocking. “Why do you care Malfoy!? It’s got nothing to do with you!”
Once again I'm sorry for the delay in updating, but things are a little crazy right now. I got sick with really bad strep and with that and my asthma they thought I had the plague for a week there on top of my new job.
Draco flipped her two fingers. “Now you can piss off.”
. You put one toe out of line and not only will Umbridge know, but so will your father
Blaise laughed. “Was that so hard? Merlin, you’re dramatic.”
Uncle Severus's voice was clipped when he answered. “You had a panic attack in the Great Hall. Your friends brought you here where I administered a calming draught. Would you care to share what had such an effect on you? I thought you said you were practicing Occlumency?”
In the end they helped anyway, in the name of Draco’s crush. With Blaise now helping Pansy in sending him knowing looks and pointed eyebrow wiggles, Draco had what felt like a permanent blush the whole time they were scheming.
Edgecombe had Potions after lunch. Draco planned on ambushing her on the way out, while they were still in Slytherin territory.
Catching sight of Lovegood- Luna, through the window was a bit of a shock, but mostly it served to remind Draco to keep track of the thestrals this time. There was no way he could talk to her in person though, if she was that closely associated with the Golden Boy. Not even Pansy would let him live that down. He’d have to send her a letter after all, he contemplated as he turned himself and Pansy around, pushing to the side a couple of first years that had been behind them.
Even the people he trusted -- Pansy and Blaise, Uncle Severus -- seemed to be looking at him with a worry he wasn’t used to seeing. It made him feel like he was cracking apart in front of everyone.
Skating in two hours after midnight, but It's here.
Blaise was the one to snort this time, Pansy rolling her eyes and lying back down. “Of course you like someone who puts up with you and lets you nerd out. It doesn’t have to be Lovegood who did it. There are too many people to really be able to tell who did it.”
Red spread up Potter’s neck and over his cheeks as Draco watched, in vicious happiness at having so flustered Potter. Potter opened and closed his mouth a couple times before he was able to spit any words out. “You’ve been… weird! All year!” He huffed a deep breath to calm down. “You’re up to something, Malfoy. I don’t trust you. Until I figure out what you’re up to, I’m not taking my eyes off you.”
enemy. This was the first time holding that place at school was putting him on the same side as Potter, and it was messing with Draco’s head. Draco could already feel how badly this was all going to end, but he couldn’t stop it.
He pointedly picked his glass back up and took a sip.
He met Draco stare head on with an eyebrow raised. “If you want to have private conversations you should at least check that you’re alone first. I’ve been right here this whole time.”
Draco met Umbridge’s eyes. “Yes. You mustn’t take sides in Quidditch. But I’m happy to see the sides you’ve taken in other matters.”
Keeping an eye on Potter and the golden trio wasn’t a new hobby of Draco’s by any means, not that he would ever admit that, but what was new was the way Potter was pulling away. This -- more than anything else Draco saw -- worried him. Even when Potter had no one, when Draco or circumstances had him pitted against the rest of the school, he had his two friends.
Eventually Draco drifted off.
“Weren’t you over by Gryffindor tower again?” Potter seemed to have spoken without thinking, snapping his mouth shut as soon as he realized what he’d asked.
Finnigan went from white to red faster than Draco thought possible. Even Finnigan’s freckles disappeared under his blush.
Lying there, his pleasure at his successful apology quickly faded. It wasn’t even dinner time yet, and he was far from tired enough to sleep. All he could see behind his eyelids was Potter’s eyes when he’d finally rushed at him. He couldn’t believe he’d let himself get like that after one little scare. What was he going to do when the war really kicked off?
Draco sneered. “Red-haired Weasleys must attract other Gryffindors like flies to honey. There’s nothing special about them.” Draco had a thought that was so delicious he was unable to stop a smile from spreading slowly over his face. “But they do have
. At the shout he’d startled, canceling his spell as he fumbled his wand, barely holding onto it as he spun to face his attacker.
Draco practically hissed the word care and Potter recoiled. He felt Pansy and Blaise both fidget, but couldn’t see their faces.
Luna had stopped when he did. “She was there tonight you see. She told us that with Umbridge knowing something was going on she didn’t feel safe continuing, given who her father was. Hermione took her coin back at the end of the meeting.”
He put the dropper back in and held the bottle out to Draco. Draco took it, but didn’t touch the top, looking over at Pansy. He carefully met her eyes too. They were still suspiciously wet. Her voice was even thick when she finally acknowledged him. “I know- I know how good you are at Occlumency, Draco. I don’t even know if this will work on you, but I trust you to let it work.” Her voice faded until it was only a quiet murmur. “For us.”
again, would hit him out of nowhere and he’d have to fight the urge to vomit.
Draco couldn’t help turning to hide his face in Blaise’s shirt. He could already feel tears gathering. His voice was thick. “It had to be Edgecombe. She must have panicked and told while I was stuck tutoring Greg! Maybe if I hadn’t frightened her none of this-”
Not that Draco should care.
He cast a
Then he stormed off back toward the dungeons.
Dear Draco,
He was distracted when Pansy elbowed him
He could feel Severus’s eyes on him, but he resolutely focused forward. Vincent and Greg had just taken a carriage from some second years and Pansy was shooting him a loaded look over her shoulder as she got in with them.
Luna’s voice lost some of the airiness she usually spoke with. “Can I hug you again?”
Draco felt Zabini tense up beside him. He adopted an even colder look and tone, hoping that whatever Zabini had done wasn’t too bad. “I assure you there is nothing you could tell me that would come as a surprise.”
Potter barely had time to glare before they were all shooting into the air.
They were silent until they were right in front of the doors to the Great Hall. Draco let go of Blaise’s arm. “I’m not going to let this go. I’ve got to do something this time.”
Draco finally petered out, gulping huge lungfuls of air. It was several seconds before Pansy dared to pipe up, her voice still soft out of respect for his revelations. “Is that why you thought we’d betray you? You don’t think our friendship is real because we’re Slytherins?”
Draco slid into his most menacing glare. “You can believe this Finnigan. You better start respecting me now before it’s
That evening at home, Draco kept replaying what had happened in his mind while cooking dinner.
Right, this whole time travelling affair was making Harry forget about his bond, the ache from the trips distracting him from the ache of the bond. Muttering a 'thanks', he gulped his potion and Hermione hurried to open the Time Machine.
“Of cold milk and one of sugar,” the waitress concluded for Harry, a big grin plastered on her face. “I know it now, too!” She walked away, leaving a shocked Harry behind.
“Thanks, but I believe
Malfoy shook his head. “It doesn’t work like that, Potter. I’m only a quarter-Veela. It’s something I’ve always lived with and my father taught me how to control my…
Harry’s brain shut down. Malfoy’s foot pressed harder into his groin and he bucked against it, his hand tightening around Malfoy’s ankle.
Draco had rolled his eyes, bit on his bottom lip. “I… Knocturn… last night I was…”
? You have a—”
“Everyone should see you like this.” And then you add, “Bent over for a Death Eater. The Saviour of us all. I’ll make you forget who you are.”
“Err, I—” Draco got up from his chair, feeling all their friends’ eyes on him. He knew he was blushing like a first-year during the Sorting, but he couldn’t help it. He didn’t have any excuse to go this quickly right after Potter.
Harry realised a tad too late he had just ordered Malfoy to answer him. Malfoy’s shoulders slacked, and he gave one long, breathy sigh. “Wait—” Harry tried, but it was too late.
“Ha, so you can talk about your sex life, but I can’t?”
Draco arrived at Ron and Hermione’s just a moment after Harry. When they first saw the article, they had panicked, but then they had rationalised and, well, Hermione had called them saying she had a plan. So, they had calmed down and immediately Floo’d to her house.
"My father said it made me look too feminine and always straightened it. I simply never broke the habit."
Like every time Malfoy flirted with some lame bloke at the pubs. Harry would feel bile rising up in his throat and fire burning through his chest, all while something screamed in his head that no one else should look at Malfoy like
"I don't wanna hear it! They
They shared a look and Harry saw Malfoy’s cheeks gaining a deeper colour. Harry stared at him, thinking once again he had no idea who this guy standing in front of him was. Space and time seemed different when they were together at Dromeda’s with Teddy. And he let himself believe they really could be someone else, something different.
Ten minutes was all it took for Malfoy to get dressed, make his speech, and Floo away.
He shoved them messily on his nose and squinted hard, trying to make the letters in front of his eyes stop dancing, giving up when it gave him nausea. He tossed the parchment on the bed to read later, while he carefully tried to stand and search for his clothes.
"You're right, I'm sorry, you know I'm always running late everywhere. I've been here a couple of times before, when we were searching for solutions for your problem. I… well, Malfoy will explain to you in a minute. It's not
Like right now, the two of them were sunbathing on the shores of Nice, endless white sand beneath them, the breathless blue sea Harry was now used to, after almost eight years spent in France. The sunset was approaching and the scene in front of his eyes was bathed in orange, only a few people still sprawled on the beach like them.
Life at Hogwarts hadn’t let them many other chances, either. They lived there, going back home during the weekends and holidays and occasionally for other errands, but they shared a tremendous amount of time together. Not mentioning that their rooms were adjacent, and they had constant meetings, lunches, dinners… they did everything together. So, they’d had to at least make the effort to make things work.
Harry huffed loudly, looking worriedly at Boo-boo's face morphing into a sad mask again, and glaring at Malfoy. "Nonsense. Of course you can come, people can't see you, right? Maybe he can be helpful, what do you know!"
“Why should I? Why should
Potter smiled again, and the light of the sunset caressed his lips, like a brush on a canvas. It showered him, making him brighter, clearer, the background blurring around him. Draco’s breath caught and the tickle — that was becoming terrifyingly familiar tonight — grew again in Draco’s stomach, quickly warming his cheeks.
Malfoy’s eyes widened before speaking again. He smiled, turning to quickly press a kiss to Harry’s hand. “But then, Severus talked to me.”
Ginny’s eyes sparkled with anger. “We? Play the role?! Kiss? What the fuck are they talking about?”
He grabbed both, shoved his glasses on and read the note:
He sat again, raking a hand through his hair, inhaling and exhaling slowly.
“Wow.” Potter took a deep breath, taking a few steps towards Draco, his steps crackling on the grass. “That’s… a lot. I don’t know why I did those things, honestly. I guess… you’re part of my life? What I mean is that we’ve known each other for so long and we’ve always fought, had arguments, even physically attacked each other, but here’s the point: you were there. You contributed to form what I am today, for better or worse. So, I can’t help but wonder and ask myself, what’s Malfoy plotting? Why is he hiding? If only with a competitive spirit, you know? I-It’s stupid, forget it…”
“Thanks, Malfoy. You’ve been… enlightening. Harry,” Oh, shit, no. “Is yer gay fling Draco Malfoy?”
After they made their way back to the Ministry, Draco reached the Unspeakables Department to find out the problem hadn’t been fixed.
Draco’s eyebrows knitted together and he scratched his head. “Yes, Tori. I… am sorry.”
Malfoy pursed his lips as he eyed the armchair next to Harry’s couch. Harry swallowed around a mouthful of bread with a sip of orange juice and stuttered out, “Er, sit down on the armchair.”
Malfoy was next to him, still fast asleep, his neck crooked to the side. Harry hesitated a fraction of a second and then whispered a cushioning spell to make him more comfortable, and reinforced the warming spell.
Alicia continued for Malfoy. "Yes, Mr Potter. It appears that you've contracted a bond."
It was 6 p.m. when Astoria read it the first time. 6.01 p.m. when she read it the second. At 6.03 p.m. she read it again, and again, and again. Ginny was cooking in the kitchen, so she probably hadn’t checked her phone in a while.
Harry looked from Hermione to Ron and back again. "Bad! How do you think it went! We ended up Hexing each other and now my throat hurts."
Draco stared hard into Potter's face, searching for his eyes that were trained on Lady Luck. "Are you kidding me, Potter? Lady Luck
Casting a powerful Silencing Charm, Draco took Harry in his arms, holding him back from doing anything, trying to whisper calming thoughts to him, hugging him tightly to his chest, kissing his forehead, his hair. Harry didn’t know if he was feeling the pain of the bond shouting to him that he couldn’t be held by anyone who wasn’t Jacob, or feeling the pain of hearing his mother die. Thankfully, Draco was covering his eyes, by clutching him to his chest.
“Who said they’re glittering!”
“Malfoy, wha—”
Draco raised an eyebrow and put his fork down. “I’m sure you can articulate something even with your little Gryffindor brain.”
Still, the idea of living six months in the middle of nowhere — in a small wooden cabin with a straw fucking bed — didn't thrill him.
Draco didn't know how or why but he would always find sand at his cottage, in the shower, in his hair, in his
sold it to me. He told me lavender would compliment my tanned skin. I agree.” Potter made a half pirouette, making the skirt turn and lift, showing his muscled thighs just enough to make Draco salivate.
Still catching their breaths, they ran to Grimmauld’s garden, where their new life was waiting for them.
Malfoy smiled, a real smile, not one of those he pawned off to the journalists. A smile that made his cheeks dimple again, and Harry's heart skip a beat at the sight.
He hadn’t joined the Aurors right after the War like the majority of his friends. He’d wanted to travel, to feel carefree for once; to see the world, to ride dragons with Charlie in Romania— and so he’d gone off the radar for two years.
And then something clicks into Harry’s mind. But that can’t be, right? Draco would have never Confunded Harry when seeing him stepping out of Blaise’s room. Harry shakes his head, trying to clear it. It’s still throbbing from this morning—whoever hexed him didn’t certainly play nice.
"Are we stuck in time?"
“Fuck, I can’t feel my legs.” Harry’s sweating like crazy, panting hard against Malfoy’s neck.
Ron's head popped out from the door of the kitchen, a puzzled expression. "What? Who?"
No. He didn’t spend nineteen years at Draco’s side to throw all to the bin for a stupid fight. They’d solve this one too — after all, their situation wasn’t the easiest, it was normal to have such arguments, right?
A mischievous glint lit Malfoy’s eyes, and he pulled out his fingers, making Harry’s leg slightly tremble under his touch. He already mourned the loss of those fingers and bit his tongue for giving a salty response.
And Malfoy had immediately seized the new opportunity, discovering new way and parts of Harry’s body to tickle and torture him daily.
“You’re resisting more than expected, I’ll give you that,” he said, still grinning. “It’s a shame, with all the things we could do.”
tsk tsk. Sixty is not even halfway through our entire life. I want you.” Draco pushed Harry backwards until his calves buckled against the couch and he fell on it, pulling Draco down on top of him.
"Oh," Boo-boo sighed, tapping a finger on his temple. "I don't know, actually! Since forever?"
“Nothing like that, I just… we’re still wet and the sand is starting to—” he shifted uncomfortably his knees already bruised by the sand gathered under them, scrunching up his nose.
Pansy enlaced her fingers with Blaise, dragging him up the stairs she had descended earlier, their laughter softly floating in the air, warming Draco’s heart. He decided to take Blaise’s suggestion and go out for a walk before everyone started arriving; choosing to use the window door of the ballroom to get out, still not feeling completely comfortable with stepping through the front doors of the Manor.
Draco shook his head as the three of them made their way out of Hogwarts and back to Diagon Alley, where they were staying at the Leaky Cauldron.
“Oh, you’re here! Listen, we’re going to the pub. You need to have more fun in your life. We’re meeting in ten minutes. Bye!”
“I am not asking you to be supportive right now, I’m just telling you because I needed to come out of the closet and be honest with all of you. I hope we can face this. I’ll leave you with your mum, shall I? We can talk another time.”
Harry grasped it and everyone sat at the table. Draco shared a worried look with Harry and took a deep breath. “Um, we don’t have anything for you.”
Hermione inhaled calmly and tried to explain. “In case you hadn’t noticed, the writer of the article is our beloved Rita Skeeter. Everyone in the Wizarding World knows that she’s a terrible journalist, no one ever believes her. But if we want to move against her anyway, we just need to make a few calls and maybe ask Luna to publish something in the Quibbler in your favour guys.”
cheer him up.
You crook your fingers further in as you suck harder, angling your head so that your throat opens and you can take him deeper. He gasps, pulling at your hair, hips twitching, trying to push his cock harder into your mouth and to fuck himself on your fingers all at once.
The ghost wrinkled his eyebrows and shrugged, zigzagging through the people on the street, going back to Harry and Malfoy.
One month in, Malfoy started eating popcorn, drinking beer, watching the worst programs on television. He developed an addiction to crime shows and movies, dragging Harry into that too. They watched
This time was no different — seeing him brought everything up again and it stirred a hungry curiosity in Draco. Would Potter still cry out the same things, beg the same way, look at Draco as if everything he wanted in the world was for Draco to pound his cock relentlessly into him?
Just as Harry felt his balls tighten and the room spin around him, Malfoy pinched his arm, taking him out of his lust, and growled breathless, “You know, Potter—”
“Mmh, I did, didn’t I? Ugh, cheesy…”
Harry got up, rushing to the bedroom, knowing when the moment was to stop pushing Malfoy. He sat on the bed and waited, not knowing what Malfoy would be up to this time.
Harry rolled his eyes but let the topic drop as they started eating the ratatouille Malfoy had cooked. It was bloody amazing and Harry couldn’t stop the gasp he made after tasting it.
“Don’t you dare bring up the spaghetti—”
“Pottah… Pottah… You should hear how you sound when you say my name… it’s always been like that. Pottah, Pottah, Pottah—”
Looking at the note, he already felt calmer, Hermione's neat handwriting playing a great role in that. She called it 'the font for drunk folks'. She had somehow found a particular way of writing that was easy to catch up with even in a confused state.
“What’s your problem with food, Pottah? You are always eatin’...” Malfoy slurred, his lips purple from the wine. Harry felt a strong impulse to lick it off them.
Keeping his eyes on the sky, Draco flashed back to that moment in the war. That one life altering moment.
"Who is this performer? Do you know?" Harry asked Hampton.
"Thank you, I do take pleasure in doing my job well."
“So good,” Malfoy said. “So good and beautiful. Will you laugh one last time for me, sweetheart? One last time and then I’ll fuck you so hard you won’t remember your name anymore. Would you like that?”
“Perfect.” It sounds like a moan. “Merlin, come here.”
, right
Draco startled at the question; he wasn’t really listening, lost in his mulling. He turned his head to Pansy, blinking several times. “Erm, w-what?”
“You, me,” Harry said, nuzzling Draco’s jaw, the spot behind his ear, “takeaway pizza, my hands roaming under this beautiful jumper of yours…” Draco rolled his eyes at him, but Harry just smiled and finished, “and to open your gift. I know you’ve bought me something physical. You always do.”
Draco cupped his face with his hands and tugged to make them look into each other’s eyes. He smiled, caressing Harry’s cheeks. “You didn’t. But to be fair, I don’t think there was a good way to handle this. We fucked up and now we have to fix things with Ginevra and Astoria. We owe them. See you tomorrow? Diagon Alley?”
“...so, it can also be one second?” Harry was starting to be more and more confused.
As for company, unless someone had been sleeping in the cupboard, he was alone. He quickly opened the wardrobe doors — one never knew — and went on reading.
Damn. Draco shook his head, not trusting his mouth not to betray him.
But Harry loves this part even more than the sex. When Malfoy is cuddly and chuckling, and keeps murmuring things like,
Ginny stood up and reached her, hugging her tightly. “Oh, Tori… I’m gonna tell you a silly thing. There were times when I’ve been jealous of Draco, you know.”
A lame punch line like that one shouldn’t have worked, Harry knew it. The truth was, though, that Malfoy’s line wasn’t the only thing that drew Harry in.
“Ah,” he said, swallowing an elegant amount of liquor himself, licking his lips slowly afterwards. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”
Boo-boo laughed, floating right behind Draco and talking to his reflection in the mirror.
"Malfoy, what the heck are you doing here?"
“Draco! Harry! You’re here finally! What is this?!” Ginevra shoved the newspaper into Harry’s chest, pinning it there with her hand.
It was painfully obvious to Harry that he was shaking with jealousy, because no one else should dare to make Malfoy look so damn kissable.
“Fine. No kisses; yes to licking and biting, please. Please let me, your skin looks so damn biteable,” Potter had gasped, grazing his teeth over Draco’s collarbone. Who knew that could feel so damn good?
Draco shot a glance at Pansy. “Sorry,” he muttered, picking up his glass and gulping down the wine.
“I know,” he says. And then, “I want to fuck you.”
Draco slipped a hand into his pants and palmed his cock, hissing at the feeling. The few people on the beach were too far to see him. Draco allowed his mind to drift off again to thoughts of Potter’s bare-chest, confident and grinning in his lab, hoping three days would pass in a blink.
knows it!” He was laughing so hard he fell to the floor, tears running wild on his cheeks.
“Sorry, but I really can’t. I have to work early tomorrow.” Draco knew he was being a complete jerk. But he needed to be out of Potter’s apartment before he gave any more meaning to Potter’s smiles, or the way he’d licked Draco’s cock as if he’d die not doing it.
. Like Harry wasn’t even there. Like Harry wasn’t even a big deal.
Harry regarded Teddy more closely. The kid was now looking expectantly at the package in Harry’s hands. He kinda did look pretty with blond hair, but that wasn’t the point. He opened his mouth to reply when none other than Draco Malfoy appeared on the stairway that led to the second floor of the house.
“I think you’ll never stop surprising me, Draco. You can paint? This is gorgeous.”
Draco licked his lips, cock already straining against his pants. “What— what do you mean?”
The following three months are weird.
“Our safe word for sex!” the bastard exclaimed, drawing a scandalised —and, at the same time, horrified— cry from Ron.
It had been hard for Draco at first, so used to strict mandatory shifts, but he’d quickly gotten used to the slower pace that cities living with the ocean rhythm gave.
As soon as he stepped out of their fireplace, though, Draco stilled: Astoria and Ginevra were there too. But they didn’t seem angry with them. In fact…
Draco waved his wand towards the door, trying to lock it, but a messy head popped from behind it, Potter’s eyes sparkling with amusement.
He started doing that every time they were close since they got back to the present.
. What is it now?"
been writing a book… about mixing Muggle and Wizarding cuisine. Next week there will be the Best Chef Award of 2007. I’ve been invited and I’ve decided to come out as Sweet Prophecies’ chef. And…” He trailed off, cocking his head, fidgeting with his hands.
“Exactly,” Draco replied, nodding. He flicked his eyes to the papers on his desk when a quiet snicker distracted him again.
^^^^^
For the first time since he opened his eyes again, Harry wished he'd stayed unconscious.
Almost, because the hunger and the pain if Harry forgot to order Malfoy around were always there. Almost, because they started sleeping together every night.
Right! Hermione! She always gave Harry a list of things for
Potter got up from his seat, the buttered slice of bread still in his hand. He approached Draco, stopping mere inches away, an amused smile lighting up his entire face.
“You’re the worst friends in the world,” Harry muttered, but he was already laughing as well.
Draco felt his heartbeat calming against Harry’s hand, his breathing becoming steadier. He nodded and followed Harry to their wives’ table, his legs trembling like jelly.
A second later he’s pulling the second gift out the bag. It’s an anal vibrator, you recognise it even if it’s a Muggle one.
Making themselves decent for when the others would come back, they sat on the couch. Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder and placed a kiss there. “I remember that time, by the way. You said you wanted to suck my cock… and even after all these years…”
It hadn’t been until
“So,” Harry interrupted him, his anger reinforced by all the damn happy moments they had shared.
"Merlin, it's too hot under that thing."
Malfoy’s cheeks became even redder beyond every possible imagination. “What! We most certainly were n-not… I mean, we… S-sometimes it helped getting there fast—” He clamped a hand over his lips, the Veritaserum visibly forcing the truth out of his mouth.
A shadow fell over them both as a blanket was placed over Draco.
Malfoy's lips, which had fallen into a thoughtful frown, went up at the edges, showing the beginning of a smirk, "You know, I'm almost as bad at directions as you are with potions, so I think I might need that map drawn out for me."
"The school is reopening in a few weeks time." McGonagall mentioned, offhandedly.
Harry's eyes widened as he realized he was still half on the man. He scrambled away mumbling a quick sorry.
Harry stood leaning against the side of the hotel building, waiting for his ride. Like planned the night before, Hampton and Harry were going to Malfoy's show together. Harry was excited not only to be able to chat with Hampton again, but also to see Malfoy perform again. When thinking about how the next few hours will go, Harry's hands become clammy and he gets a little light headed. From the nerves of the "date" he is going on or the prospect of seeing Malfoy perform again, he wasn't sure.
Harry walked forward, placing his hands on Malfoy's shoulders without hesitation. "I was there, you know, that night. I saw you.. saw the look on your face. Saw you lowering your wand before.. before Snape came in."
"I am aware of what this is, Mrs. Malfoy. I wouldn't drop Draco. I couldn't. Not because of the whole mate thing but because I can never seem to drop Draco. No matter what has happened between us in the past, or what will happen to us in the future, Draco will always have me. Especially after yesterday.. I- I can't imagine a life without him."
As Harry finally felt the strength to open his eyes again, he found Draco holding his own so tightly it looked like it hurt. Harry moved his hand up, brushing a soft strand of blue hair behind the boy's ear.
The girl beside Harry tensed up as she looked at the blue-haired boy as if he had magically grown two heads, "Excited for what, Malfoy?" She said his name like it was gum on the bottom of her new black flats.
The two men pulled out their wands and began releasing the wards surrounding the large cage behind them. They then walked out without a single glance at Draco nor the creature.
Hampton looked down at his feet, flushing slightly, "Thank you for performing for us, Draco, we really do appreciate it. If neither of you mind, Harry, could I still you for a second so we can talk?"
Those weren't the ones that interested Draco though. Three different pamphlets that covered multiple interesting facts about the island were. One of them focused on theories on Ol' Howler, the gift of the old tree, while the other two dig into many different legends and prophecies that surrounded Hunulaya.
Harry sighed as he looked at the shops, noticing the run down shack, he quickly grabbed Draco's hand, startling Draco as he pulled him to the shop.
Harry turned his back against the tree, "Boredom mainly."
They walked down the pier as Draco explained everything, only stopping when people came within ear shot. Which wasn't very often seeing as most people were smart enough to stay home while a big storm was approaching.
Harry paused, looking at the drink and then up at his partner, "You can't drink the potion? We did everything correctly, are you allergic to-"
deeper than it was a few moments ago.
Even as he sat up slowly, the room began spinning. He moaned softly as he forced himself out the bed. He took an abnormally long shower, letting the water slowly wash everything that happened the night before away. Including the dreadful conversation he and Hampton had once they drove off from the bar.
Draco made his way outside and began walking down the beach, finally finding a stump to sit on. Pansy stayed silent the whole time Draco was explaining who was there. It took her a whole minute and a half (that Draco also panicked for) to come up with something to say.
Malfoy stared at him for a second, his mouth opening and closing like a fish. After a few breaths he finally nodded, "Yeah.. I can do that. The whole not awkward thing. You know, as I recall I believe the whole awkward thing was
The man smiled as he looked at Draco, "The landscape is marvelous isn't it? Many people travel here just to see the beauty.. or to study it." Draco hummed, acknowledging the words, not truly listening.
Granger raised an eyebrow as she sat down stiffly. "You named the magical panther a name that means
Draco groaned. "Pansy, this is more than worry, there is a child who is more than likely being abused as we speak, did Blaise find anything?"
The words echoed in the small room. Draco's eyes, which were now void of redness and half-moons, turned hard. "I don't know what that have all told you but-"
Draco shrugged, picking up the magazine he was reading before Granger showed up, blindly. "Yes, that works for me. See you than, Granger."
Even though he rarely uses magic anymore, he always has his wand close by. The first year after the war, he suffered through many hexes, jinx, and curses. He became very good at defensive charms, especially during the stint he spent finishing up his schooling, Eighth Year they called it. Luckily in that final year of schooling, he was given his own room and space that he safely stuck close to throughout the dragging months he was there.
"How do I know that that wasn't the plan along? To make me suspicious and then switch my perfectly good bagel with the poisoned one that was on your plate?"
Hermione, who had also noticed the many scars Harry had found, held tightly to his hand. He squeezed it, not looking away from a set of bricks directly over the heads of what he assumes are second year Slytherins. He couldn't bring himself to look at the girl next to him, not being able to look in her eyes and see the light they have fought hard for the past few months slipping away like it was in Harry's own emerald eyes.
Thank you so much for reading and being patient with my updates, it means the world! & if you want to read a finished book of mine, I have a one shot called The Color Blue. 💙
A new development in the learning of Draco Malfoy, was that he was extremely affectionate to the ones he is close to. Harry found within the last two weeks that Draco loved saying endearments, especially to Harry.
I just wanted to start out by saying I'M SORRY! I struggled writing the super fluffy scenes without writing in a kiss. But I know that this kiss has to be perfect for them. And I love to keep people (including myself, apparently) on their toes. Thank you so much for reading! If you don't mind I would love to hear your thoughts on the book and where you think the story will be going! xx Maddie Leigh
Hampton walked his uncle to his vacant seat, moving to stand in-between them, leaning against the fireplace; he wanted to be close in case he needed to intervene.
Draco squeezed his hand, "Come on, I need to go tune up."
When Harry arrived he stood in awe of how big the boardwalk seemed to be. From the brochures and website the boardwalk seemed to be a small little walking space with three or four shops and a small carnival at the end. The boardwalk Harry stood in front of was more of a giant outdoor flea market with the biggest carnival he has ever seen at the end of the long stretch of shops.
Upon arrival, Harry quickly noted how neat Draco’s room was, and then his mind jumped to the fact that he was currently standing in Draco’s room.
Draco barged through the door, slamming it shut, “Someone gave her information on this place and she figured it would be the best place for me to go seeing as I would be stranded in a small island, therefore couldn’t get into too much trouble. Said she was at the mall when a man walked up and started talking to her, bringing up Hunulaya. Guess what she said he looked like?”
"Will you simply take an 'I'm trying to figure it out'?"
Draco shrugged. "Yeah. It seemed fitting for him. Plus it aggravates him just a little bit which I have come to enjoy."
She turned her eyes to the side. Harry could see the water welling up in them. He could instantly see how much she seemed to care immensely for Draco.
Harry was pulled out of his thoughts as an arm looped around his own.
Harry slowly stood and walked out. Standing right outside the door was Hampton.
"Yeah, I'm assuming it's not yours?"
dream life. Yet, being in this world he was raised to look down on he still has his moments of wishing so much hadn’t had to change. Wishing he could be back to his original home. The home he has seen in nearly two full years.
Once they reached the hotel lobby, Harry paused, "What floor are you on?"
He had decided the second day of school that Harry would play nice with Malfoy, if only to get his questions answered. While he doesn't trust the stinking git, he does agree with Malfoy about the fighting. Harry has been fighting his entire life, now that the worst of the war is done, he needs a grace period of just being a regular semi-nice human being.
"I can't drink that."
Léon began pacing by the ponds side, shaking his head every other step. Draco's heart began breaking for the distraught creature in front of him.
Draco Malfoy is
Before he could, the moment was ended as Ham, who Harry forgot was even here, grabbed Harry's wrist, "So I have to run, you know early shift tomorrow, but I would love to be able to see you again."
"So.. he is there."
Harry shrugged, grasping Hermione's hands in his own, "I just pushed pass the hate, I guess. When we first talked he told me that he was tired of fighting and I realized how tired of it I was too. I have been fighting for my entire life. The Dursley's, Draco, Snape, Voldemort.. the list is never ending and I realized I didn't want to live like that anymore. So, I pushed the hate away. I didn't forget, I don't know if I can ever forget, but I heard him out. He explained some things about his life that I never even thought about. I always saw him, along with majority of the other Slytherins, as these two-dimensional characters that were just out to be bullies but it was so much more than that, Hermione. They were just as lost and terrified as we were. Kids stuck in a war they never asked to be a part of."
Thomas stepped closer to Draco's side, wand clutched tightly in his hand, "He is gifted. He can move things around with a thought, he can hurt people without touching them. Flippio, one of Marcus' guys, got hit by what he described as an intense Stinging Hex when they captured the cat. They ran a few scans on him and told that they found no trance of wizardry or witch in the cat but you know the intelligence they hold so I wouldn't take their word."
Draco stood, grabbing his guitar and pulling Harry up with the hand he was still holding, "I'm ready if they are."
As soon as he arrived back at his flat, he quickly showered, and fell into his bed, hoping against everything that sleep would give him some form of answers.
With a quick farewell to Hermione, Harry walked towards his new dormitory, which was in the old Hufflepuff tower. Upon arrival, he was shocked to see a door with the words
Waiting for him was a man in a bright Hawaiian shirt. "Hello! You must be Sir Malfoy."
"But its so peaceful outside," Ginny was groaning as Luna pulled her to her feet.
A soft hand began pushing Harry towards the door.
Harry's eyes widened as he look towards the hand Malfoy extended to him.
Léon's head fell down, looking ashamed of himself. He looked up at Draco and took a step toward him, and then another, and then another until they were face to face with each other. He leaned his head close to Draco's and then his tongue darted out and licked a hot, wet streak up Draco's face.
He walked to Harry, stopping only when their chest were pressed lightly together.
The man nodded, his hair shifting out of place, "Yes. He has shown great strength. In more ways than one." he looked around nervously, "I can't explain all until we get him out."
Harry pulled his bag more securely on his shoulder. "It actually wasn't bad. I could tell that they really care about Draco. Za-Blaise even offered for us to call each other by given names. It is for Draco, but still. It's a nice gesture. It's crazy, thinking of Slytherins as nice. This year has been an odd one already and its not even Christmas yet."
The curious look in Malfoy’s eyes, turned into one of realization as one of his hands fell to his chest, rubbing it lightly. Harry knew exactly what he was thinking in that moment. "That's where you got that spell isn't it? The one from the bathroom."
"I thought I got it under control.." he whispered to himself.
"Maybe you should find a book to read." Malfoy suggested.
"Well," Draco's heart thudded against his chest as he gave Harry another one, "Get used to it, Potter."
"Oh, sorry," he started to move off his chest, but he was frozen half way down.
He closed the laptop and walked towards the door.
She shook her head, "No, I don't- I can't- its been a year. I can't-" She attempted to swallow her memories, "This is our last school year." She faced Harry, grabbing tightly to the hand that held hers, "This is our last chance to be students, Harry. This is our last chance to be normal. We-
Hermione turned towards Harry, "No, she and Bill had to take off for Victoire's health problems, remember?"
Hermione and Harry stared after him, both shocked for different reasons.
A few tourist and townspeople were already sitting in the little tables that were placed randomly throughout the building. A bar was found all the way on the right side, next to it a small hallway that seemed to lead to the bathrooms. A stage was placed on the back wall with bright lights hanging above it. It looked similar to the stage of a karaoke bar Hermione dragged Ron and Harry to a few years back.
Draco threw his hands on the air, "
"Right." Harry looked longingly at his toast, "So, Luna, tell me more about these Narwhals."
They had moved positions so they were laying flat on their backs looking up at the stars, their shoulders touching with every little move. Noise sounded down the beach where many teenager seem to partying.
Léon, Draco thinks, is a great name for the all-or-nothing panther. Not only is it humorous in the fact that it means
Draco's eyes flew open; he knew that voice anywheres. Looking up at the person trying to untangle their legs from his, he caught bright green eyes.
Draco leaned into it as he whispered, "Hey."
poison and watch as you undoubtedly fail at making a proper antidote. I have to get some kind of enjoyment out of it."
Looking at Draco, hearing his voice, made every thought Harry has ever made disappear.
that stood in front of him was his teeth. That and that the man's voice was that of a southern angel.
"We can't know for certain.. he arrived around the same time as the other man. Both seem to harbor great talent." Kenneth Trade answered.
Harry thought, bitterly as he walked towards the exit door.
Harry had sat quietly in the car for a few moments before he spoke something that he would regret
Draco sat up, "Whether it was him or not, we now know officially that there is a reason we are here. I have this sick feelingly that we aren't going to like the reason."
Draco glanced down, cheeks pinking as he realized he grabbed Pansy magazine instead of his own latest edition of
The man hesitated, his face showing confusion then realization, "Yes, we all are." He turned and walked back through the door.
As Harry's brain caught up with his thoughts, he was surprised, not by fact that he thought it, but the fact that he realized he wouldn't mind not ever having to look away.
(See the end of the chapter for
A year and three months after the war, things were beginning to fall into place. The Golden Trio - one Hermione Granger, one Ronald Weasley, and one Harry Potter - were walking peacefully through Diagon Alley when they bumped into none other than their old professor and head of their house, Professor McGonagall.
"No offense, but your uncle made it seem very important and I don't exactly trust you with it."
Draco rolled his eyes. Ever sense he began touring, Pansy, as well as Blaise, have been trying to get Draco to come back home.
, was the unspoken ending of that sentence.
Harry looked towards the speaker and gasped at the sight of Fleur. "He- Is- I tried to- I-"
Harry smiled as Draco said his name, "I know, but I don't mind. I want to."
Narcissa nodded slowly, "When I mentioned intentions, Mister Potter, I meant in the long run. This isn't a one night thing. Not a fling you can drop after a month. This is a long-term commitment. Forever."
The screams grew louder as a small, yet muscular man stepped onto the stage, his hair so white it almost looks translucent under the soft light. Harry felt his heart drop to his toes and his breathing stop.
Harry, who at this point realized how much of a goner he was for Draco, said simply, "Okay."
Try as he might, Harry was slowly becoming obsessed once again with the person that was Draco Malfoy. His friends, surprisingly, didn't bat an eye to this new obsession. When he spoke of Draco they all just looked amused.
The scariest part of this was, Harry knew what all of this meant. The sweaty palms, the erratic heart, the smiles soft and wide. He knew what all of these things meant, and it scared him more than anything else.
"Do you remember where the shop is?"
Draco put his head in his hands for a moment, shaking his head and breathing in soft and slow, "Ican'tcontrolit." He mumbled into his hands quickly.
The old man chuckled, "Ah, my boy when the time comes you will know."
Pansy sat back with a small smile, "Oh, Potter, darling. He isn't pulling back because he doesn't want you, he is pulling back because he doesn't want to hurt you. He has feelings for you,
The same translucent-grey cloud that May and David had laid on all those weeks ago now surrounded Draco. Draco reached out a hand and gentle pushed it through the cloud. The velvety smooth smoke swirled around Draco's hand, tickling his palm. He smiled in wonder as the color of the smoke changed from translucent grey to a hazy lilac.
He wasn't sure how long he sat out there, but he knows when he finally started back to the hotel there wasn't a soul in sight.
Thunder rolled in the distance, it had not begun to rain yet but the storm seemed to be getting closer.
George shrugged as he pulled out a sucker from the bucket sitting on top of the counter, opening a magazine and flipping through the pages as if he wasn’t in the middle of a conversation.
The ride to the plane was very quiet like usual. The only noise being the slight movements of the cars occupants. The next two concerts and board meeting where all being held at a little island right off the coast of America. It was called Hunilaya or like the procure called it,
"I don't like him." Harry grumbled.
Granger ran a hand over her face, letting out a deep sigh. As her hand moved away, Draco noticed how pale she looked compared to the other day. He also noticed the deep dark rings mooning her eyes, her lips which looked chapped with a small indention on one side, as if she has been chewing on it for days straight.
"Granger." Draco replied, enjoying the annoyed glare she sent his way.
Holding Draco tightly, looking as if he is a few breaths away from expiring, sent a darkness that Harry hadn’t felt in a long while rise up in himself. The noise of the rest of the people went silent as a wall made of straight magic built itself around Harry and Draco.
Draco dropped an actual kiss on Harry's crinkled up nose before pulling away, bringing the other boy with him.
Harry sat with his chin rested in his hand, looking at Malfoy as if he were a god. “How do you remember all of this?”
and can also apparently do an amazing amount of magic, if the magical atmosphere was any indication.
The boys sat in the little cafe Harry had went to when he first arrived. It was a lot more busy today, most likely from people trying to escape the bad weather.
Loud footstep and whispers echoes through the entrance door.
Draco looked towards the door, feeling the exact same way, "Pretty much the same as today. Nothing but exploring, that is if the weather permits it. I am doing a few songs at this founder's shin-dig tomorrow night. Your welcome to come if you want."
He chuckled as he slipped it on, "Of course you would like the black one."
- to know this strange, unfamiliar person more.
As he handed Harry the stone Harry asked, "So what does the stone have to do with the story? How would the stone help me 'find my way'?"
Harry peeked over the covers and around his canopy just in time to see a familiar head of blonde hair walk out the room.
Over the course of the two hour class, Malfoy had slowly regained what little color he had in his skin, but as soon as Harry placed the cup in front of him, he turned white as a ghost once again and backed away from the cup like it might explode on him.
"Really, Malfoy. Just me putting my foot in my mouth."
Much to the horror of the women who looked into the room to check in on the boys thirty minutes later, Draco showed Harry exactly how much of himself he was willing to give.
"Will that be it, dears?" A tall lady with grey hair spoke.
Harry followed, "Um.. this is a very interesting store. How long have you been here?"
The cat merely stared blankly down at Draco. Draco sighed.
Harry pulled the bagel close to him, "Yes, civil, not friendly.. unless you aren't being friendly.. did you poison this bagel?"
"Much closer? You don't mean like.."
He shook his head, "I'm really not sure. I would have to see her again to know."
. Even though this boy was completely different from the one in school, he still bare the same face, the same name, the same haunting memories of the past.
Draco's office was quiet when he arrived, the only sound coming from the scratching of Draco's old and broken Quick Quotes Quill that sat on the highest shelf, locked in glass casing.
Pansy rolled her eyes, "Please, the only thing Lily would ever steal is a flower from a park. And then she would probably cry afterwards because she realized she is basically a plant murderer."
Harry shook his head, confused as all get out at what the hell is going on, "Are you like.. wizards or something? Witches?"
Harry shook his head and looked back at Hampton, "Oh, sorry, what did you say?"
"Granger." Draco interupted, walking over to the frantic women. "It's okay. Breath. You have seen my office, believe me this doesn't faze me at all." He grabbed the stack of books she held, placing them back up on her book shelf.
Harry folded up his shirt, "Death Eaters are basically useless without their leader. Mister No-Nose is dead, the cape boys are powerless."
The Great Hall was still as magnificent as Harry remembers, with the floating candles, the ceiling that reflected the starlight sky outside, the four long tables still set up in the exact places Harry remembers. From another's view, the room looks like nothing had ever happened to it, it looks the same way it has looked for a multitude of years, but for the older students and the teachers who have been through the horrors of war, the room was very different.
Harry looked up at the man in front of him, catching his eyes once more. They both very quickly looked away, blushes creeping up their necks.
"Her-" Harry started, but stopped when Malfoy tapped his arm.
, he thought. No other animal he has ever treated has had a wall built up like this one has. Even the Animagus have trouble with
Draco looked up, no longer were there thick, jungle branches or bright green leaves. The enchanted blue, sunny sky was dimming to black. The panther who sat upon the branch, whose expression was slowly morphing into worry and regret, unbenounced to Draco, slipped out of Draco's vision. Instead, Draco saw flames. Streaks of oranges, yellows, reds and deep blues formed all around him, swallowing him slowly. He tried to scream out, but his voice was just as trapped as he was. He tried to scream towards the person floating on a broom above him, but they only looked down at Draco with joy, glad to see Draco pay for all he has done.
"...Harry?"
Draco smiled softly at the panther, who sat down once they had made it to the door. "Be good, kitty."
The rest of the week wasn't smooth sailing for Draco and Léon, but after the near-death experience Léon had shown great improvement with interactions. He still didn't acknowledge Draco much, only a twitch of an ear or a slight head tilt when curious about something Draco was doing. But through the week he stayed down from his tree, instead choosing to lay down by the pond and watch the fish swim around the shallow water. Something odd, Draco had noticed while watching Léon from the cameras that were placed in every enchanted room, was that the panther never hunted. There were a few creatures in the forest - insects, birds, a few hares; and now there was a pond filled when a variety of fish yet the panther never hunted. He never has even tried to hunt anything since the day he arrived; Draco went to the older videos to check if he had or not and found himself in shock that the cat has never even attempted to hunt anything.
The water lapped against their skin, the wind seemed to drop several degrees.
Draco shrugged, "Maybe because often times to have something great you have to give something in return. Every piece of magic comes with a price. Even simple spells. Dark magic especially. Often times you need blood or a lot of strength. Seeing as how this has been going on for centuries, even tho it doesn't seem like they did a good job at whatever they were trying to accomplish, they must have sacrificed someone or something extremely powerful."
George slowly sat down in the worn out chair Hampton had vacated, Hampton took the blue chair across from it, "It's just so infuriating. He is giving everyone in our family a bad name. It's bad enough that he refuses to go to meetings and participate in rituals. He can't just be giving out something as precious as
The panther sat in-between them with his eyes closed. Draco's breath caught as a soft white halo of light surrounded his co-workers heads. The light flowed around their heads gently before brightening and then fading away. As the last of the light faded, Maybelle and David's eyes began to open.
Draco walked over to the bed and plopped down.
"You won't come down," Draco grunted. "Than I will go up."
Draco shrugged. "It's alright. You said you were busy last week so I assumed you wouldn't have gotten much done on the panther case. I have finished looking through my collection of books and I came up with a small list of probabilities but none of them have any form of base."
But here, in potions, a class Harry needed but was currently failing, the obsession was bringing itself to the surface more than it ever did before. Instead of listening to his professor, all Harry could pay attention to was the brush of Draco's leg against his own. Instead of reading the board and writing what he would need for today's potion, all he could do was pretend he wasn't staring at Draco Malfoy next to him.
Gooseflesh covered his arms as he stepped onto the stones that surround the tree. He glanced around cautiously, but only saw a mother with her two children playing on the swings. He took a deep breath and walked towards the tree, the wind picking up the closer he got it.
They shared a glance as Slughorn began speaking, "Today, we will be brewing Girding Potion. You will work together with your table partner, with no complaints. At the end of class, if the potion is presentable and safe - which it should be, this is Advanced Potions; both of you will take it." He flicked his wand and all the instructions flew onto the blackboard, "Begin."
"I need butterbeer, maybe something stronger."
Harry turned away shaking his head at that thought. Where the hell did
McGonagal nodded, and followed Pomfrey down the hall. Harry sent a longing look towards the door, but reluctantly allowed Fleur to push him away.
Draco opened his mouth to answer, but when nothing comes out he just closed his mouth and nodded. He looked towards Harry. Harry was staring at him thoughtfully.
A loud
Harry let out a breath, "I'm not sure what talking to Bill or Fleur would do. I doubt they would tell us anything. I just wish the damn bastard would talk to me. I don't care if he is some half-bird or hald-fish or half-.. anything. I just want to talk to him, and not just because of these weird sensations but because he is actually nice to talk to."
Harry turned to Pomfrey, "Can I see him? I don't even have to stay or talk.. I just want to see him."
"Me, Gin, and 'Mione were just going down to the kitchen, would you boys like to join us?"
, intending on dropping off a few books before heading home for a late supper, but as he placed the books down on his desk and turned back towards the floo, an echo of words began lacing themselves into Draco's forefront, itching in the way
Harry sat on the floor in a bathroom stall contemplating his life decisions. The second he recognized who was walking onto the stage he bolted into the bathroom. The past two and a half years he went without having to see his face and now in a random tiny island he runs into the one person he hoped to never see again.
Giving no further explanations, the man walked out of a side door that Harry swore wasn't there before. He stuffed the paper and necklace into his bag and began his way back to the boardwalk.
Harry grabbed his phone from underneath the towel, "Damn. It's 1:02 in the morning."
The man smiled brightly, "How about you Mr. Draco?"
"But why would dark magic be put into something that makes a land so beautiful?"
Both of their breath was coming out as gasp, mingling with each other and teasing their lips.
Harry looked at him confused. He searched for a scowl or anything resembling the coldness of the Malfoy he used to know, but nothing showed. When Harry refused to answer, Malfoy put the shirt he was folding into the drawer with a sigh and softly closed the dresser. He walked over to his trunk and sat down, looking over at the other students who were still unpacking their own bags. Malfoy smiled as he saw them all joking around with each other like old friends do. He turned towards Harry.
feelings, and he is afraid that when the Veela comes out, he won't be able to control himself."
Forest faced lit up in an instant, "It is isn't it? The island is exceptionally beautiful. The landscape is marvelous isn't it? You know many people travel here just to see the beauty.. or to study it."
The next day went by very,
Malfoy leaned away from Harry, shaking his hair to cover his eyes. "I know the type."
Draco looked up at him for a split second and then turned away, trying to back away, but Harry had his body angled in a way that had Draco stuck between him and the wall. Harry couldn't quite place why he cared
Harry ducked under the water as Draco went to splash him.
"Beauty isn't he?"
There was silence for a moment. Harry wanted to spill everything to her. Wanted to tell her everything that has happened and what he some how got himself into. But he just can't. He doesn't want to worry her. He can't worry her. Not after everything they have been through. As far as she knows, he is having the time of his life and it will stay that way.
He leaned forward, giving Harry a kiss on his forehead, then traveled down his cheek, then across his nose. Harry finally stirred when Draco placed a kiss on the tip the nose, scrunching it up slightly, he opened his eyes.
Much like Narwhals, people also seem to communicate strictly with clicks, whistles, and bangs. At least, Harry's roommates seem to.
A loud ringing awoke Draco, he looked over to the side table to see his phone's alarm was going off.
"So that's why you responded so badly in Madam Malkins'."
They both waved him off and stood up, Harry following.
"Hm.."
the damn git so much it physically hurt. Today, Saturday, Draco was out the room before any of the other boys were even up, as usual. Harry isn't sure how considering he has been up since nearly five in the morning, from another nightmare. It was his fifth one this week alone. After hours of sitting in the library and going over multiple different theories and coming up with nothing solid about the Malfoy situation, he finally broke and asked Hermione for help.
Harry rolled his eyes, strutting forwards towards the bench, "Honestly, if singing doesn't work, I really think comedy might be your next best shot at stardom."
are brilliant, Draco."
Draco Malfoy slowly shuffled into the hotel's breakfast lounge, making a cup of tea and a big serving of eggs and bagels. Once his plate was made, he looked around the unusually packed room. Every other morning he has gotten to the room right at opening so he could have the place all to himself. Due to the decent amount of alcohol he consumed the night prior, he was a little behind on his normal morning routine.
Draco looked towards his friends before continuing, "Extremely strong. Magic is what allowed us to heal you and it is what allows this room to appear as what we are assuming to be your homeland, we weren't sure how your magic would react to the charms or our own forms of magic, so we had to have some precautions. Now that we know you won't effect our own magic, I promise you no more restraints." He took a step closer to the cat. "Please, kitty, let me take my friends back up and I promise you I will make sure that no restraints are allowed on you, as long as you let us help you."
Draco faced the cage once more, rolling his eyes at the blubbering idiots that caught the cat, "Thomas, those men don't know how to give a straight answer even if someone was answering for them. Truly, it doesn't matter too much about where, if he is as strong and powerful as you insinuated I'd more like to know how they captured him."
A low rumble came from the cat as his eyes looked frantically around himself.
Harry turned to look at him, "I'm probably not the one you should apologize to."
Draco leaned in a little closer, close enough that he could smell the mint from Potter's tooth paste, "Alright, you're on."
Harry chuckles lightly, "Yeah, everything is fine. I just waned to call and chat for a minute. I didn't wake you did I?"
All Hampton's blood ran cold as his uncle nodded.
Harry didn't sleep well that night. Not from nightmares or anxiety that usually was the cause of his insomnia, but from questions that his mind was constantly supplying. Why was Fleur here last night? Why was she with Malfoy? What was he talking about that was too dangerous?
"Um, Yeah I have actually made a.. friend here that I have been hanging out with. He is a musician that's here to do a few shows. He's bringing me along to one of his shows tonight. "
"Is this seat taken?" He asked even as he started sitting down. The person moaned. Draco took that as a yes and dug into his breakfast.
They rode in silence for a mile or two before the man spoke up again, "Coming from up North of the island it looks to be some sort of storm. Hopefully it isn't anything too drastic. About a week ago we had a storm come through that nearly killed our Ol' Howler. Have you heard about Her?"
Harry and Draco glanced at each, both very confused.
"Ah! Well, if it isn't Mr. Potter as well! How do you do Mr. Harry? Are you enjoying our beautiful island?"
Harry turned his head against Draco's, pressing their foreheads together gently, "The past few years, all I have been able to think about is that I'm not safe. No matter where I was, there was always this looming voice that constantly reminded me that their are people out here that want me dead. The voice sounded a lot like Hermione if I'm being honest." He gently laughed, the breath tickling Draco's nose, "I stayed locked up in my house. I never wanted to leave because I just knew it wasn't over, and not just the Death Eaters but all of it. All the questions, all the worried looks. But I realized that it might never be fully over, and that I had to get out. So I decided on a small muggle island, hoping I would finally get a chance to be normal, to be free of everything that has happened. God, I think the creators of the universe are a bit touched in the head with the crazy shit they are constantly throwing around my life."
The man let out a soft chuckle and backed away from the door, "Well, I will see you out there,
"Is he okay? What's wrong with him?" Harry's voice broke with every word but he couldn't care less. He just wanted Draco to be okay. That's all that mattered.
Harry's eye fell to the guitar. Seeing Draco, he momentarily forgotten about his conversation.
As soon as he got off the stage, Draco ran to his phone to type Pansy a quick SOS text. It took her three minutes and forty seconds to call him. Draco panicked the whole time he waited.
A small women holding a brown-haired toddler and the hand of a blonde headed little girl, walked in glancing around. She smiled brightly when she noticed them.
Harry turned fully towards the other boy, "You knew Snape was the Half-Blood Prince?"
"Let's go-"
"And when Draco finds out? Nothing could stop him from coming for your head, and you know it." He leaned in closer so only Pansy and Harry could hear, "Even without his inheritance you know how possessive and defensive Draco is."
Harry stared down at Draco's chest, "Forest. Forest was the one who told.. could he be the one who told me, too?" He racked his brain trying to think back on that night, "Why did I have to be get so drunk that night.."
, "What was he talking about being too dangerous?"
Malfoy made a disapproving noise, "Don't trust me to lead you to the right place, Potter?" The awkward, uncomfortable atmosphere they were just in melted away.
He shook his head, pushing the lingering warmth and tingling sensations away and with a sigh, Harry walked out the library, and headed back to the castle.
Harry spun to look at the boy, the innuendo not going unnoticed.
Harry stepped around Malfoy and into the kitchen before turning back to him, trying to push how much he means his next words with his voice and facial expressions. "Even with all the deaths, all the pain. I, honestly, think a few things seemed to have worked out alright in the end."
Harry began walking to the cafe when he suddenly felt a wave of small shocks down his arms and back. He looked behind him, recognizing the sensations immediately, his eyes searched for Malfoy, but couldn't see him anywhere. Curious, he turned away from the cafe and began walking deeper into the library.
Harry leaned away from the boy, attempting to swallow the feeling of the fire, "I-I'm sorry. I didn't hear what you were saying."
When he first began working with animals, he started off large dealing with dragons out in Romania, after being sent there by the Ministry for a year as a form of community service to pay his debts for his hand in the war. The Ministry said it was to help out with the large number of dragons that had formed in the areas and to help him learn responsibility for ones own actions. Draco thinks he was sent there in hopes that he would accidentally catch on fire or get trampled by the winged beast. Sadly, neither of them happened. If anything, the opposite happened. Draco fell in love with the beasts. Many times he wondered if his year in Romania was what sparked his saving-creatures love, but thinking back he would realize how this obsession started much sooner than that. Maybe during the war, or perhaps even before that? He never could be sure. As the year of his services closed, Draco knew he couldn't go back home, not yet, so when given the opportunity to stay in Romania and continue his work, he jumped at the chance, only coming back to his home land a little after a year later due to his father falling ill. After his Father passed, he gravely wished he could return to his dragons, but knew in his heart he couldn't leave his mother to mourn alone.
It did seem to slip slightly after a moment, but it was soon over-taken by a soft warmth and tingles that danced upon his back and shoulders. He reveled in the warmth, only jumping slightly when the bathroom door opened behind him.
"Five."
Harry sat at a desk all the way in the back of the library staring out the window, watching as rain poured from the sky, creating tiny ponds throughout the grassy fields. No matter what he did, he couldn't get Draco out of his mind. He honestly
the title read.
Draco sat back down, closer to the panther this time. He watched the cat as he stared into the water sulkily. "Do you miss home?" Draco asked. "I know I miss mine. My old home, mind. It was a large Manor, we called it the Malfoy Manor." Léon twitched. "It was beautiful. You would have loved the forest we had surrounding it. Oaks so tall and large you felt like you could touch the sky in them. I used to climb them any chance I could. My farther didn't like it, though. Said that a proper heir didn't spend time in trees, he spent his time learning. Learning magick, learning the trades of the family business, learning how to cheat your way into and out of any situation."
Malfoy smirked, never looking up from his book, "Why are you on this hill beneath a tree talking to me?"
They laid like that for what felt like hours, but were only a few minutes.
"Hey, Malfoy." Harry sluggishly whispered with a yawn.
"Why don't we set you up in one of the private rooms to chat, Headmistress?" Madame Pomfrey offered.
With a fresh day a head of him with no obligations, Harry began feeling completely contempt. Here he sat on the hotel's porch looking out at the beautiful ocean with a cup of coffee in his hands and a belly full of eggs, sausage, and danishes. Pulling out his map, he looked around for what he could do that day. He finally decided on going around and looking at the shops that they had along the boardwalk.
Draco ran his hands over his face, “It was Forest. The man who gave her the information was Forest.”
Hampton at least had the decency to look a little ashamed. "I'm sorry but you looked like you were about to blow a fuse. I understand the extent of how bad this is but I am telling you Uncle would not put everyone's life in danger."
Unlucky for him, Draco now had something else
He sat up slowly, Léon walking around him till he was sat in the front of Draco. The panther's eyes, which had lighten just a little bit again, ran over Draco's body before settling on Draco's eyes.
As someone attempted to push through the door, Draco was pushed towards Harry, nearly falling over but balancing them both at the last moment. Standing up their eyes met sharply, Harry opened his mouth but abruptly closed as the person coming out the bar exited.
Hampton laughed, "Yes, like the pork. And your name is better?"
Their uncle laid his hands on the edges of the arm rest, "There is much more to be lose than just beauty."
After his last hour, double potions and death wishes, he finally had enough of the quiet. He searched for Hermione to have some sort of conversation, even if it was about their Ancient Runes assignment that was due in two days time, but to no avail. The bushy haired girl was no wheres to be found. Harry considered going and getting his Marauder's Map but didn't want to risk seeing his roommates - by roommates, he means one roommate in particular.
Harry thought back on his trip. Everything seemed to be pretty normal- as normal as randomly choosing a tiny island in the muggle world for the same weekend as someone who, until recently, you hated and knew from the magical world can be.
Slowly, Draco stood up, as did the panther. "So.. you are.. was that.. who is the little boy?"
The walk was silent, not in an awkward way but not in a comfortable way either.
Harry couldn't help but smile, "Of course."
Slowly making his way down the boardwalk, Harry sipped on an iced lemonade, stopping only at a few shops that peaked his interest. He was almost at the end of the strip when he noticed a small little shop tucked between a large tourist shop and a bakery. The small shack was made up of rusted metal and what looked like dark oak logs. There were many colorful plants outside the door that seemed to contrast perfectly with the dark dimness of the shop.
The panther stared for a moment longer before glancing at the dishes laid out beside him. He slowly stood and walked closer to the dishes, keeping his eyes on Draco, even as he settled into his meal.
"Hello, professor." They greeted back.
For the passed two years Draco and his friends have eaten dinner together once every first Friday of the month; on more than one occasion a Friday night dinner resulted in a Saturday afternoon breakfast. Today the three sat in a very rustic, country-style muggle restaurant named
"It's alright. I completely understand. Over the years, I know I have torn you down, Granger, I know that and I could never show nor tell you just how sorry I am about it. And I know there is nothing I could ever say or do to earn your forgiveness, and I'm not asking for it. But I really am sorry for all I have done and said to both you and about your family and your boyfriend and your cat."
Harry smiled at Draco as he stumbled over his words, "No we aren't. I mean.. when we first met I thought maybe but then last night happened and now I'm almost positive he never wants to see me again."
Granger took another breath in. "I swear if this magical cat doesn't kill me the annoying ass dragon will." She muttered as she stood up. "As much as I love getting to catch up with you, Draco, I must be off. I have many obligations this week as well as this weekend, but I'll owl you if anything changes. If not, would you be free to begin Monday evening? We can meet in my office and work there."
He grabbed the closest jar, examining it closely, "Harry.." he Draco whisper, "these are potion ingredients. All of these jars."
Draco shook his head, "No, I don't believe I have."
Harry and Malfoy caught each others eyes. They stared for a moment before both agreeing.
, that speech does very little to appease me."
, if I thought he was just an animal that happen to be understanding, one look into his eyes and you would know instantly that he is more than just an animal. Last week, I swear he even-" Draco cut himself off, unsure if he should tell her what happened with the vines.
"Um.. yes, m'am."
It was Malfoy's turn to shrug, "Maybe I like the feel of wood."
A broken whimper came out of Hampton as Harry's hands tightened on his wrist. Harry loosened his grip slightly.
that Draco felt, but barely heard, startled the boy, causing him to scoot closer to the wall behind him. As Draco turned to take a look at his surroundings, the scene shifted, placing him in a small cage, tied up like an animal.
“..rens.” Draco whispered hoarsely.
Draco ran an arm across Harry's chest, putting his head against the side of Harry's. "Shh, It's going to be okay," Draco tried to sooth, but his voice was coming out as broken as Harry felt, "I'm not going to let anyone hurt you. I promise you I won't let anyone hurt you. Not now, not ever. No one, not even Death Eaters will be able to hurt you, okay? I won't allow it. Do you understand me?"
Draco cupped his hand over his head, falling to the floor as the loud scream echoed through his mind and scenes flashed in front of his eyes.
As Draco watched them load into the car, Harry turned and caught his eyes. For a split second it looked as if Harry was about to leave the car and walk over to him. Instead, Harry's eyebrows furled and he stepped into the car.
The cat's mind was still as closed as ever but Draco could still hear an echoing of
Once he was able to get his breathing and his erratic heart under control, Harry leaned against the sink.
Two hours after breakfast, Harry found himself strolling around the island. He had stopped at a few of the mom-and-pop shops that were placed around the town, but he mainly just enjoyed the quiet, peaceful nature of the town. This is exactly what he hoped for when he randomly decided on taking a vacation three days ago on a depressed, drunk Tuesday night. No one expecting anything from him. No stares as he walked around the town. No one stopping him for a picture or an autograph or to question him about his victory. He always assumed that after a few years the stopping and staring at him would lessen but if anything it's gotten worse over the past two years. People became more brave, stopping him while he is out to eat with friends or shopping for groceries to ask
The movement had Draco's eyes thrown open, the darkest steel grey Harry had ever seen looking at him with gold wrapped around his pupils. Reality seem to hit Draco like a truck and he slammed his body across the hall, hitting his head against the bricks.
It wasn't a big list, nor was it a very useful one, but it was a list all the same.
"Where is he?" Harry instantly asked.
Draco smiled softly as he began walking towards the water.
Malfoy's smile was sad, and Harry knew he had to wipe the sadness away. He reached over, lightly touching Malfoy's arm, causing the boy to suck in his breath and the electricity to return to Harry's hand. Harry glanced down at his hand for a moment, before ignoring the feeling to focus on the boy instead, "Well, if you want to talk about it, you know where I stay. In case you can't remember, I could draw you a map to be able to get to my quarters easier."
“Definitely,” Draco responded, confused and flummoxed at the bizarre display before them. A Malfoy was not trusting by nature, and therefore he was a tad bit worried that they had walked into some sort of trap. “Perhaps the muggles’ tale is true, and Nimue will soon arrive to bury us under the stones right next to Merlin.”
Draco furrowed his brow. Had he not had a home with his aunt and uncle?
Harry laughed and pressed their foreheads together. “Really, though.”
As he predicted, she was anxious to discuss the previous evening, so he attempted to keep his grumblings in regard to Mr. Weasley to a minimum. She was exceptionally taken with Mrs. Granger-Weasley’s wit and educational accomplishments. His mother, too, was a competent and talented witch, though at times he feared that she had not pursued her own talents and interests in order to stand as a dutiful wife and doting mother. Why had his father not encouraged her more?
“Are you prepared for our meeting with Mr. Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley?” He asked.
Today, Potter’s spectacles were slightly askew, and Draco wanted to reach out and straighten them, linger his fingertips on his jawline, brush his thumb along his soft lips.
“Wait. Did you not know you were a wizard?”
“If we are trying to reenter society, then I suppose this sort of thing should be expected.” She looked up and forced a smile onto her face. He was unsure if she was trying to convince him or herself. “Now, hurry and eat, or we will be late for our meeting.”
If the world would just
“So fifteen years too late.”
“Our thoughts?” Potter asked. “It is brilliant! The display and the lists and— and everything!”
Draco turned fully on his side so that the tainted arm was hidden beneath his body. “No. It’s hideous. How can you even stand to look at it?”
“I do not get the chance to see many new people. We are very happy to have you here,” Mrs. Potter exclaimed.
family protected him because it was tied to the blood of his muggle-born mother. It was so strong that the Dark Lord himself could not break it.”
“Our sister murdered my daughter. Your Dark Lord’s pet wolf murdered my husband. And I do not hear a word from you until you need something from me.” Her voice was sharp and unyielding, until she looked over at Draco. She deflated instantly. “Excuse me, Draco. I do not… include you in this,” she said softly.
A week later, Draco received another missive from Professor Bernard, this time with a request.
“Miss them,” he whispered, ducking his head as he spoke.
“Yes, yes, please,” he uttered breathlessly and Harry began to thrust within him slowly, the two of them sharing kisses as they moved against one another. Soon the languid pace was not enough to sate the desperation of their desires, and Harry moved within him, harder and quicker, Draco clutching at Harry’s back, slick with sweat. He was already close to climax when Harry’s hand reached between them to wrap around his prick, and it was enough to send him over the edge, crying out in pleasure as Harry followed soon afterward, the softest whimper escaping his lips.
Draco grabbed her hand. “I do regret that this conversation has turned this way, but I would not lie to you. I never discussed my studies with you as I did not want to upset you.” He placed the notes into her hand. “Please read these. I hope they will provide you with some understanding.”
would not be so terrible. Maybe we can be done with him once and for all.”
“Are you courting anyone? Is there a special someone in your life? You are a wealthy man who must be in want of a wife. My readers are dying to know.” She leaned forward in anticipation at such an unnatural angle that Draco thought a breeze might knock her over.
this morning.”
“Oh!” Miss Lovegood said.
“A walk would be just fine.” Potter grabbed both brooms and looked down, as if he were deciding which one to give to Draco to carry.
As he entered the dining room for breakfast, he saw his mother for the first time since their quarrel, and he gave her a nervous smile.
Draco disapparated and arrived at the steps of 12 Grimmauld Place. He had not been here since he had been a very small boy when his Great-Aunt Walburga had still been alive. It seemed much the same on the outside, though he was almost too nervously distracted to notice. His hand shook as he reached for the knocker, but Potter was already opening it before he touched it.
“Erm, yes,” he said, suddenly feeling self-conscious. No doubt she had asked because of their public history of animosity, but he felt his own face redden. “Yes, one could say that.”
“Mama—”
“Thank you, my dear,” the woman responded. “I had so much to carry today that Mr. Potter was kind enough to come retrieve me and let me side-along with him. I didn’t want to take Hilda through the floo, you see.”
“To answer your question… I do not believe he has intentions for anyone.”
“Did you bring robes for flying? If not, I am sure my valet could find some for you.”
“Yes, I have already spent the morning in our gardens. It would have been relaxing, but the gnomes are quite feisty this year.” She looked at him in earnest. “Your note was really very kind, Mr. Malfoy. And unexpected.”
She laughed. “I believe our mothers have been conversing about dinner. Perhaps you will visit us soon?” Draco had not only forgotten about that dinner, but he had also lost track of the hour.
“We do have a well-stocked library,” Potter continued. “My family’s collection was already quite remarkable, but Hermione has improved upon it considerably. You must peruse it before you leave and borrow whatever you would like.”
“We unfortunately don’t have much time before heading to the Burrow for the day, but I can ring for tea?”
“It is a surprise.”
“Well?” Weasley asked, waiting for both his answer and his move.
“He left,” Draco responded. His voice was hoarse from crying.
“Good evening,” Potter breathed. His smile was nervous.
“No, but thank you very much for the reading,” Miss Lovegood replied. She turned to Draco. “Are you well?”
for betaing and to
at the end of the interview as Mrs. Skeeter “has ways of hiding in places she does not belong,” and to say that he was friends with Mrs. Granger-Weasley if things went awry.
Potter’s eyes averted to the creek. “I have known her most of my life,” he replied after a long moment.
Draco did not sleep well that night. He could not stop thinking about his conversation with Weasley, and he kept envisioning his smug grin when he had won the chess match.
“Good evening,” Potter said with a bow. “Mrs. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy.” His dress robes were plain but fine, however Draco eyed his black and silver brocade waistcoat with envy. He would have to inquire about its origins.
“She would be your mother-in-law, not mine.”
“Yes. I—” he stopped, as if warring to continue. He looked to Draco and then back at the water.
“No, Mrs. Figg only comes to help out on our busiest days, and you are my only meeting at the office today. Hermione has another obligation.” Draco looked up from his notes in shock at Potter’s informality. It was quite strange for a man to call a married woman by her first name, even if she were his own wife. Potter seemed to notice his faux pas and gave a sheepish grin. “I mean Mrs. Granger-Weasley.”
“Yes,” Harry said before his brows furrowed. “Draco, I’m sorry about Ron.”
“Ah, no,” Mrs. Granger-Weasley chimed in. Draco could see the sudden wariness in Potter’s face. “Mr. Potter tries to stay away from the press as much as possible.”
“Roast, I believe,” Draco replied, questioning how he knew that and feeling his cheeks flush as he realized the answer. He had spent too many hours watching Potter’s every move at Hogwarts. Though Potter was not an appalling eater like his red-headed compatriot, he remembered Potter often eating as though the food may disappear from his plate at any moment. He had seen the same behaviour from starving beggars on the street, though the idea of someone starving
“It is… acceptable,” Kreacher replied. Draco did not remember much about Kreacher but he took his response to mean that the house elf was actually quite happy here. “Please allow Kreacher to take your bag.”
“And purchase a gift for Mr. and Mrs. Greengrass. I will write a note to accompany it. It should arrive by this evening.”
“That defeats the purpose of this match-making scheme.”
All of the sudden, he began to slowly fall to the earth.
He had already begun; he may as well spill his soul to a woman he barely knew. “Bad history precedes every Slytherin, so much so that many of us simply embrace it. But to visit the Tomb of Merlin, to feel the power that still radiates from its stones, and to know that he was the greatest wizard in history. To know that he, too, was a Slytherin, but did not choose darkness. To be ambitious and cunning but not,” he sneered, “
“I miss you. I know I should not, but I do.”
Then, of course, there was
would only make it worse.
“Ah yes.” A grin threatened to grow at the corner of Potter’s mouth, but he schooled his features in time. “I was mistaken.” Potter stood up and leaned over to kiss Mrs. Tonks’s cheek. “Good afternoon, Mrs. Tonks. Are you enjoying the party thus far?”
Harry Potter had been preposterous, and he would always dismiss it seconds later.
“Very well,” she said when she finished. “Kreacher, please take notes.” The elf snapped his fingers and parchment and a pencil appeared in his hands. “Before you are drafts of the menu and guest lists. Please feel free to add any additions to the guest lists by this Friday. We will need to order and send invitations as soon as possible. You will also see finalist lists for bands, florists, decorators, and caterers.”
Draco took a shaky breath, the realization of what both of them had endured at the hands of a madman hitting him all at once. And yet, Harry was here with him, soft and warm, vibrant and bright. He pressed his hand against Harry’s chest and felt the life coursing through him, his own heart pounding in a shared rhythm.
Draco could not help but smile in return, as if Potter’s happiness itself were infectious. His gut twisted in an odd sort of feeling that he could not quite identify.
“Oh?” Draco did not realize this, though, when he thought back, he had only seen Potter in the office and in their homes. And the office was unmarked.
“Was that alright?” Harry asked, and Draco chuckled.
“Have you chosen your house for the ball?” he asked.
will not have her?” Harry asked.
“Do you even need a wand anymore?” Draco asked, taking Potter’s hand in his own.
“Yes. Longing.”
Her nostrils flared, and her mouth formed a thin line. “Yes, I am now married, and yes, I have retained my maiden name.” Her tone was clipped, and Draco had no doubt that she had said the same exact thing many times before. It was no wonder — Draco had never heard of such a thing, and he honestly could not believe that there had not been a very public scandal over it. A married witch keeping her maiden name!
Draco did his best to not sigh in frustration. “Yes, well, as I mentioned previously, I have only just returned to England, and I am aware of the work my family must do in hopes of mending the damage it has done to our world. I am hopeful that you will see the olive branch for what it is, and allow us to work together for the greater good.”
“Yes?”
“It probably only steals from Death Eaters,” said Draco. It seemed like an animal with a vendetta.
Draco shook his head to dismiss it. “I have discussed the idea of the inter-house unity ball with my mother and we have several ideas to get us started. We would like to hold the event off Hogwarts grounds while still giving guests the feeling of being in the Great Hall. Enchanted ceilings, meals traditionally served at the school, and such. The dress code will be formal, however there will be a twist: guests will be required to wear colors that correspond to a house that was not their own.”
He’d been staring at the empty chair at the head of the table with a sheen of sweat coming up on the back of his neck when his mother had broken the silence.
With Draco no longer having to worry about Potter, he turned his focus back to his studying. He sent a few more gossipy letters to Pansy telling her to look out for information involving the Ministry.
Draco waved a lazy hand behind him, vaguely gesturing to his friends. “We’re all watching now Edgecombe. Slip up once and we’ll see it. Think about it and we’ll
Hello! I know it's been a very long while, but I'm back now. I had a lot of good reasons to have taken a break, but the important part is that I'm back. In fact I have three chapters all set that should keep me from having any big breaks again, barring unseen circumstances of course. I plan to post them every other Friday. It's only just barely Friday here, but I wanted to make sure I got this out.
It was disgustingly cute even if Draco had no idea what that was. He smiled fondly at it.
enemy, Draco was the only one who should be allowed to hurt Potter.
Both of his friends wore matching frowns. Pansy uncrossed her arms. “What does that matter to you? Surely the Bitch wouldn’t presume to go through
Draco had managed to pull himself together in time to head to History of Magic after breakfast, Pansy catching him before they left and casting the glamour he’d taught her on his puffy red eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vincent made a low noise in his throat and Draco swallowed. From now on he’d have to be more careful.
Draco nudged his arm. “Fine, I’ll help you. Let’s go to the Library. I’m assuming you don’t want Vincent to know you’ve asked?”
, betray you like that Draco.”
Potter’s face was tense, his eyes dark. It sent a shiver down Draco’s spine. “Voldemort doesn’t want people to know he’s back, so he’s using his Death Eaters to influence the Ministry into keeping its stance against me and Dumbledore so that he can hide better?”
When it was Monday again and time for classes, Draco spent as little time as he could get away with with Pansy and Blaise. He turned to Vincent and Greg, claiming he felt badly for neglecting their tutoring. He spent a lot of time with his Quidditch team practicing and mocking the other teams for taking so long to reform with the first game coming up. He’d gone and met Luna again after one of Potter’s meetings, careful not to mention his suspicions.
It took Draco all of Saturday to decide, but he ended up telling Pansy and Blaise about Potter’s plans. They pestered him endlessly about his source, but Draco refused to reveal anything.
Severus put a heavy hand on Draco’s shoulder and Draco partially turned to look at him. “It’s a time of great change and upheaval, Draco. Time to make a lot of hard choices. I just want you to be ready to handle those choices.”
Blackness creeping along the edges of his vision alerted him that something was wrong. He snapped his head away, but the blackness followed. He felt like he was underwater. Had he been poisoned? A hand ripped his letter from his hands, and arms practically lifted him up off the bench and started dragging him out of the Great Hall.
Pansy frowned. “I already did before you sat down. But we can’t keep doing this in the Great Hall, other Slytherins will say something. That we’re conspiring against the house.”
Luna broke through Draco’s contemplation. “Cho Chang has been quite emotional this year, understandably. I don’t think it’s the first time she’s gotten frustrated at the knocker and started crying. I should really go help her in, I’ve been worried that she might turn into a squonk. If she does I’d quite like to see it. Although I suppose it’d be better manners to prevent her from succumbing to it.”
Draco surprised himself when he spoke up. “I can’t imagine not trusting either of you after this. I hope that doesn’t hurt any of us in the end.”
Luna hummed in agreement, even as she tightened her hold on his arm and started moving again. “There is. Don’t worry about the list though, I took your advice and used my initials. Hermione liked the idea so much she had everyone use theirs and she said she triple checked that her curse was still functional.”
Potter not allowed to play Quidditch?
People arrived quickly. Draco wasn’t surprised when he saw what seemed to be all of the fifth year Gryffindors. Longbottom and Thomas came in, practically dragging between them a protesting sandy haired boy that Draco vaguely recalled was named Finnigan. His exploding cauldrons were quite well-known. Once Finnigan got through the door, though, he pulled away to sit down on the other side of the pub from Draco. Thomas and Longbottom looked upset but didn’t push him.
Pansy bumped him with her hip in exasperation. “Alright then, I’ll start spreading it around. Let’s get you to the dorms before you fall asleep at Snape’s desk. I’m not carrying your fat ass.”
The first DA meeting and Draco gets a letter.
Pansy gave a startled laugh. “You’re such a ponce.”
There was a long pause as Umbridge set her quill back down again. Her words were slow and sure when she addressed him. “Are you bribing a Ministry official Mr. Malfoy? Using Potter’s ridiculous lies at that.” She paused to let her words sink in. Draco allowed his cold smile to melt off his face. “Tut, tut, Mr. Malfoy. Imagine if your father could hear you now. He’d be, so, disappointed.” Draco practically held his breath as Umbridge smiled. “I had high hopes for you Mr. Malfoy. But I’m afraid I’ll have to give you a week's detention. Any more
Draco turned his glare on Pansy, now much less guilty about her eye bags. “Are you going to help me with Edgecombe or not?”
Draco felt a bit like an idiot. It made sense that the carriages were pulled by thestrals. Hardly anybody could see them these days and Hogwarts was known for having the first trained herd. But. “You could see the thestrals your first year?”
killed you for a minute. What did you
Draco kept his head down when Blaise spoke. “If she’s watching the Floo as well as owl mail we’re all going to have some problems in an emergency. No Floo-calling our parents, or fast escapes, when the Ministry is watching. They’ll have Aurors at our doors as fast as they can Apparate. It’s even worse for Potter’s gang. If anyone found out the sorts of places Potter went when he’s not at school he could have some real problems.”
of someone using a Black Quill in that manner before, and he’d heard of some truly disgusting torture methods from some of the books in the manor’s library. The fact that she’d use it on a fifteen year old on top of that was unfathomable to Draco. The Dark Lord could take lessons from her.
The next night while studying after dinner, Draco got another message from Luna.
While he was gone, he always forgot how lonely the manor was.
Greg gave his arm a bewildered look before nodding his agreement. Draco turned away from him to start marching off, hiding his embarrassment at having shown any sort of physical affection. He was getting far too complacent with all these friends he had now. “Let’s go then.”
It was the early hours of the morning. A couple hours before the rest of the house was due to start waking. Draco had been down in the common room. He was making the buttons for Potter’s debut as champion. He hadn’t noticed the common room emptying many hours ago, or that his hair was now falling in a mess around his face from all the times he’d run his hands through it. He definitely hadn’t noticed he’d started muttering to himself as he flitted around the table the buttons were spread over.
Draco purposely let his face soften. His voice almost came out as a croak. “Thanks Pansy. I do appreciate it.”
Pansy raised both of hers in response. “What? We’ve only been talking to you the past couple minutes.” Pansy got a sly look on her face that made Draco want to take a step backwards. “Were you daydreaming about Potter again?” She put her hands together under her chin and made a kissy face. “Imagining if you were fooling around with
She suddenly burst into speech again, making both boys flinch. “And mother! She lets his body sit and rot in a back room because she’d rather have an evil, awful person in her house than risk losing her
Draco kicked him as hard as he could in the shin, making him almost fall off the bench as he overbalanced.
Draco turned his face, finally freeing himself from those damn eyes, and stood up. He’d been so stupid. He paused a few steps away when he realized that Potter hadn’t moved. “Ten points from Gryffindor for being infuriating, Potter.”
When they got to the door Luna let go of Draco’s arm, and instead of grabbing the handle, turned to look at him. Draco met her eyes for a second before glancing away. Luna had a look like she could see your soul. “It’s okay for you to have feelings for him. It doesn’t make you a bad person. Love can only be a good thing you know.”
Draco nodded, suddenly tense. That question boded nothing like good news. “Why? Why ask, when you know I have?”
Pansy rolled her eyes and pushed Blaise off her shoulder so she could walk over to Draco’s bed and sit down. “It’s only fair, Draco. We know his secrets. It seems like we’ll be putting up with him for awhile now anyway and he already half figured it out.” Pansy turned to address Blaise now. “That being said, if you say anything they’ll never find your body.”
Draco sat up straighter on the bench and looked down his nose at Pansy. “It was. She sent along a book I’d forgotten.”
The next morning he didn’t want to leave his bed. He didn’t know how he’d handle seeing Pansy and Blaise. The more he thought about how it could have been them the more sense it made. If Umbridge was banning all clubs of three or more people in an effort to stop Potter, instead of going after him directly, then maybe she didn’t really know much concrete information.
Draco let out a snort against his will. “No, I wasn’t talking to a thestral. Professor Snape wanted a word, not that it’s any of your business. Where did you even run into a thestral in the first place?”
Draco arched his own eyebrow . “Keeping track are you?” Draco knew he should feel annoyed, but a persistent satisfaction curled the corner of his mouth up in a mocking smile.
Edgecombe turned and ran, almost tripping twice.
influential in
He hadn’t gone far up the train when he heard an all too familiar voice. He stopped and held up a hand to quiet Vincent and Greg. Hearing Granger talk about Skeeter sent ice flowing through his blood. It didn’t sound like she’d realized she could get pretty much all the Slytherins in trouble for dealing with an unregistered animagus without reporting them. That was good. But what she’d done to Skeeter made Draco simmer in rage.
She smiled a little at the sight. “You’re growing up darling. I thought Lucius was done with it after the first war, once we had you to raise. But he’s gone back.” His mother’s smile dropped. “He’s gone back. He had little choice this time. He made his bed the last time. Honestly I don’t think he would choose differently even if he could.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Warrington looked considering. “Might be a couple I could look at for a spot of spying. You really think the Weasleys will let a Slytherin test their products?”
Blaise leaned around Draco to leer at Nott. “Unless you wanted a go, Nott? I’ve never kissed anyone as ugly as you, but I’ll try anything once.”
Severus sighed. “We can hope I suppose. Have you been practising your Occlumency?”
Draco practically growled and looked away from Potter. “Don’t be so small minded Potter. Of course she’s not a Death Eater, she fully believes in what she’s saying.” He turned back to Potter to impress on him what he was saying next. “That doesn’t mean that the Ministry isn’t vulnerable to Death Eater influence while they are in denial.”
Blaise rolled his eyes. “You were not. And anyway Draco’s problem is more important than hangman. Besides, I saved our game, you daft cow.”
“I have some good news to impart. The Ministry has just passed educational decree number 22. This means that in the event the headmaster is unable to find a teacher, the Ministry will choose one for them.” Lucius smirked. “Since Dumbledore is a bumbling fool, he’s been unable to find a new defense teacher.”
mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it --”
When he saw Potter leave dinner early to head to his detention, he was quick to slip out after him, Vincent and Greg too busy eating to notice.
Draco shrugged and Pansy scoffed. Pansy was the one to address it, though, and Draco was happy to let her. “It’s not like he’s going to be able to be with Potter. We’ve been friends since before Hogwarts, we understand each other. We wouldn’t expect the other to do anything. It’d be better than most other matches I could make, with men I don’t know. We wouldn’t have to be faithful and I’d make my parents- my mother, happy, making a rich pureblood match.”
It was only the first day of term and already Potter was making trouble for himself. Draco couldn’t even eat dinner because he was
Draco frowned as he looked Pansy over. The dark circles under her eyes seemed to take up half her face, her eyes bloodshot and seemingly bulging out of her eye sockets the more coffee she downed. He may have felt a bit of guilt.
Even more worrying, his father hadn’t written him once.
Pansy reached over the table to Draco’s hand holding his fork. “All it’s going to do is make you see something you wish you hadn’t. Or, Merlin forbid, something that finally tips you into doing something really stupid and dragging me with you.”
What would he even do at school without Potter? The fact that he didn’t even have a guess, couldn’t even picture it, made his breath come out in short bursts.
They’d worked everything out from there. Pansy had pitied him and agreed to help him. She’d pose as his beard essentially until one or the other of them found someone they really wanted. In exchange he promised to offer his hand to Pansy himself should the need arise. If he were still single.
Blaise closed his eyes. “I got sick of always being alone. I let myself get too close to
There was a wash of cold magic over his and his mother’s hands. Draco’s eyes widened at the feeling. A spontaneous magical contract.
Draco shook his head. “No, just stiff.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pansy huffed. “If you’re staying then so am I!”
Draco suddenly knew that he hadn’t backed far enough away as Potter and one of the Weasleys charged him. Draco couldn’t find it in himself to care, grinning even as the first punch landed.
When a green badge fell out of the envelope with a clatter he practically threw his list of supplies across the table. It captured all of his attention where it glittered on his parchment. Draco felt like looking at it let him breathe for the first time all summer.
Blaise scoffed. “If you want us to leave because you don’t feel good, you could just say. You don’t need to be a ponce about it.”
Draco and Luna talked a bit more about some of Luna’s creatures until they were almost to the top of the spiral stairs. They both stopped at the same time, hearing sobbing coming from where the Ravenclaw entrance should be.
Pound of flesh indeed.
But by the time he’d landed, Johnson was already checking on him and he was already brushing it off.
Potter was paying far more attention to Weasley than to Draco, but Draco could hardly bring himself to care for once, the anticipation thrumming through his veins. When he thought he’d make himself sick from excitement he grabbed Vince and Greg and practically ran down to the pitch to get ready. Normally he’d be a bit worried about their first real game, but with Draco’s plan in place it was practically a moot point. Draco hummed his song all the way down and through getting ready.
Draco couldn’t look her in the eyes anymore. No one had ever talked to him like that. Had ever said that he was fine the way he was. Everyone always wanted him to be better: better at studies, better at Occlumency, better at Quidditch, a better heir. He wasn’t sure he remembered a time where he could let himself relax and be who he was.
So Draco did what he was finding he did best, he avoided the problem. He stayed in his bed as much as he could the whole weekend, burying himself in homework and Occlumency practice. He wrote a bland letter to his parents, he talked about strange creatures in the diary with Luna. When anyone came knocking he was quick to send them away in clipped tones that conveyed just how busy he was.
Draco clicked his tongue. “I don’t see why you care anyway Blaise, you don’t have to marry either of us.”
him, and anything short of
So Draco watched and bided his time. He could see Potter getting more and more angry at the world and Umbridge and her poor teaching and lies. It wasn’t the good look Draco thought it might be. It made him unreasonably worried.
Looking from the door, Draco glimpsed Luna and Granger already at the big table in the back. He was glad not to see Potter yet. In front of the partial wall that hid the big table Luna and Granger were setting up, Draco spotted an empty table. Draco sat with his back to the partition so he could see the door and would hear them if the spell went wrong. Pansy sat next to him, also adjacent to the window; she’d honed a special skill of covert observation, mostly using pocket mirrors. Blaise sat across from Draco and lounged back in his seat, able to look over Draco’s head at the visible corner of the long table. Draco picked him for the position, knowing that if something did go wrong he’d be the least likely to lose his cool.
Draco gave Pansy a horrified look. “Are they really?”
I want to shout out to the Harry Potter Lexicon. I would not be able to do this without their day by day calendars. It really helps me to know the exact date of all the events.
The words burned on Draco’s tongue, but he continued to smile. Umbridge picked her quill back up and started absently marking the parchment she had been working on when he’d burst in, now giving him only half her attention. “Yes, well. Liars must be punished.”
Luna abruptly stopped trying to skip. “You mustn’t take anything he might have said to you to heart. He’s been dealing with quite the Wrackspurt problem. They make your thoughts all fuzzy you know.”
2.  I found out about the Black Quill/Blood Quill thing fairly recently, so I knew it's official name but not it's origins when I wrote about it. It's lore will be a bit mixed.
Draco sat up and rubbed his eyes. His voice was still scratchy when he said, “I’m up Pansy. What is it? Whatever it is better actually be important.”
The Gryffindor-Slytherin Quidditch match and aftermath.
Blaise faced forward resolutely. “Everyone knows Potter’s punishment now. Him and the Weasley twins were given a lifetime ban on Quidditch. Umbridge has declared that she’s in charge of all school punishments now. The Slytherins are celebrating, but the rest of the school blames you.”
Luna was slow to answer. “Well…. It wasn’t Marietta Edgecombe that told Umbridge.” Draco froze on the spot. “That’s why you think you're to blame, right?”
Draco hissed when he saw what the injury was. He read it aloud without thinking in a whisper. “I must not tell lies.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He finally pushed his letter and the spare parchment away with a groan, startling Pansy and Blaise who were playing wizard’s hangman on the other side of Uncle Severus’s desk.
Potter’s eyes narrowed. Draco knew he was about to get yelled at again. He headed it off. His voice was tense and defensive. “I care alright. Don’t ask me why.”
Draco stared up at his curtains. “Do you really think you could kill like she does?”
Draco thought it was all good revenge for not only ignoring his help, but for all the time he spent thinking of him and all the dreams Draco had had of his eyes on him that made him wake up with a wet spot on his sheets. It felt like he was going crazy. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could take it without breaking.
Draco was a little surprised to find that Granger and the Weasel were also prefects, although after thinking it through it made a kind of sense. There was no way
My secret alternate title for this chapter is Molly Does Too Much Research About Cyphers. I'm sorry in advance but please put up with it, I wanted to use my new info lol.
Sorry this Chapter took a bit longer, right after I posted the last one I got a new job, and with the virus stuff going on it's especially busy as it's a pharmacy tech job. Thank your health care workers! Doctors are so busy they can't always answer their phones around here.
Draco was quick to swing around and confront him. “Just what do you think you’re doing?”
They all laid quiet and clutching each other as the Veritaserum wore off.
He still wasn’t sure what to do about everything. But a prudent Malfoy was one who kept their options open and Potter was the key to most of his, so it could hardly hurt to make sure he didn’t get into too much trouble.
Edgecombe shot a sideways look at her friends. “Why don’t you head up to Divination without me? This could take a minute and Divination is pretty far away. I wouldn’t want us all to be late.”
Draco glared.
Draco frowned and snapped. “And away from me.”
Draco
Pansy grabbed Draco’s hands away from his face so that she could stare him in the eye. Her voice was tense. “I just got a letter from my mother this morning. The Ministry made another move. She said they’ve made Umbridge the High Inquisitor. They want her to inspect other classes!”
for Merlin’s sake.
It took a second for Finnigan to stop glaring and process what Draco had said. Draco could tell exactly when Finnigan had caught his meaning. Finnigan’s eyes widened and his face paled dramatically. Draco wanted to laugh.
Draco wasn’t stupid or lacking in self-awareness, he thought as he stared up at the dark ceiling over his bed, contemplating his attitude on the train.
He ran his eyes from one side of his little group to the other. When he landed on Davies he got an idea. “Davies! You have a brother in Ravenclaw, right?”
The air instantly became heavier with intent in the pause.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
to get detention?!”
Pansy
Draco didn’t think. He landed immediately, intent on checking on Potter. If Potter had been seriously injured on his behalf…
His father cleared his throat and straightened in his chair as he addressed his family. Draco was already on edge. It was already the night of August 30th and he still hadn’t gotten his Hogwarts list or news of who the new prefects would be. He was already using Occlumency just to stop himself from hyperventilating. Whatever this was was not going to be good for his stress levels.
Draco sat up straighter in his seat, glad to finally get to his new mission. “Edgecombe is still a threat. I want to put a tail on her for a few days to get a look at her state of mind. Once I’ve sussed her out, I plan to confront her. Scare her out of Potter’s group entirely, preferably, but at the very least, I want to scare her away from telling Umbridge anything.”
None of that helped the persistent feeling of doom that crept over him. It felt like the situation was slipping through his fingers. Like his father’s cold hand clamped over the back of his neck when he made a mistake in public. He was barely able to sleep, when he did manage it it was light and filled with flashes of blood and his father’s eyes.
When Luna finally,
But as Monday crept in, Draco knew the peace couldn’t last. He had to set aside his calm, and even the mystery of who had tattled to Umbridge, to tackle the upcoming Slytherin-Gryffindor Quidditch game. There were Slytherins to rally and Gryffindors to curse, even Halloween passing with little notice in the chaos.
Milli leaned around Pansy to answer before she could. “She’s dead boring. She follows every single rule, hangs out with the same goody-good type girls, has no apparent romantic interest in anyone, and writes to her parents every other day. She’s even middling in every subject! She’s the most boring person I’ve ever seen!”
Much thanks to my beta: FerchKalvaNiibi
every week than admit to an adult that you need help?! Even if it could mean helping with the war?!” Draco stood up. “I didn’t know you’d rather drown in your own pride than
Draco motioned Edgecombe to follow him down the rarely used side hallway. She glanced back in the direction of her friends before following him. Once Draco was in position he turned and smiled at her, feeling like a shark about to swallow small, helpless, mackerel whole.
He was bewildered to see that Zabini was in his compartment with Vincent and Greg. He usually chose to sit in a different compartment than Draco. He tried not to let it bother him, but he took one look at the seating arrangements, Zabini on one window seat with Greg sitting by the door on one side and Vincent by the door on the other, and decided he didn’t like it.
In order to implement his plan to undermine Weasley, he’d taught Pansy the song he’d made and had her teach the other Slytherins. He’d sent Blaise off with Vince and Greg to distract the Gryffindors. Blaise had learned a spell from Montague that grew someone’s hair uncontrollably.
downstairs. If you’re a couple then I’m a Gryffindor. You're more bent than I am. And Marco broke up with me as soon as we were caught.” Blaise looked uncomfortable. “He said he was just fooling around anyway.”
Draco swung his left arm around Pansy and made a flippant gesture with his right toward the crowd. “Does anyone have something of actual
Draco sneered at the thought.
The simmering anger under Draco’s skin, present since the beginning of the year, began to burn.
Draco could see Blaise squeeze Pansy’s hand and wished he could reach her other one. “What happened to your father, Pansy?”
When Draco looked at the seat across from him he found Zabini raising an eyebrow at him, Draco only shrugged one shoulder at him in response. It wasn’t Draco’s fault the obvious solution to worrying about a Gryffindor prefect attack was to have a prefect in each compartment. If Vincent had a problem with Draco’s ‘solution’ he would have said something.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Potter was surprised for a second before he realized what was happening and glared. “What the fuck Malfoy!?”
Potter’s head jerked up and he tried to keep his bleeding hand out of Draco’s reach, but Draco was much too determined and grabbed at it some more until he caught it. Potter sputtered. “What the hell Malfoy!? No, no I’m not hurt, give me my hand back! What are you doing here?!”
Luna frowned thoughtfully. “I believe one of his parents may be attached to a lidérc and he’s feeling the residual effects.”
But Luna came all the way in the door with no hesitation and stopped about half a meter away. They both looked at each other for a few seconds, before Luna cut the tension in a cheery voice. “Hi, Draco! I’m quite pleased to see you in person. Is it alright to hug you?”
When Draco chanced a glance up, he saw Pansy’s glare, her clenched jaw, her wet eyes. Blaise looked shocked, his own jaw halfway to the floor. He closed it and swallowed hard when he saw Draco looking at him.
He gave a sharp, tight lipped nod, and left the Great Hall at a brisk pace.
“ -- but you like the Weasleys, don’t you, Potter? Spend the holidays there and everything, don’t you? Can’t see how you stand the stink, but I suppose when you’ve been dragged up by Muggles even the Weasleys’ hovel smells okay --”
If Potter didn’t want him as a friend he’d get Draco as an enemy, and as Potter’s enemy, his only
When Blaise saw both girls, he narrowed his eyes. “Chang’s friend doesn’t look like she wants to be here.”
Draco supposed that Pansy and Blaise must have been getting close while he had been fuming. He felt bad for Blaise though, really. Wizarding society in general didn’t mind too much about homosexuality and its spectrum, but purebloods were expected to marry another pureblood of a different sex and produce at least one heir. Blaise was already on the outskirts of pureblood society with how his mother carried on her relationships, this wasn’t going to be easy for him.
Greg met Draco’s eyes again, now that his blush had faded. He smiled a crooked smile and shrugged with his whole body. “Don’t matter much now, does it? Have to pass our O.W.L.s alone. We get to drop anything we’re really bad at next year. And with the Dark Lord…”
Dumbledore’s final words rang in an echoing clang around Draco’s head even as Potter turned away. “Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”
Pansy hummed in thought. “That could work. It would explain why you went to Snape and not the hospital wing. The most likely culprit would be another Slytherin trying to get information, so it would have the added benefit of making everyone else suck up to you, trying to prove it couldn’t have been them.”
Recognizing Luna, Draco blew out a sigh and slowly lowered his hand. It was strange seeing Luna in person again. He’d only half looked at her in that first meeting in the first place, and had avoided her in public all year. It made Draco unusually nervous, afraid that maybe this girl wasn’t who he’d been talking to after all.
! She cares more about money than me! She just wants to sell me off to the highest bidder without caring how horrible they are because she got saddled with someone awful! I hate having him in my house, knowing what he did! His body is wasting away, he’s only alive because he’s hooked up to magical machines. When I first heard what he’d done I wanted to rip them out. I saw the crime pictures… The woman and her kid didn’t make it.”
Draco nodded his agreement when Blaise interjected,  “Sir, can I stay with him while he works on the letter?”
It would probably help, he thought, practically stabbing the air with his wand as he practiced some spell or other he could barely remember, if he could decide just who exactly he was mad at and concoct some way to fix it. He kept cycling through a range of targets. Harry bloody Potter featuring quite a bit.
“Saved Weasley’s neck, haven’t you?” Draco made sure he was looking straight at Potter. Goading him to look back. Daring him to retort.
Draco didn’t reply. He let the door slam after him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco hoped they didn’t. It might have been the smarter thing to do, but the idea of playing around with other people’s memories like that felt manipulative and invasive on a level Draco was uncomfortable with. It was one thing to Obliviate muggles for their own good, it was another thing entirely to modify a fellow witch’s memory. If they could do that to Edgecombe, who just wanted to leave the group, what would they be willing to do to Draco if they found out he knew? Nothing pleasant.
Again the girl did the opposite of what Draco was expecting. He’d spoken his thoughts without thinking about it, lured out by this girl’s impertinent nature, but she didn’t freeze up or freak out at the mention of Diggory, but was instead excited by the idea he’d posed.
Draco tried to block off the worry with his Occlumency walls, but he couldn’t focus hard enough; he wondered if it was because of the concussion.
She stopped and turned immediately.
Draco wasn’t sure if he was remembering it himself or if Severus was indeed rooting through his mind, but the image of Potter flung over Cedric’s body, screaming and crying, Potter’s blank eyes when Draco had run into him, his burning gaze from across the Great Hall, all flashed through his head before he threw up his Occlumency walls.
Umbridge opened her mouth and shrilled at him. “What do you think you’re doing? Barging in like this!”
Pansy and Blaise were silent the rest of the way to the boys’ dorms, the only word between them the password to the common room.
Luna turned and looked back at Draco. She seemed to think quite hard for a minute before smiling again. “They have to walk the path they’re on!”
Zabini took in Draco’s face and posture. He closed his eyes and sighed quietly. When he opened them again he dropped his arms. “I was afraid you’d say that. I imagine you would know.”
Pansy slammed her mug down with less drama and more exhausted anger. “We don’t
Draco glared back at him. His voice even sounded irate. “Because if this gets to light then she can be fired -- by Dumbledore, or the school governors, or hell, maybe the Ministry! I thought by telling you how much of a good thing that would be for the big picture you’d listen!”
He hated when Pansy was right.
Blaise glanced suspiciously around behind him at the mention of Potter’s group. The closest people to them were Vincent, Greg, and Milli sitting a few seats down from Pansy, but Draco had already cast a
Draco smirked. “You don’t like her either, do you?”
Draco tried to look abashed, but he was secretly pleased his apology had gone over well. He wasn’t used to giving them. When he was young, he used to reflexively apologize, constantly anxious he wasn’t living up to standard. When it became obvious that reprimands wouldn’t stop him, his father had started slapping his hand with the end of his cane everytime he did. After a year of that he was well clear of it. He’d rarely apologize since the age of eight.
It wasn’t until he was drifting off that the obvious came to him. It had to have been someone who told Umbridge. Someone not on the parchment.
He suddenly felt tears welling up. He wanted to hide behind his Occlumency walls, but he hadn’t been able to build them back up since his panic attack, his emotions too raw, his mind too tired.
Montague had tried to outright reject the idea, but he wasn’t a hard obstacle to overcome with Vincent and Greg behind him. Draco was glad he was the only one with any real objections though, with his fall out with Theo- Nott, so recent in everyone’s memory.
He was holding himself tightly and walking fast. Draco followed him at a distance. He’d never seen Potter look quite like that and he…. well, frankly, he wanted to see if Potter was okay.
Draco wasn’t sure he did understand.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco thought for a second and suddenly came to a realization. “Isn’t Smith related to the Smiths who claim to be descendants of Hufflepuff? Salazar help us, his family must be affected by
Between all these things going on though -- classes, homework, patrol, thestral study, writing Luna, quidditch practise, general keeping track of things -- Draco was hardly sleeping. He had taken to casting a mild glamour over his dark circles since Saturday morning, coming back from quidditch, when he had forgotten the glamour and Pansy had been appalled by them.
Your beloved,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With Pansy occupied following Edgecombe, Draco was able to focus on planning his Weasley revenge. Davies had come back with news that the Weasel was a nervous player to an almost unbelievable degree. Draco had never been so pleased.
And only hit warm skin with his fingertips.
Draco wanted to be sick. Pansy hadn’t gone into that much detail when she’d told him before. Most of Draco’s knowledge had been conjecture. Now he almost wished he didn’t know.
Draco had been preparing Weasley for humiliation by pretending to drop things in his presence every time Weasley was in viewing range. Draco could tell as soon as he and Potter came down to breakfast that all of Draco’s planning was already working, Weasley’s face was drawn and pale and he wasn’t stuffing his face like a pig.
He never saw Potter leave. Draco wondered if he really was invisible. He wouldn’t put it past him. He told himself he wasn’t disappointed.
Draco glared down at the table, having lost the fight as he blushed up his neck. “He said,‘Until I figure out what you’re up to, I’m not taking my eyes off you.’”
Instead he was forced to work on his studies for next year for several hours a day. as if the goal was for him to not need to go back next year. As much as he hated being cooped up inside, it gave him ample time to practice his Occlumency.
And Dumbledore had failed to keep her out of his precious school! He preached unity and safety, but invited discord and pain inside his walls. Dumbledore was supposed to be the best defense the light side had against the Dark Lord, and he couldn’t even hold off the Ministry?
Draco sneered. “What do I care who Blaise has been snogging? As long as it’s not me. At least he has his uses; what are you good for, Nott?”
Draco looked in Severus’s eyes, even knowing he might use Legilimency on him. He could feel himself trembling under Severus’s hand, and even though he hated himself for it he let his fear -- all the fear and confusion he’d felt since Potter had gotten out of the maze -- shine through to his expression. His voice even had a soft tremble in it when he spoke. “What if I’m not ready to make those choices?”
Draco was oddly touched. He knew if he were a better person he would pay more attention to his two lackeys, but besides being good listeners when he wanted to rant at someone, they didn’t have many useful or interesting qualities. It was hard to have a conversation with someone so far behind him. Still he softened his accusing tone. “You know you’re not great at studies. Without any help you might not pass.”
Greg grimaced in turn and seemed to look at least a little contrite. He grunted out a “Sorry”, looking ready to bolt.
Draco felt on top of the world with the wind rushing through his hair, Potter’s eyes on him, and the admiration of all his housemates.
He wanted to bite his tongue when Potter’s smile fell. “You mean she’s a Death Eater?”
Pansy backed up a step-and-a-half and glared at him. “Of course I care! I care about you, and you care about him!” Draco actually physically recoiled. Pansy seeing his look lifted her head enough to look down at him in an insulted manner. “Besides which, she is a horrible teacher. I haven’t learned a thing in her class about defense and it

doing hanging out with the likes of Zabini?”
Pansy crossed her arms and scowled. “Nothing. You’ll have to use your connection to her father and hope that’s enough.”
He gave another long groan just because he could. His head was throbbing and he could feel several other tender areas that were probably beginning to bruise. He had very delicate skin. He pinched the bridge of his nose. He resolutely did not want to think about what he’d just done.
Draco sneered, trying not to trip over himself. “Of course not! I don’t need Potter to think I’m

The common room around them was getting suspiciously quiet.
been spending a lot of time with Zabini, Zabini joining him at meals, in the corridors, and even joining him and Pansy to work on homework. “What’s it to you who I spend my time with?”
Draco grimaced and shushed Greg, his eyes darting around the Entrance Hall. They were far enough away from the doors to the Great Hall that none of the passing students seemed to have heard Greg. Draco hissed out between his teeth. “Not here, doofus.”
"Why, of course."
"Oh," Draco swam around Harry, "So they won't help you see this?" He wrapped his arms around Harry's shoulders and pulled him under.
Draco closed his eyes for a heart-stopping moment before taking a big breath in, “She.. is..one.. Harry.”
Harry chuckled, "And you would leave me to my devices? How, very rude, Draco Malfoy."
"You enjoy irritating your charges?" She asked concern lacing her voice.
He swallowed thickly. Thinking about everything that lead up to that moment was traumatizing, it took multiple sessions to even begin talking about it with his therapist. But sitting here with Potter made Draco want to spill all his guts out. The only explanation to why is that maybe he would understand what Draco had been going through. After the war, when interviews with the Chosen One began coming out, his mother would often sigh dramatically and tell Draco about how him and the boy seemed to be two sides of the same coin. Draco wasn't really sure what she meant, but he never dared to asked.
When Harry opened his eyes, Pansy was holding his face, "-rry. Potter? Harry, dammit!"
Harry threw his head back with a groan, "You are going to be the death of me."
Draco let out a laugh, leaning back slightly, "I'd like to see this boyfriend try."
"They were pretty fun sometimes, but most of the time they almost ended with all three of us dying. I think that's why he would give us points like that. Every year it seemed like something was trying to kill me or hurt me and we all were usually able to stop whatever it was, even though we were just children. It's crazy to look back now and think about everything we have been through together. How
never sleeps."
Malfoy smirked over at him, "Maybe if I did that than you would
The woman was silent for a long moment. "I will choose to believe, Potter, not because I actually do but because I have to for Draco's sake."
if you make the smallest mistake."
A hand pressed down on Harry’s shoulder, “I’ll get him some help Harry.”
Once they arrived to the hotel, the boys walked in silence all the way to Draco’s room.
They both smiled softly.
"Harry, why don't we go to my office and chat?" McGonagal spoke softly.
Draco slipped out of his sunflower yellow sweater, the cold mist of the forest nipping at his exposed arms. He grabbed a few of the dead rabbits by the ears, tying them to himself with a rope, and then grabbed a hold to the magically sturdy set of vines and began climbing.
Draco shrugged, taking a fry off of Harry's plate.
Rage-filled eyes turned to him, "Calm down? You want me to calm down? Our uncle may have just destroyed our lives. He gave that stupid boy the
She sighed with a chuckle.
After a few moments of a stare-off, the cat growled softly and turned away from Draco, climbing up into one of the tall trees.
The panther's right ear twitched at the words while the rest of him laid still watching Draco intensely with his dark green eyes.
about Draco ignoring him. Yeah, Draco has been the only person that has carried an actual conversation with him that wasn't to do with school or the war the past few weeks, and yeah he kinda sorta enjoys his company, but Harry's never felt as pent up as he does right now. Even when Ron or Hermione would ignore him, Harry would be upset and a little angry, but when Draco won't even
Fleur looked at Harry deeply before whispering, "You."
Finishing his song he waited for the applause to slow before speaking, "How are y'all doing tonight?" Another round of applause erupted with whistles and screams. Draco smiles broadly at the crowd in front of him. He pointedly looked towards the back as to not accidentally catch the eyes of a certain front row viewer. "As our lovely host said, my name is Draco Malfoy. And I am so excited to get a chance to play at this beautiful island." Another applause. "You know," he said slowly strumming his guitar, "I have traveled quite a bit since I started performing and I honestly don't think I have ever played in a place where everyone I met was just absolutely lovely." Small smiles spread across the crowd, along with a few claps. "Places like this are my favorite places to be. No matter where you are, who you are speaking to, it always seemed like you are in paradise." Strumming his guitar a little heavier he began to sing.
Draco smiled brightly, kissing him by the ear, "We will figure this out, I promise." He whispered before pulling away.
She took an even deeper breath in, leaning her back against her desk, knocking over one of the picture frames. She didn't notice.
Another silence fell on them.
Draco looked over as a familiar car pulled over to them, "Just curious."
Draco leaned back, sighing. Deciding to cut his losses, he slowly stood, collecting the food bowl and refilled the water dish, hoping that tomorrow he could begin working on breaking down a few of the cat's walls.
The man smirked, showing off teeth so straight and white a dentist would be jealous, "I just wanted to introduce myself, my name is Kyle Scott. I'm the drummer for tonight. I heard you play last night and I'm super excited to get to perform with you."
Harry laid down on his side, propped up on one arm. He looked at the boy beside him, wondering what he could be thinking about.
They stood in a building, only one street away from the boardwalk, that was decorated to the max with tropical styled items. Beautiful large, white lanterns were tied to the ceiling, looking as if they were floating, on the far right side were two bars both decorated with a variety of tropical plants and Hawaiian grass skirting, the bartenders that were setting up their bars were both shirtless, wearing only colorful leis and over sprouted green flower crowns. He couldn't see the bottom half of the bartenders but assumed they also were wearing grass skirts, like the wait staff was. Directly in front of them was an array of circular tables draped with white clothes, the chairs each had leis placed on the back of them for the guest to wear. There seemed to be a gap in the middle of the floor, right before the stage which Harry guessed was the dance floor.
Hampton shoved Harry off as the door opened, both standing quickly, eyes glued to the door.
They made their way to the elevators.
he thought.
Harry was holding Draco's arms tightly as he nodded against Draco's forehead.
There was a slight pause. Harry sat up straighter and Zabini moved back to give him space.
The rest of the set went just the same. Singing his heart out, looking over at the crowd constantly catching Harry's eyes, accidentally or on purpose he wasn't sure.
"Well, if you need someone to show you around or just have a good time with, you can always call me." He smirked at Draco as he walked away, purposely swaying his hips.
Harry slowly made his way towards his dorms, not in any hurry to be ignored by his roommate for the sixth day in a row.
, or the Pro-Igni for short. The word i believe means ‘firestorm’. Not really sure why it’s named after fire seeing as it’s green but I guess only the maker knows. It is said that this island was once created by way of fire and deep ocean colliding together. Legend has it that one day a great fire will once again rise and take Hunulaya. Only one of great power will be able to save the island."
Harry stroked his hand through Draco's hair, whispering comforting words into the boys shoulder. He held onto the back of his robes tightly as he waited for Pomfrey.
Harry jumped up and turned towards the voice.
A small smile fell upon the old man's lips, "No, sons, not exactly. You see, it is to see who is the strongest and who will be the sacrifice, but they aren't one person. You need two to complete the ritual, See, laced in the magic of the tree is a banshees song. A sacrifice, much like the one to take place tomorrow, was taken when the tree was placed here on the islands. The Source gave the tree to the people to protect but also serviced them with.. other gifts. But those gifts had to come with a price. In order to receive the gifts the people of the island had to sacrifice one of their own to the tree in order to receive them. The sacrifice they chose ended up being a banshee by the name of Pasiphae Riagáin's lover. They were secret lovers, as the man was to be wed soon. When they sacrificed him, Pasiphae went crazy and ran to the tree. The tree, to put it in simple terms, absorbed her. When she became one with the tree, her banshee magic intertwined with the magic placed their by the The Source.
Biting his lip, Harry nodded. "If that's- I mean, If that's alright, I would love to.. Yeah, I would love to."
The room was dark and quite, the only light coming from the vibrate moon outside the windows. He walked over to his dresser and pulled out a night shirt and pants. Half way through getting dressed he heard movement on the bed beside his. Quickly, he threw himself under his bed-sheets, dropping his shirt onto the floor.
are pissed, Potter."
Their eyes met again, Harry's throwing daggers while Hampton's filled with sorrow.
Draco lifted his head and looked towards the floor-to-ceiling windows. "I don't know.. I don't know if they did. Besides work I haven't been practicing too much on them. But.. I don't think it was just me that was doing the memories. I wasn't myself in the beginning; I was someone completely different. This might sound insane but I felt like who ever I was, they felt familiar. As did the voice that was speaking to me."
only to find that it was no wheres in the store. Seeing as it hasn't left that shop in the past few centuries and you are the only one who can get in and allow access to it, there was only one conclusion I could come to. What in hell possessed you to give the only protection against the tree, to the boy who has to finish the spell?!"
After walking her out, Harry decided to retire as well. After saying a quick goodnight, he showered and brushed his teeth. He realized after stepping out of the warm shower and into the cold tiled bathroom that he forgot to get clothes before his shower. He wrapped himself into a towel and peaked around the door. The hall looked empty, and his room was only a few feet away. He tightened the towel around his waist. Taking one last look down the hall, and tip-toed to eighth year room.
He often thought about what it would be like to see Malfoy again. He thought he would instantly want to punch the daylights out of him, to scold him for all that has happened and all that he had done. But that's when he thought of the snotty, hollowed out Malfoy. This Malfoy that he was put on an island with by fates design was so far from the Malfoy that Harry remembered. He didn't want to punch him, to hit him, to hurt him in anyway. The man was like a walking ray of sarcastic sunshine. Harry has only held one tiny conversation- if you can even call that a conversation, with him but just from the small interaction Harry could see, no
They sat in silence for a moment. Hermione turned to him, her eyes shinning with curiosity, "That little girl who was with Malfoy.. did she look familiar to you?"
"No one can help you but yourself, Malfoy."
The crowd cheered as a upbeat song began playing.
Harry instinctively stood in front of Draco.
"Yeah?"
Draco turned his head back towards where he remembering Léon to be, but he was no longer there.
The rest of the weekend went by too fast, in Harry's opinion. Waking up on Monday morning with knowledge that the first thing he is going to do is brew a potion and be force to listen to Slughorn's dull and boring lectures, makes Harry want to pretend he is dying just to stay in the warmth of his bed.
Draco backed away when Harry jumped towards him. He tensed as he realized he was trapped between the door and a very intoxicated Harry Potter.
"I thought Veela were just women? I read about them occasionally having men but it's extremely rare, isn't it?"
, Harry thought, sullenly
"Hey, love."
It seemed that every day he spends with the moody cat the stranger he becomes. Besides the vines incident and a few levitated items, the cat also never uses the powers that he possesses. When Draco would mention the powers to the cat, Léon would simply turn away from Draco and lay his head down. After the first few attempts of trying to coax the magic or the animal's thoughts out with
Harry looked up at Draco confused, “Splinching? I don’t feel any anti-apparition wards.”
Harry took a deep breath, "Look," he spoke quickly, "We are both here and this island isn't very big and there is like one bar to chose from and one hotel and like three things to do and only one beach, it's a big beach but still, and-"
Hampton smiles at him, grabbing his hand, "Got what under control, love?"
Harry snuck a glance towards Malfoy, who looked to be explaining something to the girl he walked in with, and quickly looked back towards Luna, "Not sure. I kind of want to work on my studies and relax for this last year."
"Next week is Hogsmead right?" Malfoy asked, randomly.
Draco jumped out of bed the second his alarm began ringing, scrabbled into fresh robes, quickly did his washing up, and flew towards his floo.
that was radiating off of him. "Your eyes are so much brighter without your glasses."
A moment came two days later where the boys found themselves in another exchange.
The room dropped to a deafening silence as Harry realized what he said. "I meant- Draco, can I- I mean, can I see him? Please?"
Harry Potter is not a drinker. Not in the slightest. Yet, the night before as he watched Draco many emotions he thought he had successfully suppressed began rising to the surface once again. So, in a panic, he drank. He drank
The first thing he noticed was how bright the cave seemed compared to the forest outside. Where the light was coming from, Draco had no clue. There was no lanterns, no fires, no candles. Even the blue light was no longer trailing the panther. Yet, the rocky cave walls were glowing with a soft yellow and orange. Draco walked around the small circular room before noticing a set of naturally made stone steps going down next to where the large cat was sat watching Draco.
As Harry got closer, Draco felt like trying to slow it down was useless.
The orb wasn't an orb at all. It was the large head of a panther, the same panther that nearly almost just killed Draco. Draco was about to stand up in rage - or at least try to stand; but froze when he saw the deep sorrow and regret shinning through the panther's deep green eyes. Draco realized at that moment how much lighter and brighter the cat's eyes had gotten since his first arrival. The deep hunter green had brighten up to a soft jade color over the past few weeks. But now, they were nearly as dark as they were when Draco met him that first night.
The hall Harry had found a home and family in all those years ago still had the brightness and still held the giggles and amazed looks of the younger generations, but there were many things that made the bright, optimistic room darken as if a shadow stood right before the candle lights. The floor, for instance. Looking around, many students see the long tables made up for each house spread across a clean tiled floor, Harry however sees the ghost of the bodies that laid wrapped in cloth on a dirt-and-blood-ridden flooring as their families searched for them, most shattering to the floor when they were found.
There was still a slight warmth radiating from Draco's body, but all Harry could feel was the cold, deep emptiness that was swallowing his own. How could he let this happen? Why didn't he
"Wow, you must be really flexible. It seems like you are always doing that."
I can’t make promises for when the next update will be but I have already started on it and have a layout for how I want the story to unfold. So if you can stay with me and be patient it will all work itself out!
"Love, I know you are worried-"
A sly look slowly grew on Harry's face, "You were always so easy to rile up. Glad to see that hasn't changed."
“This is truly a beautiful ballroom, Mr. Potter,” said his mother. “It will work wonderfully for your charity event.”
Mrs. Malfoy now lived in a townhome at the far end of Horizont Alley. It was much smaller than the manor, but it would be more than comfortable for most wizarding families in London. Though the Ministry took their family estate after the trials, the Malfoys had managed to keep their Gringotts vault intact. Draco attributed this to goblin reluctance in allowing the Ministry to meddle in their business affairs as opposed to kindness bestowed by the Wizengamot.
Uncle Severus sighed. “Be that as it may, you are in no fit state for classes today. Stay here while you decode your mother’s letter. Merlin knows that’s the first thing you’re going to run off and do anyway, and I would rather you be here in case you need more calming draught. Then I’m sending you straight to the dormitory. I’ll speak to your other teachers at dinner. You’ve clearly been under too much stress. I know it’s O.W.L. year for you, but it is only October.”
If Draco could have spoken to Mrs. Parkinson he would have told her not to worry, that worrying would only make things worse. Pansy was no fool. And also a bit of a coward. She knew what she would need to do and was fully prepared for it. She just liked taking all the advantage she could get away with before settling. She was the last type who would run off with a muggle or what-have-you. She’d told Draco she just wanted a good fortune with an absolutely ridiculous manor so she would only have to tolerate her husband so much.
Draco saw the shock at the words coming out of Draco’s mouth slowly come over Potter’s face the longer he went on. Maybe he could hear the edge of desperation creeping up Draco’s throat. But he also saw when he went too far, Potter’s anger replaced his shock. Draco was far too late to stop himself now though and the next thing he knew was darkness.
