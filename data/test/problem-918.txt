- You’re all so really annoying.
The Gryffindor's table is almost empty. Few students are sitting down in front of their plates, a lot of them consequently missing the sausages and scrambled eggs. Draco pulls out his pocket watch. Oh right, it’s only 9am. Potter is still asleep. Blaise sits down next to him, also shoving him because Blaise can’t do otherwise.
- Oh, there you are, she says, looking barely annoyed, I didn’t see you. What are you doing ? How come you’re not in the corridors stalking Potter ?
- No.
So why does he feel the need to see Potter at least once a day, or else he gets worried ? Potter’s not the one who’s supposed to “unblock” something for him ?
- Oh, I know ! It’s Potter huh ? You’re hiding so you watch out for him ? Seriously ?
- No, I’m hiding away … Oh and give me a break. You don’t hear me fucking bothering with your “rubber” duck.
Waking up is painful. Blaise shake him so violently he almost falls off his bed. He puts on his robe, ignoring the sound of his roommates laughing at him. He doesn’t have the strength to rebuff them, so he just grabs his vanity and goes brush his teeth.
He looks up, and notices, on the other side of the big table, near the central alley, a tuft of dark tousled hair and horribly familiar. His head is laying down on his scrolls, his quill is emptying its ink on the table’s wood. He fell asleep. Draco can’t see his face but he’s sure he looks like … No, he forces himself to stop looking. No, he’s there to work. He must not watch
- Goyle ran after crybaby Colin in the hallways for like ten minutes. We even took bets, and you, you only deemed it enough of your attention when Potter showed up.
- I SAID ENOUGH.
- If you say so.
Draco is at the center of all attentions, Potter’s included. He feels the two green eyes staring at him. He knows that if he turns his head, he’ll see a flabbergasted Potter. He doesn’t want … He feels his heart explode in his chest. He starts to run. He wants one thing and one thing only : to die under his blanket.
- Oh come on, don’t sulk. It’s fun.”
-Pff.
- Nonsense.
- I AM. NOT. STALKING. POTTER.
Potter, the Boy Who Lived, of all people … In his father’s mouth, it sounds like an insult, a despicable act, an unnatural mistake. To the Malfoy family, he’s not worth much than the mud under his shoes. Which is why it’s only logical Draco finds many ways to insult him.
The library is quiet. Almost everyone is gone. Even Granger went back to sleep. Draco struggles to remain awake, so he can finish this damn parchment for the olde McGonagall. Once again, she requested her thirty centimeters for the next class. He can’t anymore. He’s currently wondering if he won’t actually fuck it. He’s so tired he actually thinks it’s a decent idea.
Then, it looks like Potter is avoiding him. Draco can’t even trust his mental copy of Potter’s schedule. He doesn’t see him at breaksfast. He doesn’t see him pass in front of him to go to History of Magic. They don’t bump into each other after the Quidditch’s practises.
Draco gives her an evil glare. “Fuck you.”
“ What are you doing here ? Hiding from McGonagall ?
- Not particularly Blaise. Just …. Everyone. Not sure if you noticed but you look at him quite often.
You made me feel whole. So broken I was, scarred and marked, unknowing of what normality meant - unprepared for a post-war existence. It was you who brought meaning back into my life, taught me how to breathe when the crowds jostled closer, pulled me back from the oblivion I so perilously craved. You, who sat beside me, night, after night; your fingers in my hair the only thing keeping me sane.
All too soon Harry arrives outside his own door. He lays his forehead lightly to the tarnished nameplate as he does every morning before sleep, letting the dull metal press into his skin for a moment then pushing his way into what was once Sirius’ room. With mechanical movements, he strips the wet clothes from his body and climbs into bed.
“I. I...” He hadn't meant to say that. But that didn't make it any less real.
; to be used.
But it's not.
“Draco” Harry sighs in way of greeting, relief evident in his voice. To say he hadn’t been worried would be to lie. Multiple times he’d convinced himself Draco had been nothing more than a dream. Or, worse, a once-off. Unwilling to meet again. He turns to the man who occupies his every waking moment, and intrudes upon his slumber. Draco’s face is the colour of bone, cast in shadow and unreadable, gaze averted to an invisible horizon.
You hold him like that, his gaze locked to yours, unrelenting, primal, base, even as you continue to fuck him in a way you’re sure will leave bruises on him and yourself unable to walk. Hold him like that, even as you struggle to hold
Potter suddenly exploded. “I can't believe I let that happen!”
Once again, the sky is lightning, another night ceding to day’s incessant siege. Draco stands, brushing snow from his robes. Too soon for Harry; too late for Draco, who is glancing at the receding dark with his brows drawn.  “It’s time for me to go,” he says. “It’s probably already been noticed.”
It couldn't be. Of course it was. "I could ask you the same thing, Potter."
Harry’s not; it hurts to think back to a time when he was. The last time. The Forest of Dean, perhaps, the Golden Trio against the world. Fatigued bodies, weary minds, perpetual fear - of failure, of what was behind them. What was coming for them. Of
Does he, like Harry, have time to lose? To burn, to will away, mechanically performing the dance yet forever anticipating the denouement?
When he was twenty two, he learnt how to live.
What follows could only be described as a lesson in endurance as he proceeds to kiss every inch of your body, lips ghosting over tacky flesh, tracing the planes of your hips and back with his tongue - an amazing, abhorrent tease. You writhe; clenched hands and goose bumped skin, and it’s wrong, so wrong, that he can do this to you. Make your body react with just a brush of lips, make your head tilt back and make you scream, make your toes curl. Make your body a prisoner to his persuasive assailment. Make you want to beg.
Draco flinched, looking away. Looking away, because he couldn't possibly look harry in the eye, couldn't stand to see what was burning behind the green.
I came home today. St Mungo's kept me in longer than necessary, and after, Hermione insisted I stay with them for a few weeks. You know how she gets; easier to say yes. Rose asked for you, something about the two of you being halfway through a book? Even if you’re angry at me, you should go read to her.
You let the mask fall.
in your arse. Close,
Harry turns away, looking out across the gloom of slumbering London to mask the smile he can feel pulling at his mouth. A foreign feeling, one he knows Draco isn't ready to see yet.  He’s acutely aware of Draco beside him, wants to turn to him. Look at him. Hold his gaze and bury his face into Draco’s neck for no other reason than to feel another’s skin against his.  Instead, he exhales loudly through his nose, head tilting up when a drop of rain breaks across his forehead.
Harry shuffled awkwardly, his feet sweeping dust arches back and forth across the marred floor. “What happened to your wand?” he asked eventually.
scratched chicken-hand into the porcelain under the sink. Found one day in a fit of cleaning, and pondered for many more, he still doesn't know exactly who they stand for. Who made them. Why they’d hide it. Menace whispers in the confines of this room, a nefarious ooze of
Potter shook his head. “I’m not having this conversation with you again. Don’t paint me as a fallen angel.” He studied Draco in the intense way he was slowly getting used to. “I think we should find out if your mother is okay.”
He is still citrus, but now this too; saliva pooling in the creases between gum and
His voice broke. “And then, to feel so desperate, so alone, so sickened by your own mutilated arm, which, despite their best efforts, still bears the mark, that you douse it with gas and light it on fire. You embrace the pain, the sweet stink of burning, because it means that it's
The leather connects lower, one studded-end a hippogriff's hair away from the fragile swell of Harry's balls. He convulses, hands gripping white-knuckled to the wall. Illegible words ring out alongside the crack of a whip, and it takes him far too long to register the garbled cries as his own. Beyond pain, beyond arousal; all Harry knows is he needs something else. He moves his legs wider, bends lower, exposes more.
This time, at least.
Magnus waves the question away with a flamboyant twist of his hand. "It's tradition, darling." Now he thinks about it, the napkin rings do sound familiar re. courting etiquette, although they may be more symbolic of
I’m in our bed. On our sheets, safe in our home we built together. If I close my eyes, I can convince myself you’re beside me.
Harry's face does that odd look again. Magnus would suggest he kick the habit, but he's attempting to be nice. Er. "Oh god. Do you mean peacocking? I'm not peacocking, Magnus."
Of course they do. You're you, and he's him, and it's no secret, the past you share. They believe the tales told of your youth, the half-truths and the rumours, the stories that are spread. Like sheep they accept fiction as fact, dutifully following the examples of others, never bothering to question. You're the wolf, and they run scared.
This new before and after grows with every tick of your parent’s clock on our wall, and all I can think about is my response to your promised forever. I meant what I said: I'd follow you anywhere; life, after life, after life.
"Fuck, Potter. Are you drunk?" Draco asked, smelling for the first time the stench of alcohol beneath the general stink of filth.
. Instead, he methodically makes his way through the house, room to room:
It slips through your mind as his hands land on your body again and his mouth seeks yours, that you're awfully willing to condemn yourself forever in exchange for one night of him being
His cock is hardening, arousal stirring heady in the base of his spine. The wall is cool under his touch, polished stone or worn wood panelling. He rests his cheek against the surface. Stifles a moan as his dick grazes it.
Harry didn't need to see the pain.
Before, you would have taken that. Tonight, you’re aiming for more.
"No one sent me." The voice was low and raw, lacking of any emotion.
Then the Dark Lord had come, marking the start point of Draco's fall.
“What is this?” He asks once Harry has finished, holding his palm rigid to inspect it. Blue ink mars ashy white, hypnotic in its illicitness; heady in its taboo.
. It’s the only word to describe the situation, because somehow in the space of your rigid formalities people have edged closer. Some pretend attention elsewhere yet the majority are bluntly staring, expressions from rage to perplexity evident on their faces. For a moment, you worry about mob mentality. All it would take is an insult issued from the orange lackey and you would be doomed.
Once his eyes have been rubbed and skin pinched, he tells himself it’s another. Not
pseudo-Draco's hands on him, have the steel links of whatever's clinking draped across his body, revel and bow under the weight of restraint whilst the blunt end of a cane carves rivers of blood across his back.

It ends with darkness.
Retains consciousness long enough to utter Draco's in return.
"Who sent you?" Draco asked. He didn't know how he had been found, or by which gang, but he had been unable to pay their territory costs, so now he would pay with his life. He found that he couldn't bring himself to care much.
It'd be around now one would usually start hearing the encouraging sounds of a glass being deposited (hopefully) in the sink or (more likely) on the coffee table, along with the thud of feet planting themselves to the floor in preparation of an upcoming exit. He chances a quick glance in Harry's direction, hoping the lack of noise suggests a drunken inability to hoist himself from the couch and not a deliberate lack of effort in vacating said couch. The boy's chewing his lip and clutching his tumbler a little tighter than Magnus would like, considering its crystal, but he's not drooling. Evidently it's the latter.
Blaise Zabini is sat alone, rear to the ground and back against the wall, legs stretched straight before him. His fly is tented, bottom lip caught between perfect, white teeth. Gaze hooded, he answers your attention with a slight shudder, pushing the heel of his hand firmly to his crotch.
"You're telling me, Magnus," Harry says slowly, finding his voice. "That to land Draco, I need to wear a ridiculous hat?" His tone is low, somewhat strangled. Breathy.
Lying here, in your bed, the place that you have been, it's a fitting end to our tumultuous tryst.
. Fuck you. Did you know he was here?" It's quite attractive if you like them fiery, which Magnus does.
It's a command. Harry complies, dropping his t-shirt to the floor in a heap.
"Does it matter why?" Potter asked, turning to stare at him with eyes that were still impossibly green.
"Whore. Slut. Cunt. Filth. Dirt. Useless pig" The words were thrown at him as relentlessly as the beatings, but all they did was mimic his own internal monologue. The man wasn't shouting anything that Draco hadn't realised when he was first thrown to the streets five years ago and resorted to pleasuring strangers just to stay alive. His own self image was defined by much darker things then the idiot hunched over his battered body could ever say.
“Draco, please. I don’t know what to do for you.”
"Right," he says, sitting up straighter and startling Chairman Meow. "Now the proverbial cats out the bag, with your
When he was ten he knew discipline. How to stand, how to sit. How to mask his face so as to not betray the pain. Duties and expectations, the threatened consequences of failed perfection. The mind could not be a slave to the body as much as the body could not rule the mind. A cool facade to be worn; the master of control.
being more of the
The wall is subtly textured, slightly roughened. Harry finds the brackets, curls his hands around the grooved bars. Lets his head dip forward. Inhales. Exhales. Tries not to tense. Fails.
"Yeah. He's ready." Affirmation, when you eventually draw yourself back from him, to the shadowed faces that line the room, although the words are more for Harry than them. Warning. Promise. Your voice is raw and husky, a decibel lower than usual, desire and need and urgency, all unmistakable in your tone. You don't bother to conceal it. Not when he's like this. Utterly wanton - hands and knees red and bruising to the floor, body near quivering from the attack your mouth and fingers have ravaged. Blind they are, sheep. Harry is the only one you've ever seen.
Grazes the sharp edge of his nail across the puffy stretch of swollen hole, forces the tip of his finger into wet tightness, scratches the abused flesh with a vulgar twist of his wrist.
“Let me help you. Please. Let me take the pain away.”
+++++++++++
Yet the illusion holds. The figure walks closer, platinum hair a halo against the obsidian sky. Their face is cast to the ground, stride heavy and forlorn, betraying none of the grace Harry knows it can hold. Feels, on some primal, base level. He’s almost certain it’s Draco. The rival from school. The shadow on the street. The flicker that haunts his nights.
“Never mind. Give me your hand.” Draco’s trepid gaze moves from the biro to Harry, although the rest of his body shows no inclination toward movement. With a sigh, Harry takes Draco’s hand himself, suppressing a shudder at the contact. Insted, he turns it palm-up, stepping closer. “Hold it there,” he instructs, before pressing the pen to Draco’s skin. Draco flinches, but allows Harry to continue.
Harry.
Hot. Burning hot,
, when all he
“My wand?” asked Draco, confused.
Harry braces, internally if not externally.
As soon as they appeared, Draco was gone, pulling out of Potter's embrace to heave stringy bile over stone floor, his stomach not full enough to provide a full vomit. It had been years since he had felt the embrace of another's magic wrap around him. It was strangely intimate. "I haven't been apparated in ages" he muttered, wiping the back of his mouth with his jersey. Straightening, Draco looked around the shabby room which he assumed was Potter's kitchen. Grime marred the cabinets and floor, the counter tops a mess of empty spirit bottles. A chair was leaning broken beside a fist size hole in the wall and what appeared to have once been a beautiful antique wooden mirror now knelt smashed, its jagged edges spread below it like the shed plumage of a once-regal bird. The solid oak kitchen island stood in the middle of the room, with what Draco horrifically realised was dried blood sprayed wildly across the surface. It would have looked more at home in an abattoir.
want it. To see him come undone, and know it was your hands alone that pushed him over the edge. Know, and revel in the evidence, that you have the same effect on him that he does towards you. Yet your body doesn't want to cooperate, and when he places an achingly tender kiss on your ankle – such a contrast to the desperation that had flowed not minutes ago - you let yourself give in.
"It's futile, Magnus. He's uncrackable. He's unwooable. He's unimpressible." Cue dramatic sigh. "He's impossible."
For a moment, Harry toys with the possibility of rebelling against the unknown sender by opening the letter marked 'II' first thereby making a small yet strong statement about undesired mail from undisclosed sources. Alas, propriety wins in the end, and he reluctantly trades the second letter for the first, succumbing to the enigmatic yet compelling peer-pressure mystically exuded from most ascending sequences, and submits to their unwavering demand for compliance. Furthermore, he doesn't know for sure the letters are, in fact, undesirable, reasoning he can always incendio the buggers if they do prove to be so and clear his kitchen of illegitimate fowl via a soft stinging hex.
Guys! I'm back! I am so so so sorry for how long this has taken. The chapter took me a few weeks to write, and then my editor/love of my life decided to live her own life for four weeks.
“Malfoy. Draco,” he replies with a smirk, but there’s no malice in his tone, and your name on his lips sends a spark of hunger down your spine.
Until they weren't, and the gap was closed.
It surprises you, the grace with which he moves, so different from the boy you grew up antagonising. He's a man now. Solid. Strong. With shoulders you want to grip, hips you want to straddle, thighs you want to feel flexing and straining against your own. You know it's futile, this illicit daydreaming. Still. Perhaps it’s only the liquor talking, but you’re filled with a heady, absolute conviction that he's as aware of you, as you are of him.
Every touch is Harry's, you come.
“Of what?” Draco asked, confused.
, much longer. Still. You force your gaze to settle on the tense crowd, ensuring their enthrallment. Meeting each set of eyes in turn and unable to suppress a shiver at what stares back:
Harry shudders. He loves this,
, gracing Harry with a small nod that doesn't entirely hide the way his eyes sweep over Harry's body. "Your room for the evening, Sir," he murmurs with a coy caress of his thumb over the wood framing before grasping the handle and pushing the door open, stepping back a fraction to let Harry enter.
tease that has your toes curling and body trembling.
How did he move on; how does he function day to day? Because Harry can’t fathom how to do so - is clutching at straws - yet he cannot disperse the lingering notion they’re unintentional parallels. Two sides of the same coin. Surely, if Draco can live with the aftermath of war, Harry should be able to, as well.
He doesn't move.
It’s him who severs the silence. Him, who pushes away from the brick and takes two steps forward, close enough so that his smell envelops you, woody and smoky and
"I didn't know anyone could fall as low as me, and I've been falling for a long time. What happened that pushed you over the edge, Malfoy?"
Should you be concerned? Probably. Yet you've never had much restraint when it comes to him.
I'm going now. All I wanted in the end was you.
“What's done is done. I can't change the past; I haven't got a time-turner. And anyway, most would say I deserved it, what I got. They certainly did.”
all sweat and cum and tensed muscles, the black hair and the green eyes which have now fallen shut, the bob of his cock that is only starting to soften; the knowledge that, evidently, fantasies can come true. It’s everything at once, the perfect moment that has you wishing to stay suspended in this breath of time, yet your body is a traitor to your own desires, and you can’t do anything but cry out as your orgasm crashes over you.
An impossible task was set. The agonising war within him to do what was expected of him, or to do what he had long suspected now was right. Frustration, fear, the slow disintegration of faith. Anxiety and anguish. The scars of Sectumsempra long lost among countless others that marred his thin body. However, the memory would always remain: total desolation and the fleeting hope that it would finally be over.
It’s your name sighed on a whimper that does it. Not your last but your first, murmured into the silence
It seems fitting to spend my final time in the space that you had hesitantly claimed as your own. I would have given you the world, moved stars,
They're riding low on his hips, button undone, waistband tucked under the curve of his sac. Harry pushes them down, stepping out of the legs awkwardly; all the elegance and sex-appeal of a newborn fawn.
Left with questions, knowing there will be no answers, Harry walks.
You've been watching him.
Is Draco a participant in the life around him, or merely spectating? Would he be missed is he was to simply disappear, or would people panic? Search for him? Mourn?
Harry’s favourite bathroom. The one with the tub big enough for five. It never fails to remind him of his day spent in the prefect's bath, surrounded by bubbles and an alarmingly lustful Moaning Myrtle. When the chains of this life promise eternity, when time’s hands advance with a sluggish intensity and intent, he likes to pretend he’s back there. At Hogwarts; in the bath. Body burning with desire, and purpose, and focus. With
Harry blinks. “Every night since you were last here.” He thought that’d been clear.
All Harry wants to do is ask him, how?
the man who has been the antagonist in your horror story life.
Harry swallows, attention still fixed on the muggle lines tarnishing pureblood skin.“My address.” Draco’s eyes flick from his hand to stare at Harry. “If you ever need somewhere to go. Anytime.” Harry pauses, feeling uncomfortable; thankful when Draco drops his gaze to his palm again. “The pen will fade soon.”
The smell of magic, near electric, burning acrid through his sinus' in this new heightened state of awareness. The room itself, the hint of dust and residue of cleaning charms, an underlying caress of floral and clean linens. The promise of
A tear escaped, breaching the rim of his eye before slowly tracking down his pale cheek.
You succeed, but it’s a close thing.
Soft touch to your thighs, hips, stomach. It's all wrong -
Draco freezes as Harry’s fingers contact pallid skin. His flesh is soft under Harry’s touch, pulled taut over cheek and jaw bones, barely a whisper of stubble to be felt. He moves to see Draco’s entire face, jaw still caught. Purples, yellows, greens emerge as Harry slowly unveils his features, sharp contours only succeeding in highlighting trauma which travels from eye to throat. Rage rushes through Harry, catching him by surprise. How long has it been since he’s felt this? Cared enough about anything, or anyone, to trigger more than his usual idle disinterest? The fury burns intoxicatingly sweet in his veins, and even as he chokes “the fuck, Draco,” past gritted teeth, one part of him is revelling in the onslaught of emotion stirring his anesthetised limbs.
"And then you wouldn't back away, mate. Not even when Snape was right there."
"What's up, Potter?" he asked sarcastically, putting on his mask of indifference. Which did not cover how terrible he looked, but it powered his stance. "You know that there is no need to stand up when I enter a room? I appreciate the deference, but you can sit down again."
"What do you mean you don't care about Quidditch right now?"
"Why are you here?" asked Potter, and his tone was serious, matching his concerned look.
"It's not funny, Ron," reprimanded Hermione. "Snape took away twenty more points from Gryffindor. We will lose the Cup at this rate. And that's going to rest in your shoulders alone, Harry."
"Don't overthink it, okay?" murmured Ron, pulling her into a complete hug. "We will talk to him tomorrow."
"No, Professor," said Potter, without missing a beat.
, only wash your face after sweating, but us,
Harry snorted and scowled at him at the same time. Malfoy could not just joke himself out of being hateful.
"I! Don't! Know!" he burst. "I have no clue what the fuck happened or why! Now leave me alone!"
"I have most certainly not, sweetie," Draco replied, exaggerating his poshest accent. "My time is yours and only yours to have."
"Shut up, Ronald. Harry? Do you know how to distract Malfoy?"
"It's okay, Malfoy. I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. It's going to be okay, I swear," he mumbled, not knowing what else to do. It wasn't true. It wasn't going to be okay. Malfoy was probably fighting for Voldemort. How would that ever be okay? But Malfoy was not even listening, too wrapped up in his own mind.
"Right. Well, then this is the perfect chance to move on. You don't need the mess that Potter is in your life and it appears that you've already messed with his, so he'll be distracted for a while. That's what you wanted, isn't it?"
Inside his bed, Draco was fuming. What the

how Potter tried to make him stand up, and how he eventually got him in a vertical position, and how he finally carried him and dropped him in the bed. Although maybe
"It's not me that needs convincing, my dear boy," Dumbledore smiled. "However, you must understand that situations are quite powerful in the pressure they put on people that are not necessarily evil. One cannot understand a person without first considering their context. That is, after all, what we are doing by looking into Tom's past. We cannot face him without first understanding the kind of person he is. It would be reckless to just react to the surface of things."
Second, I didn't want to post a new chapter without acknowledging what's going on in the world. I am a white woman that lives in Europe, and I understand that that is a huge privilege. Although this is not a huge community, I wanted to point out that systematic and institutionalised racism is a thing that happens across the world, not only in the US. Europe has been built upon imperialism, colonialism, and slavery, and the consequence of that is a current eurocentrist system that lets African or Middle East refugees die in the Mediterranean, whose justice and law enforcement institutions discriminate against non-whites (ACAB), a system in which non-whites are segregated, have less opportunities, are poorer.
Hermione didn't actually know that they had

"I'm not gay!" he replied as if in an automatic mode. "But that's not my problem.
"That people have died because of me," said Harry coldly.
"He just dreams a lot, you know?" continued Malfoy, glaring at Harry so that he would shut up. "And he shouts things that I cannot even understand. When I said that it is a living hell to share a room with him, I meant it. It is also impossible to wake him up when he is having nightmares."

(See the end of the chapter for
"You do? Please, enlighten me," said Pansy with a mocking smile.
The way he pronounced
But Harry could not listen. He was trying to unravel Malfoy's expression, to see beyond the hate, and he was trying to convince himself that it was real, that Malfoy truly detested him and that it wasn't a mask. But he simply could not. He could not buy that Malfoy loathed him, he could not buy the whole act they had just pulled in front of everybody. It all seemed dishonest and empty compared to the heat and the kisses of the past days. And yet it had been him, Harry, the one to start the fight, and he could not understand why on Earth he'd done it, not when, for once, the Slytherin idiot did not deserve it.
"That's not true! I didn't do that!"
The door of the room closed and the Gryffindors went away.
"Harry!"
The beautiful and chaotic history of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, all in one room.
"It's that or my glamorous company. Tough decision."
"Potter, move," ordered Snape.
"And what would Malfoy and Harry
. Those green eyes that were transparent to what Potter felt, and that now needed him to lie. To swear on a lie. And Draco panicked. He could not give him that. He could not lie to Harry Potter. He also could not turn away. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to go. Just those emerald eyes that didn't judge him. That were patiently and hopefully waiting for him to deny something he could not deny. He could not move. He could not hide. He could not push him away. He could not lie. There was just one thing he could do. The one thing that they had been avoiding for too long.
He just needed a bit of luck. He needed the world to work with him for once. He finalised the details of his plan: it would take place in Hogsmeade and he would need some help from Crabbe and Goyle.
And Potter seemed to get encouraged by the sounds, because he kissed harder, he rubbed harder against him. And Draco shouted something that sounded awfully like "POtter". And he didn't think when he put his hands inside Potter's pants. But touching his ass directly had to be too much for Potter. And, apparently, for Potter too much was not good. Because he abruptly backed away. And Draco will deny that he groaned disappointingly, but he did.
"Come on, Potter, you can't even say it. What are you? Eight?"
"Wait, are you serious? What do you mean maybe?"
"The plan is to be there, ready to act. To be on the watch in case we are needed. I don't know what we might or might not need to do, but this is going to get even messier in one way or another, and I normally prefer to have better control of the situations that may cause me or people close to me pain. And I will obviously feel more prepared if we can synchronise when the moment comes."
"Come on! It's weird!"
"Do you? Yes or no?" asked Hermione sharply.
"It's okay, Potter. You can leave if you are too scared."
"Shut up, will you? We both know it happened, so save the drama. How far have you gone?"
"So tell me," said Harry seriously, controlling the volume of his voice. "Tell me and I will know. Give me something."
"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING, YOU EGOISTIC PIG?!" shouted Malfoy, unavoidably losing it at last.
It was dark already, and they were not supposed to be freely walking around Hogwarts, so every sound was amplified in Draco's head. Everything from his chattering teeth to their hurried steps across the hallways echoed in Draco's skull. He must've been going insane because the sounds kept getting louder and louder, startling his already too sensitive body every time. When they were almost in their room, he kept jolting closer to Potter's body as a reflex response to every particularly strong sound.
Potter's breath stabilised and his green eyes seemed to focus.
Draco still felt weak and sick, and he was hungry, but his stomach complained every time he ate something, and his head felt dizzy, and he was not able to concentrate, not in the classes, not in the Room of Requirements, not even on how pathetic his life was. No, his thoughts kept wandering back to stupid Potter. He was convinced that the level of obsession had never been that exaggerated. Because that's how big of a pathetic fool he was: it was only now that he was supposed to truly ignore Potter, now that his life
"Yeah, I don't know. I'm a bit tired."
And they were just words. Not even complicated words. Just the kind of simple sentences that a simple mind could build. But they all arrived to Draco's lower stomach and punched him, causing him to forget about breathing for a couple of seconds. Potter was not just speaking, he was provoking him.
Then, Potter opened his curtains, and Draco was sure he was going to say something, or do something. But no, that was it. Potter opened the curtains and stayed in bed, his breaths more audible now. And Draco knew that the obvious thing to do was to leave him be, to ignore him and his chaotic behaviour. But unfortunately, Draco was not able to coordinate his rational brain with his arm movements, so he also opened his curtains, because he was only human, and mimicry was a basic social skill.
He needed to know the truth.
"Language, Potter!" shouted McGonagall, but no one listened. The boys were yelling all that they had not yelled in three weeks, out of control.
Sight returned, eyes burning from dimmed light that near burns, his body spun and stretched taut under his companions strength, yet all Harry can do is look.
Harry jolts, or thinks he does; there's the sound of scrambled purchase against wooden floors. He doesn't have time to acclimatise to the sudden onset of sound, however, before another crack of leather slices past his other ear, close enough this time he can smell the worn musk it leaves in its wake. Harry gulps in a breath, his inhale sharp in the otherwise quiet of the room; hears the jagged pant of his breathing, the slight rasp at the end. How long has he been like this, vocal for his companion yet deaf upon his own ears? What else has his body betrayed whilst locked in a cage of nothing? The thought warms his cheeks. He can only guess how he appears to faux-Draco, gasping and moaning and whimpering and fuck knows what else from the smallest of olive-branches the man proffers. Harry hasn't even been touched, yet he's already at the point of begging. For what, he's not sure.
Harry doesn’t beg him to stay, scarcely resists the compulsion to. “What has?” he asks instead.
The smattering turns heavier, from nips to teeth-edged bites. More precise as to where it lands, the added force sharpening the accuracy of each weighted tail. They build upon themselves, turning blushing blooms to livid ridges, livid ridges to swollen, magenta welts with each addition. Harry's weight is on his hands, mouth open and head drooping, nerves alight as instinct attempts to predict where the next blow will fall.
He answers with a coy grin. A batting of lashes, come-hither eyes, and suddenly you wonder how many others he's been with, for he’s clearly no unskilled innocent. How many others he’s worshipped with his tongue; the people he’s fucked and taken and screwed and
One. Two, three.
"Turn around."
This time the silence, when it inevitably follows, lasts a millennium. Magnus takes the opportunity to refill his whisky.
You clutch the firewhiskey tighter in your hand, the condensation that rolls down the tumbler and over your pale fingers the one saving distraction in this room. This room, which is too bright, too loud. Too full. Of
Heat laces through you as your lips finally,
It’s hard to say goodbye. Even harder when there are no promises it won’t be the last one. Draco’s existence in Harry’s life feels as insubstantial as a phantasm; just as likely to disappear. Harry’s beautiful illusion, too good to be true - he is well versed in the nature of his own endings. He needs something from Draco; a string to hold. “Meet me here tomorrow.”
Discreetly, yet enough that you're sure he's noticed. Enough that you're convinced the straightening of his spine, the purposeful way he moves around the room, is for you.
ways as possible. Hell, you'd take missionary on the floor if it meant the superb cock that was currently jutting from between two muscular thighs looking all delectable and edible and
“Look at what that survival cost you. And I don't mean the whoring. You lost your wand, your life. Everything that you had even known has been stripped from you. Yet you're standing here telling me that I didn't do wrong?”
"This is where I live, Potter." Draco tried for snarky, but all that came out was a voice emulating Potter's own dead tone.
“I know the feeling” Harry commented blandly, before waiting for Draco to continue.
Draco obliged, taking the man's verminous cock into his mouth. Hollowing his cheeks, he sucked; rhythmically alternating between deep swallows and teasing licks, his tongue tracing the vein that ran along the underside before swirling around the head. They were all the same to him. Just another dick to blow, to jerk. To have shoved up his ass. It had stopped being violation long ago. Now it was just a means to survive.
he could cry.
“It’s been sixty-four days.”
“What happened?” Traces of the burning man were back.
“One is not the other.”
Harry's gagged. He knows that much, is familiar with the stretch and clamp and taste of a ball-gag lodged firmly between teeth. His response is instinctive; the aftermath of days and evenings spent like this in this very club, although never under such pretences. Never with only his taste and smell to guide him through a scene. His arousal is a potent swirl of lust and apprehension, the lick of intoxicating stimulation at the base of his spine. Harry's sure he can smell it, pheromones on the air as if he's suddenly a werewolf, sure that his dick must be swelling, his toes curling. He wants to cry out, shudder. Bend and twist under the misinstrations of an unknown man his mind cannot help but mould into Draco. It's not. He knows it's not, he wouldn't, couldn't, be that lucky. Is positive his body would know somehow, even without a face to guide him. Yet here in this blankness, the stranger's unknowingly given him a gift: the prerogative for fabrication. Unconditional allowance to pretend.
Draco.
Knees pressed into the unforgiving grain of wood floorboards, clammy hands clasped together, body curled, concave. The air bites your naked flesh, the shallow huff of your breath the only disturbance within the still room. Head hung, hair brushing the nape of your neck, you wait.
His body is alive under a ceaseless conflagration. Harry writhes, trapped, fighting uselessly against the biting lines of chain that hold him hostage. Burning, aflame, white-hot and incandescent; surely charred to gleaming bone.
"Whole birds, darling, not just the feathers. Sparrows, fantails, that sort of thing. I've even seen a raven or two, which is definitely an option worth considering." He and Camille had attended a ball in Paris once, some extravaganza thrown by a well-healed sovereign. The stand-out of the night had been the outfit worn by the sovereign's paramore: a loincloth of multicoloured plumage and half mask on which a taxidermy parrot had perched. He'd taken the boy to bed the next night. "Absolutely amazing, once you've added a touch of organza or lace." He lets his features fall into a sultry leer, imagining. "Pair it with the right outfit, and you're going to be screaming '
Draco's eyes smoulder. Harry shudders. Magnus deduces it would be an appropriate time to leave, tightness in his pants be damned.
I'm in your room; on your bed, and it smells of you, wrapping me in an embrace which, if I close my eyes, lets me pretend you're here with me. A stolen, forbidden moment, that's all I got, when my lips met yours.
, across Harry's ears. "Sight. Touch. Sound. Taste. Smell." A breathy pause, a building of anticipation, the moment before the fall. "So I decided, for tonight. I'm going to take them away. And it will only be with your complete compliance that they'll be returned."
"The aim is to gradually add to your headpiece. Subtly - enough that it moistens his intrigue, but never in an outlandish way. Eventually, your once understated hat will have transformed magnificently into a glorious example of tasteful extravagance, and Draco will be begging for you to take him, bent over my chaise."
One stray, clutching, abandoned and destitute, to another; both lost adrift in an amaranthine storm.
When he was twenty two he learnt acceptance. How the events of the past faded over time, and whilst they never disappeared, one could begin to live with them. Even though one had once done wrong, it didn't mean they would forever be wrong. What his body craved didn't make him less - a deviant, an abomination - and it was okay to give in to the free fall, because someone would catch him.
Harry looks gleeful at his newly acquired companion. Mrs Chonk radiates an air of smug contentment. Magnus necks the rest of his whisky before pressing his fingers to his temples and wishing for the delightful peace of a healing seaweed face wrap.
With that thought a shudder rakes through your body and you scramble to your feet, grabbing his hand and pulling him up with you, urging him back until his feet collide with a wall. There’s desperation as your hands grip his biceps, and, yes, a hint of ownership - of taking what’s
The heavy door is smooth, cold under his hand and always surprisingly pliant to his touch, swinging open on soundless pins with no resistance nor complaint.
You’re almost certain that his formal speech is a playful jab, an attempt to ease the tension that surrounds this impromptu...
Aboard the carriage, fire stoked and final whistle blowing, they’ll be fine. He’s succeeded; all ties to life severed.
His hair catches around your fingers, dark to your light. Eyes the wrong shade of green open at the tug, flicker over the face you're suddenly desperate to have looking like your own.
Willowy, tall, pale. Legs wrapped in the shiny clutch of synthetic black leading up to a chest clothed with scarcely more than the mere suggestion of mesh, heeled boots crafted from the muted iridescence of dragon hide reaching to the knee.
Draco let out a strangled laugh. “You think I can beat my father? With no wand? He’s ruthless, Harry. He doesn't give a shit, and doesn't play by anyone's rules.”
So he doesn't. Resolutely so, even as he opens letter II with completely-stable fingers, checks the boxes with his chicken-scratch penmanship next to

You pull back slightly, gulp a breath, try to take a moment. But his tongue traces along your jaw before he moves to your neck, sucking pale skin until blood blossoms diligently under his advances, and you're lost again.
First set of lyrics are from 'O Children' by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds.
Not a dominant either, but you can't deny the anticipation as he gives you a sharp push which sends you tumbling backwards onto a bed you hadn't realised was there; his body quickly following to loom over you, hands pressed to your shoulders. No, you don't want a dominant, but you’re not going to fight against the thrill of his overwhelming power.
“My absence.”
The word hangs in the air. Why indeed? Why has Harry sat here for weeks on end, suffering through the bitter cold on the off chance Draco would once again walk this way? How does he even start to explain to his once-enemy how he felt like he had no other choice? That, for reasons better left unexplored, Draco had somehow turned from the antagonist to the protagonist in Harry’s aftermath story? The key to, well, if not happiness, then contentment. The only person Harry thinks will understand. Him. This. Everything.
, on display and malleable to your whim. You love this,
Only the broken ones practice indifference. The ones whose minds have yielded before their bodies, stared into the abyss and found themselves unwilling to return. They’re the careless. The interestless. The lifeless. The less.
Draco needed to get home. Or, to the pathetic pile of blankets which offered the only sort of solace within his pitiable excuse for an existence. Panting, he pulled himself to his hands and knees, his aching body protesting from the beating it had just taken. Beaten. That was the word he would use, and not just from that man; he was an abandoned carcass left to rot, ostracized from not only the wizarding world,  but shunned by muggles as well. No matter where he went, he would never be more than the disgraced Malfoy heir, abhorred by his once-acquaintances, eschewed by old contacts and desecrated by the very people on which he relied to survive.
You saved four children before you went. I only want to save myself. This life is over for me; I’m ready for our next one.
"What?" Draco asked, wishing that this… shell of Potter would start making sense, or at least show him where a shower was.
"Malfoy?"
"Surprisingly enough, I do," said Potter sarcastically. "And you know it, that I understand what it means to have Voldemort messing with my life."
"As I said, it is none of your business."
, as if there were no more generic compliments. McGonagall seemed happy with the answer, though, and even Snape had nothing to pick on.
"Don't listen to him, Ron, he needs the attention. He just wishes it was him that could kiss Harry's ass, isn't it, Malfoy?"
"Why didn't I force you? Wow, as bad as your perception of me is, I do not coerce people into kissing me, Potter."
A week later, Harry was going mad.
It made him feel better because, for the better or the worse, he now belonged in that room.
"I don't know, because he never shuts up and he thinks he is morally superior and he thinks so highly of himself and goes around as if he's a hero whose only purpose is to save everybody, and I don't need that-"
Harry winced, expecting one of Malfoy's cold-hearted comeback. But the snarky reply never came.
The bathroom was neatly arranged. And it smelled refreshing, almost comforting.
"First, I am going to eat my breakfast," he said, provokingly. "I thought you were not coming back tonight anyways."
? Instead of sleeping you use this to spy on me, and you say you don't care?"
"Thanks, Weasley, I can see that you are a true gentleman unlike your friend Potter... Oh, right, you are not actual friends, he is just the celebrity whose ass you faithfully kiss."
"That
There was no answer again. He just stood there, empty.
"I'm sure you are interpreting it all wrong!"
He forced himself out of bed. Absentmindedly, he run his eyes across the green section of the room, only to discover that all of Malfoy's things were neatly arranged, his bed perfectly made, and no books left behind. It was still early in the morning, but the Slytherin had left long ago. Harry sighed with resignation. Not that he wanted to see Malfoy ever again in his life. His brain finished waking up and started reproducing the new images
"Oi!!! What the fuck are you doing?!"
"W-What? Malfoy?"
Harry wondered how was it possible that his usually terrible memory had been able to retain details like Malfoy's blond eyelashes, or how fucking smooth his tongue felt. And there were definitely too many memories of Malfoy's neck, both before and after he had tasted it. It was like all his senses had focused on that neck, and how good it looked, and how well it smelled. Merlin.
"'Of course not," Harry managed to spit out, too hysterically to be an ounce convincing. "Why would you think so?"
"No, Harry, that's not what we are saying. Have you considered that maybe he is using the kissing and whatever else you do to distract you?"
"Are you hearing yourselves?! I did not kiss Malfoy! That's disgusting!"
"I'll be able to handle him."
kiss me?"
"Just trying to start a conversation."
"Apparently, very little!"
"What the fuck is your problem?! That could have killed me!"
that Draco wanted to punch. "What the hell are you doing?" he hissed.
Draco breathed deeply and fought back the tears of pain that were trying to escape.
"When was the last time we came here?" he asked.
"What?!" cried Harry, which did not help his case.
"HARRY."
would I want to tell
"Hm, do you remember our little room?" she whispered, sitting so that their bodies would be really close. "Do you want to go, for old times sake?"
Without talking, in a silence that was not terrible anymore, but comfortable and soothing, they gazed cautiously into each other's eyes. Malfoy was shaking again, and Harry's heart was jumping violently in his chest, but it was an unexpectedly pleasant sensation. Their eyes smiled nervously. Tentatively.
"You could have asked for it like a sane person would, instead of coming here to do what, Malfoy? To take the book? What an excuse."
much more. Sure, he was trying to be accepting and understanding of Harry's horrible taste in men. But how was it possible that no one was saying anything about the green tie. And why on Earth was he wearing that when he was not even able to talk to them about it?
"What did I do yesterday?" he said, blinking innocently.
"Are you completely out of your mind?" Malfoy was not cooperating. He kept screaming and shaking his imprisoned arm. "Why on
"I think there has been some kind of miscommunication, Professor," said Malfoy, with a mischievous grin. "The only one that screams in the middle of the night is Potter."
, he teased, his tongue obscenely moistening his mouth.
"Nothing, nothing, don't worry," he replied weakly. "Really. Don't worry."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Didn't you want to go to bed?" At this point, Harry just wanted to escape those piercing gray eyes.
"Yeah, obviously," sneered Draco, sensing what the question was really about. He mentally cursed Pansy for being so fast.
"Okay, stand up. We are going back to the Castle."
"Did you talk to him about Katie? Did he tell you what was he doing that day?"
Draco jumped out of bed and immediately felt dizzy, but he managed to quickly walk to Potter. The screams were definitely coming from his bed.
Tac, tac, tac, tac, t-
"What are you talking about? What am I supposed to admit?"
"Dobby is pleased to bring dinner, sir. Dobby just wonders if some of the food is for Draco Malfoy, sir."
Harry considered it.
"MOVE, POTTER."
He would improvise.
Harry's heart hurt in his chest. Malfoy's body shined because of the water and he was pale as the moon. He was fucking beautiful, but Harry forced himself to look away. For some reason, he could not force his legs to leave the bathroom.
Harry blinked a couple times and realised that they were sitting outside. The weather was chilly, and the trees were dressed in all shades of orange and brown. How curious. When had he arrived outside? And where did Ron and Hermione come from? The last thing he remembered happening was... Well,
Despite the feeble excuses he could think off, Ron and Hermione were able to lock themselves and Harry up in an empty classroom.
Oh, fuck.
Ron was too lost to complain, and Harry was left alone in the middle of the hallway.
He was going to be sick.
"What do you want now, Malfoy?"
"POTTER! OUT!"
"HARRY!"
He rushed outside for a morning flight. September was coming to its end and the wind was getting colder as days passed. The chilling sensation against his face was one of the pleasures he could still enjoy. Up in the air, he was able to forget. To forget Father, to forget his mission, to forget the black mark that had been burning in his left arm for months now. Up in the air, all that mattered was the wind against his face. Like everything good in his life, it did not last.
"You are terrible."
"I asked. I'm tired of not knowing."
Hermione wanted to scream and shake Harry's head until his bubble burst and he woke up. He was totally falling for Malfoy, it was painfully obvious, and she highly doubted that it was mutual.
He did not know enough magic to fix that stupid cupboard.
"You left the Dark Mark in plain sight?!" shrieked Pansy. Draco, the most thorough and cautious person she knew, had gone around exposing a really good reason to lock him up in Azkaban. Just because he was stupid and horny.
"We need to talk," he said at last.
At that, they did not answer inmediately. McGonagall was pushing them. She was throwing a challenge, evaluating how far they could keep up with their good behaviour. Potter obviously missed it, like he missed all the subtleties in life.
Like Harry Potter with his muggle-born mother. Draco had known since he was seven all the facts about Harry Potter, including the fact that Lily Potter had been one of the best witches in the Wizarding World.
"What is there to learn with such an insufferable-" he started, but suddenly stopped. He concentrated on the pain in his arm, on his plan. "Well, I have definitely learnt some things, yes. For instance- For instance, how different it is to share a room with a Gryffindor compared to four Slytherins."
of obsession. It was Ron's turn to shiver. He didn't know when had Harry began to
Draco looked him in the eyes. Those green eyes he hated so much and that kept ending up so close that he could see how they
"We are never mentioning this, okay?" He avoided Harry's gaze.
Draco felt sick.
"Different in what way?" asked McGonagall.
"Yeah, I know," he mumbled with frustration.
"And get to avoid you talking too much and ruining it all? Definitely."
"I don't. But I know you. You are not the kind that licks more powerful people's asses. You hate being inferior to anyone. So don't be, Malfoy. Because it is embarrassing to watch."
Silence.
Draco shrugged even if Potter could not see him. "Who knows, Potter."
"What? How dare you? Shut up? You cannot shut me up-."
. The way his pupils
"Listen, it's late, why don't we talk tomorrow over breakfast? And then in the evening, you can hang out here if you want."
Draco was legitimately scared. He didn't want her to know, but now she knew. She'd guessed. She'd bloody guessed without any prompts. He was cornered and that's were his tomb would be. In a dirty closet. So he might as well die with pride, right?
"You might not talk to each other, but I think that we can all agree that shouting in the night is not a sign of you two doing well enough," said McGonagall.
"I do that already."
"Well enough," replied Malfoy.
had happened just before his eyes.
"I have to tell Ron, he is as much of a friend to Harry as I am, and he is actually dealing with this whole thing better than me."
"Yes, Potter. Merlin, you really should learn some manners." Under his anger, Draco felt his cheeks burning, and yet he still managed to hide behind his mask.
"I've read it a million times, Potter."
"You tell me."
"Do you mind the food?"
Harry was left alone, once again. He could not stop eating
"What do you know? You don't know me, Potter! You don't know shit! Let! Me! Go!" he yelled, violently moving his arm to get rid of him. It was the arm with the dark mark. And it was hurting him.
Harry felt how his head was ready to explode. He could not
And then Draco heard Potter's voice, muffled because of the thick curtains separating them.
human being.
"Help yourself, prince," and it did not sound as sarcastic as intended. It was entertaining to see him eat, and at least that way, his mind could rest and stop wondering about where and what he was doing.
"Because we walked on them when they were about to kiss!"
"Are you done? Because I want to sleep and your butthurt speech because I kicked you out of my bed bores me."
the hero crap you want people to believe. It's... Morgana, it's like you are obsessed with me."
"Doesn't surprise me when you are a dick anymore, Malfoy. Plus, McGonagall already gave me the talk of how I should not use violence, not even against jerks like you."
"I asked him, okay?" he retorted, but at least he slowed down. "I asked him about Katie, and he didn't answer, but he didn't have to because the answer was obvious, and I already knew anyway, and I don't know what to do now-."
? Who the hell did he think he was? Potter
. How he got to be a
Silence.
"Is it Voldemort, Malfoy?" Harry was so close to Malfoy that he felt in his own skin how he trembled when hearing the name.
"Mr. Potter! Are you ignoring me?"
"You cannot seriously think that I would wear your tie on purpose."
that obsession. Merlin, it was weird. Ron could not fathom how could that pale, entitled prick could ever be...
"Well, we don't know that. And even if he is not a Death Eater, his family is, and he might want to do anything to be in the good side of Voldemort."
"Good. See? We made it!"
"No, I mean, why did you? In the first place?"
"I don't want to help you, are you deaf? I don't care whatever shit you are in. You are despicable. You only know how to hide and complain about how hard your life is and how little options you have. It's pathetic. There's actual people dying, and all you care about is how hard you have it. We all have it hard, Malfoy, but this is about something bigger than that."
him now. And Draco was in the fucking moon because his hands were rough and big and he could feel them in his back and in his stomach and in his chest. And it was too much. But it was the best kind of too much.

thing, and how weirdly flirtatious it sounded every time Potter said it.
are. I don't want anybody to think I'm with
"Shit, I'm such an idiot." Harry pushed away every trace of betrayal he could have felt, and let the rage take him. He run before anyone could stop him, not that they had the energy to try, and he went after the bloody snake with every intention of beating him to death.
Maybe Ron and Hermione knew how to interpret it. He definitely could not. What the hell was there to interpret?
if he somehow managed to complete the mission. Because he also had nightmares about his own loved ones being killed. Because in an ironic and evil corner in his mind, at that instant, he felt closer to Harry Potter than to any other person in his life.
Ron was still quiet, his eyes moving quickly between the door of the bathroom and Harry, and the place where he had stood with Malfoy.
"Shut up, Malfoy."
Eventually, Potter turned off the lights and Draco heard him going to bed.
"Are you asleep?" the gryffindor boy asked.
"I'm sure you can," he muttered. Maybe that was the problem. Maybe he just needed to get rid of the hormones to forget about Potter. Maybe the weird Gryffindor disease that made him needy and broke his rational thoughts would be satisfied with a different person.
And when Harry thought his brain was about to combust, Ron arrived.
Maybe he was dreaming because normally he was more able to stop thinking about Potter. Not that he normally thought about Potter. At all. Nope.
"But it doesn't matter, does it? It doesn't matter if I cannot help the ones that most need it. I cannot guarantee anything to anybody. How can I help him when I will probably die this year?"
The words of his friends must have arrived to some corner of his brain, because Potter loosened his grasp slightly, although he did not let Draco go.
"A shower would be better but I guess you don't want me to shower you," said Potter, laughing a bit. Draco did not understand why he laughed. He
"I kind of deserved that punch. I lost it back there," murmured Malfoy suddenly. "And close your mouth, will you? For Merlin's sake, you are disgusting."
"Wow, Potter, I didn't know you had such a big head to steal others' properties."
"There are far more problems and situations than what your little brain is able to grasp. You have no clue. Your revolutionary speeches will get you all killed. This is not about some stupid good against evil romance that you have created in your head. This is about survival, and I will sure as hell try to survive, Potter." Draco spoke slowly because every word hurt. "I am not in a position where I can care about anything else. And what is your cute story of braveness and honour worth if you get killed?"
when they went to visit Harry was a product of his wild imagination.
"Yes, Potter. A bad dream. You were shouting."
Eventually, the water got cold and his fingertips wrinkled. He stood up and drained the water. The air around him was warm, heated by the autumn sun that entered through the windows. He mindlessly opened the toilet door and went to his truck to grab some clothes and a towel. He wet everything as he walked around but he did not give a crap.
That night, Draco arrived to the room late. Even in the darkness, the green and red halves were clearly separated.
Draco breathed in. He just had to open the curtains of his bed and climb in. Potter had always respected that. He just had to hide under his blankets and fall asleep. But Potter was not having it. And the world had to work as Potter wanted. Always as Potter wanted. The Scar-Face had quickly stood up and was holding the curtains, blocking them before he could escape. Their hands were awfully close and Draco hated how he noticed that.
"I'm not kissing you this time."
"Does reading help you to fall asleep?"
accident? Really?"
The anger of Harry must have been terrible because Malfoy turned to face him and had the fucking
Draco's mouth had the decency of not responding to that.
He saw him.
"We will talk tomorrow, then. Let's go, Ron."

Naturally, Potter didn't know how to interpret shit.
The next morning, Draco woke up feeling much better.
"Yes, is just that... I'd like to sleep here in Slytherin tonight."
"Sure, Potter. If that lets you sleep at nights..."
Malfoy's red face was now as close as could be. Harry could basically smell him. Thank Merlin, he still had some control left over his actions and didn't start
And he did it.
"I don't care! You are such a miserable, selfish, sad man," Potter said, looking at him with a despise that made him sick.
Pansy kept looking at him in the eye. And then she stood up and started pacing. Draco also stood up not knowing what to say. What the hell had just happened?
At last, Potter opened his eyes in shock, scared as Draco had never imagined he'd see him. He kept trembling for a bit, and Draco did not stop holding his arms until he calmed down.
"Nothing, Ron. Harry was just telling me how he thinks it was Malfoy who poisoned Katie." Ron tried to interrupt, but she stopped him with a hand gesture. "He also thinks that it was not on purpose. And in fact, I agree. I guess Voldemort could coerce him into doing anything, especially because all his family and most of his social context have always been supportive of Voldemort's ideas. But based on his moods and behaviour, he could definitely be having trouble with that. He surely looks stressed out. I would say that the most worrying part is how far can he go, and what is it that he is supposed to do that stresses him so much."
Draco had spent the whole day in the Room of Requirements. At least, he had been there physically. His head was somewhere else.
"If Malfoy cares just a tiny bit about Harry, it is more likely for him to survive if he's not left alone with Voldemort," Hermione explained ruthlessly. Parkinson was not nearly as scary as she thought she was.
"Don't touch me, you dipshit!" he said pulling away from his grasp. "I've had enough accusations for today -what was that in the morning? Why would you cause such a scene out of nowhere? What was your brilliant plan, uh? Humiliate me? Because it
"What?" he snapped. Harry felt hot and his body had started reacting to the images his brain was now processing.
"I don't, but you keep arriving in the middle of the night from who knows
. But Potter was looking at him like that, overtly challenging him. To
"Potter, the counter spell doesn't work if you don't know what you want to get rid from."
Draco smiled. It was not even going to be hard. Potter wanted to get in his pants and much as him.
"All is wonderful."
"I hate you, I swear to Merlin. I hate you," Draco muttered under his breath.
Draco shivered. "Everyone gets nightmares, Potter."
Potter tried to smile, but his brain was starting to work again, too late as always, so he got rid of Malfoy's grasp and closed the door of the bathroom behind him.
"But what if the monsters are already inside?" muttered Potter, as if he'd forgotten who he was talking to, lost somewhere in his head. And Draco couldn't do this. He couldn't talk like this with Potter. This made no sense. He didn't realize that he was shivering until Potter shook his head like he was waking up and eyed him worriedly. "Malfoy, you are shaking."
"Leave my father out of our conversations, Potter. It is your fault that he is rotting in Azkaban."
Harry looked at himself in the mirror. He was red like an apple, and he he had a very obvious boner going on. He was a fucking mess.
Professor McGonagall was talking, probably scolding him for his chimpanzee-like behaviour and for all the points she was going to subtract from Gryffindor. Harry could not hear a thing. His head was spiralling, and far far away from Hogwarts and McGonagall's office, alternating between the graveyard and the veil, back and forward. Mistakes. Terrible deaths that had changed nothing. Malfoy's face was part of it and his words resonated in the background. His stupid ass face with his disgustingly mocking smile. They made him sick.
He did not say it, but Draco preferred to have mental breakdowns when someone was there to notice. Even if that someone was Harry Potter.
!" he barked angrily.
had completely destroyed any reasoning ability he had left. Specially, because twice seemed awfully little when Malfoy's hair sparkled across the room calling his attention. Harry hated that now he knew how that sparkling hair was as soft as the fucking clouds.
hehehe I am not the best with fixed deadlines, but i hope you like this one, pls tell me what do you think!!
There was a tense silence.
. Hell, Potter had actually kissed him
Harry choked and tried to block all the thoughts regarding how useful it could be to have a silenced room.
But Draco could not simply stop thinking. He could not. He could not forget everything else. He wanted to. He very honestly wanted to forget about everything that was not Potter's hands in his body, Potter's breath in his mouth. But he could not.
"What kind of plan?" Pansy asked, sitting casually next to her. Close enough for their thighs to touch. Hermione stiffed. Trusting Slytherins was something necessary if she wanted her plan to work, but it was not easy to forget that a very significant number of Slytherins had never hidden their hatred for muggle-borns. Especially not Draco Malfoy. And Parkinson had always followed Malfoy around and praised everything he said, so Hermione was not expecting Parkinson to be a completely different person where Malfoy was not concerned.
"There is nothing to think about."
Draco tensed up. The professors table was empty and the Gryffindors were clapping like brainless walruses to their brainless leader.
"Come on, then," Malfoy said, leaving the room, and Harry walked after him.
It was also useful to discard stupid conversation openers with the real Malfoy.
Harry knew he had to say something, but he did not know what the hell was going on. Ron barked a laugh, the jerk, not that he'd been listening.
"Did I? You could have fooled me, diving right into it."
Potter turned to look at him, shocked. Draco did not look back. He felt like smirking. It was the first time he said something positive about Potter and he loved how appalled he looked. Soon, he would start thinking that he must have lied and everything would go back to normal. But he had not lied. He also had not said all the truth, which is that caring
"I'm brilliant, and you?" he replied, and his throat hurt for talking.
"I cannot, you are holding me with your leg," he said mockingly.
Potter seemed startled for a moment and opened his mouth to shout something back. However, he seemed to give it a second thought and closed it again. To Draco's dismay, he resumed pacing around McGonagall's office, deliberately ignoring the hate wave that left the Slytherin's body. In a last attempt to try and keep it together, Draco leaned against the wall, directing all his efforts to not care about Potter.
Potter didn't reply anything, at least not at first.
"If he ever arrives, it will be," replied Harry, frowning at the door.

And then the subject of his obsession entered the room. And the way he had his tie untied around his neck, and how he wore his crumpled shirt outside his pants, and that hopeless mess of ungovernable hair on top of his absurd face with those sodding emerald eyes hidden under the same pitiful glasses that he'd been wearing since they were too big for his head in the first year, it was all a personal attack. It had to be intentional, the fact that Potter was destroying him simply by standing there in front of him.
"I figured."
Draco's thoughts were racing. A dare could work much better as a distraction, particularly for a Gryffindor as Harry Potter. It was perfect, because it would keep Potter close, and they would not need to find excuses to keep doing whatever they were doing. But how to phrase the fact that he wanted to get in Potter's pants as a dare?
"Yeah, what did that ferret do now?" added Ron, who found it much more amusing than her. He felt very positive about the insults and the screams between Harry and Malfoy coming back, because they had to mean that
"I don't. I give a shit about Harry, and Harry is not functioning properly because of Draco, but he may have a point in that Draco is alone and he might be doing stuff because he is out of options. And for the sake of Harry, I guess that maybe we can try to give him some other options. That he can decide to take or not, but at least we can offer."
"Are you scared? Of me?" he muttered, not sure if he wanted to know. Not sure why he'd asked. Malfoy's eyes were an abyss of emotions of an intensity he could not even imagine, and Harry felt a bit dizzy because if he fell in those eyes, there was no coming back.
Harry opened his mouth to answer back, but then he remembered Malfoy's warning and ended up closing it. He forced himself to sit down.
"What do you care about Malfoy?" replied Harry defensively. Hermione rolled her eyes and didn't bother to look at him while she kept walking hurriedly towards the Great Hall.
It is not that the system has failed black people, or poor people, or disabled people. The truth is that the system was never meant for them. And that is a system that DOES NOT WORK. Capitalism does not work. Racism does not work. Fascism does not work.
He could not face him. He could not look him in the eye again. Not after almost killing an innocent girl. He would not be able to bear it. He would not be able to face him ever again.
"Don't leave, prince. I was having such an
Draco should have seen it coming.
Through which he for sure had been able to watch the embarrassingly short game that had taken place. And he was writing a fucking DADA
They did not talk. Harry eventually felt like he could stop eating. Malfoy was a distraction big enough to not have the need to fill the silence with food. And it was not awkward because Malfoy was too focused on the food. He ended up finishing everything, which for some reason felt extremely satisfying for Harry. When he was done, they tidied up and Draco spelled the smell away and sent the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.
He was having a nightmare.
"We are barely inside the Forest, Potter. The Castle is right there. And you are here too. Why would the danger bother me more than you?"
." Then he noticed that the bastard was just standing there like an idiot, torturing him. "
"You are ignoring me? Is that what you are doing? Ignoring me? It must me a coward's best strategy, right? Running away, hiding."
"It's all a plan. If he sees me as a sexual partner, he doesn't see me as a Death Eater, so he doesn't try his heroic deeds with me, and he doesn't spy on what I'm doing."
. And then the memories of Potter reading it to him flooded his head.
"I cannot." Draco held on to Harry's shirt, in a hopeless attempt of clinging to reality. "I cannot do this. Please, I can't."
"Of course you don't. It is a crazy beautiful colour."
"As long as necessary, Professor," Potter replied, too quickly.
on me."
"Did you ask him about Katie?" she asked tentatively, stepping back to stand next to him.
"Right, sir. Dobby will be around if Harry Potter needs."
"No? Wow, you could have tricked me," said Draco coldly.
"You are coming with me," insisted Potter, and he grabbed his arm to push him up of the ground. Draco almost stood up because he was weak and Potter's touch apparently had that kind of persuasive power on him.
"Oh, that's why you are acting so angry and hurt! You've been rejected! What did you do to scare that poor Gryffindor away?"
"I see." Hermione swallowed hard, and then she dropped the question that was burning in her throat. "And how's Malfoy?"
Harry was just watching, astonished and lowkey having fun. There was definitely not that much to clean up, but Malfoy just couldn't stop walking around, shouting spells and insulting him like he was not there. He decided to make him suffer a bit longer and stayed without a shirt. He did grab a towel to dry his hair, unnecessarily slowly. He did not stop observing Malfoy, who had now entered the bathroom to return it to the perfectly neat state in which he had left it in the morning.
He breathed.
to the teachers and their silly educational strategies, and it translated into more detention too.
"Yes, of course! Why wouldn't I be okay?" he replied.
When Malfoy finally came out of the bathroom, already dressed with his hair neatly combed, both Harry and the room were immaculate. Malfoy was back to his normal pale and emotionless face, and he did not comment.
While he worked, reading the books he had brought there with the Vanishing Cabinet, his mind was far away. Even if his hands moved around determinately, writing notes down, cursing and plotting, his mind wandered to Potter. He hated when his mind did that. He had enough Potter in his life for his head to dedicate even more time to him. But it happened often, and he'd learnt how to function regardless.
He ate for a while. Everything was delicious.
"You don't get it, do you? That will get him killed! And Potter will be killed too if he's not careful!"
"Friends, Harry. Young Tom had no interest in making friends. He preferred to act alone, and he never sought for the help of others. He made up his own mind with no other influence but his own. That boy you saw in the memory was already making up his ideas, as flawed as they might have been, and he had nobody to tell him any differently."
"Professor McGonagall will arrive in a few minutes," informed Snape.
Malfoy had not appeared in any of the classes Slytherin had with Gryffindor.
He really was. He needed the Quidditch match that was going to take place that evening. He needed to confront Malfoy in the comfortable context of sports. He wanted to get rid, even if it was just for a while, of the image of Malfoy, the roommate.
"I don't know exactly what is going on. Harry won't talk about it, but I do know that
"From what you told me, he is not precisely keen on accepting help, so it buys us time to find a way to make him accept our help."
Maybe Harry was about to die too.
Draco also wanted leave, but Potter was really not helping to keep his cool. He was sitting in a well thought position, pretending to be bored and above the sitation. But on the inside, he was on edge. And Potter moving around made him want to jump him and knock him dead. He was unbearable and noisy and obnoxious and Draco was going to lose his mind if he kept pacing around.
It wasn't. Harry didn't know why but it made no sense that Malfoy didn't get it.
i'm alive hehehehe
. How is
Well, Hermione hadn't thought it was going to be that easy to convince Parkinson. She still was optimistic, though, because Parkinson had given out a very key aspect. She'd never denied that Malfoy cared about Harry, which meant that she suspected Malfoy did care.
Harry wished he could tell them. But what would he say? Malfoy kissed me. He fucking kissed me. No reason at all. He grabbed my fucking face and kissed me. And that wasn't even the worst part. He could not even articulate in his head what the worst part was.
"If you had listened to the whole explanation, you would have known that these spells work both ways. They can be countered with the other, but alone, their effects are ruthless. Next time, exercise your patience, or listen to the lesson."
Draco stood up, taking the hand of the girl, and he dragged her out of Slytherin, all the way to their room, a small corner lost in the maze that Hogwarts was. It was barely a room, completely empty and not even painted, it had no windows and its door was barely visible. The previous year, they had made it their own with a couple of big blankets and some pillows, and a candlelight fluttered in a corner for light and warmth. It was the only place where they almost acted like friends, where their calculated relationship stretched into a more irrational companionship in which they honestly liked each other beyond the benefits and the costs.
Right, when a professor addresses you, you have to answer.
"What the fuck, Potter?!" shrieked Malfoy when the huge weight of his body fell on him.
"Merlin, 'Mione. Harry was wearing his tie, what were you expecting?"
, but Malfoy countered it easily, non verbally as well.
"I'm sure it is far more annoying to have the actual nightmares," said McGonagall firmly. Harry forgot too often how much he appreciated her.
And that's when Harry's legs finally responded and he rushed outside of the bathroom. He was closing the door behind him, when Draco called him again.
"I know that, Malfoy. And it is a perfectly fine bed to sleep in."
Well, at least they still had Quidditch. That remained constant, the fact that he could still confront Malfoy up in the sky and forget about their current living situation.
"And what is your opinion on the matter?" asked Pansy.
"We were going to sleep, Granger," shouted Malfoy from the bathroom. "You can be glad you didn't wake me up."
"It's not an excuse," he lied, his face contorting in desperate fear because apparently, he was so messed up, that he'd lost his ability to lie. Potter knew, and he laughed at him.
He still agreed with his child self in a lot of things, but now he knew much more.
, okay? We are all a bit tense, 'cause this is an itchy topic, and it is pretty...
"So when is this stupid detention ending?" asked Ron.
," said Malfoy. The cold stopped.
Potter didn't find it funny. Which was a pity. Because Draco liked when Potter found his comments funny.
"I have homework for Snape."
used my bath?!"
He didn't have a choice, and the only option he had, he did not know how to accomplish.
"We have been talking about Quidditch all afternoon," frowned Hermione. "What is going on with you?"
"So talking of putting up with scumbags, how are you?" asked Ron.
Malfoy got rid of him as roughly as he could, fuming. Harry burst out in loud laughter. Because that's what it was. A
Draco also had nightmares. He was just much quieter about it. He woke up, trembling and sweating, but in complete silence. He had learnt not to scream during the summer.
Harry, Ron and Hermione had seen her. Touching it, the necklace. Not even a pretty necklace. Some old antique. They had seen her. And she had acted weird, Hermione kept saying. They should have known. How did he even get that shit, Ron wondered. Poor Katie. She will be okay, she has to. Hermione wanted to cry, and Ron tried to confort her. Harry would not open his mouth. He could not understand what was happening. His mind was far away. His thoughts unravelling fast, going through much darker paths than his friends'.
"If you manage to coexist like this during this week, we might consider lifting the detention next Sunday," said McGonagall.
"How do you know?" she muttered.
"So you don't have His Mark."
"We are too far. I don't want to shout."
Harry was a bit too worked up for what Hermione considered reasonable. She was used to Harry's bursts, but there was something pained in his expression that was new. Hermione was not the best at reading other people's emotions, but even she'd noticed that something was off. Something had been off since the moment that she'd gone to Harry's new room to pick him up, and she'd had to drag him out of the room because he hadn't wanted to leave his bed.
"What's up, Ron?" Harry asked tentatively.
"Malfoy! Don't be a child!" protested Potter, but he pretended to not hear.
"I wasn't offering," she stopped him before he fully went back to the conceited guy that would never listen to her, "but then you have to agree with me that Potter is a hobby, and you cannot afford hobbies."
idea that he is a Death Eater."
"Whatever, Ronald."
"With Malfoy. How is it to share a room with him?"
"What the fuck, Malfoy?!" shouted Potter, getting out of bed, so that they both stood next to the Gryffindor's bed, face to face and a visceral mixture of fury and madness between them.
"But you kissed," said Hermione, and it was not a question. "Why?"
"Ruining what? I'm just asking a simple question!"
"Come on, Malfoy. At least nod if you are feeling better."
Draco breathed deeply, clenching his fists. He could not fight Potter. Not tonight.
Even if Draco hated what Pansy was suggesting, even though he didn't understand why he hated it, there was a warmth and a reassurance in her voice that made him feel better. Besides, she of course was right. It was better if they stayed apart.
"Civil? You? Please, look around. You are not even able to pile up the dirty dishes. Morgana, how much did you eat?" he complained, deliberately ignoring Harry's attempts to talk. "Are these salads for me?"
"We need to what? Why?" Hermione asked, liberating herself from Pansy's grasp, but too curious to live the room.
"I'm not spying on you!" complained Potter weakly.
All Draco knew now was that he was alone and that he absolutely hated his life. He was trapped in a conflict that was none of his business. He had to follow the Dark Lord's orders, which made him want to puke, so that he could avoid more harm being done to his family, who were the adults supposed to be protecting him. He had to prove himself to people that he despised. Worst of all, he needed that approval, he needed that his family saw him and valued him. He needed to prove that he was
"Day before last before we left for summer. You wanted me to wank you to see how long you would last."
"You don't want anything? The orange juice is good for you. You need vitamins. The elves told me that it's fresh."
"Sure, sure. Just hungry."
"I don't know. I guess you've always been brighter." Draco felt the heat coming up his neck again and he couldn't bring himself to look at Potter. It was ridiculous. It was not particularly extraordinary to be brighter than him, anyway. "I come here because sometimes it feels safer to be surrounded by trees than by Hogwarts walls," the Gryffindor offered. "Trees cannot crumble around you and bury you in stone, can they?"
Oh, Crowley.
"Uhum," Malfoy said with the coldest of tones, which almost made Harry retreat. But his brain had already sent the order. It was done.
images. But at least Ron, as clueless as he was of what was going on in his head, didn't despise him.
"Just talk? So you don't want to explore what the world looks like beyond Weasley?"
"Because he slipped on the salad!"
"First, we have to learn to detect the effects of the spell on ourselves when they are still low."
"Only sleep! No implications, no sneaky stuff. Only sleep. Nothing else. Just... In the same bed?"
"Did you sleep well last night?"
"I really
"Really, Harry? Since when do you believe shit like that? Did he kneel and vowed with the Transfiguration book on his chest? Wow, only the image is enough to make me cry."
"Potter! Shove off!"
So, why would Malfoy wake up so early on a Saturday? What was he up to? Harry could not just forget the scene at Knockturn alley, as well as that proud conversation he had had with his friends on the train when he had innocently spied on him. And what with the
"Like what?"
"At least I did something!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"So how are you holding on?" asked Snape, straight to the point.
"Yes, 'Mione, you should drop your ambitions to be Minister of Magic and become an actress instead."
"Well, if you want something, help yourself." Why did he offer? A mystery for the books.
"Actions speak louder than words, Potter. Do I have to remind you how you just barged in the bathroom while I was naked?"
hatred, and very
The Polyjuice Potion was ready for Crabbe and Goyle, the necklace was carefully secured in its box. If no one opened it, no one would be injured. He had written down explicit instructions for his stupid friends to follow. No one would be suspicious of him or his accomplices.
"Bye, bye, Granger. Pleasure talking to you," called Pansy laughing.
And Draco was a hot mess that was still not capable of movement. All his muscles were rigid. All him was rigid. And he knew that if he ever managed to move again, the sound of the movement would be abrupt enough to break the still quietness of the room, which would likely wake up Potter. And Draco could not have Potter waking up when he was standing there, in his current state, so close to his bed.
"You are unbelievable, you know that?" he told him, but it did not feel like an attack, more like a warning, as Potter was looking at Draco's mouth with some kind of hunger And Draco parted his lips pathetically. Potter was too close once again, so close that he was not able to ignore him. So he might as well kiss him to death. "You are fucking unbelievable," insisted Potter, and the way he cursed shocked Draco's insides.
Harry pressed the arm that was holding him against the wall harder, and his wand was now pressing dangerously against his neck, shaking with magic. The fury in Harry's eyes must have been terrible because Malfoy doubted and shut up. However, he did not stop challenging him with stupid pride. And it was then when Harry saw the black bags under the eyes of his sworn enemy, when he realised how brittle his skin looked, and when he found some dirt in his silver irises that had never been there. And even at his worse, he still looked bloody beautiful.
"I'm sorry, Potter, but I am not here to amuse you."
He was going to say it. He felt his impulsive, idiotic brain forming the words. He felt his mouth salivating. He felt the last remains of his rationality fighting back.
Ron nodded like a zombie. He did not say a word. How was it possible that. What on Earth.
It kind of put his life into perspective. It had been bad to watch him crumble last night, but it was Malfoy. And he had never stopped being a huge arsehole.
"Just come and take it, alright?" ordered Draco.
"So no more fucking around with Potter, okay?"
. Such a revolting being. Such an idiotic prat, always so full of himself. Look at me, I'm a hero. Look at me and my messy hair and my perfect eyes. Damn him. And damn the irreparable cabinet. Damn bloody Potter.
him. How he got to be the
Hope you liked the chapter. It is a bit shorter than the others I think, but it is pretty intense.
And that was how Harry Potter, a proud Gryffindor, famous for his braveness and courage, escaped the scene and hid in his bed. And Draco was left alone, miserably standing against the wall, with the worst case of blue balls he had ever experienced. And he felt like crying. Out of frustration. Out of anger. How dared Potter leave him like that.
He did not say it, but Harry regretted how he had punched him at Snape's office. He did not regret Malfoy's new crooked nose, though.
Malfoy's face contorted into a mocking smile. Harry felt like punching him again.
"No one is taking Quidditch away from you, Potter. You can still play. Don't get so worked up, Merlin."
"'Cause, you're out of your mind. More than normal."
Draco felt his face twitching, his mask threatening to break in a million pieces.
. Harry Potter indeed probably thought of him as his worst enemy. (He considered that an achievement, given the existence of the Dark Lord.) And he now had to share a room with him.
"Because I personally don't give a shit about Potter, but out of consideration for Draco, I think least harm can be done if I know what is going on on Potter's side."
"Ron saw you."
Oh, no.
someone. Harry felt some kind of betrayal. Or anger. It was mostly anger. There he was, suffering through the worst punishment he had ever gotten while Malfoy was having sleepovers. Fucking Malfoy.
And then the door opened.
"Enough Potter!" shouted Draco standing up as well.
"POTTER!" yelled Malfoy, with the high pitch he reserved for Harry and Harry only.
"Shut up! I'm thinking!"
Sick Malfoy was the most annoying version of Malfoy that Harry had ever dealt with, and that was something. Sick Malfoy complained all the time, and he would not fall asleep. After he'd put him to bed, Malfoy had managed to stay quiet for twenty minutes, and then he hadn't shut up for five hours.
"What about you, Mr Potter?" She turned towards the other boy.
"We have barely done anything," she joked, pulling apart and looking carefully into his eyes. Then they sat against the wall, next to each other, and Pansy hold his hand quietly.
Harry breathed as if he was trying to control an anxiety attack, which made Hermione more nervous. Why had she started asking anything without Ron there to help out?
"You stick your nose a lot in my business to then say that you don't care," grunted Draco.
echoed in Draco's head.
But waiting for Malfoy with food in his stomach would definitely be easier.
"Son of a bitch!" Ron was not laughing anymore. "Don't you dare listen to that colossal dirtbag, Harry. I cannot believe he said that."
"Isn't it tiring? Having nightmares, I mean. As if we didn't deal with enough shit just because we were born at a certain moment in a certain family, we also cannot sleep properly."
was not the word. Maybe a different word would more accurately describe the warmth and the sense of security that spread in Draco's chest during the whole process.
Without a word, Draco made himself comfortable. He changed his pants, brushed his teeth, and washed his face, deliberately ignoring the rude and obnoxious way in which Potter was staring. The silence lasted long enough, and he thought he was going to make it to bed without exchanging a word, but when he was ready to hide behind the green canopy, Potter spoke.
Oh, true. Ron and Hermione. Outside. They were outside. Outside of Hogwarts. In the gardens.
"I- I don't remember. Three? Four?"
came back to his head. Maybe this was not about the insults. After all, the insults were normal. Maybe this was about that other thing. Maybe it had not been his imagination.
"A proposal," repeated Malfoy, which made Harry's skin itch everywhere.
"I want to sleep, Potter. You can go somewhere else if you need the light."
Hermione was not convinced. She did not want to believe it, but the pieces fitted very well indeed. Harry had been mourning for Sirius all summer, but the moment he'd seen Malfoy, he had kind of come to life. He'd forced them to follow the blonde all the way into Knockturn Alley, obsessing over the theory that he was a Death Eater. And then in the train, he'd actually confronted him. And then again before they got detention together in their new room. And he'd been so mad when he discovered that Malfoy had dropped Quidditch. And from the moment they had started sharing a room, Harry had been completely distracted, and he also seemed to be sleeping less and skipping more meals, saying he would eat in the bedroom. Jesus Christ. It all made sense.
