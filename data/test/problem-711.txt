“Oh Merlin. Draco, it’s okay. Hermione is here, she’s better at healing spells than I am. She’s going to heal you and then we’re going to walk to the Hospital Wing, alright?”
Draco’s brows furrowed. “How did I get nerve damage?”
“I literally can’t do magic unless a Professor unlocks this.” He held up his wrist. “You can ask the many people that attack me in the hallways; I can’t fight back.”
Harry looked at him for a moment more and stood to finish putting on his robes. “I think you had a panic attack. You should see Madame Pomfrey when you get a chance.”
As always, all comments are appreciated so so much. I love you guys!
He tried not to see his peers before him as threats, but they could literally do anything they wanted to him.
Draco let out a huge sigh once Smith was out of sight. “The whole castle’s going to know tomorrow, aren’t they?”
“A Time-Turner,” Narcissa said, and everyone in the courtroom gasped as they realized the implications. Draco swallowed.
Harry gave a small smile. “Of course.” Draco let out a huge sigh of relief. “But no funny business,” Harry joked as he climbed next to Draco. With a flick of his wand, Harry turned the lights off, and lightly touched Draco’s hand under the covers. Draco was glad that it was dark and Harry couldn’t see how much he was blushing.
. Draco was filled with regret—what would happen to him now? What would happen to his mother?
“Where’re you off to?” Harry asked.
“No it’s not!” Harry was adamant. “The prophecy mentioned me. If I didn’t exist, or if people hadn’t worked so hard to keep me alive, so many would still be here. I’ve worked long and hard these past few months to realize that even though I may have set some events in motion, even though I was a catalyst, they aren’t my fault.”
Harry nodded. “Not...yet. But maybe. Thank you, for doing that. I always wondered...”
Draco didn’t scream as he woke up from that dream, which wasn’t quite a nightmare but was drifting ever close to being one. His pillow was wet from tears that he had shed as an eleven year old. He sat up at looked at the clock: it was a quarter past three. Harry was sleeping soundly in his own bed, while Draco’s was cold on one side.
“Harry—I—I’m so sorry. You should have just let me go, why didn’t you just let me go? You could’ve—“ he then saw Neville and Hermione right behind Potter. He was nearly in tears “You all could’ve—“
—but Draco really needed a win.
The train ride back to Hogwarts was spent mostly in silence, with Harry putting his head on Draco’s shoulder and closing his eyes. Though they didn’t agree that this was an official first date, Draco felt happier than ever at the prospect that dating Potter was one door, at least, that was still open.
. He remembered the presence of his crush beside him. Certainly any plan that involved resurrecting the Dark Lord also involved harming Harry. Draco also realized how little he knew about the current situation. Was Theodore Nott Sr. in Ministry custody? What had happened to Draco’s old classmate, Theo? He all of a sudden wished that he had not burned the letter he had received from the younger Nott.
“Hey!” Draco had been quite numb during the entire walk over, but seeing how Harry’s face lit up when he entered the room brought forth all of his emotions. He was angry, scared, and thrilled at the same time.
“Potter, you cannot tell anyone what happened. I’m serious.” Draco’s tone wasn’t so much angry, but pleading.
“Thank you, mother,” Draco replied. He cleared his throat. “I actually may go to Blaise’s house early next week. For dinner.” This was Draco’s backup plan, his way to get to the Weasley’s if he could possibly avoid broaching the subject with his parents.
The walk back to the castle made Draco’s legs quiver with each step. He jumped every time a tree branch shook. So many questions spun through his mind. Did anyone know about the resurrected Dumbledore’s Army? Did Professor McGonagall know, and that’s why the thestrals weren’t there to take Draco up to the castle? And, perhaps most importantly, why in the world was Draco sent the missing Time Tuner? Who sent it?
Draco and Harry try to end their first outing on a pleasant note—but end up running into someone unexpected
“I’m sorry.”
Draco looked up at Harry, startled. “Have
“Well I don’t want to...take advantage of that! But I was just wondering, how did things end up with you and Parkinson?”
“I think he just wants to exist,” Draco said almost automatically. Lucius turned his head sharply, but didn’t speak. “He talks in these mandatory group things we have to do about how he just wants to be left alone. I don’t think he’s after anything other than a normal life.”
“What’s got you all in a huff lately? I feel like you haven’t been yourself for the past week.”
“I didn’t even ask, though. Are you scared?”
Professor McGonagall’s words echoed in his head later that night as he lay next to Harry. He kept going back and forth from being terrified at the power that Dumbledore’s Army had over him to almost laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. They were all students, they should finally be worrying about their exams and their future. He didn’t understand why they couldn’t put all this behind him.
“As some of you know, St. Mungo’s has started to put more of an emphasis on mental health. They’re partnering with Muggle-Born wizards to train mind healers, since the Muggles are far ahead of wizards on this sort of research.” Blaise rolled his eyes beside Draco. “Some of us already see these healers. I do.”
Draco took a deep breath. “Look,” he said. “For once in my life, I’m going to be honest. I’ve had a shite few years, and I’ve been a shite person nearly all my life. I spent years tormenting most of you, especially you and your family, Weasley. I was arrogant and I thought that being a pureblood made me better than anyone else. It was wrong. I shouldn’t have realized all this was wrong just because of what I went through, but that’s what got me thinking.
“So that takes care of that,” Neville took over again. “Next on the agenda is dividing into groups to present project ideas by the holidays. In December we’ll hear presentations and vote as a group on which elements of which projects we want to incorporate into our final memorial. We’re going to let you guys pick groups as long as you have at least three different houses represented in your group. Everyone divide up, introduce yourselves, and discuss some preliminary ideas. We’ll work until lunch, and then everyone has the rest of the day to relax before our term starts tomorrow.”
Draco managed a small smile. “What time is it anyway?” He wanted to change the subject since he wasn’t able to quite believe what Harry was saying.
“Sorry,” Granger spoke from the kitchenette.  “I feel like I always startle you.”
wanted to do this. Always. I mean, not in a weird way, but...you have no idea how amazing you are. I want to feel as connected with you in real life as I do in my head. I want to wake up next to you every morning and tell you how much I love you, and then I want to tell my friends how much I love you, and then the whole school. I want to tell them that yes, you’re the Boy Who Lived, but you are so much more, you’d be my boyfriend, you’d be my best friend, you’d—“ Draco paused to dry heave over the bed. He was crying now and he didn’t know why. He kept rambling compliments at Harry as his roommate patted his back.
That night Draco told Harry he was going to lie down rather than go to dinner. In reality, he spent the time in his room desperately trying to produce a corpeal Patronus. He was certainly better than when he had started, but his progress had plateaued. He always stood for a moment before casting the spell, practicing breathing techniques that his therapist, Christine, had taught him, and picturing his chosen happy memory fully in his mind. Then he pointed his wand, knowing he did the hand motion perfectly, and shouted “
“You—what? Why?”
Pushing open the creaky door, Draco stepped into the sketchy pub. It was mostly empty, and the bartender looked very uninterested by his presence. A few dark hooded figures sat skulking in corners, and Draco shuddered at the resemblance to those who frequented his house during the Dark Lord’s rule.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco gave his mother a kiss on the cheek and then began to climb the stairs somewhat shakily. Not only did he have his father to think about seeing tomorrow, but the prospect of seeing Pansy and her family in a month was terrifying. Pansy Parkinson had been his oldest friend. They had met when they were babies, and because of their close birth dates, their parents thought that a marriage was destined in the stars for them. The two of them excited their families even further when they attended the Yule Ball together in their fourth year.

“It’s no trouble.” He looked up straight into the eyes of Mr. Burke, holding his beret. The Malfoy family lawyer’s expression changed from politeness to wariness. “Wait...” he said, no doubt recognizing Draco’s eyes.
“Okay. I understand,” Draco said. “But I don’t want you to worry about me so much that it upsets you. My family is really important to me, and I take risks for them when it’s necessary.”
Also, as usual, please comment and let me know if there’s anything you want to see! Sorry to leave you on a cliffhanger again. Next chapter out hopefully Tuesday. Love you guys!
“When do you think they’ll have their retrial?”
The first in his memory was the week before he was going to get the Dark Mark. He had made his decision that he was going to become a Death Eater to save his family. That had felt like the hard part—he had hoped it would have been the hard part. But the week of waiting was nearly worse. His house was overrun with criminal visitors, the hallways were adorned with hush whispers about his safety and sacrifice. His Aunt Bella praised him enormously while his mother lost her temper more than Draco had ever seen, even kicking one of the house elves once. Draco was almost relieved when the day finally came for him to be Marked, though he shouldn’t have been. He couldn’t sleep the night beforehand due to anticipation, and he couldn’t sleep the night afterward due to the pain.
Harry swallowed, like he wanted to say something else to Draco. He seemed to decide against it. “Well, shall I teach you some spell work while we wait, then? We still have to work on our Defense Against the Dark Arts project, too.”
Draco was thankfully that Harry couldn’t see him at that moment. He took off his jacket, feeling warm from blushing.
Normally he could afford to lounge in bed for a little while—well, all day really. There was nothing for him to do this summer and barely anyone to converse with once the lawyers stopped coming around. The first month of the summer was filled with back-and-forth. First, it was thought that the Malfoys were certainly going to Azkaban within a week after the Battle, and they were only placed on house arrest until the paperwork could be settled. At that time, Draco felt a small sense of satisfaction, and in a way, protection. The world was being righted again—justice could still be served. He was so unburdened by this realization that he didn’t even care if order being restored meant his end.
“Hey,” Harry said, smiling at Draco. Though Draco still felt like he was on the verge of a panic attack, he couldn’t help but smile back. When he sat down, he made sure to touch his leg to Harry’s under the table.
“Isn’t that the point of this whole year, though? To right our wrongs?”
“Are you just going to stand there gaping all day like you’re some sort of a stranger? Come in, son,” his father bellowed from inside. He was leaning on his cane heavily—whereas before it was more of a display of wealth and provided security from revealing an old Quidditch injury, Lucius appeared to actually need the cane now.
didn’t notice.” Draco’s heart fell—so he did know. “Why would you do something like that? Why would you completely disregard my advice and put your entire family in danger?”
Draco decided to leave—no one would miss him. He got up just as Daphne was invited to join Granger’s group and Greg was invited to join Longbottom’s. He refilled his coffee cup and started to sneak back to his room.
“EVERYONE SHUT UP,” Potter yelled. “Alright, that’s it.” He grabbed a basket containing blankets from the ground and dumped its contents on the couch. “Wands in here. We can’t keep threatening each other.” Everyone looked very hesitant. “Come on, I’ll go first.” Potter dropped his wand into the basket and the Gryffindors soon followed. After a few moments, the rest of the students put their wands in the basket. Draco had no qualms about giving up his wand—it was useless to him as long as the manacle was on his wrist anyway.
Harry put his hand on Draco’s left arm, which tingled where his scar remained from the Mark. He gripped it tightly and spoke in an even tone. “Don’t go there, Malfoy. Don’t.” Draco was confused at his sudden disappointment when Potter used his last name. “Look, I’m sorry for snooping, but I thought you were up to something since you were acting so weird. And, well...” he trailed off. Both men looked at their feet for a long time.
“Mr. Potter, calm down. We will just ask him a few questions, and then release him back to your school unharmed. I’ll have my colleague accompany you and your friends back to Hogwarts, where we will meet with Professor McGonagall to tell her what has happened.”
“I’ll have a Healer come and make sure that your head is alright.” The man looked to be in his thirties yet wore an aged expression. Draco didn’t recognize him from any of his trials, but he hadn’t been paying that close attention to the prosecutors anyway. The man’s office was small, but warm and quiet. Red carpet softened the floor under Draco’s feet, and the chair had a nice, plump cushion. Draco’s heart was still beating fast from the attack—and he had so many questions. However, he had learned to keep silent in these sort of situations.
“Potter.” Draco pulled Harry’s eyes to his with a serious tone. “You’re a prick.”
“Well?” Ginny asked. “What have you decided?”
!” Draco felt a sharp pain and then relief. He still had no idea what was happening.
“You know exactly what he was going to say. This is why something like that would never work, Hermione. You’re a better person than all of us for wanting to try, but look: they haven’t learned a thing. I was naive to think otherwise.” Harry put down his fork and walked out of the Great Hall. Hermione looked as though she were going to follow him, but Neville put his hand on her shoulder, whispering to her.
A Hufflepuff raised his hand. “Yes, Justin?” Hermione didn’t look as though she anticipated her presentation would get interrupted.
“No you’re not,” Greg saw right through him. “You’re going to keep them to punish yourself. Give them to me.”
“Great guess,” Harry said wryly. “Yes, we’re going to be using it to get out of Hogwarts.”
? All of a sudden everything came flooding back to Draco in a whirlwind. Seeing his mother in Azkaban, the way his father’s glare pierced every part of him...Draco’s hand trembled as he took the mug from Madame Pomfrey. “What time is it?”
“I’m not convinced,” Draco stood up and went to the sink, splashing water on his red face.
Harry, instead of recoiling in horror that a Death Eater was touching him, actually squeezed his hands. “Of course I can.”
“I’m going to miss you. So much,” Harry started, taking Draco’s hand in his.
“Because it seemed to me like you’re always awfully upset about it. When someone does a bad thing and they aren’t upset about it, that’s when they don’t deserve forgiveness. Like the boy who killed me.” Suddenly the door slammed open and with a squeal Myrtle returned to her toilet.
“I’m going to finish some paperwork and prepare for Lucius’s trial this afternoon. I will likely see you this evening at your residence.” Mr. Burke stood and took his leave.
Potter looked away, giving Draco some privacy to deal with this realization. “Yeah, mate. You went down pretty hard—thankfully we were close to the ground anyway. You didn’t black out but you were having some kind of flashback. No one could get through to you for about twenty minutes.”
“Oh you know how she is,” Narcissa waved her hand dismissively. “She’s probably in Italy with her fourteenth husband. How she’s managed to get away with...all that, I don’t know.” Blaise’s mother was notorious for murdering her husbands after barely a year. Blaise’s father had been dead for some time, with his mother inheriting the fortune and the name. “Enough about me though, darling. How about you? Are you friends with the other Slytherins?”
Professor McGonagall looked at him strangely, and for a moment Draco was terrified that she would refuse him. “Of course,” she stated. She spoke the password and he followed her up to her office. He gulped as he climbed the steps around the gargoyle. He remembered how much he hated visiting the Headmaster’s office. The last two occupants of the place haunted his dreams regularly, for very different reasons each.
“What did you say to this request?”
Draco swept his hand across the empty common room. “I know you’re practically blind, but do you see a soul that is cooped up here instead of enjoying the season? I don’t. We’re going, and that’s final.”
“To see if our son was alright!”
It’s time for Draco and Harry to present their Defense Against the Dark Arts project. Also, Draco revisits a memory.
Draco deals with the aftermath of his Azkaban visit and has a terrible nightmare
“Calm down,” Harry stood up as well, putting his hand on Justin’s arm, which was quickly wrenched away. “This is exactly what Hermione is talking about—our chance to heal. This would be a great thing to discuss at the group—“
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was silent for a few minutes, and he itched his left arm. “I’m sorry for not writing you this summer. I should have at least done that,” he finally said.
“I’m just—“ Draco sighed. “Do you read the
Draco visits his father in the hospital. His return to Hogwarts brings about an unpleasant surprise and revelation.
Draco was somewhat hoping that Harry would share his bed that evening, since the date had gone objectively well. However, after planting a small kiss on Draco’s cheek, Harry crushed that particular dream. “I really want to take this slow,” he said. “Because I think it could be something special. All my relationships burned really brightly and then died out immediately. I don’t want that to happen with us. Is that okay?”
He had drawn enough attention to himself for a lifetime. It was odd to try and be inconspicuous after years of trying to gain as much attention and prowess as he could. He wasn’t very good at it, either.
“What, so one little thing goes wrong and you immediately get pissed out of your mind?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well...” Draco felt awkward. He knew that Harry, Blaise, Daphne, and Greg were certainly his friends, so their sacrifice at least made sense. But why were Granger and Longbottom agreeing to do this, after all Draco had done to them? What did they expect in return? “Thank you all. I owe you all...something.”
Draco was too stunned by this show of emotion to do anything but nod.
Before she could finish that thought, the Sorting Hat was placed on the podium and began its song. It was not nearly as depressing as last years’, which Professor Snape actually cut short due to its message being about uniting against the Dark Lord. At the time, Draco had told himself it was very silly to worry for the safety of a hat, but the look on his favorite teacher’s face had made his stomach turn. Apparently he had nothing to fear, though, for the Hat was alive and well. And—talkative. Draco zoned out for most of its song, and the sorting that followed. He did notice that the few first-years who got Slytherin as their house looked crest-fallen, and Draco felt a pang of sympathy during the minimal applause.
“How did that work out for you?” The wizard who was a constant interruption jeered. Others made outbursts about the selfishness of the Malfoy family.
Immediately her wand was back up. “What are you on about, Malfoy? Is this some kind of a trick?”
“What are you on about?” Potter didn’t look angry, just confused.
Finally, Ron put down his drink and gave a happy sigh. “I should be going now. But it was really nice to see you, Harry. I should be around soon to see Hermione, but feel free to come by the Burrow anytime. Malfoy, good to know that you’re not as big of a nuisance as you used to be. I hope that continues.” Ron gave Harry a hug and shook Draco’s hand.
Or maybe Draco should aim a little lower for their first date. Perhaps he could take Harry on a picnic in the Malfoy Gardens? There were peacocks and swans, and it was possible that the lake would be frozen over—maybe they could go ice skating? Draco wondered if he would even have access to the Manor, or if it was still continuously being searched in anticipation of the trial. Besides, would Harry even want to visit a place so dark?
“Need to be drunk to spend time with us, Malfoy?” Neville said teasingly.
Draco turned and open the door to Professor McGonagall’s office, coming face to face with Potter who had raised a hand to knock. Potter’s expression changed from one of anger to one of concern. “Draco! Are you alright?”
“I fancy a stroll,” Draco tried to say nonchalantly. “Christine told me it would be a good idea to do before bed.”
“Malfoy, I wanted to say that I really respect what you said the other day. I’m not sure I can forgive you fully, but I accept your apology. I know that it was real, and I know you’ve tried hard to change this year.” Longbottom extended a hand, which Draco took hesitantly but with a firm grip, like Lucius had always taught him.
Harry glared at Dolohov and tightened his grip on his wand. “And if I don’t?”
“No thanks.” Draco was far too nervous to eat breakfast. Even without the impending doom of a possible first-date, he usually only had the stamina to eat one meal a day.
. Anger he understood. He wanted his body mangled, wanted it to reflect how he felt inside. Fighting would be a good opportunity to release some of his energy that bounced back and forth in his mind, unable to escape. Most disgusting was the fact that Draco wasn’t even quite sure what the Hufflepuff’s sister looked like. He tortured many Muggle-born students, and made a point of trying not to look at his victims. In order to cast the Cruciatus curse, Draco had to feel hatred in his heart, which he found impossible to do while gawking at crying kids. His hatred for the Dark Lord propelled him through the task, but he also had to be careful to protect his mind while doing it. It was not easy, and he would often return to the Slytherin dormitory to vomit and then immediately collapse into bed.
Draco nodded. “I—“ his heart rate was starting to increase and his breathing turned to hyperventilating. He felt Potter hesitantly place a hand on his back. Draco flinched at first, but Harry started to make small circles with his palm and Draco eased into the touch.
“I have something to give you. Before you go.” Draco smirked. “No, nothing like that,” Harry objected, blushing again. Draco loved messing with him in that way. Someday those jokes would actually mean something, and he couldn’t wait for that. Harry pulled something out from beneath his desk. It looked like two very old, bound journals.
“I appreciate you sharing your story, Dean, but Professor McGonagall wants us to focus on ourselves when we tell people things.” Neville looked uncomfortable but firm.
Draco spends his first day with the Weasleys, and learns that even more company will be arriving.
Like a revolving door, Blaise entered the room without knocking as soon as Harry left.
Draco looked at Harry, shocked. “That’s preposter—“
“Actually, I’m really sorry, I’m being rude. Did you...did you want to talk about what happened, at all?”
“Dumbledore’s Army...” Draco mused in his old sarcastic tone. He shifted uncomfortably in the chair, sort of wondering why they didn’t bother to tie him up.
“Do you really think they wouldn’t have found a way to do that anyway? I don’t want to drag your confidence, but I’m sure Voldemort had backup plans.” Harry shook his head. “No, the only things you need to apologize for are things that you’ve said. The purist things. That, you should apologize for and do whatever you can to make up for it. But things that happened to them when the Carrows were here, or things that happened to their family during the final battle—it’s no more your fault than it is mine.”
“Do—do you remember them at all?”
her, she’s strong, she’s funny...I just don’t want to be with her. And I don’t know why. Did you—“ Potter abruptly cut off the beginning of his question in favor of looking down at his feet. “Nevermind.”
“Hi Draco,” Daphne Greengrass said quietly. She was sitting next to Greg and across from Blaise and Draco. Blaise did not look unhappy to see Draco, but raised his eyebrows in surprise. Greg looked down at his feet.
Draco was exhausted after actually eating three meals in a day and desperate for some peace and quiet. However, the shared space was bustling with happy chatter and clinking glasses. Some students quieted down and stared when the Slytherins entered.
“Alright,” Harry sat down with a sigh. “I guess I’m ready.”
“We were talking about this the other day,” Daphne chimed in. “I know it wasn’t ever the four of us that were close, but we don’t have much of a choice now. If we can’t be honest with each other about this stuff, we’re all going to explode before the end of the year.” Greg and Draco nodded, then the three turned to Blaise. He was generally the most guarded of them all, and the quickest to judge those who showed weakness.
That unleashed something inside Draco. Enraged, he stood up and went to leave the compartment. He felt like he needed air, or to vomit, or to yell at those first years more. He wasn’t sure what he wanted, but he couldn’t stay here.
Draco waited a few moments to speak, knowing that he would regret his decision to be vulnerable, especially after causing this much of a scene. But it was nearing midnight and somehow he felt safe in the open, under the stars, and with Potter. “I was so angry with you. For not being my friend in first year. No one had ever done that before, and I kept wondering what Weasley of all people had that I didn’t.”
After all the chaos on Saturday, Draco couldn’t bear to get out of bed much on Sunday. His friends brought him food and tried to reassure him, but he didn’t have much of an appetite for either food or comfort. Harry gave him space during the day, but at night tried to engage in conversation. Draco was polite enough, but couldn’t bear to talk about anything serious. Part of him was just plain exhausted—he spent nearly the past three months in bed not speaking to anyone, so it had been quite an eventful week. The other part of him knew that he would have to save all his energy for this session today. His original plan was to refuse to speak to the Mind Healer, but now that he knew his probation was hanging on a thread, he would have to try and participate at least a little.
“You shouldn’t say that anymore, Blaise,” Daphne lowered her voice. “We could get in trouble.”
“Welcome eighth-years! It’s so good to see you all. I’ve been told that you all are rooming in pairs—please sit with your roommate and we can get started.”
Harry raised his eyes and nodded with a laugh. “Are you nervous, Malfoy?”
“Forget about the Malfoy line, I’m talking about you! You’re studious, you’re fun to be around, you’re a good listener. You have just enough sarcasm to keep things interesting. Your kid would be sassy for sure, but you’ll definitely be a good father someday.”
“What?”
That wasn’t what Draco was concerned about. He spat one more time and then spun to grab Potter’s arm. “Potter, my...my arm burned. Something’s wrong, I think—“
“Weren’t your parents the one who made you do bad things in the first place?” Myrtle crooned from beside him. He was now sitting below the sink, knees drawn up to his chest. Most of the time he felt much older than eighteen, but right now he felt very small. He nodded, touching his forehead to his knees. “Then you shouldn’t worry about what they think. You should be happy. If I had lived, I wouldn’t have listened to my parents.”
“Maybe he likes you,” Blaise drawled. “He did just break up with the Weaslette.”
Draco ran shaking hands through his hair. The clock said it was five thirty—it wasn’t even time to wake up yet.
“It doesn’t matter if you had used a Polyjuice Potion, Draco, that’s not the point!” Mr. Burke boomed, putting a fist on the desk. “First, you refuse to pay a visit to your father in Azkaban. Then, you go off galavanting in Diagon Alley, somewhere even unrestricted students aren’t even allowed to be, and to top it all off, you were with Harry Potter of all individuals! What if you had done something to upset him? What if you had been seen with him? Do you have any idea how careless you were being?”
“Bet that’s the first time you’ve ever returned from home thinking that,” Harry said jokingly but also with a tentatively questioning tone while he traced circles on Draco’s back.
“Well, I didn’t even want to start it. It was Hermione’s idea. So much of what I’ve done has been through the help of other people, or just luck.”
He walked over to the empty bar. “Two shots of Firewhiskey, please. And keep them coming.” Draco slapped a few coins on the bar and the keep got to work. Draco ran his hands through his hair.
Chapter 5
“5798.” The wizard retrieved the application, then stamped it. After Yarney signed some paperwork, the wizard handed him two cloaks.
“They are fine,” Yarney glanced down at a piece of parchment, likely some sort of a communication device. “The Malfoy Manor is currently being searched along with the homes of every other former Death Eater.”
Mr. Burke stood up heavily. “My clients plead not guilty, Madam.” Beside him, Narcissa looked firmly at the crowd, but not one particular person, while Lucius’s eyes darted around in a paranoid manner.
Harry’s hand hesitated from its spot on Draco’s cheek, but he continued to stroke it with his thumb while he spoke. “Dray—I’ve never...I’ve never even with a woman, I—“
“I don’t know. Forget it,” Draco said, feeling quite angry and showing it.
, he tried to say, but nothing came out.
“Draco,” Harry said sympathetically. “I truly don’t want anything to happen to you. To any more students at this school,” he said quickly after the first sentence.
“Why? Did the Muggles go on vacation?”
“Well, it doesn’t bother me that much, but if your goal isn’t to be seen by anyone, I’m not sure if that’ll happen. This is almost more public than Hogsmeade, and we didn’t bring disguises or anything...”
Draco kept his eyes on the ground. He knew that one of the Weasley twins had been killed in the battle, and he also knew that he had mercilessly teased the Weasleys for years. He couldn’t bear to meet Ron’s eyes.
“I always wondered if being an orphan made you deficient in some way, and clearly it did since you never had parents around to teach you manners—“
Draco gave a dry laugh. “Deal.”
Draco felt more alive than ever, and as his friends and his boyfriend enjoyed the last few days before the winter holiday, he knew he had to hold onto this feeling. When it was time to face his family, Draco would need to remember what he was fighting for.
“Great. Goodnight.” Normally the two boys would chat a bit more, but Draco wanted some space to calm his racing heart. For the first time in a while, he went to sleep with something to look forward to.
Draco did not wait for Professor McGonagall to return—no doubt she thought the meeting would take longer than the five minutes that Draco spent being scolded. Instead, he walked out of her office numbly, nearly stumbling down the gargoyle steps. What had just happened? Had he really been shut out of his parents’ trial, just because he wanted to enjoy his life?
“Great. Noon tomorrow alright?”
“I’ve tried to learn Occlumency before. I’m telling you, it’s not going to work.” They were sitting in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, nestling in a corner with silencing spells blocking out the noise from the other working pairs. It was finally time to start teaching each other the skills they chose to specialize in, and Draco had begged Potter to go first. He wasn’t looking forward to facing the humiliation of not being able to cast a Patronus.
better. And that’s what counts. Even Ginny has noticed. Yeah, she may never forgive you, but she doesn’t hate you, Draco. If more people knew you and took the time to listen to you, they would realize that you truly are a better person. And I’m proud of you for that.” Harry squeezed Draco’s fingertips and he couldn’t help but give a wince at the dull ache that increased suddenly. “Now, we should get you to the Hospital Wing.”
“That’s not my concern right now. My concern is that you seem to be perpetuating a cover-up. Did you really think that Potter, of all people, would want to cover for you or your family? Did you really think you’d be able to befriend the Savior of the Wizarding World?”
Kingsley stood, ready to leave. “It depends on if he’s willing to help himself. Should he turn himself in, we may be in a position to offer amnesty in exchange for information on his father. It will be different if we capture him while still performing criminal activity.”
or something. I don’t think I’m going to be able to do this in the next three weeks.”
The hallways were quiet as most everyone else was in classes or studying. Draco decided to go back to his room to look at the application in peace. He unfolded the sheet of paper as he sat at his desk.  The application included some basic information, and then a spot to request individual visits with prisoners. He would have to see his mother and father separately.

“I don’t have an illness, I went to Madame Pomfrey.”
“Not necessarily, although it couldn’t hurt.” Harry started laughing, a deep sound from his belly. “I’m serious! Try it next time you’re there. Try just being nice to it, or thanking it when it does something right. Let it know that any bad things that happened in the house, or things that you’re mad about, were not the fault of the house itself. Accept the house as a home.”
Draco’s head snapped up. He slowly took the wand from Potter’s outstretched hand, brushing his fingers up against Harry’s, and feeling something inside of him tingle.
“Well, not exactly, but he is on probation and his parents are here today—“
. There was also the tea shop but that was much too...obvious. “Sure, sounds great,” Draco said nervously.
“We’re all adults now. Theo needs to make his own decisions,” Blaise added, doubling down on his opinion. “I doubt it’s your fault. Even if it were a tiny bit your fault, trying to fix that mess would undo a lot of the work you’ve done here.”
“No, I’m just...going to throw them away.” In truth, Draco planned to keep the letters in his drawer, lest he ever forgot who he really was.
Draco looked up at the ceiling, now with a firm resolve. “You’re right. This is my decision, and I’ve made it.” He pulled Harry in more closely for another kiss.
“Absolutely not!” Draco responded, exaggerating his aghast. “I’m a guest in this home, and I’m running out of other places to possibly go. A scandal within the Weasley family is the last thing I need.” He sat on the edge of the bed.
“I just don’t know which I’d want to do. How would I? I’ve never been with anyone,” Harry said, stressed. “I mean, do you know which you’d want?”
“How can you say that to him?” Hermione was furious. “He just saved your life and you’re being rude to him!”
“It definitely didn’t go how I expected it to,” Harry said.
Draco made it through the rest of the week with a new resolve to follow Mr. Burke’s instructions as much as possible, for his mother’s sake. At first he tried not to arouse suspicion by completely ignoring Daphne, Blaise, and Greg. Rather, he attempted a slow break. He feigned tiredness or having to do a lot of homework at most meal times. This did not bode well for his checkup with Madame Pomfrey at the end of the week. She was very displeased that he had lost weight once again, and forced more nutrition potions down his throat.
“Over the next year, I was tasked with killing Professor Dumbledore and finding a way to let the Death Eaters in the castle. I was careless because I was only thinking about myself and the best way to do this task without getting myself or my family in trouble. It nearly killed Ron Weasley and Katie Bell. I did let Death Eaters into the castle through the Vanishing Cabinet, so you all had to fight and some of you got hurt. When the time came, I didn’t kill Dumbledore, but only because Professor Snape stepped in. I was hesitating, but I think I would have done it, if nothing else happened. I did everything to save my family, but even that was a selfish act. I wasn’t thinking about any of your families.
Draco shuddered. “Yeah that wasn’t pleasant. My human thoughts went away, so I really had no clue what was happening. That’s one of the only times I was grateful for Professor McGonagall.”
Draco took slight offense at Harry’s joking tone. “Fine. I will.” He turned on his side to face away from Harry.
As usual, the Ministry was a hustle and bustle of loud noises. People were flitting from one place to another, some with cameras and most with briefcases. Draco saw the Prophet in dozens of hands, with his parents’ mugshots on the front cover. He pushed his crush on Harry out of his mind and remembered why they were there. Seeing the others looking a little lost, he pointed them in the right direction. “Alright, the Minister’s office is up the elevator and—“
“It never hurts to be careful. Now come with us.”
“What’s the matter with him?”
Kingsley asked the next question. “Do you know the current location of the Time Turner?”
Potter to be proud of him, he wanted it so deeply that he was not going to focus on anything else.
“I just really have no reason to be this anxious. This is probably the happiest I’ve ever been! I have good friends, I’m doing well in school, I have you—I’m being stupid.”
“Yes.”
“I’ll explain it to you some other time. Oh, also,” Harry walked over to his side of the room. “I do have this.” He rummaged through his trunk and held out Draco’s old wand. “I should have given it to you sometime this summer, I’m sorry.”
Draco wasn’t sure when his parents’ trial started, but the sooner they got to the Ministry of Magic, the better. They could definitely kill time there anyway. Draco was wearing another subtle disguise, this time different color glasses frames and a boulder hat much like the ones that Cornelius Fudge used to wear. It certainly wouldn’t stop from people recognizing him if they took a good look, but it would potentially stop jeers from afar.
Draco is forced to practice self-care. Also, could Potter just leave him alone?
The second was the week before the Death Eaters were planning to invade Hogwarts grounds, in his sixth year. He was still in bed at the hospital wing, spending his time staring at the ceiling. Strangely enough, he had absolutely nothing to do. He had given up on homework long beforehand. His only focus had been fixing the Vanishing cabinet. Now that he was done, he just had to wait to face the consequences.
“I just...I truly thought my disguise was enough. I was being careful.”
Draco stopped straightening his robes—he actually had forgotten for a moment that his mother wasn’t lounging at Malfoy Manor and was rather locked in a cell in Azkaban. “Right.”
“Happy to see me, are we?” Harry said joyfully.
All of a sudden he heard some sharp cracks as people materialized from the air. Spells immediately flew back and forth, with Dolohov’s apparent accomplices flying out from the Three Broomsticks, fighting the Aurors who Apparated into the village. Hermione and Neville burst out also, helping the Aurors fight the three Death Eaters.
“I know exactly what you’re hiding. I know your secret, Draco.”
“What do you mean what’s the matter?”
“Wait, sir, please—“ but Mr. Burke was already gone in a flash of green light.
“I’m fine, Mother, please don’t worry about me. I was actually preparing to write you a letter last weekend about what I’ve been up to, but...”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked with concern.
“Well,” the pale man said hoarsely. “Finally decided to show your face, eh?” Lucius Malfoy looked moderately better than he had when Draco last saw him. His face had filled out, and he no longer looked like he had two black eyes. But he still had a glassy expression, and his fists were clenched at the end of his trembling arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Was anything else missing?” Another wizard spoke up. “Was anything disturbed?”
partner.” He said this latter part with malice toward himself.
“Fine,” Draco repeated.
Draco finds out just how difficult a life can be without magic.
Narcissa hesitated this time. “My husband and I were approached by Nott in mid-September.” Draco let out a small gasp, but Harry squeezed his leg somewhat painfully as a reminder that they were not to be seen or heard. Thankfully other murmurs drowned out the sound.
“Please elaborate.”
Their last stop was Zonko’s Joke Shop. Draco had never set foot in there—his father wouldn’t want him frequenting shops of nonsense. As soon as he and Harry stepped into the shop, greeted by a variety of noisy toys, he knew it was a bad idea.
“Pansy? We were never together.”
“Well, they’re not gone. But they do happen a lot less often, and when they do, I can wake up, think about it for a bit, and then go back to bed pretty easily. If you don’t want to go see a Mind Healer that’s fine, but you should talk to someone about the nightmares.” Draco was silent. He wasn’t sure he had anyone to talk to. “If you don’t have anyone, you can talk to me.”
Draco got up to pour himself a cup of coffee. Behind him, voices hushed as Granger got their attention.
“But you two are dating.” It was a statement, not a question. But there was no malice behind it. Draco didn’t think the reason for Ginny doing this was jealousy.
“Therapists, like Mind Healers for Muggles.”
“Oh, this is the most clearly I’ve thought in years. All the hard work I concentrated into putting the Malfoys back to prestige in the Wizarding World, torn away in one second by you. Tell me, Draco, what exactly were you and Potter doing on that bench in Hogsmeade when Dolohov discovered you? I’ve always known you weren’t going to be a proper husband to any woman, but I never thought you would choose a companion deliberately to stain the family name.”
There was only one incident in which Potter pushed the situation further. To Draco’s horror, Potter sat on his bed. Draco kept writing, trying to ignore him. “Is this about the Patronus situation?” Draco stopped scribbling and clenched his fist in anger. “You’ll get it, Draco, I promise. And tell you what—if you still can’t do it after a few weeks, I’ll switch to something else that we can do in front of the class. I’m not out to get you or anything—“
Narcissa’s frown turned slowly into a tentative smile. “Of course, dear. Why don’t you go upstairs and get some rest? Not too much, though, the Ministry official is coming to escort us to St. Mungo’s at nine.”
But it also wasn’t Draco’s fault that she was locked in the dungeon.
(See the end of the chapter for
“—I could have sworn that something was wrong, especially when I got the letter that my dad’s sentence was extended—“
Draco considered the idea of just telling Harry that he was being blackmailed. But then he thought about how Harry clenched his fist when potions accidentally exploded in class, or the way his shoulders tensed every time someone approached him in the Hogwarts hallways—which was nearly all the time. Ginny Weasley was right to some extent—Harry needed to relax. This wouldn’t be the way to help him do that. Draco had to solve this problem on his own.
Blaise let out a low whistle behind Draco. “Wow. That’s...interesting. Hey, at least you get the big room, right?” Blaise put his hand on Draco’s shoulder and Draco flinched out of reflex. Over the past two years, a hand on a shoulder was never a good thing. His father would do it when he wanted to coax Draco. Aunt Bellatrix would place her hand on his shoulder and rub it as praise after he tortured someone. The Dark Lord would place his cold fingers on Draco’s shoulder when he wanted Draco to move aside, usually after Draco tortured the individual enough so they gave proper information and it was time for them to be killed.
After showering with the coldest possible water, Draco walked into the common room shivering. Plopping his school bag down on the nearest couch, he jumped at the unexpected sight of Greg sitting by the fire.
The quarters really were quite nice. The side of the room that was clearly Potter’s was red, and in addition to the four-poster bed and wardrobe had a desk and an armchair that sat near the window overlooking the grounds. Draco got an equally large portion of the room which had a fluffy green rug and similar furniture. His trunk was waiting for him at the end of his bed.
“Hermione, does he really need the potion? Won’t his body replenish the blood on its own?”
That got a smile out of Harry. “That’s true, I suppose. Just don’t let it affect you, okay?”
“But what if it’s partially my fault he’s in this boat? What if it’s because of my parents, or because I escaped getting kidnapped months ago, or just because I didn’t flee with the rest of the Death Eaters at the end of the war?”
. Draco sighed. “I suppose. Don’t worry if you need to ditch me at some point, I have some shopping to do anyway.”
She sighed. “Have you ever been around Dementors, darling?” He shook his head. There had been a few that lingered around the castle in his third year, and he remember the sensation being somewhat unpleasant, but none of them had ever tried to feed off him. “They’re quite interesting creatures, actually. They feed off happy memories. Think about—think about a memory as an onion. Usually the layers of the onion never fall off. You can think about something over and over again without losing any of the memory’s value or content. But Dementors peel the layers away. Each time you think a happy thought, they steal it from you. You can only think of it with clarity a certain number more times.”
Draco followed Harry into an empty classroom. “Harry, whatever I did I’m—“
“Yes,” Draco said without hesitation. “I want to see my mother. I want to see how they question her, I want to make sure she’s alright.”
“I’m sure he doesn’t really think that about you. I’m sure of it. I hate the guy but he isn’t...that.” Harry said. “That must have been really hard to see your parents like that. Do you know when they’ll get out?”
“The Ministry thinks they’re hiding something. Maybe they are hiding something, I don’t even know. I don’t even know my own family well enough to tell you, Potter, because my whole life I believed that my parents would protect me and keep me safe and how well did that work out? I believed my father when he said he would take care of my mother, and how well did that work out? None of it did, and none of it ever will. Sometimes I don’t even know why I’m fucking here at this school, following my probation. I’m never going to have a job, or a family, because I’ll always just be a reformed Death Eater
The Burrow was likely the most bizarre building Draco had ever seen. It looked like multiple shacks stacked on top of each other, a dwelling that surely would collapse without the use of magic. Certainly everything Malfoy Manor wasn’t, the Burrow was warm and inviting. Pesky garden gnomes tried to smash Draco’s shoes as he walked up the rickety front porch, with Harry helping him with his trunk in front.
This did not help Draco’s already unsettled stomach, and he fell to his knees and heaved near the ocean. The freezing salt water spraying on his face exacerbated his shaking. Yarney and Draco had landed on a small island next to the looming Azkaban prison. It had a dock with small rowboats and a building into which Yarney dragged Draco after he collected himself.
“Hey guys, we need your help.” Harry sat beside Hermione and gently pulled Draco down with him, handing him a pillow from the couch.
“No one really specific except Ron and Hermione, unless someone else brought it up,” Harry said. “Mrs. Weasley may insist that you come by for Christmas if I let her know.”
Ahhhhhhhh I hope you guys like this! As always, please comment on what more you may want to see. I love you guys!
“Please, please help, someone please, I can’t, someone please,” he was sobbing quietly to himself. At least, he thought he was speaking aloud in between gulps of air, but everything felt so loud that he couldn’t tell his internal voice from his external one. An amount of time passed this way, Draco was sure it had to have been hours or days, but it seemed just as dark as it had when the attack started. Maybe the sun had gone out. Maybe he was dead. He wasn’t shaking anymore, wasn’t even cold.
Draco let Harry talked about Ministry woes while he leaned back and closed his eyes. He was feeling more aware by the second, and then suddenly it hit him that he discussed dating Potter. He shot up in the bench with horror, and Harry startled next to him.
Draco frowned. “You spent time with Sirius Black?”
Narcissa looked at him for a moment and sipped her wine. “You sound like you have someone in mind.”
Daphne, Blaise, and Greg all looked at each other for a moment, having some sort of secret conversation. Blaise nodded. “Then I guess we’ll have to get used to having you around,” he said somewhat reluctantly. Draco knew that it was out of care, though. He was surprised at how much his friends had begun to protect him. He wish he could say that he would have done the same—he certainly would now, but years ago? It was unlikely.
With a final embrace, Draco made his way outside. It was already dark, with the only light coming from the half moon above. Draco felt entirely numb—more so than when he had hypothermia in the last month. In fact, looking back later, Draco had no idea how he came to stand in front of the bizarre structure that had to have been the Burrow. But all of a sudden, he scented Harry as his arms wrapped around Draco.
“Yeah. That’s great.” Harry kept his head down.
Draco looked up. Maybe this meeting wasn’t about what he thought it would be. He never visited the Professor to sign up for a session with the Mind Healer like Granger said everyone had to do. Even Blaise made an appointment yesterday, saying that he doesn’t mind sitting in silence for an hour every week if that would keep him out of trouble. But the thought of Draco sitting in silence for an hour while under scrutiny was too close to the Death Eater meetings he had to attend. He hoped it would pass Professor McGonagall’s notice, and possibly he was right. “I’m not?”
“Well, we’re still keeping it quiet. Give Harry time to change his mind about his reputation getting tarnished,” Draco stabbed at his food.
The next few days passed by in bliss. Draco spent the rest of Saturday evening catching up on homework and relaying all the details of his outing with Harry to his friends. They were very supportive, and sympathetic to his situation regarding Madame Rosmerta. Sunday was also a lazy day, but Draco did manage to squeeze in a Quidditch game with the other eighth-years, this time with no painful flashbacks marring the experience. Harry and Draco continued to spend their nights in bed together, with no physical contact, but exchanging whispers about the past year to each other. Each story exchanged helped to ease the burden on both boys, and made their dreams a little nicer.
Harry looked at Draco like he doubted him, but continued to gather his things and didn’t mention anything. “Glad to hear it. I’m planning on talking to Kingsley about this magic-blocking band of yours.”
Draco downed the two shots immediately and the bartender refilled them, with Draco immediately drinking the rest. Only a few minutes went by before his head was absolutely swimming. His stomach churned with the alcohol and the heavy thoughts that were settling into his brain. Draco was able to get two more shots in him before the bartender cut him off. “Wait a half hour, see how you feel,” the gruff man said, sliding Draco a glass of water that he had no intention of drinking. Draco glanced at the clock—it had only been a few minutes since Draco had been humiliated at the classier pub. Potter was probably back at Hogwarts now with his real friends.
With Draco Malfoy’s parents, Narcissa and Lucius, currently awaiting retrial in Azkaban, it makes sense that the young Malfoy would want to get close to Potter. If all goes according to Draco Malfoy’s plan, Potter could be ready to testify on his parents’ behalf by the hearing in early November—just three short weeks from now. It is unknown whether he is using a love potion or even the Imperius Curse to do so, but the Prophet nevertheless encourages readers to take caution when interacting with even so-called “reformed” members of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s army.
? Draco thought after he was finished vomiting. He washed his face and rinsed his mouth out, unsure of what to do next. He was looking at himself in the mirror and contemplating his next move when he heard a cacophony of voices in the hallway. He cursed as he realized it was eleven, and the first period of classes was over.
Draco scoffed. “Yeah, right. That’s why you hexed me on the Quidditch pitch, and did it again just a few minutes ago.”
“This is brilliant,” Draco said. “Thank you, love.” He pulled Harry into a hug and kissed his forehead. He held on for a few seconds longer than usual, taking in Harry’s scent and gathering strength from it.
He sighed and walked over to sit on the trunk near Harry’s bed. “What’s got you all riled up, Potter?”
Draco felt a burn on his wrist, knowing the manacle was preventing him from a magical outburst. “I—you—“ he was rarely at a loss for words. “What I
“No,” Draco reassured Blaise truthfully. “It didn’t hurt, it was just gross. I’m sure it’s just a horrible metaphor for the darkness in my soul, or something.”
Draco’s friends were concerned later when Draco told them about the confrontation. “What did we tell you about walking to and from classes alone? It’s not safe,” Daphne had protested.
Draco blinked and realized that the man sitting before him was full of wonder and mystery, and he couldn’t wait to learn everything about him. “Thank Merlin I never made you so angry that you turned me into a balloon...” Draco marveled as the two sat down, with their identities blissfully mundane, at the restaurant. A candle was lit between them, and they were handed wine menus.
An enemy finds out that Harry and Draco are officially dating, and Draco heads home for the weekend.
“I didn’t have much of a choice, to be honest with you.”
That got a genuine laugh out of Draco. “Prick,” he said.
But Harry’s intentions in saying that were good, and Draco was happy that he successfully finished another civil conversation with the Boy Who Lived. Harry turned out the lights and Draco got back under the covers, hoping that sleep would be the one thing that would come easy to him.
“Where are you going?” Harry asked, confused.
That perfectly described the following week for Draco. He was closer to Harry than ever. They were inching closer to a new level of intimacy. For the first time, Draco was actively communicating what he wanted to someone who was listening. Draco was better at that than Harry. Dragging information out from the Boy Who Lived was so hard partially because Draco wasn’t sure Harry knew what he wanted.
“Hey, how are you feeling?” Harry leaned forward, tired eyes dry.
“What’s it look like m’doing?” he slurred. Inwardly he cringed—he sounded like Lucius. “Jus’ go, Potter. You don’ need to be here.”
“What in the world is going on—“
“Yes,” Draco said firmly. Sure, he didn’t deserve a single moment with the Boy Who Lived, who was perhaps the greatest person in the universe for reasons ignored by many. But as long as Harry wanted to be with him, Draco could never hurt him.
There were still four long tables set up for each of the houses with a table at the top for the staff. However, there was another table close to the back, perpendicular to the four house tables, that was slightly smaller than the rest. It was decorated as finely as the rest and had room for about twenty individuals.
“I mean, I died,” Harry said exasperatedly. “And I’m supposed to care about the thoughts of Lucius Malfoy, an even less sane one than before? I don’t think so.”
Draco swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat and pushed that thought aside. He closed that emotional door in his mind before its contents could spill open, knowing full well that the next time he wanted to open that door, there would be a huge mess to clean up.
Draco’s heart sank. His friends were right to be angry with him, and their anger was even part of his plan to drive them away, but he wasn’t sure he could take any more berating today. “What do you mean?” he said evenly, as if he had no idea what they were talking about.
These thoughts ran through Draco’s mind as he tried to go to sleep one night, Harry beside him. The application for a visit to Azkaban was sitting on his desk, filled out for his mother, but not for his father. Draco lay very still and stared at the ceiling.
“What—I wouldn’t even want to bring the Dark Lord back. I really wouldn’t. And even if I did, I’m not sure what my relationship with Potter has to do with this.” Draco felt sick. He was so incredibly
Thankfully his friends—
“Welcome back, Mr. Malfoy. Are you alright? Have a seat,” the Professor gestured to her chair.
“That one guy? Aunt Andromeda’s son in law?”
“Of course you don’t. But you’re the Boy Who Lived. You can have any job that you’d like once we get out of this place.”
Harry pulled out a golden coin and looked at embossed lettering on the front. “We have to go. Hermione said Kingsley is back in his office and is looking for us right now.”
He must have fallen asleep and rather quickly too, because he silently jolted awake when the door to his compartment burst opened. The individual who disturbed him was breathing quickly and bolted the door—something Draco realized he should have done. The figure’s back was still turned to Draco, but he could nevertheless tell that it was none other than Harry Potter who had entered his compartment. Draco didn’t know how to react. Seeing Potter brought back memories that he didn’t want to relive—the Fiendfyre, when him and his friends were captured at Malfoy Manor. Draco was literally face-to-face with one of his nightmares.
As he began to walk away and the rest of the group followed, Draco was having an extremely difficult time sorting out his feelings. He felt horribly nervous and embarrassed by what just happened, but also was insanely attracted to Harry in this moment. Draco remembered his sass, but forgot the utter strength and confidence with which he acted. If Draco could, he would kiss Harry right then and there, even though they hadn’t shared that moment at all yet.
“Good,” Ginny said. “You deserve to be jinxed for the rest of your life for all that you’ve done.” She paused for a moment but lowered her wand, seemingly unsure of what to do with him.
Draco was able to walk Harry through simple Occlumency exercises, in which people were blocked from reading Harry’s mind and Harry read Draco’s. For the first, Draco split the class in two. He made sure half the class couldn’t hear, then had the other half of the class tell Harry a simple story that he was supposed to picture. The other half then took turns trying to coax the story out of Harry’s mind, with the Professor trying last. Harry did well, and they only came up with vague details about a lost cat. For the second part, Harry left the room while the students placed chocolate frog cards in a particular order. Then, with Draco increasing his mental shields with each attempt, Harry successfully found the order of the cards in Draco’s mind multiple times.
The day finally came. Parallel to their last Hogsmeade visit, which Draco prayed was a worse experience than this one would be, they took the train up to Hogsmeade, hiding under the Invisibility Cloak and staying in silence to avoid attracting any attention. Neither of them had discussed how open they wanted to be about what was going on with their respective friend groups and the school, and Draco worried that Harry may be mad if he knew that Draco had already told his friends about the impending date. However it seemed both of them came to a silent understanding that the people not expressly involved in their lives didn’t need to know what was going on right now. This feeling did not come out of shame, at least not for Draco, but out of fear. Draco didn’t need to be in the Prophet any more this week than the trial would already push him into the spotlight.
Harry pursed his lips and looked away, trying not to laugh.
They kept chatting on like that until Harry drifted off to sleep. Draco sat next to him, alternating between watching him and looking at the moon. He knew that Harry was sassy, but he was still surprised by his shrewdness. It was like he finally met his match. It usually bothered him when someone else matched his level of sarcasm, as though they were taking away one of his only unique features. With Harry, it didn’t feel like that feature was taken away, but joyfully reinforced. Harry was one of the few people nowadays that could make Draco laugh. Feeling sleepy, safe, and utterly content, Draco fell asleep.
“I’ve heard of a certain ‘Dumbledore’s Army’ that existed starting three years ago,” she smiled at Harry. “That’s why I almost feel unequipped to teach you all. It seems that you have much more you could teach me. This will be our first project, and it will last the greater part of the term. You will pick one skill to use against dark spells or intentions, and learn it inside and out. Learn its weaknesses, its strengths, and most importantly, how to use it in many situations. Then you are to teach the class this skill. Your grade will not just depend on how well you can perform the skill, but how well your peers can by the end of your teachings.
Draco tried not to flinch, but thankfully Harry intervened. “I think we’re both tired, Mrs. Weasley.”
“I do also,” Harry spoke up, as did Neville and some others.
“Vincent and I...we were planning to graduate together, live together, and...er...just have a life together.”
Draco visits his parents in Azkaban
“Hey—I’m sorry. You don’t have to leave, I’ll stop. That was too abrupt.”
. Just to check, Draco knocked on Blaise, Daphne, and even Gregory’s door, but no one answered. He looked down at his shaking arm—there wasn’t a dry spot on his sleeve to be found.
“No thanks!” Harry called over his shoulder, rushing Draco past the balding man.
This was probably one of the most difficult chapters I’ve written! I hope it’s at least halfway decent. What do you think is going to happen? What should Draco do?
Harry laughed. “You feeling up to walking back?”
Harry sat down next to Draco, their legs touching. Draco felt sparks throughout his body. “That was really brave of you.”
As everyone started to pull people into their group, the Slytherins looked at each other in panic.
“I’m fine. Is everyone else alright?”
The night had ended on a positive note, and Draco was able to sleep through the night with little difficulty despite his earlier flashback. Yesterday felt like a long time ago, but Draco remembered that he had a decision to make. Should he go to Hogsmeade with Potter and his friends after he tutored Harry in Potions? He would like to get a gift for his mother before he sent a small care package out, but that place also held bad memories for him. He put Madame Rosmerta under the Imperius Curse, and sometimes he had Occlumency lessons with his Aunt Bellatrix at the Hogs Head last year. If Draco wasn’t focused enough, Bellatrix would torture him while his mom watched with tears in her eyes. That hurt way more than the physical pain. Seeing the look on his mother’s face...
After spending the better part of the night begging morning to come, the sun shone far too soon for Draco’s liking. Something inside of him lifted after he broke his own wand, and he was able to get a few hours of quiet sleep. Though he knew this was good for his body, his mind felt fuzzy and was pleading for more rest now that it had gotten a little taste.
Draco nodded. “How bad is it going to be? In there, I mean.”
“Shut up, all of you!” Greg finally spoke up, jerking Draco to attention. “Just...shut up.” Daphne patted Greg’s arm.
Sleep, sadly, did not come easily to Draco that night. He tossed and turned for a bit, trying to calm himself using the sound of Potter’s even breathing and occasional mumbling. When he finally drifted off into sleep, fire consumed him. He was back in the Room of Requirement with Vincent, but this time Potter chose to fly away on his broom rather than save him. The Fiendfyre closed in on Draco, and every time he gasped for breath he inhaled the flames. He saw Greg and Vincent’s faces melt next to him, and he was next.
“They’re taking a recess, I’m not sure if you heard.” Harry started rubbing at his forehead, and Draco noticed his hand was shaking.
Draco was taken aback—he remembered Fleur Delacour from the Triwizard Tournament. Girls were never his thing, so his mind had more been on Viktor Krum, but even he had noticed Fleur’s beauty. “That—that’s fantastic! Congratulations. Is this your first time becoming an uncle?”
On the first Wednesday of October, a few nights after Draco’s conversation with Greg, Harry and Draco lay in bed like normal. Except on this night, Harry had gotten into Draco’s bed right away, not even bothering to wait for one of them to have a nightmare.
“Oh, quite the opposite,” Greg smirked as he said this, and Draco shot him a mild glare.
“Harry, you’ve fought enough. I guess if everything you’ve said is true, you’ve spent the past, what, four years fighting? Let other people help you for once. You deserve to be a normal student.”
“They need to heal too, mate. All of us do,” Harry spoke up from the floor. “Trust me, I know as much as any—“
Chapter 6
Draco wasn’t sure how much time had passed when the Healer came in. She was a nice woman, but either refused to answer Draco’s questions about what was going on, or truly didn’t know. She gave him a potion to help with his head and told him that he would be fine, but he needed to take it easy over the next few days.
“Cool, right? The idea came from a Muggle technology called texting.”
. “I’m Auror Yarney, by the way. I just finished my training and was hired last week as a junior Auror. I have been assigned to assist with your family case as well as other reformed Death Eaters. I imagine we’ll be meeting again after this.”
Everyone was silent for a moment. Then Greg spoke up. “I agree with Daphne. I’m—I actually signed up with McGonagall yesterday to see one of those Mind Healer people. I don’t want to feel this way anymore.” It was more than he had said in the past day, and Draco’s head perked up in surprise. Greg met Draco’s gaze with a small smile and shrug. “What harm could it do?”
“Any day now. If not by the end of this week, there will be hell to pay. That much I can guarantee.” Lucius seemed to Draco like a pouting child who wasn’t getting their way.
Mrs. Weasley turned around sharply. She met Fleur’s eyes, and then hers trended downward to Fleur’s concealed middle. Fleur beamed. “It appears you will be...”
“Harry? Harry, wake up,” Draco rubbed his shoulder lightly.
“I didn’t want to burden him.” Harry shrugged. “Besides, it was the safest place for me, especially after Voldemort came back.”
Usually at this point in a panic attack Draco became oblivious to the world around him, but this time it raged on and took his full consciousness with it. He was aware of the hail that started to fall on him, the pinches on his skin. Maybe the hail would break him into pieces, leaving his limbs to the animals. He wanted that so badly. He wanted to breathe or he wanted to die, but he hated being stuck in between. His vision danced around him as he begged for someone to come and take him out of his misery, their method of doing so being entirely their choice.
Greg gave him a sad smile. “You never really let me, mate,” he said gently. “But now is the time to start fresh, at least with each other.”
“But you still haven’t mastered—“
“What do you want, Looney?” Blaise was aware that Luna had been imprisoned in the Manor for the better part of last year. He probably thought that she was going to try and hex Draco. Draco felt a sudden rush of affection for his distant friend—
The group looked at each other awkwardly. “Yes...I’m really sorry Draco, but they chose not to invite your family.” Every year the Greengrass family held a New Years Ball. Draco hated the receiving line and the other formalities, but he and his friends always managed to sneak away to one of the balconies, steal wine, and have a good time. His friends would have to do that without him this year.
It seemed like Yarney was taking a lot longer than he had to bring his mother. The same sort of panic set into Draco—what if Yarney left him here in this cold, dark place? Finally the door creaked open and Yarney led in the figure that was supposed to be Lucius Malfoy. Draco couldn’t help but gawk—his father was nearly unrecognizable. All the weight he had gained back this summer was gone, and his face was skeletal. The expression on his face was the worst part—Draco’s father was glaring at him with a hatred in his eyes that Draco had rarely seen. The gaze was so intense that even with Lucius’s frail body, Draco was grateful he was in chains.
“I dunno...” Harry said, thinking. “Wait a minute! We’re wizards!” With a wave of his wand, he conjured a small couch that could hold the two of them by the window.
After a nearly sleepless night, only two days before their date, Draco decided to consult his friends, who were absolutely thrilled that he and Potter had finally expressed their feelings for each other.
“Somewhat. I actually lived in the Leaky Cauldron for a bit when I was thirteen.”
But no, it was Draco who couldn’t see. Everything was blurry—he wasn’t in the dining room in the Manor, but he wasn’t sure where he was. The floor he was standing on was hard—or was he laying down? He vomited on himself as he continued to shake.
“I’m not going to tell you. You can speculate all you’d like but I won’t confirm or deny anyone. And besides, I don’t even know if I fancy them or not. Or what he thinks about me.”
“No, just wanted to see how you were doing before your big date!” Blaise sat on Harry’s bed, which hadn’t been slept in for a few weeks. “Potter makes his bed?”
was cracking jokes at his family’s expense. What he did care about was the absolutely horrifying attitude toward which the newspaper treated Harry Potter. The paper alternated between praising Harry Potter as though this was the stance it had taken from the beginning and criticizing Potter for not doing more to help the current Death Eater crisis. They made remarks such as “Potter seemingly doesn’t care about the remaining Death Eater threat, as he has turned down multiple invitations from various departments at the Ministry to come assist...” and “Potter and fellow war heroes Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom were seen with a group of Slytherins at the Ministry. Is Potter being bribed or coerced, or is his only concern pardoning former war criminals rather than trying to catch more?”
“I would. But it’s Sunday remember. Anderson said we’d change things up today and I fear for the worst.”
“you really picked a project and a half to save this time Potter.” Blaise started. “But.. I’m not going to deny you’re likely the only chance Draco Malfoy has at a redemption. So I’m going to tell you this for his sake.” he stayed silent for a moment. Looking for the right words. “as you know he never wanted to be part of he whole dark lord business. But it doesn’t take away years of indoctrination. It doesn’t take away years of doing horrible things. That boy has seen a lot… he refuses any help he can get because he feels undeserving. There’s more behind the asshole mask he puts up.”
By the time he got back, an hour later and a lot more careless he was purring softly, finding Harry sitting on top of his bed. His shoulders were slumped a little as he was looking over what he must have thought to be Draco. Draco himself was feeling a little reckless. He might not deserve Harry while he was himself.. but he was touch starved as ever and Harry was always willing to pet a damn leopard.
“We did yes. Potter is set on winning whatever game we’ll be playing. I just play along. Good thinking on making him get me chocolate frogs anytime he wants something out on me. I’d say I owe you. but I’m forced to hang out with the chosen one. It’s a fair trade off.” Draco smirked at him.
After delivering they were dismissed, they could take the bread for a lunch or leave it.
Blaise continued his hideous accusations and banter when Pansy refused to be his out. Draco took it. He smiled.. Genuinely. He had only been here for a few days and Hogwarts was starting to feel the way it had when he was 11. Like home.
He looked up at harry. Whom was laughing too. Giving him a playful wink. Draco wheezed. Fine. He could sway his hips a little right. That wouldn’t hurt.
Hopefully that makes some sense. I was going to put Ron and Blaise together but I'm afraid that would end in death.
He wasn’t disappointed when his mother didn’t come out to his new wand or talk to him about his day. She had bigger problems. Pip came out to bring him a chocolate milk and some of his own baked bread. Smiled when he complimented todays outfit.. a thick wooly sweater. Clearly hand knitted by a first time knitter, judging by the holes. And then left him be.
He got himself a glass of water before jumping back into his own bed. Which proved to be rather cold. Grumbling he fell back asleep.
“professor.. I refuse. I’m not going to be attached to Granger the whole fucking run. It is one thing I am forced to stay in  a room with her!” Pansy protested, making professor Leigh turn to her. “To bad miss Parkinson.. 10 more pushups for speaking up without being asked to. Everyone.”
“Rough night at Hogsmeade.” He lied between his teeth, avoiding her gaze by staring at the floor.
They laughed. It was rather comfortable. Weasley was after all quite funny when he wasn’t at your throat. They stayed for a bit longer before Harry excused them
“It’s a nice tree if you know. once you calm it down.” Harry snorted, looking over the group that had now gathered in front of the tree.
“I’ll try. Thank you.”
“Fine.”
There was some complaining. Draco felt his heart sink into his shoes. No. he really didn’t want to do this. First of all he had very little stamina. He used to be quite avid on being fit. But the past few years had been horrible for his health… then second of all he had to do this with Potter, as much as Draco love to hate on him and avoid him.. winning a war had done him good and he was likely at peak performance.
Harry huffed again, cheeks heating. “Get on with it, ‘mione. I’m knackered.”
“You look
He adjusted Potter’s fringe. It reached his nose. Potter was still looking at him through his hair. “Stop looking at me, Potter! Merlin.” Harry quickly averted his eyes and sniffed again. Malfoy counted to five, then reached his pocket for a handkerchief. “Here. And don't give it back to me.”
“Up you get. We have charms first thing.”
Harry wasted no time and climbed back in. Just as he was drifting off to sleep, a voice rang out.
Harry glared at Hermione. It’s all her fault. Hermione beamed.
tart?”
Malfoy froze. In a historically ineloquent moment, he forgot himself and managed to wrench one hand out of Potter’s deathhold. He patted the Gryffindor awkwardly on the shoulder.
Malfoy smirked triumphantly at Harry through the mirror, standing taller. Harry swallowed thickly. “Can you do the rest?”
Malfoy opened one eye, then the other. His book had fallen shut, thumb marking the place where he left off. He slowly lowered to the couch, and reached down to offer Harry the plate. “Treacle
Malfoy climbed through the portrait hole, one hand carrying an open book and the other carrying a plate of treacle tarts.
“Six thirty-one.”
Harry ran his hand through his hair. He stood in front of the bathroom mirror, with a pair of conjured shears in one hand. Just a little bit.
“Please, goddamnit.” Harry shook the shears off his hand and buried his face in his palms. His hair wrapped itself around his hands, as if consoling him.
Malfoy looked at Harry, whose lack of glasses frankly made him look like a particularly pathetic crup. It made him want to slap him and hide him at the same time. He looked heavenward, praying for patience. “Turn around, Potter. I don't have all day.”
, Malfoy,” he said emphatically.
Harry poked his head out from the tangled mess of his sheets and met Malfoy’s slippered toes. “Good morning” Harry managed roughly. His throat was still closed up with sleep. He rubbed his eyes.
Malfoy seriously reconsidered Potter’s sanity. “Right.” He considered Potter’s hair. It was thick, black, curly, and alive, reaching like tendrils towards his face and sticking out at the top. It curled around his neck and seemed to cling onto Potter. He carefully took the silver shears in his hand and examined them. They seemed to be muggle.
. He glanced at Malfoy’s empty bed. His curtains were halfway drawn and the shower was running. Harry beamed, victorious. The bathroom was occupied! He could afford a few more minutes. In the warm, cosy bed, under the warm thick blanket, in a soft sleepy world.
Malfoy sighed again. He ripped his own curtain open and pointed to his bed.
Harry nearly tripped in his haste as he climbed into Malfoy’s bed. It was warmer than the floor. Very much warmer. He burrowed in deeper and mumbled a thank-you.
have his hair tied up. It didn't hurt after Hermione adjusted it, but all the same. It would definitely hurt in the morning.
Malfoy looked at him and his calm expression cracked, leaking bemusement. “Clearly. It’s a miracle you have hair left on your head.” Malfoy stepped farther in the room, taking care not to disrupt the hair. It formed a circle around Harry, almost protecting him.
“We have 10 minutes. Everyone get in. just follow the hallway.” Potter called. Everyone was quick to get in. Potter came in last, they tree coming back into motion shortly after.
“I agree. I’m absolutely starving.” Draco snorted. Pushing her off and letting her lead him to the great hall.
“Yeah yeah. Try it.” He took a sip. The alcohol made it even better. He supressed a satisfied hum.
Nearly invisible as he made his way to the dorm, avoiding the patrols.
He leaned close to the book, hiding his face behind it almost. Nearly jumping out of his skin when he felt the armrest he was leaning on dented in. he glared up at the culprit. Potter.
“From the moment the mark on a child starts to vanish. We teach them wandless magic. Magic is to be respected. Work with your magic. I want every single one of you to focus on your magical core. Close your eyes. Let your magic flow through you. find its center. Focus on it put your hands together. Move your focus from your core to your fingertips. Mend it to materialize. It might not work right away… but keep practicing.”
He shook his shoulder lightly… but he knew anything more drastic would just make it worse. He bit his lip. Desperate measures. He couldn’t bare the look on the others face as he gasped for air.
Without really thinking he snuggled into it. Muttering something about warm. He barely noticed Harry making some excuses and saying his goodbyes, he managed a small wave when he walked out.
So he did. The guard who had gotten him from his cell came over. Giving him a curt nod. “Alright mr Malfoy. We’re straight to Olivanders shop. After you’ll be given Polyjuice as we shop for your Books. Robes will have to be ordered. Let’s go, we have a tight schedule.”
Warning, Mentions of PTSD and nightmares in the beginning of this. I did some research for this one but it is not entirely accurate. please do not take the advice given for truth and do your own research, this is just "What draco knows of it".
“Where have you been the whole train ride?” Pansy sneered.
“If you’re gonna nap I’m leaving you behind. I need to shower before dinner.” Draco complained.
warning: Some stuff about the feelings of deserving abuse. obviously some physical abuse and talk of being hurt
“I’m afraid Poppy wants to keep you at least tonight. You had a pretty nasty  concussion.” She didn’t seem convinced of their deal entirely.
He flushed, looking away, things popping into his mind that probably shouldn’t. he wasn’t gay after all.
“What? Like a fountain pen?”
“Is that a bribe Potter? Very Slytherin of you.” he paused, smirking at the other. “Deal. I hope you know I have quite the alcohol tolerance.”
“we certainly made a scene.” Draco commented quietly, noticing some people were pointing and staring at them still. “I’ll.. I should leave you to your friends. I’m certain Hermoine would love a dance with you.” he said, sipping his punch. The realization sinking in. he wasn’t supposed to have fun. Not with Harry potter of all people, that could ruin his reputation. He gave the other a forced smile. He’d enjoyed the dance and he wished they could continue talking but it would be bad for potter. He quickly turned on his heels to find Pansy. But was greeted by his cousin instead. Luna Lovegood.
“Fantastic. You’re no use.” She grumbled. “Lets go for dinner. Fuck Blaise.”
For this recipe he didn’t write down the steps. He simply let Harry sit back and watch. If he wanted he could copy the recipe next time.
The Bread is my own recipe I use and the Jam is one i pulled from the internet.
As soon as Harry was calm again, which took nearly thirty minutes, he pulled himself away. Turning back and grabbing a glass of water. Now gently shaking Harry’s shoulder.
“Care to tell me who has done this?” she asked cooly. Not cold. Rather calm and collected.
“They held me down in the dungeon. Father and Greyback. The dark lord told me it was my destiny. I was chosen to make up for fathers sins.” His knees felt wobbly.
“Wasn’t too hungry Pans. I was setting up a proper schedule to get through my time. Besides the ministry would love to see I am actually making an effort.” He shrugged, following his friends to the fields, making some small talk about what in the hell this exercise would be. knowing Hogwarts.. probably outrageous and deadly..
I want everyone to keep in mind that this is a work of FAN fiction. It's diverging from canon. There are going to be inconsistencies with the main story.  That's all. If you want to leave a comment please try to be a little positive or offer genuine criteria. Not just that my story isn't accurate.
He and the Weasley snuck up to the tree. Harry nodded to Ron. Who all of a sudden sprinted towards the other direction. The tree immediately began moving. Aiming towards Weasley while potter got to the roots of the tree, pressing his wand into a crevice. Just as the tree was about to “Whomp” Ron. It froze.
He had very little alcohol tolerance, it was embarrassing really. He never really drank and he’d clearly reached his limit.
“Perhaps we should try getting a saddle on her today? I’ll hold her while you get used to the feel?” Potter offered. “I mean we should have started already, the others have and well be walking around either way..”
“Keep it. I’ve got way too many. They’re easy for taking notes but they do run out rather quick. And You’re not allowed to use them for essays.” He explained, watching Anderson stroll into the class.
Draco watched him, he couldn’t quite put his finger on Harry anymore. He was being nice, a bit too nice perhaps but Draco found he didn’t mind, he was growing rather attached to the savior of the wizarding world. He was much different than Draco had always thought him to be. He wasn’t arrogant, a slimy git that used his name to get everything. He was kind, wanted to help those around him. Pretty much selfless. Perhaps Draco could teach him a thing or two about allowing himself to ask for things for himself too.
It held something alright. Or rather he was being held. He woke up to someone behind him, pulling him close, it was rather nice and warm and he leaned into it for a sec before remembering what had happened last night. “P..Potter?” he asked, heat rising to his cheeks.
“Harry?” his voice was still small. “Are you angry? You’re frowning.”
“I believe I do… Malfoy.” Draco returned the curt nod he got from Ron. At least the other acknowledged him. Which was better than the balled fists and near punches of their previous interactions. The smile the other wore didn’t seem forced.. perhaps tonight it was ok to burry the hatched.
“I wouldn’t know.. I’m not my father.” Draco spoke, trying his best not to let his nerves show through… maybe he could defuse the situation.
“Of course. Its only fair.” Harry hummed in reply, flushing slightly by how deep he’d been lost in just staring at the other. he quickly got to cleaning. Doing it all by hand, which Draco found very inefficient but didn’t comment on. He simply watched as he went to make them some tea. He accio’d his secret stash of rooibos toffee tea and brewed some for them.
By 1pm Draco found himself in bed. Tossing and turning and struggling to catch sleep. His mind was filled with too many thoughts.
Kinda lost track of what i was doing midway through this chapter, started another writing project, talked to my proofreaders for the book about some stuff and just got busy.
“Do you want to talk about it.”
“Git. I knew it.” Draco snickered. “You’re cold?  Do you need your coat back?” he asked softly, distracted again.
“Ginger and Lemon zest.” He took his own. Could’ve used some more ginger.. but it was doable. He felt the potion run through his veins. He only felt groggy now.
“So are you coming tonight? It’s Friday after all and you haven’t been to Hogsmeade in so long.” Pans hummed, cutting up dandelion roots. Draco took the knife from her, she was butchering the job and uneven root squares could mess with the consistency.
“all it took was the promise of Ogdens Finest, Paid by Weasley.”
“For Samhain? Black. Hermoine how do you feel about showing a little skin?” Blaise asked.
It was getting easier to talk to him. As long as he didn’t bring up anything difficult.. Malfoy seemed to shut down anytime he brought up anything more than a sports schedule. He had issues. And Harry was dying to figure them out.
He decided to simple grab the glass and filled it with the replenishing spell. It slowly filled the glass but it was better than nothing.
“No. He refuses to admit he has a problem.” He sounded a bit pissed off about it.
He woke up early. How late was it? Casting a quick tempus he realised it was 7am. Groaning he sat up. He remembered last night faintly. He remembered standing in front of Voldemort. Firing spells at him but nothing worked. He was held back as his friends were tortured to death. It send shivers down his spine. He was set loose at some point. Chased by Fenrir and his gang into the forbidden forest.
“Then I’ll stay put.” He promised. Pulling the blanked up to his chin.
Seamus and Dean, both covered in badly glamoured love bites, someone aught to teach them to hide those better.
“I know its strange but.. I get it.. I want to help him. I know he’s trying. He deserves a chance too.. and if Draco Malfoy can reform and live in peace. Perhaps so can others.” Harry nodded.
They stood in silence in the cold night air. Leaning against the wall. It was nice.
He felt a cleaning charm being put over him. The magic itching on his skin. A suit was pushed into his arms.. he faintly registered the order to put them on. Which he did. His shaking hands fumbling with buttons. An irritated sigh of the guard, whom he had yet to look in the eye, followed by another spell, doing the buttons up for him. He was handed some water. He took it.. probably the first thing he had had in a while.. it tasted delicious…
Realizing he hadn’t replied nor taken her outstretched  hand as his thoughts ran he coughed awkwardly.
He wobbled slightly. He was feeling nauseous and tired. Perhaps he could get some sleep in now and make his way to the infirmary in the morning. It sounded far better than making his way back there or getting Blaise’s attention.
He felt himself bent backwards in pain. Stinging hex, straight to the spine. It wasn’t as horrible as crucio. But damn was it horrible. He cussed under his breath as he reached for his wand while he sank to his knees. He was wide awake all of a sudden. Panic starting to grasp at him.
“I know, it’s one of my redeeming qualities. I can’t be perfect all the time you know.” Harry chuckled in reply. “I’ll get her back into the field. you relax for a bit.” He hummed, already starting on it.
This wasn’t a conventional nightmare. Draco didn’t wake up screaming or crying. He woke up and first had to check if his hands were wet and, by habit, if his tongue was still in place. As soon as he moved, he felt the pull in his stomach and the lump in his throat. He launched up from the couch and stumbled to the bed pole, trying to steady himself. It was no use. He barely found his way to the bathroom before he collapsed in front of the toilet, heaving. He hadn’t thrown up from a nightmare in a while, and he found the sensation to be unpleasantly familiar.
“Then what do they want from me?” Draco was getting upset. “I’ve done horrible things, I know this, I acknowledge this. But I can’t take them back, I can’t undo the past.” Suddenly, Draco shot up. “Wait. You don’t think they want me to use the Time Turner to change the past, do you? Or that they will?”
“You should sit for a bit, take it easy, have something to eat. We need to go to the Hospital Wing once you can, I think something is still wrong with your fingertips and toes.” Draco glanced at his hands—his fingertips were a ghoulish shade of black, and he realized his hands were moving jerkily. He tentatively tried to touch his nose with his pointer finger, and nearly poked himself in the eye.
Blaise enveloped Draco in an unexpected hug, patting him on the back. “That’s wonderful! I knew everything would work out. Come on, let’s go back in and hear more praise for the Gryffindors.” Blaise was being sarcastic, but at the moment Draco wouldn’t have cared if he were required to kiss Granger’s feet. He was still riding the high from getting a moment of affection with his mother, and knowing that she was safe and sound at the Manor.
The rest of the short carriage ride passed in mostly silence, with only a few remarks here and there hypothesizing what was to come. Draco was starting to feel more comfortable with the idea of going back to school. He was around individuals who knew a little bit what he had gone through, what he had done...and they were still speaking to him.
“It’s alright, Draco, it’s okay. It’s over.”
“Oh don’t worry,” Harry said with a smile on his face that Draco couldn’t decipher. “It’s definitely good enough. What do you think, Draco?”
The next few days went by extremely slowly. For once, the thing stressing Draco out was trivial. He wasn’t worried about an evil figure in his house, imprisonment, torture, or any of those things—rather, he was concerned about his upcoming outing with Potter.
But the outcome of this situation was the same regardless—Professor Snape was not here to bail him out. He angrily scribbled his name by an appointment slot.
Draco felt uncomfortable. “Distantly. He’s some sort of cousin, but I have a dozen of those.”
“It’s not the public you have to worry about,” Daphne said, putting her silverware down and leaning forward. “It’s us.”
“Of course, if that’s what you wanted. I’m afraid I won’t be able to invite you to the Manor, not that you would want to come.”
Draco stiffened a bit at the mention of his father, and looked at Harry for any sign of malice. Finding none, he cleared his throat. “A lot of the former Death Eaters hated my father, actually. Still do. You heard Dolohov, they think he’s two-faced. And he is, they’re right, but they don’t think the Dark Lord was hard enough on him.”
Draco’s mind was so sluggish, and he reached for the water glass but found it to double before his eyes, and he didn’t know which one to pick up.
“Very well, then the trial shall commence. I would like to remind members of the Wizengamot that Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy are not on trial for any matters besides the one at hand. Certainly their past Death Eater activities should be taken into account as we begin this examination, but they will not be tried twice for the same crimes. Is this understood?” Seeing no objection, Hale continued, addressing Mr. Burke. “Do you have any witnesses that you would like to call before we conduct this trial?”
“I thought you wanted him dead,” she fired back immediately.
The thought of Narcissa trying to fill the various hallways of the Manor with her voice broke Draco’s heart. “Why don’t you get in touch with Ms. Zabini?” A few years ago, all the remaining Sacred Twenty-Eight spouses met for tea at least twice a week. Draco knew that Narcissa had been particularly fond of Blaise’s mother.
Once he reached the proper floor, he was running, and slammed immediately into Blaise. “What the bloody hell—“
“I don’t get it,” Daphne said. “If your father wants to improve the Malfoy reputation, wouldn’t dating Potter be the best way to do that? I know that’s not why you’re dating him, but it’s sort of an instant boost, isn’t it?”
. “When was the last time that you had contact with any Death Eater?”
Narcissa’s eyes filled with tears. “I’m so glad you’re safe, Dragon. You could have—“ she sobbed, something that Draco had not seen her do in a long time. “D-Dolohov, he could have—“ she pressed her hands hard to her eyes, mirroring what Draco usually does when he doesn’t want to show emotion.
“I’ll start,” Granger said. Draco felt lightheaded.
“We can have a nicer, sit-down brunch when we get back.”
Draco put some food on his plate—a good amount since his body was still recovering—as Professor McGonagall passed out their class schedules. It did appear that the eighth years were not sharing classes with any of the seventh years, and Draco was secretly relieved. Many of the seventh-years were members of Dumbledore’s Army, like the little Weasley girl, and he was sure that they hated him profusely.
“You privileged prick!” Justin Finch-Fletchley shouted. “Of course you were out of danger, your family was close to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!”
Draco’s head turned to Hermione as she bit her lip and continued. “I hope you all had a good night last night. I know living together is going to take some adjustment, but I think overall it will be a good thing. We need to get to know each other as people, not just as what the color of our insignias are. And it provides a great opportunity to work together on this project.”
Draco jolted awake with a gasp, which was thankfully muffled by the sound of Harry lowering his trunk to his seat. He must have fallen asleep, much to his horror. It was now dark outside and Potter was—good lord, Potter was only in his undershirt.
“You—“ Lucius sputtered. “You lied to the Dark Lord? You jeopardized our whole family?”
“That’s enough,” Harry said in an angry tone of which Draco had been on the receiving end a few times.
It seemed that Harry could read his mind, because he looked at Draco with affection as they made their way down the halls. “I know you’re risking a lot by doing this with me, and I really appreciate it. I hope I get to make it up to you somehow.”
Draco’s feet led him somewhere unknown to his conscious as he was lost in thought. He suddenly found himself at the Astronomy Tower—somewhere he had not gone since that fateful night in his sixth year. He walked hesitantly to the open side, as if Professor Dumbledore were going to appear at any moment to offer him refuge. He found himself gripping his wand inside his pocket, and fear palpitated in his chest despite the absence of threat.
Draco and Harry have a much needed conversation the day after his panic attack. Also, the burden of the Time Turner is lifted.
“You spent the better part of Transfiguration yesterday chasing down your alarm clock that had sprouted legs and was kicking people!” Draco could not argue with that.
Draco tried to capture the elated feeling inside and forcefully said “
“Sorry,” he said gruffly. Hermione Granger was curled up in an armchair, surrounded by books.
“What? Why?”
“You like Potter?” Daphne said in shock, and Draco shh’ed her.
“I—I don’t care what you do, Potter.”
“Very well,” Hale brought the court back to order. “Let’s continue then. The encounter with Nott?”
