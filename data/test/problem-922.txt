Draco's breath faltered, his eyes flared, but he didn't move away anymore. Instead, he pressed his upper body closer to Harry's and moved towards him until the tips of their noses almost met. Harry's gaze fell on Draco's lips,
As if someone had slapped him, Harry was thrown back into reality, in which he was pressing his lips longingly onto Draco’s. And to make matters worse, he even returned the kiss, though he probably did it rather forcedly, Harry’s grip on Draco was iron.
It is Mr Malfoy's room. Anja knows this because she personally took him there. It is furnished about as invitingly as the security guard's office but shows more personality merely by having a seating area with an armchair and a bookshelf. Mr Malfoy's bed is placed along the opposite wall, so it is in an ideal position to monitor him at all times from this very office.
Harry nodded. The pain was gone and he felt no different than usual. Only his erratic breath and the hard-throbbing heart reminded him that he had just suffered in agony. But it was over. And when Draco began to heal the wound on his hand, he felt much better than he had just moments ago.
Draco dropped his eyes and calmly smoothed a fold out of his trouser leg before replying. "I reckon we're beyond apologies."
Draco raised one eyebrow, folded his hands, placing them neatly on his thigh, let his gaze wander to his fingers, and then began to speak thoughtfully tested. "First, I want you to know that you can be honest with me at all times. If you felt... judged yesterday, then –"
"No," Draco assured with an amused shake of his head. "I'm glad you're satisfied, I really am, because –" He faltered, made an innocent face and looked uncertainly past Harry.
"But I see my mother too." The patience pays off. "This house ... did you know that she was the only one out of her sisters who had blonde hair? Is it lunacy that I imagine she’s proud that I wear her hair for her?"
"You should take it slowly, though. I'm not sure how beneficial it is for your condition," Harry warns, trying to suppress his grin.
That could have been it, an adventurous night and everything could have gone back to normal. But it didn't. The image of Draco in a skimpy miniskirt wouldn’t leave Harry's memory, haunting him like a sugar-sweet ghost and awakened an insatiable thirst for something he couldn't exactly specify.
It is strange to hear Draco speak of his past and yet the most natural thing Harry has ever done with him. In another time, Draco not only told him about it, but added visuals to his words, yet fundamentally nothing has changed. He still takes Harry with him on his journeys.
"Sirius, Draco. Draco, Sirius," Harry introduced them briefly. His eyes kept wandering impatiently to Hedwig, or rather, her ears. The dog whimpered impatiently.
Instead, his thoughts linger on the evening's conversation. He hears Malfoy's voice clearly, as it snapped from an impassive tone to desperate anger. He feels reminded of himself, which makes his thoughts no less confusing. Malfoy – the Malfoy he met – is not a man of anger. He has found too much peace within himself and in his surroundings to give in to his feelings so powerlessly.
"Here," Draco murmured and dropped the tube on Harry's chest, Harry kept staring at the label with wide eyes. Draco placed a condom next to the tube, then sat up and began tying a high ponytail at breakneck speed. Harry wasn't sure whether to continue staring at the tube in perplexity or enjoy the seductive sight. Draco was anything but tidy, primarily he just rushed, causing all the shorter wisps of hair to fall out of the ponytail and fall back into his face. As soon as the hair tie was where Draco wanted it, his gaze fell on Harry's face. "Something wrong?"
Draco's posture remained relaxed and he returned my gaze calculatingly. "I don’t hold the knowledge of what I was convicted of. All I have is conjecture, based on my always critically situated case status."
Harry met Jace Taylor in a small, shabby Muggle pub that had reminded him entirely too much of Hog's Head Inn not to stop in. He was the first man who managed to wrap Harry around his finger well enough to convince him to take a closer look at his sexuality and the last person Harry loved.
a lot easier than freaking out, so Harry gratefully accepted the offer and shoved a hand in Draco's hair just to pull him closer.
Robards smiles politely, too politely, and lowers his hand again. "We will contact Mr Malfoy immediately to express our gratitude."
"Would you ..." Draco hesitates, but then turns his head resolutely towards Harry. "Would you like to cast
The following Charms lessons turned out to be engaging enough to distract Harry from his wandering thoughts for the time being. At least the first part of the lesson. Prof. Flitwick had them test different spell combinations. For example, the summoning spell combined with a warmth spell to keep the cup of tea warm, while it was floating towards the caster. Since he gave them enough freedom to try themselves first, it was all the more fun. Hermione was, of course, the first to get two spells perfectly combined, for which Flitwick gladly rewarded her with house points.
Hermione opened her mouth as if she wanted to interject that this was not the right moment to triumph, but she held her breath for a moment to reflect on something better. “And you're absolutely sure?”
When he lacks the strength to look after his own wellbeing, Harry knows that he is not alone and his friends are not far away.
Draco raised his head briefly; he was just about to write something on a parchment. Was he seriously taking notes? Was he aware of the fact that he wouldn’t have to write the final exams if the curse manifested? But Draco’s slight smile made him forget to talk to him about it. How could one be so forbiddenly beautiful?
Harry nods absently at Jimar's question but does not look at him. Instead, he watches Draco as he stares mesmerised at the night lights of the city.
Harry's mind shut down, his heart erupted in pure euphoria. "Does that mean... Do you want to be with me, Draco? Like, officially dating and beyond the summer?"
. But trust me when I say that this morning is no longer a common occurrence. A few things happened yesterday..." Blaise broke off, lay his fingertips to his temples and sighed.
Draco sighed into the kiss as if all was well. And it felt that way. As if the world around them had stopped and held its breath. Just so they could share this moment. Harry couldn't suppress a smile, everything but Draco's lips suddenly became so incredibly unimportant. It seemed so simple now that he held Draco in his arms. Doubt and jealousy were long forgotten.
Looking at his wristwatch, Harry noticed that he should probably get going soon. Again, nervousness rose in him. Hermione asked him to remember that he didn’t have to feel forced to do anything and Ron allowed himself to joke at Harry’s expense that he could just ask Draco for a bed for the night. Harry cracked up. Not. Then he made his way to the Entrance Hall.
Draco's leg bent, causing his foot to shift a bit to the side. When he tried to move it back towards mine, something seemed to stop him. I frowned, Draco's shoe was met with an invisible wall right before he could touch me. Instead of getting sceptical, he just capitulated after another attempt.
But Harry couldn’t just let Draco go, that was completely out of the question and even if everyone would think he was insane, he had to put his trust in this theory. He couldn’t think of anything better, so now all that was missing was Draco and his blood. Then he was practically already on the way to the Great Lake. He could only hope that the waterspirit wouldn’t demand something in return again.
Draco rolled his eyes, pushed Harry away a bit, but stumbled after him because Harry reflexively wrapped his arms around him. "And how do you propose we do that?", Draco began, not really averse to the fact that his body was clinging to Harry's. "We can't just sneak into our room. Aside from the fact that we don't have the time, someone’s bound to catch us."
"All right. Let's talk about it," he began and Harry was suddenly glad of his position, at least he didn't have to look at Draco while they were talking. "Knickers. May I ask how you came up with that?"
So Harry grabbed the reins, smashed his calves against Hetja's flank and followed the path Draco had taken. It was the same path they had taken when they had ridden to the lake. Harry spurred Hetja on, the mare fell into a gentle tölt that allowed Harry to move forward quickly and not simply slide off her back at the same time.
A faint smile appeared on Draco's lips and he lifted a hand to trail a fingertip along my cheek. Despite the barrier preventing it, I felt the ghost of his touch against my skin.
. But his stare definitely had something perfidious. Actually, thinking about it, it wasn't the staring that was the problem, but the absolutely incomprehensible
His lips were slightly parted, if Harry had leaned in just a little, he would have felt Draco's hot breath on his skin. The tip of Draco's tongue wet his lips and Harry became dizzy. This tongue was like a well-protected treasure. When one got to see it, it was exciting. To
He learns that Neville has been teaching his own classes since the new school year and no longer only assists Prof. Sprout in Herbology. In addition, he pursues his own studies of plants with healing properties, which they obtain by creating light shows to attract small fairies who then build their nests in the blossoms and imbue them with the required magic.
"I - I'm sorry you had to witness that," Blaise tried again, Harry eyed him briefly. Blaise seemed to mean it, even though he really had no reason to apologize. "This hasn't happened for a long time."
"It might be helpful to include someone close to Mr Waters," Isaksen assists and slides the piece of parchment across the desk.
"I need to do this," Harry says, looking determinedly at her. "I have the stone. To give up now would be madness."
this is? I feel like I can't do a single thing because anything I could do would result in losing him." He sighs and kicks the snow harder. "Merlin, I'm pathetic."
Fair enough. That made sense. But how could one have feelings for someone without knowing about them? Was that even possible? A fast-beating heart, shallow breath or sweaty hands were all signs that were hard to miss! On the other hand, Harry was not sure if Draco was the type for the classic physical reactions to love. Perhaps a Malfoy took these feelings differently than the rest of the world.
Draco sighed, ran his fingers through his hair in frustration, then shook his head as if he had finally come to a solution. “I don't believe a word you say. Neither would you dare to go to that lake again at night, nor would you tell anyone about me except your beloved friends. Chivalry is your curse and my blessing, Potter!”
, Harry pleaded silently when nothing was moving, but then he felt a warm breath, long fingers closing around him and something moist wrapping around his tip.
"May I help you with something, Potter?" Draco asked, leaning far too casually against the bathroom door frame. It almost seemed as if it wasn't news to him to be stared at with fascination.
Blaise laughed, ignored the silent bitterness in Harry's voice and looked at him amused. "Draco calls me Blaise whenever we're alone. He calls you Harry when it's just the two of you, doesn't he?"
Mr Potter stares at the man in disbelief. For a few seconds, only the ticking of the clock is audible, but then Mr Potter's expression brightens a little. "You're joking. It's a joke," he says as if he has the power to decide that.
Hermione's eyes find Ron's and Harry allows it without interfering. The two share a bond that Harry understands even less than love itself, and he trusts that Ron has enough faith in Hermione for the both of them.
Hermione embraces Harry more, talks to him about the seriousness of the situation and that he must exercise patience. Her words sound reasonable, so Harry clings to them. When Hermione offers, Harry places a hand on her stomach and talks to her about parenting advice books, the advice of which Hermione doubts but nevertheless devours each one with interest. Those are the best moments of the day.
The bathroom door was opened and closed again, Harry held his breath. Draco walked nimbly to his bed, a rustle sounded. If Harry was right, Draco changed his clothes. Harry smiled in the darkness at the images that flashed before his inner eye but kept his eyes closed. Oh, how he
Harry pinched his lips together and concentrated on not looking at Draco in awe. What kind of desire was he referring to? The desire to proposition himself or the desire to…? No, there was no point in worrying about it. It was strange enough as it was. “And what do you expect me to do when you… proposition yourself to me?” He could hardly ignore it and the constant running away made no sense in the long run.
Healer Isaksen greets Malfoy, inquires about his condition and receives monosyllabic answers. Harry keeps a little distance, standing with Jimar until the Healer has cast her spells and finally signals her permission to get closer. Presently, everyone in Malfoy's immediate vicinity is at a certain risk, as was explained to Harry at length.
The grey eyes wide-open, the mouth slightly agape, the skin chalky pale, Draco instinctively took a few steps back. No, God,
Malfoy did not sound particularly angry. Rather resolute and uncompromising. For once, I completely sympathised with him. He had every right to be upset after what I had accused him of. His composure was, at best, a surprise. One that I would accept.
Draco seemed to understand it even without my words, for he lowered his gaze to his interlocked fingers. "I ask you to do your utmost, nonetheless. Not for ... this, but for me." He raised his head. "For the one I have become and could still become. My diary may one day be my salvation, but for that to be the case, it must remain intact."
Something buzzed in his trouser pocket and Draco jerked so violently that he almost bumped into a Muggle who was pushing past him to climb the stairs leading to the Land of the Unblessed. She had the audacity to glare at
It was almost fascinating how easily Draco's body received Harry's finger, a little as if this was nothing completely new to him. Harry's erection twitched painfully at the thought of a masturbating Draco inserting his fingers into his arse. The image was hot, but nothing compared to the feeling of
After the lunch break and more work that Harry would be able to perform even in his sleep by now, he calls it a day at six o'clock on the dot. He strolls down Diagon Alley, helps Nellie to prepare the owls and her shop for the night, and then returns to his cosy flat, exhausted but thoroughly content.
Paralysing sadness takes hold of his mind and proves difficult to shake off. Harry cannot help but wonder how, after all the losses he has experienced, he is still taken by them and never learns to correctly assess the power of his feelings. What grief does to him, he underestimates every time.
"I'm not wondering why you're here." Malfoy's voice sounds toneless, but not in the least like the composed manner Harry is used to from him. No, he seems entirely and genuinely disinterested in his concern.
"She's not well, but alive," Potter said, reappearing next to them. His gaze lowered to the mobile phone display, he cursed under his breath. Then he handed the phone back to Weasley and rubbed his forehead stressed. The dark hair fell a little to one side, exposing the pale scar on Potter's forehead. Nothing more than a scratch, but placed in such a way that Draco found it difficult not to stare.
Draco sighed, running his fingers through his blond hair and after what felt like an eternity, let go of Harry's aching wrist. “All right, play along now, Potter! What would you call the shape that I embody in the water?”
I settled on the edge of the bed and rubbed my throbbing forehead. Draco just continued to watch me, waiting, his face too expressionless to interpret what he was thinking. I wondered if he had trained himself to wear that expression, if it too was just one of the many masks he had acquired to cope with his return to the magical community.
Jimar opens the door to his office for him and Harry passes the threshold without hesitation. When he discovers that the wall has already been turned into a glass front and provides a view of Malfoy's room, he falters and Jimar almost stumbles into him.
Draco interrupted him and began to take off his shorts. Too fascinated to do something else, Harry watched him. Under his shorts, Draco wore a touch of
the youthful hormones that spurred his heart to pump blood to areas that were supposed to be asleep at this hour.
"But I feel like I have to." Hermione leans forward in her chair and looks at Harry pleadingly. "Because sometimes I don't think you realise how badly you cling to stability and structure. I don't want to upset you by confronting you, I just want you to think about it and consciously decide if you think it's healthy."
“I’m not even going to ask,” added Hermione, looking at her boyfriend calculatingly. Harry couldn’t help but grin. “You look great though, Harry. Malfoy will be eating out of your hand!”
"Where are we going?" whispered Ron to Harry, who followed the others through the entrance hall of the guesthouse and headed for the exit. The others chattered excitedly, already speculating about which pony they had been assigned.
“By Merlin, Harry! It’s the only way to not put you at risk and still show you that I trust you,” Draco exclaimed, looking seriously
“Do I want to know where your sudden death wish comes from?” asked Ron, who gave up pulling at Harry’s blanket and settled down on the edge of the bed with a sigh. Inwardly, he prepared to skip breakfast. With a little luck, Hermione would be able to secure him something.
I stopped in front of a glass cabinet. The glass seemed to soften the magical pull and, for a change, I did not feel as if I was going to stumble into the frame and thus into the memory the second I looked at the photographs. I furrowed my brows and attempted to decipher the dates of the individual picture frames more or less successfully.
I dared to open my eyes when Snape ordered me in an ice-cold voice to wait for him while he took Draco to the Hospital Wing. With my heart pounding painfully, I followed Snape as he steadied Draco and took him to the Hospital Wing as quickly as possible. The hallway I followed them down had morphed into the sixth floor the second they had set foot in it.
“Tonight is good. Then we’ll have some more preparation time,” agreed Harry, cursing his cheeks that didn’t want to get any cooler and noticed Draco’s questioning look. “Well, you know. Showering, shaving and stuff like that.” Oh, God. Why did Draco look so sceptical, and why was Harry getting redder and redder? “I mean my face! Shaving my face... Unless you want me to...” Harry broke off because he’d definitely put his foot in his mouth and his face could compete with a tomato. He wasn’t
"Unless you come across clues concerning the curse," Healer Isaksen adds without looking at Harry. She adjusts her glasses and makes a note on the clipboard in her hands.
The day went by incredibly fast. Their riding lesson included learning the different riding figures with Ms Vector and was surprisingly much fun. Harry even did quite well and Ron mastered the tasks with ease. In the afternoon the horse-tack-cleaning lesson was continued, but Draco was still missing. Harry's shoulder still hurt from time to time and he couldn't help wondering if Draco’s thigh hurt as well. In any case, it didn't stop the blond from training with Feykir.
"Harry, I –" Draco soon started panting and Harry needed no invitation to stop moving. He straightened up, helped Draco to free his legs from his trousers and pants. For a moment, Harry just stared fascinated between Draco's legs. More precisely, at the red erection that lay heavy on his stomach and twitched with delight under the undivided attention. Harry's gaze landed on Draco's face, his cheeks were at least as red, although he was clearly trying to look unconcerned under Harry's gaze.
Anja glances again at the clock, which conveniently hangs just above the heads of the Aurors. The hand has moved one place forward, which means that Mr Potter is now seventeen minutes late and is presumably very much indifferent to the lives of others.
Draco's eyes were closed, his mouth slightly opened, he had stopped the grinding of their bodies as if he had forgotten it and he wasn't breathing. As Harry moved his finger a little deeper, he gasped for air and moaned softly. Harry watched him captivated, eager to observe every change in his face and moved his finger deeper one last time, as deep as this angle would allow.
Malfoy briefly looked around meaningfully and then directly at me again. "My diary or Hogwarts, depending on what your question was referring to. Why are you here?"
Nellie pats Harry firmly on the back. "Don't worry about it, Owlington. You've already saved us all. Your quota is fulfilled."
Fortunately for him, Sirius saved him from his torment. "Oh, by the way, Harry, they're asking for you in the dining hall. Mrs Longbottom wants to announce the afternoon's activity."
Hermione threw Pansy a calculating look, then shrugged. "Mr Lockhart is good at making it seem like he knows what he's doing. But if you look closely at what Draco and Feykir
“Sore muscles?” Harry asked, gesturing to Draco's right arm and hoping that Draco would finally get the hint.
"That has hereby changed," Draco lets him know, disengaging his hand from Pup, who raises his head in protest. "You don't mind if I take a look around in the meantime, do you? Or if I listen to this extraordinarily exquisite choice of song?"
, because the blush of anger rose on his face while the right side of his upper lip twitched ominously. “I’m trying to save your bloody life and you dare to call me uncooperative? Charming, Potter!”
"No, the spell only works in one direction," Jimar explains helpfully. "His room is right next to this one, so we can see and hear him, but he can't do either the other way around unless we let him.”
Harry felt a hurricane of emotions brewing inside him and cursed Hermione mentally that she had to bring this up right now. He knew all this. He had also lost one or two thoughts about it, but it was absolutely impossible for him to decide against saving Draco. And yes, much of that was due to his
Mr Waters and Healer Isaksen shake his hand and while Mr Waters continues to stare spellbound at the leather-bound book on the desk like a hawk, the Healer informs him that Malfoy is already able to lie awake in his bed for several hours at a time. Harry wonders if this is supposed to be good or bad news and just nods, which seems like the best solution.
"That wasn't my work. You should thank Draco Malfoy," Harry replies, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Human beings who deserved life just like anyone else! But of course, your small-minded brain can't comprehend that. You've never been able to do anything but parrot what your vain father preached to you. Did it ever
," a clear, cheerful voice chanted through the hallway of the first floor, followed by a knock at their room door.
With quick steps Harry rushed straight for Draco, feeling his heart beating hard against his chest and his breathing getting shallower. He stopped only a few inches away from Draco, who turned his head, perplexed. With a cheeky smile, Harry grabbed Draco’s toothbrush and before he could protest, he put it in his mouth.
In surreality, there was neither no reason nor a reason to do things. Nothing mattered because it had no bearing on anything. I did not kiss Malfoy out of affection. It was everything inside me urging me not to lose the feeling of sweet reality, to keep the ground beneath my feet. If pain did not help me achieve that, maybe this would.
Harry closes his eyes and concentrates on the incantation Draco showed him. "If the spell is performed successfully, the constellation of the dragon will present itself on the skin," Draco had explained to him. "For my mother, it blossomed on her left forearm. My dragon appears above my heart."
Oh, God, but that also meant he was the only arsehole. Though he doubted that Draco would have forgiven him even if he'd told him sooner. He might not have opened up to Harry in the first place if he hadn't allowed the trust to grow. Harry felt so stupid, so unbelievably stupid, that he hadn't thought about how problematic this bet could become.
An amused smile tugged at Draco’s lips as he evidently thought about whether he should give in to this childishness. But then he reached out for Harry’s hand, grabbed it and shook it lightly. Before Draco could pull his hand back, Harry’s grip tightened and he turned Draco’s hand so that the back pointed upwards. Harry didn’t let himself think about this too much, he just pulled the pale fingers to his lips and placed gentle kisses on the soft skin, always careful to look Draco in the eyes. Ron would certainly be oddly proud of Harry now. That was flirting on a
"Yesterday, at this time, a convict of the wizarding prison Azkaban was admitted to us with severe internal injuries."
Frantically and with trembling hands, we took off our clothes, he removed my glasses and only seconds later we found ourselves in a tight embrace. My lips moved against Draco's with desire and his legs wrapped tightly around my waist. His body pressed against mine, the warmth of his skin and the cool sand against my legs creating tingling goosebumps that only mirrored what was going on inside me. Desire and longing finally being fulfilled with satisfaction.
The kitchen of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place smells deliciously of lemon, melted butter and sugar. Harry takes the third tray of freshly baked lemon tartlets out of the oven, sets them on a rack to cool, and then swiftly reaches for the freshly mixed batter to prepare another tray. Over the weekend he did nothing but bake and rack his brain over old, incoherent memories concerning the Elder Wand. He is none the wiser, but dozens of lemon tartlets richer.
"Your relationship with your past is incredibly complex," Hermione continues unabated. "It's taken you years to find something that makes you feel safe, but you know yourself how unstable that structure is. As soon as something challenges your view of the world or tries to intrude into your protected everyday life, that sense of security also disappears. You never told us exactly what happened at the end of August and why you suddenly went into a depressive phase again –"
There is more of Draco's magic, far more than in Draco's body, embedded in a book to which it has given heart and charm. Harry bites his tongue painfully as he extends his magic, like feelers, towards the open source.
Hermione rolls her eyes and leaves the room with Harry. As instructed, they make their way to the kitchen and wait there silently for Ron. However exuberant Ron's mood may be, there is a dreary weight on Harry's shoulders, lightened only by the fact that he now knows that Hermione and Ron are willing to help him. But without Draco's consent, that fact is moot.
threatened with murder. So it's probably wise to never threaten anyone with anything, but it wasn't as if Draco was interested in what people thought of him.
I wondered if Malfoy would have continued to build his walls if he had not been convicted. Whether he would have abandoned this world one day, just as I had, or would have lost himself in the game. He would have lost the game, that much was certain. The Ministry had never treated Malfoy with respect, no matter his behaviour towards them. I also wondered if Malfoy knew about the tactless nickname the Aurors had given him. Whether he knew that even today he was referred to as their "gullible easy-nark". I kept these questions to myself, however.
“My mother told me that the ring holds the curse’s condition. It currently gives me the ability to transform myself into a human, but with my birthday it loses its effect,” Draco explained in a purring voice, if that mer-creature voice could be described as such.
"We’d normally need a post hole driver, it’s going to take forever with the sledgehammer," Harry thought aloud as he pulled the plastic post out of the ground and replaced it with the wooden post.
Finally, Harry landed on the right page. He lifted his head, grinned triumphantly at Draco and cleared his throat exaggeratedly. “I hereby present my plan to your highborn wateriness!” he began pompously and couldn't stop his satisfied smile. “As you have already mentioned, I owe my life to your highborn wateriness, so consider this debt as settled after this service!”
Letting his frustration run free, Harry drew back, grabbed one of Draco’s hands and pushed it to his crotch where his rock-hard erection was hard to ignore. “That’s what you do to me with your
"– And ended with Sex on the Beach," Draco finished Hermione's sentence dryly. Hermione threw an uncertain look at him, but Draco didn't seem set on quarrelling, so she smiled vaguely.
Harry didn't like the idea that one of them was Draco's true love. He didn't like having to worry about it either, but his darn
"Well," Draco began slowly, his fingers ghosting gently over Harry's skin southwards towards his bottom. "It could be that I was looking for the
“No. It subsides when we do this,” Draco interrupted him and pulled him back into a kiss. It was an amazingly exhilarating compliment, which Harry gladly accepted. He wanted to be the reason why Draco’s pain eased and to know that was delightful. Was that reason enough to raise some hopes in Draco? Once again Harry sighed into Draco’s lips, which fitted so perfectly and warmly on his.
After some time, however, he is able to convince himself to let go of Draco and smile at him expectantly through the mirror. "What do you think?"
"Potter," Malfoy breathed. I wondered when we had ended up so close and why he did not push me off him. "Potter, I –"
Before Ron left the room, he turned once more in the doorway and beamed at them. "Don't hurt yourselves, boys!" And then the door slammed shut.
Hermione shoots Ron an irked look. "The Elder Wand has changed ownership dozens of times without murder or manslaughter being involved."
Harry sighed and ran his hand through his hair; that didn't develop into an explanation, so he had to go all in. “All right, but where do you sneak off to at night?" Harry didn't think it was wise to tell Draco that he knew very well
Firmer than Harry could have expected from those thin fingers and he screamed. Loud and panicked, even though the end of the scream was swallowed by the water that surged around him.
Draco rolled his beautiful grey eyes, let go of his hair and climbed over Harry's body on all fours. Fascinated, Harry lost himself for a moment in the sight of the alluring lingerie, which smoothly adapted to each of Draco's movements. Hell, did Draco have any idea how seductive and delicious he looked? When Draco turned around and presented Harry his pale arse, he decided to show it to him.
So I completely surrendered to the sensation of touching and being touched. I allowed soft gasps to leave my lips at regular intervals and relished Draco's moans, which rose as soon as my tongue flicked his nipples or my hands drifted down Draco's body, between his legs.
He felt a hand on his shoulder. Ron, who spoke soothing words to Harry. Harry couldn't hear them, but his numbness steadily decreased. He wanted to run after Draco immediately, but what was he supposed to say? What was there
Draco's head turned to Weasley, and he felt the redhead's calculating look on him. In an instant, he regretted not listening to Potter to fix his hair. Weasley looked as if he knew exactly what they had done just five minutes ago.
Hermione gave him a grumpy look. "Pride comes before a fall, Malfoy! And if I remember correctly, my team won last year which puts me a year ahead of you!"
After Harry had cautiously shared his plan with him that very same Sunday evening, he presented an intriguing mixture of angry and sulky for the next two days. He does not exchange a single word with Harry, smokes nonstop and only allows Pup closer than two feet to him. On Wednesday, his anger visibly fades, but he continues to distance himself. The only difference is that Harry now senses worried, almost remorseful stares at his back, as opposed to the previous rage-filled ones.
Since Harry suspected that the normal way back to the castle would only bring the tormented mood even further down, they used the secret passage from the Hog’s Head Inn to the Room of Requirement, which awakened uncomfortable memories in Harry. The way was faster, and besides, Harry didn’t feel compelled to talk. The Room of Requirement was just a simple rectangular room that offered nothing but its exit, which was also their entrance to Hogwarts. Harry stopped on the 7th floor, opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. No teacher or Filch far and wide, fate was kind to them.
Lockhart. He is a terrible riding instructor, but his father insists that Draco be taught by him at least once a week. Don't ask me what he's thinking. The man has about as much understanding of horses as a potato has brains."
at the end of the day. How he had been able to forget that, was a mystery to him. Harry yearned to dig his fingers into the skin and never let go. His body was more than excited by the idea, which meant for Harry that it was about time to get into the water before his enthusiasm became even clearer.
Malfoy had accompanied me as I visited memories that had shown him in his childhood and early youth. I had watched the little boy skipping through the park in front of Malfoy Manor and chasing the peacocks, had plopped down beside him on the lawn, and had joined him in watching the red and black Orandas swim in the pond.
He checked for himself during the days he spent at Draco's bedside. The book is as empty as it was when Harry last slammed it shut. All that is to be found in it is proof that Harry has not simply imagined the last few months. Instead of Draco's memories, Harry's name adorns the yellowed pages. If a stranger had skimmed the contents, it might have looked like a crush.
Harry groans and closes his eyes in agony. He concentrates entirely on keeping his breathing regular, despite it seeming like an impossibility. The cold only pierces his skin more relentlessly, leaving nothing but pain. Draco's hands wrapped around his provide the sole comfort, but soon Harry loses all feeling and with it his light in the darkness. The shivering eases.
"It’s better to give him some time," Weasley said, and Draco felt that his feelings and emotions had to be written clearly on his face if even Weasley interpreted them correctly.
"Draco, wait!" Harry's breath was racing, his heart was pounding and he could hear the blood in his ears. He was
"Have you noticed that your room is much bigger than mine," Ron asked, dropping his travel bag onto one of the two beds, which stood against opposite walls.
Near the stables, Harry recognised blond hair. Draco Malfoy, who fled with big steps from a girl with shoulder-length black hair. He seemed... nice? Harry smiled to himself. Draco didn't seem to be somebody’s fool and besides, he was rather pretty to look at. The first impression had perhaps been a little mixed, but there was no reason to be concerned. Draco Malfoy was surely a nice man. Yes, definitely.
Harry has no answer to that, so he watches Draco pet Pup and tickle him between the toes for a while. His cat never even flinches, which borders on an actual miracle. Harry does not mind that Pup has immediately taken a liking to Draco. In fact, he likes it. Pup has always been a champion at seeking out lonely souls and providing them with a bit of healing.
Anja has come to expect Mr Potter's opinion to be this. She frankly does not care, though. She looks over to the bed as well, observes the pale hand that has slid slightly from the edge of the bed and now dangles freely in the air. Even from her position, she can count the dark blue veins that appear on the whiteness of the skin. It looks sallow and grey, like that of a frail, elderly man.
Returning the grin, Draco raised a challenging eyebrow. “Apart from the fact that you’re supposed to be at the lake
wanted me to be the one to tell you," Harry tries, unable to keep his voice from taking on an accusatory tone. "You told me about her, about the French saying she lived by and –"
Harry nods at her, despite only listening with half an ear. She bids farewell to everyone – there are other patients she has to heal as well. Filly and Jimar stay behind. Harry feels suddenly uncomfortable being the only one sitting in a chair, but his lingering exhaustion forces him not to move his limbs. He glances at Jimar, who winks at him with a grin. For what reason, Harry is not sure, but he musters a smile.
I rested my arms on the tabletop, which caused Malfoy to straighten up and back away a few inches. "Are you here because you don't want me rummaging through your memories alone?"
Harry wakes up, freezing and with a sore neck, as something firmly but gently rubs his back. He flinches, reflexively groping for his wand under his pillow, but there is neither pillow nor wand. Instead, a soft voice whispers words of reassurance. A shiver climbs down his spine and he allows Draco to guide him to his bed, still half asleep.
Sluggishly, Draco turns his head towards Harry. "About what? About the fact that you always listen to the same composers and variety doesn't seem to be a familiar concept to you?"
Harry's head snaps around in surprise to Ginny, who grins jauntily at him and proceeds to nonchalantly wrap an arm around Harry's shoulders. Relieved on the one hand and no less unrelaxed on the other, Harry welcomes her arrival from the bottom of his heart. He hates Ministry events. He has not a clue why he let himself be convinced to even consider Ginny's invitation.
Harry opens his mouth, but no sound passes his lips, so he merely shakes his head in disbelief and vaguely motions with his hand.
The kiss was sluggish and unfocused as Harry's hips sought a steady rhythm and the captivating feeling clouded his perception. Draco moaned uninhibitedly on Harry's lips, further intoxicating his senses, and wrapped both arms around his neck to prevent him from straightening up. Harry was unable to do so anyway, all he could concentrate on were Draco's lips, his warm tightness and the feeling of the lace and straps under his fingers as they skimmed up and down Draco's body.
"That's no tone to talk to your superior with," Arthur reprimands with amusement, winking at him before heading back towards the door. "The organising may as well be postponed until Monday. With the hustle and bustle out there, it won't be a bother."
Draco repeated the refusing sound, opening his eyes to reach for one of the billion (There were five, not a billion) bottles of shampoo and shower cream. While Draco pumped some of the soap on his hand, he eyed Harry out of the corner of his eye. The black-haired man could
Harry clung to the silk blanket that lay somewhere beside them, only to resist the urge to grab Draco and touch every inch of his body. But the feeling between his legs definitely provided a skilful distraction and wiped every thought from Harry’s mind. He could only feel the heat boiling in his body, the lust that coursed through his veins and would’ve made him go blind if he hadn’t already had poor vision anyway.
Ron's visits become less frequent, though not completely cancelled due to their weekly dinner. The fact that this is the result of the renewed visits to St Mungo's Hospital is not a secret to Ron either. He takes it with humour, rejoices in the fact that Harry's mood is gaining stability and only jokingly acts as the stood-up lover. On Harry's remark that he has a pregnant wife sitting next to him, Ron boldly suggests that he has every reason to be jealous regardless, as even a blind observer would notice that Harry's dates with Malfoy are becoming rampant.
Draco chuckled, leaned in and breathed a kiss to Harry's lips. "Oh right, I distinctly remember your cock inside me. I must have seemed
Harry flinched a little, Draco's voice was unusual every time it sounded in his head and didn't come out of the blond wizard's mouth.
Harry froze in his position, only raising his head in surprise to look at Draco. He fumbled awkwardly at the end of his wand and pressed a fist against his temple. He cursed quietly and incomprehensibly as he moved his arse a few centimetres away from Harry.
How can it be so easy for the two of them to see Malfoy in a neutral light without having had any point of contact with him? Harry had not been like that, he had clung to his old picture of Malfoy, had to convince himself that it did not correspond to reality and only believed it when he had no other choice.
"Mr Potter, we believe there are clues to Mr Malfoy's curse in this diary," Anja explains patiently.
"Once upon a time – All right, I can't take this seriously. I'll just tell you... normally." Harry bit his tongue to keep from laughing, the beginning had already gone rather poorly.
He sets his eyes on the snow-covered ground again and tries to match the various footprints to the respective Weasleys. He is most certain, however, about the one he thinks is Teddy's. There is a small dragon on the sole of his shoe, which was the only reason Teddy really wanted the boots. The imprint is clearly visible in the snow.
A good hour had passed and Ron, Harry and Hermione had joined Blaise and Draco at the breakfast table after the morning pony-tending routine. The others were in high spirits, they all talked about the night and the planned party. Especially Pansy's and Seamus' voice echoed excitedly through the whole dining hall.
Was it supposed to be something personal or banal, like his favourite colour? Not that he had one, but he could definitely enumerate which colours he
. As expected, the door jumped open, Harry almost fell when he stumbled through it. He couldn’t embarrass himself any more in front of Draco anyway, so it didn’t matter. His heart was pounding hard against his chest, just one more small step, then –
His gaze fell in disbelief at the blond man, who was up to his shoulders in the water and only had one hand on the rock he must have hoisted Harry onto. Harry blinked faster, straightened up slowly, got his breath back and continued to stare incredulously at Draco. Something seemed to have changed about him, but Harry was too confused to be able to pin it down to any detail.
Draco sighed, raised his head and Harry opened his eyes to look at him. So much remorse, so much guilt was reflecting in the clear grey. "You promised me you wouldn't look at me differently."
AND THERE'S MORE ART! The lovely Pauleonotis (on Tumblr) DREW OUR PRETTY MER!DRACO! (He's sososo pretty) AND she drew the BEST scene because Draco is saving Harry's arse and that's just a nice scene XD
Draco cocked an eyebrow in surprise, then a mischievous smile blossomed on his face. His gaze drifted down Harry's body and when he looked up again, he grinned. "And you have a really beautiful cock."
Jimar smiles encouragingly at Harry. Something about the look on his face reveals that he senses Harry's lack of sleep and his inner tension. Harry does not know why this does not bother him, but for the moment he is simply grateful that Jimar is sitting opposite him and that neither Healer Isaksen nor Auror Filly is present.
He has taken a path that involves risk but is worthwhile at the same time. He is balancing on the fine line between what he built to protect himself from his own past and the pain that comes with it, and the eye of the storm. It is doomed to fail and yet turning back is the furthest thing from Harry's mind.
Fascinated, Harry watched the play of lights on Draco’s skin, couldn’t stop touching him until a soft sigh made him freeze. Draco didn’t move, didn’t make another sound, probably had only dreamed and sighed, no reason for Harry to – Oh, for God’s sake,
"I think I know," Harry began, silently admonishing his heart to remain calm. "You have every right to be angry with me. I want to explain it to you anyway. Please, let me explain."
Harry stopped the movements of his hand and struggled to keep his breath unconcerned. He had known that Draco
But Harry didn't wait. He walked into their bathroom and closed the door behind him. This was going to be an exquisite day. There was no other possibility at all when it had started with Draco's speechlessness.
Draco growled and gave Harry a scathing look. Harry bit his lower lip to keep himself from making an equally sharp comment. Draco was afraid, so Harry could forgive him for reacting like that. Surely, he didn’t need a fight at the moment, perhaps rather the opposite?
Mr Potter steps closer to the glass and shoves his hands into his trouser pockets. He looks over to the bed where Mr Malfoy is lying, his bright eyes fixed on the ceiling, and remains silent.
Some sort of synapse blew in Harry's brain. He couldn't even explain why, but the mere sight of Draco in a
"You know what?" Ron asks the room as he rises lightly to his feet. "I've got an idea and you have to do what I say because I've got about an hour and thirteen minutes left for my birthday." Irritated, Hermione and Harry exchange a look, but follow Ron's lead and rise.
Inside him, determination battles down his guilt and he frantically makes a decision at that very moment.
!" Draco just shook his head. Hermione looked as if she was completely overwhelmed and at the same time immensely amused, but then actually intervened and tried to explain something about rising trot to Ron.
Only Draco's expression resembles how Harry feels inside. Eyes wide, he stares alternately at Hermione and then back at Harry. If he is aiming to offer Harry any sort of reassurance, he fails utterly.
I nodded and Draco's expression became determined. Without changing his posture much, he scooted to my side, looked me firmly in the eye and straightened his shoulders.
I had only once dared to ask a question about the diary, which Malfoy had indeed answered, but not very helpfully. I had wanted to know why he had created it, what purpose it served. Malfoy had replied that as soon as he had been able to hold a quill, he had begun to record his memories. He had even written down the ones he could remember from his younger years. Back then he had believed that one day he would publish them as his memoirs; when that dream had perished, he had kept it up merely out of habit. Malfoy had not been able to answer the question of why he had stopped and I could only speculate that it had been because of his conviction.
the waterspirit interrupted Draco and if the dark rumble had allowed it, one would certainly have detected mockery from the sound of the voice.
Possibly it had been his own compulsion, in which he had felt trapped, that had opened his eyes. I did not know enough about it, Malfoy withheld all the memories relating to our sixth year, from me. We had dealt mostly with those memories that demonstrated how he had changed. But there were others too, the ones that merely confirmed suspected qualities about him.
Startled, Draco whips around, but he visibly relaxes upon seeing Harry leaning in the doorway. "It's just you."
While the black-haired man put his trousers back in place with trembling hands, he managed to think about how much he wished he could touch Draco. Truly, without holding back. Then he wouldn’t blame himself so much that Draco apparently didn’t allow himself an orgasm with Harry. At the same time, Harry admonished himself that his selfishness had taken on immense proportions and he urgently needed to think about a plan to change Draco’s mind.
Of course, Harry owns not only the one recipe, but lemon tartlets are the ones that suit him best. He perfected them when he was trying to earn Nellie's favour, or more specifically when he learnt from Aurora that her mother had lost the family recipe for these very tartlets. The reason why he feels this insatiable urge to bake them over and over again is also beyond him. It may be due to the fact that he needs something to occupy him while he is thinking about the Elder Wand –
The further time went by, the more the “useless” stack piled up and the narrower the stack of still untouched books became. Slowly but surely Harry lost hope. Blood curses were clearly not designed to be broken, which only further complicated things.
“Aren’t you worried about your aloof image? Mr Ice-block himself is whispering sweet nothings! That too with his former nemesis! Where does this change of heart come from?” Harry scoffed, with a slight, somewhat reserved smile on his lips.
"Mate, there you are! I was about to go looking for you! You've got to call Sirius back! It's about Hedwig."
Mr Malfoy, appearing young and bright, was dressed in an elaborately embroidered cloak and engaged in an animated conversation with another wizard, whose neat clothes suggested that, although he wanted to make an impression, he was not half as well-heeled as the Malfoys. I could not understand what they were talking about. The voices were loud enough but distorted as if I were trying to listen to the radio without a working reception.
To suppress his smirk, Harry pinched his lips together and garnered only a raised eyebrow from Draco. “So why did you do it?”
Harry hurriedly shook his head and looked down at his toes. “No. I know it was dangerous. But you got your ring back, so everything went well.”
Draco scoffed and dropped his fork noisily onto the plate in front of him to cross his arms. "The only joke here is you."
Harry's heart grew heavy. His worst fears would come true. He didn't want Draco to go through that pain. There was a reason why he had repressed this memory, why his mind wanted to protect him from it! It was too much; it might throw off Draco's balance. It could tear him apart.
The tip of his wand hits the blank page of the diary and in curved letters, written in black ink, appear Harry's last words to a time that turned his life upside down:
Draco closed his eyes and nestled his head in Harry's hand while he answered. "I didn't want to be found."
Draco's tongue nudged invitingly against Harry's as if to remind him that it wanted to be noticed too, Harry didn't need to be asked twice and reaped a grateful sigh from Draco. Patience didn't seem to be Draco's strong point; it didn't take more than two minutes for Harry to feel one of Draco's hands sliding out of his hair and move unerringly to his crotch. The tingling in Harry's stomach area increased, additionally something deliciously sweet was pulling in his groins.
That the Aurors were indeed planning to destroy the diary I had learnt from Jimar. Robards explained his decision on the basis that it was a supposedly dangerous piece of evidence. I believed much more in the theory that the Aurors feared Malfoy would claim it before it was over with him. That he had not done this so far was akin to a miracle, but I blamed it on Healer Isaksen's eloquence, which seemed to bear fruit even with Malfoy.
. Harry knew he had tendencies to become possessive, but at that very moment, he would have liked nothing better than to cut off Viktor's fingers.
Together with Healer Isaksen, he leaves the room, pushing Malfoy's wheelchair ahead of him and straining not to think about how the others are doing. Whether everything is going according to plan. Or if any of them are in trouble.
Once again, Harry looked at the piece of parchment in front of him. Draco was still on the shore of the Great Lake. He hadn't moved an inch for the last quarter of an hour. Harry stepped out into the cool night air and pulled the invisibility cloak tighter around him. It wasn’t cold, but not warm enough to walk around in just a t-shirt. Harry walked at a fast pace along the small path leading to the Great Lake – and also to the forbidden forest, but Harry certainly didn't want to go there at this hour.
Malfoy straightened his legs, dangling them from his rock, and casually leaned backwards, resting his weight on his palms. "Interest. I've found that the answer can reveal quite a lot about a person."
Next to Aubrey's shrill voice, screeching a multitude of curses, there is another. It is warm and soft, like buttered caramel eaten in front of a burning fire. It is familiar and all Harry needs to feel completely safe.
Harry's jaw drops open, but he manages to collect himself as much as possible before he starts to speak. "Um, can I ... do something for you?"
She suspects that Mr Potter feels no sympathy for Mr Malfoy. They attended the same school, were in the same year, but not on the same side of the war, as evident from the mark on Mr Malfoy’s left forearm. Even though the war is now seven years in the past, Anja detects no healing in those old wounds. It may just be her instinct, but it is rarely wrong.
There had also been some pleasant events at St Mungo's Hospital in the past few weeks. Events that concerned Malfoy and others that did not. I had learnt from Jimar that an "attractive but scary-looking young woman with black hair" had requested visiting hours with Malfoy. Nobody had done that before, which was why Jimar had been particularly excited to report it. Still, visiting a prisoner in Azkaban was already a lengthy process; visiting prisoners housed in St Mungo's was almost an impossibility. Parkinson, however, had yet to give up.
"He stays in our high-security sector, as he is technically still a convict. We won't be able to talk to him, he's still too weak for that." Anja keeps her explanations concise.
"Granger never again mentioned the subject on her own initiative. She acted as if nothing had ever happened and I followed through. As if it was a mature decision. The anger, the remorse, the disappointment, we worked it all out, but in a completely passive way. It took months for the tension to wear off. Sometimes I still feel it today and then I forget who I am and only know who I was."
Harry huffs lightly, takes the woollen blanket Isaksen offers him and drapes it over Draco's legs. "At least you haven't lost your cattiness."
Draco raised an eyebrow sceptically and leaned back a little to eye Harry's face. "Are you sure? It would be fine if –"
Another thing that caused Harry's muscles to weaken. Draco had begun to call him by his first name. He didn't always do it, but every time he did, Harry's heart performed a joyful dance in his chest. And when he did it with an aroused sigh on his lips, Harry could feel himself falling even harder for him. It awakened the desire to cause the same feeling in Draco.
"Evening. Sleep well?" Draco asked, a smile emerging on his forbidden sweet lips. Harry grumbled something incomprehensible and pulled a bit of the blanket over his exposed centre. Draco chuckled again. "Nothing that I haven't seen before. No false modesty."
"You," Harry heard himself say instantly. He felt the heat in his cheeks straight away. "I mean, I was completely fascinated by you from the start, you can't tell me you didn't notice that!"
Harry frowned, he knew that expression and suspected the worst. He pushed Draco's hand away from his mouth, which immediately strayed onto Harry's lower back. "Spit it out!"
Harry just opened his mouth to give a half-hearted explanation when he spotted Draco entering the Great Hall with his friends to have a very late breakfast. He fell silent because Seamus noticed the Slytherin group as well and suddenly grinned knowingly.
"Is this about control? Is it important for you to have control over the situation or me?" Draco continued unperturbed and Harry's jaw dropped in surprise. He raised his head.
Draco was actually nobody one would call cute. His features weren't soft enough, his eyes weren't warm enough, his smile wasn't gentle enough, and his personality was definitely not heartwarming enough. But something about the way he wrinkled his nose, tilted his head or tried to hide an amused smile was indeed cute.
It took Parkinson a few seconds before she slowly raised her head and stared at Malfoy out of wide, astonished eyes. "You ... don't think I'm repulsive?"
"You know," Draco began softly by his ear suddenly. "If you really want me to, I'll call you Harry in front of the others as well. All it takes is one question."
He was just about searching for a new T-shirt in his wardrobe when the door flew open and Draco entered the room with a tortured expression on his face. He paid no further attention to Ron's presence, took off one of his riding boots while he was still walking and then stopped in mid-movement, as soon as he noticed Harry, who was still standing in front of his wardrobe shirtless.
obvious when the two of them even spoke to him about it. How does one tell one’s best friends that one was absolutely unwilling to talk about one’s first time, which would also save one’s partner from an eternal curse, an eternal curse that one had put on oneself and from which one had to be saved as well? “Okay, thank you.”
Draco dunked the tip of his quill into his inkpot, pausing briefly before starting a new sentence in his essay. “No, neither of them.”
His name was called at the same moment he was pushed backwards onto the Steps of Inferno by the scowling Muggle. It was also the moment he lost control of his muscles and, with a decisive twitch of his hand, dropped all three ice cream cones onto the Muggle's shirt.
"Maybe I’m just the better student," he murmured tiredly, for which he got a smack in his side from Ron. Harry just laughed.
And he never had to. As the two also won their next rounds against Neville and Blaise and Seamus and Dean. Hell, this ambition was apparently contagious and that the others were at least as happy for them was intoxicating. Harry could barely feel his legs, his breath was irregularly fast, the sand was sticking to his skin and yet Draco fell into his arms as he slipped off Andvari's back for the last time, leaving them the only team to win all three rounds.
It took Harry a moment to comprehend what Draco wanted to know from him, but then he felt himself nodding before he could lose too many thoughts about it. "Of course, I do. As long as you want it too.”
"You're brilliant. Utterly brilliant. And I have to go. I –" He doesn't know where to put all his words and the big bubble in his chest containing nothing but hope.
He desperately tries to swallow the lump in his throat, watches Malfoy's teeth digging into his lower lip. The thin cloth blanket Malfoy has dragged up to his chin moves slightly and is hastily folded back the next moment.
Harry nods, praying that his elated heartbeat is not reflected in his expression. He moves to face Draco, draws his wand and holds out his hand to him. "It's better if I use the spell more often anyway. Hopefully, that will buy us more time."
Whatever Draco was talking about it took too long and he urgently needed to do something better with his lips. For example, he could kneel before Harry, unzip his fly, pull his trousers down and...
This time Harry sighed both in his mind voice and in reality. That was bad. Very bad. The Healer had warned them that this could happen. Draco had repressed this memory, but they had never been able to pinpoint the exact time it had happened.
He knows now what is different about Malfoy. It is not his illness, his age or his lack of passion. It is the fact that he is not the Draco Malfoy he has come to know. He is a different person and one that Harry cannot fathom.
Harry does not leave the room nor Draco's side, even when his two best friends find him hours later and offer him loving words. Harry continues to kneel on the cold floor, holding Draco's warm hand in his and listening to dozens of assurances that Draco is only asleep, that he will wake up when he is ready.
“Honestly, mate, just because you wouldn't like to see them with Malfoy doesn't mean he wouldn't appreciate their company,” Ron noted, turning restlessly back and forth in his bed, but still unable to find a comfortable position.
Harry frowned, tracing the little white star on Hetja's forehead with his finger. "Not at all, to be honest. And you can call me Harry."
Harry didn't need an explicit invitation to follow him. His skin tingled slightly with joyful anticipation. He suspected what Draco wanted to hear from him and he was more than willing to give it to him. "Draco –" he started, but Draco stopped because he bumped the back of his knees against the lilac-coloured sofa that stood under the big window. Harry was now standing right in front of Draco and took a moment to lose himself in the deep grey.
"Bed," Draco commanded in a shaky voice. Harry nodded into the kiss, hurriedly pushed the blond off his lap and got up as well. He shoved Draco backwards to his bed and took their shirts off while he was still walking. Hell, it was
nothing special, but Harry sat on the small sofa that was placed opposite the bathroom door under a large window in their room and watched Draco as if he was holding the eighth wonder of the world in his hands.
I disliked the way, in his memories, he entered the ballrooms of Ministry events with an unfathomable matter-of-factness, shaking hands of people whose worth he had not conceded for years and conversing about matters that did not require his opinion.
At the moment it was Draco's words that captivated Harry. Draco didn’t speak to him and wasn’t close enough for Harry to understand exactly what he was talking about but the way he moved his lips was enough to make Harry stare.
“If you insist on calling it that, then yes. You have to understand, my mer-creature side, which is gaining power with every passing day, makes me want to respond to primitive instincts. Instincts, like the ones you got to see from the waterspirit.”
When Harry informs the Aurors of Draco's suspicions, the connections fall into place. With his help, the head of the snake can finally be identified and severed.
"It's king-size, you can't blame her." Draco shrugged, but then turned to Ron with a dangerous glint in his eye and a mischievous smile on his lips. "I'd be willing not to tell Granger about your little rendezvous if -"
Malfoy did not deserve to be saved. He did not deserve that kind of attention. He did not even deserve me conniving to gain his trust.
Harry wasn't sure what to think. That Draco had always been a beauty, he was happy to believe, but the rest was much more likely to bother him. Had Hermione and Viktor been in a relationship? Had Viktor cheated on Hermione with Draco? And Draco had only done it because he had been jealous of Hermione?
Harry's mouth was dry, he needed so much more than water. He needed Draco. He needed him right here, right now. Harry pressed his lips pleadingly against Draco's, while he clumsily took his own shorts off and panted as Draco bit his lower lip.
Harry had arrived at their meeting place on time. He had hardly slept a wink last night, but he felt more awake than ever before. The adrenaline coursed through his body, mixed with his excitement and his heart was beating in a fast rhythm, simply because Draco was standing close by, looking out at the lake with a worried expression on his face. Harry would have loved to  smooth away the worry lines from Draco’s forehead, but the worry lay deeper than just in his expression. Feelings couldn’t simply be wiped away; Harry knew that much by now.
Robards seems surprised by Harry's statement, for he frowns, and a resigned smile appears on his face. "You've learnt enough in your training to be up to the task. It's a book. How hard can reading possibly be?"
It seemed Malfoy had believed in something good he was heading towards, so he had not caved in and had not been afraid to move on. He had spoken of his aspirations for the future and despite the fact that I still caught myself questioning how Malfoy dared to have demands on his future, I credited him for his drive to survive. It sparked a dichotomy within me that I was able to come to terms with.
They listen to him attentively, merely exchanging their love-vow glances now and then. Harry chose to call them that because they doubled after the two of them got married just over a year ago. It is not that Harry is seriously bothered by them, it is just that sometimes he feels as if the two of them are communicating on a different level – one that Harry cannot keep up with.
Harry looked again into the dark eyes of his pony and gently stroked her nostrils. "She is so... pretty."
“You know,” Harry began, actually raising his head and leaning his forehead against Draco’s. “My luck has always been miles ahead of my recklessness. Your concern is unwarranted. I’ve taken worse risks than this.”
I could not bear to see the same sadness in his eyes that I was all too familiar with and averted my gaze and onto our feet, their sides still touching. "Shortly after your sentence was passed."
Harry hadn't married Draco because of his taciturnity and permissiveness. Therefore, he was little surprised when his husband sat down next to Harry on the petrol-coloured couch the next afternoon, crossed his legs, reached for the TV remote control, switched off the device and looked at Harry expectantly. For a few seconds, he was impressed that Draco could operate the television at all, but then he was reminded why Draco was looking at him with such expectancy.
" Draco rolled his eyes in Harry's direction, but then focused on self-control rather than a witty answer.
The creature stared at Harry, interested but also haughty. Harry cleared his throat in an attempt to regain his guts. “Um, hello.” For heaven's sake, was there a way for him to act any dumber?
and therefore also a Slytherin. A former one, at least. I should have objected, but for the life of me, I could not think of anything smarter to do than stay right where I was.
The twinkle in Draco's eyes turned dangerous. "No? Then why didn't you tell me about it? Not even after I told you –" Draco's breath faltered and he closed his eyes again in agony.
Draco raised an eyebrow inquiringly, but Harry felt Draco's tension leave his body as soon as they were alone. "Your best friend is a mystery unto himself."
His original plan to bring Draco’s ring to the waterspirit came back to his mind. That was his best and only shot at the moment, so he just had to start all over again, continuing his original mission: discreetly ask about the ring. Yes, he’d manage that. He just had to stop himself from blushing the next time he saw Draco half-naked. He would somehow manage.
Harry was again only a whisker away from a hysterical laugh, it caught in his throat as Draco leaned forward a little and sealed their lips. Snogging was
Harry wonders if it is even possible for Malfoy to sense that Harry entered his diary, but he keeps the question to himself. Ninety more minutes have now passed since his return, during which he has done nothing but rehash what has just happened, although he would clearly prefer some fresh air or his bed. But he understands why he continues to sit in a bleak office, painstakingly answering all the questions of those opposite him. Auror Filly cannot stop marvelling over the diary which seems to be a ‘truly unique magical object’. So it would not surprise him if Malfoy discovered a way to notice when uninvited guests enter his diary. Although Harry is not entirely uninvited.
Choked sounds mingle with Harry's moans. Draco's legs wrap around Harry's hips with an iron grip and he meets the movement in a relentless rhythm. All too soon Harry gets lost in it, allows himself to fall and promptly gets carried to exhilarating heights. With Draco's name on his lips, he spills into Draco, holds onto his waist and collapses over Draco's body, breathing heavily.
"Yes. And I need to know from you whether he has any chance at all," Harry replies. He feels as if he has not slept a wink all night and longs for a rest, yet the day has not even ended.
Harry hears himself breathe a sigh of relief and squeezes Draco's hand in his lap a little tighter. His mumbling has stopped, which Harry takes as a good sign and finally turns his attention back to Jimar.
Oh, how I would have loved to have wiped the victorious look off his face right then and there, but I was too busy trying to keep my racing pulse in check. "The Aurors are the only reason anyone would even want to talk to you."
Harry’s gaze fell on Draco’s face, the slightly opened mouth in which he could see sharp fangs, the glow of Draco’s eyes had also increased many times over. From the looks of it, he was slowly losing control. Now there were two possibilities: Either Harry waited patiently for Draco to calm down, although he had no idea how long that would take, or he tried to make sure Draco got the upper hand over his body himself. It wasn’t long before Harry made up his mind.
sure it was just an example and not merely wishful thinking?" Draco interrupted him, his eyes twinkled mischievously. Such arrogance was
Immediately after the war, Harry cherished the hope that it would return to what it had been before Voldemort extended his influence on the government. But by now Harry lacks the imagination to find the reason why it never gathered the strength to evolve beyond that.
Filly stressedly wipes his palms on his robes and comes to a halt in front of Harry. "There has been an incident. Mr Malfoy suffered organ failure, Healer Isaksen is already doing what she can. It –"
Draco didn’t complain about the finger inside him and only pulled at Harry’s hair to make him repeat what he had just done. Even though Harry’s jaw began to hurt slowly, he followed the silent request, enjoying the wheezing sounds he got from Draco and at the same time, he pushed a second finger in next to his first.
Even though the lakeshore was free of bushes and trees, some of the plants stood a few meters away from it and offered Harry extra protection. The invisibility cloak was useful, but hiding, in addition, would be of help. Harry was just looking back at the map when he heard a gurgling sound. A gurgle? Yes, there it was again! Harry narrowed his eyes to see better in the dark, that's when he spotted him.
Half an hour later Harry stood next to his scooter, handed Draco a helmet and put on his own as well. Draco muttered something about "ruining his hair", Harry laughed about it, bit back a comment about unhealthy vanity, then they got on, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's belly and they drove off.

"Before the details were settled, he started performing magic," Jimar continues in a casual tone. "Wandless, of course. It turned out to be uncontrolled magic. Anj- I mean, Healer Isaksen and the Aurors thought it wiser to keep him here where he can't accidentally hurt anyone. And he consented to that."
Draco said nothing, just looked at Harry as if he could say something that would reverse all this, but Harry did what he had done too often lately. He took flight. He noticed that he had already become tighter in his jeans when he laboriously pulled himself out of the water. Whether Draco noticed that, he didn’t care at that moment. He grabbed the invisibility cloak, turned around again with a hard beating heart and looked at Draco.
Pursuing the plea, Harry pushes himself up to Draco's eye level, kissing him heatedly and urgently, while he slides another finger inside Draco, only heeding his instincts. Draco moans into the kiss, jerks his upper body towards Harry's and lightly trails his fingernails over Harry's shoulder blades and down to his bottom.
Edward's greatest motive was supposedly the money he generated from trafficking Squib children. Others also attributed it to his sick mind and self-hatred, which led him to want to separate himself and be above those to whom he actually belonged. It unleashed a tremendous scandal.
"What? Why?" Harry turned his head anyway, of course, and was hopelessly at the mercy of the others staring at them wide-eyed. "Oh, fuck."
Weasley swayed his head thoughtfully from right to left before shrugging. "Probably not, but trust me. You can't help him right now."
Inside the spacious room, more precisely in front of the gigantic chestnut-wood wardrobe, Draco turned in front of a head-high mirror, with nothing but a black, snug-fitting turtleneck jumper and an equally black, clearly too short pleated skirt on his body. Harry's jaw dropped, it took him five more seconds before he even noticed Pansy, who had made herself comfortable on one of the cream-coloured armchairs, giggling and encouraging Draco to spin again for her.
I silently pondered if and how that was possible and squeezed Draco's hand a little tighter. "Will you tell me what I need to do?"
"It's okay that we're not well yet. That we haven't got to where we'd like to be. We just need to not lose sight of the reality that we have a future, and in it, all options are open to us." Harry exhales noisily but bravely carries on. "If you don't want to live for others, then live for yourself. Take time, be sad, be angry, be devastated, it's all as much a part of it as any happiness on earth. Just remember that it'll get easier and it'll change. You will change and to throw it all away would not be fair to your future. If you want fairness, create it yourself."
Harry had been staring at the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy for what felt like an eternity. He felt pretty stupid, his only job at the moment was to walk up and down the corridor opposite the tapestry and imagine the room he needed. Not a difficult task, if he hadn’t remained rooted to the spot since he arrived. What, by Merlin, was a suitable room?
Despite the temporary good news, no one is under the misapprehension that Malfoy has been cured. Rather, Isaksen emphasises that while the spell buys them more time, it does not provide a long-term solution. Malfoy's magic reserves are draining – more slowly than before, but still inexorably. In addition to the continuing diary visits, in which Healer Isaksen continues to put great hope, the hospital's own Curse-Breakers conduct research. Even Hermione is allowed to take a closer look at Malfoy's condition and soon has to admit defeat. The curse remains untraceable and Malfoy remains resolutely silent when attempts are made to consult him.
"Not everything you do or say, or don't do or don't say, has such an impact on those around you. Most of us are just egocentric and –"
it. Yes, there was a risk that Harry might one day fall in love with someone else, but the risk that the theory of the curse-breaker wouldn’t work and Harry would turn into a sea monster on his nineteenth birthday was at least as high, if not higher.
The little bell above the shop door chimes and someone calls out a goodbye to him before the door slams shut again. Too absorbed in the sight of the card, Harry lifts his head too late and swallows his farewell. Instead, he looks around his own little kingdom with contentment.
He can almost feel the carefully built scaffolding on which he bases his opinion of Malfoy collapsing. And he does not understand why. He was so sure that Malfoy was ridiculing the value of a Squib child. That he is still the very same person Harry learnt to hate.
“Sit down!” Ron demanded determinedly, and when Harry reacted only sluggishly, he pushed his best friend surely onto the bench at the Gryffindor table. Hermione, who sat opposite him, exchanged a questioning look with Ron, who only shook his head briefly. Harry sighed. At least he sat with his back to Draco, so he wasn’t tempted to look at him.
Mustering up all his courage, Harry took a deep breath. “So, uhm, Draco, what if there was another way out for you.” Merlin, how could a heart beat so fast and why was he so nervous in the first place? Maybe he feared the possible
Harry stared at Ron for a moment, who effortlessly held his gaze, then the black-haired man sighed resignedly. “All right, I'll make sure you get the dorm with Hermione alone in the next few days.”
Oh, Merlin, what was he doing here anyway? It was good, really good, but he had never sucked anyone’s cock before and was pretty sure that his lack of experience could be a problem. How had Draco done that again? It had been dark, so Harry only remembered the feeling, and he was also sure that he had simply dived into another world in the middle of it, so he could only remember bits and pieces.
understatement of the century. Harry was on his stomach just seconds after the starting whistle and crawled under the first obstacle, then jumped up to balance over a pole and then continued slaloming around a few traffic hats. Then followed three jumps over poles, he crawled under one again and then he was finally at the water barrel. Harry didn't hear the cheers of the others, but he could tell from the corner of his eye that he was at the same level as Ginny.
Then Draco took his hands off Harry's legs, straightened up, corrected the position of his bent legs as best he could and then set to a steadily increasing rhythm. The tingling in his body caused Harry to curl his toes and tense up. He forced himself to keep his eyes open, look at Draco, absorb the sight, savour it to the fullest.
Draco's gaze darts distrustfully along Harry's body and visibly relaxes when he realises who is standing in front of him. He lowers his head, looks past Harry, draws his knees to his body and wraps his arms around them, trembling. Something about the sight makes Harry think that the person in front of him is not Draco, but a fragile porcelain doll that needs to be treated with great care.
“Are you thinking about whether you’d have a chance with him?” Surprised, Harry looked over to Ron, who looked at his best friend, waiting. Apparently, Ron could read minds now. Great. Just
"There are only those who acknowledge it and those who don't," Draco insists steadfastly, moving to disentangle his pinky from Harry's grasp. "You’re a prime example yourself, without even realising it."
This was not Draco Malfoy. This in front of me was not even an actual person. It was merely an imprint, a memory, and much less.
Draco says nothing in reply, just continues to look at Harry silently, lost in his own thoughts. Perhaps he wonders why Harry does these things for him, why he cannot let it go, or what happened that caused Harry to develop such an interest in him. These are questions Harry would have asked a few months ago. But not anymore.
Harry's cheeks became hot and he squeezed his mouth shut so as not to laugh. Instead, he put on his helmet and made an inviting gesture to his scooter. "Just for the record: I'm going to ignore that comment and ask your highness to kindly move your pretty arse and take a seat!"
“Is that your curse?” Harry asked cautiously, careful not to stir up Draco any further, even though a million emotions were simultaneously throwing a party inside himself to which he was definitely not invited.
Taking the hint, Harry slumps back into the warmth of the couch, allows Pup to climb onto his lap and fights his urges by losing himself in Draco's music and eyes.
The most plausible seemed to be that in my desperation I had clung to every spark of emotion I felt for Draco. It was undeniable that Draco was a desirable man and affection, in its most ripe state, was best expressed through physicality, like a kiss.
Malfoy broke away and glared at me as he put a few steps of safe distance between us. "And I already have mine. Get lost and don't ever touch this book again."
Draco hesitates for just a moment, then crosses the small room and takes Harry's hand in his. Taking one last breath, Harry shoots Hermione a questioning look, who returns it with a firm nod and then climbs into the bathtub. He grits his teeth hard as the harsh cold envelops him, grips Draco's hand more firmly and then settles completely into the freezing water. He wears only a pair of boxer shorts, so the cold positively burns his skin.
"Can I?" Harry asked and got up as soon as Draco had climbed off him. If all else failed, then the old tricks came in handy. Fully aware that Draco was watching him, Harry started walking up and down the room at a fast pace, imagining some unpleasant things at the same time. Snape, who took Harry's essays apart in front of the entire class and humiliated him to the point of complete degradation. Dudley, who dunked Harry's head in a toilet bowl, counted to twenty, let him catch his breath, only to repeat the procedure. Ah yes, it worked instantaneously as usual. Harry stopped and grinned at Draco with satisfaction. Draco returned the look with a mixture of amusement and scepticism.
Usually, Harry was a man who respected boundaries one hundred per cent, but his lips moved on their own. "
Mounting a horse was actually not that difficult, Hetja stood still and Harry almost had the feeling that he didn't look as much like a sack of potatoes as he had feared. And because it was ponies, Harry wasn’t at a dizzying height. All in all, he felt very comfortable on Hetja's back. There was just one thing...
And so Harry did. It was foolish because it was too dark for his nod to be seen. Harry thought of it rather late, and only because Draco hadn’t kissed him for a few seconds too long. “Yeah,” he said, trying to sound determined and not nervous. He failed.
That is why, on his free Saturday evening, he finds himself standing in his slightly too tight-fitting rust-brown dress robe in the corner of a banqueting hall in Westminster rented by the Ministry, feeling more than a little out of place. He is transported back to the old days when he was more willing to give speeches at such events. Ginny thrives in these venues, exuding peace itself, engaging in splendid conversation and adding a spark to the dreary monotony of the evening. This evening is no different.
"Can I sit down?" Ron didn't wait for an answer and sat down beside Harry at the campfire. He fidgeted anxiously, kneading his own fingers and glanced at Harry repeatedly. Harry ignored it, his mouth was too dry to speak anyway.
Harry laughed and pulled Draco closer to him at the waist. "A wise decision and I'm pretty sure you'll learn to love the art of sexting faster than I will."
He felt so guilty, as if he had made a mistake he couldn't correct because it was too late. He had long since agreed, accepted the competition and he had
that night to say the least." Harry felt Draco laugh softly in his hair while his neck continued to burn. "A skirt isn't
Now Draco does look up, a slight smile adorning his lips, and he pointedly closes the book. "You're his godfather, aren't you?"
Draco sighed and laid his head on his left forearm. “They want me to come home to spend my last days as a human with them.”
Harry’s grin widened and he pulled Draco with their interlaced fingers away from the wall into his own arms. “I beg you, be my saviour, Draco,” he whispered to soft lips and caught Draco’s warm breath. Oh, how he had missed this and how clear was the answer. His heart and stomach explained in their own way how much they were thrilled by the closeness to Draco.
him. He smelled of a mixture of peppermint and vanilla and somewhere underneath there was the smell of sweet sweat. Harry licked his chapped lips, felt Draco's fingertips moving along his neck and almost gave in to the temptation.
"I'm gonna stop you there, mate! Whenever bed-escapades are discussed, no matter which direction, I’d rather not be present."
And then the hand suddenly disappeared and Harry made a protesting sound into the kiss. Draco didn't let himself be distracted, just slid closer to Harry and began to circle his hips agonizingly slow but deliciously hot. Harry's mouth fell open, he grabbed Draco's arse to pull him even closer and returned Draco's hip movement as best he could while sitting.
Perhaps it would have been better for Harry to ask for a new teammate or to rebuke Draco, but he did nothing of the sort. Instead, he just grinned at the man. "I've already heard you're ambitious."
Harry stared at the redhead in disbelief before he dropped onto his bed and shook his head in stunned bewilderment. "
“The other night, what were you talking about with that –” Harry hesitated, pointing instead to the waterspirit to avoid a misnomer.
Somehow, Harry had the feeling Draco wanted to be grabbed by the wrist – the grey eyes looked at him quite hopefully when they touched, but that could also be because they were desperately longing for each other. There was no need to say that, the tension would’ve been obvious even to a blind person. Why was this so hard? Why couldn’t he just know what Draco needed? Why couldn’t that curse just go to hell?
that, but how could that be compatible with the Malfoy family concept? If Draco were to marry a man, who would then carry out the Malfoy heir as intended?
Before Harry could think about it too much, he decided that this was enough for one night. He needed a moment to process all this, and Draco's webbed hand on his knee didn't help in the slightest. So he pulled his legs out of the water, stood up, and collected his invisibility cloak and the useless book. He turned back to Draco, who watched him as he swam slowly backwards into the middle of the pool. A nod from Harry formed their goodbye, then he hurried back to his dormitory.
. As absurd as it might seem, his self, as it sat next to me right now, made a surprising amount of sense to me by now.
He stops right by Parkinson and the wizard speaking to her and adopts an air of insincere delight. "What a coincidence! You of all people here?"
Realising what he was doing, Harry took a step back, as far as was possible in the water. He missed the feeling on his lips instantly, but the horror prevailed. Draco looked no less shocked, moving his lips as if he wanted to say something, but no sound left his mouth.
He rose, reached out his hand to me, causing me to take it and go after him. We crossed the room and stopped in front of one of the tower windows. Almost instantly, the glass changed colour and behind it appeared the now familiar park in front of Malfoy Manor.
Hermione often tells Harry to take more initiative in his life. At times she tries to talk him into going on trips around the world or encourages him to take part in club activities. She probably thinks that this could give Harry's life a new meaning. Most of the time, Harry just lets the suggestions slide until he loses his nerve and yells at her to mind her own business. Then there is peace for a few months until the game starts all over again.
Without giving too much thought to the consequences, Harry summons a chair with a flick of his wand. "Sit down. I know something that’ll help you."
But Malfoy is not an exceptionally powerful wizard, at least Harry does not assume he is. So he grapples with other possibilities. Riddle used his diary as a Horcrux, thereby granting him the ability to actually enter memories. He embedded part of his soul into the book, bringing it to life. It is frighteningly reminiscent of Malfoy's diary, but Harry still retains hope that Malfoy is incapable of creating a Horcrux.
"I already know." Harry spun around in surprise, only to see Hermione standing diagonally behind Ron, apparently listening in. "Ron told me about it a while ago.”
is bringing her by?" Draco asked, slight panic in his voice. "Your godfather, whom you live with? Who – Who's in a sense your legal guardian?"
Harry blinked at Draco in surprise. "Was it not obvious? Would you like me to spell out for you that
Harry would have liked to gather the courage to ask Draco to look at him, but he cannot bring himself to do it. If Ron can believe that time heals all wounds, then so can he. If he keeps Draco waiting until he is ready to approach him, then he has to practice patience as well. It is give and take, a balance and not a tug of war for the upper hand.
Harry's mind is still suspended in another reality, so he does not wonder who Lucy is or how much time has passed since he entered the diary. Instead, he regains his composure, sits up and watches Jimar, who keeps his wand pointed at a square sheet of paper. Letters appear illegibly on it, it folds all by itself and, after Jimar taps it one more time with his wand, flies to a small, gap-like opening in the wall next to the shelf.
? Harry was a bit overwhelmed if he was honest. Should he stay in bed? Or should he get up? Ron would certainly be waiting for him and after last night's confession, he would assume the worst or rather best if Harry left him waiting. Apart from the fact that Draco was still unhealthily eager to win this competition and they let the points for feeding the horses slip through their fingers. Draco would undoubtedly blame Harry, even if it was him who was laying on top of Harry and kept him from getting up.
A little taken aback, I left his answer as it was, for now, and joined him in looking out at the lake again, indulging my own thoughts.
The hand between Malfoy's legs moves faster, his eyes cloud but remain unyieldingly focused on Harry and he parts his mouth a little as if a word lies on the tip of his tongue.
For a moment Draco struggled with himself, biting his lower lip thoughtfully and giving me a calculating look, then he sighed, looked back up at the ceiling and pulled himself together. "It may be that ... somewhere inside me, I harboured the hope that you would testify in my favour before the Wizengamot."
"The bet was originally a joke by Krum. I overheard him joking with Granger about taking my virginity. For him, it was all just an even bigger game, he never made any promises to anyone, always made it unmistakably clear that he didn't want to commit to anything. Granger got angry, she insisted that I – that I wouldn't do it. I didn't know at the time, but today I know that despite the games, despite the disappointment, she was convinced that I would choose our friendship over the game. That I would know when enough was enough."
Harry took the opportunity to clear his throat quietly and tap the back of Draco's hand with his fingertip. "Were
Oh. The snogging didn't leave Draco unaffected. Harry got even hotter, more and more blood gathered between his legs. Something that was probably equivalent to nervousness spread through his body and took over his mind as well. Harry pushed the feeling decisively aside, recalling the conversation with Ron, who had advised him to "just let it happen" and sat up.
"How long does he have?" he then asks. He has realised the gravity of the situation. Anja wants to sigh with relief.
Harry lifts his head in surprise and only just witnesses Hermione slamming her palm against her forehead before hastily leaving the kitchen.
. This time it was Harry who flinched. Draco just rolled his eyes before Harry could complain and set the temperature to tepid. "We're not barbarians, Potter. Taking cold showers is for people who can't afford the heating costs!"
"Yes, but we thought it wiser to wait and see first, to –" Harry falters and gestures vaguely with his hand, explaining nothing at all.
Harry tried to duck away under Draco's fingers but was unsuccessful. The paint felt sticky on the skin, not really pleasant, but nothing unbearable. As long as Draco's fingers were on his skin, Harry was perfectly happy anyway.
Harry crosses his arms in front of his chest and leans back in his chair. Suddenly the chirping of the birds sounds unnaturally loud and he wishes for nothing more than a little more silence. "That's not my problem."
"You have the mind of an Auror, Mr Potter. We continue to regret that you didn't stay with us," Filly says, his grin not diminishing.
“Wasn't that years ago?” Harry asked, still watching Draco. The Slytherin hadn’t mentioned Pansy at all, admittedly he didn’t mention anyone else in front of Harry, so this was neither a bad nor a good sign.
"First of all, Pansy cries during every movie," Blaise explained. "And secondly, it’s as the old German saying goes: The greatest happiness on earth is sitting – “
With one hand holding his glasses, he stared into the murky water of the barrel for a second and thought himself lucky that he didn't have to see this broth in focus. Then he gasped for breath and dove under.
He trusts the Aurors. If they think Malfoy knows enough to serve them as an informant, Harry will be only too happy to act the owl and supply them with whatever he can coax out of Malfoy. Well, not
Rationally, Harry wasn’t disappointed in Draco. How could he? He didn't know Draco's reasons for his actions. He didn't know
"Are you sure that's a good idea, Harry?" Hermione's right hand rests absentmindedly on her stomach, with the other she brushes her dark curls behind her ear. "Without Healers present, his chances of survival won't exactly increase."
. So Harry tried to act normal, working on his essays and studying in his spare time. He just did everything that would distract him and keep him from thinking about Draco. Of course, he thought about him anyway, it was almost impossible to banish the blond from his thoughts completely.
Draco left it at an eye roll and started to correct Harry's sitting position with instructions. The reins were of a different calibre, so Draco lent a hand and brought Harry's fingers into the correct position. Harry watched Draco's movement closely, it was the first time he had got a good look at the pale fingers. They were extraordinarily
"But the thing with Granger is a different one," Pansy whispered, for which she received a warning look from Blaise. She stuck her tongue out at him but said nothing more about it. Hermione had apparently not heard Pansy, she giggled at something Ron had said.
They’re bastards," Draco lamented, paused at some point and looked around suspiciously. Then he wrinkled his nose in annoyance. "Great, and here the earth is wet. I just wanted to relax
Harry nodded and shouldered the surprisingly heavy rucksack. He tried his best not to stare too much at Draco, though that was probably an impossibility. The blond didn't notice, though, he seemed very pleased with himself and strutted past Harry and out of the guesthouse. Harry hurried to keep up.
Harry's jaw dropped and something contracted in his stomach area, he couldn't tell whether it was joyful anticipation or fear. It could be both. "I –" he started, but was interrupted by Draco, who leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on his lips.
He is no longer able to deny the obvious. He may not understand what exactly this diary entails, but the Malfoy in this book is not just a meaningless illusion. He is an imprint of a bygone period, but despite everything, he is an imprint of a real person. Of Draco Malfoy. He is memory and not surreality. Because he has an effect on reality.
Draco's quiet laughter only confirmed his self-doubt. "Come on, I can forgive that mistake." The mattress beside Harry dipped slightly under Draco's weight. Harry kept his eyes closed in agony, he could hear Draco giggling next to him. "To be honest, I'm not surprised you haven't had
For some reason, Harry simply assumed Draco would be seeing his mother, maybe both of his parents, when he used the Resurrection Stone. He had not expected Dumbledore and yet his mind refuses to feel honest surprise. Perhaps he suspected it already. After all, the old wizard is the one who holds more importance in Draco's past than most.
At the edge of the doorstep, a small object is lying on the wooden floor right next to a shattered glass box. Frowning and with his eyes fixed on the end of the corridor, he reaches down for the small, deep blue stone and takes a few seconds to examine it more closely. The jagged crack is the first thing that causes Harry's breath to catch. There is no doubt about it – the last time he held this stone in his hands was just before he faced Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest.
Where at first the desire for closeness and the need to have Draco in sight lived, now the need to escape grows.
Draco's finger worked precisely and carefully over Hetja's coat. Each patch of colour had a carefully planned position, which Harry didn’t understand at first, but admired as soon as he understood the meaning behind it. And despite Draco's concentration on his own work, he corrected Harry's way of working exactly in the right moments. Held him by his wrist when he almost ruined Draco's little masterpiece and showed him how he could help without disfiguring everything.
Harry cleared his throat uneasily, the truth had been his best friend all day, he took it as a sign. "We, er...we don't have to. I don't want you to think that's all I care about." Draco's face was a single question mark and Harry scratched the back of his head in embarrassment. "I don't want to lose you, okay? I'm willing to wait if you need time to forgive me."
Hedwig accompanied the group, so Harry should have been busy looking for her, but Draco was clearly too interesting to not look at him. In the end, it was Seamus and Dean who distracted Harry from the target of his desire and grilled him about London. Most of those present lived within a radius of a few kilometres and were probably more of what one would call children of the village. Thus, the big city life was enough unknown to them to get enthusiastic about it. Harry didn’t diminish their enthusiasm with the reality of the horrible jungle called the big city and instead promised to invite them over after the holidays. Just then, he was officially declared Seamus and Dean's personal hero.
It was the day after Hedwig's arrival, Harry sat on Hetja's back, listened to the wind rushing through the forest canopy and noticed Draco's mouth. Rather late, considering that they had already exchanged dozens of kisses, but it wasn't only about Draco's lips and how they felt on Harry's, but about everything that had to do with Draco's mouth. This included the words that left his mouth, the way Draco ate his food, the facial expressions, from disgust to the brightest laughter and yes, also the kisses Draco gave Harry.
While Filly immediately lapses into rambling explanations, about how exactly the diary was examined and simply dodges Mr Potter's statement, Anja tries to read the emotion in Mr Potter's expression. He seems primarily confused, but there is also disdain whenever Mr Malfoy's name is mentioned.
It is stronger than the residue left in Draco's body, but not remotely comparable to Harry's own. So he manages far too unresistingly to wrap around the sense of magic, to redirect it and intertwine it with Draco's body.
Harry frowned. Draco wasn’t a girl, he understood, but that wasn’t how he’d explained the concept of mermaids. “Maiden, like the virgin, not the woman. Why does that bother you?” he rattled off the knowledge that he’d acquired from Draco.
He had to try something else. Something that Hermione would probably have slapped him for if she had known about it. Something that required him to exploit his boy-who-lived status with Slughorn and something that robbed him of a great deal of his dignity. But he did it, seeing no better solution. After all, Draco’s birthday was exactly one week away, which caused a certain level of panic among all involved.
, had he missed her. Her soft fur, her joy as soon as she jumped towards Harry. But he could have done without her attempts to lick his face. The dog walked in a circle once, greeted everyone curiously and then stood well-behaved next to Harry to wait for further instructions. Sirius just rolled his eyes, joked that no one could ever make Harry as happy as
"Potter, don't go back to sssleep... You need to feed..." Draco mumbled and sounded as if he were half asleep, but Harry's stomach reacted instantly. This didn't sound as if Draco was ignoring him.
The accusation resonated in the statement, but Draco still wryly smirked and looked Harry straight in his green eyes. “If I’m at fault for this, I should at least offer to remedy it.”
He had imagined it to be more impressive. More pain, more tears. Fewer Muggles telling him with every imaginable synonym for "blithering idiot" that he was just that.
He continued to refuse to cooperate. It did not surprise me in the slightest, one could not expect anything from Malfoy and yet everything about his presence and his tone provoked me. "You cannot shirk this responsibility, Malfoy. You have answers to questions that could save people's lives."
. With that expression, Sirius put on when he said something embarrassing like "Go get them, tiger" to Harry.
The Gryffindor watched thoughtlessly as Draco twisted the apple in his hands, or rather claws. He discovered the bitten part and raised a sceptical eyebrow. Merlin, it wasn't poisonous, no reason for Draco to look suspicious. But the Slytherin didn’t seem disgusted. On the contrary, a smug smile flitted over his lips before he held the apple to his mouth and licked with relish over the bitten area.
So much that he couldn't even concentrate on the angry swearing of the Muggle in front of him. He squinted his eyes, felt a breeze causing his hair to flutter and thought about whether this was what dying felt like.
Harry snorted. Of course, he was silent now. Perhaps he was already regretting that he had told Harry about the curse at all, but now he had to deal with the consequences. Harry felt pretty stupid that he had even suggested this date and was just a blink of an eye away from getting up and leaving. But something stopped him.
The feeling started when you rescued me in the lake and it was quite indefinable at first. I just wanted you to be safe and to, you know, protect you. The need became more and more insistent over time, so I named it,” Harry explained, trying not to blush.
Surprised, Harry turned around and looked first at brown wild curls framing a pretty face. "Hermione!" Not a second later, Harry was already hugging his old friend. "Still as big a smart-ass as ever!"
Keeping his gaze unwaveringly trained on Draco, Harry wonders how he is supposed to confess his love to someone when they have known about his feelings for a long time.
Mrs Longbottom's office door was closed, Blaise sat in a chair next to the door under a noticeboard with all sorts of announcements attached to it. He seemed more relaxed than he did half an hour ago. Though his expression changed slightly when he noticed Harry walking towards him.
But he was still chained to the ground. His breath didn't want to work properly, something heavy lay on his lungs. His chest hurt unbearably, the image of a breaking Draco flashed so vividly before his inner eye. It was all his fault, his
Since Harry's first visit, Lucy has always been careful to address him politely and not appear unprofessional. This is in stark contrast to Jimar, who has been present almost every time Harry has interacted with Lucy. It is only stranger because Harry consistently and unsuccessfully attempts to establish a more casual conversation with her.
Draco sighed, rolled his eyes and shifted his weight from one leg to the other. Harry had seemingly missed his French lessons. “Why,
person who wouldn't enjoy climbing onto wood only to have a mushy rubber broom between their legs the next moment!" Draco grinned at me with as much enthusiasm as expectation.
Harry feels the need to scream, to force Draco to finally listen to him properly and make him see reason, but he does nothing of the sort. Instead, he wraps his arms around Draco, pulls him close, buries his nose in his neck and memorises the warmth in its entirety. As Draco tentatively wraps his arms around Harry as well, he realises that Draco was not only asking this question for himself. He was asking it just as much for Harry.
"But you’d do it anyway," Harry breathed, his hands moving to Draco's waist, the silk fabric cool under his fingers. "You would want me to want it. Because you pursue a twisted logic!"
Harry frowned, glanced behind him and witnessed a tall man with long blond hair, walking vigorously towards their table. Mr Malfoy's expression was so cold, even the other participants sitting at breakfast felt his presence immediately. He wore elegant clothes and held a walking stick in his hand, which probably served more for decoration than for support. But it did its effect. Mr Malfoy already looked imperious without the cane, with it he was only more frightening.
Malfoy called him You-Know-Who. Not Voldemort or Dark Lord. I was convinced he had needed to teach that to himself.
Ron and Hermione each knew Sirius already and quickly started a conversation with the sociable man as they strolled with him to the guesthouse. Harry unintentionally let himself fall back a bit, watched Hedwig, who curiously explored the new surroundings, and smiled contentedly. He felt Draco's presence at his side, warmly reminding him that the world could be a bloody good place.
And right now, Draco wanted Potter. The young man who wasn’t even remotely aware of his effect on others. The green eyes, not moss green, but not apple green either, more like emerald green if Draco had to commit to a choice, enchanted him like no one else ever had. The golden-brown skin made him weak, especially when Potter's hand lay in his own milky white one. And his dark hair, it had no right to look so forbiddingly seductive and at the same time so catastrophic.
His dazed state does not go completely unnoticed, so during their winter walk at noon on Boxing Day, Ron slows down to stroll alongside Harry who has fallen behind unnoticed by the others.
Filly's lips twist into a satisfied grin. "We need names. Names that none of them dares speak, but that every one of them knows."
I failed to answer these questions for Malfoy, instead, I quietly continued his list. "Does fate determine whether a person becomes good or evil? Is it set in stone or is one free to choose against or for it? Would one follow a different fate if choosing against it? Or does one just get on the wrong track?"
The feeling of losing Draco before he is even given the chance to be with him will not let him go. Any prospect of an end without loss trickles through his fingers like fine sand and cannot be grasped or shaped. It is maddening.
He can sympathise with the fact that Malfoy does not particularly feel affection for Harry. Especially when meeting him for the first time in seven years and being confronted with such a tragic loss. On top of that, Malfoy is not in a good physical condition and, as it seems, not in a healthy mental state either.
In response to the Ministry's owl, he has taken to visiting the office of the Head of Auror Headquarters, since he could not wait to hear if Draco's theory carries any weight. As he has just learnt, it more than does. Draco was entirely right. About every aspect. The only question left to puzzle over is why the Aurors could not draw those conclusions themselves.
"Yes, quite so," Mrs Longbottom began, while she received the entry forms of the three across her desk. "You will be divided into teams of two and you will try to score points with your teammate. The team with the highest score at the end of the two weeks will win. But I will explain this in more detail when everyone has arrived. Any questions?"
Careful not to move too hastily, Harry takes his wand in one hand and raises the other to rest it on Malfoy's knee. He flinches slightly but does not push Harry away. A glance at his face reveals his flushed cheeks, all the more prominent on his pale face. He seems uncomfortable with the touch, or perhaps he considers it alien. How long must it have been since anyone had held Malfoy?
Harry swallows. Draco's voice sounds thin and shaky, but he is not refusing to use it. "Is there anything I –"
between Draco and Harry was just a summer fling. Was it? Harry hurriedly pushed the question away, trying to concentrate more on not stumbling over the undergrowth Draco was piloting them into.
"Should you find a young girl named Claire among the missing, I’d like to be informed." Harry feels this is the least they can do, thus phrasing it as a statement rather than a question.
The young man made a questioning sound and when Harry didn't answer, he raised his head again to return Harry’s gaze. Perhaps he didn't need to know after all. It had only been one of Ron's silly jokes. Harry hadn't once thought about it in all this time. It would only upset Draco unnecessarily.
The brown-haired woman returned the look sceptically, then turned back to her breakfast. "I know, Viktor texted me yesterday."
"– We were able to figure out that the diary can only be entered by the person who has the magical signature that was found on the diary. That is Mr Malfoy's, of course, but also yours, Mr Potter," Filly finishes his essay, surprisingly answering Mr Potter's question after all.
Without thinking about it for long, Harry again pushed himself on Draco, but the blond seemed to have got tired of waiting, as he turned directly onto his stomach and allowed Harry a delicious sight of his buttocks. Enjoying this sight, Harry let his fingers glide over it and spread Draco’s legs a little bit in the same movement.
With a pleasurable sigh, Harry shoved a hand in Draco’s hair, felt the silky softly strands of hair glide along his fingers and felt like he was over the moon. Over a very hot moon, which also seemed to strike his prick. No wonder,  as Draco rubbed himself lewdly against him.
As soon as Draco has seemingly made himself comfortable, Pup sneaks out from under the bookshelf and elegantly jumps onto the couch next to Harry. He casts Harry a reproachful glance – there is no creature more resentful than Pup – and swiftly climbs onto Draco's legs. The latter appears unsurprised, waits until Pup has curled up on his lap and then places a hand protectively on the black fur.
Draco's cheeks turned slightly pink as he began to twist his fingers. Harry frowned in confusion; this didn't suit Draco's ever-composed character. “Yeah, I was born with it. And the curse theoretically has no cure either,” Draco answered. Those were the expected cryptic hints that Harry couldn't figure out.
As expected, the day had been absolutely boring and unimportant. To be honest, Harry didn’t remember a single topic that the professors had taught him, but the Gryffindor wasn’t bothered by that. On the weekend, he would have enough time to rework the material. Assuming everything went well tonight.
It was quiet. Night fell peacefully over Hogwarts and made sure that even the last students snuggled into their beds and closed their eyes. Everyone except Harry, who, after looking at the Marauder’s Map, once again slipped over his invisibility cloak. Barefooted, he clumsily made his way to the fifth floor to the luxurious Prefects’ Bathroom. Under his arm, he carried his wand and the book in which the words of salvation were written. Hermione had given it to Harry in the evening, but as they had been late for dinner, Harry hadn’t seen the Slytherin and ultimately had no opportunity to announce the joyful news.
Before Draco could muster enough mental strength to get his bearings and correctly assess his situation, strong arms closed around him and an all too familiar scent enveloped him.
Their first kisses hadn't been perfect, although Harry didn't want to find another word for them. Sometimes it had been too much tongue, sometimes too little, sometimes too much teeth, sometimes too little, sometimes too much verve, sometimes too little. It had taken a few attempts to harmonise their lips, Harry had enjoyed every second to the maximum, had considered Draco the only educational book worth studying. And it had definitely been rewarding! Draco's kisses had become a mere alignment of their needs, Harry wouldn't ever get enough of them.
After all the participants had greeted their ponies sufficiently and devotedly, they had returned to the dining hall for dinner. Afterwards, some had gone to their rooms to unpack or
Harry's mouth opened again as he witnessed Draco open the door to the corridor and go outside without another word. This pretentious git really thought that one of the Gryffindor traits would save him. He would be half right, Harry had never intended to tell anyone else about his discovery. But Draco had forgotten one important thing: In addition to chivalry, the Gryffindors were also known for their boldness, and Harry was only too happy to live up to this.
Time worked differently in Draco's diary. Not linear and thus not tangible for my mind. Did that not mean I could drift into eternity without ever losing a second in my actual world?
Mr Potter presses his lips shut and continues to look at the patient's bed, only to laugh dryly after a few seconds. "He's quite a prick."
“Less drama with Draco Malfoy? I don't think so,” Harry replied with a grin, then realised what he had just unintentionally implied and immediately felt the uncomfortable heat burning his cheeks.
Draco looks at him with wide eyes but does not say a word. He has grasped the true underlying message, Harry can tell by looking at him. Hermione and Ron would never risk Harry's life for Draco. Not to the magnitude Draco has in mind when he thinks of Harry's plan.
What he would have done then, Harry would never find out. He rose somewhat dazed while Draco was still speaking and let the finger that had just circled around Draco's cock slide into the wet tightness. At the same time, he gently massaged the wrinkled, saliva-wetted skin at Draco's back entrance with his thumb. Draco gasped for air, his eyes closed, his hair dangling tousled in his face. Unable to form a coherent thought, Harry positioned his erection, followed Draco's pleas and sank agonizingly slowly into Draco.
Harry followed the invitation, his stomach area was tingling all of a sudden. He almost stopped himself in his movement but forced himself to keep walking towards Draco. Why was he nervous? It wasn't as if this was anything new, yet it suddenly felt like thin ice. He couldn't afford any more mistakes, he knew that. Almost devoutly, Harry sat down next to Draco on his bed, but not without keeping an appropriate safety distance.
“What a pleasant surprise! My honourable saviour skipped his last class against all expectations. Granger will tremble with rage!”
“We’d better use one of our dormitories after all. The room is a bit –” Harry faltered for lack of the right word, but Draco’s smile revealed that he already had his own thoughts on the matter. But not even Draco would expect the full extent of the madness hidden behind this wooden door, so maybe it was better if he didn’t see it at all.
"Most Icelandic horses, in addition to the three standard gaits of walk, trot and canter, are also proficient in tölt and flying pace. Hetja usually has a very clear tölt, you’ll like it. Feels like riding a rocking horse," explained Draco and even spared any comment about Harry's lack of knowledge.
Harry pushed one knee between Draco's legs, spreading them, caught the soft lips for a small kiss, buried one hand on the back of Draco's head, the other gently brushed Draco's cheek. Draco's hands held onto Harry's arms at first, but as soon as their tongues started to play the familiar game, Draco tried to draw Harry's body closer.
Draco’s eyes were still closed, but his breaths revealed that he was awake, so Harry began to run his fingers gently through the blond’s soft hair. Draco’s satisfied grumble was drowned out by him pressing his nose into Harry’s collarbone. A peppery fresh scent tickled Harry’s nose and reminded him strongly of the freesias his Aunt Petunia had grown in her garden. He liked the smell, but he liked everything about Draco.
"Her name is Katla," Draco began to explain, while he put a halter on a maroon-coloured mare. "She’s Nott's pony, but she lost a horseshoe yesterday. Hence the farrier."
It only took Harry a second to realise what must have happened, then he jumped to his feet and headed for them. Draco continued to slowly retreat, his gaze locked on Harry, ignoring what Ron said to him.
Harry couldn't help but smile at the mental image. That fear had helped to reveal Draco's riding talent was, in an amusing way, very fitting. At least, Harry felt that way. He decided to tease Draco about it later.
Draco, just realising that it was only Harry who had pulled him out of his sleep, interrupted his attempt to escape and eyed the intruder disparagingly. “How did you get in here?”
"I think that's their way of apologising?" Harry tried, suppressing with all his might the need to burst out laughing.
Harry approaches Malfoy and kneels in front of him. It seems too intimate for him to sit next to him and if he has learnt anything about Malfoy, it is that he has yet to earn his trust.
When he finally rolled off Draco, lay on his back and just turned his head towards Draco, he couldn’t help but smile radiantly. All the inner struggle, all the fear, all the discouragement, it had brought them here and now they were free of it. Free of all the worries and only the aftermath of their climaxes hung in the air.
At first, it is a strange feeling to not take the usual route to St Mungo's Hospital and instead apparate directly into his flat. Not even Pup is home to greet him. Instead, he roams the neighbourhood and mews in bewilderment when he climbs in through the open window a few hours later and discovers Harry.
Shortly before the birth of little Rose on the nineteenth of May, he returned to England. He quit his job at
Gasping for breath, he swallowed more water, kicked around, but his struggle only caused him to lose consciousness even faster. Just as Harry accepted his inevitable fate, he felt it. The pressure on his hand, it came loose! A heartbreaking scream rang out, then everything around him turned to black.
Draco sighed softly into the kiss, opened his lips for Harry, licked pleadingly into Harry’s mouth and made it hard for the man to think properly. Harry's free hand, which had just been resting on Draco's back, slid down over naked skin, over the black fabric and dug into Draco's right thigh.
"And who's going to get the booze?" Harry asked curiously, he increasingly liked the casual handling of the horse-riding holidays on Weeping Willow Farmstead.
. Surprisingly, Draco didn’t seem to notice that his ring was missing and with a little luck, it would stay like that. Otherwise, Harry would have one more problem and he could really do without that.
Just in time, Harry swallows the comment that he is only playing the song for Draco. After all, it is the latter's birthday and therefore his day alone.
was really embarrassing. But then Harry changed his mind and avoided Draco’s eyes. One way or the other, he had achieved what he had wanted to achieve, the rest shouldn’t matter.
Harry felt heat creep into his cheeks and shrugged his shoulders. "It's... nice watching you. He's beautiful." He nodded in Feykir’s direction, who stomped his foot as if to confirm Harry's words.
It was dark. Harry was listening to the sounds of music that was too far away to recognise a certain song. Someone giggled in the hallway on the first floor. Harry would bet on Pansy, but in a drunken state, it could be almost anyone. The voices became quieter, and somewhere a door fell into the lock.
Harry stared into grey eyes for a few seconds, then exhaled, wrapped one arm around Draco's waist and held his flat hand out to him. "If the rest means putting my do –"
"You could never let it go," I continued unrestrainedly, my voice raised. "Back then it was Hermione – as if a blood status means a
"I won't tell Mr Malfoy any more than is necessary," Isaksen confirms and rises. "I continue to count on your dedicated cooperation, Mr Potter. You'll be more successful with forbearance and compassion than with impatience."
He had not aged a day. Of course he had not. He was still wearing the same black cloth trousers and the same pristine white shirt, the cuffs of which he had rolled up revealing the lower part of a red-dyed Dark Mark on his left side. His short hair was neatly coiffed as always, with only one wisp falling in his forehead as if deliberately placed there. His skin was as flawless as ever, with no bruise adorning his jaw. His lips were curled into a polite but distant smile and his eyes skimmed slowly up and down my body.
Draco tilted his head, his low ponytail fell over his left shoulder. The smile didn’t fade and he looked at Harry as expectantly as he had just before their first kiss. Only with a much greater portion of self-confidence and unmistakable desire in his eyes. Instead of answering, Draco bit his lower lip and continued to take a few more steps back.
How could it have been otherwise? Watching Draco's heart break just made him realise how much the blond meant to him. He didn't want to lose him, he
Nervousness dominated Harry's steps but he kept walking until he dropped to his knees before Draco. He kept his distance, he wasn't foolish enough to impose his closeness now. He could hear his own breath rattle, too loud for the silence of the forest. Draco clenched his jaw, wrapped his arms more firmly around his legs, but didn't retreat. Harry almost sighed with relief.
"Hey, lovebirds," Ginny called out to them. "Is this going to last the rest of the week and we'll never catch you two apart again?"
Mr Hagrid, who insisted on being called simply Hagrid, was a large man with a big beard and that twinkle in his eye which immediately told them that he must be a faithful soul. He showed Harry and Ron exactly what food their ponies were being fed and explained to them what the consequences of overfeeding concentrate or hay would be. Harry was clearly too tired to listen closely, but he was still grateful for Hagrid's presence. At least he didn't have to confess to Ron that he was possibly in the process of developing a fetish for blond hair.
When he opened his eyes again, they found Draco’s grey ones and a slight smile formed on his lips. “Do you know this feeling from experience?”
Draco moaned, dropped his head into Harry's crook of the neck and came a second time while riding out Harry's orgasm with tired movement. Harry wrapped his arms around the pale body, held it close to his chest, the moment resembled pure perfection.
Draco's eyes drift to Harry in the mirror, expression shifting to something hopeful. The loss of his parents gnaws at him, Harry can not only see that but empathise with it. As cruel as these people might have been, they were Draco's parents. For a long time, his mother was the last to save Draco from isolation.
The green coloured nature was so beautiful and at the same time so uninteresting to Harry. It was a shame, it deserved more appreciation, but Harry's attention already belonged to someone else. Rather than watching the bumblebees buzz or the poppies grow, he preferred to spend his time gazing furtively at Draco, who walked carefree along the gravel path beside him, certainly leading them towards the paddocks.
"This." Harry uncertainly gestured between the two and immediately felt as if he was twelve years old and unable to articulate proper sentences. He cleared his throat with hot cheeks. "Sex. Well,
The addressed man blinked a few times too fast, but then he took his eyes off Draco’s lips and looked apologetically into the grey eyes. It was certainly not good that he didn’t care what he had to say as long as he could feel those wonderful lips on his own again.
Unimpressed by Harry's speechlessness, Draco scans the shop again. "You have it nice here. The name's a bit ..." He falters, unmistakably searching for a suitable word, and Harry finally remembers that he has a voice.
"I'm trans," Draco interrupted his flood of thoughts in a firm voice. "Transgender... if you know what that is." Draco cleared his throat uneasily but forced himself to continue looking at Harry.
Other memories had shown Malfoy actually apologising. What was interesting to me were the people he chose to seek this forgiveness from. Most of the names had been unfamiliar to me, but there were a few among them that I had recognised. He had written a letter to Luna and Dean – or rather sent them a letter. He had written on piles of stationery until he had brought himself to send one of them.
Harry shakes his head, although Draco pays him no mind. "Teddy," he corrects. The little boy is the one he misses most from his old life. "And I'm not running from it, just postponing my answer until ... what was it? 'When the time is right'."
Harry's skin felt like it was on fire, he finally needed Draco on top of him, on his cock, to be exact. Even if it meant he had to give up Draco's heavenly blowjob one more time.
So much for the theory. Since the riding arena wasn’t big enough for all six teams, only two teams competed against each other. For each won round, the winning team was awarded 15 horseshoe points. To avoid overstraining the horses, each team was only allowed to compete for three times, which meant nine rounds in total.
"I know next to nothing about her. Jimar, who works security at St Mungo's, only told me that he knew her because they used to play cards together. She was supposed to be transferred to another hospital just before she disappeared, but I don't even know which one exactly."
Potter didn't show up at the fire with Granger and Weasley until the sun had already set. Draco almost missed it, only when Lovegood squeaked Potter's name did he see him on the other side of the fire. He wore a dark green blanket over his shoulders, had a beer bottle in his hand and seemed in better condition than before.
Harry blinks at him, irritated at being unable to see properly, when only a moment later Hermione, emerging behind Ron, holds his glasses out to him. With a grateful smile, Harry puts them on and looks into Hermione's worried face.
. Goosebumps made Harry's neck tingle, Draco's fingers glided lower, into the open trousers and somewhere the ability to form clear thoughts bid Harry farewell.
before he pulled Draco towards him and pressed their lips in a passionate kiss. Oh, how he had missed this feeling. How had he ever managed to detach his lips from Draco’s?
The lessons kept Harry pretty busy. It was summer, the final exams came closer but for nonsensical learning, Harry had less nerve at the moment than for anything else. Of course, Hermione didn’t get this and simply forced Harry to study. Ron was the only one who left him alone with school topics and didn’t talk about Draco without being asked, which made him the most pleasant conversation partner Harry had at the time. Except for Draco, of course.
, you're right. Can you watch him for a minute? I'll just get Blaise and we'll take him to their room."
The door opens and Healer Isaksen enters the office, her lime green robe billowing behind her. After a quick, ascertaining gaze at Harry, she asks him for his consent to check his vital signs to determine possible damages caused by the diary visit. Harry accepts the request with a slight nod of his head and experiences the procedure only peripherally.
sounded as ridiculous as they were, yet they were at the top of Harry's mental list. After all, he couldn't care less what Malfoy would think of him afterwards. He was Harry motherfucking Potter, he was definitely allowed to ask absolutely inappropriate questions.
! He really is better. You know what Hermione said when I asked what the hell 'tölt' was?" Ron began. "She said, and I quote, 'A gait in which the horse alternately places one or two hooves on the ground, therefore it’s a
This was his chance of gaining the being's trust and then asking it about Draco, however he fit into this picture. So Harry smiled a little more confidently now and reached out for the creature's hand to grab it. Only gently and briefly, but amicably, to not leave a false impression. Just as Harry loosened his grip on the squidgy hand again, the creature's broad mouth widened into a grin so vicious that Harry's smile was instantly wiped from his face.
But she nods slightly, heads into a small, separate room behind the counter and returns a few moments later. In her hands, she carries a yellowed envelope, the seal not yet broken, and slides it carefully across the counter to Harry.
Harry feels the gaze of the other two on his back and tries not to pay them any attention. Instead, he studies Malfoy's face and ignores the fact that Malfoy immediately pulls his feet further away from Harry. His skin is sallow, his lips chapped, but there is a hint of emotion in his clouded eyes when Harry sits down in front of him.
Ginny groaned annoyed, she remained turned away from them but placed her hands on her hips. "Ron and Hermione didn't win.
Harry didn’t really listen to his two best friends anymore. Instead, he ignored his lunch in front of him and stared at the Slytherin table where Draco was eating his lunch in slow motion and looked as if he’d rather be dead.
Harry has brought lemon tartlets, a responsibility he has felt since he happened to overhear Aurora complaining that the family recipe had gone missing when he first met Nellie. The freshly baked delicacies sit on the counter inside the shop, where Aurora energetically helps herself while doing everything but lending a helping hand. Her mother loudly criticises this lack of effort, earning no more than an exasperated "But Harry's helping you, Mum!"
"I grew up with my aunt and her family. They weren't exactly the nicest people, so I took the first opportunity and got myself sent to boarding school with the savings my parents left me. There I met Ron. And Sirius." Potter spoke calmly as if he'd had this conversation too many times before. Draco's chest only hurt more. Surrounded by darkness, he groped blindly for Potter's rough hand on his shoulder, as soon as he found them, he intertwined their fingers. He could hear Potter exhaling beside him.
"The version of me, acting as a sort of host, in this case, may help you locate memories, but ultimately you're the one who must want to see them," Draco explains, somewhat absently, as he watches Pup sneak across the room.
Harry shuts his eyes and solely concentrates on the feeling of warmth and security he derives from his friends' touch. "I don't believe in it, and neither do you. Or Healer Isaksen. It's just an excuse to not have to deal with it any further."
Malfoy huffed, his expression astonishingly similar to his mother's – his nose scrunched up as if he had a foul odour under his nose. "No, Potter, usually witnesses are asked questions that they’re capable of answering. I wasn't even alive in Pythonel's time."
loose. Without another word, Draco stormed away and Harry stared incredulously at his hand. It had really worked.
After all, magical beings do not lose their magic as uneventfully as blood flows out of a wound. It should be impossible to lose one's magic at all, since it regenerates and multiplies, and therefore cannot run out. But in rare cases, the magic exits the body faster than it can regenerate. Isaksen has explained to Harry that detecting wounds on the magical surface of a wix is an impossibility, sealing them even more improbable. But if the loss of magic is due to a curse, it usually can be stopped.
Determined, I let out my held breath and pushed the door ajar. I recognised the interior immediately. Recognised the dirty ceramic washbasins, the cracked mirrors hanging above them, the toilet cubicles and the quivering figure with the white-blond hair leaning over one of the washbasins.
“Harry, tell Ron it was a spell!” Hermione called on Harry, who took his eyes off Draco and looked at Hermione in confusion. “Oh, forget it.”
Mr Potter, after shaking hands with everyone present and introducing himself to each of them individually, settles down at the round table and looks attentively at Anja. She decides to grant him credit for that. He seems to have understood that this is a hospital matter and not a government matter.
“I'm a virgin, by Merlin's beard!” Draco interrupted him gruffly, the pink flush immediately darkened noticeably.
So he got up without further ado and went over to the leather sofas, dragging Ron along. He only followed Draco's invitation, Ron could keep his bloody mouth shut. The "When I said that we shouldn't take sides, I didn't mean that you should drag me to the other party in front of Hermione's eyes" from Ron, fortunately only Harry heard.
“Have you changed your mind and deigned to tell me more about –” Harry faltered and gestured to Draco with his hand,  “– this?”
The throbbing pain in Harry’s head tells him that he is still among the living and forces him to open his eyes, only to squint them shut again the next moment. The harsh light proves bearable as long as he keeps his eyes closed. So Harry first deals with assessing his situation.
Following the Ford, Harry drove his scooter past a sign, which announced in large letters the "Weeping Willow Farmstead". Harry's grin broadened as the announced farm appeared in his view and he passed the farm gate at throttled speed.
This is not entirely true. Harry cannot help but think of Teddy, who has already sent him two owls and whose letters remain unopened on the nightstand next to his bed. Robards also sent him a letter when Claire was found. Harry has not yet managed to send his regards, but the news that she is safe and well relieved him immensely. Then there is Ron, through whom Parkinson acquired information about Draco's new location and who regularly hands him letters for Draco. Ron conscientiously passes these on to the latter, but even these envelopes sit sealed on Draco's nightstand beside his bed.
"Hetja will tölt if you give her leg aids. She may be four-gaited, but she rarely trots without enough weight and rein aids," Draco said, interrupting Harry’s thoughts. The blond slowed down until he walked, still backwards, at Harry's leg height.
Draco opened his eyes again and frowned as he looked down at Harry and grasped the meaning of his words. "Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm still angry with you, Harry."
Isaksen frowns but remains surprisingly calm. "Without my supervision, Mr Malfoy is left with hours at most."
It was late in the evening, the twelve had made themselves comfortable with ordered pizza in the small cinema room and had already watched two movies. The room radiated something cosy, the walls were covered with red velvet, the black leather armchairs they had pushed aside to have more space in front of the screen, which took up an entire wall. Slowly the first ones got tired and made themselves comfortable on the mattresses on the floor, the movies served rather as background sound, quiet conversations were held in small groups. But at the moment it was all about the choice of the next movie, Draco stood next to the DVD player, looked forbidden hot with his half ponytail and booty shorts and waited more or less patiently until the others agreed on a movie.
Draco’s smile only widened before he bit his lip and shrugged. “Too bad. See you later, Harry.” And with that, Draco turned on his heel and disappeared towards the Slytherin table.
Harry is certain about his decision. He toyed with the idea of consulting Hermione and Ron on Saturday morning, but since Hermione is devoting all her energy and time to her current case anyway, he has taken it as a hint of fate. He has to trust in himself – he judges both Malfoy and the situation correctly.
Blaise and Neville were also present on the glade and were just getting out of an off-road car when Draco and Harry stepped out of the thicket with a guilty expression on their faces. The looks of the three men were marked with reproach and relief, Blaise cursed quietly but very vulgarly as he pulled Draco into a short hug, Harry was greeted by a cheerful Hedwig. For Neville and his father, the relief seemed to predominate, but Mr Longbottom still put on a stern face.
Malfoy leapt down from the root and crouched in front of Parkinson before eyeing her with a tilted head. "The only thing disgusting about you is your taste in girls. Millie's so ugly even Vince wouldn't fancy her!"
His own magic seems far too powerful in contrast to Draco's, like a thundering waterfall trying to compete with a babbling brook. But it's not just Draco's magic that glimmers weakly. His heartbeat also drums powerlessly next to Harry's own. It is as if he is breathlessly pleading to be let go.
,” Draco said, with a hint of a smile on his lips, before he withdrew his hand. He seemed to struggle hard not to simply give in to his desire, but he controlled himself.
In the end, the choice fell on "The Shining", why one would want to watch a horror movie at this time of night was a mystery to Harry, but he used the time to observe Draco anyway. Draco started the movie, then climbed over Ginny and Luna and settled down in front of Harry, who leaned cross-legged against an overly large pillow. Draco threw Harry an overwhelming smile over his shoulder, he took it as an invitation to spread his legs, wrap his arms around Draco and pull him closer. Draco curled up in a ball between Harry’s legs, leaned against his chest and closed his eyes with relish.
"Hmm, in a moment," Harry replied and closed his eyes again. He would certainly not let himself be rushed.
Anja huffs, not bothering to comment that the confiscation of potentially dangerous items in Mr Malfoy's possession would have been more reasonable
Harry’s grey matter was in full swing. Was that an offer to…? To what exactly? He dared to doubt that Draco would suddenly give in and surrender to Harry, so what was the alternative? But the offer sounded tempting, no matter the outcome, maybe he should think less and nod more!
. That was a lot of pressure he didn’t need. And that confused him, rattled him. Merlin, if he hadn’t seen Draco crying last night, maybe all this would be easier. But Draco’s pain had been so palpable, so real.
It was only later that she discovered that Mr Malfoy's diary was not by chance so well known among the Aurors.
Harry’s belt fell and Draco, leaving no space between their bodies, set about opening his trousers. Hold on. What did this all boil down to? Harry truly couldn’t get enough of Draco’s touch, but he wouldn’t be able to cope with having to neglect Draco again. No, that would be too much to ask of his pride. After all, Harry wasn’t one to be served. He wanted to see Draco in ecstasy, to hear his moans, to feel his muscles twitching – oh Merlin, he couldn’t miss out on that any longer.
With a few steps he crosses the room, and without thinking about it, plants a kiss on Draco's head, who freezes in surprise, then snatches his wand from the tabletop and sprints towards the kitchen door. Not slowing his steps, he apparates while still in the hallway and only seconds later feels the hard ground of Diagon Alley beneath his feet.
Harry raised his head to look at Draco. He could practically feel his nervousness, it made his palms sweat. "Yes. And you? Can I –"
His tongue wet the pink skin, saliva pooled in the corners of his mouth and threatened to overflow. Harry opened his eyes, wallowing in the sight of Draco, which he caught in the mirror through long blond hair floating in his field of vision. His eyes blissfully closed, his head thrown back so that the long hair fell silvery over his shoulders and back, his body exposed and at the same time covered with beguiling fabric, he was the most captivating person Harry had ever seen.
hadn’t just arisen out of nothing and had a reason. Harry ignored his mind and tried to calm his racing heart. Did that mean that he was only so fond of Draco because his purpose was to save him? Did that make sense? Actually, his
Harry hardly noticed the conversations at the lunch table, he was too busy staring, not very discreetly, at a certain blond Slytherin. Since the incident before the transfiguration class, Harry couldn't stop brooding over what Draco's strange behaviour was all about. He had told his friends about it, but they didn't seem to understand his distrust, so Harry pondered on his own. If he didn't know better, he'd think Draco was afraid of water. Did that exist? Aquaphobia? Then why had Draco been at the lake? Shouldn't he generally avoid water if it frightened him?
"Oh my God, of course, he'll do it. Relax," Harry interrupted him, clearly dissatisfied with the loss of friction. But then he had a better idea. "You're okay with this, right? Do you want me to go on?"
The voice snaps Harry out of his stupor, adrenaline surges through his body and he dives aside. Aubrey's eyes widen in shock, she screams a curse that barely misses Harry and instead crashes into the wall behind him. Eyes squinted, Harry can only hear the curses whizzing past close to his ear.
