‘Merlin’s beard!’
‘How dare you defy your master!’ She spat, her eyes slowly moving from Dobby to Draco, ‘and you.’ Bellatrix’s eyes narrowed in on him, ‘what do you think you’re doing.’
‘I come to save you Harry Potter!’ The house elf chirped, looking curiously at the other people around the room.
‘Where on heaven's earth have you both been?’ Professor Snape’s familiar bitter voice exclaimed as both Harry and Draco walked through the iron gates of the castle.
‘Penelope Clearwater.’
Before Harry could register the fact that Draco knew about his invisibility cloak, Draco’s foot kicked at Harry’s nose. The blood trickled down his face and the pain that Harry couldn’t express through his vocal cords shot through his entire body like a virus.
Harry found himself shaken awake by non-other than Hermione the next morning. He rubbed the tiredness of another tumultuous night of sleep away from his eyes as he sat up.
‘What happened to you?’ Hermione said as Ron stopped shovelling food into his mouth to give Harry a look.
‘Malfoy,’ Harry said out of breath with his eyes focused on Draco’s figure that disappeared around the corner towards what Harry recognised to be Knockturn Alley. ‘I overheard his mother talking about some kind of appointment, it sounded suspicious.’
Harry was quick to snatch the letter from Hermione’s hands and crumple it in his fist. ‘Your guess is better than mine ‘Mione. I’ve been meaning to throw them away.’ He lied.
As soon as his body could move again, Harry was quick to sit up with indignation spread across his blood-stricken face. ‘What the hell is wrong with you?’
‘Expelliarmus!’
my best friend,’ Draco corrected him, ‘things have changed Blaise. I’ve changed.’
Thank you for reading <33
Harry opened his mouth to ask more questions, yet the sound of footsteps made him turn towards the door. He staggered closer to the barred door as he realised it was Draco, his forehead creased with stress.
‘Shouldn’t you be at the party?’ Draco asked, stopping directly in front of his friend.
‘Ginny?’
Filch scowled at Harry as if he was the one who had said the words and instantly let go of Draco who was now straightening the creases in his clothes, unwilling to meet Harry’s gaze. Slughorn was quick to get the party going again, directing his guest’s attention towards something else, but as Harry – amidst the bustle – walked closer to Draco, people whispered.
The lack of anger in Hermione’s tone made Harry raise an eyebrow at her.
‘Of course, I am.’ Draco said, the irritation in his tone made his words seem harsher. ‘Besides what does it matter, it’s not like potions class will be useful by next year.’
‘Dobby, can you apparate in and out of this room?’ Harry asked eagerly, a plan already unfolding within his mind.
‘Harry my boy!’ Slughorn said in indignation as he peered at his cauldron, ‘you were doing so well! What on earth went wrong?’
Slughorn didn’t react as Harry had expected, quickly moving the subject onto what he personally smelt to avoid lingering on Harry’s answer. As Harry turned to retake his position next to Ron, he noticed that everyone was avoiding his eyes now, everyone except Draco. The same indifference radiated from his lean body as he tilted his head, his icy eyes filled with thoughts Harry would never hear. Harry shivered now, hoping his words would be forgotten across the course of the lesson. But he knew this was highly unlikely.
Her lingering gaze on Hermione as if she was a piece of food to devour made Ron glare at her openly. Yet, before he could say anything, the sound of footsteps made Bellatrix divert her attention.
Draco nodded, ‘stop looking at me Potter.’ He seethed and fastened his pace, a look of fear passing over his face momentarily before he repressed it again.
‘Ah yes, Miss Granger.’ Slughorn repeated, his eyes swept over towards Harry. ‘Now can anyone besides Miss Granger tell me what the second potion might be.’
Harry stood up in an instant, ‘don’t you think I know that?’
‘I was spying on Malfoy in the Slytherin carriage.’
As their laughter quelled down, Ginny held out a piece of folded parchment towards Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Not anymore. I guess you could say I’m onto bigger things now.’
‘Let me mourn in peace then.’ Harry turned his back to him as he said this, using the sleeves of his sweatshirt to furiously rub at his eyes. He was finding it hard to control his grief lately. Harry had thought Cedric’s death was one of the most difficult things he would have to overcome, but the loss of his godfather was much more torturous.
‘Uh…’ Draco trailed off, surprised that Blaise was willing to continue their conversation. ‘I’m staying at Hogwarts for Christmas this year.’
The house elf nodded vigorously, ‘yes Harry Potter sir, Mr Malfoy told Biddy to come get Dobby sir and Dobby must be helping Harry Potter escape.’
Harry shook his head, ‘that’s not why.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron nodded to where Dumbledore was now standing, behind the podium engraved with the Hogwarts crest. Harry gave Ron a silent thank you as Hermione’s attention was immediately stolen away from the topic of his disappearance. For now, his excuse would work. But this being the first night back, Harry wasn’t sure of the many other problems that would eventually befall upon him over the rest of the school year. And to his dismay, there would be many involving Draco Malfoy.
With one look from Harry, Ron complied and took a step back. The goblin trudged towards the gate and quickly hobbled out as Draco cracked it open a little bit.
The leader narrowed his eyes suspiciously and grabbed the clipboard from his hand and began to peer at it. Harry couldn’t believe his luck as the man looked back at him as if he suddenly believed his story. He almost let out a breath of relief before a snatcher came bursting out of the tent with the daily prophet clutched in his hold.
Harry’s gaze lingered on Draco’s eyes, they were raw and red and were enough to get Harry to lower his wand. He was surprised that Draco was even here, in such a vulnerable state, in front of him as if he was ready to offer any form of comfort his body would allow.
‘He seems pretty angry.’
‘Yeah.’ Harry agreed, knowing it was anything but bullshit.
‘It was boring, besides, you and Potter?’
‘That’s the second time you’ve followed me now Potter.’ Draco drawled. He stood up; his palms pressed against the table as he turned his head.
The man cocked his head at this, ‘are any of them on the list?’ He asked the clipboard man who had been busily sifting through the various papers.
Harry had been too focused on analysing Draco to notice that his foot had been jerked out from the seat, causing a petite boy to trip and sprawl onto the floor of the train. A few of his fellow students laughed and jeered for him to watch where he was going. Draco, however, turned to look at the commotion and his piercing eyes lingered on the area where Harry sat. Harry held his breath as he waited for Draco’s gaze to divert itself, but it lingered for several moments.
‘Blimey…’Ron muttered, ‘he’s really taking this whole evil Slytherin thing a bit too seriously.’
Draco opened his mouth to reply, but he realised he couldn’t conjure up a response. And so, he simply turned around and ran, his long legs carrying him further away from the boy who had lived.
‘Hey Ron? Tell Ginny I’ll be right back, I just need to check something.’
Harry couldn’t help but feel disappointment swell within him because of this. He had missed receiving regular letters after Sirius’s passing and even though his friends promised to write often, their letters were sparse and trivial. Draco’s letters had been the only consistent ones and now even they were gone.
As Draco and the goblin turned to move up the stairs, Harry desperately called out, ‘Draco.’
Harry felt the panic flourish through him as they were all dragged outside of the tent into the chilled night air. If they were taken to the ministry, it would be game over, everything would be over.
With a glance at her watch and a realisation that the party had begun half an hour ago, Hermione ushered both boys out of the common room and towards Slughorn’s office. Harry hadn’t expected the party to be tainted with such a vestige of formality, however as they passed through the tight security, they walked into a room filled with people of importance. Within the vicinity of his first steps in the room, Harry had recognised a member of the weird sisters, a quidditch player he distinguished from Ron’s posters and countless ministry officials.
‘THEY’LL KILL HER!’ Draco yelled, his pupils shaking as he finally looked up to meet Harry’s eyes.
Harry felt in his pocket for his invisibility cloak and again swept it over his body. He knew that what he was doing was reckless, after all he was potentially putting himself at risk of being caught by unfriendly Slytherins. He knew they wouldn’t take lightly to anyone – especially Harry Potter – eavesdropping on their conversations but Harry had decided it was worth a try. If only he could obtain some form of concrete proof about Malfoy, he would be nipping a problem in the bud.
‘Harry you’re the only one who needs new robes. Why don’t you go in whilst Ron and I stay outside with Hagrid?’ Hermione suggested, eyeing the group of people already in the shop.
‘Forgive me Harry, I didn’t acknowledge it in order to make you guilty.’
Without his permission, a tear escaped from the corner of Harry’s eyes. He hadn’t known how much he had needed someone to acknowledge his pain until now. His friends had avoided the topic, deciding that Harry was better off dealing with his emotions in private. But Harry had needed the opposite, he had wanted pity so desperately. And Draco was the only one giving it to him.
Draco Malfoy had seen Harry Potter cry on two rare occasions. The first had come a few days after the concluding of the disastrous Triwizard Tournament that not even Draco had enjoyed by the end. He was on his usual nightly stroll around the outside courtyard of the castle, it being the only time of the day where he could shake the relentless presence of the boys he had been forced to call his friends; Crabbe and Goyle. Draco found himself becoming increasingly misanthropic as the weather warmed and the leaves on the trees began to blossom and fill with vivid colour again.
‘I thought you said you’d find someone?’ Hermione said disapprovingly as Harry descended from the boy’s dormitories, clad in his brand-new dress robes and clearly alone.
Hermione crossed her arms over the stark wine-coloured dress she was wearing, a quiet Ron next to her was attired in dress-robes very unlike the ones from the Yule ball. The tie he was wearing matched perfectly to the colour of Hermione’s dress and Harry knew that Hermione had most likely transfigured it to match.
‘That’s not something you say to someone who just saved you from a very awkward predicament.’
Due to their raised voices, Hermione was quick to enter the tent and look frantically from boy to boy.
‘He’s not a death eater.’
‘Didn’t you show interest in wanting to be an auror.’ Blaise said.
Draco remained stoic, simply staring at Harry’s face. He didn’t say anything in response.
Ron stalked towards them, ready to say something but Harry held up his hand to signal for him to wait.
‘He hates me and I’m not going to beg for his forgiveness.’ Draco said immediately, wincing slightly at the mention of Theo.
Harry glanced at it to see another death eater attack grazing the front page and immediately looked away. His stomach was already turning enough of its own accord.
‘I was just wondering where you and Miss Granger had gotten to.’ Slughorn chortled, moving past Ron to greet Hermione.
‘Let’s go see if Mum’s finished with lunch.’
‘Looks like we’re going to have to walk.’ Draco observed.
‘An intervention? I’m not a child!’
Harry turned his head to see it was Blaise Zabini who had spoken, a smirk on his lips as his peers joined him in jeering at Harry. Draco didn’t even raise his eyes to look, seemingly uninterested in the entire affair.
‘One minute.’
Harry figured Ron was semi-right, his performance always suffered greatly under the mounts of pressure. His nerves always found a way to overpower him, but Harry was hoping they’d sidestep for at least today for Ron’s sake as well as his. Hermione, however, seemed to be in an elated mood as she approached the pair, dressed in thick wool for the autumn weather.
Draco stood still for what felt like several minutes, the sky began to darken around them, yet Harry did not lift his head up. His crying had stopped now, yet his body shook with the aftermath of hiccups.
‘When do you go back to the Manor?’ Blaise pressed.
This time, it was Lucius who strode towards Draco and grasped onto his shoulder. Draco became rigged at his father’s touch and frowned.
Draco was stressed, knowing that once he got home, his mother would be hysterical and demand comfort from him. It wasn’t that he minded, he loved her more than anything and was more than willing to support her, but he knew his father’s imprisonment meant things were to change drastically. Not only would his previous ministry connections dissipate, his fellow death eaters would also look down on his failure to obtain the prophecy from the ministry. Draco didn’t even want to think about the dark lord’s reaction to all of this, it only made his stomach turn and made the trifle he’d eaten at dinner threaten to spill out of his mouth.
‘Shove off Harry,’ Ron retorted, his face significantly paler than usual.
‘Listen Harry – ‘
‘I’m not hungry.’
‘Shit!’
a hint for the next chapter: it involves the sectumsempra spell...
‘I lied yesterday when I said I tripped.’ Harry mumbled.
‘It wasn’t a very clever ploy was it?’ Hermione observed.
‘Harry?’ Hermione said behind him. Her eyes focused on his exposed ankles that now showed under the invisibility cloak as he had grown taller.
‘Is that why you’re always trying to save me Potter? Do you want me to get on my fucking knees and kiss your feet?’ Draco’s words were rushed with anger.
Dumbledore stayed silent for a few moments, his eyes showing he was mulling over Harry’s concerns in his mind. Harry waited for a response, eager to know what the professor would conclude about such an exchange. However, as Dumbledore smiled, he knew their thoughts weren’t aligned.
‘And you?’
things are getting complicated :0
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry pressed his sleeve to his bleeding nose, ‘I wonder whose fault that is.’
He only shrugged. ‘Your guess is better than mine Blaise.’
The colour drained from Draco’s face as Snape stalked towards them, looking ridden with rage. He ignored Harry’s presence, stopping next to Draco’s rigid figure.
‘Professor Flitwick can deal with you Potter.’ Snape said, saying his name between clenched teeth. ‘I suggest you follow me to my office Mr Malfoy.’
ty for reading <3
‘It was hardly an adventure Ron.’ Hermione corrected him as she glanced at Harry, ‘plus, I don’t think Knockturn Alley is particularly somewhere anyone would want to be.’
Ron glanced at Harry with his mouth parted, possibly thinking similar thoughts of how coincidental the entire situation was. But, as they delved into the dim room illuminated only by scattered lamps and a roaring fireplace, Draco was nowhere to be seen. Instead, it was his parents and belligerent aunt who stood eagerly waiting.
Harry thought for a moment. "I would if that bloke was you."
“Why can’t you go?” Harry questioned immediately, and Malfoy scoffed.
Harry stared at him expectantly, “What is it?” Harry thought of eighteen embarrassing and awful things he could be asked in the few seconds that it took for Malfoy to respond.
“He is,” Harry whispered back, “Better than I could ever have imagined. I want to be with him, I know that now. But I don’t think it will ever be possible. Maybe this was all foolish. Maybe I should just move on.”
“Why don’t we go see your kids?” Molly asked kindly, “I have a feeling they need to talk to you.”
Dean shrugged, “I would have married you a month into dating.”
He said all this stiffly and without looking at Harry.
Harry grinned, “I’m glad you approve.”
Even the match, which is one of the closest and most intriguing he has ever watched, couldn’t distract him. As his family cheered heartedly as Angelina scored her first goal, he remained silent, watching Draco out of the corner of his eye. Draco, the constant master of normalcy, seems to be enjoying himself fully as he talked avidly to his son and Blaise, who were sitting on either side of him. It made Harry feel almost as if he had imagined the kiss. Clearly, that wasn’t the case, but it would have made much more sense. The last thing Harry had expected when he pulled Draco under those bleachers was for him to kiss Harry. To fulfill the longing Harry had felt for weeks. Had it been a moment of weakness? Draco had been the most emotionally vulnerable Harry had ever seen him. Harry’s kind words probably made him feel good in the moment and he lost his cool and kissed Harry. How else could the look of panic and regret in Draco’s eyes be explained? Was Harry nothing more than a panicked kiss in the face of loneliness?
“Savant was hard at work when I left at midnight. There’s no way he’s left yet. Unless of course he’s fallen asleep. And Aviary hasn’t left the office in the past week,” Ida told him.
Harry could sense she was a little alarmed, so he attempted to comfort her, “Yes, but there is no one to worry about, of course. Most of the original order is dead. The only ones who know about it now are the Weasleys, Hermione, Fleur, Kingsley, Hagrid and McGonnagall. And besides, none of them have been here in years. I own the house, so Ginny and I are the only ones who have really been here since after the war.”
“Hermione dropped her off?” Harry asked. Rose was Ron and Hermione’s daughter.
He said this without actually looking at Harry. Was Draco ever going to look him in the eye again?
Draco walked through the door. Harry’s heart jumped into his throat. Was he going to be this taken aback every fucking time Draco walked in the room? Although he still looked as though he hadn’t slept in days (most likely because he hadn’t), he looked stunning with his hair freshly combed back and with a soft blue jumper and black jeans.
“Harry… Harry?” A voice broke through Harry’s deafening thoughts. He looked up to see Seamus standing next to him.
“We all did,” Aviary spat, “I’ve worked side by side with her for the past couple months. Hearing her voice… speaking to Gani…” she trailed off as her face went still with fear and anger.
Harry made his way to the next room and read the note on the door. His instructions for Zabini were nearly identical to his instructions for Reyes. Their injuries were probably similar. Harry only knew that Aries had broken his arm from falling from a high altitude during quidditch. That left Harry to wonder whether Blaise had anything to do with it, but he hadn’t wanted to ask Reyes out of reluctance to talk to the prick anymore than he had to.
As Draco kneeled down in front of Harry, Harry felt the breath leave his lungs. It had been a long time since their eyes had met and now that they were, Harry felt as if he could collapse within Draco’s arms at any given moment. Draco’s face hadn’t changed much, yet the same taint of tiredness that had been on Draco’s face that night in the tower was still casted over his ashen skin. Draco’s pupils began to shake as he stared into Harry’s pleading ones, he already knew it was Harry, he could recognise him anywhere. But the pained look on his face was enough to show that he was afraid of speaking, knowing that anything he said would determine whether Harry lived or survived this. Not to mention, the spell Hermione had casted was slowly dissipating and with every moment that passed, Harry was looking more and more like himself.
As Harry left Dumbledore’s office that night, he found himself less dejected than he thought he would be. He had expected such a reaction after all, being used to pursuing things alone. Of course, the majority of the times, he had his best friends alongside him, aiding him in the best way they could, but this time was different. Something within Harry told him that this was a journey he had to experience as an individual. He shuddered as he walked through the Gryffindor dorms, recoiling at Dumbledore comparing him to such a person as Draco Malfoy. It was an insult at best.
All Cormac said in response was, ‘that’s a shame.’
‘Shut up Ron.’ Both Harry and Ginny chimed synchronously, causing all four of them to burst into laughter.
Hi! It took me awhile but here is this epilogue! I know it would've been better to write a sequel but i don't think i'd have any time to write one so I just decided to push a scene from DH into the epilogue. Thank you so much for reading this fanfic! I really appreciated all the lovely comments :(<333 but yas #DRARRYHAPPYENDING WOOOH!
The guard’s eyes widened as he looked at Harry whose face was still red and puffy with the spell Hermione casted. Even though he looked unconvinced, he still moved to open the gate and allowed the snatchers to drag them across the winding path of the lawn. As Harry looked around, trying to determine where it was that they had been brought, he couldn’t help but feel as if he was somewhere significant, somewhere familiar.
Whilst Harry continued crying, Draco couldn’t bring himself to indicate his presence, his body felt as if he was being filled with cement that disallowed it to move in the slightest. A bitter taste filled his mouth, he struggled to determine what he was exactly feeling in that moment. Was it second-hand embarrassment? Disappointment? Or. Draco though, is this sympathy I’m feeling right now?
‘I just don’t feel like talking lately.’
‘Draco,’ Harry said, holding him upright as the wind blew through their hair and the water splashed against their shoes.
‘Well you look particularly perky this morning,’ Harry said the next morning as he took a seat opposite his jittering best friend.
Trigger warning: violence, death.
‘He’s in the Slytherin common room.’
‘Didn’t know you fancied lads Potter.’
‘Bill and Fleur’s cottage,’ Ron cut in, wincing at Hermione’s prolonged scream up ahead. ‘It’s a shell cottage on the outskirts of Tamworth.’
‘Granger, sir.’
Ron’s words were enough to make Harry stop in place and swivel his body to look at his best friend in indignation.
‘Not much. All he said was that he was onto bigger things.’ Harry explained, ‘he knew I was there, so my guess is he probably didn’t say anything incriminating on purpose.’
‘So, you’re telling me you both went off on an adventure without me and you’re only telling me now?’ Ron exclaimed as the trio sat in their usual carriage on the Hogwarts Express.
‘Harry!’ Hermione screamed with such an intensity that both boys froze, ‘you can’t say his name. It’s taboo!’
Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas who had been listening in suddenly averted their eyes as Harry glanced at them.
Letting out a breath, Draco’s forehead pressed against Harry’s shoulder as he began to cry. He had waited so long for this day, waited so long to be free of his fate and to be within Harry’s arms and now, here he was. Even though there was no inclination as to what would occur the next day or the days after that, all Draco knew now was that he would live and die with Harry. That everything to come, they would do together.
‘God knows what he plans to do with the Liquid Luck he won today.’ Harry said bitterly, the image of Draco’s expression of victory that had unfairly lightened up his blurred complexion pitched in his mind.
Chapters will slowly get longer <3 Thank you for reading <3
The familiar turning of his stomach began.
Draco let out a bitter laugh, one he had probably intended to sound indifferent. But Harry could tell his façade was threatening to disintegrate at any moment.
‘Hermione?’
Draco stared blankly at him, the creases in his face smoothing out as his face relaxed. Harry couldn’t comprehend what he was thinking as a minute of silence passed. It suddenly felt as if they were the only two people under the castle’s roof, the sound of their mingled breathing permeating the bubble of air around them. With his eye’s shifting upwards, Draco’s face softened enough for Harry to follow his direction of sight.
‘No.’
‘Look carefully Draco…If we were the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, e-everything would be okay again.’
‘Maybe you should interrogate him later ‘Mione.’ Ron cut in, to Harry’s relief, ‘Harry looks pretty tired and besides, Dumbledore’s about to give his welcome speech.’
‘Malfoy’s sending you owls?’ Ron said in equal shock, looking from the letters to Harry’s face as if a reason would appear out of thin air and make itself known.
‘I tripped.’ Harry dismissed and picked up the goblet closest to him and guzzled its sweet contents.
Harry wondered what Hermione and Ron would think when they would return to a now empty carriage. Hermione especially would know he was doing something impulsive and Harry was already silent bracing himself for the lecture she would give him as the train slowed down. The Slytherin students began to chatter incessantly as they collected their trunks and caged pets and began to trail out of the carriage. All of them except Draco were standing up and as Harry noticed him wave away his friends, an uneasiness filled his gut.
‘Can you believe them? Coming to conclusions like that when girls can wear cologne too!’ Hermione hissed as they crossed the lawn.
‘Then what?’
‘Don’t hurt me,’ Wormtail squeaked out, abiding by Ron’s request and letting his wand fall to the ground.
‘Harry my boy!’ Slughorn exclaimed abruptly, ‘why don’t you give it a go and tell us what you smell.’
Harry rose his head at the sound of footsteps, the stray tears still trailing down his placid cheekbones.
Greyback shrugged, ‘it was in the girl’s bag.’
‘Quick, get under.’ Harry lifted the edge of the invisibility cloak to let Hermione under, covering both of their bodies from view.
‘I do?’
Harry nodded, ‘he needed my help in recruiting a new teacher, apparently I’m a pretty convincing person.’
Even though Draco and the girl were talking, Harry could only see their mouths move, too far away to hear their muttered words. The girl shifted on her feet as she looked at Draco with a look filled with lust and inexperienced shyness. Harry recognised this emotion easily, having experienced it himself with Cho, but the emotion on Draco’s face was less comprehendible. He winced as the girl touched his arm and leaned in, her lips pressing against his unresponsive ones.
‘You hungry mate?’ He asked.
‘We’ll see.’ Harry replied through gritted teeth, glancing at Ron who was currently being coached by Hermione on the benches.
Harry nodded in response, his eyes lingering on the cabinet which Draco’s hand was still leaned against. A chill swept across his body as Draco sneered at the man, his inaudible words seemingly harsh enough to make the attendant pale. Harry found himself questioning whether the Draco who had sent him letters was the same as the one in front of him right now.
Draco’s expression significantly darkened at this and having not noticed Harry behind the family already waiting, they left the shop. Harry’s interest was piqued by Narcissa mentioning an appointment and he considered ignoring his curiosity for the sake of a pair of fresh robes. However, Harry found his interest could not be quelled and he took out his invisibility cloak, swinging it over his body.
‘Barny Weasley.’
Harry’s eating also remained disordered; Hermione forced food upon his plate, but he was too overwhelmed with the many concerns haunting his thoughts and dreams to swallow them. He struggled to balance the various things occurring amongst him and the approaching meeting with Professor Dumbledore would only work to frazzle his mind further. There was no escaping it anymore, Harry could only guess that this was only the calm before the storm.
‘What’s wrong with his face,’ Draco muttered, scanning Harry’s malformed face in worry.
The snatcher's wand practically flew into Harry’s hands allowing him to quickly turn towards Narcissa who was now charging towards him with a spell. Lucius Malfoy was the first to fight back, sneering at Ron as his personal vendetta against the Weasley’s began to surface. Bellatrix screamed behind them, ordering the fearful snatchers to do something yet none of them seemed to be listening. Harry could sense Narcissa raising her wand and disarmed her an instant, ready to mutter a spell in response when Draco stepped in between both of their figures. Instantly reminded of their broil in the girl’s lavatory, Harry shivered as he easily blocked the jinx Draco had sent his way.
‘Draco did you hear what I said?’ Pansy Parkinson called, snapping her fingers in front of Draco’s face.
This chapter ended up being really long so it took me a while to write it >.< Thank you for reading everyone <3 RIP happy Drarry...
Whatever this indecisive emotion he was currently being invaded with; Draco knew for a tangible fact that he didn’t like it in the slightest. This boy crying in front of him was the same one Draco had sworn he would hate till the day he died. Harry Potter was a boy that made his skin crawl with the sensation of insects exploring it and made him act in malicious ways, even when his better judgement warned him not to. Yet, for Draco, Harry was also a boy who ensured he couldn’t sleep at night, filling his dreams on various nights with sweet moments that made him question what his own true motives were.
Lucius furrowed his brows, ‘that looks nothing like Potter.’
Observing the colour of Draco’s complexion in the light, Harry realised just how malnourished he looked. His face had a gauntness that Harry recognised as a result of a mixture of nightmares and a lack of nutrition.
Harry shook his head instantly, ‘she didn’t say anything, they won’t. I saw her face Draco, before we apparated, I saw the relief on her face.’
‘Draco – ‘
‘Harry! Wake up already, it’s almost noon for god’s sake!’
Harry gave him a confused look, ‘what?’
With the last day before they returned being filled with numerous order members visiting the burrow, Harry and Hermione hadn’t gotten the chance to fill Ron in on what they had witnessed in Knockturn Alley. Harry couldn’t help but find his mind consumed with Draco and the outlandish cabinet he had been touching even when Ginny had tried to gain his attention with her coy remarks.
‘We found him that way,’ a snatcher answered.
Narcissa looked as nervous as Harry as she nodded at the house elf who scampered away instantly. Feeling his breathing hitch, Harry felt a sharp kick at the back of his kneecaps force him down to the ground as Bellatrix looked towards Ron and Hermione.
Narcissa Malfoy stood near, her eyes searing holes at Madam Malkin as she listened to her son. ‘Yes, that will work just fine. We should be getting to our appointment now.’
As Draco walked into the clearing, Harry stood back, hiding behind the stone wall. The sound of a second voice, one sickly sweet and feminine made Harry peer slightly around the corner of the wall to see Draco standing in front of a lean girl with dark raven tresses. Harry couldn’t put a name to her face, another nameless Slytherin he had overlooked before.
Harry only nodded, too tired with the conversation to persuade his friends any further. As both Hermione and Ron left for prefect duty several minutes later, Harry found it difficult to control his jerking knee. He knew Draco was most likely in the Slytherin carriage right now, detailing his newfound death eater identity to the rest of his cronies. If only Harry could be there right now, he would hear everything and prove to Hermione and Ron that he wasn’t being paranoid.
Before Ron could open his mouth and say something enraged with bitterness, Hermione was dragging him away towards a waiter holding a tray of hor d'oeuvres.
Usually such a remark would’ve been enough to make Harry chuckle, yet he was too burned out to even move his facial muscles more than necessary.
The hurt passed over Ron’s face in an instance and he remained quiet for several moments, looking at Harry in an undefinable way.
‘Of course, I wouldn’t want anyone else as keeper.’
‘This is quite a party sir,’ Harry said, his eyes glazing over the extravagant decorations set up.
As Harry entered the shop, he heard Hagrid begin to tell both Ron and Hermione an amusing story about Buckbeak settling back into his previous home. He sighed as he stood behind the group of people, knowing it would probably take longer than he had originally expected.
‘Speaking of taking a hint, ‘Ginny said, nudging her head to signal behind Harry. ‘Looks like Cormac’s come over to convince you how he deserves the keeper position for the thousandth time.’
Harry was taken aback by how much weight Draco had lost, his usual prominent cheekbones were even more visible now, perched higher on his face. His icy grey eyes were free of the childishness he displayed whenever he teased Harry and were now devoid of any emotion. As Madam Malkin accidentally poked Draco’s side, he yelped out and his handsome face became contorted with displeasure.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘It’s probably just a ploy,’ Harry said quickly and moved forward to scrunch the rest of the letters in his hands.
‘I almost forgot; McGonagall told me to pass this on. It’s from Dumbledore.’ She said, waving at the trio as she ventured towards the girl’s dormitories.
‘I said not to touch my arm, didn’t I?’ A familiar voice sneered to Harry’s left. He turned his head to see Draco standing in front of a visibly nervous Madam Malkin pinning at his robes.
‘Why do you always have to run away?’ Harry said in exasperation, following Draco’s hurrying figure.
‘Exactly what I’ve been trying to say!’ Hermione said as Harry fell back into his seat in defeat.
The finality in his tone left no room for Draco to argue, Harry watched as he mindlessly followed Snape. As Draco walked away, his body slumped down in defeat and Harry knew he had to overhear their conversation. He waited for them to turn the corner before he pulled out his invisibility cloak and flung it upon his body.
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
She pulled her head out to check with Harry, who nodded. "Alright. Thanks, Bill. I’ll write later. Glad you're home for a while!"
Draco writhed under Harry and began to beg. “Harry, please! I want you in me, Harry! I want you in me when I cum!”
“You mean like this...?
Harry felt himself harden at his husband's words. He pushed his growing erection into the other man's hip and heard a whimper. "I love the way you let me take control of you...of your beautiful body..." He cast a spell and smiled as both he and Draco were rendered nude. Harry ran his hands over the lithe body that was already showing a slight swelling in the abdomen. "My love and our children...You have no idea how happy you've made me, Draco. I want you so badly, baby."
Harry gave in to his emotions yet again and allowed Lucius to comfort him. “Thank you...” When he was calm again and felt steady enough for a public appearance, he told Lucius to get his son down to the chapel and he’d be there shortly.
Cautiously Lyra’s little foot inched forward. Draco held her steady as she brought her other foot to meet the first. Then she plopped down on her bottom and pouted. She held her hands out to Harry and demanded, “No Papa. You come.”
Kreacher popped in holding Harry’s arm.
“He interrupted a meeting with my parents.” Draco chuckled at the thought of that first day. “He treated me like an adult...and just before he left he whispered something in my ear...”
"You also inherit the Potter vaults." Korlag reminded him. "That includes full access to your trust vault as well as your parents joint vault."
Harry glared at the older man but spoke gently to Draco. “Defend yourself, Draco.”
Harry wandered Draco’s suite of rooms, shaking his head at the differences between his childhood and Draco’s.
Lip trembling, Draco did as he was told.
Draco sat in Harry’s lap as he expressed his excitement and anticipation for the next lesson. “I have homework due next week, Harry. Al won’t be back until I’ve finished this assignment so I‘ll be doing more bookwork than anything over the next few days but the books are so interesting that we almost didn’t even notice what time it was.”
“Have you chosen a name yet?” Kingsley asked taking a turn to feel the baby kick.
"Lord Potter, please take a seat and allow me to tell you a story." Headmistress Prewitt smiled kindly at him. "A long time ago, this school was founded by Helga Hufflepuff's granddaughter, Gunnora. She'd just been introduced to her own granddaughter..."
“I’ll just bet it has a castle on it too. Doesn’t it?” Ron asked disdainfully. “You’re starting to have more in common with Malfoy than me, mate.”
Draco huffed. "Did you look at all?"
“Very funny.” Draco glared playfully at him. “Dry your bed and get dressed so we can try to head him off. I want to know something before him.”
“Harry, I don’t want to impose any further.” Again Draco seemed nervous but Harry chalked it up to his relationship with Viktor. “Would you mind terribly if I used your floo to get to the manor?”
Olgok got the hint and gave the rest of the chocolate to the squib. Young Potter was an uncommonly generous wizard.
"They died before she did, Harry." Vera explained calmly. "She obviously thought he was a friend."
“Of course he’ll probably still be a bit jealous of my role in your life and act like his usual domineering self most of the time, but I feel like we really had a breakthrough up there this morning.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hand.
“Mrs. Malfoy…he’s one of the few people who has never treated me like a celebrity. I’ve had quite a bit of interest in him for the last several years. We’ve saved each other and I think we have a sort of respect for one another. He’s also very handsome…Affection can grow from attraction.” Harry looked at his fiancé. “If the ministry hadn’t interfered, I would’ve asked to date him. I would’ve wooed him…and figured out whether we had what it took to last before taking the trip up the aisle.”
The blond let out a frustrated huff. "She could've at least given me names."
Draco smirked. His father wasn’t usually one to believe in superstitious stuff and nonsense like the story Harry was about to tell. The blond truly didn’t think the pup would be joining their family anytime soon.
Harry suddenly recognized this man as one who was not to be trifled with. He’d always seemed weak to Harry because of his position with Voldemort, but now Harry could see what most others saw when looking at him and Lucius Malfoy suddenly seemed to be a pillar of strength.
Remus didn't waste time as he hurried out the door.

“I am doing well, I believe, My Lord.” Severus said as he entered the room. “Draco, you have a letter.”
“Nobody would ever know it was you…” Harry murmured softly and Draco thought he heard a note of longing in the other man’s voice.
"Well, my boy, you are legally an adult... you are a Lord... you're finding many interesting things inside the castle... I suppose, I thought that perhaps you could help me." Albus smiled down at him. "You have done so before, after all."
Harry sighed and went to get dressed.
"After the war...after the trials...I had to decide what to do with my life." Harry began noticing as he did so that Draco relaxed a little. "I had grown tired of dispelling dark magic and hunting dark wizards. So I decided that law enforcement was not the path for me."
“Whatever. Get on with it. What’s this plan?” She huffed.
"No, dad. Harry saved my life tonight...and this is how you repay him?" Dudley shook his head sadly. "He clearly values me more than you do. If he's not welcome here then neither am I. C'mon, Harry. Let's get out of here."
Harry beamed as he echoed her sentiment. “Do you like them? Are they as helpful as he said they’d be?”
His heart pounded as his eyes met Harry's and he extended his hand.
Harry nodded to Viktor who was just finished suiting up as they walked in. “I hear Draco’s going to sit this one out.”
“No worries, Harry. Papa knows it isn’t public knowledge yet.” Luna’s smile widened. “He also knows lots more about you.”
“Yes…if he was here and capable of training Draco, I’d trust him.” Harry nodded. “He might’ve been a git to me and the other Gryffindors, but he was also a good man with many skills. I didn’t like him as a person… but if I needed a potion, there was nobody better. He was also your godfather; wasn’t he, Draco?”
“Pleasant to...” Ron reached to put a hand on Harry’s forehead. “Are you feeling alright?”
“Draco, would...” Harry paused as he turned to find his three companions staring at him in several degrees of shock. “W-What?”
Draco felt Harry’s clothed arousal pressing against his hip while the other man plundered his mouth. He moaned with want and whimpered his husband’s name when Harry’s lips moved to his throat. His hands slid down Draco’s sides and stroked his lower back.
A moment later, Dobby appeared. “Yes, Professor?”
“A bit.” Harry admitted with a weak glare. “Too many things going on in my head. If you'll excuse me, I’m supposed to meet with Mcgonagall.” He walked over to where the teachers were gathered and attempted to gain her attention. “Excuse me, Professor?”
Harry sighed. “Yes, Draco…that is Rita Skeeter. C’mon, I know it’s you!”
Harry grinned and kissed his son on the nose. “Grandpa has you, my little hunter. I’m going to wake Teddy.”
“Then, why are you sad? From the sound of that kiss, you should be over at his house rather than here.” Teddy waved vaguely around himself to indicate the house.
"How do you know?" Ginny asked.
"Nice!" Harry heard his godfather's voice clearly through the connection. "Although, old Sluggy always was easily impressed."
"Physical proximity?" Harry asked. "Or in a relationship?"
Harry’s hand came up to meet Draco’s as he looked down at the sparkling gems. A soft sigh escaped Harry’s lips a he unconsciously rubbed his friend's knuckles.
******** ******** Chapter 28 ******** ********
Ginny and the twins had found interesting things in the library. Sirius and Remus had enjoyed their time alone. Dudley had napped after some more studying of the books Arthur had mentioned.
“But if there’s no penalty then there’s no motivation for anyone to do what you’re asking of them, Hermione!” Draco argued.
"After dinner, I'm taking you for a walk along a beach I know that's on the outskirts of Tinworth," Harry told him.
A problem with his vaults? That would imply more than one. He had an estate manager? He had an estate to manage? Harry didn't really know what to make of that so he resolved to ask Vernon to take him to London the next day. He folded the letter and sat down on a swing sighing in frustration. It was hot and he could barely feel a breeze so, when no other owls dropped by, he was forced to accept that his friends were not going to contact him anytime soon. He'd just about had enough of the whole situation and was working up the motivation to go back to Privet drive when Dudley and his gang chose that moment to pass by laughing. He didn't have to be a certified seer to predict the next few minutes.
Harry grinned. “Your father hasn’t been as aggravating as I’d expected he would be, so there’s not much to argue about, there. I’m not a terribly unreasonable person, love.”
Harry nodded carefully. “So he’s better now that Voldemort is gone?”
"Oh yes! Harry's been taking good care of us." Draco smirked over at the brunette as his hand rested on his baby-bump.
Ron muttered to himself.  "Or both."
Harry watched her turn to leave when he remembered something. “What about the mood swings?”
“They don't necessarily have to go to waste..." Harry murmured as his eyes began to close.
Pansy snickered as she watched this. "Yes, Draco; your family is definitely an experience, alright."
"Like what, Harry?" Remus asked, taking out a small notepad.
Harry didn’t waste time. He kept Draco in his arms until they stood in the sitting area of their suite.
His eyes shot wide open. “What?!”
“How can I trust you after this?” Harry asked, disappointedly standing. “I wanted more for us than to be friendly acquaintances."
"Now for the money." Harry said, setting his teeth. "I accept everything from my dad's side of the family without question. But from my mum's side, I want you to combine the amount in the vault Dudley is due to inherit with the amount in the one I inherited and cut it down the middle. I get half and he gets half. It's only fair."
"Your title is easily inferred from that, Harry." Luna grinned at them. "Especially since nobody around these parts is named Earl. Isn't that right, Mac?"
"Indeed, Lord Potter." Snape's voice made Harry stiffen in surprise as the older man came out from behind a tapestry. "The Headmaster needed Professor Mcgonagall's assistance so I was sent to explain." He sniffed with disinterest. "She will meet with you in the morning after breakfast."
"There was a rush of air as I reached for the door...and the book too, now that I think about it." Harry said cautiously. "When I woke from the dream just now, and needed light, a candle lit itself."
"Draco, find us a seat, won't you? I'll be right behind you." Harry winked at his husband and turned back to the Minister. "Kingsley, I wonder if you have anyone here who could check for consummation..."
"It gave me the nightmares that night because I hadn't spent much time in my old house." Sirius explained. "Olgok got rid of the spells on me easily. Remus's are a little more difficult."
Harry gave a token protest as soon as he realized what had happened, but ducked away with a short word to Arthur about checking on Draco. He opened the door slightly and peeked in. The dog scurried through the door and over to where Draco’s arm was hanging over the side of the bed. She sniffed, licked, and then got comfortable on her cushion. Draco was still asleep and the Healer’s assistant was cleaning up so when neither of them objected to Selene’s presence, he smiled and backed out of the room.
Draco shook his head and admonished his husband for his theatrics.
“Yes he is…” Draco grinned. “I wish your papa was here to see him…”
“Guys!” Pansy glanced around to make sure nobody had heard them.
"I have." Harry nodded once. "I sent Charlie a  card at Christmas and I wrote to Bill after your letter came back... just to see if I could."
Harry growled and turned the blond around kissing and licking his throat. “I’m so close, Dragon… I’m going to cum in you…I’m going to mark you as mine.”
Harry frowned at Lucius. “It has nothing to do with clothing or position during sex, Lucius. It’s the fact that he wants limits and someone to make the important choices for him. It’s the fact that he wants to feel protected rather than being the shield that protects someone else.”
The brunette narrowed his eyes at the blond; something in the tone of his husband’s voice didn’t ring true to him. “I want to see the memory of you writing that letter...”
Nodding back, she conjured parchment, ink and a quill and began to write. “As Mr. Malfoy-Potter is pregnant at the moment, he cannot brew some of the potions Mrs. Tonks requires. Would Master Loveday be able to brew them?”
"So, I went for a walk and a Gringotts' owl was able to approach me." Harry chuckled, thinking about it. "I’m sure you can imagine my surprise and confusion when I’d only been told about my trust vault but suddenly this goblin calling himself my estate manager was telling me I had a whole estate that included multiple vaults and, as if that weren’t enough, there was some discrepancy."
Head spinning, Draco gasped having not expected Harry to appear so quickly. Taking in the other man’s expression, he knew he was in trouble.
“Re-introduced would be the proper word, Ms. Granger.” Their former teacher commented offhand.
Olgok nodded slightly. "Your wandless magic is in need of fine tuning. A bit of practice and that should stop."
“You got called away...” Nana asked. “By whom?”
"I will answer this one last time and then I don't want to hear the question again." Draco warned his best friend. "It is highly unlikely that he knows. If he does, I will be asking him how he found out."
Draco set the spells in place as soon as the door closed behind them.
Draco nodded frantically, “Y-Yes, Master!”
“Your hair has begun to grow back and your skin has a more natural tone!” Draco commented.
“I know Minerva is the cat, but who is the dog?” she asked. “Who are the others?”
Harry watched the redhead leave with a sigh, not understanding how he and his friends had grown so far apart in such a short time.
“And I can’t promise you that I’ll spontaneously change my whole personality…” Lucius went on as Harry swiped away his tears. “But if you can forgive me for everything that has happened since then perhaps Narcissa...and I...can try to be there for you as well as our son.”
Draco lowered his gaze to the floor even as he obeyed Harry’s demand.
Was he joking? Harry wondered to himself.  "Are you mad? You're the danger to me!"
"I see." Mcgonagall nodded. "That's fine."
“Oh, Harry…” Draco skimmed the article. “You’re not a failure.” It described Harry in hideous terms, speculating that he’d driven away his wife and taken their children as well as the house and most of the assets. It all but accused him of being a controlling and abusive spouse.
At some point after Draco found the desired position, Harry had gotten up and gone to take a shower.
Harry nodded. “Half nine it is. I’m looking forward to it.” He cut the connection and bit his lip in anticipation as he made his way up the stairs to his bedroom for a good night’s sleep.
"Never know until I answer..." Harry took a deep breath and reached for the phone after it rang a second time. "Hello?"
“I don’t think we’ll get much cleaning done in the shower unless we do it separately.” Draco said, staring into Harry’s green eyes.
"Not sure." Draco shrugged coyly. "The name was Giardini Pensili, but it was described as Mediterranean cuisine so I'm hopeful that there's at least a couple of Italian dishes. I've sent a letter asking for a full menu."
“You can call us Harry and Draco, Marcus,” Draco smirked.
Draco moaned at the overwhelming feeling of Harry’s presence above him. “Harry Potter! Master, please! I’m yours!”
him you’re raising the setting.”
"If it's lost how does anyone know that's where she is?" Sirius interrupted. "How would we communicate with her? Would she come here to teach them? If she did, would she be able to get back?"
"The sheer amount of rules you and your friends have broken-" Snape tried to argue.
“I’d like to tell you to arrest the bastard...but that’s Draco’s job.” Harry looked down at the distraught blond trying to communicate his desperation. “Please report him, Draco? If only for the baby’s sake...”
"We've conducted an extensive background check before deciding to allow this title to be conferred, Lord Potter." She spoke calmly. "We spoke with your aunts and uncle, their neighbors on Privet drive, former and current teachers."
"No!" Harry protested. "He thought that too! I just want us to have the opportunity to get to know each other without Dumbledore's interference. He's going to figure me out soon and the rivalry between our houses cannot stand in the face of our relationship, but he won't like that."
"Would you like any color in particular for your trunks?" Garnett asked. "Hogwarts house colors are a popular trend."
Harry knew his fiancé hadn’t been embarrassed until their audience contained his father but he couldn’t back down from the challenge Lucius just threw down. He glared at the older man. “Of course not, Mr. Malfoy; I merely forgot myself. We were about to look for wedding bands, if you’d like to join us.”
Draco considered this silently. "I propose that we table this discussion and speak with my father."
"On second thought," Harry's left eyebrow rose involuntarily. "I think my floo-call may interest you, Draco."
"Ok." Harry threw the unnecessary scraps into the fire and faced the cousin he'd grown up with. "I'm ready too. I'll write..."
At King's Cross it didn't take long to find his uncle and he vowed to stay silent until they reached the house.
The door opened as the girl in the portrait smiled at him. "Welcome, heir."
Her eyebrows rose. “You mean someone out there knows there’s a difference?”
The young blond shook his head. “It was probably nothing.”
“Yes, that’s true…I didn’t hide any of my emotions – positive or negative.” Draco frowned and turned his face toward Harry. “I felt very vulnerable but with you beside me…I knew it was alright to be so open.”
Harry sighed and hurried up to see the twins. He peeked into each bassinet and when he saw that his son was awake, he picked the baby boy up into his arms. “Good morning, my sweet boy. Would you like to see the world outside?” He asked as he opened the doors onto the large balcony and stepped out. Harry took a deep breath and sat on the ornate bench that Lucius had insisted was necessary for the space. He looked down into the yard and saw Selene lying under the shade of a tree.
Upon opening their gifts from Harry, everyone looked at him for an explanation.
Harry took note of Sirius' attitude and decided to take him up on the offer. When the dream had come up at first, he'd glossed over it without giving any details. The second time it happened, he'd told his godfather about the general feeling of concern for the school. Harry knew that this time he would need to show his faith in his godfather's commitment.
Harry's eyes sparkled with his happiness. "Ok, anything else?"
“So you’d rather play third wheel than be home tinkering?” Harry joked. “Alright, if you insist. I’ll stay here for the rest of my fitting, if Arthur agrees to stay.”
"C'mon...dance with me?" Draco asked as he stepped back into the crowded dance floor.
Harry took it and looked inside to find nundu spikes. He tied the sack closed and pulled out his trunk. He made quick work of enlarging it and dumping the contents of his rucksack into it before placing the sack in the pocket of the rucksack. Then he held it open for the snake to enter easily. She was silent as she settled in.
“The wizengamut may like that idea but their way gives them a large number of guaranteed births while yours only offers variables.” Draco told her gently. “Their way is to say ‘have a baby or be charged with noncompliance’ which carries a fine and up to two months incarceration at Azkaban. Your suggestion has no penalty for not stepping forward.”
“Where’s the apple sauce? Will someone please pass the apple sauce?” Draco called out looking up and down the table. “I…I need my apple sauce!”
Draco sighed and leaned into Harry. “I’ll see if I can work from home until the trial. I suddenly don’t feel safe leaving you or Grimmauld.”
Seamus and Neville sent notes round to tell everyone when they’d scheduled the surgery and, although they were planning for the next week, Seamus went into labor on August third. Tavin Jude Finnin Stanley Longbottom was born non-surgically on the morning of the fourth.
Harry smirked and continued to eat. Their names had been the first word’s he’d taught them properly that day because they’d been using ‘w’ sounds to butcher them.
Harry looked off into the distance in the direction taken by the snitch. While looking for the tiny gold ball, he decided on the tactic he’d use to achieve his goal. Based on what Viktor had done in the first game, it seemed to Harry that the older man was watching Harry instead of really looking for the snitch. The best way to take advantage of that was to use too much speed or the wrong angle when he went to chase it.
“Dispute it!” Harry whispered. “Re-write your letter and tell them you’re engaged and you’re already complying. Go in and ask her! She loves you, Marcus! It’ll be the truth!”
“Potter?” Blaise called softly. “I think you need to see this.”
Draco's heart started to fall but then she nodded and made her way over to the window. He thanked her as she placed the yellow diamond and pearl pendant in a box and gave her the money for it. As he stepped outside, he was met with a welcome sight.
“Hogwarts is being well - to my knowledge, Master Harry.” Roody told him calmly. “Is Master Harry being well?”
Harry frowned in the hat's direction and knew something was wrong but couldn't pin down the feeling as he became distracted by an unfamiliar face at the faculty table.
“At home,” Harry said, more aggressively than he had hoped, “What’s going on?”
Malfoy met his gaze and then suddenly looked down, “And I shouldn't have agreed,” he murmured. He began to align his papers back into his binder, “I'm taking you off the case,” he said bitterly.
“Draco…” he started again, but he was cut off as Draco leaned in.
“Well, after a childhood of Celestina Warbeck, it was only a matter of time before I converted to muggle music,” Malfoy shuddered as he looked up at Harry, “I mean, you can only listen to ‘A Cauldron Full Of Hot, Strong Love’ so many times before you lose all faith in humanity.”
“What position did you play?” Ginny asked excitedly.
Tonight was the night he planned to tell Ron and Hermione the truth. A week ago, he had told his kids, which had been perhaps the worst thing he had ever had to do. James had barely talked to either Ginny or Harry all week long, while Harry had found Al crying in his room multiple times. Lily was too little to understand any of what was going on, so she was the only one in the house blissfully unaware that the situation had changed drastically. As of right now, the five of them were planning on living in the same house for awhile as to not throw too much at the kids all at once. Ginny had talked to him; she planned to move in with Blaise after this period. Harry had been shocked at this. He hadn’t realized their relationship had reached that level while Harry and Ginny were still married. He didn’t quite know how to handle his wife falling in love with another man for months while they were married, even if he had been falling for Draco. That situation was completely different, anyhow. Blaise and Ginny were mutually in love. As for Harry, he liked Draco an unhealthy amount and Draco seemed to want nothing to do with him, although his kiss had said otherwise. But that wasn’t important tonight. Harry and Ginny were going over to the Weasley- Granger household with their kids to catch up and break the news to them. He was also planning on monitoring Hermione the entire night. He had been over multiple times in the past week to make sure she was remaining stable, but she had become upset with him when he had tried to stay with her for the entire day. She kept reminding him that Draco said she would be fine (he had even given her some of his research to prove it. Harry hated how sweet that was). Regardless, Harry wanted to see for himself that Hermione seemed unaffected, and an evening at their house was a perfect way to do that. It was also going to be an evening of emotional support, as Ron and Hermione planned to tell the family about the pregnancy at Sunday brunch while Ginny and Harry were planning on talking about their divorce the same day. Yes, Ron and Hermione didn’t know yet about the divorce (well, Hermione probably did), but Harry was banking on their responses being supportive.
“Harry?” Draco asked again, softer now. He was terrified to look into Draco’s eyes, afraid that he would see concern there, which is the last thing he needed.
“Then why are you so upset?” Harry asked softly.
“I meant they didn’t have any today. And I went up before you,” Harry remembered the only options being peach and cherry.
“No,” Harry whispered, “We are not talking about it. Not here. Not on Christmas Eve.”
“You better not break Harry’s heart,” Ron said.
Angelina rolled her eyes, “George, I’m going to say this once. Drink as much as you like, but I am not accountable for whatever happens at the store tomorrow when you are hungover and bloody exhausted.”
“Oh, no,” Draco whispered, “This can’t be happening…”
Harry looked away to feign embarrassment. Ida smiled, “Don’t worry, Harry. Your secret is safe with me. You take time to figure out what this new relationship with Seb is. Take time for yourself. You deserve to find what makes you happy.”
Malfoy snorted and replied, “You’re strange, Potter.” He leaned back in his chair as he turned sideways to look at Harry.
“Everything?” Harry seked, “What has he done?”
“Sure, but there are many ex-Slytherins working at the Ministry who I trust wholeheartedly!” Savant countered.
Harry didn’t even try to conceal his shock. He turned to Scorpius and asked, “Your dad has a phone? A muggle phone?”
But Harry wasn’t able to finish his sentence. Just then, a voice rang out frantically from the other room.
Aviary leaned back against the bar, beer grasped in her hand and eyes slightly unfocused, “Harry, sweet Harry,” she began to gesture at the pub-goers in front of her, “If I were to shag one of these fine fellows in this very pub, who shall it be?”
The others followed him into the apartment and looked for seats. When Harry realized that he and two others had no place to sit, he smiled. "Dobby, please find another sofa?"
Harry stepped into the shower just behind Draco. “What if I wasn’t done with you?”
Awkward silence reigned for a moment until Draco couldn't bear it any longer. He sighed and broached the topic of the conversation theyd had while Harry was drunk. “Harry, last week... I don’t know if you remember the conversation we had...”
“I like that he has emerald eyes like you...” Draco told him softly.
Harry and Draco shared a compartment with Blaise, Luna and Pansy. Pansy was joining the Malfoy party while Blaise’s mother would be meeting her son and his wife at the station. The group had visits from all of their friends during the trip to wish each other a merry Christmas and happy new year while discussing names for the babies that would soon be joining the world. Pansy had decided to name her son Ambrose Benedict Parkinson while the Zabini heir would be named Lawrence Raymond.
Harry stared as he made sense of the whole thing. "Draco..." He had a soft expression as he deliberately reached over and took hold of Draco's hand. "I think that possibly...maybe I might be falling for you."
The door opened with a turn of the knob as it was spelled to do for only a few specific people. “Nana? Are you in?”
Draco blushed and stood up to suggest that they follow the planned schedule only to sit back down when he saw Professor Sprout move toward the podium with a letter in her hand.
Draco met his gaze and nodded once.
Harry smiled as he watched. He liked this feeling. He could tell Draco to do these things to anyone and he’d willingly do it. He almost wished he could bring the blond to Ron’s house and have Draco sexually make up for all the things he’d done to the redhead and his wife…but they’d never understand. They’d think he was off his rocker for liking the power he held over Draco. Ginny had sworn never to tell his best mates about his kinks but the relationship had gotten strained anyway. Shaking his head, he pulled his thoughts back to the current event. “Move down further, Draco. I want her moaning and whimpering in pleasure.”
Lucius was almost snarling. “How is it our fault that you fell prey to this cretin?”
/*/*/*/*/*
"It wasn't him, Dad! Get off him!" Dudley insisted and pulled Harry's arm away from his father.
Pansy sighed. “Wow...I just saw the unrelenting good-goody who helped put my father in Azkaban.”
"Oh, no, Miss! Masters are being very good to Dinki!" The small creature defended Harry and Draco. "Dinki is never being mistreated and is even having a whole day to herself each month!"
Draco knew that meant he’d be allowed to get dressed for the first time in over a week. He crawled after Harry and waited quietly for his Master to choose his clothes. When Harry handed the pile of clothing to Draco he quickly and silently got dressed.
"Draco."
“Thanks, Ron...” Draco’s eyes went back to Harry’s face. “Harry and I will go there directly.”
The morning had gone almost exactly as Severus said it would. During breakfast, Professor Mcgonagall announced that the arithmancy professor was ill and so her classes were canceled for the day.
"What's that, Professor?" Harry asked innocently, having anticipated the possibility of such a topic. "The lost sun? I was thinking it referred to the darkness coming. You know like they call Voldemort the Dark Lord?"
McGonagall opened the door and allowed his friends to enter.
Harry nodded thoughtfully.
"My gorgeous wild Dragon..." Harry grinned as he opened his mouth and placed his lips on the skin between Draco's neck and shoulder. He began to suck and lick and worry that spot until there was a dark bruise there.
Harry and Draco babysat Angelica for most of the first week of Hugo's life and the twins didn’t seem to mind sharing their parents but the elder Weasleys also wanted some of her time. They took over the following week but visited with Ron and Hermione easily since they lived in the same house.  Luckily for the youngest Weasley couple, they had many helpers.
Resentfully, Draco sneered. “Right, because you’re the ‘Boy Who Lived’ and the ‘Savior of the Wizarding World’.”
“It wasn’t only for your benefit.” Draco whispered trying to suppress a blush.
"I'll give an interview or press statement to that effect." He volunteered. "I can make it sound like it was your idea all along. 'The ministry proposes to make October a month of weddings', I'll say. 'The nuptial extravaganza will begin on the first of the month and culminate in the Halloween Wedding of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy'. I can tell the reporters how terrible most of my Halloweens were and how I hope to change that by marrying a man who has always fascinated me on that day. I'll also tell them how I'm a horrible romantic and how much Draco loves Halloween. I'll even make personal appearances at all the weddings that take place here at Hogwarts."
The group waited as Tukron read the prophecy and then the scrolls. He had a livid expression as he began issuing commands in the goblin tongue.
“I hope not.” Nana frowned. “You say Harry initiated the kiss? I didn’t even know he was bent.”
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
The usually shaven face had stubble. The brunet's already messy hair was worse than usual and the green eyes he liked to get lost in were bloodshot.
Ron rushed up knocking into the young lord. “Oh, sorry, Harry!”
“Didn’t I just say to call me Marcus?” He asked before turning to his son. “What do you think, Tanis? Would you like to have three new babysitters?”
Ginny made a face at him and asked Ziva to bring their plates to their room before pulling Luna away by the hand.
"No, and he used the opportunity to try and potion me." Lucius informed the young lord. “I was lucky. Merlin’s blood transmutation filters toxins in fairly short order.”
Harry grinned at his friend as he sat down with Hermione. His three favorite people were all with him now and he couldn’t contain his joy as Draco and Hermione began discussing cravings and mood swings. He kissed Draco’s cheek and went back to eating.
Korlag just laughed it off. "No matter!  I have a copy here. You asked about the elves, if I recall."
She smiled up at Harry. “Of course, Harry. I’ll get to hold her again later and I’ve got my own two on the way, so I’m not worried.”
“Did Rax tell you all that Draco has reached level seven of his Potions Mastery?” Harry’s eyes sparked with pride as he asked. “Did he tell you that I’ve completed the animagus transformation?”
“You’ve experienced things…You’ve seen and done things, and gone places that I’ve only ever dreamed about. You know more about magic and the wizarding world than I can ever learn.” There was a plea for comprehension in his eyes as Harry gazed at the blond man. “Between the two of us, your parents, our friends and their parents – our children would be book-smart, street-smart, beautiful, fun-loving, magically powerful…and exceptional fliers to boot. I just want love and a family…Things I didn’t really have as a child.” He whispered the last few words a bit hoarsely. “Can you understand that? Can you be that for me?”
Harry swallowed. If there was one thing he wasn't prepared for, it was a discussion  about marriage. He had feelings for Draco; that was certain, but marriage was something he'd need to really think about. "Wow. I don't really know what to say."
Draco stepped outside in his bathrobe and smiled at his father. “I never knew any of that…Which great uncle was it, Father?”
"And you just decided you're gay?" Draco asked.
"Mother, Sirius, or I should read it so the information isn't colored by any lies Dumbledore might have told." Draco offered.
“Don’t open it yet. Let me explain. You see, Harry, there are a number of traditions that go along with being a pureblood.” Draco spoke softly. “This is one I think you’ll be able to, not only accept, but enjoy.”
"You do?" Draco's breathless tone must've given Harry the jolt of courage he needed because he stood suddenly.

Dudley looked up into the sky as well and started to get scared. "What are you doing, freak?"
“The broom is mine. I didn’t shrink it for storage yet.” Draco confessed quietly.
Harry complied and smiled as he figured out what Bill had suspected. “The parselmagic in the scepter lets someone communicate with snakes if they weren’t born with the ability! That’s brilliant!” Harry gestured for Bill to inspect the contents of the chest.
“It’s very important that you know this, Ted.” Harry held out his arms and waited as Teddy climbed into them. He hugged the little boy tightly and whispered into his ear. “I love you, Teddy. I love you and I loved your daddy and mummy, too. I miss them and I’ll miss your grandmother, too, but I still have you…and I promise that I’ll take very good care of you.”
Harry nodded and thought hard. “Never have I…sat around like this for the express purpose of getting drunk.”
“What’s wrong?” He asked as he came closer. “What happened?”
Draco agreed quietly with a sigh. "But the walk is half the fun of going to town. I love seeing the trees and watching the birds fly."
"But what they're really offering is a place of permanence when you've never had one before. This room will be yours whether you – we – use it or not." The blond could tell that Harry was rethinking what was being said.
“But this was real – not just a dream, Narcissa. I think these owls were the embodiment of Andy and Ted’s animagus forms.” Harry looked down at his husband sadly. “I think Ted came back to get Andy so they could be together one last time.”
"What about my uncles?" Harry asked.
"They're also smart enough to make their joke products and they're ambitiously chasing their dreams of opening a shop." Harry pointed out. "Ginny has friends in all houses but she also has a competitive spirit and dreams of quidditch stardom.”
Ziva was distraught. "Master Harry not like Ziva's plans?"
Arthur nodded thoughtfully, looking at the baby boy. “Good of you to understand that, Harry, though that is the more dangerous of the ways for men to give birth.”
Harry’s eyes widened at her diagnosis. “Heat exhaustion?”
"I can only project a bright silver misty shield, so far...But I had a dream last night and I think I'll do better next lesson." Draco grinned at her.
Harry shook his head. “We would’ve told you anyway. He’s your son as much as he’s my husband.”
"How would your godfather know that?" Harry asked in confusion.
“Yes, he is; isn’t he? Check this out.” Harry grinned and turned to the baby. “Teddy…come to Uncle Harry for a minute.”
As they ate the moussaka, which seemed to be made with potatoes, ground meat, and tomatoes but topped with a white sauce and baked, Harry also noticed a few bay leaves and a dollop of yoghurt on top. He dipped a bit of the roll into the mixture and saw almost all the others doing the same…but not Draco. The blond hadn’t touched his roll for the rest of the night, nor did he accept the offer of afters. Harry didn’t eat much of the meal and only a little dessert because that bad feeling in his gut had festered. He felt sick that anyone could mistreat Draco this way.
Harry chuckled with a shake of his head. "Of course he is."
“I see.” Narcissa nodded in understanding when she heard Harry emphasize the word ‘safer’. She knew now that he meant Andromeda would feel safe in the presence of Lucius if Harry was here. “I’ll send her a note after the meal, then.”
Zack nodded in a stunned daze.
The owl was sent and returned quickly with the reply that the Weasley parents had planned to go shopping for the crib that very afternoon and as such it was a task they would happily leave to Harry.
“Yes.” Draco nodded slightly. “Pansy helped me dress for dinner, Hermione and Ron just came through and now here you are. Anyway, they’re in the parlor.”
"I'll see to it during my free hour, love, and I'll meet you at the apartment after your last class." Harry kissed Draco's hand and waved as he hurried off to find the Headmistress.
He had agreed to a betrothal with Harry Potter who was not just The Boy Who Lived, but an elemental wizard whose powers were just emerging from the cocoon Dumbledore had forced them into. Harry needed his help to heal whatever damage the old fool had caused to Hogwarts. He was also an earl and had political power he likely didn't know what to do with, so he would need Draco to guide him.
Harry agreed and looked to Ron who told him to go ahead without him because the Weasley’s owl had just arrived.
"Yes. We spoke briefly on your birthday. I'd thought it was odd to have a former teacher attending such an event and asked him about it." Zack explained.
He heard someone following him and wasn't surprised when all three men joined him.
"I'll bet." Draco said with a smirk. "Have you thought about my offer, Potter? I made it in good faith..."
Harry smirked. "Is that all? I thought it was something serious."
Harry nodded. "I just need to greet him."
The tension got high at times and sometimes it seemed like they were just waiting for Death to come take Andromeda. The healer had visited and informed the family that she wasn't improving and seemed to be in a sort of limbo state. She offered more specialized healers that functioned liked muggle physical and occupational therapists. Harry and Narcissa agreed to meet with these specialists at their convenience.
“I don’t know their specific identities, do I?” The man glared at him, pointing the wand. “They all wore masks and I couldn’t see their faces as they took her! We got away from the Ministry that day but when we got home, there were men in black robes with masks. They took her just because her parents were Muggles! We have children and she was pregnant, but that didn’t stop them from taking her and hurting her!”
Harry smiled as Draco pulled free only to run into their bedroom. By the time they reached the bed, both men were nude and hard as hell. Draco was breathing heavy when Harry caught up to him.
“Yes…he could.” Harry focused on her intently, even as he walked over to pick the baby up and place a bib around his neck. “I think of him that way, you know…as my son.”
The twins were wide-eyed and his son looked a little frightened but, when he held his arms out to the little boy, Harry was not denied.
Draco fell into silence but not for long. “When we’re in company, your arms and the way you hold me makes me feel so safe. Your eyes and the way you look at me, that’s what makes me feel like I’m the only other person in your world. I feel so loved.” Harry started to speak but Draco gently placed his hand over Harry’s lips. “I’m not finished…”
"Dagger?" Pansy gasped and looked at Blaise. “Dobby?”
Draco glared at the other boy. “Yes.”
“I’d love to be a stay-at-home dad! Anyway, I’ll be your partner in the apothecary when you finish your training as well as reinvesting in George’s company,” Harry commented. “I’ll have to get a business license and that means a correspondence class from one of the magical universities as well as one from the ministry.”
The blond walked over to his son’s crib and smiled tremulously down at the tiny figure before glancing over at his daughter. He’d failed them that day and he knew it. Draco decided right then and there that he’d never do anything to endanger himself or his children.
Defense Against the Dark Arts was the first class, so after breakfast, Draco and his friends hurried to get there on time. He and Harry didn't bother with a pretense, instead, sitting together at Draco's usual table.
Harry thought for a moment. “We could order in? I’ll send a floo order for pizza or something?”
Harry quickly moved forward with his other question since it hadn't been answered. "Are their names Milly, Maddy, Corky and..."
“Mr. Malfoy…” Harry paused and then changed tactics because a gut feeling told him to approach the older man as more of an equal. “Lucius, please try to understand...you have a choice. You can accept this and try to find the things in me that you can tolerate or you can alienate your son even further and tear your family apart. Voldemort is dead and gone; that ship has sailed.”
Sirius was inside and immediately pulled Harry into a hug. "Gods, pup. Moony told me everything." He kissed his godson's head.
“Dad! No, I haven’t dated anyone since Keith!” Harry suppressed a chuckle because he could picture the glare Draco was giving his father.
“Books for potions! Harry, thank you!” Draco said after opening three separate books, one after another.
Draco had dreamed of finding a man he could trust with his vulnerable side. Harry loved Draco and was fairly adventurous in bed. He'd even dabbled in bondage and domination. He knew that there were depths he wouldn't feel comfortable with but he was determined that they'd test the waters tonight and talk the whole thing through tomorrow.
He looked at the castle again, closer this time, because from what he could recall of the previous version of this dream, that was more important than the surrounding area. The rubble was disturbingly colorful. He picked up a stone fragment and noticed that it was blue inside with a thin layer of grey on the outside. The next piece of stone he picked up was red and the next was a portion of two stones; one was yellow and the other was green. He dropped the fragments of stone and turned away from the horrific sight.
Harry laughed, “Nonsense; his favorite color sparks have always been gold.”
The older brunet smirked and bowed slightly. “Cousin.”
“He’s an elemental wizard.” Tom deadpanned from the doorway.
“We’ll sit next to Daddy, ok?” He asked the three year old as he sat down within reach of his husband who reached out to hold the baby’s hand. “Lyra, you and Caelum now have a little sister. Do you remember a little while ago we told you she was coming?”
Selene, who had been sleeping in the corner of the living room, jumped up and growled.
Draco bit his lip and shook his head with a mysterious smirk. “I don’t think I’m ready to share yet.”
"Do you know what it does?" She asked and was answered by a silent nod from Harry. "I would be remiss in my duties as deputy head of the school if I didn't ask...will it interfere with Hogwarts' wards?"
Harry was outraged. "Is that why the ministry dictates limited contact with the Headmaster of Hogwarts?"
“Stroke yourself, Dragon,” He whispered moving smoothly in and out while letting his teeth scrape the spot on Draco’s neck.
“You’ve already got a way with him, Harry.” Andy said as she sat. “Dora and Remus knew what they were doing when they chose you as Teddy’s godfather.”
"Yeah." Piers sneered.
A gasp was heard from the hallway. Pansy stood with a hand to her mouth but they could see that her lower lip was trembling while tears gathered in her eyes. “I didn’t get a chance to tell you…” She said as she turned to go back to her bedroom.
“Hello, my darling.” She answered gently. “Are you at the flat?”
"Yes, darling." Narcissa nodded once. "Your instincts told you that Harry's friend was competition, so you felt jealousy. Now you've thought about it and you realize that they're only friends and much more like family than romantic competition. So you don't feel like that anymore."
“Yes, yes, I’ve heard all of that,” James said, “What I really need to hear is why you would accuse her new boyfriend of killing a bunch of people if you aren’t upset with her.”
He pushed away from her, “How can you hug me? I just admitted I’ve been unfaithful to my wife, your best friend, Ron’s sister!”
“No,” Scorpius responded, once again excited, “She works as an expert on magical creatures! The first floor, as you probably know, is for patients that have been hurt by magical creatures. She works with healers to help cure patients with injuries from the most random animals I have ever heard of. And I know plenty,” Scorpius continued, “My mom got me my first book on magical creatures when I was only four years old!”
Harry nodded and didn’t speak for a second. When he did, his voice gave a strange crack, “Is it safe for you to keep investigating?”
Harry was busy counting the number of postcards from Cambodia (he had always wanted to go there), when a loud “fucking shit!” tore his eyes away from the walls and drew them to Draco. He had walked into the room, dressed in a soft white t-shirt and, no joke, fucking sweatpants. His hair was wet from what Harry guessed had been a shower, and it hung in strings across his face. Harry realized Draco was most likely looking for an explanation, so he said simply, “I was wondering if I could come through?”
“I think I understand how you feel,” Seamus said softly , “If I remember correctly, you were there for me time and time again when I first came out and decided I wanted a relationship with Dean. You were an extraordinary friend to me then, and still are every single damn day, and the least I can do is make you feel a little better as you sit at this crossroads.”
“First of all,” Draco held out his wand. Harry watched as he began pointing it around the room, getting rid of the grime that covered every surface until the room shone.
"So..." Harry mused, swallowing his chocolate. "It seems that we share a cousin."
"That would be perfect. Please make that modification to the six compartment trunk." Harry said casually.
“What is your Patronus, Draco?” Andy asked quietly.
“There’s something I need you to understand if you’re going to be with me… I’m a very public figure. I can’t tell the world that I married you just because I like you and want to get to know you better.” He sighed. “That may be a large part of the truth but I have to have other reasons for doing things than: ‘I just wanted to’.”
"That sounds amazing, Harry." Draco congratulated himself on the smooth way he spoke Harry's given name instead of his last name. "It should be fun and interesting, but...  you know, with music there will probably be dancing."
Korlag looked troubled. “Lord Potter, have you tried to practice with wandless magic?”
“I died to save everyone including you.” Harry pursed his lips and watched Draco stroll around the room considering this.
Ernie seemed sincere so Harry decided to drop one more warning. He smirked as they heard the apartment door open. “Luna has quite a few new friends in addition to her three cousins... Did you know?”
“The meeting is Friday. If it really is that urgent ...Very well, I’ll be there shortly.” Lucius replied as an elf brought his clothes. The floo connection shut and, seven minutes later, a fully dressed Lucius Malfoy came through. “Now, what is it you’ve found?”
Harry almost wanted to remain in his owl form to watch this little encounter but he decided to circumvent Draco’s temper. “Thank you, Lucius…but as he’s always telling me – pregnant isn’t injured and they are our children.” He turned to his husband and let one eyebrow lift. “No smug looks from you, Dragon. I said you could hold them and even lift them if you sat soon after. The healer’s opinion agreed with mine…and your own body’s. ‘Getting more rest’ isn’t an order for ‘bed-rest’ but it could very well evolve into just that.”
“Excuse me sir, but it sounds as if you’re blaming
While the Director was speaking to Sirius, Olgok was busy mixing a new potion. As he brewed it, he spoke. "The potions that are influencing you are dangerous because they're blocking your natural tendencies. Your body should've absorbed more of the nutrients in your food over the years. Your mind should've been able to absorb more knowledge. With so many powerful witches and wizards in your family your innate knowledge of magic should be more developed than it is - even considering the disconnection and being raised by squibs."
