Harry was silent for a few moments before declaring, "Draco's pregnant and the baby's mine." There multiple gasps, but Hermione spoke first, "Come on lets get you to the common room and we'll talk more up there without every one listening in." Ron looked like he wanted to argue but he followed seeing Hermione's glare.
"How are you feeling, Mr. Malfoy? Have you made your decision?" Madam Pomfrey asked him.
"Why didn't he tell me earlier?" Harry asked quietly, finally deflating.
"I have no idea. I'm not even 2 months pregnant yet, Pans." Draco told her with a small chuckle.
"What do you need, Malfoy?" Harry questioned. This is the first time they talked in months. After they had sex, Harry tried to talk to him, but every time Draco had Gregory send him away.
"Adhara Cassia Potter, that's what I want to name her." Draco told him.
"I found out he was pregnant about a month ago. He didn't tell anyone except his friends so I found out on accident. I only realized you were the father a few days ago and I confronted him. I gave him a few days to tell you, because it was only fair." Hermione explained calmly despite Harry's anger.
"I'm a parseltongue. I guess the door figured only Slytherins could speak to snakes so it let me in. I really need to apologize to Draco." Harry told her.
Hermione sighed before grabbing her bag and grabbing a picture. "Here's the sonogram. Go after him Harry, before it's too late." Harry grabbed the photo looking down at him beautiful daughter before starting to run to the Slytherin common room.
"Well why don't I tell you in private." Madam Pomfrey eyed the four Slytherins surrounding him.
Pansy turned out to be correct. When Draco finally worked up the courage to tell her when they arrived at Malfoy Manor she immediately pulled him into a hug. He cried on her shoulder for an hour before he told her everything. He didn't mention the father, but he didn't have to. "It's Harry Potter isn't it? He's the father." It barely sounded like a question because she knew her son so well. When he shakily nodded she pulled him into another hug.
McGonagall nodded a sad smile on her face, "They often are."
"I win!" Blaise said, giving Theo a hive five. Draco laughed and his comment about Lily left forgotten.
"It was the small thing really. I saw you watching him in class. You would switch between these looks of longing to hatred depending on your mood. And Pansy said the father's mother's name was a flower. I've also known you've been in love with him since at least 6th year. I didn't tell anyone at first because I thought maybe it was just a small crush but you didn't stop and I realized a lot of past instances made a lot more sense if you like Harry." Draco looked down, but Hermione bulldozed through, "I understand why you don't want to tell him. You're scared, but I think Harry's going to react better than you think. He's always wanted a family and he likes you more than you think. Just think about it, please. I don't want to keep lying to my best friends, and even if he doesn't want the baby (which is very slim) I'll still be there for you and so will all your other friends." Before Draco could say anything else she was gone and Draco continued to the common room.
"She already figured it out, plus now she can talk baby names with me since you've been ignoring me." Pansy told him before once again turning back to Hermione, "So he's 4 months along and it's a girl. He wants the first name after a star because technically he's a Black. He's also thinking the middle name after a flower because both his mother and the father's mother are named after flowers." Pansy explained.
Draco couldn't mask his emotions anymore, and Harry pushed on, "I tried to talk to you, but you ignored me. I was angry, really angry. At you... at myself. I was so angry that I let myself fall for you. So, eventually I tried to forget about it. I held onto my anger towards you as an excuse. I didn't push you when you with drew even more, not just from me, from everyone. Not when you only hung out with your 4 friends. Not when you started missing some lessons. Not when I saw you going to see Madame Pomfrey. And I'm so sorry. I wish I could see how idiotic I was being. I wish I could have been there for you. I will never forgive myself for that, I just hope you will give me a chance to be there for you and this child now."
"Why should we let you?" Goyle questioned with a glare.
When they finally got to the Slytherin common room, they went to the boys dormitory knowing no one would be up there. Draco sat on his bed and Pansy reluctantly let go of him before saying, "You have to tell them Draco."
"So, who'd you shag?" Blaise asked with a smirk on his face.
Hermione took a deep breath before telling him, "I know Harry's the father."
"They are, but I'm not planning on telling them." He looked away before continuing, "He's just... he's an idiot."
"You're the only one I've had sex with in over a year. Not many people are lining up to have sex with a death eater. Not everyone is the savior. I don't really care if you believe me or not, but this is your child. So put on your big boy pants and decide weather or not you want to be in this childs life. This isn't something you can just say your going to do and then don't. This is a life so if your in your in for life and if you don't want to raise her, I don't want you trying to be in her life later. Decide." With that Draco turned around and stormed off going to find his friends. When he did meet up with his friends they called the house elves for ice cream and skipped class.
Harry sighed before saying, "It was at the beginning of the school year. I had realized that I had a crush on Draco, so I went to tell him how I felt. Except, I couldn't really figure out what to say so I snogged him. When he didn't push me away and hex me I figured he liked me to. Things... escalated. When I woke up later he was gone and he ignored me in the halls until eventually I gave up."
"Who is the father?" Hermione questioned.
The common room was in complete pandemonium when she got there. There were multiple Slytherins yelling, and right at the center was Harry Potter. "How did you get in here, you don't have the password?" Pansy questioned, the younger Slytherins shut up curious.
"I was just looking for the potions book. There's no more copies and I need it to complete my homework."
"I'm pregnant and since your the father I thought I should tell you." Draco put on a brave bravado he wore all his life, but he was cracking on the inside.
"I'm sorry, your what? How do you even know I'm the father?" Harry questioned.
"I should say sorry too. I should have told you sooner and I shouldn't have left. I was scared though of how you would react and I didn't wan to be any more heartbroken." Draco told him, still turned around. Harry slowly walked towards him, before placing a tentative hand on his shoulder. It seemed to open something in Draco, because he immediately launched himself at Harry in a tight hug.
As they stepped outside they were immediately bombarded by questions, but Draco still didn't look up. "He's fine. I'll explain more in private." Informed Pansy starting to tug Draco again. His friends looked at him in concern but listened to Pansy. Goyle cracked his knuckles whenever someone started staring at Draco and Theo had a glare almost as good as McGonagall's.
"Don't worry. If you choose to keep this child you will have a good support system the whole way. I'll give you some potions for the morning sickness and some pamphlets about male pregnancy. Of course male pregnancy is rare, but not unheard of. I expect you back in a week for a checkup and your decision." Madam Pomfrey told him. Pansy nodded and grabbed Draco's hand softly pulling him with her out of the hospital wing. He was still in shock and barely registered that he was leaving the pamphlets in his hands.
"No." Draco responded with conviction. His Mother has been through enough with his Father being in Azkaban and both Draco and her only barely escaping.
"Yes! I have been dying to tell someone." Pansy exclaimed grabbing Hermione and pushing her into a seat.
"You KNEW?" Harry asked outraged.
It was a month after Christmas break before someone else found out he was pregnant. Now about 4 months pregnant Draco spent a lot of his time preparing for the baby. That's why it was no surprise finding the Slytherin's in the library. Draco was reading a book about newborn babies, Theo was reading a large book about theoretic charms, Gregory was trying to do his transfiguration homework, Blaise was sleeping, and Pansy was trying to come up with baby names.
When Hermione Granger came up to their table, Gregory began to get up ready to scare her off. "Get down Gregory." Draco reprimanded. Goyle let out a huff and sat down so quickly it woke Blaise up. Pansy seemed to be interested on what she was doing here and Theo was practically dead to the world. As she stood right in front of them her eyes flicked to the book in Draco's hand. Draco quickly pulled the book under the table and cleared his throat already asking a question, "What can we do for you, Granger?"
Draco immediately recoiled, a look of shock on his face. He was about to run when Hermione grabbed his wrist, stopping him in his tracks. "How?" Draco chocked out.
Madam Pomfrey's eyes widened as she read the results and soon said, "Why don't we fetch your Mother so she can be here with you." Draco was taken back, why would they ask for his mother?
"Think about it, Harry. You kissed him right after the whole school found out you and Ginny broke up. Then you kiss him and shag him without talking about it. He resigned himself to being a one night stand with you, even after knowing what it would do to him emotionally, and then ignored you as to not be more humiliated and heartbroken. Think about what he's going through right now. Not only does half the school hate him, his father is in Azkaban. Plus, he has no idea what he is going to do after school, because no one will hire a known death eater. He's scared, he doesn't feel ready to raise a child or financially stable enough. The ministry took a lot of the Malfoy fortune. He probably also feels like he doesn't deserve this miracle in his life because he blames himself for what Voldermort did." Harry paled at Hermione's words.
"You really are sorry; you just cursed out a Muggle God."
He held out his hand for the second time in just as many hours. This time, Draco didn't hesitate in taking it.
"Harry," he corrected. "Call me Harry. I'm sick of the formalities."
Draco nudges his side with a teasing smile. "Could say the same about 'Harry Potter.'"
Harry snorts. "Thought she'd keep her mouth shut about us. I mean, who names their kid 'Mary Kelly?'"
," is all Harry says.
"Can't go anywhere without seeing your face, can I, Potter?" Draco sneers, but there's no heat behind it.
"Not even with the sleeping potion. Madame Pomfrey became so desperate, she even tried Muggle medication."
"Don't test your limits, there, Harry," Draco replied. He grunted as he slammed Harry back into the mattress. "Choose your words wisely. Can't have you giving out the wrong impression."
He tried to convince himself that that was the only reason for wanting to see Potter, but truth be told, they hadn't really spoken since the first day back at Hogwarts, and Draco's guilt was eating him alive. He wanted to properly apologise for the torment he'd put Potter and his friends through over the past seven years, show Potter that he was remorseful and had changed. Draco hoped that if he could cure Potter of his sleeping issues, maybe, just maybe, they could be acquaintances, or maybe even friends.
Harry's lips are on it immediately. Draco gasps, not expecting that, and watches with wonder in his eyes as Harry sucks and kisses at the mark. He pours love and soul and acceptance into it. There's no hesitation, no disgust, just pure love. He kisses the area around the Mark, then gently bites at it. Draco closes his eyes and tilts his head back, trying desperately to control his breathing.
"Yes, Draco, please!"
Draco didn't have any complaints.
Draco opened and closed his mouth a few times before he could find the right words to say. He looked back at the pictures, then turned back to Potter with blinking eyes. "You and the female Weasley...there aren't any pictures of you together."
"Thank Merlin, I am in no mood to get all mushy - wait! What I mean to say, is that I'm thankful for the pass for tonight and I promise to answer any questions you may have tomorrow."
Draco feels himself shake. He knows what's coming, and he could stop it. He could refuse, say no, put a stop it this before it can get out of hand. But he trusts Harry, as Harry had entrusted him, and Draco lets Harry take hold of his left arm after he rolls up his shirt sleeve.
Draco was left on his back, panting and wondering what the hell had just happened. Was he dreaming? He must have been dreaming. It was the only plausible explanation for the mind fuckery he was currently experiencing.
Draco let out a relieved sigh. He looked down at the book he had been reading, contemplating picking it up again and trying to read it, but he abandoned the thought and the book in favour of thinking about Potter. There was no point in trying to read when his reading appetite had been squashed by the thought of Potter losing sleep.
"You've already given me a hickey."
"You're right," he said. "It's easy because we've complicated it enough. I'm sorry for everything, Harry, I hope you know that."
"Don't kill me for what I'm about to say, okay? I really care for Harry and I want my best friend back, but-"
He was losing sleep because of Draco. He was losing sleep because of all the people Draco had hurt and killed in the name of being a good Malfoy. Hours after the war had concluded, Draco had pondered over the idea of what would have happened if things had been different. What if he hadn't been stupid enough to let Death Eaters into the School; what if he hadn't been persuaded into taking the Dark Mark; what if he hadn't insulted Weasley during their first train ride to Hogwarts, and both he and Potter had become friends with him? Would things have turned out differently? Would they have even had a war?
"The Breakfast Club. It's a muggle film. Today is the day you lose your muggle film virginity."
Yet now, as he thinks about it, it makes sense that Harry remaining in the closet would become a (bigger) issue. Draco had wanted to protect him, keep him safe, but maybe what Harry needs is to break the mould he has been forced into. The Boy Who Lived may have been the Chosen One, but he is also human. He has needs and desires like anyone else. And nobody should ever deny him that, least of all Draco himself.
"Har har."
He sounds so desperate, so broken and so unlike the brave man Draco is used to, and it makes him completely break. He dives for Harry and pulls him in close, not caring if his coat or shirt or anything becomes soaked. He needs to let Harry know that he is safe and protected in Draco's arms. Clothes can be replaced. Harry Potter is irreplaceable.
Draco gave Potter a small smile. He wasn't sure what for, exactly, but it felt fitting. Potter looked confused for only a second before he was returning the smile - except, it was overtaken by a loud yawn that only seemed to make him look even more exhausted than before.
"Shall we snog at breakfast tomorrow to break it to her?"
His Dark Mark is the ugliest thing Draco has ever seen. He recoils as he looks at it, tries not to throw up there and then. He doesn't know how Harry can keep looking at it, especially with the meaning behind it. Suppose that's the Gryffindor in him. The bravery. The courage.
"Nobody's going to see that. Mine are on my neck. I'll have to wear a scarf tomorrow, I hope you know that."
“You love it.”
That didn't mean that Draco didn't feel rather pleased that he was the first one to get Harry to sleep. He found himself reaching down and running his hands through Harry's thick hair, admiring the way that he pressed up into Draco's hand even in the throws of a deep sleep. When he was sure he wasn't about to wake up, Draco reached down further and removed Harry's glasses from his face, placing them safely on the bedside table so they wouldn't get crushed. This only seemed to encourage Harry to snuggle further into Draco's chest. Draco had a feeling that Harry would bury himself in there if he could.
"That was weird," he said casually.
"Can you blame me?"
The first thing he needed to do was to get a good look at Potter himself. No doubt Granger and Weasley were sound people to determine Potter's state, but their opinions were nothing but hearsay to Draco's own conclusions. Draco was only going to be able to make a successful sleeping potion if he had a better idea of how Potter was coping.
"That's all? Rather dramatic if you ask me - ow! Okay, I'm sorry! Jesus Christ."
"Uh, Harry," Draco whispered. "What are you doing?"
So he nods, because he can't seem to get the words out that,
And with that, Draco goes back to attacking Harry's sweet spot.
Ideas began swimming through his head, so he abandoned his book on the table in front of him and raced upstairs into his room. Bless Professor McGonagall and her insisting on the Eighth Year's having their own rooms; Merlin knew Draco didn't want anybody prying into his work or interrupting him.
Draco thought he'd crossed the line as soon as the words slipped out of his mouth and winced in preparation to be hexed, only for Potter to reply with a quiet, shy-sounding laugh. The sound of bells continued to fill the room, making Draco smile. It had been such a long time since anybody had laughed so openly. It was nice to hear it again.
"Hermione?"
"Ow! You didn't have to slap me. Git. Go on, finish your story so I can tell mine."
"We don't have to talk about it tonight. We've already talked about so much. It's late."
"That would be really nice, actually. I'm absolutely famished." Potter laughed, a sweet sound that reminded Draco of the bells his mother used to hang up around the Manor during the Christmas holidays. "Shall we go down to the Great Hall or...?"
"Harry, wait," he says, and gently pries Harry away when he tries to kiss his neck. "Stop. Are you sure this is okay?"
"There's nothing to be sorry for."
Draco knows he's fucked up as soon as he says it. Potter is not how he refers to Harry - not when they're like this, tightly knitted together in their own bubble. Potter is what he calls him when he's bullying him, when he's teasing and taunting him to get a rise of him. They agreed that the only time Draco is to refer to Harry as Potter is when they first 'find' each other here at the cemetery. After that, it's only Harry and Draco for the rest of their time together.
Potter was shaking his head before Draco could even finish his sentence. "We broke up a while ago. Realised we were better off as friends. That, and she's too gay to function, and I couldn't keep my eyes off of you - I mean, I'm Bi. We love each other a lot, just not in the way we thought we did. We're still good friends."
"For fuck's sake, Draco -"
"Mary Kelly, hm?" He says to break the ice, referring to the headstone of the lady of whom they're resting on.
Weasley swallowed so hard his Adam's apple bobbed a few times in his throat. "There has to be something we can do, 'Mione. Something we're not trying."
"Draco!"
"Please!" He cries.
How the tables have turned, and how Draco loves it. He's whimpering and calling out Harry's name with a desperation for something he can't place. Harry just keeps going, sucking and biting and kissing and marking. Despite the dark colour, despite the nighttime darkness that envelops them, Draco can clearly see the bruises and love bites forming on and around the Mark. He can't help but to let out another gasp.
“I’m just making sure. Better your tie than your scarf. It’s bloody hot nowadays.”
"I'd be better if you gave me a kiss."
"More," Harry replies, quiet as a mouse. "Please."
Before they can get too comfortable, Draco shifts to unbutton his coat all the way so he can wrap it around Harry's shaking body. The shivers calm down just the slightest, now that the wind isn't nipping at him, but his body is still being wracked by sobs and harsh shaking. Draco shushes him to the best of his ability, running a hand up and down his back and gently carding through his hair like he knows Harry likes. It has its desired affect - Harry nuzzles his face into Draco's neck and wraps his arms tightly around him, so tight that anyone weaker would surely suffer.
"Of course."
"That was disgusting!" Potter said with a laugh, flinching away from Draco when he tried to flick a crumb his way.
"Let's go back?"
"Right," he said, clearing his throat. "Shall I get us some lunch?"
"Aha!" Harry declared in success. "Draco Malfoy, have you ever watched The Breakfast Club before?"
"As long as you sneak me into your bed."
"It's not you," Harry says between sobs. He's gasping for breath now and Draco so desperately wants to hold him, but he understands he needs space. He lets Harry have his space because it's the least he can do.
It was Harry's turn to choke on his spit. Draco tried not to laugh too loudly, but it was hard to when Harry looked so flustered. A thought crossed Draco's mind without much warning - Harry rather suited deep reds. No wonder he looked so good in his robes -
." His voice is full of awe. He can't hold back.
"I am sorry. Please tell me what else is making you upset."
enough away as to keep anyone who dares to tell them off for indecent behaviour on their toes. Tonight, Harry and Draco first, they sit in the corner of the library as they wait for Granger - er, Hermione, Ron, Pansy and Blaise to join them.
"The what now?" Draco replied.
"I thought I was sleeping in the bed."
A resigned silence fell over the two of them. Weasley looked like he wanted to argue but couldn't decide what to argue on. Draco felt rather much the same way.
"We should head back," Draco says gently. He quickly adds, "So we're more comfortable. And inside," before Harry can protest.
"If it means you stop slapping me. Salazar's tits."
It only seemed to get worse when he came to Hogwarts. People followed Harry around like lost puppies. That's half the reason why they set up a system for whenever they meet up. You never know who's around the corner. People were obsessed with Harry - or, more specifically, the idea of Harry Potter. Malfoy had fallen into that trap at one point, and eleven-year-old Draco had been humiliated when Harry didn't take his hand and become his friend. He'd never understand the full extent of the day-to-day pressures Harry faced, but he saw how it weighed on him; like now.
He knows this has gone from a zero-to-one hundred situation much too fast. Harry was crying not five minutes ago, but now he's crying out Draco's name in desperation, and Draco can't find himself to care. However, he does pull away, just for a second, to make sure Harry is okay.
He knew better than to presume that this was the cure for Harry's sleeping problems. It wasn't sustainable in the long run, and they'd only been friends for a few hours - official friends for half an hour if you wanted to get specific. Draco couldn't always stay in Harry's room, and no doubt Harry didn't always want him in here. Hell, it probably wasn't even Draco that had helped Harry fall asleep. If he wanted to think realistically, it was probably the safety of a warm body and physical contact that finally got him to sleep.
He got into his bed, pushing back the covers so Draco could climb in beside him. Draco felt his feet freeze to the floor. It was one thing to have lunch with Potter, another to watch a muggle film with him, but to do the latter in his bed? Surely that was blurring the lines between friendly acquaintances and friends, right?
Around half way through the film, Harry let out a rather deep sigh. Draco froze for a moment, before he quietly called out Harry's name. When he got no response, he tried again. Harry remained motionless and didn't acknowledge Draco's attempts at gaining his attention. It took a moment for Draco to realise that Harry had fallen asleep.
Harry noticed Draco's hesitation and let out a sigh. Draco couldn't place the emotion behind it, but he quickly gathered it had something to do with frustration when Harry quite literally dragged him into his bed. They fell on top of each other in an awkward tangle of limbs that they quickly tried to reacted from each other, only to get more tangled. Before he knew it, Draco was playfully wrestling Harry on his bed, rolling on top of each other in a vain attempt to be the one who maintained dominance.
With that, they shook hands.
Draco scrambled to resume his reading position before they passed by him. He cracked open his book once more and stretched the spine out until he heard it crackle, then kicked a leg up to rest it over his knee.
"I'm sorry," Draco said suddenly. He retracted his hand from Harry's and placed both his hands in his lap. Harry looked at him with confusion, a running theme between them, but Draco couldn't look at him.
But now they all sit in the library, Pansy and Blaise included, and study together. It’s not only beneficial to their grades, but to their house points as well; they all received fifty point each for house unity. Harry loves these moments, watching the six of them - six complete individuals whom he never thought would ever get along in a million years - argue and laugh and banter together. Draco loves seeing Harry smile at these moments. He loves the fling in his eyes and the way he becomes soft yet strong, giving yet assertive. It 8: rather sexy.
"No, no no no, it's...it's okay," Draco found himself saying. "I was just surprised, was all. I knocked on your door expecting a punch to the nose and now we're cuddling on your bed."
"You weren't the one who shoved a whole treacle tart in his mouth all at once," Draco grumbled once he swallowed the damned thing. He screwed up his face at the taste, then reached for his glass of water and gulped down what was left until he was sucking down droplets.
"I've looked through every book I can find," Granger said with a defeated sigh. "Both Professor McGonagall and Madame Pomfrey gave me permission to look in the Restricted Section of the library and I couldn't find anything. We fought through a war, Ron; I doubt any of us will be okay for a while, especially Harry. We just have to hope he wears himself out enough in the next few days that he passes out on his own accord."
Granger and Weasley passed where he was sitting and spared him tired smiles, which he reciprocated, hoping they couldn't see his guilt lying between his thinly stretched lips over having overheard their conversation. Neither of them said anything, and Granger even dared to squeeze Draco's shoulder as she passed, so he could only presume he was in the clear. He watched as they slipped out the portrait hole and began walking towards the Great Hall before the portrait swung shut.
"I've had a long day," Harry says into Draco's neck. He remains silent to let Harry talk. "Ron and I got into an argument...over you. I forgot to hand in an essay. The first years won't stop following me around and treating me like I'm some deity. I'm so tired of being the Chosen One. I'm so tired of hiding and pretending."
He hadn't meant to eavesdrop, but he couldn't just ignore the latest news about Potter's state, whether or not it was intended to be heard by his ears. Everyone knew that Potter hadn't slept properly since their return to Hogwarts to complete their studies - hell, he probably hadn't slept properly since the start of the war - and concern for the wellbeing of the Saviour of the Wizarding World was growing. Draco hated to admit that he was worried about stupid Scarhead, and he hoped he could ease his guilt and the guilt of Pansy and Blaise by getting some information from Granger and Weasley. Unfortunately, all they did was confirm what everyone already knew and feared: Potter was struggling and nobody knew what to do.
"You're welcome. Are you sure you're okay now?"
Potter remained silent. He was giving Draco that stupid look of his, the one that said
Draco choked on his spit, much to the delight of Harry, who burst into his cheerful laughter that sounded like bells. Draco didn't feel so embarrassed anymore when he made Harry laugh like that.
Draco found himself in slight awe of Potter. The Chosen One, the Golden Boy, wasn't just bisexual, but he was open about it. At least, he was open about it with Draco, which should have been a surprise in itself. He found himself completely speechless, looking at Potter in a different light. His tongue was completely caught in his throat and he couldn't figure out how to work his mouth to respond.
Draco tsked at Harry in a rather affectionate way. "Bit sneaky of you, isn't it, Potter? Well, I suppose not, given your history. Actually, I'm oddly pleased."
Harry stuck out his tongue, successfully rolling Draco onto his back. He slammed his arse onto Draco's hips and pinned him there. Draco couldn't deny that Harry looked quite the vision sitting on top of him, panting and flushed. This afternoon was going a lot differently than he was expecting. Wasn't he supposed to be trying to create a sleeping potion for Harry by now?
"What we're yo expecting, Harry? A full love confession? A proposal? Take me to dinner first, geez."
Potter let out an appalled scoff, although the smirk on his face never dimmed. "Says the one who ate most of the treacle tarts,
"Yes, Ron?"
Draco decided then and there that he was going to be the one to cure Potter of his insomnia. After all, he was a master at potions, everyone knew he was the best, and there was no point in being humble about it now if it meant he could save Potter from himself. There had to have been a potion Madame Pomfrey and Granger missed. If not, Draco would concoct it himself.
"Would you let me speak?"
The touch between them felt electric to Harry. He felt like he was seventeen again, the touch of Draco’s body driving him to distraction.
“Draco,” Harry said quietly, looking at his beloved standing on his doorstop. “What’s happened? Ever since you left I’ve not been able to focus, I’ve been so worried.”
Harry wouldn’t ever have pressured Draco but he was aware enough of his own weaknesses to know it would be more than a relief when Draco wouldn’t have to resist any longer. His aching urge to split his fiancé into pieces on his fat cock was filling far too much of his imagination for anyone’s good.
"Do it, alpha..." he knew he was releasing omega pheromones, leading his alpha to the bite. His whole body was in the verge of pleasure. The bite was strong and mentally overwhelming for the alpha, Draco knew, but it was complete, utter pleasure for the omega. His nipples were hard, his body was shivering, his cunt was wet, just because he could almost feel Harry's teeth sinking into his flesh. "Make me officially yours... And then fuck me into oblivion."
"You're serious?" Theo asked. Draco just nodded in response.
"Actually quite the opposite, it would seem Mr. Malfoy is pregnant." Pansy gasped and slapped her hand over her mouth. Draco felt like the walls were closing in on him. He was in a state of panic and shock.
Harry breathed in Draco's scent, he smelled of the expensive shampoo he uses and the cologne he wore everyday. Harry whispered 'I'm sorry' over again as Draco clutched tighter. "I love you Draco, so much. I want to be there for you and our daughter."
Draco smiled at him and spoke before Pomfrey could. "I'm going to be just fine Gregory. Don't worry." Goyle nodded and Madam Pomfrey carried on.
"You must have something on your mind." Pansy said with an eye roll.
"Well... I have been thinking of upholding the Black family tradition of naming them after a star like me or my Mother."
Draco blushed before saying, "It's not important. It was just one time and I don't even plan on telling him." Blaise went to open his mouth again but Pansy shot him a glare.
Harry took a deep breath before opening the door leading to the Slytherins eighth year boys dormitory. Draco was in the bathroom connected to the room washing his face. Harry watched silently marveling at the boy in front of him. Without the concealing charm Draco usually wore, you could clearly see that he was pregnant. Draco turned around and he realized Harry was standing there. A pain flashed across his face, before it was covered with a stony front. "What do you want? You already said you didn't want to be in her life." Draco said, harshly.
Draco is quick to sober up, caught off guard by Harry's sudden mood change. He leans back a bit to get a better look at Potter, to do what Harry likes to call a 'Malfoy Scan.' Unfortunate name but rather to the point. Harry squirms under Draco's stare and tries to hide behind his arms. He even goes as far as to tuck his chin into his neck. This makes Draco chuckle in his loving sort of way.
Draco ignored the racing of his heart as he poked his head out of his room. The common room was completely empty, everyone else either in the Great Hall eating lunch for down at Hogsmeade. Pansy and Blaise had tried to convince him to go along, but he'd waved them off with he excuse of being exhausted and needing to rest. Good thing he did, too, or he would've missed such an opportune time. With a final check to his left and right, Draco slipped out of his room.
"Wonders never cease to exist, huh?" Harry said with a laugh. More sounds of bells filled the room. "I guess I just thought, you wouldn't have asked me to lunch if you didn't want to be friends. And I do this with my friends - yes, even Neville, don't give me that look, Draco."
"Something wrong?" Potter asked when Draco turned to him with a puzzled expression on his face.
Draco moves to go back to kissing Harry's neck, but he stops right before his lips touch skin. He remembers they're outside, and as much as he's having fun just lavishing Harry, he doesn't want to continue any further until they're inside. Nothing more than kissing and making out is going to happen tonight - they don't need to speak verbally to agree on that - but who wants to say their first proper make out session with their first proper boyfriend was in a cemetery? Certainly not Draco.
Draco was sure the muggle film was good. He picked up on bits and pieces and was more than impressed. After years of hating muggle things, of shunning it and cursing it out, he found himself gravitating towards it more often than not nowadays. However, he couldn't concentrate on this piece when Harry Potter was laying on his chest, his head moving with every breath Draco took. He'd let out breathy laughter when he found something funny, and fidgeted when there was yelling or arguing. Draco tried, he really did, to watch the film, but he couldn't take his eyes off of Harry.
"Friends," he said.
"I know, I'm hilarious. Everyone will know something’s up if I wear your tie tomorrow.”
Potter's room was the first door to the right after you came off the stairs. Draco's room was one door over from Potter's, separated by an unoccupied room nobody had dared tried to enter. After the hell that was the Room of Requirement, everybody had been much too afraid to accidentally open Pandora's box again. McGonagall hadn't mentioned anything about it, so they all left well enough alone. Draco didn't even spare it a glance as he passed bye; using his fear instead to fuel him forward and knock on Potter's door before he could convince himself otherwise.
"What now?" Harry says. He sound a lot less...turned on; his voice is steadier, his eyes clearer, and Draco realises he must sense his hesitation.
Draco noticed a significant lack of photos of the Weaslette. There were plenty of her with her brothers, or with Granger and Lovegood, but only one of her and Potter together; and even then, they were separated by Mrs Weasley standing proudly between them. Draco found himself frowning as he scanned the walls with quick eyes, certain he had missed the photos of them together. He could have sworn they were dating. Had he been wrong?
"Thank you."
"Wearing each other's clothes already, Draco. Take me to dinner first, geez."
So it's no surprise when that sends Harry over the edge. Tears build in his eyes, and he shakes his head in defeat. The sight makes Draco's heart break. This wasn't how this was supposed to go. He wishes he could take the past thirty seconds back and start over.
Harry pushed himself off Draco's chest and turned to him with furrowed brows. "Shit, sorry, not good? It's just, this bed is smaller than our old beds and I wasn't thinking and - shit."
"Hnnng,
He began to pace across the floor of his room, wondering how he was ever going to get Potter alone when his best friends were around him all the time. They flanked him like guards on patrol, kept him safe and never left him. Draco couldn't blame them - after everything that had happened, even Draco was afraid to be alone. He tried to stay by Pansy and Blaise's side as much as possible, and he wrote to his mother most days, just to make sure she was alive, if not completely sane. Granger and Weasley had every right to stay by Potter's side. The only time they dared leave him was during meal times, but they were far and few between -
"Precisely."
Harry recovered with a loud cough. He shook the device in his hand to grab Draco's attention. "We'll do so with this. It's a portable DVD player - just came out recently, too. Arthur Weasley helped me sneak it in."
Draco pulls away, much to the distaste of Harry, and smirks. "Please what?"
"One second!" Potter called, sounding rather awake for someone who hand't slept in a good week or so.
Draco nodded. "That's fair. Save yourself some room for new memories."
"Take off your coat and give me your left arm."
"Wear my scarf? And my tie, if you want."
Harry did wear Draco’s tie the next morning. Nobody noticed at first - they walked into the Great Hall separately. Harry sat with Hermione and Ron, Draco with his friends, and tried their hardest not to look at each other and smirk. Hermione, ever the observer, was the first to spot the different coloured tie around Harry’s neck. She screeched, and slapped Ron’s arm, then screeched some more when she pulled Harry’s (deliberately upturned) collar and noticed the hickeys on his neck.
"Not even with the-"
"True. But nothing will ever come close to 'Neville Longbottom.'"
Potter stepped back and opened the door wider, and open invitation for Draco to step inside. He hesitated for a moment before he threw courage to the wind and crossed over into Potter's room. He could feel Potter's magic as soon as he stepped inside - strong and powerful. Mixed with Draco's magic, the room began to buzz with an insistent hum. Draco looked to Potter and realised he could feel it, too.
"My sentiments exactly."
Harry kisses him, hard and fast. It catches Draco off guard. He nearly falls backwards from the pure force of it. There's too much teeth and biting and - oh, there's some tongue - but it's their first kiss and it's amazing. Draco grips desperately onto Harry's waist and tries to bring them as close together as physically possible. The action makes Harry groan, and isn't that the most beautiful sound in the whole entire world?
"No. I'm sorry. Please, the floor's all yours."
The library is their 'secret' spot now, nice and open and totally assuming so everybody is forced to entertain that that's where two of the most powerful wizards go to hide. They arrive together, practically joined at the hip, but far
Draco never explicitly said so at any point, but he had always admired Harry. There wasn't even one specific thing he admired, simply Harry's whole being. Even when he thought he hated the stupid prick, Draco admired him. Harry just had that personality that forced you to like him, and you could either fight it like Draco had, and hate yourself for it, or accept it and become one of his greatest friends, as everyone else had. Right now was one of those times where Draco was glad he decided to flip his mindset. His only wish was that he could have done it sooner.
"What should we do now? I don't think I can eat anymore if I tried," Draco said.
"I was crying because I felt like we were on different pages. Ron and I argued over what was happening between us. He accused you of using me, that our sneaking around was the only way you would ever see me. I tried to say otherwise, but Ron's stubborn. So am I, I guess. He told me to get my shit together or stop talking about it, which was fair, but it still hurt. I haven't told Hermione yet, so I couldn't even confide in her. And I don't trust anyone else."
"There's something I want to do first, if you'll let me?"
"Not just for you," Malfoy corrects. "For us. It'll take time and communication and
He wasn't given any time to recover; as soon as the film had been set up, Harry was placing the DVD player on Draco's waist and making himself comfortable Draco's chest. Draco stared down at Harry with wild eyes, completely breathless but not daring to try and fill his lungs with air lest he disturb the current occupant of his chest. The lines between friendly acquaintances and friends had definitely been blurred now.
"Or you can name them after a flower. Narcissus are flowers." Theo said, still finishing his homework.
"Of course." Draco told her grabbing the book where it rested next to him. He let out a breath of air he didn't know he was holding when Hermione turned and seemed to be about to walk away.
Draco and Goyle were huddled together on a hospital bed looking at a picture of the baby girl growing in Draco's stomach. McGonagall smiled at the two ex-death eaters who melted at the sight of a small child. She soon cleared her throat and said, "Have you told the other father yet? I expect they are a student here."
Draco shook his head, "Pansy's stays." Pomfrey nodded in understanding as the rest left. Blaise squeezing Draco's shoulder before leaving.
Draco sat around the common room, which was empty except for his friends. Blaise and Goyle were playing exploding snaps and Theodore was studying. Pansy sat next to Draco looking at the image of his child, her eyes welling up with tears and a huge grin on her face. Draco couldn't help but smile also. "What are you going to name them?" Pansy asked, finally looking up.
The faces of shock changed to look at her.
"Wait Draco's in love with me? Then why would he avoid me and then lie?" Harry asked incredulously.
"I'm sorry. I have to ask, are you pregnant?" Hermione asked turning back around her curiosity getting the best of her.
"Well you could have fooled me." Draco answered coldly, pushing past Harry to go to the trunk by his bed.
"Me and Ginny broke up before the war started. We weren't fit for each other even before Voldermort," Draco's face become surprised for a moment and Harry continued, "I didn't kiss you for a one night stand. I'm just not good with words, I'm good with action. So, I kissed you and when you kissed me back I figured you liked me too. Except, you're really great at snogging. I couldn't pull away and talk even though I knew we should. Then we shagged and I fell asleep with you in my arms. You were gone when I woke up." Harry paused, lost in his memories.
"Adhara Cassia Malfoy-Potter." Was the only thing Harry said is response. Draco pulled back a smile on his face and he nodded. Then he pulled Harry in to a long overdue kiss.
"Well it's no surprise he wanted to get into your pants, I'm more surprised at why he didn't want to continue. He's been completely in love with you for forever. The whole school knows, it was a downright shock when you and Ginny got together." Ron told him.
"Pansy!" Draco hissed.
"Merlins saggy balls you slept with Malfoy." Ron said seeming to just get the pregnant part.
“And I get that, I really do” Harry said, running his hands over his beard as he thought about what he wanted to say.
Eventually, Harry started to feel the cool; the sweat coating his body making him chilling. Opening his eyes, he found his wand, casting a warming spell for him and Draco to relax underneath.
After showered, clean and dry, he put on some shorts and a tee and sat down on his desk. He was about to grab a piece of parchment and a quill when he remembered the device his boyfriend had given him a few months before. He opened his drawer, grabbing the little muggle machine with the name NOKIA on top, and looked at the bars that said if it had energy or not. It still had two bars, so he guessed he didn't need to ask Harry to charge it just yet.
“We’re forever, Draco.
Maybe that was why this obsession with Malfoy seemed to have developed. The scent of the man, his long white neck... It seemed like every second thought had been of the omega all weekend. He’d searched for blonds on his favourite porn sites (the only ones that didn’t use synthetic drugs to put omegas into heat - he boycotted those on principle) but somehow the omegas on those sites weren’t
Draco knew better, though.
was all he wanted.
“Let’s get rid of these now,” he asked, teasing at the lacy material.
He loved the sight of Draco’s blond hair bobbing up and down at his front, and he ran his hands through it to show how much he was loving it. Harry was so close to coming it would take very little to push him over the edge, so when Draco asked him to come in his mouth, it was obvious he’d only last a few more seconds.
Talking about report piles, Draco's were even bigger. His office was enormous, as the only son and heir of the Malfoy Company would have. The floor was a dark colour of Mahogany wood, just like the big circular desk in the centre of the room. The walls were a cream colour and, behind the desk, a huge glass window that showed the whole city, as he was in the 16th floor.
Harry couldn’t even contain his joy as he pulled Draco close, linking their hands. There were huge obstacles ahead of them, Lucius, obliviation, memory loss, and so much more. But to be honest, they were strong enough to handle it all. At least now they had that chance.
"Sorry, Draco," Nott released his arm immediately, noticing that Draco's hair slipped from his shoulder, his eyes going to Draco's pale neck immediately. "I just don't understand why you would agree with the newbie and not with me."
On his side, Draco had too many calls from Nott that day. Asking if he could be the one going to the field -
Harry couldn’t help himself, leaning in to kiss Draco’s furled, soaking hole, feeling shivery, and sexy, and close to coming himself. The tightness was wonderful, and Harry couldn’t believe that Draco was letting him have this privilege.
"Hello, Potter. You're early, I see. Good to know some of our employees are punctual," Draco smiled, as if he was daring Harry to say something inappropriate.
Harry finished of the last of his cola, and collected the packaging together onto their tray. Harry pushes it into the bin, and turned back to face Draco.
He loved that Harry respect his boundaries and never pressed him to do anything he didn't want. That boundaries were born not only from tradition, but also because Draco had a few differences about his body. He was born intersexed, as it was somehow common for pureblood babies, specially nowadays with such small number of families. They had magical treatments to keep them fertile, and special babies like him, were treated as a rare diamond. Draco was taught to hide himself from view and remain pure and untouched until marriage. He was treated as a boy his whole life, although he knew, if he wished, being who he was, his family would’ve accepted him as a girl, or even both.
Before Draco could answer, Harry had kissed him and made his head all empty except for his lips and the feeling they made him feel. Draco gave all of him in the kiss, his wet body shivering a little with the cold and making his nipples peak.
Not very long after, they saw one of the players that used to play with Harry a few years ago. She asked for a break after she got pregnant, but didn't come back immediately after birth. Now, her kid was about two and she was working as a sports journalist. Draco waved at her but didn't go talk to her, mostly because of Jasmine that was playing with a frog toy, and because she was becoming a little lazy after their lunch. Harry got up to talk to his work mate, and Draco started to watch Jasmine instead.
But he’d promised Draco he wouldn’t sexualise the situation. Harry wanted Draco to understand that what he was offering was love; he didn’t want to own Draco, Harry just wanted Draco to feel happiness and so far his beloved seemed more filled with joy than he’d ever seen him.
“She’s wonderful,” said Harry, “she looks like she’s enjoying it.” His voice was full of wonder at his daughter enjoying her first meal. He thought Draco incredible, her body the work of a miracle; able to create and sustain life.
Draco felt a shiver down his body with the thought.
“You’ve been amazing today, so sexy, so hot... Now, I’m going to concentrate on your cock, make you forget you’re hurt. You’re going to show me how you can come just for me...”
and a girl with the user
Draco just decided he didn't want to wait. He felt ready, completely ready. He got hold of the base of Harry's cock, lined it with his slick cunt and sink it in until he was completely sat over Harry's lap, letting gravity to the job for him.
. Finally.
Yes, the idea was definitely growing on him. He’d improve the wards on the outside of their home too, and ask his friends in the Aurors to check whether there were any current threats circulating.
He wanted Harry to mark him. He wanted Harry to
Draco read and reread those words over and over, his fingers pressing and caressing his length while he imagined that. It took him a while to come, and he sighed happily when he felt his orgasm. Harry was yet to make him come, but Draco knew it was worth the wait.
Harry body felt utterly enticed by Draco. An insatiable greed had overtaken him at that first taste, and while he couldn’t, wouldn’t ever demand, he knew that whatever Draco gave he would eagerly take. His whole body felt inflamed with want.
Harry thought how wonderful this week would be. The dinners, the walks, and just the conversations. It all felt like a dream really. Not that he was going to say anything; he could just imagine being called a sappy git if he said any of this aloud...
But then Harry started to touch him like that and Draco didn't even think about complaining. He straddled Harry's legs and sat on his lap, smiling at him and feeling his heart beat faster.
Draco finished with a kiss on Harry's mouth, letting Harry manoeuvre him as he liked. He loved how he perfectly fitted Harry's lap.
“Oh yes!” Lyra chimed in, “Daddy always steals the biggest slices, and we have to have Hawaiian in his side of the pizza! If you came, we could get two! And ice cream tubs for afterwards! Oh, do say you’ll come.”
Pulling off Draco, Harry looked his darling in the eye. “I’d like to finger your arsehole, Draco... Use my fingers to open you wide. I want to touch your sweet spot and make you writhe in pleasure. What do you think, baby? No pressure, I just want to make you feel good.”
"I don't care, Harry... Being honest, I... Like it. I like you being possessive over me. I want to show off your mark, I want you to
Harry knew he was treading on some very thin ice indeed. He’d known Draco such a short time, but he was falling for the omega, far too quickly, and far too deeply. He forced the thought from him mind, and concentrated on the beat of his omega’s heart, soft and sensual, and right next to his own.
Harry found Draco on the sofa. His husband had lit the fire and appeared to be eating some disgusting looking concoction that was on a plate in front of him.
Harry signed at the vast pile of paperwork littering his desk. He knew that clients were waiting on these reports but somehow he couldn’t muster the enthusiasm that normally came with the weekend.
Harry tried to focus his attention back on the football, but it was gone. After a few minutes sat on the settee, he realised that their home was silent.
my appearance every day of my life,” Draco swallowed saliva, his heart beating even faster now. “And... you know, that according to my personal beliefs, I'm starting to get too old. I should've had babies like five years ago. So I'd...
“Yes, we did have animals, but I never saw them quite that young. I didn't take care of them,” Draco looked at him, her cheeks bright red. “Fang wasn't a

, right?”
Harry looked down at Draco, feeling overwhelmed by the strength of his emotions; Draco could make him feel like no other person on Earth.
Draco laughed against Harry's mouth, his hands forgetting his own robes and supporting him on Harry's shoulders.
“Stay and I’ll make you feel nice, baby...” Harry moved his hands downwards to the front of Draco’s shorts.
When his fingers started to move inside him, Draco screamed. The hard flow of the water on his nipples were like an erotic massage, and soon, he was coming. From his cock, only little droplets were out, but  his cunt was overflowing with thick slick, his muscles hugging Harry's fingers as if asking them to be inside him forever.
But it was the dinners that Harry really enjoyed. He couldn’t believe Draco remained quite as slim as he did, considering his love of fine dining. Harry thought he’d have to get back on the Quidditch pitch as soon as they returned to England.
"Potter... Harry. Can I talk to you? It's important." Harry nodded a questioning glint in his emerald eyes. Harry waited for Draco to talk and then Draco finally opened his mouth.
"Yeah I guess, but stars are so much better." Pansy added looking at Draco funny. As if he confused her with his statement.
Harry was shocked. Draco and him have sex, Draco ignores him, and now months later he just drops a bomb about how he's pregnant. Harry didn't know how to feel. Should he be angry that Draco didn't tell him earlier or angry that Draco is pregnant at all. He just fought a war and he's not even out of school yet. Happy, because he's going to have a child. Scared, because he has no idea how to raise a child. All of his emotions conflicted, so in the end he was just numb. He didn't even notice his feet carrying him to the great hall before he sat down nect to his friends and Ginny asked if he was alright.
"Like Lily." Draco breathed out thinking about Harry's mother before frowning at his thoughts straying to Harry.
Right before they left Madam Pomfrey spoke up once again, "Oh, and Mr. Malfoy I expect it would be best to inform the father." Without acknowledging her they left.
Draco nodded, but Goyle started saying something softly, "Draco's going to be okay, right? With the pregnancy and all."
"Congratulations. It's a girl, Mr. Malfoy"
When Draco had to go to Pomfrey again only Goyle was with him. The rest had class instead of a free period. When they went in they were surprised to see McGonagall was there also. "Hello, Mr. Malfoy. Poppy informed me of your... circumstances."
Draco was first forced to go to see Madam Pomfrey after 3 days of getting sick with no explanation. He didn't eat anything different and didn't have a fever, but Pasy was worried so she wrangled up the rest of their Slytherin friends to make him go to the hospital wing. Draco huffed and puffed as Pansy, Blaise, Theo, and Gregory escorted him. That's how he found himself sitting in the empty room on a hospital bed.
"Are you going to keep it?" Goyle asked softly. Shocking the rest who didn't expect him to speak up.
It was not something any one in the room was expecting him to say and they all looked shocked. "Oh, Draco." Pansy said, before pulling Draco into a hug. That is when Draco started to sob. No one spoke any more, but they stayed in the same position for the rest of the night.
"I didn't say I didn't want to be in her life, Draco. You just surprised me. I didn't know how to react. You have to know I would never deliberately hurt you or this baby." Harry told him, his voice pained and pleading.
Granger and Weasley were down having lunch. And hadn't Granger taken Potter up to his room just minutes before she began discussing his state with Weasley? As much as Draco had vowed not to sneak around anymore, now was his only real chance of catching Potter by himself without anybody else staring them down the whole time. He had - what? Fifteen minutes, if that, to speak to Potter, try his best to condense the long apology speech he had created, and see what state he was in so he could make a potion. Easy, right?
Harry rolled his eyes. "Get over here and watch the damn film with me, Draco."
"More, please," Draco begs.
"I never told you to stuff that tart in your mouth." Potter took Draco's glass and refilled it with the tap of his wand. "Here. As I was saying, you chose to do that all on your own. Never thought you'd have it in you."
They would have to talk more when Harry woke up. Draco was more than happy to help him in the interim, but they'd have to find another way to get Harry to sleep without him. Maybe he'd work alongside Harry in producing a spleen potion, rather than doing it himself. Maybe that would help. Either way, Draco was determined to be the one to fully cure Harry Potter of his sleep troubles. He wouldn't be doing it for anyone else but for his friend.
