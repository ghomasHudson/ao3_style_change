"I know that. The question is: do you know that?" Draco continued speaking with a flat tone at Harry, hoping he would realize what's been happening.
Harry adjusted his scarf around his neck as a cold breeze hit him. New York is very cold as the year gets to an end and the streets were filled with frantic no-majs hurrying to buy presents for their loved ones and the last decoration details to receive the last month of the year with happiness and relief.
Harry is scared and frustrated with parenting, he doesn't know what to do but eventually comes around when Draco throws a cold bucket of reality at him.
"I'll try harder," Said Harry to Draco later when they found themselves laying down on their sides, facing each other with the sleeping boy in the middle. "I promise I'll try harder, I'm so sorry, babe," He whispered to the blond who smiled lovingly.
I also want to know what Harry and Draco will wear for Halloween, Severus gave you a hint at the end. I hope you enjoy.
The Draco Harry fell in love with it's very different from the Draco he met in his first year at Hogwarts, he wasn't so keen on material things anymore, Draco now enjoys having quality time with Harry over any other thing that could be bought in a store. However, Harry is always filling Draco with gifts, not always expensive gifts of course, more like meaningful gifts.
"We've been here for over two months now, he has had plenty of time to adjust and of course I've read those stupid books you gave me and they haven't help to shut him," Harry rose his voice at the sight of Draco going to their closet to take out an extra pillow and blanket.
EDIT: I made some changes in the story, If you're reading this, please re-read at least the first ones because I added how Pansy and Blaise became friends with Harry and I added Severus to the story. I also changed all chapters POV to a third person teller, so it will flow better.
Clementine has a glimpse of the future, Pansy is angry. Harry's paranoid and Severus finally arrives. Halloween is soon.
This chapter was one of the hardest I had to write, especially because I'd been writing it for at least a month and when I finally finished it I end up in tears. Fathers-children relationships have always been a touchy subject for me after losing my father twice in this life.
"So, are you single? Would you like to have a drink with me?" she asked giving him the box already wrapped. Harry didn't have time to answer as he felt slender hands on his waist from behind. By the cinnamon smell that filled the air around him, he knew who was gripping his waist so delicately.
"Baby, no, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you cry" Harry panicked but Draco shook his head and closed his eyes.
"Let's. " Draco replied and wrapped his hand around Harry's elbow as the stronger man guided them both into a Starbucks store.
"Sure," she smiled softly as he put the figurine in a box to then wrap it with green velvet paper and a silver ribbon. "Is it for a girlfriend perhaps?" She asked cautiously.
Harry instantly knew this was the gift he wanted to give Draco for Christmas, so he went into the store and asked for the figurine, the salesclerk with a flirtatious smile went after the figurine and once this was in his hands Harry knew this was Draco's old figurine, he felt magic coursing through him, he recognized it as Draco's and a little bit of Narcissa's magic was in it, the smile his fiance will have in his face when his sees the figurine made Harry smile and tear up a little.
So, I hope you like this chapter, its fluffy filler before the reunion between Harry, Draco and the Weasleys.
The streets and the stores were decorated with Christmas trees and glowing lights, the weather was cold and the snow was falling all over New York City adorning it in a Christmas-y look. Harry felt contentment in his heart as he remembered the Christmas with the Weasleys, at Hogwarts or the Burrow, then Chritsmas with Draco wearing all the ugly Christmas sweaters he could find that look adorable on him, those exchanges of gifts near the crackling fire along with hot cocoa and marshmallows, Harry leaning in to kiss away the cocoa remains from Draco's lips, Pansy, her girlfriend and baby Lucy joining them, exchanging gifts, hugs, and laughter. Severus and Blaise singing Christmas Carols and giving them thoughtful gifts would seem old but they enjoyed it.
"I'm not spoiling him, he is just trying to adjust to his new life, and if you would've read one of the books I gave you about parenting you would know that," Draco had enough of Harry petty attitude for a night and maybe for the rest of the week. He pushed the covers aside and stepped out of the bed putting on his house robe and his flippers.
"What are you doing here?" Harry asked as he took Draco's hand in his when they started walking outside the store.
Draco pressed a kiss on the back of Harry's neck. "Here you are, baby, I was looking for you," He said pulling away just in time to catch Harry's lips as he turned around. "I know we said we will see each other at Starbucks at five, but I couldn't wait... I hope I'm not spoiling my surprise," Draco's eyes averted at the green box settled in Harry's hand.
Harry attends his first parent meeting, he is nervous. Teddy is a sweetheart. Harry is attacked by his memories back at Hogwarts and ends up getting hurt.
" I love you more, Harry, now stop being hysteric and let's continue with this date." Draco chuckled and Harry followed his suit.
A pair of arms wrapped them both in a warm and comforting embrace. When Harry felt Draco's arms around him he cried even louder as the blond spread kissed all over his head.
"No, it wasn't, this is not a competition," Harry sat straight to have a better discussion with Draco. " We are not competing to see who he loves the most,"
"For your information," she drawls, posture straight but with her shoulders waning. "I stayed up all night trying to figure out heads or tails of my situation. And then it occurred to me that, hey, Potter goes through these things as well, should I consult her?"
Sitting up, Harry quickly throws her blanket over her bruised knees, smiling. “I’ll be over in a bit, Auntie. I need to do something.”
Although Harry has nothing on but her trunk, she stays for three days. She returns to her uncle's home carrying even more things than she had brought, and along with ladles a realisation that spawns the rebirth of her true identity.
They would ask Gem that? It strikes her then that she isn't the only one suffering from schoolmates being idiots about being transgender– Gemini is, too. Had she been so blithely wrapped up in her own upset that she hadn't noticed? A pang of guilt swipes at her conscience.
"Have you seen Malfoy? I'd reckon she doesn't make too bad of a girl," he says to her absent-mindedly, scratching at his tie.
Harry sits on her bed, watching Parvati do Hermione’s makeup. How does Hermione sit through that and not squirm, even a little? Having a girl that close to Harry would surely make her blush. But Hermione isn’t like that, she reminds herself. Stupid sapphic lizard brain!
“There’s a word for that?” His confused voice cuts through, so startling that she has to stare. It’s as if he’s completely forgotten who he is talking to. “I didn’t know. How do I make these uncomfortable feelings go away?”
Dark spots dance across her vision. She groans, burying herself further into the soft surface beneath her. Everything hurts so badly. It's like all of her senses had been cranked up to the highest sensitivity. The sterile smell that lingers in the air makes her head throb. Ugh.
She’d found herself lying under a bush in the garden in a valiant attempt at avoiding her lousy excuse of a bunch of relatives when Vernon had stormed outside, ruining her peace to scold her for being a useless lump. It was perfectly fine when Hermione did the same –although she'd never admit it– but her aunt doing it was the last straw.
Even after she had given the memo to Snape and went back to the common room, she ended up thinking again. She imagines herself on an empty ballroom floor, Gemini’s arm around her waist, the two of them drifting back and forth, faces unreadable due to a cloud of haziness.
Harry stares bitterly at her atrociously bad cuticles and doesn't utter a word. She bites at them whenever she feels anxious, and it so happens that she is perpetually nervous.
It's freezing out here. She pulls the cardigan closer to herself, gesturing to Malfoy. "We should go back to the castle. You can show me how you look in the clothes you have."
"Wha? What is it," Gemini murmurs sleepily. Her eyes widen to a comically large size. "You're awake!"
She ends up not going to the owlery at all. These days she sneaks down to the Prefects' Bathroom because communal showers are a nightmare. It's nice to be by herself. Upon pulling herself into the dorm, there's a sleek, gorgeous owl sitting by the ledge of the window holding a piece of parchment in its beak.
Immediately her training from Cedric kicks in. She can hear his recitation from the guidebook repeating smoothly in her head. Harry lifts her arms, positioning them to Gemini as an offer to lead, her grey eyes twinkling with surprise.
It's early morning. Blearily Harry pokes her head out of the doors, seeing many students walking by. She's changed into a light purple hoodie, so there's a pleasant sort of coldness left, but not enough for her to shiver. Nobody should be in the library at this time, she figures.
Her voice doesn't end up breaking at all. She accidentally charms a bicycle to fly her  all the way to Hogwarts one day in advance, shivering violently throughout the entire trip. It's the only way not to be caught by muggles.
Harry draws her knees to her chest, looping her arms over them. "None of the names have jumped out at me too."
Cedric Diggory is giving dancing lessons down in Hufflepuff. And he does owe her a favour, doesn’t he? Perhaps this is the time to take advantage of that.
A cold gust of air hits her face when she enters the dungeons. This part of the castle is indeed far colder than the rest, so she shrinks as much into herself as she can, hiding under her red scarf.
Well, Harry knew what was coming, but she didn’t expect this conversation. She’s feeling an awful lot like a mum. If only Malfoy had someone like Aunt Lorraine to help figure himself out, she thinks. “Like with pronouns. Ask your friends to refer to you by feminine pronouns. That makes me feel better after being misgendered all day.”
(And now Malfoy is peering imploringly at Harry with the widest look in her eyes as if she'd discovered the meaning of life.)
"Have you chosen a name for yourself yet?" asks Malfoy, much more softly than before. "You can take a while to mull over these things. It's a big deal."
"In all honesty, I don't mind the name Harry. It doesn't make me feel dysphoric or anything, so I figured Harriet would be fine. People can go on calling me Harry but when they see my proper name they'll know I'm a girl. Also, James was my middle name, my dad's name, so it'll only make sense that it'll be Lily for my mom's instead had I been born a daughter? Wait. I'm rambling, aren't I?" Harry trails off, deflating, then flushes again. She shoots a glance at Malfoy. "Did you tell your friends you were trans before you moved?"
"People calling you an attention whore," she mutters, running a hand through her hair and feeling it resist to succumb. "They'll say whatever they want to say about you. Plenty of nasty things behind your back, or such."
It is eerily quiet in there. She was too accustomed to the place bustling with her classmates, so it feels odd to see it barren.
“What kind of ballroom dancer is the one who can’t lead and follow? I’ll figure something out with the rest of the girls, Gem. Don’t you worry your pretty little head about it,” Parkinson says finally, then the remainder of their conversation slips out of earshot.
In the middle of Hagrid's lesson, she receives a message – thrust into her hand by another student whose name she does not know. It's a note carried between the folds of a silken handkerchief, embroidered with the initials D.M. She nearly lets out a snort when she sees it. Trust Malfoy to have his own embroidered handkerchief.
"Huh? Harry," Hermione hisses, grabbing at her shoulder. "Don't grab them so openly! Some boys are looking in this direction!"
She takes another deep breath to settle herself. The musty smell of books is oddly comforting, yet it can't replace the sweet fragrance of cotton candy.
There's a heavy weight on her numb thigh. She grabs at it only to take a fistful of soft, silky hair. It's tangled like it hasn't been combed in days.
"Stop trying to pull my leg, Harry! We still have so much to talk about. You're not going to die yet, you dolt!" Frustrated, Gemini grabs Harry's face and their lips press together for a split second.
And her unwilling participation in the Triwizard Tournament would worsen it. There would be what? Two other schools joining? How many more people would conduct their own critical cross-examinations about the girl who lived?
Among the items, there is a girl’s blouse and a red skirt fashioned out of a vibrant-coloured velvet. Even while sprawled out on the dirty floor, the beauty of the garments is unmistakable. How on earth had these clothes ended up in his bag? What would he need these for?
Gemini, affronted, clutches her chest oddly, feeling a strange warm banking feeling there stutter so jerkily she fears everyone in her vicinity might feel it as well.
Her aunt softens immediately, moving in to hug her. She tucks the girl's head into her shoulder and Harry takes in a shuddery breath. She hasn't had a hug like this in years.
Spare a little empathy here. She just wanted to go away. It was late at night, and it wasn’t really a surprise when she ended up getting lost.
Somehow, even after the sheer ridiculousness of the first and second challenge, she still finds herself shaking her head. Yet she can't stifle the cumbersome worries she brings with her to every affair, knowing just a fraction of the danger Harry will have to endure. "Do they want to kill the champions that badly?"
The Yule Ball will be a spectacular affair, so it makes sense that preparations will be just as harried. Thankfully the condition for dress robes in the packing list has already been fulfilled. On her birthday Aunt Lorraine had asked for her measurements, taking off to secure her something 'wonderful' to wear. It's still a surprise.
She wouldn't quite know what to do if a magical structure would reject her, but with each step she takes, she feels like she's taken a spoonful of sweet, syrupy approval right in her mouth. She saunters to catch up after Hermione and smiles all the way up the staircase.
She recalls meeting Voldemort, yet her memories of that night are faded, feeling more like a horrible nightmare. She draws the curtains around her bed quickly. In the bed next to hers, Cedric is sitting up, eating some porridge.
Only two weeks have passed, but her hair has grown unbelievably long, reaching the end of her back. The colour of her hair works wonders in the winter sun, making it glow like a white halo. It looks as pretty as Harry has imagined being, yet she doesn't feel a twinge of envy. Gemini catches sight of Harry, pauses, then races forward to meet her.
“Watch where you’re going, Potter!” Malfoy bites out, irritated as he dusts the non-existent lint off his pants.
"Fine. Want to play Exploding Snap? Seamus brought it from the common room," Ron says. They crawl onto the floor to play several rounds. It's so exciting that she nearly forgets to try out the cosmetic spells she learnt before she goes to bed.
"Are you sure Goyle can't take you?" Parkinson asks impatiently. She speaks more crudely, Harry notes. It's nothing like the incredibly fake snide voice she normally uses.
As absurd as the situation is, she can't help feeling the thrill of having some leverage over him. However, this wasn't what she had come for.
"Can I see you?" Self-consciously Harry folds her arms over her chest, ruffled. Gemini looks her up and down with a nod. "It suits you."
"Potter, I'm pretty sure the whole school is talking about how Sirius Black has broken into your dorm trying to finish what he's started and the first thing you start talking about is
"Everyone in the school knows about us by now. I mean, us, like separately. Ron used to complain about me hanging out with you but now he's seemed to accept that we're similar and we'll just have to get along," Harry mumbles, going off a tangent once she sits down and properly talks to Malfoy.
Her worry gets the best of her anyway. She mutters a half-hearted excuse to Pansy, dismisses herself, half-running down the stairs. There’s a tent set up nearby. Gemini casts a disillusionment charm and ducks inside. The other participants in the tents look somewhat battered, Madam Pomfrey skirting from one to another. Clearly, Harry isn’t a priority right now, because she’s sitting at the side on a chair.
"No, you're not dreaming, Harry! I swear to Merlin, I don't remember you being this stupid," the taller girl mumbles, pinching the bridge of her nose, exasperated. She's already in her uniform, but her tie isn't on.
"Oh, my poor Gem," Parkinson laments. Funnily enough, she's not being hyperbolic unironically. "A ravishing blonde beauty and yet no boy wants to come to the ball with you clinging onto his arm."
Harry is going to take a wild guess and say that he's trying to gather the words in his head first. People tend to do that, but she isn't certain she has ever seen
Hermione is standing at the foot of the boys' tower, smiling up at Harry. She smiles back, lugging her trunk down the stairs.
"No, I didn't, Harry. I'm listening to your rambles regardless, so they aren't pointless," she drawls. Her name sounds so lovely on Malfoy's lips, that tinge of familiarity making her swell up like a hot air balloon. She wants to hear Malfoy say it again.
She visits the Weasleys. She visits the Grangers. She does her homework two weeks before school starts. Her uncle can't hurl obscenities at her because she's not in his house. Overall, it's a very good holiday.
"Always a firstborn son, eh? Looks like you'll be the exception," quips Harry. Malfoy looks very pleased by this statement, looking an awful lot like a cat that has got the cream.  Joking with Malfoy is something she's never imagined before because of the sheer absurdity of it all. Even after weeks of meeting up it still feels like a fever dream.
Gemini sidles up to Harry. The girl has so many cuts, a matter that is especially unbecoming. There’s an indignant wave of anger that rushes through her, knowing that she hadn’t signed up for this at all.  Initially, Gemini wanted to check in on her, but since Madam Pomfrey wasn’t going to get around to treating Harry anytime soon, she may as well treat her superficial injuries. “
With Gemini she feels like she's dancing on air, tuning herself to her every side-step while subtly leading the next. There's a similar glaze in her eyes that Harry recognises.
She tunes out her dormmates' chatter for a good while until she hears the words 'third challenge' which snaps her out of her reverie.
"What the hell," he sputters. He didn't anticipate this. "I'm not a crossdresser, you daft Gryffindor! Also, what is a transgender, anyway?"
"You can fuck right off," Gemini replies, but she's smiling through her tears. "A kiss, right after you escaped death? Again? Seriously?"
Gingerly, Gemini reaches out to take it, looping it around her neck, fingering the charm in the middle. "This really works?" Then she is quiet, astonished by the light sound that comes out of her mouth. Her gaze flickers to Harry's eyes; her lips, her scar both all at once and one at a time.
"And I'm not laughing. It's a perfectly good name, Potter." To her disbelief, Malfoy is, out of the blue, dead serious, grey gaze strong in its intensity. Harry has to hide the flush down her neck with a hand.
"--Malfoys don't have friends. Yeah I know, you told me this once. Even still, do I not count?" Gemini blinks at her. What? Harry knows she’s soaking up their conversations like a sponge, and what about it?
"You're awake! Oh no please don't cry… do you want me to get Madam Pomfrey for you? You must be starving," he replies kindly. Harry feels the onset of even more tears come. Cedric is so nice, what the hell. She's going to start bawling.
Thankful for the distraction, Harry smoothes the crumples of her skirt with her fingers. It's unusually soft, so she finds herself toying with it unconsciously. "Harriet Lily Potter. Don't laugh."
"Let me do your makeup. You look so pretty, I can't help not to," she says, cheeks promptly tinted by a pretty pink that is stark on her pale skin. Harry feels her face warm as well.
"So, you're transgender. Your body doesn't match how you actually are so you took hormones that are in pills so you could develop feminine characteristics," Harry says slowly.
This is the place she finds her feeling of safety tangled with. This is where Gemini would meet her, out of the view of everyone else.
Malfoy's owl is already sitting by the window. Harry hangs up a wind chime from her bed, then walks over to read the note.
Harry shakes her head, not prepared to tell the whole truth. "I don't know how the magical world feels about people like us. I'm taking pills to prevent my voice from breaking, but it's not like I'm sprouting boobs or anything. I'll deal with it one day. Just not today. Ron and Hermione know, of course. And Professor McGonagall. That's all."
And that's when she realises she's been looking at all these people. They have a femininity she doesn't possess, but wants to have so badly. What she wants to fit in. Whatever she thinks she would need to have in order to be called a proper woman. It strikes her in the middle of class, when she's staring at the back of Malfoy's head, admiring his lithe shoulders.
It's fun. Since they're much closer to the heart of the city they drop by a humongous shopping mall. There's a department store that stretches three entire floors. As a congratulatory gift for starting estrogen, Aunt Lorraine helps Harry pick out five training bras, all in pretty lacy shades. Her personal favourite is the red one-- Aunt Lorraine says that such a colour would complement her brown skin.
Harry didn't know that Gemini was like this, behind a cold, hardy exterior. She has a sense of humour. Her jokes are never biting and make you laugh. She likes to do her friends' makeup. She's never felt this weird happy feeling with someone else before and it sort of fucks with her head.
Instead of assuming what she's going to say next and preparing a rebuttal, Gemini's gaze meets hers, waiting for her to elaborate.
Not thinking straight, she walks towards the dancing pairs, finding herself whisked into their waltz. She starts with a Durmstrang boy she doesn't know before she ends up dancing with Ernie Macmillian.
"All these names are so… muggle. I'm a witch, I don't want any of these. We need more magical names.
And yes, he is good-looking. Sure. Everyone with eyes knows that. But along with his piercing grey eyes, he has strikingly long pale eyelashes; a jawline that even women would kill for, lips that are never chapped, always pink without lip balm. His hair is silky like a girl's, the smooth texture evident even in its short length.
"What did your aunt say, Potter?" she asks with poorly veiled enthusiasm. "Regarding names, I mean."
He stands there, one of his arms tucked neatly into his chest. It makes him look smaller. She glances at him, recalling the set of clothing she had seen and tries to imagine him wearing it. He wouldn't look half bad, actually. Does he have nice legs? Okay, so what if he has nice legs, no pair of legs can beat Angelina Johnson’s– and girls' legs are so much more worth looking at in her opinion.
"That's it? You come all the way here for that," Harry muses. She sees Gemini's ears start to grow pink. "Thanks, I guess."
"It's from Malfoy Manor’s library. The books in it are all specially charmed so I can summon them at my convenience," Malfoy says. "Charmed, Potter? You're too easily impressed." Although her words are far from sweet, they hold no bite.
"Harry!" Hermione's harried voice travels around the corner, growing closer. Harry keeps up  her fast pace, even going as far as increasing it a little. A few students move out of her way, evidently intimidated. "I don't agree with what Ron said, but you can't go barreling off every time someone does something wrong!"
at a lot of people. Not any random people. She likes to stare at the pretty ones. And although she's well aware that she finds pretty girls rather attractive, this is for different reasons.
It is Scorpius who moves towards Harry, kneeling on the side of his sofa as he reaches a hand inside his own coat. He's taking out the picture of Father, Lily realises. Harry doesn't look surprised, he must have known that one of them had got it. Of course, he would know that.
“And then after the war, we met again in eight year. It was probably our first real meeting. We get to really know each other, no wands, no hexes. The real Draco, how should I say this,” he pauses, a fond look takes over his face. “He’s brilliant, kind, and smart. and beautiful, and funny. He was terribly endearing. He was also sad and fragile in a way I had never thought of him to be.”
"I came back from the dead. I killed one dark lord. And most importantly, I'm marrying the most beautiful man alive. I think you should acknowledge that bringing imaginations to life is my specialty."
The strange look crosses over Draco’s face again, but this time it stays. “The flowers, you had bought them for someone and they must have rejected you, that is why you bring them to work everyday. You look strangely wistful these days. I thought you were seeing someone. Was I wrong?”
He leans down, kissing and sucking and biting onto the soft skin of Draco's neck. His hands trails over both of Draco's arms until they're palms to palms, and their fingers intertwined together. He picks up his pace, going faster and harder and he can only hear the gasps and small moans escaping Draco's lips.
Which is how ten minutes later Harry finds himself sitting at Draco’s kitchen’s counter eating toast. Draco’s sitting silently beside him, taking tiny bites of his own toast.
James glares at Albus, unwavering. “This is why I didn't want to tell you. You’re a fucking child. You wouldn’t understand.”
She looks at Harry. He's her parent, she’d trust her whole life in his hands. She’d trust every word coming out of his mouth, if it had been indoctrinated to her since she could understand words.
Draco stands up straight and waves a hand as he strides around the car towards the driver seat. "Good night, Harry,"
They speak of many things, catching up. And despite what he claimed earlier, Draco is stuck with the longing feeling that he really
He blinks, and Theo is staring at him curiously. His eyes are a pair of stunning hazel, light green and specks of gold. But it didn't seem to be as enchanting as the beautiful, even more rare colour of evergreen. Draco raises an eyebrow.
“I am not-- blind to his actions. He didn't always make the best decision. But I think nobody could. The important thing is that he saved me when it mattered the most. I didn't know what happened to him after that occurrence, but he knew the risks he’d be taking. The Malfoy I knew wasn’t a good person, but then on, I thought he wasn’t so bad either.
Harry panics. He raises his other hand so that he’s framing Draco’s face, soft cheeks under his thumb. It almost feels unreal, that he’s touching the skin he’s been haunted by for the previous week, but under the circumstances so far away from what he had in mind.
He waits, placing his phone on the side of his face and closes his eyes again. He's nearly asleep again when the other line picks up and a familiar voice greets him.
At the easy mention of his given name, Draco snaps his head towards him. His eyebrows are still taut together, grey eyes purely concerned. As if he thinks that something is definitely messing with Harry's head. Still, Harry takes advantage of his confusion.
Harry pulls away again, and Draco isn’t chasing him - he simply stays in his place with his eyes still closed. He opens them and blinks slowly, beautiful grey eyes finding Harry’s.
Draco does not reply. He simply stares at Harry for a few moments and looks down to his plate. They progress to finish their dinner in silence, and Harry drives him back to his place
Harry does not exactly know how to respond. He merely stares in fascination as Draco lifts his knees, places both his arms over, and rests his chin on top of them. All the while never betraying his gaze on Harry. He looks so soft. And Harry wants to run his hand through Draco's nearly white locks, fingers trailing on the side of his face after.
Draco rolls his eyes and crosses his arms in front of his chest. "I knew you had to want something," he says, leaning his back to his car. "Why do you want to know?"
"I would sell my soul for another minute with him." Harry whispers, and there's a shuffling noise. Lily hopes it's Aunt Hermione moving to hug her dad.
Her father was Draco Malfoy. He had died when she was only six years old. She doesn’t have memories about him as much as her brothers have. But sometimes, if she concentrated a little, she would see a blur of white. A tall figure smelling of faint jasmine. A drowning muffled voice of someone talking, soft, airy, and accentuated. She remembers the warmth he exuded, in a way that differs from her dad.
Lily would think that Albus would be furious, and by the looks of it, Scorpius and the other two also expected it. Instead, Albus only sighs and gives a sad look at Scorpius.
“Funny. I think the same.” Draco says. There’s a sound of clothes ruffling and then Harry feels a blanket covering his body.
Hermione places her hand on top of Harry's, and squeezes it gently. "It's alright if you're not ready to settle down, Harry."
"What does bother you exactly? That he's being all clingy and fussy or that he is doing it for me?" Draco arched a questioning eyebrow at him.
Please feel free to leave kudos, comments, feedback either in the comment section or through my social media accounts:
Harry smiled softly. "Not at all, it's already wrapped and you will have it on Christmas, so don't try to sneak in to see what it is, love" Harry warned lovingly and that made Draco laughed as he gripped Harry's arm with his own.
Draco glanced at him curiously still not completely removing his eyes from his reading Harry has been frustrated over little things recently and Draco has learned to let him tell him about them instead of asking.
I made a few correction on earlier chapter thanks to the amazing and helpful comments in the last chapter, I hope this makes the story flows naturally and also understandable.
Harry noticed the magic glow surrounding the dragon and immediately left it on the table in front of him. "I will take it," Harry said and place his card next to it for the clerk to check it.
So here we have this chapter who is the product of many hours of not only procrastination but intensive and exhausting research about the Ilvermorny History and windows shapes.
Harry's thoughts of Draco were interrupted when an item in a storefront caught his eyes and attention. The store sells antics and rare items, in the front was laying a crystal figurine of a dragon that inside it has the Draco constellation as a skeleton, Harry remembered Draco had told him that he once has a figurine like that, that Narcissa has gifted it to him and he was very fond to his mother gift but in a rage outburst Lucius decided to get rid of it, Draco never knew if he sold it or broke it but Draco resents his father for keeping him away of such an important gift.
When she returns to Vernon's house for the holiday, she's wearing that yellow dress Sirius has given her and a pair of old flats from Millicent Bulstrode (Gemini said she was trying to give them away because they had grown too small back in second year). In his bid for Harry to stay normal his face turns bright red like an ugly tomato and he hurls a few obscenities at her, but three days in Aunt Lorraine comes to pick her up and he hurls obscenities at her too.
Blinking warmly at the use of the pronoun, Harry finds a smile spreading across her face. She attributes the easy feeling to her good mood. "Of course you may. We're trans sisters!" Then she laughs weirdly, 'cause God that sounds weird when she says it aloud, but it's nice to say it to someone like herself. Oh, it feels good.
"They're twins, Albus and Scorpius," Harry says, then places a hand on Lily's shoulder. "This one's Lily Luna, the youngest."
"James," Harry says when James opens his mouth to respond, a hand on his shoulder. Her dad doesn't look at anyone, but he says, "It's fine. But we shouldn't talk about this in public."
He crowds Draco against the wall, holding his face with both hands as he tilts him upwards so he can kiss him deeper. He faintly thinks he’s hallucinating when he’s not even nearly as drunk as usual, because Draco’s legs are pressing against his hips and Draco’s hands’ placed upon his own like he’s encouraging Harry and trusting him to be in control.
Harry lights up at the face of the old lady and goes to greet her. The four of them exchange unsure looks at each other before awkwardly trailing behind him. They have finished the pleasantries, and the old lady tilts her head over Harry's shoulder to look at them.
Draco glances up to the visible strands of his hair and blows on them. "No, I quite like them this way."
Harry doesn't reply for a very long time. He traces the photo with a finger, and Lily catches sight of the golden ring on his ring finger. She remembers that he had never pulled it off even once.
Harry's eyes are kind, his lips set to a small, comforting smile. He seems put together, better than he had been yesterday. Lily nods. “Well, we weren’t particularly fond of each other during our school years.” His eyes start to fog, as if he’s reliving the memories as he speaks. “He was a snobbish prat. Typical spoiled pureblood kid. He didn’t like Ron and Hermione very much. so, we pretty much hated each other.”
"You didn't cope very well. I was afraid that you would only become worse," he says, then quietly, "a part of me also wants to be selfish. to keep a part of him for myself."
“Oh,” says James. “Don’t say things like that, Dad. I'm one sentence away from bawling till next week.”
Lily reaches out to place a hand on Harry's, he squeezes it in return. Seeing the distant look on Harry's face, they don't say anything else. At least, until James tells a story about one of his coworkers and it continues to Scorpius telling Harry that Albus had gotten him in trouble a couple of times despite being in different houses.
"I'm honored." Draco replies, huffing. His gaze flicks down to Theo's loose tie, and before he realises, he's already reaching out to grab them.
"We had wine at dinner before. I did," Harry says. "Your friend said he did, you must have had some too."
Draco blinks open, eyes immediately staring at the dark ceiling of his room. He turns his head to see the clock glaring back at him with the number eight. He turns the other way to see there is no sunlight escaping from his dark curtains.
Lily steps behind him, taking notice of the sound of people talking. She realises it comes from somewhere near Scorpius as they sit down on the floor together, must be one of Uncle George's inventions and Scorpius disillusioned it.
Which is to say, she expected the question even before she started her first year. Her family isn’t a very normal one, to be honest. Her dad, for one, is Harry Potter, the Chosen One. Her oldest brother, James Sirius, had been a well-known troublemaker at school, and now made his own name after joining the Aurors. And at the moment, the twins, Albus and Scorpius, are attending their last year. Not to mention her family is associated very closely to the Weasleys.
She remembers him coaxing her with chocolates when she was throwing a tantrum. She remembers him curling around her when she couldn't sleep so she could. She remembers him feeding her breakfast, and she insisted she also feed him food with her bare hands. She remembers him scolding her brothers when they picked on her, and the way he had brought all of them to an ice cream shop the next day. There is a faint memory, from the back of her head, that she had once found him crying in the arms of her dad. He hadn’t looked very good the next few days, but he still smiled at her as he hugged her when she cried because she thought that she did something wrong to make him angry.
"Harry," Harry repeats, astonished at how his heart starts beating fast when he hears Draco call him that. "I like it."
"You look different." Theo says, mimicking his pose of resting his chin on his hand. "You don't use gel anymore?"
"I can help you apparate, if we're going back home," James says softly to Harry. Harry nods, and stands to pay for the food.
Scorpius' pale complexion looks even more paler. He closes his eyes, tilting his head down. His blond hair, lighter than Lily's, falls onto his face.
"Oh, hush, love. You just broke my heart, I am at least entitled for a treat." He says, sipping the drink again.
"A photo of Father," he says. Then, almost guiltily, explains. "I stole it from one of the photo albums, when I returned for Christmas in first year. I think dad knows, but he lets me keep it."
Draco Malfoy is many things. He is smart, perceptive, diligent. It has not crossed Harry’s mind one bit that
Harry closes his eyes, lips disappearing into a thin line behind his beard. James looks odd, Lily thinks, and it clears up when he replies. "In a way," he says, quietly.
Lily wakes up alone in her room, feeling awfully cold and terribly lonely. Memories of the earlier morning comes flowing back, and she feels drained even after a long nap. She takes a shaky breath, holding back the tears that’s threatening to fall. She feels oddly hollow, but she doesn’t know what exactly she should be feeling. Her eyes catch the box she and the twins had taken from her dad’s bedroom yesterday, and she moves slowly over to them. She opens the last book they had gone through yesterday; a scrapbook Harry seems to especially made for their father. It consists of candid pictures of Father mostly alone, some with his friends, but none with Harry. Starting from what must be their eight year in Hogwarts, their graduation, the courting Harry seems to insist from the messy scrawls below every picture, their wedding, their long honeymoon.
His hand moves from where it rested on Draco's waist to touch his cheek, cold and smooth like porcelain. "You're very beautiful," he can't help saying, because it's true.
Draco is only looking at him, unmoving. A short hesitation; but Draco does not move away, so his hand makes contact with the side of Draco’s face as he surges forward and meet they do.
“It’s not an attempt to get you to stay,” Harry says calmly even though his heart is beating faster every minute. “It’s an attempt to get you to like me back.”
"He and I used to date–" Harry's face sours immediately, and Theo looks amused like it is his goal all along, the sodding
He sits beside Harry and offers him the glass and a pain reliever. “Here you are,” he says. He watches him gulp the medicine and the water patiently.
“He shouldn’t have fucking left!” Albus yells, red framing his eyes angrily. “He succeeded in keeping his family alive, he made a new family with the chosen one of anyone else! What more could he want?!”
Draco turns to look at him with wide eyes. Theo is bent forward because of his stupid tie, and they are awfully
Oh, Lily thinks, that’s good. She always feels so much better after Dad’s hugs. She peeks inside, enough to see her dad pulling her father to lay back down on their bed before Scorpius brings her up to his arms and retreats back to her room. He sleeps beside her that night.
“I,” Harry says dumbly. A waiter comes and places their orders on the table. He stays frozen as Draco thanks them and they step away. “What?”
“I want to learn how to love you properly,” he says. “Because I am, have always been for a long time already, in love with you.”
Ah, the reminder of The Sleeping Incident. Harry blinks, doesn't have the slightest idea how he should approach the matter. It's not like he's actually
"Why on our seventh year?" Harry whispers. "Not sixth, not eight. Seven is supposed to be good luck, perfection."
When Harry moves closer again, Draco lets out an undignified - utterly adorable - squeak, and Harry is suddenly kissing a cold palm. Unsurprisingly, Draco’s hands are smooth and perfect for all the work he does. Harry’s sure the man couldn’t be more perfect and feels his heart swells.
"Your eyes are rare," he blurts out. Draco blinks. To his horror, he hears himself add, "It's pretty."
Draco rolls his eyes. “Clearly, you’re attempting to woo someone. You must have taken me there for tasting. Now you have invited me for dinner; am I to assume it went well as you wish?”
Theo steps by the dark, awaiting car and opens the back seat. "Night, Mr. Potter. Pleasure meeting you." He says, then slinks inside without sparing a second.
Now, the kiss is gentle, lightly pressing his lips over Draco’s. It’s everything he’s expected from Draco. Soft and sweet. Harry would
Lily nods. Family was the first to think of you, the first to hold you, to love you, to teach you about how life works. It wouldn’t be so easy to throw all of the life you had built, thinking it was the correct way of living, in a short moment. To walk to the other side alone and unprotected, to leave your family behind, everything that you thought was true. To turn your back to the psychopath that holds his wand right on the head of your parents.
Draco looks at him; a sudden exciting, fluttering feeling he stomps down in his stomach. It almost feels like the missing feeling when he first saw Theo that day.
James is breathing heavily, still glaring even with tears threatening to fall. Lily doesn’t bother to hold back her tears, and she feels Scorpius pulling her to his arms.
Harry drives them to a small cosy restaurant that only serves Fish and Chips; he orders coke and Draco a lemon tea. It is nowhere near fancy as last time, but Draco doesn’t seem unfazed.
“Our rivalry went up to fifth year,” the light in Harry's eyes dims. “That summer, he took the mark. In sixth year, he looked like he had been forced to grow up in such a short time. He doesn’t pick up fights anymore, and he was silent, always detached from his friends. At the end of sixth year, the war starts. He doesn’t come back to school, and we’re officially on the run.”
Draco looks at him; Theo is gazing hopefully at him, but somehow manages to not look pathetically desperate. He had expected to feel familiar butterflies now that he's reuniting with the man he once thought he would spend the rest of his life with.
“Alright, alright!” Draco hisses, looking around in alarm. “We’re in the library, do remember that.”
Lily wakes up with a jolt, her tiny body shivering either from the cold air or the nightmare she had. It was scary, she had woken up alone. She couldn’t find Father even when she called for him, Daddy was nowhere to be found, or any of her brothers. She'd thought it was another prank from James and Albus, that they had somehow convinced their parents and the softhearted Scorpius to follow in and hide from her. But she had gone outside, and there was still nobody she could see. She’d cried and screamed and cried, and Father would have relented and come running to her. He would hold her and hug her and kiss her, telling her that he was sorry for scaring her. But Father hadn’t come. And she had been all alone until she woke up.
Lily turns to him, and blinks as if unperturbed. “He's still my favourite. Where did you leave him?”
“But it’s not--” Draco says, eyebrows furrowing. He seems to be struggling to reply, “It’s not that easy.”
Draco is still silent, though he’s staring at Harry with wide eyes and parted lips. Harry inhales, calming his loudly beating heart.
Theo laughs. Theodore Nott is an attractive man, has endless charms - happiness on him would only amplify. And Draco imagines people from nearby tables taking a second glance at them.
"Your parents are both so attractive." Hugo complains, and then hastily adds, "I would be jealous if my parents weren't my parents."
"Fuck," Harry curses. He looks at Draco, grey eyes sparkling and crystal tears at bay, his cheeks pink in contrast to his pale skin, lips red and wet and swollen
Harry must still be drunk, because he can’t seem to think of anything to say beside staring at Draco’s blond hair. He lets Draco lead him to sit on the sofa in the living room before disappearing further into his home only to come back with a glass of water, already shedding his coat.
When Draco - because Harry decides one day he wants to call him by his given name - sits down at the table beside the big window of the library, dumping his bag to the seat beside him and all the books he had picked on a neat pile, Harry slumps into the other seat beside him.
Scorpius is back at looking pale and weak, no hint of the previous hardness anywhere. He nods stiffly. “I was old enough to understand that he was not--” he stops. James nods at him anyway.
A hand covered with cold sweat touches his forehead, and sweeps his curls back. He looks up, still hovering on top of Draco, and this time he can see Draco's face clearly. His tear stricken cheeks, abused lips, his dark eyelashes.
"Well that wasn't awkward," James says. He had taken the seat next to Harry, Lily and the twins in front of them both. "I don't remember that old lady."
“No, I’m not,” Harry says as he hauls his bag to his arms and looks everywhere but Draco. He feels the heat on his cheeks and the sun is almost blinding him. “I'll see you in the eight years’ common room after dinner?”
“You’re not understanding.” James says, frowning at him. His face is turning red, noticeable even on his dark skin.
“I figured,” Draco says, setting his half bitten toast down and lifting his glass of water towards his lips. He seems like he wanted something else before thinking against it. Harry understands the way his eyes flit away from his gaze anyway.
Harry insists he will drive again on the way to his place. When they arrive, Harry meets Draco outside the passenger's side of the car.
“You don’t have to think of him every second of the day, Albus,” she says, patting her brother’s back gently. “I don't think he wants that for us.”
"What?" Draco whispers. Harry tilts his head, as if expecting an answer and this isn't some sort of hidden joke. Draco blinks and schools his expression, no longer looking in horror instead into something - he hopes - unimpressed. "Oh, it's all right."
"Ah, yes, yes," the old lady smiles. "He grows to look just like you." James offers a grin, albeit a little awkward at not remembering someone who seems to know him. She turns to the twins, and locks her gaze on Scorpius. "Oh," she says.
"Killed someone?" Albus jokes. "What? He said Father didn't turn out to be evil after all," he says, when lily nudges him with her elbow.
for it - he’s wrong. Draco’s pliant and soft in the right places, kissing back with the right amount of power but he’s not trying to
They do scram. And instead of cleaning and settling down for the next two weeks, the three of them sneak into their dad's bedroom and drag a box full of memories to Lily's room.
“I would know what’s easy and what not,” Harry says, snorting lightly. When Draco turns his head away, Harry hastily says, “Sorry, sorry. I just meant that we went through a war, what could be harder than that?”
Harry kisses him, messy and wet, spit everywhere but he's never been more aroused. The last few moments in their high are brutal, and Draco can't seem to focus on anything except the harsh but welcoming feeling on where they're joined. He presses his head back, his hair spread like a halo lighting up on the Gryffindor red sheets.
Harry pumps his fist on the air, then abruptly stops. He can feel himself sweating as he sees Draco frowning at him from the corner of his eyes. Harry tugs his sleeve from the arm that's still in the air like it's what he was doing all along, and reaches for the rear-view mirror to adjust it.
Albus, in a moment of rarity, reaches for her hand. Then she feels a movement from her other side, though she refuses to turn if it was Scorpius' disappointed face looking at her.
Draco doesn't bother to open his eyes, blindly reaching his nightstand to put his phone there. In a minute, he falls into a slumber again.
The shop doesn't really offer extravagant dishes, the cook was a French man in his fifties. It dawns on Lily that it seems to be an old family business.
So he tucks his chin on Draco's head, breathing in the vanilla shampoo Draco must use, and feels his heartbeat calm down.
The second time he wakes up, it's to someone pulling his blanket down and opening his blackout curtains at the same time.
"Say it," Harry says. He himself is panting, but he feels like he could take the whole world down at the moment. He still moves, pushing in and pulling out agonisingly slow that it breaks Draco little by little. He wants to wreck Draco, ruin all the walls and have him raw. "Say my name."
"Harry?" He says without looking up from the tablet. "It's about dinner with the President of Orion Group. He's not feeling well and would like to reschedule."
"Pansy did," Blaise says rather cheerfully. "She said you were dying so I thought she would probably need some help with your corpse."
Lily realises with a pang that they weren't particularly close with each other after she entered first year, leaving their dad alone with a memory of what once was a perfect family. She exchanges a look with Scorpius and Albus; Scorpius grimaces, and Albus thins his lips.
Harry pauses just as he’s about to press. He didn’t exactly plan this. What if Draco really feels uncomfortable? Draco abruptly asked for a day off yesterday, he probably wants a day to think for himself. It is not polite for him to demand company on his day off, is it?
Draco groans, and blinks his eyes open when a warm hand presses over his forehead. Pansy is sitting on his bed beside him, dark eyes looking at him with concern. Blaise comes and drops to the other side of his bed.
He shakes his head. "No, only you," he says, "All my secretaries have never stayed more than two months. Well, before you."
Feeling bold as adrenaline comes pumping, Harry slowly moves closer. Draco is so still in his seat, unmoving. Harry keeps moving until he can feel Draco’s breath, and Draco is only staring at him with wide eyes. Harry flicks his gaze to Draco’s lips, pink and soft and inviting. He flickers back to look back at Draco, and freezes when he sees hopeful grey eyes. Something about them also seems sad and Harry doesn’t understand.
Harry laughs, “Yes.” Then he continues, “His way of showing his dislike of me was very creative, you see. Once in fourth year, he made pins that stated ‘Potter Stinks’ for nearly all of Hogwarts to wear, and no one can’t break down the charms he used. Every time someone tried to reverse it, the insults would turn nastier.” He pauses. “He's damn brilliant.”
Somehow, as he steps inside his bathroom and meets his own reflection, an image of a messy haired man with captivating green eyes appears in his mind. Draco shakes his head almost immediately, and sighs pitifully to his own.
Albus cuts in, "She meant about Father." And then it's as if the whole world heard him and collectively paused.
Then she hears Father shout something inside, and Scorpius wraps his arms around her. Daddy seems to be reasoning something. Sometimes Father gets really upset when she cries, and then Daddy would come to them and calmly give them warm hugs. Father always looked better afterwards, and she would already be smiling in her dad’s arms.
"I don't think I can do this anymore though," Draco admits quietly. "Even women on average only give birth to two children at most." Then he pauses, "I don't know about Mrs. Weasley. but I am still a man after all, even with magic."
Harry huffs, glancing at the sleeping three children on the sofa in the room, and sits on the side of Draco's bed. He softens, reaching a hand to push hair strands behind Draco's ear. "How do you feel?"
“What?” Lily says, almost a reflex. “Oh, is it about the brothers thing? Of course I love you three equally, it’s just that--”
She likes that photo of Father. She'd like to keep it. her fingers hover above the page for a moment, hesitating. She rips the photo off the page anyway. She closes the book and the box, slips the photo into her pocket, and steps out of her room.
On the other hand, Harry also wants to kiss him; a mix of lips gently pressing against each other, and hungry and thoroughly messy. So that’s what he does.
It happens in a rush. He nearly runs out of his office, pacing impatiently in the elevator, and surprises the people waiting for the elevator when it reaches the basement and he barrels out. The next thing he knows, he’s leaning against his car outside Draco’s flat with Draco’s contact under his thumb.
“I'm sorry,” she hears Father say. He sounds like he’s crying. She wants to run inside to hug him and kiss him, because that’s what Father always does when she’s been crying. “You’re always so good to me, and yet all I give you is--”
Harry very nearly drops his phone as he snaps his neck towards the voice. On his right, the back of his car, Draco stands with perfect posture looking at him questioningly. He’s wearing a black turtleneck and slacks, also black oxfords and a slightly lighter shade coat. He’s looking exactly as Harry imagined him to be on a casual day - how Draco prefers his ‘casual wear’ when he’s not working. His platinum hair falls artfully over his forehead, blown by the cold wind, and he’s not wearing glasses. He looks effortlessly, utterly beautiful. It’s unfair.
She flips the photo to see a messy scrawl of handwriting on the back of it. It's Dad's, she realises.
She doesn't hear anything anymore, and it might be because she's crying so hard, or Scorpius had cancelled the charm he used. Scorpius picks her up and leads them back to her room. He sits her down on her bed, and he sits down himself on the floor beside her legs. Lily pulls out the picture she ripped from the scrapbook. Her vision is blurry and she can't see anything except the green background of Hogwarts' courtyard.
When the table clears, she stands to tidy her own things. The person from before slumps on the seat next to her.
Harry's voice is so broken and sad and Lily can't stop her tears. Because listening to her dad, Harry potter whom people worshipped, the Chosen One who defeated the dark lord over and over again and once and for all. The strong and tall, warm and kind, and he's been through so much. It sounds so raw and honest and Lily doesn't think there's anything more heartbreaking than this.
"I woke up early and decided to walk to work, you see. And then I passed this florist just opening up their store for the day. The roses are very fresh, don't you think? Beautiful. So I thought that this would make your desk more… lively." Harry says - not rambles.
They are now sitting down at the rooftop of a French Michelin-starred restaurant on a skyscraper tower. With candles between them and a live jazz performance.
Harry stands up and offers his hand out towards Draco. "Let's go then, the reservation's at six. I'll drive."
Hermione rolls her eyes as Ron takes a seat between Harry and her, placing three pints of beer on the small, square shaped table.
After a moment of silence, Lily conflicted between straightforwardly asking what happened seven years ago or try asking for another memory, it is Albus who speaks.
"Are you, really?" Harry mumbles. He's so very close to Draco and it's dark, the low light from the streetlight a few meters away highlights the elegant line of Draco's face. The shadow of his eyelashes, the glow below his cheekbones, warm and bright grey eyes that does not remind Harry of the moon. Because the moon is grey and bright and lonely, so far away and cold. Draco is warm and near.
“Harry..” Draco says, nearly inaudible. His eyes are painted in grief, and it is painful to look at.
“I’m not asking you to return my feelings if you do not.” Harry whispers. “All I ask of you is to give me a chance; but, one word from you, and I won’t ask of anything again.”
(If she had looked into the corner of the watching crowd, she would have seen Gemini Malfoy trying her hardest not to look, then also staring down at her bust, which has remained rather flat. She'll grouse, go back to pretending she's indifferent, even. At least Harry isn't injured this time, she'll think.)
"Likely story, Harriet." The arm on her back tightens uncomfortably so. "Even if you got selected unwillingly, you should have backed off and helped Cedric in taking the lead. He's one of the few people who win Hufflepuff respect among you lot. You should have let him succeed. But you steal his thunder in newspaper articles, ace every challenge, stupid ribbon braids and all. Looks like pigs' tails, honestly. Makes me want to pull them out."
He continues looking at her incredulously like she’s grown a second head. “Well, Potter? On with it! Use the darned things.”
She must have changed her body wash because now she smells like meringue. Harry becomes acutely aware of the sweat trickling down her nape and wipes it away with the back of her hand.
It will stay there, and it burns so brightly she fears it'll scald her. It may develop into something more, even.
Gemini, flustered, brushes a strand of blond hair off her forehead. She stoops down to tuck her trunk under the bed. "I didn't ever apologise for the things I did. I shouldn't have taken you for granted. I'm sorry."
"Oh, so we're going by first names now. Alright, I can do with that," Malfoy says. She shuts the book and places it on her lap, attention fully concentrating on Harry now. "Haven't you heard that--"
"How was I supposed to tell you? If you had any semblance of common sense you'd know, idiot," she mumbles. She hears Gemini sharply take a breath, then the tell-tale patter of her heeled shoes clacking out of the room follows.
"I look really pretty," says Harry, admiring her reflection. She doesn't even know she could look this nice. For once her hair texture works in her favour, the ends curling up neatly under her ears.
Although Gemini wants to know what Harry wants to say, she doesn't pressure her to say it aloud. "If it helps, I miss you loads. Don't smile! I'll say it once, I won't say it again."
"Well he must have broken into the wrong dorm because he found Ron instead," Harry huffs indignantly. "Have you seen him? He's been twisting the tale in like, ten different directions!"
Immediately she swoops down to help pick up the items that had taken a tumble. Although he was being a pain in the ass, as usual, she was still in the wrong and ought to right it first before spitting out any insults. It was a piece of advice Professor McGonagall had given her the last time she had a run-in with Malfoy.
"Ron can go fuck himself! If he was my friend why didn't he believe me? The least he could do was to trust me. I didn't put my name in the goblet," she spits. "You guys both know how much I hate the attention. And yet!"
Amid the swirl of dancing bodies, Gemini blooms like a rose among thorns. Plenty of girls are wearing gowns in brighter colours, but she is clothed in pure white. The halter top neckline shows off the necklace with a voice modification charm that Harry had given her. As everyone else spins, she follows, blond hair fluttering like a shawl behind her.
She tries, to the best of her ability, to imagine him in the same shoes as her. And it's difficult because prior to this all she's done is hate his guts. Maybe he too tried on his mother's heels and strutted through the house with the loveliest, most exhilarating feeling; maybe he tried to grow out his hair while ignoring his relatives' adamant protests like Harry has.
There's a series of small flat gems flanking Gemini's eyes in pinks and purples, highlighting the flecks in her grey eyes. Probably stuck on by lash glue. Unable to look away, both of their gazes continue to meet, only muscle memory carrying their dance.
Lorraine was hesitant. Harry could tell. She lived in the middle of the town square, flat cosy and tucked into a corner. It wasn’t a bad place. Between inquiries regarding her presence in the city, she answers an important question that sets off the catalyst for change.
Her new roommates take to her kindly. Thankfully, they decide to leave their bombardment of questions for the day after. To say that her best friend is delighted that Harry is joining them is an understatement. That's partially why Harry is so happy to join them.
After the dance, Harry finds herself sitting at the side with Ron. Fred has set off to conduct some prank. He tells her he's planning to spike the punch with a concoction that will turn your skin green. She doesn't mind too much, because she doesn't truly enjoy dancing anyway. Too many eyes.
She steals Ron and Hermione from the Great Hall once they arrive. For the last few hours, all she could do was make up a plan on how to tell them, coming up with possible answers to any of their questions. They understand as much as a bunch of twelve-year-olds can. Harry doesn’t understand it much herself, but she’s still the same person, she’s still Harry.
Harry borrows a silver plate from Lavender and lights it up. When it begins to melt, it smells like cotton candy– sweet and sharp, just like a certain girl she knows.
“Eh? Okay,” she says, sitting on a desk to make herself feel more comfortable. “Malfoy is a horrible, nasty git. I wish she wasn’t such an annoying bastard. Honestly, she drives me mad.”
Finally, when the time for the Yule Ball rolls around, they're all ready, starting to pour out of the common room. Fred's already standing by the fireplace. He smiles at the sight of Harry and offers his arm in an exaggerated gentlemanly way. "Milady," he quips, austere. Both of them giggle.
It’s only after Quidditch practise that she realises she's left her favourite pink scrunchie behind in the changing room. It’s no big deal, and honestly, it’s a bit of a pain to run back there to get it. She could pick it up during the next match, but if the rest of her teammates see it –they’re all boys, mind you– she doesn’t have the heart to bluster out a half-hearted lie.
Gemini lets her peer into the mirror. The cosmetics are expertly applied, softening all the harsher edges of her face. A deeper red colour starts from the middle of her lips, fading out, making her lips look like they're bitten. She tilts Harry's chin to face her, taking an approving glance.
The dungeons are even colder than the rest of the castle. Her dress is thin, so she barely suppresses a shiver. Besides themselves, the Slytherin dorms are barren. Gemini places her trunk onto the bed as Harry looks around, taken in by the place. It's oddly intimate when they're in here alone.
Snot was dribbling down her nose when she saw her. At first, she begins –"Sir…" when her mind finally remembers the stories about children being kidnapped in the streets. She only managed to sneak back a few steps before the older woman reassured her.
She has the half a mind to tell him everything that just happened. But she remembers how she is now, keeping her gender a secret from the rest of the school. She wouldn't feel very nice if anyone outed her. "It's a secret. Sorry, I can't tell you," she says as casually as possible.
The rest of the girls are dressed up wonderfully, of course; all their dates are lucky to have them, she thinks. She requires extra assistance to pull up the zipper on her dress and she finds herself feeling very thankful she's in the girls' dorm.
There are so many things out there to get her. Even in the infirmary, she knows she's not entirely safe.
She'd thought crushing badly on someone would mean that she would know exactly why. But this thing she has for Gemini… she can't explain it. It just
"You should have placed a lightening charm on this before you moved it, Harry. Let me help with that as a housewarming gift," she scolds, taking it from her. "All ready to go?"
"It's the most effective means of communication," she says like it's nothing. "Anyone in the wizarding world who can read will read it, trust me. Everyone always wants to know what's going on in the pureblood families. I'd want to bring the news myself rather than some other nasty schoolmate." She stares at Harry like she's looking for approval. When did start she doing that?
They break apart from the hug, still close as ever. Harry kisses her softly, a taste of salty tears stinging each other. "You said I could get another kiss when I made it out of that maze," she says warmly.
"I don't mind taking you as my date, Gem. Show the boys what they're missing. We can spice up your makeup a bit. All the other girls would be wearing blue or green eyeshadow, anyways. Then you'll come in, like a snake invading a pack of mice! Alright, that sounded better when I didn't say it aloud."
For this task, she chooses to wear a thin long-sleeved swimsuit with board shorts. When she emerges from the water, carrying Fleur's sister and Ron in tow, she's soaked to the bone and her clothes cling onto her skin. Fleur kisses her on the cheek as a thank you, Harry blustering afterwards, then she gets a towel to dry herself.
Harry's eyes nearly pop out of their sockets. "What?" She can't fathom giving anything to that newspaper willingly, knowing how they twist and turn things. "Why would you do that?"
A trickle of students is coming in through the front entrance of Hogwarts, returning from the holiday. Harry is dressed in the green dress, a black wool coat thrown over it all, hair plaited delicately to make a half-up half-down hairstyle courtesy of Professor McGonagall. She feels a few unabashed eyes falling upon her, but they quickly turn away.
"Gosh, this is complicated," Malfoy says after a long beat. "Picking a name can be really difficult."
Among Harry's usual pile of presents, there's an extra one wrapped with an expensive-looking wrapping paper she doesn't recognise, along with two other discreet looking ones. Mrs Weasley's sweater is knitted with little white flowers surrounding its borders. Ron and her spend a good lot of time fawning over her new firebolt, but when she tears the wrapping off the odd gift out, this time Hermione is the one to squeal.
She's been hellishly unreasonable. Well, she could attribute it to her mood swings, a side effect of estrogen, but inwardly she already knows why. Ever since she had come out, she was subjected to multiple nasty rumours. Nothing was anything scarring to her reputation, but they hurt. A lot. Her worst fears came true. It seemed that since she chose to be transgender, just to be even more of a special snowflake. As if! This was the way she was. She had been on edge the past few weeks, and Ron happened to set her off.
"I don't fit this at all," Malfoy says, readjusting the skirt for the nth time. The hair growing charm only reaches her shoulders until it becomes so dangerously thin Harry fears her hair will snap. For the first time, she realises how silky smooth hair can have its disadvantages.
The day before the last of the Triwizard tournament, Gemini decides it isn't worth it to listen to any more listless chatter about the stupid competition. She only ever paid attention to any of the speculations because of Harry.
She stops in her tracks. Her best friend catches up with her in the next few seconds. She lets Hermione get an eyeful of the frustration etched so deeply into her face, then shoots her a poisonous glare again. She knows she's being childish but she continues with her tirade.
"Ugh, feelings," says Albus. "It has something to do with age, I'm afraid. You're getting old, James."
to be uncomfortable. And yet, he buries his nose in Draco’s soft hair, not hearing the other's sharp intake of breath. He feels whole. He feels content.
"That is unnecessary," Draco mutters. "I didn't think you were the kind of person to enjoy places like this."
"I'm sorry I crashed your day off," Harry says, not truly feeling guilty. Having a bad hangover and then waking up to an
The drive is silent but comfortable, save low volume nightly jazz love songs from the radio and the gentle blow of the cold wind.
Lily jolts, and turns to Scorpius. She absently notices that Harry and James snap their heads towards him too. She frowns, “Scorp..”
Harry bites back another dirty response and laughs instead. "Sorry, sorry. Come here," he opens his arms and Draco stares at him suspiciously before burying his face back into Harry's neck. "You're really cute when you get shy."
The next morning, just as Draco walks out of his flat with his car key in hand, Harry's already standing outside leaning on his car. He flashes Draco his own car key with a cheeky grin. He opens the passenger's door and gestures for him to go in. He expects a sarcastic remark, but Draco only spares him a suspicious look before complying without opening an inch of his lips.
"How's school?" her dad asks, as soon as they arrive home. He shed his coat, walking to the kitchen as if he didn't really expect an answer.
"No," Draco admits. He's staring back at Harry and it's hypnotizing. The dark, deep hole seems to pull Harry closer and closer and falling, swirling mercury that looks magical.
“James,” Scorpius pleads. Lily doesn’t want to look at what expression Harry has on his face, and doesn't want to wonder why he’s silent while two of his sons are fighting and his other two kids are crying. She doesn’t want to see if their dad is only looking at them passively, that grieving and sad look back on his face as he laments about the loss of the love of his life. She hides her face on Scorpius’ jumper, crying helplessly. She wants this to end. She wants this to end now.
"Yes," Theo agrees. Then more softly, he says, "You were beautiful the day I last saw you. This is.. you look more
“But that’s it,” Harry says, voice grave and so, so sad. His green eyes are terrible to look at, and Lily looks away. “Depression isn’t something one could easily understand.”
James avoids eye contact with the three of them. As he walks outside the shop after giving a nod at the old lady, they follow behind him.
As it had always been, the five of them cram into one compartment together. She sits beside Scorpius, and halfway through the journey, rests her head on his lap and her legs on Albus'.
“I don’t know,” Draco says, a strange look flashes and goes away in an instant. “That place was for couples.”
At this Draco looks up, tilting his head in confusion. "I never thought of that. But it's not like we're fond of each other anyway, isn't that 'good luck'?"
"We went here once when you were, what, six months old?" he says again. The next second, his smile dims. "Now that I think of it, why didn't we ever go here as a family?"
Pansy Parkinson's trunk is open and they take the opportunity to run their little fashion show for the day, Malfoy as the sole model.
By herself, she hogs the mirror in the bathroom. She dangles her wand over her face as she casts a few glamours she's learnt to do, adjusting her appearance just for a few hours. She makes her hair less frizzy. A hair-lengthening charm usually makes the strands more brittle, but her hair is annoyingly thick so it doesn't make a difference to her.
The elegant script was written in a hurry. For a moment Harry thought about whether she should stand him up. She had nothing to gain from this meeting, after all. She almost ends up rejecting, but she is reminded of her burning questions from yesterday, so she heads down to the classroom after having a heaping portion of pasta and her usual dosage of hormone blockers.
"Oh," she hears herself say in a tiny voice. Is Gemini an angel who has descended to earth, or something? Merlin's saggy tits, what the hell?
If she could she would just stay here forever until the world forgot who she was. If only she could do that, she thinks.
As she doesn’t pay attention to her surroundings, she collides into someone. When she looks up, her eyes meet Malfoy’s, his striking grey eyes a feature of his that she’s come to associate with cruel, childish taunts. She’s too flustered to say anything. The bag he was holding slips out of his hands and its contents spill out onto the floor.
Among the students, she tries to spot a head of silver blond hair, seeing none. It feels like it's been hours before she sees Gemini.
When she turns around to see Malfoy, the blond girl looks like she's mixed between wanting to laugh and wanting to cry. "Potter, you're going to make me lose it someday I swear," she mutters, but there's an exasperated fondness softening her words that makes Harry's breath catch in her chest, and Malfoy leans forward to tuck a stray lock of hair behind Harry's ear.
There’s an envelope in Gemini’s familiar handwriting. While trying to open it she accidentally cuts herself on a sharp edge. There’s a pair of clip-on rose gold earrings inside which magically stick themselves to any part of her ear. She sticks it on her cartilage before she starts reading.
Harry imagines Gemini rolling her eyes. "Boys? They'll all just ask me weird questions. Like about my dick, or some other weird thing they can ask for shits and giggles. The rest of the boys which are, well, okay I suppose, already all have dates."
Some boys are looking in her direction. She doesn't have the grace to blush, so she just crosses her arms, feeling very satisfied. The afternoon the day prior comes back to her and she decides the word she learnt would be perfect to use now. "I'm gratified!" she cries.
Caught off-guard, Gemini frowns even more deeply, forming unpleasant lines on her face. "I just wanted to wish you good luck with your next challenge. That's all."
Among the crowd, she tries her best to crane her neck out to see Harry with the participants. They’ve been waiting for a good thirty minutes already. Everyone had murmured endlessly when they had seen the dragons. What the hell were the organisers thinking? As much as Gemini hoped that Harry wouldn’t get mauled, the possibility is becoming increasingly more potent as time passes.
