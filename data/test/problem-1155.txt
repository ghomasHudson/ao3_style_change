Didn’t much matter now of course. She couldn’t…Stay with him, knowing that he had bedded another woman. That he’d been doing it for who knows how long.

She’d been offered, a few times over the years, another position. She was,

to enforce them! The society as a whole are in absolute shambles!” she went off again. Narcissa glanced at her husband to see how he was taking this sort of insult to their entire society but he was only watching Ms. Mulberry with entranced eyes. And in a public venue with his wife right in front of him no less! She glanced around. Oh, she just knew if Lady Greengrass or another member of the Black family saw there would be no end of gossip that would just ruin her social standing. She would be a laughingstock!
“Can we go back to the Dark Lord

“You seem quite open about yourself, Ms. Mulberry.” Narcissa noted with glinting eyes. The woman laughed at her.

to stop that abuse. All because of something you had no control over, could have no control over and only in your second year of schooling. Oh, the students may have forgiven you, but have they ever really apologized for the cruel things they said to you? For the hexes and spells sent your way that the staff turned a blind eye to? And then trapped down in the Chamber with a shade of a boy, a young girl’s life in your young hands as though you should have had to do it all yourself? And your friend’s sister nonetheless against a centuries old beast who hungered after so long asleep. Why had it turned into a twelve year old having to save an eleven year old girl after months of dangerous petrifications? Why did you have to protect the stone, why did you have to be put in the direct line of danger two years in a row?
“Yes, it’s quite ticklish isn’t it? I myself am not very fond of being tickled. Very uncomfortable, that. You’ll be asleep soon though, don’t worry. And all will be well when you wake.”
“I do.” he heard his sister and looked forward again. “I like learning about them. I like seeing them even more.” she turned her head as she led them to a slim spiral staircase. “Is it true there are thestrals on the grounds?”
“I like the ritual.” Harry put in her own thoughts.
The train ride was spent in a compartment that she charmed and spelled to the teeth, only letting Ron and Nev in as they lounged together.
That was a fair statement to make, Narcissa agreed. Lucius, she and Draco had to use a fair amount when planning to be outdoors for any real length of time. While Ms. Mulberry seemed like she could simply lay out in any tropical climate entirely nude and turn a golden bronze hue to her light brown skin. She briefly wondered if that was something the small woman actually did or not.
And then shared snickers and giggles with him over the books about her.
Jasper and their mum were too busy focusing on Jasmine to notice the way James’ features tightened. Soon enough there was tea and Jasper relocated himself after a few moments of indecision when Jasmine had the paper because really, he wanted to see if she could really find any of the words. Their parents watched fondly and that’s how their first afternoon as a family panned out.
He murmured quiet little nothings as he moved closer, using both hands to hold her and brush away her tears as she cried and wailed, now latching onto him because he was
a crybaby, Willa was too eager to chase around the boys and threaten them with cooties to play with. Carla was three years older and snubbed them all, Petey was a know-it-all Carla’s age, Gracie was too controlling and no fun at all, and Blake ate a dirt-pie because Cindy asked him too. Anyone else was a ‘teenager’ and wouldn’t be caught hanging around with them unless they were specifically put on babysitting duty.
“Hm? Oh no, I’m going to tell them and it will only be in the official conference room that I’m supposed to be in. I just find that people tend to get a little anxious when I’m sitting there and representing the looming threat of Confederation takeover or some such rot. Or they just don’t trust me because I’m from the Confederation. My apparent presence makes going about daily work impossible.” she huffed. “It’s a wonder anything gets done if they’re so easily distracted.”
She stared down at her arm emptily, green eyes hard. Her grim gaze moved to the scars caressing her wheatish skin. The thin ones from where kelpie had wrapped their fingers around her in the lake when she'd been shoved in during First Year. The small crescent one curving the edge of her jaw from when she was tripped and one from a Gryffindor's hex, another wrapped around her ankle. Yet another two from her own Housemates, all Second Year. From Third Year, the scar on her knee from being shoved down the moving staircases and managing to hit something sharp. The huge jagged claw marks on her shoulder from some beast out in the Forbidden Forest when she'd been chased there and forced to spend the night before the centaurs had found her- mostly Firenze. She'd had to go to St. Mungos for a little over two weeks for that. Fourth Year saw a small burn scar on the side of her thigh just under the crease of her arse, curse-purpled skin that refused to lighten. And her Fifth Year had her own small writing printed as a scar on her right hand, 'I must not tell lies.' from the detentions she was ordered to.

“I- there weren’t as many photos to show them as any of us would have liked but there were- there were always the stories,” he croaked and she couldn’t look at him, she just couldn’t do it. “You- you left so much of your things and there were memories there too to show them,” he went on babbling desperately. “They’ve known you their whole lives,” he choked.
“Just those general locations.” she demurred slightly before straightening up. “But say, don't you think it's just amazing? I've been reading about some of the charms and spells and even
There was nothing she could say to that, what with her voice gone. She could still scowl at him hatefully, as she always did when he brought that up. He didn’t sound arrogant when he said they wouldn’t find her, never did. Stated it like one might say that Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald; like it was an irrefutable fact. She wished for the sharp, ruthless man she’d been sure Lucius Malfoy was. It would be better than this totally calm, almost serene man. She knew he wasn’t the only one in on her heist, but he was the only one she saw, the only one to interact with her. He
She hummed, swinging her legs back and forth as she read the large book set up on her lap. Her cousin and his aunt trembled where they sat in the room, Dudley still crying. Of course- losing both Vernon and Petunia must have been a huge shock to the two of them. She glanced at them idly before returning her attention to the much more fascinating book. It would take a few days before Aunt Marge would explode on her about her nonchalant attitude to their deaths and to raise her hand to the small girl. It would take another few days for the woman to wake up- the doctors had said she'd collapsed from grief and exhaustion but she knew better- she knew better, she did!
he heard, a hand on his forehead, before he was sucked back into that fucking cupboard, that freezing lake, that horrible cave.
“I was a kid. I changed my mind.” He wanted to explain why he’d scoffed, how his life had
“Hey,” Harry responded, not sure if Draco could tolerate outright kindness, or if he was better off saying something along the lines of
And they sat down together, Hermione gathering tea while Ron placed an army of leftovers in front of Harry. He loved them so much. Ron spun the story of Hannah’s casual question into a twenty-minute adventure, Hermione laughing at all the right parts, her hair bouncing against her head. Their laughter was everything to him, more precious than gold. They always accepted any shit he dumped on them, worrying for Harry at each step. He owed them the truth, but he wasn’t sure what that was yet. He thought about Draco’s pale face, saying
Harry paused, still holding the bottle aloft. He wasn’t sure if Draco had meant to say that out loud. It seemed like he had been holding it in, only able to wait for the bottle to be open and not for them to be properly drunk.
“I’ll stay here,” he said, and they nodded, and Hermione kissed his cheek, and Harry promised to meet them at next Friday’s Weasley dinner if he didn’t see them sooner.
“What, according to the Ministry?” Draco snorted, sounding much more like his normal self. “They’re stupider than you are.”
“Give us a moment, Harry,” Shacklebolt added, more quietly now that it was just the three of them. “I’d like to speak to young Malfoy.”
“But I’m good at Potions, and something about Snape, and blah blah blah?” Draco glanced at Harry, smiled to himself at whatever he saw, and kept plucking. He dropped each thin ribbon of leaf into his basket, and they twirled through the air before landing. “You can be good at something and not like it, you know. Severus was a good teacher.”
“I agree.” Pansy blinked, and Harry felt momentarily smug. Then he sighed. “Look, we both want the same thing, right? Leave it alone and we can work together just fine.”
“You wish.” They kept walking. Draco lit the tip of his wand, wordlessly lifting it to brighten the space around them both.
So “Fuck you,” he managed, eyes suddenly smarting. “Just get eaten by the house, then. You deserve each other.”
He’d ordered movies too, every film he’d never been able to see as a kid now a sleek VHS, and when he began building the cheap bookshelf he’d gotten to store them in, the dining room table fell to pieces behind him. Harry was a little confused until the wood started twitching, clearly wanting to be used in the place of fibreboard. After that it seemed like the Manor knew what he wanted, and by dinnertime Harry was curled up with a bowl of penne alla vodka, watching The Goonies.
, you know? I never thought much about who you’d end up with, if not Ginny. Hopefully someone who doesn’t make you think of the war, and how could Malfoy be anything but facing that shit constantly? It just seems intense, I guess, and too potentially explosive. I can see where you two have some weird parallels, but then, so do we, right? And we’re not dating, no offense.”
Draco screwed his eyes shut, irritation and fear both plain as day across his pointy face. “I love you too, alright, Potter? I shan’t say it regularly.”
Harry glanced around before following her back into the room where Ron and Hermione were finally wrapping up. The heavy console table, loaded down with ancient silver that he’d gotten filthy polishing. The rug that had tripped him more than once. The hanging tapestry that had hidden Draco away like an Invisibility Cloak. He couldn’t imagine having to leave this place. Everyone would be ready to act soon, and Harry would have to be a crucial part of the plan, no matter how he was starting to feel about it.
They passed through the dining hall where Charity Burbage had died. They passed the patch of floor where Hermione had been marked. They passed the doors of  a library, filled with books that seemed to pulse with bad intentions. But no crystal goblets had been left on the tables, no doors had been left half-opened. Whenever they had arrested Narcissa, they had come quietly, it seemed. As grim as the manor was, it was in better condition than Harry had expected. It was in better condition than Grimmauld, actually, and he felt a little guilty claiming the museum-like place to himself when Ron and Hermione would likely be spelling old Hippogriff shit off their sheets that night.
It was hard to find a rhythm, but he didn’t need much. Fucking Draco Malfoy was overwhelming even in the short, shallow thrusts that he could manage around the grip he had Draco’s dick in, jerking it as slowly as he rocked back and forth. Draco went up on his elbows to watch, and Harry couldn’t help but steal a kiss, though he bent in half to take it, and Draco bit down painfully on his lip when he did.
“Whatever you can dig up, I guess.”
The next day Harry Apparated to Grimmauld before sunrise and insisted on accompanying Hermione to a breakfast that he also had to insist on. He steeled himself with love for her and nodded through an hour’s nervous rambling about Arithmancy, before picking up another pair of coffees to go and Apparating back to the Manor, hands full. He left a warming charm on one cup in the kitchen and dropped some food for the koi before opening the huge front doors to let the birds out, following them onto the lawn with his own cooling cup in hand.
“He’ll be fine, Hermione, don’t worry,” Ron said, but Harry was staring at the paper.
“He looks like shit,” Ron said in a hushed voice, turning to Harry while rubbing his jaw. “He needs to see a Mediwizard, my mum would have kittens over how thin he’s gotten.”
“I did actually use those,” Harry admitted, grinning when he made Draco snort.
Pansy looked strange in her Auror’s robes, the scarlet seemingly unnatural after years of seeing her in Slytherin green. Harry had forgotten, or never noticed, how beautiful her delicate features were, the upturned nose pixielike now that he saw it again. She was holding Draco tight, and the fierce love that was obvious between them made Harry almost forgive her for everything.
Draco laughed out loud at that. Harry was surprised that it hurt his feelings, and he pulled an elaborate frown at Draco when he stopped. “Sorry,” Draco said, smiling again now. He seemed genuinely amused. “I do.”
How could he want to be anywhere else, now?
? He was certainly the one dealing with it.
It was a last night, in a lot of ways, for a lot of things. Everyone else seemed eager to make it count, but dread was starting to fill up in Harry’s belly. He knew he was betraying Draco by bringing people into their home. Draco’s home. All weekend his secret anger had simmered alongside a sour sense of rejection, keeping him from calling it off. But now he wondered what would have happened if he’d gone back alone.
With his ear to the wall, the pads of his fingers feeding questioning tendrils of magic into the wallpapered wood, Harry listened for a long minute. No sense of Draco inside, but that didn’t mean anything. Where would he have gone?
... Peeves had left paths of destruction across the school, but now it was only Harry making a mess.
Why was he so afraid to have anything good? Why did he have to ruin everything the moment he had the tentative approval of his friends, as soon as Draco wanted him too, in whatever capacity?
They rescued their food from the poor deliveryman — who looked very surprised to see them pop out of the “abandoned” house at Grimmauld — and got into Ron and Hermione’s bed to eat it.
“Us who?” Harry rounded the door to find Draco sitting at the desk. His broom was on the desk in front of him, surrounded by the brushes and polishes of a full sportsman’s set. The air smelled oily and rich, pungent in a way that never failed to make Harry’s mouth water. Draco’s hair was pushed back, the fine blond strands a tangled swoop. It put Harry strongly in mind of a pony’s fetlock, and he bit back a smile that was mostly relief.
“I’m not surprised,” he drawled, voice thick again, and Harry didn’t stop to think about what he wasn’t saying.
“Why doesn’t anyone Floo call anymore?” Ron asked, sounding pained. “Those little tellyphones don’t even fit in my hand.”
“Draco Malfoy is not the world,” Harry insisted. The world would be a whole lot different, if he were.
“I don’t know if this is a good idea. How did you talk me into this? Fuck.”
“Did you check on Weasley?” he asked, instead of responding, and Harry felt a flush climb over his cheeks.
“Yikes,” Ron said, which Harry thought was putting it mildly. “I don’t even want to leave you here. Are you sure they did scans? Made sure there isn’t, like, some were-Nagini skulking about?”
They camped out in front of the screen. Harry Accioed down a mattress and every pillow in the house, and they claimed different sides. A fluffy stack of pillows at the foot of the bed held Draco’s bottle and Harry’s empty glass, tipped on its side. A pair of statues  from the hallway had hopped in to watch, stone lion and unicorn alike curled up in front of a low-burning fire. It wasn’t anything like the bonfire that the fireplace had room for, but the overall effect was nice and cozy after being out on the roof.
Ron and Hermione were leaving in the morning, taking two Apparition points to Australia. Ron was hesitant to leave his family so soon after Fred’s funeral, Harry could tell, but Hermione had been saying things like
Harry’s stomach twisted. He hadn’t known. It made sense, though: Ron’s face came to mind, bright and excited every time he mentioned training. “Er, well, I don’t have the NEWTs.”
For better or for worse, he was protecting this strange place and its secrets, Draco most of all. Harry opened the door.
“Mmm.” It was tempting, thinking of the Manor burning. Hermione looked far away again, and Ron bent toward her, urging her to drink her beer as though it was medicine and he were Molly Weasley.
He felt sick, and overly dramatic, and a little angry with himself. And yet Draco didn’t bring his anxiety to Harry, and Harry left him to it, and the two of them fretted the house full for two long, fraught days.
prompted a conversation on pureblood supremacy and privileges- Eddie himself was a Pureblood and Poppy was technically a Halfblood even though both her parents were magical. It wasn't so rampant, the bigotry that no muggleborns ever received positions of power but it was noticeably more difficult the higher up it goes.
It was time.

cat people.
Things like horcuxes. She was going to get the one in her removed by the Goblins soon. Her health had been deteriorating lately and Dumbledore was absolutely positive it was because the Veil was trying to collect the rest of Voldemort’s soul. She would be more than happy to hand it over, but it required an extremely delicate process.
“I suppose if I can I will but I don’t think I’ll go out of my way.” she told him and his lips twisted.
“If need be. Our concern is not the Ministry itself, but the laws
“I’m so sorry, something came up I didn’t mean to leave you darling,” came the rush of words before she was being unbound and set into the bathroom. She was more than confused, angry as well but for the moment too relieved to be back in this little room to use the loo and to bathe herself. She wasn’t sure how long it’d been that he’d been gone. As soon as she was out of the loo, hair still wet and skin pleasantly warm and damp beneath another of those flowy sleeping gowns Lucius was crowding her. His hands fluttered about her, checking her over. The smell of acrid sitting sick was gone and a pleasant vanilla smell coated the room very faintly. The bedding was all refreshed and fluffy again and the window was open slightly. “Did no one come while I was away?”
He was harsher with his followers. Angry at Evans, furious at her. But he didn’t know what she was capable of, and he didn’t know what kind of ‘action’ she would take if he finally got rid of some of the damnable mudbloods here. He would not risk going to Azkaban. The Knights of Walpurgis was getting larger as a group and he was getting more renown among his fellow students.
Narcissa didn’t know what a pishacha was but she assumed it was some sort of substitute for House Elves.
Drastic measures. Drastic measures. Ah, that’s right. He still needed to get rid of the Ravenclaw mudblood who kept taking pictures of Evans.
It…Was a blow.
She was across the room, having disarmed and paralyzed him before he could finish the word. He fell, unable to move as she stepped over on deft feet.
“Harry...”

“Then the Dementor-”
“Well naturally.” Beryl preened, once more going back to playing with the cutie in her lap and letting the girl play with her rings.
her would be a more apt description and he took every opportunity to remind her and the rest of her classmates of it. And while the depth of the dislike was different, he didn't much like Nev or Ron either. Nev had developed a sort of terror of the man and often botched potions up because she was so nervous and queasy, making him antagonize her even more in a vicious cycle. Ron wasn't particularly good with potions
“It, um…Was a shade? Of you I guess?” she said unsurely. It had been years ago and honestly, she didn’t like thinking about the whole thing. There were a lot of things from her schooling she didn’t like thinking about. “A younger you, from when you were in school.”
, Narcissa was trim and did not possess such abundant curvature. Besides that, Narcissa had pale, faint coloring from her Rosier mother, and Ms. Mulberry was dark haired, bright-eyed and had a bit of a sun-loved, wheatish look not often found in the lighter complexioned Pureblooded folk of the magical Isles. “Narcissa, this is Mimosa Mulberry.” her husband presented the woman to her as though she were something he particularly prized. This incited some small mount of respect for the woman to have wrapped the cold man she knew as a husband so firmly around her little finger.
“You- you have contact with her?” he rasped, even as his eyes couldn’t leave the two tiny, defenseless things they brought to him.
She kicked her feet excitedly, a number of thick books spread and open around her as she did her best to absorb as much knowledge as she could before having to go to school. Practicing wand movements with a twig in the backyard before throwing it to the dogs (of whom Hesperia was vastly condescending to- Poppy could just see it in the owl's eyes) or spending most of her time reading. Or having bought a Bunsen burner and practicing potions things- she may or may not have bought a few extra potions kits than she really needed and
He had never been afraid of Evans before.
He turned her around by the shoulders and she stared. Out by their coop the wheatish girl was crouched, cooing at the lavender cockerel as he ate from her small hand, using her free hand to pet him.
“She’ll…She’ll be alright after this won’t she?” Dudley blurted out just as they were getting ready to leave after a few awkward greetings.
“Yes. Come sit, you look a bit out of breath.”
“You’ll make a fine mother one day!” Dean said before also bursting into laughter at his expense.
less prepared than she should have been when she felt a hand grab her. She cursed her stupidity in thinking she would be safe in the muggle world, for thinking that they would have caught any stragglers so easily but not keeping track. She cursed that Voldemort had happened at all, that she couldn’t escape him even now. Mostly, she cursed Lucius goddamn Malfoy.
“In a while, Ms. Evans.”
“Eddie!” Hermione chided as Ron sniggered beside the blond.
Ron stretched, eyeing herself in the mirror curiously. She wasn’t quite so thin, she supposed. There was shadow of more sculpted muscles at her stomach and her arms and thighs were hard with muscle too. She studied her breasts and hips critically. She supposed they were of good enough size- her hips weren’t as wide as her mother’s of course, but they offset her trim waist and complimented her muscular thighs and toned arse.
And then she nodded, smiled and shut the compact.
She tried to open her mouth to thank him but her tongue was all cottony.
“I'll never get tired of that,” she said once she noticed Harry snickering at them. Harry shook her head, amused as Neville huffed with a frown. And then they were strolling over, a set of stairs growing up to one of the rooms hidden in the wall at a hissed command. They then proceeded to splay out, each at their own tables with their own stacks of books. Ron typically wasn't one for studying but these things were way more interesting than anything the library had or any books they could buy from Diagon. Some were hand written by Slytherin himself, others part of the man's vast collection.
“I’d certainly hope not, but extenuating circumstances might mean there is.” her voice had a pleasing natural husk to it, soothing, and the sort of lilt that suggested she was well-traveled.
“What are you?” he hissed.
on his bed.
Well no matter now was there? It was done and over with she told herself.
Which left Edsel and Pearl to babysit a fifteen year old, a thirteen year old and the current heir apparent to the Nott family, an eight year old. None of whom had ever been much exposed to muggles. Were probably told terrible things about them, given how his uncles were.
He was deft in removing the other enchanted items and even removing a few certain spells on the plush cot she was in (one could really tell it was a private institution) before he loomed over her with bright golden hazel eyes. The alarms finally stopped at least.
“You never asked.”
hers and Lucius’s combined.
“Suppose that explains some things.” Henrietta Heath was probably one of the most subtly intimidating women Edsel had ever encountered. There was just a look on her eye, a set to her jaw that said she wouldn’t hesitate to absolutely cut him down if he ever made himself a threat. Something in the way she sat, and something about her cozy home seemed like the den of a mother bear. Yes, he decided. Like a mother bear just waiting to be provoked. That was the feeling she gave him. He’s never personally seen a live bear (there was the stuffed bear at his grandfather’s that he remembers his baby cousin being terrified of) but he imagines any sort of interaction with them would be unpleasant. Much like
“There are still bills to pay and food to buy. How much do you think these things would cost in the long run, even while I’m gone for a good portion of the year Tom? And supplies for schooling?”
one as well. Your blood rushes in my veins, as a part of my soul rests in your own. We share a history of mistreatment at the hands of muggles who called us
“Ah, yes.” he nodded. “I believe we were at finding an appropriate place for such an event?”
Harry hummed, deftly folding the wrapping paper her gifts were wrapped in and delicately placing it in her trunk. She'd been able to sneak it up, a decoy locked in the cupboard that she used to call 'room'. Her cat, an extremely large and fluffy thing, a Norwegian Forest and Kneazle hybrid by the name of Midas watched her flippantly. After she'd sternly told him to stay away from her wrapping, the cat had been sulking on her cot watching her and pouting.
“Diggory! I see you’ve found Jasmine.” he greeted cheerily and the man’s attention turned to him after a moment, a polite smile on his face just barely keeping from being straight up Hufflepuff kind. Which was why Cedric Diggory was The Hufflepuff; he couldn’t
“Have you…Have you heard of us then?” and she nodded. “Then why didn’t you-”
“Really?” their mum asked, looking at the once more stationary statue.
“If we were to do this however, it would require your arms being unbound. We are still of two minds about it; one method would simply be to keep your cuffs on and extend the chains. It is the more popular option.” he went on, unaware of her thoughts. She hoped anyways, he’d made no claim or obvious clues that he might be using any sort of Legillimency on her but she wasn’t an expert. He glanced at her and she thought that he looked much younger in the sunlight like this, barefoot and in casual wear. Deep loathing welled up in her stomach, making it twist angrily. “The other option…Involves a collar that will shock you when you do certain undesirable things.”
“Yeah.” Ron muttered. Her mood without them had taken a dark and terrible turn and she often secluded herself in her bed, curtains spelled shut as she played chess by herself. Alone and brooding, and she avoided her siblings like the plague. When she had gone home, she was just one in many freckled children and it being so festive and busy, it was easy to slip away to her room. Not like she was really
“Excellent.”
and found her, of course, at her kitchen table. She didn’t bother looking up, her glasses perched at the edge of her nose as she did her finances. But she acknowledged his presence in the way the teapot floated over alongside saucer and cup to the other chair. He sprawled in it, exhausted. At fifteen, he had managed to secure a job in Knockturn to begin amassing money. He knew Evans worked in a dinky little bookshop in the muggle world. Her wage was pitiful but she had only said that it was only for the summer. His face contorted. A direct descendant of Slytherin, pandering around in a no-name shop in Knockturn! Oh, he would surely destroy it and the man he had to call his boss when he was ready to announce Lord Voldemort to the world. He looked to Evans.
Ron's sister and her brothers though had managed to corner her one day.
“But were another war to break out, and another Dark Lord should take over the Ministry and thus, the magical communities of Britain, how would the Confederation stop it?”
“The potion would enhance our natural magic and our physical bodies at the cost of one of our senses.” Nev frowned.
When she dreamed that night, the hands didn’t just caress her legs- they teased around her breasts, pressed long fingers into her rounded hips and she might swear someone else’s hair tickled at her neck.
“There are four of them. I’m not sure what they’re doing with them in the task, but there will be dragons.”
“The Ministry is also full of corrupt fools.” he waved off easily. “Who would eagerly blame someone else than admit that they aren’t in total control of the Dementors, or that they indeed

available medical professional all throughout the year? How does she keep up with all the students and especially if they have special medical needs or conditions? When was the last time she was reevaluated or taken a refresher course to make sure her skills are up to date? And how could the staff be alright with how utterly overworked she must be?
She still hated this, hated it all and was bitterer than she would ever admit. Just as she would never admit that she was getting a little antsy. Her purpose there still hadn’t been explained and they went about their days. She locked on the bed besides using the loo or shower or the occasion where Lucius would deem her docile enough for the time to let her use a muggle elliptical. He’d said something about trophies or something and weakening muscles. She’d wanted to point out- shout really- that she wouldn’t be weakening her muscles if she weren’t chained to the goddamn bed. There would be no point.
“Helle is with us about four times a week for what lessons we can provide, but she lives next door so to speak, so she’s often over more than that.” Pearl took up, staring Osmond down. He seemed to shrink under her cold stare, which Helle quite liked.
“No, Ms. Mulberry?” Lucius smiled down at her indulgently and she gave a perfectly angelic smile.
“You should lay down, Mrs. Malfoy,” the Mediwizard advised soothingly. Her jaw clenched in confusion. “You were so critically injured that you were brought back from your…Mission.” he finished delicately. Unspeakables, field ones especially, had specialized medical professionals dedicated to their Department. “You shouldn’t have been able to move at all at this point.” he said idly. She watched him because it was far better than looking at-
Dressed in a scruffy too-big jumper and wearing muggle denim, ratty trainers peeking from them. Several eye-catchingly bright gems crawling up either of her ears and almost impassive faced. She had a nice face, he thought. Not like his mum’s but she looked a bit like Granny Dorea. Except for her colors and hair style.
“Child’s play, now listen you daft fool! I found it, I’ve finally found it!”
“No what?”

“…We’ll speak about this later.”
“Anything else?”
After having had an absolutely smashing time at the bank (those carts were something else and she may have laughed all the way down in delight), they were getting her robes. Being sized for them, she was made to stand on a small dais. It was here that she had her first conversation with another to-be student. He spoke of 'their sort' in distaste, about bullying his father into getting him a broom even if there were rules against it and of proudly going to Slytherin as all his family had done before him. She eyed him curiously- this boy seemed awfully spoilt and reminded her of Dudley before the accident. But maybe that was just her imagination- still, she remained quiet for his tirade and didn't offer much in conversation though he seemed pleased enough to hear his own voice. His robes were finished before hers and he hopped down, looking at her directly for the first time.

“Ma’am, I’ve been to the Dueling Competitions around here, and I’ve already had such people try to attack me before. I most certainly am not afraid of a few bumbling thugs who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty. Because I don’t mind getting a little dirty myself when occasion calls. And I will not be holding back. They will either be apprehended for assaulting a Confederation Ambassador or I will either kill them or send them to insanity or coma.
She stroked his side until she heard his tiny rasping breath before he burrowed back against her. They were six, and so so very small against her. She’d never been a large person by any means and she knew, realistically, that they were at what felt like healthy sizes for their age and most especially for their father’s side. They were going to be tall. She’d known that the moment she’d set eyes on them.

“There is nothing to be done about Ms. Potter’s participation.” Dumbledore spoke before anyone could pipe in. “The tests have already been concluded. She is bound to compete or lose her magic, and it has been established that she does not wish to lose her magic.” he said with a pointed look after Karkaroff shifted to say something. The man grumbled.

“Just come on!”
“I thought you might enjoy a bit of variation to our usual days.” she barely heard Lucius say. That they had usual days at all was a punch to the gut but she could barely feel it, too entranced with the breeze and then the feeling of soft grass between her toes when Lucius gently helped her step down and into the meadow proper. They were both barefoot and she stared at her feet, then at what she could see of her legs. She wasn’t pale like Lucius, not the blinding white when she glanced at his toes but she was certainly not used to being this pale. Her skin took to the sun and the sun took to her, usually giving her a dusky sun-kissed glow. This dulling of her skin wasn’t the only difference to her body since she’d been taken. Even though it’d not been that long, she was gaining a bit of weight to her scrawny skinny body and the oils and shampoos in her and Lucius’ bathroom had made her hair seem much softer and manageable. He’d also cut the locks two days in so they only just brushed against her jaw. She didn’t mind as much as she’d nonverbally insisted she did; she’d been meaning to chop it off and likely she would have butchered it.
of Fossegrim in one of the water rooms, I’m told they live in the deep ponds built into the building itself. There were also a good few Huldra though most of them were employees.”
“But she’s not really in a house…” Jasper felt compelled to point out. Parvati huffed.
“What?!”
And just a few days after he’d finally begun returning to relatively normal, this happens. Neville sighed and shook his head, though he was more than a little alarmed to think there would be dragons.
by now.”
“We were also thinking it might make it a bit more comfortable if perhaps, he stayed with us in our room.”
“I found it!”

“Oh. What about Exploding Snap?”
“Evans.”
“Er- say, when we get Trevor back, would you mind terribly if we joined you?” the girl asked. “Trevor being the toad, that is.”
. Hattie was rightly furious and got the papers all settled, and we still didn’t know the girl’s name. Apparently she was never registered, so she never existed. That family signed the papers and shut the door on it all, washed their hands of it.” Beryl’s light and airy demeanor had dropped off for a far more solemn one. “Her name now, legally, is Hellebore Heath and she’s Hattie’s kid. You won’t hear her talk much, we think it’s trauma related and we aren’t going to push her. She’ll probably be shy for a while too, so if you see her just sort of watching you, she’s just curious.”
“Fucking Carrow.” Draco was silent for another moment. “I used it on Rowle.”
“I get it,” he offered, and tried to smile. He thought he’d pulled it off, but Ginny’s face was sad.
“That’s not what I meant,” she insisted. Only Hermione could corner him, alone together in a house full of people, finding the moment of silence in an all-night rager. Only she could gift him books and ask if his heart’s desire had been fulfilled.
“Death looks like the Hogwarts Express,” he put in, trying for helpful. Draco just blinked at him.”Is that why you came out now? Because you were going mad?”
They picked their way down the main path, packed gravel crunching below them, tinged with a blue iridescence. Pixies added further light, flitting from bush to bush in search of spiderwebs for weaving. Beyond them, the topiaries creaked slightly in the dark as the swans swayed and the horses shifted mid-rest. Everything was so ostentatiously

“No need to bring anything,” Ginny put in, her arm slung around Hermione’s neck now. “I’m sure they’ve got a vault of expensive wine, right Harry?”
“I-” Harry looked down. Next to his thigh on the bed was Malfoy’s wand. He must have been using it all day. “Okay, I know. Well, I hope she has some good ideas for you. And I just, um. The wand…”
“What’s next?” Draco asked, looking around. Someone brushed by him: Harry reached out and tugged Draco by the arm. They collided softly, bounced apart, and then Draco pressed more deliberately into him. Harry nudged back, and their elbows bumped, their hands tangling and separating in the ghost of an embrace.
Ron walked over and bumped shoulders with Harry, looking tense. “She didn’t believe me,” he murmured, “but I promised her lunch, so you’d better have food.”
“I know.” Harry felt stupid and small being upset in the face of that, being petulant or restless or alienated or whatever the feelings were that had tangled in his head. It was the same familiar childish anger he’d always hidden away, whenever he dared to want something. At school he’d thought of that feeling as a monster, and he privately still did. The monster of selfishness and jealousy, that he knew had no justification. Harry had spent the day with his friends, had even had Hermione alongside Pansy earlier, and yet he’d bristled at what he could lose if Draco regained his true confidante. He could tell he was being unfair, but then again, Harry’s friends hadn’t tried to sacrifice Draco to Voldemort. “I was trying to give you time. I saw Neville and Luna.”
Harry’s determination to get Draco into the muggle world doubled at hearing that. Was it safe? The whole world was out there, and he wanted to give it to Draco. Wanted to show him that there was more of it than the parts that had rejected him, that he felt betrayed by. He nudged Draco’s chest with his shoulder, bringing their arms into one long press of contact. “We’ll be together,” he said firmly.
When he opened his eyes, Draco had disappeared again, but this time Harry let him go.
“Is that in a book somewhere?” He could picture it in something Hermione would own.
He didn’t know how to feel. Draco had put it all out there, laid his fear alongside the knowledge of Harry’s heart, and..what? Left it all to rot? Their conversation rolled heavy through his head, every remembered word making Harry hate himself a little bit more.
“Or you could come back to Grimmauld,” Ron put in, cheerfully. “We had Gin and Dean over last night, it was a right laugh. She made this whiskey lemonade that makes you glow in the dark, you have to try it next time.”
Harry nodded, then remembered that Draco couldn’t see. “Yeah.” He was surprised that Draco was so perceptive, but then, Malfoy had had very few people to talk to for the last year. Especially the last few months. It wasn’t any surprise that he’d be more thoughtful than Harry remembered. He’d always been smart, and it wasn’t like they’d talked much before.
“A sickness?”
It was sloppy and shallow and not wholly comfortable, but Harry felt more like he’d woken up from a years-long fog with every second. He was totally present in a way he hadn’t been since he had to focus or die — here, on the overstuffed sofa, daylight barely making it past the heavy curtains and the koi swimming under the rug.
Hermione emerged, stiff-backed but smiling, to the smell of the madras curry Harry was making. It had gotten too spicy, so he was tipping more yoghurt into the pan, and he barely registered her in the room before she was pressing a hand to his back, her chin to his shoulder. Everyone was taller than him, these days.
“Sex, mostly,” Harry put in unhelpfully. He was lounging on the blue bed in Draco’s room, lying on his stomach and watching Draco fuss over his appearance. Ron and Hermione were due over at any moment, and Draco’s nerves had reached a fever pitch. The day or so since Harry had first warned him had been fraught with arguments and a few more rounds of tremendous sex, and it seemed like Draco had been worn down sufficiently into accepting help — he’d admitted to wanting it and knowing it was necessary, after all, but now he was showing the months’ worth of anxiety spring-loaded behind his reluctant agreement. Harry had thought he’d have to play at being understanding, since his interactions with Ron and Hermione were worlds away from Draco’s, but a gnawing pit had started to open in his own stomach with every bit tetchier Draco grew. Now he knew that a mean Draco was a panicking Draco, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t wary about joining the two halves of his world.
“Probably,” Harry said weakly. “Thanks.”
Draco snorted. “I told you, no muggle London allowed. It’s weird to think I’ve been here before, though.”
He responded immediately, as though he’d been waiting since their last one, waiting for weeks or months or years for the chance. Draco’s lips were a soft press of sweetness, opening in a slip of cool sparks that was a slow motion revelation.
Harry stumbled into the bathroom and splashed his face with water, taking advantage of the quiet moment to push his magic into the walls and try to feel around. He could tell the house was torn between sulking alongside Draco and being pleased at having people over — no doors were slamming, but the fridge wasn’t supplying any beer. He couldn’t sense Draco anywhere, and he pressed his cheek into the cool wallpaper. Where were the warrens and trapdoors that Draco had never shared? Were there more than he’d imagined, entire rooms or wings of secrets still closed away? He missed Draco desperately after two days apart. Everything was worse without him now, even through Harry’s well-worn anger.
This time Draco’s exhale was almost a laugh. Ears burning, Harry slammed the door on his way out.
She was so much better with people than he was, Harry reflected, watching her laugh from across the room. He was getting sourly drunk, lost between two rejections, and even if hers didn’t sting as much, it would help if Dean wasn’t glowing with love beside her. He wanted that. Even if it could never be so uncomplicated, with the person that he wanted.
“Now what?” Draco asked, turning to Harry. “Do muggles have coffee?”
But if Harry could do anything, it was be the brave one. He release Draco’s wrist and reached for his hair, wondering at the impossibly silky slip of it between his fingers, before he leaned forward and captured Draco in a decisive kiss.
“It was my birthday a week ago,” he said next, cracking an egg into a bowl. If it was weird for Draco to see Harry more comfortable in his kitchen than he was, he didn’t say anything. Instead he snorted.
“Thank you.” Harry turned from the drawer and smiled at him. Draco turned away, but Harry thought he might have been about to smile back.
“It’s still weird to hear you call him that,” she sighed, shaking her head. “He’s fine, he’s looking something else up. I think we may have something, but it will take time to check.”
After he’d worked up a sweat flying, he’d pop back in through the owlery window and freshen up. The house still wouldn’t take a warming spell properly, so he’d run the shower as hot as he could. From there he’d wander the house casting little spells so the house would recognize his magic, usually just turning lights on and off as he explored. Each day had lead to its own adventure: genealogy books that contained photos of Harry’s great-great-grandparents at a party, a singing teakettle that was eager to tell Harry about a king it had served, a burn mark in the wood that resisted any but the most Muggle of repair attempts. The portraits hadn’t woken up yet, but Harry felt like he and the Manor were getting to know each other, maybe trust each other. It made him understand the Malfoys a little better, too, like he understood more of what they felt they had been defending, at least on a personal level.
The fucker.
“Can’t wait to get rid of me, eh?” Harry joked weakly, but Malfoy just waited. Harry sighed. “No. I mean, I was thinking of it, but I don’t know if I should. When I got there today they were happy to see me, but no one had called me. I think… I just feel like I’m in the way of them now. Like they need time to be a couple and not be on another mad Harry adventure. It’s like everything’s over now and they don’t need me. I almost wonder if it’s better they’re not around me to heal.”
,” Ginny grumbled, but came close enough to touch his face. She did kiss him now, gently, and Harry brushed the dirt from her forehead as she stayed close, watching him. The touch of her lips was comforting, but so was the thought that she was leaving, making a choice without his having to torture himself about whether he wanted her. He’d thought he had.
The problem with magic was that it could be hard to know what you were looking at. He popped up and wandered over, brushing his hands off on his pants. The panelled wall outside the kitchen looked as though it had twitched, or flexed, or something. It triggered a memory of the Room of Requirement, maybe, and he ran his hand along the wall. It seemed normal. He tapped it: normal.
After that the Manor seemed more in tune with Harry’s lifestyle, and didn’t trip him anymore. It let Harry tug back portrait coverings that had been stuck, giving each painting a chance to move again. None did, but the Manor didn’t cover them back up, either.
“So my life goal is childish?” Ron was going from red to puce. “What happened? You can’t just hide in the Manor forever, we’ve barely gotten you out of it! Are you going back to Hogwarts with Hermione then? Are you going to burn down Grimmauld? Do you hate Quidditch? Who even are you?”
How could it be strange? They were one and the same.
Draco twitched and swore and came, and Harry slipped over the edge behind him. Harry shifted and let Draco move, cleaning them both with another spell before he tugged Harry down alongside him. Side by side and face to face now, Draco blinked and Harry felt his whole heart seize up. The urge to possess hadn’t left him with orgasm, it had just solidified into something larger and stronger and somehow more obsessive.
She looked up at the only two people she could trust. Veronica- Ron, as she told her two only friends- and her tired blue eyes, solemn on her elegant oval face, freckles a splash against her otherwise pale skin. And Geneva, Nev for short with her blank vacant dark brown eyes on her round cherubic face. She breathed in deep.

“Because he was afraid of losing his genius intellect, of it all going to waste. And losing one’s mind is a kind of death too, but he wasn’t scared of it like Morty.” she answered just as fiercely. “A bit of time and effort for access to unimaginable information about another self and their world,
“They actually have some pretty dangerous teeth. Can go right through clothes.” she mused aloud. “What about a chinchilla? They’re incredibly soft, cute, small and they take dust baths. Harmless and easily held. They do very well in quiet homes as well, and don’t require excessive attention.”
“She really is bottomless.” a Prince girl said with a disgusted wince. “How barbaric.” and he wanted to comment on the girl’s habit of eating as though she were a small bird, taking peckish little bites. He wouldn’t of course and only smiled at the girl handsomely. She smiled in a pleased manner under the attention from handsome, winsome Prefect Tom Riddle. Evans paid no heed and continued to practically inhale her food. She wasn’t a messy eater, but she ate as though she didn’t know when she was going to eat again.

Oh, how she wished he would look her way...
“Do you think you can find her?” he asked dubiously.
“Are a group of supremacist terrorists in a cult intent on genocide and you are the cult leader.” she cut in easily. “I’m…Disappointed, Tom.”
and a Ministry official with quite a lot of power to swing around had deliberately set one of them in not just a muggle neighborhood, but the very one that the disgraced Girl-Who-Lived was shucked away to.”

. For your first…Allow me to enlighten you, young Poppy Potter.” he smiled a little wider, leaning closer. She was already against the backboard of the bed but squished herself as far back as she was able. She felt more than saw his arm move, settling in next to her hip and trapping her there as he shifted closer. “You are mine.” he told her.
“Why would they be in the muggle world?”
“I was homeschooled.” she answered after hastily devouring everything on her plate with a ferocity that impressed Ron. Jasper barely noticed how beastly it was (used to Ron’s eating habits and all) and filled her plate again between bites of his own. “And I’ll be doing self-study while your ilk will be in classes.”
She’d gotten him a scarf. It was a nice scarf and she’d said it had a few enchantments on it. When one of the other boys complimented his new Veela hair scarf (a bit mockingly, looking pointedly at his secondhand robes), he’d been suitably startled. When confronted, she shrugged and said it’d been lying around in a thrift store and she thought he’d like it. She went on to talk about how sometimes, when in the muggle world, wealthy looking half and purebloods sometimes attract nasty attention and well. Nice things can be sold for good money. Given the times, Tom wasn’t all that surprised. He’d heard things like that before happening but…
“If that’s all Bourke?” she turned from him to check on a few of the vertical planters. He sighed behind her.
He sat at a small desk, dressed neatly but certainly not in the quality that he was used to she could tell. He did not look uncomfortable in these garbs, he didn’t look angry, he wasn’t sneering, he really wasn’t even paying attention to her now. He was disturbingly human looking at the moment, reading the paper casually if not absentmindedly as he picked at his breakfast between articles. She had come to in this room, arms and hands chained and her ankles as well. They were of some high quality; they were charmed to ensure comfort but not mobility and she wondered where they’d gotten them if Malfoy was wearing those clothes and they were here in this quaint looking little room together. She had been alone when she had first woken up. Alone and partially laying in the bed she was in now with its soft diamond quilted pattern in dark blue, the cushy pillows and the heavy curtains drawn back. She was not hurt, not scraped, bruised or even aching.
“I wish you would,” Harry muttered, crossing his arms and giving the now-sheepish Savage another look. He hated to feel like a petulant child when dealing with Aurors, but he’d never been able to help it.
“Like you’re so much better, hiding along with me.” A couple passed by on the far side of the water, and both of them quieted for a minute, staring at each other until they were alone again. Draco’s eyes were huge, and Harry felt somehow out of breath. He was hurt, though he didn’t know why. He
And then there was a new warmth between them, and Draco’s hand slowed and stopped. They panted into each other for a moment, the weight of limbs suddenly coming to the surface.
Harry had to laugh, low, hunching down a bit to rest his elbows on his knees. He looked up at her, anchoring himself to the universe through her familiar know-it-all expression, as though she were going to take notes on what he said in order to ace whatever test came with it.
Harry had gotten up early to have breakfast with Ron and Hermione at the Burrow, as he had all week. Ron was going back and forth now, packing up again for the flat in Hogsmeade. The start of the semester and the Auror sign-ups were coming up quickly, and each day had become busy for them, each morning catch-up precious. Harry skipped his morning flights to go now, knowing he could come back and chase Draco through the grounds all day once he’d done his duty to friends and family. It felt good to get out, too, remember the people he loved and his life outside of the manor. At least when that life was private, and comfortable, and stocked with Molly’s cooking.
“After all we’ve been through, this is the day you finally crack,” Harry grumbled, and popped the window open. Cool air climbed in, bringing sounds of the street with it.

“Cygnus was born first.” his mother gestured to the one with pale hair. With his hair. “Corvus had been more…Difficult from what we are given to understand.” and that made Draco alert for the first time in

“So this means…Someone had snuck in beforehand?” a subordinate frowned.
“Yes…Well…” Petunia stammered. Dudley threw himself forward but still managed to be very delicate when he hugged her with a red face and watery eyes.
“Not interested in eternal glory and fame?”
“Chess is much more difficult than Draughts.” she frowned. “Draughts is nice and easy. And competitive.” she added as an afterthought.
I was thinking of whether or not to add my cross-over documents into this work or create a separate one for that. I'm thinking maybe just add them to this one and add a Harry-centric tag? Because...You know, they're all Harry-centric. Also, uh, hi. I read the comments, but I'm awkward and so I don't end up responding. But it's really nice to see people interested in what I write and what they think about it. And again, if anyone reading these wants a crack at one of them they have full support to do so. If you wanna.
“Of course, Madam Mulberry.”
Being that land was somewhat precious commodity, owning a space enough for smallholding or farming, or just owning land in general was expensive business so Helaine’s land and home were untouched for the past six years since her passing.
“A lemur?” his pale brows rose up.
“That’s wonderful, simply wonderful. I’ll take you to the restroom first. Worry not, I’ll wait just outside and if you need me for anything, just knock on something yes?” the French lilt of his voice was pleasant. She nodded as he helped her stagger along to the plain door just across from her cot. He opened it for her and delicately placed her leaning against a clean white marble counter, smiling at her again and gently closing the door.
He’d talked her through things and all things considered, she wasn’t overly concerned about turning into a cat sometimes. It sort of made her think of Animagus, except that she sort of kept some things sometimes. Like her higher-than-normal ears, and how rounded and furry and soft and sensitive they were.

moved, only teaches outdated, faulty information on the Goblin Wars! Those who can’t afford tutors or are too busy with their other classes and studies will fail! Not that it matters since quite a good lot of those children go on to become Ministry workers! The pitiful career choices are a part of the limited scope that creates an equally pitiful education! There’s no push from indoctrinated witches and wizards to progress! They’ve turned magic into a stagnant state of being! Where is the diversity?! Certainly it must be hiding somewhere, but certainly not at Hogwarts let me tell you! Traditional is one thing, forcing students to narrow all their studies on magic and absolutely nothing else makes for a poor education! And even worse, not a diverse set of magic! Oh sure, the core subjects like Transfiguration, Potions, Charms…But the D.A.D.A. has been so wildly unpredictable that the students don’t even get a stable education in that!

to be different.
“Who is she?” Osmond almost immediately interrupted and it was probably because she was already biased against them but Helle thought that was quite rude to interrupt like that. By the look on the older brother’s face, he thought so too.
“The muggle game? I suppose it’s alright. I like skittles more.”
Dumbledore and her have been exchanging letters so far in the summer, it already being close to the end of July. Sometimes the subjects were perfectly light and fine, but some were of more secretive things.
“Correct.” he grinned, “She’s only competing because she’ll lose her magic, and she’s under the approved age limit as well. And she isn’t a student,” he said the last bit like a second thought. “Don’t look so worried! There are plenty of new rules in place to make sure no one will end up dying.” and Jasper practically heard the ‘probably’ he left hanging.
This was how Poppy made friends her age that weren’t Dudley. The kids in primary knew she was different and had tended to stay away.
“Just…Telling you about it and, maybe…Teaching the little miss a bit about the wizarding world? She’ll be getting a letter to a magical school come her eleventh summer and it’s better to have half a foot in, so to speak.”
And then they were in a bookstore and she almost felt like she would bounce off the walls. She was let loose and she shred through the store hungrily. It was a thorough inspection of all of the books she could get her hands on and she was glad for the extra money from her trust fund. She was brought up short when she saw her name on the cover of a thin book. Eyeing the other paperbacks around it, she was dismayed to see her name and the title Professor Sinistra had told her about. Naturally she grabbed one of each to better assess what this new exciting world had theorized about her- and weren't there laws about things like this? She knew there were in the muggle world about minors and publicity. Beyond that though, she got books for everything- law books, etiquette books, history books (she got quite a lot of those) theoretical books on subjects she'd never heard of, books on magical creatures and beings and books on the Ministry. Whatever she could get her hands on. In the end, she needed a cart and the person at the register had very kindly given her (with a little extra fee) a heavily charmed bag to hold all of them in one neat little bag and it was quite light. Her guide expressed amusement at the amount of books disappearing into the bag and muttered something about roosts and ravens? And then they, she and her guide, moved on.
“Waking up Ms. Potter?” came the gentle query and she grumbled to herself before turning and snuggling down. “Now that won’t do. Wouldn’t you finally like to get up out of that cot?” the coaxing, pleasant voice asked her and she considered it before turning slightly and trying to lift herself. “Easy now, careful.” cool hands helped her up. She turned her gaze to the man and he smiled at her. Now Mimosa was never one who was good at guessing ages, and even worse when it came to magic folk since they all seemed to age a little differently but he looked probably a few fair years younger than, say, her aunt and uncle. His hair was dark brown and he looked like he hadn’t been outside in years he was so pale but his eyes were practically luminous.
“For…Show?”
“Is my sweet little darling giving you trouble again, Mr. Bodhi?” the woman asked him with a grin. “You can tell the cherub-faced menace I’ll be back in two days to see her.”
“But what about the trust fund?” he knew about it because he was in it. They paid for everything school related. They might not be the best of things, but it was still more or less the best he could get at current.
“I say then, who was that?”
Such was how he spent the rest of his day, sitting listlessly on a chaise lounge and staring at his perfectly calm and complacent sister.

“No. We do everything ourselves. Whether by wand or hand.” Pearl absolutely beamed. “But usually by hand.”
“Just a bit of a scuffle.” she said and he narrowed his eyes, his wand quickly putting the three boys into unconsciousness if they weren’t already.

We were discussing playdates weren’t we?”
The next few days passed peacefully; the week had been pleasantly calm in comparison to some of the times. When Dumbledore came dressed in bright yellow slacks and a paisley yellow and purple button down to collect her, sleek white hair braided extravagantly the Dursleys didn’t even look offended.
to make me a horcrux?” she said, horror somehow racketing up.
At least the mirrors weren’t charmed to talk. She dreaded to imagine how she looked. And sure, every so often they would use appropriate cleaning charms but she still felt greasy and sweaty through her drowsiness. She almost slipped going in but there was a small sitting area that she sunk down into, leaning against the cool tiles as water came on in a perfectly lukewarm temperature. While she typically preferred scorching hot and then switching to not-quite icy for a rinse off, for now she didn’t want to shock her system too much. There was a nondescript bar of soap she used and unlabeled vials of what she could only assume was some hair lotion substitute. She didn’t take particularly long, but longer than she would have liked for her limbs to cooperate.
“There are,” Lily told her quickly. “But I don’t think…” she trailed off. He looked between his sister and their parents curiously. He liked care of magical creatures and all, but he wasn’t that into it.
“By hand? Why
Aside, of course, from wincing concern that a fourteen year old would be forced to compete in a tournament meant for of age magic folk and that people have died in previously. He looked at her again.
This is from my 'Lucius is a stud' phase that still lurks in the back of my cavernous empty head.
As if she could talk about her problems to the popular older Hufflepuff. About her Grandmother's constant down putting. About dealing with pitying glances and whispers of 'practically a squib'. About her parents being alive, but might as well have been dead. About what her Uncle and his wife did when she was especially young almost killing her numerous times, how they were never punished like they
“I need to tell her,” he said, more focus returning to him as he turned, looking ready to bolt to his sister’s rooms.
“Not at all! You are delightful company, Lucius, and my little cherub would benefit from a good day of fun.” she beamed at him and again, watched him smile in return. “Here,” she snapped her fingers again, this time a more standard, vague copy of her schedules compete with small notes on days she can take off if need be. “This is my current schedule and those with a red slash on the date are days I can skive because really I’m only needed to sit and look pretty. I can just as well set a recording device there and have all the same information. Better to do that, actually, that way they won’t feel the need to filter themselves.”
“That man?” he asked with perfectly feigned polite interest. He had very little real interest in her purpose here, only that she had presented herself at all.
But when she had initially woken alone in the small room it wasn’t that long before Malfoy had entered, already pulling his outer robe off to neatly hang up on a hook on the door. He had not looked at her right away, instead taking care of taking off his boots, socks, gloves and taking the ribbon from his hair. Only for a moment, only for him to brush through it with his fingers absently before tying it back again. He just looked like a man going about his daily routine and it had greatly unnerved her. When he’d finally turned to her in his plain white shirt and crisp black trousers, he’d examined her for a quiet moment before greeting her quietly.
such desecration?!
Turning it over, she frowned at the green lettering. How did they know she slept in the third largest room? That was quite strange, almost worrying. Nevertheless, she tore it open to pull out...Some sort of stationary maybe? Certainly not paper at any rate. Ignoring that, she read the foreword before frowning a bit more and turning to the list of things she would need. She set the things down, wondering at it before shrugging and pushing them away to continue helping her curious cousin.
Making her way onto Platforms 9¾ was interesting- but what was on the other side was more so. Seeing a bright, cherry red steam train gleaming and the platform packed with people- quite a number of those people in robes- made her smile widely.
It was a novel feeling at first but one she’d gotten more than a little frustrated with. She was a naturally independent person and besides Ron and Hermione (sometimes even them), she didn’t like being clung to. She liked her alone time. And of course, soon his lackeys would circle around them, sending mean looks to anyone who so much as glanced over. She had to hand it to Dud, he really had his minions well trained and loyal.
Carefully explaining that there was a wizarding world, and that her charge was a member of it (and haltingly explaining just how famous of one) was a slow and awful experience. Almost entirely because of the stone faced look the woman gave them as she sat in her rocking chair, carving wood into figurines. He sat ramrod straight and held Pearl’s hand closely in his own as they waited for the reaction. There…Really wasn’t much to go on from this woman. Sturdy, and well under Edsel’s own impressive height of two metres, Henrietta Heath had wavy mocha hair spilling from a half done bun at the back of her head. The crow’s feet and blatant frown marks dug into her almond brown skin like a warning to others not to get on her bad side, even if they were the biggest markers to what her age actually was. Her eyes were slanted slightly, and very dark brown and unerringly focused on the two of them.
“Oh yes, there’s an absolutely lively gala in the Swedish counterpart to your Ministry.” she laughed pleasantly. “A beautiful affair it was, absolutely stunning displays! Much more exciting than the ones here, I’ve found.”
“Oh yes Ms. Minnie! Malmsi will do that!” before again leaving via loud crack noise.
“Like what?”
At dinner and after watching the Sorting (it never got old, seeing all of the eleven year-olds who would be split into four houses), Harry felt a spike of frantic panic in her chest when she learned that Snape would be acting as DADA professor that year. She calmed down a little about Slughorn though- everyone in Slytherin knew about Slughorn and that meant she would be safe the upcoming year in Potions. She glanced over at Ron, then Nev. Ron looked as horrified as many other Gryffindors at the prospect of Snape being DADA professor. Nev was white as a sheet. Her lips pursed a little but she resolutely went back to her meal. The elves were usually kind enough to put something specific together for her but she always checked her food just in case. After dinner she slipped away unnoticed to the disused girl's bathroom and down to her sanctuary. While she waited she flitted about, checking the corpse of the Basilisk where she'd hidden it away and out of sight under some heavy preservation charms. She'd been harvesting its venom, scales and the like to sell. It was worth a heavy amount for just a few drops and

Willa said she was a snob too, and she got Adam and Adrian to call her names.
And just like that, her quiet seething turned into an inferno of fury and she very near didn’t stop herself from lunging at him, restrained arms or not. He glanced at her through his pale pale lashes. “That option is unlikely to ever come to fruition.” he pet the cat in his arms, even as the cat tried to push himself from Lucius’ chest to sniff at her face. “Still, the decision had not yet been made so for now Rusty will remain waiting.”
And then that muffled feeling went away and horror flooded him. He threw himself down by her crumpled body, not daring to touch her and flailing uselessly for a few quiet moments.
“I’ve landed in a pile of bones Tom. I’m going to be taking some of them as compensation.”
“Yes, but we need not worry of tan lines.” she said thoughtfully. Ms. Mulberry huffed, a small smile on her face.
She would explain that she wouldn’t spill details, or even really say they were getting a divorce. Would tell him that she was being sent out (which is true when she would finally give in and take the new position) and maybe after a few months the strain of her absence would give him an excuse to actually divorce without ruining either of their reputations. She wouldn’t bother telling him about the child; she might not end up keeping it after all, it was early. Not like she could really keep it even if she decided not to get rid of it. If it looked anything like Draco, and it certainly would. She didn’t want to take her feelings out on an innocent babe that, in any other circumstance, she would have been overcome with joy at having. She’d always wanted a family of her own. She supposed if she really wanted it, she wouldn’t be getting it with Draco. She wasn’t sure if she would try again. Not…Not when it could turn out like this all over again.
not have gotten two of them that were meant for someone more experienced with potions but she was determined not to go in blind in any way. Reading on theories was all fun and good but it was the practice with the majority of her subjects that worried her.
I can't even remember when I first started this one. A while ago that's for sure. Ron and Nev are girls in this one too, Harry's a Slytherin and Nev's a Hufflepuff.
Alienation. Loneliness. Isolation. The things that brought them together. She looked back down at her plate. Small portions. She never could lose all the weight and it was still used against her, even if she was much slimmer now. She glanced again at her two friends guiltily. Harry was thin- always so thin, too thin. She never could eat enough. And Ron- she ate so so much, but she was tall and lanky. Ron
“The wards are updated and refreshed during the roughly three month period the students are absent, as well as extra maintenance.” she said after a moment. “Which is to say, it’s not safe in the least and could warp a student’s magical core if they were indeed to try and stay in the castle during that time.”
Either way, she didn’t seem to be leaving his life anytime soon.
“I thought you already did-”
“You wouldn’t want to be famous?” he asked. Because she will be soon now that they found her. He won’t be surprised when he and his family are on the covers again. They usually were every few months. Be it because of his Boy-Who-Lived status, his father’s achievements as Head Auror or one of his mother’s books.
it boomed and the hat was politely taken off. There was sparse and grudging polite clapping from her new House and Tom watched with critical eyes the way they received her. She didn’t seem to much care, not about the looks she was getting or how other children moved away from her like she was diseased when she sat. Frankly, she didn’t seem to care about much and that…Unnerved Tom a little bit. Still, if she continued to prove useful he would keep her within sight. So when he was finally,

Corvus didn’t sniffle and cry like Cygnus, but his small fists were shaking with how hard he clung to her and his face was pushed deep enough that she wasn’t sure he was breathing enough.
“She turned one of Gilbert’s goats pink once. It’s still pink, I mean. Floated some toys around when she was even smaller.” the woman told them.
“What, really?”
“I see. Well I'm in Ravenclaw- Poppy here is a hopeful of my House, and these two are also aiming for Gryffindor.”
“Nah, who'd want our Veronikins?” one twin snorted and she felt deep boiling anger, flaring hurt searing just beneath it and fueling it on.
“I’m Neville Longbottom.” the slightly pudgy boy greeted her with a nervous smile.
Helpful. Really helpful. He must have noticed her confused (and probably terrified, let’s be honest) expression because he let out a little huff of a chuckle, a strange little half-smile on his face that unnerved her terribly more than she already was.
“There's nothing we can do.” Nev said quietly as Harry flexed her hand. Ron's fist slammed against the stone wall, making both look to her.
“Edsel. Never heard that name before. He go by Ed or Eddy then?”
“Oh…Oh no, he prefers Edsel. A holdover from his…Traditional family.” the woman explained, brushing back a thick brunette braid. Her face was inherently pretty in a classic sense, oval and pale with cupid bow lips and full lashes curling over intense blue eyes. She was slim beneath her fuzzy wool sweater and durable corduroy trousers, Beryl could tell, and seemed young.

, Ms. Skeeter.” her eyes flashed in a hard way and for a second, Narcissa felt paralyzed.
“When lunch rolls around?”
“How old are you Bluebell?”
“Yeah and you guys should really look them over! Hogwarts feels so behind in comparison and look at this! Comprehensive muggle studies and studies not solely pertaining to magic! Guess what else, guess what else? No, I’ll just tell you anyways- I got a few studies, all put together in a book, from the International Confederation about how international premier schools stack up and guess where Hogwarts is? Near the bottom! The bottom! Some criticisms include our snore of History, our exclusion of more varied magical classes and non-magical classes, not having a physical fitness class or clubs besides Quidditch, not even a muggle sports club, our food, our portions of food, our all-at-once dining, our Hospital Wing and injury rate and oh, the list just goes on! There are entire pages dedicated to our unstable D.A.D.A education!” she laughed as though this were exhilarating news.
“Why wouldn’t I? Especially concerning this Dark Lord that had decimated at
“She’s prettier than you, Desdemona.” one of the girl’s sisters shot back to her. “If she would just let me do her up a little…”
“What?”
“No sir. The Professor Dumbledore of my time will explain everything in the pensieve.”
Her head cocked to the side as a boy glanced about the compartment, eyes alighting on her. “O-oh, um...Can I sit here please?” he asked nervously and she smiled. Thus she made her first friend in Eddie Carmichael who would be a Second Year. She happily shared her books with him until they were interrupted when the door slid open again.
her levitate a cat out of a tree. Someone needs to make sure she’s not exposed out here.”
He would talk sometimes about what ‘they’ or ‘we’ did or said. Never who they were, never how many of them there were; undoubtedly other escaped Death Eaters. She turned her attention onto the cat instead. She could see why they’d call him that- his fur certainly did the name credit in color.
And he might have let her cry on him and all, but that didn’t change that he’d been trying to kill her for years or that he started a war or that he killed her parents and countless others, and commanded a bunch of terrorists that tortured people and murdered and had raids. She was sure that he thought enough time spent together would change her opinion on him, along with a tale about how unstable he had gotten after splitting his soul numerous times and how that wouldn’t happen again. She had her doubts. A
“Is there a problem?”
Her chuckle had the same husky tenor and it caressed his ears pleasantly. Oh yes, he thought to himself, he certainly wouldn’t mind a whirl with this woman. “I appreciate the offer and I do believe I’ll take you up on it.”
“Yes, yes, you were sleeping but you’re not now so come on!”
after the confrontation at the Ministry and she blames herself, and for the injuries her friends sustained and for the way Moony, the way Remus was in agony after finally having one of his bestfriends back and
“It's nice to meet you, sir. I'm Poppy Potter.” she watched the way his dark eyes shot to her forehead, only for a second before he offered a shaky smile and his hand. She took it- his grip was of a confident man, yet the rest of his demeanor was not.
“You can’t claim her just because her brother is here,” Karkaroff immediately threw in.
“I can’t imagine all the charms and salves one of your fair tone might need.”
Hattie hummed, the tiny tot on her hip silent and watchful as she’d been since she’d taken her in. Getting that unpleasant family to sign over papers for a girl that seemingly didn’t exist wasn’t hard, and given that all they did was sign the papers and then toss a ragged looking blanket at her before slamming the door shut, Hattie had the unique pleasure of naming a child for the first time. H.J. Potter was on the blanket and the plaque by the door to the family had been Dursley. She didn’t very much resemble what she had seen of the family anyways, and Hattie wondered sometimes at why they had her precious girl at all. She hadn’t known the girl’s age either. But little Hellebore ‘Helle’ Julita had become hers in winter, changing the Potter for Hattie’s Heath.
Still, it was good to know in case she collapsed suddenly; which has happened before. Her friends and godfather didn’t know the extent of how much the horcrux was affecting her and it was between her, Dumbledore and Mad Eye.
“Should we cut it again?” he mused. “What do you think?” his fingers twirled a black lock around his hand and he tugged gently. She frowned a little, reaching up to pull a piece straight to evaluate the length. Then plucked Lucius’ ribbon straight from his hair to tie hers up, though strands still escaped, unruly even if they were tamer than they’d ever been. His chuckle was deep and only slightly stifled as he pushed his hair back behind his ear. She did not often initiate touches but it always seemed to make his eyes sparkle.

“Oh, any number of reasons.” she waved a free hand listlessly, other hand writing out an essay in the abandoned room they’d commandeered deep in the dungeons. “Sometimes for novelty, sometimes because of the technology. Sometimes weapons.”
Nothing important, nothing she could use.
The diary with the soul in it wasn’t mentioned. Instead, Marigold had apparently found out the cause of the petrifications and ran to stop it because it had stolen Mimoza. Marigold then managed to find out where the Chamber was and fought and slayed the Basilisk after it attacked Mimoza.
Instead, she had been furious and especially horrified when she realized they had changed her clothing into some sort of flowy sleep garment and that she didn’t wear unders under them. She had also been rendered mute- she was sure it wasn’t a permanent curse though since Malfoy had allowed her to speak once. Of course, all she did was snarl and curse and spit out insults and promises so that was short lived.
Helle blinked, tilting her head to the side. The cat blinked back at her before yawning and stretching widely, showing off needle sharp teeth and very sharp looking claws. He was a very big cat, she noticed as he lazily dropped from the trunk he’d been resting on to the floor to lazily putter over to her, sitting and giving her an imperious stare. She graciously obliged and scratched at his ears, which he immediately responded to by nearly falling to his side and purring very loudly. Helle felt accomplished somehow.

still couldn’t see the obvious. “Honestly I don’t know why you keep her around Riddle, she’s not even pretty.”
“What, so we’re…We’re subpar or something? Why are you so happy about that?” Ron frowned. Her friend’s green eyes glittered in the light. It was tinged green, the lights. Harry had told them before it was like the light in the Slytherin common room, which was partially under the lake.
“Mm. Oh, that reminds me, I’ve got a little gift. I was getting into embroidery hoops again between the knitting.” Beryl shifted the girl back to rest against her so she could bend to the side. Her bag was just a repurposed lovely taupe jumper that had gotten too beaten up to wear or give to one of the others. It was an embroidery hoop, with delicate hellebore blooms curving around the bottom and side with ‘Hellebore Julita Heath’ in a fine looping slant and smaller, beneath her name ’19 December’ for when she finally got the papers signed. “It’s not much, but I thought a little commemorative piece would make a nice memory.”
“You know, you could always come back to the Sector. They’ll give you a little specialty pass and if you wanted, while the children are busy playing, you can have a tour of the place.”
“No, Castelobruxo is within the top ten and Hogwarts is…Well, the twenty-third out of twenty-eight.” she shrugged.
“It will be sent to you shortly thereafter that she arrives. There are many privacy laws around the place and given Ms. Potter’s fame in our world, it’s preferred to our more local medical facilities. It will arrive within the hour she arrives there, but do not expect it for several days. The extraction process will be lengthy.”
The first time they’d seen her giggle was a shock, to be sure. With her placid expressions and quiet demeanor, it was amazing to see how it changed when she laughed or giggled or smiled. Her whole little face lit up and her eyes sparkled and it was always just such a wholesome sight.
“…How do you know about that?” he spat, low and dark, keeping his eyes on her. He’d not had to watch her as though she were a danger before and it rankled something in him to acknowledge that she might pose a threat.
She kept her eyes closed, hands idly petting over the children in a repetitive self-soothing. As long as she didn’t think about it too much, it was fine.

“Just because we might like to read doesn’t automatically make us Ravenclaws.” Hermione chided, huffing. Ron’s lips twisted doubtfully but he shrugged and let it go. Not like they had a say in which House they went to anyways.
“It was a pleasure being here, Mr. Barkley.”
When they would divorce, she would be insisting that he keep it. She wanted nothing to do with it already. Everything in there was…Was tainted now. She would take her most precious things; photo albums, excepting the smaller one that she had been growing with Draco. The reconstructed Firebolt hung up in their kitchen. Her old school trunk usually held all her other important precious things.

“Malfoy? Gran doesn’t like that family too much, says they’re…Well.” Neville trailed off shyly. “No good.” he managed to say.
He was the one chosen to bring her down to breakfast, seeing that his parents couldn’t just stay in Hogwarts though his dad was given days off on the days of the tasks and the night of the Yule Ball. She wasn’t wearing a uniform- another too big jumper, the sleeves almost covering her hands. Jeans that looked worn and pretty feminine flats. There was a headband pushing her bangs back and she really did have a pretty face. Even with that odd lightning shaped scar. She was in stark contrast with the rest of the students with their (mostly) neat uniforms and robes. She was also very quickly under intense scrutiny as soon as they entered the hall. Jasper ignored the stares and whispers as he always did and gently (she really was so tiny, it made him worry) urged her to his usual spot. Ron and Neville were already there and scooted to make room for both between them. He sat her next to Neville, figuring she might be a little more comfortable with the soft-spoken boy.
She could snap his neck in less than a second like this and her massive magical core swayed in unease.
“Mummy,” came the muffled, teary whimper and her body tensed up. She’d had young children call her that before (or the equivalent); she supposed something about her seemed to radiate a matronly feeling to them. She forced herself to calm down and do what she would any crying whimpering child that clung to her and gently stroked through soft curls.

“I very well could, Ms. Skeeter, but I daresay a publication founded and currently at least partially owned the Ministry would instead paint me as a holier-than-thou Confederation ambassador who thought of the British Ministry and those under its authority to be uneducated simpletons rather than bothering to fill in the context and raise points about the severe faults the Ministry and Hogwarts suffer from. Should you attempt to post or publish anything of the sort outside of an expressly factual interview that must be scheduled and approved by the Confederation, and certainly not heralded by any run of the mill journalist who works under the Ministry’s payroll, you will be terminated and blacklisted from any journalistic careers. We at the Confederation do not play around with gossip and falsities and certainly not with sensationalist gossip rags.” she said shortly. “That includes ‘anonymous’ tippers.
“Gladly! We'll make space in the meantime.”
“T-the pleasure i-is mine I assure y-you.”
“Excuse me, have you seen a toad?” came the demand. Both she and the curly-haired blond looked up- the girl standing there had a frizzy bush of brown hair and stood in an imposing stance. Behind her was a tearful round-faced boy with dirty blond hair and big dark brown eyes. “Neville here has lost his.”
“We’re… near my house. It’s not in a magical neighborhood,” Harry rushed to assure him, when Draco narrowed his eyes. “I thought I’d just show you the normal muggle stuff I do. We can go to Sainsbury’s.”
“What do you think happened to him?” Harry asked as casually as he could, his heart thumping into his ribs as he counted out his galleons.
Hiii y'all I'm so sorry I semi-abandoned this.
It was startling to be awake again. Being on the ground was strange, and it took Harry a moment to remember where he was. He was cushioned in a bed, but he wasn’t in a bedroom, and he wasn’t alone.
Draco turned to the hall, and Harry went to answer the door. Someone knocked a second time, and the gargoyle closest to the door started a low warning yowl. How had anyone gotten past the Malfoy wards? Who could do that, and then choose to knock? He glanced back over his shoulder to ensure that Draco was out of sight, and caught a glimpse of him disappearing into one of the tapestries down the hallway, where Harry knew for a fact the wall was solid stone.
He hated lying to them. It was antithetical to how he loved, lived, had survived. He had chased them away this summer, physically and emotionally both. It was past time to let them back in. Them, instead of
“Ugh,” Harry told him, and refilled his water glass. The kitchen was spinning a little, but he thought that he wouldn’t throw up if he focused.  “You’re disgusting. How are you not drunk? You drank more than me.”
“What the hell is a Spalva? And more to the point, if I leave this house to run your errands, you and this house will probably vanish into the ether.”
he thought muzzily, and didn’t stir. If they heard him they might quiet down again, and he hadn’t heard them speak yet. It was the same kind of portrait murmuring that he’d heard so many times at Hogwarts, almost comforting to hear again. There weren’t any that he remembered in this room, but there was one outside the doorway, and he could hear two voices going back and forth out there now.
Harry steered them toward the water. Draco already seemed overwhelmed, keeping his hands in his pockets as they walked, his eyes on every stranger. They moved through a few blocks of shops and past the Row gardens, people being replaced slowly by a quiet peace. They slipped down the stairs to the waterway, the stillness of the cool waters reflecting the green of the trees above. A few small boats were pulled up to the cobblestoned shores, and a couple of people were walking their dogs, but they were mostly alone. Draco’s hands hadn’t left his pockets: Harry guessed he was touching his wand.
“Oi.” Harry pinched him, and Draco turned, so they were crowded into each other’s space, the air buzzing the way it always had before they launched into a fight. “Why did I tell you all my war crimes?”
It wasn’t one of their cleaner fights: there was wrong-colored hair in his eyes and Harry was forced to swing out blind with his elbows. Draco shoved him again, and this time Harry went down hard on one knee. He headbutted Draco in the stomach and pulled him down too, Draco’s hand fisting and yanking in Harry’s hair even as he fell. Then they were a tangle on the ground, mud and punches flying until everything hurt and Harry could barely see a thing
“Guys?” He made it to the door, feeling a little uneasy at interjecting himself. But Ron looked up, eyes red, and opened his arms. Hermione watched as he climbed in, shifting herself so he could sit between them in the giant claw-footed tub. Water sloshed out onto the floor behind him, and he could feel the warmth of it soaking through his robes, then his sweater, then his shirt and jeans. The three of them sunk into each other in the way they always had, like when they were eleven years old and huddled together underneath the Invisibility Cloak. Hermione looked like she’d been crying, too, and Ron’s knuckles were raw.
He didn’t want to. It felt like a loss just to pass his wand over the white-gold hair, rendering it a soft and nondescript chestnut. Draco still looked too good to him, too likely to stand out for his fine bones and the long lashes that were still squeezed shut. So Harry tapped his nose, turning it more into something like Pansy’s, and pushed lightly on Draco’s face until it pushed back, wider than before.
“It’s not as crazy as it sounds,” Harry argued, although he knew it was. “My friends said the same thing, that I was obsessed—” and
, and he’d do the hard work of keeping him and his weird old house, whatever it took.
There had been moments over the summer that Harry had wondered if he’d ever have the feelings he’d had as a young teen, lusting over Ginny and Cedric and Fleur Delacour. If his desires had been too muted from the Horcruxes and the trauma and the years without enough sleep to ever feel the way you ought to about a person. When he hadn’t been able to make it with Ginny, he’d thought he’d blown his shot at being with somebody that understood him. He’d been fine with that, even, to a degree. Wanting more than being alive seemed selfish, when so few people had been left with their lives. Wanting joy, desire, heart-hurting fondness and a lust that bordered on painful… it was more than Harry would ever have asked for.
Hermione’s small assigned flat was on the outskirts of the small village, closest to the path to Hogwarts but situated at the end of the main cobblestoned street. It sat above a magical milliner’s, just a block away from the Madam Puddifoot. Strange to think an awkward date with Cho had once been the ultimate difficulty in Harry’s love life.
The tray settled onto the obliging footstool, the plates stacking themselves on top, scooting over for the wine and its corkscrew. Harry checked the temperature of the water, which was hard to reach underneath mounds of silky, almond-scented bubbles, and took a deep breath before he peeled his boxers back down his legs.
He also knew he hadn’t misplaced his wand. And he knew no one else had entered the house.
“Okay,” Draco agreed, sounding cautious but determined. “I’ll make a list.”
If their plan worked, he could lose this.
a next thing.
Ginny snorted. There was dirt on her face, rubbed there from her wrist. He thought about wiping it away, about kissing her, but didn’t.
Harry had gone to bed early, exhausted by all the magic and sweat and catharsis. Somehow in the fixing of things, he’d forgotten about what was broken — who had just died, how
That was enough mental complimenting of Malfoy - Harry kept talking, if only to process his own feelings. “It was awful. We - me and Hermione - we took Ron home. To the Burrow, that’s their house. It’s weird not to go too. Hermione and I always spend a part of the summer there. They always say I’m family, but it’s weird, with Ginny.”
“Or he knew I couldn’t hack it, more likely.” Draco swooped a scoop of bubbles into his hand to distract himself and began piling them onto Harry’s head, going back for more and more until a smile threatened to take over the haunted look on his face. Harry tipped his head back and allowed it.
“Hey.” He dropped over the back of the couch, sliding down so that he bumped into Draco before settling into place. Draco turned his lingering smile over to him.
The rug reared up to trip him, solidly, on his face.
“Well, I can’t speak to the dining rooms,” she said, finally putting her quill down. “I didn’t get the full tour.”
“It’s not that, I just… you're as determined and stubborn as he is, so if both of you want something, then anything can happen. Even being happy”
“Part of me feels like I should be out looking for him,” he tried to tell Ginny later. The other Weasleys had given them space outside, and he was pacing the lawn with her, looking for gnomes. The summer sun was up late, giving them a window of golden light and shadow that felt out of time.
“What, exactly, are you accusing Mr, Potter of?” Shacklebolt asked mildly, and Savage seemed to shrink.
The Aurors took up a whole floor, and once they arrived Harry realized he recognized it. An enormous bullpen took up most of the space, a warren of cubicles littered with floating pot plants and stuck-up posters of moving criminals. Doors all along the walls lead to Robard‘s office and interview rooms, with a break room and bathroom along the far corner.
“Let’s go inside,” Draco suggested, eyeing Harry in a way that made him feel transparent.
“Harry.” Hermione looked up at him - he had jumped to his feet without realizing, his heart in his throat.
“Used to have,” Harry allowed, and sloshed forward to show Draco the rest. “This one’s from a cursed necklace.” He pointed to the ugly burn that the Horcrux had left on his sternum. “This arm caught some damage from Quidditch,” he tilted it, showing the white nicks across his elbows from shoving back Bludgers. Next he lifted the side of his lip, showing the hasty repair across some of his gums, scar tissue from the day that Hedwig died that he still ran his tongue across daily. “Knocked some teeth out falling off a flying motorbike, here.” He caught sight of his own hand when he pulled it away, and twisted his wrist to show Draco the
Molly had disappeared, and they were alone with the redheaded portraits that lined the entry to the Burrow. Harry glanced around, seeing the lookalikes to his adopted family that he’d grown familiar with over the years. Great-aunt Marjoram winked at him, her face Ginny’s but her ample curves Molly’s. Harry blushed and looked away.
After dinner Draco watched Harry clear up, not offering to help, which was hardly surprising. He disappeared for a few minutes, emerging with a bottle of ancient-looking whisky that hadn’t been with the alcohol that Harry had seen before.
Draco misread his nervous energy, squinting at him before he ventured to ask “Are you thinking of going back to Grimmauld now?”
“He is fucking stupid.” This was aimed at Hermione now, although Harry could tell it was for his benefit. The anger that he’d built up at the Manor kicked back in, this time aimed at Ron, at Hermione’s helpless shrug.
“Perish the thought,” was Draco’s instant reply, but there was no heat in it.. He bit his lips as Harry came closer, shut his eyes when Harry’s wand brushed his cheek. “Just...make me look different.”
“Yeah.” A part of Harry didn’t like anyone knowing, had wanted to keep this thing between them precious and safe inside the walls of the manor. But Draco needed more, he deserved more, than being trapped in his home with Harry. And it was… nice, he thought, to put it out into the world as a true thing. He was sick, so sick, of secrets.
“Engorgio,” he murmured, and the armchair widened, allowing them to lean back together, curled up like a set of puppies in one exhausted pile. Harry didn’t know what else to say, and Draco didn’t volunteer anything. He just tucked Harry under his arm until the fire burned out, and they were left in the dark.
Harry let him come back slowly. He knew when they went back inside, they’d have to change, face the rest of the day. He’d have to start thinking about Ron and Hermione and what he was going to do with his life, about Ginny’s departure, about how his friends were going to disappear into new jobs and relationships and cities.
“Auror training?” How had he forgotten about Auror training? “Did you sign up?”
She had pushed them all to one side now, though, and was stress-laundering more of Ron’s things in case he needed them sent. Harry hadn’t reminded her that Ron still had most of his possessions at the Burrow, recognizing her need to keep busy, and had merely found Hermione’s mobile to order in some Chinese.
“Ugh,” Harry said, with feeling. “You lot will have twins by the time I’m out of here.”
right, I’ll always be a Malfoy. And I need your help with everything, I’ll owe you everything, again.”
“You don’t want to hide anymore?” Maybe this was a part of the dream. It was something he’d wanted, yes, which was even more of a reason not to trust it. “What do you want?”
“Oh. No, I—” Draco turned, then pulled out his wand to Vanish the detritus on the enormous countertop. Harry came closer, caught Draco’s wrist, took it in.
They’d told a dozen people, and let Ginny invite the rest: it was officially her and Dean’s party, although Harry was sure that people were equally coming to see the house. It put a knot in his stomach, opening it up, but there was a savage, immature satisfaction in knowing that Draco would be fretting and hiding and feeling the same way.
“Shh,” Harry repeated, and squeezed Draco’s hand to shut him up. Draco swallowed his words and jerked his head around, eyes wide on Harry before the screen darkened again. Half-embarrassed, Harry let his hand go.
The kitchen was enormous, vaulted and floored with tile that sucked the heat from his bare feet when he toed his shoes off. But it felt less intimidating when Harry started to fill it with cooking smells, onion and curry powder and mustard seed sweating together until he’d put together a half-decent vindaloo. He found a German wizarding beer that looked wildly expensive and opened like champagne, and carried everything to the front door on impulse.
Harry shook his head. Only Luna could be held captive in a relative’s home, call it
Draco shook his head, though. He started reaching for another pillow, and Harry stood up, leaving the room so it only got him in the back.
Draco had cleaned up after some of Harry’s messy renovations, but he’d left the koi inside, and they vanished the floor to dip their feet while they sipped the rest of their coffee. It was a weird sort of feeling, casual companionship from Malfoy as though they were sitting in some shared common room, but Harry appreciated it, after the day before.
.” Pansy dropped Harry’s arm and hugged herself, staring straight into his eyes so he couldn’t avoid the weight of her gaze. “I’ve been working my tail off to stay distracted, joining the do-gooder team so I could finally be useful somewhere, missing him every day. You have no idea what it’s like to have someone like Draco ripped away from you, but you’ve been hanging out with him in secret and I want to know
Ron was as upset as Harry had ever seen him. His face matched his hair, both flaming red with the anger he was currently directing at Harry. Harry had intended to go over to talk about his hesitance, his doubts and fears. Instead he’d walked into the Burrow, hugged Molly, and announced that he wasn’t joining the Aurors. That’s when the yelling had started.
The last time Harry had seen Draco, he’d been fleeing the battle with his parents. At the time Harry had been enraged. The Malfoys were cowards, he’d thought, all of them unwilling to stand and fight even for the Lord they claimed to love. Maybe he’d been staring after them angrily moments before the other Death Eater had killed Lucius — it couldn’t have been long after. In the clashing, confused timeline of that final day, everything tended to get mixed up in his head. Fighting. Dying. Returning. Voldemort, dead on the ground. Hagrid, weeping tears the size of marbles. Malfoy’s white-blond head, disappearing against the tides of that mass of evil.
burger?”
“No, he… he wanted what the Dark Lord meant for him. He liked it best with him gone, getting all the deference without any of the dirty work. But I thought he was pursuing something for himself. For the family. For purebloods.”
“No you won’t,” Harry challenged, slamming down the kettle he’d been refilling. Water splashed his face and arms as they glared at each other, and Draco’s mouth twitched just a bit.
“I just don’t feel the need to cheat.” Harry hefted the broom in his hand, weighing the urge to huck it at Malfoy. “Unlike some people.”
Finally Draco crouched down, leaving his wand floating vertically like a candle, beaming light. Harry kneeled beside him — or tried, but Draco shoved him off-balance at the last second, sending him wavering sideways before he caught himself. “Oi!”
“I want….” He wanted to act, of course. He wanted to change things, he wanted to fix things, he wanted Draco, for Draco to stay hidden for him forever, only his, almost as much as he wanted Draco to be washed by the sun somewhere beautiful and far away and free, whether or not he took Harry with him. “I want my roti a little burnt, can you leave that one in a minute?”
Hermione.
And then he was alone in the house.
“So you do want to come back to school? McGonagall will help you sort out a new path, I’m sure. Maybe you could teach Defense.” Hermione perked up. “We could all share the flat!”
“Oh,” he realized, when Draco crossed his arms over his chest and looked away, clearly gathering his breath before he could face Harry again, “Oh, Draco.”
“I actually believe that,” Harry confirmed, before he could notice. “Here, throw it in the cart.”
Harry stared at her hard. Pansy was wan and sincere, and he wondered for the first time how hard it had been for her to declare for the Aurors, to earn a spot despite all the scrutiny that she and her family must be under. To lose two of her friends in the same month, only for one to turn up mysteriously, half-feral and keeping company with Harry Potter.
“But great food,” Harry assured him, before signalling a server to their table.
“They’d better not,” Draco said grimly, and held his hand out. It took Harry a moment to remember what to do – take it, and squeeze. “I’m ready now.”
They were his friends, but different. It was the same, only not at all. And yet Harry felt a fierce rush of joy to see them, all alive, all surviving. It was incredible to be together still, drinking and shouting and dancing to Sirius’ stash of old punk albums, wands stored safely away until it was time to keep the ice from melting in their cocktails.
Draco whooped as the chunks rained down the side of the house, leaving a cloud of dust and a pile of rubble that sent the peacocks running across the lawn. “Finally! Oh, I hated that thing. It always said I flew like a ponce.”
“Harry used the phrase ‘dating,’” she allowed, “but yes. So here we are.”
It all came back.
“Will you
“You’re such a prick,” Harry grumbled, and Draco bumped his shoulder again. “Okay. But you can’t go into the magical world, right?”
Draco caught Harry’s eye briefly next, but looked away from whatever he saw there, drawn back instantly to Pansy’s frenetic words.
“Coming, Potter?”
“I want you to come over,” he decided. “I’m done hiding. Bring everyone.”
were worried? I thought I was locked in my tomb by the world’s most feted hero, and you thought I didn’t trot out fast enough when master came home.” Draco dipped a rag in the varnish, a little more violently than necessary.
“It’s really Ginny?” Hermione was whispering, and she glanced over Harry’s shoulder at Ron, who was bustling about the ancient hob, directing heat with his wand. “Are you sure there isn’t a Horcrux in the Manor or something?”
it open, the grain in the wood shifting into permanent new pattern as it let him in, Hermione slipping right inside beside him.
Draco snorted. “No, of course not. Enchanted horses, magical breeds. But he kept some here. I used to feed them.”
“Yeah.” He watched Draco’s shoulders relaxed as he worked. “I mean, no.”
, I’m so sorry.” He was too tired, to stunned by their proximity and the need to apologize to think of anything else to say. “I wouldn’t leave you, I don’t ever want to.”
“I know.” She squeezed again and let him go, her eyes sweeping quickly over his in that way she had of seeing everything. “I’m glad you found him.”
“Besides, Ron,” Hermione continued, in a much different voice, “You don’t want to be alone with me? We haven’t had a week to ourselves in…”
“I’m more of an urchin,” Harry remarked, and Draco huffed.
Slowly, carefully, he climbed back up, and Draco reached into the pillows behind him for his wand.
Draco lifted his head, and then when he recognized Harry, his hand. Harry nodded back, waiting to speak until he’d come up to the garden’s gate. The shed was to his left, the house behind him, and Malfoy had filled a basket with aromatic greens.
There was no answer before he fell asleep.
Harry went upstairs to change, and he didn’t come back down until morning.
“It was half the house! I thought it was getting used to me.”
“Soon,” he said, and set about tasting the throat in front of him.
The awkward silence that ensued made Harry want to laugh, although he scrubbed his hands over the face and fought the urge. “Right. So. Thank you for coming over, and as you can see, Draco is alive.”
“How?” Harry wondered when Draco had been replaced by Arthur Weasley, but he definitely hadn’t thought Arthur’s curiosity was this cute.
Before they’d gone, Hermione had given Harry a fierce hug, and he’d returned it with surprise.
, Harry reminded himself, although he didn’t know why. It wasn’t like he wanted Malfoy to be alive, he just… didn’t want him dead, either. Even if the rest of the world was happy to presume him gone, Harry felt vaguely like Draco would show up at any moment to kick him out, insulting his friends the whole way.
Nothing would ever be the same.
Hermione answered the door still wearing her pyjamas, a piped lavender set that sent her hazel eyes sparkling. “Harry! You alright?”
“You mean ramekins?” Draco sounded amused. His voice was thicker and lazier, like he’d taken a pain potion. Harry hadn’t known he was in any pain. “Little ceramic ramekins?”
Harry took the morning plunge toward the ground in a cannonball, whipping the broom down and around just in time to shoot up from the air above the long grass below. He couldn’t help the shout that escaped him, the joy that the adrenaline of flying always brought his way.
“Yes.” she said almost before he could finish the question.
“Mr. Malfoy! Lovely to see you well.” the woman he’d greeted returned with just as much jovial familiarity. Had it not been beneath her to do so in public, Narcissa would have raised her brows in surprise.
her in but really, in all the commotion no one would know the difference.)
Harry put
Draco, now a lump of blankets, lifted one shoulder. Harry took that as a yes.
Hermione sighed. “People can’t Floo call from the street, which is why you need a mobile phone for emergencies.”
was surprised, not at the Sorting Hat, but at the strange sort of comfort he’d started deriving from the manor and its strange hidden inhabitant. A month ago he was throwing fits of accidental magic again, as though he were ten years old and missing out on a whole world he’d never thought to imagine. Now he was laughing again, sharing things with Malfoy, cheating at chess just to drive him crazy.
“It was Draco’s secret,” Harry answered, stiffly and still a little confused.
“You don’t owe me anything,” Harry insisted, and he meant it, but Draco shook his head.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked in the dream, but he was floating, wet white hair all around his face.
“What was that?” Hermione began to turn. Behind her, a tapestry moved.
“You want to be with me?” It sounded strange, put that way, but he was afraid to take it back.
Harry pushed Draco’s legs wider, sitting up now to rub his thumb against and into Draco, spit-soaked and straining as he worked. Harry fumbled his own fly open, watching as Draco reached for his own abandoned cock.
Draco turned around and furrowed his brow at Harry, who had fallen several paces behind. “Pixies,” he repeated. “Pixies are boring. That’s like saying I would show you the horklumps. Pixies, Potter, honestly. Come on.”
“No small feat for any of us,” Hermione pointed out, and Draco swung his head over to her, his gaze going serious.
Draco was hesitant, he could see that immediately. Afraid, even, but Harry thought that might be more to do with leaving the manor and less with the muggles. “I’ve never been,” he admitted, shifting on the grass. One of the peacocks came pecking closer, and Draco splashed at it absently. “I mean, I’ve gone to King’s Cross and the farms around here, but not their cities. Is it safe?”
?” Pansy shook her head. “It’s only been a couple of months, he never even— he’s always been excessively obsessed with you, I just thought it was only him and that he’d get over it once he sorted himself and came out but…
“Of course you did. And you played dead better than any possum.”
“That’s a ‘no,’ then, is it? Well, you’ll come round to the Burrow tonight then. We’ll pick you up first, so you’ve no excuse. You know you can’t leave me the only non-Weasley there.“
“You can’t?” Harry glanced at him, but Draco was rubbing at something on the counter beside him, furiously avoiding his gaze. He understood why: months of living like a Muggle, like a rat in the wall, like a prisoner. Not even magic to keep warm, to feed himself, to wash his clothes. Draco seemed like he’d done alright, but it was hard to know how much he’d struggled to be this bedraggled version of his normal, impeccable self.
A bicyclist went past on the opposite side of the road, followed by a taxicab. A man took the trash out from the back of a restaurant. And Draco watched it all as though it were brand new.
“That’s not it, you’re better now, I want—”
“Oh, fancy giving half the house back?” Harry crunched into the last corner of toast, getting butter on his fingers and some crumbs on the counter. He looked for a tea towel, and then Vanished them instead.
“I know.” Draco sighed up at the ceiling, and then focused — first on Ron’s face, then Hermione’s. “I am sorry. I am. I won’t make excuses for my family or for the pressure I was under — I did and said terrible things, and I never did more than wish it was otherwise. I ought to have gone to Dumbledore, or run away. I thought I was keeping my family safe, but…” he shrugged, the rest not needing to be said. He’d gone along with every awful thing that was asked of him, only to lose his family anyhow. “I was a coward. Still am, hiding here. I didn’t know what to do and I’m sorry.”
lately and even Ron understood where his warm heart was needed most.
It was almost like he was flirting. The swoop in his stomach was the same as teasing Ginny, as the adrenaline joy of jumping out the window. But that was impossible. He’d just always had a strange way with Malfoy, a methodical madness borne of parallel experience.
“Where is Malfoy, anyway?” Ron was saying now, desperate for a distraction from the dread radiating off of his girlfriend.
“Mate?” Ron said now, starting to peer around at the papers, which had flicked back into The Guardian as a woman passed by. “What is it?”
He thought about it, weighing the words that sounded mostly complimentary against a lifetime of petty bullying and not-so-petty villainy. “Determined to do what?”
“You’re not going to
The next morning he sat with a mug of tea and a blanket and stared out over the grounds. It was a good place to go crazy, he thought. Betty the peacock slept at his feet while the sun rose.
“Tell me the Manor thing,” Harry requested, voice still low.
“I bet that family tapestry would be a good place to put a screen instead,” Harry was musing, to Draco’s horror, when they reached the right stretch of homes. Grimmauld Place untucked itself from its neighbors and wrenched into view, popping up where nothing had been a few steps ago.
been feeding them, come to that? The house was still hiding its mysteries, and Harry didn’t want to risk missing the chance to discover them. “What happens if I can’t get back in, anyway?”
“I’ll try to try,” Draco offered quietly.
“Yeah, of course.” Harry nodded at the bus stop on the corner where they’d paused, its bench plastered in rain-damaged gig posters. “Here, it’s where the bus picks you up. Like the Knight Bus. But you can’t call these from anywhere so they stop here. On a schedule.”
It was strange to stand together, cooking and preparing, rustling up dinner and dessert and some hot drinks. But it was stranger still to carry it to the couch, sitting together in the mess of overstuffed pillows. Harry had gotten rid of the dining room table, and they piled the trunk he’d dragged in with plates and mugs.
“Less than nothing, but I lived in fear of my father hearing it.” Draco sighed and kicked his feet in the water. It splashed Harry a little, and he splashed back, but Draco didn’t rise to the challenge. Instead he seemed to be miles away.
Harry kissed him.
“I’m so sorry,” he said, resting his forehead under Draco’s chin to take them all in. Draco rested his cheek on top of his head, after a moment, and Harry felt him relax as Harry’s arms went around him. “I could have killed you.”
There was a bang — as though someone had dropped something.
It opened reluctantly. Harry raced upstairs, wand at the ready. His heart was thumping against his throat, the adrenaline rush of months past racing through his blood.
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said without thinking. Beside him, Draco startled. He turned to see Draco studying him, his eyes soft but surprised. “It really is.”
He didn’t respond immediately, feeling rather like some fluttering creature had landed in an impeachable delicacy, like one move would scare him away for good. He half-believed he was still sleeping, so impossible did the touch of Draco’s fingertips feel.
“Are you ready?”
TIme for some non-Malfoy time, he decided, and Apparated to Grimmauld Place.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was running the bath, hot and fragrant with the potions and lotions he unearthed in a cabinet that seemed too elaborate to sit beside a toilet, when Draco found him. Two plates, a wine opener, and a trotting footstool followed behind him, crowding in the doorway behind Draco’s ankles when he paused. “Round two already?”
“Yeah. Does this block look familiar?” They were getting closer with each step they took, approaching the corner store that Harry and Ron bought their booze in, the businesses turning into apartment buildings around every corner. “Like from when you were a kid?”
Harry’s dreams were hazy and hallowed. A door opened where there wasn’t a door, but there was, because it was magic magic magic. He was floating, he was flying, he was tucked into a bed made up of the wings of sleeping griffins. There was a hand on his forehead again, like the night he had nightmares, but this time the hand was attached to an arm and a shoulder, a neck, a shadowy face. Something beautiful as a statue, only warmer and warm against him now.
“I’d be happy to help,” she agreed, and slid upward to sit on the counter. Neville leaned against her thigh unselfconsciously, and she carded the fingers of her free hand through his hair, the other hand balancing her beer on one paint-splattered knee of her faded jeans. “Last I talked to him, you had just kissed him, I believe. He seemed afraid that you hadn’t meant it, but I presume things have progressed there as well?”
“Right, so, about that,” Hermione said, and tugged her bag into her lap. “I believe that the line of entailment can be corrected, once you’re in good standing with the Ministry, so our first order of business should be to—” She pulled a book out of her bag and kept talking, Harry filling with relief as she flipped from page to page, laying out her research. Draco scooted his chair closer to her, and soon their faces were inches apart as they pored over the spaces she’d underlined.
“You need to stop creeping around listening to people’s conversations,” he answered, without any heat.
“Oh, that’s reassuring, thanks,” Harry nodded. He twisted round — it had sounded like a window had closed somewhere upstairs. Maybe he’d left one open.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, and pressed forward to hug them over the counter.
In which I just write things to satisfy my own id.
Why didn’t Harry know more war idioms? He was truly starting to feel left out. He stood up to shake her hand. “Thanks, Legalwizard Shafiq.”
Harry returned to the manor calmer than he’d left it. He stumbled from the Floo with a package of leftovers clutched against his chest, wrapped neatly but unknowingly for Draco by Molly. Harry had felt a pang of guilt when she’d handed it to him to bring back, but he knew she wouldn’t mind feeding Draco, whatever her prejudices, if she saw how thin he was.
Draco stilled, then softened, and they pressed back into each other without any of the urgent need that had taken over them an hour before. Their kiss was soft, sustained, and reassuring to Harry in a way that he needed. He broke off with a smile. “Sorry about my hair, I tried.”
“Harry,” she said, as though he were very slow. “You just stopped saving the world, will you give it a rest?”
, but covered with “wasting my life.”
and to
He hadn’t really expected Draco to be waiting at the end of the hallway, but he checked all of the rooms anyway, and then went into Draco’s little blue bedroom.
“And what do you think?” Harry challenged, finding words at the back of the knot in his throat. He knew he was more oblivious than most, but he never grew used to the way people tended to know more than him, even about his own life.
But when he reached the flight with the bathroom, he could tell from down the hall that he wasn’t interrupting anything like the giggly bubbles he had assumed. Ron and Hermione were in the tub, alright, and together. But they hadn’t shut the door or even taken their clothes off. They were holding each other, clothes soaked through, like one had climbed in after the other in whatever explosion Harry had missed.
“Thanks, guys.” Harry glanced around at them, struck by how strange it was to have a kitchen full of Gryffindors at Malfoy Manor. There was only one way to make it go over smooth. “Shots?”
Harry was left kneeling on a bridge in the twilight, his knees burning and his nose on fire. He moved his hand through the air that Draco had left behind, breaking the Statue of Secrecy, putting himself at risk to go home and hide.
This time there was no reason not to touch each other, not to bump back and forth and snatch the Snitch back and forth, teasing and kissing and nearly falling out of the air. Hovering a hundred metres above the grounds didn’t do nearly as much to make Harry feel like he was floating as the brush of Draco’s cold fingers on his chin, the leftover tastes of fennel and turmeric that were hidden away on his tongue.
He didn’t know what it held, but he thought he was in the right place to find out.
“Stay out of my bedroom,” Harry said, for the record, though he didn’t much care where his friends banged, so long as he didn’t have to imagine it.
“Fuckers.” Anger was a feeling Harry was more familiar with, and he leaned into it. “I told them no.” Good old Ron, torn between his new employers and his loyalty to Harry, his lifelong aspiration already being overshadowed by the world’s obsession with The Harry Potter, even when he wasn’t around. Harry ached for him, though he knew Ron had a better handle on the Ministry’s imperfections than most and would handle them with the same unimpeachable diplomacy that Arthur did. “I’ll talk to Kingsley.”
She nodded. “Could be the house.”
be taught,” Draco admitted, although it sounded like he was still making fun of Harry. “It’s late, didn’t you eat already?”
Back on his belly, Harry sighed. Okay. So maybe the house wasn’t accepting him as its owner as easily as he had thought. He’d been living out of his boxes, anticipating that he’d be back at Grimmauld with Ron and Hermione in a matter of days. But if he left before mastering Malfoy Manor there was a real chance he could be locked out by its wards for good.
Draco couldn’t choke back the sound he made    when Harry licked into him, and it didn’t sound like a protest. Harry tried again, curling his tongue like a question, and Draco’s body answered in the positive. Harry glanced up to see that the rest of Draco’s face had screwed up, his face gone pink from porcelain.
“I know,” He’d seen her go over even the simplest of plans a thousand times, worrying her lip bloody as she thought loud enough to hear. She’d pulled off some incredible ones over the years, but the more complex they were, the more time she spent stressing. It was weird to be in her place, this time. “I feel like I’m fucking everything up though.”
“I actually believe that now,” Draco conceded. He stuck his hands in his pockets and stared up at the mansion. Harry could see his thoughts, the attempt to pin memories on the shapes of different towers and windows.
“Harry’s right, he needs to go,” Hermione chimed in, looking up from her list. “A week should do it, though. And then he’ll be right back, Ron. Just in time for his birthday party.”
Finally, they disappeared between two hedges at the end of the garden, and Harry let all the breath he’d been holding out at once. “Draco?”
He followed her to the new home theater, relaxing a little when her face lit up. “This is brilliant,” she said, and began hunting through his films. He’d expected her to have more of a reaction, but maybe he should have known not to expect anything predictable from her.
He felt kind of stupid, and a little like he wanted to give it back.
They didn’t come out for hours, a full morning that Harry had spent showering, tidying up, and attempting to give himself a haircut that refused to take. He thought about flying, but it didn’t feel right without Draco, like he’d come untethered from gravity alone and go spinning off into the sky. He’d wandered in and out of the library, fed the fish and the birds, and spent some serious time picking through a closet stuffed with a jumbled collection of spare armor. He’d almost assembled one entire suit’s worth, although he had somehow turned up a set of two left feet, and wasn’t sure if that was an error, an inside joke, or a sign to keep looking.
“Are you done being difficult yet?” Draco demanded immediately, and Harry’s heart curdled with a fondness that he knew suddenly that he had no control over.
“But it’s called a
“The films?”
The questions they’d asked each other, now so clearly just two ways of saying
“I can’t!” Harry smacked the counter so hard his hand felt like it become one instantaneous bruise. “I can’t, but it’s not what I want anymore, and that’s all I know. That’s all I
They were Levitating half-sealed boxes over to the fireplace, Floo standing ready. Hermione was fussing over a check-list Spellotaped to a second pile of boxes, these ones neatly labelled. They’d propped all the windows of the drawing room open, but Grimmauld was still muggy and hot from the July heat. Harry wasn’t going to miss it.
“They don’t notice that?” Draco shook his head. A few people were passing by, no one giving a second glance to the mansion that had appeared out of nowhere. “It’s like they’re blind or something.”
Finally he’d searched the Manor to the top tower, the sun going down around him from the uppermost window. He paused for a minute, trying to breathe deeply and take it in. The manicured grounds stretched on into forest, paths leading to little structures, the flowers he’d planted already in magical bloom. Snow or Betty White was by the tiny koi pond, drinking with graceful dips of their long, elegant neck. In the distance, clouds were gathering, collecting the sunset’s colors in smudges and strips. He took another breath, willing himself to relax, to go make some tea and turn in, to stop worrying about ghosts and stop going insane and stop
Somewhere between there and the seeking press of Draco’s hand against him, Harry came, the orgasm hitting so hard that he got blindsided, like he’d forgotten what was coming in the frenzied rush to get there. His mouth slipped away from their gasping, biting kiss as he tilted his forehead into Draco’s neck, which was somehow still cool against the heated sweat across his forehead. He reached down between them, but Draco’s hand was already there, moving as fast as it could with his wrist trapped between them.
“Draco?” Harry went upstairs, calling for his former enemy as if he was a lost cat. He’d finally accepted that he was being haunted, and now his ghost had disappeared.
He fell asleep on the couch, and woke up to Dirty Dancing. Sleepily, he was pleased that the Manor had started playing films for him, and dragged himself to bed, only waking once to overhear the ambient cheers of The Karate Kid.
If Draco wanted to steal his friends and let them into his secret hiding places, where Harry still hadn’t been allowed, that was progress, he supposed —although it did sting a bit.
“I thought — I would… I thought maybe you’d be home in time for tea — ”
Hermione and Molly were edging out of the kitchen now, both seeming to feel that they ought to give Ron and Harry space. Ron wheeled on them. “‘Mione! Stay and tell Harry how fucking stupid he’s being.”
“Thanks,” he said, a little dubious. He was afraid to open the box, like it would be waking up a piece of the dead to use Draco’s wand. But if he started doubting Hermione now, he’d have to shift his entire worldview.
She laughed out loud at that. “That sounded like Malfoy.”
“What’s Plan C?” Harry was picking a scone apart with his fingers. He and Draco had made a feast of waffles the night before, the manor supplying a heavy metal griddle that Draco had turned and turned with a glee that bordered on mania. “What were Plan B and A, for that matter?”
Hermione sighed. She was still standing in the kitchenette, waiting for the kettle to go off, but the flat was so small that she could carry on the conversation from her position against the counter. They could’ve spelled the keytle hot instantly, but Hermione and Harry had a long agreed that it tasted better left to a boil the Muggle way. Even though they had him outnumbered, Ron’s stance that the magical way was faster usually won out. Bit he was at Auror training, so when it was just the two of them, like it had been in the forest, they let the water boil.
His voice seemed croaky and thin, but relief poured through Harry suddenly, reviving him a little with something buttery-warm. “You’ve been here the whole time, haven’t you? Since you died.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Harry lied carefully. He glanced up the stairs, but didn’t see Draco returning yet, and could still hear Hermione’s exasperation from the other room. “You can talk to Draco all you want later on if you need to be nosey.”
He aimed his blush at the screen and waited for the moment to pass, which it did easily, as Draco was engrossed in the scene at Rick’s right away. Ilsa. Victor Laszlo. As Time Goes By, and Rick’s secret pain. The black and white and grey of the screen flickered over Draco’s altered face, casting it in monochromatic and dramatic lines. As much as Draco was sucked into the film, Harry was sucked into watching Draco watch it, glancing over as often as he watched the screen. Confessions of love, a train station in Paris, a daring escape.
And he wasn’t alone. He’d never been alone in this place, not really, and he wasn’t now. There was Draco, next to him in nebulous nothing. Draco, the long pale insides of his arms like stripes of light around Harry’s waist.
“I need—” Harry managed to cut himself off before he said
Neville had returned to Hogwarts for his final year alongside Hermione, and he was talking about how Sprout’s expectations were weighing on him. Everyone had assumed he’d train in Herbology — even Harry had, at the back of his mind. Now Neville thought he wanted to go to culinary school, or work on a Muggle farm for a while. Maybe even, and here he seemed incredulous of himself, look into Potions.
“Don’t be sorry for getting away from that idiot.” Draco brushed his pants off. “I didn’t know you knew.”
“I’ve been feeding him her leftovers,” Harry assured him, but felt guilty at Ron’s concern. Draco looked much better than he had initially, and he looked lovely to Harry, but if Ron was worried about his health, then Harry probably should have done more than bring home pain potions and flapjacks. “Once he’s safe, he can go to St Mungo’s.”
“I don’t think I’ll be caught.” But maybe that wasn’t what Draco meant. “You think they’ll attack us? I didn’t even take out my wand.”
Draco didn’t respond, so Harry knocked an all-clear onto the wall and went to tidy the kitchen. Maybe Draco was embarrassed at his reaction: he’d looked afraid enough. And he’d said
“I don’t want you to take care of me,” Draco warned, sitting up in bed now. Harry’s eyes had adjusted just enough to the dark to see the shine of his hair, the familiar color like moonlit silver. “If you come back, I don’t want to rely on you. It’s been driving me mad.”
“No, I think I’m stuck,” he continued, looking at Hermione now as Ron went fumbling off for a shirt. “The house isn’t listening to me like I thought it was. It’s almost getting worse.”
, the wiry little dog said, in Ron’s tensest voice.
real, right?” Harry asked, in the space between kisses, and it was startling to hear the rough, breathless way his own voice came out. Draco bit down on Harry’s lip, punishing him for asking, and Harry surprised them both with a reflexive half-moan. Real or no, there could be no forgetting this. No denying that it had happened, was happening, and no denying what Harry wanted next.
