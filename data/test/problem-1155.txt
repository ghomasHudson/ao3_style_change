"I feel like such a prat she was just walking to supper and something came over me," Ron said muttering into his hands.
"What do you mean wings?" Harry asked turning his head as if to see a pair of wings sprouting out of his back.
"Wait if you are adding the book why are you reducing the price?" Harry asked at the gesture which seemed so out of character for the other boy.
spell on the bats causing them to return to their normal form and land on the two knocked out Fletchers.
"We have to wait for young Heir Bone since it is her results we will be discussing," Bonecrusher said from the table having stayed there to discuss the finding the last Heir being the account manager of the Gryffindor line.
Ever since the kiss with Draco he had basically staying away from Ron due to the redhead's utter hatred of Draco. As had distanced himself from Hermione since his first turning session with the blonde Harry was now spending a lot of his time between Neville, the Weasley twins, and Draco. During their last tutoring session together Draco had been unable to stop smiling after Harry had informed him that his Patronus had changed shapes from the Stag into an eagle owl. It seemed that just like Snape Draco, while never having cast a Patronus before their last session, knew about what the change of Harry's Patronus meant. This had lead up to Draco being the one to kiss Harry, after asking permission. Harry agreed to the kiss having found the phantom press of Draco's lips to his won seemed to fill his mind since he had kissed the blonde last time.
"Yes the pillows in this place are fantastic, very comfortable,' Harridan said as he snuggled into Draco's body producing a chuckle from his Mate.
Hagrid got a little upset when he heard Madam Pomfrey take points away from Draco, sure he had been hurt by his own actions, but the student had confessed and as it had happened when he was in detention with Hagrid it should be up to Hagrid to give or take points for it. When the Hospital Wing fell silent after she had taken the points away Hagrid had had Hermione sneak a peek into the room knowing that due to his size he would be more likely to get noticed if he had done so. When Hermione informed him that Madam Pomfrey was checking out Harry again rather than a student she could actually help the Half-Giant was furious. He wanted to follow Albus's orders and escort Hermione and Neville back up to Gryffindor Tower but he was unwilling to let a student be in pain longer than they need to be. He also knew that if he sent Hermione and Nevile alone they might be found by Filch and get into trouble for "sneaking out of detention." Hagrid would have called for Snape who as Draco's Head of House could deal with Poppy's attitude but seeing the man's reaction to Quirrell/Tom he did not think the Potions Master would be free for a while. Balling his hands into fists, Hagrid made up his mind as he headed back into the Wing. "Poppy, stop fussing on H'rry and help Mr. Malfoy," he said his voice almost sounding like a thunderclap due to his anger at the woman.
"Yeah um, Dad, he told me during our dreams that he had no contact with anyone from our world until... Hagrid wait I knew that how did I not see that before," Draco mummer to himself.
"Until our next meeting then," Vansel said heading to use the Floo in the now-vacated Healer's office.
"Well I guess in my First Year my friends and I thought it was you going after the Stone, and when we tried to tell Professor McGonagall she dismissed it, and with Professor Dumbledore gone, we thought we had to move quickly before you got hold of it. Second Year it had to be me for as you and Draco basically revealed during the Dueling Club's single meeting I was a Parselmouth and would be the only one to get to the Chamber. In the Third Year, we did not really plan anything but events just carried us along. All we had really planned to do was comfort Hagrid for what we thought was about to happen to Buckbeak. And things just took off from there with the Time-Turner and everything. Also if you think I ever wanted to take part in that blasted Tournament you belong in St. Mungos' memory ward," Harry said as he suddenly realized he had been pacing for a bit. Looking over at the Potions Master Harry was sure he was about to be called arrogant again only to see Snape had slipped into his chair looking pale.
"Then I offer you thanks," he said shocking her. "We have been trying to reach Heir Potter for years but our owls keep being sent back. We tried to reach him last year when he arrived with Mr. Hagrid," the goblin said shocking Charity for there should have never been any reason Hagrid of all people should have been with a student to bring them into the Magical World. "But they left before I could reach them."
The pair spent the rest of the day discussing things that were not in the protocol book*. This included a full account of the running of the Wizengamot which the book barely covered. Draco explained that the only people who can take part in the Magical Body had to be considered a Lord or Lady thus Muggles would never be able to vote in it, though could still submit laws and reforms to it if they wished. Harry thus learned that the part was made up of four groups known as the Light, Dark, Neutral who were more evenly matched, and finally, a minority group called Creatures whose members all had Creature Blood in their lines. Asking about this from the blonde Harry learned that some families went through an inheritance when they reached a certain age that rather than just unlocking their full Magical Core would give them special talents based on their creature. Draco also explained that while the three main parties were named for the types of Magical Cores a person could have that did not necessarily place a person in one of the groups due to their core. He gave an example of his Mother's family who was known to have Dark Cores but had been members of the Gray Party until the last Lady of the House had died while her children were either missing or imprisoned leaving no one to claim the family seats. "Or at least that is what should have happened. My mother could have claimed them due to her being born a member of the Black Family, but when she tried to she had found them blocked somehow," Draco explained.
"Thanks, Harridan," Pansy said smiling at him as she nuzzled Luna's neck as the blonde girl sat comfortably on her lap.
"I hate to ask but do you know anything about Hermione?" he asked fighting down a lump in his throat which had for once nothing to do with the girl's scent.
Charity flipped through a couple of pages in the notebook before finding the answer.  "As the Contract is illegal it already not valid, however, if say one of the parents or guardians sets up a new contract.  The example I found mentions the parents not having a Contract themselves and end up getting divorced.  A person will either have to turn to the Goblins for judgment on the Contracts or Lady Magic herself," Charity read from the book.
"There is no one here by that name. You leave my family alone or I shall call the cops," the man growled out his large bushy mustache twitching.
"I am sorry my Blue Jay I keep forgetting," Draco said giving Harridan's forehead a quick kiss "it would not be in any books for they could be picked up by anyone and this is one of our most guarded secrets. Do you really accept me as your Dominant Mate?" Draco asked a hint of fear in his voice that Harridan had never heard there before.
"Oh Neitherworld's Great Arch," Mr. Malfoy said. "I don't know what is worst that the person who was sent to help you get your supplies was the Groundkeeper or the fact that you are missing almost half your books for your classes. Can you tell me who you had been living with Heir Potter?"
"I actually have something else," Severus said deepening their shock for he barely spoke up in meetings, let alone bringing up two issues right off the bat.
"What about the students that were with her at the time?" Albus said thinking quickly that he could get Harry into detentions with his pawns and put some of the spells back in place.
"Well he's a prick, but I am my own man if he does not like that I prefer males," Draco said as if giving a preview of how he would tell Lucius Malfoy that he liked Harry. "I can always move out."
It felt like Harry's heart had exploded. he couldn't breathe for a second. "Draco, you’ve made me the happiest man in the universe. I love you too." He brushed Draco's cheek, and Draco brought their lips together. It was a slow but passionate kiss that left them both gasping for air. Draco moved Harry's legs so he could straddle Harry's thighs. Harry felt Draco's erection bush his leg and it turned him on even more. Draco started kissing and biting Harry's ear, making Harry moan.
It took a minute but Draco calmed down and finished his story. "I didn't even have time to reach Scorpius who was screaming in pain on the floor. He was back on top of me choking the life out of me, while my son watched."
The man turned and elegantly sat down on one of the couches while Harry stopped about five feet away.
"He's not your husband anymore!" Harry finally lost a little bit of his temper, "And you're never going to see him again."
"You will come back to me. I know you will." Draco kissed Harry and hugged him tighter. "You're my brave Gryffindor. You can do this!"
"Teddy." I giggled as he squeezed tightly around my neck. My eyes never left Draco who had the most amazing smile I had ever seen plastered on his face.
"Roll onto your stomach." Draco said as he accioed something Harry didn't quite hear. He did as he was told without saying a word because he was exhausted. He felt a quick cleaning spell the something cool and soothing being tuned onto the stinging flesh of his butt. Draco then laid down next to Harry and pulled him to his chest again.
"Merlin, you make me the happiest man on earth." He whispered again. I cupped his face and pulled him to meet his gaze.
"Harry just try it. I want you to be able to see photos of the kids." Hermione begged. Her and Ron were just getting ready to leave after dinner. "What's so good about Instagram? You can show me pictures through Facebook." Harry said rolling his eyes. "Facebook to crowded with negativity. Instagram is much easier to use for browsing videos and pictures. Please, just get it. You'll like it I promise." She said as she put on her scarf. "Fine, I'll think about it." He gave her a hug and they finished saying their goodbyes then he was left in his quiet empty flat. He laid in bed, browsing YouTube for a while, watching random music videos he'd seen a million times. He started to get bored though, so he decided to give in and check out Instagram. He signed in and immediately found Hermione and Ron's pages. Hermione's was filled with pictures of the kids and random old picture of authors she liked and Ron's was mostly goofy selfies and cars he thought were cool since he couldn't post stuff about quidditch, being a muggle app. Harry continued scrolling for an hour, finding friend and other pages to follow. He was watching a video from Good Mythical Morning's page when something caught his eye. In the friends you may know section was a picture of a sexy blond with beautiful grey eyes, shirtless and holding a giant gold colored tabby cat. He stared at the guy for a while think about how familiar his face was and how sexy he looked. He nearly dropped his phone when he read the name of the page, Draco_Griffin. How did he not recognize his rival?! Worse, how could he find him so damn sexy!? He gathered himself and clicked on the page. There were a few selfies that Harry would be ashamed to admit turned him on a little bit most of the pictures and videos were of this big gold cat. He found the one that was the profile picture and read the text. "I may be sexy, but no one can resist griffin’s sexiness. #lovemyboy." Harry laughed at griffin’s chunkiness, and kept scrolling.
Draco collapsed to the bed and pulled a shaking Harry to his chest. "Are you okay, Harry?" He whispered while holding him close.
"Take him down stairs." Miguel said to his thugs. They grabbed Draco and drug him out of the room and down a flight of stairs where he was thrown into a small cell. The cell was dark and contained only a small bench and a bucket.
"Yes." I said picking out some clothes for him. Something about doing these little things for him filled me with joy.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's body, pulling him to his chest, while still inside of him. "I love you Draco." He whispered in his ear.
Unexpectedly to Harry, Draco moved and straddled his lap. He was too afraid to scare Draco off so he kept his hands on Draco's sides. Draco ever so slightly tightened his grip on Harry's which caused Harry to moan. Harry's moan made Draco lose control for a minute. Their kiss morphed from sweet to something more sexual and hungrier. Draco's tongue managed to find its way into Harry's mouth and Harry let him have dominance. Harry's hand slid its way down to Draco's arse and pulled him in closer so almost every part of them were touching.
"Ugh, Fine. I got us both an appointment to get matching tattoos." I pulled the drawing out of my pocket and handed them to harry. He gasped.
He was scared to ask, but he wanted to know how someone could make Draco Malfoy afraid of his own shadow.  "What did he do to you, love?"
"Hi, Draco." Harry said. Draco sat his glass down and stood from his chair. He swaggered towards Harry and paused, staring intimidatingly at him. In a swift motion he pinned Harry to the door by his wrists and brushed his ear with his lips.
" Draco, I think you make me happy." Harry cliched his face blushing at how corny that sounded, but if only he could have seen how big Draco was smiling.
"Fuck." Harry said as Draco's words went straight to his cock, making it throb and ache with need. He reached around, pulling Draco closer and started teasing Draco's hole by slowly inserting his finger. Draco moaned and placed his forehead against Harry's. He then reached between them and gripped both his and Harry's cocks, stroking them in time with Harry's finger.
"What the hell’s going on between you too?! I saw him kiss your fucking hand and now you're talking about him cumming inside of you and putting you on your knees? What the fuck Harry?!"  Ginny threw her duffel bag to the floor with a loud thud.
Reaching up, harry pushed his fingers into Draco’s mouth and he sucked the greedily till they were wet enough for harry to slowly slide them into Draco’s tight hole one at a time. Draco moaned louder with each one.
"Yeah especially for Teddy. I'm basically his father now and he hasn't seen me in six months." Harry said as they entered Draco's flat. "You're okay with me having a kid then?"
Draco slowly sat the bottle down and started to shake. Harry wrapped him in his arms, "Baby you don't have to tell me if it’s too much."
"How in Merlin’s beard did you get here?!" Harry exclaimed calmly so he wouldn't scare the cat the was now purring in his arms.
He reached around and gripped Draco's ass which caused Draco to move forward. They're hard cocks brushed against each other. Harry wasn't expecting that so he through his head back and let out a loud moan.
Soon the headmistress decided she wasn't going to wait much longer and started to make the announcements and begin the sorting. It wasn't until the last first year had been seated that the doors of the hall were flung open to reveal a broad shouldered, raven-haired man with eyes so green they caught Draco's attention from the opposites side of the room. His stomach began to fill with butterflies, and he felt his breath catch in his throat, as the Man made his way to the Professor's' table
It was almost 4:30 when his phone went off with the text from Miguel. it read "7 o' clock. 12 Grimmauld Place.
"You better stay! I haven't gotten enough of you yet, and you leave tomorrow." Draco replied as he turned and wrapped his arms around Harry.
"Everything will be okay, my love. I'm always here for you. Why don't you relax and I’ll make us some lunch?"
"I didn't know you could cook. That sounds great. Can I at least put a shirt on though?" Draco begged.
Sunday, Harry said goodbye to Teddy, and Monday morning arrived fast. Harry did his digging like he said he would, and he didn't like the outcome.  Ommin Coventry had been released from Azkaban. Not only that but he had managed to slip through the cracks of the ministry. No one knew of his whereabouts. Harry didn't know how to tell Draco.
Draco turned his head in refusal, but he was smacked hard. Miguel took his wand out and placed it to Draco’s neck "suck!!" He yelled as he pressed his dick to Draco’s mouth. Draco opened and began to suck reluctantly. Miguel began to fuck his face rough and hard. Going deep into his throat and making him gag. He soon pulled out and came all over Draco’s face.
"if I do or say anything uncomfortable or too painful you can say the safe word. The safe word is snitch. Repeat that to me."
"I'll need his wand back as well. I assume you have it." Harry said calmly. Miguel slowly reached into a drawer, pulled out the wand and handed it to Harry.
"Hi, what’s wrong?" Draco asked immediately noticing something was wrong with Harry. He began to get scared.
The morning light that streaming from the bedroom window flooded into my eyelids and I began to stir. I clenched and unclenched my fist trying to figure out why it hurt. Then all memory of last night hit my brain like a truck. I opened my eyes and was becoming aware of the warm puffs of air fluttering through my hair, and the strong arm under my head.
After Hermione found out she forced me to see both a wizard mind healer and a muggle psychiatrist, but all the sleeping pills, dreamless sleep potions, and healing spells in the world couldn't help me. Maybe I didn't deserve help. I deserve to relive the memories every night. Cursed by their spirits for the rest of my life. On second thought maybe, I don't deserve life.
"Come in." He froze for a minute at the sound of the voice that came from the room. It sounded so familiar. He slowly opened the door to reveal a large room with a beautiful four-post bed with velvet curtains, what he assumed was a bathroom to the left and a small sitting area in front of a mighty fireplace. Sitting in a high backed arm chair drinking a glass of what Harry assumed was fire-whiskey was a man dressed in a completely black suit with long platinum blond hair wearing a shear lace mask that hid his eyes.
"He found me at work, today." Draco cried. Harry was furious but he did his best to hide it so he wouldn't scare Draco. He took Draco into his arms and stroked his hair.
"Mm good! how about you go take a shower? I'm going to go call into work and make us some breakfast."
"Go slower." Draco nearly whispered as he stared at Harry's naked torso. He would never admit it but he was painfully hard. He had never been this turned on by one of his clients before. In fact, he'd normally have to really think about it in order to get hard, but with Harry, just the sight of him on his knees could send Draco over the edge. Good thing he had mastered his control over his body.
"Only to you, baby." The pet name made Draco smile. Draco sat on the counter and watched Harry cook. He had never had a lover cook for him before. Then again, the only other lover he had outside of school was Blaise, and he was an asshole. He was always the giver and Blaise were always the taker. There was no balance. He started to think of all the things he wanted to do for Harry, and how Harry would be worth giving everything to. He was so deep in thought he didn't notice Harry was almost done cooking.
"Please... I need...more... I need you.... Please I need you inside me." I moan against him and pulled myself up his body. I dug around in hi side table till I found his lube and giggled at the fact that it was vanilla flavored.
Three weeks after the back to school dinner Draco was on his way to collect herbs from Professor Longbottom when he turned a corner and crashed into someone, making them land on top of him. He could feel how firm and strong the body was and instantly knew who it was. His eyes went wide and caught the gaze of the bright green ones that had been haunting him for days, "H-harry?" He whispered.
"Harry!? You can't let him hurt Daddy anymore!" Scorpius turned from his dad's shoulder to Harry's. "Please!?"
Harry paced outside the club for thirty minutes trying to think of a plan. He decided his best bet would be to meet Miguel personally and hope he would lead him to Draco. He finally stepped inside the Underground. It was loud and there were male strippers everywhere giving lap dances working the pole and some dancing in cages. He looked at each one’s face hoping to see Draco but none of them were him.
"They're not your family, they're mine!" Ommin said as he went to take a step toward Harry. Harry grabbed his wand and pointed it to his throat.
Harry saw that Draco was about to cry, so he got up and wrapped his arms around the taller man. Harry saw Draco flinch, but then he melted into the hug. The hug made Draco's tears roll down his cheeks
"I hope those are your hand prints" Draco giggled. Harry just hummed in response, “You have two flour hand prints on your ass dear."  Draco laughed as harry went in a circle trying to see the mess on his butt. "I'll get it." Draco said brushing Harry’s arse off.
"Since you were in my dreams all night long, and pretty much since the day I met you." Draco whispered seductively.
Harry wrapped him in his arms and kissed his head. "Draco, I promise, with me around that'll never happen to you again. I care too much to ever hurt you." Draco just nodded. Harry lifted his chin so he could look him in the eye.  "How about we just do this slow. Let me earn your trust. I won't do anything you don't want to do, just please let me take care of you?"
"Harry, I don't know if I love you, I’ll say it when I'm sure, but I know I have strong feelings for you."
When the time came to leave, he told Ginny he was going out with some coworkers and apparated to a wizard pub, where he cast a glamour that changed his face shape, hid his scar, and made his hair reddish brown. Then he apparated to the night club.
"What are we?" He blinked a couple of time and sat his book down. I sat up, so I could see his face better.
"Nothing, your just such a dirty boy." I said before pulling him in for a deep kiss letting our tongues dance again while I slicked up my cock and pressed its head against his entrance.
I'm sorry I didn't wake you up when I left. I'm not good at saying goodbye. I already can't wait to see you again. I'll just come straight here when I get home late on Tuesday. I hope you'll wait up for me. If not that's okay. I'll also call you whenever I get the chance. There's just one thing I need to say to you, Draco. I love you with all my heart, and I always will. I wish I could have said it in person, but like I said I'm bad at goodbyes.
"Well right now I'm going to take care of you." Harry said as he waves his wand and the bruise magically disappeared. "Now I’m going to go pick up dinner. You go relax, and I'll be back soon."
"You just called me 'Harry'" Harry said still smiling. Draco's cheeks turned pink again. "I love making you blush, its cute."
"That's amazing!" Harry exclaimed. He was quite impressed by how much Draco had changed since they're school days. What once was a spoiled, outgoing prat was now a shy and kind man.
it was only a few hours till 4 so Draco did his hair and got dress in a baby blue T-shirt and some dark denim jeans. He decided to leave the house early knowing harry wouldn't mind, and Soon he was standing in front of 12 Grimmauld Place. He approached the front door, but before he could knock, he was pulled inside, pushed up against the way and kissed passionately.
Harry's shook his head. Surely, he couldn't have been talking about him. He followed him over a week ago! He couldn't be talking about him, but what if he was? What if Draco liked him?! Did he like him back? A loud voice in his head practically shouted at him "fuck yes you do!" Harry shook his head and went to bed.
Draco ran his hand along Harry's back as he moved to be behind Him on the bed. He gripped Harry’s arse cheeks and spread them so he could get a good view of Harry's hole. He placed his thumb over is and teased it. Harry moaned and pushed back. Draco lifted his wand again and did a quick cleaning spell to ensure Harry's insides were clean then accioed the jar of lube from the bed side table.
"You're so tight." I said as I bit his shoulder. I took every ounce of control I had not to start thrusting.
"I'd love to go! It’d be great to catch up!" Harry said excited to spend some time with Draco. He saw Draco smile a little but try to hide it."
"Why do you have to be so irresistible?" Draco asked letting his dominance slip just a little. Before Harry could say anything, he felt something being inserted into his ass. He moaned as it pressed against his prostate perfectly. Draco stood and pulled up Harry's pants.
"Give me a second! Holy Shit! Is it the end of the world or something!?" I yelled again as I approached the door and flung it open.
"I was, but there was a certain man that wouldn't get off my mind, but I could never have him so I tried someone else, liked it more, came out as gay, and, of course, got divorced. Now I don't have time for the dating game, being the head auror, so I hire escorts. It's terrible I know but it gets lonely. You know?" Harry replied.
"Yes master." Harry said as he turned and bent down so Draco could have a good view of his arse. Draco had to bite his lip to keep from doing anything to rash. Luckily Harry was turned around so he couldn't see it.
"Thank you so much Draco." She said into my lapel. I just returned the hug and nodded my appreciation.
"Draaaco? Where are we going?" Harry whined as we walked down the busy Streets our fingers intertwined as we watched Teddy ahead of us. Laughing every time his head turned to check out some girl.
Draco couldn't help but think how weird it was to not see the whole golden trio together. His stomach turned a little as he wondered where Potter might be at this moment. He knew he had become an Auror, but he had only seen him once after the war. At his trials to be exact, where Potter had helped him plead not guilty. After, they never spoke again, and Draco secretly regretted it. He really wanted to apologize and thank the boy... well the man, now.
After I rushed to throw my suit on, and probably did my hair in record time, I joined them in my sitting room.
"Shhh shh baby. Its ok. I'm here, you're safe my love." Harry whispered as he wrapped his arms around Draco and stroked his hair.
It caught Harry off guard and he almost fell over from shock. "Ginny! You scared the hell out of me!" He shouted as he caught himself on the door frame.
"Good." He smiled and kissed my forehead, "I hope you’re hungry. I've really out done myself this time."
"Okay! Sounds like fun!" Teddy hurried to his room and quickly put his stuff away. "Ok I'm ready!" He shouted as he ran down the stairs.
The bartender brought them their drinks and Draco noticed Harry was shaking as he took a sip. He pushed the button again nearly making Harry drop his drink. He sat it on the table clutching it tightly as he tried to keep from cumming.
Harry sighed deeply, "Well I'm just not into her anymore. To be fair I don't think I've ever been as into her as I should be."
"Yeah let me just go grab my mask." Harry said as he went back into his flat to grab it. They then apparated to the party.
"What do you need Draco?" Harry's voice was husky and deep now and it nearly pushed Draco over the edge.
"Shhh, Harry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that." He whispered, his voice was deep and calming. Something I had never expected to hear from him.
The next morning Harry got up early and made breakfast he was just plating the food when Draco came down and wrapped his long arms around him from behind. The random display of affection made Harry's heart do a flip.
"Well, I'm not him, and I'll never be like him. I want to take care of you, Draco." He brushed Draco's cheek and felt Draco flinch at first but then melt into the soft touch.
As Draco turned to walk to the kitchen Harry saw the bruise peeking out from the bottom of Draco's short sleeve shirt. He grabbed Draco's hand and gently pulled him so He was facing him again. He lifted up his sleeve and revealed the bruise in the shape of a hand print. Draco looked away.
A short woman with black hair pulled into a pony tail finally walked in "Draco Malfoy?" She asked kind of loud.
"Oh yeah?" Draco smirked as he slowly started dancing backward till, he was flush against Harry. Ass pressed against crotch. Harry let out a moan as Draco ground against him.
He managed to hit 3 of them. Knocking them to the ground, but there were still way too many. He thought about Draco for a second, worried he wasn't going to make it home to him. This gave him an extra boost of strength and he was able to take out two more before he was hit by a strange curse. That flung him into the wall. Hard enough to nearly send him through it.
He shook his thoughts away and continued to look down the table. He noticed all the chair were filled except the one right next to him. Where was the new defense against the dark arts teacher? His stomach began to turn even more as he began to think about who it might be. There was only one wizard he could think of that he thought would be perfect for the job and he hoped McGonagall didn't think the same.
"Well after my father went to Azkaban, all our money was locked away and I didn't want to live on mother's money since she didn't have as much as father, so I needed a job. I decided to do what I was good at and I make very good money for it." Draco smiled.
"Thank you, so much, Harry." Draco smiled even bigger. They untangled themselves from Scorpius, letting him sleep, and did as Harry suggested.
"Well play your cards right and maybe someday you will be." Draco smiled and winked. It was the first time Harry had seen anything like that old snarky side of Draco since they met in the store and it made his heart soar. He was beginning to worry Draco would never open up to him, but this gave him hope. They went to the living room and sat down. Draco curled up in Harry's arms on the couch.
"Ok, I’m going to go get food I'll be right back. You stay sexy." Harry took Draco's hand and kissed it, making Draco blush again. Then he left to go to the shop.
"Oh, and I supposed you automatically volunteered, Mr. must save everyone." He noticed Harry's hurt expression.
"Mm, I like your way better." Harry smiled. Draco laughed. "Fuck, I love when you laugh!" Harry wrapped his fingers in Draco's hair and kissed him hard again. Pushing him back down to the bed.
"It got to the point that there was no apology afterward, but I still stayed because he made me fear him. He'd tell me things like if I left, he'd kill me or worse harm my son. He made it so I couldn't tell anybody, not even my mother, what was going on. Then one night he was beating me pretty badly, and Scorpius step in and tried to stop him." Draco broke down into a sob as soon as he said Scorpius's name. "He punched my child, and broke his jaw."
Draco dreaded for 8'o'clock to roll around. A part of him wanted to see Harry, almost craved it, but the other part of him was so scared to let somebody in. He didn't want Harry to see his weak side like he had the night before. He was now sitting in the living room, bracing himself for Harry arrival and drinking his third cup of wine.
A tear slid down Harry's cheek. He knew how my Draco loves Griffin and he knew that Draco must be a mess right now.
"Fuck" Harry whispered loudly into Draco's ear. Harry kept his hands back so he wouldn't touch Draco.
I'm so sorry you had to find me. I'm so sorry I couldn't do it. I've tried for 4 years now. I tried to be strong for you and Ron... and Teddy. .
A couple weeks flew by with a few visits from Ron and Hermione, Andromeda and Teddy visiting on Sundays, and even Mr. and Mrs. Weasley stopping by. Harry had a hard time with their visit, but we worked through it and him and I were growing closer and closer. We were basically conjoined at the hip. We even started sleeping in the same bed, not on purpose. We would fall asleep in our separate rooms, but when we awoke the next morning, we'd always be in one or the other's, tangled in each other's arms. I was unable to imagine a life without him and thinking about him leaving could bring me to tears. We weren't even officially and item.
Once they were seated and had orders a water for Harry and coffee for Draco, Harry let out a deep sigh.
Harry entered the room and closed the door behind him. As he looked at the man before him the man smirked and a light bulb went off in his head.
All this time Harry believed Griffin knew what he was doing all those years ago when he brought them together.
After walking down one of the halls quite a ways, they came to a set of double doors. The bouncer opened them and Harry stepped inside. Miguel was sitting at a large wooden desk with two gold angel statues behind him. The room was decorated in gold and red with heavy red with gold trim curtains and a red and gold sofa.
They both said their good nights and got ready for bed. As Draco lay in the dark and quiet room, he couldn't get his mind of Harry’s body. He tried to imagine what he'd look like naked. Then he felt something stir in his pant. He reached down to adjust but something felt off.  It felt more sensitive and... bigger. He couldn't stop touching himself. He slipped his hand in his pants and jumped at what he felt. He cast a Lumos and looked at what was now three engorged tentacles.
"I-it's just... I was so horrible to you, just because I wanted your attention. I cared about you so much and I just wanted to make sure you saw me. I shouldn't have been so terrible. I'm so sorry Harry." Draco cried. Harry's heart melted at the use of his first name.
In one swift motion Harry petrified both Miguel and the man who fell back ward on the floor, letting Draco go.
"This is Mr. Potter. I’d like to schedule my regular." Harry said as coolly as he could muster. Something in his stomach wasn't sitting right.
," Harry nearly shouted out and to the astonishment of Lucius, Fudge, and Mr. Weasley, Harry bent down on one knee before the blonde as his wings explode from his back.
Near the end of class Professor Snape, after making sure everyone's Cleansing Potions had been brewed correctly directed them all to drink from them at the same time to not single anyone out. After his talks with Harry during the Occlumency lessons, Severus was sure that at least two people would get scrolls to appear after they drank the potion. But he was shocked as almost half the class got them with the students looking confused at the scrolls lying before them. Clearing his throat he got their attention before he explained," Since you, all created a basic Cleansing Potion it will not have gotten rid powerful enchantments that a person could have on them as well as some potions. The scroll that appeared before some of you is a list of any and all spells and potions that you have in your systems. It will be broken down into two parts the first part being what it was able to cleanse from you while the second part is items that it was able to detect in your system but was unable to deal with."
"Well as in your memories with Draco you saw you could do things right with the right technique so I think what I plan to do with show you the other side. I take it you know a shield charm?" Snape asked.
"You know for once I think I am going to try to do it on my own," Harry said with a small smile watching her reaction.
"Well that is going to change," Draco said as he gently pushed his mate to sit on the large king-size bed before bending over the trunk. "Besides your school robes are there any clothes that you wish to keep?"
"Well, to be honest, you might be. I have not had a chance to go through the whole list of stuff that had printed out from my earlier spell. But the test I am speaking of is one administered by the Goblins which might show the reason for your Magical Coma," Mr. Malfoy said. "And since you say you were brought up by your mother's sister this test would also be a way to find out a little about your Magical family as well," he said as he led Harry and Draco out of the small room they were into letting Harry see the counter that he had first seen on his birthday months ago with the Goblins still working at counting gold and jewels as if no time had passed. The three of them stood in line for a bit before a Goblin became available.
The next day Pansy and Blaise stayed for breakfast before leaving for their homes as Draco informed Harridan that since they really had nothing planned for the day he thought that maybe they should go get Harridan some new clothes at one of the Magical Alleys.  Harridan was torn for he knew he needed some new clothes as had been wearing Draco's old clothes for the last few days, not that he minded as every single piece of clothing was swimming in his Dominant's scent and felt like a warm hug, but he also did not want to cause a scene.  Draco promised him that that was the last thing he wanted as well and stated rather than head to Diagon Alley they would be heading to one known as Trap Street*2 which like Diagon Alley was unseen by Muggles but this one was would go unseen unless one had gone through a Creature Inheritance.
The twins had been right when they had told everyone that seeing a shocked Goblin was a sight to behold as Bonecrusher's face drained of all color and his eyes bulged out of his sockets making him look like a Muggle stress ball being squeezed. There was a sound of ripping material as to stop himself from falling onto his ass the Goblins' toe-claws ripped his shoes apart and dug themselves into the ground to stabilize him a little. Meanwhile, the fine liner handkerchief had been shredded by the claws attached to Bonecrusher's fingers. "You want to pay from the Founders to give the entire school an inheritance test which family's account manager is to be in charge?"
Harry began to squirm a little under her gaze before she pulled out a very thin wand, making him think of the switches in the stories Dudley would tell him about teachers using to punish students. He filched back a little but she just cast a spell that summoned three volumes to her arms. "These may help," she said as to his surprise she gave him a small smile slipping the books into his arms. Harry was so shocked having never seen her smile before that he just nodded as he left to find a table. Not wanting to be found looking through the books, feeling a little embarrassed by it, Harry moved deep into the library and to a little-used table before he sat down to begin his research.
After sending the request for a resort to both Professor McGonagall and his Father Harridan also gave one to Lucius to pass on to the school board as well, but was surprised as the Twins asked if they could come over again with a couple of friends to add to Harridan and Draco's growing alliance. Draco wanted his mate to be protected and having a feeling that the people they chose could do that had agreed leading to the twins to visit the very next day. The were accompanied by two blonde girls one Harridan instantly recognized as Fleur and ran to see her only for Draco to let out a growl and wrap his arms possessively around Harridan and hold him close. "
"Thank you, Master Grindstone may your coffers never run dry," Mr. Malfoy said as he and his son bowed to the worker.
"Fine since no one else has shown up and it is you we shall start at the beginning," Draco said with his normal sneer "so take out your book and turn to page five."
"The war what if I don't support He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named?" Harry asked burying his face in the other's robes rather than look at him.
"Well more like one part of the session," Draco admitted shifting his gaze since he still could not move his body.
"I know that now Harry if you were full of yourself you would never have let me basically take charge of this date the way I did. Which I only did just to see how you would react thinking you would never even agree to meet me in the classroom earlier," the blonde said.
The Headmaster had failed to take in one thing in his newest plans. Due to the duel giving Fred and George control of the House of Prewett the twins had decided to get a proxy for their seats, even though they were of age, just so they would not have to leave the school for the Wizengamot meetings. As their Papa, even though he was Lord Ravenclaw, was forbidden to vote in the assembly due to being a Werewolf and their Dad, thanks to Molly's taint marking them as Blood Traitors, would be met with scorn if he tried to vote. The twins had decided to have Lucius Malfoy serve as their Proxy, they would have gone with Blaise's mom but as she was actually Italian she would also not be accepted by many British Magicals. It had actually been a little shocking as their Papa and Dad had also had Lucius serve as their Proxy as well. Lucius had been rather shocked himself knowing that Arthur and he had a rather antagonistic relationship until the redheaded bearer had informed him that one of the spells he had been under had been the cause of their feud since the Weasley and the Malfoys were actually old allies until Molly got involved. As Dumbledore had been casting the votes for both the Weasley and Lupin families, with them being handed over to Lucius as Proxy lost the Light Section four powerful lines.
"It seems according to the results of the Charm Quirinus is giving off two life signs his own and someone named Tom Riddle," Madam Pomfrey said.
"How does one use an Allure?" Harry asks thinking that if he used it might reduce the "punishments" he got from the Dursleys.
"Well, there is one pair of socks that I have a Pocket Sneakoscope in other than that no," Harridan said as he watched Draco pull out all the clothes from the trunk and put them into piles. The larger pile was all of Dudley's old clothes while the smaller was the five sets of school robes and one dress robe he owned as well as the pair of Vernon's socks containing the Sneakoscope.
Harridan stopped himself from pacing, just barely, as he waited for his name to be called after the sorting of the first years. He could tell when the last one had been sorted as the talk in the hall grew louder until Professor McGonagall made the announcement of a student requesting a re-sort before calling him into the hall. There were gasp as Harridan walked the length of the hall and took the stool, which she had transfigured into a small arm chair before she placed the hat on his head.
Inside his own mind, Harry was beginning to freak out a little from Draco's statement.  Him an Omega nothing could be worse than that.  Even having his new awaken sense leading him to Draco was not as bad as becoming an Omega.  From what he had read from the books in the library he would be forced to go through a Heat after he had awakened.  Thus it was a guarantee that he would have to experience it at the Dursleys.  He could only think of two situations neither of which were good outcomes.  His uncle would either kill him for this "new freakiness" or even more sickening is that either his uncle or cousin would take advantage of him during a Heat.  He would not put it past either his uncle or cousin to take advantage of him in such a state.  Recalling memories of when he was younger when his uncle had come into his room while drunk and had slipped into his bed.  Or some times when it had just been Dudley without his gang and he would use force Harry to jerk him off under threat of violence.  As the thoughts of being killed or raped by his family, Harry began to unknowingly release some fear pheromones.
"I guess if only to prove that we are mates without Vold.... your Papa's Soul being the cause," Harry said receiving a smile from all the Malfoys for catching himself from using the name Albus had given Tom. Soon a party was made of Harry with all four Malfoys as they headed to the Goblin bank Flooing right into the building. As Harry had only actually been in the bank twice with the rest of the time his trip to the vaults being done for him he found it strange to stand in Draco's arms as they waited for a free Goblin and then see Mr. Malfoy bow to the Goblin they were sent to. After a quick whispered conversation where Draco's Dad gestured to him a couple of times, the group was lead out of the hall and after a voyage through countless stone passages a large office with an, even to Harry's untrained eye, important-looking Goblin.
"As I just said the Medi-Witch did not collect his medical history which I only found out when I had cast a Diagnostic Charm on him and, well, got this," Lucius said as he passed over the almost seven-page document of all the injuries and illness Harry had ever had or been exposed to. Narcissa taking the document began to leaf through it her face going paler than the white areas of her two-shaded hair.
"My uncle locked them in my old cupboard under the stairs," Harry said as he started to gather the items he had been allowed to have in his room in the hopes of leaving the Dursleys.
"It is not only due to fear that people don't say that name," Bathsheda said placing her hand on his other shoulder. "You see You-Know-Who placed a taboo on that name so that he would be able to find anyone who said it which even allows him to bypass the strongest Wards and protection Magic. That was how he had been able to find many of his greatest foes in the last war before the taboo on the name became public knowledge."
loke," Harrison said putting some emphasis on the first letter to let Hermione know it was from Sirius, "who had overheard about what happened with Black trying to kidnap me a couple of days ago sending some condolences. It seems that they were not aware that I have Hedwig for they are giving me the owl as a gift, but as I don't need another owl one of you can have it."
The next issue saw Severus, Narcissa, and Lupin being officially brought in to cast the votes for Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw. Knowing that he would be unable to vote as Slytherin Head of House and Gryffindor Severus beforehand had contacted Septima Vector, who taught Arithmancy and had been a Slytherin in her time as a student, to take his place in voting for the Head of House. Albus could only grumble under his breath as the four were sworn into their new roles on the board before Minerva asked if there was any new business. Severus immediately called for the re-installment of the Apprenticeship Program, and while Albus tried to veto it he could not overturn the Founder's vote and was quickly vetoed himself. Next to his shock, Remus called forth having the Goblins come check out both Hogwarts' Wards but also Professor Binns.
"Oh hey-a," George said looking over at them "your secondary father was giving us some pointers in starting our Joke shop. He suggest rather than a large shop on the main street we scale it down to a smaller building with an attached apartment so it will be less likely that our Mum, Ron, or Ginny would find it."
After a quick supper, Harry had quickly headed up to his rooms not wanting to spend much time in the Common Room with all the females around polluting the air for him. At least according to the books once he found a possible partner there was a way to put their scent on something so he could use it to block out any other scents that he found unpleasant. He must have been more tired than he had thought for without meaning to Harry had fallen asleep before any of his friends had come up to bed. Though he did wake up a little later to hear Ron's familiar snores filling the room before dropping off again.
Lucius then led Harry and Draco back to one of Gringott's Floo rooms and took them to St. Mungos. Almost as soon as he stepped into the place he felt his wife's magic and knew that she felt his as well. Since he had not informed her about what had happened to their son he was not that shocked as she showed up while they were waiting in line to check-in. "Lucius what is the meaning of this why is Draco not at Hogwarts?" she asked arching an eyebrow at him and spoke in a voice that spoke of coming danger. Harry not knowing who she was but hearing the tone of her voice moved a little bit so his smaller form was blocked from her by Draco's larger body.
"That burst of magic. Did you do something to save Harry's life?" the girl asked a twinkle in her eyes as she took a step closer to him.
"Of course we have brothers we are speaking to them," Ginny said as those around them shifted from rolling their eyes to actually facepalming.
"Well according to Snape a Mating group should have access to a Mated Dorm room. He guesses that Dumbles prevented us from getting one ourselves. Don't worry my Blue Jay we will be together soon enough and until then we still have our dreams," Draco said giving Harridan a quick kiss.
Though when he did have his class Harry pulled out the book and used it throughout the class to make sure he prepared everything correctly. He also did his best to ignore the "help" Hermione tried to provide in making the Potion while Ron did exactly what she told him to do every step of the way. As he worked Harry had tried to figure out why Draco's book had been left off of his First Year, book list. He had at first thought that maybe due to the stories that he had heard about him being raised to know all about the Magical World it had been left off, but Draco had been brought up in the Magical World and it had been on his list. He next guessed that due to Snape's behavior towards him the man had not put the book on Harry's list thus giving him an excuse to berate his work, but this one also came to nothing when he found out none of his Dorm mates had the book either. It was if even before they had been sorted someone had decided to leave a book off their list so that Gryffindors would be bad at Potions, though how they knew they would be in Gryffindor Harry still could not figure it out.
Harridan had feared it would include blood due to the Muggle misconception of Vampires but it turned out to be a fudge brownie with bits of bacon and other meat in it.  Harridan was a little worried about the taste but after some gentle prodding from both Draco and Severus to "embrace his Vampire side" he took a bite and actually found that it tasted better than treacle tart.  Licking his lips he ordered a box to take homemaking Draco chuckled and Severus smiling having at finding they shared the like of the taste.  Since Harridan had not actually got his school supplies yet they also picked them up in-store that for once did not make a pun on the Creature status.  After they picked up his new clothes the group headed out of the alley and back to the Manor.  As Harridan was putting his clothes away in the wardrobe that he realized that when Draco had been going through his clothing when he came to the Manor he did not recall seeing his father's Invisibility Cloak.*3  As he knew it was not left at the Dursley's he knew it could only be removed when he got to Grimmauld Place.
Harrison saw a big difference between the two Elves and Dobby right away for rather than pillowcases one was dressed in a small pink suit while the other was in a white and orange skirt as well as a red and gold tee-shirt. "Um, hello," he said feeling a little awkward due to their staring.
"What are you talking about you nasty creature?" Lucus asked his smile turning into a sneer at the nasty creature who had addressed him so easily when it should be licking his boots for the honor of serving his kind.
Once the group reached the Hospital Wing Hagrid gently laid Harry in one of the beds while Hermione helped Draco into the next bed. Draco had thought that Granger. Longbottom and Hagrid would leave back to wherever the Gryffindor House was located but the three stayed behind. He found out why when after nearly half an hour Madam Pomfrey returned. The school's Medi-Witch seemed surprised to find them all inside. "Hagrid what is the meaning of this Professor Dumbledore told you just to drop off Mr. Potter and take Ms. Granger and Mr. Longbottom to their dorms?" she asked not even seeming to either notice or comment on Draco's presence in the room.
"What part?" Harry asked unable to think of anything happy or joyous in their last meeting which had just been Harry working with Draco on some spells followed by Draco directing Harry on ways to prepare Potion Stocks and then helping him stir his mixture better.
Come Saturday morning the twins felt they were both ready to put the Fletchers in their place and be well off from them at last. The night before the Headmaster had tried to throw them off showing up with the Dueling contract well after curfew for them to sign their part of it. Both had been shocked to see they had to use Blood Quills to sign but thought it was for the best for if the Fletchers tried to get close to them again they could call on Lady Magic to punish the pair which might hopefully make them get the message. The pair also wondered what winning conditions the Fletchers had come up with but as the Dueling contract, they signed only dealt with their part of the agreement they would not see what they had been up against until after the Duel. They had known the old bastard was trying to upset their sleep patterns before the Duel but as they had been in Gryffindor House before moving into the Slytherin Mated Dorms they were used to odd hours so still woke up ready and raring to go.
"I don't know I fell asleep on my bed only to wake up here," Harry said as he became aware of the scent he had smelled randomly yesterday seemed to be coming from the bed he had fallen out of.
Neville thought that it was moments like this that made life worth living as Theo petted and scratched the small animals before holding out one of his fingers letting a small blue bird, land on it giving them a small chorus of birdsong. This was another thing Neville enjoyed about being with Theo for no other person was allowed to see this sight of the pail Slytherin boy with his wings out. The golden wings looked wonderful with small patches of sunlight falling from the canopy above them, and even made gave a slight glow to Theo's black hair. Unable to help himself Neville leaned forward and kissed Theo's forehead. "What's up Nevi?" Theo asked.
"She turns the girls who share her bedroom into basic slaves inside of it, not to mention three male Lions and all you can say is "Oh, dear," Severus said snatching the pages from her lest she tries to do something with them. "I tried this the normal way but your reaction has let me no choice," he said raising his wand and calling out "Under Article 71-54-B of the Hogwarts charter I call an emergency meeting of the Hogwarts School Board."
Getting sick of the blonde not looking at him Harry placed a body bind on the other so he could no turn away and went to stand before the other. "Alright I get it if it is personal and you don't want to share what helped you produce your Patronus, but I can't help you if you have trouble with it latter if I do not know what you thought of as you cast it," Harry said crossing his arms and almost glaring at the other teen.
"The more you say sometimes Blue Jay the more I hate that man.  Yes, tested just like you should have done on your first trip to Gringotts since you had just entered our world again to help you learn more about yourself," Draco said as he stood up and pulled Harry to his feet. "Do you feel up to get tested?"
"True it would not create a bond by itself but Harry's test listed that the majority of Magical Brittian owed him a Lift Debt for stopping He-Whose-Name-Shall-Never-Be-Spoken. Harry's Account Manager told us that since both boys now have a Life Dept to each other a bond was created," he explained.
"What can you do for me are you serious?" Professor Sprout. "You call one of my students who are not yet of age, up here to meet with you and you do not tell me. Did everyone finding out about your family cause you to lose hold of your senses?"
"Wait if you are adding the book why are you reducing the price?" Harry asked at the gesture which seemed so out of character for the other boy.
"It is a Muggle expression that basically means we will just go along with everything and see what happens," Harry said.
Alright, I am Pansy Parkinson just a plane human Witch," Pansy said.  "It is my dream to produce my own line of clothing either Muggle or Magical."
After about ten minutes to prove to the Goblin Healers that the man was not somehow faking being knocked out as well as letting the mist being removed from the room, the Goblin Healers entered the room through a hidden door along with one of the walls. They immediately used some magic to strip the human out of his clothing and put him into a specialized robe that would help the Cleasing he was about to receive. Once he was properly attired they floated the blonde Lord onto the Cleansing platform and began to get to work. Every single one of the Goblin Healers and ritualists hoped this would not take as long as the one for Heir Potter having been part of that one before being brought back in time alongside the young human and his Account Manager. It was rather strange that the group was technically performing to Cleansing at the same time one to Heir Potter and now with Lord Malfoy.
"Well at the end of this school year if he has an issue with anything I am pretty sure I could talk to my Mom about letting me spend the summer at one of the properties from her line. Using the excuse that I want to show them that I can take care of myself for when I come of age."
"Sometimes that does happen," Kingsley said. "Sometimes it can shift due to new feelings for someone, coming into a creature inheritance, or various other reasons."
"Well I was summoned to Hogwarts after this student fell into an unexplained Magical Coma," Mr. Malfoy said making sure not to give Harry's name out. "When I arrived in the Medical Ward of the castle I discovered that the Medi-Witch that ran it had failed miserably at her job so I ended up casting a Diagnostic Charm on the student myself. While it showed numerous medical issues none of them explained the coma. I was hoping an Inheritance Test would clear some things up before I do take both students to St. Mungos.
"Yeah but unlike everyone else, I did not swoon over every little thing you did for good or ill," Draco stated.
"Sounds easy enough," Harry said as he holds out his left palm and closes his eyes not wanting to see the blood. He winces a little at the sound of Elmblossom's robes not wanting to get his hand sliced open.
"Well, sandwiches yes as well as simple foods but something that requires measuring items and mixing is usually only done with Potions in the Magical World," Draco said.
"Not technically true, you passed out," Draco said though Harry thought he detected some good humor in the other's voice, not scorn or ridicule.
Harry tried not to think about how good it felt to let Malfoy rock him as he took in the other's scent.  "This is the end," Harry muttered.
"I am sure he was just messing with you Ronald," his dad said. "In fact besides talking to you about your plan but I had also heard back from the Headmaster. It seems Harry had written to him and let the Headmaster know that he and his family had been on vacation and will be out of the country until the term starts. Due to where the family is vacationing Errol has been leaving the letters at his home. The Headmaster has had to stop by every once and a while to collect all the letters Harry received so the Muggles would not get suspicious," his dad said. Ron breathed a sigh of relief though tinged with jealousy at Harry getting to leave England and have a vacation and most likely buy lots of stuff. While he no longer was worried about Harry having found out about him and Hermione just thinking of Harry spending all that money made Ron want to really get closer to Harry so he could gain access to that money.
"I was not told of anything though I was told to offer you some advice the first one is to do some more research into the Hogwarts Houses and secondly was to look at all your relationships," Charity said.  Harry had already planned on doing as he was pretty sure Ron and Hermione were not really his friends.  "I was also told to be available to answer any question you might have about the Magical World."
"Is this it?" Mr. Malfoy asked taking the letter from him and flicking through the two pages inside of it.
"You may not have any problem at all Harrison. I can only assume you learned nothing of potion-making with those Muggles which means you would have to learn it from your pre-lesson for it," Draco said.
Over the next couple of days, Harry had a hard time not thinking about what Snape had shown him with his memories. At that time Harry had gotten more homework back from his classes than he had done on his own and saw in each subject, apart from History of Magic and D.A.D.A. his grades had shown a large improvement making him rather angry at Hermione for the "help" she had been giving him in each of the classes. His sudden coldness to the bushy-haired Magical did not go unnoticed as Ron asked what had happened between the pair of them. Knowing that Hermione "helped" him as well Harry revealed that the person who was tutoring him Potions, while not giving Draco's name, had found evidence Hermione had been sabotaging his work. Harry explained he had decided to test out if she had only done it to his Potion's homework or all their classes. Harry arched an eyebrow at his best friend seeing Ron did not look concerned by the news that their friend was messing with his work, even after Harry pointed out she could be doing the same to Ron. The redhead's lack of reaction raised some red flags for Harry who quickly said he had been joking and placed the blame on his moody behavior at Snape's feet due to his Occlumency lessons. This had got a laugh out of Ron who had said Harry should not joke about Hermione cheating like that.
Two weeks past and it was finally time for Harry to go to court again. He was not looking forward to it. He hoped this time they'd actually settle something instead of just push the date again.
Draco attacked Harry's neck making it super hard for him to unlock the door. Once inside Harry pulled him into another deep kiss as they kicked of their shoes, took off their jackets and masks and walked to the bedroom, bouncing of the hallway walls as they went.
"I would like to see any books on Alpha/Omega changes please," Harry said gulping a little at the small glare she was giving him.
"That really is troubling,": Pamona said looking worried. " I wonder if my students have all their books as well."
"But now Professor Snape and McGonagall wish for me to pick someone to represent Hufflepuff during School Board meetings which means it all might come out again," Susan said clenching her left fist in anger as she used her right hand to wipe some tears from here eyes. "They also made a good point that some of the better changes this year had come after the latest Board meeting, I just don't know what to do."
Lucius was not happy that when he brought his evidence forward to Madam Bones in a private meeting sharing with her not only his untampered memories of being a spy for Minister Bagnold but also the results of his test from the recent cleansing, that she went to get Vansel cleansed as well. The three of them sat down and decided that for the moment to have Lucius and Vansel act like they were still enchanted while Amelia gathered evidence against Dumbeodre. While that was in theory well and good Lucius could not let one thing stand, and that was Severus getting paid out of the Potter Family Vaults. For the man was like a brother to him and while he knew the Potions Master's complicated history with both Lily and James he could never picture the man stealing from another family's holdings. Rather than risk using an owl, or the Floo to contact him Lucius used an old two-way notebook the pair had used while they had played spy against the dark lord.
Mummy always knew Daddy would be coming back so she had set up a plan to make the world better for him teaching Hermione her place in the plan as well. Mummy had her pretend to be a Mudblood so she could get closer to Potter and make sure he stayed ignorant of the Magical World. Hermione recalled asking her Mummy about that when she was young for if Potter was being brought up as a prince as the stories went how could she make sure he would not know about their world. Mummy had laughed sharing with her some facts she had learned at the Ministry of Potter not living with any magical family in Brittian according to the census but also due to a tracker he had not left the island either. Mully had tweaker her nose playfully as she had Hermione guess what that meant and been so proud of her when Hermione guessed it meant he was living with Muggle trash like the boy's mother. Mummy had said that is why she had to pretend to be a Mudblood so she had something in common with the brat who caused her Daddy to go away. Mummy also stated that if she got close to Potter it might also lead to Dumbledore allowing her to spy on the man for her Mummy.
As Harry came to his meeting with Draco he had hidden the blonde's cloak in an inside pocket which had helped him block out any bad scents even when it was nowhere near his nose. Finding his way to the stack set aside for the bibliographies he found a table that looked so dusty his aunt would never have let it in the house. But as he got closer he saw the table had an actual Glamor attached to it, shocking him a little. "Oh don't look so surprised Harry this is a special place where Slytherins go to make deals and arrangements with members of other Houses. And since no one usually comes back here we will undisturbed," Draco's voice said from behind him.
