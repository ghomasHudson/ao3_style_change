Satisfied, Brandon turned toward the barkeep and raised a hand. “Hey, Sam! A pint of your finest ale for my new friend here.” Seeing that Sam was still entangled with the cluster of women, he called out, “Shake a leg, will ya?”
Draco’s reaction was to slow down and shift position so that he was able to pleasure himself as he kept working on Harry with his mouth. Harry felt vaguely disappointed and angled his head so he could see what was going on within Draco’s grasp, but soon decided that he needed Draco closer to him, now. “Come here,” he said, propping himself up on his elbows. “This is all so new to me, I want to see everything.”
Hermione’s brow was etched in concern, but the rising of the Wizengamot cut short any further conversation as the trial proceedings formally began. From what Harry understood about Wizarding law, there was no expectation for anyone called in for questioning to bring legal representation. The Malfoys being the Malfoys, however, had brought in someone to speak on his behalf. He suspected that money and not a love for Draco or his family was driving his solicitor, but he was impressed all the same at the care that had evidently been taken by his mother to protect Draco from his own bad choices.
Harry reveals a few new things about himself to Draco, and they revisit a familiar childhood activity together.
Retracing those feelings, Harry came to his senses with a sudden jolt of adrenaline. Dear Godric, what had he been thinking? Telling Hermione to say hello to Draco on his behalf? It might lead to all sorts of things that he wasn’t prepared for, mentally or emotionally. Or physically, for that matter. He hadn’t exactly been prioritizing his appearance since he became an Auror instructor, and suspected that he was rather scruffier and pudgier around the middle than the last time anyone had seen him anywhere near undressed.
Draco looked at him, with a calculating gleam in his eye. “Fine. One dinner. Tomorrow night, after I’m done with work.”
Harry paused mid-movement, looking toward Draco with wide eyes. “You’re joking. What about Goyle, or Zabini? Parkinson?”
Draco was dressed in a set of blood-red robes with embroidered gold flame detailing at the cuffs and hem. Somehow the color contrast made him look both paler and more tan than usual, although perhaps that was more an effect of the subtle bronzer that highlighted his angular features, with traces of glitter. His long hair was artfully arranged like a very sleek version of a lion’s mane, and he had a tiny ruby dangling from one ear.
When Harry went back to Bedknobs and Broomsticks Book Emporium the following afternoon, he was disappointed to see that Malfoy wasn’t there. He dithered about for twenty minutes before deciding to buy the book on Quidditch, and chanced a question of the clerk who helped him buy it.
Harry waved his hand away. “No, I should be all right on my own. Thanks for the beer, it was very nice to meet you.” He gave Brandon one last long look into his lovely blue-green eyes, then made his way toward the exit.
It happened quite naturally, as Draco stepped down from his seat on the broom, with one arm still wrapped around Harry for balance. A slight turn of the neck, and their faces were in a heart-stopping moment of nearness. Draco resolved the tension with a kiss. A soft kiss, one that demanded nothing of Harry, yet suggested a world of possibility.
The silence between them was tense, and by time Harry finished his milk, he was ready for some action. “Draco, for what it’s worth, here’s what I think.” He began to outline his thoughts while Draco listened, still sipping. It wasn’t until Harry mentioned the Weasley name that Draco showed any sign of disturbance, setting down his mostly empty glass with considerable force on the tray.
“The wedding or Nigel? Bored to the first, intrigued to the last. Nigel’s in a league of his own.” Again he found himself omitting a large part of the truth, which was that Nigel and his family were considered somewhat of an upset within the established Wizarding elite. Born as Wizards, but raised in harmony with Muggles, they had built their fortune upon collaborating with them rather than rejecting them as impure. Now there was a concept he couldn’t have sold to the Dark Lord if he had wanted to. Not for the first time, Draco thanked his lucky stars that the War was over. Even if it meant that he might never see his father again.
“Here, let me straighten you up a bit.” Harry worked some Poppins-level magic on him (Harry had also been educating him on classic Muggle films), and Draco felt better. “Now hold that happy memory about your father being proud of you, and concentrate on saying the incantation.”
His train of thought was thankfully interrupted by Nigel, who wanted to propose a game of cards. “Wizarding cards, of course, since Godric knows we don’t spend a lot of time with Wizards these days.” After some discussion, they landing upon Exploding Snap. Nigel wanted to make it strip Snap, but Harry’s shifty-eyed reaction and Draco’s eye-roll put the kibosh on that idea. Draco got up and left for the den to find the cards, and while Nigel gathered up the dishes to transport to the kitchen for cleaning, Harry felt compelled to follow Draco.
Where he did have conversation to offer, was on flying. Nigel wanted to hear all about his glory days of playing for Gryffindor, and Harry passed a very pleasant half hour reminiscing about it. He tried to be sensitive toward Draco and skimmed over the parts where he had beaten Slytherin, and he thought Draco might have noticed. He certainly had grown less guarded toward Harry, laughing much more easily at Harry’s tales and looking him over every now and then with an unaccustomed smile hovering around his lips. Harry could feel a growing desire to hear that laugh, and his mind couldn’t help wandering back to another, more vulnerable scene that he had witnessed earlier. The curiosity had come back with a vengeance.
Harry could not rid Draco from his mind that night, after experiencing the bewitching combination of his kisses and his undivided attention. He wanted more of both in the worst possible way, even while he struggled to come to terms with his newfound feelings of attraction to someone like Draco. Not to mention someone who was already intimate with other men on a regular basis. But the hour was late, and he would have to get some sleep before connecting with his former arch-nemesis again.
Harry recognized the posturing as nerves and took Draco’s hand in his. “Yeah, well, it’s just my stupid way of showing that I care about you. Enough to call this whole thing off if you’d rather not go through with it.”
Harry shook his head and smiled. “Nah, I’m glad you called. These Muggle video games are killing me.” He cringed as soon as he said it, but she was gracious enough to overlook it. Instead, she huffed in only the way that Hermione could.
Thankfully, Harry was fast asleep when Draco eventually made his way to bed, and appeared to sleep through the night. Draco, on the other hand, did not nod off so well as he would have liked. Worrisome images and scenarios kept floating unbidden into his mind, and every time he dozed he could feel the edges of a nightmare threatening to engulf him. After the third time of jerking awake, he finally gave in and took a sleeping potion.
“Magic is… a force to be drawn upon. It’s everywhere, but available only to the people who know to look for it and can use it with proper training. It’s another way of tapping into the wisdom of the human mind, and not everyone is lucky enough to access it.”
The demons came out at night, when Draco had read his last sentence and turned out the light next to his four-poster bed, an import from Malfoy Manor. He still left a soft pink crystal light on in the hallway, to avoid tripping over anything if he got up in the night, he told himself. But if he was perfectly honest, it gave him solace and made him feel less alone. Any nocturnal visitors of the human kind were invariably sent home after their tryst had ended, no matter how late the hour. Better not to have someone around when he woke up from the nightmares, heart pounding, reaching out after his father. Better not to let them hear him muttering about the Dark Lord, or Death Eaters, or Dumbledore, in his sleep. He wasn’t sure that he did, but given the usual tenor of his dreams, he didn’t want to take any chances.
“Well, Mr. Malfoy. It’s quite a transformation you seem to have gone through. What prompted you to give up your Pureblood views and take an interest in Muggles? Or are they just another academic project for you?”
The light that shot out of his palm was small, and quick, undulating as if underwater. It darted away from him before he could get a good look at it, and he suddenly remembered that he didn’t need the glasses that were perched on his nose. Fumbling them off his face, he looked wildly around the room, seeking out the streak of silver he had produced.
“Don’t bother, I don’t know why I asked. It’s stupid, really, I’ve just gotten so used to not seeing myself, or any reminders of the Wizarding world, I was taken by surprise.” He took a moment to inhale and exhale, slowly. “It’s okay, sorry to trouble you.”
“Listen, I’m not sure what you’ve got planned, but if you’re interested, I could take you to The Underworld this weekend. I have another friend who works there and might be able to get us some tickets to a concert.” Brandon’s eyes had skirted sideways and his finger was running laps around the edge of his glass again, now empty. “No pressure, of course, but if you’re into that sort of thing.” He made eye contact with Harry right as he spoke the final phrase, and the meaning couldn’t have been more clear.
Harry stopped and turned on Draco. “Honest? You want honesty now?” He drew in a trembling breath. “I hate that I used that curse, and I hate that I can see the traces of a Dark Mark on your arm. I still have nightmares about that night on the tower, with you and Dumbledore, and I wish I’d never had to take your wand. But I can’t just brush it off like you. I don’t know how to do anything but feel the pain and go through it.”
Thus entreated, Harry stayed, alternately stretched out next to Draco in his narrow bed, and nodding off in the chair when the nurses came in to check on their patient. They chided Harry for breaking the hospital rules at first, but once they realized that Harry’s presence was helping Draco to stay asleep, they left him alone. He watched the sky lighten outside with approaching dawn while he cradled Draco. He didn’t know what the days ahead would bring, but he was determined to be there for Draco, no matter what the cost.
Harry had a funny feeling that Draco was letting on more than he could fathom, but before he could ask any questions, Draco whisked him on to the next department to pick out a selection of ties.
Two chapters in one weekend, oh boy! The last chapter was pretty short, so I wanted to end the week with something that has a little more meat on the bone. ;)
Harry’s mouth twitched, but he held his laughter in check. “You mean, like one of those colorful fish in a koi pond?”
Before either of them could say more, the Mediwizard ushered over a team with a stretcher and carefully began Levitating Draco onto it, after casting a Body-Bind Charm to keep him stable. “All right, Mr. Malfoy, we’re going to Portkey you to St. Mungo’s, where we have another team ready to examine you and fix you up. Mr. Potter, I’m going to have to ask you to stay put. We don’t need another mob of reporters rushing St. Mungo’s right now. But, I promise you, we will keep you updated about Mr. Malfoy’s condition.” He handed Harry a small object, which turned out to be similar to the coins Hermione had transformed with a Protean Charm during the days of Dumbledore’s Army, before the Battle of Hogwarts. “Now if you’ll excuse us, we have a life to save.”
“Hi Ginsey.” His pet name for her resurfaced out of habit. He kissed her cheek and could smell the drink on her breath. “What are you having?”
Hermione sighed again. “He’s fine. I thought you didn’t want to discuss anything personal about him though. Ever since – you know – the break-up.”
“Right. Luna, I’ve got to go – it looks like Draco has woken up.” He gave her a quick peck on the cheek. “Finish that interview later?”
Harry didn’t know what he thought of this Nigel character. He might be wealthy and have impeccable taste, but besides that, what did Draco see in him? His looks were unremarkable, and his manners downright rude, and somehow he couldn’t picture Draco being attracted to someone like him for long. But what did he know, it was less than a week since he’d discovered that Draco was gay. And why should he care?
“Oh yeah? Which venue is that?” Harry had noticed that Brandon licked his lips and swallowed frequently before he spoke, and wondered if he felt nervous around Harry. What there was to be nervous about, he couldn’t fathom, but it struck him as rather cute.
“Deal.” He held out a hand to Draco, who shook it elegantly, like he was holding something delicate. Harry noticed for the first time that Draco’s eyes were ever so slightly more blue than grey, then chided himself for staring again. “See you – tomorrow?”
The one with the knife turned upon him, and several things happened at once. Harry stepped back, wary but not sober enough to react quickly. The person to the knifer’s right took advantage of the distraction and tackled him, while to Harry’s left, he became aware of someone hefting a weapon in his direction. Glancing out of the corner of his eye, he was able to identify the weapon as club of sorts, possibly a cricket bat, and it was rushing dangerously close to his head. He did the only thing he could think of to remove himself from the situation quickly and effortlessly.
“Watch this,” Harry grinned conspiratorily and tapped his wand on the surface. The spell caused the legs to elongate until it made a desk fit for writing.
“Oh,” Draco snickered, blushing again. “How about that Thai place that just opened up? We can bring some home for Sirius.”
Harry tried to school his enraged and horrified look to one more sedated, but based on McGonagall’s small smile, he didn’t succeed.
“Ha ha,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Look, I love you, and I love you in your shabby clothes, but I do not love your shabby clothes. We’re going to go shopping soon, and I’m going to buy you all the things you need and feel like you don’t deserve.”
“I will never leave you. Not even death can separate us. I love you too much.” Harry sniffled, and Draco started rocking them. Harry’s knees became sore rather quickly, so they sat, Harry’s back against Draco’s chest against the wall of the shower stall, Harry’s legs in the spray. He vaguely realized that they were wasting quite a lot of water, but he barely cared. There were much more important things to think about.
He did end up putting Hedwig’s cage in the living room, as it was a bit awkward having her in his bedroom. He knew she was an animal, and didn’t care what he and Draco were doing, but he couldn’t help feeling like she was more intelligent than her species would suggest, and determined he didn’t want her watching what he did to Draco, or vice versa. Hedwig enjoyed being in the living room with Draco’s owl, Leonardo, the two often going hunting together.
As soon as they walked in, Harry wanted to walk back out. The music was so loud he wanted to put his hands over his ears. The people were crammed into the small space and were dealing with it by dancing—if it could even be called that. Harry would call it jumping. There were a couple tables pushed against the walls, more than a couple filled with people just snogging. A DJ’s booth was right next to a shady looking bar.
Then, he frowned. Would Draco care? What if he thought that Harry wanted to be with other people? Multiple people? Was Draco himself gay or bi? Or were there other options as well? What else could there possibly be?
“I can’t believe how happy I am.” Draco confirmed. “You know,” Draco said, sometime later, “the sooner we get up and start the day, the sooner we can be married.”
“Are you calling me a liar?” Harry was angry now. He didn’t want to compete, and he shouldn’t have to prove it to some cheese-eating surrender monkey.
Harry turned to Draco. “I wish you could stay.” The distraction had worked as intended and Harry felt a lot better, but he was still terrified, and he didn’t want to sleep. Having Sirius close by was helping, but the times he and Draco had fallen asleep together, he had never slept better.
Ron and Hermione finally left him alone for a while after the funeral, he wandered around, not doing much of anything except thinking.
“You haven’t signed the contract,” she said, apparently attempting to keep the accusation out of her tone.
There were a couple beats, then Sirius laughed. “I’m kidding! Why do you think I’ve been teaching you how to ride for the last year? I know you’re fine. Here.” He presented Harry with a plastic card that was obviously his driver’s license.
“Move out of the way, let him through!” Came a voice shouting and hitting people until they cleared a path.
“Draco… the way he was being treated isn’t right, even if it is considered tradition. While I am sorry about disrespect, and maybe even the way I handled the situation, I didn’t feel like I had another choice. He wanted to leave, he told me, but he said that he couldn’t. He was trapped, enslaved, and he didn’t have another choice. I have to do what’s right, no matter the consequences. I hope you understand.”
He had refrained from extensive physical contact, not knowing if Draco would want it or not, and feeling strange about showing affection to someone who couldn’t feel it. He couldn’t harbor the thought that Draco no longer loved him but he still showed restraint. He would hold Draco’s hand when he talked to him, and would give him a kiss on the cheek when he arrived and departed. He didn’t kiss his lips, touch further in his body or get in the bed with him like he wanted until he felt he simply couldn’t deal with things again.
“I told you not to laugh,” Draco said petulantly with a pout. His cheeks were a little pink, but Harry suspected that was from the shower.
“No matter what happens, I’m here for you. Everything will be alright.” Draco said quietly. Harry nodded and took a deep breath as he gathered his thoughts for the confrontation.
“I…I don’t want to stop.” They stared at each other, both breathing heavily, then Draco leaned forward.
Draco leaned forward until his lips were almost touching Harry’s. “Because you’re the world’s best man.”
“Oh, come on now, Baby,” Harry murmured as he cradled Draco’s face close. He nuzzled their noses together and Draco’s eyes narrowed further.
“That’s ok, I’m about to as well,” Draco said, blinking rapidly and laughing with him. After several deep breaths, they were both calmed enough to start. “Ready?” Draco said quietly.
Sirius snorted. “I don’t care if you tear the place down and live in a tent. Do whatever your heart desires.”
Harry took a seat on the edge, and Draco sat next to him. His face was expressionless, eyes troubled but dry. He took a deep breath before he responded. “I’m alright, Harry. I’m just concerned about something having to do with your accounts. I have a suspicion, but it’s just that, and I could be dead wrong. I’m hesitant to tell you, but I have a feeling you’re not going to let it go, so all I can do is tell you, but, again, I don’t know for sure that this is what happened. Do you want to know?” Harry frowned.
“Yeah,” Ron agreed. “I’m getting pretty tired of you trying to ditch us.” There was a certain level of humor in his voice, but Harry could tell he was serious. Harry blinked in confusion.
Draco looked nervously in their direction as well. “I’d better head off the first wave of disappointment. There may be explosions, and it’ll be best if I’m there to counteract most of the heat. The longer I wait, the worse it will be, and I definitely don’t want to be seen going off with the golden trio.” He grinned at Harry. “Told you I’d think of a better name for you three.”
“What we have is real. You are real, you’re as real as you could possibly be. I don’t care that you grew up as a spoiled brat, you are a good man, and you’re fighting the injustices against you much better than anyone else would. I would have been scared shitless and done something stupid if Voldemort tasked me with killing Dumbledore. But you, you went out and made a plan, you didn’t roll over and submit, you fought! And I’m so proud of you for that. I love you so much, Baby.” Harry cupped his face and kissed him hard.
He leaned forward on the bed, intent on tasting that perfect, wonderful cock. Draco allowed him to put it in his mouth, suck up and down a couple times, but then he pulled back. “This is your turn.” He reminded Harry. Harry was sure that didn’t mean he couldn’t have Draco’s cock, but he digressed. Draco obviously had a plan for this.
“I’ll go along with this for now. But, can I still try and figure it out?” Draco looked at Harry for a long moment.
A hand grabbed his, warm and perfect. It pulled him as Draco stood, standing directly in front of him. Harry was wrong, his expression was furious.
“Yes, birthday boy. Why don’t you open them?” Harry sat up and picked up the smallest one. It wasn’t too heavy, but a thick rectangle. After opening it slowly, he found it was a book, Disenchanted Volume 2.
I know Hermione usually figures things out in most stories, so that's why I had a section explaining why she hasn't and what her thoughts have been over the last couple years.
All up and down the street, eyes were poking out from behind curtains trying to see the drama unfolding. Uncle Vernon waved until they disappeared as Harry tried to catch his breath. He was stunned. The oaf had hurt him before, but never tried to kill him, and over what?
“Do you ever think about what it would be like to date other people?” He asked, feeling his stomach churn in protest.
Unfortunately, there was a small bump in the road. Cho accosted him one day when he was on the way to Transfiguration, and it didn’t go well.
This chapter made me particularly happy. I didn't realize I was doing this at first, but Harry's bi-experience and thought process was very similar to mine and writing it out really helped with processing. It wasn't until about 3 weeks ago that I fully accepted that part of myself (though I've known to various degrees for years) and it was very freeing. Byyyyyyy the way, I'm bi. (That's how I came out to my sister and best friend.)
Draco threw an amused look as he gestured for Harry to precede him. Harry rolled his eyes, he had a feeling Draco was going to try to out gentlemen him.
“See? It’s fun. Just try it.” Harry sighed, but did use that method for the next present. It was kind of fun. “You’re a kid, Harry, you don’t have to worry about the mess.” Sirius scolded as Harry tried to clean up the little pieces of wrappings. “Drop it,” he added seriously.
“No, he…he was a Death Eater. He got scared and tried to run away. There’s no way he did something like that.” Sirius shook his head and looked away.
He kissed Draco back, slowly at first, with more passion as the moments went on. Draco’s lips moved over his, his tongue coming out to lick at his lips. Harry granted him entry, giving in to this one last kiss. He moaned, letting himself forget for a moment and get lost in Draco.
Sixth Year began, Harry starts to think something's up with Draco, and there's a whole lotta gayness.
They were laying on the floor in his bedroom at The Lupercal. Harry put Draco down on his bed, who hummed in relief, laying back against the cushions. Harry looked at him, he would only be allowed to for so much longer. He picked up his necklace, which doubled as the homing signal for Draco’s portkey, and put it back on. He had felt rather naked without it. “I felt the wards come down, I knew it would work that time.”
Draco wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist, pulling him closer as the two walked down the near deserted street. “I think we can apparate pretty much anywhere. Is there anything else you wanted to do?”
“…And Kreature has no idea where it went or who could takes it!” Kreature wailed, sobbing into his arms. Harry patted him on the back a little awkwardly, exchanging nervous glances with Draco. This wasn’t good news. They had just lost their only lead. It might have been easier if Regulus had just left the locket where it was. Harry felt awful for thinking that, the man had given his life for it.
“Oh, Baby,” Draco whispered, hugging him tightly. He placed a couple gentle kisses against Harry’s head that helped calm him. He didn’t want to be calm, however. He wanted to let go, and he wanted to be sad. He really wanted to cry. So, he did all that.
“How are things at home, Pippin?” He asked, dreading the answer. Pippin’s ears drooped, and her face clouded.
The Summer itself had several twists and turns, including a demented House-Elf and a wayward floo trip that resulted in him seeing Draco again. Not that Draco saw him, as he was hiding in a cupboard at the time. He thought about talking to Draco there in Flourish and Blotts, but Lucius Malfoy appeared too quickly, and Harry decided to wait until there was no chance of him showing up.
As they said the final word, however, Harry definitely felt magic. He still didn’t look away from Draco, but he could tell there was magic all around them. It didn’t scare him; it felt warm and comfortable, like Draco’s love. He hadn’t read that there was supposed to be a reaction of this magnitude, but the book had warned that stronger ceremonies could sometimes ignite wild magic. He felt his heart clench and soar at the thought that their marriage bond was strong.
“Oh, Betty I had almost forgotten about that. So darling. James and Lily. Oh, I am so happy you survived what happened. I heard you did, but we never saw you again. Where did you go to live, Dear?”
The following Saturday were Quidditch tryouts. By the end of it, Harry was ready to turn in his captain’s badge. The amount of people that showed up just to be around Harry was mind boggling. After he weeded out the crazy people, it got a little easier, but the annoyance of one person almost outweighed all the other students combined. Cormac McLaggen could not have been worse. Harry was so relieved Ron managed to outplay him, even if he might have refused to let him on the team just for his attitude.
Harry was infuriated that Draco would bring the Weasleys specifically into their fights. In the past it had been vague, but this was too explicit.
Harry closed his eyes and kissed Draco, feeling tears burn at the corner of his eyes. “I love you,” he told him. He could see the outline of Draco in the moonlight, and he was just so beautiful.
He nodded. “I do too. Giving a home to a child who needs it is valiant. I would love that too. Now I don’t know what to do.” He leaned into Harry.
I realize that I completely glossed over the fact that Harry Disapparated in full view of a group of Muggles. Let’s just say that in my version of the Potterverse, Wizards who are of age and don’t have Traces on them are a little more at liberty to misbehave without consequences...
I thought it would be cute to make a reference to the popularity of the Harry Potter series in the Muggle world, without mentioning the author’s actual name. I happen to disagree with JKR on some issues, but if any characterization of her sounds disparaging here, that was not my intention, just Draco’s (!).
“What, with getting to know Harry? Oh, you mean the publicity.” He blinked and considered. “I think a part of me is happy with the idea that we won’t have to hide for much longer. It almost felt like we weren’t taking things seriously enough, keeping it all under the radar the way we were. Harry doesn’t want to pass up the opportunity for showing the world new possibilities, and I don’t want to give up what I have with Harry.” He gulped as soon as he said it, hating himself for being so vulnerable in front of
“Honestly, Harry, I don’t know how you get by,” she tutted. “At least tell me you’ve been using one of those planners I gave you.”
“Stop squinting, Potter, it’ll make you old before your time.” Draco seemed determined to continue calling him by his surname. He sat down with a sigh.
Draco did not know what to make of this, but the Z coursing through his veins didn’t let him stay mired in confusion or sensibility for long. Instead, he beckoned Feruza and said, “What the hell, why don’t you send her over here. It’s not like we’re going to remember everything later anyway, I'll wager.”
“Sorry love, we have to get everything set up. You’re welcome to enjoy breakfast upstairs in private though, we won’t need to get you into the chair until around lunchtime.”
Harry laughed, without a shred of humor. “Hope? Hope doesn’t get you very far, it just strings you on, from one situation to the next, until you don’t have anything left at all to hold onto." His jaw had set in determination, and Draco knew there was no use in trying to talk him out of it. "I had so much hope when I first saw you at that bookshop, and look where it’s gotten us. I can’t do it any more, I can’t be the one holding it all together when I don’t even know what I want, let alone what’s best for you. I care about you so much, and I respect your decision, but I’m done with hope.” He emphasized his words by standing up, and Draco scrambled to follow. “Don’t bother coming back, Malfoy. I need to finish recovering on my own, and leave you out of it.”
Harry left the shop in a daze, after exchanging a few more words with Malfoy, who looked more approachable somehow, in Muggle clothing and Muggle surroundings. The Quidditch display had thrown him for a loop, no question, and he wondered to himself whether Malfoy thought he was an insufferable berk for caring about finding himself illustrated in a book about Quidditch history. A whisper of Snape’s voice crept to the forefront of his mind, berating him for thinking he was Special. And yet, Harry had spent the better part of the year trying to erase his Specialness. What more did his conscience want?
Malfoy – Draco – appeared to be mollified, but he did not sit down, choosing instead to start clearing away the dishes. The food vanished as it approached a dishwashing unit under the counter, and Harry found himself momentarily mourning the loss of such fine pastry.
After the chorus of “Hear hear’s” that followed, Draco was not to be outdone. He felt more than a little tipsy as he stood up, and placed one hand on Harry’s shoulder to steady himself. “I’m not usually one to overshare, but I have to say that this man here means the world to me. I may be a Slytherin and a former Death Eater and a haughty ocelot, but I’m proud to be associated with Harry. Even if it means putting up with his insufferable Gryffindor friends.” He thought about that sentence for a bit, then corrected it. “Present company excepted. And Ginny.” The words did not come out in as suave a manner as he had hoped, but the effect seemed to be a positive one, if the tears rolling down Hermione’s cheeks were any indication. “Anyhow, cheers.” He sat down more forcefully than he intended, but Harry’s warm kiss reminded him why he had stood up in the first place.
“Any time. Except not really, we don’t want send you into another fit about Galleons, do we. But I look forward to our next outing. Maybe another turn on your broomstick?” There was a wicked look in Draco’s eye. "Not speaking metaphorically, of course."
He wasn’t about to share any of those details with her, a fragile Muggle, so he opted for a different take on the truth instead. “I believe they wouldn’t think he’s good enough for me. They had all these big plans for me, you see – I’m their only child after all, and it’s important for them to continue the family bloodline.”
Harry looked lost for words, and so Draco continued. “She’s been having me followed by a private investigator, which is why she knew about us and was able to get the interview pulled, with some help from an old friend whose family runs the Daily Prophet. She also said something to the Ilvermorny school board, I’m not sure what. Probably something nasty, she can be pretty ruthless sometimes. Whatever it was, she convinced them to end the terms of my contract a few weeks early so I could go back to doing magic, without losing my standing. However, there’s a catch.” It was his turn to stare at the floor. “She’s heard from my father. He’s coming home, and she wants me there, so we can have a go at being a real family again.” His eyes still on the floor, he willed himself to keep speaking through the growing mass of emotions in his throat. “I want it too, but she won’t do it with you or anyone who isn’t family around.”
“Look, I didn’t ask to be a Death Eater, or to be born into one of the oldest Pureblood lineages. I did choose to take this year of Muggle immersion to make up for some of the damage caused to my family.” He exhaled sharply through his nose. “The least you could do is show me how I can trust you to not go spreading lies about me, or prying into my private business.”
Harry agreed, but only on the condition that he try to learn it without a wand first. “If it turns out to be too challenging, we can try it with your wand. But honestly, I don’t think it will be that hard for you, you’re a much more powerful Wizard than you let on.”
They had amassed a healthy pile of clothes for Harry to try on, and were on their way to the dressing rooms when they ran into a small gaggle of young women. One of them looked at Harry, and her eyes lit up in recognition. Harry felt the bottom of his stomach lurch unpleasantly, but it was too late to dodge her gaze.
The skylight closed behind them with final click, and Harry was hit once more by the oddity of the situation. Here he was, with his once sworn enemy, standing on a rooftop in London about to embark upon a tandem flight.
It was dicey work getting through the snarl of Saturday night traffic that had built up in the area since they had arrived (was it really less than an hour that had passed?), but Luna was able to direct them to a side entrance that would attract no attention to the four of them plus Trevor, who was getting grumpier by the minute. They ended up in a hallway lined with dimly lit wall sconces, which opened onto a mid-size room that was mostly empty except for a double row of clothing racks along one wall, hung in a riot of colors and textures. Luna waved them toward a couch set in the opposite corner and ignited the fireplace, casting a warm golden glow over the space.
Nigel laughed, in a surprisingly wicked low-belly rumble. “Yeah, he likes a little bit of everything. Especially when it helps him to pick up Muggles.”
With that little exchange, Harry felt something fling itself open in the region of his chest. He was most definitely attracted to men, and not just to Draco. And just as clearly, he knew he wanted to be with Draco in this reality, Godric help him.
“Expecto Patronum!” The light shot out again, but this time it didn’t vanish as quickly. It lingered for a couple minutes, floating like a mist through the doorway into the hall before fading into nothingness.
Draco flinched a little, but his only response was to cover Harry’s hand with his own for a moment before turning away and getting up from the bed. As he retrieved his clothing, Harry watched him with concern, mixed with admiration at how gracefully he moved. He didn’t understand Draco’s silence, but he could still enjoy the moment by watching him in the dying light while he waited.
“Harry, how are you –“ Draco started, then stopped in amazement as Harry began magically removing Draco’s remaining layers of clothing. An unbuttoning of the shirt revealed that Draco was slender with just a hint of definition around the abdomen and upper chest. Draco shivered and tensed as Harry concentrated on removing each sleeve, licking his lips in anticipation. Harry could see a faint webbing of scar tissue where he had once injured Draco, and resolved to pay extra attention to that part of his anatomy in the near future. But for now, he wanted to draw out the slow agony of undressing just a little bit longer.
“Maybe,” Harry admitted. “Alright if I get up early to head that off?” Draco nodded, his hands moving up and down Harry’s upper legs.
There is so much to write about in Year 7, I'm coming along, but it is slow, so there will be several more weeks before we see an addition to the main story.
Their path back to the Slytherin common room was uneventful, and they traded another kiss before Harry departed for his own common room.
He was making his way carefully towards the door when he caught sight of Ron and Hermione ducking low in their booth behind a Christmas tree. They were barely visible, and Harry’s shackles went up. What was wrong?
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, and Ginny grinned with a predatory gleam in her eye. Harry wondered if she was developing a crush on Cedric. He thought he was quite a bit too old for her.
Harry snorted then leaned forward to kiss him. “I love you too, you abusive weirdo.” Draco smirked and raised an eyebrow at him. “It’s fine, I’ll go to Pomphrey and get it fixed after the feast.”
Draco had just kissed him. Draco had kissed his forehead. His heart felt like it would pound right out of his chest. Draco kissed him.
On Saturday, he sent his weekly letter to Draco from the owlery. Cho Chang entered and asked him which owl was his. Harry called her down, and she spent several minutes fawning over her. “Such a pretty bird.” She said, “almost as pretty as her owner.” She looked up at him through her lashes, smiling lightly.
Draco shook his head. “They really and truly are not very intelligent, I don’t think they will be able to do it. Maybe we could put some spells on it, mess with how it works, so we know they won’t be able to figure it out.”
Harry had, briefly, wondered if there would be a finality to the ceremony. From what he knew of muggle weddings and Bill and Fleur’s, there was a moment when the officiant would declare the two married, then they would kiss, and it would be a very clear sign that the transition was over and they were indeed married. There was nothing very final about the ceremony they had chosen, it was just their final Latin phrase. They could kiss, of course, but that was their own choice, not included in what they needed to do to cement their vows.
“I’m glad you like it, Sweetheart. I’m honestly starting to run out of ideas for you.” Harry laughed.
“Well,” McGonagall drew herself up, “Far be it from me to determine the wisdom of that, but considering the current situation, I suppose it is for the best. Potter, I think it would be wise if you were to not go wandering off by yourself. I know, I know,” she added at Harry’s enraged look. “Under normal circumstances I would never endorse needing to, but your life is worth more than a little embarrassment. If it were up to me, you would be moved from this school to a secure location, but that would be impossible.”
“Thank you,” he whispered before he closed his eyes. There was a lot he could wish for. He had come so far since he was young, had so much more than he ever had. He believed in birthday wishes very strongly, and he wanted to make this one count. He was going to wish that the war was over quickly with minimal casualties, but when he opened his eyes and saw Draco smiling at him, he added that he wanted Draco, alive, well, and by his side.
Harry sighed into the kiss. He felt like a weight had been lifted from his chest. That had been weighing on his mind for a long time, and it had only grown heavier. Now, there was a lightness in its place. He felt like showing Draco just how thankful he was to have him in his life, so he began devoiding Draco of his clothes. Draco hummed in interest, joining in on his activities.
Harry groaned internally at the thought of more shopping, but he didn’t fancy coming back to the alley. “Yeah, I’ll go to Flourish and Blotts, then Madam Malkin’s. Meet me there?” Draco nodded, and dropped him off at the bookstore.
With that, he was gone. Harry collapsed back against the floor, a huge shuttering sigh escaping him. Sirius was safe. That was the important thing. Whatever Voldemort’s plan had been, it would not come to fruition, now. He had taken on Voldemort, again, and won.
Harry let out a puff of air. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to tell them, he had been looking forward to it for years. Now that the opportunity was here, however, he felt like they were inviting trouble. Maybe it was just a habit he would have to break. He knew there would be repercussions for keeping this secret as long as he had. He really,
he woke up? He also felt like he needed to get away from Draco. He hated himself for thinking it, but looking at Draco’s still form was killing him. Draco was so full of life, he shouldn’t be quiet and motionless. The sight had been slowly draining him, he just needed a moment. He would be back soon, and he would be a devoted and loving boyfriend. He just needed to not picture Draco’s eyes, staring at him, for just a couple minutes.
Draco took longer than he expected. He had several robes picked out by the time Draco wrapped his arms around him and began critiquing his choices. Draco bought Harry a whole wardrobe worth of robes, and Harry wondered when he would wear them with all the new clothes he had shrunk in bags. While they were looking, Draco told Harry how the meeting had gone. He had managed to switch the accounts due to his father’s imprisonment, made several changes in his investments, and spent some time looking at the heirlooms in the vault.
Draco swallowed, and Harry had never seen him more terrified. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and drew himself up. When he opened his eyes, he said, “I can’t.” His voice was clear, and strong. It stunned the Death Eaters, yet again.
There was a mysterious pen-pal. Harry had told her and Ron about him or her after they had asked him repeatedly who he was with. He did receive letters from someone, but they had come less and less often over the years. She wondered if he was using this person as an excuse for whatever he was doing that day. She suspected that he hadn’t been hanging out with anyone but had rather been doing something she wouldn’t approve of, and that was why he had gotten so tight-lipped. Instead of saying nothing, he had thrown her a red-herring.
“Look at you, being the optimist.” Harry said, with just a note of more enthusiasm. Draco squeezed his hand again, as he had done practically non-stop whilst talking to Ron and Hermione.
“Oh? Well, that’s their symbol. It’s a symbol that they release after they have killed someone. People would come home during the first war, see that symbol hanging above their home, and know that a member of their family had died.”
The first day back was a good time to sneak off to meet Draco for about an hour. Everyone would be in the common room, talking about their summer’s collectively and he wouldn’t be missed in the crowd. They talked about their summers, Harry skirting around where he had stayed, and snogged for a bit. Later that night, he opened the package from Sirius. It was a mirror, used to communicate between two people who had the matching one. He enjoyed talking to Sirius for a couple minutes before they each said goodnight.
Draco shrugged. “He’s – well, I guess you could call him that. Although I'm not sure friends would shag the way we do.”
Harry snorted and punched him lightly in the arm. “That’s quite enough from you, Mr. Malfoy. Let me cook something up, won’t be a moment.”
The question was answered by Malfoy himself, who opened the door and paused on the steps between the door and the sidewalk, looking at something in his hand. Harry couldn’t figure out what it was until he lifted it to his ear, and then he understood. It was a mobile phone, and Malfoy was talking into it.
“About bloody time,” she retorted when he apologized for calling so late. “Do you know how excruciating it is, having to hold in a secret like this around Ron and the Weasleys?”
“Thanks, Harry. Draco was just telling me how he can’t do magic, but at least he can hang out with us Wizarding types without turning weak and kittenish.”
She nodded, encouraging him, “He’s at the Ministry still, but who knows how much longer he’ll be there. I would hurry, if I were you.”
Under normal circumstances, Harry would have prodded further and had a good laugh over Ron’s latest antics. Instead, Harry found himself speechless with dread. In a burst of willpower, he blurted out, “Hermione, I’ve started seeing someone.”
Harry closed his eyes and hummed contentedly, then fixed his gaze on Draco’s again. “Say it again, like you really mean it.”
When Harry climbed back down into his living room, turning on lamps as he went, Draco was awake and trying to figure out Harry’s electric teakettle. “How the hell do you make tea with this thing?”
Since then, he hadn’t had much luck in finding anyone new, despite the not-so-subtle hints from his friends that he ought to move on. He had reached out to Brandon, the American he’d met at the gay pub in Camden Town, but that had fizzled after only a few dates. Following some trial and mostly error in online dating, the only chance he felt he had at starting anything resembling a proper relationship was through work, which had become like a second home to him. He liked his co-workers well enough, but none of them at the moment had the allure he was looking for.
The weight on his lower back lifted, and Draco cleared his throat. “There, it’s done. Now roll over.”
“Draco!” Someone was shaking him, gently but insistently. His eyes snapped open and saw Harry’s face before him, his green eyes still muddy with sleep. “Wake up! You’re having a nightmare.”
“You do know that I’m not infinitely wealthy,” Harry brought up when Draco handed him a pair of emerald cufflinks to try on. “I may have a vault full of Galleons from my parents, but I intend to make it last a lifetime, not just one day here.”
Mysteria’s look spoke volumes, and Harry didn’t like the story they were spinning about him and Malfoy. With dignity, Mysteria rose to the occasion and kissed Malfoy once on each cheek. “His name is Harry, but I take it you know each other?”
“That’s the problem with you, Malfoy. You think you have people figured out, but you really don’t know anything about me, at all.”
“Right, of course. Well – “ Brandon swallowed again and Harry watched his Adam’s apple dip toward his collar – “if you’ve got someone already, I suppose you could bring them along too.”
Harry shook his head in wonderment. “Blimey. No wonder your family’s been sorted into Slytherin for generations.”
Instead of leaving it alone, as a genteel, well-brought up person should, Harry persisted on the topic. He had all sorts of theories about how Draco’s mother would be more happy to learn how her son was faring than put out by the news that he was dating his former arch-nemesis.
Harry’s expression could only be described as a pout, and Draco was momentarily distracted by the deliciousness of his lips. “That’s not the same thing, and you know it. None of them have any idea that I’m involved with you, just some random Muggle I met in a bar.”
Ginny and Feruza shared a look that made Draco reconsider his assessment of their relationship. “It went over very well, let’s put it that way.” Ginny had a mischievous twist to her mouth, and Draco decided to let the subject go. “How about you and Harry, how are things?”
Brandon smiled and ran one finger around the rim of his glass. “It’s not just here, you know. The World’s End, a rival pub just down the block, is also rumored to be haunted. Particularly the music venue in the basement.”
But their progress was slow. Draco seemed much more interested in teasing Harry this time around. He started by kissing Harry once on each eyelid, then very tenderly undressing them both, punctuating each removal with a new kiss until they were standing in a naked state of arousal before each other.
She led him to the couch, still talking and divesting him of his coat as they went. “It doesn’t look too bad in terms of blood loss, have you been putting pressure on for at least fifteen minutes? I should get some dittany ointment on it anyway. Also some alcohol to disinfect, d’you have any?” Harry shook his head mutely. “Of course you don’t, I’m sorry I asked.” She started rummaging in her bag. “We can get you cleaned up in the bathroom, just one moment while I find – “
“Is that really all you can think about, bringing honor to the Malfoy name? Are you that much of a manipulative bastard, or are you just miserable about being stuck with a hidebound family who cares more about saving face than about your happiness?”
?” Residual tipsiness made his gestures more emphatic than usual, and Harry flinched as his hand came dangerously close to Harry’s nose. “Isn’t that every straight guy’s fantasy, to be in a threesome with two girls?”
“Well, Draco, I’d like to ask you over to my place. For dinner. I think I can explain better that way, why I’m living the way I am. And why I’m not eager to return to being the Boy Who Lived.”
We're getting close to the end, y'all... I will do my best to have the next chapter posted over the weekend. This chapter was much easier for me to write, once I decided that I wanted to give the Malfoys a chance at redemption. :)
His voice cracked a little at the end of the sentence, and Draco’s heart was flooded once more with unfamiliar feelings of endearment. “Whenever you like,” was his reply.
He was neatly dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans, with curly brown hair and large eyes that were friendly behind rimless glasses. “Name’s Brandon, what’s yours?”
“I’m just wondering if there’s nothing to say. That Harry has really told us everything.” They thought he was a liar?
Draco sighed wistfully. “Not this summer, Sweetheart. I want to live with you as soon as we graduate, though.”
“There’s no chance for us, is there?” Ginny asked, sounding more resigned than anything. “I really thought there was something between us, but I guess I must have imagined it.”
“Yum. Can I have a taste before we get to the main event?” Harry asked, stroking Draco’s beautiful cock lightly.
“Hopefully that won’t happen to you. Harry, are you ok, you’re breathing a little funny?” Harry realized his breathing had picked up, and he was holding back a minor attack. He blushed furiously.
Harry sighed. He’d forgotten how persistent people who drank could be, but since this was Draco and he wanted to make amends, far be it from him to protest.
unique, Draco thought to himself. “The fame might have gotten to him when he was younger, but I don’t think he feels the same way about it now.”
There was a trail of blood steadily dripping behind him, and he couldn’t help but think of what a nightmare it would be to remove the stains.
Nothing happened, and Draco frowned. “Lumos,” he spoke clearly, and the wand finally responded with a weak glow of light at its tip. “I wonder if its allegiance is still to you, Harry.”
“I don’t know. Let me think about it. I – I had hoped to meet your mother first before she got wind of this – you know, our relationship.”
And just like that, he was gone. Draco, left alone and shaking with unexpressed grief, could only fixate on the square of darkling blue sky at the end of the hallway as the seconds pulsed by. If he looked anywhere else, he didn’t know what would happen, such was the magnitude of pain that had infiltrated every corner of his being.
Draco broke into stifled laughter then, leaning his forehead into the back of Harry’s head as he quaked. Harry really didn’t mind, but he did want to know what had set it off, after Draco had told
Draco tried to seem nonchalant, to cover up the unease he truly felt. “Harry hasn’t mentioned it, no. I’m not sure what his status is with the Ministry at the moment, after taking leave.” He tucked his hair behind one ear. “I’m sure he’ll tell me if it’s important to him. Right now we prefer to keep things on the down-low.” He looked straight at Ginny. “I’m sure you understand how that goes.”
If Auror Hawken was surprised to hear Draco’s name mentioned, she didn’t show it. Hermione cast one more anxious look over the three of them before turning to Harry. “Yes, I think we are. Auror Hawken will get them both to a safe house, and I can help you with getting out of here undetected.” Her eyes swept over him in turn. “I think we’d better start by Transfiguring your outfit too, it’s not exactly subtle.”
incantation to himself, and was gratified to see Draco slowly lifting until he was floating over the bed, as if gravity had been temporarily suspended in the room. Gently, oh so gently, Harry pushed him until his back was almost flush against the opposite wall, still levitating half a meter above the baseboard.
Hermione tossed back her hair, unsure as to whether he could be believed. “I already applied some Wound-Cleaning Potion of my own, thanks. I’m not sure if a Draught of Peace is a good idea yet, he might be a little concussed.”
“All right, look – Hermione” – the name felt misplaced in his mouth – “I know I have no right to say it, not after everything you have gone through together, and the way I’ve treated you all. But I think I’m in love with your friend, and I don’t know what to bloody do about it.”
Harry’s hand had crept to the back of his neck, as if to stop the heat there from spreading forward to his face and ears. “Um, yes? A little?”
“Harry, if you’re serious about letting bygones be bygones, you don’t have a choice but to hear some of the more intimate details of my life. Unless of course it’s a life-threatening secret.”
He jumped in like it was a cold mountain lake on a summer day, without giving himself time to rethink it. “I love you.”
Harry was stirring the puttanesca sauce when he heard a knock at the door. Casting a quick safety charm to keep the temperature consistent and the spoon stirring, he wiped his hands nervously and went to open the door. “Come on in, Malf – sorry, Draco.”
“It can be, but once you get the theory right, not necessarily. I can walk you through it. You would have to practice though.”
Harry pulled off his last remaining jumper and followed Draco to the den, adjusting his glasses. The soda was already beginning to work on him, if the intended effects were to sharpen his senses and make him feel more alert. “I think I like this better than the Felici-Fizz.” He didn’t like that they owed it to Nigel, though, something he would have rather died than admit out loud to Draco in that moment.
The new Auror inclined her head gravely and offered a hand to Harry. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Potter.” Her gaze moved past him toward Ginny, who was beginning to stir from slumber, although Feruza appeared to still be fast asleep. “You all must be exhausted after going through what you have. Ms. Weasley and I have met before, under different circumstances. I had hoped it wouldn’t come to this, but here we are.”
“Draco, what do you want to do with yourself, once you finish your Muggle immersion program?” He waved a half-eaten chocolate about, finishing the bite in his mouth before continuing. “Surely you don’t want to keep living here and working at Bedknobs.”
Harry agreed eventually, on the condition that absolutely no invasive questions be asked about Harry’s past, and that no alcohol be served. “That’s just fine, I think Nigel’s been fixing to jump on the wagon anyway. This’ll give him a proper excuse.”
“Erm, thanks, that’s really nice of you to offer.” Harry didn’t want to break the spell, but it was growing late and he had to leave before he got in too deep. “But I’m not much into music, and I have someone else.” He felt badly when he saw the light go out of Brandon’s eyes. They were such nice eyes, alternating blue and green in the warm glow of the pub, and Harry felt the stirrings of desire in places that had formerly been reserved for Draco alone. What was happening to him? Was he doomed to fall in lust with every attractive man he met?
Harry counted to ten, then ventured another word. “All right. Then tell me, why am I even here? Would I have bothered to bring you home and come back for tea if I thought I had you all figured out?”
Draco felt further drawn into Harry’s world and wanted to understand more of the landscape. “If you could completely let go of that identity, rather than just going in temporary hiding like you are now, would you do it?”
Feruza’s eyes were less hooded after hearing Draco’s surname, and she nodded in acknowledgment. “Mr. Malfoy. A pleasure to meet you. I hope you and Harry are very happy together.” She turned back to Ginny and asked as if neither of the men were there, “Can we go now? I am getting very bored with all this.” The gesture she made seemed to encompass the entire scene, and not just Harry and Draco, which made them feel slightly better.
The French magazine that Draco reads at night (yes, he does read in at least one foreign language, in my version of him), I chose mostly because of the title, which could be translated as "stubborn, obstinate, or unwilling to yield." The material is relevant to Draco's identity however, as you can see from checking out the Tetu website. ;)
Draco couldn’t resist rolling his eyes. “Harry, get over yourself. I’m really hot, you’re fucking gorgeous, and we’re both horny young men in our twenties. Besides, you’re protected by the runes I painted on your back, and so am I. I don’t think the stakes are very high.” He punctuated the rhyme by rolling over, leaving Harry to have his way with him.
Draco snorted. “I think my days of milk-drinking are over, Potter, unless I’m pouring it in my tea. But not to worry, I brought something with me.”
As he went about the business of preparing for bed, Harry’s thoughts turned again and again towards the vision of Draco sprawled on his own bed, being devoured by someone else. Harry realized with deepening bewilderment that he didn’t just want to kiss Draco and see where it went. He longed to be Draco’s counterpart, to explore and to understand the secrets of his body and his mind, and the desire they called forth. Where had
Draco struggled against his bonds again, his face twisting with the effort. Harry had never seen his hair this messy outside of bed, and he was promptly overcome by a desire to touch him. His knees seemed to be cooperating again, and he was able to stand up and look Draco in the eyes, up close. “Finite Incantatum.”
Draco’s interest was thoroughly piqued, and he would not let this opportunity pass. “No, go on. I want to hear all the gory details.” It was really too fun, getting the rise out of Ron – he half expected flames to start shooting out of his ears at any moment.
Ginny still occupied a tender place in his heart, even after the dissolution of the relationship they had enjoyed for a few years. She was the one who had helped him the most with supporting his decision to withdraw from the Wizarding world, after seeing what a deleterious effect celebrity had upon him. Joyful celebrations with close friends had devolved into crowds of sycophants and hungry tabloid writers jostling for attention from the Boy Who not only had Lived, but had led into victory an epic revolt against the greatest villain of their lifetime.
Potter whistled. “Blimey, I’d forgotten. But yeah, I do remember seeing something about it in the papers.” He paused a bit too long. “I just didn’t know it would be so close by.”
Harry’s eyes had disappeared again, and he reached out blindly for a hug. “I’ve just gotten so used to not being the center of attention this past year, I don’t know if I can handle this level of publicity again, all at once.” His breathing had grown rapid, and Draco held him close until he was able to stop hyperventilating.
history of it, not the fictional one – got me thinking about how badly humans wanted magic and its power to be real. And yet, out of alchemy grew chemistry, and psychology, and all manner of spiritual exploration, like Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.” He paused before continuing. “It’s almost as if humans created their own magic out of the natural world, rather than finding magic in the form that they so desperately sought in the early years of history. What if the magic that they sought was there all along, and they just had to believe in it for it to be real?”
First, a prophylactic charm, another reflex from his blackout party days. Then, a wordless look up at Draco to ascertain consent, followed by a lowering of the head, drawing back silk to have a good look at him. Harry thought that Draco had a very nice cock, all pink and velvety smooth and longer than he had imagined. Even with no personal frame of reference, he could remember what it felt like to be on the receiving end and did his best, giving him a long, lingering lick before taking him into his mouth and seeing how far back in his throat he could go. Draco’s flustered reactions made it more than worth any mild discomfort to Harry.
“Language, Harry,” he murmured into Harry’s newly healed ear, which looked like it could use some attention. At a loss, he gave him a quick kiss to the cheek and a comforting rub to the back before turning to Hermione. “Sorry, I know this must be awkward. Can’t we just – I don’t know, let bygones be bygones?” He held out a hand to her, feeling most un-Slytherin-like. She accepted it as if in a dream, one that was not entirely pleasant but held potential for redemption.
“All right Hermione. It’s been great, I’m really glad we had this little chat. Catch you next week?”
“No Harry, you can stay.” His eyes were still closed, but Harry’s heart flipped a little at the invitation. “As long as you promise not to say anything to anyone about it.” He sniffed and yawned. “I have a reputation to uphold.”
Harry couldn’t believe how surreal and precious it felt to have Draco Malfoy sleeping on his shoulder, and so soon after their glorious first tumble. But the feeling was short-lived. He was due for his weekly chat with Hermione, and didn’t want to arouse suspicion by not showing up. After some mental dithering, he conjured a Body Pillow spell and left Draco half-lying on the couch, propped up as if by an invisible Harry shape. Draco barely stirred, and Harry hoped he wouldn’t wake up before he finished the call.
“But enough about me. You still haven’t answered my question about your Wizarding friends. Besides Nigel. Who I still don’t really understand.”
Harry took his first sip, and was pleasantly surprised. It tasted like violets and tingled sweetly across the tongue, with a bright lemony aftertaste. He wondered what the “essence of Felix Felicis” would do for his mental state.
Harry glanced around wildly for any familiar landmarks, then discovered with relief that he was standing above his own skylight. “I’m on the roof, at home. I just got back from an outing gone wrong, I can explain - ”
First description of sexual activity between characters (nothing terribly graphic, that will come later). Harry has a moment of voyeuristic weakness and a mild case of jealousy mixed with FOMO. He also makes a terrible dad joke. You have been warned.
When he re-entered the main room of the loft, he saw Draco looking at the décor. There were a few paintings hanging on the wall, a reminder of his Grimmauld Place inheritance from Sirius, which he had studiously avoided inhabiting since the end of the War, and Harry wondered, not for the first time, what they said about him and his taste. Ginny had seemed to like them, the few times he’d invited her over, but he had a feeling that Draco’s opinion would be more critical.
It was but the work of the moment to walk to a discreet distance and Summon his broom, which came rushing toward him after several minutes had passed. Sometimes he felt like she was akin to an animal companion, and in that spirit, he stroked her tail of streamlined twigs lightly. “Good girl. Let’s go on another ride with Draco.”
“Doesn’t matter. I think you should try it.” Harry extended a hand to pull him up to standing, and Draco took it reluctantly. He felt foolish with his shirt unbuttoned to his navel and his trousers off.
Draco and Harry were quiet until the made it out of the Hall. “Have you thought any more on what you’re going to do about them?” He asked just over a whisper, almost too casually. They had touched on what Hermione and Ron had done, but not discussed it too far into their feelings.
“I know. I just panicked when I saw you in trouble. It hurts me when you’re hurting.” Harry felt a now familiar feeling rise in his heart, one that he had been feeling more and more frequently. Suddenly, he gasped, knowing what the unknown emotion was. “What’s wrong?” Draco asked at Harry’s intake of air.
“Spoiled rich-kid logic.” Harry told Sirius with a smile. “Draco doesn’t know what to do when he’s told no.”
“That’s ok, Harry, I just want to make sure you understand everything, and if you have any questions you have an opportunity to ask them. The book tells you to love yourself first, and everything else will follow, and that is very good advice. Never do anything you’re uncomfortable with, be safe, all that general advice. You’ve read the chapter on the cleaning and preparation spells, right?”
“She’s not even that pretty,” Pansy simpered from behind Draco, for about the millionth time since she had first seen her. Draco made a face quickly before his mask slid back into place. It was necessary for the time being.
Ron snorted. Harry stared. He had started pulling his robes off but halted in the action. Ron was acting very strange. He was not looking at Harry very pointedly, with a scowl across his face. “What’s wrong?” Harry asked.
“And that there lies the problem.” Hermione said darkly. “But we’re getting off-topic. All we wanted to talk to you about is the horcruxes. They are still most important to us. What were you doing at the Ministry of Magic?”
They exchanged nervous looks as they waited for her to come back. She handed stained and ripped paper menus to each of them and returned to the back of the bar without a word or looking at either of them.
Draco squeezed his hand, and Harry looked over at him. Draco was looking at the graves. “Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Potter. I wish we could have met in person. I know that you were wonderful people, because your son is the best person I’ve ever met. I love him more than anything in the world. I promise you that I will take good care of him and love him every day for the rest of my life. I want to thank you for the gift of him. I know I can’t ask for you blessing, and that you gave him life without considering me, but I promise I will always treat him as a treasure him as if you had.”
“Wouldn’t you like to officially join our ranks first, then you may seek your reward, a task set unto you by me?”
“Don’t be, you’re worth it, and it’s not your fault anyway.” He said quietly, Harry smiled and kissed his cheek. Before he could pull too far back, Draco chased his mouth and gave him a chaste kiss. They continued swaying to the music.
“Could it have something to do with the bonding ceremony?” Harry asked. Draco blinked and was off, searching for the bonding book. He found the page on the Anima Mea Bond and re-read it. There was a reference on the next page about different degrees the bonding could result in, could this be one of them?
“The Champion for Durmstrang,” Dumbledore announced after a skillful pause for suspense, “is Viktor Krum!” The Great Hall erupted into applause as a figure from the Slytherin table got up and walked to a door to the side of the Teacher’s Table.
He got down on his knee, the one opposite Draco, so they were eye to eye. “Draco Lucius Malfoy,” he said. “I will marry you and love you for the rest of my life. I can’t wait to become your husband.” They moved forward and hugged each other. Harry hugged lighter than he wanted to, unwilling to hurt Draco. He couldn’t believe how happy he was. He loved Draco so much, and he couldn’t believe he would be allowed to for the rest of his life.
He didn’t deserve to have them know what Draco meant. They didn’t deserve to know. Why should he share anything with these people who didn’t believe him?
For the rest of the night, Harry was worried. There was a party in the common room that started as soon as the rest of the fifth years got back that breached for dinner before resuming after. Harry didn’t make it, as he had a date with Draco.
“Finally, a son who will do as asked the first time. Why didn’t I do this years ago?” Lucius Malfoy muttered, not that anyone could take in what he was saying. “Good night, son,” he said more loudly. “Enjoy your last night of freedom.” He laughed as he left.
“Well…” He could feel his heart sinking. “I understand, I really do. Why don’t you think about it, and if you decide you want to try, send me an owl. I just want you to know,” he swallowed. Draco’s eyes were boring into his, “I care about you, and I care about what happens to you. Know that, no matter what else happens, and whatever you have to do.” Draco continued staring, and Harry felt very vulnerable.
Harry had never seen the Weasley twins so out of their element. He was rather proud to have put that look on their faces. He felt slightly guilty about Ron, who looked rather sick. Hermione’s wand clattered to the floor. Maybe he should have at least warned them before throwing this on them.
He and Dudley started talking. Just when Harry was ready to use his wand, a streetlight went out. Then another, and another. The air began to chill. It was two dementors.
“Fine. I won’t worry.” With that, he got up and headed up the stairs. Harry and Hermione exchanged worried looks.
He really was a baby. He was in tears, and he held the letter close to his chest. He sniffed it carefully and inhaled Harry’s faint scent. He missed Harry so much. This was just what he needed for today.
Hogwarts was in the distance, coming ever closer. Harry glanced over to Dumbledore, who was sturdy on his broom, determined, despite what had just happened. The cave had been horrible, and force-feeding Dumbledore whatever had been in that potion might have been the worst thing he had ever done.
They got some exercise wandering around the campsite, then climbing what seemed like thousands of sets of purple stairs. They were in the Top Box along with the Minister for Magic, several ministry workers, and the Malfoys! Harry gasped when he saw Draco enter the box with his family. A shocked expression flashed across his face for a moment before his Slytherin Mask slipped back in place. Words were exchanged between Mr. Weasley, Mr. Malfoy and the Minister, but Harry was paying too much attention to Draco to listen. They exchanged heated glares throughout the match to cover for all the times they turned to stare at each other.
Back on the screen, Harry came to the next obstacle. It looked like a tortoise with a jewel encrusted shell, a fire crab if Draco wasn’t mistaken. It reared back so it was facing away from Harry and a ball of flame shot from its rear. Harry threw himself down on the ground to avoid the fireball and rolled behind another hedge. He looked back at the crab and ducked again as a second ball came at him. Harry took a deep breath and hit a stunner directly on its bum.
Harry did so, and continued unwrapping. He used his method but did pick it up a bit. They did have a party to get to.
Draco didn’t look upset or even surprised. “I already told you it’s ok, Harry. Say it when you mean it and not a second before. There’s no pressure, because I plan on being with you for a long time. As long as you’ll have me.” A warmth glowed inside him at Draco’s words. It was nice, this being loved thing, he could definitely get used to it. He hugged Draco close to him, enjoying the feel of him.
“We agreed to tell them we’re friends, not that we’re sleeping together, not that we’re engaged. Anything else wouldn’t have made any sense. And I didn’t want to get into it, it wasn’t the right time.”
Draco took his face in between his hands and kissed him deeply. Harry moved his hands over the soft fabric covering Draco’s muscles, making sure to touch every inch. Draco’s tongue was so sweet, and he loved having it in his mouth, but he was very excited to have something else in his mouth. He pecked Draco a couple times to distance himself, using his tongue to trace Draco’s lips, giving him his best sexy look as he moved further down Draco’s body, making sure to touch every expanse.
Draco’s glare slowly faded, and Harry made a mental note not to touch that nerve again. Would they ever be able to have a conversation without one of them upsetting the other?
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows as Harry got closer. “What can I do for you, Mr. Potter?” He asked pleasantly.
He took in the strange sight of a terrified, but fierce-looking Draco with his wand out and ready, standing in his still grungy kitchen and it was like two worlds were suddenly colliding before they were ready to.
Draco shrugged and rolled his eyes. “Harry, you’re not going to be fighting with her forever, and if you’re really worried, you can give it to our daughter. Is there anything else that caught your eye before I check out?”
“I remember you kissed me. Maybe it’s like that muggle fairy tale you told me about, where the girl got kissed by the handsome prince and woke up from an enchanted sleep.” His tone made it clear he was joking.
They pulled back slowly, neither wanting to stop, smiles on both faces. Draco’s hand came down to his and he grasped it tightly. “Let’s do this.” Draco said, and Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Maybe, I just wouldn’t say it,” Harry tried to joke. Ginny bumped his shoulder, harder than necessary. “It really isn’t that big of a deal, Ginny. Most people have already forgotten about it.”
“I love you, too.” He reached over with his hand and took Harry’s. Harry scooted over until he could lean his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry immediately went to Draco’s bed, wanting to take him in. Merlin, he was so gorgeous. He was reminded of how Draco had looked under the lake when he had been spelled asleep. His hair wasn’t floating, and he wasn’t tinged green from the water, but the peace written across his face was apparent. He was alright, whatever the state he was in. Harry could be happy that he was ok, or would be soon. He raised a hand to Draco’s cheek, cupping it lovingly.
“Okay, we really need to talk about this, and the sooner the better.” Draco finally broke. Immediately, Harry agreed and reached across the table for Draco’s hand.
His romantic thoughts took a backseat after the next attack. Hermione and a Ravenclaw prefect had been petrified, and he was horrified. He threw himself into his work, both academic and the personal mystery of the Chamber of Secrets.
“That is enough.” Dumbledore said, and his voice was solid as steel, brokering no argument. “It is getting late, and I’m sure the students have parties to attend to. Harry, Cedric, congratulations on being chosen. Despite any complications, it is an honor to have been chosen. The First Task will be held on November twenty-fourth. Barty?”
Draco let out a moan, and Harry found it so delicious he wanted another one. So, he went for the jugular, literally. He kissed and licked, cataloging each and every gasp and moan. His neck started to hurt at some point and pulled Draco forward, aiming for the cushion pit in front of the chairs. Draco landed on Harry.
“We’re not going into the wizarding world, then, are we?” There was a note of nervousness in his voice.
“My nose is all better, thank you very much for asking after we’ve been here for hours. So nice of you, Sweetheart. Really.”
“Yeah, yeah, it’s hilarious. Are you quite done yet?” That just sent Draco into further peals of laughter.
“Alright. You really think this is the right thing to do?” Draco nodded very seriously. Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath, choosing to just let Draco make the decision. "As long as you’re sure. Alright, let’s do this.” Draco jumped up before Harry could dislodge him.
“I dunno…” He stared at the clip with doubt. What if they never did make up? He’d just have a random hair clip cluttering up his possessions for the rest of his life, a symbol of failure he wouldn’t be able to just get rid of, for hope of a someday.
Draco held up a small paper bag, smiling slightly. Harry grinned back and pulled out the invisibility cloak from his inner pocket. Thanks to Draco’s warning, he had been carrying it around with him in case he needed to escape the clutches of any madmen.
Sirius turned from him, taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. Harry waited, hoping there wouldn’t be too much of an explosion. It didn’t come. After a couple beats, Sirius turned back and gave Harry his best try at a smile.
Draco resumed toweling his hair dry. “Honestly, I’d forgotten too, until I saw you hold it again. It feels like forever since all that took place.”
When he reached the side of the wardrobe that contained Draco’s dress robes, he paused. It seemed so long ago that he had last seen Draco dressed as a Wizard, sitting with his chin set at a defiant angle during his trial before the Wizengamot. The young man he knew now little resembled the boy he had known then, yet he felt a tenderness for them both that was unexpected in its intensity.
As if on cue, the young man looked up and saw Draco, with no sign of recognition on his face. “Excuse me, do you work here?”
Draco could think of a few, but he was more interested in Harry at the moment. “Ah, not really. Most of them you probably can guess. Wizarding lineage, privileged upbringing, filial duty, et cetera, et cetera.” He gestured with one hand at the corner of the room before remembering that he was still holding a drink, and a little liquid sloshed over onto the carpet. “Whoops, sorry. I meant to ask, what is that over there?”
“Wena’s wand, girl, I knew that was a good pick,” Draco all but exclaimed as he abandoned the polo rack and Harry. “How does the fit work for you? Do you like it or do you prefer something more flowing?”
“I’ll still help you get there, don’t you worry. As soon as we’re certain that Ginny is out of harm’s way. Auror Hawken is very capable, but she is fairly new at the job.”
“Can’t we at least wait until after breakfast?” he asked plaintively as they poured past him into the hallway.
Harry hurried back to the kitchen to check on the sauce. “You’ll find out in a moment. Can I get you anything to drink?”
And yet, there was something comforting in the feel of settling onto a broom and wrapping his arms around Harry. His back was unexpectedly broad, and when Draco turned one ear toward Harry’s spine, he could hear his heart hammering away in a reassuring staccato beat. Draco was very aware of his hands, not knowing where to put them, before landing just below Harry’s waist, resting a hand on either hip. He was suddenly taken over by a feeling of vertigo that had little to do with flying.
“Why don’t we fly over the city this time, take in the nightscape? I know it’s late, but there should still be plenty of lights on.”
“Tell me about Auror training, I can’t seem to get much out of Harry about it,” Draco urged him when the list wound down. “Surely you have some hair-raising stories to tell.” Draco could feel the effects of the Glenfidditch settling about him like a warm cloak, and snuggled a little closer into Harry’s side.
Harry cleared his throat. “Well, um, he’s very nice. A little hard to approach at first, but once you get to talking with him, he has a lot of interesting things to say. He knows London pretty well, and we went shopping the other day. He said I needed to upgrade my look.”
“Right.” Harry regained the presence of mind to kneel and unfasten the skylight. It was shaky going down the ladder, but he managed to get back to ground in one piece. “Almost one piece,” he corrected himself out loud.
“True. But it hardly requires much of me, besides standing around and looking mildly bored with the whole thing. Which would be correct.”
“So is Nigel your – “ Harry began, but Draco cut him off with a hand over his mouth, as he leaned in to press the entire warm length of his body against Harry’s.
The tone of the conversation became less fraught as Harry explained to Hermione what he had been going through with Draco. “It’s – I don’t know how to say it, it’s almost as if we’ve been given a chance to revisit our past and rewrite the negative history between us. I can’t say things have been perfect. I wanted to tell you, and Ron, and Ginny, and pretty much everyone in our inner circle, but Draco made me promise that I wouldn’t. We were fine until last weekend, I’ve been avoiding him because he’s been so insufferable about wanting to keep it a secret from his family.”
“It’s called the World Wide Web, Draco. I don’t have the greatest setup, maybe we can go back to your place instead.”
Draco scoffed. “You should talk, I’ve never seen more scarf-wearing than among you Gryffindor lot. Or less taste in color coordination.”
“Was he now?” Harry’s eyebrows had disappeared into his fringe, and Draco wanted badly for him to wipe that saucy grin off Ginny’s face. He was not used to being emasculated by a woman he could snap in half like a stick of peppermint, although she would definitely scorch his mouth in the process. “Well, did he also tell you that he can produce a full Patronus, even though he was never taught how at Hogwarts?”
Harry regretted their agreement as soon as the com-spell ended, but he didn’t have the heart to cancel. The dream of several nights ago was still lingering at the edge of his consciousness, and he wondered if it was making him more twitchy than usual.
inner Gryffindor.” Seeing the raised eyebrows and curled lip about to spring into action, Harry kept going. “You know you have it in you somewhere, the desire to do something daring without worrying too much about the specifics. Or the consequences.”
Draco acquiesced and put the wand aside in a drawer next to his bed. He was more interested in finding out what Harry had in store for him than he was willing to let on, but for now he would let it go.
Harry blinked, taken aback by the reminder. “Good to know, thanks.” He started to bundle the scarf around his neck, then saw Draco looking at him with what could have been either disgust or amusement. “What?”
There were several repeats of this throughout the next couple of days, as the Saturday of the Christmas Ball loomed near, and Draco contemplated spelling up Ginny, or Hermione, or Salazar’s balls, even Ron. He knew that Harry could be anxious from time to time, but never had he seen him so thoroughly trapped in the coils of his own making. It almost helped to negate Draco’s own feelings of trepidation around his mother and her inevitable reaction when the news hit.
Again, I plead general ignorance of London and Harrods. Let me know if I’ve written anything inaccurate, keeping in mind that this chapter takes place in October 2001 – things might have been a little different then.
Harry banked and began a lap around the lake, which glimmered darkly in response to the stars above. A breeze had kicked up and whistled past Draco’s ears, making him wish he’d picked out a cap from Harry’s closet, no matter how dreadful. He settled instead for flipping up the collar on Harry’s coat, which seemed to help a little.
“I like to come up here often during the summer,” Harry shouted over one shoulder, “but as you can tell, it gets a little chilly at night. Let me know if you get too cold and we can head back to London.”
One possible reason for why he looked so put together became apparent when Harry followed him to the end of the street, at a distance so Malfoy wouldn’t notice him. Waiting for Malfoy was another young man who could only be described as – well, Harry’s suspicions were confirmed when Malfoy put away his mobile phone and greeted him with a kiss. He was too far away to hear what was said, but the body language was unmistakable.
“Of course I do,” he breathed, after the kiss was over. “I’m having too much fun to get hung up on something as silly as planning for the future right now. Although I do rather hate the idea of sharing you with anyone.”
, he thought to himself, before turning to one side and seeking out Draco’s warmth. Draco had curled away from him, facing toward the window, and Harry instinctively snuggled up against his back, receiving a faceful of fine blond hair. It was remarkable how close in height they were, although Draco was longer in the legs and Harry had put on more muscle in recent years. His left hand landed on Draco’s hip, which he stroked absent-mindedly, marveling at the smoothness of Draco’s skin. He noticed for the first time a scarring on the inside of Draco’s left forearm, but decided to ask about it later, when they weren’t so spent.
They were in the library for a little while before Kreature came in. “One of Kreature’s Masters is back. Kreature wonders if the other one will join. Kreature wonders what they want.” He muttered obviously.
When Ron sat down, he considered leaving to go to the library. Perhaps he would find a book on the Imperius curse and get some background information. He knew he didn’t need to be responsible for getting Draco out of his current state, as it was being handled, but he never felt good about not doing anything.
, so Harry picked up the pace even more. Draco started thrusting into Harry’s hand and that just felt incredible, so he started coming. Draco followed seconds later, before collapsing on Harry’s chest. Harry groaned at the mess combining on their stomachs and began searching for his wand.
Hermione glanced at Ron again before answering. “Schrimdgure wouldn’t give us either. He said to tell you to come see him at the Ministry since he couldn’t find you.”
Hermione went back to her notes, thoughts of failure pushing her, as they always did. She shook her head to clear it, hoping to hear her notes, not her voice taunting her she would fail everything. She might freeze and forget everything, maybe she would miss her alarm and be late, maybe she would wake up in her bed at home, this whole experience of Hogwarts a dream. Those were the thoughts that kept her up at night, that pushed her forward, that made up what she was.
“Over here,” Draco called. Harry looked around, startled. The spell that had been played on him had broken, and there was nothing strange about the tiara, except why would someone put it there? Draco was waving to him, so he followed him over to a familiar looking wardrobe. It was big, and he had climbed inside a very identical one four years ago at Borgin and Burkes. This one appeared a little more worn, like it had been dropped from a height.
Harry shook his head. “No, Kreature, you’ve been a lot of help. I’m sure Regulus would be proud.” That was a mistake to say, as Kreature burst into loud tears. Harry and Draco tried to shush him, but a loud voice outside the door halted them.
“Hey,” Draco caught him watching him, and tried to appear stern as he wagged a finger at Harry. “Stop ogling me and get dressed. I don’t know how to make French toast.” He tossed Harry a shirt, staring just as much as Harry had as he dressed.
“Oh,” Harry said, feeling warmth deep inside him. “I thought it was a spur-of-the-moment thing when you asked. That first time.”
Draco hummed and licked his lips before he kissed Harry. He absolutely loved kissing after they pleasured each other. He could taste their delicious tastes mixing, creating the best flavor he had ever had the pleasure of trying.
“I am appalled and disgraced to have heard about all my client, Mr. Peter Pettigrew has had to go through. And before even hearing his story, you are writing him off as a Death Eater! Why, he doesn’t even have the mark that all Death Eaters bear! He has been accused of some awful crimes, when all he was doing was trying to fight those forces of evil he stands accused of consorting with. It is a mockery of justice that he is even being tried in the first place. It is Sirius Black who has committed the crimes my client has been accused of, and I am going to prove it during these proceedings. I only hope the ladies and gentlemen of the Wizengamot will open their hearts to listen to my client. Thank you!” His voice was disgustingly slick, just as his hair. He had started out impassioned but got sadder and sadder the more his speech went on. Harry was amazed. Was anyone really buying that? He looked around, but the faces he saw were blank masks, similar to Draco’s.
Albus conjured a chair and sat down heavily. He really was too old for this. He disillusioned himself and the chair as well, just in case either occupant of the bed were to awaken before he had a chance to decide what to do.
Draco looked at him, meeting his eyes, “Everything’s fine.” He said. Harry looked, but couldn’t find the lie he expected to find. He could tell there was something wrong, but if Draco really didn’t want to talk about whatever it was, he could respect that. Somewhat. “Except for that stupid name you insist on calling me.” Draco continued. Harry rolled his eyes.
After Mr. Malfoy left, Harry and Draco were silent, although the surrounding students were not. They decided to leave and held hands as they made their retreat. Since Ron and Hermione had beat their retreat, Harry could spend as long as he wanted with Draco.
“The same goes for all of you as well. I know most of you have been on the wrong end of either my wand or my harsh words. I want you all to know that I regret my actions. For what it is worth, I am sorry.” If people were surprised before, they definitely were now.
“Thank you,” Harry said, and held out his hand. Cedric shook it, and said he hoped he could still write to Harry. Harry agreed, and they departed. Harry was confused why Hermione ducked into the compartment as he came back.
Harry closed his eyes and took several deep breaths, trying to psych himself up. It proved to be unnecessary as he heard a deep voice calling, “imperio!”
“Sure.” Neither got up or moved much. Harry ran his hand up and down Draco’s back, caressing softly.
Hermione launched immediately into a detailed break down of the test. Ron and Neville quickly lost interest, looking off into the distance, as Harry tuned her out. Now he thought about it, if Sirius went with the rest of the Order, and he was sure he would, he had reason to be worried about him. Would there be a fight at the Ministry?
“Oh!” Hermione looked surprised; her eyes shot to Ron before looking back to Harry. “Thank you, Harry, I’m almost done with the one I had, and I was worried I was going to be bored. That was very thoughtful of you.”
Draco had his eyes clenched shut, head thrown back as he rode out the pleasure that was being pounded into him. He couldn’t have seen or cared about anything happening outside of the love they were making.
Sirius smiled at him. The answers, in Harry’s mind, amounted to, essentially, nothing. At least, not good enough. He was seriously worried about Voldemort, and his future was bleak with him on the horizon. The answers he got made him feel resentment and wrathful.
He vaguely heard Sirius in the background saying, “finally, some quiet,” but he was too focused on the smooth lips under his. He heard a couple noises in the background, and Sirius telling them off. He held the kiss for a couple seconds, not letting it deepen too much, before pulling back.
“No, of course I know you don’t want an open marriage or anything like that, it just…makes me sad to think of what your life might have been like, without me. What…would have happened?”
His feelings for Ron and Hermione were still rather complicated. He had waited until Draco was conscious to even attempt to sort them out, but he still found the idea of working on that to be less than desirable. The pain was still raw and he didn’t want to think about them and what they had done.
“I don’t think we do. Just forget I said anything.” He dodged around Lupin, but he got a hold of him as he was making his escape.
“So,” Sirius said when he was about half-way done. “There’s going to be another raid on Malfoy Manor later today, since the wards are still down. Draco, considering you’re injured, I really don’t think you should go, but I was hoping I could talk to you about some of the Manor’s defenses and the Death Eater movement.” Draco nodded, but Harry could see his jaw was locked. It went against everything he was to betray the secrets of Malfoy Manor, but he would do it to fight Voldemort.
“We should check him for dark magic,” Ron said to Hermione. “Who’s to say he hasn’t hexed him to make him think this is all true when he really is trying to take advantage of him?”
Draco was already sitting up in bed, and he jumped up as soon as he saw Harry appear in the room. He opened his arms and Harry fell into them, feeling the rest of the tension he was feeling melt away. All that was left was exhaustion and sadness. Draco held him, knowing exactly what he needed, then led Harry to the bed, and tucking him in before he found his place next to him.
“What are we doing?” Harry asked as they made their way into the kitchen. Sirius pulled out takeout containers and put one in front of Harry and one in front of Draco’s seat. Draco was in front of the toaster, waiting on the bread to pop up.
Draco sighed and sat back before shrugging. “Well, I suppose we can take a small break before we get back to it. Anything you feel like doing?”
“No.” Harry said lightly. “And if you don’t like the idea of spending your birthday this way, we can do something else. I will admit, I feel a bit selfish at the idea.”
“I guess you can go to the library, I’ll show you where it is. Tell them I’ll be there soon,” he added to Lupin, who nodded.
“I don’t have the strength. I’m so weak, and you, god Harry, you are so strong. You deserve someone just as strong as you are.”
“Er, alright. Where would you like to go?” He was still confused, but Ron obviously wasn’t about to explain.
He decided to lay down on the couch, the stresses of the day overcoming him. He was face down in the cushions, groaning, when he felt the pressure of Draco climbing on top of him. The groan turned into a moan as Draco covered his body with his own, leg on leg, arm on arm. He felt a couple kisses on the back of his neck and hummed.
To his utter surprise, there was Draco. “Hadn’t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn’t like
“Is that a crime now? Lay off the man, Hermione.” Ginny glared at her then turned to Harry. “I enjoy seeing you so cheerful, Harry. Your smile looks good on you.”
He arrived at the dormitory before he opened the letter. He was glad he knew it was from Draco because it wasn’t signed.
However, he was pulled into an empty classroom before he made it very far. “What are you doing?” He asked once he realized it was Fred and George that had pulled him in. “How come you’re not going to Hogsmeade?”
“Then trust me enough to let me make this decision about my life. Believe me, if I thought I was in enough danger and I thought it would help, I would dump your sweet arse in a second. But I don’t believe that. I think that you will protect me against anything, and the safest place I will ever be is by your side. I think that you and I together is a winning match. I think that you need me to defeat Voldemort. I think that you will need me to take care of you. I think I love you more than anything in the world. I think that together, we can take on anything.”
“And how am I supposed to do that?” Harry raised his eyebrows enthusiastically. He was tired, and a part of him just wanted to crawl into bed and cuddle into Draco and go right to sleep. Another part wanted to reconnect to Draco after their spat and enjoy their time together.
He didn’t turn immediately when Draco came in, instead putting his socks in the hamper as well. “Thank you,” Draco said quietly, from the bed. Harry turned, response on the tip of his tongue, but the sight of Draco sitting cross-legged on the bed holding a cake lit with seventeen candles made him loose his breath.
“Er, hi guys.” Harry said. Ron and Hermione were sitting at the kitchen table, staring him down. They both had their arms crossed, faces almost a glare, but more firm. “What’s up?”
Harry had no real desire to vacate his seat, other than that by getting up, he would be closer to Draco. That decided it, and he was next to Draco, moving his hands down the vest, and Draco’s chest. The vest was velvety, and Harry liked the feeling of it under his hands, covering the expanse of muscle.
“I know you are, but we need to hurry. Draco says he’s locked in his room, I don’t know how long he’s going to be alone.”
A couple of days after they came to that decision, a plan had been formed. The only problem was executing it. They had to wait a couple more days for an opportune moment.
Hermione shook her head. “Let’s check out the library. I bet that there will be some useful books in there.” Ron and Harry looked at each other, trying not to laugh, as they followed Hermione up the stairs.
The remark made the anger, bubbling lowly just beneath the surface, boil over. “Does this,” Harry pulled on his shirt collar, unbuttoning it first. “Look like I am safe from being hurt?” The handprint on his neck was a sickly yellow and purple. There were gasps all along the table.
“Why on earth would I want to be handed the match? There’s no honor in that. I want you to go out there and give me your absolute best. When I win, it’ll be because I deserve it.” He threw a cocky smirk at Harry and bumped his shoulder lightly. “It does mean a lot to me that you offered, though. Thank you.”
He glanced at Draco to see him nodding along as if what Harry was saying made perfect sense. Good, at least he had some back up. He had apparently lost Ron and Hermione as reinforcement, so he was especially thankful Draco had decided to show up.
“You mean the first time he strangled me? Yeah. He hasn’t tried that before.” Sirius stopped to look at Harry.
“Brilliant. Just brilliant. I don’t know if I would have gotten away with it if it hadn’t been for you, Draco.”
“Lots of people feel that way, Harry,” Draco finally said. “It’s fine that you do. We’ll just take this really slow, as slow as you want, and if anything we do ever makes you uncomfortable, then all you have to do is say something and it stops. Sound good, sweetheart?”
Harry was barely following, between the rush of realizing he didn’t know anything about this world he had just been thrown into and the sudden reminder of Dudley. He was unsure of how to respond. He didn’t really converse with people, had rarely participated in small talk, he was sure the boy would get bored very quickly.
“Yeah. I suppose you could always talk to Kreature. Let me know if he gives you trouble and I can give him an order.”
Harry wasn’t sure how long they were there, kneeling—when had they sunk to the cold ground? —with Draco holding him while he sobbed and when had he started crying? Eventually, he got a hold of himself and mused that he did feel a bit better. He was so used to crying getting him nowhere that he often suppressed the desire to let go of his feelings when he felt like it. Now, however, he didn’t feel as empty.
“This is so…weird. You know? I could have sworn…we’ve already had…er, how many glasses have we had?”
“I never get what I want! I hate this, I hate it! Fuck—!” Draco broke down, sobbing hysterically. Harry pulled him into his arms. “Why? Why, Harry why? Why did she have to die?” Draco pushed against him before collapsing, boneless. Harry caught him and gently laid him down on the bed, not removing his arms from around him.
Harry slipped into a light doze, Draco holding him safely. He awoke later, it was dark outside. He stretched and kissed what was near his mouth.
He waited to see what Draco would say. “I was working on homework and got caught up. I didn’t see your message until five minutes ago.” Harry really wanted to believe that, but he had a hard time with it. “Did you have a hard time with the charms essay?
