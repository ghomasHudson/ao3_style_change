“Oh, congratulations.”  Harry tried his best to sound excited for the couple.  He shook Dean’s hand and hugged Ginny, then sat down next to Draco.
“Blame? Fault? And you’re sorry?  No,
He’d had the dream one other time.  But as he recalled, Draco shouted ‘Stupify’ not the killing curse.  It was the only dream in which the circumstances grew more grim.  The others began seemingly disturbing, then became more and more benign as they progressed.  And it was such a small fragment of a dream, Harry was barely able to remember much about it.  The setting was familiar, but he couldn’t exactly place it.
He adored the way Draco lovingly caressed his skin.  The way he kissed Harry tenderly. The way they connected emotionally through the bond. The way Draco made him feel revered and cherished.
However, to get things moving, Draco agreed that she would most likely be more pleasant throughout the pregnancy.  And they wanted to be kept informed as it progressed.
Harry watched him.  It was immensely pleasing to Harry, knowing that he was the cause of the expression on Draco’s face. Any doubts he had at the beginning of their evening had long since vanished.
Justin hesitated.  “I . . . realized that I never apologized to you.”
“Do you want me to do this or not?” Draco asked.
“Mione.” Ron scolded.  “You didn’t have to announce it.”
The ginger’s laughter faded. “Oh, fuck,” he said quietly.  Ron really wasn’t as stupid as he looked.
“I didn’t say.” Draco held firmly onto Harry’s hand.
“Potter, stop staring at me,” the Slytherin said without looking up.
“Really,” Harry said.  “Anything will do.”
Harry reached out his hand to Draco’s subconsciously.  “Is that why you didn’t want your mother to change it?  Because it reminds you of how things were before Voldemort took over?”
“The big project,” Harry repeated.
“I am.  All is right with the world today.”
“But I assumed it would be yours.  You have parents, biological grandparents for our child.”
“Me?” Harry frowned.
Standing in full Quidditch gear, Draco answered, “McGonagall came down to the dungeons to talk to me.  She asked how Casper Montague was doing in Potions.”  He glared at Knox.  “Now I wonder what prompted her to do that.”
“I’ll drag her to St. Mungo’s myself if I have to,” Ron said.
Stephen turned back to Harry and Draco.  “Well,
“Well, it’s not just any party.” Pansy glanced around and leaned farther over the table toward Harry, her cleavage at his eye level. He couldn’t not look.  “I can’t tell you here,” she whispered. “I’ll come to your common room tonight. Say, half-eight? Gather up the seventh and eighth years.”
Harry nodded.  “It’s a possibility.  I suggested there may be a connection to your father’s note.”  He didn’t say anything more, as he promised Ron.  But he felt a little dishonest not mentioning the rest of the conversation.  Then he thought of the other news.
“Shit!  Mione, it’s about time.”
Snapping out of his shock, Draco looked down at the messy head of hair resting on him and chuckled softly.
“More like draped yourself over him,” Harry said. “You had too much to drink that night.”
“Did it ever occur to you that maybe he simply overslept?”
Harry literally shook his head, in an attempt to focus. He was able to copy down much of it before his thoughts wandered again.
Neither of them suspected what would happen when they walked through the threshold of the Great Hall.
“Because everyone knew it was her most prized possession.  Leaving it behind made her death more believable.  We acquired it just recently when Nell’s childhood home was sold, and the contents auctioned off.”
“It’s pretty late.  We ought to go to sleep.”  He bent down to retrieve the clothes he threw off in a hurry earlier.  “Is it all right if we stay here?”
“We can’t get married that soon.”
“I don’t want to hurt him,” Harry said.  “And that’s why I can’t be your friend.  Not unless you give up on the idea of you and me.”
Hermione pushed his face up out of her bosom and giggled.  “Why don’t you go make sure we’ll have your room to ourselves.  I’ll be up in a minute.”
“He’s safe where he is.  But we’d like to have this wrapped up quickly.  If you could persuade your father to make a deal as soon as possible . . . “ Ron trailed off.
Anthony’s shoulders dropped.  “Seriously?  You don’t think she can handle herself alone?”
Draco shook his head. “Nothing. I just can’t believe this is happening.”
“But I don’t want to just leave with my tail between my legs.”
Harry grinned.  “I’ll think about it.”
Harry shook his head emphatically.  “Not at all.  Everybody wanted something from me.  It was like I was everybody’s saviour---okay, poor choice of words.  Maybe I was because of Voldemort, but people wanted more.  I like the life I have at Hogwarts much better. What about you?”
young.”
Suddenly, a small shower of sparks burst from the cake in a dazzling display.  As they fell back down onto the plate, the sparks formed words that lay sprinkled across the chocolate confection.
“Don’t bother putting those back on,” Draco told him. He took them out of Harry’s hand and tossed them on the jacket Harry had already taken off. Harry changed his hair back and stood, almost eye to eye with Draco.
Harry closed the journal and put down the quill.  Draco walked out onto the balcony and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder.  Harry looked up at him and smiled.
Pulling his jersey over his head, Draco smoothed out his wet hair.  “What things?  What do you mean?”
“What are you doing in here?”
“Of course she does,” he assured Ron.  “Why wouldn’t it open for her, though?”
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, stirred by the sight of Draco’s bare chest.
Pansy shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Maybe we’ll find out that we have nothing to talk about.  But maybe we’ll find out that we do.  Maybe I’ll find out what it’s like to have a normal relationship, instead of bed-hopping.”
Draco suddenly stood and bowed slightly to the Headmistress.  “Excuse me.  I just remembered a matter which requires my attention.”
Without another word, Harry left Gryffindor and walked purposefully to Ginny’s room.  When he arrived, Dean was there as well.  But Harry would have expected that.
“Pansy doesn’t need me.  She’s had Longbottom and now Nott.”
“I wasn’t going to,” he said, wiping away a tear or two.
Harry’s little speech wiped the sour expression from the potion right off Draco’s face. In theory, he agreed with Harry. Blaise had been the only friend-turned-lover for Draco, but they never had the sort of relationship Harry had with Ginny. He supposed it had something to do with the fact that there was no pretense of love involved. He and Blaise were in it for the sex. As intense as his physical reaction to Harry was, he didn’t want their relationship to be only about sex.
Ginny glared at her brother.  “I’m not that big.”
He had taken advantage of the house elves’ willingness to please him and had asked for a spread worthy of Draco’s tastes.  Harry included items that he himself didn’t care much for, such as roast duckling and caviar for his love.  But he made sure to include things he liked, too.  He wanted to have enough energy to keep up with what was sure to be a busy night.  In anticipation of being too worn out, he was already considering skipping classes the next day.
While Draco magically locked the door and set a silencing charm, Harry conjured up a soft pad and a few pillows.  They set their things aside and sat down.
“What?” Harry prodded.
“If Draco was with him, they’d be able to get out.”
“We should probably get back as well,” Draco said.  “Make sure we have everything packed and ready to go.  Then early to bed. Though I’m sure the excitement will make sleep difficult.”
“That was most definitely not adorable,” Harry said. “That’s worse than poop.”
“So?”
“She is a beauty,” Harry agreed.  “But she’s already got you.  The rest of us are out of luck.”  He had considered telling his friends about his sexual predilections.  But that had been before Ron made his comments.  Harry decide to leave well enough alone for the time being.
“You’re going to pass up a reading by Olivia Tifft?  Are you mad?”
The pair left the sofa and the Slytherin common room to head for the Potions room.  Draco lit a few of the lanterns with his wand.
“They told me she was over it by now.”
Theo grinned. “At least there won’t be any surprises tonight.”
‘Yeah, I guess it would be better if you went.  I don’t think I’d be much help.  I’m not so good with the little ones.”
“Fine,” he said.  “Yes. I would.  Draco and I work together as professors at Hogwarts.  We became friendly over the course of the past few months.  Recently, we have begun dating.  But we weren’t caught in a compromising position, as you put it.  I gave him a small kiss, that was it.  Any credible witnesses will corroborate that.  I would also like to clarify that he is not a Death Eater.”
Trying to smooth things over, Harry called out, “No problem. I’m happy to help.”
Draco, certain Harry was going to hit him, stopped, tensed his shoulders, squeezed his eyes shut and braced for impact.  Harry’s embrace nearly knocked him over.
“Fernwood?” Harry murmured under his breath. No wonder he went by Knox.
“I can’t see anything,” he frowned.  “What do they look like?”
“Not much, to Theo’s disappointment,” she laughed.  “We all played exploding snap.  Although, Theo tried his best to turn it into strip exploding snap,” she laughed again.  Anthony joined her. “What about you?”
Carrying a tray with a steeping pot of tea and four small handleless cups, Draco entered the drawing room.
“I’m not staying,” Ernie groused.  He started to walk out but when he got more than five feet away from Anthony, he began to feel nauseous.  Anthony did as well.  The feeling only subsided when they moved closer together.
Harry smiled.  “Potter-Malfoy,” he corrected.
Alone with Draco Malfoy since . . . since never, she realized. Hermione sat back down at the coffee table, prompting Draco to do the same.
Harry shifted her and bounced her while Draco gently patted her back. Suddenly, she burped and Harry’s shoulder was covered in thick, yellow mucous.
He stood a moment, and was about to knock, when a small house elf came out with a tray of half-eaten food.
Harry lowered his head.  “Yes, but all that stuff she printed didn’t really happen that way.  We barely even spoke with her. And it was only one little kiss.”
“If Professor Malfoy is still home taking care of his mother, I’d be happy to fill in for him over Christmas,” Knox piped up.
“What?” Blaise frowned.
“Great.  Just fuckin’ great,” Ron smiled uneasily.
“Fine.  Just get on with it.”  Tracey lay back down on her bed.  She had drawn her curtains and placed a silencing charm around them as Daphne had done.
Draco pinched at Harry’s nipple as he pounded into him from behind, over and over so hard that Harry almost lost his balance.  His other hand tugged roughly at Harry’s cock.  A sticky layer of sweat covered both their bodies, adding to the smell of sex filling the room.  They’d been at it for what seemed like days.
“Yes, why?”
Draco strode to a liquor cabinet that Harry could see was not very full.
Harry glanced quickly at Draco before speaking.  “How are you holding up, Knox?”
Pansy nodded.  “I couldn’t help feeling at least partly responsible for his downfall.  Somehow, he managed to forgive me.  But he’ll never love me again.”
“Harry! Draco!” Hermione squealed when she saw their faces through the floo network.  “Come through, come through.  I can’t wait to hear all about your trip.”
“You can mess up whatever you want, now.”
Harry nodded.
Ron frowned.  “How’d you do that?”
He looked at her hesitantly.  Did she mean for him to leave her and go tell Draco how he felt?
“I’ll be right back.” Draco kissed Harry and raced out of the room, as if he thought Harry would change his mind if he took too long.
“Are you really excited about the trip?” Harry asked while they walked up the stairway to their quarters.
Food arrived at the table and the conversation slowed while the four companions ate. Ron, who finished eating first, restarted the conversation.
They moved together in relative silence, save for their labored breathing and occasional grunts.
“Uh, he-he, I don’t know.  I didn’t think I’d get this far.” He blushed.  “Hogsmeade?  Are you doing anything this afternoon?”
In all, nine students stood amongst their classmates.  Some, well known for their sexual orientation, some acknowledging for the first time publicly.
Without even looking up, Harry answered. “Not one word, Finnigan.  Not. One. Fucking. Word.”
Harry smiled. “I know.  And it’s okay.  I want it to be right for both of us.  Let’s just eat breakfast and get through the day. I’ll talk to McGonagall later to tell her what happened, in case someone from the Prophet tries to get a story out of her.”
“No. Don’t.” Harry pushed his hips back to meet Draco’s more forcefully.
Just in case, he decided to give it a full hour.  When he felt the charms being disturbed, Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
Draco smirked.  “No doubt. But I have one more question.”
hdhdhd
June 15 1999
Deep down, Harry knew he was probably right.  His relationship with Draco could be used against him, if it came down to a fight.  Harry hoped it wouldn’t come down to that.
“Looney Lovegood’s doppelgänger?”
sister, you know.  Anyway, you’re free to play the field.  Maybe next party you’ll get Greengrass.  Not that you really need to wait for an excuse”
“How does it feel?” Harry asked, concerned.
“Yes, I know, which is why it took me so long to figure you out.”
Giving Harry a sideways glance, then purposely avoiding his gaze, Draco explained, “You’re right, of course.  I do want something for myself.  I want to spend all my time with him.  I want to . . . live with him, for the rest of my life, if he’d have me.”
“You’re asking me advice about your love life?”
“Yes, so do I.  Reviewing five year’s worth of Potions in three weeks isn’t nearly enough.  Hopefully, the students have been studying for a while now.  Except for the Tri-Miones. I don’t have to worry about them.”
“I could really use something stronger than lemonade,” Harry confessed.  “This has been exhausting.  They have so many questions. And too much money.  It took forever to get out of Honeydukes.”
“Then stop saying stupid things!” Hermione retorted.
heal them?” Draco asked rhetorically, then gulped the last of the firewhiskey.
“I haven’t given it any thought,” Harry said.  “I only have a week to come up with a costume.  How are you dressing up?”
Ginny lowered her head. “I was only concerned.”
She pulled a book from behind her back and handed it to him.  They stared at one another, each trying to force the other into talking first.  Draco could see that she was too stubborn to ask him to read to her.  But he wasn’t about to volunteer.  He could be equally stubborn.
“They were willed to the school.  I suppose for purposes such as yours.  They wanted to have their wands go to good use.”  She took another wand from the box and placed it on her desk.  “Perhaps, Colin Creevey’s wand would be more appropriate.”
“Perhaps I should take a leave and go stay with her until this is all settled,” Draco mused aloud.
Draco obeyed gladly.  They lurched and reeled together, picking up speed until Harry let loose.  Pearly white cum pooled on the couch in front of him while he whimpered.
Nott glanced around the room.  “You know, since we placed our wands in the cauldron, it’s an official wand party.  We’re basically magically sealed in until midnight.”
Harry chuckled at Draco’s discomfort. “She’s brought you a book.  Read to her.” He smiled.  “I wonder how she knew you were excellent at reading aloud.”
“No, of course not.  It wasn’t meant personally.  I probably would have said the same thing to McGonagall if she were there.”
“That was bloody brilliant,” he panted.  Lifting his head to look at her, he smiled.  “All of it.  Are you all right?”
“Oi, mate, what are you doing back?” Blaise asked, surprised.  “Not that I’m not glad to see you.”
“I thought you were going with the red.”
Just then, a knock came on the door.
“I don’t think I’m going to like this one any better,” Ron guessed.
Draco opened his mouth to snap back, but he knew Harry was right.  He was jealous. And despite his apparent cockiness and somewhat confident manner, he couldn’t help wondering when the novelty would wear off.  For the time being, Harry was enjoying his rebellious streak, thumbing his nose at a society that simultaneously took him for granted and idolized him.  Announcing his homosexuality and relationship with one of the Dark Lord’s chosen peons was the ultimate ‘fuck you’.
Hermione wrinkled her nose.  “That place is always full of drunks.  Can’t we go to The Three Broomsticks or someplace in muggle London?”
“Actually, you should speak with him.”  He jerked a thumb in Harry’s direction.  “He’s the one who used it.”
“No.”
Draco couldn’t help but smile.
“It’s not past curfew yet,” Harry snickered.  “I meant, why are you wandering the classrooms alone?”
Harry reached his hand down and eased Draco out of him.  He turned in place and gripped the erection purposefully. Draco rolled onto his back and closed his eyes.  He came within a few minutes with a gasp and a curl of his toes.
“I wonder what he’s going to say tomorrow,” Hermione mused.  “Any idea what name Malfoy is going to give, Ron?”
“I prefer the word sophisticated,” said Harry.  “I like that about you.  I guess opposites really do attract.”
“They’ve known about my infatuation for a little over a week.” He sniggered, “If they only knew it was actually–” Draco cut himself off.
Harry carefully lay down next to Draco on the marble floor. That was half the problem. The floor was keeping him cold. Harry needed to put something between Draco and the marble.
“You came to see me?”
“I’m fine. You should go before someone sees you talking to me.”
Harry shrugged.  “I dunno.  Maybe.  It would be worth a shot.  Otherwise, they’ll all waste away in Azkaban.”
“Oh, I love Paris,” Horace squealed.  He went on and on about his many trips to Paris.  He and Draco talked about their favorite places in France and even spoke a bit in French.
“I wasn’t talking to you,” Lucius sneered.
Parvati closed her eyes as Harper made the first cut, almost at her shoulders. “My mother is going to kill me,” she muttered.
They sat in the same corner booth from their first pub night.  Harry went on and on about the match, while Draco listened and watched.
Harry and Draco both leaned over their newly completed potion and breathed in.  Harry laughed at the scent.
“Draco?  What did he have to do with it?”
Justin leaned over toward his side and closed his eyes.  Millicent, still somewhat shocked by his display, huffed and slammed the book shut before leaning back against the window frame.  She was partly dismayed by the fact that she actually did enjoy watching. The last thing she remembered thinking before falling asleep was which punishment she would face in the morning.
“I don’t like getting locked out of my own room.  I give you every Friday night to yourselves. And plenty of other times.”
Harry nodded.  “A bit.”
“I’m sorry I was such a prat before,” Draco said between bites.  He glanced up at Harry.
“You’re awfully quiet,” Draco commented as he and Harry walked back to their quarters.
Harry wondered if they were in a dark enough corner to hide them as well.  He swiftly forgot that thought when she guided one of his hands to her breast. It was not like a grapefruit at all, he thought.  More like a balloon filled with jelly.  She moaned when he kneaded it, encouraging him to carry on. Her hands slid down in the tight space between the wall and his arse, squeezing his firm cheeks.
“I’m sorry.  You two don’t want to hear about that.”
“I thought that was you, Harry. How’ve you been?” Upon closer inspection, Draco decided he hated this man. He was handsome, in a rugged, obvious way. And he clearly exercised regularly. His shoulders were a good four inches broader than Draco’s own.
“I like it a little messy. Makes me feel not so bad about the mop on top of my head.” He winked. “Shall I bring you dinner?”
“I’m sure my father has been droning on about microwaves or sewing machines, or some other muggle device he’s obsessed with,” Ron shook his head.
“I told you I bought a new book.  Did you think I was that angry I’d cancel?  It’s gonna take a whole lot more than one little fight to get rid of me.”
“Come on Mione.  You have many of those books already.  I’m getting hungry.”
They stood gazing at one another for a moment, uncertain how to end the night.  Casper looked around self-consciously.
*****
Narcissa winked. “I’ll still act surprised when I see them.”
“I suppose I could do worse,” Draco smirked. Of course, there was the matter of Harry’s little confession and waking up with the Gryffindor lying atop him. Not that Draco was truly complaining, but now there seemed to be an odd uncertainty between them. He wasn’t positive, but he thought either Harry didn’t recall what happened, or he was an exceptionally cool customer.  Draco decided it was the former, as Harry seemed to wear his heart on his sleeve normally. Draco himself would have to be the cool one.  Unfortunately, he remembered every detail of the evening.  “I certainly don’t want to get stuck with Millicent or Mandy.”
Draco nodded. “Okay,” he smiled shyly, an unusual look for Draco.
“Wait, you haven’t asked me.  You can’t just put a ring on my finger.”
Harry moaned, and turned his head toward Draco, who kissed him.
Draco walked into his dormitory to change out of robes.  He was glad it was Friday.
“I said, it’s a bit drafty in here, don’t you think?  Perhaps you ought to cover up.”  His eyes traveled down to Harry’s pants, which had gaped open a bit when he sat cross legged on the floor.  Right in front of the poor blushing girl.
“Like you and Daphne?” Ron couldn’t help the way his nose wrinkled up.
“It’s nothing.  He’s harmless. There’s nothing going on, I swear.  I don’t even know if he’s gay.”
She smiled back, shaking her head.  “I was so stubborn about that bloody cake that I ruined the moment for myself.  He was so romantic about the whole thing.”
They walked onto a staircase that moved unexpectedly to the right and dropped them off in a dark corridor.
“Yes, I do.  Harry, I want to hear that this is what you want.  And that Draco is treating you well.  He is, isn’t he?”
Draco opened his mouth to protest.
“About a month now.”
If he was being honest, he wasn’t trying too hard so the project would take longer.  But they’d been working on it for over a month and Harry had said he felt they had come up with enough new spells to spice up the classes.
“Is she all right?”
Knocking on the Headmistress’ door, Harry began to get nervous.  He wasn’t sure why he was there.  He only knew their last conversation didn’t sit right with him.
“Um, I’ve got some fire whiskey or Sherry if you’re interested in a nightcap,” Draco offered.
When they broke apart, Harry grinned.  “Don’t get too excited.  We’re keeping the peacocks.”
“That was a long time ago.  We were children, in the middle of fighting for our lives,” Harry said.  “I think I’m well over it.”
Harry was about retort when a knock came on the door.
“Harry,” Draco murmured.  He sucked at Harry’s neck, lost in his scent, while Harry gently rubbed circles on Draco’s back.
“I understand,” Harry said.  “I miss you.”
“I think I liked it better when you two hated each other,” Harry grumbled.
disappeared.  Frowning, Harry thought to himself,
“Thank you Minerva.” He stood and went to the door.  “Draco and I will be discreet.”
“But, I still have things to do tonight to get ready to leave.  Are you taking the Express in the morning?” she asked.
“Well, it wouldn’t have been my first choice for Harry, but . . .  don’t we always say we just want our friends and family to be happy?  Harry looks happier than I’ve seen him in a long time.”
“Remember, I want a good partner,” Blaise reminded his friend.
“He’s been through a lot lately.  I don’t want to make waves. And we truly are happy.  I feel . . . never mind.” Harry gave an embarrassed little laugh.
Not up to showing his face just yet, Harry nodded his head against his forearms.
Draco nodded in agreement.
“Maybe he’s aiming for fashionably late.  He is a Malfoy, after all.”
Draco took a few smaller swallows and tipped his head back, indicating that he’d had enough. Before releasing Draco, Harry rolled up some of the dish towels to use as a pillow, then eased his head down.
Ron nodded.  He made a mental note to make an effort to get to know the new Draco Malfoy and put aside their past.
“Mmm.  Is it time for our date?”
“You and Harry Poufter, who else?” Stephen laughed.
“On the contrary, you look smashing.  I never cared much for kilts before.  But it’s starting to grow on me.”  He paused.  “Well, something is.  I’m glad I’m wearing these robes.”
She smiled up at him.  “All right.  Yes, I’ll marry you. But we can’t say anything about the baby yet.”
Knox stopped, partially blocking Ron’s way.
“Thank you, Poppy, but we’re fine,” Draco replied.  “I think it’s best if you let us tend to it.”  He urged the house elf to leave before his mother became too irate and took it out on her.
“Don’t worry, Harry.  He’ll be fine.  Madame Pomfrey is taking good care of him.  He was down here yesterday afternoon getting in a little extra practice.  Put a bit too much pulverized hellabore into his potion.  I’m afraid when he stirred it, he breathed in the puff of vapor.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco stopped smiling.  “I didn’t think you were ready to, to, you know, do what I did.  And I couldn’t help it.  You had me going so much, I had to cum.”
“Then you can treat Harry, too.”
bent?”
“So,” Pansy said with a gleam in her eye.  “I haven’t told you what else happened this summer.”
After a long silence, Harry turned to leave.
“Listen to me.  Knox did . . . kiss me but I didn’t want him to.  I came here to tell you everything.  I came to tell you that you were right about him.”
“Yeah, that.” Ron pointed at Draco.  “A dummy might mess that up. But they’re dentists for Christ’s sake. They should be able to fix that sort of thing, right?”
“What?”  Harry immediately looked over at Draco’s table despite Ron’s warning.
“I just want to see what a party at Slytherin is like.”
“What if we get caught?”
Sighing, Harry sat down next to Draco on the bed.
“Yes.  Fine.”
Parvati wondered just how naive Michael was.
“Are you sure you’re all right?” Draco asked.  He bent down to pick up the Liquorice Wands that fell.  Harry tried to bend down to help, but his knee gave out. Reacting swiftly, Draco reached out and caught him before he fell. “We should get you to Madame Pomfrey.”
Suddenly, Harry slammed his fork down.  “I can’t take it anymore.  I’m going to see what happened.”  He got up from his place and walked out of the Great Hall.  Proceeding down toward the dungeons, Harry wasn’t sure what he would do once he got there.  He wouldn’t be able to get into Slytherin on his own.
“One week,” Pansy answered.  “And you may possibly lose the right to attend future wand parties.  Any more questions?”
They all bid one another good night, and Harry and Draco made their way down to the kitchens.
Draco stopped and turned around. Rather than the look of satisfaction Harry was expecting, his mouth was agape in dismay.
“Remember, Harry, my door is always open,” the Headmistress told him as he left.
“Ahem, boys,” Pansy’s voice sounded from above them.
Draco waited patiently for her to elaborate, finishing his tea.
With the evening cut short, Ron had nothing to do but clean up and return to Gryffindor.  He vanished all evidence of their romantic date, save for the single plate of remaining cake.
Draco was one flight up when he glanced down at the hallway from which he just came.  It was no surprise to see Knox making his way toward Harry’s room.
“Dean.”
Ginny, Dean, Harry and Ron sat in chairs waiting for the Welcome Witch to call them back to a room.  Each was tapping a foot or drumming fingers or biting fingernails.  Harry would have preferred to bring Draco, but since he got himself suspended from any outside activities, he brought Ron.
Tracey was surprised by how much he was trying to please her.  Most of her friends shared stories of their first time that were not so pleasant.  A lot of the boys didn’t even attempt to bring their girls.  She didn’t know Anthony other than the occasional class together, and he was treating her with more tenderness than any other boy she’d ever been with.
“Thank you.”
Harry laughed. “You don’t have to whisper. They can’t hear us.” He stopped laughing when he saw the look of pure lust in Draco’s eyes. He gasped when Draco palmed his crotch.
Timidly, he thanked her and returned the compliment.  Sitting awkwardly, naked still, neither knew precisely what to do next.
Slowly, chatter began to fill the pub again.  The foursome didn’t have to guess what the topic of most conversations would be.
“Fine,” Tracey huffed.  “Then let’s follow the boys to the kitchens.  I’m hungry too.”
“The Healer I spoke to said we may be able to narrow down which one of us is the father before the baby is born.  There’s nothing to do until I know for sure.  The trick will be getting Ginny to agree.”
Narcissa was not waiting for them at the station, and Harry took that as a bad sign.  He and Draco gathered their luggage and apparated to the Manor.
They arrived within the grand hall of Malfoy Manor, looking much the same as it did when the Dark Lord had taken it over.  It was dank and gloomy, and eerily silent.  Harry removed the cloak, folded it and placed it on a chair by the staircase.  He wanted to put it somewhere he’d be able to find it when they completed their mission.  Well, his mission.  Draco was there, primarily to redeem himself and to earn a position in the Ministry.
“You know how much it turns me on when you show off your powers.”
Harry stood and licked his lips. “Delicious,” he said, breathlessly.
Attempting to break from Harry’s hold, Draco dismissed the compliment. “Reading to a child and letting her sleep in my lap doesn’t make me a good father.  Or a father of any sort.  Perhaps I’d be an adequate babysitter . . .” He broke free.
“Get me a flannel or something.”
“I’m sorry, Hermione, but it is,” Draco said.  “Mother has already sent out the information to family and her friends.  It would be humiliating for her to have to rescind it.  I know it sounds silly to you, but in pure blood society, it simply isn’t done.  As it is, having to announce that your son is marrying another man . . .” he trailed off.
“No,” Draco laughed.  “She practically pounced on me. I suppose I could have been kinder to her.  But I pushed her away, hard, and wiped my mouth rather dramatically, even though she’d barely managed to touch my lips.”
Much to Harry’s frustration, Draco insisted on hanging his new dress robes neatly in the wardrobe before beginning any sort of romantic activities.  Harry hung his as well, avoiding a lecture about wrinkling his clothes again.
“Anyway, it’s about supper time.  You going down?” Knox asked.
“You’re on your own,” she muttered to Daphne, knowing she couldn’t possibly be heard.  “Wait!” she shouted to Anthony and caught the sleeve of his robe. As he turned to face her, Anthony saw Justin walk by grinning, giving him a thumbs up. Anthony returned the gesture, then went back to frowning.
Ginny joined the group.  “Any idea who would be the surprise guest?”
“Oh, that explains it.  His Confusing and Befuddlement Draught was a bit of a mess.  I gave him a grade for it, but not a good one,” Knox said.  “He said something about trying again.  But I told him no. He looked like he was about to cry,” he laughed.
“Oi, Harry, you’re letting him dress you now?”  He shook his head.  “You gonna let him cut your meat too?” he snickered.
“I guess we’ll find out soon enough.”
“It’s not that I don’t want to be partners with you so much as I want to be partners with someone else.” Draco bit his lip.
“Very well.  Let me just take a look at her cycle and we can schedule a time for you to come in.”
Draco’s chin quivered a moment.  “I only wanted you to love me as much . . .” He had difficulty getting the words out. “As much as I . . . love you.” He didn’t make any attempt to hide his tears.
“Thanks, Harry,” Susan Bones said as she stood.
An uncontrollable and uncharacteristic grin crossed Draco’s slightly swollen lips.  He sighed with relief.  “Good.  Because I really like you too.  But why didn’t you ever tell me you’re queer?”
“Let’s go Slytherins,” Draco called to his group.  He turned to Harry with a wavering expression.  “Should we . . . leave separately or something?”
“What?”  Harry finally asked.

“I didn’t know that,” Ron said.  “Why didn’t you say anything?”
“You can’t back out now.  They’re expecting both of us,” Harry pointed out.
Harry recalled the look on her face earlier.  “Maybe.  Usually you’re so neat and tidy.  Now that I look at you, you do look like you’ve been having a hump.”  He grinned widely.
“Practically,” she said.
“How is your mother?” Harry broke the comfortable silence.
“Sorry.  I had to get a couple of things done first.” Harry kissed his neck.
Gasping sharply, Millicent turned her body away from him and reopened the book.  She would never have admitted it but hearing him moan and grunt as he pleasured himself, made her feel a bit randy herself.  Several times, she peered over her shoulder to watch.  He was well enough endowed to make her rethink her earlier assessment of the Hufflepuff. However, his current behavior was a deal breaker.  Of course, it didn’t prevent her from taking peeks.
The girl returned it to the case.
Harry was beginning to think Slughorn only invited Miranda in order to flirt with her.  Perhaps he and Draco were wrong about his sexual orientation after all.
Harry crossed his arms over his chest in a huff. “You
“We’ve stopped the bleeding,” the healer said. “And we’re giving him blood replenishing potion.  I’d like to keep him here overnight, and possibly tomorrow night as well.  But he’s going to be fine.”
“P-P-Penelope?”
“Well, no.”  Harry scratched his head. “I was the only one who could make it work with more than one person,” he answered humbly.
Ron turned the bracelet over in his hand a few times.  “How much is it?”
“We’re going to be parents today,” Draco told her.
The journal left it as it was.  Harry smiled to himself.  He knew why it didn’t matter to him.  The journal knew all along, but it took Harry a while.
“I thought you were all right with the fact that I’ve got children in my future.”
“Oh,” Harry shuddered.  “Oh, Draco.  Right there.”
“Nothing,” Draco said quickly, looking guilty.  He stared at Harry for a moment, stiff. Then slowly, he held his hand out.  “I’m so sorry.  I broke it already.”  Draco appeared as though he was about to cry.  Harry just sat across from him, mouth gaping.
I want?” he asked in a husky voice.  He leaned back away but kept his gaze on Harry.  “What do you
“I think they’ll understand if we leave,” Draco smiled.  “It is our wedding night.”
Students descended on the storage cupboard to get ingredients for the day’s brew as usual, but this time, Harry made sure to place himself close to the blond.  Purely for research purposes, of course.
“You’re still going to Hogsmeade tomorrow, right?  Better get to sleep.” Harry called as he seemed to glide toward his dormitory.
A voice from behind Hermione called out accusingly, “What have you done?”
“Can I be frank with you?” Hermione asked.
Draco snorted through his nose and pouted.  “I let you win.  You know that, right?”
“You didn’t have to get me anything,” Draco answered sincerely.  “I’m happy just to spend Christmas with you. I wish you hadn’t wasted any money on me.”
“I don’t want to be the hero of the wizarding world, famous for one thing I’ve done.  I want to help people in a real and personal way.  And possibly to heal the Death Eaters the way I did with Draco.  The only way to figure out how, is to work with the Healers.”
“How about being my friend instead?”
“Would you quit being such a wanker.  We’re just going to take a peek.”
“I’m not afraid.”  Ron glared, then walked past her into the common room.

“Man?  Only my long time regulars know, er, knew.  I suppose a lot of them know now,” Mel laughed and looked around.  “People see what they want to see.  Or rather, they don’t see what they don’t want to see.”
Harry held out his hand.  “I’ll want all of this in writing.  No offense Mr. . . .”
“Draco Malfoy, for example?” Rita questioned.  “Is that what you’re implying?”
“Why don’t you put those off for now?  Your students can wait an extra day to get their grades,” suggested Harry.
“You know, girls are so clingy.  They need you to spend all your time with ‘em.  They like to make plans.”
“Lily’s blonde hair sort of gave it away,” Hermione confessed.
to having a real, lasting relationship with someone, and it scared the shit out of you.”
“You were absolutely amazing today,” Harry said.
“Fu--”  he looked at his students and censored himself.  “Gosh, that hurt.”
Blaise shrugged a shoulder.  “I told you.”
A smile slowly grew on Harry’s face.  He was supposed to be copying down the procedure for their potion. But he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the boy across the table from him.  The way the fringe fell over his eyes, the straight line of his nose, the curve of his lips.  Harry felt the stirrings of desire the longer he stared.
Theo was on his bed looking at
“I mean, all the couples that got together, broke up afterward.  It was the game the whole time.  It was like a matchmaker.  But it only worked while the game was still going on.”
Harry smiled. “Simon got stopped more than I did. But no, he probably didn’t get jealous because he was too much of an arrogant prick.”
“Yes.  That and many other things, you’ll soon find out.”
A few days later, Hermione showed up in the castle, parchments in hand.
Hermione’s brow drew together. “Is there something else?”
He lifted his head slightly.  “I said I don’t want to get up.”  He lay still for only a moment longer. “Fuck.”  He sat up and looked at Hermione, bleary eyed.
“It’s only until I figure out how to come out.  I can’t just make an announcement at supper,” Harry snickered.
. Not yet.  I don’t think you’re ready for that,” the Slytherin reassured.
“I was just leaving,” Hermione told him.  She got up and sat down with Ron, who was talking to Harry.  She looked between them as they spoke and wondered about what Ginny said.  Could the boys remain best friends now that Harry was coming to terms with his sexual orientation?
“And that’s all you have to say about it?” Harry knew better than to think the subject was closed.
“I was enjoying watching you too much.”
Ron laughed. “I was thinking it would nice just to hang out and have some fun.”
Trying his hardest not to laugh at Harry’s naïveté, Draco smiled.  “The term is bottom.  And I would
“It will only open when the both are in love?” Harry asked.
Stretching and yawning, Harry woke gently from a pleasant dream. The morning sun was streaming through the window and Harry felt refreshed and well rested.  Though he had been hoping the night before would end with some sort of physical gratification, Harry was surprised that he found falling asleep in Draco’s arms nearly as fulfilling.
“But she cries in that big room with other babies,” Margherita frowned.
Looking away, Draco tried to think of an excuse.
“Mother couldn’t really remember much.  It seemed pointless to bring it to the Aurors.”
Draco sighed.  “It’s not a choice.  I can’t help it.  I’ve been fighting it for a while now.  But at that ridiculous party, he was so charming and personable and funny and
“The fame, the notoriety.”
Harry pulled back and smiled at her.  “You’re right, Gin.  You always were so smart.”  He stood upright.  “Dean, good luck.”
“See you all in Hogsmeade,” Pansy called, and headed for the bath.
They stayed a few more hours, going on rides and catching a Spiderman show.  Harry even won a very large stuffed animal for Draco at one of the carnival games.  But he swore he didn’t use magic.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest and waited for Harry to beg forgiveness so they could make up.  He’d be happy to forgive Harry, if he promised to stay away from Knox for good.  Though he put up a good front, Draco was terrified that Harry was going to tell him that he was leaving him for Knox.  They stared at one another so long, Draco nearly gave in and apologized to Harry for being petty and jealous over such a small incident, when Harry sighed heavily and shook his head.
Justin began to get nervous as the midnight hour approached.  He and his mystery girl had been getting on so well, he wished he could always wear a mask.
“Not yet,” Draco smirked. His gaze traveled down and he saw that Harry had enjoyed his ministrations very much indeed. He slid up high on Harry’s torso and rubbed his arse against Harry’s rock hard cock.
“So, maybe next time I suggest doing something that you think you won’t like, you won’t give me such a hard time?”
“And you didn’t want to tell me because . . .”
“And that was worth risking spending the rest of your life playing cards with this lot?” Draco asked.
Harper laughed.  “No, it’s like taking care of hair and skin for clients who come into the shop.”
Ready to defend Harry, Draco could feel the anger rising.  He had to remind himself not to say anything foolish.  “Potter is adequate at potion making.”  He grinned, “And my brilliance more than makes up for it.  But good luck anyway.”
Harry gladly took his daughter.  Walking over to Harry, Hermione held the boy near his sister.
“I have fire whiskey, Sherry, and a bottle of wine.”  He picked up the bottle and looked at it.  “Actually, it’s champagne.”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “Somehow I doubt that,” he said to himself.
Harry let out a whimper, then a loud grunt as he came, still pushing his hips steadily into Draco’s arse. The Potions professor soon followed, spilling himself onto the headboard in front of him, as well as Harry’s hand.  His legs gave out a moment later and he collapsed back into Harry.
They ordered food from the house elves to eat in Harry’s quarters. Minke was more than happy to serve them and brought enough at lunch time to sustain throughout the day.  Neither man saw any point in leaving Harry’s bedroom.
Harry’ gaze traveled to the wrapped box.  “I didn’t get you a gift.  That’s a gift, isn’t it?” he grinned.
“I want you to believe me when I say I love you, and that I trust you completely.”
“I just need a little time to adjust,” Harry told him.  He watched Draco’s profile silhouetted against the moonlight sky.
Draco collapsed in a heap on top of Harry, barely able to catch his breath.  Having a bit of trouble himself, the brunet waited a moment before speaking.
“Years,” Draco said quietly.
“Does my mother know?”
“Let it go, love,” Ron warned. “Let Harry figure his own life out.”
“No, you don’t.  Draco, your father is going to be in Azkaban a long time.  And I want you to live here, if you wish.”
“I trust
“Nothing is why you’re grinning like an idiot?”
Harry’s heartbeat skipped, understanding exactly what Draco was getting at.
Harry and Draco kissed to commemorate their first New Year’s Eve together.  Other couples did so as well.  Theo, not being part of an official couple swept Pansy up and dipped her before planting a memorable kiss on her lips.  She was grateful not to be left out as she observed the other happy couples.  Theo then made his way to any other girls that didn’t have a partner and repeated the gesture.  Susan Bones didn’t particularly enjoy it, but she appreciated the thought.
“I see,” McGonagall said.  She looked back and forth between them.  The expression on her face was largely unreadable to Harry.
“Maybe you’re right,” Harry nodded.
Smiling, Harry caressed Draco’s cheek. “You are brilliant.  I’m sorry.  I promise not to keep things from you anymore.”
And it was settled.  At least it appeared that way.  Ginny couldn’t help but be a little hurt that Harry wanted to go.  It was a thinly veiled excuse to shag someone otherwise unattainable.  Or perhaps a push in the right direction for the painfully shy.  Ginny wasn’t ashamed to admit to herself that she was going to relieve her own sexual frustration.  Of course, she told her brother, it was merely curiosity -- she’d never been inside Slytherin House.
“I don’t-- oh, no,” Harry saw a student looking over a copy of the Prophet.
“Oh, thank you Draco,” Hermione said, appreciative of the refreshment.
“I must say, though, that I don’t think I deserved it from you.”
Harry nodded.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Harry questioned, to be certain.
“Now that’s not true,” Draco assured him. He chuckled a little. “Maybe after your real life adventures, the agents are all jaded. They’re looking for something bigger than life.  You’re a tough act to follow.”
Draco shrugged and handed it over.
Draco continued to carry on polite conversation with Professor Flitwick for the remainder of supper.  Once in a while he peeked over at Harry, finding him gawking a bit.
“Hello Clara.  Lovely to see you.”
“Ron has a long jacket you could wear.”
Blaise looked up sharply.
“I’m not
“Sounds like trading one Death Eater for another is all it is.”  Knox picked up his pumpkin juice and took a sip.
“Sorry Malfoy, I wasn’t paying attention.”
She continued to look at him, still annoyed that she got partnered with him.  He was trying to wait for her to begin reading again, but she kept glaring at him.  Finch-Fletchley didn’t know how much more he was supposed to take.
Harry sat down as she handed him her copy.  Draco stood and read his.
“Oh, Draco please,” Harry panted.
“Writing in your journal again, I see,” Draco commented.  “Everything all right?”
They kissed until they heard the clicking sounds of a camera.
Bang.
So why the hell was he all of a sudden tongue-tied and anxious?
“Well, watch your back anyway, Harry,” Ron warned.
The blond smiled.  “What have you been doing in here?  You look flushed.”  He wiggled his eyebrows.
“Thank you Clara.  Where is Mother?”
is too chicken to shack up with you for the night.”
“What?”
“The letters were unsigned.  But we have a few leads and suspects we’d like to go after.  Did your father give you any idea who he was planning to name as a Death Eater?”
“Look at the two of you.  Harry, you’re a natural.”
“Harry, what?”
“Ah, I’m gonna cum even with this thing on,” Draco hissed.  He bit down on Harry’s shoulder as he came, as intensely as he ever had, continuing to thrust inside Harry’s arse.  When Draco was finally spent, he lay on top of Harry.  Harry’s knees gave out and the pair of them collapsed onto the satin covered bed.
He tried reading for a while, but his mind kept wandering.  Mostly toward the soiree in Slytherin.
“What makes him qualified to teach?”
Harry sighed heavily. “All right then.  I can go out to the common room.”  He picked up his book and parchment and walked out of the room.  He passed Hermione on her way to the boys’ room.  She blushed as Harry told her to have fun.
Lucius stroked his chin.  If something happened to Potter, his son would still have been able to get out through the wards.  but if the Manor was protecting itself, Draco wouldn’t know the counterspells to the new wards.  He didn’t care if Potter perished in there with Greyback.  However, if Draco had gone in and wasn’t able to get out, something must have gone wrong.
“Not at the moment,” he breathed, unclasping her bra and slipping his hands under the lacy cups.  He paused. “Aw, you’re not going to lecture me, are you?”
“You’re very handsome,” Harry said, slurring the word handsome.  He dropped his head on the table abruptly, momentarily passing out, his glasses bouncing off his face.
Draco sighed. “Well, I guess I don’t for sure, but the Healer said it was because of the dark magic.  And that’s gone now, so . . .”
“Tracey?”
“It was you.  You told Rita Skeeter that pack of lies.”
“The fourteenth? Oh, damn,” muttered Draco.  “I hadn’t even made the connection.”
Harry frowned.  He was certain that Draco was in the dungeons.  His first thought was that the connection was waning.
Harry stroked his chin.  “The garden was beautiful.  But the glass house is not very big.”
Frowning, Harry sat and pouted a moment before finally asking Ron, “So, what made you think I fancied blokes?”
“She called me a little pouf and stormed off.  At first, I was angry that she called me that.  Basically, I hid in a corner for the rest of the reception.  But near the end, an older boy came over to me and asked if what the girl said was true.  I didn’t know what to say.”
Hermione’s demeanor softened.  “Yes. I’m very proud of you.  Of course, the one time you concentrate on class work, is the one time I wish you had been observing Harry’s odd behavior.  I think it has something to do with Draco.”
Draco remained quiet.  As long as Harry finally saw Knox for who he truly was, he didn’t need to rub it in.
“I don’t suppose you’d think it was funny if I said something like that about Knox.”
“My mother hadn’t written down all the rules or the spells necessary, but she alluded to a book somewhere in the Slytherin common room that details it all.  We just have to find it.”
“He said he was in love with me.”
She took his hand in hers.  “Draco darling, all I’ve ever wanted is your happiness.  If this makes you happy, then I accept it.  If Harry loves you that much, you hold onto him.  Hold on with everything you have and don’t let go.” She smiled, but it did not reach her eyes.  “But Draco, make sure you love him back equally. There is little worse than loving with all your heart and getting nothing in return,” she warned.
At once Ron felt as if he were watching the situation in slow motion.  The figure leveled his wand at Ron and repeated his question.  Ron paled as he realized he did not have his wand on him.  There was something familiar to him, though, and he glanced at the window behind him.  Another man appeared near Hermione, and she drew her wand to defend herself.
“You like that, do you?”
The server brought drinks and a pot of tea for the table, as requested by Hermione.
Pansy looked him in the eye. “You’re the only one that ever made me feel, you know.”  She couldn’t bring herself to say the word.
“No.  Actually, I was still pissed off at him for the hex.  But I respected him.  Something I hadn’t done before that.  That was why I didn’t identify him when he was brought to the manor.”
“Right.  Well, Dorian needed a mentor.  So Shacklebolt assigned me.  Next thing I knew, she had me pinned up against the bookcase, and she was hikin’ up her skirt.”
It was a story about a baby dragon who got separated from his mother and set off to find her.  The words were simple, but the illustrations were remarkable.  The dragon’s wings sparkled and were raised from the surface of the page. Draco gently ghosted his fingers over the image on the cover. Dominique mimicked him with her chubby fingers.  He’d almost forgotten that the toddler was sitting next to him.
“I was only wondering how that Fifth Year fellow was doing.  You know, the one I told you was failing Potions?”
“You’re not like I thought you were either.”
“It would have been odd to stay at the Burrow,” she added.
“But Knox said . . . “
“Harry?” Ron called as he opened to door to their room carrying a tray with two plates of food.
Pouring a bit more lube, just to be safe, Harry grabbed onto himself and guided his cock back into his lover.  Though the position was a familiar one, the feeling of Draco’s exceptionally tight arse made the experience uniquely intense.  As Harry pumped in and out, his hands roamed Draco’s perfectly toned body.  His thumb raked a pert nipple, causing the blond to gasp.
“And you look as lovely as ever,” Harry returned, giving her a hug.  He turned to Lucius with his hand outstretched.  “Lucius.”
“This whole thing has been a bust.  I got stuck with Finch-Fletchley twice, and you.  No offense.”
“That’s not the point.  You’re not thinking of going to their party, are you?”

“Professor Potter,” Draco greeted them.  “Gryffindors.” He nodded to the students.
Harry scratched his head.  “I don’t know.  It seems like a couples sort of thing.”
“Oi, what’s going on?” Harper asked as he walked in on the scene.  “Is that my jacket?”
“For this, I will.  Besides, I no longer feel the need to stick it to my father by rejecting my inheritance.”
“But Professor, did you hear what he said about Harry?”
Harry’s head snapped up.  He couldn’t believe she had said that.
Draco asked, “So, what sort of costume are you wearing to the Halloween dance?”
“Oh, damn,” Harry said suddenly.  “I forgot the wine.  I bought wine for our dinner.  I’ll just go and fetch it quickly.”
He swallowed, knowing she was lying.  “Yeah, everything’s great.  Congratulations again.”  He kissed her cheek, then flooed to Hogwarts with Draco.
The others clinked glasses with him and one another and drank.  The food and drink began to disappear suddenly.
“What does?”
Draco laughed. It was probably the first time Harry heard him laugh without it being at Harry’s expense.  “Yes.  She’s plenty safe.  You know the homosexuals Pansy was talking about?  He’s one of them.”
“Amazingly,” Luna replied, still panting.
“The boots,” Draco motioned to them.  “As convenient as it may be for you to be taller, I enjoy looming over you.”
Ginny had played well but was hit by the bludger an hour into the game.  Though she didn’t seem seriously injured, she had been taken to hospital to be on the safe side.
“This is worse than when I was young,” Harry said in Draco’s ear. “I’ve always hated getting my picture taken.”
“It’s easy.  Just swipe the blade over the skin until it peels off.”
Harry reluctantly stopped. “To talk to Ginny.”
Draco’s shoulders slumped. “I . . . I told you to,” he wasn’t sure if he could say it to her face.

“Come on.  We’re dancing.”
time.”
“They’re both fine,” the Healer assured her.  “The boy’s a bit on the small side.  But that’s to be expected for one so early.”
They sat in the Astronomy Tower with the stars above them on the unusually clear night. Ron had cast a warming spell around them as it had become quite chilly.
“Um, I guess I’ll wait out here,” Draco stammered.
“Yes, but the Manor?”  Harry sighed.  “How can I expect my friends to come?”
He jerked his head in the direction of the small group of students still on the dance floor.
He fell asleep with visions of emerald eyes in his head.  And he didn’t even care that he was once again relegated to the uncomfortable sofa.
“Yes, she will.  I’ve drawn up a contract with the editor.  It will be all right.”
“Oh, I didn’t lie about that.  I mean, I’m not a master yet. But I’ve been apprenticing with an apothecary for two years.”
In a fever, Draco guided himself in, and once there reached around for Harry’s cock.
Draco stood and began to pace the room.  He did love Harry.  It wasn’t the game.  He wanted him before they had been paired together.  But Harry hadn’t even discovered his true sexual nature until the game began.  Draco shook his head.  No, Harry broke up with Ginny before that.  That had nothing to do with the game.  Did it?
“Tea, Poppy,” Narcissa said sternly, but smiled.  Poppy disappeared with a small pop.  “I let Tinker go.  Your father acquired him. I never did trust the little sneak.  Poppy is sweet and loyal.”
Ron kissed his sister on the cheek, and he and Harry left.
“Seriously,” Draco said. “Any time you want.  I thought I was doing you a favor because I never liked to bottom particularly.  But that was so different from any other time.”
“Everything all right dear?”  Sibyll Trelawny asked, her eyes appearing to bug out behind her thick glasses.  She placed a sympathetic hand on top of Harry’s.  “Trouble with love?”
“Maybe I should take a shower first,” Draco said, patting his hair down.
Draco silently glanced anywhere in the room to avoid eye contact, his mouth opened to speak, but no words came out.
“You’ve overslept boys,” Pansy chuckled.  “I guess you were just so comfy, you didn’t want to get up.”
“Still concentrating on me, aren’t you?” Draco turned his head to look at Harry.  He wiggled his hips, so his bollocks swung like a pendulum.
Harry reddened slightly.  “Oh, uh, yeah.  But what I meant was, um, passion about life.  You know, something that keeps you excited, energized.”
“No, not at all.  I feared that it was you who didn’t really care for me.”
“Well, Harry, shall we begin?” she asked.
Harry took the opportunity while Ron was not looking at him to make his confession.  Taking a deep breath, he finally burst out with it.
“A petite goat cheese puff with apricot glaze.”
“No.  Just stay out of my way.”
“No.  I wouldn’t,” Draco admitted.  He hugged Harry to him.  “I’ll do anything I can to help you.  But I think I’ll be more of a hindrance.”
“The Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes sounds fun.  Or if I really don’t want to work hard, maybe the Department of Magical Games and Sports,” Draco snickered, holding his hand out for the firewhiskey. He lowered himself to the ground and crossed his legs.

“What?  You want to invite other Houses?  Are you mental?” Blaise suggested.  “We can’t have outsiders in our House.  It simply isn’t done.  Besides, you think any of those do-gooders from Gryffindork would possibly be interested?” he laughed.
Harry took hold of Draco’s hand.  Before either of them could say more, students began to pouring out of the Great Hall.
“Yes. And I’m sure the pair of you don’t--” Draco gasped a little when a finger poked the fabric between his cheeks.  He cleared his throat and finished.  “You don’t want to be wasting your time talking to us.”
Harry was excited by the idea of spending the summer with Draco exploring the world.  He was envious that Ron and Hermione wouldn’t have to wait for their honeymoon. They were leaving for Italy that very night.  Hermione had been learning Italian and chose Rome so she could practice what she had learned. Ron didn’t care much either way.  He just wanted time away with her alone before they began their family.
Reading the diary had been one of the most profoundly intimate activities he’d ever engaged in that wasn’t actually sexual in nature.  And he shared it with Draco Malfoy of all people.  In the moment before Draco opened his big mouth, Harry felt a deep connection to the Slytherin.
“Rita Skeeter here, speaking with the elusive Harry Potter in his first interview since Nineteen ninety-nine. So, tell me Harry, why now?  Why are you finally breaking your silence to give me this exclusive interview?”
Ron stood staring, just realizing that perhaps Harry had wanted to keep his relationship a secret.
Ron and Hermione giggled most of the way, when they weren’t stealing kisses. Every so often, Draco glanced back at Harry, who was always gazing up at him. He walked them up the stairs, down a dim hallway, then up a second set of stairs and down another dim hallway.
“You’ll love it,” Harry said.  “It’s like flying.  But faster.”
Draco reached out playfully and pulled Harry close by the waist. “You speak the language of love,” he said seductively.
They were dancing, more or less ball room style, but quickly, to keep up with the beat of the music.  Parvati was spun and twirled and dipped.  Her partner seemed to be making it all up on the spot.  And perhaps he wasn’t the finest dancer, but she was having fun.  Padma and Romilda watched the pair as they drank pumpkin punch.
“Oh, those are lovely names,” Hermione said.  “May I please hold one of them?  It’s been so long since Rose was this little.”
“Yes,” she said, putting a forkful of mincemeat pie into her mouth.  “It’s been approved.  Though, I can’t say it’s the way I would have liked it.”
“Miss Weasley?” the Welcome Witch called and looked toward Ginny.  “Come with me.”
“But you said it felt like my magic was trying to take over yours–”
Draco dropped his head down to look between them at Harry.  “I can’t believe we haven’t done this position before.”
Harry stepped forward and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder, while peeking inside the room.  “Looks like your overnight bags are in here as well.”
The two quietly crept through the castle, keeping a sharp eye out for Filch, who loved to catch students where they weren’t supposed to be.  Fortunately, Mrs. Norris often gave him away.  And Harry hadn’t been caught by Filch in a long time.
“Speak for yourself,” Terry told Stephen.  “I don’t give a rat’s arse what happens to these two.”
“Now I’m really starving,” Harry laughed.  “Let’s go down to the kitchens and get something to eat.”
“Because I love you.  I think it’s the Manor in my dreams. And the birds, they’re white peacocks. We’re meant to live in the Manor, I just know it.”
“Good evening Harry.  I noticed you were absent from lunch and supper earlier.”
“Nah, I think Quigley is just warming up.  Actually, I think he’s quite hot,” Draco laughed.
As Harry readied himself for his and Draco’s Sunday reading-- sometimes shagging-- ritual, he glanced at the bound book of parchment.  He’d been writing only sporadically since he and Draco began dating, but the newest story was nearly complete.  He was ready for Draco to read and critique it.  The story had been particularly fun to write, especially the sexy parts.  Though Harry himself was twenty by the time he had sex for the first time, Liam, his character was fairly active at sixteen.
“Slower, even,” Draco warned.  “Now take your wand and wave it over the cauldron clockwise.  Gently, now.  You don’t want it to splash about.”
“Aren’t you going to open it?” Harry asked.
Harry was quiet, prompting Draco to fill the silence.
“I’m the one who offered to babysit. I didn’t expect you to do it,” Harry said. “She’s still fussy.  Maybe she’s hungry again.  I’ll get a bottle.”
“Peacocks?
Parvati turned and looked around. “Who? Susan?”
“Well, the amusement park for one, but probably not until he’s a bit older.  There’s always the zoo, and parks, and Quidditch matches.  Picnicking in the countryside, skiing in the Alps, and maybe we’ll even get to the Grand Canyon in America someday.”
For two days, Draco had been waiting to talk to Harry.  They were the longest two days of his life. The Gryffindor seemed to be nowhere.  He was never in his room, never in the Great Hall for meals.  At least, not that Draco could see when he peeked inside. If he was in the castle at all, he was doing an excellent job of evading Draco at every turn.  At Sunday’s supper, he finally got up the nerve to sit down with the rest of the professors, especially McGonagall, whom he had been avoiding.
“But you left me, not the other way around like you predicted.”
Draco glanced at his father, who appeared mortified by the topic of conversation, as did Ron.
“We’re trying to figure out which one is our baby,” Harry told her.
“Can all Aurors do that? Hide more than one person that well?”
Suddenly he remembered Draco.  Whirling around, Harry found him at the bottom of what was left of the staircase, looking like a rag doll tossed aside by a child. His limbs were at odd angles and his head was turned away from Harry.  There was blood on the floor, but not much, Harry thought thankfully.
“Oh, yes!  Dean, I’m cumming.  Aah.”  Romilda whimpered and panted, just seconds before Dean made a bit of noise of his own.
“I never said I was coming out.”
“What are you doing here?” Ginny asked, clearly surprised.
“All right then. Where should we begin?” Lucius asked.
He snatched them from her, and they finished dressing.
“I suppose part of it was human nature, an instinctual need to carry on.”
Harry swallowed.  “All right,” he said quietly.
It was Harry’s turn to drop his jaw.  His neck was covered in hickeys.  Instinctively, his hand covered his neck. “Shit,” he swore. “I’m going to kill him.”
“And then I said, anyone who would be in my bedroom would already know that.” Draco laughed.  “Or something along those lines.”
“Tutoring?  Knox saw you embracing.”
“Yeah, I know what you mean,” Harry empathized.
“I see your point,” Harry said.  “Draco and I will be more discreet from now on.  But Minerva, has there ever been a couple teaching together at Hogwarts before?”
Blushing with a small smile on his face, Neville confessed, “Luna.  She’s beautiful.”
“I’m so pleased at the way you young professors have come together.”
“Uh, oh, I was just . . .” Harry stammered for an excuse to be there.
Feeling dejected, Draco went back to his own quarters.  Breakfast was still being served, but he wasn’t hungry.  And he didn’t want to face any of the other professors in case they’d heard about Knox and Harry’s encounter in the library.  He especially didn’t want to see Madame Pince.  He vaguely recalled telling her to fuck off.
“I’m so sorry.  I had no idea that spell left permanent marks,” he apologized. “You must have really hated me after that.”
“We may as well stay here again.  I’ve been kicked out of my room,” Draco said.
“If you think you’re up for it.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever wanted you more,” Harry breathed.
“So, I appreciate you not making a fuss over Draco sitting with your daughter.  He really is a changed man.”
Relieved that she offered, Harry answered, “We’re not sure where to start. Obviously we can’t just shag and-–” he blushed.
“You don’t like me as a strawberry blond?” Harry asked coyly.
“The baby is due June fifteenth.”
“It’s not,” Ginny said.  “Ours was so quick, we didn’t get to have all the lovely extras.  And it was so small.  Take the time to plan it right.  It should be the happiest day of your lives.”
“That could take hours.”
He hovered over Draco and leisurely swept his tongue across his lips.  Harry felt happier than he ever had.  Possibly in his entire life.  He was going to spend the night in his lover’s arms and wake up to a whole new world.
Harry sighed and plopped down on the sofa.  He glanced at the clock again.  Fourteen minutes after eight o’clock.  He sighed again.  He hated being late, even if it was only to chaperone a dance.
“Oh.  I wasn’t actually expecting an answer.” Draco paused.  “You would?” he asked quietly.
Harry made his way back to the castle as quickly as possible, looking in all their usual spots when he returned.  Draco was not in the Potions room, or the Astronomy Tower.  Nor was he in either of their Houses.  Zabini said he hadn’t seen him, but sometimes when Draco got depressed, he went to The Three Broomsticks to drink.  Harry thought that would be his last resort, if Draco couldn’t be found in the castle.  He just had a feeling he was there somewhere.
“Stuck in a pai-- how the bloody hell did he do that?”
When the server brought the bill, Draco quickly snatched it up. Hermione opened her mouth to protest, but Draco put up his hand.
“It’s Mel.” She held out her hand to shake.
Turning to Harry, Draco gave a smile.  “It’s not out of the blue.  My mother has been owling me.  I told you she wants me come back to live in the Manor when–” He cut himself short, realizing it was still a difficult subject for the pair of them.  “Anyway, I’ll be back tonight.”
“Oh,” Hermione sat up straighter.  “Are you saying you really did have feelings for Harry back during the war?”
“You’re on,” Harry said and offered his hand.
“I don’t have cooties, Potter.  We’ve both already had our mouths on it, anyway.”
“It was my own fault for deluding myself into thinking it would make you come back to me.”
Harry stirred at the sound of Draco’s voice.  The arm behind his head came down and wrapped around his lover, squeezing him in a yawn and stretch.
“Really?” Draco queried. “I had no idea books were so lucrative. You’d think the owner of Obscurus Books would dress a little better.”
“Didn’t you hear me calling or knocking?”
Harry just stared.
Harry tugged at the kilt he was wearing as part of his traditional Highland dress, complete with brogues and hose.
“You look thin,” she said.
Harry stood silent, deciding whether or not to tell her, even though he knew she’d figured it out already.
“It’ll be nice when we can finally just spend the night together like Blaise and Harper,” Draco commented.  “Not that I’m trying to pressure you.  But have you given any more thought as to how you’re going to come out?  Or when?”
“This is the place he suggested I come for a gift for Hermione.  Told me a story about some quill he bought his mum.  Maybe I’ll get Mione a new quill and journal.”
“Haven’t you had enough of chasing the bad guys?” Draco questioned.
“Well, for starters, he wants out of prison now.  Which, really isn’t a problem, if it ended there.”
big,” he tried to joke.
“No, sir.” Casper paused.  “I hope not, anyway,” he said sheepishly.
“Wait,” Harry finally said.  He took Draco’s left arm and draped it over his shoulder.  Then, he put his own left arm around Draco’s shoulder, leaving their right hands on one another’s waist.
“What?” Harry leaned closer.
“Draco?  Are you all right?”
“Blaise?” Ginny raised her eyebrows.  “Since when do you call him Blaise?”
“Agreed.”
“Fuck, yeah.”
Knox swallowed.  “A statement about what?  What is this about?”
“All right, I will.”  Romlida scanned the room for a lone party goer to approach.  She spotted two definitely male figures standing on the far side of the room.  She grabbed Padma’s arm.
man I’ve been with.  He’s the only man, or person, I’ve ever been in love with.  The only person I ever will be.  I won’t hurt him, I promise.”
A pink knitted cap covered the baby’s head.  He couldn’t have stopped the grin that spread across his face if his life had depended on it.  He hadn’t realized how much he was hoping for another daughter until that moment.  All the time, he had been justifying his wishes as something for Lily.
“No, no.  Worse.  I keep having a dream where Draco is talking to Blaise about me.  He tells him he’s trying to get me to fall in love with him so he can humiliate me.  So he can get me back for all the things I’ve done to him over the years.”
Standing and gaping, Harry was slow to respond.
“She’s embarrassed by the press obviously.  She went to have Christmas in the country with a distant cousin and sent me back here.”
“Ung.  Fuck.  Oh.”  Harry’s pants and Daphne’s hand were suddenly covered in jizz.
“To find out if we accidentally bound our magic, of course.  Were you not listening to the conversation last night at supper? And about my Mark.”
“I can’t believe I made you feel that way.” Harry closed his eyes.  “I was so angry about what happened, mainly with myself.  I tried to lay the blame on Knox, but it was really all my fault.”
“I’ll go,” Hermione volunteered.
Mel smiled and removed the colorful scarf she wore around her neck.  “Of course, I did my best to keep up the illusion, so I can’t fault the unobservant.”
“I never thought of that,” Ron said.
Draco stepped into the room, closing the door behind him, and forcing Harry to back up.  Reaching out, Draco grabbed at the scarf around Harry’s neck and pulled.
Knox grinned to himself as the Headmistress left the Great Hall.  He didn’t have any more classes that afternoon, and he knew just how he wanted to spend it.
Another blast, from behind Harry, sailed over his head.  He looked for the source and saw the overly hairy form of Fenrir Greyback turning a corner.
“Goodbye, Hagrid.  We’ll stop and see you first chance we get,” Harry waved.
“You don’t know about the passage to Hogsmeade?  I suppose it is somewhat secret.  But the Gryffindors know about it,” he replied.
For a while, they leisurely rocked together, kissing and touching.  A few times, Harry made a move toward his own cock, laughing lightly when Draco grabbed his hand away and held it above Harry’s head.
“Now how would Slughorn know them?” Ron asked Seamus.
“I wasn’t actually going to hit him.”
“That certainly didn’t stop them from trying,” Draco pointed out.
“I do too, but my bollocks are turning blue,” Harry joked.
Fists clenching, Draco tried to remain calm.  There wasn’t any reason to believe his father would really send someone to off Harry at the Burrow.  Then again, Lucius had been humiliated by Rita Skeeter’s article.  Narcissa had been able to smooth things over among her crowd, claiming it was merely a phase many young wizards went through.  But Lucius had taken a great deal of condemnation for allowing his only son to be seduced by the Chosen One.  To hear Skeeter tell it, Harry used his influence and position among wizards to take advantage of the young Death Eater.  Pure blood families all over were ridiculing Malfoy and the apparent end of his line.
He decided instead, to go back to his own chambers.  He had to pull himself together.  Clearly, he couldn’t spend all of his free time pining after Draco, who obviously had his own schedule to keep.
“So, I’ll go first,” Draco reiterated. He glanced around the room, deciding who to question first. “Ginny.”
Draco looked disappointed.
“Twice.”  Neville seemed to be in a daydream.  “I’ve never shagged anyone before.”  He looked at Ron, then Harry.  “I guess I didn’t need to advertise that.”
“Almost fifteen.  Before all the shit went down here. My room was the last one redecorated . . .”
“Oh, did I say Morgana?  I meant to say Laverne de Montmorency,” she responded coyly.
Even Ron had to laugh at the memory of Hermione punching Malfoy square in the face.
“That’s how you get the love in there,” George said.  “Mum puts it in everything she does,” he told Draco.
“It will.  I promise. I want it too.”
“Oh.  Sorry.  Wrong car,” he said and swiftly retreated.
Both Ron and Hermione stopped where they were and regarded one another.  She knew by the guilty look on his face that Lavender took full advantage of her rights according to the game.  Lavender smirked at Hermione and squeezed Ron’s hand more tightly.
Smirking, Harry followed him out.
“I, uh, wrote a bit in the journal you gave me.”
“No.  I have no intention of dropping my other friends for him.  I don’t expect him to either,” Harry assured Ron.
“You expect me to get on that?  Is it safe?”
Ron laughed. “That’s what happens when you never go on holiday. See you later.” He and Hermione began to walk toward the door.
“We’ll see how long they continue to accommodate me,” Draco smirked.
Harry rolled his eyes.  He’d never heard that, but it seemed ridiculous to Harry.  But then he had another thought.
“What do you want me to say, Draco?  That I was a terrible father? That I wasn’t a strong enough man?  That I made dangerous choices for our family? I admit that to you. There are too many reasons to go into for why I made those choices. At the time, I thought they were the right choices.”
Sinking slowly back into her chair, Draco’s mother seemed utterly deflated.
“Next weekend?”  Harry thought.  “Next weekend is Halloween.”
Ginny looked down at her belly and rubbed it.  “You don’t think . . .”
The word
“Is that it?” Blaise asked.  “I want to shower before Harper comes up.”
“I didn’t really have toys myself,” Harry said.  “Once in a while, when Dudley was very bored, he would play a game with me.  Of course, I always had to let him win or he would toss the board and make me clean it up.”
He left Harry with his mouth hanging open, in the middle of the library.  A few moments of blinking blankly, then Harry found himself quickly scribbling the rest of the potion formula.  He smirked when he glanced at the clock.  Less than eight minutes.  He wondered how far Draco had gotten without him.  The thought sent a shiver through his spine, imagining his partner stripping and stroking himself in preparation.
With the aid of magic, Draco’s belongings were packed and shrunk.  All that remained were some things that belonged to Harry.  Draco sat and leafed through the book of parchment that he had put back together for Harry.  In the story, the two boys shared intimate moments and talked about their future together.  It was too painful for Draco to think about plans that he and Harry had made.  Plans that would never happen.
A quick kiss, and Harry took off down the corridor in the opposite direction from Draco.  Draco stood watching long after he could no longer see Harry’s form in the darkness. For a moment, he thought he imagined the entire evening.  There was no way the Boy Who Lived could really want him.
Draco suppressed a snort.  He could, in fact, not imagine wanting to be a Weasley.
“Definitely not.  Why do you ask?”
Draco’s lip curled slowly into a smile.  “Dance with me.”
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, addressing the guests.  “Please direct your attention to our newlyweds, Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Weasley, and, uh . . .”
“I’m getting close,” Harry said. “Are you?”
Harry couldn’t help giggling.  “Good afternoon Horace.  What brings you to Hogsmeade today?”
“I know I’ve sent you into emotional chaos since . . . well, probably since this term began,” Harry laughed. “But I don’t ever want to make you cry again.”
“Ladies and gentlemen, please join Narcissa and myself in the ballroom for refreshments before the reception,” his voice bellowed over the crowd.
“Why not?  I’ll have your king in check.”
“Harry?  Can I ask you something?”
Laughing, Harry tried to calm the redhead down.  “Ron, wait.  Draco isn’t doing anything but playing a prank on you.”
The two men stared at one another.  Harry grew less confident in his decision.
“But nothing.  They are your friends.”
Somehow, it wasn’t insulting coming from Harry.
“Marking your territory, Potter?”
“I want to shower with you. Now.” The vision of Draco dripping wet from the day before was still fresh in Harry’s mind.
“I thought I would get somebody less . . . Hufflepuff,” she retorted.
“Oh, Mr. Malfoy.  I didn’t know you were coming today.  Hi Harry,” the man smiled.
about rimming your boyfriend, how are you going to do it?  Are you certain you’re bent at all?”
Draco moaned in protest and opened his eyes.
“I, uh, came to tell you---”
The way she paused made Draco think that it wasn’t quite the accident it appeared to be.
“Of course, Susan. You were there.  You saw that I got paired with her.  Did you know she’s actually a lesbian?”
“Harry, Draco, so glad to see you,” Ron greeted them at their front door, practically hugging them both.  “Come on in.”
“Are you . . . are you going to let me touch you?” Draco breathed shakily.  The anticipation was tightening his belly and he was becoming aroused just thinking about doing wicked things to Harry.
They sat in silence. Draco knew he was being unreasonable, asking Harry to stay away from Knox completely.
“So, Ron tells me that the two of you are marrying this month. The thirtieth?”
Harry cast his eyes downward.  She was right.  He shouldn’t have lied about working with Draco.
She was right, statistically speaking.  Harry hadn’t thought of that.  He wondered if it wasn’t the game after all.  Perhaps Pansy had been wrong about that.
Harry shrugged.  “I don’t know what we’re doing.  We didn’t make plans.  But I don’t want him to go shopping with me. I need to shop
Something in Harry snapped at seeing this.  He stepped forward and pulled presumed Pansy away from Draco. She staggered back a step or two on her stilettos.  Even through her mask, Harry could see a look of shock on her face.
“What are you thinking about?” Harry asked quietly.
Hands found their way into the thick mass of dark hair following its movements back and forth.  Draco began to thrust his hips in counter rhythm to Harry’s.  He lasted longer than Harry, but not much, giving him a warning. Harry responded by sucking harder and speeding up his actions.
“Like an Unbreakable Vow?”
Narcissa took one. “Thank you.”
Draco looked to Harry, eyes pleading to get him out of this conversation with Hermione.
“Really?” A slow smile crossed Glenda’s face.
Ron grinned and sat up a bit straighter.  “You mean you told me before Mione?”
He shrugged again.  “I don’t know any more.  I do know that I don’t want to try and do it on my own.  If Draco truly doesn’t want children, then I think it’s best that we don’t.”
Anthony couldn’t take it anymore.  He reached down and pulled on his cock roughly.
“Oh, Draco, I had no idea how affected you were.” Narcissa buried her face in her hands.  “I didn’t think you remembered.”
Padma linked her arm through her sister’s and the pair walked to the Great Hall to join their classmates for the first meal of the day. They parted ways and headed to their houses, where Parvati was showered with compliments and a much needed ego boost.
“What makes you say that?” Harry shifted his weight from foot to foot and glanced at the mantle clock.
“First of all, I want to assure you that his credentials are in order and those of us on the Board considered his candidacy very seriously before agreeing.  Almost unanimously.”
He stopped and watched as Harry and Knox walked in his direction, covered in dirt and dripping with sweat. And, oh, was Harry a sight. If Draco hadn’t been so angry about missing his practice time with Harry, he would have been moved to take him right there on the field.
“Would you like me to get you something to eat from the cafe, Molly?” Harry offered.
“Draco?  What am I supposed to be seeing?” Harry squinted.
“Of course not.  I, I didn’t expect you to simply carry on as if nothing has changed, though.”
“I thought you liked to look into my-- what did call them, stormy-- eyes,” Draco chuckled.
“Well, I still had one, you simply couldn’t detect it.”  Draco awkwardly wet his lips. “Forgive me Harry, but I’m having a hard time figuring out if my resurrection is a good thing or not.”
“Please, call me Harry.  I’m just Harry.”
Harry smiled sheepishly, “Maybe a little.”
Draco got up and walked straight to the mirror.
Draco glanced down at the hand, causing Harry to retract it, thinking the touch was not welcome.
“Yes, loads of times.  I’m
“I guess it wouldn’t make sense for us to stay together, as a couple.  You deserve someone who will make you happy.  We should break up so you can find him.”
“Don’t blame him, son.  You two must have had a very strong connection to begin with.  Your magic responded and completed the bond.  I think the pain was only the resistance of the residual dark magic.  It’s not his fault.”
“If you can’t tell, maybe I don’t want you to jerk me after all,” Justin muttered.
October 17 1998
Moments after the floo call ended, Draco stepped out of the loo, towel drying his hair.
“Well, what do you think, Ron?  Are you going to buy that for Mione?” Harry gestured to the bracelet in Ron’s hand.
“By leaving?”
December 11 1998
“Yeah, I play chess.  And you know I fly.  I’m on the Quidditch team.”
Harry furrowed his brow. “I don’t know.  He should have been here twenty minutes ago.”
Unable to help himself, Draco pumped away, pounding into Harry with each thrust.  He wanted to cum quickly.  He needed to cum quickly, he’d been so thoroughly turned on by Harry’s acquiescence.  Rita Skeeter may have made up those tales of his sexual escapades.  But damn, if she wasn’t onto something.
“She’s already seen,” Harry shrugged.  “And you won’t tell anybody, right Madame Pomfrey?” He looked up at her hopefully.
Harry gasped when he walked in.  Not only was it much larger than his former bedroom at Hogwarts, it was furnished better.  The countertops were black marble, to match the toilet and bidet. The glass shower appeared to have real gold fixtures. And the bath, also black marble, was large enough to accommodate a minimum of three people.  But what struck Harry the most was the artwork on the walls.  He stood and turned around in place.
Draco had also moved closer.
“We’re here to see Lucius Malfoy,” Harry said. “We have an appointment.”
“Draco, are you certain you’re up for this?”
“What if we didn’t leave it up to fate?” Harry quietly suggested.
“New puppy?” Harry asked.
Theo closed the magazine. “Fine,” he hissed.  “It’s not as if I want to watch you shag anyway.”
“Why did you and Harry break up?  Everyone thought you were perfect for each other.”
“And Mr. and Mrs. Granger.”
“So, you’re seriously thinking we should start having these parties?” Blaise questioned.
“Wait.” He stopped her.
“I know that, Harry.  But people hold grudges.  I’ve heard a rumor that Malfoy still gets hate mail.”
“I asked if he speaks French to you when you make love,” Fleur said. “And does it fill you with passion as it does my Bill?”
“So, he has turned you down?  Maybe the boy has more sense than I thought.”
“I have only one account at Gringotts,” Lucius said.  “My wife and son have separate accounts.”
“I saw him go inside,” Hermione said. “I can’t believe he went in there.” She frowned.
When he strolled into the waiting room one more time, scarcely any of them even lifted a head.
“You said we shouldn’t have any secrets between us. But . . . I’ve been . . . lying to you. Keeping something from you, to be more accurate.”
“I didn’t hear you complaining,” Harry said.
The four of them chatted and passed the baby when she got fussy. Even Draco took a brief turn. Though, it was almost worse for Harry to see him with an infant in his arms.
“I didn’t.  I came to give you back some of your things.”  Draco walked through the doorway and placed the items on Harry’s desk.  As he turned, he noticed that many of Harry’s things were boxed up.  “Are you packing?”
“Thank you, dear.  But I’d like to do that myself. With your father, of course.”
“Thank you, Harry. But Dean did have something to do with it.”
“I think I’ll be okay with it.  And I get to be fun uncle to all of your children.  Just so you know, I plan on spoiling them,” he smiled.
They fell into a comfortable silence and Pansy leaned her head on Draco’s shoulder.
“I’ll make an exception, if it will help your mother and put your mind at ease.”
Sitting up, Harry said, “I was thinking . . . maybe I could give Ron a call.  He doesn’t have to make it an official case.  At least, not until he finds something.”
It was getting very late, and as reluctant to leave as they were, it wouldn’t do for them to fall asleep nude in the Potions room to be discovered in the morning.  The pair dressed, extinguished the lanterns, and vanished the sofa before leaving for their own dormitories.
“I am not too trusting,” Harry protested.  “I didn’t trust Rita Skeeter.”
“Draco and I have decided not to have any children,” Harry told her.
Sitting down, Draco looked into Harry’s eyes.  There wasn’t anything he would deny Harry.
Draco grinned.  “It’s sort of fun, isn’t it?  Hiding your identity, wearing a mask?  Of course, as professors, we’ll need to be fairly easy to spot, in case a student needs us.”
Harry removed his mask and transfigured it back into his glasses.
“Will you try?  For me?”  Harry patted the seat next to him.
Draco’s eyes widened, and Arthur cleared his throat, to steer the conversation back on its course. “So, why Greece, Harry?”
Harry walked into his room alone, heart pounding from adrenaline.  He paced.
a father.  But I mean, the traditions and all.  Mum has even begun shopping around for a bride for me.  She’s trying to make the best deal, for me supposedly.”
“Have you ever heard of Sectum Sempra?” Draco asked, bringing Harry’s heart to a near stop.
“Yeah, that was lucky,” Ron said. “It was just like your dream Harry.”
Hermione asked one of the third years to go to the kitchens to get ice for Harry, while Draco and Ron helped him up the stairs to his room.  Ron looked away and shifted uncomfortably on his feet as Draco began to unbutton Harry’s jeans.
“Yeah, he’s dead under that pile blocking the front door,” Harry told him.  “How badly are you hurt?”
“Yes, I
“What, are you having an affair with Gilderoy Lockhart?” Draco smirked.
“I don’t know.  I heard Malfoy plays both sides of the field, if you know what I mean,” Parvati told them.
Putting a finger to her mouth, he noticed an almost desperate attempt on her part to get it.  He immediately sought out Hermione, who was sitting at the kitchen table peeling potatoes with Ginny.
Harry looked at his hand, then at his cock.  He had only pleasured Draco with two fingers up until that point.  That didn’t quite measure up to Harry’s erect appendage, either in length or girth.  He worried that the experience would be unpleasant for his lover.
“What don’t you want me to see?” Harry asked gently.
“Is that all?” Draco prodded.
“Us, of course.  Or at least me.  I may have to ease into us,” Harry admitted.  “I suppose it will depend on their reaction.”
“Yes, but that just means that
Harry was nearly in tears when he heard the roar of the fireplace. He turned to find, not Ron and Hermione, but Draco coming out.
Harry turned to walk away, pulling Draco with him. Draco gave Simon one last scowl before turning in the same direction as Harry.
“Not that much.  She’s not some feeble old woman. Narcissa’s not yet fifty.”
Another slow song began and students flocked to the punch bowl.  Harry moved out of the way to avoid them.  Draco walked up and took Harry’s cup from him, downing it in one gulp.  He flipped his fringe out of his face, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.  He liked the new style, he decided.  The spiky, long fringe and shorter layers in the back gave him an almost anime appearance.
“I need to get out of here,” Draco growled. “Now.”
“I think the word your looking for is intrusive,” Ron grumbled.
“You know what? Let’s just go.  You’re sucking the fun out of it anyway. And if you’re going to be miserable, I’d rather leave.”
hdhdhd
“Harry, I can’t breathe,” Draco choked out.
“Oh, Tracey, why did you do this?  Why would you let me do this?” Anthony wasn’t an overly sensitive bloke, but he’d only had one virgin before and it had been his first time as well.  It had been rather disastrous and unpleasant for the young lady.  He was more experienced now, but it was still a delicate situation.
Sighing heavily, Draco replied, “Exactly what you told me would happen.  He’s too good for me.  And now someone better has come along.”
“Even more Slytherin.” Draco pulled him close and kissed him on the lips.
“Draco told me.  His father sent a cryptic message telling Draco that his sentence may be shortened. I  . . .  asked Billings about it.”
Harry turned away from him.
“And you’re sure you want her back?”
Silently, Harry went to the door and closed it, giving Draco the opportunity to get out of bed and dressed without giving McGonagall the full monty.  He and Minerva stood awkwardly, waiting for Draco to emerge.
“The darling,” Molly cooed.
Lifting Harry’s leg a bit higher, Draco propped himself on his elbow to gain some thrusting leverage.
“She should be embarrassed.  Bedding two boys at the same time.”
“You’re hardly a failure, Harry. How many queries did you send out? Ten?  Twelve?”
“Sometimes, I can’t believe you weren’t sorted into Slytherin,” he commented.  “That was brilliant use of Auror training.”
Ron cut him off.  “Don’t say another word. She actually is
“I only wanted to ask-- beg, if I must, a favor.”
Ten o’clock.  Slytherin House.  Pansy and Theo stood in front of the wand cauldron looking at one another.
“For the whole weekend?  I don’t think so,” Draco chuckled.  “How about tea on Saturday?  An hour or two may be all we can take of Mother.”  Draco paused.  “Are you sure you want to do that?”
“Harry,” Draco smiled, trying to ease the crease that formed between Harry’s brow. “We’re young. Too young to think about children, in my opinion. Or to be tied down to a business.  Let’s enjoy our lives.  Who knows how we’ll feel in five years? We can’t worry about that now.  We’ve only been married for two months.”
Draco laughed.  “The three students who have been staying after for extra practice and studying.  I’ve taken to calling them my Tri-Miones.”
“Theo is an oaf.”
“I suppose that means supper is over,” Harry laughed.
“It’s done.  You may as well enjoy it.”
“Not yet,” Draco whispered.
“Why?’ Harry demanded.
“Yeah, she does that a lot.  Wait a second and she be all happy again,” he laughed.
“My manuscript,” Harry answered.  “I finally came up with a name.”
“What girl in Potions?” Hermione questioned.
Draco blinked.  “I thought I was already.”
“When is the wedding?” Trelawney asked.  “I could do a reading for you, to pick the best time.”
“It was unnecessary. I have been up against prejudice most of my adult life.”
“It’s not,” Ron grumbled.  “But I was gonna ask Mione to marry me and now I can’t.”
“How can it be the future if it’s me and Ron?”
Harry smiled at the prospect.  “That’d be brilliant.”  Then he remembered that he already had plans.  His smile dropped.  “I can’t.  I forgot I have a . . . date, that night.”
“Quidditch, for one.  And I’ve taken to writing.”  Harry laughed.  “It’s kind of funny.  When I was a student, I hated writing essays.  Hermione would always be on my case to get them done.  Now that I have the time, I’ve discovered that I enjoy writing.”
“Why did you do that?”
Harry merely nodded.
“The logistics are a bit more complicated for us.”
Hugging Draco tightly, Harry tried to convey his appreciation.  “Thank you.  It’ll be great.  You’ll see.”
“I’m not representing the Ministry, per se.  It’s more a personal matter I wish to discuss,” she informed the guard.  “He’ll definitely want to see me.”
“You’ve had a lot to deal with. I don’t want you to have to go through it alone.”
“Fuck it,” Draco said, pulling away.  He threw off his robe, then quickly unbuckled his arm and shin guards.
“No one is going to come all the way up here,” she replied, leaning forward to kiss him again. “Let’s live dangerously.”
“Good.  Not much different from last year.  Except for the Potion’s professor, of course.”  He wanted to kick himself for opening up the conversation to a subject he was hoping to avoid with his friends.  He didn’t want to be in a position to defend his new friend for fear of revealing his true feelings.
“Harry where have you been?” Hermione grilled him.
“Give me a break here,” he said in frustration.  “How about showing me a little something?”
“Dating is one thing, Harry.  Finding your professors in bed together is quite another.”
Draco stood his ground and crossed his arms over his chest.  “I didn’t come here to go sledding.”
“Safe?”
Draco looked at Harry with eyes wide.  “Do you think . . .”
Harry smiled.  “You’re perfect.  And you deserve to be loved perfectly.  I’m still learning.  I’ve never been in love,” he explained.
Lucius simply snorted.
Harry stood.  “That’s all I had to say.  I’ll inform the Ministry of the terms to which we agreed.”
While Harry made it through another day of stares, giggles and sneers, Draco did Potions research in his room.  He kept expecting McGonagall to come in to tell him he’s been sacked.  Minke continued to bring him meals in his room throughout the day as he was still too embarrassed to face the rest of the staff.
“McGonagall will never go for it, Harry.  She won’t want two heads of House gone.  Perhaps you should go alone.”
“Wonderful,” Olivia interjected.  “You know, I had a vision as I was preparing to come here tonight.  One of,” she glanced at Harry and Draco before finishing, “unity.”
“No, you’re not mad.  I’m really standing here. It must be a shock.  Father told me you were certain I was dead.” He chuckled a bit. “He wanted to keep it that way.”
Harry shook his head. “No, she ate two hours ago.  She shouldn’t be hungry.”
“What’s wrong?”
“Okay, I get the point.”
“Don’t get too far without me,” Harry pouted.  He turned on his side away from Draco, offering up his arse, which Draco gladly took as a substitute for his hip.
At that, Draco laughed. “I’ll bet that book was returned quickly.”
“Harry, calm down,” Hermione said.
“About what?” She lowered her voice.  “Voldemort?”
“You can’t go now, Draco,” Harry said, holding out his hand.  “Sit back down.  Why don’t we put in a floo call to Azkaban tomorrow and make an appointment together to see him.”
“Here,” Harry says, intercepting Draco before he walks out the front door and pressing a thermos into his hands. “It’s tea, because I’m not sure how you take your coffee.”

“Yes?”
“Yes, I’m alright.”

that snaps Draco’s reluctance. He turns toward Harry, pressing their chests together, breathing in the smell of sex and cedar and something deeper.
The moment Draco touches himself his entire body goes stiff, and Harry thrusts into him twice more before Draco yells, tightening around Harry and curling into himself. Harry follows into orgasm soon after, heat flooding his thighs as he presses himself down to Draco’s back, murmuring nonsense words into Draco’s sweat-slick skin. When he blinks his eyes open, Draco is trembling underneath him, so Harry slides out of him with a wet
“Gonna fuck you.” Harry’s skin is damp, sliding against Draco’s in a way that makes Draco writhe. Their scars are pressed together, the white arcs bisecting Draco’s torso rubbing across the curved pink-brown on Harry’s chest, terribly intimate. Draco wants simultaneously to hide and to kiss Harry so hard neither of them can think. He chooses the latter, burying his hands in Harry’s curls and wrapping his legs tightly around Harry’s waist. The fullness of Harry’s dick is maddening, sending a flush of heat through Draco’s body with every thrust.
, then, I’m not going back.” He springs into a standing position and I do too, in a more advantageous position with the doorway at my back. There’s a moment of silence as his eyes dart behind me and I hold my hands up in surrender.
Draco makes a wild sound, half sob and half moan. “I don’t. I don’t, I
“Are you feeling alright?”
“You’re exactly what I need, Harry Potter. You– you–
Harry can’t even remember when this started– it seems as though he’s always been driving into the night, Draco breathing softly at his side. They were already friends by the time Draco mentioned his insomnia, even closer by the time their friend group took a road trip in Harry’s car and Draco fell asleep within minutes, slumped against the window. Now, Harry finds himself with his hands on the wheel nearly every night, rummaging in the car boot for blankets and jumpers to pile on Draco when it’s chilly. It helps Harry, too, the time they spend together. He feels quieter, more content, cradling the knowledge that Draco trusts him.
your hair.”
“I wouldn’t,” Harry says, but then his hand
“Green.”
“How would you know,” Harry whispers, “if someone did?”
“Uh-huh,
Draco turns, meeting Harry’s eyes for what must be the first time since they left the house, if the way his chest goes tight is any indication. Harry looks like he always does– long, messy curls pulled up in a bun, the row of gold hoops up his ear glinting in the light, his eyes bright behind his glasses. He’s clean-shaven, but there’s a shadow along the dip of his jaw that Draco has to pull his eyes away from.
“Okay,” Harry murmurs with a bright smile, which is how Draco ends up doubled over his takeout box-strewn coffee table laughing harder than he can remember, because he didn’t know Harry was this
“Do you want me to take you apart?” I murmur, and he nods almost frantically, crashing his mouth up against mine. For a moment I flounder in his insistence, his heat, but I catch up easily, threading my fingers through his silky hair and holding on tight. I move eagerly down to his jaw, then his elegant neck, alternating between wet kisses and gentle drags of teeth. Beneath me, Draco bucks, moaning when his cock slides up against my dick.
“You really will quit?”
to death, and I’ll be useless, Harry! I’ll be useless, with half of a full Healer’s knowledge and hands that won’t be able to stop whatever horrible thing is happening to you, and I’ll lose one of the three people I care about in this world. I didn’t even want to care about you in the first place! But you are so. Damn. Insistent. And you can’t go to St. Mungo’s, and you refuse to go to Hermione, so you came here and I helped you, like an idiot, and now! Now I care about you! So you’re not allowed to fucking
“I’ll pick you up from the Portkey office,” Harry says quietly, “when you come back.”
“Okay, okay, shh, it’s okay. I’m here. I’ve got you, Draco. I’ve got you.”
“Harry, I– tie me up.”
“‘Kay,” Harry says, endlessly endearing. “I love sucking your cock. So pink and gorgeous.”
“Draco,” I supply, then immediately remember I’m supposed to to be on the run. “But my friends uh– call me–”
, Draco thinks desperately, though he knows it won’t do him any good.
,” he says, his expression wondrous. Reaching out for him, I catch his hands as I shimmy down the bed, laying underneath him as he straddles my waist. “You’re so fucking hot. Are you sure?”
Draco hasn’t been alright since Harry grabbed his tear-streaked face and said
that!”
Harry slides his mouth off Draco’s cock, closing his eyes as though pained. “Draco…”
Draco shrugs. “You don’t have to explain it. As long as it feels good for you, and we’re both okay with it, then that’s our business.”
“You’re shaking. I’m gonna pull out now and get you some water, okay?”
“I’ll be on the comm the whole time. It’s gonna be okay.”
“Harry–”
kids, when we– when you– have them. So I’m going to go out on a limb and assume it’s a sex thing, in which case, that’s
“We’re not doing this right now. Not like this,” Harry says softly, trying yet again to draw himself away from Draco, to give him space. Draco whimpers softly, just once, tightening his arms around Harry, who stills. He’s terrified, watching Draco’s carefully upheld mask crack like this. “Draco, I need to know what’s wrong.”
“Draco?” Harry says, and Draco starts.
It starts with Harry’s red and gold tie wrapped around Draco’s wrists, tied to the bedpost of the twin bed they share more nights than not. Their shared room is small and close, lit faintly by the half-moon hanging over the castle grounds like a watchman. Draco’s naked body nearly glows under Harry’s hands, his long arms stretched over his head.
“Yeah.  But do you think McGonagall knows?”
“Please shut up,” Harry mumbled through his sleeves.  He felt utterly humiliated.
“What?” Harry asked.
“What?”  Draco slowly rose from his place.
“The savior of the wizarding world coming out is bound to be news.  The Prophet will be all over it.  Not everyone will be supportive.”
“Let me help you then,” Draco breathed.  “I can make you feel so good.”  He pulled back further to look at Harry.  “Are you
Harry ended up taking the journal.  He decided that he would not have been nearly as mortified if he read it on his own.  Intending to leave as quickly as possible, Harry was once again caught off guard by Draco.
“The one you’re using belongs to me.  It chose me.  It’s
Snickering, Draco replied, “She’s one of my best friends, and she’s cunning as hell.  But academically, Pansy doesn’t have two brain cells to rub together.  Besides, she’s partnered up with Blaise.”
He held out his hand to her, but when she returned the gesture, he brought it to his lips and kissed it.
When they sat down across from one another, Harry got a good look at Draco’s hair.  He giggled.
he’s in love, he is.  Right?”
“Yes.  I want your parents and friends to accept us. What do you say?  Shall we visit the manor for the weekend?”
“Frankly, yes.  The faster we get a name, or names, the faster we can get them off the streets.  The sooner your mother is safe. And you.”
Growing more and more enraged, Harry slammed the paper down.
Afterward, Draco lay on top of Harry, breathing heavily and limp from exhaustion.  He rolled off, grabbed his wand, and Vanished the ropes.
hdhdhd
“Yeah, so Mum’s planning a January wedding.”
Draco appeared unconvinced.
“I just don’t know how someone could give up their child,” she said gently, gazing down at Scorpius.
“And . . .the Quidditch locker room,” Harry muttered quickly.
“I suppose there’s no getting around it.  I’m ready.”  Draco slipped his fringe behind his ears.  “Let’s go.”
The class in general like that idea.  Except Ron, who thought it was nothing special, of course.
“Did you call me?”
“She has no story. No one talked to her. Her photographer didn’t even get a photo.”
Bang.
“Pfft,” Ron waved her off.  “Come on, he tells you more than he tells me.”  Unfortunately for Ron, he was correct.  “So, is it?”
Harry looked to Draco.
“You must have some idea what sort of wedding you want,” he prodded.
Harry leered at his lover.  “So, we can make love for even longer?”
Harry gave him a wink as the ride began to lurch forward in jerky movements. “How many times do I have to correct you?  It’s Potter-Malfoy.  And after this, you can have anything you want.”
“No, I mean spending the night . . . in Draco’s bed,” he blushed.  “The first time, I dreamt that he held a wand to my throat when I woke up and he cursed me.  I woke up before I died in the dream.”
“She is? Thank Merlin,” Harry whispered.  “Do you think I should try to put her down?”
Ron turned to Harry.  “Huh?”
“I can take care of my son myself.  Get out!”
“Nothing.” Parvati remained tight lipped.
The corner of Harry’s mouth rose.  How many men had released themselves into Harry’s arse, he couldn’t count.  Not one had ever asked permission.  Though to be fair, most had worn condoms for that purpose.  But none of those who hadn’t, had considered Harry’s sensibilities the way Draco had.
Harry’s bedroom door opened suddenly, and Draco spilled out wearing the bed sheet wrapped around his waist.  He’d been trying to listen through the door and couldn’t hear everything clearly.  He could tell it wasn’t McGonagall, though, and decided the visitor had overstayed his welcome.
“That’s such good news, Ron,” Harry said, giving him a few pats on the shoulder.  “I’m sure you feel so much better now.”
Pointing to a book on the counter, Draco waved the wand. “Wingardium Leviosa.”
“All right.”
“I was hoping to do something a little more unorthodox,” Harry answered vaguely.  “I want it to be very special.”
Ron stood, begging Hermione to stay.  “It’s not that I don’t want you, I swear.  I do.   Especially now that I know you’re wearing fancy knickers.  I wasn’t expecting you to, you know, get so randy.  I planned this evening out, all the details. And when you started throwing it off, I got a bit stressed out.”
Padma sat up on the floor in the Slytherin common room, where she had spent the night playing cards and gossiping with Millicent.
Hermione beamed.  Others groaned, as they were only a step behind her.  Professor Slughorn presented Hermione with her certificate while the class looked on.  She was tied with Draco in wins, but he appeared distracted and she knew she would have to be on her best to continue beating him.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said softly.  His head was beginning to swim as he stared at the faded tattoo.
Ron shrugged.  “I guess they kick us out.”
Draco’s nostrils flared slightly in disgust for the slimy looking brown noodle dish.
True to his word, Draco pulled Harry away the moment the ceremony was over and they had offered their congratulations.  Draco didn’t relax until they were safely tucked away in Harry’s dormitory.  Ron remained at the Burrow with Hermione, Dean was obviously not coming back to live with the other Gryffindors, and Neville had been spending much of his free time in Luna’s common room.  Seamus would most likely return from wherever he was, but not until later.
“Ergh--fine,” Harry growled. “Fuck, how are you always so in control?”
Even after the initial shock of it had dissipated, he still found it incomprehensible that Potter was the one who had so enthralled him a few nights ago. He’d always been acutely aware of Potter in school, of course, but that was only because he was famous, and because they’d been enemies. He’d known more about Potter than most people had back then, but who knew what he would be like now that they were older?
“Harry,” he whispered again. He knew it sounded strangled, and pathetic, and weak. He knew he was about to break. But Harry pulled Draco into his arms and held him close, as if there was nothing to consider.
“No,” Harry replied. “Finish your interview.”
“Yes, stiff,” Harry replied. “You just completely shut me out for some reason.”
He turned on the spot and was gone. As shamefully sentimental as it was, Draco immediately felt bereft.
“Thanks,” he said, some feeling coming back into his body. Ron and Hermione were having another baby. Fuck, he was too tipsy to handle this information.
falling for each other, hard and fast. Why did Draco ever bother to resist? There was absolutely nothing he could do to stop this. He decided from that moment on, as he watched Harry’s chest rise and fall, that perhaps just letting it happen was the best option anyway.
“Maybe I like being played with,” Malfoy countered before smirking again.
Draco smirked at him. “Of course I did. Looks as if I’m the Gryffindor tonight, Potter.”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said, sighing again. “I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I was planning to pull Ron and Hermione aside tonight and tell them alone, and eventually we did find a moment together, and I… I don’t know what happened. This doesn’t usually happen to me, ever, but I just completely lost all of my nerve. I panicked. I couldn’t tell them.”
He took another long swig and then set his beer down on the coffee table. He was suddenly quite sure that he had had enough for the evening.
He knew Harry had gone by now, and he couldn’t bring himself to go back inside and see nothing but his empty house. And Harry somehow belonged in that house now. He could feel it in his very core. Yet, once again, his fear had dictated the course of his actions, something he had always vowed, without success, to change about himself. Perhaps cocking things up was one of the many things that were so 'very much Draco’ of him, as Harry had said. Harry had always had the mark of him, after all.
“I’m sorry that you hate yourself sometimes,” Harry replied. “And I’m sorry for getting angry at you when you do. You can voice your thoughts with me, even the bad ones. I’ll tell you you’re wrong as often as I need to.”
“Ah, but do you own it?” Harry challenged.
“You just do that sometimes; we’re going along all flirty and teasing and then you say something so profoundly romantic that it makes my heart stop. It always shocks me.”
“Blue balls,” Draco murmured. “A riot.”
He and Potter walked in silence for a few minutes, inconveniently going against the grain, as most people were heading towards the pub that he and Harry had just exited. Draco noticed the throngs thinning the further they walked down the streets, however, eventually trickling down from bustling crowds to groups and couples to the odd straggler, until finally he and Harry were quite alone on one of the side roads some distance away from the Leaky Cauldron. It was still fairly early, but the sun was drifting lower in the sky, and Draco felt a peaceful hum in his belly that was altogether pleasant. Probably the alcohol. Definitely the alcohol.
Draco snorted. “It’s quite the departure from the way I grew up, I know. But yes, I rather like it as well.”
“See?” Harry grinned, but it was a little dazed. “Only now I’m gonna have to wank later.”
“I know what you mean,” Draco nodded. “Comes with age, I suppose.”
Draco picked up two nearly-empty bottles of Newcastle from his coffee table and brought them into the kitchen with him, dumping the lukewarm contents down the sink. He filled his kettle and set it on the stove top, staring out his window. He smiled to himself when he remembered that he needed to fill it for two this morning. He wasn’t entirely sure that he had stopped smiling the whole morning, in fact. Another giggle escaped his mouth; really, this was beyond ridiculous. He felt like a third-year. A third-year Hufflepuff, even. Good grief.
He threw down a fistful of floo powder and stepped out of Ron and Hermione’s fireplace a moment later, haphazardly dusting off his well-worn jeans as he glanced around their cozy sitting room.
For the second time in only a few minutes, Draco shot up out of his seat as if someone had hexed him and paced the small expanse of living room floor once, twice, three times. He stopped dead and looked at the bemused Potter.
Harry didn’t say anything, but he looked as if he wanted to.
“I’ve often wondered how on earth you can presume to call me the arrogant one, Potter.” Draco smiled.
Harry had taken two steps before he noticed Draco had stopped walking, and he turned around to stare at Draco uncertainly.
They looked at each other for a long while, and Harry took a mental picture of Draco’s face so he could study it line by line later.
And then they both said, “Yes,” and laughed.
Draco tried not to think about the last time they had seen each other as he knocked softly against the doorframe.
“Okay, okay, sorry,” he said, not sounding sorry in the slightest. “But it’s weird, you asking me things and me not asking back.”
Harry was quiet for a moment. Draco watched him slip his hands inside the pockets of his jumper.
Harry laughed. “You make me smarter.”
Guilt washed over Harry, more forcefully than he could’ve anticipated. Was that really true? Hadn’t he deserved at least part of the blame for their enmity over the years?
“Smells good,” Harry told him.
“Don’t be an arse, I was just going to ask you if you wanted to meet him, one day, when he’s over.”
“Adhering to the rules of proper grammar hardly makes me a weirdo, Potter,” Draco said smugly.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from breaking down in tears again. He knew Harry made a very good point--a point that Draco had introduced, really. But it stung, and it all amounted to the same thing: Harry was ashamed of him.
All Draco could do was stare. That was easily and without contest the kindest thing anyone had ever said to him.
Draco shivered. “Best let ourselves recover for a moment first.”
“Actually, I think I was one of the few who knew you weren’t nearly as bad as you thought you were,” Harry told him.
“I’ve got it here,” Draco said, holding it out for him.
“Oh, are you ugly in real life?” Draco asked bluntly before taking another dainty sip of espresso.
Draco let forth a loud shrieking sound, which seemed to surprise both of them.
“What?” Harry demanded hastily, leaning forward in his chair.
“If I’m a prick, then why did you request me to conduct your interview?” Draco asked casually. He tapped his finger against his mug, and he avoided Harry’s eyes long enough for Harry to know that he was really dying to hear the answer.
“I was wondering if you had a spare moment to speak with me,” Draco began. “I’m sure you know what about.”
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco muttered back, shifting on his feet. Honestly, he was making quite a big deal of it.
“Hey,” Harry said gently, taking a step forward and looking up at Draco; oh, how he’d missed those diamond eyes. “I’m on your team, Dragon.”
“Hmm,” Potter said, his head tilted. “That seems fair.”
“Now you know how I felt at the pitch last week, Potter,” Draco teased him. “Impatience runs in the family, I see.”
“What?” Harry bellowed angrily.
“Or perhaps start packing away some band’s equipment and following them on the road like some 1970s American trucker.”
Draco snorted. “One out of two.”
“But… why not?”
For the love of all that was holy, he wanted to kiss Harry Potter.
“Here’s another tip, sweetheart,” Draco told him, resting his head casually against the headboard. “Don’t call me sir unless you’re ready for a thoroughly vicious arse-fucking immediately thereafter.”
Draco let go of every inhibition as he imagined everything he wanted to do with Harry, every line they could cross together. He wanted to do it all, to have every piece of Harry for his own. His hand twisted vigorously up and down his cock. He could almost feel the magic crackling in the air between them.
“You are,” Draco laughed with him. “That was… quite a kiss.”
“Did you jerk off?” Harry asked him, his mouth full.
Slowly but surely, the events of the previous day seeped into his foggy mind: being cursed by Alex (he shivered in horror), waking up in St Mungo’s, coming to Harry’s house in a state of numb shock… confessing their feelings (oh…), asking Harry to crawl into bed with him (oh no), and to stay with him through the night (oh NO). Harry, being Harry, had obviously complied, and was now sleeping in the bed beside him.
thing in his world. As if every kiss was a hundred I love you’s.
Draco couldn’t possibly describe to Harry how appealing that offer was. He nodded nonchalantly. “That’s fine by me.”
“Delusional,” Draco replied, a tiny smile creeping over him.
“My escort?” Draco asked, smirking as he followed Harry. “How very indecent.”
“Well he is a bit of an oaf, Potter,” Draco argued, and Potter rolled his eyes in response. “Honestly I was a bit afraid of him, if you must know. The fact that he was with you, and I could already tell you were leery of me… I don’t know, I felt oddly panicked that you didn’t like me, and I wanted everyone to like me.”
Harry walked around to the other side of the bed and yanked his glasses off before pulling back the covers and crawling in next to Draco. When he turned onto his side, Draco was already facing him.
“Please?” Harry said, pouting. “It doesn’t even have to be dirty, it can be sweet. One flirty line. Just tell me how cute I look.”
“Such as?” Draco asked. He pulled out a chair and turned it around so that it was facing Harry, and he sat down.
“I didn’t know, actually,” Potter muttered, scowling a little. He took a sip of his butterbeer.
“Hey, wake up.”
with him?
“Hush,” Draco told him, reaching for his warm hands again before proceeding. “Nothing permanent, only some pain in my head and neck. The Healers explained that I should try not to move them until tomorrow. They gave me a potion while I was there, but it doesn’t take full effect for twelve hours. In other words, I should be completely fine by morning.”
“Good,” she mumbled to herself, flipping the page. “Actually, you seem to have covered a lot so far.”
Good morning my handsome angel. Notes on pillows, the height of romance, no? I’m sorry I woke you last night, and I hope I didn’t frighten you. Despite all the times you’ve tried to convince me it won’t happen, I guess my subconscious is still a little scared of losing you. Anyway, hope you slept well regardless. Merlin, you look beautiful when you’re sleeping. I swear I could spend all day just looking at you. I’m staying over again tonight, right? I’m going to pretend that this was already agreed upon. Actually, that’ll be my prize in our wager, so you can’t say no. I’ll see you around supper time, then, and I’ll cook us something, and now I’m late for work again dammit, love you three times. H
Harry wrinkled his nose at him and shook his head in disappointment. “Wrong.”
Ron picked up his wand and aimed it at the bolognese sauce boiling over on the stovetop, stirring it with the charmed spoon. “Forgot about the sauce.”
“Oh, yeah, my jumper--”
“You can stay over,” Draco suggested, a little shyly. “If you want to, that is. Remember school is officially out for summer, so I’m not obligated to be anywhere at all on Monday. Or all summer, come to think of it. And I remember you mentioned that you weren’t starting until the afternoon on Monday, so we might have a little extra time together, in the morning.”
“Why don’t we tell people tomorrow?”
“That’s my card,” Draco began, and his voice sounded so formal that it made Harry smile. “I know you know I’m Draco Malfoy, but I work under a different name, which is the one listed there. There’s nothing sinister about it, I just… well, it makes things a little easier. For everyone. I’m sure you can understand. The joys of being a former Death Eater, and whatnot.”
Harry released a long sigh. The fact was, he was used to nightmares by now. He was used to fear. And somehow, until this very moment, he hadn’t realized just how fucked up that was.
Harry laughed. “Just as long as you tell everyone I went out in a blaze of glory.”
“Why are you so crotchety?” Harry asked him nonchalantly. “You were really nice a couple days ago.”
“Shut up.”
“Whatever, Potter,” he spat out. “You didn’t realize I was gay either.”
Draco huffed, shifting in his seat. “No, I’m not going to sue him either. Merlin’s beard. Why do you ask?”
To his disappointment, Malfoy’s face had suddenly hardened into the mask he had worn so often at Hogwarts. Harry definitely preferred a smiling Malfoy, but when he was glaring like this, he almost looked like he was made of marble. A work of art. He made Harry’s pulse quicken...
Draco relished the feeling that Harry knew him so well as to know that teasing was the exact right thing to do at this moment. He was starting to really believe that Harry knew him better than most people, and he suddenly wanted to spend hours testing that theory.
“I want to kiss you.”
“I’m full of great words,” Draco said. “It’s my job.”
"Please, Draco..."
“And I still say you think that way because you really don’t give yourself enough credit, Draco,” Harry said. “You’re good at talking to people. Most of the time.”
Before anyone could say another word, his father spun on his heel and apparated from the room, just as Draco had predicted would happen.
“Is that what you want?” Draco knew the answer already, but he was still a little bit nervous to hear Harry’s response.
“Because apart from how absurdly stupid that would be, it’s terribly unfair that you should already have several names for me, when all I can call you is Potter.”
Draco stuttered over his words as Harry stared at him with those stunning emerald eyes. "Well, yes. Not even you. Maybe I’ll explain someday, but… not yet.”
“You’re completely mad.”
Draco’s focus zeroed in on the word ‘us.’
Harry grinned at him. “Like banshees versus werewolves?”
Draco smiled and breathed out a laugh. “Unless we’re debating banshees versus werewolves.”
Rosalind smirked (she could give him a run for his money) as if she knew exactly what he was thinking. “Couldn’t tell you.”
Harry watched as Draco then reached into the pocket of his trousers and pulled out a thin, silver business card holder, his initials engraved on it in an ostentatious script. He took a card from inside and placed it unceremoniously in front of Harry. When Harry finally saw a hint of insecurity in his face, he felt oddly warmed.
No, Harry had ceased viewing Malfoy as his enemy many years ago. He’d just been another one of Voldemort’s many victims, and in that, Harry felt not only pity, but also an unexpected affinity for him.
“No residual symptoms?” She waved her wand, and a steaming cup of tea appeared before him.
“She is, yes.” Harry sipped his tea and said no more.
Yes. He could do this. He
“Put your hands behind your back!” he yelled.
“I’m a fucking idiot,” he muttered to himself as he made his way to the bathroom, hastily pulling off his clothing as he went.
“Speak for yourself.”
They were silent for a moment when Draco noticed that a glass of firewhiskey sat before him. He fought back a smirk and unclenched his fist to pick it up.
Draco rolled his eyes and rubbed his thumb against the top of Harry’s hand. “I was obviously lying, you nutter.”
“Lucky for you, there are two reliable witnesses,” she continued. “And even luckier, neither of those witnesses hate you enough not to testify on your behalf.”
Harry nodded. “I know what you mean.”
He walked to the bathroom as quickly as his legs could take him. Draco let his mind wander as he relieved himself.
He’d missed that smile. He’d missed all of him, really, even the longsuffering sighs, the eye rolls, the snide remarks… every single part. Now that they were in the same space again, all Harry wanted to do was watch him.
Harry smiled. “I’m sure. But it means a lot to me that you said that.”
Draco snorted at him as he tugged his borrowed track bottoms back into place beneath the covers. “You haven’t seen the half of it, Potter.”
I love you, I love you, I love you. Remember, three times makes it official. See you tomorrow. Send some kisses back with Ari.
“Precisely.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “Sure.”
Harry laughed. “Merlin, you’re even less mature than I am.”
“And you’re good at it,” Harry said, embarrassed as soon as it slipped out.
He felt the snitches yet again, only they had migrated and were now ricocheting to and fro throughout his entire body. He placed a steadying hand on the counter beside the stovetop, leaning back into Harry’s touch without even consciously thinking about it. It felt so warm, so steady, so reassuring against him.
“Not at all, you’ve already admitted it a thousand times over, in a thousand different ways.”
“It was,” Draco said truthfully.
When Draco tamed his chuckles and smiled over at him again, the blatant affection in his eyes made Harry feel like he’d just swallowed a Cornish pixie.
Among Draco’s favorite discoveries: Harry always stopped what he was doing when a thunderstorm rolled in, so that he could observe it through his open window (he was curious). He had dreamed of becoming a firefighter as a child, before his Hogwarts days (he was heroic, even back then, and consequently very patient while he explained to Draco exactly what a ‘firefighter’ was). Cockroach Clusters freaked him out (he was reasonable; those fuckers were disgusting). He’d once accidentally let a snake out of its enclosure at the zoo because his insufferable cousin had pissed him off (he was feisty, and hilarious when he was telling stories). He spent every second Tuesday with his godson Teddy (he was responsible). He supported the horrendous Chudley Cannons, of all things, because Weasley did (he was loyal). He liked being around happy couples (he was romantic). And the whistle of a distant train was probably his favorite sound in the world (he was... well, surprising).
Harry moaned again, nibbling his bottom lip. “Draco…”
“Drink it, Potter,” Draco commanded.
Harry paused again. “That’s a nice thing to say.”
“All cured,” Draco managed to inform him. He knew Harry would worry if Draco mentioned his now-insignificant headache, and Draco didn’t want to break whatever heavenly spell had landed him here. He placed a hand on Harry’s chest. “You’re my panacea.”
Draco wasn’t sure how to say what he was feeling, because as eloquent a speaker as Potter told him he was, when it really counted, sometimes Draco still failed to find the words.
Draco spent the better part of the weekend ignoring his mixed (and extremely confusing) feelings, feverishly researching everything he could find regarding Potter, and subsequently brainstorming every conceivable question for their interviews. By the time he had exhausted himself of anything and everything that the public could possibly want to know about Harry Potter, he had an entire notebook full of questions, another full of research, and a metaphorical trunkload of apprehension. He felt as if a tornado was on the horizon, and there was absolutely nothing he could do to stop it.
DRACO
Harry snorts, resting his cheek against Draco’s shoulder. “Yeah. It would need to be–”
Harry shrugs. “I’m just not supposed to.”
for me, Harry.”
“Grav.”
Draco nearly sprints to the Apparition point in front of the manor the gala is held at. He
“I Apparated to the first place I could think of.” Draco’s eyes are still closed, and his face is smooth, expressionless. “You make me feel safe.”
“I know,” Harry pants, holding himself above Draco, running a slick hand over Draco’s flushed pink cock. “I know, I’m good at this, I know how to–”
, with his fucking perfectly curved ears, and he laughs without humor.
“Draco, just deal with it for a bit longer, you shouldn’t get freaked out by a
“Okay.”
“You didn’t have to,” Draco repeats, his hands fluttering in front of him.
“Don’t let that shirt wrinkle,” Harry says firmly, and Draco sees the words for what they are– Harry knowing Draco will be upset later at his own lack of care. Draco carefully folds the shirt, bending over to set it next to his feet. When he stands back up again, his hand landing on his belt buckle, Harry speaks again.
All he wants is to hold Draco again.
“Darling,” Draco says, and Harry hums as he slides his lips around the tip of Draco’s cock. “Oh– fuck, that’s good,” Draco stutters. Harry hums again, pleased, and starts to bob his head. “You’re so good, Harry.”

me this.”
“You talk about your arse in public.”
“I like when you beg,” he repeats, leaning down to nip at Draco’s shoulder. In retaliation Draco reaches down and strokes the length of Harry’s dick, basking in Harry's gasp as the magically-imbued sensitivity makes him feel the action as though Draco is touching
“Hey.”

“Here, you get in first.” Harry turns down the covers more, watching Draco the whole time. “If I sleep closer to the door I can keep you safe.”
“I haven’t been alright,” he whispers, eyes darting everywhere but your face. “I missed you I tried to be what I was supposed to be I tried to do what you asked I don’t think it worked–”
“I love you.”
“Well.” Draco throws an arm around Harry’s waist, strangely nervous all of a sudden. “I mean, if you want things to be casual, I guess I can–”
,” he moans, his voice shuddering as Harry gently blows air across his hole. “Get on with it, then.”
“Hey– oh,” Harry says, blinking at me. I look down, but I’m just wearing a set of silken sleep robes, nothing special. Before I can question his reaction he slides out of the bed, gesturing towards it. “I have to sleep closer to the door. Just a thing.”
. “Christ, Harry,” he says breathlessly, staring up as Harry straddles his hips.
“I can do it,” Harry says, stepping in front of Draco. “If you want.”
“I– I understand,” Draco says softly, nonplussed, and then Harry
“Yes,” Draco whispers, tilting her face up so the word runs silky along the skin of Harry’s jaw.
Harry sputters for a long moment and I laugh loudly, unabashedly; if he thinks I’m a virgin he has another thing coming. I may have been sheltered, but I
“I just– Everytime I’m in my room, it feels like you.” Draco exhales, glancing to the side. “I didn’t realize– I didn’t even have
The sirens still pound through my eardrums but so does Potter’s voice.
“Here.” Harry kneels down next to Malfoy, ignoring the way she stiffens. “You’re putting too much dirt in. You have to leave enough room to create a deep hole, for the tuber to be put into.” Harry dips her hands into the pot, putting some dirt back in the bag. She braces herself for a cutting remark, but Malfoy just sighs.
“Let me hold you instead.”
“Ughhh. Don’t be responsible right now.” Draco waves a vague hand towards me and I lie back down on the bed fully. “You just shagged the life out of me. I deserve rest.”
.” Harry’s eyes get wide, and he sways back towards Draco, just a bit. “I thought I was just a distraction for you. Just something in between real relationships. I– I didn’t know. You never said.”
The next day Draco Owls with a pointed request for Harry not to make dinner, refusing to explain why, which is how Harry ends up pleasantly wine drunk and crammed into a small booth at a cozy Italian restaurant, transfixed by Draco’s hands as he talks animatedly. It’s then that Harry connects the dots, remembering how methodical and single minded Draco is when he’s serious about something, and it crashes over him like a wave.
“I’m too tall to be the little spoon,” Draco protests weakly.
Harry makes a low noise. “Shut up. Shut
Draco sits pale and tired, curled up in the passenger seat of Harry’s car. The radio plays softly, lyrics unintelligible, and Harry keeps both hands on the wheel.
“I want you to know how much fun I’m having.” Draco sounds shocked, but happy. “I’m not new to this but I’ve never had– so much fun. I’ve never trusted someone so much to make this good for me.”
breaking up with you,” Draco says fiercely, and Harry sinks fully to the carpet in relief. Matching his movement, Draco crosses his long legs, still holding Harry’s face almost painfully. “I was going to ask if you wanted to move in together, but I should’ve had a single intelligent thought about opening that conversation like… that.
“Harry?” Draco rubs his eyes again, glancing around the common room. They rarely interact outside their own room, but here’s Harry, holding onto Draco’s shoulder even as Granger and Weasley watch with interest from over by the fireplace.
kissing, and his dark curls fall tousled over his forehead and the tips of his ears.
all you want,” Pansy snaps her finger under Draco’s nose, and he startles, “you’re acting disgustingly smitten. It’s horrifying.”
“Oh, it’s always easy to tell,” he replies, looking from the display in front of him over to me with an exaggerated wink, and my stomach swoops. Did he mean–
“Let me bask in the afterglow,” Harry protests, but he slides out of Draco slowly, smoothing a hand down Draco’s side. He slides off the bed and pads to the bathroom to wash the strap-on; Draco grabs blindly for his wand and cleans up the bed, forgoing the come smeared on his stomach because he knows Harry will be back soon.
until this is fixed, Harry will most certainly figure out–
“C’mon,” Hermione says softly, nudging Harry’s shoulder. As they head on, leaving Malfoy standing in the hallway pulling at the ends of her hair, Harry forces herself to think about the Charms essay she needs to finish.
Closing his eyes, Harry breathes around the ache in his chest.
“Draco, when did you borrow my pants?”
“You don’t.” Harry pauses. “You… you don’t, right?”
“All I’m saying is, that's usually the way I deal with strangers who end up on my ship.”
“Yes, yes,
“I could’ve Apparated,” Draco says, but his tone lacks conviction.
“No you’re not,” Harry says before whining long and high as Draco crooks his fingers. Draco presses his mouth to Harry’s collarbone, licking off the beads of sweat gathered there. “You’re not, I’m not gonna come, it’s just–"
“Tell me,” Harry says, low in his throat. “Tell me what this was like, to have this inside you at the gala.”
“Well then. How are we going to burn down the Ministry?”
“What do you–” Harry starts, then coughs sheepishly. “It
“You want to fuck me.” Draco stares, incredulous. “Oh, Merlin. You want to fuck me so badly you’re
“Will you actually watch the movie?” Harry laughs when Draco moves away, panting warm air across Harry’s cheek. “Or just kiss me?”
“Only you would find the most roundabout way to call me beautiful,” she says, and Harry shrugs.
“I need you fuck me right now,” Draco demands in a rush, and I laugh breathlessly.
“You’re going to have to tell Hermione,” Draco says softly, and Harry goes stiff before slumping against Draco.
“No,” Harry whispers.
“Why?” Harry asks before he can think about it. Draco shrugs, then shimmies his pyjama pants up to his hips as best he can. There are bruises on his waist that Harry doesn’t remember leaving.
Harry laughs. “Is that a yes?”
Draco tackles Harry to the floor with the force of his kiss.
Something wistful flits across Draco’s face, but then he frowns. “I don’t really have time for– I’m not really in the mood, if I’m being honest. I’ll probably be thinking about this the whole time.”
“No!” Draco lunges, catching Harry’s face in his hands and pushing both of them further into the room. “No, no, my mistake was pretending I
you get to come.”
. Draco learns that being in a crowd stresses Harry out, that he has never been uncomfortable with Draco’s presence, just the settings in which they bumped into each other; like this, just the two of them, Harry is so impossibly bright, his grin contagious.
“Okay.” Draco presses his forehead to Harry’s. Both of them are breathing hard, and Draco trembles with relief and the proximity of Harry.
Draco’s fingers go tight before disappearing altogether, leaving coolness in their wake. Harry’s chest clenches, convinced he’s said too much, but then he glances across the car and Draco is smiling. It’s his sweet smile, his softest one. His rarest.
I want you, but it’s too much right now, I can’t–”
“I adore you too, you sap,” Draco whispers, then lets his eyes fall shut.
“Took too much over the summer,” Harry replies, staring up at the ceiling. “I don’t have to come into your bed if it bothers you.”
Heat shivers through Draco’s stomach, and his cock strains against his trousers, but he ignores it entirely. He slides the belt out of the loops and folds it neatly in his hands, walking over to Harry at a purposefully controlled pace. He keeps his eyes down on Harry’s heeled boots as he holds his hand out, inhaling sharply when the weight of the belt disappears from his palm.
fading away. I MUST NOT TELL LIES. You’re laughing, tripping over your own tongue, because you don’t tell lies, you dig them out, spade into the maggotted loam of the Ministry, pulling out the rot at the roots, they’ll never take you alive. You will succeed. You have to. You will.
“Don’t,” Harry says quietly, suddenly exhausted. “Draco, just don’t, okay? We’re almost to your flat.”
know I can’t actually get pregnant,” Draco says when it’s clear that Harry isn’t going to emerge anytime soon. He doesn’t know if talking about it will make it worse, but he doesn’t have a clue what else to do. “I also know that you want to
and I–”
” Draco shouts as Harry shifts down between his knees, sliding in a finger up to the knuckle, thumbing over the tip of Draco’s cock. They had negotiated this earlier, too– Draco usually prefers anal, but sometimes he wants to be fucked here, and Harry
“I thought… that we’re friends? Not– not great friends, but…” Harry trails off, looking so young and desperate for a moment that Draco grabs Harry’s hand and squeezes just once before letting go.
“Okay, well when are you going to finish decorating your room then?”
“I have to fix this,” Harry says, and that’s when Draco notices there’s a considerable amount of some sort of smoke or vapor coming out of Harry’s mouth everytime he speaks.
“Burnt my hand,” Draco says, sounding strained, and Harry does turn around now, very quickly. Draco is clutching his fingers and glaring at the hob like it personally offended him which, Harry has to admit, it
REWARD: 1 MILLION UNITS
, he says. You just like being a brat, hm?” I pour even more lube over my fingers, ignoring the sporadic pulling on my hair. “I thought you wanted me to fuck you.”
“We cook
“You want crepes?”
“The lights make you look like an angel,” Harry murmurs, and Draco melts against his side. Harry snorts, then grabs onto his wrist, pulling him out the door and all the way to the Apparition point.
Twenty minutes ago, Draco was mildly tipsy and trying desperately not to be self-pitying as he propped himself up alone against the bar of Verve, his usual gay club. Muggle, of course.
“Draco,” someone says softly, then louder: “Draco.”
is good enough for Draco, in Harry’s opinion. The man cries over animal movies and knits socks and launches himself at Harry for a hug when he gets excited about something, and Harry is skeptical that anyone knows how to be gentle with Draco in the way he needs.
“Do we wanna put something different on?” Harry asks, interrupting Joshua’s chatter as Draco flinches hard at a sound from the telly, meeting Harry’s eyes rather frantically. Joshua blinks at Harry, something tight flashing across his features.
“Are you sure? You don’t have much here.” Harry turns, surveying the small number of boxes scattered across the floor.
“Fuck,” I bite out, and he snickers as he brings the lights back up then manoveurs us to an upright position before turning the grav–
“And you know fucking well that I won’t.” Hurt flashes across Draco’s face for a moment, and Harry steps back out into the hall, chastised. “Draco, I just… you deserve to have someone, right now. And I still think I can fix this.”
“Hey,” Draco says softly, dragging his hands down from Harry’s curls to cradle the back of Harry’s neck. The heat between them settles into something gentler, a crackling hearth fire in place of a blazing house. “It’s okay, Harry.”
Harry smirks, raising himself up to his knees before slowly sliding down Draco’s cock again. One hand is behind him, pushing the dildo into Draco with small thrusts, and he licks a stripe up his other hand before letting it drift down to the rosy tip of his own cock. As Draco watches, Harry closes his fingers completely around his cock and then throws his head back with a gasp.
“I– I.” Draco wants to roll away from Harry’s warmth, to tuck himself up into it and never leave; instead, he simply freezes. “What is this?”
, she nearly continues, but swallows the words back down.
, Harry thinks. His thoughts are solidifying quicker now, flashes of Draco’s pliant mouth around his cock, of long blonde hair brushing across his shoulder, of his own voice saying
You just
“Excuse me,” Harry says, appearing at Draco’s side as though Draco
“Fine,” Draco says, trailing further into his tiny studio flat. His bed takes up an alcove off to the side, and he flops down on it, already shimmying out of his pyjama pants.
As soon as the magic specialist sighs and waves Harry out of the room, he goes to find Draco.
to have sex the way that works for you, Harry.”
I bite down on his shoulder, keeping my lube covered hand outstretched and away from the sheets, and he yelps, the sound quickly dissolving into laughter.
. He kisses back with all of his desperation, all of his fears and affection, pushing Harry back into the living room. Harry tightens his fingers in Draco’s hair, pulling Draco even impossibly closer for a moment before gently tugging him away. “I’ll quit my job. I thought– I thought it was supposed to be like this, I didn’t know… I didn’t know. And I wasn’t allowed to say anything.”
. Draco stumbles in shock, and then horror rips through him.
“You’re okay, it’s okay,” Harry murmurs, reaching up to enfold Draco into his arms. Against his shoulder Draco takes heaving breaths, clearly trying and failing to stop crying. Harry gently pulls Draco forward until he slides off the toilet, crumpling down in Harry’s lap. “Shhh, I know. I know.” Harry keeps murmuring nonsense into Draco’s ear, rubbing his back in small circles. He’s never seen Draco like this, and every sob digs right into his heart. Eventually Draco quiets, hiccuping softly as he shakes in Harry’s arms.
Friends. You had been friends.
Harry opens his mouth to ask something, but all that comes out is a soft puff of air, and then he’s forgotten the question. Everything in his mind feels warm and slow. Sated.
“What–
“How much time.” Harry doesn’t ask it like a question. Starting, Draco stares at the takeout containers on his desk, fragrant and steaming.
Harry exhales, then gestures at the book. “I’m reading this at least three times before I use any rope on you,” he says, unable to stop a grin stealing across his face, and Draco tackles him to the sofa cushions.
“No,” Draco sobs, louder now. “No, I want you. I
“Okay.” Harry’s voice is soft, placating. “Okay, look, it’s alright.” It’s absolutely not alright– Harry’s breath still clouds the air in front of him, and he coughs a bit, soft and then harsh. But he falls to his knees in front of Draco, waving an easy hand to drop the barrier. Draco’s hands remain frozen in the air momentarily, and Harry catches them in his own. “Look, see. I’ve stopped. It’s alright.”
“Maybe I’ll have you sit here all night,” Harry says. “Just sit here while I get myself off to your pretty mouth, wrapped around that gag like it’s my cock.” Harry moves his thumb to Draco’s bottom lip, tracing the wet line of it. He shifts closer to Draco, nosing along the line of Draco’s shoulder, barely a breath away from kissing his bare skin. There’s nothing from Draco but a sharp inhale through his nose, even as Harry
“Bring me your belt.”
“Yes,” Draco says, whining slightly as Harry slips his finger in. He tries to keep quiet, to make it easier for both of them, but– “
Harry snorts. “Agreed.” They lapse back into comfortable silence, the radio crackling out an old country song.
“For the strap, my dick,” I say, bringing my hand lower, lower down his stomach. “For myself, cock.”
I have to–”
Harry sways backwards, his expression serious, now. Intent. “So, we’re not friends? I thought you said we were better off as friends.”
Draco nods, still blinking slowly. His expression is so open, the way it always is when he wakes up in the car, and Harry’s hands ache to hold him. To make sure Draco’s real, that he’s here, that he isn’t having nightmares again. Harry flicks his eyes to the rearview mirror, plotting the way back to Draco’s flat; he’s done this enough that he’s nearly always right, even without a map.
. Those green eyes had been bright all the way up until the moment that Draco had pulled on his jumper and departed, leaving decisive words of
“Hah!” I jab my finger at his face. “I’m twenty-five.”
“In my drawers.”
“You didn’t tell me you knew who I was.”
“Your hair.”
“Good boy,” Draco says muzzily from where he’s loose-limbed across the sofa cushions. Harry climbs into his lap and comes with three pulls of Draco’s fingers.
,” Harry says as earnestly as he can, and that rings true also. He’s fine living with this feeling on his own as long as Draco knows how wonderful he is. “Really. You were just on a date, for Merlin’s sake. I understand why it wouldn’t be me. But you are
“Fuck,” Harry breathes. “Fuck, you’re shaking. It’s alright. We’re okay. Merlin, you’re so cold.”
“I want it,” Draco says into the sheets. The hand on his neck goes tighter.
“I’m going to ask you what I can do, and you can say yes or no. Do you want the blindfold off?”
“Lube,” Draco says. “Harry, lube,
.” I shimmy my body a bit in victory and he laughs, resting his forehead against my shoulder.
“And I’m going to take care of
“Come to bed, Harry,” Draco whispers, and Harry swallows against the longing in his throat. “I’m so tired.”
Who, or what, did that to Harry?
“Yeah?” I’m breathless already. “Tell me about it.”
“I’d like you to fuck me,” Harry says.
“Hey,” Harry says on an exhale. Draco startles. Harry had been breathing so deeply, Draco assumed he was asleep. “Are you alright?”
“I just didn’t want to take advantage. And I don’t want this to be a one and done thing. If I have you, I’m not letting you go. I couldn’t. You’re too brilliant, and sharp, and fucking–
“Merlin, that hurt,” Draco says, but his grip on Harry’s wrist doesn’t let up, so Harry repeats the motion again and again until Draco is shaking so violently the dresser rattles against the wall. Harry’s own cock is painfully hard, pushing against the fabric of his boxers, and without warning Draco shoves a hand beneath Harry’s waistband, but then he stops.
Harry opens her mouth to snap back, but then stops herself; Malfoy’s voice is flat, and her shoulders are slumped. Harry watches as Malfoy plunges her bare hands into the bag of dirt at her side and transfers it to the pot in front of her. When she shakes out her hands, her fingernails are caked black; the sight feels wrong in a way that settles deep in Harry’s chest.
Flick your wand. Flick your wand,
She blinks her big blue eyes at him. She’s pretty, and he wants to tell her, except the words keep getting stuck behind something that aches a lot like the way looking at Draco in the morning makes Harry ache. No strings, they’d said. It just made sense, when Draco ended up shaking in Harry’s bed with nightmares anyways.
“Hedwig,” I start, “what model of ship is that?”
Where anger used to sit in Harry’s chest there’s now a raw, pulsing panic. He’s responsible for the pain his hands have caused. He’s responsible for fixing this.
“Harry–
“You idiot,” Draco gasps when they break apart, sounding as though he’s a second away from either crying or laughing. Harry gulps in a breath, still dazed from the feeling of Draco’s soft lips on his own. “You idiot. Of course I like you. I thought you knew and were just politely turning me down!”
Harry’s expression goes soft and he presses a kiss to Draco’s cheek. Automatically Draco brings his hands down to grab Harry’s curls, wanting to keep Harry close, and in a split second he’s splayed out, his wrists tied to opposite ends of the headboard. “Harry,” he gasps, but Harry just smirks.
It’s the combination of Harry’s soothing tone, his hot forehead pressed to Draco’s, and the ghosts of a nightmare still lingering that sends Draco into short, gasping sobs.
Harry yells, lining up his cock and slamming into Draco much too fast and hard, but he doesn’t fucking care. Draco sobs sharply, going boneless in Harry’s arms as Harry fucks into him.
“I know what it’s like to run away,” I say softly. I can already see the weight of the choice in the line of Draco’s shoulders. He exhales harshly. “Granted, if you’ve got any units to throw my way for the trouble of harboring a fugitive crown prince, I would not refuse them.”
. When Draco has fully undone one length of rope, he stretches out Harry’s leg, rubbing hard circles into his muscles.
“Oh,” Draco says, lost for words. Harry and him, hot and cold. Fire and ice. Rather poetic, if Draco thinks about it, so he won’t.
“Draco,” I say, my tone dropping into sincerity. He stops laughing but a smile still plays around the edge of his lips, and I kiss his knuckles.
“Why would you think that?” Draco asks belatedly, his voice thinner than he intends. “Harry, why would you think that?”
There’s a familiar warmth as lubrication and just-in-case contraception spells wash over Draco’s cock and his mouth drops open of its own accord, because this is what they do when–
to tell you,” Draco says, gently guiding Harry back towards his cock. Harry goes willingly, looking up through his lashes at Draco. “The same way you want to tell me I’m pretty.”
“How much time do I have to fix this.”
Immediately Harry is frozen, hot panic spilling through his chest. He’s been with Draco over a year and sure, things aren’t always perfect, but that’s normal; overall he feels like this is right and good and where he’s supposed to be, and if Draco breaks up with him now Harry won’t get to stick his cold toes underneath Draco’s thighs on the couch anymore and fuck he can’t
“Maybe,” he replies, and I look over in time to catch a soft smile on his face, incongruous with the brightly confident grins he’s been throwing my way since we met. “Do you want to borrow some pajamas?”
“Tell me,” Draco says into Harry’s hair. “Please fucking
Harry shifts, his free hand finding Draco’s, sliding his other hand away from Draco’s neck. The shape of his body is imprinted on the edge of Draco’s vision, a wavering marker that this is real, that Harry is here. Here, in between Draco’s soft sheets.
Harry sees red. Before he knows what he’s doing, his hands are fisted in Draco’s silk pajama top so tightly that his knuckles ache. He shoves Draco against the dresser, and Draco throws his arms out, scrabbling for purchase on the wood.
Hermione looks away from him, her lips pressed thin. “I was just wondering.”
“Sometimes you say words and I assume they have a meaning to
“Why are you here, Draco?” Harry asks, close enough now that Draco can smell him. Sharp and clean, like a fresh cut pine tree.
“What?”
“Colour now?”
“Yeah, yeah.” Draco’s cock is aching, trapped between their bodies, and he can feel his orgasm building low in his stomach, just out of reach. “I need to touch myself, I–”
Laid out like this, in a photograph worn thin by over a year of Harry’s longing, you see so easily what you couldn’t up close.
I’m dying
“Effects?” he asks, his voice smaller than he means it to be, and then he feels Harry’s shoulder press against his. It’s warm and familiar, like breaks spent in cozy coffee shops and grudging pub nights once they stopped screaming at each other, and Draco relaxes minutely. “What are the effects?”
“No,” Draco gasps, even as he spreads his legs wider. Harry pulls almost fully out then thrusts back in, picking up a hard pace that shoves Draco down into the sheets. “Oh
,” Draco says, but she’s laughing.
In a flash of clarity, Harry realizes he’s going to fuck Draco. He’s never done this before, and he hates Draco, with his sharp smirk and his fucking Dark Mark and his lack of guilt, but nothing has ever felt the way Draco’s throat does underneath Harry’s hands.
“Here,” Harry says, shoving a sobering potion into Draco’s hand. Draco blinks, wondering if he
Draco hums around his toothbrush, meeting Harry’s eyes in the mirror before looking back at his own reflection. He needs a haircut, he thinks vaguely. Pale locks of hair are curling up under his ears, and that’s usually the indicator.
at me, his gaze darting over my body before coming back up to my face.
“You want– you want?” Draco is breathless, staring wide-eyed up at Harry. “You feel– the same?”
Harry doesn’t drop it. He just stands, open mouthed, until Draco is close enough to see his individual wind-tossed curls, and then Harry throws up a hand as though on instinct. Draco slams into an invisible wall that gives slightly under his weight, then pushes him back.
– back on. I stumble for a moment, my heavy bones foreign to me, but then Harry is on me, his mouth hot against the hollow of my throat as he moves us back toward the sleeping quarters. Before he can get me down into the bunk I pull away slightly and smirk down at him.
“But–”
“Saturdays are when we usually go out with friends,” Harry says, “but really you don’t need to–”
, I don’t know. If you don’t feel the same, obviously I’ll respect that, we only have two days to reach Catchpole anyways and then you don’t need to have anything to do with me after–”
“Can I kiss you… again? Is that something we’re doing now–”
,” Draco wails. Harry pins his wrists down into the mattress, watching the way Draco’s pupils dilate even as he fights. It was Draco who asked for it like this before they even made it to their room tonight, but Harry will always put his safety first, and he holds the word
, Harry!”
“Baby,” Harry says, and Draco’s lashes flutter. He’s kneeling on the floor, naked, perfectly poised the way Harry asked him to be: back straight, shoulders held proud. It’s a gift, this surrender, and they both know it. The black ribbon tie of the gag hangs in a large bow, trailing down the nape of Draco’s neck. Harry stands to the side, and at his soft endearment Draco straightens even more.
“No, you don’t,” Harry says sweetly before biting down onto Draco’s shoulder, hard enough that Draco’s entire body jerks. “I know you can come untouched for me.”
“You’re a bit of a brat, did you know?” Harry has that crooked smile back on his face, like they’re both in on something.
“You– ow,
It’s soothing.

“I’m here.” With a flick of his fingers Harry turns down the lights entirely, throwing the room into darkness. Draco’s breath is damp on his collarbone and he presses a kiss to the soft strands of Draco’s hair. “Just… stay.”
“People will just come because of my name,” Harry says, dropping his head down into his hands. Draco cranes his head around, and Harry startles into laughter when he blinks his eyes open and sees Draco’s convoluted position.
,” Harry replies emphatically, and Draco starts.
“I’m starting to think you don’t really,” Harry replies dryly, and Draco shoves him to the ground and kisses him. It’s hard and deep and so mind-numbingly miraculous and– and–
“Like a pretty ghost, though. The prettiest.”
“Harry–”
of Hary’s mouth is what does it. Draco comes with a distant shout, his cock pulsing in between the slide of their stomachs, his vision going black around the edges. When he blinks his eyes open, not realizing he had closed them, Harry’s face fills his vision.
“Call him. Or write him, or whatever your posh arse does.”
“And? You like it.”
When Harry pushes himself all the way in, Draco starts crying.
“I rarely know how to think, when it comes to you,” Draco says automatically, and Harry laughs, sharply delighted.
wanting this is overwhelming, when Draco has forced himself to believe that Harry is simply good at pretending.
“What if it doesn’t work?”
“You may use your hands,” Harry says as he stands up, positioning his aching cock right in front of Draco’s face and conjuring lube. “Only your hands. Don’t move otherwise.”
“Fuck that. You’re going to throw away three years of, of
“Is it working?”
“Hey,” Harry says, and there it is– that warmth in his voice that means he’s trying not to smile. “
All of Draco’s guilt is washed away when Harry shows up in the middle of a Tuesday, Draco’s day off, with his green eyes completely glassy.
He cocks his head just right. It isn’t. It shouldn’t be. It can’t be. Take a step back, then another.
“Draco,” Harry interrupts, his voice low and amused. “Look at me. Do you think I’m not enjoying myself?” The insistent thrust of his fingers stops and he simply holds them inside me, giving me a chance to catch my breath and open my eyes to look up at him; I don’t remember closing them. My vision is consumed by Harry, his body eclipsing the lights and his smile impossibly bright. I loosen my fingers and run my hands through his wild hair, taking in the deep flush on his cheeks along with the way his chest moves as he breathes. I trail my fingertips along the scars on his chest and he shivers before pressing a kiss to my forehead, then my temple. “I know you can’t see it, but I’m so hard right now. Taking you apart turns me on, baby. I am absolutely enjoying myself.”
“Hey,” Harry murmurs, pulling away from me after what could’ve been seconds or hours. Our foreheads rest together, and I still can’t see Harry in the darkness, just stars, but I can feel every line of his body under my hands. “I’m–” He huffs a soft, small laugh, nearly incredulous. “Hi.”
and meaning
“How long do you think until I can get you to drop the savior complex?” Harry sticks out his tongue, and Draco laughs– really laughs, harder and louder than before. He trails off with a little snort, and Harry can’t believe he’s never made Draco laugh like that before, because he’s going to be chasing that sound every chance he can get.
Harry’s eyes are impossible to look at, but even more impossible to break away from. “What are you afraid of, Draco?”
“Come on, then.” Harry kisses Draco’s temple, seeing straight through his husband's sarcasm to the genuine need for comfort underneath. “I guess you can come with me to the bathroom then. But the journey will be
“A pie?” Harry asks, startled, and Draco nods grimly, as though going into battle.
Sharp cheekbones.
Harry shrugs. “I’m back in London permanently. And that was the best sex I’ve ever had. I wouldn’t be opposed to getting you in my bed again.”
Harry grabs another napkin. “Yep.”
They’re not quite friends, certainly not enemies. They’re roommates. Civil to each other.
“Okay,” Harry whispers. “Okay.”
make me feel like I’m safe. And so does this. But we don’t have to–”
“I have a topical potion for bruises,” Harry says softly. “Let me go grab it, okay?” He starts to move away but Draco grabs his wrist, his eyes suddenly wild and panicked.
“Harry,” Draco pants, his vision blurry with panic. “Harry. Harry, stop. Stop. Please.”
“Yeah, because you looking at me and saying
“Nope.” Draco reaches out to intercept him, wrapping his hands around Harry’s shoulders. “Robes off.” Harry makes a tiny, devastated sound in his throat and Draco presses a kiss to his cheek as he undoes the line of buttons. “I know, I know. You’ll be asleep again soon, I promise.” He strips Harry down to his pants before tugging the jumper over Harry’s head, dark curls emerging frizzy from the opening and then Harry’s dear face, glasses askew on his nose.

An image flashes in my mind: a poster I saw two days ago at the port in Xanthrea.
“Oh.” Draco blinks rapidly. “
at him in so long, and Harry Potter doesn’t look anything like the scrawny, war-torn boy who testified for Draco four years ago. No, he’s a man now, a head taller than Draco– though that isn’t hard to manage, thanks to the fact that Draco hit his current height somewhere around fourth year– and built like he could throw people around if he really wanted to. But his hands, while insistent, were gentle on Draco’s hips.
Draco has been hard for what feels like hours.
“I wish that would stop being awkward,” Harry grumbles, and Draco snorts softly without responding. The fluorescent light of the motel sign flickers pink over his pale face as Harry parks the car in front of their room. For a moment, Draco looks ethereal, cut from glass. But then he smiles tentatively and he’s just Draco again, wearing one of Harry’s shirts and looking rumpled from a day in the car. Harry blinks, shaking off his thoughts.
“No. No.”
Draco’s heart cracks, right down the middle. Harry continues.
“What the
This makes Draco laugh, a little choked sound; if only Harry knew. If only Harry

“Ah, fuck,” Draco hisses. “Fucking
“I’ve been calling you Harry.” Malfoy’s fingers come up underneath Harry’s hair, ghosting along the nape of her neck.

kiss his shoulder, soft at first and then hard, the kind of kisses that bruise.
“Draco,” Harry starts, unsure what he’s trying to say. “Draco, I…” He trails off as Draco’s hand slides underneath his, delicately pulling it away from the steering wheel. Harry adjusts to drive one-handed, the clammy fingers of his free hand tangled up in Draco’s.
So he’s going to fix Draco’s room.
“Bullshit.” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand. “Stop pretending like I don’t know you.”
A leyline.
. There’s a well in Draco’s heart, with Harry pressed between every brick, and Draco has yet to find the bottom.
For a wild moment Draco wants to laugh at Harry’s politeness while on the brink of orgasm, but then he nods. Harry says something inaudible and the invisible band around Draco’s cock
“I assume that’s why you took me home.”
and went public. Throughout the flurry of the media, the glares and doubt of classmates, Harry could count on Draco underneath him, bound, grinning sharp and soft all at once.
“I want you,” Harry says simply. Draco trembles faintly. “Seeing you once a week, and just for this, isn’t enough, I want to be in your
Harry nods, following Draco back out to the living room. That’s one of the reasons Draco is moving in– he barely has time to take care of himself with his hectic job. He’s certainly complained to Harry about it enough on multiple occasions. With Harry not working at all, though, and Draco’s flatmate leaving at the end of their lease, it just made sense for them to move in together. Harry has realized that while he can afford to live alone, he doesn’t prefer it, and he’s more than up to taking care of stuff around the flat while Draco works overtime just trying to get his articles written.
“Maybe I’d like that,” he replies, and before I can come up with something snippy to say back he’s angling the head of his dick into me and I can’t think at all.

“Now you may get in bed,” Draco says, and Harry sways toward him, resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder.
Silence.
“From the things I want.” Harry is panting, his breath warm on Draco’s chin. “Yes, I want to be friends, but I also want– I also want–” Harry breaks off to pepper kisses over Draco’s jaw and cheeks, not stopping until Draco is wiggling underneath him, trying not to giggle manically. It isn’t fair, because he’s
Draco had expected to be neutral about it, at best.
Draco’s eyes go narrow and cruel. “I have scars that would suggest otherwise.”
Draco shrugs, his eyes brightening again. “What did our favorite unemployed hero do today, hm?”
on Sundays,” Harry counters, and Draco narrows his eyes, staring at Harry. Harry blinks back, and eventually Draco exhales dramatically.
Draco sinks down onto the couch, close enough to feel the reassuring warmth of Harry’s body. One of Draco’s jumpers, a thick red one, hangs low over Harry’s collarbone. “Hey. It’s alright, okay? It’s alright to let me take care of you.”
“Harry, I can’t really… do that.”
“But I
drunk, because he hadn’t even noticed Harry reach for his wand. “And thanks. They’re mine.”
Three days of trying to fill the hours, thanks to Niels telling them in her stern voice not to come into work because she can’t have them getting separated and harming themselves. Three days of watching old movies on the couch, sitting on opposite sides with their bare feet overlapping. Three days of furiously strong Muffliato’s in the loo and hot embarrassment while holding hands around the shower curtain. Three days of Draco learning Harry is nearly impossible to wake up, that he likes his toast burnt, that he smiles at the tiniest things.
With a sigh, Harry rolls onto his back, trying to blink away whatever this is. Whatever their magic, tangled and invisible between them, is making him feel. The Healer at St. Mungo’s told them it was only their magic that’s bound together, not their minds or their wills. But there’s no other explanation for the emotions that threaten to cave Harry’s chest in every time he so much as glances at Draco out of the corner of his eye.
“Where are you?” Draco mutters to himself as he pulls out his map, marking down a small dot at Harry’s current coordinates. Out in the middle of nowhere, then. Nothing new there.
“I told you to
Morning sun spills through the bent window shades, gold across Draco’s sleeping face. Harry gazes at him, then looks away, then back again. The curve of Draco’s eyelashes seems unreal, something out of a fairy tale.

Harry makes a face, sticking his tongue out. “Bleh, that’s early.”
“What about,
“Don’t you like apple pies?”
“Joshua, just let him–”
“We’ll figure it out,” Harry murmurs once they’re settled, his hand burning hot on the skin above Draco’s waistband, under Draco’s rucked up shirt. “I know you don’t want– we’ll figure it out,” he repeats, and Draco slips into sleep before he can parse what Harry stopped himself from saying.
Harry’s mouth drops open slightly at the lowered pitch of Draco’s tone. Draco smirks at him, and Harry shivers minutely.
s that eventually break off into gasps. Now, though, something too big to name prompts him to keep talking.
“You–” Harry starts, his voice tight. He kicks at a rock on the pavement, sending it skittering down the alley. “You’re hard to find.”
“I’d rather not be wearing your pants right now, I’ve decided,” Draco says primly, the frankly sinful roll of his hips undermining his tone. I can feel a patch of wetness against the material of the harness as he moves, and I see the moment he notices it too– his gaze goes sharp and heavy. “Enjoying yourself?”
, baby, fuck–” Harry cuts himself off as Draco hums around his cock while trying to keep his eyes on Harry’s face. Already Draco can feel the slick smeared across his chin, messy and intoxicating and
“I made a mistake,” Draco whispers, and Harry goes still.
“You spoil me too much,” Harry protests, but lets himself be pulled up off the sofa and into Draco’s arms.
“How much distance?” Draco asks, trying not to sound strained because, if he has to be near Harry
“Draco–”
“Dance with me,” I say, threading my fingers through his. He lets me, extricating one hand to grab onto my upper arm.
I didn’t mean
Draco can’t get to Harry’s skin fast enough– he has Harry stripped to his boxers and flat on the couch as quickly as he can ask for consent. Harry laughs, fumbling with Draco’s fussy turtleneck until he manages to get it off. He simply raises his eyebrows at the curved scars under Draco’s nipples, paying much more attention to the long silvery ones that run diagonal on Draco’s chest, but Draco doesn’t have time for guilt; he presses his mouth down to Harry’s nipple, marveling at the moan the action elicits. Draco presses wet kisses lower, down the thick trail of hair under Harry’s navel, pausing to ask permission before pulling Harry’s boxers down. His throat goes dry at the sight of Harry, sprawled and golden and beautiful, so he takes his time with his mouth and his hands until Harry shakes hard, crying out Draco’s name. His fingers are buried in Draco’s hair, and he tugs up gently, kissing Draco hard even as come trails out of the corner of Draco’s mouth.
“Draco?” Harry murmurs when she opens it, staring at Draco where she stands pale and trembling in her white nightgown. “Are you alright?”
.” Draco exhales roughly as Harry tugs on the plug infinitesimally, his other hand still wrapped around Draco’s cock. At his silence, Harry stops moving.
“Did you touch the socket?” Harry asks, and Draco’s eyes dart to the wall. He points.
as Pansy sets her fork down just to smirk at him, her red lipstick bright against her teeth. “You really can’t stop thinking about arses, can you?”
Draco trails off as he meets Hermione’s weary eyes. Her curls are falling around her shoulders, the flyways lit up by the weak sunlight spilling into the small courtyard they’re standing in. After a quiet moment, he offers her the hair tie on his wrist, and she takes it with a half-smile.
. You’re fucking indescribable. You’re unreal.”

“See something you like?”
Not-Draco is crackling with magic.
Harry laughs and follows Draco through the Floo, trying not to let his thoughts linger on the curve of Draco’s smile. It’s the tiniest crush, that’s all, barely anything, and they’re roommates now.
“You didn’t write me for a year.”
“You beautiful–” Draco’s shirt, gone, “–maddening–” his trousers vanished completely along with his shoes, “absolute
“Hi.”
“Alright, love.” Draco sets the second length of rope to the side, then pets a hand down Harry’s shin.  “Stretch out your legs fully. Mhm, just like that.”
“Please come for me,” Harry says, and Draco opens their eyes, meeting Harry’s gaze. The adoration on their face punches the air right out of Harry’s chest, and he hears a soft
“No,” I reply automatically, the shock of his impulse to apologize for that setting in slowly. “Don’t apologize. It’s– it’s your body, and we’ll go however slow you need to for this to be good.”
– “Big D.”
“What?” I bite out, clenching and unclenching my fingers. Everything in my body feels wobbly, like it’s been rearranged and put back to rights with everything off by a centimeter.
“Draco.” Harry smiles, unable to stop herself. “Draco.”
“I know–”
“W-was it not cold for you?” Draco asks, his voice trembling as he shivers, the chill slowly moving back to his core before disappearing entirely. Harry’s hand stays on the back of his neck, grounding.
“Shut
“I was talking to–
Harry smirks, the tension easing out of his body. “You’re more than
“Anything. Everything.” Harry hums, running a hand through Draco’s choppy hair, thinking.
Draco’s voice suddenly goes quiet. “It’s alright.”
“Potter,” Draco says, softening his voice as realization dawns. “Harry. You don’t have to martyr yourself all the time. Let me take care of you.”
“Oh god,” Harry chokes out, and Draco grins above him, rolling their hips on Harry’s cock again.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, and Harry doesn’t know who moves first but they’re kissing across the middle console, warm and desperate, and that’s when Harry realizes he can’t feel the bond at all.
“There, darling,” Harry says once they’re situated. Draco blinks against the dim light, soaking in the sight of Harry, sweaty and nearly glowing. His curls are a wreck, fluffy around his ears. “Colour now?”
“I’m ready for you. I’ve been ready for so long,” Draco says, glancing back up at Harry from under his eyelashes. Harry’s stripped off his jeans and pants now, standing naked in the soft light, and

“Draco?” Harry calls, his voice thin. Draco grips onto the edge of his sink, hard enough that his knuckles go white, and when he looks up at his own reflection in the window he understands what this is.
“You– you– oh.” Draco trembles again, bringing his hands up and grabbing Harry’s wrists almost desperately. “Are you– are you sure you do, that you feel– like that, towards
“Sweetheart. Draco, my sweetheart. My darling.”
“Yeah,” Harry says softly.
“What happened?” Harry asks once they’re sitting on the couch, Draco safely wrapped in a blanket he insisted he didn’t need and a mug of tea Harry forced into his hands. He isn’t looking at Harry, gazing instead at the muted telly. The scene is familiar: Draco curled up at the other end of the couch the way he does every week for their movie nights, watching obscure films that none of the rest of their friends care about. Now, though, the normally comforting sight is shattered by the mottled purple of Draco’s skin.
Draco hums, taking another drag. In his periphery, Harry is nearly crackling with energy, wearing that infernally attractive leather jacket and dark jeans. His curls are short, spilling right over his forehead, vastly different from the shoulder length ringlets Draco used to sink his fingers into.
“Harry,” I start, but he cuts me off.
“We should,” Draco says, stifling a yawn. Without looking over, Harry offers his hand palm-up over the center console.
Draco drops his hand fully out of Harry’s, expecting something terrible to happen.
On paper, they’re roommates.
“No.” A muscle jumps in Harry's clenched jaw, and Draco is struck with the realization that Harry is physically holding himself back. “I need you to tell me you understand that if you need me to stop or slow down, I will.”
Beside me, Draco wheezes out a laugh and turns to face me, not letting our bodies touch. His cheeks are still so pink with arousal, and probably happiness. I tangle our fingers together.
Draco doesn’t deign to answer Harry’s quiet question. As he slides off the bed to fetch his trousers, he wonders vaguely if he needs to go to the store tomorrow. He might be out of milk.
“You don’t,” Harry says helplessly. Draco clenches his hands into fists. Harry doesn’t know what to do with this hollowness in his chest, like all his anger was pulled out of him, leaving behind someone gaping and guilty and craving.
let me, darling please let me, let me do that for you, let me–
was the least scary option to present,” Harry murmurs when they break apart. Draco blinks, dazed.
“Let’s just–” Draco stops, then starts to pull off his jumper. Harry takes his cue and undresses Draco the rest of the way, then sheds his own clothing quickly. By the time he gets back on the bed Draco is splayed out, pale and beautiful, his eyes already closed. Harry asks to touch, like he always does. Draco nods his consent, clearly trying to keep his expression blank but failing when Harry slides a finger in and brushes against his prostate.
“And we’ll still probably get on each other nerves–”
“Okay,” Harry says soothingly. In the wake of Draco’s panic he’s feeling much calmer, knowing they’ve both been unsettled even though for different reasons. “Okay, okay. We’re not breaking up and we’re moving in together. Anything I missed?”
.” Draco loves him like this, in the moment that Harry collects himself and takes charge without losing his intensity.
“You know, years ago I wouldn’t have slept until I could figure out what’s wrong, but now I barely have the energy to take care of a one-year-old,” Hermione says, gazing unseeingly down at the ground. Her voice is very quiet. “I don’t know how to help Harry if he won’t
This is real.

Harry is probably fine. He hasn’t come to see Draco at all since they had dinner.
this is about you.”
“Yes.” Of course Harry wouldn’t want to be seen in public holding Draco’s hand. Of course, of course.
“Hah,” Draco huffs, and Harry thinks of his pale body limp in Harry’s arms, his toe barely touching the floor, the way he closed his eyes and
