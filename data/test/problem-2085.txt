He pauses for a few minutes before peering out the small window but can only make out shapes and colors. Nothing too striking is identifiable. Before he can move back, a man opens the door, and he startles at Harry in the way.
Draco blinked again, blearily, as though he were seeing the world for the first time in a long time.
“I’m sure there will be something to do. It’s a university.” Harry grumbled, leading Malfoy out of the Three Broomsticks. “Stop being so negative.”
He slung his bag over his shoulder and stalked away from the group. Harry stood, rubbing at his neck.
“No,” Draco concedes. “Pansy does sometimes. She says that even though we aren’t close, she’s my mother, and she deserves to know if I’m alright.”
“Draco, your definition of openness is skewed,” Harry frowns, and he can’t help but feel slightly irritated. “I never know how you’re feeling, and I don’t understand why you still put yourself through this. Forgive me, if I don’t think you’re the most honest with me while you’re sober.”
“It’s probably best that you see for yourself.” Narcissa stands then as if to say their time together is over.
Harry suddenly felt awkward. Like he'd had a particularly rough one-night stand. Like he didn't know the man in his bed all that well at all. Draco removed himself from the sheets before coming to stand in front of Harry.
The first time Harry arrived at work looking cheerful, Ron had said, “You look like you’ve had sex for breakfast, Harry.”
“So you said.” Harry paused, his mouth hardening into a thin line. “And you require nothing in return for it?”
Harry crosses the room quickly, crawling into bed next to Draco. He’s nervous to do it, but he eventually manoeuvres his way under Draco’s open arm, resting his head on his shoulder. Draco simply accepts it. He doesn’t seem as angry as before, strangely detached from his emotions.
In the beginning of their relationship, Harry would’ve knocked on the bedroom door when he arrived at it. A soft rap of knuckles against wood, just to warn Draco he wasn’t alone. Now, Harry went for the curved handle instinctively, finding his passage blocked by a locked door.
“You did last night,” Harry says, upset, and then he regrets the words instantly. It’s like a mask slams down over Draco’s features. The side of him that was open to listening and understanding what Harry has to say seems to be entirely gone.
“No,” Draco said, his voice distressed in a way that Harry hadn’t heard it be in a while. “I don’t know why we can’t do that when it’s clearly something that would benefit the both of us.”
“Yes, I’m aware of that fact already.” Draco pressed a finger to the space between his eyebrows. “Just tell me you’ll be there?”
Harry had found out later why Draco had visited Luna a few months before. It made sense that he’d go to her, and it made no sense at all that it had somehow travelled back to Harry.
Draco snaps his head around. He’s so well-dressed it almost hurts Harry to see. He’s not sure why or how, but the perfectly tailored trousers and tucked in dress-shirt make him look like some sort of fully-clothed Greek sculpture, and it takes Harry’s breath away.
“Write to me, will you?” Harry asks, though he curses himself for it sounds pleading, and entirely too desperate.
“A film?” Harry’s eyes widened from across the room, but he joined Draco on the couch. “You hate Muggle television.”
He searches through, using his arms to push people gently out of his way, like taking a fine-toothed comb through the crowd and looking for Draco. He doesn’t see anyone he knows before Seamus comes into view.
Harry flinched when Draco simply sat down on the bed next to him, leaning his head into his hands. Harry could tell by the way his shoulders shook gently that Draco was beginning to cry.
“How mature of you, Potter,” Draco says, practically spitting Harry’s name from his tongue. “Always so saintly.”
“So, boys,” Oli smiled, his arm unmoving from Harry’s side. Malfoy scowled harder, “What are you doing ‘round these parts? Not much up here, eh?”
He waved his wand and muttered an incantation. The spell dissipated, and Harry sat back down pleased.
“Close your mouth, Harry.” Draco laughed, but it wasn’t sharp at all. There was colour to it. Light.
You should tend to the garden; Harry had said when they woke up in a tangle of naked and bruised limbs and caught a glimpse of the weather.
“Look how pretty you are,” Harry said, deliriously high off of the sensation and throbbing heat wrapped around him.
Draco gazed at him suspiciously. “You can ask.” He twirled his fork in his fingers thoughtfully but granted Harry a slight smile.
Pain gathered around Draco’s features before he schooled himself back into apathy. He stood from the table, apparently weary from a conversation that was going in circles. “I’ve been thinking about this for a while now, and I think I need to go to Ginny’s tonight. I’ll come for my things tomorrow.”
“Last winter, you had a fever for a week and insisted on coming in to work every single day still! You got
He's rolled the pyjama bottoms far too many times on his waist, and they still hang loosely from his hips, exposing his navel and faint line of translucent hair. Harry tears his eyes away to meet Draco’s, watching him intently.
“I didn’t know you two were together,” he says, feeling acutely as though his presence isn't enough of an obstacle to stop them from jumping each other's bones.
Draco offers a smile, pulling the paper closer to him. “Seems like her soulmate is a woodworker. How romantic.”
Harry considers the question. “It didn’t feel great, at first,” he says, supposing honesty is the best policy when it comes to the two of them.
Harry is taken aback by the query, especially the show of motherliness from a woman he would never have expected it from. It’s a very Molly kind of question. He shakes his head in response but burrows deeper into the soft leather of the sofa.
Draco sobs into Harry’s neck, coming into his hand with a cry. He buries deeper, clawing his fingernails down the length of Harry’s back.
“Draco,” she said, her voice ethereal and dreamlike. She had braided her hair down on one side of her shoulder, and small stars accessorised the length of blonde strands. In her arms, Luna’s silver one-eyed cat, Opal, was curled up. “Come through, if you’d like. I don’t have any company.”
The front garden is cramped at best and feels even more claustrophobic due to overgrown plants, weeds, and flowers that litter the small planter boxes haphazardly interspersed amidst the mossy cobblestone patio.
Once Seamus and Dean had declared a ceasefire, the group migrated to the Great Hall for breakfast. Harry noticed Hermione was nowhere to be found.
“Er -no?” It sounds like a question as he swivels his head back to meet the familiar voice behind him.
Harry looked guilty, but Draco only closed his eyes at the sight. He couldn’t be sure why Harry had tried to take the blame for this, but then again, he always did. The world’s Saviour. Draco’s too.
After chopping away with shears at the bases around some of his plants, Draco decided he was already too tired. Harry stood in the doorway as Draco angled past him smelling of rotting garbage — the lovely scent that characterised his thistles.
“Something’s wrong, Harry,” he said. “There’s a reason why neither of us can control ourselves around each other. There has to be something. Maybe we were cursed or poisoned? Something new, perhaps. I’m surprised I haven’t noticed the signs until now. I was using thistle. It helped me regain control for a moment there.”
He begins down the path and all too quickly arrives at the front door. It opens before he can reach his hand up to knock. A house elf guides him inside and seats him in the formal sitting room. Many people seem to be gathered outside, from what he can see through the window, where the ceremony will take place. Harry wonders why the house elf has guided him here, and he stands from the settee as if a mistake has been made.
It was likely that whoever dosed Pauline suggested that she avoid her sister. Harry didn’t yet know what would happen if a victim was given a direct demand and then attempted to defy it.
His words were like a vice grip on Harry’s throat, choking him until constellations erupted before his eyes.
Harry breaks his gaze from his shoes and looks into her eyes. They are so much like Draco’s; Harry’s heart begins to pound. “I-uh, I appreciate that.” He steadies, finding his voice, owing Draco’s mother the respect of an even tone. “If I could change everything, I would in a heartbeat.”
Harry takes another sip of his drink, even though he knows he probably shouldn’t. He checks his watch, and it’s almost eleven. He’s not sure where the time went.
“— yes, correct. And it’d be pertinent to inform any close family members about his decision whenever you get the chance.”
“She’s an absolute nightmare.” Pansy sighed and then yelped as something clattered against the floor. Ginny must have thrown something. Her usual weapon of choice was a pot lid.
The literary district was home to a surprising number of witches and wizards that lived amongst Muggles. A few restaurants and shops were disillusioned between buildings or in back alleys, but for the most part, the people of this neighbourhood lived integrally. They shopped for groceries as Muggles would, used cell phones rather than owls because it was inconspicuous, and dated Muggles too.
—” Harry’s voice cracked, but he cleared his throat and tried again. “I want to suggest that we give this one last go. That we both focus on making our marriage work, instead of giving up the moment things get hard. We’re capable of that.”
“Harry, I know I just met you, but I love you both,” she grins, pinching Draco’s cheeks. He bats her hands away with fondness.
Draco had never asked Harry about anything Auror related before. It would have been far too risky for the Aurors to have Harry in his position of power if they knew he was running home to tell his Death Eater husband — reformed though he was — the confidential details. So Draco never asked out of kindness and respect. Really, he never wanted to put Harry in an uncomfortable position like that — to choose between a spouse and a career.
After a few hours of mindless chatting, Draco sobers up enough that he and Theo head down to the party. Draco pauses for a moment, tilting his head to see if he’ll follow. Harry’s not really in the mood to follow or deal with any more human interaction for the evening, and Draco simply shrugs and continues out.
“So, what were you saying about medicinal plants again?” Draco had asked, mostly attempting at politeness rather than chasing any inkling of curiosity.
“If I worried every time one of us left planet Earth for a little too long, I’m not sure I’d ever be happy,” Draco chuckles, though he seems cheerless and resigned to the reality of such a statement.
“Hi there.” Harry closed the book, making his presence in the sitting room known. The novel was called
Recognising Pansy’s loopy handwriting, he placed it gingerly on a stack of unopened letters by the trellis. He didn’t have time to explain their relationship to their acquaintances anymore.
Draco turned the thought over in his head a few times before fiddling with his fingers — a stupid habit he’d picked up from Harry.
Claude emerges from behind the sofa, jumping up gently into Harry’s lap. He’s usually not very affectionate unless he’s demanding food or scratches, but he seems to sense how Harry is feeling. He leans forward, nuzzling his head against Harry’s belly.
“I’m going to make you mine.” The man spoke with forcefulness in his voice. One that indicated he didn’t take kindly to spurned advances.
“I don’t have the time for this. It’s easy enough for me to turn you over to Dementors. In fact, I’d take some pleasure in doing so. You’ll likely forget all about me when you’re a lifeless shell of your own body, rotting in Azkaban with the rest,” Harry spat. He felt something inside of him turn cruel and biting, and he rode the intensity of his emotions with a vengeance. “All you’ll be is a pile of bones.”
Something felt terribly and irrefutably wrong, but he just couldn’t put a finger on it. Usually he was quite good at parsing out right from wrong, normal from abnormal. But what felt like an underlying sense of unsettlement was only growing as he Apparated to Diagon Alley.
Harry choked back a sob, removing his glasses to rub at his eyes before putting them back on again. Draco came into view more clearly, but even the slightest bit of sadness from before had left his features. He was confident in his resolve.
“Nothing,” he said automatically. He’d gotten used to Ginny badgering him about his marriage at every turn, hoping to extract nothing short of a confession. Draco had grown to dodging her quite well, but Odessa was harder to fool.
“This would happen to us,” Harry shouts above the noise. He looks around to his friends, joy in their faces, soaked wet down to their boots.
They stepped out into the garden, and Harry didn’t miss the speed at which Draco plastered on a smile. They made their way back to the tables, where Draco pointedly left his side. Harry told Ginny she should handle the cake instead of him and waved off her concerns.
Draco flushes, scuffing his shoe gently against the ground. He doesn’t respond, but he threads an arm through Harry’s own, and around his waist.
A pained look crosses Draco’s features, and he pulls his knees up to his chest in a way that reminds Harry of how he used to curl up on his bed as a child.
“I haven’t ever seen you at Draco’s,” she remarks, stroking fingers through Dean’s hair as he dozes quietly.
“Yeah, I didn’t have much to do today.” Harry shrugged off his shirt, and Draco let himself admire his husband’s toned figure. Harry wasn’t quite as wiry and small as he had been at Hogwarts. Years of Auror training and fieldwork had turned his body strong and capable. Draco felt a blush creep upon his face, though Harry didn’t seem to take notice. He continued stripping off his clothing, presumably to prepare for a shower.
“But it’s not like I have to do it right now,” Harry says, taking off his glasses and rubbing at his eyes uncomfortably. It’s still far too early in the morning for him to be thinking straight, let alone doing this. He’s been holding off for almost a year now, and really had no intention of ever coming in.
“This might sting,” he warns. He tips the bottle of dittany onto his finger, dabbing it gently over the area of Draco’s cut.
“It wasn’t Harry,” Draco lied, automatically defensive, then surprised that his mind hadn’t pushed him to say it.
Lyra had brought in the paper, which lay untouched on the countertop. Draco filled a glass of water for himself and nabbed a few plums from the fruit bowl. He settled at the table with his afternoon snack and opened the
“You know, when I came here, I expected a cup of tea and some biscuits.” Ron groaned, but followed Harry’s lead, cutting away at anything and everything.
“He’s hurt. I know you were hurting too, and that’s why you did what you did, but we must think about what this is like for him as well.”
Harry still had the sense to hold his tongue, as Zabini and Parkinson loomed behind him. He didn’t need three Slytherins on his back, let alone one.
He can see only a few feet in front of him; glasses plucked from his face by the insistent, inquisitive fingers of the wind. It doesn’t help that he can’t Apparate. He’s too tired and too scared to make much sense of anything at all.
They leave slowly and almost involuntarily, but Harry doesn’t blame them. He knows that if Ron or Hermione were in this situation, he would sacrifice anything in the world to make sure they were going to be okay. He glances at the clock, realising it’s already three in the morning. He’s not sure he’ll be able to actually get any sleep, but he doesn’t really want to. If he falls asleep and something happens to Draco in the nighttime, Harry would never know and would never forgive himself for it.
“She didn’t necessarily tell me to come over,” Ron said, after a moment of silence. Only a small bit of shame creeped into his voice. “You know I always enjoy hanging out with you. Just the two of us.”
Harry cleared his throat and stepped away from the window. He knocked it closed with the back of his elbow, sending a sharp numbness reverberating down the length of his arm. Something about pain was so comforting and familiar. “Come in!”
“Oh, please.” Pansy laughs lightly, before leaning forward to press a soft and gentle kiss to his lips. “At this point, what’s mine is yours.”
“Draco,” he repeats, words foreign and acidic against his tongue as it touches the roof of his mouth.
Ethel frowns for a moment before schooling her expression back into professionalism. Still, she hesitates for a moment too long, and Harry takes notice. “All wizards have unique cores,” she says, but doesn’t offer more than that.
Harry smiles as they enter the Ministry lobby. He’s not even thinking about the camera flash when he pulls Draco close and pecks him right on the mouth.
Draco had only received a year of house arrest, while Narcissa had been given five. Lucius, deemed mentally unfit for Azkaban, was to be given care at home to serve out a sentence of fifteen years. Harry hates that he knows Lucius is in the house somewhere, probably bed-ridden, unable to speak, but still there.
Harry felt Oli’s grip drop slowly, and purposefully, to his waist. He swallowed, hoping he wasn’t displaying nervousness so obviously on his face though it certainly felt like it. As Harry walked, pressed closed to Oli’s side, he could practically feel eyes boring into the back of his head. He flushed at the thought of Malfoy seeing him in a compromising position like this.
Harry was glad they had walked away when they did, because he could feel the warmth of a blush creeping upon his cheeks. He stood with his back toward the stone for minutes before bolting to the common room to gather his thoughts. The coldness from the walls slowed his pulse, if only marginally. He was threatening to bubble over like Goyle’s cauldron had in class, but he was relieved to have held it together. If Malfoy saw him turning as red as a cherry, Harry would never hear the end of it.
Harry’s head snapped in the other direction and saw Hermione tugging at Ron’s robes. Draco scrambled up from the ground and reached for his novel, although it had been clear they had neglected their literature in favor of other activities.
Harry waited for minutes, before drawing his head up to where she finally emerged. From her seat at the countertop, she had looked like a tall woman, but Harry noticed she only made it to well below his shoulders. Somehow that made her more intimidating than before.
Tears fill Draco’s eyes as he comprehends the words, and Harry can tell he’s sober enough to understand what Harry’s getting at.
Harry, without question, wraps the blanket securely over Draco’s shoulders, pulling it tight at his chest. Harry’s chattering teeth begin to slow as he buries his hands further in his pockets. He sits first, and Draco is slow to follow, but they lean back against the wall of the doorway and look together to the faraway skyline of London.
He’s still high as far as Harry can tell, sipping something out of a cup, his head rested lazily back on the wall where he’s leaned up, his jaw slack and open, exposing white teeth. His eyes flit erratically across the crowd, bouncing across objects in the room.
“Go,” Harry said, and there was an authoritative undertone in his voice that made Ron listen. He stood warily from his seat and dropped his portion of the file into Harry’s lap.
“Hm,” Draco hums, using a rolled-up Muggle banknote to do another line off the cover of a book. “It’s probably the drugs.”
“By hurting yourself, you’re hurting me.” Harry frowns, looking down at his hands where his fingers are intertwined with Draco’s. “And I know that's not entirely fair to say, but that's how I feel.”
Pansy returned only moments later, with coffee and promises that they’d be back to visit but Draco really should get some rest because he looked “absolutely terrible.”
“I don’t see why you couldn’t open one,” Harry shrugs. “Life’s too short to not be doing something that you love.”
“That’s not entirely true, Harry, but what’s the harm in that? Wanting to do something for myself for once.”
It was clear that Harry rode the final waves of intoxication, stumbling over himself as he extracted a limb from between Draco’s back and the brick wall.
“He was only a boy. Just like you.” Snape spoke, softer than before. Softer than Harry had ever heard the man speak.
A waitress looked down at him from a pair of obscenely high heels. She smelled distinctly of alcohol and other people.
“Does she now?” Draco asked, incredulous. Only Harry would treat Muggle garden tools like sentient beings. The thought of it was charming, but Draco pushed the predilection from his mind as quickly as it came.
“Yes, he is. I haven’t spoken to him since the trial.” Narcissa’s eyes water just a bit, and she averts her gaze, fixating on something on the carpet until they clear.
, but Draco seemed as though he were having a good day, and Harry would be damned if he was going to ruin it.
“I’m sure.” Proudfoot scratched at her head absentmindedly; eyes still focused on the page in front of her. “I’m almost done here anyway, and you’re making my skin itch with all that energy. Please go.”
The seminar had taught him that the next thing to do was rescue breathing. Harry acts without thinking, removing the empty syringe from Draco’s leg. He pumps at Draco’s chest with his hands, breathing as much life as he can back into his open mouth at intervals.
“I’m Draco, and this is Harry,” Malfoy said, pointing at Harry, who had crept up quietly next to him.
“What is it?” Harry asks cautiously. He’s not sure he’s ready to snort anything foreign and somehow fail a Ministry drug test.
“You don’t have to answer,” Harry says after a long while, knowing that he probably wasn’t planning on offering a response anyway.
“I was more concerned with the fact that you’d tortured me unendingly in school, and probably would for the rest of my life,” Harry laughs.
Finding confidence within himself, Harry turned the corner intending to wait outside the entryway until Draco emerged, or maybe even bang on the wall until someone let him in. He had spotted Draco on the Marauder’s Map only moments before leaving the Gryffindor common room and figured he wouldn’t have gone anywhere during that time. Harry had woken too late to notice if he had been to breakfast.
The thought of even going to the Manor sets Harry on edge more than he’d been the entire morning. There’s something still so visceral and raw that he remembers about the place. Too many terrible memories living within its walls.
Harry shivers as his dragonhide boots make imprints in the snow-buried walking path of Malfoy Manor.
“But what does that mean?” Harry was aware he seemed a little crazed, but he wasn’t sure where the bounds of the potion lay. It was clear that the smallest of suggestions made by another would be exacerbated in Draco’s mind to a point of fixation. But would it let the real Draco think for himself even still? If that was the case, then Harry wouldn’t mind using the potion again. Maybe just once. Or twice.
“Sure, but we better make it quick. I don’t know when Draco will be home, and I should get started on setting up,” Harry said, but they changed direction to the pub anyway.
“Er – we asked no one to be down here.” Ron said, lightly scanning the room. “We just thought it would be easier.”
“Seven minutes late, Potter.” Malfoy scowled, but it lacked bite. Harry refused a reply, instead watching as Malfoy gently tickled the pear with his wand and let it transform into a sturdy green door handle. Harry was a bit annoyed that Malfoy knew how to get into the kitchens, but he supposed it made sense. Malfoy seemed to know just about everything.
Harry’s mind goaded him, encouraging a behavior he would never dare in any other moment but this one.
“So,” Draco said awkwardly, adjusting himself on the sofa. “I have a small predicament. Well, I’m not sure if ‘predicament’ is the right word.”
He wasn’t even sure exactly what to say, as he had only just realized that morning how badly he’d messed up. He was afraid Draco wouldn’t forgive him.
Harry is sure he has never heard a violin play before in person, but he knows this is it. The sweet, gentle press of bow against string. It’s a graceful sound. He’s taking Draco’s glasses from the bedside table before he can think, and the frames are a bit tight on his wider set face. At least he can see something now.
“You don’t really get hungry when you’re using, do you?” Harry says carefully, reluctant to venture into dangerous territory.
“Professor McGonagall, I hardly think this is the right... position for me. My knowledge in this area is limited at best. I feel as though my strengths could be utilized in a different field. Perhaps as a teaching assistant in potions, I heard Professor Slughorn was –”
“There’s not much to talk about, is there?” Harry steadied his breathing in his chest and was too cognisant of the uncomfortable press of the vial against his leg.
Harry had offhandedly suggested Draco stop talking to Ginny weeks ago — for his own good, of course. Somehow Harry had turned into the enemy when all he was trying to do was fix an unfixable situation.
“Hey,” Harry said, throwing his bag to the side of the table and collapsing into a chair. The day had exhausted him, and something about Draco’s presence had done so even more.
Harry had been suffocating in an uncomfortable heat since he’d slipped on his Auror robes in the morning, after particularly brutal sex. He wasn’t quite ready to let go of any hint of cold, but it was practically the middle of December. It was only fair that Ron would want some warmth.
. Draco swallowed a breath of air, but Ginny didn’t seem to notice. She directed the last piece of the croissant into her mouth and paged through a magazine at the coffee table.
Draco frowned. “Not exactly. I was thinking of something more along the lines of a home-cooked dinner and —” He cut himself off abruptly at the look on Harry’s face.
“Fair enough,” Draco said, mentally cataloguing a few bakeries in Diagon Alley. Odessa’s would probably be closed at this hour. “Anything you’d like in particular?”
Draco surveyed him with terror in his eyes that Harry couldn’t place. His fear excited Harry, like the thrill of a fresh kill on a particularly strenuous hunt. He knew it was the potion’s effects that were causing such a reaction, and that the interrogation earlier in the day should have been reason enough for him to stop administering it. But something in the back of his mind demanded him not to dare. He listened to it, unflinchingly.
They stood together, but before parting ways, Luna reached her hand out and placed it assuredly on Harry’s shoulder. “He cares about you too, you know. He will show it differently.”
A silence lingered at the table for longer than Harry was comfortable with, and he found himself scrambling to fill the silence.
Draco constantly occupied the room, his body, his existence stuck to every item like he’d clung to it his whole life.
Harry felt his face grow hot at Draco's disrespect. His skin crawled with ghostlike energy, and he felt as angry as he ever had when he was practically pre-pubescent. He'd always had an unmatchable temper.
“I want you,” Draco cries out with no hesitation, pure frustration and lust rendering him almost incoherent. “I want you, now, I can’t—”
Draco doesn’t respond, training his eyes down to a spot on the ground. Harry continues wiping up the blood, until the area looks as clean as it can get.
“I’ll do the dishes,” Harry said, feeling like the repetitive and comforting act of cleaning would set even just a few things right.
He found something in his chest growing panicky and restless, but resolved to take a few breaths and calm down. Reacting like he had in his office wouldn’t be prudent, especially if he was suffering from some temporary illness or hex.
Draco’s newfound confidence only bolstered Carrow’s own. He grinned widely at the sudden provocation.
eager to give old Sluggy my potions,” Malfoy murmured, and Harry grew angrier. “I offer you my sincerest apologies.”
“Too often,” Theo grumbles. “It’s like she and Draco are trying to break some sort of world record for longest sleepover. It’s sickening, if you ask me.”
Draco found himself growing hot and uncomfortable in his clothing. Harry assisted him in removing his athletic shorts with just the movement of one hand.
Draco scoffs. “You might feel like it, but I can guarantee you that whatever Seamus put in that punch will have you loopy all evening.”
“Oh, an Auror,” Draco says, drawing out the last syllable and rolling it out around on his tongue. “You won’t arrest us for this right?”
“Okay, fuck, yes, stay home with me, please,” he whined and hated how he sounded like a child. But the pain cleared away abruptly, and the relief that followed was practically symphonic.
Harry closed the door quietly behind him, setting his briefcase down by the door. Draco would probably be in the bedroom as he usually was during the evenings. He’d need to be coaxed out of the tangle of sheets for dinner, but Harry would do it because he loved him.
“Do you think if you weren’t high right now we’d be having a normal conversation?” Harry asks, countering Draco’s question with one of his own.
Malfoy seemed even paler than before, if that were possible, but extracted his wand from his pocket anyway. He transfigured his robes into precisely what Harry was wearing. Harry wanted to laugh, but it made sense. He had no frame of reference for something else to wear that would pass for Muggle clothing.
“You’re pretty drunk,” Draco supplied, hoping it would let up some tension between them. He wasn’t sure how he could be so calm about it, but the thistle’s success had saved him. That was reason enough for his mind to be elsewhere.
“You can’t be here!” she hisses in a tone strikingly similar to Hermione’s from earlier. “Draco can’t
A few hours later, Ron left, and Harry hadn’t really told him what was wrong. It went like that often. People entered his home and prodded around like they had any business being there at all, and then left. They dipped their toes into water that Harry was already drowning in.
Draco’s heart clenched when he realised the silver band was their wedding ring. Old habits die hard.
Momentarily Malfoy looked a bit like his old self, less business-like and more perpetually irritated. It eased Harry’s mind to see something familiar again.
“Care for a read?” she asks, smiling at Harry. She very decidedly chooses to ignore Draco’s presence.
They continued breakfast primarily in silence while Draco wrote a note for Lyra to take to Gringotts on his behalf. He then wrote another one for Ginny.
The most startling occurrence of the past two weeks had hardly been the revelation of his soulmate as Malfoy, but the reactions that both Ron and Ginny had expressed after he’d told them and sworn them to secrecy.
He considered it for a second but shoved the idea away. If Draco was to spend even a moment alone with the thoughts inside of his head, he might truly go mad after all.
It’s only a few moments later that Draco is saying, “I want you,” wrecked and pliant against Harry’s tongue.
“You talk to each other like you’re always annoyed,” Harry explains. He can always count on himself for an ever-present, and poorly-timed sense of honesty.
The unease fades as Harry slips an arm around Draco’s waist, pulling him close and planting a kiss to his forehead.
Draco startled, but hadn’t seemed surprised. Harry’s outbursts of anger were few and far between, but they still were a familiar fixture of their household when they did come.
Draco allowed his hands to be pinned above his head as Harry kissed down his chest. And then he reached for the buttons.
“What would you have done in there if I hadn’t intervened?” Harry asked, eyes hungry and demanding, something like Carrow’s.
Harry kissed him then, a rough and uncomfortable press of lips that left Draco struggling for air. There was no care or intimacy in the action. Rather, an awful tension. Harry’s mouth moved to his jaw, sucking at the exposed space fiercely. Teeth just a little too sharp on the skin of Draco’s neck.
“So what does this mean, then?” Harry had asked, incredulous. “Is he going to be like this forever?”
In the beginning, he would have fought it, and sometimes it would have worked. Harry would tell him not to see Ginny or that he should take his shirt off during sex, and Draco would fight the swarm of angry bees away as though they would hurt him if they came too close.
Harry finds himself overwhelmed by the need to touch him. To feel his fingers, trace gently along Draco’s bone-white arms, linger around the exposed strip of skin just under his navel, and continue down his legs all the way to his bony, arched feet.
them,” Draco murmured as though he was releasing a closely kept secret into the confines of Luna’s home.
“That was indubitably uncomfortable,” a portrait declares, resting his hands on top of his portly belly. The plaque beneath his frame reads Basil Flack, Minister for Magic in the year 1752.
He climbs down the stairs to what looks like the site of a crime scene. Red cups are strewn across the shag carpet in the sitting room, and various bodies lay positioned on armchairs and sofas passed out from the night of heavy drinking. Seamus is curled up on a disgustingly ornate chaise lounge. Harry feels more hungover after seeing him than he did before. The winter chill outside does nothing for the state of his body either.
“I don’t really know how to bring this up without sounding stupid, so I guess I’ll just do it.” Ron paused, and Harry turned curiously, bringing a cup to the table with him. He slid it across the way to Ron. “Ginny told us what happened last night.”
Mr Marchand winced at his youngest daughter’s name, and something twisted painfully in Harry’s chest. Capucine nodded, though, and Harry continued as his job required.
“For saying that and believing it. For speaking at my trial,” Draco says reluctantly, as though this is the last thing he wants to be discussing. But Harry knows, without a shred of a doubt, that it's earnest.
There were also the deceptive qualities of glamours and Polyjuice to consider. Quite literally, no one in Knockturn could be taken at face value.
“They know?” Draco’s eyes narrow, and Harry feels like, somehow, in the few words they’ve exchanged, he’s misspoken.
“We’re taking quite a while to get the basics of our research completed.” Draco said, “I think we should split up again today.”
Harry shakes his head. “You really don’t need to thank me, I wanted you there. No one should have to spend Christmas alone.”
Harry’s cock was pushing at his entrance now, and he was entirely too intoxicated to just listen. Draco yelped in surprise at the unwelcome press.
Draco stood anyway, making his way to where Harry was standing in front of their laundry bin. His feet moved almost mechanically, without much consent from Draco himself. Harry smelled like sweat and soil, and Draco hated himself for letting it wind him up like this. The feeling in his head wasn’t gone just yet, though, and Draco hesitated before reaching out.
Harry put his pair down. “She asked you here?” He was suddenly less interested in the flowers than he had been all day.
“What are you on?” Harry asks impulsively. His eyes linger on Draco’s cheeks just underneath his hollowed eyes. The skin there looks soft and young, in opposition with how dark the circles are just above.
“And you didn’t notice this earlier?” Draco said, his tone dripping with condescension. Sometimes old habits die hard, and it was challenging not to pick a fight first thing at the breakfast table.
Cherry colored water puddles in the middle of the room, converging around a nearly lifeless body. It would be hard to tell if Malfoy was alive if he wasn’t struggling to inhale with every passing second.
Draco stays silent, now letting out a soft hiss as Harry dabs more dittany onto the wound. It looks better already, less red and angry, and pinker around the edges, as though it’s beginning to heal. He takes out a small vial, made up of a myriad of herbs he’s unfamiliar with, but it’s very clearly labeled “For Cuts.” The Healers at St Mungo’s who created the kits knew what they were doing when it came to Aurors.
He had taken the tube home that day from Russell Square. He had ridden it back and forth down the line, appreciating the kindness of strangers that gave him a small pat on his shoulder and asked him if he was okay as much as the ones who ignored him entirely as though grief were just another part of the day.
“We haven’t any leads on this.” Ron sighed, pushing an overgrown lock of ginger hair away from his eyes. Hermione would ask him to cut it soon, and he would argue otherwise.
Draco gives him a pitying smile. “Someone very wise once told me that my recovery had to be my own, and not anyone else’s.” He squeezes Harry’s hand in his. “She’s eventually going to pull herself out of this, don’t worry.”
“You’re joking.” Draco scrambled, disentangling his legs from the sheets and attempting to stand up. “This is some sick joke. You’re not being serious.”
They continued past the gift store and turned right into a large room full of windows. Greek statues lined the ivory walls, and students sat on stools with sketch pads in their laps.
“I have an hour. Fancy some lunch at the Leaky?” Ginny asked, readjusting bags of decorations on her hip.
Ginny snorted in laughter. “And even apart from the whole sickly pale thing you have going on, you’re just dreadfully skinny. A wizard straight out of the 14th century!”
“We talked. I asked him to try one last time, and he said yes. I’m hoping we can patch things up. There’s really nobody else in the world that either of us wants to be with.”
He pulled himself off the ground, shaking out soaked shirtsleeves as he went. As his spine pressed flat against a shockingly cold brick wall, a shiver careened down his back. The rainwater overwhelming his eyes, concealed tears.
“Unfortunately, I don’t think it is.” Pansy glanced down at her hands. She had grown out of her confrontational demeanour from their school days, and still, she was here defending one of her first friends. Harry knew that he was closer with Pansy now than Draco was, but he supposed it made sense that she’d never stop worrying about his well-being, especially if Ginny was breathing down her shoulders to check-in.
“I’m allowed to do whatever I want. I don’t owe you an explanation,” Harry retorted, almost cattily.
Draco untangled himself from the mess of blankets, rubbing his eyes, heavy with sleep, and stretching out against the bedpost. Lyra gave a hoot of joy as he approached her, scratching the area just under her chin.
“Do you read often?” Harry asks, pushing his glasses up further on his nose from where they’ve slipped down.
He attached the parchment to Lyra’s leg, and she took to the skies immediately after she’d been released. Harry watched her go with a poorly concealed resentment painting his features. Draco wanted to reach out and smack him but was promptly rewarded with a sharp pain in his head.
“I can only assume it’s the work of Pansy,” Blaise says knowingly, reaching a hand up to rap at the door. “She’s too controlling to let Draco or Theo, even, make any proper decisions.”
Cold water snaked in tendrils along the length of Harry’s legs. He couldn’t reward himself with a hot and relaxing shower after what he had done.
Harry separated their cups on the counter, pouring only a touch of milk into his own. He stirred both sugar and milk into Draco's directly, and with a deep breath and shaking hand, tipped in a few drops of the suggestibility potion. The tea morphed from caramel to an ocean blue, before returning to its original state. Harry restrained himself from taking a small sip and prayed it tasted like Draco’s usual, instead of something entirely different.
Harry felt his anger rising up inside of him and stood from the table. Malfoy glanced at him for a moment, likely assuming he was about to leave. Instead, Harry bellowed, “MALFOY IF YOU DON’T TAKE THE CHARM OFF, I’M GOING TO BE REALLY MAD.”
Harry had burned his tongue on black coffee, and hot liquid had scorched down the wrong side of his throat. Ron had smirked at him, just barely holding back an “I knew it” from his lips. Harry had wished he could explain why a happy and largely eventless morning with Draco was infinitely better than sex.
Draco beckoned him closer, and a wave of relief slowly crested through Harry’s chest. He knew Draco would never forgive him, but he also knew he wouldn’t be Harry if he didn’t at least hope for such an outcome.
They both knew that wasn’t necessarily true, as Ron had done the heavy lifting. But the department was reluctant to task Harry with an interesting case. Being a public figure was apparently more important than servicing the general public. Harry hadn't been given a field assignment for longer than he was willing to admit.
Locke smiled, almost comfortingly, and Harry startled at the gesture. “It’s not for me to tell you that you should stop. We both know you won’t.”
Harry realises they’ve forgotten about the mess, and instinctively brings his wand out to clear up the spilt liquid. Harry would’ve missed it if he hadn’t been right next to him, but Draco flinches as Harry casts the Cleaning Spell at the ground.
When Draco had moved to Bloomsbury, he was afraid it was going to be too quiet. Something like the life he’d lived in his lonely cottage with Harry, tending to a garden he hardly cared for and surrounded by so much extra life in his plants that it blinded him from his own.
“I’m not at liberty to discuss it,” Harry says, although the Ministry’s words are the ones spilling from his lips. “Official business.”
“The symptoms he has described are extremely common among those suffering from depression. You told me that he has a hard time taking care of himself, doing the bare minimum. Not to mention that he rarely gets out of bed.” She had shrugged, as though resigned to the diagnosis. “When I spoke to him, he told me that his bed was where he felt the safest.”
Harry swallowed back a hard lump in his throat because Draco couldn’t begin to understand the weight of his own words.
Draco hums in agreement, moving to open the front door once more as some colour returns to his cheeks standing inside.
Instead, Harry bent Draco over the kitchen counter and fucked him like he hated him. There were no exclamations of love or pleasure. Instead, heavy breathing punctuated the silence until they were both finished.
“Harry, I know this isn’t the part of the story I should be focusing on, but you really should not take drug use lightly. What if you get addicted? You know that stuff is banned in the Muggle world for a reason.” She shook her head exasperatedly, putting her hand to her forehead. “That was reckless!”
,” Theo argues, strained. “He’s not supposed to be using anything, if he’s reported they might put him in Azkaban for violating the terms of his parole.”
“This is ridiculous.” Harry felt his voice go high and nasally. It always did when he was uncomfortable. “Let’s go inside. I’ll make you some tea. You can tell me about your day at work —”
Eventually, Harry turns over a few times underneath the covers, willing himself to go to sleep, but thoughts of Draco swarm through his memory. Because as much as he wants this to work, there are overarching reasons why they both know it might not. Draco isn’t defined by his addiction, but it’s certainly a factor to consider. He needs to get better first.
“Mr Marchand,” the man said stiffly and with a heavy French accent. Harry was startled when he spoke.
Draco’s eyes widen at the comment, and he wipes his hands on a dishcloth. “I appreciate that, Harry.”
“I know you’re flawed. I know you used to say terrible things to me and my friends, and act like a complete prat in school, and defend the wrong side. I know who you used to be,” Harry continues. “And I know who you are now. You’re having a hard time dealing with everything, and I still care for you despite it all.”
“He was leaving you last night…” Ron said slowly, processing Harry’s words. “And now he’s not? Just like that?”
The photo on Harry’s desk told a vastly different story, one that terrified him as he saw Draco growing closer to that reality every day.
But Harry was already starting on the first button, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat. A couple of buttons down, and his eyes pricked with tears that he struggled to hold back. At the last button, he just let it out.
They take seats on the far side of the couch, next to where Ron and Charlie are trying to squeeze themselves both into what has been deemed the best armchair in the room.
“Yeah, I just need some rest.” He reached down, cupping Harry’s cheeks with cold hands, and pressed a drawn-out kiss to his forehead before heading inside.
“So good for me, look at you all open and willing,” Harry said. “You’d do anything for me, wouldn’t you? You’d let me do
“Nonsense,” Blaise says. “You’re already having dinner with us; you might as well come with! I won’t stay for too long, I promise. Just haven’t seen the group in a while.”
“I guess I could have. But this seems more like it’s for Malfoy’s benefit than it is for mine. Probably something about house unity and all that.” He waved a hand around lazily.
Harry watched the clock, nibbling at the edge of a self-inking quill, as the hand struck eight. The workday had run a bit longer than usual, but Proudfoot had promised him a hard stop hours ago, and he deserved to go home for some rest.
Ron allowed Hermione to hold him back, but approached tentatively, his eyes widening as he grew closer.
It was half-past four in the morning when the sound of an alarm shook Harry from sleep. His eyes opened but were unable to make out anything in particular. Indistinct shapes characterised the bedroom. He reached for his glasses on the nightstand, allowing his fingers to search haphazardly for the clink of familiar wires knocking into a cup of water. When located, he eased them on.
“They don’t taste great, do they?” Draco asked, grimacing at the object between his fingers. He sniffed at it tentatively, “doesn’t smell great either.”
Ron’s gaze hardens. “Come on, be reasonable. I hate him, too, but realistically it makes sense that he wouldn’t have just asked you over.”
Harry Apparates home, knowing that he’ll be back to the mysterious castle, if anything, to hear Draco play just one more time.
“Is it supposed to look like that?” Harry asks through gritted teeth. His body feels a bit uneasy, even with just that small portion of his magical core removed.
“You are, though, on some level.” Ron grumbled. He was standing next to Hermione, who had just emerged from behind Mrs Weasley's quivering frame.
“Please don’t be sorry. This is all my fault.” Harry heaved him up easily into his arms, guiding them to the bedroom where he laid Draco out on the bed.
It feels strange that Draco Malfoy would be throwing a party in his home, and that Seamus would be in attendance. As Harry gets further inside, he is surprised to see various familiar faces: the Patil twins chug something from red cups in the corner, both of their arms hooked around, of all people, Astoria Greengrass. Lavender and Dean sit hazy-eyed, tucked up next to each other on the couch, enraptured by Millicent fucking Bulstrode recounting some sort of tale that elicits quite a reaction from her audience. Goyle is kissing Katie Bell on an armchair by the fireplace.
Draco allows a soft moan to escape his lips, but it sounds more like a gasp for air than anything substantial. He lazily opens one eye, and then the other.
“Imperioserum is a highly dangerous substance. It is one of the worst we have seen in Ministry history. It is extremely potent — only a few drops can render a victim entirely controlled by someone else,” Hermione asserted, holding the file close to her chest protectively.
He understood more than anyone the loneliness that came when choice was abundant. It was more suffocating than one might expect.
“We’re in Aberdeen. Well, the University of Aberdeen to be specific.” He looked around at the yard in front of him. It was a little colder here than back in Hogsmeade, where every building was surrounded prudently by warming charms. Students scurried down pathways in oversized coats and scarves. Harry realized what they were wearing and promptly transfigured their robes into their Muggle outfits from the museum trip. Malfoy grimaced at the sweatshirt, tugging at the substantial center pocket.
Harry switched their butterbeer in a flash, sipping at Malfoy’s contentedly. The Slytherin reached his arm around to snatch the mug back, but Harry’s reflexes were always a tad quicker.
“I don’t want to be stuck in the house all day without anyone. It’s not good for me, surely you can understand that.”
Draco wiped at his eyes hastily, holding the blanket to his chest like a lifeline. “I couldn’t tell you,” he said because it was technically the truth.
Draco looked down awkwardly at his bedsheets, fixating on a loose thread at the seam. There were a few moments of empty silence.
Harry frowns, looking down at his empty fingers where his wand should be. It has always been, ever since his first day in Ollivander’s, a comfort of some sort.
“Seems like the little bird can speak for himself,” he mused, nodding his head toward Harry, who’s wand was unwavering against Carrow’s cloak. “You’re not needed here.”
“Wish him a happy birthday from me, please. He deserves the world, you know.” She gave Harry a pointed look, and he felt small under her gaze.
A flurry of motion from the periphery of Draco’s vision drew his attention before he realised much of the bar had come to a standstill at their interaction. The waitress backed off into a nondescript corner, and the bartender continued pouring out Firewhisky as though nothing was occurring at all.
“That’s one way to describe it.” Harry shakes his head, passing Draco a glass of water from his nightstand. “Do you remember what happened?”
“I do too,” Harry said, and wondered why they were having a conversation about things they already knew.
So that was why Draco pushed his breakfast around disinterestedly whenever Harry made it. He could have at least said something to spare the trouble.
If Draco were napping, he probably wouldn’t have locked the door. He didn’t do it much anyway at the hands of the potion, which seemed to enjoy giving Harry easy access to the things he owned.
“I won’t look, I promise. I heard all the commotion,” Draco says, focusing on Ron. “We have to do something about this atrocity. What’s happened?”
Harry inclined his head at the figure next to him, adjusting the summer sheets so that they, at least, covered him to his shoulders. Draco would wake up in a better mood because of it.
The couple left soon after dinner with stomachs full of apples, cinnamon, and wine. They exited the cottage with their hands intertwined with each other, and Harry watched them Apparate from just a hair’s length past the fence. He sat down on the steps, giving himself a moment to himself.
Harry found it a little hard to be around everyone, as they still acted so differently around him, but people loved Ron, and he was Ron’s best friend. It scored him points.
He desperately didn’t want to. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to have sex, because his entire body provided evidence to the contrary. But he wanted his shirt firmly attached to his body as it usually was.
“Finish the cup, please, and I’ll check in with you this evening.” She squeezed Draco’s leg and exited as quickly as she’d come in.
Draco and Harry share their first dance right there, stumbling away from the archway as everyone joins in, soaked in rain and mud, water in their eyes until they can’t see straight.
“You shouldn’t speak to anyone about the thoughts in your head, Draco,” he’d said, and that was that.
Two guards led the prisoner into a room at the far end of the hall, and Harry’s heart caught in his throat at the sight. He couldn’t yet make out any specific details, but knowing the man had used Imperioserum at all was troubling enough.
Draco removed his Muggle cell phone from his pocket, dialling out a number to call. It was a clunky thing with a screen that, when touched, shifted into different images and shapes at the user’s will. Draco quite liked it, though he would never admit it to anyone, as it reminded him of magic.
“You’ve wasted years of my life,” Draco said, his voice low. His hands clutched the bedsheets in an iron grip. If his nails were sharp or long enough, they would have ripped through the fabric entirely.
Harry eased a third finger into him, and Draco gasped at the intermingling of pain and pleasure. He writhed under Harry, who steadied him with a hand on his stomach and pumped his fingers in roughly. Draco still had his t-shirt on from before, and he was infinitely grateful for its presence.
“I wasn’t home,” Harry offers, knowing it won’t be enough to satiate Ron’s curiosity. “Did you say hello to Claude for me at least?”
Draco pats the space next to him, and Harry reluctantly moves closer, leaning up against one of the bedposts. The curtains are drawn around the bed and usually, Harry would feel safe and relieved in the little enclave Draco has created but worry creases lines into his forehead. Draco’s pupils are black, and the skin of his face is translucent, almost ghost-like in its appearance, a sheen of sweat across his forehead. If there’s one thing Harry has learned recently, it’s that this state is only temporary. Highs don’t usually last as long as people seem to think.
Harry sucked in a breath, but Pansy was thankfully focusing attention elsewhere. “What do you mean?”
The previous summer, Harry had attempted to cultivate a rare strain of azaleas that Neville had acquired on his last trip to Asia. He had promised Harry that if he had been unable to care for them, he shouldn’t worry, because Azaleas, in general, were some of the hardest flowers to take care of. But Harry had insisted anyway that they wouldn’t be a problem, and when the first few had come into bloom, he had wanted to gloat. He had been desperately excited that he was the exception to a long-standing rule. The flowers were a beautiful and deep orange with a ring of rosy pink at their rims. The stems, surprisingly, were an eggplant purple. Neville had told him that the best way to measure the health of a wizarding plant was through the state of its stem. Harry had been in the middle of writing an optimistic note to Neville about the success when he had glanced outside and the flowers had curled in on themselves. What remained had been unpleasantly wilted petals and stems that had turned a horrible shade of grey.
There isn’t an enchanted night sky in the ceiling anymore, and all Harry can see is black. They stay like that for a long time, Harry thinks from the ticking of the grandfather clock on the wall, but it feels like seconds when Draco turns over to look at him. He seems to have cleared his head by just the slightest bit. He doesn’t look better, but he looks like he feels more sober.
“Pull down his trousers,” Harry orders, and is relieved to see Theo work without asking questions. He fumbles with the buckle for far too long, before pulling Draco’s trousers down, just above his knee.
To match his terrible attitude, Draco looks like hell. There had at least been some life and colour in his face in the morning. But now, Draco seems like a shell of himself, cheekbones cutting sharply through the skin of his face, and blue lips cracked, discoloured and flaking with dry skin. Harry wonders if it was the drug he’d taken the night before, but he couldn’t remember Draco looking so awful at all. In fact, he’d been almost ethereal.
Pansy shakes her head, white knuckles gripping the door handle. “It’s her only son’s wedding, of course she would come. Theo,” she calls back in. He appears at the door in an instant. “Let’s leave them for a second.”
She’s dressed in beautiful, simple olive-green robes, her hair braided up into a bun, no strand of blonde out of place. She clasps her hands together in front of her, and Harry feels as though he’s about to be scolded by a professor. But her change in expression is quick as she relaxes into the environment. The thin, tight line of her lips curves upward, into what Harry can only call a willing smile.
He went back for more, gaining confidence at the affirmative noises, and took the whole head into his mouth, playing gently with the tip and swirling his tongue roughly along the shaft. Draco cried out, squeezing his eyes tight as Harry licked and sucked at him from below. He pushed further down along Draco, feeling something hit the back of his throat, and hollowed his cheeks instinctually.
“What?” Harry stood too, knocking the chair back and flinching as it clattered loudly against the hardwood. “No. You are
much damage, and it would be worth it in the end if it somehow saved Harry from the empty void that lay at the end of their relationship.
. He was on the precipice, subject to the arguably deranged criminal’s whims in front of him. Reliant on him in a way that made Harry severely uncomfortable.
Harry drops his hand. “It’s alright.” He wandlessly Summons a tissue box from the dresser, leftover from when he’d had a cold in the weeks before meeting Draco again.
“You don’t happen to know who Malfoy’s soulmate is, do you?” Harry asks abruptly, unsure if he’s about to blow his cover or not. He knows it's a tactless move, and he wants to snatch the words back as they leave his lips.
“I’m not!” Draco said, and Harry believed him. If anything, he wouldn’t lie. “I’m not cheating on you. But I do have something to say, and I want you to be open to it.”
Harry can feel his glasses slightly askew on his nose, but he can’t bring himself to move and straighten them. The grandfather clock is chiming out, competing for volume with the overhead speakers.
Harry leaves them to find the living room, and he takes the steps two at a time. He bursts into the bedroom, breathing heavily against the doorframe for a millisecond before jumping for his spare set of uniform robes in the closet. He’s lucky that Hermione had forced both him and Ron to keep a pair at home, just for emergencies, because standard protocol was to leave them in the office while off-duty.
Harry thought he could see the faintest rosy blush on Draco’s pale cheeks, but it was cold in the Three Broomsticks that day. He could be imagining things.
“Fuck,” he gasped, rummaging through the drawer on his side of the bed. None of his distinctly purple liquid was found.
“Hi there,” she said, her voice saccharine. She’d always had a soft spot for Harry, and he hated exploiting her in the way he did now. But it only made sense to keep Ginny’s suspicions at bay.
“I mean, maybe he’s right, ‘Mione. You can’t just hang him out to dry,” Ron says. “It’s not going to be an easy life if your soulmate is a drug addict. You know if he dies—”
It’s only a few moments later that Harry is inching himself in, and Draco is saying “Fuck, oh, Harry, Merlin!” into the palm of his hand.
He sat in the plastic seat, feeling a hollow ache spread across the length of his chest, permeating his senses in a way that made him claustrophobic and tired. Harry’s hands trembled, never still anymore, even when the rest of him was.
“I’m supposed to go once a week,” Draco says. His cheeks flush, a rosy pink colour that stands out against pale skin. “I was wondering if you might come with me to the first one. You can say no, if you want.” The words rush out of Draco’s mouth quickly as though he doesn’t want to say them at all. He refuses to make eye contact as Harry comes to stand next to him.
Zabini tapped Parkinson shortly, and she huffed, heading back into the Slytherin common room. Harry felt even more uncomfortable alone in Zabini’s presence.
Harry can only hear the bass, a pounding rhythm circling throughout the house and reverberating through every bone in his body. The lights are dim and low, and figures sway back and forth attuned to roaring music that he doesn’t particularly like.
The garden of the Burrow is lit with floating candles as the sun begins to set in the sky, turning it an inky blue. Long wooden benches lead up to an archway and intertwined narcissus flowers and lilies pepper the intricate aisle. Lights are low and dim as people chat amongst themselves by the drinks table. The wedding could have been a spectacle, Harry knows. With his money and the Malfoy fortune combined, they could’ve done something huge. But Draco, to Harry’s surprise, had insisted on something quiet, intimate. Molly had practically begged them to do it at the Burrow, and Harry was eager to agree. After all, it had been his first real home. And Ginny and Blaise have done a wonderful job dressing up the place for guests. Aside from this area, there’s a long table decorated with soft white linens and flowers and vegetables from Luna and Neville’s greenhouse.
Draco scoffed, but a smile tugged at his lips. “Luna wanted me to ask if you were free this evening. Ginny and Pansy are hosting dinner at the house.”
Draco looked to the room, a conscious collection of so many lives being lived, feeling a pang of jealousy at their mere existence. What he had been doing all this time couldn’t be classified as such.
Music, a warm and cosy mix of acoustic sounds in the air, swells in the background as Fleur plays her lyre, and Percy strums gently at his guitar.
Draco lets out a humourless laugh. “I couldn’t bear to be there for another second, Harry. Theo and I used much of our inheritance to buy this place together. It looks so strange because Pansy took creative licence, but it’s a Muggle home. We just wanted to get away.”
He stumbles forward toward the door before realising it, knocking fists into the wood as though his life depends on it. If the gate hadn’t locked securely behind him, Harry fears it would.
They haven’t publicised their relationship just yet, but Harry doesn’t think anyone in the group will bother outing them. They seem like the types of people to highly value their privacy.
Conversations with Draco used to feel like double Potions on a Monday afternoon. Somehow, now, it is a bit more like Quidditch practice. Achingly intoxicating. Harry shifts his weight unconsciously, and the pristine white of the bandage stains too quickly in red.
Harry, suddenly the most horrified by himself that he’s ever been, finds himself just wanting to bend over and suck on it.
“Do you want the truth?” Draco asked, and something in his grey eyes communicated to Harry that he would get it. Harry nodded in response, wondering if the potion was going to answer, or Draco himself.
“It really isn’t.” Harry agreed. He would rather do anything than press the subject but tried his best to hide the shock. Harry never knew a Draco like this before the war.
“You say that every year, love, and yet here we are.” She teased, but wrapped him up in a bear hug. Harry leaned into it, comforted by any and every human touch. “How’ve you been? I haven’t seen you in so long. Draco doesn’t tell me much about you anymore.”
“Oh,” Hermione says, her voice squeaky and high like it gets when she’s nervous. “We didn’t mean to interrupt anything.”
Once the Healer had dismissed any theories about a hex or physical ailment, the next step was the Janus Thickey Ward, so Draco had just walked out with his back to the door.
There’s so much love around him, and it’s beautiful to see his best friends so happy. Even then, sometimes it hurts all the same.
“Harry, I just need someone,” Draco said quietly, as though he were embarrassed to even say such a thing.
intentionally overdose, and you’re struggling with your mental health. That’s not to say you won’t get better and grow from this experience, but it is the reality of your situation.”
Harry didn’t idle for a moment, closing the distance between their lips and letting his head fill with the scent of Draco. He knew things wouldn’t be perfect, but they hardly ever were. This was something Harry ached to take a chance on.
Harry feigned surprise, and in his most Slytherin of characteristics, he mustered a sense of false courage. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Ginny didn’t feign surprise and didn’t offer a response, for which Harry was grateful. He knew how obvious the rift in their relationship was to other people. Ginny and Draco had been best friends for years, especially after so much time working together, and Harry felt like he somehow lost her in the chaos of everything.
His face must have gone red because Neville quickly held up his hands in surrender, “I promise I won’t tell anyone!”
They both dozed off on the couch, and Harry eventually woke. The television was still on, murmuring a scene from another romance film. Moonlight shone brightly through the living room window as if it were lit up entirely by itself. The night didn’t seem as cold as it did before. Harry gently lifted Draco from where he was curled into the corner of the couch and wrapped his arms sturdily around him.
Draco considers the question for a moment. “I’ve always loved reading. I don’t tend to make the time for it anymore like I used to.”
“Healer Clove!” a Mediwitch called from down the hall, breaking Draco from his musing. “You’re needed in 3A.”
“What’s wrong?” Ron says with surprising immediacy, noticing the way Harry's words waver. Ron's voice is rough and unused, as though he’s just awoken. “Be there in a minute, I’m bringing ‘Mione.”
“Not like this, Draco,” he says, taking a purposeful step back and running a hand through his messy hair.
Harry sets him up in the untouched guest bedroom down the hall with a pair of pyjamas and an extra toothbrush. He collapses back onto his bed, wondering where the day has gone and when exactly he fell in love with Draco Malfoy.
He sleeps that night more soundly than he has recently, but his dreams are full of Draco. Harry pictures the scene in the bathroom, but in an alternate reality where Draco lives and lives and lives. He grows old, and he has children. He makes a life for himself. The dream shifts, and red blurs Harry’s vision. He yells for Draco, urging him to take his hand, but the boy disappears into the blackness.
“We’ve been making strides with patients who have issues with self-control. The Silybum helps cases involving drug or alcohol addiction or even something like a food or sex addiction. It’s been a miracle with patients who act on impulse and can’t break themselves away from the voice inside of their head telling them they need to do something,” Neville had explained.
were overwhelmed.” Draco laughed, a sick and cruel sort that rang through Harry’s ears unpleasantly.
“Fuck no!” Theo snaps, flopping back down unceremoniously onto his pillow. “D’you really think, if I had to actually sleep with a man, you’d be my first choice? Draco’s fit as hell, and I don’t even think he’d be able to turn me. Now, Seamus on the other hand...”
Harry had a bit of practice with this sort of thing, though. In the early days, Draco could weasel anything out of him, whether it be a guilty pleasure, gossip from one of their friends, or maybe even a secret purchase. That wasn’t necessarily the case anymore, and the lack of trust between them was an influential factor in that.
Harry stopped then, turning slowly away from the sink where he’d already begun on the washing up. “What did you say?”
“Er,” Harry pauses for a moment, wondering if he should just get to the point and then take his leave. “Sure, I guess.”
The street is quiet save for the occasional passing car as Harry gathers the courage to head for the front door. He’s not the tallest person in the world, but he knows he’ll certainly have to duck under the entryway to get inside. Draco’s quite lanky himself, and Harry wonders if it doesn’t bother him to do that every single day. It seems like something that would.
He’s bent over the toilet, dry heaving into the bowl. Nothing seems to be coming out, though, and that’s an improvement in Harry’s eyes.
“I can’t help it!” Harry says, holding his hands up in surrender. He reaches forward, tucking an arm around Draco’s waist, bringing him in for a kiss. “You’re everything.”
“It wouldn’t have been right,” Ginny smiles. “You love who you love. Take some comfort in that. And don’t be fucking stubborn, go a few more weeks without seeing him and trust me, you’ll attach yourselves at the hip after that ordeal.”
“Don’t be daft, there’s never been any connection,” Harry retorts grumpily, toying at the end of a quill with his fingers.
Harry kisses the space behind Draco’s ear in response. He pulls back, disentangling himself from the position, backing Draco up slowly against the counter. Harry’s lips meet Draco’s, warm and pliant. Just perfect.
“You look like you’ve seen a Dementor,” Ginny quipped, but her eyes lit with a faint worry. Draco conceded that he probably didn’t look his best. He’d unbuttoned his shirt a bit, as he’d overheated in the small space, and his hair was likely untidy after its brief meeting with water.
“Hullo,” Harry said, low and gruff as though he’d only just woken. Draco knew all too well that his sleep voice stuck around for a while longer after he’d been in bed. A smile flickered across his features, and he practically lit up from across the room.
Although they had reconnected with Narcissa in the years following Draco’s initial recovery, things were still a little tense for reasons Harry still isn’t entirely sure of. Narcissa steps to the side as Blaise passes by her with a tray of homemade Pumpkin Pasties. His eyes only widen a little at the sight of her in the home.
If it’s possible, Draco’s expression grows colder and meaner, and Harry wishes he could rewind time and start the entire conversation, or even morning, over again.
“Boys, we’re heading out for a bevvy. Join us, yeah?” Oli asked, picking up the football and resting it on his hip. The other boys crowded around the two as if they were exciting foreigners. Harry supposed that in a way, they were.
“I know,” he repeats, his breath faltering as Harry presses down, leaning forward into the heat between Draco’s legs.
“I know,” Draco says. “Though I would’ve tortured you if you hadn’t done this to me first. We make for quite a compelling pair.”
Harry laughs, but it feels forced. Their moment of casual conversation, and little introspection, feels ruined by the burden of their intoxication. By the reality that, in the morning, this will be all gone.
For a moment there was a pause, and Harry thought Draco hadn’t heard him. But when he went to open his mouth again, Zabini rolled his eyes.
“Is he alright?” Harry asks, unsure if his question stems from a place of pure curiosity or underlying concern.
Then, there it is again, a sense of impending sadness that he can’t entirely place. A small part of him worries that it’s because he’s leaving Draco behind. He pushes the thought away, making for the door before he can try and go back upstairs.
Draco’s cold gaze turned frosty at that, “We can take care of ourselves, Harry. We don’t need you to swoop in and save the day all the time. You don’t have to unload your entire guilt complex on me, and if that’s why we are friends, then I don’t want to be anymore.”
one,” Draco corrects. “But what’s most compelling about a surprising death is how utterly unforgettable it is.”
“As much as I appreciate the offer, I do have a day job.” His eyes twinkled in light of the tease, but Odessa’s face didn’t move. Draco had barely noticed something was wrong, so how could she?
They sat in silence for a minute, as Harry softened inside of Draco, but neither of them dared to move. If they moved, they’d have to acknowledge what had just happened. Finally, minutes later, Draco clambered off of Harry’s lap. They dressed in silence.
A large part of Draco regretted calling her Looney Lovegood along with everyone else in their younger years. She was always a bright witch; there was no doubt in that. He knew he needed someone’s help, and she seemed like one of the only viable options.
His back was turned on Draco, but he felt no fear at the fact. Draco wasn’t nearly as much of a threat as he had been before the Imperioserum, and for that, Harry felt a weight soar from his chest. This felt like a game.
Ron muttered something under his breath gruffly, but Harry was too bored by their conversation to let it provoke him. Hermione was livid.
A genuine smile colors Harry’s features for the first time in a long time, “In another life, we would have been best friends Draco.”
He scrambled to the floor to collect the contents and offered the items back to her sheepishly. “I’m so sorry, Madam,” he mumbled, sidestepping her quickly and leaving her confused and angry.
“A particularly nasty hex, I suppose,” Harry says, resting his head back into his hands. “Usually, I can block, but I lost my wand out there.”
“Am I missing something here?” Harry asked suspiciously, taking a slow sip of wine. He felt horribly out of the loop and hoped embarrassment at the fact wasn’t making its presence known on his features.
“I can assure you, I wouldn’t want that ever again,” he said, his eyes wide. Harry stepped closer, and Draco placed his hands protectively against Harry’s chest.
Harry finds himself finally believing in a God when the gates simply open, unlocking with a soft click that he hears by a miracle over the pounding storm.
Draco broke away first, tightening his scarf around his neck with one hand and balancing the box in the other. He shifted, making toward the door as he heard Harry begin to order his tea and a pastry to go with it.
There was something unsure in Draco’s eyes, but he fucked him through it anyway, where earlier he might’ve stopped to ask if something was wrong, if he could do something differently. Draco didn’t say anything either, and Harry assumed it was fine. He was too lost in sensation to care.
Because work has been nothing short of insane. It isn’t really that crime rates have risen because they’ve been steadily declining since the war itself. But, Harry is, for the first time in a long while, beginning to find his job quite fun. He and Ron are out in the field more often than not, assigned to cases that Harry only heard about in the movies. Tracking rogue serial killers across Romania and overthrowing an underground drug ring had been two intensely exciting cases they’ve had the opportunity to work on the weeks before the wedding. He and Ron haven’t complained about the paperwork once, and that seems to put Robards in a permanent good mood.
A trickle of cold sweat ran down the back of his neck, making him shudder at the sensation. He took a step back, as though the space between them would widen and stretch into comforting and safe oblivion.
He was beginning to think his subconscious was having a midlife crisis instead, and there was nothing else to do but wait it out.
“Fine.” Ron spoke brusquely, “If you’re going to be like this, fine. Choose a Death Eater over us, see how that works out for you, yeah?”
They head out of the bakery and into the busy street. If it’s possible, the Alley has grown more crowded, and people bustle around with their new purchases. Harry directs them to Flourish and Blotts first, because if there’s an easy person to buy a gift for, it has always been Hermione.
“I don’t really know, to be honest.” Harry shrugged, “something definitely isn’t right. Sleep would do me well right now, I think.”
Harry flushes quickly, his cheeks hot with embarrassment. “No, er, I meant like, just to get to know each other better, you know? Or we don’t have to, if you don’t want—”
He’s unsure of why the statement bothers him so much. Draco might be his soulmate, but Harry barely knows him. He shouldn’t feel the need to take care of Draco like this, but something in him pulls him to do so. He doesn’t want to leave him alone.
He entered the kitchen, beelining for the liquor cabinet, which was open more often than not. Without much thought, he selected a square-shaped tumbler that Draco had insisted was elegant and modern when they had purchased it. Harry didn’t much care what their glasses looked like as long as they did the job. He poured himself a substantial amount of Firewhisky, admiring how the auburn liquid curled around the back of his throat like fire. He loved every second of the sweet burn it gave him. He found that physical pain was the easiest to understand than any other.
Draco inhaled raggedly against the hard surface, attempting to focus on anything but the intensity and overstimulation of feeling in his skull. He wanted to tell Harry to get out and quit badgering him with questions, but he would do anything to make the pain stop.
“It’s like you’ve just gone and forgotten the last seven years!” Ron threw his arms up frantically, “people like him never change.”
Harry’s eyes snap up to the familiar voice, and he watches Draco descend from the stairs, floating down like a ghost. There are unpleasant purple circles underneath glassy eyes that seem to look through Harry’s face as though it’s transparent.
Harry reaches the top of the stairs faster than he expects to. But when he approaches the window, he pauses. He sits on the precipice, slinging his legs over the edge to just look out at a distance and let them hang below him.
Relief followed like a tidal wave, and Draco breathed out an alleviated sigh for the welcome sensation of absolutely nothing going on in his head.
“Now, this is the part where you say it back,” Draco laughs, but the statement is tinged with a layer of anxiety, worry maybe, that Harry might not return the feeling.
Draco, offering a smile, nodded his assent, folding his arms over his frame and leaning back against the wall to wait.
Harry’s help. Quickly, he braced himself for a shock of pain at the thought alone. But it didn’t come, and Draco unscrewed his face.
Harry doesn’t know much about vine wood, though he remembers reading something in the Department of Mysteries about the types of people that possessed these wands. The Druids believed that only those with a larger purpose, a hidden depth were capable of using such an instrument.
Draco looks up to the door with a foreign expression on his face. “Will you give me a moment alone with her?”
“I hope someday you’ll forgive me for this, Draco,” Harry said, and there was an unwavering note of sincerity in his tone.”
Malfoy held out a small brooch that was dwarfed by his large hand. “McGonagall allowed us a portkey, but I asked her quite nicely for apparating privileges for the first term. She granted them, of course. Hooking up the portkey each time would be a pain, and I already know that would be left up to me.”
“Yeah, no shit,” Harry mutters, dusting off his robes and making for the elevators empty-handed. He’s barely thinking of what excuse to use on Ron in regard to where his coffee is.
“I actually think I need to lie down for a bit,” he said cautiously, awaiting any sign of activity from his head. When nothing came, he let out a small sigh of relief.
“My name is Ethel,” she says, with a sweet and reassuring smile pasted upon her features. Harry doesn’t feel comfortable around her, though her expression indicates that he probably should.
Draco rolled his eyes, aiming a cleaning spell at the dishes instead. The sponge irritably squirmed out of Harry’s grasp, and the plate detached itself too. Harry’s exasperation rose as he watched the plates clean themselves faster than he could have.
He occupied the seat across from Draco, sliding a plate of eggs and toast across the table. Draco hummed a thank you in response as he picked at breakfast half-heartedly and looked anywhere but Harry himself.
She forced Harry to stand, shuffle over, and open the window so she could fly out. Only she didn’t. Instead, turning a disdainful eye, she preened against the autumn air as if to say,
The sound of glass shattering against the hardwood startled Harry for a moment. He bent over the bed quickly to see remnants of his Dreamless Sleep bottle scattered across the ground.
He pays a hefty sum for both the books and goes to meet Draco by the doorway. As he goes to put the book back where he found it, Harry stops him, his hands wrapping gently around Draco’s forearm.
“Sometimes I kind of wished they hit me and gotten it over with. All that psychological stuff was unbearable,” Harry confessed.
He supposes it’s only right that he rings in the New Year with someone else. Ron and Hermione are at a pub with Ginny and Blaise. Harry, of course, had been invited but he’d preferred to spend the evening alone. And although those plans have been derailed, he’s still eager to see Draco and some of his friends.
“This is my last year here,” Narcissa says, looking around. “Kipsy assisted me in redecoration efforts. I attempted to make it as warm as possible because it never was.”
A sharp crack of lightning shines bright and hot through the expanse of the black sky. It’s the only light Harry can see for miles; rain closer to his skin than the air is at all, robes heavy and uncomfortable on his wiry frame. The trees seem to grow taller, enclosing around him in a thick, unbreachable circle. He’s never been the claustrophobic type, but something has changed. The night is dense with the thrilling possibility of new fears.
“Get him on the couch,” Harry commands Theo, passing Draco swiftly over like he’s a ragdoll. “I’ll get the kit.”
“Oh, fuck,” Draco groaned, throwing one free hand over his forehead, and the other curled tightly into Harry’s tangle of dark hair. “Yes, oh, Merlin.”
“Hello there!” He clapped Malfoy forcefully on the shoulder, and he at least had the decency to startle. “Name’s Oliver. But you two can call me Oli.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth gives a slight upturn. “I wouldn’t be falsely accusing you if I did say that.”
So this was about sex. Harry figured he might as well give it to him; it was his birthday after all.
“You were acting in self-defense.” Dumbledore continues, hardly disconcerted by Harry’s lack of response, “You will be placed under probation, but will undertake it as such within Hogwarts. You
Draco’s slumped over the toilet again, which Harry is surprised to find isn’t much of a concerning sight anymore. But his skin is grey and pallid, almost corpse-like. He’s breathing shallowly, but his eyes are closed. Harry kneels down next to him, putting a hand to his forehead. It’s sweaty and cold.
“You know her, she always thinks I’m ill or something,” Draco said, his voice guarded. “I’ve told her numerous times, I’m just
Harry glares at the flickering sign above the receptionist’s desk. The waiting room itself is clean and sterile, and reminds him of a Muggle hospital, though he considers that he’d rather be there than here at all.
“Don’t even try, boy.” Snape picks at a thread on the wrist cuff of his robes. “I will concede that if you had called me sooner, I could have cast the counterspell. And Draco might have still been with us today.”
Harry hesitated, but sat himself on the edge of the wood, observing his husband in the dirt. Maybe he was hallucinating and would wake up to the sterile walls of St Mungo’s at any second. There was absolutely no reality in which Draco Malfoy, under the influence of a potion or not, would let himself walk barefoot in the dirt. Yet here he was, doing just that.
Ron, at least, didn’t feign ignorance. “She is. But you are family to Hermione and me before anyone else.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, pushing the sad thoughts from his mind. He’s determined to have a good day with Draco.
identifying feature he could find, he wanted gone. Self-consciously, Draco drew a finger up and tucked a stray strand back into the hat.
“I do not!” Draco said defensively, but lifted his feet onto Harry’s lap. “I just think the box is an eyesore in the living room.”
Harry pauses, training his eyes back down to a half-eaten croissant. “Have you ever given any thought to this whole thing?” he asks vaguely, carefully, because he doesn’t want to spook Draco away.
Everyone had abandoned the surprise aspect of the party, and instead interspersed around the garden like bees of the same hive. Harry knew his home, and his lush garden, was conducive to such an environment.
He fingered the blue vial of the other mysterious potion, and thought back to the stranger of the apothecary.
When Harry settled into his chair, nausea accompanied a quickening heart rate. Seamus and Parvati had been undercover for weeks, and he worried about what their absences at the table meant. Had something happened? Had they been hurt?
“Mmm,” Draco responded through a closed mouthful of food. He dabbed at his lips with a linen napkin.
“The body has been taken to St Mungo’s for autopsy and analysis,” Robards said. “She was found just outside of Gringotts with a dagger through her heart. The wound seems to be self-inflicted, but she was dosed with Imperioserium prior to her death. Delaney, Ms Granger will accompany you to St Mungo’s to examine the body.”
“Excellent,” she said, but her tone lacked the brightness of the word. “You two have the entirety of the first term to work together on this. To do some research. I expect great things.”
Harry summoned the lube, and it flew around the corner of the hallway and into his outstretched hand. He emptied a substantial amount of the bottle onto his fingers, giving his erection a few tugs with a slick hand.
Another part of him was just happy that he had his husband back. The one who loved him unconditionally and told him so. He wasn’t sure if, at this point, his moral compass could win out over something so wonderful.
Harry was left standing in the halls, and his knees were a little weak at the interaction. He’d only wanted to ask when they should arrange their first meeting. He supposed he should probably be angrier at their situation, after all, undertaking this project only meant less time with his friends and more time with likely his least favorite person on earth sparing the Dursley’s themselves. But he was surprised his first reaction had been just a touch of apathy. Harry hadn’t wanted to come back for the eighth year, he had craved to dive headfirst into Auror training and pick back up in the real world where he left off. He had not cared to stay attached to the confines and comforts that Hogwarts offered. In a sense, it would always feel like home. But it was a home he had consciously and deliberately grown out of. Hermione had somehow convinced him that his last year of education was vital and would be the most formative of all. If Harry could find a way to deal with the Malfoy situation, he might have agreed with her.
It was as though the room let out a collective breath. Even Hermione, who likely was privy to this information already, seemed happier that it was out in the air. Tangible, in a sense.
didn’t think anything.” Hermione said crossly, glaring at Ron. She turned her gaze on Harry, “I told him you were busy, I’m sorry.”
Harry figures he cannot reveal the whole truth, but he doesn’t want to lie entirely. “I went there looking for you. I didn’t realise you’d served your house arrest somewhere else.”
“How could McGonagall not ask me? I would be perfect for this role!” She cried, and Ron patted her on the back comfortingly.
Harry looked up, helpless, meeting Draco’s eyes. His mask slipped then, crashing down over his face and transforming it into a facade of cruel apathy. Draco startled at the sight, suppressing an audible gasp. He’d never seen his husband alter so quickly before. One of Harry’s greatest strengths was his emotions, his ability to feel for everyone, and everything. It was clear that ability, the one that made him truly good, had gone.
When he was unwilling to spend the night making excuses to his friends, Harry went to Hermione and Ron’s to see Rose and Hugo and show his face for a few hours. But Draco was always “too sick” to join.
Harry, on a separate countertop, prepared a roast chicken with clementines from the garden. They always found excuses to incorporate the things they had grown into the meals they ate.
Draco presses his spine to the wall, resting his head back with a soft thump. Somehow the sight of it all makes Harry feel sick too. A slick layer of sweat coats his forehead, damping long blonde strands of hair that fall around his face. His eyes are a bloodshot, unpleasant red that make it look like he hasn’t slept properly in days. Harry doesn’t really think he has.
Before Harry could throw his book at the grass angrily, an eagle owl flew overhead and dropped a note into his open palm.
“I didn’t know you lived here,” Harry says, and while he’s talking about the castle, he means Romania, in general.
Harry allowed his careful mask to slip as both terror and relief settled onto his features simultaneously. They’d been working the case for months, and Harry had practically promised her family that he’d follow through. Of course, he’d let them down without even realising it, or bothering to apologise. It was a weight off his chest to know that the killer had come forward, but an even more considerable burden to know that this could be the key to breaking the case.
Ginny sighs. “Harry, you haven’t been a part of the magical world for that long. And you didn’t hear the stories that we all did growing up. This whole soulmates thing can be a blessing and a curse, that’s why they did away with it in the first place.”
Pansy swallowed a bite of food, before dabbing at the corner of her mouth with a napkin. She’d always eaten so politely, just like Draco. Harry and Ginny, on the other hand, ate like Weasleys — joyously and brazenly.
“Follow me, Potter,” Draco teased, and Harry tagged along behind him. He found that he would follow Draco anywhere if he asked so temptingly.
Harry sat up, taking some of the lube from the bowl and circled slowly around Draco’s entrance. Draco had moved up to meet him, and their chests were pressed together as Harry’s slick finger slid in carefully. He left it there for a moment, allowing Draco to get accustomed to the feeling. His grey eyes were wild with pleasure and desire, and Harry could come right there. Draco looked beautiful, so willing. He pumped in and out a few times, after adding more fingers until Draco was stretched and whimpering around him.
Fingerprints pressed into his neck and throat were darker than they usually were, and Draco suppressed a gasp. Porcelain skin was barely visible underneath disturbing hues of blue, grey, and black. A clear, circular ring around his throat displayed exactly where Harry’s punishing grip held him tight, pressing him to a wall with one hand and rutting inside of him like an animal.
He forced his eyes down the length of Draco’s body to assess what had happened. Harry reached for his chest, ripping apart the buttons of Draco’s pyjama shirt, barely paying attention to the sounds of them clattering to the floor. He felt his chest, cold to the touch, maybe the faintest glimmer of a heartbeat underneath a map of scars.
A wry smile plays upon Draco’s lips. “Are you asking me on a coffee date, Potter? You know, I’m more of a tea man myself.”
A squirrel clambered out of the vegetable patch after messing about in the planter box of bell peppers that had been left unattended for months. It hopped away happily, belly full from its improvised meal.
“I’m not gonna last if you keep on like that,” Harry slurred, high from the Cannabis and the sight of Draco’s fingers rubbing at him so gently.
“The potion worked at first, didn’t it?” Locke asked, eyes widening with intrigue as though Harry were a sick case study.
Harry draws him up from where he’s curled into his lap, wanting to look him in the face when he says it.
Draco pulled them out of his reach teasingly and met Harry with a wry smile. “Only if you promise they’ll have feta.”
Harry” The worlds barely slip past his lips, his body is involuntarily convulsing beneath him with effort, it is trying so hard to keep him alive. Harry is casting every charm he can think of to stop the bleeding. Still, Malfoy’s skin is being infinitely divided by the cruel spell.
Harry jumps out of bed, entirely too chipper. His housemates startle immediately, but no one makes any attempts to talk to him. Ron would have if he had been in the room, but Harry is grateful that he is not. He might have thought twice about his decision. He had known, from Sirius, that people didn’t know how to deal with other grieving people – it was like they were marked forever by the deaths that surrounded them, and nobody wanted to be a part of that.
Seamus disappears into the sitting room, and Harry’s unwilling to follow. He’s not necessarily in the mood to drink, or take any kind of pills, and he’s really only here because Ginny had insisted so publicly. After all, Harry would never admit it, but she isn’t wrong. It is easy for him to shrug off worry from Hermione or Ron because they pester him so often about his state of affairs. But it’s always serious when Ginny begins to care about something, as she worries so sparingly.
“You know...” Zabini shook his head. “Draco has no one anymore. And if you intend to lead him to a place where he believes he finally might have someone, only to pull the rug out from under him, I will finish what the Dark Lord started with you myself.”
Draco was sitting Ginny down at the table, pouring out a bottle of wine into four stemmed glasses. He looked up for a moment, and the tug of a smile at the corner of his lips sent Harry’s heart reeling.
He entered his office to find his partner missing and Ron occupying the desk across the room. His legs were stretched out over the desktop, and he was filing through papers in his hands, reading quickly and purposefully.
“I despise an omniscient narrator,” Draco says, suddenly, as Harry enters the room. “They act like Gods.”
“I guess it’s both,” Harry says, his voice weak. “Either way, is it possible to speak to him today? I’m sorry for showing up out of the blue, I probably should’ve sent an owl but I figured—”
“Oh, now you’re happy, aren’t you?” Harry grumbled at her, turning to the kitchen. He commenced his breakfast ritual, cracking eggs into an available frying pan with one hand.
Draco grins. “Sometimes Luna and I will cook together at my parties. I’m a great chef, if I do say so myself.”
A cleared throat from the doorway sent Harry’s heart racing, and he hastily tucked the vial into his pocket. He steeled himself against the counter before turning around. Draco leaned against the frame, his hair still dishevelled from when George had roughed him up earlier, and Harry fought the urge to reach out and push the strands back into place. It was unusual to see Draco unkempt.
“There’s nothing around here for ages, Malfoy,” Harry says, eyes wide. Maybe he didn’t need many people, but what a lonely existence to live. The thought makes Harry’s head hurt more than it should.
Harry grinned back at him, tossing the end of his joint into the box,  and sprawled out on his back on the soft blanket. A moment passed, and Draco joined him. Their legs were pressed close together, and Harry could feel the humming of Draco’s pulse against his own. He had never seen Draco so relaxed before, so open.
“Absolutely not,” Draco purses his lips, his eyes firmly fixed on the page in front of him. He doesn’t bother to look up and meet Harry’s eyes. “If there was one, he wouldn’t put us through this shit.”
Cheerless rays of light shone through French doors out to the garden, and Harry opened them instinctively. The morning was still blanketed by a biting cold, but it would burn off by midday according to the weather report.
Draco landed with a thud onto wet ground, keeling over on all fours as nausea overcame him from the unexpected jump. He pushed strands of blond hair out of the periphery of his vision and figured his glamour had slipped down during the pub’s stressful interaction. His heart was still beating rapidly but only increased in pace when his gaze met dark eyes.
“I would’ve taken consistent meals and indifference over respect any day,” Harry laughed. But then he was curious, “Do you think your parents really took care of you?”
“I do have empathy,” he argues, “But it’s true. He’s not only endangering his own life, but also yours.”
Within minutes, Draco is unravelling in his arms. Harry’s at a loss, tears streaking his own cheeks as he watches the man he loves come apart at the seams. Draco sobs for the things he lost in the war too, most importantly, his childhood.
all those years ago. He moaned shamelessly at the sight of his husband’s bare chest, one he hadn’t seen since their Hogwarts days.
He can’t help but shiver at the way Draco says his name, effortlessly as though he’s been saying it his whole life.
Harry laughed, allowing amusement to show on his face, “Draco, you know what this is, right?” Harry was surprised he hadn’t recognized it earlier, but he supposed he should have known. While he’d never tried it, Dudley certainly had and that smell lingered in the backyard of the Dursley’s place at times.
When Harry had exited her office, he cried. He sobbed, loud and wailing in a way that had Muggles eyeing him as though he were having some sort of mental breakdown. It was the kind of crying that was ugly and too real, snot dribbling from his nostrils and tears crusting dry down his cheeks only to be replaced by fresh ones.
“You’re so wonderful,” Harry whispers, forehead pressed against Draco’s. “I’m never letting you go.”
Despite the valid question, there’s a cool ease to the way Draco gestures to the baggies in front of him. Now that they’re easily in view, Harry recognises them for what they are.
Harry searched through the pockets of his robes before producing both items unquestioningly and laying them on the table. Locke scrawled something in a chicken-scratch script that reminded Harry of his own handwriting. He slid the note across the table and back to Harry with his things.
and has not bothered to notice it. His magic seems to be operating mechanically for him, as his brain turns to mush in his head. This is not happening right now. McGonagall bangs her fists against the shield charm, unable to pass through.
“Ah! Fuck—” Harry cries out unexpectedly, gripping the sides of his chair until his knuckles are snow white.
He needed to hold his composure together to learn what Locke knew already. Harry would have to play the long game, even if the mindless taunting was unravelling any semblance of self-control he sought to hold on to.
Harry thinks about it for a moment. And while he’s usually ravenous in the morning time, he feels nothing but a slight, disinterested twinge from his stomach—thoughts of the night before still rattle around his head like loose marbles. A part of him desires to crawl back into bed. To rest his aching joints and pretend he hadn’t lost his partner in the violent exchange. But there’s Draco, in front of him, with eyes that are shining too beautiful to be considered something so drab as grey. Draco who cleans his wounds and offers him breakfast. Who lives in a big castle, all by himself.
Either this was a joke, or he was living an awful nightmare and would wake up any second to the comfortable familiarity of his bed. He reached again for the IV, before a group of nurses began to hold his arms away.
Hermione, with confusion written across her features, allows herself to be led out, mouthing an apology to Harry and asking him to owl her later. He doesn’t acknowledge it, purely because of the way Draco is watching his every move.
“For life,” Harry repeats, feeling his voice go scratchy and raw, too. He pulls them both in close, and Hermione peppers his face with kisses.
The man in front of Draco was sinewy, made of muscle. He was cloaked in long and menacing robes that did nothing to hide his build, and his head brushed a hair’s length away from the ceiling. A mild smile on his features held barely concealed intent. The way his mouth twitched up gracelessly reminded Draco of something he couldn’t quite place. He shifted closer to Draco, alcohol, and smoke prominent on his breath.
“How interesting, Auror Potter. How very interesting.” Locke tilted one corner of his mouth up in a sly smile.
“Don’t be a dolt, Potter. These were my first impressions; I would be embarrassed if I had thought about this ‘a lot’ and only come up with this much.” Malfoy waved his hand at the paper, haphazardly, “The hardest work is going to be the research.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed at Draco, and something discerning flickered in the green. A realisation of sorts. He launched himself at Draco without a moment’s notice, and Carrow stepped back instinctively. Draco caught sight of his own appearance in the bar mirror for only a brief second, realising that his platinum blond had begun slowly creeping back upon his hair.
The wedding ring Harry toyed with in his fingers fumbled, clattering to the ground and creating an unseemingly sharp noise against the quiet.
“Oh.” Something in Draco’s face looked disappointed as if he had been expecting Harry to ask something else. “I was just upset, you idiot. I often find it challenging to control my emotions. My mother always told me that was why she named me for a dragon. She told me I could be so unpleasantly explosive.” He made a noncommittal sound against the back of his throat.
She’d visited with him every day since she’d taken her Portkey in, but still always worried about as a mother would.
Draco remembered catching a glimpse of his appearance in the mirror when he’d been in the bathroom just hours before.
Draco is leaned up against the headboard, and while he still looks sickly and frail, there’s a bit more colour in his cheeks that Harry feels too relieved to see. Draco reaches up, tucking a small strand of blonde hair behind his ear before looking down at his lap. He wears an almost sheepish expression, as though he's embarrassed to be next to him at all. Harry blinks, unsure if he should break their delicate silence and acknowledge the harrowing events of the prior night. But he doesn't want to say something just to say it.  For once, he’d rather be deliberate with his words and make sure he's not doing something to set Draco off.
Most owls, including Hedwig, had been happy to catch their own prey and enjoyed the thrill of a good hunt. Lyra was lazy; she expected to be taken care of. That might have been Harry’s least favourite quality of hers.
“Are you saying you want to die?” Harry asks blankly. He tangles his hands into the bedsheets, if only to ground himself in such a dizzying, painful conversation.
Instead, he hears a door creak. Narcissa Malfoy enters the room and closes the door gently behind her. Harry figures if he’s going to die, if she kills him, he deserves every second of the pain that she will cause.
Harry had stormed away in a huff, locking himself up in Ron’s old bedroom before being coaxed down by Hermione to come eat.
Harry turned on his heel before she could say any more and exited the bakery. He took in air through his lungs as if he’d been holding a breath since before he entered. Something about Madam Odessa had put him off. Even the red velvet cupcake was less enticing than before.
“Harry, I know you have to be seeing what I’m seeing, and Ginny’s worried sick. Draco’s been missing work and moping around at home. He barely firecalls us anymore when he used to all the time! He’s obviously going through something, and we need to be there for him.”
