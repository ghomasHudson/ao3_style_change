Harry,” Hermione sighed, “It’s about the theory behind it. Teddy may not have shown any werewolf traits
“Alright, Tedward. Let’s go,” Malfoy strode past Harry without a glance as they made their way back to the sitting room, Teddy talking happily on Malfoy’s hip.
“Alright,” Harry repeated, turning to face Malfoy directly, “If Teddy says you can show me why the waltz is so important...then why not?”
Malfoy continued to whisper soothing nothings in Teddy’s ear, until he was giggling, feet kicking against the cupboards as he grinned up at his cousin, nodding to whatever question Malfoy had asked him.
“Mm...” Harry licked his lips as he reached for the nearest fork and knife, “Would you prefer I eat like you, Malfoy?”
watch Malfoy, and here he was caught in the act. He could feel his cheeks heating, though he stubbornly refused to be the first to break eye contact. Malfoy’s lips twitched slightly before he glanced quickly to the ground and then back towards Teddy, a light flush lingering on his cheeks.
Malfoy’s lips twitched, his eye crinkling slightly before he looked down, breaking their gaze. Harry felt his own lips twitch and quickly bit his lip to prevent any unintended expression from crossing his face and upsetting Teddy further. He sniffed before glancing down at Teddy, whose eyes had returned to their familiar amber hue, platinum blond beginning to bleed to turquoise, a wide grin splitting his face.
“Er...Just for the record, I’m pretty sure he learned his dramatics from you,” Harry mumbled in an attempt to break the stilted silence.
They finished the rest of their meal in relative silence, though Teddy occasionally remarked on something that he had seen over the last week that he thought they would all appreciate.
“Yes, exactly!” Ginny exclaimed. “See? Harry, he’s different now. We all see it. And we want you to be happy, we want you to—”
“But, why?” Teddy whined, his lower lip beginning to wobble as he gazed up at Malfoy with wet, emerald eyes. “Lunch won’t be ready for so long. The crumble is
Harry slowly chewed his food, a soft smile lingering on his lips as he watched the elderly elf. As much trouble as Kreacher was, Harry couldn’t help it—he had grown fond of him. Kreacher complained about nearly everything, and was almost always talking about how much better it had been at the height of the Black Family’s reign, and yet he did seem to care for Harry in his own, aggravated way.
Draco’s eyes met his, silver irises glowing in the dim light of the fire, a heat blazing so brightly that his gaze warmed Harry more than the hearth ever could.
Teddy giggled, running his hands gently over the Kneazle’s colorful flanks. His rich amber eyes had morphed, reflecting the green of the Kneazle’s own, his pure happiness evident in his shining eyes and flushed cheeks.
“Right,” Malfoy nodded slowly. His fists clenched at his sides before he released a breath, body relaxing. Harry heard a soft
Harry gaped as he watched Malfoy stride out of the sitting room, Teddy clutching desperately to his body. Quiet sobs echoed down the hallway as Malfoy walked away. Blinking stupidly, Harry remained seated in the loveseat as he stared at the empty doorway, listening as Malfoy and Teddy got further away. Everything had happened so quickly—Teddy morphing into a
“Draco,” Potter whispers, voice quiet and low, as if he is speaking to a startled Hippogriff. “I have called you by your name for nearly six years now.”
“Are you sure, Harry? I don’t think you heard a word about my latest Wizengamot case,” Hermione scolded, turning from where she was cutting vegetables for the evening’s meal to give Harry a disappointed look. “It’s quite interesting, and may be important for you to know. After all, we don’t know yet if Teddy will develop any werewolf tendencies with his genetics—”
Harry grimaced, glancing towards the doors to the sitting room, wishing that someone would burst through and break the sudden tension building in the room.
But he wouldn’t spontaneously come by. Not when he was likely busy with work and his boyfriend, and when Teddy was no longer staying with Harry. Not when he did not know that Harry never reverted the wards back, and that Draco still had access to Grimmauld.
The good healer patted James on the shoulder sympathetically. “I’ll be back in a half hour,” she said.
Still frowning, Remus gave Draco those dreaded words: “I’m going to have Bill check you out anyway.” Draco groaned in response.
“It’ll be alright, Draco. You can’t harm him as a human.” Draco nodded, though he didn’t feel that reassured.
Draco arrived early to Remus’s office on Monday afternoon, excited to begin to help even though he knew he would be going into Healing after school. Remus smiled at him upon his arrival. “Eager, are we?” he asked.
Remus flushed at that, and James giggled into his tea. Sirius pointedly ignored eye contact. “How about I get you some literature on that, Haz?”
“Already ahead of you,” Remus placed his cup of coffee down and brandished his wand, heading upstairs. Draco trailed behind, thankful the remaining two thirds of the golden trio were not yet awake.
think some of my being a twat as you so graciously call it had to do with the horcrux. It can apparently possess those who are near to it. Everything about Second Year makes sense now.”
Harry hadn’t spoken since the incident, having witnessed the murder after going on a horcrux venture with Dumbledore. He returned drenched, bruised, and bloody with a faux horcrux and a note from R.A.B.: someone had gotten to the task before they did and the whole affair seemed to be all for naught. Harry didn’t say a word, handing the locket and note to Hermione and turning back to his dorm, shutting himself away. The next morning, he didn’t show up for breakfast. When Draco managed to break into the Gryffindor dorms later that day, Harry didn’t speak: he just sat there with his head in his hands, barely responsive. It was alarming and frightening to Draco, Ron, and Hermione: it was though Harry had gone mute. Sirius, recently cleared in name, showed up to the school as soon as he could, Remus in tow, whisking Harry back home. Draco felt relieved and saddened: relieved that Harry finally had a parental figure who actually cared for him, saddened that he could do nothing to comfort him.
Draco nodded, wintry eyes tight with concern. “He said it was due to nicotine withdrawal. I dunno about that, though. I think he was having an anxiety attack when he noticed the two of you went off.”
Harry laughed in response. It was a choked sort of laugh, like he hadn't made the sound in awhile. It made Draco feel weird. "Thank you," Harry replied quietly. "I'm still getting used to it."
Sirius let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Well I’m trying my best. Never been a father. First day on the job and all.”
for you.” He went into detail about what topics should be covered and set them off to work. From how prickly Theo was being, Draco just knew it would be a long afternoon and wondered if Harry was faring any better with his Dad.
"Please don't call me that," Draco said, feeling more uncomfortable about his obvious feelings toward Harry.
Draco shrugged. Had he really gotten so soft that even Granger could read him? “We don’t really know that.”
Panic began to bubble inside of James. Did he really want to go back out there? “Don’t you need to get back to Harry?”
James grabbed his son’s arm and squeezed it gently in reassurance. “Samhain celebrations really pull on deep, ancestral magic. I guess Remus thought he was too young of a wolf for it to affect him in this way, but with you doing the ceremony it pulled his wolf out. He wants to bring you into the pack.”
They spent the rest of the early morning catching up with Harry’s past seven months, once again, aside from the bad bits. Sirius and James began to develop a plan to get to the bottom of the adoption spell placed on Harry and Harry had never felt more loved or cared for.
“Surely not,” the figure responded, “but I do need to ask you a few questions, if Healer Jacobs allows.”
Remus looked pained to see his young charge suffering so. He didn’t have a moment to respond, though, as their morning was interrupted by a great flash of light and a crash onto the kitchen table. The two jumped back from their seats, Remus whipping out his wand in a flash. Draco stupidly left his upstairs.
Of course, as luck would have it, pushing himself so hard set him back in the healing process as he almost crippled due to magical exhaustion about 3 days into his resolved determination. Covered in sweat, he attempted a Patronus against the Healer’s wishes. He felt that familiar tearing in his chest and hit the ground.
“Alright, laugh at the unfortunate, very well. Can we let the subject matter go for now, please?” he said, not finding their amusement very amusing.
That stung but Draco knew it was necessary to say. He frowned but nodded. “I’m sorry. I just want to help you. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”
Hermione frowned in response. “Do you think it’s wise to keep your position? With everything that has been going on?”
McGonagal looked at him as if she saw a ghost. Harry was getting used to that look but it didn’t make him any less weary about it. Would his face or voice ever belong to him, he wondered. “I was hoping you would be able to offer your preference as to how you would like to be addressed.”
“He cost me the key to defeating Harry Potter and pushing our cause even further.” At that, he twisted his wand forcefully, causing Lucius to cry out. Draco grew even more pale.
Sirius rubbed soothing circles over the tops of Harry’s hands with his thumbs. “Yes you can. You just had a shite teacher is all. Let’s try something: I want you to picture all of your rampant thoughts in a cluttered room.”
It was Draco’s turn to frown. “We haven’t really talked about it. He just helps separate me from Theo during meals really.”
Draco dragged his hands down his face and looked at Remus. “How is this okay?” he asked, panic rising inside of him. How could Harry even look at him after this? “I’m sure he’s furious with me. I wouldn’t be surprised if he never wanted to see me again. I’m a
He shook his head in response. “No—the water wouldn’t have killed me. It weakened me, though.” Regulus looked far away, eyes dulling at the memory. “It’s hard remembering the final moments. I sent Kreacher home with the locket, ordering him to work on destroying it.” He swallowed. “The Inferi dragged me down—I don’t remember what happened next.”
Draco nodded, eyes steeled in determination. “I have been a complete wanker before this summer to you and your friends, but especially to you.” She was staring hard at Draco now, seemingly in disbelief. At the awkward silence, Draco added, “In my defense, I grew up with a Death Eater recounting nonsense about glory days and blood traitors and didn’t encounter any semblance of difference until our first year.”
“Surely, sir,” Draco replied, taking a sip from the mug. He could taste Severus’s brew anywhere. As he felt the familiar light-headedness associated with the truth serum take hold, Draco tried not to take offense to the headmaster drugging him. After all, were he in the same position, he would probably do no different.
Dumbledore seemed to realize that Draco was still in the room. “Draco, my dear boy, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will figure out the best course of action from here. You’re free to go.”
“I’ve also put a giant ‘X’ on my back for saving him. It’s overwhelming. Everyone is always whispering around us.”
He looked impossibly pale, most likely from blood loss. His eyes were sunken and his arms were bandaged heavily. Still, though, he was moving and talking and
Draco snorted in response, the tension obviously eased. “Are we going back to the colony for the full?” he asked, reaching for a chocolate covered scone. Harry couldn’t help but parallel Remus and Draco’s love for chocolate. Maybe it was a wolf thing.
When Harry, Sirius, and Remus stepped through the fireplace at Grimmauld, they were met with loud din coming from the next room. Boisterous conversation, laughter, and clanging of glasses could be heard. This was not like the Order meetings of wartime that held a somber tone. This was a celebrating Order despite their losses.
Sirius looked at Harry suspiciously again. “I feel like you aren’t disclosing something to me, Harrison James.”
"I'm sure he's just as thrilled. Go on, it's on the topmost landing all the way down the hall. It has Sirius's name on the door."
Draco, catching on to Harry’s emotions, continued on. “You’d have to be – it’s woven with ancestral magic. It would know.”
He winced at that. He’d really rather not be compared to his father, who was prickly at best and absolutely menacing and deranged at worst. He looked towards Harry as well, who was eyeing the pair with curiosity. He supposed if Harry was over the situation, he should let it go, too. “Sorry, Pans,” he said finally. “I didn’t provide the most pleasant of greetings, huh?”
“I’m afraid I cannot join you,” Malfoy said, running a comforting hand through Teddy’s hair as the boy let out a squawk of dismay, “I only came by to apologize for having to miss our morning engagement, but I must get back.”
“Toasties!” Teddy shouted eagerly and turned back towards the hob, disregarding the absurdity of Harry’s outfit. “Since Draco couldn’t help the other week.”
Harry returned Andromeda’s greeting, keeping an eye on Malfoy as he did so. Malfoy turned around and reached for a hand towel, drying his hands before folding the towel and neatly draping it over his shoulder. Harry narrowed his eyes, wondering why Malfoy didn’t just dry his hands with a spell, instead of drying them as a muggle would. It had to be beneath him, after all. Raising his gaze from the towel, Harry caught Malfoy smirking at him.
“Sure thing, sprout. I’ve got a few new ones since you were last in,” George nodded his head toward the front corner of the store, where a large display of vibrant Pygmy Puffs were rolling around their enclosure, high squeaks echoing throughout the shop.
“Harry, did you see?! Did you see me flying? Did you?” Teddy cried out excitedly, dropping his broom and throwing himself at Harry once they were near enough.
Harry frowned, trying to recall who Maggie was—although he supposed she must have been the welcomewitch who greeted them upon their arrival. He glanced at Malfoy, curious as to why or what they needed to discuss without Teddy there.
“He’s here!” Teddy cried out, scrambling from his chair and rushing out of the kitchen to greet Draco. Harry heard his godson squeal, followed closely by Draco’s warm laughter.
Andromeda merely hummed in response. She gracefully reached forward, grasping her teacup from where it hovered in front of her to hold it carefully in her hands.
Draco’s bright eyes flickered across Harry’s face, searching, before he raised a hand and brushed sweat-damp curls from Harry’s forehead.
“Oh darling, you know that you need not to worry about tardiness when it comes to your obligations,” Andromeda soothed, smiling softly at her nephew.
“Right, er...Malfoy—” Harry started, hesitating as he and Malfoy stared at one another. “I’m er... I’m sorry. For what I said.”
Harry groaned, licking his lips and throwing his hands in the air in defeat. He didn’t know how to explain it. He didn’t know
Slowly, Teddy began to morph. His tanned skin began to take on a distinctly green hue, nose flattening until all that remained were two small slits for nostrils. His hair remained its regular turquoise, but as he opened his eyes, they were a bright yellow, vertical pupils slitting the iris.
“Well, hello boys,” Ginny purred. She stood on the tips of her toes, greeting Harry with a kiss to his cheek.
“He always has to go early,” Teddy murmured. Harry had to strain himself to hear the words, and froze when he did. He looked up towards Andromeda, only to find her gazing back at him.
“What happened?” Draco asked, striding towards Teddy. He stood on the opposite side of the bed from Harry, running long fingers through Teddy’s hair as his other reached for his wand, deftly beginning a slew of diagnostic charms.
He had just dropped Teddy back off at Andromeda’s an hour earlier, before Hermione and Ron Floo-ed into his sitting room. They hadn’t seen much of each other recently, and all of them would be busy the following week with Wizengamot cases, Auror patrols, and the start of another new job, so they had agreed to spend Sunday evening together at Grimmauld.
Harry nodded, glancing once more to Andromeda and Malfoy, his gaze lingering on the man as he slowly rose from where he knelt on the floor. Their eyes caught and for a split second time seemed to stand still before Malfoy swiftly turned back to the sink to continue washing the dirtied dishes.
“Oh, you know—” Ginny smirked mischievously, “—just that as Teddy was begging you to go to camp, his hair turned all white blond and his eyes kept changing color.”
Malfoy’s head snapped towards Harry so quickly that Harry could swear he heard a crack of the man’s neck.
He and Draco flew next to one another for a few minutes, quiet as they listened to the excited screams of the children maneuvering their training brooms around miniature goals. Angelina opened a worn trunk, revealing quaffles, bludgers and a snitch, all modified with child-safe charms so that they would hover just beyond their reach and move with little force.
“Oh, am I?” Malfoy spat, crossing his arms across his narrow chest as he leaned against the sink, “Why else would I be here, Potter? You seem to know everything. Do tell, why
“Harry!” Teddy cried, footsteps thundering down the hallway. “He isn’t here! He said he’d stay, but he’s—“ Teddy flung the door to Harry’s room open and skidded to a halt upon seeing Harry and Draco in bed. “
“Well, would you look at that?” The elderly man nodded with approval. “It looks like this little one has claimed you.”
swept onto the pitch. It shimmered, light twisting until it assumed a corporeal form—a crow. It circled Draco’s head before settling on the ground in front of him.
If possible, Teddy’s eyes widened even more. He clasped his fists together and they began to shake slightly before he screamed out, “
” Harry stuttered as Draco’s tongue dove deep within him. He would not be able to last long if Draco kept this up, and he wanted more than just Draco’s mouth and tongue. Hesitantly, he whispered, “...
Teddy leapt into the air, thrusting his tiny fists above his head in excitement as he squealed, “Yeah! Let’s go!”
“Gods, why wouldn’t I?” Harry breathed out sharply, biting back an adoring grin. “Your crumble is the best I have ever had—but do
Malfoy sat in his armchair, a fond smile softening his sharp features as he watched Teddy play with the Kneazle. Any grudge the creature may have held from the earlier morph had obviously been dismissed, as Gary let out an excited meow every time he circled Teddy.
“Oh!” Ginny chimed in, “Are we talking about Teddy convincing Harry to send him to Quidditch camp by suddenly becoming a
“Draco is teaching me how to waltz!” Teddy smiled, eyes shining with excitement as he looked up at Harry, nearly vibrating out of his skin. “Watch,
He grinned as Teddy squealed and skipped to the kitchen table. With a deft flick of his wand, Harry levitated the pot of soup from the hob, reveling in the domesticity of setting the table for lunch.
“See, I told you!” A smug grin spread across Teddy’s face, one dimple tugging at his left cheek. He wriggled around in George’s grasp, attempting to sit up straight, as he basked in the glory of being right.
Teddy had been so thrilled, eyes shining with excitement as he attempted to steal bites of the crumble when Draco was not looking. And Draco had been...different.
Harry laughed, grinning as Teddy bounced on his feet. Tucking the brooms beneath his arms, Harry reached his free hand towards Draco.
“Of course. How could I forget?” Malfoy nodded, gently squeezing Teddy’s hand, before he looked back at Harry, raising one eyebrow and offering a smirk. “Thank you for your generous apology, Potter. In accordance to form, I accept.”
“Here, let me,” Harry’s fingers brushed against Malfoy’s heated skin, gently rubbing his cheek as he wiped the flour from his face.
Andromeda would kill him. Ever since that feral Kneazle had gotten stuck in the tree outside of her cottage, she was adamant that they were worthless creatures.
“No. We need to see Healer Malfoy,” he growled. Teddy let out a choked sob at the sound, fingers grasping weakly at Harry’s t-shirt as his hair began to morph to a dull, dirty blond.
witch,” Kreacher frowned, looking at Harry with clear distaste. “She said Kreacher was to wash all of Master’s clothes; that Master wanted all washed except for what she brought for him.”
“Yes!” Teddy nodded firmly, widening his eyes excitedly. “Draco wouldn’t let me, but you will! Please, Harry? Can we fly higher?”
He did not understand why, suddenly, he felt so nervous—why his heart was thrumming so loudly within his chest.
Malfoy sneered, straightening as he took in Harry’s hesitation, eyes roaming his frozen body, “Ah, you thought I wouldn’t realize. Of course I would, Potter. You are always so sure of everything. But you know
“Hey,” Harry murmured, smiling shyly. He wriggled around under the sheets, moving closer to Draco so that their heads rested atop the same pillow.
With everyone else preoccupied during the week, and Harry left alone to his own devices, he was vibrating with excitement when the following weekend finally arrived. On Saturday morning, Harry leapt from his bed and rushed to his bathroom to get ready. He did not need to be at Andromeda’s until after lunch, but with no other pressing concerns, and eager to see Teddy, Harry got ready quickly and Apparated to the countryside by 10:00 am.
Teddy sighed, kicking briefly at the ground in his frustration, before looking back at Malfoy. “Okay...but you
You take a deep breath, gasping for oxygen, as fire begins to lick at your skin again, teasing as it begins to encompass you.
“Look at you!” George roared, laughing as he picked Teddy up and threw him into the air. Teddy squealed, his arms windmilling wildly as he hovered for a moment, George casting a wandless levitation charm, before falling and being caught by the freckled man. “Why, if it isn’t the newest Weasley!”
Malfoy tilted his head, crossing his arms as he leaned back against the counter. His bright eyes slowly ran down Harry’s body before lazily making their way back up to stare resolutely into Harry’s own.
,” Ron’s eyebrows rose nearly to his hairline, his eyes widening meaningfully as he stared at Harry, as if trying to transfer his thoughts by virtue of the intensity of his gaze alone.
Malfoy placed a gentle kiss against Teddy’s forehead before he stood up and turned towards the doorway. He did not meet Harry’s gaze, instead giving a curt nod before striding past with a soft, “Potter.”
“I’ll miss you, too,” Malfoy threaded his fingers through Teddy’s hair, which had begun to darken at the roots, black with only his signature turquoise at the tips.
Harry hesitated, biting sharply at his bottom lip. Andromeda had despised the feral Kneazle that he had rescued from the tree outside of her cottage earlier that year, despite Teddy’s clear love for the creature, and likely would not take kindly to Harry bringing Teddy home that evening with a new Kneazle.
“Er...I don’t know, Teddy. I think...maybe Draco is right.” Both of Draco’s eyebrows disappeared behind the fringe falling effortlessly across his forehead, lips parting in surprise. Harry coughed lightly and turned to smile at Teddy. “We can fly high after Quidditch Camp, how about that?”
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, “Yeah, well. I think we all know that herbology wasn’t ever going to be something I’d be good at. I never understood plants.”
“Yes,” Malfoy nodded once, eyes flickering towards the hallway. “I have rounds shortly, and am expected to meet with the attending Healer for updates prior to my shift.”
Draco softened his voice, smiling reassuringly at Teddy. “No, Tedward. I did not stay in the guest room.”
Harry was between jobs that week, having quit Hannah’s café. His friends were all busy with their own careers, so he found himself alone for most of the week, contemplating what he would try next.
Malfoy’s nimble fingers reached for Teddy’s, covering the smaller digits as he kneaded the dough, forming the crumbles that would sit atop the dessert.
Harry threw his head back and laughed. He bent down and hefted Teddy onto his hips, summoning the trunk to his side. “Of course. Are you ready?”
Crossing his arms firmly across his chest, the cloth of his shirt straining against his biceps, Malfoy narrowed his eyes once more. “So I ask you again, Potter. What are you playing at? In case it has escaped your notice, we are no longer at Hogwarts. This is not sixth year. I am not up to anything.”
“Do you think that Gary missed me, Harry?” he asked, jumping from his seat to begin clearing the table.
Gary meowed, crouching close to the ground and shifting his hips as he prepared to jump. With a graceful movement, he leapt into the air and landed lightly on Harry’s shoulder, nipping at his ear.
Harry looked over at Hermione, dumbstruck. He could understand Luna’s forgiving nature. However, hearing both Ron and Hermione sound like they could put the past behind them when it came to Malfoy...he didn’t understand what was going on.
jogging bottoms aside,” Ron huffed. “Harry...come on. You’ve been obsessed with the git since we were kids.”
“So, Malfoy...” Harry cleared his throat, running a hand through his hair only for his fingers to get caught in the strands. Exasperatedly, he shook his hand in an effort to quickly release it from the curls, stumbling slightly and catching himself against the table.
, is that it? What, you think I don’t know you’re watching me? You’re even more obvious now than you were at Hogwarts.”
Teddy sighed heavily as he nodded, “Alright.” He reached up, fingers grasping desperately before Malfoy let out a soft huff of laughter and leaned down to embrace the boy. “I love you, Draco.”
Harry groaned, resting his elbows against his knees as he leaned forward, fingers grasping desperately at his hair.
Harry shifted below him, turning to lay on his stomach, arms folded beneath a pillow and legs spread. He rolled his hips, gasping at the friction of his cock rubbing against smooth sheets.
Harry blinked his eyes open, disoriented for a moment as the world blurred before him. His fingers twitched, feeling soft flesh, the warm body pressed against his chest squirming at the touch. He grinned, turning his face into Draco’s neck as he wrapped his arm more firmly around the other man, curling against his back.
“And you think that he—” He paused, trying to comprehend everything that Hermione had said. “You think that me calling him
Harry grimaced before warily glancing towards the man next to him. George hadn’t mentioned what happened at the pub earlier in the week, but he had a feeling that reprieve would not last much longer.
Harry glanced at Andromeda, nodding in confirmation, before looking back at Teddy, whose head was buried in the side of Gary’s small body. He could feel eyes watching him curiously from the other side of the room and hesitated before turning to meet the mercurial gaze.
“Of course,” George nodded, pushing himself from the counter with a sharp nod. “In fact, he was just telling me how he planned on bringing you to Magical Menagerie before heading home.”
“Wait, what?” Harry’s heart began thundering against his chest. He leaned forward, placing his hands atop his thighs and digging his nails into them, relishing the sharp prick of pain that reminded him this was real. “What do you mean,
“Go on, now, Teddy. Go finish your reading while I prepare lunch. I will call you when it is ready.”
“But I wanted to have some crumble,” Teddy shrugged, swallowing the last of his mouthful. “It’s nearly done, anyway...and it looks so good.”
Knowing that he couldn’t back out of this, not if he wanted to keep any of his dignity, Harry nodded once. “Alright. You’re on, Weasley.”
tradition sacred to the Black family, Harry had the tendency to give in and let the old elf have his way.
Ron suddenly sat up straight, nearly knocking his glass of wine over in his excitement. “What about Hannah’s café?”
Staring curiously as Malfoy turned, bending to place the crumble back into the oven to brown, Harry found himself wondering when Malfoy got so tall. The deep blue shirt he was wearing pulled tightly against the breadth of his shoulders, tucked neatly into his jeans—and if
“You seem quite distracted, Harry. I thought I saw a wrackspurt zooming around earlier. Would you like me make sure it hasn’t infected you?” Luna’s melodic voice broke Harry’s daze. Blinking quickly, he turned to look at her and offered a sheepish smile.
Teddy was standing atop a stool at the counter, fingers kneading the flour concoction in front of him. Malfoy stood at his side, a wide grin splitting his lips as he bent over and placed a dish into the oven next to him.
The remainder of their weekend passed quickly, and it was late when Harry brought Teddy back to Andromeda’s on Sunday evening. Harry and Andromeda made promises to catch up the following Saturday, and with a gentle kiss to Teddy’s forehead, Harry returned home.
“This,” Draco nodded to the sink full of dishes and to Harry washing them by hand. “Correct me if I am wrong...but I do recall that it seemed as if you were quite perplexed when you caught me washing dishes the muggle way. And yet, it appears that you are doing the exact same thing.”
“Oh. Alright,” Harry nodded quickly, chewing at his bottom lip and shoving his hands awkwardly into his jeans pockets. “Well, er...I suppose I’ll see you another time, then.”
“What kind of a man would I be, Harry, if I did not teach my own dear cousin how to fly?” Draco smirked, one sharp canine pressing on his bottom lip in what Harry was
Draco hummed behind him and Harry straightened quickly, spinning around to find Draco biting his lips, pupils blown as he watched Harry appreciatively.
Harry startled at the sound of his name on Malfoy’s lips. Inhaling sharply, he turned to look at the other man, whose shoulders were stiff where he knelt before Teddy.
Malfoy inhaled sharply, his cheeks beginning to flush. Aglow with guilt, Harry thought, as he stared at the rosy blush.
Harry scrambled off of Draco, nearly tripping out of the bed as he pulled his shirt over his head and unbuttoned his jeans, shimmying out of his jeans before bending over and tugging his pants to the floor.
“What?!” He sputtered, eyes flickering between the two before his gaze narrowed in on Malfoy.  “Alright, that is
“Was he, now?” Andromeda’s eyes glinted with what Harry thought must have been amusement as she looked between the two men.
Draco stopped in front of Harry, gazing down at him. They were close—Harry could feel Draco’s breath against his skin. Harry inhaled sharply. His tongue darted out, wetting his lips as his eyes flickered across Draco’s face, before he tugged his bottom lip into his mouth.
Draco looked ethereal in the evening light, and Harry’s breath caught as he stared up at him—fair hair disheveled and cheeks flushed with want. He hungrily eyed the long lines of Draco’s pale throat, the sharp dips of his collarbones, the silvery scars crossing his—
to him. Apparently I’m not as good at it as you are.” He laughed quietly, rubbing the back of his neck.
Draco laughed, smooth as treacle, and Harry shivered at the sound, his fingers twitching at his side, aching to reach out.
With an exasperated sigh, Malfoy rolled his eyes towards the ceiling before locking his eyes with Harry’s and slowly, but clearly, mouthing the word
You gasp, choking on a sob as you pull oxygen into your lungs. The last air in the room before Fiendfyre consumes it all.
“No!” Teddy shook his head, biting his bottom lip as he pulled away from Andromeda’s hold, reaching out until his small hand enveloped Malfoy’s. “You have to say you’re sorry, Harry. You have to say you’re sorry to Draco.”
Harry felt as if an icy hand had clenched around his heart and dragged it down into the pit of his stomach, while his veins simultaneously thrummed with a warmth that spread through his entire body. He inhaled sharply, feeling his eyes begin to water as he tried to think of what he could possibly say.
Teddy squealed, rushing towards them. He jumped onto the bed and wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, placing a wet kiss against his cheek, before scrambling across the bed and bestowing the same treatment upon Harry.
Teddy spun on his heels, stumbling slightly before he balanced himself, to look at Harry. “Harry, he’s going to come over! We’re going to have a
Malfoy gracefully flicked his wrist, a handkerchief materializing between his fingers. He pressed the cloth against the rim of the vial, tilting it so that the potion could saturate the handkerchief, before drawing it away again.
Malfoy startled slightly, as if he had only just realized that Harry was there. He slowly deposited Teddy on the ground with a subtle nudge of his shoulder, pushing him gently towards Andromeda before turning to look straight at Harry.
“I want to fuck you.” Draco bit at the lobe of Harry’s ear before placing a tender kiss to his jaw. “Gods, Harry, you’re gorgeous like this. Let me make you feel good.”
“Of course he did, Ted,” Harry nodded, rubbing his hand against Teddy’s hair as he picked up a stack of dishes. “Gary will be glad to see you. He’s quite bored of me, now.”
Teddy sniffed softly as he pulled away, offering a shaky smile to his cousin before he turned towards Harry. “Alright. We can go now.”
“No, you’re not,” Draco stated as he strode towards him. Pale fingers reached out, carefully wrapping around Harry’s wrist and pulling it from where it held his torso. “Here. Let me help.”
“Yes, yes,” Harry nodded, running a shaky hand through his wet hair as he caught his breath. “Er, you asked me something? When I was in the shower?”
Harry laughed, tightening his grip around Teddy’s hand reassuringly. “It’s alright, Tedward. I will just assume that he taught you
They both pushed off from the ground, shooting into the air. Teddy’s broom hovered a few feet above the gardens, limited by the training charms embedded in it. Harry circled above him for a moment before making his way to Teddy’s side.
“You will?” Harry asked curiously, though he immediately regretted it when Draco sent a chilly glare his way.
“Well, yes. I mean....Merlin, Malfoy, the only time we ever needed it was at the bloody Yule Ball in fourth year. And that was for
“Shit—” Harry spat, pulling at the handle of his broomstick in a belated effort to prevent himself from crashing. Frantically, Harry swerved to the side. His eyes caught on Draco’s, wide and horrified, before they collided.
Draco gasped, dropping his head and biting into Harry’s shoulder as his hips stuttered. Harry could feel the warm rush of Draco’s release and he groaned, grinding himself back on Draco’s cock. He released his grasp from Draco’s hair, one hand intertwining with Draco’s on his cock as he chased his own climax.
Harry lunged forward, cutting Draco off as he slotted their mouths together. He ran his hands across Draco’s firm back, clenching at the shirt stretched tightly across broad shoulders.
“Potter...” Malfoy’s throat worked with a strained swallow, and Harry watched as his Adam’s apple dipped with the movement, a bright flush making its way up Malfoy’s neck. “Your
Harry watched curiously as Malfoy’s face flushed a deep red, his eyes widening as he stared at Teddy.
“Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry snorted, “Must you always be such a bloody drama queen? You missed it entirely, you git.”
Teddy’s morphed silver eyes, flickering as color began to bleed back around his irises, remained fixed on Harry. He stood adamantly next to Malfoy, clutching his cousin’s pale hand.
“The reason that no one else danced during that waltz at the Yule Ball was because they were so hypnotized by what an absolute fool
. In his efforts to try to persuade Harry with his dramatics, Teddy had morphed into perhaps the most theatrical person that Harry knew. He could recognize, now, how much Teddy resembled Draco in that moment.
They were so eager for Harry to find his career, having both found something that they were passionate about so soon after the war, while Harry had struggled to find his place. He forced a grin, raising his Firewhisky in acquiesce.
“Must I—what?” Harry swallowed his mouthful, glancing around the table as he tried to figure out what he was being scolded for.
that you had to abandon Teddy? Updating your ridiculous wardrobe, perhaps?” Malfoy’s jaw was beginning to clench as he grit his teeth. “Mm, no. Nothing as mundane as that. Maybe you were out with that wizard again, hmm? I forget what the
Closing his eyes, Teddy furrowed his brows as he concentrated. For a few moments, nothing happened. Gary’s tail flicked from side to side before he stood on his hind legs, propping his front paws against Teddy’s chest with a meow as he lifted his small head closer to Teddy’s own.
Harry sped after him, following the sound of Draco’s cackles on the wind as he leaned forward on his broom, pursuing Draco in earnest.
“Well, I don’t know yet, do I?” Harry muttered petulantly, not understanding why Ron and Hermione weren’t taking this seriously, “I’ve only just seen him there! Who knows how long he’s been going there—and what was Andy thinking, even allowing him into her home in the first place?”
As he watched the flames licking at the hearth, Hermione and Ron beginning a soft conversation to his side, Harry’s mind drifted.
“Are you ready?” Harry asked, grinning as Teddy nodded his head frantically. Reaching for Teddy’s hand, Harry tossed the powder into the hearth. He called out, “Grimmauld Place,” and they stepped into the flames.
“You know that I love you, Harry. You are a wonderful godfather to Teddy and I will forever be grateful that you have been there when his parents could not be. But let me make myself clear,” her voice lowered, cutting through the room with the precision of a
A soft gasp escaped Teddy’s lips as he approached the Kneazles, his brown eyes wide and flickering between all of the creatures in front of him.
Wiping his suddenly damp hands against his jeans, Harry stood up and began to clear the table. He was washing the dishes, setting a freshly cleaned plate to the side, elbow deep in soapy water, when Draco and Teddy entered the kitchen.
“But...how?” Harry frowned, confused. He had only just realized how he felt about Draco. How was it possible that Andromeda not only knew, but had for a
The following weekend, Harry made sure to Apparate to Andromeda’s well before he was expected to pick up Teddy. He had never seen Malfoy there before, but had since realized he may have simply missed Malfoy’s visits to the cottage.
Malfoy gracefully unfolded from his position on the floor, standing in one smooth movement as he brushed imaginary lint from his trousers. Teddy’s eyes morphed back to a bright amber as they flickered between Harry and Malfoy. He began to chew nervously his lower lip before turning towards Harry, a question in his shining eyes.
Harry slowly stumbled down the stairs, narrowly avoiding catching himself in the spider web at the top of the landing, as he made his way towards the smell of greasy breakfast foods wafting from the kitchen.
“Thanks for the vote of confidence, Ron,” Harry reached for his wine glass, watching as Ginny excitedly spoke to Hannah through green flames of the Floo, before throwing back the rest of his drink.
Staring at the dessert, Harry’s lips twitched as he recalled walking in on Teddy and Malfoy—or Draco, he supposed, now that they were beginning to get along—in their efforts to bake.
Teddy laughed, wrapping his arms tightly around Harry’s neck as they made their way into the Burrow, the warmth of food and love enveloping them immediately upon crossing the threshold.
A sharp knock on the bathroom door startled Harry, and he slipped in his effort to push himself from the shower wall.
“I did,” Draco agreed. He reached out to cup Teddy’s head in his hand, running a thumb under Teddy’s eyes to wipe away his tears.
Ginny blushed, freckles disappearing as her cheeks reddened, and she looked away. “Well, we met at the Gala for St. Mungo’s. The healers have been so helpful to the  Harpies—you know, whenever we were injured during a match and needed rehabilitation—and we attended to offer our support. All of the Quidditch teams were invited.”
As they ate, Andromeda asked how Harry’s latest venture was going, and he shrugged, flushing with embarrassment as he focused on his meal. He did not want to admit to yet another failure of a career when Malfoy was sitting directly across from him.
Harry and Teddy stayed silent in the sitting room, listening to the soft echoes of Malfoy’s footsteps as he walked through the cottage. The front door creaked as it was opened and then shut, a soft
After the Harpies scrimmage, Ginny and Angelina had come down to talk to Harry and Teddy. As soon as Angelina had mentioned that the Harpies would host a Quidditch Camp for wizarding children in two weeks time, Teddy had spun to Harry. His hair had bled of all color so quickly that Harry barely blinked and it was platinum blond, amber eyes shining as he reached both hands forward to clutch at one of Harry’s.
” Draco groaned loudly, throwing his head back against the pillow and reaching down to thread his fingers through Harry’s curls. He tugged lightly, fingers spasming as Harry sucked, before simply resting them against Harry’s skull, holding him and gently massaging his scalp.
every time that he overtook one of their pawns. He cackled, rolling onto his back and kicking his legs whenever Draco drew a ‘
They settled into an easy rhythm. Harry sliced all of the foods while Malfoy assembled them atop the hob. Teddy placed the top layer of bread upon the toasties before Malfoy gracefully flipped them to brown on the opposite side and then lifted them from the cooktop to settle on the serving plate.
Harry groaned, running his hands through his tousled hair as he glared at the ceiling. He had been so sure that Malfoy had been up to something. It had been the only thing that made sense. And yet, Harry could recognize that it was possible he may have been not
divulge, thank you—“ Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry, just as he had begun to ask what bargain was made. “Anyway, we have reached a ceasefire, if you will, and that is all that I have to say on the matter.”
“That’s wonderful, Teddy,” Harry said through gritted teeth, keeping a gentle hand on his godson’s shoulder. “Why don’t you go and see how lunch is coming along while I talk to Malf—er, Draco for a moment?”
“Yes, I know, but what does that have to do with anything?” he asked, gaze flickering to Ron and Ginny to see if they were as dumbfounded as he felt. They both merely stood there, watching the exchange with obvious amusement.
As they stepped across the edge of the Quidditch pitch, the protective wards shivering around them, Harry clutched Teddy’s hand tightly.
As Gary caught the string, rolling onto his back and gnawing at it while Teddy stroked his belly, Teddy snapped his head up excitedly to look at Harry.
They finished their meals, and while Teddy licked the last of his crumble from his plate, Andromeda rose from her chair.
oblivious?” He questioned, turning his head and nipping at Harry’s ear. “You wanted to know why Jesse didn’t like you?”
“Teddy cares about you, and I can see you care about him,” Harry slowly extended one hand, staring determinedly into Malfoy’s vibrant eyes. “So, I figured...it’s been five years. Why don’t we just...start over? For Teddy.”
Ginny let out a snort of laughter, her hand flying towards her mouth to prevent any wine from spilling in her mirth.
Harry’s lips curled in a soft smile as he watched Teddy race around on his training broom. Ron and George hovered on either side of the gardens, guarding their improvised Quidditch posts, while Ginny and Draco darted around him, feinting one way and then another as they tried to distract the boy from his goal. Jesse was watching closely from the ground, ready to attend any injury that may be inflicted.
On the front page of the Society section was an image of Malfoy, dressed primly in well-fitted robes. His eyes sparkled, a smile pulling at his lips as he gracefully lifted a flute of champagne and took a slow sip, eyes roaming lazily around what must have been a ballroom, the location of some gala or fancy soirée.
Teddy smiled shakily, one dimple pulling at his left cheek as his eyes began to water. His head jerked in an uncoordinated nod. “Yes! Yes—Draco calls me Tedward!”
Harry moved to help prepare lunch, listening as Teddy began to run down the halls to join them. If Andromeda was so enamored with Malfoy, Harry would have to be more calculating as he discovered Malfoy’s deceptions.
“Oh!” Teddy suddenly exclaimed, standing straighter and pulling back slightly from the cage. His eyes were wide, focused on a small Kneazle who was watching him from the corner.
The sudden sound of game pieces rolling together, summoned to organize themselves back into their box, echoed in the quiet room, and Harry turned to watch as Draco charmed the game back into order. Draco stood in front of the hearth, the warmth of the fire reflecting off of his pale blond hair, making him nearly glow in the light of the flames.
“Yes, Ginny,” Harry stared firmly up at Ginny, praying that she didn’t lose her temper and make Teddy more frantic than he already was. “It happens.”
Draco cleared his throat softly, and Harry looked up at the polite noise. Draco was gazing blankly to the side of Harry, at the exit to the sitting room, refusing to meet his eyes. His jaw twitched, as if he were clenching his teeth together.
They were silent for a moment, watching each other, before Harry slowly nodded. “Alright...I’ll ask him.”
Turning back to Malfoy and Teddy, he paused, watching as Malfoy ran a dampened tea towel over Teddy’s mouth, cleansing it of any remaining crumbs. The two grinned at one another, Malfoy whispering too quietly for Harry to hear, followed quickly by a peal of laughter from Teddy as a wide grin spread across his face.
“Come on, Harry!” Teddy called, rushing through the hallways on his way to the garden. “Let’s go fly!”
He had also never felt as heated during the Yule Ball as he did now. Though surely that was only because Hogwarts would have had excellent cooling charms in place on account of the amount of students in the Great Hall, whereas Andromeda’s cottage was not charmed for such activity.
“Well, er...I mean, he obviously adores you,” Harry shrugged, raising one hand to scratch the back of his neck—he could feel sweat beginning to bead along his skin. Andromeda should really have the stove looked at, as it was obviously emitting far too much heat. “And you’ve always been rather...dramatic, I suppose. He’s probably just...mimicking that.”
“Harry...we are going to start a permanent Quidditch Camp for kids,” she said slowly, staring at him with wide brown eyes. When he did not respond, she huffed. “Alright, let me make this perfectly clear. The Harpies want to hold a monthly Quidditch Camp for kids to start learning how to fly and play. We will need volunteers, but we will also need regular staff to help organize it since we won’t be able to during our season.”
“Thank you,” Harry said sharply, turning to make his way toward Room 7. He ran a hand gently over Teddy’s back as he strode down the hallway, whispering soothing words in an effort to calm his godson’s whimpers.
“Master should always be aware of what is important in the Wizarding World,” Kreacher lectured, one bulbous eye twitching subtly as he glared at Harry.
“What!?” Harry cried out. His jaw dropped, mouth agape as he watched his godson fly off, Teddy’s laughter alight in the breeze.
Andromeda offered a quick smile and nod. Malfoy squeezed Teddy’s shoulder one last time before he turned and strode away, not sparing a single glance towards Harry.
“What else would he be doing at Andy’s?” Harry exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air in exasperation. He didn’t understand how his friends couldn’t see how serious this was.
“It’s not the job of the day, Andy, you know that,” Harry huffed. He’d been floating between jobs since the war, trying to determine what he wanted to do with his career. He still hadn’t found anything that truly intrigued him, but he didn’t mind as it allowed him more time to spend with his godson.
“But you fell from so high up!” Teddy whimpered, burying his head into Harry’s neck, blond curls tickling his nose.
A soft smile tugged at the man’s lips as he nodded back to the creatures in front of them. “Oh, you just know. A connection is formed. It’s unmistakable.”
“Oh, I am certain that you would be,” Andromeda grinned, looping her arm through Harry’s and leading him towards the sitting room. “Teddy and Draco are in the drawing room. Teddy was adamant that Draco help with his painting upon his arrival this morning. Why don’t we have a cup of tea while we wait for them to join us?”
“I know,” Teddy sighed, rubbing his face against Andromeda’s leg before raising silver eyes towards Harry.
“Yes, darling,” Andromeda ran comforting fingers through Teddy’s turquoise hair, “He often does. You know he has to, though.”
Shakily, Harry released his breath, running a hand through his messy curls as he heard Teddy start to call for him from the garden, reminding himself that this
“Oh,” Teddy heaved a deep sigh as he turned back to watch the Kneazles. He placed both hands on the cage, leaning forward until his nose squished against the barriers, before whispering, “I wish one would recognize
“I’m not sure, Tedward.” Draco turned, reaching for a towel and drying his hands before kneeling down to look at Teddy eye-to-eye. “I have shifts on Monday and Tuesday, so I may not be able to see you until Wednesday.”
She thought Teddy wanted to—instinctively—do what he could to make Harry happy? He huffed in bemusement, placing a quick kiss to Teddy’s forehead as he pulled the boy against him in a quick hug.
Andromeda and Teddy were kneeling in the dirt in front of the vegetable garden, speaking softly to one another as they observed the ripe produce, their backs to Harry. He paused for a moment, quickly looking around to spot where Malfoy was lurking, and frowned when he did not spot him.
“I’m not sure,” Ron interjected, furrowing his brows, “Yeah, you’re decent with creatures. But do you really think you want to
Draco tore his lips from Harry’s own, nipping at skin as he kissed his way down Harry’s neck. “Harry—”
. It’s just...” Ginny hesitated, wrinkling her nose as she decided whether or not to proceed. After a moment, she whispered, “He doesn’t want to see Draco hurt.”
The room was silent for a few moments, no sounds beyond the distant echoes of Teddy’s voice as he spoke to Andromeda down the hallway and their own soft breaths.
“Yes. Be brave, and all of that. Now I must be off,” Ginny snickered. She paused, turning back to look intently at Harry. “I expect you to be at the Burrow for brunch on Sunday, though. I’m bringing Jesse...I’ll need you there so Mum doesn’t lose her mind. After all, I haven’t brought anyone home since—“
Harry hesitated for a moment before he pushed himself from the wall and entered the kitchen. Teddy was leaning against Andromeda’s leg, head buried in her thigh.
“There’s guest rooms. Here. If you wanted one—to stay the night, that is. Er...I’m sure Teddy would love it if you were here when he wakes up.”
Harry could feel his cheeks flaming. He shifted awkwardly in place, casting a quick glance to Malfoy who was focused determinedly on Teddy.
His voice is hushed, but deadly—echoing in your ears with the violence of a wildfire. His thumb rubs circles against your mark.
“Malfoy was just showing me the proper techniques,” Harry interjected with a groan as he pushed himself up from the ground. As he stood, he glanced at Malfoy to find the other man staring at him in shock. Harry frowned before he realized
As his fingers dipped downward, Harry slowed, letting them linger in the hair below his navel, pulling gently at the strands. It had been days since his last wank, weeks since his last pull. Between early mornings at the cafe this week, visits with his friends, and spending as much time as he could with Teddy, he had been too exhausted whenever he had a moment alone.
“What do you mean?” Harry pressed. He could not leave this conversation as it was—he needed to know something more, something that would settle his heart, beating rapidly against his chest.
“Of course they are, for wixen. But with creatures, it’s more complicated,” Hermione set her cutting knife down, turning towards Harry, her eyes sparkling with the excitement of a complicated case. “Creatures have their own systems in place that operate outside of Wizarding Law. House elves, vampires, Veela, werewolves—all of them. For werewolves, they have a pack—other werewolves and beings that they are tied to. It’s like a family, but instead of being connected by blood relations they’re connected by an inherent bond that forms. A found family, if you will.”
“We’ll give you two some space. I’ll see you later, Draco.” Harry waved a hand as he turned, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes as he and Ron made their way to the outskirts of the pitch.
“Well, what is this?” Draco drawled. Harry turned his head to the side, his throat drying at the sight of the other man. Standing just across the threshold, Draco held Teddy securely against his hip. He was wearing worn jeans, which did
“I told you!” Harry stepped backwards until he was pressed against the wall, lifting his hands in front of him. “We were flying—practising for Quidditch Camp this weekend—and he turned too sharply. I didn’t reach him in time and he fell. But...he’s okay, now. You fixed him!”
Teddy reached up and took a hold of Ginny’s proffered hand, waving back at Harry and Draco before being lifted onto Ginny’s broom and speeding away to re-join the activities.
Harry’s throat dried up, his words were stuck. Hagrid would know something was up right away if he turned him down. But he couldn’t keep his company waiting any longer – that was if he was actually there. “No, not today, sorry Hagrid.” He blurted.
“Please, Harry,” he said, clearly exasperated one night. Harry’s eyes were bloodshot from smoking something and was laying on Ron’s four-poster attempting to stop all of the loose objects in the room from shaking.
“Draco,” he offered carefully in response. No sense being impolite in the belly of the beast. “How can you tell it’s only in name? I’ve never seen this before.” Bill stepped up next to him for a closer examination. He smelled like an old library.
Ah. He knew Harry was still angry about that while Draco had been trying to let go his feelings of hurt towards Snape. It got him out one way or the other, didn’t it? Draco chose to ignore the guilty look his godfather was sending his way. “Can we be excused from class? I need to take him to the Hospital Wing once this settles down. I seem to be the only thing anchoring him at the moment.”
“Going turncoat didn’t automatically absolve him of his prior sins? Fancy that.” Draco reached for his cup of tea as he said, “What, he wants me to testify? I doubt he’ll like what I have to say.”
The door then unlocked to Remus and Draco’s relief. Remus opened the door and almost passed out when he saw what greeted him. ‘Get a grip,’ he mentally shook himself. It was Harry, but not at all Harry. In fact, he looked more like a replica of Sirius Black but with green eyes and glasses. Realization crossed Remus’s face. “Oh Harry,” he lamented.
She caught his eye as she made her way to the Slytherin table and winked, causing Draco to flush. “Yeah,” he replied, “that’s Pans, alright.”
“You could always Apparate with us and walk from Hogsmeade,” Sirius suggested. Sirius and Remus were joining faculty this year and Harry was thrilled to have them coming back to school with him. However, just because he was now a teacher’s kid, it didn’t suddenly mean he didn’t want to take the train, though.
And then, one by one, the rest of the room stood with Kingsley, raising their glasses. He glanced at Molly whose eyes were shining with unshed tears and it was almost too much too bear.
Harry nodded. “I guess I never thought that your senses could work in that way.” He had been agonizing over Draco’s immortality as of late and the thought of being marked making that issue go away intrigued him. “How does the mark work?”
Ron was doing his best to distract him, able to pick up the gloom radiating off of him. Ron was a good friend. Harry felt badly for blowing up at him all summer—his version of mourning truly was explosive.
“This is ridiculous,” Harry said, sitting haphazardly on the nearby bench next to Regulus. “He can’t lock me up here forever.”
“Why don’t you just tell Draco you need a break? He won’t be upset.” he asked shortly after Draco left the Black library to shower. The three of them were doing research on werewolf complications via Draco’s request. The moons have only been getting worse for him, and without Remus willing to bite him, he was left to his own devices to find a solution. Luckily, the Black library was well stocked with tomes of all subjects and they had their work cut out for them.
“Because … because you’re in my face.” Harry gritted, trying to sound harsh. To Draco, he was like a frightened little mouse. His little mouse.
Potter’s eyes widened, he appeared disheartened. Exactly what Draco intended because he knew that’s when he would get what he wanted. He smirked as Harry gripped hold of his robes once again and stood on tip-toe to have a go at his mouth. When Harry rested his crotch over Draco’s, he found another delicious sensation – tingly and warm, he wanted to get on top of his lover and grind himself against him. In the next instant, Draco had Harry’s zipper in his grasp and was tugging down his pants.
“Y-yessss,” Harry hissed as more moans escaped. But soon he was a panting, moaning mess as he begged his ex-enemy to pound him as firmly as he possibly could. Then Draco couldn’t hold it any longer and shot warm cum inside Harry – who’d been edged enough that night, and the last two weeks for that matter, and ejaculated harder than he’d ever done in his entire sexual life.
They paused abruptly to check for any echoing footsteps. Silence. They were still safe. Harry just wanted to sit in Draco’s lap again and dribble poetic words in his ears, making sure he knew for once how much Harry felt for him.
Draco leaned his forehead against Harry’s, not once breaking eye contact. It was extremely intimidating to Harry, but being so close to the boy he was sure he loved was something special. His skin burned with every touch of Draco’s icy fingertips – burned, fizzed, and melted.
“I think,” he panted as Harry’s lips reached his palm. “It’s been established that we cannot stay away from each other.”
Draco shivered at those keen words. Harry’s words had once stung him, now they brought him comfort in the most desperate times. Everything was so sheer right now that he almost spilled, ‘I love you.’
It was hard to even think with Draco’s hands working their way to a steady jerk. Harry desperately reached out again and this time, Draco pushed his cock between Harry’s fingers. They jerked each other off, slow at first, then vigorous until Harry cried out for Draco to stop because he did not want to orgasm yet. Draco released Harry and tugged his arm, coaxing him to sink to the ground with him. The ghostly moon disappeared behind wisps of clouds, so there was no more light source, they had to rely completely on touch to guide them.
“Stop asking me silly questions,” Draco growled when he leaned down to Harry’s ear. His lips brushed against the lobe, and Harry felt tender vibrations below his navel. Draco’s hands took the sides of Harry’s face so that he could have his special moment and drink in those beautiful gems. The emerald he adored so much – it was those eyes that kept him up at night. The eyes that always stared blankly back at him whenever he spat out another demeaning name, directed to either one member of the trio. His thumb skimmed over Harry’s lips and leaned in a fraction, meaning to devour them again, but pulling back at the last inch.
It was getting rather warm underneath the cloak, but he knew it was too risky to continue out in the open.
“Come in for a cuppa, won’ yer?” Hagrid asked, brushing off the last clump of leaves. They were rather difficult to detach this year, they seemed to be biting the roof so it would be harder to prise them off.
That, Harry, could not contradict without stumbling over his speech. He enveloped his arms around Draco’s thinning waist, then slipped his hands down his firm butt and into the back pockets of his school pants. Draco looked heavenly as usual, though the dark circles beneath his eyes were perceptible than ever and he couldn’t help but notice he was losing more weight.
Harry’s ears burned. But he did want Draco. He wished he could push the other boy away and tell him, “Of course not, you disgust me.” But the mere thought of going back to loathing Draco pained him.
The feeling was almost feverish. It was like a magnetic pull, a strong desire to launch himself over the table and throw himself in front of the silver-blonde boy. Ron clamped a hand on his arm which momentarily stopped him from acting on the pull.
It was the first Christmas in three years Harry had spent at Hogwarts instead of at the burrow. He noticed quickly that it was Draco’s first Christmas at Hogwarts when normally he would be spending it with his parents. Harry was intrigued as to why he wasn’t at home with his mother – it was now a fact that Lucius Malfoy was imprisoned in Azkaban. So he spent much of Christmas day stealing quick glances at Draco in the dining hall, watching him as he pulled a wizard’s Christmas cracker with Pansy Parkinson and boasted about his mountain of gifts. He caught Harry’s eye instantaneously when he wandered in and out of the hall, looking rather suspicious as his eyes shifted from side to side. A familiar urge to get up and follow him overpowered Harry, Draco always had his power turned up to the maximum voltage. But ever since he’d caught him with the blood of a curse on his hands, Harry struggled to trust him, even when his thoughts clouded over with blissful reveries. He wished he could just shake these feelings away, but everyone affected by Draco was no longer in their right minds.
Hagrid looked a little dispirited and Harry wasn’t sure whether that was because of the leafy creatures, or the fact he had turned down tea. But with an ‘oomph’, Hagrid finally prised off the rest of the clumps and gathered them all up into a neat pile.
The envisage of Harry cumming on Draco’s face made him call out and dig his nails further. Draco gasped and thrust harder, seizing Harry’s thighs to place them over his shoulders so he had a deeper attack.
Draco accidentally moaned out loud. He wasn’t supposed to but it turned out that Potter was exceptionally good at blowjobs. His own hips twitched and thrust as he grabbed fistfuls of hair and shoved himself extensively down Harry’s pharynx. His precum-coated tip poked the back of Harry’s throat as hot saliva oozed down the base, and he almost busted his load which would have satisfyingly made him choke and splutter.
“Oh, Merlin,” Harry whimpered as Draco swirled the tip of his tongue over the very top of Harry’s erection, lapping up more precum in the process.
Harry lowered his head to gently kiss Draco’s ribcage, then peppered those kisses along the valley of his chest. Draco let out a contented sigh and fingered Harry’s plight of hair.
Draco gripped Harry’s hips and dug his fingernails in deep. “But you seem to love me when I’m inside of you.”
Harry exhaled measuredly, noting he was in the clear now and whipped back around to continue the short journey.
“Isn’t it hot taking risks, though?” Draco sneered, taking his own rock-hard cock out of his underwear and rubbing it over Harry’s – which was now very much standing to attention with beads of precum at the tip. Draco leisurely stroked the girth, up and down, oh so slowly and sensually. He was sure to tease the living hell out of the hormonal eighteen-year-old. Harry’s cock twitched and he bucked his hips, trying to get more out of the handjob as he possibly could. Draco continued the tease show and started unbuttoning his shirt, again slowly exposing bits of white stomach and chest as his fingers delicately made their way up. His pants were partly undone as well, so Harry caught glimpses of his navel and flat stomach, which made his heart squeeze in anticipation.
Draco’s eyes widened, suddenly remembering. He opened his mouth to ask his father how but he was suddenly surrounded by Healers. They took a bunch of vitals, asked him what year it was, and instructed him not to move too much. He wasn’t given any information as to why he was so worse for wear. Maybe they didn’t know either.
Draco just rolled his eyes and smiled “Saved for now, Potter,” he murmured, which earned a blush from Harry.
Draco looked up to see James heading towards the duo. He still couldn’t believe that he was among the living once more, the same age he was on that fateful night all those years ago: the Potters truly had nine lives, Draco was convinced. “Morning, Mr. Potter,” he said with a grin, knowing just how to wind him up.
He was led to a doorway at the end of an unused hall. Surprisingly, Kingsley was at the front of the door in his Auror garb. “I don’t remember requesting detail?” Sirius said, tilting his head in confusion like a lost dog.
Luckily for him, Draco and Hermione were paired for rounds, leaving Ron to fend for himself with Pansy. Oddly, Ron didn’t make a fuss. In fact, the duo seemed to be working as a unit of protection for Draco. Was this friendship?
Sirius was staring at him in disbelief. James grimaced. “I really don’t think this is the case. Harry is alive, you said so yourself.”
in surprise—he hadn’t been as subtle as he thought with his exhaustion after all. “What do you mean?” he asked carefully.
“Fine,” Harry responded curtly, counting out lacewing flies carefully and doling them out into their own small vials.
As he watched the two settle into a corner of his room and unpack Harry’s feelings, Draco just knew he had to be released in time to get Harry to the garden for the winter holiday. They were only two weeks away. He was more determined to get himself walking and casting at normal levels again.
“I have a choice in this?” he asked, surprised after his conversation with Dumbledore just a few short weeks ago.
His mother, sensing the malaise Draco was now experiencing, pulled him aside over the Winter Holiday while on a shopping venture, away from the darkened and suffocating Manor. “Get out,” she commanded. “I’ve made my choice, you should be able to make your own as well.” Despite Draco’s protests of not wanting to leave his mother, who he had grown quite inseparable from, Narcissa had convinced him to seek out Dumbledore for asylum without his father knowing. His heart hurt thinking about her now, but she probably saved his life.
“I’m being dead serious I assure you.” Sirius immediately cringed when he realized the bad pun. “Sorry. I’m being truthful.”
Harry came back into the room a few minutes later with the requested tea, which Draco took gratefully. “You do look good in green,” Draco commented, “suits your skin tone.”
Draco pulled his hands away again, feeling very tired. “I just don’t. Even though I forgive you about what happened it still messed me up. I can’t trust you like that again. I can’t let myself love you like that again. I’m not letting you hurt me again.”
“He and your mother were integral in bringing Voldemort down in the end—it doesn’t erase everything he’s done but we probably couldn’t get into Hogwarts without him.”
Remus led him to the elevator that took them to the Spell Damage unit, Draco’s heart in his stomach the entire time. His friend had been out of action since the battle over two weeks ago—he hoped that when he woke he’d still have his mind.
Sirius sighed at the comment, leaning back on his elbows. It was strange how much he and Harry looked alike, especially when Sirius took on a frown. “I’m a bit of a wreck on the inside, honestly. But that won’t do anyone any good now will it?” Sirius nudged the blonde gently, just as Remus had earlier that day. It was unsettling how much alike they could be at times. “Besides, I’ve gone through this before, just with a different cast of characters. Second time is just as disappointing but less surprising.”
Harry laughed. “Beats me.” His expression dropped to one of scrutiny as he looked over Draco’s shoulder to the entryway. “Is that Parkinson?” he asked.
She frowned, looking ahead and not meeting Draco’s eyes. “Well you and Blaise aren’t in Paris, are you? I wanted to come home.”
Sirius was happy to have the Molly by his side for once: it made the whole parenting process a little less lonely.
In the weeks that followed Harry’s sudden return to Black Manor, he was beginning to feel restless, cooped up with nothing to do but plan. His father was happy to make up any excuse necessary to keep Harry safe—he knew he and Hermione and Ron could do with a recharge before going into the Big Battle, but he couldn’t help but feel that their time was running out. Despite this, Harry’s compatriots served as a welcome, yet productive distraction from his malaise.
He was quiet on the train ride home, surrounded by people who will soon know that he had defected from his family. Would he even be safe in Slytherin come next fall? Would he even be able to return to school? He felt the wind knocked out of him as he imagined the gravity of his request. Does asylum mean being locked away? Would he have to take his NEWTs remotely? He suddenly didn’t feel as though he were in welcoming company and he was itching to run.
Harry, on the other hand, seemed unbothered by the interaction. Though he seemed not to be one who was physically affectionate with his friends, Draco noticed that the orphan in question was not embarrassed or phased by their moment of intimacy. In fact, he just carried on like his normal, very quiet unless enraged, self – bringing Draco food at Remus’s request as he once again found himself bedridden before the moon, this time via a Weasley. It was driving Draco spare.
“Might I suggest something?” Professor McGonagal asked. Harry nodded. “You may not be able to hold off the rumour mill very long, but by going by Black it might buy you some time. The professors certainly would have an easier time not slipping up. You look very much like-“
Harry stood abruptly as Remus gave Draco a warning glare. "Well good thing he isn't then, isn't it?" He huffed. "I'm sorry that you found life at the Manor to be too droll for you to deal with, but I'm here facing real problems and issues so don't think I want to sit here and listen to your unsolicited advice about what I should and shouldn't do. A bad day for you is waking up with messed up hair so excuse me if I don't feel like hearing any opinion about the shit I have to deal with."
“I don’t know why they’re even sending her,” Draco said, ignoring the first part of Remus’s comment. “Don’t they know it’s going to be overrun with horrible people?”
Turner held up a pink-colored potion. “Nutrition-potion. You need to take these at least once per day, twice if you find yourself skipping meals. These will bring your body back up to speed in a few weeks and you won’t need them after around a month or so, depending on how much magic you’re expending in healing that arm.”
“It was suffocating, right? That feeling of helplessness—we needed to do something. Especially with your familial ties. No matter what they said. Haz has even more of a reason to try and end this. You can’t clip his wings like that.”
Harry was rendered unable to speak, just staring at the person he’d been so consumed with guilt over for the past seven months. “’Lo, Sirius,” Draco said, standing to greet him.
Thanks for your feedback as to whether or not you would like to see a sequel--currently mind mapping it as we get closer to end of this one! Thanks for your support and happy reading!
“Should we all be so lucky,” she sighed. “At least your son doesn’t look like you anymore or else the world wouldn’t be able to tell you apart. This happened via the Garden of Souls?”
Harry nodded. “The malaise is still here, though. Bet that will take years to fade.” Ron nodded thoughtfully, but he was looking much better than he did the night prior, ready to face the world.
Harry sighed. “Nobody is sure. Remus thinks I had an adoption spell on me that changed my appearance. My full powers probably broke it down.”
“You have to understand that it’s not Sirius in the mirror and that it is you. You were able to reconcile this with James.”
“Good enough for me, I suppose. We’re not going to leave you hanging out to dry, you know. We’ll come see you. You’re not restricted from visitors.”
Harry settled down next to him in the overstuffed armchair that everyone tended to fight over. “Do you need anything? Tea for your sweets?” he asked, eyeing the basket.
Harry leaned back, feeling his full heritage for the first time. He was yet another defector to the Light in the grand scheme of the Black family. “Helping in restoring the family name, I suppose.”
Draco looked down at the bowl resting in his lap, willing himself to pick up the spoon. He frowned in frustration – he knew he wouldn’t be able to lift it; the room would not stop spinning long enough for him to focus. He slowly looked up at Harry, already burning with embarrassment. “Remus,” he managed to say, pleading with his eyes.
When the wedding arrived, the Ministry fell. Harry, Ron, and Hermione disapparated in the fallout, leaving Draco behind. Draco was heartbroken, left tucked away in the Manor with Sirius and Remus: it was almost too much to bear. He couldn’t understand why they didn’t take him with them but there was nothing to do now but wait for Harry’s return. It was devastating. He resolved to spend his time studying defensive and battle spells with Remus and Sirius. When the time came, he would be ready.
Blaise sighed, as though he had been waiting for this question to come for some time. He was able to skirt around the question when he first arrived and had attempted to steer the conversation away from the subject again. And he had been doing well at it—the two only really spoke about Quidditch, Draco’s healing magic progress, and what might be happening at Hogwarts as of late. “It didn’t feel right to go into hiding. I miss my parents so much but now is not a time for neutrality, you know?” he replied.
Harry laughed at that. “You know, I’ve been reading this book for so long trying to figure out what my Ithaca is. I couldn’t pick a place that I’ve ever called home.” Draco raised an eyebrow at that.
Draco sighed in frustration. “Don’t remind me. My chest is screaming at me.” It felt almost like the first few days of his healing process all over again, but slightly less painful.
“He’s going to lose it over your eye—destroying the Malfoy merchandise is a big no-no, remember when we tried to get those tattoos?”
“Uh, he is sitting right here and he could’ve managed,” Draco interrupted mid-chew, abandoning all table manners for the sake of deliciousness.
“So what if you did?” Harry challenged. “We can have this conversation as many times as you’d like but I’m still not going to change my mind about being with you. If you turn me, you turn me. It’s not a death sentence. It’s not the end of the world.” He pulled Draco into his arms, who collapsed onto his knees next to him. “Besides, two of the greatest men I know are werewolves. Can’t be all that bad.”
Remus did eventually slip out to give the family some space and Draco was filled in on some of what was going on at home. Not that he’d remember too much of it seeing as he was completely looped for most of the conversation. No, they weren’t in danger for leaving. Voldemort was travelling on some sort of important personal mission he didn’t trust anyone with. Yes, they would have risked it anyway to make sure he was safe. Lucius apologized hundreds of times on deaf ears. Draco wasn’t willing to forgive that yet but he’d let him fuss over him all he wanted. Draco was careful not to feed any important information back to them: just that he was doing well in school and was keeping himself safe despite landing himself in the hospital.
“You hurt me, Blaise,” Draco said, opting for honestly rather than saving face. Blaise winced at the confession.
of a place where he didn’t have to feign being 17. His excitement at the prospect of running away from everyone, for even just a few short hours, was short lived. “Nothing I have fits me now,” Harry said frowning. “I can’t very well go out in a robe. I think I’m destined to be trapped here.”
A slight breeze ruffled Harry’s relentlessly unkempt hair as he trudged down the sloping lawns. His face was shiny from the glare of the sun as it peeked behind conjoined clouds. He was sure everybody was turning to stare at him, watching him scurry towards the back of the prairie where the beginning of the deep forest resided. Some students raised their hands to wave, some smiled, others just greeted him warmly as he passed. Though absolutely nobody knew where he was off to, his paranoia continued to tell him otherwise. He passed Hagrid raking leaves off the roof of his hut, stopping to wave and greet Harry, probably assuming his favourite student was coming for tea. He had three large sacks placed in his yard, seemingly filled with autumnal critter leaves.
“Pomfrey says they’ll never heal,” Draco disclosed quietly. His voice was measured, but his eyes reflected emotional pain. Harry suddenly felt a pang of guilt; he’d been the one to cast the spell directly at him despite knowing the effects.
And then Harry convulsed into orgasm, feeling as though he was spinning through space. It was the best orgasm he had ever ridden through. Draco didn’t stop there, he rubbed at a spot on the inside of Harry’s left thigh, pulled out his wand and mumbled some sort of incantation which agonizingly seared the skin. The pain faded to reveal a small, black circular marking that, from Harry’s angle, looked like a serpent. Draco raised his eyes to meet the spectacled ones, his own heart burning with feeling … and ownership.
“You’re so fucking tight,” Draco gritted into Harry’s ear. His velvety voice caused Harry to impale himself deeper on him. He pushed himself right to the hilt. Draco moaned deeply and thrust out again. He slowly gyrated until they worked up a rhythm that both were comfortable with.
He had been told to venture into the middle of the forest because it was out of the way of prying eyes and curious whisperers. But Harry wasn’t sure seclusion was guaranteed here, not with the chance of running into a pack of centaurs or Acromantulas. A shiver rolled down his spine at the thought of Acromantula, but fear streaked him most when his mind came to the likes of werewolves and trolls. Shoving his hands into the pockets of his robes, he remembered why he was here in the first place. Something silky and emerald was wound between the fingers of his right hand deep in his pocket. He had something that did not belong to him, something rather disrespectful towards Gryffindor. Harry passed an ancient-looking oak tree, there was still time to change his mind; he could turn back without anyone ever knowing he had been there.
“You’re late, Potter,” Draco muttered, pushing himself off the wall and crossing his arms over his chest.
He glimpsed a tall figure in the dark, standing near where the entrance to the room of requirement should be. But there was no door, seal or any evidence of a hidden room on this floor. Harry was startled that nothing happened when he scuffled past. An entrance should emerge from the wall and stand prominent to anyone who summoned it. The figure jammed their hands in their pockets and leaned against the stone wall; their head bowed to the floor. Harry yanked the invisibility cloak off his body and; draped it over his right arm, he could feel his heart thump uncontrollably at the sight of the boy with the pointed face. The moment Draco looked at Harry, the full moon shone through a nearby window and cast a luminescent glow over his hair, making it appear silvery and glittery. Harry thought his features were that of an angel’s – with his smooth, pale complexion, full lips, pronounced cupid’s bow, iridescent grey eyes.
