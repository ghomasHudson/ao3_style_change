“Oh god, are you crying?” Potter stopped and bent down “Fuck, are you?”
“Don’t you see it?” Pansy stepped forward, making her way to Blaise and Ron’s spot, she opened Blaise’s jacket wide and Draco gaped when he saw the words on his inside shirt
“Yeah!” Dean grinned “Well, I went to a farm with Seamus for our honeymoon a year ago, and we
“Walter Mendoza, 33 years old, currently managing an art museum in Abergavenny, he has a former wife, Anthea Francis, and two kids, a 9 years old son, Duncan, and a 5 years old daughter, Tatianna, he split up with his wife two years ago and won child custody since his wife has an addiction problem, though she’s getting better, according to her mother” Draco eyed the room when he heard people whispering, he absolutely hated it when he’s talking in a meeting and other people think they could too, it was highly disrespectful. He glared at a certain raven-haired and redhead Aurors at the table “He was found dead in his own house last night, stabbed in the chest 11 times with a sharp knife on while he was sleeping” He heard some Aurors gasping at it, and yes, he almost threw up at the scene, it was bloody and scary, the smell was indescribable “Time of death is occurred around 11 at night to 2 in the morning, his kids were in the other bedrooms and didn’t hear any screaming, there were no sign of struggling and the door was locked from inside”
“The other Harry Potter?”
“Oh, a small dragon, a small Swedish short snout, now I don’t know where Pansy got it, but I suspect she called my brother”
“Because, Draco” Pansy put her quill down and sighed, her fingers twirling at her short black hair “You shut off every year, we get it, your mother…passed away on New Year, and it left you with a scar, you’re hurt, you always shut people off on new year. We tried every year, don’t you remember? It’s been five years, Draco, you never went with us”
“It’s just an offer” He shrugged, stepping back as Ron still kept his eyes on him “Have a good study date, you two” He turned on his heels and walked away
“I’m trying”
“It’s not a joke. I didn’t mean to make fun of you or embarrass you” Potter explained and retreated his hands from Draco’s shoulder “You know that, I’d never do such things, and you
not a good time for moaning right now, he picked up the clothes in his arms and felt a bit weird picking up his best mate’s dirty boxer
“Oh, oh” Hermione pulled out another box from her bag “You guys also have to pick one from here, it’s the month that you have to do”
“Nothing, just something on my mind”
“We don’t need to know that” Draco snickered softly
“Whe—when did you…why would you…” Draco stuttered, trying to form a full sentence, but Harry figured he was in too much of a shock “What…”
I think Draco's gay awakening has awaken all over again
“Well, you should have” Draco looked down, pouting his plum lips, huffing loudly “Because I also have been in love with you too”
“See, I know you’ll look good in it” Theo smiled and handed Colin the shirt “What do you have to pose with?”
Totally unrelated but in chapter 7 of Haven’s Taste, you can also notice a small detail where Hermione saw Harry and Draco holding hands in the pub even when they were talking to their friends on different topics.

” Draco gaped at them “How
“I know, I’m sorry, it’s just that I’ve been doing it for you since we got in Hogwarts together” Potter said softly, his voice rumbling from behind Draco “Sometimes you don’t like that too, you’d tell me you’re capable of doing it by yourself, but I guess I was just used to it”
Harry turned sideways to see Blaise changing the music into something slow and sexier. This couldn’t be…
“You just need to say it harder” Draco smirked, sitting down on the spot next to him “I thought you are used to it. Being famous and all, people must be all over you all the time, you should know how to say no”
“Er, so, I, I got something to tell you”
but you forgot”
He looked down at the guy with brown hair and greeted him “I’m sorry, but you have something that belongs to me” He said, grabbing Harry’s hands from the other guy’s grip
“I thought so too” Hermione sighed “You always wanted Harry’s attention”
“Harry, where are we going?” Draco put on Harry’s scarf around his neck and put a third layer on himself, seeing Harry at their bedroom door with a smile “It’s the coldest day of the month and you decided we should go out?” He knew it was their anniversary, they have been together for nine months and their original plan was to stay in and watch Muggles movies like Harry had suggested himself. He dragged himself to Harry’s spot and hooked his finger over his boyfriend’s collar “This better be worth it, Harry”
Draco turned back to him once Hannah was gone, he cupped Potter’s face and looked at him, the guy’s pupils were dilated, he was
“Do you, maybe want to…come over to my place? To have a cup of coffee? Or tea? Er, since your living room and your door are…ruined, I’m sorry again” Harry suggested all of a sudden, making Draco stared at him in disbelief. Was this an…invitation? Could it be that Harry liked him? Or was Draco totally paranoid? “I could call the building manager for you now so they can fix call people in to fix it, I’ll pay for the damage”
“Do you…would you
want you to keep being brave. You get that?”
close friends. And this morning I thought they just confessed to each other and then kissed” Harry exclaimed, Draco won’t admit but he looked cute trying to comprehend all of this “Ron didn’t know too”
. My one wish right now is for your cock to be in me
Draco said, making himself comfortable on Harry’s lap and at the same time reminding Harry that he’s hard and Draco rubbing his crotch didn’t make the hardness go away
“Why did you ask?”
! And you decided to confess five seconds before we have to go?”
” Draco practically yelled at them “What’s with Blaise and Ron and meddling?
“What’s going on?”
“So, will you care if I go out with him or not?” He asked, wanting Harry to reply the
“Oh, I look pretty” Pansy smiled and kissed Hermione on the cheek “For you, my lady” Pansy pulled out a small bag from her pocket and put it in Hermione’s hand “My last present for you in this trip”
Draco couldn’t sleep, he opened his eyes and felt the empty air behind him. Since he lashed out at Potter during dinner, the Gryffindor has stopped doing everything that might make Draco uncomfortable,
(See the end of the chapter for
“See? This is nice right?” Pansy swam next to Draco and smiled “Especially that your leg is healed now”
He tilted Draco’s face up, only to get a nod from the blond “
“That’s for being so sexy when you posed with the snake” Draco smirked “You were so hot, I wish I was the snake”
” Pansy yelled and Draco decided to pull away from the kiss, they have given their friends enough scene to ogle at now
narcissistic.
“No reason” He said, shrugging his shoulders “I just observe a lot”
“Pansy’s putting words in your mouth, isn’t she?” Harry squinted his eyes at Ron, it sounded more like Pansy than him, and he knew how much Pansy kept hanging out with Ron these days, with them going to fancy parties every week with their partners
“Don’t joke about things like that, Potter” He said, looking down it got quiet for a minute before he heard someone calling Potter’s name
“Look, your hole is still twitching” Harry said, his thumb playing with Draco’s loosen hole, the blond moaned when Harry pushed his thumb inside “Should I keep it all inside you?”
, Ron borrowed my computer, and he probably downloaded a bunch of it”
“You’re really good at this” He said, and Draco knew exactly what he meant, he was trying to seduce Harry again, and here he thought that Draco might need a break, instead the blond just invite him for round two.
told you so”
“How did you manage to get naked so fast? Did you use magic?” Draco huffed out a laugh, looking at Harry, who was sitting on the edge of the bed in his boxer and nothing else

“Honey, you’re drooling” Theo touched the corner of his lips with a disgusted frown and wiped it on Draco’s shirt
Every time he came back from the hospital, all he talked about was you! Then he was afraid you wouldn’t reciprocate his feelings and then he moped all day, so Hermione told him to get another Healer though she
“That’s
“Well, I know that” Potter said, rubbing the nape of his neck, he grinned at Draco and continued “I just thought it would be nice if you have something to make you less cold even a little when I’m not around”
he would get used to it. The rustling sound next to him was loud, Potter couldn’t sleep either, he should have known this would happen.
Draco wailed and immediately shut up when Harry pushed a digit in along with his tongue, his mouth only letting out whimpers instead. Harry slid the second finger in Draco’s tight entrance and started thrusting at a slow pace, he crawled back up and kissed Draco, the blond sunk in the kiss, Harry hoped it’d make him forget about the third finger that was nudged inside him now.
“Three potions in three hours, Draught of Living Death, Draught of Peace, and Amortentia” He repeated what Professor Slughorn had just said a minute ago and watched the way Harry clumsily pulled out his notes, his quill and everything else “I don’t have to guide you through it, do I?”
“Well, we can still do dinners, just…not as frequently as before” Draco said, his eyes glimmered, but Harry saw a flash of what could be disappointment in his eyes, Harry wasn’t certain on anything, not with Draco “But the proposal thing, it’ll
Draco made a face, which in turn made Harry wrote down another sentence
“Yes, Harry, I love you too” He said without a doubt, they have said those words to each other a week after they moved in together, spilling out at the same after a kiss, and it had led to their

“No, it’s fine. I panicked and forgot everything I learned about putting out fire, and my friends kept screaming”
“So…Potter has been crushing on me for a year now?”
“What about what you just said about Neville?”
“All of us, Blaise, of course, Theo, because he loves party”
, I should have seen it coming, with the way he’s always staying back at his dorm, I mean, I’d understand it because I always…stay back at the dorm to have some quality time with Granger, who knows he was able to get in Weasley’s trousers before I could get under—…”
” Harry chuckled, he really didn’t want all his friends to see that he was fully hard under his boxer and it was already embarrassing enough that they saw him and Draco taking each other’s clothes off and snogging like crazy in the hall
“Seriously” Pansy said and leaned over to ask Harry “Hey, hi, do you know Hermione Granger?”
much, it was just a stupid crush, it was
“I don’t want to” Draco pouted, sitting down on the stool near the kitchen counter and eating the meal Harry had cooked for him, eggs and bacon, his favourite breakfast “This is horrible by the way”
“What did she give you?” Potter asked innocently
? Draco shook his head and kept looking and groaned when he couldn’t find his pen, he must have forgotten it at his workplace, he forgot the
” Ginny beamed, standing with everyone in the kitchen, she was wearing a strapless red cocktail dress while Luna wore a embroidered floral dress. Hermione wore black glitter jumpsuit, next to her was Theo in a white suits, matching Neville’s black ones. Ron and Blaise were in chef clothes again, and Rose in the middle, wearing a short gold sequin dress, all of them were smiling at him.
“Yeah, but, you see, I didn’t listen to you back then” Draco huffed out a breathy laugh “I kept my feelings”
“It’s
“So, how did the fire happen?” Harry asked with a smile, he was curious. Even if Draco wanted to lie, he couldn’t, he felt the urge to spill out everything to the firefighter right there and then
“It’s not even in yet” Harry chuckled, he was just angling it at Draco’s entrance, he didn’t want to ram it in right away, he wanted to make sure this experience was good for Draco “I’m pushing in now” Harry mumbled, leaning down to capture Draco’s lips in another kiss, distracting the blond from the breach when Harry started shoving in inch by inch.
Draco said with a smug grin on his face, leaving her alone so Hermione could talk to her “Hey, you both came” He said to Ginny and Luna, who were standing near a snack table “Please, have fun”
“There are Cormac” Hermione added before Harry could open his mouth to ask “And Celeste”
“Oh…you still don’t know” Pansy said, leaning on Hermione’s shoulder and looked at her wife “Should we?”
She was mean!” Ron squeaked loudly, nudging his sister as she laughed at him “You didn’t know, you weren’t scolded by her for not knowing what a person wrestling the bloody giant squid looks like”
“Spill whatever’s on your mind” Draco said, and began eating his grilled salmon, he needed a change in his menu soon, too much seafood could actually bore him out “Why are you having an attitude? Did I do anything to you? Oh, and why did you run earlier?”
“Where you proposed” Hermione said “And a book”
“That’s impossible” Draco scoffed, he could never like the Potter there in his world. The Harry here was the one that made him fall “What if we’re in a parallel world and it’s the way it is”
” Draco moaned, lowering himself, inviting Harry in for more. Harry swirled his tongue around the rim and slowly went in, curling his tongue and feeling Draco’s hand on his hair, gripping tightly and whined when Harry added a finger alongside with his tongue
Potter nodded, settling down next to Draco, they were inches apart, their robes were the only thing that touched. They both folded their legs together on the bed, staring out at the sky through the window, none of them spoke, it was nice like this.
regret this decision!”
“Hey, hi” A young blonde woman approached their spot with a smile, she stood in front of Potter and giggled a bit before speaking up “May I ask…are you Harry Potter?”
He released his hand and Harry looked at him steadily before his mouth opened to tell Luna the answer
“Hey, I’m alright” Harry put a hand on his shoulder and smiled at Draco “My glasses got some of it, so it’s okay, I’m alright”
Draco looked at Ron and Hermione’s backs as they walked away from him, he had finally found them in the library without Potter after dinner, luckily, and he had apologised to them, one by one. Ron was just like his sister, he even spat out a few insults, bringing back a few memories when he was wrong towards them, and he has every right to act like that. Hermione, on the other hand, was easier, though he had thrown slurs at her before, calling her names, she was calmer than Ron. He knew it’d take time anyway, he just wanted to do it. When he was brought into the other world, he got the chance to see the other side of every person he had wronged, he found out they were so much better than him, and Draco just hoped here, now, they’d forgive him and see him as a better version than before.
Faint scars all over his chest, no wonder he felt incredibly familiar when he showed his arse, the same pair of arse he grabbed every time he thrusted in multiple times that night. Harry’s lips pursed into a half smile when Draco began grinding on him, it all came back, memories of that night, memories of them since they were kids, when they went to Eighth Year together, the friendship they had until Draco left, and especially, the feelings he has desperately tried to forget about Draco, it was all back again. Harry closed his eyes and inhaled when Draco leaned close, smelling the coconut scent from his hair,
“What?”
perhaps Draco’s in a coma right now?
Harry was hard as a rock “Do you want to let me down?”
Finally!
…” Neville said softly, blowing on his party horn in a sad tone, Harry stayed frozen on his spot when he saw all his friends sitting in the living room, everyone was looking at them with their mouths open, except Luna, whose eyes were being covered by Ginny
“No, no, you were right anyway, we broke up already so you can lash out at him, I don’t care” Draco shrugged lightly and started eating his meal
“You’re a menace, you know that?” Draco laughed softly and traced his fingers on Harry’s chest, leaning into his husband’s kisses “You already fill me up many times today, I’m sure it’s all in me”
“Yeah, just a peck, on the lips” Potter stuttered, looking at the magic clock Seamus created,
“I can’t believe Blaise let you have your anniversary for free at his resort” Draco huffed out a laugh
“Hey, I bought ice cream” Harry said when he heard the squeaking sound the stairs made whenever someone go down. It was
“Oh, well…” Harry couldn’t find any word to say, he wasn’t even sure how to react. Draco has a boyfriend, worse, that ruined Harry’s secret plan “Did you two, er, you know, did the thing yet? Wait no, sorry, that was nosy”
“I’m sorry, what’s going on?” Draco asked the blond girl after the two other men have left
“Harry” He smiled and held Harry’s hand “I have something to tell you” Draco stood on his toes and kissed Harry’s cheek before speaking, he should tell Harry about it anyway, now that they were a couple, he couldn’t lie, right? It was bound to be revealed soon “Well, seven years ago…” He began, and he knew
“Thank you, Pansy” Draco smiled tenderly at her, she was his best friend and no one could change it, she always know what to say, and she always know what Draco thinks, and Draco knew she was right. He looked up and saw Potter glancing at him before looking back and continued talking to Hermione, he pulled Pansy in a hug and buried his face in the crook of her wet neck “Thank you for always being there for me”
has to be there” She said, pointing at the two of them “If you don’t, I’ll tell Ginny to find you and hex you with her famous Bat Bogey Hex. Hear me?”
, I’m only 20”
Harry chuckled and kissed the shock off Draco’s face
“No, I meant, I imagine you’d be heavy to carry”
“Wait” Harry stopped Draco before they got into their house,
Hermione shouted but still remained the calmest of them all “
go back to your room, and prepare for tomorrow, it’s our last day here, make the most out of it, alright? Be calm” Pansy suggested “Now would you leave? After Hermione said all those things, I’m kinda hot for her all over again”
Pansy stopped them both and scratched her head, looking at Ron for help “He’s sick, and it’s infectious, so that’s why we’re here, to take care of him, don’t come in, it’s really gross”
“Me? Er, yeah, Seamus wants everyone to go” Harry said, scratching the nape of his neck, his ears were red, possibly because of the heat “I’m just hoping there won’t be anything too wild”
He mouthed back, he didn’t understand anything at all
“Alright, I know”
“Am not”
“Snots and everything” Ron added and threw the clothes behind the kitchen counter, he stood next to Pansy and smiled at both of them “To the point I could throw up”
applies to alcohol” Ginny said and he heard her boots clicking, she was gone again. Draco tried to engulf all of Harry in his mouth, causing the head to touch the back of his throat, and Harry to jerk into him
“Come to me when you have a serious injury” He said, pointing his wand at Potter’s little scratch to heal him, he immediately locked eyes with Potter again “That does
Han, for your observation, which is correct, by the way” Pansy exclaimed and Hannah nodded at her before smiling at Draco and walked away
“What?”
“Theo”
” A small squeaky sound emerged from Harry’s throat, he didn’t know where that came from. Just the thought of Draco snogging someone else got Harry all riled up “So, er, now that you have a boyfriend, I…I suppose we can’t do dinners like this and—and the fake proposal thing anymore?”
Draco grasped on the Auror’s shoulder, calling out Harry’s name while tilting his head up for Harry to suck on his neck, stroking the blond and thrusting into him. Harry’s pace sped up just as Draco stopped talking and started blabbering instead. Harry kissed him again and teased the head of Draco’s cock with his thumb, earning a wail from the blond before he came
“Almost” Draco whispered quietly when Potter walked to their table with a bright smile, this time the git was wearing one of those Hawaiian shirts and shorts, it was both hilarious and infuriating at the same time
“Fuck yes, now sit your arse down”
“So she has always had a thing for Luna?” He popped the question, he never knew Lovegood would be with Weasley’s sister.
“What do you call this?” He asked if Harry was really trying to paint something
“I know” Theo breathed out heavily “I just want him to like me, you know? And every time I talk to him, he barely says anything back, and just, walk away. Falling in love with a straight man?
“Anyone up for a drink?” Padma said, standing up and everyone following her. They should all take a break from playing this intense game.
listen to Draco about the whole
“That’s the guy” Pansy murmured and Draco widened his eyes
“We broke up, just today” Draco said, he didn’t know why he felt the need to say it, but he just admitted it anyway “He, he cheated on me”
“Tired?”
“I was” Theodore said, pouting and huffing like a kid “But after what you said, I thought about it. And I declined his offer, to know Longbottom better, like you suggested”
“But I think it’s just the right amount of time, because I know now, that we’d be
“Mummy, where are they going?”
, Draco couldn’t find a single thing to defend himself and there was still a long way back home.
“You will be fine” Draco chuckled at all the scenarios Harry created, it could all be true actually, but a part of him kept saying it would be alright, that he shouldn’t worry much
on it,
, he should never know Draco saw their reflections there
“Try to persuade people to buy as much as you can” Pansy’s hands came up to fix Draco’s hair “Be charming”
“I originally got a unicorn, don’t know where Pansy managed to get that, but I convinced her to switch it to a horse, a white one”
he was truly able to call Draco his husband, be with Draco for the rest of his life, and he could not wish for anything more.
“What did you want to tell me earlier?” said Draco, as he walked to his kitchen and pulled out two cups from the cabinet “Apple juice? Water? Beer? I don’t think coffee is the best choice right now, it’s past midnight. And please, settle down on the couch right there”
“What?” Draco looked up at Ginny when she spoke “How am I supposed to…”
“I don’t know much, but we were bored during one of the meeting and I started getting some hot news from Padma, who heard it from her sister Parvati, Parvati’s girlfriend, Lavender heard it because ever since she turned into a Werewolf, her hearing is really good” Pansy explained, while Draco was still trying to figure out what the hell she was saying “They seemed to have broken up a few days ago, only some people know, but I think Finnigan got a pretty loud voice, that’s why the news is getting out”
” Draco stopped when someone was clutching on his robes, he turned around and saw Ernie Macmillan behind him with a light pink colour painted on his cheeks “Can I talk to you for a second?”
“I mean, you apologised to almost everyone in Hogwarts, even Ron and Hermione” Harry pointed out, his arms folded on the table “Even Katie Bell. Why did you leave me out?”
“Don’t you dare, Ginny” Draco nudged her with his elbow and they both chuckled
“Potter, I—…” He stuttered and took another breath, he pulled out the black chocolate box with a red ribbon on from his bag and pushed it into Potter’s hands, he looked down on the ground and started confessing “Here’s the thing, I like you, I
Draco snapped at her “It was good, alright? Even in my dream, Potter was good at sex”
having this conversation” Harry chuckled and stood up, followed by Ron who was still trying to convince him to watch Muggle pornography “Go to your charity event with your husband, Ron”
“You won’t leave me?”
“I know” Draco smirked and stood up “Come on, Potter”
talk to guys, they
“Yeah” Blaise said, thrusting up, earning a loud moan from Ron
“I’m so glad we can finally have tonight to ourselves” Harry began, raising his wine glass up in the air, Draco smiled at him fondly and raised his as well, they clinked their glasses together and Harry continued “Is your food good?”
“Yeah, shocked, but yeah” He said, as Pansy folded her legs together and leaned over “What?”
“Be you” She leaned in and kissed his forehead, like how his mother used to as well “Want to go in? I’ll let you sit between Pansy and I”
“He won’t speak to me” Harry said, he has stopped going to the pub with his friends for a week now, once they saw each other at Ron’s house, Draco avoided Harry and left first, and Harry took it as a sign, Draco didn’t want to be near him “I don’t think I can stand watching him with Brandon”
“Do it then, Potter” He said and rolled over to lie down on his chest, even though he could apply it on by himself, it didn’t hurt to have Potter do it anyway. He could feel Potter moving closer to him, then he heard the cream being squeezed out, and then there it was, Draco let out a soft sigh and closed his eyes when Potter’s soft hands started rubbing cream all over his back, it felt good to have Potter’s big and strong hands doing this on him. Seven years ago, Draco’d be crazy if Potter ever touched him with such soft touches, but now Draco felt absolutely fine, no butterflies in his stomach or whatsoever
“I’m making, oh well,
“Alright, fix them up real nice, Draco” She grinned, walking back to her spot next to Hermione
“Meh, Ron won’t agree on any case that forces him to go anywhere faraway from Blaise” Harry added “They’re like glue”
“That’s true”
Draco turned the tap off and looked at the door. Did someone just call him?
“I, I guess what I’m saying is, I like you a lot, er, I think I’m falling in love with you, and, er, I really want to propose to you for real, someday” Harry took a deep breath and stood up, he slowly bent down on one knee and pulled out the ring box inside his pocket, he opened it and looked at Draco, he has never felt so scared yet brave before, his heart was thumping, his hands were shaking and his knees were weak “Draco, will you marry me…one day?” He looked down at the ring before looking back at Draco, who was gaping at him, his mouth opened, his eyes didn’t blink at all. And it was different from all those fake proposals they have done, because he knew Draco’s acting face, but now, he knew Draco wasn’t faking it, he was stunned “This, er, it could be our promise ring, and one day, maybe I can ask you to marry me again. And I hope, er, we can say I
“Harry, ready for work?” Ron elbowed him again, distracting Harry from staring at Draco eating. Recently Ron has been in charge of looking after Harry to stop him from doing things like this. After two years of living with Draco, Harry has come to an appalling realisation that he was madly in love with the blond. But he feared that if he told Draco about it, he’d reject Harry and probably moved out of the Grimmauld Place and the Auror definitely did
Draco tilted his head back and whispered seductively in Harry’s ear, he could feel his husband’s body quivering behind him, and before he could say anything more, Harry was spilling hot seeds inside him. Draco smiled in reflex, he loved that feeling, Harry was still holding him tightly, his chin leaning on Draco’s shoulder, they sighed softly and gazed at the city under the night sky.
“I…” Draco hesitated to answer. How could he tell her that she hated Granger in his world “No, Pansy, Granger, I mean Hermione is dating Weasley in my world”
“You should play, you’ve been standing alone for a while now” She said, already pulling him to the group as he let her. She was right, he should be joining this.
“You do”
“Forgot what?”
“Oh, you’re bringing two quills?”
“Oh no” Dean replied “Hannah did ask, Seamus and I were at the bar last night, and boy, it did
“See,
“Yeah?”
“Oh, okay” Roger nodded
” Harry said softly, making Draco blush once again by calling him with sweet pet names, he put his arm around Draco’s waist and together they looked around the room “I can’t believe they did all this”
“Oh” Ginny said “Just getting my drink, can’t waste any drop, mum taught me so”
” Theo said, his hands fidgeting with the hem of his shirt “Oh” He said again, standing up “Draco, would you mind? I think I’ll head out early”
” Theo teased, pulling Blaise and Pansy in the other direction while Draco continued his path to see Harry.
now. His words, it was melting Draco like an ice cream in July.
“Save that for the vows” Draco said, and he was certain Draco meant it as a joke, but a part of Harry wanted it to happen, though he wouldn’t tell the blond that. Harry groaned when Draco bit on his shoulder and mumbled in his ear “
The Death Eater? Why? How? When? And
“The time we had sex in Hogwarts’s library” Pansy squealed
“Don’t say that” He mumbled, burying his face in the crook of Harry’s neck and bitting his shoulder “
you?”
” He moaned and let his head fell, his eyes rolled to the back of his head when Potter started sucking him while scissoring Draco at the same time, he gripped on the fur of the carpet and breathed out when Potter stopped, the Auror planted featherlight kisses on his inner thighs, and moved closer, until- “
“I love you” Neville said “I love you, I love you, so much. I was never sure about it because I didn’t know if you were serious about me or not. I was, I was afraid of many things. You-you are so perfect, you’re so out of my league, I didn’t-I didn’t think I can make you happy”
“What’s wrong with him?” Pansy pointed and Draco turned around to see Harry looking disgruntled behind him
back at the house. And since they were at a Muggle restaurant, he couldn’t really Apparate away. Not to mention, he embarrassed himself by bumping into a waiter, spilling all the wine over Draco’s clothes, he could not feel more guilty than this “I can’t believe that happened”
“Well, Blaise
“It does” Draco pouted, holding tightly on Potter, he just wanted this trip to end fast
Draco gasped when the portrait opened to reveal the Gryffindor Common Room inside, he didn’t dare step in. What if Potter was here too?
“Stop flinching” He ordered when the redhead kept grimacing every time he pressed the sponge against the skin under his eyes
would mean Celeste gets to kiss Harry. And you know how crazy Celeste is with him”
“Me? What is wrong with you?” Harry snapped back at him “You-you just, grind yourself against that McLaggen jerk and-and you just—…”
“Yeah, there was a weird sentence engraved on it, I could not figure out what it meant”
“For your information” Draco said proudly, resting his legs across Harry’s lap “The first time was good” He paused, smirking a bit “So were the second and third time”
“We’ll go with you”
” Pansy groaned “Great!
“You two like each other” Pansy added “Do we need to push your heads together so you’ll finally kiss?”
Theo shouted, a drop of tears fell from his eye, he wiped his eyes and really looked at Neville now “
“You keep saying it, but do I ever listen to you?” Potter cocked his head to the side, grinning at the blond “Plus, you aren’t that heavy, it’s like I’m exercising anyway”
He murmured when Potter broke off the kiss and trailed down to kiss his neck instead. Everything was blurry and all he could feel was Potter sucking on his pulse point, making marks on his neck, kissing his collarbone and his hands teasing Draco’s hard bud under his shirt “
“I’m sorry, I’ll try to ask her again” Dean said, nodding at her “Gotta go meet Seamus now,
” Neville murmured in his ear, letting Theo cry as much as possible “Don’t give up on me, please”
” He heard Ron reassured his husband and heard the Floo flared up. Ron wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder and they kept walking until he heard the door of the lift being opened with a ding.
“Did it hit your eyes?”
“I remember you used to cut out articles about Harry in the Daily Prophet and put it in a box”
“Still not comfortable seeing Draco ever since he got a boyfriend?”
“Let’s go, Theo” Blaise gave him a smirk, throwing the cigarette on the ground and stepped on it with his boots before dragging Theo inside the Ministry
” He finally spoke, and
“And if I don’t
“You want it that bad?” Harry tilted his head up by his chin and kissed his shoulder, placing his lips on every faded scars on Draco’s salty chest, his cock thrusting in so slowly “You want me to fuck you hard?”
information, we haven’t, I’m not
Draco let out a breath he’s been holding when he saw Potter on the other side of the door, in only his sweatpants and no shirt at all.
“Oh, of course not” Harry said and quickly stood up with Draco, getting out of the booth to let the girls go
serious” Draco closed the file he was holding and looked at the man in front of him up and down “Are you really wearing t-shirt and jeans to a music lounge in a resort?”
“They can’t help it, since they have a new baby, they have to take advantage of their private time” Hermione said, Blaise and Ron had a baby girl just a half a year ago, she was extremely cute with red hair, and Ron loved her so much, he called her Ariel after he watched that Muggle movie “Where is Ariel?”
, his husband coming in with a smile on his face
” Draco whispered quietly to himself when Pansy and a few other Aurors helped putting the big white snake on Harry’s shoulder
“Oh…sorry, I had a few earlier” He sniffed his own hand and realised he had just eaten some bacons before leaving the house “Oh my god why are they still in there, it’s almost an hour,
” Their daughter turned to Draco and asked him with bright eyes and smile “Were you and dad doing the
“What?”
“I mean, who goes out for a bike ride with his band
“Probably not if you were in your world, but here, you’re Harry’s boyfriend” She said, poking his chest, her hard nail digging into his skin even through his robes “It’s your choice” He pressed his lips together, raising his hand up and waving. Soon enough, Potter spotted him and stood up, leaving the crow in a rush
” Harry whipped his head around when he heard a squeal and saw Ginny walking to their spot with
“Oh, hey” Harry replied through his Muggle phone, he was the one who gave Draco his first phone, it was a great memory because he remembered the way Draco’s face lightened up at the sight of his first ever Muggle contraption “What’s up?”
“Why? Oh wait…is it about the night…”
“Harry” Draco pouted, kissing Harry’s cheek and whispering in his ear “I
” Draco shrieked at them “I-…”
Draco hasn’t done it with anyone for so long, it wouldn’t be too bad to do it today, even if it’s with McLaggen. He had noticed how McLaggen looked at him today during the photoshoot, the egotistical bastard was an Auror too. Instead of replying, Draco tilted his head back and leaned on McLaggen’s shoulder, his hips grinding against McLaggen’s crotch, he moved the bastard’s hands from his hips up to his own chest, Draco breathed out a heavy sigh. He felt hot all over again, his eyes stayed shut the whole time, he just wanted to feel everything.
“Just some stuff about the exam” He said, shaking his head and hoping she’d believe his lie “What about you? Shouldn’t you be organising books?”
“Hey” Draco made his way to the kitchen in his black satin robes that barely covered half of his thighs, showing his long smooth legs, he tied up his long hair in a messy bun, yawning and stretching out his arms, making the robes go up higher, making Harry’s heart skipped a beat  “Good morning”
“What? Jump in!”
“Oh…er” Potter looked at him for a second before shaking his head with a sigh “It’s just…you can forget about it”
“You really think I don’t have anything for you?” Hermione chuckled and put the bracelet on Pansy’s wrist “Each symbol on it represent each meaningful event of our relationship, look, an ink bottle, because when you apologised to me after the war, I was so shocked I knocked down my ink bottle and spilled it all over the parchment, a wine glass, because you drank a lot of wine when you confessed to me, a bowl of soup, because you dipped your hand in it by accident on our first date”
“I guess you have a point” She sighed, fiddling with her black quill “But she’s obnoxious”
” She yelled, they were both standing on some rocks under the falls now, gesturing so he’d come
“Oh, yeah, I was just…boys’ night” Potter stammered, which made Draco wondered, but he shook it off quickly
“You aren’t wearing anything underneath too” Potter murmured “You just ran here with a bathrobe?”
“I’m going to…” He sobbed, tears falling from his eyes when he couldn’t take it anymore, he has to come, it was becoming unbearable “
“Well I only focused on you” Pansy said, making Hermione blushed “So, you’re alright?”
She had told him he was good at it and promised him a place as a Healer in St. Mungo’s after he graduated from Hogwarts. He didn’t believe her at first, but eventually he realised she was a kind woman, and she couldn’t be lying. And he has been helping her for three months now, already preparing for a future where he saved people. He didn’t expect himself to be a Healer, yet he found himself loving the feeling when he helped people, it made him feel…good, as if he wanted to make up for his past of doing bad things to others.
“What thing?”
“I’m sorry, er, your offer sounds good, but I think I’ll have to deny it” Draco heard Potter answered as soon as he sat down to the booth next to theirs
just read his mind, Pansy” He grumbled “I want to know what they are talking about”
“Er” Harry uttered, Draco was looking at him intensely, there was no way out now, Draco remembered it “I…no”
“Maybe we should leave” Hermione suggested “Rose, come now, we’re going home” Rose quickly complied and the family Apparated away, leaving Harry and Draco alone. Harry didn’t know what to do or say, how will he ever explained he wanted to propose to Draco.
seeing it”
“Seriously?” Hermione glared at them “I-…I can’t even”
Ron widened his eyes when Pansy yelled out their names, she signalled him with her hand behind her back telling him to cover up everything “
Potter released his arms and stepped back “
Draco muttered and breathed out heavily when Harry finally went in, his tongue swirling around Draco’s walls, the blond kept pushing back, asking for more, but his husband just
He begged, his hands clutching on Harry’s wet hair “
know” Pansy exclaimed “It’s like watching two blind people looking for each other”
wind in
” He whined softly when his nipples were attacked by Blaise, he didn’t even know that place in a man could be
“I love you” Harry stood up, crowding Draco against the bathroom sink and locked him in his arms “I am truly, undoubtedly, extremely fucking in love with you, I don’t think I could ever love someone this much. If anyone asked me what love is when I was a teenager, I honestly wouldn’t know what to answer. But now, I’ll answer that it’s
moved it by magic so it points at Harry” Hermione grinned at the blond “
“Well, not really bitten, more like a scratch”
“No, never” Draco hummed, trying to remember all the years Blaise’s been his friend “Well he still gives us birthday gifts, if that’s what you mean. But like just randomly, then no”
“So I heard the girl Weasley dumped your sorry arse, Potter?” Draco walked by, not forgetting to throw in some insults when he saw Potter “It’s about time she realised she could do better than you”
them to make you Weasley’s tutor? Do I care about you or him that much?” He asked, arching an eyebrow, Blaise looked at him intently for a few seconds before he nodded. Draco breathed out in relief, because that was exactly what he did “Blaise, I know you think he’s loud, and has some anger issues and he’s so bad at classes, but you’re good at handling it, right? Pansy’s also loud, she has mood swings all the time, and she’s even worse at studying” He said firmly, searching for some change in expression from Blaise’s face. Blaise has never been the one to feel anything for anyone, Ron has always been the one to feel and express way too much, they’d have a good potential to be together.
Draco buttoned his shirt up nervously while looking at the mirror, he felt that for a reason. Today, he’d tell his parents that he was dating Harry and they’d live together at the Grimmauld Place, where Harry was living. After a summer of only communicating through owls and secret Firecalls, Draco realised just how much he missed Harry and wanted to be with him, even when they’ve only been dating for three months.
Last chapter here. I wanted to write more for them, even smut, or angst, but I didn’t write any because I think fluff is enough for this storyline. Plus, I love writing fluff for my boys, they deserve it!
“And that’s all my hard work, putting them together” Pansy pointed at Draco and Harry before sighing “I should get some credit”
” Harry murmured, and leaned on Draco’s shoulder. He sat there, frozen as ice, a few minutes later he heard a soft snore from the man sleeping on his shoulder. Draco sighed and leaned back on the booth…
?” Pansy wiggled her eyebrows when they approached the girls
be alone right now “He’s an arsehole, fuck him”
“Is this necessary?” Draco rolled his eyes at Potter and crossed his arms over his chest. He decided to spend time here because of his own reasons “I want to study so I can graduate, it’s just a waste of time going home. And you, why are you here? Aren’t you supposed to be with the Weasleys right now?” And another fact was that he didn’t like how his Manor felt, it still reeked of deaths there. Draco couldn’t shake off the feelings and he would sometimes have nightmares there, so he didn’t want to go back, and fortunately his mother understood him.
“Of course, it’s in Theo’s newest collection, you’ll love it”
Draco walked in the crowded pub alone, Pansy had come earlier and picked out his outfit for him. She insisted on making him wear a black crop top with a pair of black trousers, a long black jacket, just to be sure it wasn’t too cold for him and he could take it off if it gets warm in the pub, and black boots. Pansy even put a little bit of lipstick on him, to make his lips
. Luna had also been a good conversation partner, although she talked about weird stuff a lot, but Draco still enjoyed it. He also talked to Weasley, who forced Draco to call him Ron, who also blabbered about everything and eventually passed out on the couch until Blaise picked him up. He talked to Hermione and Pansy for a while, they talked about politics a lot, and Pansy got bored and dragged her wife away, then Theo. However, he never once talked to Potter, the one that invited Draco to this party, which was weird, it seemed like the Auror was avoiding him because every time he looked at him, Potter looked the other way, it was infuriating.
“Of course” Pansy scoffed “My wife looks good in everything, and nothing”
“Wrong” Draco glared at him, pressing his finger harder into Harry’s chest “You are sweating, do you know that?”
?” Draco finally said something, it was still hard for him to process the whole thing.
marrying a tall husband paid off “
“I know” Ron winked at him and pulled out his wedding ring from his pocket to put back on his finger “Throughout the years that I’ve been with him, that’s three years, Blaise’s probably the sweetest guy I could ever asked for, he sees me as his everything. When he got jealous the first time ever, he hugged me and asked if I’d leave him. That’s when I know he’s it for me” Ron said, looking at Blaise softly with a smile and gazing back at Draco “I could never imagine my life without him, and Ariel too”
“I don’t collect articles about him, mother, there are others too”
“All that sweet talk, where did you learn this?”
“Yes, please tell me, Pansy, I’m begging you”
“Well…” Draco took a deep breath before answering, it took him a lot to agree and go to this event, he hasn’t been out socialising at big events for a while now “Yeah, I’m free tomorrow, I’m only going because my friends will be there too”
She pointed at the desk bell on the bar behind them and signalled him to look at the door “Let me explain this to you, you have five minutes to talk to a person, after the bell rings, they move to the next person. When you meet someone you like, you exchange informations, that’s it. Easy, right?”
“So you’re just going to stay in this office on your birthday?” Ron slammed his hands down Harry’s table, startling the Auror with his scary look, he bent down and leaned over to whisper in Harry’s face “You know Pansy’s going to kill you”
Harry nodded and Draco let go of his hand, he remembered Harry had gotten a zero that day for forgetting the one ingredient, and here he was now, still making the same mistake.
“Hey, at least I’m not as bad as Blaise” Pansy poked out her tongue, diverting everyone’s focus to Blaise, who was walking next to Draco, his face remained the same, unimpressed by the jokes “He was gawking at Weasley the whole time”
“She always do that to Ron and I when we were in Hogwarts” Potter leaned over to Draco and smiled
“Thank you” He said as she nodded knowingly at him and walked away, she knew he needed space.
He shouted, trying to find his way out but his friends were incredibly fast, and strong, he could not take all five of them
Malfoy is here”
” Draco put his finger on Potter’s lips and whispered in his ear “I want you to fuck me right there on your carpet.
He said and his husband stopped, leaning up to kiss him softly “
“You’re not stuttering anymore”
“Only if you want to offer yourself as his present” Pansy said, rolling her eyes with a grin. Draco stayed silent, he really should he figuring out how to act tomorrow, since Harry’d definitely be there.
“Okay, are my eyes red?” The man looked up at Draco for the first time and his eyes weren’t what he noticed first, it was his gorgeous face, his messy raven hair, his sharp jawline, and his lips. He eventually dragged himself from drooling at the man right there and then looked at his eyes
“I picked up on a lot of things when we’re arch rivals” He said, suddenly both of them were smiling. He couldn’t deny it either, he knew too much about Harry as well
Draco finished the letter and heaved a long breath, so time must have really gone by when he was brought there, he thought it might have just been a dream.
She pointed at Goldstein and shook her head. What was that supposed to mean?
” Draco spun around and yelled loudly when a hand was on his shoulder, he pressed the taser into the man’s chest. Once he saw the guy collapsed on the hard ground, shaking from the taser, Draco gasped.
“Oh” Potter said softly when he looked down at his left hand, which was holding his wand. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled “Well, er, I didn’t…er, I just want to make sure”
“Not tonight” Ron raised his left hand to show that he has no ring on and tilted his head to the right to point at Blaise, who was standing in the corner of the room, his face indifference but Draco could tell he was furious “Blaise made me mad, so I joined this just for a few minutes to piss him off”
“I should hope not” Ron said and Harry felt him being put down on the ground “You know what, you guys go first by the Floo, I’ll Apparate with Harry once we got outside of the Ministry”
brave
“Everyone keeps saying that to me today”
“I’m still very much in love with you too, Draco Malfoy” Harry grinned before kissing him again, this time, it was deep. For the first time in the past months, Draco felt loved again, he felt secured, he was happy. Kissing Harry always felt like the first time, passionate, romantic, he could do it forever, he thought as Harry slipped his tongue inside his mouth, his hands sliding under Draco’s shirt. It was all he could ask for.
” The blond broke the kiss off and they both looked at the door, it was his mother’s voice “Can I come in?”
“Yeah, in Diagon Alley”
” Draco smirked, making Ron blushed and sat back on the couch with his face hid in Blaise’s chest
“Oh right. You went home early that night, so Harry kissed Draco and the next day he forgot about it and Draco has been sulking ever since” Theo explained and grinned “It’s been 3 months”
“Hmm, if I win, I get to kiss you”
“I was not upset”
“You’re close, aren’t you?” Harry spoke in his ear, and he knew the git was smirking. Being together for so long, they understand each other like the back of their hands
Pansy raised her wine glass high in the air with a bright and proud smile on her face, she was exceptionally gorgeous today. Draco noticed because she had put on her red pantsuit tonight and nothing inside, showing her rack to the world, her short black hair fell down to her shoulders and she has a gold pendant on her neck “
“I want to finish what we were going to do” Potter said, clearing his throat and leaned closer “Do you, er, do you want to?”
“Sorry, mate, we know you like him even before that” Ron smacked his chest and sighed loudly “Ready?”
“I’m fine, he already went home right?” He meant Neville, the guy had rushed out after his shoot,
“I-I got to go”
Ron moaned, coming and shooting it all over the wall, his hips jerking
…” Draco murmured when Harry started picking out the kale from Draco’s plate to his, he remembered that Draco hated kale and whenever they have dinner, Harry’d eat it for him
“Did you hear that?” Ron pushed Blaise’s hand away from his now soft cock and signalled him to shut up or they’d be caught
“Hey…didn’t your dad and his friends study here 20 years ago?” He asked, when the Headmistress mentioned she didn’t want the same thing from 20 years ago to happen again, and what she said with him having the Black’s blood inside him. Didn’t Potter’s dad play with Sirius Black? Sirius was his first cousin, once removed. And he didn’t really care about what the Headmistress said…until now
“Do you want to tell me what happened?” Lilian asked, her hand reaching out to touch his to comfort him “We still have four minutes left, if you want to”
“Can I join, mum?”
” Neville blushed and Theo gave him a peck on the cheeks. Their love took the longest time, after graduating from Hogwarts, Theo had followed his dream in fashion and moved to France for five years, while Neville stayed back and somehow got together with Hannah Abbott for two and a half years until they broke up. When Theo came back and opened his own boutique, it was fate that the store was near Neville’s place, or maybe it was not so much of a coincidence when Draco was the one to tell him to open it there. Theo’s feelings never disappeared as he continued to pursue his second dream, being Neville’s partner, and it took him a whole year for Neville to realise it, Gryffindors were definitely oblivious.
I could use some sleep” Pansy yawned, stretching out her arms and leaned her chin on Granger’s shoulder, it’s been hours since he got here “Come on, darling, you should sleep, it’s late”
“Honestly, I didn’t remember what happened at that party” Ginny said, she probably ended up sleeping during it that day “But I do remembered vaguely that Ron cried because Romilda Vane yelled at him”
“Dead? No way” Pansy scoffed loudly and tapped on the spot next to her on the couch, telling Draco to sit down “They’re both alive and healthy, well, separated years ago, but healthy. James’s now living with Regulus as partners, he’s Sirius’s brother, they’re kinda related to you now that I think about it, the Black’s family. And Lily’s with Mary, her Hogwarts best friend”
“Ask and spray. And persuade them to buy, saying stuff like…I don’t know, this cologne helps you attract people, help you find true love, or a date, or whatever” Pansy shrugged and fixed his bowtie for the second time, she was even more nervous than him “Oh and don’t spray unless they let you, if not, they might sue, and Marcus will kill you”
” They both looked at the hallway of the building when Brandon called for Draco, the guy was standing there with a bouquet of flowers, he slowly approached Draco, and Harry slightly stepped back, those two were still a couple, he couldn’t intervene “I’m sorry we fought, it was stupid of me to leave, I’m so sorry. Will you forgive me?” Harry stared at the two of them, and just when his heart couldn’t bare it anymore, Brandon
” Pansy called them “Time to go, all the Portkeys are ready to be activated now”
“Oh, I’m sorry, what were you saying?”
“Weird” Draco murmured and stepped closer to the mirror, the gold framed mirror stood firmly in front of him, there was a sentence, but he didn’t know what it meant “
“No, she just went out” He said shortly, eyes fixed on the injured arm, he wondered what Potter did again to cause this. Potter was draping a scarf over his neck loosely, it seemed like he didn’t feel cold at all.
“Oh, yeah, I’ll go too” He said, looking back at his hands, he was holding the letter again. After the party, things just got awkward, he didn’t see Harry much anymore. When he asked Ron, he only told Draco that Harry was sorting things, which led him to believe that he’d leave Hogwarts to go somewhere, maybe far away. And it was only a scary reminder to Draco that he was running out of time.
“Drop dead gorgeous, but it’s still morning” Draco said, making Theodore cackle
Draco turned around when he saw Pansy and Hermione walking in the corridor, Pansy waving her hands up in the air “Just a bit alcohol”
purpose”
his food, he knew the blond didn’t actually mean it, since they have been living together for 3 years. The truth was that Draco loved his food but never letting him get that satisfaction, so instead of compliments, Draco complained all the time.
” Draco urged, pushing himself back at every thrust as Harry sped up just like he demanded
“I want to ask for your blessings so I can ask for Draco’s hand in marriage”
“I beg your pardon?”
“Harry?” Draco’s eyes widened a bit, the lotion bottle almost fell out of his hand “He—he’s June?”
“Can I kiss you?”
Everyone raised their glasses and smiled brightly
“Why do you keep asking that? Okay, look here” Pansy pulled out a small picture from her robes and showed it to him “This is a picture Blaise took for Hermione and I yesterday, that’s you and Harry kissing in the background near the Black lake. See?” Draco held the picture shakily in his hands, this was unreal, this has to be a dream “What’s wrong with you? Did you lose your memory or some sort?”
” Draco whispered and looked away when he saw Harry’s abdomen, it was enough. If he saw more, he would actually jump on Harry right now, begging the firefighter to take him right here on the floor, the carpet was quite soft, he could do it. He was a virgin, but who said virgins can’t have dirty thoughts?
“I, I wanted to see you”
“I think Luna called you” Pansy pointed to Luna, who was standing near the kitchen
It was normal before, they didn’t even have to talk, but ever since that night when Potter broke his shoulder, Draco was sure it changed everything. Potter came to the hospital wing more, they talked more, and their conversations were always civil, it wasn’t supposed to be like this. It was odd, Draco couldn’t figure out why it felt so wrong yet so right.
” He raised a hand up to touch the mirror, his voice trembling
Ron yelled “I don’t want to be those jealousy lovers but being with you would be so frustrating, wondering, thinking, overreacting”
“Are you? Obsessed with my lips?” Draco pouted as Harry’s gazed quickly went to his slightly swollen lips from their previous kiss.
“No one knows, it’s okay” Blaise said, kissing Ron’s temple to comfort him. After their graduation, Blaise had told Ron about his feelings, but Ron was in denial for three years, claiming they were just close friends, and Blaise accepted that, until Ron realised they were more than that. Now that Blaise went and studied about photography, he became somewhat famous among the wizards while Ron became an Auror like Harry and they had a family now, Draco was glad for them.
the girls’ voices weren’t already enough
“Potter”
“Hey, what should I do next?” Goldstein poked him and Draco hurriedly got back to his cauldron as well. It was weird, maybe Potter was in a mood again.
“Would you mind?” Draco mumbled, and Potter immediately cleared his throat and wiped invisible dust off his thighs as the Weasley girl kept talking about how hard the Hufflepuff girls were partying there
“What?”
“You know about that?”
“Thank you, so, seven then?” Harry asked “I will pick you up then” He stood up and Draco followed him.
Harry slipped his hand under Draco’s robes and touched the bare skin on the small of the blond’s back, he trailed his kissed down on Draco’s neck, sucking on it, Draco let out a soft moan, which only made Harry more excited than he already was.
“Well” Potter pulled out the parchment from his jeans’ pocket and read it to Draco “Dinner at the restaurant near the beach to watch the sunset and then…Hawaii Opera Theatre. Wait, Opera? How long will that be?”
“What?”
“I couldn’t help but overheard your conversation” Pansy said and smiled at Harry mischievously “Hi, I’m Pansy” She bent down and whispered into his ear
Is that foreshadowing Hugh and Jamie? I’m not sure, but that’s open for interpretation, oof.
“Pansy?”
“It’s alright” Draco put the brush back in the box and smiled “A…horse?”
“Will do” Blaise hummed, leaning closer every second, which only made the blush on Ron’s cheeks redder “I’ll never let you go hungry”
“We really
“He’s
“Seven is good, yeah” He muttered, pouring more juice out into the cups, hopefully he won’t ruin it this time “I will…I will be there, I mean here, since you’ll pick me up”
she and I can both give you a speech on settling down”
“Yeah, I guess so, who would have though? Maybe Weasley couldn’t handle Granger and her excessive need to be the best out of everyone” Pansy scoffed, rolling her eyes and picking up her fork. It got kind of funny when he realised Pansy has started talking about Hermione more. The blond dipped his fork into the mashed potatoes, thinking carefully in his head. Maybe he could do something about it after all.
“Come on, you can tell me” Draco poked his arm, he never thought one day he could see Ronald Weasley blushing like this. The old him would have been mean about this, but he wouldn’t want to ruin their friendship now “I won’t tell Blaise”
“We’re here” Ginny said and the car stopped abruptly
“Thank you” Draco huffed out a laugh and looked at Harry, whose eyes were exceptionally green, and Draco loved green “He is a jerk, it’s alright, I guess, it made me see him for who he actually is”
“How could you sit with Anthony Goldstein?”
“I like…” He stuttered “I like looking at the sky like this, it’s just like…our last year in Hogwarts right?” He looked down and mentally punched himself, he was being a coward again
“I’m not”
“You cried when Pansy scolded you, Ron” Potter replied, shutting Ron up, Draco smirked a bit from his spot and hid his smile with his hand, he did
“Well, it’s not something I’m proud of, but me and them used to do a lot of jobs to just get by”
idiot” Pansy groaned at him along with Ron, her hands slamming down on the table in the pub, startling everyone in the booth “
He blinked repeatedly at the redhead and could not say a word
“Wow, Harry, aren’t you tired?” Hermione asked him, she genuinely looked worried “Are you alright, Draco? If not, we could go back”
“All the flavours you love” Harry put all the items he had just bought in the refrigerator and turned back to Draco, pushing a small box on the kitchen counter to the blond’s spot “And I got you this”
“That’s a bit dramatic, don’t you think?” Ron laughed softly, unwrapping the sweets Blaise had prepared in his bags daily, since they were husbands and Blaise knew Ron liked to eat sweets every single second of the day “Want some?” Harry shook his head and remembered all the time Draco ate the chocolates his mother had sent him in their living room, the blond would have that smile on his face and he would hum whenever he tasted something good “So you confessed to him, doesn’t mean you two would stop being friends. Maybe it’s worth the shot, maybe Draco likes you back”
. Draco felt like he was having a déjà vu moment right now, the girls haven’t worn that shirts in months, he turned to Theo sitting next to them, he was ogling at Neville across the table until he noticed Draco
not alcohol, Ginny” Draco smirked at his power over Harry right now
“You really are daft, Draco” Pansy said softly with a sigh, she grabbed the champagne bottle and started chugging it
“Oh you guys are on time” Hermione walked out with Luna and the girls came to hug them both. Hermione was wearing a dark purple sweater and Luna’s sweater has a special touch to it, with flowers on her initial in the middle “Come and meet everyone, dinner is almost ready” She said, leading them into the living room. The whole house seemed cosier, with warm light and the sweet smell of home-made food filled his senses. Everyone was wearing different sweaters, even Harry has his own dark red sweater and he never thought he would enjoy this scene that much.
do it all the time” Ron explained, but Harry still couldn’t do it, he has had enough of weird dreams about Draco already, and he’d always wake up in sweats and a bulge under his trousers, he wasn’t going to do this too, and he knew it won’t help solving his problem anyway “Maybe doing it will get a few things off of you, maybe some pent up sexual urges”
“Did it work?”
“Sorry, I miss you too much” Harry said, helping him with the buttons and Draco didn’t forget to cast a wandless charm to conceal Harry’s crotch after. They both walked to his mother’s spot and started packing. He was going to start his life with Harry now, and he couldn’t possibly be any happier.
“No, Ron. That’s highly disturbing to even look at” Harry glared at his best mate while closing the computer and putting it back on the table “I am not going to jack off after people who look like Draco”
Draco held onto him tightly and cried out, arching his body, tightening his entrance and making Harry jerked his body as well, coming inside Draco and filling him up while Draco came everywhere.
“Really?”
“Er, okay” Potter said, bobbing his head to show that he understood it, he extended his hand and Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
“It means your dad and I are destined to be together, James,
“It’s my fault” Harry said, smiling and kissing Draco’s lips, he looked at the door and held the blond’s hand “Do you think our friends are right outside listening?”
Draco exhaled heavily when Harry started pushing Draco’s thin shirt up, pushing off his robes “And then what?”
“Yeah” Draco said, grabbing Harry’s hands and placed them on his face. He touched the blond’s smooth hair and cupped his face, Draco got thinner, he suspected, his finger trailed from his jawline down to the corner of his mouth. And before he knew it, he was touching Draco’s lips, his lips were never chapped like Harry’s, it was always glossy and just…tempting Harry to do more.
! Alright? I will be your Valentine, you git” He blushed and grabbed the box from Potter’s hand, hugging it tightly to his chest
“You were sexy in that outfit you wore on my birthday” Harry said, making Draco blush because it reminded him of that day. It was Pansy’s idea, obviously, but he actually listened to it. He was over 40 years old now, he couldn’t think Harry still considered him sexy “You’re always sexy in my eyes” Harry said, his hand sliding in Draco’s long hair that he grew out for the past few years “You’re perfect to me”
“It’s the start of something, right?” Luna smiled along with everyone, she was the one that made the game anyway, he should thank her for that “That’s what you two said in your vows that made Ginny cried”
” Draco jolted, breaking away from the kiss to see the Headmistress staring at them with a displeased look “Please continue your activities elsewhere, Mister Potter and Mister Malfoy” Harry grinned at Draco, both saying sorry to her as she mumbled quietly “Exactly like twelve years ago, I can’t believe it”
“Well, it caught my eyes” Pansy pursed her lips and rolled her eyes again, avoiding Hermione’s gaze “Oh no, she caught me, she’s gonna want to talk about book organising again”
He was startled to see Astoria, Astoria Greengrass right in front of him, she still looked the same as before, but she seemed more mature “I can’t believe you’re here”
going to see that bastard again, and stop blowing it in my face, you smoke like a chimney” He frowned
“Draco” Draco turned to his right and saw Potter standing next to him, his face dark “Do you want to sit next to me?”
” He mumbled when Potter decided to slip his tongue inside Draco, he gave up and lied back down on the carpet, enjoying the feeling of Potter’s tongue swirling, breaching the blond opened. He grabbed on the Auror’s messy black hair and pushed in so he could go deeper “
“So you mean…like we’re soulmates or something?” He whispered, glancing at Potter, who was searching for books with Weasley from afar “That’s got to be a joke”
“I feel like I’m being interrogated” Ron snickered and shut up when Draco started putting some lip balm on his lips to make it shiny
“That’s it for today” Pansy said when Roger finished his shooting, she tugged on Blaise’s jacket and mumbled “Do you think it’s good?”
Draco exclaimed “I win! I win! I w—…” Draco’s eyes widened when Harry kissed him, suddenly he forgot how to breath. When Harry sucked on his bottom lip, Draco snapped out of it and pushed Harry away
“Wait” Draco put up his hand “
He cried out when Harry quickened his thrust, he could feel himself being touched to the deepest
“I feel like crying when he’s near, because of this…this pain from knowing he doesn’t and never like me back” He clutched on his shirt, the spot right on his heart and he mumbled “I feel like I’m overreacting”
Draco could hear Ron’s
?” Seamus said, pointing at him and Harry, the only ones left sitting by themselves “You and Harry are not switching seats”
“So have you forgiven me yet?”
“Yeah” Harry said, shrugging slightly, showing Ron the band ring, there were diamonds wrapped around each side of this classic ring with a high polish finish. Only Ron knew about his proposal plan.
“Tell me, Potter,
“It doesn’t work” Draco snapped a little bit harder than usual, he was angry, he wasn’t sure why. Potter’s words meant nothing to him.
“Cheesy, but I get it” Ron nodded, putting the ring back in the box and gave it back to Harry, huffing out a soft breath “You sure you don’t want to do it? I think there’s a reason you brought it here tonight”
“Wait” Draco skimmed the parchment Hermione gave him and asked “We have to…do every activity in this with you two? Like…a couple?”
“Hmm” Potter nodded and looked at the blond with bright eyes “Do you want to eat crab?”
“You should totally go”
“His? So a
“You know, I never tell lies” Harry winked, he took a deep breath before continued “I have something to tell you”
“Okay, focus on me” He said, and used a finger to pull Harry’s lower eyelid down, he squeezed the bottle gently and let the eye drop fall into Harry’s eyes. Draco retreated his hands and sat back down on the bench, letting Harry closed his eyes for a while
like a koala to the bedroom, it looked like the night still ended in sex anyway.
“Thank you” He couldn’t say it enough, Draco stood up and looked at his father “Thank you too, father” He watched as his father’s dagger glares slowly softened up, he breathed in deep and gave Draco a quick nod before looking the other way.
“Should we?” Harry asked him, Draco nodded silently and they both walked to the mirror. There it was, he saw themselves in the mirror, but they were probably 80 years old or so there, their hands were still intertwined. Harry has his beard grown out there, while Draco’s hair was longer than now, it was reaching far down his back. They were still in their Auror and Healer robes, they looked older, with grey hair, but still happy “Are you seeing what I’m seeing? Us until we’re grey?”

“He’s
“Are you going to compliment me again?”
“…It’s like the world is punishing me” Pansy groaned and Draco nudged her arm
“…no” Harry exhaled, he could never lie to Draco
“You said he was
“Thanks” He said kindly
“Yeah” He smiled “Will you still love me when I look like that?” He asked, looking up at Harry and wrapping his arm around his waist “When we’re all old and wrinkly?”
“Draco, come here, I have something to give you” She led him to the big couch in the living room and gestured him to sit down. He clutched at his sleeves when he settled next to her, she was the one he wanted to impress most and definitely didn’t want her to call him here and tell him that she disliked him.
“Stop saying sorry, would you?” Luna chuckled and broke away from the hug “It’s alright, don’t think much about it”
“Okay, goodbye” Harry intertwined his hand with Draco’s and pulled the blond out of the room
“Oh well, remember the thing I told you a few days ago about making a calendar of Aurors?” Hermione explained, and based on the dumbfounded looks on all Aurors’ faces, they didn’t have a clue
“If you can’t, we will” Ginny scoffed, walking to a table nearby and pulled a chair out for Luna to sit down “Seriously, we
“Oh my god” Hermione shrieked in excitement “
“No, we’re done”
“What I love most about Hermione” Pansy winked and Draco chuckled, he knew
“They don’t care,
at that moment when Harry’s face lights up at his story, that Harry was
a worthy opponent”
“I think I have already fallen for you”
“I was in a rush” Draco mumbled back and pushed Potter’s towel off as well, he froze at the sigh “
shrugged and gave him a crooked smile “I’m sorry I broke your door, protocol…I mean I always need to find the quickest way in”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, I thought that’s what close friends do, like Dean and Seamus, so I wasn’t sure if you liked me”
“Animals?” Terry Boot asked again “Why are we—…”
“Oh, right” Pansy nodded along with Draco, Blaise was never the one to take action without thinking of everything out carefully. If he was unsure, he would never do it “So you think he actually likes Weasley?”
“Good boy” Pansy clapped and teased Draco “Now this is a sight to see”
flirting with him! He just said hi to me”
Draco settled on one of the chairs Ginny had set outside the Burrow earlier and held on his cup of cocoa between his cold hands. He looked up at the sky and watched as the others played Quidditch at night. It was Oliver’s suggestion, who was also invited over by Percy, and everyone loved the idea. They have split into two teams, Ron and Oliver were Keepers, George and Bill were Beaters. Ginny tried to persuaded Fleur to be Chasers with her but failed because she was already pregnant. And Percy agreed to play after a lot of pleading from his own boyfriend Oliver, while Harry and Draco were Seekers. However, it has been a long time since he played Quidditch and Draco only joined the first three matches, after that he had switched with Charlie. Draco looked at his boyfriend and realised just how charming Harry looked flying on a broom, his hair was even messier due to the wind, and the way he flew so smoothly to find the Snitch was making Draco hot in his cheeks.
“Don’t mess this up, Potter” Draco closed the door to his study and walked to his desk
“I don’t know how to face him, if I ever go back” He confessed, the Potter here was so different, he wasn’t sure what to do once he has to deal with the Potter in his universe “We hate each other there”
“Yeah” Hermione laughed and let Pansy put the same bracelet on her wrist, Draco shook his head with a defeated smile, these two were just perfect for each other
“Then you haven’t seen Draco sulking
“So was Granger there when it happened?”
He said as Harry smiled, it actually happened once or twice, they had actually did it way too much that Draco fainted halfway and Harry had to stop, since then Harry never let that story go
at anyone else”
Pansy yelled at both of the guys and Granger quickly casted an extinguishing spell, putting out the fire in a second, before Professor Slughorn could even stop it himself.
“Is it, er, is it appropriate to…kiss you right now?”
be that you just felt his normal cock, and because you’re putting your feet on his crotch, it’s understandable that you feel it”
“What’s that now?” Pansy asked again and turned to her wife “Did you catch that?”
“We will visit my parents too” Draco chimed in to help when Potter stuttered, he assumed they’d also share time with his parents, considering his parents in this world were nicer than his own world, especially his father “We haven’t figured out the exact time yet, but we will discuss it after the party tonight, as long as the Hufflepuff girls don’t make us drink” He laughed as the girls nodded along, so he was right. After living here for more than a month, he was getting better at improvising
” Draco cried out and buried his face in his hand. The jerk gave him so many stuff, now his house has
“I don’t know”
“Alright Aurors! You can leave now” Pansy waved her wand and the door opened under her magic. Most of the Aurors have already left, there was only Roger, who was pressing Theo back against his table, his face burying in the crook of Theo’s neck, so men were
!” He exclaimed angrily “Put me down”
Theo squealed as he has his arm around Neville’s “
“Hey” The door opened and Hermione walked out
“I’m not gonna tell you”
“Yeah, unless you don’t want to”
” Draco raised his tone, appalled by the sudden offer Harry made, he held his hand up to stop Harry from speaking “First, Harry, I still have a place, I’m not homeless. And second, why do you want me to live with you?”
“Hey, how did you do?”
“Since it’s already a new day now, I want to give you this for your birthday”
“What? I’m just annoyed, that’s all” Draco huffed, grazing his quill against his face as he stared at the boy sitting two rows above him, Potter looked exceptionally disgusting today. With his hair way too messed up, and he was joking around with Weasley next to him “I still can’t believe the Weasley girl dumped his arse”
He moaned when Harry thrusted in hard, his cock twitching and leaking precum, he could not handle anymore “
birthday, they were supposed to go on a nice dinner date, Pansy and Hermione were babysitting the kids for them, and Draco had put on his best outfit that he had designed himself, all for nothing, Draco closed his eyes and leaned on the couch, he could use a good sleep.
Draco babbled in a raspy voice, and if Harry wasn’t having Draco’s arse shoved at his face, he’d say it back, because he missed Draco so fucking much too. The Auror added the second finger and began scissoring Draco, opening him up, his other hand pulling the thong away and started stroking Draco’s cock, he could feel Draco arching his back and his legs were shaking a little “
“I showed you pictures all the time” Hermione nudged her
“Hmm?”
No word seemed to appear in Draco’s mind now that he was completely shocked by this fact. Their friends knew each other, they lived in the same building, their friends tried to matchmake them twice, and the fire tonight finally helped them meet each other “He’s…he isn’t my boyfriend anymore”
“Is that a…
He cursed when Blaise stroked his leaking cock quickly, bringing Ron to the edge
“Hop on” Potter looked back at him with a smile on his face “I’ll give you a piggyback”
“What?”
“Didn’t you hear it earlier? I
“Yeah” Harry said, looking down on the ground, breathing out softly. It was actually his plan, to
“It’s summer, everyone looks hot” Draco replied and both Pansy and Hermione sat up to look
“No, actually, it might be good” Ron said, considering how Harry was still not over Draco for the past years, maybe having a stripper in Slytherin robes giving him a lap dance would help “So how do you two know each other?”
Harry mumbled, Rose must have taken it out of his pocket when he carried her out of the kitchen, he should have known she got Pansy’s Slytherin side “
“Are you allowed to be this cute?” Harry tilted his chin up and kissed him softly
“I’m going to die” Draco groaned as they were hiking, they have been walking for hours in the forest and it felt like forever, his legs sworn to give out on him soon. The massage was amazing, but they tried kayaking earlier, and he was already tired because of that, and now, more walking.
single, you
is getting married in a few months, and you have no one”
” He nodded repeatedly, and Harry pulled him in a hug, he breathed out shakily “I really want that, all the things you said”
?” Draco asked when Harry didn’t finish his sentence, and since they understood each other, Draco slowly turned around to look at the direction Harry was staring at
“Oh, or do you?” Pansy winked, turning sideway to point at Draco, who was now standing in the corner of the room chatting with Ginny again, laughing softly “Since we’re all couples here, mostly, the rest have found the one to kiss? Except you,
” Theo turned the tap on and bent down to wash his face, he stood straight up again and looked at himself. He was a mess, his eyes were red at the rim, the water on his face was also tears, Theo balled his hand into a fist and slammed it on the mirror, watching his reflection disappeared as the mirror was shattered into pieces. He wanted to be done, he wanted to get over him, he blamed himself for doing this for himself, he hated himself again. The brunet’s hand was shaking, he pulled up his sleeve and picked up a piece of broken glass from the sink. He was back at square one again, wanting to hurt himself, he looked at the old scars on his forearm and bit on his lips, the knuckles of his right hand was bleeding from shattering the mirror, yet he didn’t feel a thing. Theo put the piece of glass closer to his arm shakily, if he pressed it on his skin, it would…
” Pansy scoffed at her wife
“Ask your
Harry said, this was it for him, there was no way he could back out of this, Draco knew him like the back of his hand “Ron downloaded the the videos, because, er, he said it’d help me get rid of some pent up sexual urges”
Draco dipped his bare feet into the sand and sighed, it was simply beautiful, the beach, the sky, the sun, the view was perfect, except…
nice, or whatever” Theodore sighed, ruffling his brown hair “It’s frustrating, I think I might like him”
Ron exclaimed, after a few rounds, they were the couple with the lowest point, they actually have no point at all, he kind of feel bad for Ron. Harry and him had gone for four rounds before that, he got “Duelling” first, which was fairly easy for him to do and for Harry to guess. The moment he got in position, raising his arm and pointing it at Harry, putting on the same smug look that year, Harry was already yelling out the answer after barely ten seconds.
?” He squeaked “Alright just push it all in” He said and grimaced when it went in deeper, how far could a cock go?
“Hey, what are you talking about?” Hermione leaned over with a puzzled look “I thought you are watching the opera”
“How?”
“I understand” He said, finally turning to Potter and giving him a smile “I feel the same when I heal people, like I’ve done something nice for them” He fidgeted with his fingers, trying to make out the rest of his sentence “And…I think you’d be a good Auror, just don’t get yourself hurt”
Hermione gaped, but Pansy knew she was just being dramatic, that must have resulted from years of living with Pansy, Hermione acted like her too “I’m a Muggleborn”
“Kissed you?” He said plainly, his hand clutching on his bag. He could
upset to neglect his own health “I don’t like it, just the thought of them together…”
“My Draco hates peas too” Harry was smirking at him now “And you love sweets but you despise white chocolate”
“I will never let you hate yourself” Blaise put his hands on the sink, cornering Ron between his arms “What do you want me to do? I will do everything you ask. You want me to stop talking to guys? I will, I’m very good at
going to surprise you” Theo spoke, one hand gripping on Neville’s leg and one hand covering his mouth to stop a laugh “But
“It’s Draco” Pansy said, shocking Ron as he stared at her speechlessly
“Then you’re gonna pass me the nuts and I will put it in the pan”
“If what Luna said is true, I think…yeah” Granger said, intertwining her hand with Pansy’s “We’d be together, of course. You’re the only one could handle me, right? You said you’d take responsibility and take care of me, you still are, and I love you for that” Granger kissed her cheek softly, and Pansy’s mood was immediately lifted up by her girlfriend, Draco was glad, he knew Pansy was disappointed from what he said. It was bad enough he told Pansy that, he couldn’t imagine what’d happen if he told Potter about it as well.
“Well, your dad’s hands are always cold” Harry crouched down to mumble to their six years old son, who was giggling at him “And my hands can warm him up. And in the summer, your dad’s hands can cool me down”
“Yeah, yeah I am” He sat up abruptly and looked at the big antique clock in the corner of the room, it was just few more minutes until midnight, he would be late
I was just wondering, if, er, you’re free tomorrow night”
“No, once you go back, you don’t hate him anymore, right?”
“Harry, you are as smooth as sandpaper” Draco snickered, pushing his blond hair behind his ear and continued, trying not to blush “You aren’t subtle at all, you hold my hands all the time, you gave me gloves and said I should use it when you’re not around. One time, you put my hands in your pockets to keep me warm” Draco recalled the memory, it still made him blush every time he thought about it.
“I know”
“Oh, right, have she told you about the thing?”
“Right, Celeste, did you notice?”
“I’m Harry, Harry Potter? Your boyfriend?”
“And I just
He could hear people around him whispering and mumbling, but he didn’t care, especially when the guy stopped in front of him again and rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders, long, delicate fingers gripping on Harry, something tingling appeared in his chest as the guy started gliding his hands down Harry’s clothed body from his neck down to his thighs. Every movement caused Harry’s skin to react, and as the blond guy slowly squat down, widening his legs, Harry could see the dark lace lingerie underneath the skirt. He kept his hands to himself, gripping on the chair and trying his best not to get hard in front of all his friends for a stripper. The guy slowly stood up, his hands still on Harry’s knees as he twirled his hips from side to side to the music. Harry felt something again in his chest when he finally locked eyes with the guy, it was something,
“Uncle Harry works out but you’re 5, darling. Aren’t you a little too old for that?”
“That’s a good idea” Neville agreed with his husband and walked behind the bar with Theo “She’s a very good chef and Ginny eats for three people, so she always cook more than enough to eat”
“Spin the wand!” Everyone was suggesting games that they’ve all played before. Draco sat down, before him was Harry and Ron, while he was squeezed between Theodore and Ernie Macmillan. Blaise didn’t play, he wasn’t the type of person to do it, but he was still watching them. For Ginny, she enjoyed alcohol more than games. And since Pansy was proving to Hermione she was responsible, she also didn’t join and decided to chaperone the party with Hermione.
“Harry?”
“So?”
“Draco” Potter stopped and looked at him “Just calm down and relax, alright? You can’t walk, and there’s a long way back, I could just carry you, stop being so stubborn”
“Er, oh look, my beer is empty, I better get another” Potter held the half empty beer bottle in his hand and stood up, prepared to run
“I just thought they were really,
“What? I’m not with her” Harry claimed, laughing a bit “Oh, is this about the rumour we’re back together?”
“Yeah?”
“What’s adorable?” Pansy turned around and asked them “Oh, is that a rock?”
turning forty “I’m too old for this”
“Yes, Rose?”
Bloody hell, Blaise, you take great pictures!”
“Hold my hand”
you girls called me when I was about to!”
“You don’t have a clue, do you?” Hermione let out a sigh before putting her sunglasses on like Pansy and leaned back on her chair “You poor child”
to be friends with him. But then when you insulted Ron,
Draco was getting sick of it “I know you’re just as cunning as I am”
“What? I just cut them” Hermione said
“Right” He replied cheekily and Harry pressed a soft kiss to his lips, Draco blushed and turned around, facing his back to Harry “Now spoon me”
Draco paused when he heard some noises from outside. It was two in the morning, who could it be? Draco shrugged and opened the door to the kitchen cabinet to grab a mug.
“All I’m saying is, you know when someone is
“Ask me to plan your wedding” Draco teased and they both started laughing
He even repeated what he said again, so it was true, Draco actually believed that, he wondered why, maybe he was secretly a romantic at heart.
” Draco rolled his eyes, he turned 30 just last month, and everyone, including his parents have been nagging him about getting a partner, he wanted to, there was just no right person for him “I’m just focusing on my job”
“You’re welcome” Hermione nodded at them, her hand also intertwined with Pansy. The things with Pansy and Hermione was rough, they stayed friends for two years, not knowing each other’s feelings, and finally started going out after one late night that Pansy helped Hermione with her work, they ended up kissing and something more than that, but Pansy never told them what they did more that night. Hermione had become the Minister for Magic twelve years ago, and Pansy, still proving she was a responsible and loving partner, always got Hermione’s back while she was also the head editor of Witch Weekly “All the kids are at the Burrow so we don’t have to worry about them. And…I guess we’ll leave you guys here for a walk down memory lane”
Harry? What the fuck?” Draco shouted at Harry, and Ron was in the stall, trying to stop himself from letting out any noise while Blaise fucking him again, slowly this time, every thrust was another hit at his prostate
“Er, what?”
“I don’t want to
“Here” Potter extended his hand to help but Draco just smirked and pulled him down with him “
“Hey” Potter said softly when he sat down next to him, Draco didn’t say anything back, he didn’t know what to say “I’m sorry if I grabbed on you too hard, I know you dislike it”
She nudged him and pushed him back in his spot when the break was over. He huffed softly and looked the other way, he noticed that guy too. Different height, smaller and thinner than Draco, clinging on Harry throughout the break.
He felt familiar, Harry concluded, the way the guy’s fingers grazed over Harry’s rough skin, the way he leaned over and he could smell the coconut scent from his long hair, but everything else was vague, it wasn’t clear enough for Harry to see further, like his face, he wanted to know who this guy was, he wanted bad.
, so we have to do it again”
“Sorry” Pansy gave Hermione a peak on the cheek and turned to Draco “He will know eventually, the truth always comes out”
Draco let out a cry when Harry pushed the third finger in, stretching the blond out. Damn the Auror for teasing him “
“Wait for me here, alright?” He said, watching Draco nodded with a puzzled look on his face as he rushed up to their bedroom, he has to do it today. Harry grabbed the pillow and saw the ring box underneath. Luckily it was still here, Harry quickly ran down only to see Draco ending a Firecall and grabbing his robes “What’s wrong?”
“What?”
“I am the view” The man answered confidently and the blond pinched the bridge of his nose before staring at the man with tired eyes
“Plus, you never spend it there” Weasley chuckled loudly and brought her girlfriend up to the girls’ dormitory
“Hey, where have you been?” Draco stood up from his chair when he saw Potter approaching their table, it was in the restaurant near where Pansy and Hermione’s table will be, it wasn’t too far so they could still watch the girls, but not too close so they could eavesdrop on them.
“Hermione?”
He said louder and finally Potter opened his eyes, releasing his grip on Draco “You should go to sleep”
Anyway, I hope you love this! Thank you all for reading!
Ginny said after chugging her first glass of wine “I need to warm myself up” Harry straightened his robes and sat down, he has never felt so nervous before. Normally he’d do it with strangers around, but this time his friends were all here, Draco and him had a falling out, so that made it harder to propose because there was still some kind of wall between them now, how would he even be able to break it?
“Are you serious?” Harry beamed at him, tilting his eyebrows up, he was surprised and definitely horny again
“You are not” Hermione pushed a lock of hair behind Theo’s ear and trailed her soft hand down his face “Have you ever considered…you love him too much? That’s why it hurts?”
“That’s not the point” Harry snorted, kissing Draco’s cheek “You know that”
“So, you guys are not the only two that became a couple today” Hermione winked at Harry and Draco
” Potter looked at him and glanced around the hospital wing, holding his right arm while his face was slightly frowning, he wasn’t sure it was caused because he saw Draco or because of the pain “Is Madam Pomfrey here?”
Pansy grabbed his shoulders and shook him “What the fuck?”
She said, clapping her hands and everyone opened their eyes “Oh, and if you have the same names, please sit on each other’s lap”
“Oh right, sorry” Ginny quickly let go of her hands and embraced her wife close “Again,
“Round 2?” Harry shrugged, wiggling his eyebrows seductively, only to receive a chuckle from the blond
“I just don’t want to
“Harry, what is it?”
Harry quickly stepped back and covered the bulge, the towel could barely trap it in. It amazed Harry how he could get hard without knowing and just by Draco standing so close to him “It’s just, you know, you were close”
“Er, yeah? What’s wrong? Is there any problem with the case?” Potter said, and Draco knew he was just trying to avoid the huge elephant in the room
“You know, you shouldn’t be so hard on her”
“I’ve had people saying I am” Potter gave him a cheeky grin “I thought these gloves could occupy your hands when I’m not there”
“Come on, we all know you’re thinking that” Hermione smiled at him and Draco avoided her knowing eyes, he couldn’t have been staring at Harry that long, he looked down at his empty cup and turned to her.
” He mumbled, his hand stroking his own cock. Theo cried out, his back arched, his cock spurting over his stomach, his mouth fell opened and pulled Neville in a kiss, he clenched his entrance and heard Neville groaning a small “
“Draco Malfoy, I know I’ve proposed to you a thousand times before, and you’ve said yes a thousand times as well, I hope this time, you’ll say yes again” Harry said, looking at his reflection in the mirror, he was hiding in the bathroom, practicing his speech for tomorrow. It’s been a year since they started dating, and Harry thought it was time for him to do it,
Harry whispered so quietly before thrusting in with full force, Draco could actually feel his body moving on the beach
me” He said and Draco huffed out a laugh before pushing Harry slightly away
” Draco moaned, Harry smiled and kept licking around the rim, pushing his tongue slowly inside. Based on the sounds the blond made, Harry was doing a good job. He swirled his tongue around Draco’s walls, slipping in deeper as far as he could get, with his hand still stroking Draco’s leaking cock, rubbing the precome all over the head “
, don’t you remember? He confessed to you during a Quidditch match? Last year?” Pansy said the same thing as Potter but Draco wasn’t able to say anything, so she kept going “He caught the snitch, when he flew to you, he gave you the snitch and said that he likes you. The crowd went crazy, Harry’s dad cried a bit. Everyone said it’s the confession of the century”
“You’re lying”
“Believe it,
“Oh, no” Draco shook his head, quickly coming up with a lie while Pansy nudged him with her foot from under the table “We thought that we might have shown…a lot of affection towards each other in public”
you anyway”
Harry isn’t really the best at excuses, is he?
“What?”
“One”
“Yeah, our spot” Draco huffed out a small laugh “Er, so, you said you like someone right?”
“I’m not sure, I think some just want to hear Harry talk, they love him” Hermione shrugged, Draco squinted his eyes and left quietly as Ron asked Hermione about her summer plan. Draco finally found Pansy next to the table full of drinks and pulled her by her arm
“Only if you ask me nicely” He bit on his lips and smiled, holding Harry’s hand again
“Oh come on” Ron whined when the lift started going down, he couldn’t see, but he could feel it “You
“I love it when you do the fun fact thing” Pansy chuckled “You never run out of facts”
“Is that why I was told the mirror in the bathroom on this floor was shattered two days ago?” Hermione chuckled “And your hand was bandaged?”
Draco mumbled when Harry stroke his half hard cock, making it come alive again, the Auror smiled and kissed Draco’s lips before moving to his jawline, licking a stripe up to his ear. Draco started moaning louder when Harry wouldn’t stop stimulating him all over his body “
“Oh, mate” Ron sighed, gripping his shoulder “To be fair, none of us knew about it, except Pansy, I guess he just thought he couldn’t get the position there. But, er, are you alright?”
“Just a stupid hex” Harry shook it off “Still stings a bit, Ron got some too”
“Come on, get up so I can scoot over” Harry laughed softly and watched Draco got up, they all sat a little closer so the blond can squeeze in, just like that, they all started talking.
still together in a way, right? No matter how much you try to avoid Harry, or hide your feelings, it’s still there”
Why…why were you…” Draco sat there, still not moving an inch, he has put a white blouse with a pair of trousers on, his long hair was still in a bun “Why do you…have a file filled with pornography with my name on it?”
“Sorry for the mess” Harry said cheekily, letting Draco down on his feet and grabbed a few pieces of clothes on the bed and the floor to throw it in the laundry basket “Er, I wasn’t expecting any guest”
“Shut up” He kicked Theo back for revenge and grabbed his wine glass
in your life”
relationship, because let’s face it, you two have known each other for, what? Sixteen years now, you know each other from inside and out, I know a Slytherin like you won’t give up on things that easy, I know you will work on it, until you know you can’t anymore”
“This is the Mirror of Erised, I’ve seen it, but it’s cracked now” He pointed his wand at the mirror and looked at Draco “Is it really broken?”
“Well you fucked him, of course he’ll say hi to you” Ron scowled “It’s tiring, Blaise! To see everyone around me and wonder, have you fucked this one? I will never get that secured feelings and do you
solution he has right now.
” Harry groaned low, his hands on Draco’s waist as the blond began riding slowly on his husband
” He nodded and looked back at the board, clearing his throat and trying to forget what had just happened “Robards said he assigned this case for Auror Potter and Auror Weasley to solve, your files are in front of you, meeting dismissed” He put the pictures on the white board back in his files and watched as the Aurors left the room, he glanced at a certain someone and spoke up when he intended to flee
“The past three months was the worst time that I had to go through. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I think about you all the time” He said, his hands trembling just as Draco’s cheeks started to heat up “When I got here, seeing you with all those people, I was…I thought you had moved on, and maybe you have, but I decided to say this anyway”
house, he quickly swept Draco off his feet and carried him up like a bride
My husband is calling, probably emergency” Ron pulled out his Muggle phone from his pocket and answered, the phone wasn’t even ringing at all “
Seamus pointed at the invisible broom under him and raised his arm high, swatting it in the air
” He bit on his lower lip and pulled Potter in a tight embrace when he felt the length being pushed into him. It hurts, that was all he could feel, it fucking hurt like a fucking bitch when Potter pushed in, it felt like his hole was going to break, could it break?
” Draco laughed “Just keep going”
He mumbled as he was out of breath, Harry finally pulled out and the moment he did, Draco craved for it again, he just couldn’t help it.
one steals Harry away” She pointed at a guy with brown hair, standing next to Harry during the break “Hermione and I noticed he has been talking to Harry a lot”
“We did, we have never done it this much though” Potter answered and he stopped to wait for Draco to catch up. He hated climbing, hiking, or anything that makes him sweat, except sex, of course, he assumed...he has never done it before though
“So we were both mutually obsessed with each other” Harry hummed, flashing him a huge grin “Then we must be destined to be together”
“I need your help with something” Potter said, ignoring his words “It’s for the upcoming N.E.W.T.s on History of Magic”
called for the emergency meeting, Harry. Now everyone’s just waiting for you”
“Thanks” Draco smiled and pushed him away “Now go, Theo’s expecting you, oh wait”
“You’re weird, Harry, and stop calling me by my full name” Draco chuckled as he pulled out a small black box from under his bed and Harry quickly sat down next to him “Now, if you make fun of me, I
“Don’t
“You could heal yourself” Colin suggested with a soft smile, but Theo shook his head. He didn’t heal it, because he wanted to feel the pain there, to know he was still alive, to know he should never hurt himself again
“Have I ever broken a promise?” He asked, looking into Draco’s eyes under the dimming light in his bedroom, just looking at Draco made him aroused
“Can you please just look at me?” Neville pleaded, but Theo just moved to his right, reaching for the buttons
“Draco, are you alright? What do you mean their first names?”
” Draco begged, breath hitching when he felt Harry angling his cock at his entrance, his fingers balled into fists and his toes curled when Harry began pushing in. The Auror wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, holding him flushed and didn’t let go, he kissed the blond’s shoulders and Draco exhaled the breath he didn’t know he was holding when Harry finally pushed it all in.
“None of that is okay, you should not scare me next time” Draco nudged him gently as Harry took his bag and held it for the blond “Now that Ginny is about to teach me some moves to defend myself, I could knock you out”
” Draco shut Harry up with another kiss before tearing away, looking at what he accomplished “You like it?”
“I wanted to help you, Potter, but it seems like you’re a brat that can’t hold a decent conversation with others”
“Then let’s talk” Ginny grinned, Draco pressed his lips into a thin line and looked around the house. Memories flooding back to him like hell, he could feel the tears forming back on the rim of his eyes “How was y-…”
“So, er, yeah, I left”
Ron breathed out when Blaise teared his shirt opened after pulling Ron’s robes off, the buttons on his shirt flew everywhere, he latched on Ron’s chest, his hands caressing the redhead’s waist “
“Yeah” Theo swallowed hard and bit on his lips when Neville leaned closer. When their lips touched, it was soft, mixed with the salty taste of his tears, Neville cupped his face and kissed him harder. Theo smiled into the kiss, he was finally happy, he wrapped his arms around Neville’s neck, opening his mouth so the Auror could slip his tongue in, Theo hummed, feeling his body heat rising again, it has been so long since he felt the heat again.
” Pansy said when Lucius took a step forward “He’s
“I hate you, I hate you,
“We know” Blaise replied and hit the button to Level Two. Soon they were walking in the Auror Headquarters and Pansy was at the end of the hall, waving at them
“Yes” Draco nodded, taking off his robes and putting the sweater on outside of his white shirt. Harry fixed his collar for him and cupped his face, peppering him with light kisses all over his face until he burst into laughter “
“I don’t think you would want them to love me
“No, be

was” Hermione said, eyeing Harry, everyone knew Harry has a thing for Draco, so when Draco told them this
“I’ll make you scream so loud, our friends will hear it”
“What? Seriously?” Hermione gasped with joy and looked at the chocolate “O-oh,
“Er, yeah, I’m pretty much alone. I only visit my parents whenever I have time, I usually go to the pubs with my friends when I’m free. Other than that, I work, so I don’t really have time for, you know, dating” Harry replied, pouring the juice into the mug that he just grabbed from the fridge, Draco could not take his eyes off Harry, even if he wanted to. Draco was a bit relieved when he heard the answer, it meant that Harry was single as well.
Ron said, immediately locked his hands around Blaise so he could cover him.
“Daddy” Draco turned his head to look at their son, who was holding a lollipop in his hand “My wrist hurts, I just bumped into a statue” He pouted, showing Draco his wrist as the blond held it up.
Pansy yelled as soon as Draco was dragging Harry down the stairs “You’re up late”
“Alright” Harry snickered, accepting Draco’s reason. He crouched down and slipped his strong arms under Draco, one on his back and one behind his knees, he quickly scooped Draco up in a swift movement, carrying Draco in bridal style. Draco made a small yelping sound and was shocked when Harry was able to carry him so easily and quickly, as if Draco weighed nothing at all
“Can I…can I hug you?” Potter said without looking at him “It’s hard for me to sleep if I don’t hug you, but it’s fine, if you don’t want to”
far from now, but well, I will” Theo winked at him and leaned closer to mumble “So…I noticed something”
” Draco laughed and squirmed when Harry started attacking him with kisses. Eventually he slowed his speed down and focused on kissing Draco, he worked his hands down Draco’s trousers and pulled it off, throwing it carelessly on the floor, the blond locked his legs around Harry’s waist randomly, guiding Harry’s hand to rest on Draco’s arse. Harry took it as an invite, along with Draco’s small pleased sighs every time Harry sucked on a sensitive point on his neck.
“I’m okay”
Draco watched her walk away and looked back at Harry, who locked eyes with him as he spoke up “Do you want to be my boyfriend?” The blond chuckled at him and gave him a curt nod.
” He said, turning around himself, his hands resting on the wall, he could feel Blaise’s hot skin against him, he had already pulled his fingers out and Ron could feel his cock poking his arse
…” He paused to lick Blaise’s earlobe and added “Ropes and handcuffs too”
“Some
good”
“I’m sorry, can this make it up?” Blaise pulled out a bar of chocolate from his pocket and showed Ron “I got ten more like this back at home”
’, and we kept looking at the sky” The blond looked down and put his legs under the girls’ warm blanket “Then after a few days, I apologised to him, he apologised to me too. After a few months, we’d just go up there and sat there together, sometimes we’d talk, sometimes we’d just be quiet”
“No” Potter mumbled back to him “I should be the one who runs to you, I just…I thought…”
“Yes, please, thank you” Draco quickly scribbled down the address in a small piece of parchment and handed Ernie, the boy holding it in his hands dearly like it was a treasure chest to him. He lunged at Draco and squeezed him in a tight hug, to which he felt really uncomfortable but decided to let it slide due to Ernie’s joy “Okay, enough” Draco said after ten seconds and Ernie finally broke away. He gave Ernie one last polite smile before bidding him goodbye and skipping away. Draco exhaled softly, turning around and he was greeted by Harry, who was standing right behind him “Harry, hi”
Harry groaned mentally when Ron yelled. What crazy thing did his friends come up with now? Harry thought as he walked up to the middle of the room, now that everyone has stood around the chair, wondering what Ron was going to say. He has been talking with everyone,
“Now you’re saying nonsense” He replied, ignoring what Harry just said, he couldn’t believe the words of a drunk person, he should know that
“It’s fine” Draco rubbed his wrist unknowingly, it didn’t cause much pain, but he was surprised at how Potter actually apologised for that
he confessed, and the git didn’t even remember any of it
regret leaving you”
“Look at the lovebird” Pansy startled the both of them from behind, with Granger grinning at them
“Yeah, really” Weasley squinted his eyes and leaned closer “But why do you ask? Are you having doubts on the relationship? Did Harry do something wrong to you?”
“Oh, well, maybe it was Draco falling from the bed, you see, he can’t move at all”
“Want to go out there again?” Harry asked and Draco gave him a curt nod, standing up and letting Harry lead him out. The sweater made him warmer for some reasons, and he felt like this night has gone better than he ever expected.
As Pansy left for the meeting, Draco found himself walking to his usual place every day, he has created this habit of coming here every time he got a break, or when he needed to think. Pansy was telling him all sorts of things about Potter today and he needed to clear his mind. When the door finally appeared, Draco opened it to walk in. There was a big mirror inside, this wasn’t what he asked. Draco stared at the empty Room of Requirement and hesitated to walk in, normally when he got here, he only asked for a place to think, so it was always empty, but today, there was a mirror in it.
“Do you know every morning, I’d wake up to you telling me how my hair looks like birds could nest in it, and my bed can be a house for rats? And my clothes are always everywhere?” Harry laughed, looking at him with kind eyes “There’s not a day you go without throwing a few insults at me, but I know you mean well, it means you care about me”
“Any time is drink time” Pansy clicked her tongue and winked at Draco “Come on, just go up there, settled down, and get back down here with us”
“They’ll be in like…three seconds” Hermione looked at the watch Pansy gave her on her birthday and turned to the door, Draco’s heart raced a bit when it opened, he realised a few familiar faces, but no sign of Harry
” Draco begged, holding his legs up, inviting Harry in. The Auror concluded that Draco begging was one of the sights he absolutely loved now
” He said firmly “You did this for me, and I want to do something to make up for it. Absolutely anything!”
“What?”
let’s not forget that new Auror chick who just got transferred from America. Ron told me…what’s her name?”
” Harry widened his eyes, his hands clutching on the table when Draco started rubbing the bulge between Harry’s legs, the blond smirked and licked a spot under Harry’s ear. He was lucky enough to have the table covering his hand, so it just seemed like he was putting his hand on Harry’s thigh
“Your pain is on your shoulder, I need to get a closer look to see if there is any bruise. And if there is, I need to check on its colour. You can’t roll up your sleeve that high” Draco said, as much as he disliked it, it was non-negotiable. When Potter gave him a nod, Draco raised his hand to start taking off his tie and unbuttoning his shirt. More and more skins were revealed, and it wasn’t like Draco hasn’t seen other students here before. Lots of them have accidents during Quidditch, he was used to it already, but seeing Potter’s was an entirely different thing, it was a messed up thought he has.
“Please me, Harry” He could hear Draco teasing him, wiggling his arse until the Auror grabbed hold of his two round globes “
“Hey, do you think Harry really loves me?” He asked again, Weasley stopped writing and looked up at him with weird eyes
“A pet name?”
night. Draco got more pale, but Harry wasn’t sure if he was correct, his eyes were still…sad and there were bags under it, his lips pressed together when Harry looked at him, and memories of that night came back to Harry all over again.
Ron jolted, stuttering while trying the right words to say “Er, you, er, you found my computer?”
“That’s confusing”
“You’re killing me here, Ron” Draco overheard Hermione trying to explain something for Ron in the library. Seemed like they were still good friends. When his eyes met Harry, Draco quickly turned away, walking to the table where Blaise was sitting
Draco rubbed his red and sore wrist, leaning his back on the wall “What the hell is wrong with you?”
“No, thank you” Blaise gave him a death glare before going back to writing “I’d rather tutor ten Pansy than one of him, he’d loud and obnoxious”
look muscular even behind all of these uniforms, Draco felt like if he looked at Harry’s stomach really closely, he could imagine his abs. Draco quickly dismissed the dirty thought and cleared his throat
, he said ‘
“I, er, I don’t hate him”
He could sense that Harry was smiling when his fingers sped up, Draco arched his back and moaned out loud “
“Yes, you can” She leaned up and kissed his forehead gently, the way Harry used to as well “Look, you two broke up for a stupid reason—…”
” Pansy spoke first, when he got home, the first thing he did was calling the girls, they were all home and were able to talk to him. He could
“Chilling by the pool” Pansy smiled while saying it “Just, chilling, with cocktails”
Harry pulled his fingers away and Draco let his mouth fell open when his husband was stroking his cock again “
“We know” They said in unison, pushing him away “Go, change into something good”
that’s when I got back, I was…used to calling you that” He admitted shyly with a smile
” Draco crouched down and looked at his boyfriend “
“Did it get in your eyes?
“Can I see it?” Draco mumbled between broken kisses
“Er, thank you, you know” Potter sat back down on his booth and looked at Draco “For saving me, I didn’t really know—…”
“You are”
with her until the day we both die of
do this bring this box of chocolate back in my dorm and eat it
“Honey, everyone knows what you mean” Luna patted Ginny’s arm softly and smiled
Draco’s heart skipped a beat when he saw a flash of someone’s shadow on the far right at a turn, he needed to go there, if the creep saw another person, they might go away. The blond’s eyes widened with hope when someone turned the corner and was walking his way. The guy was tall, he was wearing jeans with a white t-shirt and a black leather jacket, Draco couldn’t see his face clearly but he looked strong and rugged, he might be able to help, Draco has got nothing to lose now.
“Yeah, you can’t blame him for being so
“Come on, you’re tired” Harry smiled at him and Draco hesitated for a second before climbing on Harry’s back, he was just so exhausted already, he couldn’t walk anymore
He heard Pansy squealed quietly in front of them, but he was still gazing into Draco’s eyes, who was grinning at him. When the blond suddenly winked, Harry knew Draco was just teasing him, that no matter what he did, he still didn’t have feelings for Harry, which made his whole happy mood go down quite fast.
He finally lied down on the sand as Harry got on top of him, his hand caressing Draco’s jawline
” He spoke and the blond stood up, slowly settling down on Potter’s lap, it was soft and warm, kind of felt familiar, like he could get used to this, he bet the other Draco was already used to it. The blond jolted when Potter wrapped his arms around his waist, he leaned his forehead on Draco’s shoulder and breathed out deeply. Pansy sent him a soft smile, maybe this Potter just really missed his Draco here, it was like he couldn’t live without him. Draco leaned comfortably back on Potter’s chest and made himself enjoy the feeling, it wasn’t awkward like how he had imagined it’d be, maybe it was just the effect of this new world, Draco could only guess so.
” He murmured, but the rest of his sentence was swallowed by Neville, the Auror pushed in slowly, and Theo arched his back, pushing back as well “
“Hey” Weasley opened the door with a beer bottle in his hand and a drunken smile on his face “Come in, guys!”
, the only seat left for you is next to Harry,
Neville ran in the lift with him before it closed and stood in front of Theo
“Still haven’t proposed to him?”
“Actually, you could” Draco said softly “I trust you, I really do. You influence me a lot, and Pansy”
He gaped but Pansy only shrugged and walked away. What was she talking about? He exhaled and glanced at Harry, who was still talking to Hermione, he turned to look at Draco. And the blond’s heart skipped a beat, just by looking, he was still able to sweep Draco off his feet. He felt his throat burning up and he looked back at Lilian “I’m sorry, I’m just a mess right now”
, Harry, we all know Ron’s type is interracial. Have you
“Are you telling me the truth?”
“I’ve met them” Pansy nodded, sighing out deeply “They are horrible people, even more horrible than Draco’s parents”
“Wait, how do you two know?”
“I beg your pardon?” Draco put a hand on his chest, stepping back with a raised eyebrow “No, I’m not, where did you get that idea?”
“Er, I wasn’t mocking you” Potter said and Draco looked up at him “I just, it’s a funny story, I was going to give you this” He showed the box to Draco when the blond reached out to grab it, Potter pulled the box back, perhaps he wanted to say something first. Needless to say, Draco was still in complete shock “I…I was laughing because I just told Ron and Hermione that I was going to give you
“I don’t want to play with you”
” Hermione said, taking Draco’s concentration off of Pansy “There are only two options left for you, besides Harry”
“It’s alright” Potter gripped on the man’s arm tightly and chuckled “People ask him out a lot when I’m not around. It’s our fifth-year anniversary, I just went to grab the sunscreen for him, can’t let this gem get ruined by the sun, right? He’s beautiful, isn’t he?”
“Oh, well, close your eyes” Potter said as Draco narrowed his eyes. What was he planning on? “I promise won’t do anything inappropriate without your consent”
what you have to do when you think it’s time” She smirked, her eyes twinkling under the light, Harry took a deep breath and nodded, he wanted to do it too.
” Pansy added from afar and got back to eating
” Draco’s hands trembled as he untied the knot, ripping the papers off nicely and stunned at what he was seeing. He picked up the soft fabric in his shaking hands, it was a dark green sweater with his initial on, the letter ‘D’ knitted in red colour and stood out amazingly, the sweater was warm in his hands. He felt his eyes damp and blinked the tears away, only to let it fall on the sweater.

thing”
who I love so deeply that my best friend thinks the best solution is to watch Muggle pornography portrayed by actors who look like him. You know who that person is?”
Theo shouted, raising his glass first in the air
” He said, looking up at the girls “No”
“Why didn’t you find him?”
“Brandon”
“What? Would you rather I say he stops fucking people just to fuck Ron?”
now Draco felt guilty for lashing out at him again. Draco didn’t do it on purpose, he just wanted everything back to normal. He could not help smiling back every time Potter smiled at him, he could not help feeling all soft inside whenever Potter did something nice for him, and he could not help but liking the feeling of Potter’s warmth against him. He was finding himself falling for Potter in this world, only after a month of being here. Maybe he was just
“Can I ask you things now?”
his cock convulsed and his body jerked, spilling all of him inside Draco. He still kept stroking lazily inside the blond, unwilling to break apart.
“I’m glad, it’s scary to see your message saying you’re in danger from an hour ago” Hermione breathed out, bending down to take her heels off “We are
” He cried out when Potter hit a spot inside him, from his moan, it was like Potter got the signal, and all he did was hitting that same spot over and over again. Now that he was used to Potter’s size, the pain was overpowered by pleasure. Potter bit gently on his hard bud while fucking into Draco, the blond arched up and desired more, Potter intertwined his hands with Draco’s tightly, swallowing the blond’s moan when they kissed.
” Ginny exclaimed “For you, and Draco, we want to help, well, we
grow on trees, well, at least for the Aztecs, they used cacao beans as currency. And in the 1500s, in the state of Tlaxcala, central Mexico, you could buy these items at a marketplace with cacao: one good turkey hen, 100 beans, one turkey egg, three beans, or one large tomato for one bean”
“Sorry, miss you too much” Harry grinned, pressing his hand on the Gryffindor’s chest, Draco smiled at him and squeezed his grip on their hands. Harry was too much for him to handle, in a good way.
, have been in a secret relationship for
“Yeah? Oh, do you need a towel or something?”
! What do you mean?” Pansy reached over and grabbed Draco’s hands to hold them in hers “I can do it for you. Just, don’t, don’t go on a date”
you!”
“And, I like you, I want to be with you, I want to take care of you, I want us to have those funny couple shirts like Luna and Ginny, or we can become the wise married couple like Hermione and Pansy, or like Dean and Seamus, who travels the world together. The point is…I want to be with you, to the end of the world, I want to…I want to do normal stuff with you, I want to just sit and talk to you, I want to go travel with you, I want to wake up next to you. And we’d fight, and we’d argue but we’ll always kiss and makeup, and I’d never let you go. And one day I want to ask for your hand in marriage, even if it means I’d be chased and hexed by your father, I’d still want to marry you, and I want to raise dogs with you, or cats, or both. And we can live in a house together and I can make breakfasts for you and you’d kiss me before I go to work and you’d be there when I come home and-…”
“Wait a minute” Hermione gave them a suspicious look “Is that why one of the lifts in the Ministry didn’t work for half an hour today?”
“Oh, I’m an alcoholic, so I drink three glasses at a time, you know, I
“Alright, you know what? We’re going to go first” Pansy gave them a frown and pulled Hermione along with her “
“Right, this cologne will help you with a lot of things” He said again, he wouldn’t want to be fired on his first day, Draco held the cologne bottle tight in his hand and smiled “And spray with permission”
“Er…Do you mean it?” Harry spoke and Draco looked back at him “When you say you’re in love with me? The other me?”
“I can’t believe you can actually guess all of that” Seamus said in awe “Like without any act wrong”
” Pansy tapped on his shoulder and Draco whipped around to see her “Why are you sweating so much? Have you given him your chocolates?”
will know” Hermione rolled her eyes and kept walking “We’re both going in detention if you do that”
er” Ron stuttered, looking at the quiet crowd, swallowing hard. Harry gave up, it was too bloody uncomfortable, he left his spot and headed for somewhere peaceful, so he could avoid all of this.
” Draco nudged the Auror and blushed “You just said it was 10 Galleons”
“You know, you’ve gotten all weird since you disappeared that day” She squinted her eyes at him but he only chuckled back, opening the book
you so,
“Yeah” Potter said while Draco was still speechless, Ron nodded slowly and stepped back a few steps
“We’re boyfriends, Harry, of course I like you, but I’m not obsessed” He said, snatching the articles from Harry’s hands as his boyfriend dug in for more. It was more like a hobby for him as a kid and he refused to think otherwise “And you’re no different, you used to stare at my dot on the Marauder’s Map for hours and even before you go to sleep” Draco smirked as Harry stared at him with wide eyes “Oh yeah, Ron talks a lot when I give him sweets”
“On our two-year anniversary, we went back to Hogwarts” Pansy winked at them and intertwined her hand with Hermione “You guys know the rest” She smirked, then Hermione leaned over and whispered something into her ear
“Hey, Granger, the Slytherin has a party this week, would you and everyone from Gryffindor like to join?” He turned to Hermione, earning a gasp from Pansy “Other Houses are invited too”
You said Ron named the file after my name so the person you like wouldn’t suspect it”
I’m sorry, you are?”
“I don’t really know, I was searching for socks and found it, I just thought I could bring it”
Hermione stood up and Ron stepped back, pulling Blaise with him “
“Hey, having a wife who’s the Minister for Magic is just useful” Pansy winked at him again and sighed “I just really hope they get together this time. After all, they’re both forty now, better late than never” Ron smiled and nodded softly. Harry was his best mate, Draco was his friend too, for once, he supported Pansy’s crazy plan
Harry gasped with a smile at the screen “And you girls!”
“What’s wrong?”
“Doesn’t he always do that?”
“The moment you kissed me during that game, even if it’s not a real kiss” Harry reminded him “I think I’ve fallen for you. I think it started when you called me Harry”
“Okay, everyone, calm down” Blaise spoke and put his hands on Ron’s “We’ll just have to order another one”
“I’m so sorry”
“You won’t go to your best friend’s opening with his husband?” Hermione tilted her head, slowly persuading him with her soothing words “They have been working on the restaurant for months, you know”
Draco hummed and tilted his head to the side, inviting Harry to devour him as he latched onto the pulse point on Draco’s neck “
happens to her, I will kill
“Rose” Draco tilted his head a little, his lips frowning “Why do you ask that?”
“Are you serious? I’ve had enough with Gryffindor” She pulled at his collar and lowered her voice “I have to talk to Granger, see her, listen to her every single day now. Do you know how annoyed I am? I rolled my eyes so much, it hurts!”
“Are you alright?” Blaise mumbled in his ear and put his hand on the wall so that if Ron ever banged his head again, it’d be on Blaise’s hand. The redhead shook his head, resting his forehead on Blaise’s hand with a smile
” Draco put his finger on Harry’s lips and shushed him “I
He put his finger under Harry’s chin, leaning in closely and pressed a soft kiss on the Auror as they walked through a door and Draco guessed they were in Harry’s bedroom now
“Yes, Draco” Harry stood up, pulling him by his waist until their bodies were flushed against each other. Draco wrapped his arms around his boyfriend’s neck, ghosting his breath over Harry’s lips.
“Kill me now” Draco groaned and walked to the door “Let’s just go” He took one last look from the king size bed filled with roses and walked out of the room
“You’re tired, I’m not” Potter tried to convince him “Quick, we need to catch up with the girls. We can’t protect them if you can’t follow” He said, and for once, Draco hated that Potter was right. He mumbled a quiet “
“I have never loved anyone, how would I know it’s love?” He scoffed and she clicked her tongue at him
way, but with Harry’s personalities, he didn’t have much hope, the git never liked him anyway
“Don’t fret over it, Davies is quite nice”
” Pansy chuckled quietly, stepping back and pulling her daughter with her “Maybe you should go find James, I think I saw him in the kitchen” She said and the little girl squealed before running out of the room. Pansy turned to look at them and shook her head with her hands on her hips “
“Pansy, it’s
“Er…dur-during our…” Draco stuttered, because he remembered it so much, it was still there clear in his mind “When I couldn’t sleep, because of the nightmares, I would snuck up to the Ravenclaw Tower, and sat there, to look at the stars” He mumbled “And one time, Harry was there when I got there, at first we just sat in different corners, then gradually, we sat next to each other and didn’t say a thing, just look at the stars”
” Draco slowed his movements and fiddled with the spoon, twirling it around the small soufflé bowl. Harry sensed something bad, he could feel it, Draco rarely stuttered, ever “I have something to tell you”
“Oh” Harry rolled his sleeves up, revealing the Muggle watch on his wrist and looked at it before answering “Ten minutes until midnight”
Pansy called out to him, pulling at his robes and spinning him around
be more in trouble than this, it was his worst day ever, could be his last, but he didn’t want to think of anything bad. Everything came to him like a flood, he hasn’t told his mom he loved her yet this week, the last time his dad and him talked, it ended in a fight and him storming out of his parents’ house. He hasn’t told his friends so much, he hasn’t finished his design for the week, Pansy and Hermione’s wedding happened in May but he might not be able to make it, there were sweats beading on his forehead, Draco didn’t want his life to end like this.
“This is a small place once you’ve stayed here for years, he’s gonna find you anyway” Pansy told him, her hand still holding onto her girlfriend’s shoulder, making sure Hermione was walking straight with her eyes on her book “Plus he got that map”
“Oh no, they’ve never dated each other. They always say they’re like brother and sister” Pansy shook her head, showing another picture of Hermione sitting in the library with Blaise and Ron focused on a book next to her “I took this one, she’s pretty, right? For Ron there, he’s shacking up with Blaise” Pansy whispered “What they’re doing is purely physical, but what they’re feeling is definitely romantic, but Ron won’t admit it, they didn’t even tell anyone they’re sleeping together yet, that’s what I think” Draco stood frozen on the ground, what kind of sick world was he in? Did he get transported into another world? Where Granger was with Pansy, Blaise doing it with Weasley, and Potter was his boyfriend?
“Er, yeah, all the time, we have to train a lot to be able to carry people” Harry said, as Draco looked at the firefighter up and down. He
Theo squealed, raising his hand up in the air that was intertwined with Neville “Just this afternoon after the photoshoot”
“You see where I’m going with this?” Harry muttered seductively, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, his beard tickling the blond. Harry started growing his beard out years ago, and Draco absolutely loved it, the blond tilted his head to the side, inviting Harry in for more as the firefighter’s hand slipped under Draco’s outfit. He felt shivers running up and down his spine when Harry kept nibbling the sensitive spots on his neck, his hands were playing with Draco’s nipples, the blond pushed his arse back to Harry’s crotch when he felt the bulge already poking him. Harry grabbed the blond by his chin and turned his head around, locking their lips together in for a heated kiss. Kissing Harry has always felt the same, like he was being devoured by a beast, in a good way, and he always begged for more, his kisses were both tender and intense at the same time. He could taste the champagne off Harry’s tongue, he felt his skin burning a bit when Harry’s beard kept scratching his face, his hands reaching around to undo his husband’s belt.
“A firefighter named
“Pretty much” Pansy hummed in agreement
“Yeah”
“Did you make any?”
“Er, you remembered” Harry bit his lips, smiling at Draco and scratched the nape of his neck, Draco observed every single move Harry made, he was simply…fascinated “I didn’t mean to bail on our date, but there was an emergency, a store was on fire, so, er, I had to. I was actually outside of the restaurant that night and when I saw you…I was…er, anyway I got the call immediately after” Harry said, looking down a bit. Draco wondered what would have happened if Harry had showed up at that date, would they become a couple since then? “And a year ago, I moved in this building, and I saw you a few times, er, but then I saw your boyfriend, so I didn’t make any move”
He cursed, his hand slipping into Draco’s messy bun, grasping it gently when the head of his cock hit the back of Draco’s throat. He quickly pulled Draco up and kissed the blond again, feeling unable to resist him.
“Yes, mother, just a second, I’ll be right back” He gave them a curt nod before running out of the door to his Manor. His pace quickened the closer he got to the gate “
“Oh, me?” Ron said when Lucius asked him, he looked down at the pile of clothes in his arms and chuckled “You see, I’m doing laundry, er, at Draco’s house, because, er, I, his stuff is much fancier than mine”
“So, just talk to him”
Harry could hear Ron shouted over the music to Pansy, but he ignored it once the guy before him pushed Harry’s legs open and placed his hands on Harry’s shoulder again. He pressed his body close to Harry’s face, raising one of his legs and gently sliding them down Harry’s crotch, making the Auror grunted low. Harry looked up at the guy as he continued to brush his leg over Harry’s crotch, he tried to hold himself back, he couldn’t touch the guy, as much as he wanted to. His knees were shaking, and he was pretty sure he was sweating already, maybe because it was summer, maybe because it was from the heat of getting a lap dance from this guy, he couldn’t think clearly.
“I know, so when Hermione told me that Pansy’s her girlfriend, I was shocked, for sure. But then I got to know her, she was…cool”
“Stop saying that” Draco glared at them “There’s a kid here”
” He answered quickly, his tone high, he wanted to flee, but the bigger part of him wanted to stay, wanted to feel more of this. This feeling was intoxicating, yet he yearned for more, Draco was starting to panic.
“He will” Theo winked at him and stood up “Gotta find Nev, it’s almost midnight, I’ll try to find Pansy for you” Draco smiled as Theo walked away, fifteen minutes until New Year, and people were finding others to kiss at midnight, but Draco? Nothing, as expected.
“Potter, you are
favourite?” He ogled at the drink in Potter’s hand, he could not believe he’d like this, it was blue like the ocean, with a piece of orange on the side, sugar sprinkled on the rim of the glass, and a cherry inside.
“Good morning, Aurors, you probably know why we’re are all in here, as you can see” Draco pointed to the board in the meeting room. It was just after Christmas and almost New Year, alas crimes never rest, he had to wake at barely four in the morning to check the crime scene. The Auror life hasn’t been easy on him, he was a former Death Eater after all, that was why they wanted him to go and checked the crime scene alone and didn’t bother to ask any other Auror to wake up that early, they were all still discriminating shit bags even after the three years that he’s been working here, Draco sighed and continued “There was a murder, the victim is…” He pointed at the picture of a dead body on the bed, blood all over the crime scene.
! I have been waiting for you” He beamed, wrapping his arms around the guy’s waist
“Er, no, I don’t think so-
“It’s alright, I won’t tell Pansy and everyone else you’re back together with Abbott” He leaned on the wall of the lift, giving up.
“Listen, I will do the talking, all right?” He asked before opening the door inside “You just stand there and be attractive, I guess”
“Has never shown affection towards anyone, I know” Draco said, looking at Blaise, who was still keeping his eyes on Ron. It was weird, he has never seen that kind of look on Blaise before, kind of like…he was craving for it, he wanted Ron bad. And once Blaise got his eyes on something or someone, he’d become determined “He’s just thinking”
“You’re lying”
“Interesting” Draco said, smiling to himself but the smile soon disappeared when he saw two figures rushing towards their way. It was Ron and Harry, they were still in their Quidditch uniforms, but Harry was bleeding from his head. Draco freaked out, his feet moved before he could control it
“I’m going to go” Ron said and stood up, with Blaise quickly followed him without saying a word
. So I didn’t try to push it”
like you, a
Harry murmured when he heard Draco’s flirty sentences, his cock twitching at the image of him ramming into Draco like in his dreams. He cupped the blond’s face, leaning in closer so their lips finally touched. For the first time, he was actually kissing Draco.
Pansy smacked Draco’s arm, acting like she was right “Han agreed with me”
“Wait for it” Pansy said, pushing Draco and Harry forward “
the feelings, it could be days, months, or years, you won’t know it, but it’s building up inside you” Hermione played with Pansy’s wedding ring and smiled “You won’t know when, you won’t know how, or why exactly, and then one moment, you could be on a date with them then, or you two are just reading the news, or when you’re in a battle together,
” The blond turned around to see Goldstein again, who was waving has a huge smile on his face “Want to sit next to me?”
“But I don’t care about them” Harry said, moving closer to Draco “I care about a certain blond, pompous git that sneaked a few glances at me during the shoot, I noticed you, actually, you are the only one I noticed”
“Won’t he need it though?” Hermione asked but quickly waved her hand in objection of her own words “Never mind, he doesn’t need it.
He mumbled, still his neck was tilting to give the Auror more access, he grind himself against Potter, already feeling a bulge from the man’s crotch, his hands slid into Potter’s messy hair, gripping on it, he tried to catch his breath but it was all so exciting that he couldn’t stop.
“Why…did you do all those things?” Draco asked, he hoped, just a little part in him hoped that Potter would say something…something that’d make him swoon, maybe Potter has something for him, if only…
“Oh” He said, letting out a small laugh as well “I didn’t know”
, look like the fire of their love isn’t out yet” Pansy made a point and tilted her head to the side “Am I right?”
!” Neville said “No, I-there’s nothing between me and Hannah, nothing, she just…”
Harry blurted out when the guy swayed around and began swirling his hips around. He even bent over so low, Harry could see his round arse and his lace knickers, tempting the Auror even more. Even the pair of arse, it seemed
thing he could use against the creep.
“I just, uh, I just thought I could sit with you for a while” Potter said and Draco let out a quiet “
, he even missed the way his eyes locked with Draco’s “I, er, I want to say I’m sorry first, for, you know, locking Brandon in the loo, and, er, for avoiding you when you were with him”
” Pansy gasped “What’s that?”
!” Draco cried out when Harry began thrusting at the new spot he found “
“No, I’m fine, don’t worry, my world is still here” She chuckled and the three of the Gryffindors sat down with them “Hey, darling?”
“Oh sod off, Potter” Draco hugged the files to his chest defensively and asked “What just happened?”
“I thought we agreed on calling each other by our first names yesterday” Potter pouted with his hands behind his back. It was dark outside but he could still see Potter’s face clearly. He was wearing his scarf again, a new one because Draco had kept his. He even has a red knitted hat over his head. He looked like a dork, but Draco found him kind of cute, he fought the urge to blush at the sight of him.
“Yeah, next time” Draco said, and Harry hanged up the phone, knowing
turning our phones off again”
cause Draco to stay in bed the next day because he couldn’t move his arse anywhere at all. One time it was a skirt, one time it was a pair of heels, and one time she even had the bloody sex swing delivered at their house, which she claimed was useful and would improve their sex life. Draco believed she just did this to tease him because without her
, it’s even funny for us” She said, playing with the champagne bottle while Draco listened to them “We even paved the way for him, like when all of us were sitting in that small booth and
” Draco mumbled quietly, there was something about Harry that Draco couldn’t quite figure out, he was…curious about Harry
“Er, Cormac likes Malfoy?”
“What are you doing?” Draco asked. Was Potter taking a break too?
“Pansy says we need to be on the second floor at 9am sharp” Theo held up the note Pansy gave him and showed it to Draco
“Oh you have to be kidding me” Draco groaned just from hearing the name of the certain arsehole that has been after him like crazy ever since he became an Auror “You can’t make me choose”
“Aren’t you supposed to be working?” Draco furrowed his eyebrows and stared at her
“I will catch you this time” Harry mumbled, pressing his lips on Draco’s neck “I will”
“I don’t ask people out” Blaise said coldly, it was true, but Draco thought Weasley might just be his exception “We have graduated, I will never see him again”
Draco sat on the edge of the bed in his bathrobe and rubbed his sore feet, with all the walking they did today, and even with Potter carrying him, Draco’s feet still hurt like a fucking bitch, and it even swelled a bit, the blond groaned and rested his chin on his knee, maybe if he sleep, it would feel better tomorrow.
“Harry, her coat” He grunted and Harry grabbed the coat next to them and handed it to her
’, so he had asked Pansy to find out who he was, since she knew everyone in school, and surprisingly…it could actually be Harry
” Pansy rolled her eyes annoyingly with her arms folded, Hermione tilted the phone to her side and continued
“My darling, my queen, my love, my world” Pansy smiled “I have never been so proud of you”
“Have a wild guess” Draco bit his lower lips and slowly got down on his knees, watching Harry’s eyes widened as each second passed by. He started at Harry’s ankles, and trailed his hands up the man’s thighs as he faced the unbelievably huge and hard cock in front of him. Draco took a deep breath and kept his hands on Harry’s thighs as he leaned closer, licking a stripe up the length

“I can talk to them if you want to”
He said threateningly when Smith grabbed his wrist, stopping his movement right on the git’s chest “Let go of my hand”
“He’s an Auror” Draco revealed softly, Harry’s breath hitched,
“Bonus my arse”
“Sod off” Potter snickered and leaned back on their booth “Do you recall the night Pansy confessed to Hermione?”
Draco cried out and just stopped making sense at all when Harry thrust in faster, hitting the spot Draco had mentioned about, driving the blond mad and yearning for more, based on the way Draco was creating his own marks on Harry’s back right now. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s hips while the Auror embraced the blond in his arms, it seemed like their bodies fitted perfectly and was working in sync. Draco arched his back and let out a loud sob before his body shuddered and the next thing Harry felt was fluid hitting his stomach, the blond’s entrance tensing and tightening up, unleashing all of the will power Harry was holding as the Auror kissed his
“Personally? I don’t think so” Granger shook her head, he knew she’d always be the logical one here “Why do you ask?”
much about you”
” Pansy shrieked when the doorbell rang loudly “Draco’s here, everyone in position, Blaise, Ron get back in the kitchen! Everyone else, settle down! Gin, come on, dinner hasn’t even started yet”
She stopped when Draco held her back “I remembered that there were a lot of articles about Potter, and some others. But mostly were about the famous stories, and how we’re all wondering where he was”
He finally opened his eyes to see Draco still in his clothes before with the red stain on his shirt from the wine, the blond smiled at him and wiped the corner of his lips “I came home and I saw you sleeping. Are you alright?”
” Draco laughed and nudged her “Gross”
“I don’t thin—…”
said it wouldn’t work”
“Do you, do you happen to know what’s the deal between Abbott and Neville?” Draco asked, Theo had come in today with an upset look on his face, he wasn’t as chirpy as always, now he just looked…heartbroken “Are they back together?”
“He is serious” Pansy nodded and gripped on Blaise’s arm “I noticed the way he looked at Ron today, the gentle eyes, weirdly sappy for me”
“Yeah” Potter said, already digging into the food on his plate
“Draco, I just want to talk”
“Question, how was your first time?” Pansy asked, turning on the kitchen stove to make some tea. After
“We could never, she’s too sly” Draco chuckled and then Potter put him down on the bed softly, Draco moved to the other side of the bed so Harry could get in with him, the Auror draped the blanket over themselves and kissed Draco one more time
“That’s what you focused on?” Potter laughed “Draco…”
“Agreed” Blaise took Draco’s side as well, they have all known Theodore long enough to know how he’d act “Focus on one thing”
!” Draco widened his eyes when he saw Harry running from afar, he was already in the lift, wanting to get back home as soon as possible. Draco panicked and pressed on the button furiously so the lift would close, he wanted to avoid Harry so bad. And just as Harry almost reached him, the door closed and Draco breathed out in relief. The lift finally opened and he stepped out slowly, searching if Harry was there too
longer than planned
“Us, as in Hermione and I” Pansy grinned “So, I should tell you, it was just a plan”
(See the end of the chapter for

“Er, your juice” Harry said, pointing at him and Draco looked down, he jolted and stopped when he realised the juice was overflowing out of the cup to the kitchen counter
“Have a good time, guys, no one will come in” Pansy turned around and gave them a wink “
“What’s wrong?” Potter asked, and even Weasley and Granger were looking at him with curious eyes
“Well, I will go now, Ron and I just finished investigating and I thought I could drop by to ask you”
“Well, you told me you will tell them the news today, and I’m afraid your father would be angry, so I thought I could come and help you” Harry said, smiling at Draco with the same smile that got him melted into a puddle every time “They could take out their anger on me instead of you, I think I’ll be all right”
” Pansy cackled loudly and Draco kicked her leg lightly, making her yelp

“Let me guess, you and your
” He said, staring into Ron’s nervous eyes “Now get out and be fabulous” He pushed Ron away and he stumbled to Pansy’s spot
“What?”
” Draco ruffled Potter’s messy hair, as if he was a dog. After a while, Potter just stared at him and Draco had to retreat his hand to cover his blush instead, he faked a cough and got back to watching Hermione and Pansy
“Yeah, and I believed you. I think you and I, whether we’re in a universe where we’re best friends since we were kids, or we’re arch rivals, or we’re Muggles even, I know we’d still be together, I love you, Draco, I always have, and I know the other me loves you too”

subtle “Hermione found out first, then Pansy, then surprisingly, Theo, the last one to find out is Ron, but he somehow became the biggest supporter, he kept wanting me to confess to you”
Meeting the parents went better than expected, but is that it? 👀
“Really?”
“What?”
” She shrieked and opened the door for them to walk inside, the room was huge and…blank, there was only two tables inside, and a few chairs, and all the walls were white “Come here!”
loveable, but it annoyed Draco, because he knew this Potter here wasn’t like the one he knew. If he fell for him any harder, he wouldn’t be able to bear his own feelings when he got back, that was why he wanted to refrain from doing things that made him swooned by Potter.
“What did you get?” He asked, ignoring what the redhead just said
“How can I? Harry’s your boyfriend, you don’t remember that? Are you seeing things you’re not supposed to see?” Pansy pulled him down by his shirt and placed her hand on his forehead “You don’t seem to experience fever right now”
“If we take a bath now and do it the second time, would you have enough data to compare to your first time?”
“Hey, er…” Ginny started, looking at him strangely “I got the broom, I like it a lot, so, thank you, for doing that”
happened last night?”
” Draco urged her, pushing her away as she let out a loud laugh, leaving the courtyard quickly while Potter approached him. His lips formed into a frown, folding his arms together “You’re late, Potter”
“Always the pompous git, Malfoy” Harry said, walking away. What he didn’t notice was that their reflections were still in the mirror, their hands now intertwined once again. Draco sniffled softly, realising there was a drop of tear running down his cheek, he wiped it with his hand and composed himself only to see Harry staring at him with furrowed eyebrows from the door
