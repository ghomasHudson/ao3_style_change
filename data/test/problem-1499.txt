"I don't really care if you believe me," Draco said without malice. "He made a mistake and put his queen in a vulnerable position. I could have taken her but chose not to. He knew what he'd done too; I could see it in his face. He practically cheered when I seemed to miss the opportunity."
That seemed to get their attention. With Draco and Johnny's guidance, the kids formed a single file line. They moved up the line and received their presents from Santa. Each one got a gift and a hug and was then guided to the side to open his or her gift. The room was filled with gasps and squeals as presents were opened. Even the teenagers seemed pleased by their gifts.
"Pensieve, Potter," Malfoy responded, rolling his eyes. He reached over and tugged Harry back down into the chair. "Let's focus on the important details shall we?"
to travel, Eva. If I went to them with this they’d likely throw me in Azkaban. And you may very well go into St. Mungo’s. They’d think I imperio’d you to do my bidding and I was after some relic to conduct some sort of Dark Magic. Absolutely not, Eva. I cannot possibly do it. I won’t.”
Malfoy chuckled and led Harry to a room he’d not entered before. It was a small receiving room with elegant looking furniture. Harry resisted throwing himself down as he wanted, not trusting the delicate pieces to withstand the force. He could feel Malfoy’s gaze on him as he lowered himself, and almost jumped when a house elf appeared beside the coffee table. “Please retrieve some tea from the kitchen and the Hadley Blend from the library.” With a pop the house elf disappeared again. “Now, want to tell me what has you looking like you’ve seen a Grim?”
“Oh,” Potter responded. “I suppose so.” He stretched and Draco winced as he heard bones pop. “Still, not my most comfortable sleep.”
“Do not be foolish Draco,” answered his father. “We would be unwelcome at such an event. You are young and easily forgiven. Besides, Eva is a charming woman who will be an asset at this event, despite her…disadvantages.”
“Don’t ever get married, Malfoy,” Weasley snorted. That earned an elbow jab from his wife. “It’s just a joke,” he grumbled.
Harry stared. "Did you just use a muggle phrase?" His response was a door in his face. He chuckled to himself. Malfoy was turning out to be quite a surprise.
He saw Eva smile out of the corner of his eye and decided to ignore her. Instead he turned to the hand still on his arm. It pulled away as if burned. He heard Eva sigh.
He backed Draco out of the spray of the water as he continued his ministrations. Once Draco's back hit the wall Harry moved down until Draco's cock was at eye level. He licked his lips and looked up. Draco's eyes were half lidded and his lips were red and swollen. Pride surged through Harry.
She had all but given up hope when a sound from her phone startled her. She grinned when she realized her brother had responded.
Suddenly George’s wife cleared her throat from across the table. She smiled. “They’ve started the orchestra. I believe it’s time to dance.”
“Why would Potter purposefully seat me next to him?” But any reply Eva might have had was cut off by the sudden sound of a rather polite voice.
"Yes dear," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "It's a very subtle art, and quite frankly I'm surprised you've picked up on it."
Draco studied his fingernails. “I was under the impression you were dating the she-Weasley?” That particular nickname earned him a jab in the ribs from his supposed best friend.
Draco let out a breath. It may have been mistaken for a sigh if Malfoys did such things. “They’re different.”
Eva chuckled. “Did you just call me a masochist?” She looked at Draco. “I suppose choosing him as a friend helps your case.”
Draco's eyes flew open as he sensed someone digging through his belongings. He kept extremely silent as he subtly grabbed his wand from where it lay under his pillow and turned quickly, aiming his wand at the criminal's throat. Through the morning fog he recognized irritated brown eyes glaring at him. "Eva?" he hissed, removing his wand. "What the hell are you doing?"
Molly blushed. "Why thank you Hermione! I do try." She turned her gaze to the blond, who was just scooping up the last of his pie. "How about you Draco? Did you enjoy the pie?" She wrung her hands in what Harry had come to know as a nervous gesture.
Draco raised an eyebrow at that little tidbit of information, but otherwise made no further comment. That decision certainly had nothing to do with the steely gaze coming from his right. Eva may not have been a witch, but she could still be menacing; though one would be hard-pressed to get Draco to admit it aloud.
Draco’s face went ashen and he jumped from the couch and stared at his friend in panic. “Eva!” he exclaimed. “You cannot bring people back from the dead. Even if it was somehow possible—which it’s not—it would create all kinds of irreversible problems!”
Draco chuckled and informed the youngest that he could choose the story. The toddler ran to the bookshelf and selected "Olive the Other Reindeer". Draco settled on the floor so the children could gather around him. The teens in the home stood disinterested against the wall, but Draco knew they enjoyed this time as much as the younger ones.
Draco blinked at the continued use of his first name. It was starting to get weird. He would soon be forced to use first names or risk seeming childish.
Instead of going off on his “rescuer” Draco decided to instead focus on the fact that his arm was still held captive. “Potter,” he said as the Weasleys regained their balance, “while I appreciate your sudden insightfulness, you can let go now.”
Harry had tried to begin the memory just after the initial discovery, but the scene was still pretty gory. He noticed Malfoy falter beside him. His face was absolutely ashen, and his voice seemed to be stuck in his throat. Harry reached for his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. Malfoy turned to him and swallowed thickly. “I think I might be sick.”
Draco was not convinced that this was a good idea. He had a long list of things that could possibly go wrong. He hadn’t voiced those concerns to Eva, knowing she would accuse him of being overdramatic. Despite the common accusation, Draco had some very legitimate fears about this plan. Yet there he stood in Auror Potter’s office, asking him to play chaperon to their Indian vacation.
She grinned. “Sure thing!” She turned to the red-headed woman. “What kind of dress are you looking for?”
The floo area was surprisingly calm in comparison. Behind them families reunited and friends greeted one another. The line in front of the fireplaces was short. Eva let out a relieved sigh. “I say we get to the inn and not leave it until tomorrow.”
Eva frowned. “What’s wrong?” she asked, looking around the room. “And where’s Harry?” Her eyes widened as she forced Draco to sit up. “You didn’t kill him did you?”
A spasm went through Draco’s hand as his friend clenched it beneath her own. He was glad that their luggage was shrunken and securely in his pockets. The train station was a blur of activity as passengers escaped the confines of the train. He felt a brief touch on his shoulder and turned to find overwhelmed green eyes seeking his attention. Harry nodded his head in the direction of the floos and Draco nodded. No words were used as they would have been lost in the jumbled noise of the platform. Draco tugged Eva toward the floos and cautiously wove them through the crowd. He kept his free hand over the pocket containing their luggage remembering Eva’s warning about pickpockets.
Draco watched the woman and felt a strange urge to be nice. “I believe I saw a collection of books in the lobby. Mr. Gutma may have something about the history and culture of this region.”
“Just can’t help but give orders, can you Potter?” Draco sneered. He noticed that his first name had been used but decided to ignore it. He would not encourage this new fascination with seeming chummy that seemed to be plaguing two-thirds of the Golden Trio.
revealed that it was nearly time to close the store, and Draco almost sighed in relief. “Why don’t you just buy a watch?” he asked his friend.
Harry shrugged. “It’s not always that bad,” he said. He watched as Malfoy took another swig from the bottle. “It was hard in the beginning. A lot of sleepless nights. You learn to cope.” Malfoy stared at the bottle, no indication that he’d heard him. “Malfoy?” No response. He bit down a bubble of panic and walked over to the blond. “Draco.” The blond started and turned to him. “Come here.” Harry reached out a hand and pulled Malfoy to him. He gave a weak protest but Harry enveloped him in a hug. After a tense moment, Malfoy shuddered and collapsed into the embrace.
Their success left Draco with a bad taste in his mouth, making it difficult to continue the charade of friendliness. But Eva’s hand on his knee reminded him that despite the unfortunate twist his life had taken, he had found a wonderful friend. A year ago he would have traded it all in a blink of an eye. Now he understood that somehow, this was a better life for him. It didn’t stop him from hoping he never had to see the horde of Weasleys ever again.
“It’s a miracle!” she exclaimed sarcastically. Draco dropped his hand as if burnt and turned away. He gave Eva a thankful glance, which she returned with a grin. With a steadying breath he tried to shake off how close he’d been to kissing the dark-haired man.
Eva returned to the counter with a frown, successfully interrupting Draco’s brooding. “If one more person tries to get in here with a camera, I will personally hex them into next year!”
This time Draco did allow his sigh to escape. Oh well, Ghosts of Malfoys past. "Right now you're here on Ministry business. But socially? You can't be seen with me, and you certainly can't be seen with me like that." He couldn't help the bitterness that colored his words.
He knew that she was referring to what she called her “gaydar”. It was a reference to one of those muggle movie-things, but Draco wasn’t quite sure what it meant. He did know that Eva seemed to have an accurate assessment of men’s sexual orientations, and she had never been wrong. Well, once. But that’s because the man turned out to really be a woman. He chuckled at the memory.
Draco glared at his friend. “For the love of Merlin! Will you stop calling me all these horrid nicknames?”
One figure was a young man with dark, unruly hair and a very prominent scar on his forehead. Large green eyes blinked in confusion behind large black glasses.
After a rousing rendition of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"--lead by Delilah--the room was silenced by a hearty "ho ho ho!"
Slight fear crept though Draco’s morning fog as he wondered what damning words the periodical contained. With stilling breath he unfolded the paper. It was thicker than usual, which was explained by the animated headline of “Muggle Awareness Ball: Special Edition”. Draco glanced at the front page, relieved to see that an article about Arthur Weasley took up much of the coveted section. He spotted his name in the bottom corner of the paper. The line simply stated that he was in attendance before directing him to the third page. He let out a breath of relief; at least he hadn’t made front page news.
"It's assumed impossible because no one has done it yet, not for lack of trying. These days only the unspeakables actively experiment with it."
Draco looked up from securing his boots and eyed his lover. "Ridiculous," he responded with a smirk. The other man was wearing a bright red coat with white trim that matched his red pants. He had clearly stuffed a pillow down the front of the coat and secured it with a black belt. His black boots looked a bit too large. He had a fake beard around his face and hid his black hair under a Santa hat.
Eva ended up saving Draco’s sensibilities as she skillfully engaged her companions in conversation. He could see even the Weasel and Potter visibly relax under Eva’s social graces. She had interested everyone in tales from their store, and traded the woes and joys of customer service with the Weasel and his older brother. He inwardly cringed when Eva included him in her stories, but knew that Granger must have told her friends that he worked at a muggle clothing store. It was only a matter of time before someone grew brave enough to ask about it.
With a sigh Eva reached under the couch and pulled out a notebook. The edges of the pages were worn; a sure sign the notebook had been heavily used. It was opened to a page that had scribbles, diagrams, and foreign letters strewn across it. She looked directly into Draco’s curios eyes. “Have you ever heard of the Enchanted Stone?”
“Not that I want to interrupt such a wonderful show,” Eva said, “but Ron’s looking for you Harry. Apparently he has something
Harry chuckled. "I guess that's a matter of opinion." He quickly sobered. "The point, Draco, is that I kissed you because I wanted to; I don't really care what anyone has to say about it."
Though interested in this new topic, Ariana sensed she may be losing readers. She quickly took control of the situation. "Well, anyway, that's not the reason I brought you here. I wanted to know who in the fan-world has it right, and who is way off. So, we're going to play a little game I like to call 'What's Up with That'."
Harry coughed around the choked sob trying to escape. “That’s not the point…” His voice cracked and he stopped. He knew Ron was worried. He’d noticed the heavy bags under his eyes just hours ago. He hadn’t slept since Malfoy had been taken. He’d barely eaten. He started as Ron’s heavy hand landed on his shoulder.
Somewhere in the background a clock ticked in the sudden silence filling the apartment. Though it lasted only a few seconds, it seemed to stretch forever. Draco studied his friend carefully. “The Enchanted Stone?” he asked. He tried to remember all the stories he’d heard of magical artifacts; though there were many magical stones, he could not recall one that went by such a name.
“Shit!” he heard before suddenly Eva was there too. “Heat stroke. Help me get him against that wall in the shade.” Together they half carried him over to one of the fort’s walls. Eva muttered something and leaned him against his new support before running off.
Draco bristled at the bad joke. “I’m hardly a child, Potter,” he said disdainfully, crossing his arms. He could feel Eva’s glare, but that just further aggravated him. She had no right to be this grumpy. This entire journey was her fault.
With a not-sigh he uncrossed his arms and turned to his luggage. He dug through his toiletry case and pulled out a bottle of liquid liner. Tossing the bottle to Eva—who caught it with practiced ease—he faced Harry. “Yes, I do.”
can’t go to India.” He began pacing. “First of all, your magical sanctuary is restricted to Britain. Second of all, how in Merlin’s name are you going to travel there? And as if that wasn’t enough, do you really think the ministry is going to let me go traipsing off to exotic places in search of a magical artifact? I need
“I think someone was putting you on,” Draco said defiantly. That surely had to be it. “I mean, what of the Cloak of Invisibility and the Resurrection Stone?”
“Hermione,” Eva started, with a much too sweet smile in Draco’s direction. A sense of foreboding settled in the blond’s stomach. “How would you like to go to India?”
Harry followed him back to the entrance of the manor while running through everything Malfoy had told him. This investigation was going from bad to worse, though at least now they had some kind of lead. He nodded to Malfoy as he passed through the door. "Thanks, Malfoy. This has been helpful."
Weasley looked startled. “I didn’t know you knew a charm like that? Why haven’t you used it before?”
They danced for close to twenty minutes before a low chuckle brought Draco back to reality. “Is he your boyfriend?” the man asked with no small amount of amusement.
There was no spark of electricity as their lips touched. There was no flare of magical energy. There was a light feeling of contentment that settled on Harry as Malfoy kissed back. A questing tongue licked at Harry’s lips and he opened his mouth to receive it. This was so much better than the fantasies he had indulged the past few days. Malfoy kissed with such demanding assurance that Harry couldn’t help but comply.
She was still chuckling and poking him in the side when Potter came out of the shower. Eva’s poking became insistent and Draco closed his eyes, not wanting to risk a peek if Potter had indeed come out of the bathroom without a shirt. He stifled a groan as unwanted images crowded his mind again.
Eva grinned. "Remember when I told you that I was corresponding with a wizard about the Enchanted Stone? Well, ta-da!" She waved her hands toward Raj.
"You know that I know that you know. He doesn't know. But he does and doesn't realize you do. You know that he does. So let's just end this fic!"
Potter, seemingly frustrated with their constant arguing, shook his head. “That’s fine. I don’t need gratitude. I just need to get out of this bloody station. I’m going through. If you don’t follow shortly after, Ron has permission to hex you.”
This time Eva was unable to contain her giggles and collapsed onto the mattress. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head. It was just his luck that he was burdened with a sadist as a best friend. He sat up and found Potter watching Eva with a small smile. Ignoring his demands to do otherwise, his heart rate quickened.
Harry shuddered. "As good a man as Severus Snape was, I don't think this would happen. Sirius hated Snape."
Eva skipped over and held Harry’s face between her calms. “Some black kohl would totally make your eyes stand out even more.”
Raj spent several minutes pointing out various titles and selecting a few books for the witch. He helped her carry the selections to a nearby desk. Eva watched beside Draco, amused. "It's like salt and pepper," she said. Draco raised an eyebrow. "I mean that they just go together!" Eva explained impatiently. Draco just shook his head. He still didn't get the metaphor.
Harry caught him watching him. "Cold?" he asked. Draco just shrugged. "You could have been Santa, then you would be warm."
Harry shook his head in amazement. "Did you just give Ron a compliment?" he asked incredulously. "If he was here to hear that he'd have a heart attack."
"You seem surprisingly well," Draco said casually—or as casually as he could with the butterflies in his stomach suddenly taking up tap-dancing.
“Oh, are you all together?” an older man asked excitedly. Their entrance seemed to have cut off a conversation between him and Potter.
Draco bristled. “She is not as clumsy as you believe,” he simply said. After the necessary polite comments and requests, he was gladly dismissed from the table. He walked toward his bedroom, mind full of defenses for his best friend. Yes, she was muggle, but she had proven herself to be a worthy friend. Draco could admit that she lacked the social graces with which pureblood wizards were raised, but she made up for it with her own skillful talents. She was fiercely loyal to Draco; and Slytherin or not, he could do nothing but return the favor. It irked him that his parents had yet to see the extraordinary woman Eva was, but he had to remind himself that they silently approved of the relationship—and that was saying a lot.
Harry shifted his attention to Eva, but his eyes kept darting toward the blond. “Er,” he said, shrugging. “I’m not really sure.”
“She did,” Harry admitted. “We danced for a few songs before she decided she wanted another drink.” He shrugged. “I don’t really dance.”
"Quite a bit, actually," Harry said smugly. "Like I know that the only reason Eva didn't let you sit with her is so you would be forced to sit next to me."
“I’m hilarious.” He carefully tucked away the unchosen outfits. “I’m not trying to ‘catch’ anyone,” he said seriously.
"Good luck with that," Harry said with a grin. "By the moans coming from your bed last night, I'd say you're going to have a hard time with that."
"I apologize for the extreme security measures, but many people have attempted to steal my research." He shut the door softly.
The old Draco would never have done well in any field requiring customer service; however, the Draco who’d had his life threatened—on numerous occasions—was just happy to be alive. And if in order to stay alive and comfortable he had to cater to the whims and fancies of picky women and clueless men, then so be it.
A pang hit Harry in the chest and his stomach dropped. He knew the Malfoys had been shunned after the war—deservedly so—but he had never thought of the consequences on an individual level. Did Malfoy no longer have friends? Was Harry his first visitor since the end of the trials? He knew that Lucius and Narcissa had left the country. Was Malfoy completely isolated? He tried to shake the uncomfortable thoughts as he followed Malfoy down a hall. The blond stopped abruptly at a door that had been left ajar.
Draco rubbed the bridge of his nose, his nerves fraying at the ridiculous argument. “I want you to run
When he came to he was lying in the crash room. He sat up and glanced around, trying to locate his glasses. He was incredibly peeved at Ron for drugging him, but he had to admit that he did feel better. He had just recovered his glasses when his supposed best friend came bursting into the room.
"I thought you didn't get hangovers," he replied, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and cautiously replacing his wand.
Draco laughed as he thought about how the invitation might sound to an outsider. He downed his martini and slapped a few galleons on the counter. After a suggestion that the bartender keep the change, he let Eva pull him out of the bar and to the nearest floo location.
Harry shrugged and placed a placating hand on Ron’s shoulder. “You feed us half truths to eliminate yourself as a suspect and keep a pulse on the investigation.”
Suddenly Draco had the sudden urge to see Harry’s eyes and he opened his own. Harry was looking at him in concern. “Harry’s a nice name,” Draco assured him.
The conversation officially died and Draco went back to making sure nothing had shifted in his luggage. An uncomfortable silence descended on the room, and Draco was relieved when it was broken by Eva exiting the bathroom.
Draco watched as Potter shook his head before throwing down a handful of floo powder and calling out his destination. In a flash of green, he was gone.
"Well, I couldn't make it look like I'd given in. Honestly, Harry, do you know nothing about polite society?"
The brunette ignored him. “Draco and I are planning a vacation to India. We came to appeal to Harry’s wanderlust so the Ministry will let Draco go. I’m sure we’d love to have you join us!”
With a sharp tug, Harry forced Malfoy to turn away from the victim. “Breath through it,” he said calmly. “In and out through your nose.” The nice thing about pensieve memories was that you couldn’t smell anything. “Don’t focus on the body. Look at the other details. What can her home tell you about her? What kinds of books are on the shelves? Does she have any hobbies on display?” He could see Malfoy visibly relax. It was nice to know his auror training was good for more than catching bad guys. “Now, look at her photos. Does she look familiar?”
Draco raised an eyebrow. As he quickly fit several puzzle pieces together, it became quite clear that his best friend was holding back information. "What is going on?" he asked, crossing his arms.
Draco pressed himself against Harry and their mouths found one another. Harry's hands roamed over pale skin and he sighed as Draco responded in kind. He grew brave and grabbed Draco's arse, forcing their pricks together. Draco hissed and Harry gasped as they rutted against each other. He pulled away from the kiss and bit Draco's neck. The reaction that caused was wonderful and Harry wanted more.
Eva sorted herself and stepped forward. “Yes, another two will be following. Are you Mr. Gutma?” The man nodded. “I’m Eva Melbourn and this is Draco Malfoy. We spoke with you regarding our visit?”
Draco not-sighed. “Yes, I was invited. No, I did not tell you about it. The invitation was made out to my family.”
Draco finally dared open his eyes to give Eva a warning glare. She looked down at Draco and pressed her lips together, smile firmly in place. It was a sign that she would tease him, but she wouldn’t divulge his secret.
All thoughts of anger and betrayal evaporated as Harry shot off the bed. They’d been trying to use the candle the suspect had left behind to track down his possible whereabouts. Until now their attempts had failed pathetically. If there was any chance that they were about to find Draco, Harry was going to lead the charge.
“There are certain potions that require parts of the body that have been forcibly taken. Seeing as your murderer tends to go after wizards who would seemingly not be missed, I would think he is choosing the easiest method to obtain the required ingredients.”
The woman smirked, but decided there would be plenty of time for innuendos later. "How very astute of you Mr. Malfoy. I made sure you would be wandless when you arrived."
With a gentle pull he led Eva into the large room. The space was lit with floating candles. Round tables circled a dance floor. The linens were crisp and white, with delicate center pieces. Draco had to give credit to whoever had decorated. The placed looked elegant and grand. He turned his appraising look to the man who approached him.
Draco studied the pamphlet and had to admit that the fort did look impressive. Still, he raised an eyebrow at his friend. “We come to Delhi and you want to see some large stones? I’d think you’d want to go shopping?”
“Indeed,” Eva said with a smirk as she followed the brunet to his bed. Draco glared at her, and was sorely disappointed that she was, in fact, immune to it.
"Shut up," she said lightly. "Yes you are." She pulled out a vial of his strongest potion. "Because if you don't, you will have to deal with his complaints and sickness all day." She smirked at his displeased expression. "I'm going to take this across the hall. Harry's still asleep so keep it down." With a wink she turned from his bedside and slipped out the door.
“You are certain they were unable to glean any information from you during the conversations?” Lucius asked.
The hostess smiled. "I'm so glad you asked. My name is Ariana, the author of the fanfic that you are currently in."
Draco groaned, but the comment let Harry relax enough to chuckle. As the Weasleys looked at the trio in confusion, the blond was hit with the realization that they now shared an inside joke. His heart gave an unnecessary flutter at the thought, and he was grateful to be distracted by Eva ushering them out of the inn.
With every intention of making Draco come undone, he took more of the hard length into his mouth. He swallowed around it and felt Draco shudder. Once his throat was relaxed he set a steady rhythm. Soon Draco proved that even he could lose control and he began writhing under the attention. Harry would have smiled if he could. He decided to push his luck and let his hand find Draco's entrance. He slowly ran his finger around the hole, massaging it before letting the tip of his finger probe inside.
Malfoy nodded. "You know at least that alchemy attempts to uncover certain mysteries of the universe?"
“Fantastic,” Eva responded, dumping her clothes next to her bed. “I’ll go ask Mr. Gutma for a recommendation.” Without a response she skipped out the door.
As he drew near, he tried to keep the flames between them. He was hoping the shadows cast would hide some of his features. He wasn’t wearing his auror robes and had made sure his hair was covering his scar. He’d used just enough of a charm to dull his features, but not enough to survive a second glance. He wouldn’t be noticed by a casual onlooker, but his tactics wouldn’t hold up to deliberate inspection.
She brushed away sleep curled locks from where they fell into her eyes. "Getting some hangover potion, prat. What do you think?"
Raj smiled and turned to the woman. "Eva, Draco." His smile seemed to widen just a bit when he saw Harry. "Harry, good to see you again."
"I've just been out-Slytherin-ed," he squeaked, "by Harry Potter!" He collapsed onto his bed, ignoring the wrinkles he was likely causing in his clothes, and groaned. Eva simply cackled.
Eva sighed. “Ron and Hermione are sharing a room—for obvious reasons.” They both had the decency to blush. “You and I will be sharing a room with Harry.”
Draco shook his head at his friend’s antics. “Not everyone has your inability to stay still for any prolonged period of time.” He leaned against the wall and studied his nails, effectively displaying that he was unconcerned about this conversation. Every good Slytherin knew how to lie.
“This is why you could never be a Slytherin,” Draco noted sagely. The remnants of his heat stroke clouded his thoughts and allowed him to be bolder than usual. He used the sudden courage to lean a little more heavily into Potter. If the other man had seen him in a rather embarrassing position, Draco might as well use it to his advantage.
“I resist you just fine,” she mumbled as she checked the bottle of liner. She stiffened as she realized what she’d just said and turned to Draco with wide eyes. The blond’s shoulders tensed and he glared at Eva. He could have played that off as a joke if she hadn’t shown how mortified she was at letting it slip.
"Hmmm," Harry hummed. "Maybe. But he's not nearly as hard-headed as he used to be. He's had to learn that not everything is black and white, though he wishes it was."
Johnny stepped in and attempted to get the children under control. After a few minutes with little success, Draco finally stepped in. "All right guys," he said, standing. "Let Santa breath. If you smother him he won't be able to give you your Christmas presents."
Draco shrugged his shoulders. "Whatever. But before we go any further we must acknowledge that J.K. Rowling did, in fact,
That was the question Draco had been hoping would not come up. He had not bothered to RSVP, convinced that no one would lose sleep over it. The invitation had been sent for proprietary purposes. All wealthy Wizarding families would have been invited, in hopes that they would fund Muggle Awareness Measures. Now Granger had to bring it up out of some sadistic need to make idle conversation.
"Eva," Raj said, finally disengaging himself from Granger. "I know a section that carries some of the information you were asking me about India last night."
Now Draco truly studied his friend. He had often wondered what it must be like for Eva. She was surrounded by magic every day, knowing that she would never be able to yield it. He could certainly understand the desire. He even supported it, if it was actually possible. He was
"How did you get here, anyway?" Harry asked. "This place is supposed to be heavily warded." He tried to get an awareness of the house's wards, but nothing seemed amiss.
Eva was back at the register to ring up the Weasleys’ purchases. “You’re going to be the belle of the ball!” she assured the elder Weasley, who blushed.
He picked up a book from his desk and thumbed through the pages. "The stone is a very valuable artifact, despite its ill reputation. I understand that though the last owner died, he was greedy even in his death. The stone is likely to be heavily guarded—by what, I am unsure."
He studied Eva and Draco could see the wheels turning in that thick head. Potter opened his mouth, but his reply was cut off by the sound of clicking heels approaching the doorway. “Harry, I need a word with you.”
“Sure,” Harry answered warily. He walked toward his bed, passing Draco. “All right there, Draco? You seem a little flushed.”
Harry straddled him and began tickling his sides. Despite his best efforts, Draco could not defend against his weak spots. He collapsed into giggles, Harry's weight keeping him from wiggling free. He could feel the snow sneaking under his jacket.
This caused Draco to pale even more. He would not let it get out that he found Harry’s eyes incomparable. He was not a romantic sop, and certainly not when it came to the wizarding hero.
Eva sighed. "Harry, I don't think Draco and I can get into much trouble in a library. I'd hoped you'd know by now that we're not really plotting against the Ministry." Harry actually looked offended and even Draco was a bit surprised by the harshness of the statement.
With a slight shake of his head, Draco surreptitiously waved his wand at Eva. He waited for her to feel the effects of the spell. After a moment she turned to him. “What’d you just do?” she asked.
“Catch him?” Draco repeated incredulously. “Have you always been this daft, or is it a recent development?”
Harry snapped his head around to face the blond, the first time either of them had looked from the back of the seats in front of them. "Of course you do!" he exclaimed quietly. "And if you tell me that it honestly was a mistake and you really have hated me all these years, then fine. We'll finish up this 'vacation' and you'll never have to see me again. But I don't think that's what's going on," he said confidently. "Don't you ever want to do something because it's what you want—not your father, not the Ministry, not the press, but you?"
Or he could try moving. He pulled out slowly and pushed back in, try to start a steady rhythm. Draco would have none of it. He began pushing back against him before Harry even had a chance to set a pace. With a growl he gave as good back and soon the sound of slapping skin joined that of the shower beating down. A few times Harry lost his footing in the water, but he quickly recovered and he was far too busy to be embarrassed. Draco made the most delightful sounds when he pushed just
The look on Eva’s face forced a laugh from Draco. She grinned as he collapsed into himself, letting his laughter ease his tension from the day. It wasn’t often that he indulged in such displays, and that allowed his laughter to quickly spin out of control. He was still clutching his sides when Potter reentered the room.
” was not appropriate, but Weasley visibly relaxed at the jibe so Draco let it go as one of those rare moments that Eva was actually
“Because he calls you Draco. Because you’ve already let it slip. Because it would throw him for a loop,” she ticked off. “Because you like him and you’re not gonna catch him by attempting to keep distance with names.”
The woman smirked as she pulled the pen out of her ponytail. "An author never gives away all her secrets." With a wink and a pop, she was gone.
Potter had obviously heard of that muggle disease as he let out a chuckle. “Yeah, he’s always been a bit prissy.”
Raj sighed. "As I told you before, I have every reason to believe the stone is still in India. However, I do suspect it may be difficult to acquire."
"Draco can be sensitive," Harry said tentatively, feeling he should at least try to defend his boyfriend.
She glared at him, but pushed her cart toward the wall. Draco watched as she gripped her ticket tightly in hand before swiftly walking straight through the wall. As she disappeared, Draco could only hope that Granger was ready to calm his friend on the other side.
Weasley grinned at that prospect. Draco looked down his nose and was about to retort when Eva cut in. “We’ll be right behind you Harry. I’m sure we could all use a shower and meal on non-moving ground.”
Eva turned and beamed at Granger. “No offense taken,” Eva said lightly. “I know all about Draco’s past.” She shrugged. “Not a big deal, really.”
Grey eyes widened and Malfoy lowered himself on the opposite sofa. “I see,” he said thoughtfully. “Do you recognize the victim?”
“Hardly,” Eva responded, rolling her eyes at his theatrics. “I’ve been researching something and sent a letter to a name I came across. He owled me back.” Her eyes glittered.
Beside him Eva shook her head. “Nuh-uh. You’re not getting out of this that easy. I don’t want to hear anything about a headache, or food-sickness, or any other mysterious illness you might come down with.” She took her eyes away from the mingling wizards and turned to her companion. “Actually, you do look a little pale. Are you okay?
"I'll come too," Harry announced. He had a strange look on his face and kept throwing wary glances at Raj.
Draco thanked Mrs. Crowsley after she paid for her jeans and turned to two women approaching the counter. He was momentarily distracted when Mrs. Crowsley told the two women that they had to work with Draco because he was the best and she only bought clothes when he was working. He laughed to hide his embarrassment at the enthusiastic compliment and thanked her again. Finally, he was able to get a good look at the two women and stopped his greeting short.
Eva huffed before spinning on her heel and heading to the train. She left her bags behind in her hurry to find a suitable seat. “And I suppose I’ll just carry these for you, shall I?” Draco called after her. He rolled his eyes before shrinking both their luggage. “I did not sign up to be this woman’s manservant,” he said petulantly.
As they neared the orphanage, Draco was glad the cold weather kept the children inside. Santa was supposed to be a surprise, and the empty yard allowed Harry to sneak around to the kitchen entrance. With a small wave, the men separated, and Draco rang the doorbell to the large building. He heard the lock click and the door opened to reveal a small redhead.
Ariana nodded. "I suspected that would not be true. But to be fair, you aren't exactly at the age that is mentioned in the epilogue."
had caused that reaction. He smirked before taking Draco's head in his mouth. Hands gripped his hair as he swirled his tongue around the tip. He grabbed Draco's thighs and could feel the tension in them as Draco tried not to buck. That wouldn't do at all.
The blond's eyebrows shot up and he hazarded a glance at his neighbor. "How very astute of you," he said, not bothering to hide the surprise in his words.
The older man frowned. "I have a different opinion on the matter. I do not believe it is worth finding because of the trouble it may bring you."
Ariana grinned because she knew. And she thought that Draco knew she knew. But she was sure Harry didn't know.
“It’s not that,” Harry said earnestly. “It’s just—it was pretty gruesome. I wouldn’t recommend the experience.”
In the end, Eva’s plan worked out perfectly. The Weasel was ecstatic to go on vacation to India, though he wasn’t overly enthused about the company. It had been ridiculously easy to get the Ministry to agree, though Draco wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. Once Potter vouched for Draco and Eva and promised to watch their every step, the Minister himself had distributed visas to them. The ministry in India was given advance notice of their arrival. After a signed declaration from Draco that he would behave himself, they’d been released to go pack for their journey.
"Out of character. I mean, I'm not claiming to be a terrific writer, and sometimes the ways I portray my characters are a little different from canon, but I would never turn Draco into some kind of sensitive marshmallow!"
Draco sighed, his exhaustion causing him to momentarily forget that Malfoys were above such things. “I cast a Notice-Me-Not spell. You’re gawking is going to draw attention that we don’t need. Now get through the wall so we can get going. We’re going to miss the train.”
“At least you got to stretch out.” At Potter’s confused look he continued. “You know, having two seats to yourself.”
That admission shocked Draco to the core. He studied his companion, who fidgeted with his glass. Deciding he could always blame the alcohol later, Draco drained the rest of Eva’s Tequila Sunrise and grabbed Harry’s wrist. He placed his glass on the counter, and reached to do the same with Harry’s.
“Well then…” Granger started awkwardly. “We will see you there.” He nodded. She turned to his coworker. “Eva, it was a pleasure meeting you. Thanks for all your help.”
Ariana sat in front of her laptop in a state of shock. Her mouth went dry as she tried to keep down her dinner. She wanted to cry, scream, or kill a bunny. Shaking herself out of her stupor she turned and hit her head against her wardrobe, repeatedly.
Johnny emerged from the doorway with a sheepish smile. "I figured I'd let her open the door since I was standing right here." Johnny was a teen from a local high school who also volunteered during his free time. "Come on Delilah, let's get back inside. It's too cold out here."
“Or maybe you know the motive because you’re the criminal!” accused Ron, though Harry could hardly blame him.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. With a moment of hesitation, he plopped down right on Harry's lap.
Draco held his breath as grey met green. He tried to decipher the emotions playing across Harry’s eyes, giving up when the effort made him dizzy. He closed his eyes, trying to place an emotional distance between them, but he could still feel Harry’s breath brushing against his cheek. He took a deep breath, about to speak, when lips descended on his own.
Draco and Potter flinched but Eva just smiled kindly. “Well, I’m certainly glad to have the honor of being your first such guest.”
I am editing as a bring the story over because I found that I didn't really like some of the original writing. I will try to finish the process quickly, but it depends on how much editing each chapter needs. (I'm also bringing over a bunch of Christmas fics as a sort of "Christmas in July" and I don't want to spam the feed, so the next chapter won't be uploaded until all of those are done.)
"There is a reason I study books, Eva," Raj replied. "I have yet to discover anything worth risking my life."
A slight narrowing of the eyes conveyed that Lucius was also thinking of that political move. He shook his head. “I cannot see what personal benefit the Weasleys could have gained from such a move.”
Draco nodded and closed his eyes, attempting to do as he was told. He found that the longer he took to breathe in, the less likely he was to cough. He felt his mind going when a hand found its way on his shoulder. “Don’t fall asleep!” Harry’s voice was urgent, but Draco couldn’t imagine why. Harry. Harry? It was a nice name. “Harry,” he said softly, smiling.
With a sigh Harry pulled out and forced Draco to face him. Hoping to stave off any mood-ruining, pride-saving speeches, he pulled him into another kiss. This one was much gentler, and Harry savored it.
Malfoy shrugged. "And someone who dabbles in alchemy. Someone who is either too new to understand the consequences, too arrogant to think he can be successful, or too desperate to care."
Upon reaching the continent, the group had boarded a train to Paris. After a quick lunch at a sidewalk café, they had headed to the station that would take them from Paris to India. It was here that Eva’s lack of sleep started to show itself. She had gotten into an argument with Draco about the supposed existence of Platform 16 ½. Now she stubbornly refused to follow through with what she had been told to do.
He became aware of his surroundings again when Raj stopped in front of a locked door. The Indian man pulled out a set of keys from his pocket and unlocked it. "These are protected by anti-spell charms," he explained. "No one can unlock the door if they don't have the key." Draco raised his eyebrows, alarmed. What kind of information could Eva possibly want that would be so heavily safe-guarded? And why would Raj show such valuable information to the muggle? Certainly they couldn't have formed such a wide range of trust in the short time they had danced.
The blond nodded. He didn't think he and Raj had discussed anything that would reveal his interests, but he was not about to let Eva go traipsing off with some strange wizard by herself.
Potter sighed. “Let’s just board. We certainly don’t want Eva surrounded by unknown witches and wizards.”
As predicted, Weasley had a minor freak out when he found out where they were going. Granger finally got him to calm down with the assurance that she wouldn’t let anybody take advantage of him. Draco was informed that his declaration of “don’t worry, Weasley, no sensible gay man would go after
Eva sighed. “You are an absolute failure at the non-Latin languages, Draco.” She pushed the pamphlet toward him. “Tughlaqabad. It’s a fort built by the Tughlaq Dynasty. Well, now it’s in ruins, but still rather impressive.”
“Shut it, Malfoy!” the redhead bit out. Draco was saved from responding when Weasley’s eyes widened and he leapt out of bed.
They peered through the doorway. Draco was sitting in the conference room, fingers fiddling with a teacup. "Well," said Ron a bit awkwardly, "I'll leave you to it."
This time Draco did sigh because—dammit—even a Malfoy was allowed to do so in the given situation. “Yes,” he hissed. “And I would appreciate it if you keep that in this room. I’d rather not send my mother to an early grave.”
A pleasant scent washed over Harry as Malfoy leaned in. He stopped the impulse to sniff and tried to pay attention to what Malfoy was saying.
“Potter, Weasley, take a seat please,” Robards said as he waved toward the table. “Mr. Malfoy has brought forward some interesting information pertaining to your case.” He raised an eyebrow. “I presume you all know one another?”
Suddenly Ariana jumped up from the chair and smiled. "Well, I feel tons better! Thanks for letting me vent."
“Well, he certainly seems jealous enough,” the man explained. He used his head to gesture toward the bar. Draco turned to find that Harry was watching them with a frown on his face. The other man flushed when he noticed Draco looking and used his drink as a distraction. Eva was watching the interaction and grinned widely.
“Charm, Draco,” Eva said, reminding them what they were discussing. “Something that will let Harry see for the night without his glasses.”
As Eva climbed out of the car, the driver handed her a calculator. She frowned at it but dug out the required fare. “Shukriyaa,” she muttered and climbed out of the car.
The voice was all too familiar to Draco. Though it had deepened slightly with age, there was no mistaking it. He slowly turned to find himself staring into appraising emerald eyes. “Malfoy,” the other greeted.
Draco shrugged, trying to appear as though he wasn't extremely embarrassed. "Eva has a really annoying habit of usually being right."
The young woman groaned. “For the love of god, Draco! I’m not an idiot. Of course I’ve looked into it. He’s a scholar on magical artifacts that originate in Asia. And yes, he knows I’m a muggle. I had to tell him why I was looking for the stone or he wouldn’t give me any information. And he is highly acclaimed in his work. Several sources verify what a kind man he is.” She blew her bangs from her face. “So calm the fuck the down. Do you want to hear what he said or not?”
Eva shrugged. “It’s as good as we’re gonna get. I won’t know where the stone is until I meet with my source.”
Draco was still politely eating his chocolate mousse pie (which Molly had made as soon as she found out it was Draco's favorite) and studiously ignoring the poor table manners of the Weasley men. Harry liked to tease him about being such a slow eater, but in reality the Slytherin was just polite. The only other person who still had dessert on her plate was Molly, and that's because she was too busy talking. Hermione and Ginny had both polished off their pies, ignoring the stereotype of girls being delicate eaters.
He turned his thoughts back to the case. "You think this is what our guy is after?" Malfoy nodded. "But where do the body parts come in?"
impatient." He pointed to a section of the text that Harry had no hope of interpreting. "This here speaks of a ritual to resurrect the dead."
“Not so much,” the other man said. “You are a very attractive man.” He stopped dancing and held out his hand. “My name is Raj.”
Malfoy glared at the redhead before turning to Harry. “I’m aware of the murders you’ve been investigating. I also know the nature of the murders and that you have yet to determine a motive.”
It was a beautiful day in London; the kind where you could forget a war had taken place nearly five years prior. Though there remained a lot of scars in the hearts of a generation, the rebuilding of the wizarding world had made immense progress. If one feared that the new era of peace would cause amnesia, they needn’t worry. The Ministry of Magic, under the able direction of Kingsley Shacklebolt, ensured that measures were taken so that any attempt of starting another war would be trying indeed.
Eva picked up her name card. “Look, they must have paid attention to the receipt.” In neat script her full name was written on the label. “I have to commend them for such attention to detail.”
Draco seriously wanted to protest that offer, but that would require admitting that he was awake. He knew he would have questions to answer in the morning, as well as complications to deal with, but he thrived on the art of avoidance. Even though his mind complained about the mess he’d gotten himself into, his heart ensured that he had very pleasant dreams.
Harry’s conversation with Ron halted abruptly as he entered the conference room. He ignored Ron’s irritated muttering in favor of staring at the blond sitting at the large table.
"It was the first time I'd been to their home. It would be a disgrace if I'd beaten him in his own home upon my first visit."
She shrugged. “Doesn’t matter really. And I have a feeling. My spidey-senses are tingling.” That statement was finished with a wiggle of her fingers and eyebrows.
If one wanted to know what was said in the opening speeches, they would have to ask someone other than Draco. He was stiff with anxiety, sneaking glances at his table companions. Besides the Golden Trio, the other seats were occupied by Ginny Weasley, George Weasley, and George’s wife. They all listened to the introductions with interest, though the men eventually seemed to tune out. Draco did note when Arthur Weasley was introduced, as you could not miss the pride that blossomed from the table. It was going to be a long evening indeed.
“We really should take one turn around the floor,” he heard the She-Weasley tell Potter. There was a groan but the couple moved to stand up. The other Weasleys did the same, though there was a look of horror on the Weasel’s face. Soon Eva and Draco were the only ones at the table.
Draco waved his hand toward the other man. “Ignore her American-ness. She often throws out useless slang.”
“I do not have ADD!” She stuck her tongue at the blond who just chuckled. He turned it into a cough when he noticed the look on Potter’s face. Eva turned back to the auror. “So, how about it?”
Eva smirked; a look that she had undoubtedly inherited from the blond. “So we convince them to give us a babysitter.”
Eva nodded. “Yeah, that goes without saying. Also, sometimes if the stone was stolen but the person survived the robbery, they died of grief.”
Ariana sighed and stared at Draco meaningfully. Draco raised an eyebrow. Ariana stared harder. Draco smirked. Ariana glared. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco shook his head. “If that’s all there is to it, why isn’t everyone out looking for the Enchanted Stone?”
With great insight as to the purpose of the game, Harry immediately answered. "You read the book, of course they end up together. They're happily married."
Harry suspected Ariana's mind had been messed up long before whatever author she was talking about. "Wait a minute," he said in sudden realization. "Is this about more of those 'stories'?"
“Well, I’m not really asking for your approval,” Eva said testily. “But I would like you to come with me.”
Draco stood up menacingly. "Why on earth would I marry Greengrass's younger sister! And Scorpius! I would never name my son such a horrible name!"
Crumpling to the floor, she resigned herself to being forced into a life void of fanfiction. There was nothing she could do. She would continue to write of course, but how could she ever read another fanfic? Her life would be empty. Damn her curiosity! This time it really had killed the metaphorical cat.
Green eyes glittered behind thick glasses and Draco was reminded of his late headmaster. “Yes! You have that damn twinkle in your eye! I won’t stand for it!”
“I can’t believe you’re not going to take me to this ball! How many times have I told you that I love these kinds of things? I had to miss my prom, if you remember! And you would keep this from me?” She was now in full scene-making mode, and if Draco did not remedy the situation he would be severely embarrassed in front of the Weasleys. That simply would not do.
Draco turned to study his companion, but Harry was looking across the dance floor. “Not a whole lot, once in a while.”
Though not surprised that Eva would want his help, he was not expecting any real travel would be necessary. He thought back to everything they had discussed about the stone. He remembered she mentioned Sanskrit and Tibet. Surely she wasn’t thinking of traveling to South Asia. That
Draco lifted an eyebrow at that betrayal of trust, but met Harry’s glance levelly. “Really?” the other man asked.
He glanced to his right and saw Potter stretched out over two seats he’d managed to secure for himself. Draco envied the room the other man currently had. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the Weasleys cuddled together in the seats behind Potter. He turned back to the scenery to avoid the sickness he would surely feel if he saw anymore visions of the couple’s romantic gestures. He idly wondered if Potter didn’t feel like a bit of a third wheel at times. He gazed at his companion again. On this particular trip Potter may very well be the fifth wheel. Perhaps it would have been better if the She-Weasley had joined their vacation. The thought had Draco immediately nauseated and he finally did jostle his shoulder.
He frowned as he rinsed shampoo from his hair. He could deny his feelings all he wanted, but he knew the truth. He had told himself that he still hated Potter, but he didn’t. Though he was loath to admit it, he had nearly drooled over the few photos of Potter he had seen over the past year. He growled at himself. It was just a stupid school-boy crush and he was far too old for such fantasies. Even if Potter was miraculously interested in Draco, it would be political suicide for the Wizarding Savior to have any kind of relationship with him. The Malfoy patriarch would likely be horrified, but the Malfoys could hardly fall any further to the bottom than they already had.
That statement had Draco heading for the train in a hurry, regardless of his present irritation with the muggle woman. He was not about to let her leave him alone with the trio that lived to hate him. Maybe a small part of him was concerned with her safety. A very small part. He boarded the train and searched the compartment for his friend. He spotted her messy braid and moved toward her seat.
She groaned as the last bang connected with the wardrobe a little too forcefully. She rubbed her head as she frowned. "I really fear for the future of our species." With a shudder she exited out of the story and began searching the contents of her favorite fanfiction site. Another story would certainly get that monstrosity off of her mind. As she scanned each summary and swiftly skipped each link, she began to panic. The damn story had caused some kind of traumatic reaction. She couldn't read another fanfiction for the rest of the night! She growled. Somebody was going to pay!
Draco doubted the honesty in the statement, but inclined his head nonetheless. “Weasley. I am surprised at the level of honor you bestowed upon us with these seats.” There mother, he thought weakly. That was incredibly polite.
Draco smiled and nodded. For a moment he was back in London, where this scene was often played out between the two of them. The blond was confident that he would look good in whatever he chose, but that was probably why it was always so difficult to select an outfit.
Harry cursed and patted at the flames blossoming on his robes. He impatiently doused himself with an
“I’m working on it,” she said, nibbling her bottom lip. “After we meet with him we’ll figure out our next moves.”
Once secured with their beverages, the friends sat across from one another at a table. “I don’t think we’ll have very many opportunities to be alone,” Eva said.
“That’s another thing I’ve been researching,” she said, shaking Draco from his dark thoughts. She began turning the pages in her notebook. Each page was covered in messily scrawled notes. “From what I can gather, the real danger of the stone is greed. The people who search for the stone do it for selfish reasons. They’re never satisfied with what they wish for and always want more. So they make so many wishes and become so obsessed with material wealth that they become insane. They either kill themselves out of madness or they die of starvation because they forget to focus on reality.” She took a moment to scan a paragraph of notes. “The stories are actually very sad. They push everyone away so that by the time they’re in real trouble, no one is there to save them.”
"A conversation if he knows what's good for him," Eva said testily, sending a glare in Draco's direction. Granger chuckled and turned back to her book.
Draco sniffed and collapsed in the chair beside her. He would love to put some distance between them, but the only other open seat was next to Potter, and he was not about to subject himself to
“I certainly don’t blame you,” Draco said carefully, taking time to pick a piece of lint from his shirt. “But I don’t know if it’s a good idea.”
The toilet flushed and Weasley poked his head out of the bathroom. “I think I’m just going to spend the rest of the day in here,” he said weakly, before shutting himself back in the bathroom.
They spent several hours at the old fort, admiring the crumbling structures and the more modern additions. Eva guided them using a brochure detailing the attraction. As the morning shifted into early afternoon, even she had to agree that they needed to retreat from the oppressive heat. By then Draco’s face was flushed and he was beginning to feel a dizziness that had nothing to do with his earlier introduction to vertigo. He was beginning to wish he’d brought some water with him. He vision blurred as he took a step and his ankle rolled. He cried out softly as he felt himself drop, but was caught before he hit the ground.
Draco choked, Harry blushed, and the two women walking past them gave Eva a strange look. She blushed. “I didn’t mean it like
“I’m sure plenty of them died from murder too,” Draco said, frowning in thought. “You know, because someone else wanted the stone.”
“Okay,” Potter said warily. He eyed Draco with some amusement and a lot of shock, but thankfully didn’t comment any further. “I’m going to take a quick shower. I already let Ron and Hermione know about dinner.”
After they left Eva turned back to Draco. “You got off easy, I hope you know. I don’t give a damn about your socio-phobic need to shut yourself away from higher wizarding society. I stayed here because this world amazes me. You are my best friend and it is your duty to ensure my wizarding experience is as rich as possible. Besides,” she said, “you need this. Going to a Muggle Awareness Ball? That’s going to be amazing publicity for your family!”
Three shots later Draco was sufficiently relaxed. Eva had bought the third round while Draco picked up the tab for the fourth. Harry and Granger had wisely bowed out of the third and fourth shots. Draco could feel his nose tingling and suspected he should have followed their example. He looked to his challenger and noticed Weasley grinning with an arm around Granger. “You should go dance,” Eva said.
Potter sent them both a pleading look. “Can we please just board this train before it leaves without us? It’s going to be a long ride so we can all catch up on some much needed sleep.”
Eva rolled her eyes. “Ignore him Harry,” she suggested. “We always have this argument and he has yet to realize he will never win.” She looked at her friend. “What kind of steel taste-buds do you have to have to drink your coffee black?”
Eva ran into Potter as she tumbled out of the floo. Draco shook his head and gracefully stepped out of the floo to help his friend straighten up. “Really, Eva, you’d think you’d be used to this,” he said disdainfully. Eva sneezed in response.
One such measure was to create the Department of Muggle Awareness, headed by Arthur Weasley. The department quickly set to work increasing awareness and understanding of muggles and their culture. The hope was that if wizards understood their non-magical cousins, there would be less inclination to fear or despise them. As part of this initiative, an area was designed off of Diagon Alley to include shops that gave wizards a muggle shopping experience. Cashew Alley featured shops, diners, and even a muggle-style carousel. In the middle of the shopping strip sat Jackie’s Junction.
*A note about Lucius: I am quite aware that Book 7 makes it very clear that Lucius loves his son dearly. However, I doubt that his character is very forthcoming when it comes to direct expressions of love and pride. I think he would find indirect ways to communicate his love for both Draco and Narcissa, and Draco would understand it as he grew up with that kind of communication.
“Of course,” he muttered. He gave Draco an apologetic look before pulling away and turning to Eva. “I’m sure that Ron thinks it’s absolutely urgent,” he said.
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow and really it wasn’t fair that he should look so unaffected by what had just occurred. "We're going to continue researching before you say something incredibly stupid and ruin the moment."
“I’m just remembering the incident with Mr. Man.” He had come up with the nickname for the woman in a brilliant moment of inspiration, and it never failed to fluster his friend. This time was no different as she blushed. It was nice to see
A blank stare met her explanation. “How do you even know that?” Draco asked in surprise. He tried to remember the Dark Lord’s wand. He had gone through several once he knew his own would not work against Potter. Even Lucius’s wand had been taken. It had eventually been returned, but after the Dark Lord’s fall the elder Malfoy had quickly replaced it. Draco tried to picture the last wand the evil wizard had wielded, but could not get the memory to focus. He had been a bit preoccupied at the time.
Granger’s face scrunched in disgust at the sounds coming from the bathroom. “I guess we’ll be staying in today,” she said with a sigh.
frotting on the sofa with Malfoy, they’d reached the conclusion that the best place to catch their murderer was at the Beltane fires. The suspect would need something to fuel his vessel, and Malfoy was insistent that he would go after a sacred source. According to Malfoy, it didn’t get much more sacred than the flames of the communal fire that burned on Beltane.
Potter laughed. “Well, I could use a cup of coffee. And then Eva can tell us where we’re going today.”
Draco snorted. He was quite adept at the shades of grey in life. It's all he ever lived in. "So what now?"
Ariana frowned as she inspected her clothes. "Dammit! I forgot to alter my appearance! This is my damn story; I should get to look however I want!" She sighed. "Well, there's no help for it now. Whatever. I just wish I could get my hand on that damn author! She's got my mind all messed up."
He wasn’t sure what prompted Malfoy’s assurance, but he decided he didn’t want to know. "So, what? We're looking for a suspect who's lost someone? Doesn't exactly narrow down the suspect pool."
His friend snorted. “No, although I can see how you would think that.” She frowned. “The actual name of the stone is the Cintamani. Although most people can’t pronounce that and it has largely become known as the ‘Enchanted Stone’.”
"Now, young Eva," Raj began, "I believe this will meet your needs? No one will be able to overhear our conversation."
"Oh," Harry said, not knowing what else there was to say. Honestly he'd never known there were that many subtleties to chess. "I suppose you don't give that kind of stuff away."
Harry stood against the tree line and observed everything going on around him. The light mist in the air did nothing to dull the cheerful reverie of the celebrants. He really hoped the clouds would produce nothing more than a drizzle. Malfoy was insistent that weather would not deter their would-be alchemist, but Harry would rather stay relatively dry.
Lucius nodded toward the plate, indicating that Draco was now free to enjoy his breakfast. The elder Malfoy took a sip of his tea—Earl Grey with no cream or sugar—before finally addressing the article. “It seems that the report you gave us last night was quite accurate of the evening.” That was the closest Lucius would ever come to saying “I’m proud of you” and Draco would take it. “The article remains neutral, which means you and Eva conducted yourselves appropriately at the ball.” He took another sip of his tea, the Lucius equivalent of clearing his throat. “The author does seem to spend quite a bit of energy speculating the nature of your relationship with Miss Melbourn. I do hope you have not been withholding information on that particular subject.”
It was the morning after the dance when Draco was awoken by a house-elf popping into his room. The elf had waited for Draco to struggle awake before informing him that he was wanted at the breakfast table. The dinette was a small room off of the large kitchen that had floor to ceiling windows looking over the herb garden. It sat catty-corner to the formal dining room, which hadn’t been used in several years. The family took all their meals in the dinette, so Draco was not surprised to see both his parents seated at the table. His mother greeted him with a kiss to the cheek before motioning him to sit down. His father said nothing, simply placing the morning’s Daily Prophet in front of Draco.
Ron sighed. "You went a bit mad when Malfoy disappeared. I'm not blind. I know what's going on." He ran a hand through his hair. "Just go to him."
She snorted. “There will be plenty of time for shopping. And they’re not just stones Dray; it’s history. If I just want to study impressive stones I can go to Stonehenge. Now drink your coffee so we can get going.”
Eva glared. “All right. General direction, if you will.”  She took a sip of her tea. “We’ll be staying a few days in New Delhi. We need to do typical touristy stuff.”
Draco snorted, having finally recovered from his attack. “Yes, Eva. Because I would risk going to prison just to protect you from evil, muggle drivers.”
Malfoy grimaced. "The vessel." Harry gave him a questioning look. "He's building a vessel out of the parts he takes from the victims."
Draco's face became ashen and his stomach dropped. He stared, speechless, as Eva emerged from the bathroom and Harry sauntered in. He remained motionless as Eva dumped her clothes on the floor and began digging through her bag. She finally noticed his silence and glanced up. "What's wrong with you?" she asked.
Malfoy took a breath and turned back around, taking care not to look at the ground. He ignored the memory Harry and the other responders. He walked over to the bookshelf and looked at the framed photos. “I don’t recognize her,” he said shaking his head. “There’s something about her though.”
Potter let a snort escape and Mr. Gutma’s shoulders shook in unmistakable laughter. The man composed himself before turning toward the group. “Here you go! The two are on the left and the three on the right! Do enjoy your stay and let me know if you need anything!”
“I need you to stay still and Merlin knows you’re notorious for fidgeting. Now shut up so I can do this correctly.” He placed his mind in a purely clinical zone, something he’d learned to do since childhood. It allowed him to shut off all other parts of his mind so he could concentrate on the task at hand. It was how he’d achieved so much in school, even when times were such that he should have been distracted. He muttered the charm with an intricate wand movement and watched Harry’s eyes for the reaction.
Draco nodded. “Let me take you to our formal wear.” On his way he passed a coworker. “Hey, Eva, can you help me out here?” He was confident he would be able to find a perfectly good dress for Molly Weasley on his own, but given the nature of their relationship he thought it best that a neutral party also be involved.
There stood Hermione Granger—or Weasley—and her mother-in-law. He had not seen either woman since the end of the war five years prior. He took a deep breath and decided that the best way to navigate this awkward situation was to pretend they were any other customer. He put on his best smile and began his greeting again.
Draco’s mouth remained tight at the mention of his first name. He did not consider their relationship one that required first names. He actually preferred that their relationship remain nonexistent. “We have something to discuss with Potter,” he responded in a clipped tone.
A low murmur filled the room as guests ended their conversations and took to their seats. Draco sat stiffly, waiting for the other occupants of their table with some dread. If Potter was seated next to him, it was likely this table would be full of Weasleys. This was truly a fate worse than death for the young man. The Malfoy name was held with some suspicion, but few knew more of what Draco had done during the war than the Golden Trio and their band of red-headed misfits.
Molly beamed and Harry hid a smile behind his hands. Everyone knew the best way to compliment a great cook was to ask for their recipe. Draco could be such a suck-up sometimes. He jumped when he felt a kick to his shin and looked up to see Draco's glare. Harry just grinned. Apparently his boyfriend knew exactly what he'd been thinking.
Draco chanced a look at Potter to see his green eyes lit with amusement. Despite his best efforts his eyes drifted down to Potter’s bare chest and abs. Eva had been right. He was quite fit and Draco was suddenly very glad there was a pillow in his lap.
Harry was about to respond but Weasley beat him to it. "She's right, mate. Besides, you can't leave me here with Hermione and all these books!" He received a venomous look from his wife and gulped. "I mean, you have to help us look through the books. We'll have a hard time getting through them in such a short time. It'll be like old times, yeah?"
Eva turned to Draco, but he shook his head. “You won’t know these dances.” She frowned. “Besides, the ministry officials will take the floor first.”
Ariana nodded. "I totally agree. I have never liked when an author gives characters a sex change. I find it as a cop out for not wanting to have a…well, we'll get to that later," she finished evasively.
Draco nodded and chanced a look at their companions. The trio looked mildly uncomfortable and Draco decided that alcohol would be the only way to survive the evening. He gestured toward the bartender and ordered a round of shots. He gave him the credit card Eva had helped him get when they’d started frequenting muggle establishments. With a tap to the shoulder, he motioned for Eva to help him pass out the shots.
“What? Can’t take your alcohol?” Weasley challenged. Granger groaned and Harry seemed to watch the interaction with interest.
“Wha—?” Eva mumbled. She looked at her surroundings, startled. Her wide eyes found Draco. “Jeesh! What’d you do that for?”
The group followed the inn keeper up some creaky steps and down a narrow hallway. “What did we decide about room arrangements?” Draco asked softly.
Granger looked around the space in wide-eyed wonder, and Draco—for once—couldn't blame her. The New Delhi Wizarding Library was massive. The large ceilings contained floor to ceiling shelving that was full of books and scrolls. Several tables were stationed around the room where wizards and witches could take their selections to study. The ceiling glinted with dancing gold images. And that was just the first room of the library.
They were both breathing heavily from exertion. Harry looked to be sweating just as much as Draco, but at least he seemed to be enjoying himself. The eyeliner made his eyes gleam in the glowing lights, and Draco had to suppress a groan as Eva’s description came back to him; they did indeed look like emeralds.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked worriedly. His hair was matted to his forehead and he reeked of sweat, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to care. Those bright green eyes consumed his vision and he wasn’t so sure the heat was responsible.
Draco snorted. “Hardly. You fell asleep on my shoulder, thereby preventing me from getting up.” He sniffed and moved toward the refreshment cart.
“A bloody drink,” Draco muttered. His headache was returning and he was trying very hard not to curse the next person that opened his or her mouth. He was sure that would gain him a one way ticket to Azkaban. He fleetingly wondered if that would indeed be a better option, but decided he was too young to explore that possibility.
Eventually Draco pulled away and hit his head against the shower wall. "Enough teasing." He grabbed Harry's cock and squeezed. Harry's breath left him and all he could do was nod. How Draco had poured oil on his hands without Harry noticing he would never know. All that really mattered was that they were both ready and Draco was turning around. When Harry entered him he had to steady himself to keep from coming right then and there. Draco felt amazing and he would be happy to just stand there and feel those muscles contract around him.
trying to be nice. The insistence on calling him “Draco” was leaving him utterly confused. Obviously the hatred was no longer there, but certainly Potter couldn’t want friendship? The very idea was laughable, no matter how much Draco used to yearn for it—still yearned for it if he was to be completely honest. Actually, complete honesty would require that he admit that he desired more than mere friendship.
Draco was grateful that the redhead had closed the bathroom door, but he winced as he heard the tell-tale signs of traveler’s diarrhea. He would never admit it, but he had his own experience with that. His family had done a lot of travelling when he was younger. His parents had always ensured that he ate only safe food, but he had once gone against their advice. He had hidden a treat a vendor had given him and eaten it in private. As a young child he didn’t understand that there were consequences to introducing your system to a foreign food quite suddenly. The only reason he hadn’t been punished was because of how sick the treat had made him.
A few more strokes to that magical spot and Draco came with a cry. Harry wasn’t far behind, and he milked his orgasm as he emptied into his partner. He collapsed against Draco’s back and found that they were both shaking from exertion. He watched idly as the evidence of their activities washed down the drain. They let the steam of the shower billow around them until Draco began fidgeting.
Malfoy scoffed. “Well I can hardly be sure, can I? I don’t know all the facts. This is all just a highly educated supposition.” He folded his hands and smirked.
and took off after the suspect. He was heading for the tree line, and the edge of the anti-apparition wards. Harry tried to force his legs to move more quickly. He couldn't decide if it was worth the effort, or if he should risk stopping and attempting a spell. His indecision cost him. The man made it past the wards, wand in hand. As he spun into the apparition, a pale figure jumped out and attached itself to him. In the blink of an eye they were both gone.
Raj chuckled. "Yes, I can see how obvious that might seem to you. However, the Chintamani has been nothing but a rumor for centuries. A very obscure rumor at that."
Draco’s protest was cut off by Potter’s sigh and tug toward the door. “Stop man-handling me, Potter!” he said indignantly.
“Well aren’t you special?” she spat before heading off to scare lingering customers out of the store. Draco shook his head in confusion. Eva had been in a bad mood all day and he could not figure out why. He thought she would still be on a high from the ball and would be thrilled with the attention she was receiving. Whenever he asked her what was wrong she would brush him off. As he prepared to close down the registers he decided that he was going to have to force Eva to a cup of coffee.
“Let’s just get going,” Draco responded, grabbing Eva by the elbow. Once situated in the fireplace—it was always tricky flooing with a second person—Draco wrapped his arm around Eva’s waste and gathered a handful of floo powder. After making sure Eva was secure he shouted their destination.
Draco glared at the red-head. “You still lack any sense of propriety,” he said. “Yes, my best friend is a muggle, and I suggest you consider her feelings before you start to tease me.”
"I'm used to it," Harry responded. "Besides, I want to get to know you. The real you. Not the mental image of you I made up in school."
At that moment Weasley chose to make his presence known. “Harry!” he exclaimed loudly. “I hafta tell you…tell you…what?” He blinked rapidly and looked to his wife. “Help me out Minee.”
Eva walked to her bedroom, presumably to change her clothes. “Doubting your apparation skills?” she called.
Granger smiled kindly and turned to Draco. Her smile grew a bit more strained. “Malfoy. I’m glad you could make it.”
Draco followed them into the gathering room and was soon surrounded by excited youths ranging in age from two to sixteen. Though the battle for his attention left him with little understanding of what the children were saying, apparently they all picked up on a specific request. Soon the chant of "story time" filled the room.
His efforts earned him a grin and Harry was uplifted as they left the house and headed for St. Catherine's Orphanage. They had been volunteering at the children's home for the past couple of months and Harry had been talked into dressing up as Santa for the kids. Donations had allowed the organization to buy presents for every child (Draco may have surreptitiously added to the collection, though he would never admit it if asked). They had dropped the last of the presents off the day before and hidden them away from prying eyes. Now they were headed out so Santa could deliver the presents.
He turned to find a tall Indian man smiling at him. The man’s skin was dark and flawless, his perfectly straight teeth gleaming behind full lips. His charcoal eyes held intelligence, and his long, ebony hair was pulled into a low pony tail. The man was well dressed, and it was obvious the material of his clothes were made for the Indian heat. “Would you care to dance?” he asked confidently.
He brought his eyes back to Potter’s face and was surprised to see a faint blush. They stared at each other for a moment before Eva’s escaped giggle brought them back to reality. Potter blushed harder and hurried to his bed. He turned his back to him and Draco watched as he pulled a shirt on.
The group gathered in the den and the chess board was immediately set up. It soon became clear that Ron and Draco were pretty evenly matched, with Draco just barely beating Ron. Ron immediately called for a rematch; after he won the second game it was determined that the best of three would be crowned champion. When Ron won the third the impromptu tournament would have easily continued except by then both Hermione and Harry were falling asleep in their seats. Harry informed Draco it was time to go home and Hermione forced Ron away from the chess board. As they all said their goodbyes, Harry was amazed that the competition hadn't come to blows.
"I don't think glaring at it is going to make it disappear," Harry said from beside him, voice laced with amusement.
"Dwaco!" she exclaimed, throwing herself into his arms. She was a six-year-old with a bit of a lisp, and was fond of Draco because he had told the other kids to stop making fun of her. "Where's Hawwy?"
“Why would I freely give you information that could lead to my arrest?” Malfoy’s voice dripped with disdain.
Eva rolled her eyes. “Thank you very much Mr. Gutma. I’m sure we’ll be fine.” She took the keys from the jovial man. With a wink and a grin he left them in the hallway.
Unfortunately his little outburst did seem to draw a few eyes. Eva peeked above the back of her seat and frowned at him. "Play nice," she admonished. "And do keep it down. Or do you want everyone on this bus to know your business," she hissed. Her eyes flickered to the Weasleys sitting across the aisle. The redhead was asleep, but Granger was looking at them with a raised brow and a frown.
A chill went down Draco’s back at the mention of the name, and the shudder that followed had nothing to do with his usual theatrics. He thought back to his sixth and seventh years, and recalled the horror of that time. He still struggled with nightmares of the things he’d been forced to do under the Dark Lord’s service. “Please don’t say his name,” Draco whispered.
They stood together for some time, Harry rubbing circles around Malfoy’s back. He took deep, even breaths, hoping to pass on his steadiness. He let himself enjoy the closeness of the man, not allowing himself to think of all the reasons this was wrong. After a while Malfoy took a deep breath before pulling back a little. Harry found himself falling into grey eyes. Before he could gather enough sense to stop, he leaned forward and placed his lips against Malfoy’s.
The next morning Draco had to contend with Jackie’s predictable fascination for all things celebrity. She plagued him with questions about the attendees of the ball. Did he really sit next to Harry Potter? Did he get to meet Arthur Weasley? Why didn’t he tell her he was
The young woman sorted herself out before looking at the pair in relief. She immediately jumped from the couch and began pacing. "Oh thank god, it actually worked. I've never tried implanting myself in the story; I always bring the characters to me. But this worked!" She twirled a gold pen between her fingers before sticking it beneath the rubber band holding her ponytail. "You guys have to help me," she said, never ceasing her pacing. "I cannot get this damn story out of my head, and it's ruining my relaxing evening." She paused, seeming to gather her nerve. "Okay, before I even get to the actual plot—if you can call it that—let's just talk the technical stuff. First of all, this girl has apparently never had a grammar course in her life! I would claim she was a three-year-old but she would have to be one fucked up three-year-old to write this shit. But anyway, she also can't spell to save her life. I don't think she's even sounding out the words. And don't get me started on the sentence structure!"
His eyes immediately flew to Eva as he entered the platform. Seeing that she seemed composed he took out his wand and lifted the spell. “You really need to learn the art of subtlety,” he admonished coolly.
He finished the story and nodded gently toward Johnny. It was time for Santa to make his appearance.
Draco chuckled as he placed his dirty laundry in his suitcase. He stiffened as he felt eyes on his back and turned to find Potter staring at him. Despite his promise to himself minutes earlier, old defenses sprang up. “Can I help you?” he snapped.
She quickly explained what had transpired minutes ago and the traumatizing effects it was having. She waited fifteen minutes without a response. He had probably rolled his eyes and deleted her message. Jerk. Ariana groaned and hit her head-yet again-against the wall. Why did she think he would understand? He had given up fanfiction years ago!
Momentarily appeased, Draco nodded carefully. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know, but he certainly didn’t want Eva going into dangerous situations by herself. He was not courageous by any means, but he did owe a lot to the muggle.
They arrived at her apartment and Draco collapsed onto the couch. “I am so glad I connected you to the floo network.”
Draco really wanted to smack himself in the forehead, a habit he had picked up from Eva. It seemed Lucius had finally admitted the benefits of Draco’s friendship with Eva, but that friendship would have to end there. That would never be a problem, though Draco was not yet ready to reveal
Draco hummed in agreement. “Whatever the motive behind the decision, it does nothing to harm the Malfoy name in public opinion. If it has any effect at all, it can only be for the positive.”
“An unusual name,” Raj said. “Well, if you don’t mind, I don’t like being glared at. I shall return you to your friend.”
Harry frowned again but nodded. "Come find us when you're done." He gave Draco a parting look. It left the blond a bit confused as he followed Raj out of the room.
“Eye-liner,” she clarified with the air of an artist. “Yes, I think that would be absolutely perfect.”
Her incessant babbling was giving Draco a headache, and he had to use all his social graces to keep his face neutral. A pained frown was desperately trying to break through, but Draco would not give it the satisfaction. For Eva’s plebian—yet clearly effective—tactic to work, he needed to remain nonthreatening. He didn’t want Granger coming along on this trip, but he really had no choice if it was the only way to get Potter to agree. He could already see the witch’s posture change. The battle was all but won.
Harry blinked in surprise. It would certainly explain how casual he was being. He was just too tired to keep up the front. "Do you think that’s wise, considering you’ve been targeted?"
Potter sighed. “You two are absolutely impossible.” He glanced around their surroundings. “Is this Tughlabad?”
Granger frowned in mild disbelief. “I’m not entirely sure I believe that,” she responded bluntly, glancing at the blond wizard. Draco noted that the witch at least had marginal observation skills.
She sauntered over to his side and studied his selection. “Go with the charcoal,” she advised. “It brings out your eyes.”
They were all crowded in the Weasleys’ room, looking appraisingly at one Ronald Weasley. His face was pale and covered in sweat. He looked ready to die, and if they had not known the cause for the sudden illness, they would have found a healer, stat. A sound came from his stomach and Weasley’s groan responded to it.
A bit of a warning: the chapter opens with an unpleasant stomach illness. Not in great detail, and very short, but I thought I’d be courteous to those who might be bothered by it.
His eyes twinkled. “I think I shall,” he said, before pulling a bewildered Granger to the dance floor. Draco decided to ignore them, not wanting to witness the embarrassment that was likely to be Weasley’s dance moves. He was about to order a water when he felt a tap on his shoulder.
The brunet was grinning. Suddenly, without warning, Harry launched himself at Draco and tackled him to the ground.
Harry saw Ron’s face twitch and bit back a sigh. They were adults now—aurors no less. He could be a professional. Absolutely.
“And I’ve already disagreed.” He sighed. “It’s not your fault Harry. The git knew what he was getting into.”
Draco stood and walked over to Harry. He pulled the fake beard and mustache down and planted a kiss on his lips. "You look like a jolly old fat man and the kids will be excited to see you."
“My name is Draco,” he muttered, taking another sip. “Why in Merlin’s name can you not get that right?”
"Oh for crying out loud," Harry exclaimed. He bent down and picked up a note that had fallen from the small explosion.
"It is because it's you!" he exclaimed a bit more loudly than he intended. His body's reaction to the proximity of Harry and the memory of the kiss was only making his emotions more jumbled and his mood more frustrated.
If one has been able to identify the two young men by description alone, they would have noticed that the inevitable fight between the two had yet to break out. Let it be noted that the hostess planned for just this. In fact, the ploy to remove the wands was in part so that they could not curse her. However, it was more for the fact that the two would be so disturbed over their missing wands, that they would have little attention to give to their rivalry.
"You're not in custody, Draco," he responded. He fidgeted with his sleeves. "You can leave whenever you want."
“You will always live in interesting times,” Eva responded with a smirk. She looked at him mysteriously.
The trio walked to a café on the corner near their inn. Harry and Eva both cringed as Draco sipped very strong, very black coffee. They had chosen to add cream and sugar to their coffee, like civilized people.
“You want me to run straight into a wall?” she asked testily. “I’m not in the mood for your jokes, Malfoy.”
Eva jumped up and grabbed his shoulders. “What are you going on about? You’re catastrophizing again. You always think of the worst case scenarios. It’s not like we have to tell them what we’re doing. We want to go on a vacation. They would give me clearance through the Indian Ministry of Magic as a gesture of goodwill. The Indian and British ministries have a very good relationship you know? I already looked into it.”
"—apricot," she finished lamely. She shot a grin at her mother. "What did you think I was going to say?" Molly just harrumphed and waved her wand to begin clearing the table.
Draco was pulled from his thoughts by a pounding on the bathroom door. “Draco Malfoy! Get your lily-white ass out of the shower! You are not the only one craving cleanliness!”
Lucius had finally accepted that Draco had a muggle friend. As a rule he could not like her, but his positive appraisal of her personality was a step in the right direction. Still, Draco could not help but shudder at the prospect of the ball. He was sure it would not be enjoyable. It would also require important political finesse. He did not want to draw attention to himself as many people still saw the Malfoys in a negative light. At the same time he would need to be seen so the public would know that Malfoys supported such an event. He frowned as he speared another pea. It was going to be a trying evening indeed.
“Who’s hungry?” she asked. She looked much better for showering and seemed to also be in a better mood.
Ariana sighed impatiently. "Can we all just skip this coming out boringness and get to the good part?"
“Which still sounds like a fairy tale,” Draco protested. He studied his friend. “What are you doing looking into it anyway?”
This time Draco did chuckle. “They are hardly expert interrogators,” he said disdainfully. “And the only information they picked from me was my current employment.”
“She is correct,” was Narcissa’s opinion on the matter at dinner that night. “It will help bolster public opinion about our family, which can only be beneficial.”
Draco had never heard of such a practice, and was appalled that the ministry would allow a muggle to live freely among wizards. He supposed it was part of the new praise-the-muggles mentality that had swept the community. Of course Eva was currently his only friend, so he couldn’t really protest to her presence too much. She was proving to be an ally in helping him become muggle-tolerant enough for the ministry. Although he did secretly commend the Minster of Magic for ensuring her silence through the use of a spell.
He didn't necessarily agree that researching morbid rituals was a way to extend the moment, but at least Malfoy was acknowledging that there was something there. The thought was relieving. Or terrifying. But Malfoy was right: they had an alchemist to catch.
He was awoken by an irritating poking in his side. He batted at the hand and grumbled something unintelligible. The pressure shifted to his cheek and he opened his eyes to glare at a slightly blurry version of his best friend. “Wakey, wakey Drakey,” she said, grinning. He groaned and shut his eyes again, registering the fact that he was sitting down and leaning against someone’s shoulder. He frowned. It couldn’t be Eva’s shoulder because she was on his other side. He suddenly remembered who their other companion was and shot up, instantly awake.
!?” Harry snapped as someone cleared their throat. He turned to find Ron staring at him with wide eyes.
“Oh! Harry Potter!” She grinned. “What an interesting turn of events. I wonder if he has anything to do with our seating?”
Draco could feel the excitement radiating from the witch and resisted the urge to roll his eyes. He could get excited about certain topics of interest, but Granger was the absolute limit.
"If you stare at it long enough," Draco responded. "Do you like staring at my poker face?" he asked with a grin.
of all people, yet at the same time urging himself to move on with the past. At night his body didn’t seem all that interested in his mental dilemma and he found himself thinking of the blond more than he would care to admit.
Eva frowned. “Are you okay, Dray? Here’s some water. Take small sips.” She handed him the bottle and after a moment spent remembering what he was supposed to do with it, he took it and did as she said. He half listened as she spoke to Harry. “Why do you think he’s delirious?”
Malfoy was waiting at the door when Harry approached. Something in Harry’s face must have given away his mood because Malfoy frowned at him. “You look like you could use some tea,” he said as he ushered Harry inside. “Or maybe some scotch.”
“Will you be all right?” Granger asked. The unasked question was also there. She wanted to know if Potter trusted Draco enough to go by himself with the blond and his friend.
Draco looked at his friend and back to Granger. “It is possible to continue your day with traveler’s diarrhea; it’s just not very comfortable.”
"We kissed," Harry said. "It's not a complicated concept." The sarcasm really did do wonders for the man's voice, but that was not where Draco needed his thoughts to be centered.
“While that reasoning may have been enlightened at one point, its overuse has made it virtually useless in practice.”
Harry shook his head and tried to back up, but Eva refused to release him. “I’m not wearing make-up,” he protested. “I’m not a girl.” As if that fact was ever a question.
He watched as the man took out a strange looking candle. He needed to stop him before he grabbed the flame. If he got away with it they would have lost their only lead. He eased his way closer to the fire. Just as the man was about to immerse the wick, he called out. The man jerked and whipped his head up to stare at Harry. His eyes widened in recognition and he threw the now lit candle at Harry before taking off at a run.
After sending the young man off with some jeans for his girlfriend, Draco leaned behind the cash register and scanned the empty store. The Weasleys were the only customers at the moment and he was quite bored. Eva seemed to pick up on it and skipped over to him. “They’re deciding between three gowns right now. She’s trying to figure out which one she likes best with the shoes we picked out.” She stared at Draco intently when he shrugged. “I know you could have handled that one yourself. Why’d you pawn it off on me?”
Something lodged itself in Harry's throat as he thought about what that could mean. He wasn't sure he wanted to know. But he was an auror first, and not one known to be squeamish. "All right," he said, glad that his voice didn't waiver.
Draco watched as the dark-haired man poured sugar and cream into his mug. “What is the point of drinking coffee if you’re only going to ruin the flavor?” he asked in disgust.
Harry leaned back from the table and closed his eyes in satisfaction. Molly had really outdone herself this Christmas. She always overdid it for the holidays, but this Christmas there was definitely a bit extra. It may have been that she was trying to impress a certain blond guest.
Draco understood what his father was implying and frowned. “We aren’t dating, if that’s what you’re concerned about.”
“I do realize that, Father,” Draco said stiffly, finishing the last of his pastries. “He did not elicit any information from me that I would not want him to have.”
“Eva!” Granger’s eyes lit with honest pleasure. “I’m so glad you could make it!” She was only slightly taken aback when Eva offered her a quick hug. “What do you think?” She waved a hand to encompass the ballroom.
Ron bit his lip and visibly struggled to keep the anger out of his face. Harry was fighting back his own urge to protest. “Why do you even want to help?” he asked Malfoy.
“I’ve had enough excitement for several lifetimes, thank you very much.” He recalled his years before Potter’s victory and the court cases that followed.
"He's a good player, I'll give you that," Draco said, moving into the kitchen to make some tea. Harry followed him. "However, he has a horrible—what's that muggle saying?—poker face."
Weasley seemed to at least understand the manners involved in drinking and clinked his glass against Eva’s. “Cheers, then,” he said. Everyone followed his example and as one they tipped the glasses back and swallowed.
"If a person disappears, they can leave a trail that can and will be followed. But the aurors aren’t going to use their full force to hunt down missing body parts, especially when the victims are already dead. He’s trying not to get caught."
Malfoy frowned. "It's not pleasant. The ritual suggests that a person’s soul can be returned as long as there is a vessel for it to enter. There isn’t an agreement in the discipline over the form of that vessel. People have tried various methods, but again no one has been successful. The alchemical magic that takes place always draws from the conductor. And in this ritual, the results are never pleasant. Death is only the most forgiving consequence I’ve heard."
Harry could feel the redhead watching so he took a gulp of the still hot tea. He immediately felt a little of his strain ease and sighed. It had been a rough couple of days. Even Robards had tried to convince him to go home and take a break. His reaction to that suggestion had almost gotten him suspended. As Harry drank his tea he felt his thoughts start to slow. Maybe Ron was right and he should get some rest. His lids felt heavy and he couldn't shake the grogginess. It was almost as if—
He was saved from responding by Potter’s—oh all right Harry’s—exit from the bathroom. The brunet’s hair was still wet enough that droplets of water slid down his neck and bare torso. This time there was no pillow to hide behind and Draco could feel his face grow warm. He was beginning to suspect Harry did these things on purpose. He tried to look nonchalant, but he didn’t know how successful that was since he was sure his face was incredibly red.
“Come on Draco!” Eva whined. “Don’t you want to know if the stone is real? Think of the excitement, Draco! The thrill of the hunt!”
Harry stood. "Of course I am," he said. He turned and began walking toward his bed. "But you just answered any question I had."
"You were tipsy. Shut up. The fact is, Harry, that he will try to blame anything and everything in order to hide the fact that he wanted to kiss you. So, before you put your foot in your mouth—you dumb blond—and cause a huge fight and hurt feelings, recognize that sometimes I just know better. I'm saving your sorry ass here and you better be damn grateful!" She stood with a flourish and stomped into the bathroom.
Draco snorted and continued to watch the couples glide across the floor. Had life been different, he would have been one required to participate in the dances; he might have even enjoyed it. Now, no one cared to share a dance floor with a Malfoy. He silently thanked his luck. He much preferred the effortless dancing in the clubs Eva had dragged him to over the stiff, choreographed moves of wizarding dance.
“All right,” said Harry, looking around the room. He’d analyzed this scene quite enough already. “Let’s get out of here.”
"You should be." Harry glared at the blond, but Malfoy held up his hands in a placating gesture. "Seriously. He only has a few pieces left for his construction, and that's assuming you’ve uncovered all his victims. I don't think you’re going to get anywhere until the guy steals a head."
"Haha," Harry said sarcastically, rolling his eyes. "I guess I'll just have to judge for myself. Let's get going."
"If his motives are what we assume, then he'll want a head that resembles the person he lost. That might narrow down your suspect pool."
She frowned. “If you insist. I don’t really trust taxi drivers but I guess I’ve got some good body guards.” She smiled.
Harry sighed. "The only main character who was also a creature was Remus. Unless you count Hagrid as a half-giant."
Draco sniffed. "Of course not, I'm a Slytherin. I've been trained to lie with a straight face, and not give anything away."
it,” he said through gritted teeth. He remembered his previous description of Eva as a five-year-old when it came to explaining magic, and he heartily agreed with it. As surprising as many people might find it, Draco was actually quite good with children. Of course, that was after a good night’s sleep, a proper breakfast, and when the child was not encased in the body of a grown woman.
“Well, I think it makes your eyes look lovely,” Hermione said. “I’m always telling you how nice your eyes are.”
In a rare show of wisdom, Harry simply nodded. ‘Sorry,’ Eva mouthed, but Draco just shrugged. She rolled her eyes and shook off the awkward moment with a grin. “I can’t wait to see Ron’s face when he finds out where we’re going.”
And then his vision swam and he closed his eyes and leaned against the chair. “You’re an idiot,” he heard Eva sigh. “First vertigo, then dehydration. You can’t just pop into an upright position.” He felt a silent communication pass over his head and soon Potter was grabbing his arm and easing him out of the back seat. He tested out his eyesight and nearly sighed in relief at the restoration of his normal vision. He still felt a little unsteady, so he didn’t protest Potter’s continued hold on his arm.
A hand wrapped around his wrist and forced him from his thoughts as he was dragged out of the bus. He took in gulps of fresh air that he hadn’t quite realized he missed while on the crowded vehicle. Eva dropped his wrist and let him have a moment to compose himself. Whether it was the cluster of travelers or his wandering thoughts that had him so suddenly uncomfortable he could not really say.
Unfortunately Potter had chosen that exact moment to take another sip of his coffee. The burning liquid never completed its journey as at Draco’s declaration it was unceremoniously spewed from Potter’s mouth and into Draco’s face. This left Eva in a fit of hysterics. She clutched her sides and collapsed onto the bench. Potter couldn’t decide whether to choke on the little liquid that did make it down or apologize profusely to Draco. As for Draco, he cleaned his face with a quick spell and silently swore vengeance on the wizard and the muggle who claimed to be his best friend.
“Right,” Draco said, wondering why this would have Eva in such a mood. “So what is this ‘Cintamani’?” he asked, carefully pronouncing the word. “What is that, Gaelic?” He hadn’t heard of that name either and had to admit that there were likely many foreign artifacts that he knew little about.
Harry nodded, fighting the embarrassing blush trying to cover his face. It was too easy to jump to conclusions with Malfoy. "Sorry," he muttered, studying the page in front him. He finally noticed the text and leaned forward in surprise. "Is this alchemy?"
Draco snorted and even Harry chuckled. “That certainly will be quite a scene.” He eyed the object in Eva’s hands. “So how do I put on this eye-liner,” he mumbled, cheeks burning.
Potter frowned and turned away. It seemed even the green-eyed Savior didn’t want to go tripping down memory lane. He felt a sense of relief until he felt three pairs of eyes on him. He turned again to his left to find Eva and the newly married Weasleys looking at him. The Weasel was smirking—not a good look for the red-head. “Your best friend is a muggle?” he asked, holding back a chuckle.
Raj and Eva conversed quietly as Draco went over the past few minutes in his head. Was Harry jealous? He certainly seemed to dislike Raj for no apparent reason. It was unlikely the boy-wonder would be jealous for his sake. Then again, hadn't he kissed Draco after Raj had danced with him? It was all too confusing. He frowned. These were not the kind of complications he needed in his life at the moment.
A brilliant idea suddenly popped into her head. She even thought she saw the faint outline of a light bulb hovering above her. Jumping up, she raced to her dresser and dug to the bottom of the top drawer. With a triumphant smile she pulled out a golden pen. It was the magical tool that any truly insane author had in his or her storage. With a wicked grin she thought about her destination before disappearing.
Harry shook his head in fear as recognition hit him. There were so many questions to ask. "Why do you look different?" Admittedly that should not have been the first question he asked. By the look on Draco's face, he thought the same way.
Eva rolled her eyes. “Your language knowledge sucks. It’s Sanskrit.” She plopped the notebook in his lap. “In Hindu mythology the Enchanted Stone was given as a gift from the sky to the king of Tibet. It’s said that the person who possesses the Enchanted Stone will be granted anything they wish for.”
The walk to the club was not long, but Draco and Eva used the opportunity to spend some quality time together. The trio followed at a sedate pace, and he could hear Weasley giving Harry a hard time about the make-up.
“A side-along after a few drinks is a recipe for disaster,” he criticized. Sometimes he felt like he had to treat the woman like a five-year-old.
Malfoy frowned. "Merlin, no. Why ever would I do that?" He closed the door as Harry crossed into the manor. "A few house elves maintain the property, but they are no longer used to answering the door."
Eva glared at her best friend. “Calm down you idiot,” she said sternly, pulling the wild blond back onto the sofa. “I’m not trying to raise my parents from the dead. I’m not stupid.” She shook her head. “No, I want to become a witch.”
would love to have you!” Eva changed tactics and pulled out the full force of her pleading eyes. “Please, Hermione! You just have to come! I really want to go to India. And if you come I just know Harry will and then the Ministry will let Draco go!” She took Granger’s hand in both of hers. “I’ve always wanted to go to India, and I know Draco would benefit from a vacation. Please Hermione?”
They left the gathering room to a chorus of goodbyes. After making sure they weren't being followed, they entered the kitchen and exited out the side door. The air had chilled with the coming of evening, and Draco shivered. He looked to his companion, who seemed unaffected by the cold.
Ariana nodded. "This one was truly horrible. I couldn't finish it, no matter how fatal my curiosity is for internet jokes."
He opened the paper to page three, noticing the second page was dominated by a thorough explanation of the Muggle Awareness Campaign and the purpose of the ball. The larger part of the third page was the obligatory detailing of Harry Potter’s presence at the ball, complete with an interview and animated picture. Three-fourths of the way down was the article bearing the Malfoy name. The title “Draco Malfoy Brings Muggle Date to the Ball” told him all he needed to know. Someone had been listening in on their table’s conversations. The image chosen for the article was one taken just as Eva and Draco entered the ballroom. The photographer had captured Eva’s wide-eyed awe, though Draco’s image contained a rather uncomfortable frown. Though it did nothing to mar his image, Draco was faced with the knowledge of the various thoughts that frown could convey. He would have to be careful of that in the future.
He chose to ignore what had to be an insult and let Malfoy show him his notes. He began reading them while Malfoy flipped through a book across the table. A few times he would look up only to see grey eyes flick back down. Harry had a suspicion that he was being watched. He didn't know what Malfoy was looking for, and he certainly didn't know why it caused his pulse to speed up. After a length of time so steeped in tension that Harry couldn't possibly measure accurately, Malfoy leaned back and stretched. Harry watched through lowered lashes as his shirt rode up and revealed a stretch of pale skin. He wondered what the rest would look like.
Potter sighed and rubbed his temples. “You guys are worse than Ron and Hermione.” Draco bristled at the comparison but said nothing. “Where are we going today, Eva?”
“It’s not a competition,” he muttered, but Malfoy was already ordering the house elf to bring the pensieve. The elf placed the bowl in the center of the table before backing away. After receiving a pointed look, Harry sighed and reluctantly tapped his wand against his head. He drew the memory out and swirled it into the liquid. “Ready?” he asked. Malfoy just glared at him before they both lowered their heads.
Ariana shrugged, and then grinned as she realized the next topic. Composing herself she got ready to show the grand finale. "Okay you guys, I'm about to show the last one. Are you ready?"
Draco stretched after a long nap he had seriously needed. He looked out the window at the passing landscape. Despite the available wall next to Eva—as she had insisted on the window seat—her head was taking up residence on Draco’s shoulder. His arm was going numb but he didn’t so much as fidget. He’d had enough of Eva’s temper that morning.
