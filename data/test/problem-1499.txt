But back to Dobby. He wears a tea cosy as a hat and he’d decorated it with a Christmas bauble. He gave us both our presents, two pair of socks. Dobby had made them himself. We both had one sock filled with Snitches and one with broomsticks upon it. Draco was really happy with them and Dobby asked him to put them on right away. That made Draco blush because that would mean getting out from underneath the blankets and well, he had no clothes on. Blaise threw some boxers our way and told us to get dressed and make the elf happy so he could go back to sleep. He didn’t care about his presents at all, not like Greg who was already unwrapping them. Draco put on the boxers and then got out of bed to pull on the socks. Then he walked to his trunk and took out a package he gave Dobby, a gift he apparently had gotten for the elf. Dobby opened his package and then his mouth dropped open. Dobby was shaking his head and saying master Draco shouldn’t be giving Dobby this. But Draco insisted he takes it, that it used to be Dobby’s when he still lived at the manor and that he deserves to have them back. It turned out Draco had given him a set of photo’s of when Draco was little, some of them had Dobby in it, and some were with an older elf. After Dobby left, Draco explained that the older elf had been Dobby’s father who had passed away when Draco was six or seven.
“She has to,” Harry says.
“Who are we looking for?” Draco asks.
But then professor Lupin started to tell his story, about how he became a werewolf and how Dumbledore had made sure that Lupin could go to school. And how the Whomping Willow and the Shrieking Shack were built so he could safely transform without hurting anyone. But he was happy because he had friends. Sirius, Peter and you, dad. He told us about how you all found out that he was a werewolf and that you learnt to become Animagus so you could help him when he transformed. That it made him less dangerous.
“Being a prick?” Neville asks with a raised eyebrow.
It’s in the paper the next day. Draco stares at the picture of Harry on the front. It’s the one they used over and over again last year during the TriWizard tournament. Draco had thought Harry wouldn’t survive the first task. But he’s made it all the way to the final and even survived the Dark Lord. So why couldn’t he survive a silly little accident? Why did he have to die now? Now that Draco had fallen in love with him? Life would have been so much easier if Harry hadn’t come back from the graveyard. Draco would have never know what he’d lost.
And Harry does. He tells how Pettigrew tried to kill him. And how Draco punched Pettigrew in the stomach and cast a protection spell to save Harry. He explains how Pettigrew got away and how Remus and Snape had shown up.
“Of course we can,” Harry tells him. Draco looks at the two, so in sync with each other. Just like a father and his son. Draco has to close his eyes and not think of the other son they could have had by now.
“What happens now?” Harry asks. His hand holds Draco’s and Draco concentrates on how their fingers fit perfectly together. It’s easier than thinking of the dead baby inside him.
“No,” Harry shouts as Pettigrew raises the wand and then grabs Draco’s arm with his other hand. He pulls Draco towards him, turns him around and then points the wand at Draco’s throat. Harry freezes on the spot. His heart hammers in his ears. His eyes are locked on Draco’s.
“Yeah, that’ll be cool,” Ron says. He lays down and closes his eyes. Ready to fall asleep now he doesn’t need to study anymore.
Neville and Harry laugh. Harry leans his head on Hermione’s shoulder. “He’s better when he’s asleep,” he tells her.
“You’re sure?” Harry asks.
Leaving Hagrid behind, I still wasn’t really looking at where I was walking. Ernie’s words just kept spinning in my head. ‘Justin has been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born.’ How could they think this of me? My best friend is a Muggle-born. Why would I hate them, if the only person in this castle that still cares about me is one of them? I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I didn’t see something lying on the ground. I tripped over it and when I turned to see what I had fallen over I felt as though my stomach had dissolved. Justin was laying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And next to him was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. I got to my feet and looked up and down the corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies.
Thinking of Draco made me think of our fear of Voldemort coming back. Now that the stone is gone he will have to find another way. And headmaster Dumbledore agreed with me that he is still out there somewhere. We had a little talk after that about you, mom. Because Voldemort had said that you had died trying to stop him from killing me and I asked the headmaster if he knew why Voldemort wanted me dead in the first place. Headmaster Dumbledore said he couldn’t tell me why, not now at least. He will tell me when I’m older and ready. I don’t know what that means, but it wouldn’t have helped to argue. The headmaster did tell me why Quirrell couldn’t touch me. It’s because you died to save me, mom.  Your love for me also left a mark on me, an invisible protection in my skin. It had been agony for professor Quirrell to touch a person marked by something so good.
I've updated the tags to include suicide attempt because of this chapter, if this might be a trigger for you, please skip this chapter and continue on to the next where things will start looking up.
“Okay,” Draco answers. He’ll go to a healer. He will let them do tests, let them find out that it’s all Draco’s fault. That the mark he still carries on his arm is to blame for everything. And then he’ll watch how Harry will slowly distant himself, how he will leave and find a man that can make his biggest desire come true.
It helps a little to hear Harry say the words; it only doesn’t take the pain away. After some time they sit down on the shower floor, and Harry pulls Draco on his lap and holds him while Draco cries. The pain becomes worse with every cramp. Small tickles of blood flow from Draco, and he hopes that it will be over soon. He’s so tempted to go for the pain potions to relieve his pain, no matter the consequences. This pain is too much, too unbearable. It’s then that the first little jelly-like tissue leaves Draco’s body. For a moment Draco wonders if that is all, but the cramps don’t die down and he’s afraid it’s not over yet.
Harry, Neville, Ron and Hermione sit in the Great Hall. Study books have been pulled out after breakfast and they all try to finish their homework as quickly as possible. It’s a beautiful day today, and they all want to enjoy the sun and go outside. Nobody looks up when Draco slips in between Harry and Neville. Nobody, except Harry. Their eyes lock for a second. They smile. And then they both focus on their work, all set up on getting it over with as soon as possible. When lunch starts, they are all about done with all the work.
“No, he will,” Harry says. “He’s scared. The last time he faced the rat he lost his hearing.”
Hermione picks up on the first ring. Her greeting a little hesitant. Draco hates that he’s made her unsure of their friendship.
I miss Hogwarts. It’s like I have a constant stomach-ache, that’s how much I miss it. I miss the castle, the secret passageways and ghosts, the classes, the mail arriving by owl. Hedwig is locked up in her cage and she keeps waking uncle Vernon in the early morning because she’s bored and makes loud hooting noises. We have an argument about it almost every morning. And yesterday on my birthday I accidentally said ‘you’ve forgotten the magic word’ when Dudley told me to pass the frying pan and the room exploded. Dudley fell off his chair, aunt Petunia screamed and uncle Vernon jumped to his feet and roared at me, telling me the M word was forbidden and that I shouldn’t threaten Dudley. But all I meant was please. I just wanted Dudley to say please.
Hermione closes her book again and nods. “I know,” she says. “This idea of going after him is silly. And dangerous.”
‘I suck at Divination,’ Harry writes. ‘I just predict Neville’s demise all the time. That seems to cheer Trelawney up the most.’
“But he was sent to Azkaban, just after the war,” Draco says. He’s heard mixed accounts of why. Some say he was in league with the Dark Lord from the beginning. Others say he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But he killed all those Muggles. Sure he most have agreed with the Dark Lord’s views if he did that.
Back in my room I first went for my trunk to put on some clean clothes, only to discover that someone had rummaged through it. I sat down on the ground in front of it for a long time. They were gone, my notebook and the cloak. I couldn’t believe it. Not only had they beaten me half to death, they also took the only things that mattered to me. Right then I wished they really had beaten me to death. At least then it wouldn’t all hurt so much anymore.
Malfoy also makes fun of me every morning when I don’t receive any mail, reminding me that I don’t have any friends or family that care about me. He receives daily packages from his home with sweets and other treats that he shares with the others, except me of course, because I’ve not earned them.
Harry wants him to look back up. He wants to know if they can be friends again. They both miss each other. Sure they can get over the fact that Harry loves Draco. They can still be friends. Harry will keep his feelings locked up. He will do whatever Draco wants.
Draco stares at his left forearm. The Dark Mark is black and stands out from his pale skin. A tear tracks over Draco’s cheek. He should get up, take his wand and ward his room. Others might hear him cry. Or scream Harry’s name in his sleep, just before he wakes up from another nightmare. Only Draco can’t find the energy needed to get up. The only thing he can do is stare at the betrayal on his arm.
After a while, we got up and walked with Fawkes on our tails out of the chamber back towards Ron. Ron had managed to move enough rocks in the time I was gone to make a gab where Draco and I could climb through. Professor Lockhart was also still there. Ron said his memory was gone, that Lockhart had no clue who he was or where he was.
Their mom was really upset with the twins and Ron when we got there, screaming she had been worried when their beds had been empty and the car was gone. She kept on shouting until her voice was hoarse. And then she turned on me. I was afraid she would start yelling at me but she just said she was pleased to see me and offered me breakfast.
It’s then that I noticed that Professor Lupin was still there and he gave us both a big piece of chocolate. He explained that the thing we saw was a Dementor, one of the guards of Azkaban. Then he told us to eat the chocolate, said it would help, and then he left to go have a talk with the driver. Draco then told me that I had gone rigid and had almost fallen off the seat. The only reason that didn’t happen was that Draco had still been sitting on my lap. It seems that Professor Lupin had told the Dementor that none of us was hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks, and when that didn’t work he used some kind of spell to chase it away. Draco said he felt really cold like he’d never be cheerful again.
Oh, Ron is fine by the way. Hermione was able to bring him around and bring him to the hospital wing that night. They ran into the headmaster in the entrance hall and said that he had already known that I was down the trap door. That upset Draco. He said that it was terribly irresponsible from the idiot to let me go down there, I could have been killed. But I think the headmaster is a funny man, and that he wanted to give me a chance to face Voldemort. I’m sure by now that he even made sure I found out how the mirror worked so I would be prepared. That didn’t change Draco’s mind about the headmaster, he still thinks the man is off his rocker.
Harry doesn’t know if Malfoy has any friends. He always seems to be alone. But now that Harry is his friend, Ron, Neville and Hermione will soon follow. They will get along with Malfoy. And Ron and Hermione will learn. Harry doesn’t doubt that.
Harry scratches at the back of his neck. “Why are you always so positive?” he asks.
Draco looks up to see Harry’s face. His eyes are closed and he bites onto his bottom lip. He looks so vulnerable and hurt. Draco knows this is truly the start of the end. He’d hoped it would take longer. He thought he would have more time with Harry. But he should start facing the truth. This will end soon, Harry will leave, and Draco will just have to find a way to deal with it. Maybe he should look up his dealer, see if he can still supply Draco with the potions he needs to get by once Harry says his final goodbye.
Malfoy stops and turns to look at Harry. “You called me Draco,” he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lily rolls her eyes. “Look, Harry, I know you aren’t together. I just don’t think Draco wants to spend the entire week on a mattress on the floor. He’ll be more comfortable on a bed. So he’ll be staying in the guest room.”
Wednesday 1 January 1992
Harry closes the book and makes his way to their usual table. Malfoy will be there, and Harry wants to show him this book. And tell him that they can go and practice BSL in the DADA classroom. Uncle Remus told Harry they could use it as a place to practice. That way, nobody will be able to see what Malfoy and he are up to.
“We can ask Dumbledore if the order can help, get her out of there,” Harry tries again.
Harry sits up a little straighter and shakes his head. “You didn’t listen to one-word healer Burke said yesterday, did you?”
“I am now,” Harry answers. “Is Malfoy all right? Were you on time?”
Draco takes Teddy-bear and holds it close. “Thank you,” he whispers.
“Uncle Sirius can take care of himself,” Neville says. His hands are squeezed into fists and they tremble. Harry looks him in the eyes and nods. How could Harry have forgotten all about Pettigrew? His mind has been so full of Malfoy and his need to help him that he’d forgotten the threat that is still out there.
Harry raises his hands. “Sorry I almost died and wasn’t able to win the game.”
People stare at Harry as he walks through the common room. Whispers follow him when he makes his way down to the Great Hall. Heads turn when he sits down next to his friends. Harry ignores them and grabs some sausages and toast. With dread, he looks towards the Slytherin table.
I was surprised to hear Hermione take the blame for it all, saying that she went out to look for the troll and that we had all come to save her. I had never heard her tell a lie in all the time I had known her. And then professor McGonagall took five points from Gryffindor, but she awarded the rest of us each five points for defeating the troll. I was proud that I had finally won my house some points. And then she told us to go to our dormitories, where the rest of the students were finishing their feast. It was hard walking to the dungeons by myself, knowing my friends were going up together to the Gryffindor common room to celebrate.
“At least I didn’t make us lose an important Quidditch match,” James says.
Draco is sure that there should be an easier way for all this. But the other healer from last week assured them that using magic is just too dangerous at this stage of the pregnancy, that the Muggle way is safer and just as efficient. Draco thinks it’s barbaric. The way they shove a plastic rod into his ass so they can make an echo as they call it. But he knows it has to be done, so he lays down on the bed. Harry stands up and takes his hand in his. They look at each other when the healer inserts the rod. Draco can’t stop the tears when he feels the intrusion into his body. He still doesn’t get why he has to go through this again. His baby is already dead, what is the point in torturing him with another scan and the small hope that it was all a mistake and his baby is still alive and healthy.
“Cool,” Ron says.
“You thought she died?” Neville asks. “Why would you think that?”
“Shut up, dad,” he says. “He’s not like me.”
Draco agrees and then gets up when James and Madam Pomfrey step out of her office again.
Draco pours himself another glass of wine. Pansy’s glass is still mostly full. It’s like she’s not drinking at all.
“You’re at the wrong table, Gryffindorf,” someone yells at Harry. Harry looks up from his breakfast and spots Parkinson and Nott some seats away from them.
“Shut up, Ron,” Harry and Neville say at the same time.
I know it was only yesterday that I wrote to you, but I really need to tell you what happened last night after I went to find Draco. So much has changed in so little time, I don’t even know where to start. Draco is looking over my shoulder and says I should just start at the beginning, with me finding him and Hermione in the Entrance Hall, so I’m going to do just that.
Draco is silent. Not like his usual silence because he doesn’t talk. And that is another thing that keeps Harry’s mind occupied. He still doesn’t know if Draco can talk, or even make sounds. He read in a book that sometimes children get born deaf and mute, but the lack of sounds can also be because they can’t hear and they just never learn to make sounds in the way others do. It doesn’t matter, of course. He and Draco have been communicating just fine without using spoken words. They sign more and more, as Draco is improving quickly. And when signs don’t work, they write stuff down. It’s how Harry learnt that Draco has good humour, and also takes his studies more seriously than anyone else Harry knows. Even more seriously than Hermione, and Harry never thought that was possible. The lack of sounds is not an issue.
Harry James Potter
“It’s for school. We drew a farm today, and I had blue cows. But Olivia said that cows can’t be blue,” Teddy explains.
‘Nobody told me he was a Black. And he’d been kicked out of the family,’ Draco writes.
But back to the prediction. We had to go and drink tea and then read each other's tea dregs. I first took a look at Draco’s, which told us he was going to suffer but be very happy about it. He joked that it was always a hardship to be with me, that I made him suffer every minute I wasn’t around, but that he never been this happy in his entire life, so it was all good. Hermione told us to stop being gross, that not everyone wants to know about our sappy love life.
“Yes, they did,” Neville says. “But they aren’t registered. And they can get in a lot of trouble if that comes out.” And that is putting it lightly. Both James and Sirius work for the Ministry. If it becomes public knowledge that they have been in violation of the law since they were fifteen years old, they probably lose their jobs and can get sent to jail.
The next morning Draco was already up and out in the Great Hall having breakfast by the time I got out of bed. I dressed quickly and went to find him. He was sitting with Pansy and Daphne on either side of him like he was making sure I couldn’t sit down next to him. I walked up to him and greeted him, but he didn’t respond at all, didn’t even look at me. I begged him to please talk to me, but he wouldn’t. Nott was grinning on the other side of the table. He most think it’s really funny that Draco is ignoring me. When it was clear he wouldn’t speak to me I just walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to Hermione to have my breakfast.
The first day back to class was hard. It seems like everyone knows what I did and Nott and Crabbe make fun of it every chance they get. Draco told them to shut up, but they don’t really listen to him. I told him it’s okay, but Draco gets upset when people talk about what I did. I think I scared him and I feel bad about that. I never thought he would care about what happened to me. I hate that his father had forbidden him from even looking at me the wrong way.
“Just because we figured out that he’s deaf, doesn’t mean we have to become his friend,” Neville says. Harry opens his mouth to respond but Neville is quicker. “Who am I kidding? You wouldn’t be Harry Potter if you would let this go.”
Neville laughs. “They are more like them than they realise,” he says. “Did you hear Ron talking in his sleep last night?”
“Don’t think you are getting off that easy,” Angela spits at him. But she seems to forgive him anyway, as she leans down and places a kiss on his lips before she walks away.
Harry is leaving because he loves Draco. Because Draco has shut him out, pushed him away instead of letting him help. He pushed everyone away. Blaise and Greg, who have been trying to get in touch with him for months. He destroyed his friendship with Pansy, let her down when she needed him. Draco has let it all fall apart, only because he couldn’t see. They love him and don’t want to leave. It’s just that Draco gives them no other choice.
The Easter holiday didn’t feel like a holiday at all. We had so much homework we spend most of our time in the library studying. And when we weren’t studying, Draco and I had Quidditch practise. Hermione seemed to live in the library. She was always already there when Draco and I would finally get out of bed. And she never left before us. I think she was close to tears most of the time. I tried talking to her about her workload, but she just snapped at me and told me to leave her alone.
Harry and Neville both laugh and then place their hands flat on their desks. Remus shakes his head with a smile on his face. He must know that Neville and Harry won’t be stupid enough to try and communicate with signs on their DADA exam, with their uncle who signs supervising. They did get away with it during the History of Magic exam. Hermione was outraged when she spotted them and told them off afterwards. Even threatened to tell Professor Binns, until she realised the man wouldn’t care either way. And at least this way, Harry won’t have a failing grade on the most boring subject ever.
Neville leans against the small fence at the edge of the path. Harry stops next to him and they both stare at the Shrieking Shack. Hermione was all excited to go see it, as it’s believed to be haunted. Harry and Neville both know better. They’ve heard the stories a million times. About how Uncle Remus needed a place to hide during the full moons when he was a student at Hogwarts. Maybe they should tell Ron. He hasn’t said a word on the way here. He looks around them and keeps a safe distance from the fence. Or maybe Ron shouldn’t be so silly and stop believing in haunted buildings and ghosts that are out to get you. He’s an idiot to believe a word from his brothers Fred and George. He should stop taking them so seriously.
In the end, I had a great time during the dance, dancing with Draco and enjoying the company of our friends and I was a little sad when it was over and we had to go back to our dormitories and go to sleep. I told Draco I wanted to dance more often with him, that I liked it. Draco said he liked it too just before he drifted off to sleep.
“We know,” Hermione says. “We’ll come up with something. Just let us all think about it for a while.”
When Headmaster Dumbledore was done questioning Barty Crouch, he asked Professor McGonagall and Tonks to escort him out of the hospital wing. And once they were gone, the headmaster woke up Sirius. He told us it was better to let Draco sleep. So that when Harry was ready, he could tell Draco all he wanted too in his own time and own pace. But now the headmaster wanted me to set aside the pain and confusion and try to remember as much as possible. Sirius was all protective of me, asked if we could leave it till morning, let me first have a good sleep. But the headmaster said it couldn’t wait. So I set out to tell as much as I could remember.
Nobody will sit next to Draco tonight. He’ll cry all alone for losing his first love. A love he wasn’t allowed to have, a love that was worth losing everything.
“What did she mean by that?” Ron asks.
Draco smiled and looked back at the potion. He would have loved to have seen how the potion works. For a moment he was tempted to get a spoon and feed it to the man in the cell. But then his father and mother would know he’d been down into the forbidden rooms. Draco let it be and made sure he would follow his father down when he would continue his work.
Draco slams his wine on the table and gets up. His hands are shaking, and the tears are threatening to slip from his eyes. “What the fuck do you know,” he spits out. He turns towards the front door. It’s always the same with Blaise. Ever since Draco told him he hated how little Blaise seemed to care after the war, Blaise thinks he can put his nose into every small aspect of Draco’s life so that he can see how imperfect it is, compared to his own. All is good and well in the world as long as Blaise is better off then everyone around him.
“I think it’s perfect,” Draco says from behind Harry. Harry turns around and smiles at Draco. “As we are blessed to have her in our lives. Even if it was hell to have her,” Draco continues.
Thursday 5 Augustus 1993
We all ended up at the side of the lake lying around the grass underneath a tree. Ron was stretched out on the grass, while Hermione was sitting next to him, holding his hand. Neville lay belly down next to Ron and I was on my back next to him. I looked sideways at Draco who was sitting against the tree with Blaise next to him. Hermione was going over the exam, questioning all her answers and Draco was joining in with her. They both liked to go through the exam papers afterwards and compare answers. It was good seeing them all enjoy themselves and getting along. I know we all still get weird looks when we hang out as a group, Slytherin’s and Gryffindor’s together because we are supposed to be reviling houses, but none of us seems to care, so that’s fine. Even Ron and Draco seem to get along these days.
The last lesson of today was History of Magic. It’s being taught by a ghost, Professor Binns. He drones on and on and it’s difficult to keep all the names in order. I think it will be easier to learn it all by reading the book.
Ron opens his mouth the answer, only the door to the Great Hall opens before he gets a chance.
I forced myself to snap out of it and wake up completely. I moved up so quickly it made me a little dizzy, but I had to tell them. They couldn’t take away my godfather, the only real family I only just found. I also tried to convince the Minister, but he wouldn’t listen to us. In the meantime, Madame Pomfrey tries us all to eat chocolate and kept saying we needed rest. I screamed and fought against them, which woke up Hermione who tells the men the same story they’d just heard from me. But the Minister still wouldn’t believe us. I screamed at him that he had the wrong man, that Black was innocent. The Minister kept saying that we were confounded. Snape did say he wasn’t so sure, that we might be telling the trued, but that there was, unfortunately, no way in knowing. Draco asked for his wand again, but both the Minister and Snape didn’t pay him any attention because I was yelling at the Minister and Madam Pomfrey was ordering the professor and the Minister to leave, that her patients needed rest.
The compartment door opens and Neville steps in. “It’s Professor Lupin, now,” he says when he sits down next to Harry. “And yes, Iris is fine. She’s with her friends and doesn’t want us to bother her. Her exact words were ‘I don’t need you two to look out for me, so stop bothering me.’”
That was the moment Sirius seemed to realise that Draco was here. He pointed his finger at him and told him that they would have a word about how Draco deflowered James son. Draco turned pink and said that James and Lily already know, that I had already told you in my letters. Sirius smiled at that, saying he might be wrong about Draco too, but that he still didn’t like the thought of us having sex at this young age.
If there was only a way to stop hurting. A way to stop the thoughts in his head to spin, to prevent them from breaking him apart. If only he could forget again.
“It’s okay, Draco,” Hermione says. Her hand rests on Draco’s shoulder. Draco thinks he should look at her, but he can’t take his eyes off the baby in his hands.
Harry makes the same fist again, but this time shakes it a little, just as you would shake your head. Malfoy copies the movement.
Harry’s heart stops. He just died in the library and this is heaven. He goes completely still with his arms hanging loosely at his sides.
“Vincent,” Harry answers. Draco swallows and blinks away a tear. It has been years, but the pain of losing Vincent still stings. Just another person that lost their life because of Draco’s misguided actions. If only Draco had been a better friend. Or even better, just let the boy be. All he ever used him for were his muscles. And only when Vincent was gone for good, Draco realised he’d just tried to make Draco proud of him. That all Vincent ever wanted was to be a real friend to Draco.
They didn’t see the Mudblood die, but they heard it. She hadn’t screamed in days, so broken by all the Crucio spells directed at her. But when the potion hit her body she screamed for days. Potter cried and whimpered in his corner. Draco moved close to him and hold him, the days he would enjoy listening to people die a distant memory. He realised that he would have to live in a world ruled by the Dark Lord until the day he died. He was the last of his name, the heir to the Malfoy bloodline. There was no doubt in his mind they would use him to force an heir out of him before he would perish like his mother.
Draco found comfort in confiding to a ghost, the crazy Moaning Myrtle, about his fears and struggles. He didn’t want his mother to suffer for days before she would pass away, or even be the reason she would die. His father would never forgive him.
I’ve also been to my first Quidditch match ever. It was Gryffindor against Slytherin and I wasn’t sure who I was supposed to be supporting. I’m a Slytherin, but all my friends are in Gryffindor. And these days I take all my meals at their table. But I decided to wear my green jumper because I do want my house to win. Hermione said that was a good thing, but Ron disagreed. They always seem to disagree about everything, but that doesn’t seem to stop all the sweet smiles they give each other. It’s a bit weird that they are dating now, I’m just glad Hermione still has time to spend with me and that she doesn’t feel like she needs to spend all her free time with Ron.
Only Harry doesn't comply. He slides out of Draco and lays down next to him. His hand strokes Draco's back again, only not like before when he was admiring Draco's body. Now it's a gentle stroke, filled with compassion and love. A stroke that Draco doesn’t deserve.
The hallway of this carriage isn’t empty. At the other end, Malfoy just steps out of one of the bathrooms. He looks at Harry and his friends without moving. Harry shakes his head and looks in the first compartment. His sister isn’t there either.
Harry looks at his hands that still hold his lemonade glass. The drink hardly touched. “I don’t think he wants to date me,” he says. Tears build up in the corner of Harry’s eyes. He tries to blink them away. He’s shed enough tears over Draco.
“How long before Harry comes home?” Teddy asks. It snaps Draco out of his thoughts. He looks up and hopes he doesn’t have tears in his eyes. The last thing he wants to do is upset Teddy.
“Yeah, sorry,” Ron says in a softer volume. He bends over the table again so they can whisper. “But a werewolf teaching? That’s asking for problems.”
My first class was potions from Professor Snape. He’s our head of house, but I don’t think he likes me very much. I think he hates me, just like all the other Slytherins. When he took the roll call he made fun of me. Off course that made Malfoy and his friends snigger behind their hands. He asked me questions about mixing ingredients and where I could find a bezoar. I didn’t know the answers. He kept saying fame isn’t everything. Me not knowing made Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and Nott laugh out loud in class. And there was a Gryffindor girl that kept raising her hand, making Ron roll his eyes at me. Snape took points from Slytherin because I didn’t know the answer, and later he took points because me potion wasn’t good enough. Not as much as he took from the Gryffindor’s, he seems to hate them more than he hates me.
Not long after that, Draco’s father and mother arrived. They took places just behind me and Draco. Draco hugged his mother shortly and said a formal hello to his father. I also greeted them, in the hope that one day they would consider me worthy enough for their son. At that moment I understood why Draco was trying so hard when it came to Sirius. I know Draco kind of hates his father at the moment, but he’s still his father and I want him to like me. Not that Sirius was any help with that. He and Lucius greeted each other with a look of dismay. Draco’s mother made a little more effort and said it was nice to see Sirius again. She did the same with Mr Tonks and she introduced herself to Tonks, saying it was good to finally meet her. Tonks just nodded and turned back around in her seat, not interested in her aunt at all. She later told Draco she’s glad he’s not as narrow-minded as his parents. I know Draco struggled with this, he really loves his mother and I agree with him, she’s lovely. She really helped me last year when I had run away from the Dursleys.
Harry James Potter.
“He attacked Neville?” Harry shouts at them.
“You want to tell me about him?” Narcissa asks. Her hand rests on Draco’s side. It’s comforts Draco, and frightens him at the same time. Everything is just so messed up. And Draco has no idea how to fix it.
Draco and Hermione were in the Entrance Hall. They had received a note from Hagrid about the appeal of Buckbeak. He’d lost and Buckbeak was to be executed at sunset. We all agreed we should go and see him, but I’d left my invisibility cloak in the passageway under the one-eyed witch when Nott and Crabbe saw me in Hogsmeade and I hadn’t been able to retrieve it. Draco and I both made sure neither professor Snape nor professor Lupin saw us anywhere near it, knowing we would be in big trouble if they did. So Hermione went to retrieve the cloak while Draco and I joint our friends for dinner.
“Harry, if he can get in, we need to know how to defend ourselves,” Hermione whispers.
“No,” Harry says. He shakes his head and his mouth falls open.
“How much information about werewolves did you find?” Ron asks.
Love you both,
Harry looks up from the parchment and sees as Malfoy bites down on his bottom lip and stares past Harry. It’s heart-breaking and Harry again wishes he could just reach out and take Malfoy’s hand in his.
I had to stay another week in the hospital wing but was allowed to see more people. Ron and Neville came by in between classes and told me that Nott and Malfoy aren’t talking to each other. Malfoy even attacked Nott the day after I was beaten. I really don’t get what is going on with Malfoy. It sounds like he cares about what happened to me, but that can’t be, can it?
Harry looks at their friends again. Ron seems to be losing. He’s covered with snow. Malfoy seems to be able to dodge most snowballs. His coat is still mostly black. His cheeks are flushed. He’s beautiful. Harry swallows as his hand moves up to touch his lips.
“Hey little monster,” Draco says as he takes the boy from his mother and holds him close. “Have you missed me?” he asks. Vincent nods and then rest his head against Draco’s shoulder and almost falls asleep instantly.
‘Your dad is going to be delighted to know you’re not dead,’ Malfoy writes.
But me losing points didn’t go well with my Slytherin classmates. They shoved me into the wall when we were walking to our next class. Malfoy said that he would hex me in my sleep if I manage to lose even more points for our house.
Draco pulls Harry closer towards him and then lays his chin on Harry’s shoulder. “Thank you,” he says.
After a while, we walked up to a large shed snake skin that was from a beast at least twenty feet long. Ron and I were examining it when Professor Lockhart made a grab for Ron’s wand and tried to obliviate us again. But Ron’s wand was still broken from our little crash into the Weeping Willow, and it backfired. The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. I slipped over the coils of snakeskin to get out of the way when great chunks of tunnel ceiling came thundering to the floor.
“Fuck no, I don’t want to start my new year at the place that scarred me for life,” Draco says. He hands some glasses to Ron, takes one for himself and pulls a bottle out of Hermione’s hand. He walks out of the kitchen and back to the living room where the rest of the party is booming.
Harry looks at Malfoy who has put down his coffee. His hands rest on his desk and his mouth has become a thin line.
“Draco, I don’t care that you are a homosexual. There have been others like you. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. But that doesn’t mean you can’t marry and produce an heir. I’m sure we can find you a wife who won’t mind that you have lovers on the side,” Narcissa says.
“None of your business, brother. Just like it’s none of Angela’s business if it’s true or not,” George answers.
“Do you want us to take you with us to the party, or should I take you home?” Luna asks. Draco is glad she doesn’t ask why he’s here, broken down on the side of a street.
And yes, I haven’t been sleeping all that well. I keep having dreams of Draco walking away from me and then falling over the castle walls. I run to the edge and when I look over the bannister he’s gone. I don’t know what it means, or why I keep having this dream, but it wakes me up sweating all the time. After that, I never can get back to sleep. I just stare at Draco’s drapes, hoping he’s still sleeping behind them. And I want to open his drapes and crawl into bed with him. Just to hold him and make sure he’s really there. I know it’s stupid since it’s clear he doesn’t care about me.
Merlin beards, does Malfoy truly believe that it was normal to hide his condition? The hatred of his father and Uncle Sirius towards the Malfoy family starts to make sense. Because this is wrong.
Harry reaches out and takes Neville’s hand in his. “Nobody does,” he says. Not compared to what must be going through Neville’s mind when he thinks of Pettigrew. That man cost him his parents. That is nothing compared to the bother the girlish squad gives them. Harry is sick of them anyway. They always try to hit on him. Don’t they get that he’s never going to like them? Who would want to date a girl anyway? They are only trouble. Just see how difficult Hermione can be from time to time. And she’s the most normal girl Harry knows.
“I forgot about the werewolf things,” Ron says. “Do you think professor Lupin will be disappointed in me for not getting that right?”
“Who’s winning?” Ginny asks as she drops down next to Harry.
“I’m fine,” Draco snaps. “Just hungry. It’s been a long day.”
“I remember,” Harry says.
Harry leans over Draco and searches the map. Who did Neville see? It can only be one person. Is he here? In the castle?
“Okay, can we watch a movie when I’m back here?” Teddy asks.
After that, we lowered the egg in the water and opened it there. Now it wasn’t wailing, but a gurgling song was coming out of it. Draco and I both took a deep breath and slid under the surface. We listened to the song and then went up to take a breath. The song goes like this:
Draco shakes his head and then pulls his reusable parchment from under his books. He starts to scribble and Harry waits. When the paper is pushed into his hands, he can’t help but laugh.
At that moment I stumbled backwards. Voldemort told me not to be a fool, saying I should join him, so I won’t have to die like you. He said you both died begging for mercy, but I know he was lying. He said he valued my bravery. And that you died trying to protect me. And that I should give him the stone unless I wanted you to have died in vain, mom. But I told him I would never. If you two could stand up to him, then so could I.
The end of the school year was otherwise one big feast. I’d passed all my classes, just like all my friends. Even Greg passed everything. Daphne gave him a kiss because she was proud of him. They are dating now. Hermione said we Slytherins are becoming one big romantic clubhouse, with me with Draco, Blaise dating Luna Lovegood and now Daphne and Greg dating too. I think she’s just a little jealous and that she wants to date Ron again, but she’s too proud to step over what happened last year.
For charms, we have professor Flitwick. He’s a tiny little wizard who stands on a pile of books to see over his desk. When he reached my name during roll call he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Malfoy and his friends laughed and made jokes about me wooing the teachers. I really hate Malfoy, I really hate him. I don’t understand why he needs to be so mean to me. It’s not like I ever did anything to him.
“Just dizzy,” Harry answers as he opens his eyes again. He looks at Draco, sitting next to his bed. Draco is pale. Well, he’s always pale, but now he’s even paler. He has his hands clasped together on his lap and Harry wants to reach out and hold them. He wants to assure Draco that he’s all right.
“Yes, it is. But we can’t change that,” Remus says. “The only thing we can do is try to help. By giving Malfoy a choice, not by forcing him to do anything. No matter how badly you want to help him.”
Harry chuckles. “It’s not as if he can hear you,” he jokes. And that is the worst part of all. By Harry’s silly action, Draco hasn’t just lost one friend. He’s lost four. He must hate Harry for doing this to him.
"I’m sorry, I'm just tired," Draco says. It’s a lie, but it seems to work. Harry turns back towards Draco and gives him a sweet kiss. Draco shuts his eyes when Harry’s soft kisses travel over his back and down to his hole. Harry's hand's massage Draco's buttocks. Draco remembers the times this used to turn him on, how wonderful it was to be worshipped by Harry. Now he hates every second of it. It all feels so useless. Draco knows it's never going to work, he's never going to get pregnant again. But still, he can't stop initiating it. He needs to keep trying. It's the only way to keep Harry by his side.
The Knight Bus doesn’t have normal seats, instead, it’s filled with half a dozen brass bedsteads. Once I set down on mine the bus took off with another loud bang. It threw me back flat on my bed because of the speed of the bus. I felt really nervous on the bus. The driver, Ernie wasn’t a very good one. We kept mounting the pavement, only the bus didn’t hit anything. Everything jumped out of the way of the bus as it approached and back into position once it had passed.
“This is me,” Draco says. He needs Harry to know that this is a part of Draco that will never entirely leave him. He’s in pain and wants to hide. Even if he gets help and finds a way to battle his demons. But he will try, he will go to a mind healer and try not to push everyone away.
“I think we’re going to go home now,” Harry says without taking his eyes of Draco.
Love you both,
Harry James Potter.
We walked on in silence again after that. The path became almost impossible to follow and the blood seemed to be getting thicker. And when we reached a clearing I could see something bright white gleaming on the ground. We inched closer and saw that it was the unicorn. It was already dead, but it was still beautiful. I took a step toward it and then we heard the slithering sound again. We both froze on the spot and looked to the spot where the sound had come from. A hooded figure came crawling across the ground and started to drink the unicorn’s blood. Draco screamed, it was a terrible sound and I turned quickly to look at him. He was as white as a ghost and he reached out his arm to grab my hand and started pulling me away from the clearing. Before we started running I looked back and saw that the hooded figure had raised its head and was looking right at me. A horrible pain pierced my head then like my scar was on fire. I staggered a little until Draco pulled on my hand, making me turn back to him and we ran.
Harry was rushed to St. Mungo’s after the accident. He’d survived the fall. He had still been alive, is still alive now. The world seems to balance between hope and desperation. Draco wonders if he should come clean. What if Harry pulls through? Draco wants to be by Harry’s side when he wakes up. On one side Draco is ready to let the world know he’d switched sides in this coming war. He is done being the person his father wants him to be. And with Harry by his side, Draco will be able to do it. But what if Harry still dies? Draco will have given himself away. He will be stuck on the losing side of the war. Not that he cares. Dead will be a relief, a better alternative than moving on without Harry. If only Draco could be sure that his mother would be safe. She is the only one he still has. The only other person worth saving.
And then he gave me the best present I’ve ever gotten. It is a handsome, leather-covered book and it’s filled with wizard photographs of you, mom and dad. Hagrid had sent owls to all your old school friends asking for photos because he knew I hadn’t any. I couldn’t speak when he gave it to me. It really is the best present ever. So, I just hugged Hagrid in thanks.
Draco walks past a confused Andromeda, she opens her mouth to say something, and Draco just shakes his head. He walks on the side of the road that will lead him to the small town close to Andromeda’s cottage. Tears stream over his face and his hands shake next to his body. He’s about halfway to town when his legs start to protest, and Draco kneels on the moist ground.
“If it gets too bad, write me about it, and I’ll come and rescue you,” Harry signs.
“I’m dreading the Christmas dinner,” Draco answers Harry’s question. It’s only half an answer, but it’s all he’s willing to let go. “They are a lot.”
Draco stops in front of the picture of Lupin and Tonks. Teddy puts his small hand next to them and smiles at them. “Hi, mom and dad. I’m going to be a big brother,” he tells the picture. “Can’t stay, uncle Harry is making grilled cheese sandwishes.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says again. A bit louder now and with more confidence. He’s genuinely sorry. “For all of it, the baby. I’m sorry I couldn’t keep him safe. I’m sorry I’ve destroyed our chance to be happy. You’ll be better off without me. You and Teddy both.”
Hagrid opened the archway to Diagon Alley after that. It was amazing. The stones of the wall just disappeared and made an archway. There were shops everywhere, with cauldrons, owls, broomsticks, robes and telescopes. I’ve never seen anything like it and I wanted to go to all the shops at once.
“You’re quiet,” Draco says.
Harry looks at Draco. It’s strange how they can communicate without the need for words. Harry just nods and then turns to Teddy, asks him if he would like to have an extra-long bath tonight.
Harry James Potter.
Draco made it his mission to become just as skilled at potions as his father, hoping to one day join him in his efforts to finding the perfect potion to end a Muggles life. One that would inflict pain and suffering on the useless beings. If only he could get into the restricted section in the library. Draco was sure he would be able to learn tons about poisonous potions from those books.
We ran back to the castle after our little talk with Hagrid and even though I had said to myself that I wouldn’t meddle in anything anymore, this was my life we were talking about, so I decided it was time to tell headmaster Dumbledore. But none of us knew where his office was. And when I wanted to suggest we would go down the trap door I was interrupted by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a large pile of books. She asked what the three of us were doing inside. Hermione told her we needed to see headmaster Dumbledore, only to find out that he left ten minutes ago to London.
When Harry finally finishes his plate, he and his friends get up to go and get some fresh air. Harry isn’t sure he wants to join them, but he also doesn’t want to be alone. But then he spots Draco in the hallway. Their eyes meet and Harry rushes forward. Only Draco shakes his head and then hurries away. Harry doesn’t hesitate and runs after him. It isn’t until he can take a hold of Draco’s arm that Draco stops and turns to face him.
Ron turns and takes a handful of snow. Hermione tries to hide behind Draco, who makes sure he gets out of the way when the snowball flies towards them. Only Hermione believes he’s the perfect shield and it doesn’t take long before one of the snowballs lands on his chest. Draco looks at Ron with a gaping mouth and then looks at his chest where the snow colours his black coat grey. And then he ducks to the ground and makes the perfect snowball and aims it at Ron for revenge.
Dear mom and dad,
The piano has to go too. There is no way Harry can keep it. Not after all the nights he found Draco sitting in front of it, his hands on the keys producing the most amazing sounds. Harry could sit at his desk all night, trying to get work done, but being mesmerised by Draco’s singing voice. A voice Harry will never hear again.
Harry nods, forgetting that Ron can't see him. He wants to believe Ron, wants him to be right. But the empty look on Draco's face, his pale complexion, and the way he's distancing himself from everyone, even Harry. It's so similar to sixth year, the year Draco started to abuse potions, it scares Harry.
Draco lifts his lips and kisses Harry’s skin. “We’ll be together forever,” he whispers. “It won’t hurt, I promise. And I’ll be here when you wake up.” He puts his mouth over the wounds again and drinks more of Harry’s blood.
“Ron and Hermione won’t care,” Neville says when Harry looks at their friends. “Ron’s brother is gay and that never seemed to be an issue. And Hermione is all for minority rights, so she can’t be against gay people, can she?” Neville says.
Harry stares at Draco. At his soft smile. His grey eyes and blond hair. He’s so beautiful. And so strong and brave for facing all his struggles alone for so long. Harry never wants Draco to be alone again.
This is when Draco remembered that Voldemort had summoned his followers, and he asked if his father had been there. I just nodded, I didn’t want to tell him how his father had spoken about Draco. Greg didn’t need to be told, he just said that his father would have come too. Then Millicent said she was sure her dad would too. And then Neville did the most amazing thing, he said that didn’t matter, as long as they all knew what was important, and that if they needed, they could all come to stay at his place to stay safe. And that is how I know I have the best of friends, and that even if things will take a turn for the worse now, I’m not alone. None of us is.
“Ginny, can you stay a little longer,” Harry asks. He pushes a hand through his hair and rubs the back of his neck. Ginny should also hear what he wants to say. He’s been putting it off all morning.
The next day Ron complained that Fitch had made him buff up the Quidditch Cup fourteen times. And then he had another slug attack all over a special Award for Services to the School. It took ages to take the slime off.
“You’re staring again, dear,” Lily whispers in Harry’s ear.
They all left, leaving me alone with Professor Snape, who then escorted me to the Slytherin dungeon. Before he left me there he assured me that Hermione will be okay as soon as the Mandrakes were mature enough. But how long will that still take? And what if something goes wrong with the potion? Or what if someone would damage or destroy the Mandrakes? I would still be all alone.
And I didn’t really have the strength to do so after the final curse that Moody showed us. The last and worst, Avada Kedavra, the Killing Curse, was performed right in front of us. There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound. Instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but dead. I just looked at the spider, remembering the green lights in my nightmares, the screams of you mother to plead for my life. I heard that Moody said that I was the only one to ever survive it and Draco took my hand in his, made me unclench my fists and stroked his thumb over my hand. I was aware that everyone had turned around to look at me, but all I could think about was that this is how you died. Had you been unmarked too? Was all you had seen a flash of green light and did you only hear a rush of speeding death before all life was wiped from your bodies?
“I’m not spending one more minute in my books,” Neville says.
Oh, and I haven’t even told you about Professor Lupin and his amazing classes. We had him for one hour on our first day, in which he introduced himself and went over subjects we had to learn last year to refresh our minds. And on Friday we had a double lesson at the end of the day. He told us all to put our books back into our bags because we had a practical lesson. We have a lot of those during DADA, it’s amazing, I’m learning so much. But that first double period was kind of hard and not so much fun.
The man looked up at Draco. His cheeks were hollow like he hadn’t eaten in days. His lips were cracked and dry and his eyes were bloodshot from tears shat.
“Why?” Draco asks. He just doesn’t understand.
“Courting?” Harry echoes.
Well, at least I now know what I’m supposed to do for the second task. Not that we have any idea how I’m going to do it. But we still have a couple of weeks before the task, and Hermione and Draco are sure we will find a way for me to breath underwater.
Malfoy’s eyes scan over the note. Harry can’t stop watching them move. The thunderstorm in them calms down a little as Malfoy goes over the note a second time. Harry doesn’t look away until Malfoy hits him on his head.
“They are your favourite,” Draco stutters. Draco never stutters. He’s always sure of himself, composed and calculated.
Dobby went on to say he knew I triumphed over the Dark Lord twice, the last time only a few weeks ago. And when I confirmed, he said I was valiant and bold, but that Dobby has come to protect me, to warm me that I must not go back to Hogwarts. Well, that isn’t an option. So I told Dobby that I have to go back. I don’t belong here in the muggle world, I belong in the wizarding world, at Hogwarts. The only thing that kept me going for the last weeks is the knowledge that I’ll be going back there on the first of September.
And then I saw the shadow on the hedges moving towards Cedric. Cedric hadn’t seen it, so I shouted to warn him. Cedric turned and could get out of the way just in time not to get hit by a giant spider. But he fell and lost his wand. The spider was going to eat him, so I swing spells at it to make it stop. Only it didn’t do much good, expect set the spider after me. I couldn’t stop it from reaching me and lifting me from the ground. I tried to kick it, but instead only hurt myself when my leg touched its pincer. The pain was horrible. I think I could lose by shouting Expelliarmus, but I’m not sure anymore. I fell to the ground and landed on my hurt leg. This was bad. I could feel the bone giving way and I couldn’t stay upright. Cedric and I both through a spell at the spider at the same time, and that finally stopped it.
But surely James would have told them. It’s important information to catch Pettigrew. But they still haven’t. And now Harry keeps dreaming about the man. He sees him over and over again in his sleep. And he’s always too late to stop him from killing the others.
Later that night, Draco told me why Neville had been so upset and why Moody had mentioned Draco’s aunt. His mother’s oldest sister is in Azkaban for torturing Neville his parents, and her favourite curse to use was the Cruciatus. Draco isn’t sure what happened to Neville’s parents, but we all know that he’s being raised by his grandmother, so it can’t be anything good. Draco told me that his aunt Bella and uncle Rodolphus were loyal followers of the Dark Lord. That they still are if he has to believe the stories his father told him when he was younger.
* * *
It’s then that Theo Nott walked up to me and Ginny, saying nasty things about me like I must enjoy the attention because I’m bent. And then Ginny spoke for the first time in my presence. She told Nott to shut up. Nott laughed at her, saying she’s wasting her time trying to become my girlfriend, that it was not girls I was into. Ron and Hermione had made their way up to us by then, so they heard his statement. Ron told Nott to check his facts, while Hermione pulled on his arm trying to make him stop. I just wanted to slip out the shop unnoticed. This was so embarrassing. Why hadn’t I told Ron about my sexuality, then he wouldn’t have made a fool of himself today. He’s upset about it all and I’ve moved to Fred and George’s room for the night. Mrs Weasley said I shouldn’t worry about it, that Ron will figure out it doesn’t matter and that I’m still the same friend as yesterday when we were having fun in the paddock, just like his brother Charlie had still been the same after he told them all that he was bent. I hope she is right. I would hate to lose a good friend over this.
“Thanks,” Harry signs and then they both focus on their work again.
‘I should go,’ Draco writes.
That is when I knew I had to try to survive somehow. Even with all the odds against me, surrounded by laughing Death Eaters. (How am I going to tell Draco that his father was one of the loudest laughs among them? It will hurt him to know that his father wishes me dead.) When Voldemort gave me a breather, I ducked away and hid behind the headstone.  I could here Voldemort coming closer. He was taunting me, saying he would finish me. And deep down inside I knew there was no way for me to escape death. I cried as I made a choice. I was not going to die like a coward, hiding behind a grave. I was going to die standing proud, just like you dad. So I whisper a goodbye towards Draco and then stood up. I stumbled around the grave to face Voldemort and the end. I fired off the only spell I knew would give me a small chance of survival. My Expelliarmus left my wand at the same moment that Voldemort cast his Avada Kadava.
Harry brings a piece of sausage to his mouth. He chews on it without tasting it. Hermione leans against him for a second in comfort and then changes the subject. Plans are getting made for the day. Harry doesn’t listen to them. He just focuses on getting some food past his lips. He’s hungry, but on the other hand, he doesn’t want to eat. And all the while people keep staring at him. Is this how it always feels like for Neville? The looks and whispers are a pain, only reminding Harry how one little kiss ruined everything.
“Did you take them?” Harry asks again. He needs Draco to say it. It’s the only way he will believe him.
It had been the best day of Harry’s life. The day Draco became his husband.
Harry James Potter
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. He doesn’t know what else to say. He knows Harry is right, that they can’t expect the entire world to put their life on hold just because theirs is.
Only now the image of Draco being dead is stuck in his mind. Every time he closes his eyes, he sees it again. Draco’s blank stare. It paralyses Harry. So he just stares at the ceiling of his four-poster. Until he can’t stand the sight of it any longer. He gets up and pulls some sweatpants on. Then he pulls his cloak from his chest. He hasn’t used the thing in weeks. But tonight feels like the perfect night to wander around the castle.
Harry sighs. “What is wrong with you all?” he says. “What if mum and dad had just decided to do nothing when Uncle Sirius lost his hearing?”
“I’m not a drag,” Ron says. “I’m confused. I thought that the two of them were going to date, get married and all that stuff so Harry could become my brother. With the way they are, always so in tune with each other. It’s scary.”
‘You want to come to my place for Christmas?’ Harry writes. He places the parchment on the book Draco is reading. Draco looks up and raises his eyebrows.
After Marcus his little speech I could finally mount my Firebolt. And it was better than I’d ever dreamed. It turns with the lightest touch and seems to obey my thoughts rather than my grip. It’s so fast that the stadium turned into a green-and-grey blur. It was so easy to catch the snitch now that I had a broom this amazing. The other members of the team also seemed inspired by the presence of the Firebolt and performed their best moves faultlessly. After I got the snitch for the third time I just hovered in the air to see Draco fly and practice his moves. Because I braid his hair only at the front it still sweeps behind him when he flies and he looks so beautiful when he does. I wanted to fly up to him and jump him right then and there.
“It’s okay, Draco. We don’t both need to die today,” Harry says. Draco shakes his head and tightens his grip on Potter’s arm. He won’t let go. He can’t let go. It will be the end of everything.
“You’re freaking out in your head, aren’t you?” Neville asks.
Wednesday 19 January 1994
Draco leans in. His hand hovers above the map. Harry thinks it’s cute how excited Draco gets. It’s similar to Ron and Hermione’s reactions when they first saw the map, but somehow better. Everything with Draco is always better. Neville points at the Ravenclaw common room, where Iris hangs out with some of her friends. Luna isn’t there, so that means that Ginny won’t be either.
Draco pulls out of the kiss and stares over Harry’s shoulder. His eyes light up when he spots their friends. And maybe Harry can be kind. It’s their last day at Hogwarts. Their last trip to Hogsmeade this year. And it’s clear Draco is going to miss them all. Not just Harry. So Harry turns and waves for them to join them. They all sit in a way that Draco can see them easily and that brings a smile to Harry’s face. They’ve all adapted to Draco being deaf so quickly, and without complaints. Hermione and Ron are even learning how to sign. Hermione is making progress, but Ron is a disaster. He can’t seem to remember what he should do with his hands. Draco shakes his head and at one point even takes Ron’s hand in his to make him stop.
‘What do you mean by that?’ Harry asks. He’s not sure he wants to know the answer. Harry has heard stories from Uncle Sirius. About others who think he is now a lesser wizard and person. Is that what Malfoy has grown up with? The idea that he’s not good enough the way he is?
“Says the man that comes with a bag filled with presents,” Andromeda counters back.
Harry’s balls his fist. “You keep your filthy hands off him,” he spits.
“This isn’t funny,” Harry says to no-one in particular.
Saturday 30 April 1994
The first glass of wine they took after it happened didn’t taste as nice as it should have. Tears and broken words accompanied it. Just like the first time they got naked, and Draco buried himself deep into Harry. It had been sweet and painful. And Harry feels helpless. He doesn’t know how to comfort Draco, or even himself. Something is missing with everything they do.
When I was secured professor Quirrell turned back to a big mirror standing in the room. It was the Mirror of Erised, the one I had discovered during Christmas break. Quirrell was examining it and I tried to distract him from it by saying I had seen him and Professor Snape in the forest. Quirrell told me that professor Snape was onto him by that time and that he tried to frighten him. But that it hadn’t worked because Quirrell had Lord Voldemort on his side.
And fuck, Harry is distracted again. He’s supposed to come up with a way to find Pettigrew and stop him. He shouldn’t be contemplating his sexuality and his maybe-crush on Malfoy. The only problem is that Malfoy is on Harry’s mind. He keeps drifting back to him. And no ideas on how to find Pettigrew pop into mind. Or how to even stop him. Will Harry have to kill him? Would Harry do that to save his family? He’s never killed anyone before. It changes you. That is what James once said. That the war changed them the most because they had to kill to survive. Harry doesn’t want to change. But he also can’t have Neville or Iris in danger.
“Well, that means he isn’t a Gryffindor,” Ron says. “We all either take Herbology or Magical Creatures.”
-x-x-x-x-x-
Who’s Harry kidding? He turns in his seat and looks at Malfoy. He’s reading his book again, not paying attention to anyone around him. Harry shakes his head and looks back at Binns.
Mr Malfoy didn’t get the change to respond to Draco because a stooping man had appeared behind the counter and he focused his attention on him. I couldn’t look away from Draco, wondering why he acted so different from what I’m used to. I know he was worried about not coming first in our class, but surely his father would not buy him a new broom if he was still upset about that, would he?
“Shut up Myrtle, and let us have our moment,” Harry says. He steps away from Draco and picks up his broom. “I’ll see you on the field,” he says before he exits the bathroom. Draco stares at the door for a couple of seconds before he grabs his Quidditch robes and pulls them on. He straightens his hair again and waves at Myrtle before he leaves the bathroom and hurries down the back stairs so he can sneak back to the dungeons, get his broom and run up the stairs making it look like he’s just come from the Slytherin dormitories.
They stayed in our compartment after that and we played some exploding snaps and just talked. I told them all about the graveyard, and Draco told them he wasn’t going home, that he couldn’t as long as the Dark Lord is around. I told him to start calling him Voldemort, but Draco refuses. He says he can’t. Just like Ron can’t call him anything else but the-one-that-shall-not-be-named. Hermione is the only other person, next to the headmaster, that I know also calls him Voldemort.
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Harry shouts back. “And I’m looking. I can’t help it that Malfoy’s hair has the same shine as the Snitch.”
“I can’t,” Draco says. He opens his eyes and turns onto his back so he can see his mother. “Nobody can ever know the truth.”
“Yes,” Harry says. “I’ll try. Just don’t be surprised I turn up dead.”
Why did Pansy have to name her son, the child she never wanted anyway, Vincent? Doesn’t the bitch know that it will hurt Draco even more? Draco knows he hurt her when he turned her down in fourth year, but did she have to make it her mission to torture him for it for the rest of his life?
Harry lets out a heavy sigh. “I could be the youngest professional Quidditch player of the century,” he says without meaning it. They both know that won’t happen if he drops out of school now. He’s too young to be on the radar of any of the scouts. They won’t start paying attention to him before he takes his OWLs.
“You’re not, just tired. We all snap sometimes when we’re tired,” Harry had assured him.
“And what is that?” Harry asks. He places his free hand on the table and leans a little forward. Draco wants to pull him back into his seat, wants to tell him it’s all useless. There is no way a Muggle treatment can solve their problem. Nothing can.
“What about him?” Remus asks. His face doesn’t show anything. Harry wishes he could know what his uncle thinks. Does he suspect, just as Neville and Hermione?
Marcus really wants to win the Quidditch cup this year, since it will be his last chance to win it. It doesn’t count that he had won it already a couple of times in his younger years. He wasn’t captain back then, just a player. He’s really uptight about it. Blaming it all on bad luck, and stupid cancellation of tournaments because of some crazy snake. When he said that, Draco murmured in my ear that it was a bit more than a crazy snake. We both remember the massive Basilisk in the Chamber that had almost cost us both our lives. Of course, that made Marcus tell us off again for being a tacky couple and that we should leave all the lovely dovely stuff out of the team and focus on scoring points and catching snitches. That just made Adrian and Miles laugh, joking that Marcus wanted the impossible to happen. And we do keep the PDA down in public and during Quidditch practice, really. We both know that Derrick and Bole aren’t really a fan of the gays and we do have to play together with them. They are good beaters, well up to a good match against Fred and George of the Gryffindor team. So, Draco and I are good boys during practice and try to focus as much as possible on Quidditch and not on each other.
Pansy shakes her head. She looks at the door where Teddy and Harry disappeared and then back to her nails. Her eyes are avoiding Draco’s.
* * *
“Fuck you, Draco. I don’t want anyone else,” Harry yells. “How many times do I have to tell you? You are my family, you and Teddy. It’s the only family I want. I’m not going to find anyone else because no one can take your place.”
“That’s foolish,” Mrs Prince says. “But then again, his father was always a foolish boy.” Mrs Prince shakes her head in disapproval.
“It’s all perfectly save. All you four have to do is take this potion and you will sleep. You won’t notice anything of the tasks. And the Mermen have promised to keep you safe for the duration of the task. Nothing will come to you,” Dumbledore says.
Draco looks to the side, out of the window. He watches as some leaves fall from the tree, as they slowly wave down and out of sight.
“You think I’ve still got a chance with Draco?” Harry asks.
“Fine, go and kill yourself,” Hermione snaps. “I’m sure your foster parents will be happy to see you dead.”
“I love you both,” Draco utters before he places another kiss on top of Teddy’s head and then one on Harry’s. “But now it’s time to make lunch. I’m hungry.”
“Harry James Potter, you are charged for torturing and murdering Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Hermione says. Harry closes his eyes. He fights the tears that threaten to escape him. His voice seems lost as he opens his mouth to respond. He scrapes his throat and tries again.
We have a plan. Malfoy is going to teach me some spells that will help me defend myself when they attack me again and some spells I can use to get back at them. I’m not sure about attacking them, but Malfoy says I need to show them that I will stick up for myself, that it is the only way to make them stop. And maybe he’s right, so I will learn the jinxes and see if I’ll use them when the time is there.
In the end, it was Ron’s Niffler that had gotten the most coins and he won a large slab of Honeyduke’s chocolate. He shared the chocolate with Hermione after class. They were being all cosy and cute. No fighting or bickering at each other. And later Hermione told me that is when they got back together. It’s nice that they are a couple again. Now we just need to find a date for Neville (Luna thinks Dean would be perfect for him if he would just realise that I’m out of his reach for eternity) and Millicent and we’d all be paired up. Nobody joked about them getting together, even though they haven’t come out officially, we all know that they are both gay. Some other students do think they are a couple too, just because they are the only two single people in our group of friends.
“Then why are you leaving me alone? What other reason is there to let me go if it’s not because you hate me?” Draco shivers. He’s thought it a million times and saying it out loud makes it even more real. Harry must hate him. There is no other way this can end.
Dear mom and dad,
Ginny drops down on Harry’s lap and pets his hair. “Because after that little goodbye, we don’t believe it anymore,” she says.
That was the moment Professor Snape was suddenly next to me. He took hold of my shoulders and made me look into his eyes. He warned me not to do anything stupid, that it would be for nothing. He again said that Draco was still alive and that I just had to find him. I nodded and started eating the Gillyweed. Professor Snape smiled at me and said that he would not give me detention for stealing the Gillyweed from his office. Later I told him that Dobby had gotten it for me and asked Professor Snape not to take it out on the elf, that he had just wanted to help me and Draco. But at that moment, I didn’t care where the Gillyweed came from.
“I know, I’m sorry. Fuck. Okay, here it goes. You might hate me after this, but I need you to know.”
“Fine,” Harry snaps back. He pushes his books into his bag. “I’m going for a walk,” he says and walks away.
Draco smiles and then looks at their friends ascending the stairs. He takes a deep breath and toys with the necklace around his neck. It is usually hidden beneath Draco’s robes. Harry hadn’t even noticed Draco wore it until a couple of days ago.
And then Victor Krum joined us and we were surprised to see who his date was. Hermione looked amazing. She had done something with her hair that made it sleek and shiny. I later learnt that she had asked Draco for help to tame her hair. Her dress was made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was smiling at us as soon as she saw us. Draco complimented her on her hair, said that it looked amazing.
Harry James Potter
Only when the holidays had started, I and Ron kind of forgot all about Flamel, because we were having so much fun. We spend a lot of time next to one of the fires in the Great Hall, eating anything we could spear on a toasting fork. We started plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled. That was so much fun to talk about, even though the plans would never work. I didn’t mind going to the dungeons at night during the holidays, because I was the only Slytherin still at the castle. So I had the entire common room for myself and could take long baths without being afraid of getting beaten up. My longs don’t hurt that much anymore and the bruises have all healed.
With care, Harry turns Neville around. His eyes are closed and his face looks pale. Harry bends over his head and looks for any sign of life. A soft wind comes from Neville’s nose. He’s breathing. Harry drops his head on Neville’s chest for a second. “Thank Merlin,” he says. Neville is alive. Hurt and unconscious, but alive. James and Lily aren’t going to kill Harry. They’ll still be mad as hell when they hear what happened, but at least they won’t be able to blame Harry for losing Neville.
I walked back to the Great Hall together with Professor Snape, who told me that he will not tolerate beds not being used and that he doesn’t want to get any complaints from Nott and Crabbe this year. So Draco takes my cloak with him to bed at night and once Nott and Crabbe are dozing off he sneaks into my bed and hugs me close.
“Fuck Harry, what’s going on, you look like shit.”
Harry shakes his head again. His dad is wrong. There is no way that Draco feels the same way about him.
Dinner is always hell. I try to stay away from Malfoy and eat by myself. But they always end up next to me and steal my food, our accidentally push over my drinks. So I’m not eating that well since I also stay clear of the great hall during lunch.
“I don’t want you to get your hopes up,” the healer continues. “It is only in rare cases that the second scan holds better results. It’s a precaution. But after seeing your foetus, it’s clear that it should have had a heartbeat by now.”
I think it was a good thing that Wood was a keeper because he looked like he wanted to hurt one of our team. Points went back and forth for some time, but Slytherin stayed in the lead. If was just never enough to win the cup. So even though I spotted the snitch a couple of times, I didn’t chase it. Every time I spotted it I faked a look of concentration and pulled my Firebolt around toward the other side of the field. McLaggen kept following me, not spotting the snitch but being stupid enough to think I would lead him to it. Like he could outfly me if I would spot it first.
"Wish it was just that, Ron," Harry answers.
Next to all the TriWizard stuff and stupid professor Moody, I’ve just been really busy with the massive amount of homework we’ve been getting. I wanted to cheat on my moon chart for Divination, but Draco wouldn’t let me. He made me do all the work and made sure I understood all the calculations. The predictions were really boring and I’m sure I would have gotten a better mark if I’d handed in a chart filled with catastrophes and near-death experiences. But that aside, we do spend a lot of time in the library with our friends doing homework. Our group is slowly growing. It is so different from first year where it was just me and Hermione. Now it’s Blaise, Luna, Greg, Daphne, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Seamus, Dean and sometimes Millicent. It’s fun to study together and help each other. And when we’re studying, Hermione is less tempted to bring up S.P.E.W. and her fight against house-elf enslavement. And that’s a good thing. It’s like school and her S.P.E.W. is the only thing she’s willing to make time for at the moment. And complaining that Ron seems to be head over heels about this Veela girl from Beauxbatons. Blaise told her to take matters into her own hand and just ask Ron out on a date or something. But Hermione is refusing to take the first step.
“You’re going to help me make dinner, little man?”
I stopped walking when the water reached my middle. The water was cold and I wanted it to swallow me. I looked at the Gillyweed in my hand and wondered if I should take it or not. I could just dive down and never come back up? Or I could take it, swim as far down as I could and wait there until the Gillyweed would stop working. That way nobody would be able to stop me and I could be with Draco again.
Harry’s eyes scan all the places they put down detection charms, only Pettigrew is nowhere near them. He sighs and wants to crumble up the map and throw it away. He doesn’t of course, the thing is too valuable to destroy. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to destroy it. It’s useless.
Hermione picks up the fabric and turns it around in her hand. “It’s the same material as our robes,” she says. “Why would someone send you a small piece of robe fabric?”
“Is it normal that it takes this long?” Harry asks. He looks at Draco from the other side of the small waiting area.
New tears fall from Draco’s eyes and Harry rushes back to the desk. He rests his hands on Draco’s sides and leans in for another kiss. “I love you too,” he tells Draco.
There was a boy that was sentenced for the same crime. He begged Mr Crouch to believe he didn’t do it. He called Mr Crouch his father. But this didn’t stop Mr Crouch to sentence him to Azkaban for the rest of his life.
It’s only a couple of weeks until final exams. Hermione is still petrified so Draco is the only person pushing me to study. It’s been nice, we’ve made a little study group. We can’t go to the library (which I’m kind of grateful for since it will only remind me that Hermione is still petrified and won’t be studying with us) so we study in the common room. Greg, Blaise and Daphne have joined us. Blaise is really good in Transfiguration, he’s been helping me practice the Reparifarge spell right. They all apologised for thinking I was the heir of Slytherin. Daphne said there was no way it could be me because I would never hurt Hermione. She hopes the Mandrakes will be ready soon, so I can have my best friend back.
And then the entire Great Hall became silent. It was time to find out who would be the Hogwarts champion. We all hoped it would be one of the Slytherins who had put their name in the goblet. Adrian and Miles were clearly nervous. They both looked scared while we waited for the goblet to light up again. I must say we were all a little disappointed when Dumbledore told us that the Hogwarts champion was Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff. The Hufflepuff table went crazy and Cedric was grinning while he walked to the other room.
I told Miss Davis that I’m good and that I don’t think I need any more therapy. She didn’t agree with me, so I still have to come back every Thursday after my classes and before dinner. It’s really annoying because I also have Quidditch practice at that time. I told Miss Davis this and she would look if she can find another afternoon to do this. Draco said Marcus wasn’t happy I wasn’t there for the first training this afternoon and that he would go look for another Seeker is I miss practice once a week. After dinner, Draco and I went to speak with Professor Snape and he assured me that he would take care of it. I hope he does because I would hate to be kicked off the team before I even get the change to really play.
They both laugh and the tension is gone for a second. But then Hermione takes Harry’s hand in hers. “Promise me you won’t go after him alone,” she says. “I don’t want to go to your funeral.”
“What are you and your dad doing this Christmas?” Ginny asks Luna. Luna looks up from her copy of the Quibbler and smiles at them all. She’s a bit weird, but somehow, she brings the best sides of Ginny out, so Harry doesn’t mind having her around. Even if she has the craziest ideas and beliefs in fairy tales.
“Yes, both he and Charlie will spend Christmas at home,” Ginny says.
Love you both,
As soon as the teachers had left the Broomstick, both Hermione and Draco popped their heads under the table. I was already crying and Draco took my arm and guided me outside, along the road until we reached a small park. He walked me in and sat me down on a little bench. He pulled a coat over me and a scarf around my neck and then just pulled me close to him. He kept telling me that it was okay, that everything will be okay. I think he even said other things, but I had a hard time listening to him. My mind was spinning. Why had nobody ever told me? Why had Hagrid, the headmaster, Mr and Mrs Tonks, Draco’s mother or even the minister never told me that you had died because your best friend had betrayed you?
It’s only two more days before they all go back to Hogwarts. James has been called into work this morning. Harry and Neville both know why, but nobody says a word about Pettigrew. Sirius stops by after lunch and takes Draco with him on a little trip to a shop that specialises in products for deaf people. Harry slumps into his room and drops down on his bed. Neville follows him and drops down next to Harry.
Harry doesn’t know what to say. In a way, Neville is right. Why do you have to come out as gay, but not as straight? It is kind of unfair. As if it isn’t hard enough to figure it all out, and then you have to announce it too. He looks at Neville, at his soft smile and accepting eyes. Harry moves without thinking. He pulls Neville in a quick hug and whispers a thank you before letting him go.
Draco stares at her. She said ‘kill them too’. Does that mean that it’s over? That all hope is truly lost?
The dinner after the sorting didn’t go well. All the dishes got filled with all kinds of food, like roast beef, roast chicken, sausages, bacon, potatoes, peas, and gravy. I was hungry so I tried to fill my plate with a bit of everything, only to have Nott grabbing the things off my plate and putting it on his own. Malfoy was laughing, just like Crabbe and Goyle. When Nott’s plate was full he finally let me keep some of my own food. I eat it as quickly as possible before they would take my food again.
I was still crying by the time Malfoy came into the dormitory a little before dinner. He didn’t say a word, just opened his own trunk and search for something all the way at the bottom. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw what he dug up. He was holding my notebook and cloak. He placed them on the ground next to me and walked out of the dormitory again. I didn’t go to dinner that night; I just curled on my bed, holding the cloak and notebook to my chest.
“Fucking Merlin,” Ron says and he climbs over the table so he can help keep Neville in the Great Hall.
He must have drifted off at some point, because it’s way too soon for Harry to be back in their room, showered and dressed and ready to start the day. Harry opens the curtains and Draco groans.
It was then that uncle Vernon came upstairs and I hit Dobby in the closet. Uncle Vernon was very upset and told me to keep quiet, or else I would wish I was never born. And he is right, I kind of wish that now. After uncle Vernon had left I told Dobby I had to go back because it is horrible here and that I think I’ve got friends at Hogwarts. And then I found out that Dobby had been stopping their letters from reaching me. He had them with him and I could see letters with Hermione’s handwriting, with Hagrid’s and Ron’s untidy scrawl. I didn’t see any letters from Draco.
“Thank you,” Hermione says out of nowhere.
“That’s the spirit,” Remus says. “Now, turn around and go get dinner before Ron has eaten it all.”
Headmaster Dumbledore even came by today in the hospital wing. He came to apologise, said he hadn’t realised that we had finished the connection. It is in that moment that Sirius had raced into the hospital wing. He first checked if I was okay and then turned to shout at the Headmaster. He yelled that Dumbledore should have warned him, that he should have known that this task would affect me more severely than the others. He even muttered that he should have listened to Snape. He was shaking his head when he said that. I know Professor Snape and Sirius don’t get along and hearing Sirius say that professor Snape isn’t all bad was a big thing. It even made Draco laugh.
Peeves knew someone was there, even though he couldn’t see us. I pretended to be the Bloody Baron and told Peeves to stay away from the third-floor corridor for the rest of the night. And that worked. Peeves said he was sorry for his joke and left, wishing our business well.  Ron thought my little lie was brilliant.
“Talk to you later, Pansy. Don’t destroy my husband while I’m gone,” Harry says before he also walks out of the room.
Care of Magical Creatures was, how to call it, I think interesting is the best word. Hagrid has bred Blast-Ended Skrewts. They look like deformed, shell-less lobsters and are horribly pale and slimy-looking. They have no visible heads and legs stick out in very odd places. And the smell is like smelling rotting fish. OH and every now and then, sparks fly out of the end of a skrewt, making it propel forward. We had to feed them that first lesson, which was kind of hard since they didn’t seem to have any mouths. Draco didn’t like them at all, since they could burn, sting and bite all at once. And I had no idea how to make it so that these creatures sounded useful or less scary for him. So I just let him hover behind me while I tried to feed them.
Love you both,
It’s enough for the Dementor to slide away. Some warmth sweeps back into Harry’s body and he lets out a deep breath. A bar of chocolate is pushed into his hand and Harry smiles up at his uncle.
Oh, and my problem with my therapy being at the same time as Quidditch practise has been resolved. Professor Snape made it so that I can go to therapy in my free period on Wednesday when Draco has Ancient Ruins. It’s perfect like this, it means we still have plenty of time to do our homework together, sneak off to kiss and make all the practice. It’s really fun to be on the team. Marcus keeps yelling at us to stop being two sick lovebirds and pay attention. But I can’t help it, Draco is really sexy when he’s up on a broom. I’m just glad the entire team agrees that I’m a natural as a seeker. They didn’t even have try-outs for the position, just gave it to me. Marcus said that he had promised Terence. Who had promised him that Marcus would get his win this year if he did.
“Our little one can still be alive?” Draco asks. He looks up at the healer, a little spark of hope forming in his heart.
We spent the morning in the common room with our friends, close to the fire. I was sitting in Draco’s lap and Adrian shouted we should go cool down in the snow outside. He and his friends had just come back from a massive snow fight. And after lunch we took his advise and went for a stroll in the cold. Close to the castle, the snow was a mess, but the farther away we walked around the lake, the more untouched snow was around us. It was a nice afternoon, until Draco insisted we go back because he had to get ready (like three hours before the ball even started). He made me put a very elaborate braid in his hair, which took me like four tries to get right. But it made him look so beautiful, it was worth all the effort.
The blasts from the commotion came closer and closer and Draco took out his wand and light it up. I tried to get mine, but somehow I’d had lost it. We looked around with the light of Draco’s wand but couldn’t find it. It made me feel vulnerable and I was glad Draco was with me, knowing he would protect me if it was necessary.
Draco walks up the stairs of the castle, the route he’s taken so many times in the last couple of weeks. He doesn’t stop until he reaches the place where he first ran into Harry at the beginning of the school year, where they shared heated words until Harry broke down in front of Draco when he mentioned Cedric. Harry had cried and Draco had sat next to him without saying a word.
It was all so nice. And then it all became horrible. Professors McGonagall and Flitwick came into the Three Broomsticks, together with Hagrid and the Minister of Magic Fudge. Draco and Hermione pushed me under the table just before they all took a seat at the table next to ours. They talked about the Dementors and Sirius Black. How Sirius Black used to be your best friend, dad. That the both of you had been inseparable when you went to school at Hogwarts, like brothers. They talked about how Black had been the best man at your wedding and that you had named him my godfather. And that wasn’t even the sickest thing about it. He betrayed you, gave you up like you mend nothing to him. I heard them talk about the Fidelius Charm, how Black had been your Secret-Keeper and had given up your location to Voldemort.
Ginny sighs but doesn’t move. Harry sits back up and tries to smile at Neville, but his mouth won’t cooperate. This is harder than he expected it to be.
We have our first match at the end of next month, and Draco is training really hard to become the best seeker they have. Adrian teases him every time Draco gets worried. Hermione says it’s fun to watch. She and Daphne come watch us train most evenings. They do their homework together while we fly. Only Derrick and Bole don’t like it, they’re afraid she will tell the Gryffindors about our tactics. Miles told them to shut up, that Hermione was cool and that she would never betray her best friends like that. And I agree with him.
“If it’s one of us, it will be Neville,” Ron says. “He’s the one that doesn’t have that many friends, that likes to spend time alone in the greenhouses. And he’s a single child without any parents.”
“No, but I think dad is already on his way,” Neville says. “He’ll be here shortly. You know how he is.”
Remus checks Malfoy and nods his head. “He’s still in one piece. Only unconscious at the moment. Let’s get him into an empty compartment.”
“I’m sorry,” the healer says again. Draco tries to remember her name, but his mind is blank. Slowly the healer slides the probe she used for the echo out of him. Draco wants her to put it back, to have another look, to tell him that she was wrong, that she made a mistake.
* * *
Ron already had a plan. Only the day before they had overheard Professor Lockhart saying he knew where the entrance of the Chamber of Secrets was, so we should start with him. So we sprinted to his office. And you will never believe it, but Professor Lockhart was packing all his belongings. It seemed that the other Professors had tasked him with rescuing Draco and he was running. He was going to leave my boyfriend for death. I got really angry and started shouting at Professor Lockhart. Accusing him from running away, even after all that stuff he had done in his books. And then we found out that he hadn’t done any of those things, he’d been taking credit for what other people had done. He tried to defend himself by saying it was a lot of work to find the stories, to track the people down, asked them what happened and then putting a memory charm on them so they wouldn’t remember doing it.
Draco rolls his eyes and then shakes his head.
I haven’t used my cloak again after that and kept my promise not to go looking for the mirror. I sometimes wish I can forget what I saw because I keep thinking of you mom and dad. And I’ve started to have nightmares. You both keep disappearing in a flash of green light in my dream, while a high voice cackles with laughter. I wish Hermione was back already so I can talk to her about it, see what she thinks. And I’m afraid if the nightmares continue when the other boys come back that they will use it against me. I don’t want them to know I have nightmares about you. Malfoy already loves to remind me all the time that I have no family, and this will only make it worse.
“I’ll be fine,” Draco stutters between his tears. “Go back to Teddy.”
Malfoy and Nott were waiting for me when I came back. They shoved me around while telling me I shouldn’t be hanging out with the enemy. Nott took me in a headlock and said he was going to hex me if I would spend another day at the Gryffindor table. We Slytherin’s have a reputation to uphold and I was disgracing all of them by hanging out with those filthy blood-traitors and mudbloods. Nott pushed me into a wall after his little speech and punched me in my stomach.
“This way I’m always with you, even when I can’t be physically next to you,” Harry tells Draco.
Before Harry is ready to let go, Iris shows up, chatting away about how amazing Hogwarts is and that she can’t wait for the summer to be over.
Harry stares at the door, not sure what he should do. He wants to follow them, to make sure that Draco is okay. And to keep Uncle Sirius in check. Harry knows how he can be. He might spill all of Harry’s secrets.
I think I’ll try to go back to sleep now.
“It never stops to amaze me, how silly mothers are,” the Dark Lord says. He points his wand at Narcissa. Narcissa’s body stiffens and then she falls from the bed. Her body spasms as the Dark Lord tortures her. Only she doesn’t scream. Somehow she keeps her mind under control and taunts the Dark Lord.
“Are you even listening to me?” Ron suddenly asks. “And what is it you’re looking at. Hermione and Krum left the dance floor ages ago.”
Harry freezes in his track to the door. He looks towards the bed with a trembling lip. He doesn’t say anything, and Draco knows it’s too late. Nothing he says now will change Harry’s mind, and that is for the best. They are over and done. Only Draco can’t let him leave without him knowing that he’s sorry for all he’s done. For hurting the one person he loves more than anything else in this world.
Dear mom and dad,
And Harry can’t stand it.
-x-x-x-x-x-
“I’m jealous, too, silly,” Harry says. “Fuck, you know how badly I want a family of our own. You have any idea how hard it was to wait patiently until you were ready to try again? And how fucking hard it is to be patient until it’s our time now when my best friends stop birth control and fall pregnant within a month. I wanted to destroy their kitchen and hug them at the same time.”
Warning that contains spoilers coming up. I've included a new tag on this story because Harry is getting a little more sexually active. He's a thirteen-year-old boy in love and can't help himself. It's all still very innocent, but if you don't like that cup of tea, just stop reading where Harry tells his mother that it might be better if she stops reading.
Pettigrew grins at Neville. “You on the other hand,” he says.
“Please, Draco, I don’t want to die.”
“Oh, we’re going to Iceland to try and spot a Blibbering Humdinger,” Luna says. “Father is excited. He’s got reports that they have been spotted there for weeks now.”
When we got nearer to Mr Lockhart, a little wizard making pictures recognised me and Mr Lockhart seized my arm and pulled me to the front. It was really embarrassing how he shook my hand and told me to give a nice big smile. He was sure we would reach the front page together. When Mr Lockhart let go of my hand I tried to slip away back to the Weasleys, but he threw his arm around my shoulder and announced that he will be our teacher for Defence Against the Dark Arts this year, giving me a free copy of his stupid autobiography and all his other works in the process. I gave them to Ginny, the Weasleys need the free copies more than I do. Ginny gave me a shy smile when I dumped the books in her cauldron.
Harry nods his head. Calling Remus uncle in class also feels wrong. He’ll just have to get used to the fact that his uncle is now his teacher. Something moves in a big tank at the back of the office. Harry points at it. “What’s in there?” he asks.
“Just one more thing,” Neville says. Harry stops and turns around. Neville looks up from his bed with a grin on his face. “Next time I wake up I expect you to sit next to my bed holding my hand because you are worried about me, not snogging Draco’s face off.”
“Don’t drown,” Draco slurs. He doesn’t even open his eyes, and Harry laughs.
“I take it, that this means you love me too?” Harry asks.
Her next suggestion was to go to headmaster Dumbledore. But we don’t have any proof. Quirrell will never tell on Snape, he’s much too scared. Snape would deny everything and on top of that, we are not even supposed to know about the stone and Fluffy. How are we going to explain that without getting ourselves in even more trouble or lose any more house points? So I decided to do nothing and hope for the best.
Draco puts the note in his pocket and picks up the broom again. He closes his eyes and then nothing happens. Harry lifts his broom and holds it next to him. If all goes well, Draco will let go of his broom and it will stay in the air.
With slippery hands, Harry lifts off into the sky. He wishes he could see Draco’s face when they go above the stands and the wind blows around them. The arms around Harry’s waist tighten, and blood rushes somewhere it isn’t supposed to go now. Harry tries not to think about it, tries not to imagine what it would be like to be with Draco in that way. Harry never thought about that before. But now, with the boy he loves behind him on his broom, two arms around him, he can’t stop his mind drifting to thoughts you’re not supposed to have about a friend.
It didn’t.
Angela nods. “Okay,” she says. Harry bites his bottom lip with anticipation. Angela is Fred’s girlfriend, so hopefully she won’t be so close-minded and have an issue with this. Because if she does, then Harry has a bigger problem than he thought. It won’t be only losing Draco that he will have to fear. He might lose his place on the Quidditch team.
“Yeah, fine,” Harry says. “I’ll remember next time.”
School is no fun anymore. Blaise isn’t talking to either me or Draco. He’s still angry about me getting into the tournament. He doesn’t believe that I didn’t enter myself. Greg and Daphne look like they are siding with Blaise on this, so they are avoiding us as well. And it’s not just them. The entire house is giving me angry looks all the time. They don’t really say anything, but it’s clear that they aren’t happy anymore with me becoming a champion. It’s because all the other houses see me as the person that is steeling Cedric’s glory. Even Professor Sprout seems distant towards me and the other Slytherins. At least Hagrid believes me, he told me so during our class where he had us walk the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Those things are out of control by the way. Draco is scared they are going to hurt one of us soon and that that will be the end of Hagrid’s teaching career.
Professor Lupin made some light that illuminated his tired, grey face. He told us to stay where we were and moved towards the door. Only the door slid open before Lupin could reach it. In the doorway stood a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. It drew a long, slow, rattling breath and I got very cold. I noticed Draco was also shivering in my arms. The cold crept deep inside me, into my heart. And then my eyes rolled up into my head, while I was drowning in cold. I felt like I was dragged downward until the screaming started. It were terrible, terrified, pleading screams. I wanted to help whoever it was and tried to move, but I couldn’t. It was like I was trapped inside a thick white fog that moved inside of me as well.
“I’m going to experience a Muggle Christmas this year,” Ron says. “Mum and dad said it was okay to go to Hermione’s.”
"The test is positive, " Draco says as he walks back into the bedroom. Harry hums without looking up and resumes to read his book. It’s not the reaction Draco hoped for. It’s the reaction he’d expected. Harry hasn’t initiated anything intimate in a while. It’s like he doesn’t care anymore if Draco falls pregnant or not. Maybe he already found another person that might be easier, one who can give Harry the family he so badly wants. Only the thought of losing Harry, having to face this world alone again, Draco doesn’t know if he can do it. So it will be up to him to make sure they at least try. Maybe, as long as Harry believes it’s still possible he won’t leave. So Draco takes off his t-shirt and pants and lays down on the bed next to Harry.
“He will help cook his own dinner this Christmas,” Hermione says. “And then he will understand that it’s wrong to keep house-elves as slaves to serve ours.”
Harry feels Draco come inside him and for a second he hopes that Draco would also release his neck and make him forget about the blood. Only Draco grabs Harry’s head and sucks more desperate. Harry his head starts to hurt and he feels dizzy. He tries to lift his body with his hands to turn around and make Draco stop, only Draco is stronger and keeps Harry in place.
“Harry, come on. Stop smiling at your new boyfriend and find that bloody Snitch.” It’s George that circles him this time.
“No, we're not,” Harry says. He gives Neville a dark look. “And you should both remember that.” He picks up the plates and walks to the kitchen. He can hear his dad tell Iris and Neville to behave. Lily must have instructed him to be considerate of Harry’s wishes to keep his massive crush on Draco a secret.
Harry holds Draco’s hand at this moment. The sun is out and it’s a beautiful day. It’s their last Hogsmeade trip of the year. Harry and Draco are spending it with just the two of them. It’s their first official date. So they walk together towards the village. They won’t go into the main part of town. Uncle Remus has told Harry about this sweet little park close to his uncles’ home. It will be the perfect spot for a picnic.
“Don’t,” Draco says. “Don’t lie to me. You need to go. You need to find a man that can give you your family. I’m not worth giving up your dream.”
of September to go to my new school. I’ll tell you all about it when I get there.
Harry closes his eyes for a second. Of course, Remus will get upset about this. “He doesn’t speak BSL,” he says. “I’ve already tried that.”
By the time the sun makes an appearance on the horizon, Harry makes his way back to the dormitory. Neville is awake when he comes back.
So when Ron went after Nott, Draco walked by and I called out his name and he turned around to look at me. His eyes were on me for a second and then they moved to look at Nott. It’s then that he just turned again and walked out of the shop without saying one word to me. I wanted to follow him but was stopped by Fred, who just shook his head to tell me I shouldn’t follow. Meanwhile, Mr Weasley had told Ron to stop it. Nott was laughing, Ginny was crying and Nott’s father and Mr Malfoy started a nasty conversation with Mr Weasley. Before I realised what was going on Mr Weasley had thrown himself at Mr Malfoy, Fred and George were cheering their dad on when a dozen heavy spell-books came thundering down on Mr Weasley’s and Mr Malfoy’s heads.
Harry sits up a bit when Madam Pomfrey is done with all her check-ups and has given him some potions for the pain and dizziness.
At the end of the class, Malfoy pushes the note in Harry’s hand and then storms off. Harry opens the note. The letters are large and scrawled over multiple times. LEAVE ME ALONE it says. I DON’T NEED OR WANT YOUR HELP!
Narcissa squeezes Draco’s hand again. “I know, sweetheart,” she says.
So, when Harry returns from the first Quidditch practice of the year that weekend, he sits down next to his friends during lunch and right away breaches the issue called Malfoy.
“And I won’t let him hurt anyone else,” Neville continues. “He’s stolen enough from us.”
“I know, love. Just be glad you didn’t share a house with those two for over a year. I was afraid to eat from my dining table.”
“They won’t listen,” Harry answers. He wipes some tears from his face and then lets his head rest on Neville’s shoulder. “It’s like I never was his friend,” Harry whispers. He hates how the words sound. How real it all becomes when they are out of his mind and into the world. Harry wants to have that smile be just for him again. He wants to be the one to make Draco laugh and make him happy. Why isn’t he allowed to do that? And when did Greengrass become his friend? Just because she knows BSL? She didn’t help Draco before. She lived with him in the same dorms for years, and never tried to help Draco. Harry was the one who helped him. Doesn’t that count for anything?
“Don’t, this was not your fault,” James says. “I already yelled at Dumbledore and together we yelled at the Minister. Can say, it’s kind of cool to be able to yell at the big boss for once,” James jokes.
“You’ll have to wait until he shows himself,” Neville says. “He’s our only friend in Slytherin. And there is no way any of his housemates are going to let you in their dungeon.”
Draco makes his way to the bathroom and opens the taps to fill up the bath. He takes off his clothes and slides into the warm water. For some time he just stares at the ceiling, remembering some of the times he did have fun with Vincent and Greg. When they still had been young and unaware of the wrongs they were taught. When Draco didn’t feel the pressure to live up to his father's expectations. When they would just chase the Gnomes in the garden and laugh and shout.
“You’re not going to let me win? Don’t you think it’s about time the Quidditch cup goes back to Slytherin house?” Draco jokes. He’s slicking back his hair so it won’t get in his face during the match. His Quidditch robes hang over one of the pipes in the bathroom.
Harry nods and then looks at the picture again. “He looks a little like a rat here. Dad once said it was because Pettigrew had been hiding like a rat before they found him.”
“Are you okay, Neville?” Draco signs.
Hermione rests her head on Harry’s shoulder. “I think you’re wrong. The way he stares at you, and wants to be close to you all the time. He might feel the same as you,” she says.
The article was very mean, calling Hagrid brutal and saying students were scared of him. And they said that his mother was part of Voldemort’s army of giants that killed many muggles. And Nott and Crabbe were mentioned in the article, saying Hagrid wasn’t able to stop his Hippogriff from attacking the students and that he’s torturing them with his new Blast-Ended-Skrewts. If Professor Grubby-Plank hadn’t called for attention I’m sure we would have ended up fighting with them.
Before I could reach Dobby he had darted out of my room and down the stairs. Dobby was sitting on top of a cupboard and Aunt Petunia’s pudding was floating up near the ceiling. I begged Dobby to put it back, but he wouldn’t unless I would promise not to go back to school. I told him I couldn’t and then he dropped the pudding on the floor and vanished.
They try again, with the same disappointing result. The broom crashes to the ground, over and over again. Draco’s shoulders start to slump and after the seventh attempt, Draco kicks the broom away. There are tears in his eyes. Harry wants to hug Draco and tell him it will all be okay, that he will fly today. But that’s not what friends do, so he keeps his distance. It’s time to try the next option.
Draco can't help but grin back at her. He’s happy too. Who would have thought it would happen when they aren’t even trying, when they started looking into other ways to expand their little family.
“Just spit it out, Harry,” Ron says. “It’s not like Mione won’t tell me later. We don’t keep secrets.”
The headmaster explained the effect to Sirius, mentioning that one of the wands would force the other to regurgitate spells it had performed. And then he looked at me and said that some kind of form of Cedric most have appeared. I confirmed and said that there were more, an old man, and Bertha, and them mom and dad. When I said that, Sirius and Lupin linked their hands, and I could see the tears stuck in Sirius his eyes.
And the worst part was, Brown was all like: ‘Oh do you remember that Trelawney had said something about one of us leaving us forever around Easter’ and the entire class was all impressed. But I didn’t really think about that. I was worried about the prediction Trelawney was about to make. Did she really see the Grim? Because the last thing I need is another near-fatal accident with the Quidditch final just around the corner.
“Were they here for Pettigrew?” Harry asks.
When we reached the forest it was all quiet. Professor Snape and headmaster Dumbledore lit up their wands and searched the ground. It didn’t take us long to find Viktor laying on the forest floor. He was knocked out, but the headmaster woke him up with a simple spell. Then he used another spell to call for Hagrid and Snape went to fetch Karkaroff. Karkaroff was angry, he called it treachery and went on and on at Dumbledore about who unfair the tournament was with Hogwarts having two champions and ministry workers attacking the competition. And then spitting at the headmaster’s feet. This pissed of Hagrid, who lifted Karkaroff off the floor and slammed him against a tree. Dumbledore told him to let Karkaroff go and escort me back to the castle, to the dungeons. And lucky for Karkaroff Hagrid listened to the headmaster and let go of him.
I stumbled to the floor when they told me. I couldn’t believe it, I had only just got him back and now I was going to lose him all over again. And this time for real. He would die and I won’t be able to save him.
Once Narcissa had left me alone to sleep I crept out of the room to find Draco’s bedroom. It wasn’t hard at all and I was stunned by how big it was. Draco has a king-sized bed. It’s fairly simple, just a bed base with a mattress on top of it. Now that I’ve seen it in the light of day it really looks amazing. It has two simple black boxes next to it as bedside tables and a large desk stands on the other side of the room. One of his walls is filled with Quidditch posters and the picture of us together that Dean made for him is really stuck underneath Draco’s pillow. And Draco has a walk-in closet filled with all his clothes. Oh, and he has a massive en suite bathroom with a massive bath and a cabinet filled with all his crazy hair products.
“What does your dad turn into?” Ron asks.
“He’s just a friend,” Harry says.
Harry James Potter.
Sirius smiles and shakes his head. “I guess you found your Moony then.”
Neville moves to sit across from Ron and makes the first move for a game of chess. “See what I had to put up with for two weeks,” he says with a grin on his face.
Harry shakes his head. “You don’t understand,” he says. “I need to get to the rat before Neville does.”
Rookwood gives Draco a dark look. He’s still upset that Draco took his place around the table. Draco is sure that Rookwood would kill him if he knew he would get away with it.
“Is it stupid of us, doing this?” Neville asks. He scratches the back of his neck.
I could see myself in the mirror. I was pale and scared-looking at first. But only a moment later, my reflection was smiling at me. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. Then he winked and put the stone back into the pocket. And at that moment I could feel something heavy drop into my real pocket. Somehow I had gotten the stone.
Harry shakes his head. “But Malfoy is engaged,” he stammers.
Dinner starts and everyone around Harry is talking with each other. Harry doesn’t pay them much attention. He keeps staring at Malfoy on the other side of the room. He looks like he’s having a good time with his friends and Parkinson.
“Ah, Draco dear, good to see you,” Molly says. “I don’t have any wine for you here. I believe Ginny took all the good stuff with her to the living room.”
Harry nods. He closes his potions book. He hasn’t written a single word for his essay in the last half hour. Snape will be happy when he can again take points from Gryffindor. Harry doesn’t care anymore.
“You’ve got Quidditch practise this afternoon?” Hermione asks. She still has a piece of parchment in front of her and her quill hovers above it. Her essay is longer than it’s supposed to be. She will lose points because of it. But Hermione will never understand that.
“Cows can be any colour you want, Tedster,” Pansy says. Draco gives her a look. They’ve talked about this. Teddy doesn’t like the name Tedster. But Pansy won’t stop using it. Draco isn’t sure if it’s because Teddy doesn’t like Pansy at all or if he genially hates the nickname.
And there is talk about closing the school for good. Meaning I would have to go back to the Dursleys, for the rest of my life. I would never see Draco again. And I can’t do it. I can’t do any of it, momma.
Neville is a big fan of Herbology. He loves plants and I like partnering with him for this class. He knows a lot about the subject. We’ve been working with Wormwood, Mandrake Root and Dittany. We’ve also had theory lessons about the severing charm. I’m not sure what I think of it, I don’t think I have the green fingers necessary for this subject.
Shacklebolt scrapes his throat. “Please speak up for the court,” he says.
“They are from the shop, grandma.”
“I go try to have a normal conversation with Malfoy if you go and tell Ron that you like him.”
“I don’t,” Harry says.
“You mean to say that my dad isn’t an asset to the Ministry?” Ron asks.
“We can go to the library,” Draco suggests.
After we did all our shopping we went to get some ice-cream at Florean Fortescue’s. Draco’s mom and Mrs Tonks went to sit at their own table, to chat and catch up. Draco is still surprised about that. He never really knew Mrs Tonks, who’s his aunt, because she was cast out of the family after she married a Muggle-born wizard. I like that somehow my little misdemeanour caused them reconnecting. Florean himself brought us our ice-creams and asked us about the coming school year. Hermione mentioned our essay about medieval witch burnings and she and Florean got into a discussion about that, giving me and Draco some time to just stare at each other and smile a lot. I don’t think I’ve ever smiled this much before in my life. I like it.
Harry just needs to forget he ever knew Draco. He needs a fresh start. One without the memories and the pain inside his heart.
“Harry, with this ring, I promise you to love you till the day I die,” Draco said with a massive grin on his face. His fingers shaking while he pushed the ring onto Harry’s finger.
He ignored me, just completely ignored me. Turned around and walked out of the shop without saying a word. It had been a nice and fun day until then. After that I just wanted to go somewhere I could be alone and cry. He must hate me if he acts like this, right? He wouldn’t ignore me if he really cared about me, would he? Mom, why does he not want to talk to me anymore? I thought we were friends. Even more than friends. I just don’t understand. Hermione was really nice, we went for ice-cream, just the two of us after we finally escaped Flourish and Blotts. She hugged me and said we would find out what is going on on the train to Hogwarts. She is convinced there is something else going on. According to her, Draco looked sad when he saw us. And I have to agree with her. Because when I saw him at Borgin and Burkes he wasn’t really himself, not like I know him. He didn’t just say what was on his mind or acted like he was important. He looked down at the floor a lot and tried to avoid his father’s gaze.
“Shut up, Hermione,” Neville says. “You don’t know half of it. That man is clever. He’s escaped Azkaban, he’s not going to get caught that easily.”
At the Quidditch pitch the wind was so bad we all staggered sideways as we walked out onto the team, except for Derrick and Bole. They are so big, it was like the wind was no match for them. And only five minutes into the game I was already soaked to my skin and half frozen on my broom. I could hardly see my teammates, let alone the Snitch. The commentary wasn’t to be heard over the winds. My glazes kept getting clouded by the rain and I was glad when we had a short time-out. We were fifty points ahead. Draco complained that his hair was getting too long, that it was sticking to his face and getting in his eyes all the time. He used a small band to tie it at the back, but it kept slipping out. We’ll have to look into a way to keep it out of the way for the next match. I’m sure Daphne will be able to help with that.
“Since he drooled all over Digory last year during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff,” Ginny says.
Harry shrugs and sits down on one of the bar stools. Lily puts down the leftovers she was packing away and sits down next to Harry.
We had to write our papers in a large classroom with special, new quills that had been bewitched with an anti-cheating spell. We also had practical exams. For Charms, we had to make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk and for Transfiguration we had to turn a mouse into a snuffbox. I managed to do both, so I’m sure I’ll have some decent marks, even though I might have screwed up my written exams.
“Harry,” Draco says. His voice is soft and Harry turns to look at him again.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks. He signs along with his words.
“We’ll see about that once it’s time for bed,” Draco tells Teddy. He picks the boy up and walks to the bed and sits down next to Harry. Harry rests his head on Draco’s shoulder.
And then the other teachers were moving in around me. Professor Snape was there and he stepped next to me, shielding me away from the others. The headmaster asked me calmly if I had put my name in the goblet and I answered him truthfully. Then all the teachers were discussing how it could be that my name came out of the goblet and that it was unfair that Hogwarts would have two champions. Professor Snape stood up for me, saying that I wouldn’t lie about something like this. I opened my mouth to tell them that I can redraw, that I don’t want to compete anyway, but I never got the change. Professor Moody came walking in that instant and told us all that it was a magical biding contract and that there was no choice but to compete.
“Bill is going to be disappointed you won’t be home during Christmas,” Ginny says.
Harry laughs even harder and shakes his head. It’s good to see Hermione worry about Ron instead of him for a moment. “I do think I need to tell him that it’s just boys for me.”
Harry wonders too. He hasn’t seen or heard about Dobby since he’d been freed from the Malfoy family. ‘I don’t know either,’ he writes. ‘And I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make things worse.’
The rest of the day I spend with Ron, Fred and George. Christmas dinner was amazing. There were a hundred fat, roast turkeys, mountains of roast and boiled potatoes, platters of chipolatas, tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. The crackers were really cool; they went off with big blasts and colourful smoke. I got a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit and my own set of wizard chess from the crackers.
“Don’t worry, she says,” Ron shouts back. “You got kidnapped by the Merfolk, and you tell me not to worry.”
“I’ll be horrible,” Harry answers.
“Harry, is Draco okay?” Hermione asks.
Maybe he could take some now?
“It hurts. I didn’t expect it to hurt this bad.”
Harry James Potter
Oh, and we helped Greg in asking Daphne to the dance. He wanted to make it special. So we planned the whole thing, with flowers and everything. It was almost like a wedding proposal and Daphne was delighted. I think that was the first time they kissed in public. It was really cute.
We didn’t hear much more, because it turns out that Professor Moody’s magical eye can see through doors, and he warned the room that Professor Snape, Draco and I were standing at the door because we wanted to talk to the headmaster. We entered but were told to wait until they had investigated the grounds. Professor Snape joined them, asking the minister all kinds of questions when they departed. I think he doesn’t trust Professor Moody and is still afraid the man will say terrible things about him.
I wish that could have been the end of our little trip, blessed out and in the arms of the man I love. But the night turned into a small nightmare. Sirius woke us up in the middle of the night and told us to get a jacket and to get outside. When we got outside we could see people running away into the woods. Something was moving across the field towards us, emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire. Draco muttered the word Death Eaters and when I looked closer I could see that the something were people wearing masks and pointing their wands into the air. High above them, floating along in midair, were four struggling figures that were being contorted into grotesque shapes. Sirius told us to hide in the woods, that he was going to help Moony, Tonks and Mr Tonks who already had set off towards the group of Death Eaters.
“Maybe you should let him be,” Neville says. “He doesn’t want your help.”
“See for yourself,” Fred says as he levitates the newspaper towards them. Hermione grabs it. Ron looks over her shoulder and then drops his fork.
In the afternoon we hat Magical Theory for two hours. And since the only empty spot in the class was next to Hermione when I came in after hiding in the bathroom all of lunch I was saved from getting bullied during this class. We went and did our homework in the library again. I waited till almost eight to go down for dinner and I was happy to see that my classmate had already finished, so I finally had a decent meal. I cried myself to sleep that night. I felt so alone. Mom, I don’t understand why they have to be so mean. Is it just because I didn’t want to shake Malfoy’s hand during the train ride to Hogwarts?
Back in the common room, I spend half the night speculating with Draco, Blaise, Greg, Daphne and Millicent about what happened to Mr Crouch and what was wrong with him. Draco said it looked like he was under the imperious curse and was fighting it to warn us about Voldemort. All I know is that we hardly had any sleep that night and that I fell asleep on Draco’s shoulder during History of Magic the next day.
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand and smiles at him. “Wrong about being pregnant,” he says with a massive grin on his face.
“Only because your father gave me no other choice,” Pettigrew says. “He charged straight away when he saw I had his best friend captive. He’s lucky I still felt guilty towards them on that day. Otherwise, your Uncle Sirius would have been in a grave before you even knew how to walk.”
Harry stokes some hair out of Draco’s face. Draco looks at him and isn’t surprised to see a hint of worry in Harry’s eyes.
“He’s gone mental,” Ron says.
“Why would they have to admit that?” Vincent asks.
“One day, we just need to be a little more patient,” Harry tells Draco.
“Thank you, Dad,” Harry says again. “I love it.” And he means it. He loves that his parents are willing to do this for him and his dream to one day play at that level. He hugs his dad who ruffles Harry’s hair.
Draco laughs. “And who of the champions will miss me? I get Granger and Chang, being Potter’s and Diggory’s girlfriends. And I’m sure the French girl is related to Delacour. But how in Merlin’s name am I the thing that Krum will miss the most?”
The next day, Hermione pulled me to the library to talk about what happened. She believes I didn’t put my own name in and is worried just like Draco about the fact that somebody might want to kill me. Ron and Neville were with her, and they also agreed I would never have entered. Ron said I would have put Draco’s name in if I’d had the change since I went on and on about how good a candidate Draco would be. This made Draco blush and he kissed me on the cheek, saying Ron was right. Neville tipped in that he thinks I will win, but that he also believes I didn’t put my own name in.
Harry laughs. “I’ll try to remember,” he says and then walks on.
“And what if it doesn’t?” Draco asks. He closes his eyes. He can’t stand the thought of looking into the most beautiful eyes he’s ever seen when they break his heart.
Nott is having fun with me being a champion. He joked that everyone should get my autograph soon because there is no way I would survive the first task. Draco almost attacked Nott when he said that, but luckily Hermione and Ron helped to stop him. I don’t want Draco to get into trouble because of me. And that is not all, Nott tricked a seventh year Ravenclaw into making badges for the whole school. They say ‘Support Cedric Diggory - the real Hogwarts champion!’ and when you press the badge, the message changes into ‘Potter stinks!’ Almost all the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws wear them, and most of the Gryffindor’s do too. Only Hermione, Ron, Neville and Ron’s brothers Fred and George don’t wear them.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione says. “You’re just like two little kids pulling each other's hair because your afraid to say you like each other.”
“You’ve heard me sing. I will never be able to do what you do, makeup notes and words and make them work. You should have become an artist,” Harry says as he sits down next to Draco. Draco takes Harry’s hand and places it on the keys. He pushes the fingers down as he leans his head against Harry’s shoulder.
Everything turned out okay. I’m not staying at Draco’s anymore, which makes me a little sad, but I’m good. Draco’s mother contacted her sister and asked her if I could stay with her for the rest of the summer. Draco was really surprised by this. According to him, his mother hasn’t spoken to his aunt Andromeda in years, not since Andromeda married Ted Tonks. I’ve been here for almost two weeks now and it’s really nice. Mrs Tonks is a kind woman and her husband Mr Tonks is really funny. They have a daughter that is busy with her Auror training. Her name is Nymphadora, but she wants me to call her Tonks. Its something she and her mother fight about a lot. Tonks is a metamorphmagus and she likes to turn her hair bright pink. I’ve seen it in the morning, in its natural colour and I don’t get why she likes to make it bright pink. I think it’s just a bit too much.
Ron’s eyes become twice as large as normal and his mouth falls open. “Bloody hell,” he says. “Professor Lupin is a werewolf?”
And Draco is staying at the castle this Christmas holiday to keep me company. I’m really looking forward to having the dormitories to ourselves. Nobody to complain that we snug too much or should stop being so obviously in love. The other students are leaving on Friday.
He takes a sip of his lemonade. It’s a nice day today. The sun is out and spring is in full swing. Neville and Lily are planting out some seedlings on the other side of the garden. Iris is inside with her head in one of her favourite books. Draco loves books too. He could read all day if it was up to him. He’s probably reading right now, on a ledge somewhere in the castle. Does he ever think about Harry, or about how he was in this house last break, celebrating Christmas with them all? Harry can’t stop thinking about it. Every room has a memory with Draco in it now.
Harry James Potter.
“Harry, I’m sure all is fine. Hermione is a tough one. Just be patient,” Draco tells him.
Harry takes a better hold of his broom and points it upwards. The Snitch goes into the cloud and Harry follows it. Cold rain slashes against his face, but Harry doesn’t take his eyes off the Snitch. It’s so close. Harry stretches out his arm and speeds up a little more.
“Hermione, you are brilliant,” Harry tells her. He leans over Ron and gives Hermione a peck on her cheek.
When I reached the staircase up to the third floor, Hermione was waiting there with Ron, looking around the corner at Peeves, who was bobbing halfway up the stairs, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. I couldn’t believe she brought Ron. How where we supposed to use the cloak with him here?
“You don’t know that,” Hermione says as she opens the door in front of her. Harry shakes his head as he takes hold of the door and Hermione walks quickly through the small hallway between the carriages. Ron and Neville follow her before Harry rushes after them.
“You think I don’t know that?” Harry asks. “I’m his only friend. And I’ve made it all worse by falling for him. He’s going to hate me and be all alone again. I can’t have him be alone, dad.” Tears well up in Harry’s eyes. James pulls him close again.
And as you might understand, that was my biggest mistake of the year. Never tell Hermione she needs to teach people. She’s started to put together a plan to show our friends that house-elves are mistreated and that thinks need to change.
“Yes, Harry, I think I’m pregnant,” Draco says.
Harry shakes his head. “I like it here,” he says.
Tears fall from Draco’s eyes. His hand trembles in Harry’s, who squeezes it lightly. “I love you, Draco. And I hate seeing you in pain.”
The man we saw was Karkaroff and he was brought in for questioning from Azkaban. Mr Crouch was there and asked him for the names of Death Eaters. Karkaroff mentioned multiple names, but most were already captured or dead. Until he mentioned a wizard working for the Department of Mysteries. But he was still sent back to Azkaban, even after he mentioned professor Snape’s name. But it was agreed that Snape had turned sides in the war and was no longer a Death Eater.
When they were all getting ready to go, Draco gave me a long kiss goodbye and promised that he would bring back lots of sweets from Honeydukes. Greg yelled at us to stop being so pathetic and that we can snug again when they come back in time for the feast. And we both knew he was right, but still, I’m so used to always be around Draco that it was weird saying goodbye to him.
That was the only good thing about being in the papers though. Draco’s father has sent an angry letter to Draco, about how he’s disgracing the Malfoy name and how he wished he had a better son, one that would behave like a real man instead of the girl he’s stuck with now. Draco cried that night. He pretends he doesn’t care that his father hates him in front of everyone else, but he can’t lie to me. I can see how upset he was and I wish I could make this easier for him. All he ever wanted was his father to be proud of him and the fact that he knows that will never happen hurts.
Professor Lupin told me he used to be friends with you both. I can’t believe it. After all these years I finally know someone who knew you both and could tell me about you. I figured this out during Halloween. You remember me telling you that Halloween was the first day my classmates were allowed to go to Hogsmeade. Well, I had to stay behind all by myself. Draco first wanted to stay with me at the castle. He hates that he had to go without me, but Blaise and I convinced him to go.
“Today I can tell you all that when I’m six, I will get a very important job, the most important job in the world. Because I’m going to be a big brother,” Teddy declares. The table erupts in cheers and congratulations towards Draco and Harry. Harry places his hand on Draco’s stomach. A thing he’s been wanting to do all afternoon, but he didn’t want to steal Teddy’s big moment. Their boy had been so proud when they told him Draco was pregnant again. And now that the first scan was all good and Draco has heard the heartbeat of the little one growing inside him, he can’t help but be excited too.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry says. He turns around and grins at Wood. “I’ll be right there, Wood. Family emergency,” Harry tells him.
“All of the Hufflepuff seventh years have Herbology too,” Seamus pipes in.
“Is what true, dear Angela?” Fred asks.
I asked Hermione the next day if she knew if there were any ways to hide writing in books and she told me there were several ways. And that made so much more sense. I’m sure Draco had found the diary somewhere and used its ability to hide his word to the rest of the world to keep his own thoughts safe. For a moment I wished I had known how to undo it, so I could have read it. Just to see what I did to make him hate me, so I can apologise. And then maybe one day he will be able to look at me again and smile. But me reading it would have also made him hate me even more, so I let it go and just placed the diary under his pillow that evening. I’m sure he would have wanted it back if someone had stolen it from him. Because I don’t think he would have thrown it away himself.
* * *
“Should I tell him that if he ever breaks your heart, I’m going to kill him,” Neville says.
“Keep your voice down,” Harry snaps while he looks around them. Nobody sits close      enough to overhear them, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. “Nobody is to know.”
Hermione is reading all the extra books we need to read too. She finds the bond fascinating. It’s very rare and she wants to know all about it. I asked her if she could maybe write a summary of it all, so I don’t need to read it. But I’m sure you know by now that Hermione won’t do something like that, so I have no other choice but to read the material. The only problem is that they are old books, written by dull people, so I struggle to get through it. Draco sometimes tells me to skip chapters because they are useless.
“Yeah, but still. What if something is wrong?” Harry asks.
“What’s that?” Ron asks with his mouth full.
But enough about that. That afternoon Draco and I just lay down on the sofa next to the fireplace in our common room. First, we just lay there, feeling sorry for ourselves and after a while, I just wanted to think of something else. We started to kiss, first just small kisses, sweet and innocent. But somehow the kissing got heavier by the second. I ended up on Draco’s lap and we just moved our bodies against each other. And mom, maybe you stop reading here because, well it got really heated. It wasn’t the first time I got hard while kissing Draco, and I know for a fact it also wasn’t the first time Draco got hard. But it was the first time where we kept moving our hips to brush our groins against each other. At some point, I think we stopped kissing, only able to breath heavy until pleasure just erupted out of me. Dad, I never had an orgasm before and this was so intense. Draco came too, and we just hold each other for a long while. I never felt this good before in my entire life.
Thursday 26 September 1991
Friday 18 December 1992
I didn’t matter what the Beaters did, the Bludger wouldn’t stop attacking Draco and it became impossible for him to score any more points. With the Slytherin Beaters focused on keeping Draco safe, the other Chasers were having a hard time, giving Gryffindor the change to score a lot of points. And on top of that, it had also started to rain. It was clear someone had tampered with the Bludger and I wondered who would want to hurt Draco. What had he done to anyone lately? He just kept to himself most of the time. He even spends less time with Pansy these days. So maybe he’s not dating her.
Draco and I sat on the stone steps for the rest of the afternoon in silence. And during dinner, Blaise gave us suspicious looks. We told him what I was going to do when we were back in our dormitory. None of us talked much, we were all thinking about what I was about to do. We moved to the common room when Nott, Crabbe and Goyle came in to go to bed. I had hidden the cloak and the flute Hagrid had given me for Christmas in my schoolbag. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. Nobody paid any attention to us since I was still the boy that made us lose the house cup.
It’s the last thing she says before she leads them to the little office with her assistant. Harry makes an appointment for the second scan and takes the leaflets. His arm folds itself around Draco’s waist as he guides him out of the hall, down to the elevators and back to the apparition point. In seconds they stand in their kitchen. Draco sits down on a chair at the table and folds his arms on the table. His head falls on them, and he cries. He wants to fall asleep and wake up still being pregnant.
“Thank you for the book,” Harry says. He lifts the book in the air and smiles at Mrs Prince. “I’m sure it will help.”
And then it happened. A high, cold voice said ‘kill the spare’. The words Avada Kedavra sounded. A green light flashed by me and then Cedric fell to the ground. As he was holding me up I fell with him. I landed on top of his body. I looked into his face and couldn’t believe it. His grey eyes blank and expressionless, his mouth was half-open like he was surprised. He was dead.
For a while Hermione and I just stood there, catching our breaths. I asked her what the hell is wrong with this school, keeping a thing like that locked up in a corridor. But Hermione snapped at me, telling me to use my eyes the next time because that dog had been standing on a trapdoor, that it was obviously guarding something. And that made me remember the package that Hagrid had taken from Gringotts just before the break-in. Maybe the mystery package from vault seven hundred and thirteen is hidden underneath the trapdoor. Just meeting the three-headed dog was already a big adventure and I would love to have another one.
And the worst part of it all is that we can’t go and see Hagrid in the evenings because of all the extra safety precautions. The only change we ever get to see him is during Care of Magical Creatures lessons. It was hard to see him that first lesson. He was numb with shock and he blames himself. He says he got all tongue-tied. Draco told him to not give up, that they will help with the appeal. Only Hagrid said it was no good, that the Committee was in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket. And that just pisses Draco off, that his father would do this. He’s been ranting about it for days now. The only way I can shut him up is by kissing him.
“What makes you say that?” Harry says. “Hermione is brainy, and she isn’t in Ravenclaw.”
“Fuck,” Harry says. He carefully lifts Malfoy’s head so his eyes are back on Harry. “Do you understand?” Harry asks. He moves his hands slowly this time in the hope that will help Malfoy.
Hermione and I struggled up the spiral staircase up to the top of the tower. I had tears in my eyes because of what had happened to Draco and I throw off the cloak as soon as we were out in the cold night air. I tried to hide my tears and tried not to get angry with Hermione, who was a little bit happy about Draco losing points for Slytherin. He came up to help us and all she cared about was house points.
The flying lesson is thought by Madam Hooch. She has yellow eyes like a hawk. We had to go stand next to a broom and hold out our hand above the broom and say up. My broom jumped into my hand at once, I and Malfoy were the only ones that managed that. Madam Hooch gave me a friendly smile and I felt proud of myself. Next, we got to mount the brooms and Malfoy got told that he was holding his broom wrong. He complained about that to Nott, saying that Hoochy had no idea what she was talking about.
Professor Snape rushed towards me, making sure I was alright. But all I wanted to know is what the bastard had done to Draco and if he was fine. Professor Snape understood and he smelled the tea and then checked Draco. He promised me it was just a sleeping potion, that Draco was fine, and that he would wake up once the potion had set its course.
Draco is hanging over my shoulder now, reading what I’ve just written down and I just want to lay in his arm for a while. I’ll write to you soon, tell you all about my new subjects and stuff.
“Do you think he’s got my letters?” Harry asks.
When they had all left Sirius stood up from his chair and said he would write a letter to Draco’s mom, to make arrangements to keep Draco save. When he left, Draco started to cry. He sobbed on and on about that he could never go home again. I just held him until he fell asleep. And that is where we are now.
Harry reaches for Draco again and their lips slam against each other. The food in the picnic basket gets forgotten as the kiss deepens. Draco loves Harry and Harry loves him. The world is perfect. Pettigrew might have got away. Is probably on his way to the Dark Lord if Trelawney’s prediction is correct. But they are all still alive. Draco saved Harry. And they’re in love. Nothing could be better.
Draco wants to tell Harry that he shouldn’t, that he’s an idiot for loving him. But instead, he just drops his head and keeps silent. Harry won’t hear him, he never has and he never will when it comes to this.
“It’s okay,” Draco signs when he lets go of Ron’s hands. “You try, but I don’t understand a word you say.”
Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. When he opens his eyes again, they are shimmering with fresh tears. His hands lift from his bed and he places them on Harry’s cheeks. Then he leans forward and places his lips on Harry’s.
This morning I saw that I have a bruise on my abdomen. I stayed in bed all day, reading one of the books I took from home. It’s called On My Honour and is about a boy that loses his friend when he drowns in a river. It was a sad book but I felt a little less lonely reading it. I’ve finished it in a day and now I’m writing to you. I’ll have to go to dinner tonight because I haven’t eaten all day and I’m getting a bit hungry. I wish I could sit with the Gryffindor’s again, but I’m sure Nott is going to hurt me even worse if I do. Nott and his friends haven’t really been in the dormitory today, so it was nice and quiet. Only Malfoy came in once, but he didn’t say anything to me. I hope next week is going to be better.
“Are you okay?” Remus asks.
“But what I wanted to say is that you can’t make him want you,” James continues. “You’ll have to respect his wishes, no matter how much it hurts to let him go.”
“One of those snakes is our friend,” Hermione says without looking up from her book.
Draco and I first took some time to talk to Fawkes, the headmaster's phoenix. He is a beautiful creature and we both enjoyed watching him. Draco wished he could have his own phoenix one day. And then all we could do was wait. But our attention was captured by silver light coming from a cabinet that wasn’t closed properly. We opened the cabinet and found a shallow stone basin. Draco told me it was a Pensieve, a device that can hold memories. His father also has one in his office at their home.
Dear mom and dad,
And then it was weekend. No classes to distract me and hardly any homework, since I’ve done most of it already during the week with Hermione in the library. I still got up early so I could have breakfast before Malfoy and his friends woke up. Afterwards, I walked around the grounds and met up with Ron and Neville, who was released from the hospital wing. We talked about their families and what it was like to grow up in a wizarding family. I wish I had grown up with you, mom and dad, so I could have had magical toys and stuff. It really sounds amazing to be able to grow up like that. Ron asked me why I was hanging out with Hermione so much and I told them it was because the library felt like a place where Malfoy and his friends would leave me alone. And Hermione was just always there and she was nice to me. I asked them about how it was to be in Gryffindor House and they talked away about living in the west tower. I had fun that morning and they invited me to sit with them for lunch. Some of the older Gryffindor students were not happy about it, but Ron’s brothers Fred and George told them to back off and that Gryffindor should feel honoured that the great Harry Potter wanted to join them at their table. After that everyone left us alone. Seamus and Dean, the two other Gryffindor boys joined us and we had a nice afternoon, talking about Quidditch and how horrible Snape was. Dean apologized for being mean about my head of house, but I told him it was okay, that I also didn’t like Snape. I stayed at the Gryffindor table until after dinner and I had a lot of fun. But when the Gryffindor’s went to their common room I had to leave them and head back to the dungeons.
"You would do that?" Harry asks.
I hate Malfoy. I really hate him. I never believed I would meet someone I would hate more than Dudley, but I was so wrong. He tries to sit next to me in every class and keeps hitting my right arm when he makes notes. He says it’s the only way he can write properly and that I should stay out of his way, but how am I supposed to do that? He keeps pushing me to the left side of the tables and taking the seat next to me so our arms keep bumping into each other.
Harry bites his lower lip and blinks away the moisture in his eyes. He’d hoped the kids hadn’t notice, but nothing escapes them. Draco has been an emotional mess all pregnancy. It’s worse than the roller coaster of physical and emotional hardship he’d had when he was pregnant with Lily. But Harry had understood that. He’d felt the same fear and been on the same roller coaster. What happened with James was still fresh in their minds and didn’t leave them until Draco was holding Lily in his arms. But it had been better when they had Nathan. Time had helped them heal and Draco was more stable and enjoyed being pregnant. But this time around, he’s been all over the place. Harry wished he knew why. It looks like it’s more than just the hormones, but Draco swears that there isn’t anything else. And maybe he doesn’t even know why this time around it’s taking so much from him to get through his pregnancy.
Dear mom and dad,
But back to Sirius his love life. He’s struggling. He pretends he’s okay with Professor Lupin moving on. And he said he’s glad that Remus is happy. Doesn’t change the fact that I’ve heard him cry a couple of times now when he thinks we are asleep. He’s been talking to you, dad. I’ve heard him, telling you he wished you were here to make him see that everything will be alright, just like you used to do when you were younger. He misses you. He needs his best friend now that the man he loves has moved on. I know you would be here if you could, that you didn’t want to die on us. But we do miss you and we still love you. I wish I could ask you what I do to make Sirius feel better, to get him to smile more. He hardly smiles anymore. I’m truly worried.
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
“A memory of the Dark Lord?” Draco asks.
Harry’s hands slide around Draco’s waist and he pulls him closer. Draco can’t stop himself from pushing his own hands into Harry’s hair, in a completely different way then he’s done before. Today it’s not to comfort or just to be close. Today a need to taste Harry and consume him takes over Draco’s actions.
“It’s tradition. Naming your first child after a constellation.” And Draco loves the name Scorpius. It isn’t only a constellation, but also a creature, just like his own name.
I’ve been thinking about it, touching Draco, seeing him without his clothes. Ever since Christmas. And during our Valentines date, I found out he thought about it too. We had a lovely picnic beside the lake. Draco had managed to get an order in for picnic food from Hogsmeade. It was lovely. After we finished the food we took a walk around the lake until we ended up at the Quidditch changing rooms. Draco pushed me inside and we started snugging. And before I knew it Draco was pushing my sweater over my head and stroking his hands all over my bare torso. Well, I’m sure you don’t want to read all the details. It ended with Draco’s shirt on the ground too and his hand down my trousers, wrapped around me. Fuck, that felt good, to have his hands on me. I repaid him the favour after the match against Ravenclaw and I can say it’s just as hot as having his hands on me.
That day we drove around again all day until we got to the coast and we had to take a rowboat to a shack on a large rock way out at sea. I couldn’t sleep that night. It was cold and the floor was hard and I only had a thin ragged blanket. It was storming. When it turned twelve and it was my birthday someone was knocking on the door of the shack. Everybody woke up and uncle Vernon had a rifle warning the person at the door to leave. And then the door swung clean off its hinges and a giant of a man walked into the house. He had shaggy manes and a wild tangled beard and black glinting eyes. He said I looked like you, dad, but that I have mum eyes. I never knew that they didn’t tell me that either. I’m kinda proud to look like you, dad, now that I know you died trying to protect me. Hagrid, the giant man, told me what happened to you. What that evil wizard had done.
Teddy has his stuffed dragon in his left hand and his right thumb stuck in his mouth. Andromeda wants him to stop with the thumb thing, but it looks so cute on the boy that Draco can’t get it over his heart to tell him to stop. Draco holds out his hand. Teddy moves to them slowly his eyes fixed on Harry’s hand on Draco’s stomach. Draco helps him climb on his lap. Teddy burrows himself against Draco’s chest. Draco holds him in place and kisses him on the top of his head. He puts his other arm around Harry and closes his eyes, enjoying the moment. He’s got his two favourite boys in his arms and in less than nine months he’d need another arm for the new addition to his strange little family.
“He knows, Harry. Just as you know that he misses you,” James says.
Ron and Harry both try to hide a laugh that tries to escape them. The idea of Hermione being stuck with Lavender and Parvati is hilarious.
They smiled at each other and their fingers entwined with each other. Who would have thought they would find comfort in each other when all hope was lost. It warmed Draco’s heart, to know that he would be the last person to be kind to Potter.
"Maybe we should stop with the tests, " Harry says after some time. Draco doesn’t want to hear this. He doesn’t want to know that Harry is giving up.
Remus gets that look on his face when he’s about to say something Harry won’t like. “Harry, I can’t guarantee that Draco is willing to put in the extra work,” he says.
Dear mom and dad,
We had a little moment and for the first time, I understood why Professor Snape has so mixed feelings about me all the time. He’s worried about me, and about Draco, but sometimes I know he wishes I was in a different house so he can duck more points of me, or treat me like he does with Neville from time to time. I think it’s because I look so much like someone he used to hate.
Yes, we all know, Draco loves me. But back to the point. Dobby has this believe that Draco and I will die a horrible death if we stay at Hogwarts. I don’t know why he’s worried since Draco is a pure-blood and I’m a half-blood. Until now only Muggle-born witches and wizards have been attacked. But there was no calming Dobby down. He threatened to bodily harm me if I would not go. And that is when Draco ordered him to never harm me in any way. Dobby bowed and said he wouldn’t, that he would never go against young Master Malfoy’s wishes. I wanted to ask him why we, in particular, were in danger, but Blaise came into the dormitory and Dobby disappeared with a loud crack.
Headmaster Dumbledore started to explain why when the doors of the Great Hall banged open. A man walked in and we all watched him take his seat at the staff table. His face was unlike any I’d ever seen. He had scars everywhere, his mouth looked like a diagonal gash and a large chunk of his nose was missing. But it was his eyes that scared me the most. One was small, dark and beady. But the other was large, round and a vivid electric blue. It moved around ceaselessly, without blinking, and rolled up, down and from side to side. He was introduced as our new defence against the dark arts teacher, Professor Moody. I tell more about him later and why I don’t like him one tiny bit.
Draco shudders when the bed dips and two strong arms fold around him and pull him into a hug.
When we were dismissed, Viktor asked to talk to me and we headed out towards the forest. Viktor didn’t want to be overheard he said and I was fine with that. I wanted to talk to me as I was Hermione’s best friend and he wanted to know what was going on between her and Ron. He said that she talks about him just as much as she talks about me and Draco. I told him that they are dating and was surprised to see that Viktor didn’t like this news. He asked me if I thought he might have a chance with her, that she might leave this redheaded boy for him. I didn’t like to crush Viktor’s hopes, he’s a nice guy, but after all the pining towards each other I’m glad Ron and Hermione are back together and I don’t think Viktor will be able to come between them.
Draco drops his head and looks at his lap. He can’t go back to that. Not if it’s going to be useless anyway. He will just have to learn to live with the fact that he’s never going to be a father, that he will never give Harry his life wish, a child of their own. But then Harry will leave, so maybe it’s okay, maybe Draco won’t become addicted to them. If it keeps Harry in his life, it might be an option.
After the feast, we made it upstairs and Draco got into bed with me. Blaise said he was going to find out a way to get in even though he isn’t even seventeen and Draco said he would join him. I fell asleep that night, dreaming of Draco holding up a big cup, being the TriWizard champion, and smiling down at me saying he couldn’t have done it without me.
A soft smile forms on Harry’s face and his cheeks start to heat. He hopes Draco doesn’t see the pink that flushes over them when he confirms.
“Just a pregnancy test,” Draco says after he opens his eyes again. He would hate it if he would miss Harry’s reaction to his statement. The way his eyes start to twinkle and his mouth turns into a massive grin.
