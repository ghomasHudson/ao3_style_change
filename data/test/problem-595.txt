“But I like the ones you have now,” Harry grinned, descending on Draco with a hungry grin.
“Right, yes,” Harry nodded, wondering where the alcohol was.
“No!” Magalie clutched at her chest “Mon dieu!”
“Oh, we all know that,” Marlene smiled coolly, “Ed told me where you were. But I thought it would be more civil if we just pretended.”
“Is there a reason you’re bellowing the name of my ex girlfriend across the garden?” Percy Weasley had appeared with his wife Audrey, who was wearing a rather affronted expression.
Harry supposed maybe Narcissa and Malfoy were meant to meet today. Being a modern, muggle flat, there was no fireplace at Malfoy’s residence, meaning he had to walk to the communal floo point a few streets over in the mornings. This also meant that Harry had never seen any of Malfoy’s friends or family making a floo call like Ron, Hermione, Luna and Neville so often did to Harry. Although, perhaps the only person who would have floo called Malfoy would have been Narcissa, given the notable absence of other social engagements and the use of the Pop Up Pals Harry had concluded that Malfoy’s real life friends had somewhat left the picture.
“He said he liked my hair on Monday,” Draco muttered, standing in front of the bedroom mirror. “How did I have it on Monday?”
Malfoy stood reasonably tall with narrow shoulders, the rest of his body, however, was mostly concealed by thick black robes. His hair had grown since school and was no longer a host to a handful of sticky gel. Instead it had taken on a gossamer like texture and was tied back in a short plait. It was already receding slightly at the temples but was clearly well kempt and shone pleasantly in the dim morning light. Malfoy’s face seemed to have adapted to his pointed features and his thin lips were a tight line as he attempted to elbow his way through the crowd.
“I saw him at the Ministry once,” Hermione told them. “I think it was about a year ago. I was bringing Ron his hay fever potion as you two had to go out on a mission in the New Forest. He was carrying this heavy stack of files and a couple of aurors walked past him, not looking where they were going and well…” Hermione trailed off, taking a sip of her drink before sighing. “I waited for him to start screaming bloody murder at them, threatening to tell his father or something ridiculous and by the time I realised he hadn’t done anything of the sort he had already picked up the last folder and I’d just stood there, not helping.”
“Any more burning questions?” Harry asked as they made their way up the north side of Diagon Alley towards the park.
“Too right,” Draco huffed, staring down at his ‘all day breakfast’ baguette and dented can of ginger beer.
!’ I don’t really get young people slang.”
“Yeah,” Draco sniffed as did his best impression of a man not on the verge of tears, “me too.”
“Then again,” Malfoy sniffed, “he could probably have demanded to become headmaster and she would have passed the keys to the castle to him quicker than you can say ‘meritocracy’.”
“Draco Malfoy, threatening skinny dipping at a family friendly party,” Harry gave him a wicked grin.
. They always made everything sound so dull, even when it clearly wasn’t. Who could make battling a ten foot kraken brought to life by a seawitch’s potion mishap sound
“What?” Matthew threw up his hands with a guilty smile, “This is what we do on Wednesdays, we compare notes on whose colleagues are the most incompetent and the winner gets their share of the lunch bill covered.”
“You’re hopeless,” Odette sighed, “do you want a dairy free rocky road or a millionaires shortbread? I’m popping back up to the till to get something sweet.”
Draco snorted before he could help himself.
“Potter, didn’t you say you’ve lived here for over a decade?” Draco pulled a face at the clearly ancient décor that evidently hadn’t been update in the last century. “Potter, is that a
“You should come see it actually,” Harry blurted out as Malfoy’s eyebrows crept up his forehead. “I’ve been there over ten years now and I still haven’t figured out how the house works. There’s loads of weird nooks and crannies that shift when I’m not looking and an entire hallway which refuses to light up. Plus no one can get the attic curtains open. Hermione’s got theories it’s about pureblood architecture or something?”
“This is Bill Weasley,” Harry announced, for some inexplicable reason sounding like a child showing off their best drawing to a parent and waiting for a pat on the head. “Ron’s brother.”
Malfoy was sweating and breathing heavily as he through his forearm over his eyes and exhaled deeply.
but somehow the words died in his throat as Malfoy jumped up gracefully to rinse his hands under the tap.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ve heard it all before, trust me,” Harry faux grumbled, “I’ve tried all the Sleakeasy products, along with quite a few Muggle gels and nothing tames it.”
“Draco...” Harry made a frustrated sound, picking his glasses back up and putting them on. “Fuck, look I’m pretty terrible at articulating myself.”
“Everyone always tried to avoid staring at them,” Bill continued, “to the point that they practically do acrobatics with their eyes whilst trying to have a conversation with me.”
of steaks and burger patties. Even got a bunch of fake meat ones for Luna, Seamus and Angelina.”
,” Bill suggested before Yasmin shook her head.
Draco didn’t trust himself to speak, instead nodding before reaching back and partially pulling his trousers down so the elastic pressed half way down his arse. Harry seemed to take this as an invitation to lay Draco back before carefully sliding them all the way off.
“We need to interview that Parisian dealer again,” Harry stated, “that was a solid lead, plus he had links to the Bianchi smuggling ring.”
for Merlin’s sakes,” Draco groaned. “I
“You look like you have a bubble beard,” Harry smirked as he leaned against the sink. Obviously, seeing as Malfoy was in the bath, he should probably fast forward, but the other man was happily talking to himself about quidditch again and some of insights were just too good to miss. Harry had been fast forwarding so much over the last few days when suddenly he had been struck by the irrational fear that once he reached the end of the memories he would never get to see Malfoy like this again, so relaxed and intimate.
“Which Canon’s seeker famously caught the snitch in –“ the witch was reading, when Draco snorted and turned to Harry.
“Bloody hell,” Harry laughed, “one moment you’re giving me a hard time for not having any hobbies and now you’re –“
Harry took a deep, steadying breath before getting up to follow him. He found the other man in his bedroom, sat cross legged on the floor with his back against the mattress, a balled up tissue in his hand.
Hermione laughed before nudging an empty glass towards Draco along with a full pitcher of what was presumably Pimms or some kind of fruity cocktail. “Help yourself,” she instructed, “we thought we’d make the use of the good weather whilst it was still here.”
Draco readied his usual retort, that she
“What if Hermione’s wrong?” Harry huffed. “I don’t want him to think I’m ignoring him now, that he was some kind of failed project.”
of December and would take place at Samuel’s family home in Herefordshire. Harry grinned as he noticed that his plus one option had been vigorously underlined in red ink. He guessed that was Ginny’s doing, cheeky mare.
“That’s more like it,” Picklemarsh grumbled, waving his hand so as to make it clear that Malfoy was dismissed.
and yes,” Harry scratched the back of his head awkwardly, “that’s honestly one of the less obnoxious things you’ll probably see tonight.”
“Ah,” Draco nodded in understanding, “Le fait est que, comme je m'efforcerai de vous l'expliquer en Francais…”
“Alright lads,” Auror Philips strode into the office without knocking, her coppery curls bouncing just above shoulder length. “There’s a briefing in ten, the boss wasn’t sure you guys would have got the memo as apparently you were gallivanting across the Clifton suspension bridge or something.”
Malfoy picked up the article in question and opened the pale blue lid.
“Occamy eggs then?” Bill stated loudly catching Draco’s eye and in the split second that followed somehow conveying everything he needed to. Draco unclenched his jaw and nodded, almost imperceptibly, back.
“Yes, no, maybe, I don’t know!” Draco huffed. “Is it mad Mags? I mean why would I ever turn up there? Why would he ever invite me?”
month? He was spending plenty of time with Odette, Meri, Matthew, Theresa and Nick, to the point that he had barely even used the charmed marbles.
how he had imagined his first interaction with Potter in years to go and admittedly he had imagined it quite a few times.
“I’m quite certain, Sir,” Harry replied through gritted teeth. The most violent thing he’d seen Malfoy do was gleefully crack the top of his crème brûlée with a teaspoon.
a good addition, Odette.”
“I’m starting to understand why Comet haven’t put you in a customer facing position,” Odette scoffed.
“Do you really eat curry in your underwear?” Draco asked as Harry snorted. Whatever he had been expecting in a first question, that was not it.
“Oh, you should have seen the auror brigade today!” Malfoy announced, drawing Harry out of his reverie. “Stampeding down the corridor like a punnet of caffeinated strawberries.”
“Should I be expecting your resignation letter Malfoy?” Picklemarsh asked, sitting back in his leather swivel chair, the back of which had been draped with some sort of wooden chiropractor beads.
“Not today,” Malfoy repeated as sympathy welled up in Harry’s chest. Poor Malfoy must have been even more affected by the run in with Marlene and Winshaw than he had realised.
“Oh shove it or I’ll transfigure you into a plaque that says ‘
“Nah,” Harry replied, shoving a forkful of coffee cake into his mouth and groaning happily. “It doesn’t really start until eleven but I was going to get there early to help set up, but then,
“Blooming ridiculous,” Ron muttered again as the levitating clipboards hovered over to each assembled team along with a self inking quill.
“Well, I mean that’s good right?” Ron picked up a bag of liquorice wands, tossing one over to Harry who caught it before twirling it distractedly through his fingers.
Lisette was more practical and a good friend to have around when Draco had needed to bring work home but still wanted company. Philippe was older, witty and articulate and always on hand to debate politics when Draco felt like getting fired up.
A moment later, however, Malfoy got tangled up in his own trousers, hopping and lurching once across the room before tumbling down onto his backside.
“Don’t be so dramatic Potter,” Draco sniffed as the lift started moving up. “I’ve simply been offered a more preferable position with Gringotts.”
“I reckon you would have liked being a curse breaker,” Harry murmured absently, watching as Draco massaged his temples. The other man’s skin was so white it almost looked fragile, with blue veins visible at the surface. It was like he was made of fine bone china. Aunt Petunia had inherited a set of teacups once, the sides so thin that even precious Dudley wasn’t allowed to use them. Instead, they gathered dust on a display cabinet shelf.
“Maybe you’re not the only one to dive in headfirst sometimes,” Draco sniffed, but he was wearing a small smile as Harry sent him back a glorious grin. “There’s lube in the drawer, just…you’ll go very slowly won’t you?”
Harry groaned internally, he
“He likes cooking,” Harry concluded lamely. Thinking of Malfoy dancing round the kitchen with Lisette, gathering different dried herbs from the wall and singing loudly and off key the words to some famous French ballad. “He can be quite funny,” Harry had noted that time had not dulled Malfoy’s sharp wit but rather refined it from something meant to pierce into a sense of humour that was really quite amusing, albeit self deprecating at times.
“Circe’s tits, I nearly did myself in trying to keep up with Potter during matches and I was actually half decent!” Malfoy pulled a face.
He stared balefully at the contents of his cupboards.  Normally, Saturday morning would mean Crêpes Suzette but he just couldn’t face any form of cooking right now. Instead, Draco poured cereal into a bowl with almond milk and headed for the living room.
Harry wondered how the illusions always seemed to know what to say so as not to upset or offend Malfoy in any way? Ron had mentioned something about personality charms derived from memories.
“Trick question – none of them,” he smirked as Ron made an outraged sound.
“Oh, something truly nefarious, I can assure you,” Malfoy snapped, “I’m torn between inventing a concoction that turns puppies into jam or the bubbling brew that transforms children’s sweets into lumps of coal – which do you suggest for maximum evilness?”
“She thought I should take Malfoy as my plus one,” Harry snorted before realizing the room had gone silent.
Draco’s face scrunched up as he turned to look at Harry, whose face had taken on a slightly pained expression. “What are you blabbering about Potter?”
“Oh my god!” Harry exclaimed rushing forwards, “I’ve always hated how there were no windows in here – look, it leads straight on onto the garden!”
“I haven’t got that syndrome,” Harry sighed resignedly. “He’s just different now. I…I quite like him.”
Ron blinked before snorting wildly, “Jesus, I don’t know mate. I mean, if I remember correctly what George told me, you can’t actually touch them or anything. He was trying to develop a line to be companions for the elderly or people with magical dementia in Mungos who don’t get visitors, I think…” Ron trailed off, looking around the kitchen before letting out a triumphant noise and gesturing to a slip of paper on one of the work surfaces. The label was written in calligraphic script and entitled “
“True,” Pewterfoot nodded, “but the establishments Mr. Malfoy frequents are known for some under the table dealings, Asphodel Fields in particular we’ve had to ring up a few times on illegal procurement practices.” Pewterfoot shuffled through some notes on his desk, reading a list of bullet points. “We have also established that Malfoy receives monthly owls from Paris.”
“Yeah, but,” Harry began, half annoyed at himself for seemingly being so set on defending Malfoy. He figured it must be because if Malfoy really had gone bad after all Harry had done to get him acquitted when they were eighteen, that would just be like a kick in the teeth. “Wasn’t George up for investigation a few years ago as well for that exact thing?”
Eventually, however, Malfoy did stir from his hunched over position. He reached his hands up towards the ceiling before stretching his back from side to side. Harry winced in sympathy as there was a loud crack. He hated the paper pushing aspect to working at the Ministry and couldn’t imagine a job where you didn’t at least get to leave your desk for a good portion of the day.
“Oh stop griping Ronald,” Hermione came into view, carrying two glasses of red wine, one of which she passed to Ron. “Hello Harry, isn’t it lovely? Apparently they’re going to go full out on the winter theme, Ginny’s asked me to research localized weather charms to guarantee some festive snow.”
“I didn’t know it scarred,” Harry whispered into the damp air, “I thought Snape was able to…” he trailed off as his eyes caught on the severe black tattoo still stamped across Malfoy’s left forearm. The skull and snake had gone almost blurry over time but the depth of the black was still there, so violently contrasting the milky white skin around it. Harry sighed, not even sure how to process what he was feeling as Malfoy continued to busy himself with casting cleaning charms on his clothes and folding them neatly onto the bathroom cabinet.
“Wait a minute,” Harry interjected, “are
“Yes?” Philippe prompted as his newspaper disappeared and he sat upright to take control of the black pieces.
Harry moved onto his knees, taking his cock in his hand and jerking himself off as he stared down at Draco adoringly. Draco smiled dazedly back up at him, reaching out to trace Harry’s lips with his fingers. Harry groaned before squeezing his eyes shut and coming over Draco’s chest, some pooling against Draco’s throat.
“I can assure you I did not run headfirst towards an irate bull,” Harry huffed. “I was attempting to push Dankworth out the way of his own ineptitude.”
“Oh Draco, you simply have to try this soup,” Meredith, Odette’s girlfriend jabbed her spoon in Draco’s direction, albeit at a rather odd angle that allowed half of the gratinée to fall to the table. “Oh shoot,” she giggled, unsuccessfully trying to dab at it with a napkin.
~**~**~
sometimes but it’s her articles in the
boutique in Paris.
!” Harry bit out, his fingertips slipping on the gnarled wood of the wand but not quite managing to pick it up.
“See,” Harry laughed, “knew you’d nail it first time.”
“A cruel and just punishment,” Hermione mused. “I’m sorry if he’s rather put you on the spot by inviting Penny Solomon but I think he’s under the impression that –“
“Yet when he realised the Ministry would not be able to continue employing him without this key evidence,” Pewterfoot gestured to the inevitability of the outcome.
Draco never went to the canteen, he supposed he must have done a few times at the beginning. However, nothing quite reminds you that you’re a social pariah like walking through a food hall of a hundred judgmental faces whilst trying to balance an apple and a bowl of minestrone on a flimsy plastic tray.
“Right, inside the lot of you,” Hermione rolled her eyes, hoisting up her own child before beckoning them in with a pair of salad tongs.
Harry froze, his eyes wide and not even daring to blink. Malfoy’s spasms slowly lowered in intensity, his face half buried in the pillow before he collapsed, boneless and spent in his own mess. Fingers slipped stickily from between his reddened arse cheeks.
“Yeah, alright,” Harry wracked his brain before settling on something that he hoped Draco would deem suitably embarrassing. “I sort of…rap when I’m on the toilet.”
Harry supposed he could try to wrench his head out of the pensieve, but that never really worked. Pensieves, leaving your physical body vulnerable on the outside, tended only to let you go when the memory had run its course. In the case of Pensieve Probes, which had multiple vials set up like a timed watermill,  you could be stuck in there for days or weeks if nobody pulled you out or if you weren’t able to use a wand to execute the exit spell.
“Yes, thank you Ron,” Hermione sighed, tuning in to their discussion, “I think the whole pub knows what you mean and quite frankly it’s insulting and a very dated way of talking about the relationship between a -”
Hermione nodded as if she might just do that, whilst Draco tried to ignore the strange expression Potter was pulling. The other man leaned into Draco’s space a moment later however, looking like the cat who’d got the cream. “I knew you’d get on,” Potter whispered smugly. “Hermione despairs with me and Ron, she’s been waiting for someone she can talk to about this stuff.”
“It’s already started!” Magalie exclaimed, pointing to the Magiscreen where Featherhorn now seemed to be involved in some form of fisticuffs with a mean looking wizard brandishing a gardening hoe. “Draco, how could you let me miss the beginning?” She pouted prettily at Malfoy who looked relieved and shrugged with a rueful smile.
“Everyone buys potion ingredients,” Harry interjected, well apart from him, he was crap at potions and tended to buy them ready bottled.
“Excuse me?” Harry laughed.
“I wouldn’t have asked if I wasn’t,” Draco said tartly. “There are some pajamas you can enlarge in the bottom drawer and a spare toothbrush in the bathroom cabinet, I don’t want to share my bed with someone whose breath smells like ketchup and bean burger.”
Harry settled down into the large blue armchair whilst Malfoy was nestled on the sofa. It was a Friday night in the memories and apparently that meant wine and another episode of a terrible wizarding soap opera.
“Please tell me I’m the only person who knows about this,” Draco begged.
“It certainly is,” Harry grinned, grabbing hold of Draco and flipping him round before cuddling up to him tightly. A considerable bulge was now pressed against Draco’s backside and hairy tanned forearms were wrapped around his chest.
Harry grimaced as he remembered the highly inappropriate piece of gardening equipment that Hermione had to glamour if any of the children were nearby. Apparently, George had made a whole set of risqué looking gardening tools for his ‘
“Your reports say you’ve still got a week’s worth of memories to go through?” Pewterfoot glanced at the case file on his desk. “For legal reasons you have to catalogue those hours and then once it’s all been submitted we can let him go. You haven’t seen anything suspicious then? You know that the Twisted Gnosis absorbed quite a lot of the Neo Death Eater crowd.”
“Does he really?” Luna lit up. “Is it the one about piddlewinks secretions?”
“Oh I don’t give a fudge about political change,” Malfoy sighed as he set up the pawns on the chequered board, flicking one of knights on the head as the horse tried to bite his fingertip. “Not really. Politics was more my father’s game and look where that got him.”
“Sorry mate,” Ron gagged, pressing the back of his freckled hand to his mouth and reaching blindly for his can of ginger ale that was now becoming necessary for their daily assignment.
“First round in the Leaky says it’s soup,” Ron nodded thoughtfully. “Even the ferret’s got to eat more than a single mush filled sandwich and few grapes.”
“Well that explains his bad mood,” Harry responded, raising his hand to knock on the office door.
“I need more wine,” Draco sighed, reaching across everybody to nab the bottle, table manners be damned.
Draco’s eyes twinkled before pointedly darting to Harry’s crotch.
“Oi!” an indignant voice came from behind them. “I heard that!”
“Oh,” Draco replied, he’d had no idea.
“Plus,” Malfoy sighed, looking down despondently at his stew, “half the workers at the Ministry would probably revolt if we didn’t get our daily fix of Harry Potter’s thick arse.”
“No – wasn’t it
“I, um, I wasn’t necessarily, I just thought it might be nice to finger you whilst I jerked you off?” Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Yes,” Draco agreed thoughtfully with Magalie, the less ammo he gave Potter’s friends to tease him with, the better. Not that he was necessarily expecting mocking, I mean it was Potter after all who had made a point to say that they were all adults now. Draco stopped for a moment to mull over whether Potter had said that as a warning to
“You’ve always wanted to be a curse breaker,” Philippe nodded, his eyes twinkling, it reminded Draco vaguely of Potter but he tried to shake those thoughts away.
“Yes, magical creatures’ bones to be precise,” Luna elaborated, “I contributed to a book on them you see so I thought it might be good conversation.”
“Only about a week mate, honestly – it’s like my sister doesn’t even trust her own family!”
“Even in the winter?” Draco frowned.
“If you’re sure?” Ron asked with a hopefully expression as Harry nodded firmly.
“Blimey,” Harry murmured, “is he related to –“
“And we all know Harry’s word is law around here,” Winshaw winked. Harry bristled and snapped his head towards the other man.
“Children don’t have nemeses Draco, they have sticky fingers and chicken pox,” Odette interrupted.
“Were you on stake out last night Boot?” Ron asked, fixing himself a cup of coffee.
“It’s beautiful isn’t it?” Harry grinned, sliding his gaze to Draco. “You can see why no one ever wants to come hang out at my place now right?”
The first thing Draco did upon returning home was double strengthen all his wards. Undoubtedly if he had been in Draco’s memories for a month then Harry would know where he lived. Draco made absolutely sure that no one could get within a foot of the front door before sitting down on his sofa.
“Sounds great,” Harry beamed. Out of all of Ginny’s boyfriends he had always liked Samuel the most. The other man was a physical therapist for professional quidditch players and had a calm and quiet demeanour. “I actually did find out about it before I saw the invite though – Luna told me.”
“Terrible pun mate,” Ron shook his head as Hermione sealed up the gouge before vanishing the blood and muck from Harry’s torso.
“Yes,” Draco whispered, sticking out his tongue to trace a circle around Harry’s nipple, wetting the hair there.
“I mean,” Harry made a noise of embarrassment, “I live alone, so I don’t really care how I’m dressed.”
!” Malfoy declared. “Potter and Weasley, I mean can they do no wrong? You should have seen them, surrounded by adoring fans and trigger happy photographers.”
“Happy birthday Draco,” Harry said quietly as the room dissolved into giggles and badly sung snatches of French songs.
“I’m not a merman!” Hugo screeched, half tipping over Harry’s shoulder to kick his legs out of the water. “Look – I’ve got feet!”
“So,” Harry grinned, giving Draco’s hand another affectionate squeeze, “on a scale of one to ten, how much did you enjoy that?”
~**~**~
Harry tried to flick a load of bubbles that had landed on the floor back at Malfoy’s smirking face.
Harry yelped in surprise as Malfoy spat out his name. He wheeled around, there was no way that Malfoy’s memory could have sensed him there. He glanced back at the man in question, Malfoy, though, was still hunched over the papers, scribbling furiously and not paying Harry any mind at all.
“Right!” a booming voice echoed across the room signaling that the meeting was about to start. “If you’ve quite finished with your tea party Auror Weasley?”
“It’s fine Potter,” Draco sighed, deciding he was feeling generous and to put Potter out of his misery sooner rather than later.
Ron looked surprised before shaking his head, “Yeah but Malfoy was always good at occlumency wasn’t he? Powerful occlumens can fight off the effects of the potion by confusing their own mind.”
“That was quick,” Philippe chortled, “you haven’t even signed a contract yet.”
“Merlin’s
“Why do you ask?” Andromeda reached for another biscuit, gesturing for Harry to do the same.
Harry grimaced, “Is any water you put in it still charmed to come out milk coloured?”
“Draco!” Magalie cried as she appeared, her smiling face turning to confusion. “Ah, but you are wearing your best outfit – are you leaving already? You only just activated me.”
“I know that,” Harry nodded.
“What the hell am I doing?” he muttered. It must have been a moment of insanity that caused him to volunteer to spend more time with Harry Potter, the man who had perused through Draco’s intimate moments like they were scenes in a pitiful soap opera.
“You know I’ve never – “ Malfoy tutted before reaching for his wand, flicking it around with his wrist and muttering something under his breath that Harry couldn’t catch. A moment later Magalie seemed to fizzle transparent before reappearing in a slightly different pose.
“Not good news?” Harry frowned. Normally, Malfoy always seemed slightly cheered by correspondence with his mother. Harry got up and went to see if he could peer inside the card, curiosity getting the better of him, however it was angled in such a way that it was impossible to make out anything other than the first line which read, ‘
something else.”
foot?!”
Harry recalled back at school Malfoy would regularly receive packages of lotions and creams from France, Italy, Korean and occasionally Japan. Now the only mail Malfoy received from abroad were apparently the monthly supply of Pop Up Pals and handwritten letters from his mother.
“How long does it take to wear off?” Draco frowned as a young boy started terrorising his sister by stealing all the food of her plate with his new found extremity, like a frog might gobble up flies.
“Yes,” Draco agreed, looking down at the cream coloured carpet and wondering if it was wise to try and eat their burgers in there.
~**~**~
“Anyone up for another jug of Pimms or shall we just get a round of ale in?” a man that Draco recognized as Dean Thomas called out. Draco blinked to see that they had indeed depleted the previously very full jug of fruit filled alcohol. Had that much time passed already? It had actually been quite pleasant after all.
“I see,” Draco nodded, his shoulders seeming to relax. “My family and I went to a winter solstice wedding once, they can be exceedingly beautiful.”
“Sorry Harry!” the boy called back.
“As if you’d dare manhandle me,” Draco sniffed, delicately dipping his toes in the water and finding it to be adequately warm. A second later, however, a swarm of screaming youngsters sprinted past in pursuit of an oddly shaped squat creature that Draco would later discover had been an irate garden gnome. One of the teenagers knocked into the back of Draco, sending him toppling forwards into the pool.
Harry nodded politely to the passing witches and wizards, some of whom greeted him by name. He had already said hello to Arthur Weasley who had informed Harry that he was very much looking forward to the big upcoming party at Ron and Hermione’s.
“Merlin, I miss holidays,” Malfoy murmured, scooping out the contents of a stock pots into a saucepan of simmering water. “When I was younger we never missed a ski season, used to reserve a joint chalet in Courcheval with the Goyles,” Malfoy let out a barking laugh. “You should have seen Goyle on skis, Circe’s tits it was like someone had strapped oiled planks to a mal-coordinated troll.”
“I think I’ve just been offered a job!” Draco burst out, rocking agitatedly on his heels.
Harry watched as a spasm passed across Malfoy’s otherwise controlled expression.
~**~**~
“Thank god,” Harry replied bluntly, “I was getting sick of hearing about her Tuscan villa holiday.”
“Luna was a Ravenclaw,” Harry smiled sheepishly and ran his fingers through the untameable raven mess that he called hair. It was predictably glossy and thick despite Potter probably lathering it daily with hand soap Draco lamented bitterly. “And Hannah was a Hufflepuff, but actually I don’t think she’ll be down this week, she’s got her sister over from Belgium.”
“Such as?” Ron prompted as an alarming crunching and squelching sound emanated from the now dimly glowing fish tank.
?” a high voice pierced through the atrium as Hermione emerged from the lift in her green St. Mungo’s uniform. Harry recalled that she had apparated over to the Ministry after receiving Ron’s patronus.
“Shit!” Harry swore as a forkful of his pad thai ended up on his clothes.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded enthusiastically, “Hermione’s working on a weather charm so there’s going to lots of settled snow and Molly’s already banging on about winter foliage centrepieces, I never knew there were so many types of variegated holly. Mind you, Luna keeps telling us holly’s infested with jumping nargles, which apparently are
Draco tutted and pushed the other man’s fingers away before sitting up, effectively depositing an amused looking Harry on his lap before he began tugged at Harry’s shirt, indicating he wanted it gone.
“Yes,” Luna smiled sweetly, “I wrote the chapter about snallygaster wishbones.”
Harry burst out laughing as the vision of a horrified Lucius Malfoy with bird poop dribbling down his pristine blond locks flashed across his eyes.
be. He supposed he had always figured the other man would have wanted to be a businessman of some sort, or perhaps work in finance or as a minister. If the War hadn’t happened of course.
could make a scuffle with a giant sea serpent sound dull,” Malfoy scoffed with a sigh, shaking his head down at what Harry now realised, was one of his own case reports.
“Okay, we’ve got a lead on the Moreton-in-Marsh incident,” Ron came striding in through the doorway. “Apparently the portkey has been traced to Salcome and then there was a redirection to Toulouse which confused the – Harry?”
Harry snorted affectionately as the two of them traipsed into the kitchen and Malfoy flicked his wand so as to start the kettle boiling.
“You have a garden?” Hermione’s nose crinkled like it always did when offered a new piece of information as if her brain was indignant she didn’t already know that fact.
“Um,” Harry laughed nervously, “well I kind of really like you?”
“I mean that interview he gave the Prophet about not finding school games challenging enough,” Malfoy sneered. “Maybe that’s because the Gryffindor team at the time had
“I um, I didn’t see it actually,” Harry scratched the back of his head, “I just heard Malfoy mention it.”

don’t want to know,” she stated solemnly.
“No one needs to hear about what you keep in your pants Harry,” George snorted loudly as he hurried past them chasing after the garden gnome who appeared to have nicked a popsicle. Harry could vaguely hear the traumatized wails of a child in the background.
put out by having to wait for an extra thirty seconds for the floo. “One of the new flavours is fig.”
He quickly cast a cleaning spell over his garments. He hadn’t wanted to linger any longer at the Ministry, so had saved the task for the comfort of his own home. Besides, Draco had a reason to hurry home today. Today was Thursday and that was the expected arrival date for his delivery from
“Promise,” Harry grinned, “and my least flattering shirt.”
It had taken Draco a while to actually let himself converse with the ‘Pop Up Pals’ as one might another real human being. He had felt so foolish about the whole damn thing. But gradually, after the first time Magalie had asked him how his day went, or Lisette had giggled at his puffed up auror impression, Draco had realised his loneliness suddenly felt a lot more manageable.
“I might give it a little time,” Harry replied as Ron’s face cleared into a look of relief.
Half the Ministry were probably laughing their socks off at Draco’s expense right about now. This was one of the reasons he had allowed himself to take a few days off before returning back to work. He would just have to be composed in the wave of their jeers, scathing looks were nothing new anyway. Malfoys always knew how to keep their heads held high.
“What if he saw me on the toilet?” Draco cried, ignoring the strange looks the nearby muggles were shooting them.
“It’s good your stomach’s feeling better,” Harry commented as he watched Malfoy open up his lunchbox, which was lacking the usual prune addition. “You know you really should try eating in the canteen some day, they’ve got a good selection for different food allergies and intolerances. Actually they do a wicked slice of gluten free apple pie.”
Malfoy cleared his throat and Harry’s eyes were drawn to where he was pulling down his left sleeve like a nervous tic. The cufflinks already ensured the sleeve would never roll up, not that it would have even without them and Harry wondered if Malfoy even noticed he was doing it?
Draco walked over beside Harry and peered out to see that several guests now had foot long tongues dyed in shades of raspberry blue.
“Draco!” Harry yelled as he trod water with a giggling Hugo Weasley using him like jungle gym. “Save me will you? I’m being dragged down to the depths by this vicious little merman!”
Tonight’s dinner was going to be a choice between Lebanese or Indian. Harry was torn between the incredibly good tabbouleh he knew he fancied and the palak paneer he was simultaneously craving. He was half considering just ordering from both and hoping the delivery guys turned up at different times when the fireplace floo chimed.
“Oh no,” Magalie sighed as she fizzled into place in the living room and took one look at Draco. “Oh, mon chéri, I’m so sorry.”
“Weasley’s burgers better be impeccable,” Draco muttered as he grabbed his wand from the nearby table and pulled his T-shirt back on.
Draco tensed, he could feel Harry looking at him.
It was already gone midday when he spotted Harry again, the other man having stripped down to his swim shorts and now dive bombing into the pool, much to the delight of a gaggle of squealing children.
“An albatross pooped on Lucius Malfoy’s head once,” Harry blurted out as Luna paused and turned her owlish blue eyes towards him.
“And I’m
he would put some pizzazz into that report. He would probably use a few extended metaphors to really ham it up, maybe a sprinkling of harmless hyperbole.
“I mean, unless, maybe the ferret’s been really insulting to him or something?” Ron suggested. “Perhaps he tried it on with Ed’s girlfriend, what’s her name? Marlene?”
“Ah, I reckon most lads wanted to be an auror growing up didn’t they?” Matthew looked around the table at the blank responding faces.
“Nah,” Harry grinned, “this was a hand me down from my cousin Dudley. He went through a phase of thinking tie dye made him look edgy and would get all the girls.”
“If you’re going to be relying on business penmanship,” the woman finished for him with a wide smile. “I’m Odette by the way, Odette Seaver, I work in Legal Affairs.”
“I think I broke my arse,” Malfoy announced to the room at large, causing both men to start laughing again. “Oh Merlin and now I’m talking to myself,” Malfoy chortled, running his thin fingers down his face as the shower continued to splutter and steam behind them. “I’m going to have to check myself into St. Mungo’s for insanity and a broken bottom.”
“I wasn’t doing anything in the memories,” Harry muttered, “they were just me at home, getting takeout and spilling it down myself, arguing with Kreacher about throwing away that toilet plunger he’s so attached to –“
“Hi,” Harry cleared his throat.
~**~**~
Four hours later, Malfoy was still at his desk.
Ron had grinned in a chastised manner and rolled his eyes at Harry before allowing his Healer wife to finally apply soothing cream to his bright red arms. The bet that day had been who could stand itching powder on their robes the longest.
“Hmm,” Neville scratched his chin thoughtfully. “That’s a tricky one, there could be a variety of reasons. Are you mixing Hokkaido Honey in with the water when you spritz it?”
“Thank you for being with him to cook dinner,” Harry continued, “to watch Lilac Close. Thank you for complimenting him, for listening to him like he should be listened to. Thank you for singing with him, those old French songs that I now can’t get out of my head,” Harry laughed. “Thank you for being his friend when he needed you.”
Harry tucked his wand back into his robes before looking around. The room was lacking the usual faint purple haze, only a single candle hovering over in the corner of the room. Harry blinked a few times to accustom himself to the darkness. It was surprising Malfoy had fallen asleep already, he normally stayed up for at least another hour reading.
“Oh!” Draco exclaimed, suddenly remembering. “I have that book!
“Draco? Darling?”
“Alright then,” Harry said, brushing the crumbs of his recent pecan plait off his robes and getting up. It had only been five hours since he had last seen Draco but he was already missing the other man dreadfully. He couldn’t let that slip to Ron though or he would never hear the end of it.
“To be fair,” Harry grinned over the rim of his favourite mug, “Professor Wrigley
This year, it had been decided that Harry and Neville would hold a joint birthday garden party. Everyone had already pitched in enough galleons to buy a one day extension charm, allowing them to fit a swimming pool at the back of the garden. Ron had already purchased a suitably garish Hawaiian shirt ready for the occasion and was pre-polishing his barbeque.
“Shit, are you okay? I’m sorry,” a startled voice said as Draco turned round to see the concerned face of none other than the golden boy himself, Harry Potter. “Malfoy!” Potter exclaimed, his eyes widening ridiculously behind his wire frames.
Harry gestured frustratedly as Malfoy finally pulled his hands away from his face and stood up, walking back towards the kitchen.
“Yes,” Luna nodded with a wide smile. If you’re wondering how the black sand got there, I did too, until I studied snallygaster diets, the plimpies of the Chesapeake Bay area are actually migratory, swimming all the way from Saint Lucia in the spring time.”
Harry felt Ron grab his arm in a steadying motion as they were both deposited onto a familiar black slate floor. A moment later, there was a loud ding as four sets of elevators in front of them opened their doors into the Ministry’s main atrium.
“Change of plan,” Draco stated, summoning a book from over in the corner and dimming the lights until only the candle on the wall above the bed was still flickering. “I’m going to read for a little bit. Did you want to borrow a book or something?”
Draco apparated home before allowing himself to ask the question that had been on the tip of his tongue. Was Harry trying to be
When Draco was ready, Harry lined himself up and slowly inched inside. Draco clenched his jaw at the intrusion, it hurt and he had to ask the other man to stop a few times which Harry readily did.
“You know I was,” Harry rolled his eyes. “You must have heard me yelling all over the house.”
The strange thing was, that the odd little run ins with Potter kept happening, even at the weekend. Draco had never before encountered Potter whilst out and about in wizarding London and yet now here he was again, standing in front of Draco in Banbury Cheese bookshop with a dopey smile on his face.
“Don’t even get me started on Dexter Ashford,” Malfoy snorted.
Of course Draco knew they weren’t real. That was the point of these charms. You didn’t buy them if you already actually
“Well I think it’s lovely you’re spending time with Draco,” Luna declared, stacking their empty pots together and sending them over to the washing area.
“Maybe you should,” Harry suggested, glancing over at Draco with an unreadable expression. Harry’s gold rimmed glasses were slipping slightly down his nose and Draco’s fingers itched to reach out and push them back up. “I think it’s probably time don’t you? I see Andromeda fortnightly for afternoon tea and Teddy’ll be back from Hogwarts for the summer soon, maybe you could join me at some point?”
“Excuse me, I need the rosemary,” Malfoy declared mid way through Magalie’s excited speech about some new range of professional stationary, which seemed like an odd thing for her to be interested in in Harry’s opinion but then again her and Malfoy must have some common ground. A moment later, however, all reason seemed to go out the window when Malfoy reached his pale arm, the jumper sleeve rolled up, straight through Magalie’s abdomen.
A momentary flash of hurt passed across Potter’s features before his cheerful grin was back, albeit a little tighter. The change made Draco’s insides wobble with something akin to regret.
“I’m sure we would have been the same,” Draco sighed. “Or rather, you and your gaggle would have.
“Let’s just get this over with,” Harry muttered, taking a step towards the bowl and checking his notes. “Right, we’re going in on the twelfth of May.”
“Don’t,” Harry said darkly. “We will never talk of that again.”
“Oh you know,” Potter laughed, “playing exploding snap under the desks with Ron or Seamus, that sort of thing.”
“Oh yeah – Magalie’s favourite!” Harry grinned, clinking his glass against Draco’s.
“Bloody hell Malfoy, calm down,” Harry yelped as Malfoy walked straight through him in a bee line for the sofa, which, judging from the state of the cushions had already been searched.
After attaching his letter to the owl, Malfoy stood silently by the window for a few moments. Harry regarded the other man, the pale grey light from outdoors was casting his features in sharp relief. Malfoy’s grey eyes scrunched up slightly as the sun emerged from behind a cloud and lit up a section of dust particles floating in the air.
Harry couldn’t help himself letting out a surprised laugh. He took a few steps forward again and perched himself on the edge of Malfoy’s desk. “To be fair,” he grinned, “it was only a baby sea serpent, they’re like the size of single bed, and it wasn’t all that aggressive, I think it just had conjunctivitis.”
“Right,” Draco replied, his face was a furnace now.
It was Wednesday morning when Draco decided he was hallucinating again, despite the day not even being that hot. He came to this conclusion because Harry Potter was standing in front of his desk looking awkward and holding a cinnamon swirl out with a napkin.
“Alright lads,” Terry Boot yawned, walking over to them.
“What’s he like now?” Luna asked.
“I – “ Draco wasn’t sure what to say when Dean threw a straw over at Harry, breaking the moment.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, “that alright?”
Draco sighed as he closed the window in juddering jerks before tossing the letter onto the coffee table.
the one that reported Malfoy as having something to do with the Dark Ring?” Harry turned angrily on Winshaw, but the other man was already walking away, Marlene in tow.
Draco’s mouth fell open as he felt his balls tighten and a rushing sensation cresting in his cock. He bit down hard on the meat of Harry’s shoulder before coming all across the other man’s stomach, hot ropes spurting out in an almost painful orgasm.
. He must have watched Draco diligently applying re-growth potions every night before bed, measuring the shedding in his little diary that he kept in the bathroom cupboard.
Every other Wednesday after work, Harry made time to catch up with Luna when she was in the country. He was glad that they had agreed early on to do so because he wasn’t always the best at reaching out and he always tremendously enjoyed himself when he was with her.
Just at that moment, however, Draco caught a flurry of red robes out of the corner of his eye and quickly disabused himself of that notion. He kept his head firmly down on his way to the flight of spiral staircases that would take him further into the dingy depths of the institution.
“You’re flirting with me?” Draco wrapped his arms around his chest, feeling a little self conscious. “Why?”
Harry’s mouth fell open before the timer on his wand went off signaling the end of the working day. He pulled himself out of the memory, relief flooding over his senses as he clutched the side of the pensieve and turned to Ron.
“Yeah, fair,” Harry scratched the back of his head. “Okay, I, well I…I go to the pub!”
“Oi – watch it!” Ron yelled after him as Harry frowned.
Harry snorted, “
“Well we can’t all be posh and hairless,” Harry shifted uncomfortably, feeling a little embarrassed for his former self under Malfoy’s probable criticisms. After the removal of the horcrux, Harry’s body had enjoyed somewhat of a growth spurt. Along with new height and muscles, had also come a thatch of thick, coarse hair across his chest and down his stomach. Harry supposed Malfoy thought all men should be like Francis Featherhorn, waxed like a Malfoy Manor ballroom floor.
Outstandings?”
“You mean you’re worried all the biscuits will be gone,” Harry said dryly as he stood up all the same and followed Ron out of the office.
“That’s real?” Draco snapped, all his defensiveness momentarily forgotten. The Sorcha Curse was meant to turn six of your loved ones into swans and, until you had sewn six cloaks of stinging nettle leaves, they couldn’t be turned back into humans.
“Yes, I’ve been saving –“ Malfoy’s eyes widened and he closed his mouth with a painful sounding snap. “I’ve been saving reading it for a rainy day,” he concluded as Harry and the witch both turned to see the bright sunshine filtering in from outside.
“Sans doute,” Maglie nodded emphatically, “without a doubt.”
“Mm,” Philippe replied diplomatically.
“What’s he like now?” Hermione asked, she look a little nervous as if she was cross with herself for being just as curious as the rest of them.
“Oh god,” Draco gasped as they started to rock together, Harry thrusting into him as he rubbed at Draco’s cock with clever fingers. Draco moaned and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, lifting himself up as his hips were pinned against the mattress, Harry pounding with echoing grunts, it was primal and raw, their sweat soaked skin sticking to each other in a tight embrace.
“I don’t know why it’s done that,” Malfoy frowned indignantly at the plant, as if he couldn’t quite believe the audacity. He sighed, “I suppose you’re right, it’s just… I was never able to do anything I wasn’t good at.”
“Six,” Malfoy replied before wincing, as if he hadn’t been able to stop himself.
“I did it yesterday,” Harry replied with a face, joint cases with the Italian office were always a nightmare in terms of administration.
“Merlin,” Malfoy hissed, his eyes strangely focused on memory Harry’s chest.
Draco was enjoying finally having someone to talk to about quidditch, especially given the fantastic season the Falcons were experiencing. Apparently Matthew had been a Ravenclaw, two years ahead of Draco, whilst Meredith had been a Hufflepuff three years below, albeit known as Malcolm back then.
“Mourning, it’s the section on how to handle grief and loss of loved ones,” the witch nodded, “we stocked it up after the War.”
Harry knew that Bill was still a Curse Breaker, although he had cut down on his hours so as to be at home with his family more.
Harry was pretty sure Malfoy would have chosen the Dementor’s Kiss over Harry Potter being privy to such information.
Draco waited until the owl had flown off before ambling over to the window and jerking it open. No matter what he did, the wood of the sash always stuck, unless it was left open in the evening by mistake and then it would wait until you were suitably relaxed, drifting off into sleep before it would slam down with a vengeance.
The other man was in the process of pulling his shirt over his head, his glasses falling off onto the rug and his hair sticking up even more than usual.
“Oh no, nothing like that,” Ron replied, “I was just wondering what you’re doing tomorrow?”
“Harry, have you not checked you postbox recently?” she tipped her head again, jangling the daisy chain earrings she was wearing.
“Question Two – which French chanteuse famously sang
“Of course not,” Harry shook his head enthusiastically, “I haven’t even spoken to Bill since the pub, if he’s hiring you Draco it’s because he thinks you’re brilliant.” Harry grinned as he saw Draco’s cheeks flush, the other man seemed to be trying to contain a smile.
“Bloody French,” Ron muttered. Despite a lovely annual Burgundy holiday with the Weasleys, in this moment, Harry couldn’t help but agree. Cerisier and Laurent were completely out of order. Harry tried to squash down the niggling feeling that he might not have been so annoyed if the suspect in question wasn’t Draco Malfoy. After all, it had been Harry who had first suspected Malfoy of dark over a decade ago.
“Is this wais…” Draco trailed off wondering if he had actually passed out from the heat and was in fact keeled over on his desk whilst hallucinating that Harry Potter was asking about his clothes and complimenting him on his hair.
“Draco?”
They finally did depart for the Weasley-Granger abode, but only after another cheeky slice of cake. Draco looked up at the pretty Tudor style cottage with painted white between aged black beams. The house was quite long and a little uneven with gabled ends. The flowerbeds at the front were filled with colourful hollyhocks, lavender and delphiniums, a trailing trellis of white roses climbed up to the second floor windows. The porch jutted out with a space to leave wellington boots and a hedgehog shaped shoe brush. There was a curved steel hippogriff hoof shoe hanging above the entranceway, a popular superstition, and the front door was painted a jolly yellow.
story for the day?”
“Like the world’s most unappetizing Pick and Mix,” Harry commented dully as Malfoy finally seemed satisfied with his selection and went up the till.
“Oh!” Malfoy whimpered before whispering a spell that Harry couldn’t quite hear. What it did became evident a moment later, however, when Malfoy’s fingers turned wet and glistening. Malfoy grunted before rolling onto his side, facing Harry and swapping his hands. Harry could no longer see what Malfoy was doing with his arse but he had a pretty good idea as the other man’s mouth formed a perfect ‘O’ and his eyes flickered open, glazed over with blown pupils.
“Mr. Malfoy was very reticent, however, to allow us access to his memories,” Pewterfoot continued, ignoring Ron’s outburst.
“Merlin,” Draco gasped, this was far more exciting than all those saucy encounters he would read about in Witch Weekly. Harry appeared to be intent on devouring Draco whole, sucking and nipping at his skin whilst he used his other hand to press into the curve of Draco’s lower back, nudging them even closer.
“And this is a catastrophe how?” Magalie asked, pointing to Draco’s missing sock on the back of the rocking chair.
“God you’re gorgeous,” Harry whispered hotly into the sensitive shell of Draco’s ear. Draco shivered, levering the top half of his body round to catch Harry’s mouth in a messy kiss.
“Oh no!” Harry gasped. “That’s not what I meant – Ginny and I haven’t been together since school, Merlin no, she’s getting married to a bloke called Samuel in December.”
“Yeah,” Harry cleared his throat, “mine’s definitely not like that. It’s pretty clear he’s innocent.”
“Maybe the git doesn’t like lasagna,” Ron shrugged, peering over to look more closely at Malfoy’s sandwich. “I can’t even tell what the filling is – is that tuna?”
before setting between them and melting into the shape of a calligraphic ampersand.
“But why didn’t you put all that in your essay?” Draco asked Luna. “It would certainly clear a lot of criticisms up. I mean, not that I was criticizing your work, I mean…”
“Harry, hey Harry – you alright mate?” Ron caught up with him on the way back to their office.
“Hey, is that…” he began, shooting a cautious look at Draco.
It had been a custom order this time, three different colours for three different people. It had made the purchase more expensive but Draco was good with money, only splashing out when he wanted a treat. He glanced down at the key:
“Are you actually going to use me or have you decided to grow old on the doorstep?” a nasally voice questioned. Draco looked up to see that the doorknocker, which hung from a metal cast of a grotesque face was sneering down at him.
That was another thing that made Harry feel mildly guilty. Through Malfoy’s memories it had become obvious that the other man clearly missed living in a magical abode, often reminiscing about the enchantments soaked into the walls of the manor over centuries of use and exposure. Malfoy’s modest apartment was very much a new build with little of the history that Malfoy seemed to hold in such high regard.
“Bloody hell!” Ron exclaimed as a dark skinned woman in a green cardigan bounced into the kitchen. “I didn’t see any flatmates in the report? Is she his girlfriend?”
Harry turned to see a cheery looking Arthur Weasley shuffling out of one of the lifts before he waved to a colleague and hurried off in the direction of the Muggle Affairs offices.
Malfoy turned away from them to unbutton his robes, folding them neatly and stacking them on top of a set of shelves.
Harry observed Philippe carefully, it was the man’s first appearance in Malfoy’s provided memories. Philippe appeared to be a fair bit older than them, in his late forties or early fifties. He was handsome with salt and pepper hair and a trimmed beard. Since cracking open the yellow marble, Malfoy had spent most of his time with Philippe complaining about the inefficient bureaucratic systems of the Ministry.
“Yeah,” Harry smirked, “everyone knows they’re more like sizeable plums.”
“This kitchen has a seasonal charm on it,” Draco explained, it’s quite common in wizarding houses. Rooms change depending on the time of year. This wall is glitched between summer and winter. I imagine in the winter it probably has spare cabinets and maybe a tapestry but in the summer it should be…” Draco trailed off, sticking his tongue out as he reached around the back of the nearest surface, trying to find the charm trigger. Finally, his fingers closed around a small metal latch which he yanked forcefully.
“No,” Malfoy replied, his voice quiet as if not to disturb the other passengers. “I ordered it online from Tom de Plume, it’s a Tom Thursby original. You can get the calamus personalized for your grip style and select the density of afterfeather, I chose a thinner rachis because although you have to redo the self inking charm more often I find it’s nicer to have more weight at the tip if you’re going to be…” Malfoy trailed off, his face reddening as he realised his voice had gained in excited volume and everyone was now staring curiously at him.
“Who are you hiding from?” Harry frowned as the two of them peered around the corner together. Harry let out a surprised noise as he recognized himself stood about six feet away with his head tipped back and laughing. Memory Harry’s boots were caked with mud and Harry remembered this was the day he and Ron had chased the petty crook Fergus Dankworth through a field full of cows in Devon.
~**~**~
Harry took a deep breath before closing his mouth and bracing himself, looking back up at Draco. The other man’s eyes were wide and the corner of his mouth was twitching.
Draco snorted lightly, “Could have fooled me Potter, you must have sent me five parchments worth of notes since I was exonerated.”
~**~**~
wand!” he snapped his fingers. Magic, especially wandless magic, was more often than not, suppressed by being in a pensieve. The fast forwarding and pause charms had taken the Ministry years to actually develop. Despite wands in the memories not actually being the real physical things, they were designed as mental props in order to direct and focus the mind’s magical core. Harry knew his real wand was back in some Ministry office with Ron, for all and intents and purposes he shouldn’t
The back door was already propped open by a rather frightening ornamental sculpture of a snallgaster that Luna had gifted Harry for his birthday. Harry hissed as his bare feet hit the cold damp grass the lawn.
“Evidence Cataloguing is one floor up,” Draco stated slowly.
“Oh,” Harry paused, turning round to regard her with curiosity. “You guys managed to nail the people behind that?” The case had been taken up by a number of aurors as the illegal troll fights had also played host to a variety of dodgy gambling activities. Actually finding those accountable, however, had proven a little tricky due to the patronage of some rather influential wizards.
“Yeah I think so,” Harry nodded. “I mean I guess if you’ve already ordered the food…”
Harry exhaled through his nose in amusement, thinking of how the memory they had just come from had spent an hour at five am in Malfoy’s bathroom whilst he organized all his skincare potions by alphabetical primary ingredients.
’ which Harry promptly did, letting out a laugh as the broom folded open into a silhouette cut out scene of a quidditch pitch complete with charmed bludgers flying through hoops.
Harry’s mind flashed back to a haggard looking boy, dirty blond hair covering his sunken face as he stood in the accused box. For some reason, Harry remembered Malfoy’s hands, smudged with dirt from the Ministry’s overburdened holding cells after the War, long fingers trembling, blackened nails.
“I was pants at potions,” Harry snorted.
“Draco! We’re over here!” Potter called from a large table at the far end of the garden, before he came marching over with a pint of beer in his hand. His eyes immediately slid up and down the length of Draco’s body and Draco felt inordinately pleased he had convinced himself to don the jeans after all.
Harry chewed on his lip as he thought back to the pile of job offers he had received after the War. He had discarded them all of course, his heart set on becoming an auror with Ron.
“You were friends with the Hogwarts gamekeeper before coming to school?” Draco frowned, glancing round at Harry. The other man had peeled back the Tupperware lid and was sniffing the cake with a delighted expression.
“Did you read the spin off book
Malfoy took the book downstairs to the till where it was rung up at ten galleons, making Harry wince. That was nearly a week’s worth of groceries. Malfoy seemed to have been expecting the price, however as he calmly handed over the gold before the book was returned to him in a brown paper bag.
“You kind of…” Draco trailed off in amazement. Maybe he hadn’t been reading too much into things after all.
“Actually, I think it might just be a me thing,” Harry shrugged. “Ron waited seven years to propose to Hermione and they’d already had a kid together.”
“Hello,” Draco nodded warily. Harry absently noticed he was wearing purple fluffy slipper socks.
Draco hummed as he tapped his quill against a new roll of parchment, he wasn’t sure whether to tell his mother he had come down with a nasty case of mumblemumps or a vicious onslaught of spattergroit. The latter seemed extreme but he was having a hard time finding a reason as to why he wouldn’t have been able to write. In the end he settled for an unidentified infectious disease that wouldn’t have allowed the nurses to bring him quill or paper. It wasn’t too much of a stretch to then insinuate their incompetence, or prejudices, also caused them to neglect sending word to Narcissa.
“This was a trick,” Draco gasped, wheeling wildly around the table, they were all staring at him now. “Bloody hell you
“Bill Weasley, he’s one of the senior curse breakers at Gringotts – I had drinks with him this evening and at the end of it he told me if I was bored of the Ministry he’d be willing to take me on as an apprentice – I’d initially be hired as an external consultant but could do curse breaking training on the job and eventually qualify as one!”
As it turned out, Pewterfoot wasn’t even in the conference room yet, Penny informed them he was caught up on a firecall elsewhere.
“Maybe I’ll be able to convince them to go small this year,” Harry grinned.
“Honestly Ron, it’s okay,” Harry said, guiding his friend over to a wooden chair.
“I’m going now,” Draco announced in a shaking voice, turning on his heel and making a beeline for the exit. He stormed straight past the woman posing a question about the Bloodied Barnacle Ghost Ship mutiny of 1809, through the main body of the pub and out onto Pottleshot Lane.
“Probably because he saw two uniformed aurors approach him whilst he was in possession of illegal potions,” Harry replied sardonically. His right calf was cramping wickedly and he eventually admitted defeat and aimed a muscle relaxing spell at it.
“Oh that looks nasty!”
“Sir,” Harry leaned forwards, he didn’t really care anymore to be honest if the French wanted to take over the case. Besides, it sounded like it was going to lead them to Italy and the last time that had happened Harry and Ron had spent five weeks with little to no sleep in a grotty safe house without even a glimpse of the coliseum or a freshly cooked pizza. “What about Draco Malfoy? He’s clearly got nothing to do with this and should be released.”
“It’s not that,” Harry protested, “I actually find it kind of relaxing in there.” He looked up to see Ron eyeing him with a peculiarly disturbed expression.
“Excuse me?” Draco scrunched up his nose in confusion, it made him look slightly adorable. “What exactly are you wrapping? I certainly hope you don’t wrap birthday gifts up on the loo – that’s disgustingly unhygienic Harry.”
Pottleshot Lane was off the eastern side of Diagon Alley, connected to the main street by Culpepper Road. Draco watched the illuminated wooden sign sway slightly in the breeze before he worked up the nerve to push through the door.
“Oh,” Harry sighed, relaxing, “you met Dunstan. Yeah, I apologise for him. I’ve been trying to set up a door bell instead but the wood refuses to let me screw anything in.”
“I can assure you it is,” Draco sighed, “now if you will excuse me, I’m rather busy,” Draco lifted up his pile of papers pointedly, thanking the gods he had thought to bring them with him. He turned towards the canteen exit, deciding he would just have to try and locate Odette later.
“Do you want a cup of tea?” He asked, walking into the kitchen.
After having exhausted themselves by looking all round the house, Harry and Draco had ordered take out, which Draco still maintained was sacrilege when you had a kitchen like Harry’s, before they had settled down in the brown living room.
“Oh for –“ Potter made a frustrated tutting sound, “it’s for you, you sarcastic berk.”
“Are you really okay with me staying?” Harry asked.
Later that evening, after exiting the memory and finishing his paperwork, Harry joined the rest of the usual gang in the pub. This week, drinks were being held at the slightly fancier Pickle and Pear on account of Seamus celebrating a promotion at work. Harry laughed along with the others as Seamus grumbled half heartedly at being expected to pay for everybody’s drinks as a result.
Draco grinned as he settled down in the armchair and summoned a notepad, he was already bursting with possible ideas they could try.
“Alright Ron?” Harry peered over the top of his glasses as his friend’s face materialized in the flames.
Harry shivered involuntarily. After the war, there had been plenty of nut jobs attempting one dark ritual or another in order to try and bring Voldemort back. He knew it was impossible but still, the idea that anyone would even
“No?” Harry enquired. “What about Thailand then?”
“Nah, just a late one with some old mates – Michael Corner was there actually, says he saw you lot at the Hairy Gooseberry a while back.”
“Draco was saying something about using their silver for curses,” Harry continued cheerfully, unaware of the desperate remorse and unwarranted forgiveness that had just passed between the two men.
“No,” Draco held out his hand whilst wiping his eyes with the other. “I can die happy now, now I know what Harry Potter sounds like when he’s taking a dump.”
“I’ve seen him sleeping with that thing,” Ron’s eyes widened, “sometimes if you walk past his cupboard you can hear really weird rubbery sounds –“
He glanced around the cramped, windowless space and wondered how he would feel if the only adventures he had were through someone else’s badly written accounts.
Over the last year there had been a resurgence of illegal potions operations with many contraband elixirs smuggled between London and Paris. Harry and Ron were the lead aurors for the British side of things but so far, despite several undercover operations, had come up short on any hard evidence, aside from bringing in a low level dealer a week previous. The French aurors assigned to the case, Cerisier and Laurent had arrived a couple of days later and yet had already dropped a number of not too subtle criticisms about the DMLE’s handling of the operation.
“Did Potter put you up to this?” were the first words out of Draco’s mouth, he fidgeted nervously under the table.
“If you must know, I need to adjust my swimshorts,” Draco explained stiffly, “I haven’t worn them since my last holiday with mother to the French Riviera and that was many years ago. They’re a little…tight.”
“No, it’s quite alright,” Luna smiled, “I wanted to save it you see, I’m writing my own book and I thought it would be good material.”
to come into work,” Harry replied as his friend laughed and shook his head in disbelief.
“Hey mate,” Ron smiled, laughing as Hugo pushed his way onto his father’s lap and waved enthusiastically at Harry.
“I blooming know what it is!” Ron blustered. “And I’ve got plenty of people to play chess with without resorting to Draco Malfoy thank you very much.”
“I like your hair,” Harry snapped, looking fierce. “And I’d say that a whole sodding lot has changed in thirteen years, and for the better.”
“The same couldn’t be said for all the aurors,” Odette pointed out, “surely you must be a little relieved that it was him?”
Ron cleared his throat before folding up the map and plonking himself down on his lumbar support swivel chair that had been a present from Hermione. “You submitted Malfoy’s release forms?”
“And you do the rest of the time?” Draco questioned with faux innocence.
Draco sat up as Harry busied himself with the pot of lube, casting cleaning and protection spells on them both. Draco manoeuvred back up the bed and laid down against the pillow where he figured it would be more comfortable, his erection had wilted slightly with nerves.
“Good evening Draco,” she smiled back. “Maybe in our thirties we could stretch to using first names?”
“Teddy played Draco, on account of them being related apparently. It was great,” Seamus snorted, “he morphed his hair into white blond and made his face all pointy.”
“Absolutely starving!’ She announced and as if on cue, her stomach rumbled.
“To be honest,” Ron hiccoughed, “as much as I don’t like Malfoy, he really doesn’t seem to be involved in an international potions smuggling ring.”
Draco found himself upside down in a medley of disorientating bubbles before strong arms closed around his waist and hauled him upwards. Draco gasped as he and Harry breached the water’s surface and emerged back into the sunshine and general noises of the party.
“So he maintained his innocence even on the potion?” Harry asked as Pewterfoot confirmed his suspicions.
,” Malfoy muttered, sticking his thin fingers into the creases of the furniture and bringing nothing back up but a couple of sickles. “Damn it!” Malfoy shrieked, his chest was panting as he slumped down on to the carpet and put his head in his hands.
“Has somebody put you up to this Potter?” Draco questioned with a sneer that he hoped covered his complete and hopeless confusion. “Marlene or –“
He sighed before putting the card away and reaching for the small pile of concerned letters he had found from his mother waiting in the mailbox. Incarcerated for an entire bloody month or thereabouts and the Ministry hadn’t even thought to let Draco’s only remaining close family know that he was okay.
“That was a Saturday,” Ron pulled a face.
“No point in wearing them if you’re not going to get wet,” Harry shrugged, flicking his hand across the pool’s surface a sending a spray of droplets against Draco’s pale legs. Draco chewed on the inside of his cheek as he glanced around.
“Maybe I should have moved abroad like Mother,” Draco sighed. “Somewhere further than France though, where nobody knows the Malfoy name or what the Dark Mark means.”
“Can’t imagine the Malfoys are too popular nowadays,” Harry added, “could just be someone trying to fling a bit of mud and see if it sticks?”
“Friends with Potter? Good lord no, I don’t even speak to –“ Draco trailed off, “well, I mean he brought me a cinnamon swirl this morning but that was quite out of the ordinary.”
Harry accidentally inhaled a large sip of his pumpkin juice and spent the next two minutes being aggressively hit on the back by a wheezing Ron.
“Bakery and then home I think,” Malfoy sighed, staring up at the clear blue sky with cheerful tufts of white cotton clouds.
Malfoy was busy scribbling a note with his accioed quill when the owl started tapping on the window to announce its arrival.
Harry jumped back as Malfoy wheeled about, looking distraught before charging back into the living room.
Suddenly, a low moan came from over by the bed.
Harry followed Ron down one of the longer corridors until emerging into a small manicured atrium around which several department heads’ offices were located.
“Right,” Ron nodded, every ounce of confusion he was feeling clearly etched across his face. Ron had never been able to mask his thoughts very well, it was one of the reasons Harry tended to lead point in interrogations.
“Oh,” Ron’s face lit up delightedly, “
Draco hung back a little as various clusters of guests came up to greet Harry.
