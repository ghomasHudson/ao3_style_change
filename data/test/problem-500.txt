“Don’t talk about that now, you’ll ruin Christmas for me,” he murmurs sleepily into Harry’s neck. “Tell me what you’re giving me.”
“—despite you all being such insufferable nosy gits, so there,” Draco is saying now with the air of having agreed very generously to endure something rather painful.
Yes, he’s one of us now, lift your jaw up off the floor and no, don’t roll your eyes – it’s really not
They panted softly at each other, Draco frowning, angling forward for more, and Harry pulling back gently with a small smile that clearly indicated that he had something on his mind.
“Potter,” Malfoy’s voice comes out a breathless whisper, his arse tightening around Harry’s cock as he shudders and gasps. “Fuck, please, Potter—”
Because this Scorpius was clearly Malfoy’s son. The longer Harry looked at him, the clearer it became. The kid had the exact same pointed nose and chin, grey eyes, and flaxen hair that shone under the moonlight. What he lacked was the arrogant, slightly malevolent air Malfoy had always carried. He was staring at Harry almost fearfully but behind it, Harry could see the worshipful admiration he had grudgingly grown accustomed to over the past fifteen years.
to them?” Draco’s face is twisted into an ugly sneer as he shouts, spittle flying and eyes flashing.
Harry felt emotionally and physically drained. The thought of getting up and seeing to his kids, not to mention coming up with a plan of action for the rest of the day – for the rest of their foreseeable future – seemed like an impossible task to achieve.
!” he says forcefully, with not a trace of shame or hesitation, his hand coming to rest on his stomach for the first time since they’d arrived, his robes folding in around the round bump. Narcissa lets out a small gasp, her hands flying up to cover her mouth and Lucius looks absolutely stupefied as he
I’m so fucking uncomfortable as I look down at my new formal shirt. “New, yes. Do you like it?” I ask smiling too widely.
There’s the faint, rattling breath of something inhuman echoing around the room when he crawls back into consciousness, a feeble croak sounding every now and then. He’s way too hot, his skin feeling scalded, and his insides feel wrung out. He’s shaking against something very warm and pliant, his cock compressed in gripping, wet heat that further tightens around him every few seconds. His whole being feels wrecked, as though he’d gone out into a hurricane unprotected, got violently thrown about, and has to now pick himself back up even as the storm still lingers, looming right over him.
“I’m sure you’ll eat several others’ shares as well,” Lucius says pointedly, giving Draco a deliberate once over.
It was a long, wide room, completely bare. More torches burned at intervals along the walls and as Harry watched, Malfoy stood at one of the arched windows in the walls, wand raised and muttering warding spells.
“Because you’ve been watching,” Potter says simply, gesturing to the Patronuses that are still gambolling around. Granger’s otter is racing her boyfriend’s fluffy terrier and said boyfriend is bellowing as his conjured animal loses spectacularly.
He’s left a large, horribly vivid red bite mark on Malfoy’s nape. It oozes lightly, the skin only just broken so that the punctures are already clotting rather than bleeding freely. It’s purpling around the edges of where Harry’s canines sunk in and the skin all around the bite is bright pink.
“You’re not my lover,” Draco informs him at once, even as his heart leaps in his chest. He’s suddenly very aware of how
think that’s complete rubbish,” Weasley adds then, and with no small amount of relish. “It’s barely even been a month since you both started—” he waves one large hand carelessly, “—doing whatever it is you both are doing. That’s not love, that’s just plain old randiness.”
Harry grins, tucking the covers more securely under them and drawing Draco even closer so that they were jammed together impossibly close. Kissing Draco’s nose in a quick peck, he says, “Took you long enough then,” grinning at Draco’s initial bewilderment and then guffawing at his flushed scowling. “Happy Christmas to you too,” he murmurs against his mouth.
Potter juts his chin out, that look of aggravating stubbornness creeping in. “You’re a smart man, Malfoy. What do you
Draco smiles unexpectedly. “You’re lucky I’m in such a good mood, you ginger wazzock. Or I’d be wrapping up your bollocks in a little red ribbon right now for Granger to put in a jar on the mantle.”
Then I lean in and kiss him again, softly and briefly. “’night,” I say, nuzzling his temple and planting a kiss there too.
“I’ll take a neat whiskey if you don’t fucking mind,” Draco spat, wondering why he was getting more and more irritated by the second. Maybe it was just his natural reaction to being around Harry Potter.
.” Draco grins, slapping Ron across the head with the gloves and earning a sharp yelp. “Besides, the bet wasn’t my idea, and honestly who bets on the bloody Canons against Pudd. United?!” he chuckles, coming over to steal my bottle, chugging half the water in one gulp. He swallows noisily, wipes a hand across his mouth and continues, “Your sister plays professionally! Really, Ronald, you ought to know better.” He nicks my towel to wipe his face.
“Thank you,” Potter interrupts softly, his gaze still burning but in a different way now; there’s suddenly something unimaginably tender in the vivid greenness and for a moment Draco is just left gaping at the honesty there.
“Nothing,” he says at once, mouth curving into a dead, thin-lipped smile that makes the hair on Harry’s nape stand up. “I can find my way back just fine if you have plans with your girlfriend.”
at Potter’s chest. “I know some people are into that stuff,” Potter adds, panting now as he bats away Draco’s hand.
“It was not ten minutes!” Harry says loudly, swelling angrily. “More like...twenty, I dunno,” he mumbles, deflating abruptly. “I dunno, okay, he was just—fuck, I can’t tell you if it was the booze or what but he was—there was something
Finally, the water turns clear as it burbles down the drain and Draco shuts it off with a careless flick of his hand, stepping out onto the bathmat, fetching a towel and vigorously drying Harry off before letting him step out as well, patting himself dry carelessly as they make their way out to their bedroom.
Everyday Draco stands before the mirror and inspects the way his hips have thickened and how his belly is soft, a bit flabby, and still bears the faded scar from where they’d cut him open to pull Lyra out almost a year ago. He thinks, now, of how he’s been very careful never to change or get undressed in Harry’s presence, how they’ve kept the lights off the scant few times they’ve made love since Lyra was born, how he always squirms away when Harry goes to run his hands over him proprietarily, how he’s quick to make an excuse to escape the room whenever they’re alone.
“He’s different now, alright?” he says quietly, resisting the temptation to steal another glance at Malfoy. “It didn’t end for him after the War. He’s been through some shit.”
Harry grins. “Loosen the fuck up, you tosser,” he laughs, “I’ve already had a room prepared for you but I have twelve other bedrooms you can pick from if you want. Now come here and hold my arm so I can Apparate us.”
He can hardly stand it now, to watch Malfoy grind against that bloke with the earring, turning around in his arms to press back into him and rock his arse against his groin, arms in the air as the man brazenly yanks Malfoy’s sheer, cream shirt out of his trousers and shoves his hand up inside, stroking his stomach and chest.
Twisting his face into the best sneer he could muster, given the circumstances, Draco calmly flipped him off, making Potter burst out into a delighted chuckle, and then turned around and walked away determinedly, grinning foolishly to himself once he was a safe distance away.
“Thanks a lot, Father,” Draco grumbles as he gives up and goes back to his own lunch. “I told you she wouldn’t eat if you give her chocolate so close to lunchtime.”
“I know, I’m sorry I was late getting back,” Harry says. “We missed our Portkey and had to wait for another.”
“Did I in any way imply that you have?” Harry asks exasperatedly. “Malfoy, if I was worried enough to illegally track an owl to find out where you live, so just imagine how much more annoying I’m going to get as this pregnancy proceeds.”
“Because we’re going to have a baby,” Harry nods, swallowing as he steps forward a few paces. “Because we’re going to be
“Which ferret?” he asked before turning around and running, laughing, all the way to their bedroom, Draco spitting expletives as he chased him, flinging dirty socks at him the whole way.
Because the next second Harry had grabbed him by one arm and dragged him to the counter, twisting his arm and pressing it to his back, grabbing the bathrobe and flinging it into the sink. Placing one hand just below Draco’s nape, Harry shoved him forward, bending him over, and without any sort of warning kicked Draco’s legs wide apart.
Hunching over his desk, Draco writes back now telling Granger how stupid her idea of giving Potter some Muggle device called a
Harry’s breath is leaving him in rattling wheezes now, his whole body vibrating, shrill static filling his head as rational thought evaporates and leaves behind nothing but the fiery need to
James thundered inside and Harry sprinted after him, his panic enough to mask the mild twinges of discomfort in his ankle.
“Shut up,” Draco replies and Potter chuckles, sitting down beside him and lifting one ankle onto a knee, arms slung loosely over his legs. He’s not bundled up like Draco is, although he
Ron makes a sappy, crooning sound and I want to kick him as he gets up to snog her shamelessly, Hermione laughing under her breath and pushing him away with a fond grin after a few seconds.
“You, um...” He licks his lips, his chest rising and falling as he pants soundlessly. “You really don’t want to stay?”
at Draco, her expression pleasant and open, and Draco doesn’t want to admit how that sight makes him feel slightly relieved. With a little effort, he forces his lips to curve upwards in what passes as a polite smile.
Grinning at Draco’s haughty sneer, Harry gathered him up in a sudden tackle and kissed him deeply. Simultaneously attempting to pat his hair into place, Draco kissed him back with a low hum, pushing his tongue in under Harry’s and gently nibbling on his lower lip.
Harry watched in perplexed amusement as the boy dug around in his pocket and pulled out a rumpled handkerchief, dabbing his eyes primly.
Each time the cockhead pulls out of his throat, Draco seals his lips around the shaft and sucks noisily, hard enough that it leaves Potter whimpering under his breath. His thighs quake as he pulls out only long enough to rub the spongy, dribbling glans over Draco’s cheeks and down over his chin, leaving shiny streaks of slick, before easing back in and carrying on fucking his face.
“Er... Yeah, I don’t think so, ‘Mione.” Potter doesn’t look at her as he speaks, half turning away and partially hiding his face as he mops it with one end of the towel.
Potter grins slightly but it’s only after several more beats of painful hesitation that he speaks. “Why...were you living in that—living there, Malfoy?” he asks carefully. “How did you land up there?”
He’d learnt many things about Harry Potter in the seven months they’d been... ‘together’ – things he hadn’t picked up during the seven years spent antagonising him.
Draco spins around on one heel, juvenile glee coursing through him at the prospect of making a dramatic exit—
“Er...” he looks away quickly, pouring Draco’s tea, “No, actually, Hermione said you’re underweight, remember?”
We decorate the tree together. Afterwards, I help Hermione put up lights outside and then decorate some more inside the house while Ron makes pasta. We’ve just hung up the stockings when he announces lunch is ready. It feels good to spend time with them, just like old times; just the three of us. It’s always been effortless to be with them. Things have always felt like they’re right where they’re meant to be when I’m with Ron and Hermione.
Ron scrambled into attention; sitting up with his spine stiff, blue eyes popping, mouth twitching on the very verge of a grin. Hermione looked up very slowly, a slight pink tinge appearing on her cheeks as she put her quill down and laced her fingers together in a rather businesslike fashion.
Harry’s insides feel liquefied by the blistering fury that instantly tears through him, his skin burning red-hot, his head feeling like it might just burst. Full-body shudders leave him momentarily unable to do much besides try and catch his balance but, try as he might, he’s unable to draw in a full breath.
Ron chokes on his first sip of beer, Dean leans dangerously far back on his stool to stare incredulously at Draco, Seamus looks at him with his eyebrows somewhere up near his hairline, and I feel my bottle slipping from my suddenly clammy grasp.
“When did you both leave?” Malfoy demands right away, his chin trembling for a beat before he firms it. “
“Are you coming back in there,” he jerks his head in the direction of the club, “or do I tell everyone you left?”
. I’ve just spent five days tugging at my now permanently erect penis and my wrist hurts and my balls ache but otherwise, I’m
Something sharp and hard seems lodged in Draco’s throat and he gulps desperately, trying to blink away the burn behind his eyelids. “You—You haven’t
“Good to see you, Gin,” I say softly, the familiar flowery scent of her soothing me somewhat. “Good game last week, I believe?”
Harry, evidently on his way to investigate the source of all the screaming and clanging, froze in his tracks in bewilderment when Draco burst out of the bedroom, emitting shrill war-cries as he ran after Moody who was, of course, headed right for the kitchen, Draco’s robes sliding along behind him.
“I’ll go get cleaned up then,” he finally says, swinging his arms awkwardly. “Need another shower,” he adds lamely, wiping at the drying tackiness on his stomach and attempting a smile Potter’s way.
“Harry, he’s pregnant,” Hermione says briskly. “His body is changing in a way it wasn’t actually made to be, which means his magic is working overtime to help his body accommodate the foetus.”
“PUT HER DOWN!” But Harry was already fading, he was back on his knees and he was sinking into nothingness. Lily’s cries had morphed into weak sobs.
, Malfoy,” Harry spat, sitting back on his haunches once more – if anything was more absurd than the fact that he and Malfoy were on the very verge of full on penetrative sex, it was the fact that they were actually managing to squeeze in some quick bickering before it happened. “Do you really want me to fuck you?” he enunciated clearly.
When Draco just stares at him incredulously, Potter laughs, soft and genuine. He pulls off the black elastic hair tie around his wrist and holds it between his teeth as he gathers his hair up and ties it carelessly into a knot behind his head.
Potter, to his credit, doesn’t look surprised, confused or angry. He remains perfectly insouciant as he stares at Draco, visibly considering his question.
He’s been to Harry’s bedroom just once before. They usually just got right down to business in the living room that they never actually made it up to his bed, but on one occasion, Harry had Disapparated them directly into his room after a date at which point he’d proceeded to spread Draco across his bed, pry his arse open and eat him open with such assiduous intent that when he’d slipped three fingers into Draco twenty minutes later, they’d sunk right in with no resistance whatsoever and Draco had nearly passed out from his ensuing orgasm.
“How d’you know what it’s like to fight off the Imperius?” Draco demands, one eyebrow slowly sliding up his forehead.
Harry slants him a weary glare before pointedly indicating to his groin; he’d clumsily pulled his bathrobe shut just as the two of them walked in and it now resembled a terry tent.
“I know your plan now, Potter,” Draco says calmly, tossing his napkin down, pushing his chair back, gathering the mahogany box up and rising. “You’re just going to keep spending money on me until I am so deeply drowned in debt that I’d have no choice but to submit to your every wish.”
“Call me mental, but I am,” he shrugs, smiling crookedly. “Besides, it’s been the longest time since I went on an actual date.” He gets up and turns towards the en suite, Summoning a fresh towel.
Malfoy shot him a sharp look, but a moment later he leaned back against the wall and slid down, settling on the floor with a soft, whooshing exhale.
“I assume there’s to be a wedding, then?” Lucius grits out icily. “Surely there’s no honour to the Potter name if your first child is a bastard, Potter?”
Harry laughs and grabs him lightly, kissing him full on the mouth this time, sighing when Malfoy melts into it. Cupping one soft cheek carefully, Harry deepens it, feathering his thumb up Malfoy’s cheekbone and slowly sinking his tongue into his mouth. Malfoy makes a small sound of satisfaction, his nails digging into Harry’s thigh where he’s gripping it, and then abruptly pulls away, blinking at Harry with pleasure-glazed eyes.
Draco shakes his head, sighing when they step up close enough to let their brows press together, Draco’s breath fogging Potter’s glasses. “I just...” Draco bites his lip, mouth curling down unhappily. “I just want it to work
Draco looks down himself, smoothing down his robes, patting down his hair and straightening up in his seat. “All what?” he finally asks in bewilderment.
forget even if they tried. Your name is synonymous with the peace and security our world is currently thriving in, Potter. There’s a reason every generation henceforth will learn about you, study you, and all your foolishly heroic acts.” When Harry snorts and looks at him, Malfoy is smiling a crooked but genuinely warm smile at him. “It’s be
Malfoy abruptly sets his fork down, eyes gleaming with something as he looks up and slowly leans back, mouth slowly ticking up in such a derisive, openly hostile smirk that Harry instantly feels his hackles rise.
“Yeah, listen, I needed to ask you something,” Erickson leans back in his chair, thick forearms resting on the armrests, one meaty, ham-like hand rubbing at his scraggly stubble. “I wanted to know if you—whether you’ve you know...
,” Malfoy exclaims, sounding rather choked as he reaches out to slap a hand onto Harry’s pectoral and dig his nails in.
your goddamn, ugly faces?” Malfoy bellows, face red and, to Harry’s shock, eyes swimming with tears. Then he’s jumping to his feet, sending his chair toppling over as he glares daggers at Hermione. “I’m—I’m going to sue you for this!” he declares furiously, spittle flying.
It’s endlessly amusing and so they throw a housewarming party with limited access to the press. They pose for the two reporters present and by that point are used to exchanging chaste kisses on the mouth. Harry keeps his hand around Malfoy’s waist the entire time, even when they’re not dancing, and they make sure to avoid eye contact seeing as it instantly resulted in a bout of helpless giggles.
“How the bloody hell do you know it’s yours?” Ron scoffs, hands on his hips as he frowns intently at the back of Harry’s shaggy head.
“Those aren’t a thing,” Draco says after a dazed pause. “Alpha wolves...beta, omega...they—those aren’t a thing.”
He’s soft, Draco is. I’d suspected it as a friend; now, as his boyfriend, I’ve confirmed it and it’s absolutely beautiful. As vulgar as his tongue can get, he’s endearingly old fashioned in some ways. He blushes when I kiss his forehead, his cheek. He initiates quiet nuzzling more often than he initiates proper kisses. When he wants me to hold his hand, he brushes his hand against mine until I get the hint. He likes to play with my hair, smell it, and muss it up. He’s a whole other person even while remaining entirely unchanged.
“They were—” Ron abruptly breaks off and sighs, looking harassed. “It was that Paulson guy – the rookie I’m training.” He looks guilty now under the frantic glare Harry shoots him. “Look, I told him to keep it confidential but the kid studied their files and when he realised they’re out of the country, he went and brought them into custody the moment he sniffed them out.”
She tells him they don’t and Malfoy settles for a cup of Darjeeling instead. Harry waits in silence, drinking his coffee and watching Malfoy steadily demolish his breakfast.
“Do it,” Harry bites out, spanking him again, over and over and over, with his free hand before grabbing one cheek pushing it inwards, against his cock, tightening the clutch around it. “Come now, do it now. Come for me, Draco.”
“Merlin,” Draco blushes slightly himself, gaze sliding from the chocolatines on his plate to the ostentatious little square box next to it, “is this paper made of real gold, Potter? Do they make it especially for you? Do these ribbons talk as well or just dance?”
“Curse Breakers work alone,” Draco daintily tears the crust off the sandwich with forefinger and thumb.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “I think all of us know that Malfoy’s... ‘thing’ with Tristan isn’t going to last.”
He rolls his eyes as Potter snorts, but when he looks up, his belly flutters at the way Potter’s eyes are trained fixedly on him, every last bit of his keen attention on Draco, his pupils dilated round and dark.
“I haven’t hated you in years,” says Harry, as though speaking to a particularly stupid child. “There hasn’t been any hatred between us in
On Weasley and Granger’s second wedding anniversary, Harry had surprised them by revealing a tattoo on his hip of an otter and Jack Russell terrier sitting cuddled together, their snouts gently bumping. Draco had felt a sense of detached loneliness that day but he didn’t know if it was because of the familiar latent jealousy of their friendship rearing its ugly head or because of the fact that he still couldn’t produce a Patronus himself.
Malfoy goes brilliantly pink, baring his teeth at Harry again with fisted hands trembling at his sides. “You
, not Draco. Even though Draco had shoved Potter’s head down and held it there while fucking his tongue, it felt like
“I don’t know,” Malfoy sounds a tad bit lost as he thumbs through the brightly coloured pamphlets. “I didn’t come with a prepared questionnaire, you know,” he says, scowling.
Gritting out a snarl, Harry spears his tongue through the fluttering, wrinkled ring of Malfoy’s arsehole, squeezing the plump arse cheek bearing a bold red handprint while freeing his own cock with his other hand, yanking it out and holding it by the base as it twitches wildly and spits out a long spool of precome onto the back of Malfoy’s thigh. His mouth waters at Malfoy’s tantalising scent, the clean, inviting taste of him, how his flesh quivers happily under Harry’s hands, his ivory skin gloriously silken and unblemished.
“Fuck you!” Draco screams, finally throwing himself onto the sofa and easing his foot out his shoe to clutch at his throbbing toes. “Just because it’s so fucking easy for you—”
“Thank you,” he says instead, soft and tremulous, his hurt probably clear on his face, because Harry suddenly strides forward and gathers him up close, holding him so tightly against himself that Draco’s feet leave the floor for a moment. Draco’s briefcase thuds onto the floor as he brings his arms around Harry’s neck, turning his face into Harry’s throat and inhaling his scent. “Tell me what the fuck is up with you.
Or maybe it’s the fact that he’s back here, back at Hogwarts; back in the very same place Voldemort’s lifeless body had thumped to the floor, where Potter had cried quietly over the corpses of the friends he’d lost, where Potter had
“Okay,” Draco replies coldly. “I’m going up to bed now.” Potter releases his hand slowly and Draco scrambles to his feet, picking up his book and the mug of milk Potter had brought him before striding away.
Malfoy’s lip curls, his cold, totally unimpressed gaze slowly moving up from Harry’s flapping cock, to his bright, excited expression. “You really are a fucking freak,” he hisses poisonously, “and a total fucking arsehole.” Malfoy kicks himself angrily out of Harry’s bed, picking up his discarded shirt off the floor while shooting Harry another glare that’s pure, venomous fury.
“Keep making suggestions like that and they’re going to think we eloped because you knocked me up or something,” Malfoy laughs.
He waits until the group has gone back into the club before straightening up, grinning at the gritted cusses that immediately float up from where Malfoy’s head is hanging over the side of the bike. “You’re shaking, you can’t even try to convince me that it wasn’t good,” Harry says blandly, massaging Malfoy’s sloppy arsehole with the tips of two fingers.
“Fuck them in as deep as you can get them, Malfoy,” Harry growled, pausing to wordlessly conjure himself some lube, coating his cock with it before continuing. “Put one foot up on the toilet and

with which Harry has imagined this in the past couple of years is not in any way sufficient to prepare him to deal with it in a composed, suave manner.  He
“It wasn’t,” Potter interrupts, not even raising his voice. He strolls a few steps closer and pauses in front of Draco, hands in his pockets. “It truly wasn’t. And I was practicing on a Boggart-Dementor which made the whole thing ten times as hard because I kept fainting.”
He has Malfoy cheek-first against the wall, his trousers pooled around his feet, about three seconds after they land in Harry’s front hallway.
be more comfortable in bed,” he manages to say. I can tell he’d been aiming to sound snarky. But he just sounds eager and earnest and, fuck, I want to give him the whole world.
I’m looking for just that one person as I push my way past people. I know he’s going to be here. And sure enough, as I shoulder my way to the bar, he’s standing there, clutching a flute of bubbly delicately by the stem. He’s wearing a pale grey button down with thin silver stripes that catch in the light, tucked into black leather trousers. His hair is in his eyes, as usual. He’s pink-cheeked and his lips are damp with champagne. When I emerge his gaze is instantly upon me, almost as if he’d been expecting me to appear from between those exact two people.
“Sit,” she snaps, and Harry hurries to sit back down, surprised when Malfoy slips into the chair beside him a moment later. “I’d rather neither of you killed the other in my office,” she further bites out. “Really, won’t you two ever just try and be
“What.” Harry emerges from under the socks, spluttering as he takes in Scorpius’ robes and snorting with laughter. “How’d you manage that?” he giggles, standing up and walking over.
“I’m, er...” Draco shifts awkwardly. “I was asked to be Head of Veela Affairs in the Department of Magical Beings last year. Before that I ran a small, private business.”
Potter seems indecently eager to eat Draco out again, barely waiting until they’re both undressed before lifting one of Draco’s thighs to his shoulder and diving in. Lightly fondling his own prick, Draco gasps up at the ceiling, toes curling with each biting suck Potter lays on his rim.
Potter grins then, eyes still gleaming with annoyance, fingers only tightening around his arms. “I don’t think that’s going to work on someone you’re trying to apprehend, Malfoy.”
Harry snorts. “Have you met me?” he asks sarcastically. “Have you noticed what my life’s been like so far? When has it ever been all roses and sunshine for me?”
And it was enough to make Harry lift himself onto all fours, wincing at the dull ache in his recently healed side, and crawl over the other boy until he hovered over his face. Malfoy was frowning again and his eyes held a tinge of defiant accusation in them.
Exchanging sullen glares, Malfoy and Harry fall silent, Harry staring breathlessly at a small bump he’s finally spotted, tilting his head this way and that, too conscious of Malfoy’s caustic tongue to ask Hermione to confirm whether he’s really looking at his kid or at Malfoy’s incredibly tiny appendix or something.
“Lovely day?” he grits into the mirror as he ties his hair into a glossy ponytail, hands slipping on the satin as he tries to make the black bow stand stiff and straight.
?” Draco scrunches his face up and mocks, getting up and irritably pushing his plate away, just to hear it clatter noisily against the scratched wood.
They only left after sundown, when Aberforth started getting a lot more customers much like himself, old and grizzled and incredibly grumpy, and clouds of acrid pipe smoke started drifting across the pub. They trudged back to the castle, the sudden silence between them loud after their incessant chattering earlier, but still somehow comfortable. When they reached Hogwarts, they parted with pleasant, albeit slightly awkward nods, and an hour later, Harry stared at Malfoy across the Great Hall all through dinner, Malfoy glancing back frequently enough to make his stomach flutter.
I walk around him and straight out of the club, and I know without looking back that he’s watching me leave.
“That won’t be necessary,” Malfoy says quickly, collecting the potions from Hermione’s desk. “I know my way home, Potter, thank you.”
“You just left,” Harry whispers again and Draco glances at him to see him wipe away a single tear tracking down his cheek. “Didn’t even ask me if
“Did you even lose this?” Malfoy wonders out loud, shifting his leg in a slow rub against Harry’s cock. When Harry doesn’t answer, Malfoy smirks, rolling them over and slithering down to inspect it more closely.
to learn to get along.” Malfoy’s listening to him intently, eyes narrow, head slightly tilted. Wiping suddenly sweaty palms on his jeans, Harry continues, “I... I want to be as involved in this as possible, alright? I’m not going to...chicken out of this. I’d like to help in any and every way I can but if you’re a right arsehole about it the whole time, it’s not going to be pleasant for either of us.”
. You’re no fun.” He releases Draco only to shift to his side and take his hand, pushing his nose into it and pressing kisses to the palm.
--?” Draco tries desperately to come up with a retort, but his brain has finally just given up and shut off completely, and now Draco’s legs are carrying him forward, quite out of his own volition, and he’s sprinting across the room, running at Harry as though he’s about to attack him, tear him apart, swallow him up.
“Are you going to make me show on you here on the front step?” Draco drawls, one eyebrow sliding up easily.
Dinner is a hit, and the pot of chicken curry I’d spent all evening making is wiped clean by the time we’re done eating. Everyone is eating the fancy ice cream Draco brought and he seems very pleased with our reaction. He’s sitting across my lap, one hand absently fiddling with my hair, as he loudly informs Seamus and Dean how clichéd their engagement is because Seamus had proposed on Christmas.
And then Potter very deliberately grinds against him and Draco’s legs nearly give right the fuck out. Bringing his face inches away from his, Potter asks him, “Was it the fact that I was on you, between your legs? My cock right there... Were you thinking about my cock, Malfoy? Is that it, you snotty son of a bitch?” Draco thrashes even harder, blunt nails scrabbling at the back of Potter’s hand, hips inadvertently bucking against Potter’s.
It’s like a punch to the stomach and Draco is left reeling as he stares in shocked silence at Harry.
Malfoy laughs all the way down the corridor. Harry thinks he’d like to be the one to make Malfoy laugh a lot more often.
He laughs along with Potter this time, heart happily skipping up and down his oesophagus. When they get to the empty pages at the end of the album, Potter reaches for the envelope beside him, pulling out a few shiny, new photographs, all of them featuring a sturdy little baby with bright turquoise, and in one photo vivid pink, hair.
He grins, his gaze wandering to my mouth as he clasps his fingers at the nape of my neck. “Maybe,” he says again.
Draco shot him a glare before suddenly straightening up and reaching out to hitch the tapestry out of the way. “Fine. Since you don’t seem to be in the mood to fuck anyway--”
I suck him off, bobbing my head and pressing my lips as tight as I can, holding his thighs open with one hand and fiddling with his balls with the other. They’re soft and very sensitive and I can’t believe how every inch of him is so beautiful, so appealing to me, how every bit of him just drags me in and holds me captive.
Harry is nearly blind with fury and Draco, cold all over and fighting the urge to vomit all over himself, shuts himself up in his dorm room. Harry stands outside and begs him to come out, first knocking and then eventually pounding at the door with his fist. It’s the first night in many, many weeks that they spend in separate beds.
Ginny yelled again and then her horse was making straight for Harry. A moment later, it was galloping around him in circles and Harry’s parents’ voice faded some.
Draco remains silent for so long that Potter starts to fidget. “When else have you fought it off?” Draco asks quietly. “During the—Did
“Kreacher is being prepare dinner for young Master Black as well!” Kreacher practically shouts, his spotted eyes shining with excitement. “A Black is be dining under this roof – Kreacher is make dinner for young--”
“Three more mugs of that bootwash you have on tap, please.” Draco grins as Zabini stomps away. “Now, what the fuck is up with you?” He turns to me all businesslike.
“Father couldn’t have even if he’d tried,” Draco says scornfully, his mouth quivering when Narcissa chimes out a startled laugh.
But then the heavy double doors are swinging open and Lucius Malfoy is sweeping in, black robes billowing around him, dull, grey hair pulled into a limp ponytail, his expression one of trained inscrutability, although his eyebrows do nearly disappear into his hairline when he notices Harry sitting there. His wife is right behind him, although she does not appear as carefully put together as Lucius. Her eyes are already wet, a small tuft of hair escaping her neat French twist, and she looks around a little wildly as she hurries in.
“Er, no,” Zabini complies, grinning at me and ignoring Draco’s enraged expression. “You’re sozzled enough as is. And coming back - when do we get to meet the fellow?”
it! Not when you’re naked or anything?! I mean--!” He looks a bit hysterical now. “Your arse is fine, Malfoy!” he wheezes desperately.
in it. Isn’t the first time you fuck in a relationship supposed to be romantic as all hell or something?” He shivers from a combination of the cold and Harry’s wet mouth against his skin.
It juts proudly out of a surprisingly neatly trimmed nest of black curls and Draco’s mouth waters as he picks it up tentatively with one hand, his eyes gleaming, slightly glazed over, his lips parted as he pants noisily. Potter is leaning up on his elbows, gaze dark and wary and still slightly shocked, until Draco carefully eases the foreskin down over the shaft a little, revealing the tip of the bulbous, reddened head, at which point he falls back with a groan, hands flying up to cover his face.
James was crying now, properly crying for the first time since last night, tears running down his dirty cheeks and chest heaving with sobs.
Harry hangs his head as he stands there, one hand braced against the tiles as Draco sponges down his back and heals a long, lightly oozing scratch across it. He sighs softly as Draco guides him to sit on the rim of the tub, blinking up at him, half-blind and strangely sweet, as Draco washes his face with warm, wet hands, resting his cheek on Draco’s chest as Draco gently lathers up his hair, shampooing his messy mane thrice before he’s satisfied. He stands and lifts his arms obediently so Draco can soap his armpits, swaying on the spot as Draco thoroughly works the soapy sponge over the rest of him, the hot spray a steady, soothing beat across their bodies.
By the time Harry sinks into Draco, they’re both trembling violently. Draco is completely silent, arms tight around Harry’s shoulders, eyes shut as he pants quietly. When Harry leans in kisses each eyelid softly, Draco opens his eyes, dark and hungry, but still somehow serene – content.
“When I have a cock in my mouth, of course,” Draco answers without missing a beat, Ron shutting his eyes and sighing, Seamus and Dean’s wolf whistles drowning out my own light sigh. “Tell me, moron, does a day go by without you pissing your wife off?”
“Are you even going to be home tonight?” Malfoy asks behind him and Harry turns to catch the meaningful look he gives him. Almost simultaneously, they both turn to observe the sky – the vivid colours of dusk are masked by the opaque, grey clouds gathering, and the air around them is already crackling in anticipation of the heavy showers forecasted. Harry estimates that the moon won’t be out for at least another hour but his insides seem to shrivel already with that instinctive sense of dread.
As it turns out, several rounds of vigorous sex on a daily basis stands a definite chance of improving the quality of a pregnant wizard’s life.
“It was the first time I woke up not feeling like I’d been thrown under a bus and then stomped on by an Erumpet.” At Draco’s smug smirk, Harry quickly adds, “And that was probably the result of your
get comfortable, and the aversion he’d developed towards sleeping potions after the war was still strong enough that he couldn’t bring himself to down any of it.
Malfoy sat up and gratefully accepted the glass with both his hands, clumsily lifting it to his mouth like a child and gulping quickly. When he held the glass out, Harry poured him some more and Malfoy drank that too.
Malfoy orders another neat whiskey. Harry turns and shakes his head at the bartender before plucking at Malfoy’s sleeve.
. A few days after I broke up with him, I’d learned (after a hysterically shouted firecall from Simon) that someone had cursed his mail so that it exploded in his hands and caused pus filled boils to erupt all over his face and neck. He’d spent a week in Mungo’s.
Harry doesn’t reply for a long time as he just sits and regards Malfoy steadily, noting the way the sardonic smirk slowly fades off Malfoy’s startlingly handsome face. “Do you regret it, Malfoy?” he asks quietly when Malfoy finally starts to fidget. “Do you regret kissing me back and letting me drag you into the gents’?”
The smell of Malfoy’s sweat and arousal is slowly fading to the background as the fruity sweetness of his scent rises up into the air again, mingling pleasantly with the smell of damp earth. Harry breathes in deeply as Malfoy’s soft snores start to sound, Harry’s clothes feeling cool against his grimy, overheated skin, his cock noticeably lighter around the base already. The savage, demanding force within him is stirring weakly, trying to fight its way back to the forefront even as an effervescent calm builds somewhere around his heart and slowly seeps through him, filling him up, and the control he’d nearly completely lost earlier is right back where he wants it.
Draco doesn’t care, frankly; he mostly just wants to see Potter’s mouth drop open when he unwraps Draco’s gift. It’s time that bastard learnt to take it like he dishes it, Draco thinks irritably as he hobbles towards the bathroom, his cock now pressing against the underside of his belly through his pyjamas.
Harry swats at his hand like he would a fly. “You’re not as smart as you’ve led us to believe you are if you don’t already know the answer to that,” he grits. “
Harry throws him an odd look before snorting again. “Whatever.” When Draco just continues to stare expectantly at him, Harry says irritably, “Something in your department – Head of Lycanthropy Affairs or some bollocks.”
Heaving for breath, Draco finds himself instantly shoving his arse back into it, not even bothering to spend an extended moment to register the utterly glorious fact that Potter is
“Harpies lost to the Magpies, two hundred and thirty to one hundred and ninety,” Potter looks oddly amused as he speaks, buttering his toast briskly. “Man, Ginny is going to be in a
Draco’s own body is seizing up from the shock of the sudden impaling, his arse clinging to Harry’s cock greedily, razor sharp bolts of pleasure shooting up and down his spine and that same tightly knotted, burning hot pool of arousal making his stomach and hips ache. He’s gasping quietly, Draco, nails hooked into the sweat slippery skin of Harry’s pecs, his long, white thighs trembling uncontrollably against Harry’s hips.
“Sorry I’m late,” Ron pants, dropping into the faux-leather sofa seat and immediately grabbing Draco’s tumbler of whiskey. “Hermione and I—”
“Need you so much,” Draco manages to garble out at some point when Harry’s tongue is back inside him. With an indulgent little hum, Harry brings one hand down and eases a single finger in alongside his tongue, and pushes it straight into his prostate, rubbing determinedly at it with single-minded intent. “
right now, Harry,” he tells me seriously and I click my tongue at him irritably. “Oh, would you grow up and not be a prude for once?!”
The first landing was hard enough to knock the breath right out of him. Gasping, he made sure all three children were still securely fastened onto his person.
“Yes,” Harry said flatly. He glanced over once more and this time Malfoy was definitely staring – or rather, frowning over at them, at the way Ron was heaving into his textbook and Hermione was sighing at him to be quiet – he
Finally, breathless and flushed, they pulled away, beaming at each other, laughing in disbelief and exultation until they were interrupted by a bout of indignant chattering.
“Move along now!” he bellows, elbow digging into Harry’s sternum as he shakes a fist at her. “Give us some privacy, you mossy bint! Off with you, or I’ll hex a blindfold onto your stupid, fishy face!”
Harry decided to add to Malfoy’s ego a bit – he had saved their lives, after all. “Yes. I can feel the strength of your wards. They’re impressive.”
had helped; not even picturing Uncle Vernon in frilly, pink knickers, nor McGonagall in thigh high leather boots brandishing a crop, nor Snape in a schoolgirl’s uniform - though all of those mental images
When the rumours of him and Malfoy moving in together start doing their rounds, it’s almost like having an epiphany.
“I think it’s the fact that it’s the first snow since the War or something,” Draco says, tone vague and rather flat. After a beat he turns to look at Potter only to find him frowning thoughtfully.
“I...I don’t care,” Draco sneers again, voice quavering as he gulps, one hand discreetly cupping his stomach as a there’s a wild tumble inside. “It’s none of my business, Potter,” he says, voice hardening again, nose rising haughtily, “It’s none of my business whom you’re romantically involved with. You owe me no explanations; I know that, so rest easy.” He makes to turn away again, this time just so he can pull himself together more than anything else, but Potter reaches out and curls one hand around Draco’s forearm.
kind in a way that left Draco gritting his teeth at the warmth in his chest, and was unwaveringly, unflinchingly loyal.
Harry was also infuriatingly tenacious, impressively witty, and was also funny with a sassy sort of confidence that left a person momentarily speechless before they laughed. He was consistently,
Potter’s teeth scrape over his nipple and Draco throws his head back and howls, quivering as he catches his breath and blinks down at him in heaving shock to find him slanting Draco a sly little look. “So come,” Potter says simply, teasing the peak of his nipple with the very tip of his tongue.
The strangled sound that escapes me is by no definition funny because my vision literally blurs with the pain but all Malfoy does is bursts out laughing again even as he hurries to press into me with giggled apologies.
Draco feels like he’s been catapulted into nothingness, into an infinite void where he feels nothing but pleasure so acute that it seems to be spreading outwards across his whole body, methodically incinerating every nerve ending he possesses. He’s screaming, body flying up off the sheets with every, jarring, breathtaking thrust of Harry’s cock into him, his cock slapping loudly against his belly, strings of sticky precome flying about with every wild whip.
Harry doesn’t know how long it’s been when they finally pull apart, panting roughly, Malfoy’s fingers combing slowly across his scalp, Harry’s hands gentle on Malfoy’s arse.
“Tea, I think,” Hermione says decisively, and I gladly follow her into the kitchen and settle down at the table as she makes the tea and pulls out packets of biscuits. “We should decorate your flat tomorrow,” she says brightly as she sets my mug before me and takes a seat opposite me.
He’s on his feet and halfway across the pub to the back door almost before he can firmly make up his mind to leave. With every step he takes, he imagines he’s crushing Potter’s nose underfoot again, imagines the satisfying crunch of it breaking like it did all those years ago.
“I—what?” Draco slurs. “Oh.” He blinks as Potter’s mouth curves into a smirk and then into a full blown, startlingly wicked grin. Scowling, Draco shoves at him. “Fuck off, you tosser.”
“Is being the young Master,” it says, shrill and breathless. “Master and Mistress being arrived yesterday,” it adds, wringing its hands.
“How?” Potter asks hoarsely, looking unsure and strangely tense, and Draco doesn’t know whether he’s looking for a theoretical explanation of if he’s just unable to believe any of it.
“I’ll make sure he doesn’t steal anymore of our stuff, okay?” he said in a voice that was supposed to be soothing but shook with suppressed laughter.
would likely be infected with Saviour Syndrome instead of that speccy git succumbing to lycanthropy.
Malfoy breathes steadily, the pause stretching on and on before he says, “Another couple of drinks, and I think I will be.”
“We can just sit here and not even look at each other if you prefer that, Malfoy,” Granger says wryly, sipping at her wine and not even looking a tiny bit offended that Draco is on the very verge of throwing a tantrum at the prospect of being left alone with her.
Draco isn’t quite certain how it happens, but the little outing he’d enforced upon Potter somehow ends with Potter and he going back to Draco’s flat, where Draco proceeds to start brewing a light Sleeping Draught Potter mentioned wanting in passing, and Potter sitting there and watching Draco.
Delighted, Harry lifts his head to stare at him brightly, and when Draco simply sniffles and scowls at him, Harry kisses him again, slow and deep.
“None of them would’ve bothered with me if not for my name,” Harry mumbles, squashing his cock down with a cushion and wincing.
him,” Draco informs him icily. “I made my own decision and I’d gone there prepared to face the consequences if need arose.”
But his eyes are sparkling with smug glee, with wicked triumph, and I have to work really hard at smothering the hysterical laughter that’s bubbling up my chest.
“No, I didn’t,” Draco bites out, before quickly plastering on a grin, and I exhale silently. “Stuff happened immediately after he said it, so...” The wink he gives Seamus makes me nauseous.
Holding his breath, his brain malfunctioning slightly as it tried to process that he was straddling Malfoy and stripping him naked, Harry dragged the pyjamas down, carefully lifting the elastic off the bulge of his erection, his insides leaping excitedly at the round, wet spot left there.
Harry’s gaze finally swivels around and comes to pause on the person beside him. Malfoy is clutching Harry’s purchases with one arm, his other hand tight around Harry’s uninjured arm.
Weasley struts forward, pushing into Draco’s personal space and huffing hotly into his face, one grubby finger stabbing at Draco’s sternum. “Listen here,
Harry doesn’t know how he’d gone all these years without this, without Malfoy beneath him, squirming with pleasure and muffling breathless moans into his shoulder. He wants to do this all day, every day, for the rest of his life.
to sneer at it when he’d pulled aside the simple brown paper the jumper had arrived in, and picked up the lumpy, white pile, hurrying away with it after shakily signing Harry’s note to Mrs. Weasley. Then he’d arrived at lunch an hour later wearing the thick white jumper that somehow made the usual paleness of his skin glow pink, and hadn’t taken it off since. Harry had beamed, Hermione had watched the pair of them fondly, and Ron had continued with his loud rant about how
Cogency fled Draco as he grabbed Harry by his robes and yanked him closer, sliding both hands into his wind-ruffled hair as he slanted his head and let Harry ravage his mouth, giving back as good as he took. The noise of the stadium faded away into white noise – the only thing he even remotely cared about was kissing this gorgeous prat right here. Harry hovered in mid-air, seeming perfectly content to risk falling and breaking his neck as long as he could kiss Draco right there in front of hundreds of pairs of keenly staring eyes.
“Let me guess,” he says lightly as he joins a rather nervous looking Potter for breakfast fifteen minutes later, “You’re trying to buy your way back into my pants?”
, you nitwit?” he asks, groping himself tipsily for his wand before drawing it and tapping the doorknob with it. “I don’t know about you,” he says, pushing the door open and stepping in, “but I could do with another drink. I dunno what I was thinking, saying I’m ready to leave before getting properly shit-faced.”
“What would they say, Potter?” he pants, shivering at the constricting heat of Potter’s throat around his prick. “What would all your
don’t know what Seamus added to my drink, that stupid fucking wanker. I swear I’m never going drinking with him ever again.”
He thought of their kiss just the previous evening, the one after which Harry had said those things about... them, the promise ringing clear in his tone.
Ron promptly topples backwards off his stool and Draco smiles sweetly down at him. “Come on back up here,
“What are you talking about?” Irritation and satisfaction collide within me and it comes out as a sharp bark as I look back around at him with a scowl. “What the fuck did I do now?”
With a muffled cry, Draco tumbles over the edge. He starts to come in Potter’s mouth but with an enormous burst of self control, Draco pulls out and stripes Potter’s face and hair with long ribbons of spunk. Tugging hard on his cock, Draco watches with his mouth slightly open at the way Potter licks the dripping tip and swallows.
, sleek and long-limbed with a proud head of antlers. It darts them a look before it gallops off into the thick cluster of trees, almost dazzling in its brightness, practically solid silver in its intensity.
“For conducting basic blood tests?” Hermione blinks in confusion, Levitating the fallen chair upright, “Malfoy, you’re pregnant, I needed to—”
“What’s this about?” I hurriedly ask, looking at anything but the way Draco’s tongue curled around his fork, pink lips shiny with thick sugary syrup.
He’d picked one of the biggest bedrooms and suspects it used to be Sirius’ parents’. The walls are a rich cream, gold paint highlighting the mouldings. An enormous four-poster — fluffy white and incredibly inviting, complete with gauzy bed-hangings stands right across the door — is flanked on either side by broad, square windows that go all the way up to the ceiling, hung with sheer, white day-curtains, and thicker drapes in deep, emerald green. Under the window on the left sits a lovely, carved writing desk, already equipped with a stack of parchment, a stand full of quills and three pots of ink, and beneath the window on the right is a large, ostentatious Victorian chaise lounge upholstered in silver and green.
“You’re ten seconds away from having cider flung in your face, Potter,” Draco drawls, turning his face slightly to nuzzle Harry’s nose.
Hermione’s bushy hair is obscuring most of him as she crouches over his supine form, already on Healer mode. Bill and George are stood side by side, watching Hermione and – my heart does a dizzying loop-de-loop – Draco is kneeling on the other side, bent over his boyfriend, speaking into his ear, probably comforting him. Ginny and Ron break away as they see me approach.
“I—” Malfoy fidgets vigorously now, “I read to...it, alright? Every night – every night that I’m alone,” he hurries to clarify. “I just read whatever I’m currently reading because it’s not as if it can understand anyway.” Malfoy sighs when Harry just gapes at him with his mouth wide open. “It’s alright if you don’t want to, Potter. I just thought you might like to—”
“Oh?” Draco quavers at him, staring down at where Potter’s hands are clasped around his own, the caramel of his skin stark against the nearly colourless white of Draco’s own, “And have you had yourself checked for that? Is it the result of a concussion, maybe?”
Malfoy tries to look around, his movements jerky and strained, and Harry quickly pulls his hand out of the tangled mess of blond, grabbing Malfoy’s hips and staring down at where their bodies are joined. His cock is nearly purple and darkened drastically at the base where Harry can see the skin stretched too tight.
“You think I’m charming, Malfoy?” Harry’s cheek is resting in one hand, his body leaning into Malfoy’s personal space with no conscious effort to do so.
Harry swallows and nods awkwardly. “Thank you,” he says, trotting up the cracked front steps and pushing the broken door further open. The stairs creak beneath his feet as he climbs up, wondering if he’s walking into a trap of some sort because Malfoy cannot be living in this sort of—
Draco is laughing all over again now, soundlessly and helplessly. “You...wanted to do that in my presence?”
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy, what the fuck do you want?” Ron demands rudely, slamming a fist on his desk, his own mug of tea rattling noisily.
want to admit it. “Some trick it’s going to be, Potter, squeezing yourself to fit in there,” he says dryly, darting him a glance, raising an eyebrow.
Neither Granger nor he move to pick up the remote and switch channels, so they end up watching the football match Potter had been watching for a good while in surprisingly comfortable silence. When Granger gets up to refresh her drink, she fetches Draco a bottle of butterbeer from the cooler.
And Draco’s knee buckled. He collapsed with a gasp of shock, arms flailing wildly, but Harry caught him, fingers pulling out of him and both hands firmly grabbing on to the cushiony softness of Draco’s bum, giving it a teasing squeeze as he positioned him to straddle his thighs, pants and trousers still tangled around his ankles before Harry pulled off one shoe and then tugged that leg free from the constricting garments so Draco could spread his knees open wider.
Malfoy blinked at him, looking around them once in confusion before turning back to him, his expression suddenly changing as Harry tilted his chin up and leaned closer.
But Harry just sighed softly, not answering verbally, instead sitting up and looking around wordlessly for his glasses. Shoving them on, he leaned over Malfoy’s come-sticky chest and reached for the jug and glass. The gush of the water being poured seemed overly loud in the silence between them.
Malfoy stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, clutching his tea. When he took his first sip, his lips slanted upwards on a half-smirk and he strolled over to Harry.
“It’s really fucking creepy when you do that, Potter,” Draco hisses, determinedly not making eye contact with any of the occupants of the room, his gaze fixed somewhere near the Wireless on the mantle.
“No,” Potter replies, just as shortly. “Besides, when I taught the DA to cast their Patronuses, we didn’t have a dummy Dementor to practice on. And they’ve all learnt it just fine, as you saw the other night.”
of resolutely not allowing myself to fantasise, I let myself slip for a fraction of a second – I imagine what it would be like to lean over and kiss Draco in front of my friends like that, without feeling self-conscious or awkward; because why would it be awkward to kiss him in company if we were together? There’s nobody else I can ever be that comfortable with; nobody else with whom my affection will feel so completely natural, nobody else I would want to spontaneously kiss.
“He couldn’t stop talking about you,” she says, and Draco starts slightly at the abrupt way she threw that in; his cheeks heat, and not entirely because of his proximity to the iron cauldron. “Now I see why,” she adds lightly, hitching her handbag higher up her shoulder, giving him a sly little smile.
“Anybody who sees you would want to fuck you,” Harry admits morosely. “I’m sorry I stare, alright, I’ll try not to.”
Face burning, Draco scoops up his crying daughter, looking around only to gesture to Scorpius to finish his meal before stomping out and down the corridor to the main parlour where he hurriedly cradles Lyra close and speaks in a low, calming tone until she stops crying.
Harry sighs again, shutting his eyes, shoulders slumping. “Why must you make things so difficult always?” he asks wearily.
Draco sniffs but doesn’t deny it. “You really want to spend your birthday just sitting in here with three people and an elf that might drop dead any second?”
that’s why you dragged me down to this icebox,” Harry sniggers. “I knew it was to get away from Ron and ‘Mione.”
Malfoy scoffs again. “Wouldn’t a bed and some proper lighting make this experience more worthwhile?!” he whines, jerking as Harry thumbs at his hole, panting as he fights to keep from sagging over the side of the bike. “Fuck, Potter, I’m going to land up face first in this ditch and this whole thing would’ve been moot because I’ll fucking
“Thank fuck for that,” Harry replied casualy, retrieving Malfoy’s bag and two of the enormous books he’d been carrying. “I’ve been trying to get people to see me for
“You know, Malfoy,” Harry says, tone easy and playful, eyes dark with promise, “one of these days you’re going to stop getting away with saying things like that.”
“Can you put it back inside me, please?” Malfoy demands loudly, irritably slamming his heel against Harry’s shoulder blade and grabbing his renewed erection to lazily fist it a couple of times.
