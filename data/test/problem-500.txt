Malfoy chuckled under his breath, so low that only the two of them could hear. “Nervous, are we?”
, and no one’s feet are chopped off in her version of
He made up his mind quickly and sprang up off the couch. “You know what, you’re right. Lead the way.” Harry mostly remembered the way to the prefect’s bathroom, but the moving staircases seemed to have a mind of their own today. Draco knew the way perfectly, and squired Harry along like a knight escorting his young queen. Harry felt rather silly, but he did want a bath.
“Bloody hell, Harry, you got Malfoy,” Ron gasped. “D’you need a distraction? I think I've some Peruvian darkness powder in a secret compartment on my belt…” He frantically patted himself down, realized he wasn’t wearing his Auror robes, and sadly shook his head.
PSA: As one reader has pointed out, if anyone is harassing you or stalking you, please go to the authorities. However, as this is a Drarry story, I can promise you lots of emotional growth and a happy ending. It will be much fluffier from here on out. Thank you for reading!
Draco grinned widely. “He’s quite easygoing in my presence. I assure you, it shan’t be a problem. Come, mate.”
Hermione smiled. “Ron, I feel like nothing could keep you away from fresh chips. But he has a point, Harry. Sex is a private thing, and you’re talking about walking in on Malfoy and his partner like it’s nothing. If it really bothers you, you can always try to talk to Malfoy about it. But I don't think it’s really your business. Even if it were, we shouldn’t be discussing it in the middle of the Three Broomsticks.”
Malfoy sighed heavily and took a scone. “Speaking of business matters is reserved for after tea, Potter. I promise I will answer your questions about the manor later. For now, regale me with how our Golden Boy became an expert on anything but slaying Dark wizards.” The words were smarmy, but Malfoy’s tone lacked any real bite.
"So, do tell of these - experience and theories," I said as I gritted my teeth together as I tried to lessen my irritation.
Light.
My nerves had been going nuts inside me. The inside of my body feels like it had frozen from my flesh to every vein to every drop of my blood. Sweat pours down my forehead and my heart thumps hard against my ribcage. I could taste the bitter bile inside my mouth and the shrinking feeling inside my stomach.
"I'm just confused." I finally said.
"Potter," Malfoy said in a very bored tone as I look at him away from his hand. "That's sexual harassment."
I heard my stomach grumbled in hunger. Ron, who is beside me, chuckled as he said. "We are in the same state, mate. I am so hungry that I could eat a whole house."
I lose my girlfriend, Ginny.
'He'll be the death of me!' I swear. This incubus!
"What?" I asked her.
"Let's find something to break this...thing off you, Harry" Hermione declared with so much conviction.
I was just so fascinated with him.
"Calm down, Draco." Snape walks towards Malfoy, with caution in each of his every step.
And I keep on running until my muscles ache and my lungs gave up from exhaustion.
End of the previous chapter.
03. The Crestfallen Draconis
The twins had noticed the agitation that is oozing from their mother, as they both stop bickering at each other.
I sat, unnerving, as my thoughts run wild - my first class with the Slytherins, this morning took a different twisted turn in my life. I, desperately, am trying to find a way to rearrange my ideas inside my confused mind as I, with the rest of the Gryffindors have entered charms, our second class.
Not angry but it was more like hatred. I was full of hate within me!
"Harry?" She asked confused.
Five to ten years that's already a heavy crime. I should say, it was a good thing Malfoy did cut off Romilda's tongue. To stay in Azbakan even for a week could make someone mad. Imagine all the Dementors going in and out to suck all your happy memories. I tremble at that thought.
Despite the exhaustion that I'm experiencing, I just couldn't stop myself from running in fear. Right behind me, Ron and Hermione were also fleeing in panic. Cold swept within the cave, chilling our body, and as if it entered our hearts as we tremble with dread. I didn't stop from our sprint even how many times we would fall to the ground only to get up again as fast as we can - didn't bother if we had broken bones or scars all over our body from the hard fall- the only thought we had in our mind was to run as fast as we can - away from the creature.
I continued to whimper and tear up as I look up to the sky.
"Bring out your teacups and sprinkle your grind tea leaves then put 2 drops of spring water. Concentrate your mind. Use your inner eye." She said as she took out her teacup. We followed the instructions she relayed.
After dinner, all of us went towards the Gryffindor tower, the entrance which was hidden behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress.
I relished the taste of the meat inside my mouth, I was in bliss and disgusted with myself but my hunger overpowered my rationality. Enjoying it, I chewed at it, slowly. Then suddenly, the demon laughed.
I couldn't fall back to sleep anymore. After hours of trying to calm down and fixing the broken mirror as well as my eyes returning to its natural color along with me finding out that the source of blood around my mouth was from my hand that I was biting in my sleep. All I could do is blankly stared at the night sky from the window next to my bed.
Closing my eyes, trying to control my emotions as breathe in through my nose and breathe out through my mouth. The only good thing in the article that I have read is the Weasleys decline the interview and Professor Dumbledore denied all the lies that particularly, me becoming a dark wizard. No word referring to Sirius and Remus, which means they haven't come back from their mission.
Every part of my body shuddered away from my reflection, that took a form of a boy, my face pale as a ghost, blood smeared around my lips and my eyes that was once green had been tainted by red, just like her eyes - my demon's eyes.
Professor McGonagall, Ron, Fred, and George then there was Ginny...
I gently patted back at her hand.
Another shiver runs all over my body as he spoke my name. I was filled with anticipation. That’s when I know I had it bad.
The Great hall buzzed as the whole student body chatter at the same time about what just had happened as soon as Malfoy exit. Some were so loud - wondering and confused as I am. I know I should be bothered but I was still too busy, trying to clear my head with all the commotion also I was still greatly affected by HIS smile. That was the one that was really bugging me out.
"Unpleasant? Hmm... Like SOW. Are you talking about yourself, blood traitor?" Mr. Malfoy went further with that then Hell break loose. Sirius and all the Weasleys, even Mr. Weasley went for it, stomping toward him with their raised fists and angry faces. I also couldn't stop my anger as I marched towards them. I can hear the girls telling us to stop but Mr. Malfoy was asking for it. Then unexpectedly, Draco Malfoy steps in front of his father, shielding him from us. Sirius almost hit Draco as he was standing between Sirius and his father. It was a good thing Sirius was able to stop his strike.
"Guys, it's okay to express your feelings with one another but I would appreciate it if you do it in the privacy of your bedrooms." She said in a completely amused tone. "Next time."
"Ah. Tsk! Tsk! Let me finish first before any of you, starts to complain" He said as he wiggles his finger at us, as he has notice Hermione started to open her mouth, with her alarm expression.
"Hermione, I'm not hungry," I told her.
1. Heighten senses (Hearing - I can hear very clear, eyesight - I don't need my eyeglasses anymore, smell- I guess?, taste- ??? by Harry) (Hearing and eyesight: not yet measured properly but had been improved greatly smell: more detailed than an average human and needs more information, taste: N/A)

"Yes, Harry. I also want to hear about that?" Hermione took a serious tone again as she also sat down beside me this time.
------------------------------------------------
"Yes..." I answered.
She laughed, manically like a demon. She wasn't calm today.
Blood was trailing over my footsteps. Trembling, I look down at myself. I was soaked entirely. Assaulting my senses and invading my thoughts.
He shrugged both of his shoulders in a relaxed and arrogant manner, which frustrates me to no end.
'He knows something. Fishy. Tsk. Tsk.'
"Me, too," Seamus whispered back to Dean and faced Ron. "The Irish's fan, that's me" Seamus grinned back. "Let's see who will win in the tournament!"
And I am so sorry for the delay, I am having a hard time in writing the scene in which the match between the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor since I can't seem to imagine the spins and actions of the players on the brooms. So it took me a long time to type it down. Hence I have decided not to put it anyway since it would look insufficient.
As I was following her, I realize the she-elf was wearing a cute blue dress that surprises me to no end. Usually, house-elves are dressed in rags - the best example that I could think of is Dobby, who was also was once a house-elf serving the Malfoys but now, a free elf.
"I-I" It seems Sirius was also shaken by the whole ordeal and can't find a word to say.
I was a bit disappointed with Hermione's answer but it was reasonable. But I couldn't stop myself from expecting more. More of what? I don't know. I just want more...
"And I am!" I said confidently. "Just look at how they treated by the wizarding families."
Tears flowed from my eyes, as grieve and relief flooded within me. I return her embrace. "Sorry! Sorry!! I am so sorry, Hermione!!!" I choke within my tears and cries. "And thank you!"
I stumbled as I don't know what to say maybe from too much shock that was in my system or I just didn't know where to start.
"I am always right," Draco said with conviction.
End of the previous chapter.
"Malfoy, What are doing here?" I grumbled as I hid my injured hand and peeked at the broken mirror to see if she was still there. Luckily, she was gone.
The hunters found us!
Michael had turned pale from Hermione's speech and both his friends had nervously chatter at his back.
"Everyone!" a commanding voice said. "Fall in line and move along to the Great Hall"
Immediately, Hermione took hold of some plates from Malfoy and started helping him in preparing the table. I stood there helplessly as I witness yet another shocking event that is happening, in front of me. Malfoy! He was setting the table and being nice to the house-elf.
Message: I sincerely apologize for the long absence and the late update, I was preparing for my written examinations and simulation test, and I couldn't lend time in typing my story. Super Sorry!
"If you want Harry. I could you some of my chicken?" Ron offered as he moved his plate towards me. "Mum is right. You didn't even finish your pumpkin juice."
Chapter 19: Overwhelmed and Captivated Part 2
"It's fine, Professor McGonagall." I said as I stood up to approach her.
“No, this is not true...” I screamed. I was frightened of my lust and hunger. “This is only a dream. A bad dream.”
Then the next thing that had to happen scared the wits out of me as Malfoy laugh in a spine-chilling manner and when I saw his eyes, sweats started to broke out from my body. His eyes had madness in them, that I am sure everyone could see as Professor McGonagall took a step back, Snape changed his stance into a guarded one, and the three of us stood from our couch ready to do anything if it is necessary. The only one who was not affected is the Headmaster, himself.
'Noisy girl' My demon snarled. I ignored her.
I felt chills run on my back as his warm breath tickled my face. Soon I realized the words that he had said, I tried to inhale and exhale slowly to composed myself in able to hinder the change in the colors of my eyes.
'Take my hand and I will save you.' She reaches out her hand to me.
Ah. Shit! My heart gave a thump.
I, with Ron and Hermione, followed her and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors. "Thank goodness, it's warm inside," Hermione muttered at my right and I hummed into agreeing. It was freezing outside.
Both I and Hermione stared at him, then laughter came as I couldn't stop - the relief that floods me. As frightening as My situation is, Ron always finds ways to make comic relief about my dire situation. The ridiculous and hilarious situation that I am in. Beside me, Hermione also giggled at Ron.
Then he went over. "Blimey, Harry!" He exclaimed. "You look like a toad."
He looks at me as if I was not sick of fever but instead, I have become mentally from all the things that had to happen to me.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I run to let go.
Hermione stood there as she came stumbling towards me and grabbing my shirt. "Draco is fine now. Please stop."
To let Draco be hurt because of me... This kind of thing, absolutely cannot happen again.
It has been an hour, since our exploration in the cave. The cave was like a mass - full of tunnels, stalagmites, dripping water, and rocks but nothing noticeable except for the guard stone from the entrance. The echo of our ever step bounds throughout the walls of the cave.
"WEAK, POTTER!" He smirked at me, as he panting heavily. I growled and stood up abruptly, my blood thumping with vengeance. With my own two hands, I grabbed his head and brought my knee cap to his nose, there was a blunt crack and I released his head. Crimson leaked from both his nostrils and his nose was twisted, crooked - broken.
From the previous chapter:
2. Harry's decision in not telling the adults of his situation will later be tackle. Please wait for it because there is a reason behind his stubbornness.  If I reveal it now, it will destroy the play of my story.
He blinked surprise. "Wow. Hermione is right about you, being a thick head."
"This is becoming pointless," Hermione said after awhile. "Should we turn back?"
"Yes," I answered as I refocus my mind on Hermione, away from the negative thoughts that have entered my head.
"I see..." He whispered. "I forgot how ignorant you are about magic laws and bonds when, comparing to Granger, who is more knowledgeable and is more welcoming with the idea of House-elf sharing a meal with its owner."
Somebody sounded out from the door. I jump from a familiar voice. 'Shit! Hermione.'
She got up from her seat, coming to me and tug my sleeves. I frowned at her as I was still angry at her for that incident.
"Not exactly hallucinations. I couldn't explain it." I grumbled desperately.
'Go away, Demon!' I tried to shove her away from my mind. Why would she choose to show herself right now? I am on the verge of dying right here.
I sat up immediately as soon as I heard her voice. I knew who was it - My demon. "Shut up!" I yelled openly and unrestrained. I had enough! "Leave me alone!!!"
As soon as he said those words, all the cheers died down. The murmurs of worries started to escalate in all the team members as well as Michael's side.
“Are you fine with that only?” He spoke tactlessly.
"Your food," Draco said. He set his mug down as he was sipping his chocolate drink. "We were tampering your food"
I paled as I heard the mixture and pushed the teacup away.
Then a roar was heard - like a lion with a bark of a vicious wolf. I saw it as it had reached us at last. From where the tunnel that we came from was ahead of a dog with the cat's ears and eyes, along with three horns on the top its head was peeking - as hideous it was and frightening - it was nothing against its expression it showed when it finally saw us. Its face turns into a gleeful look - eyes that held hunger and absolute happiness as its mouth warp into a human-like smile and inside its mouth were three rows at the upper and another two rows of razor-sharp teeth at the bottom part. I held my breath as chills run up and down my body. I couldn't move from my spot along with Ron and Hermione.
Those three words felt like more of a goodbye than its real indication. His acceptance of his end. The satisfaction of his act of love for me. I stared at him, gnawing pain and realization dawn unto me. More tears fell from my eyes. A cry of mourning escape from my lips.
Malfoy slowly walk towards Angelina and reached out to a small notebook that had a blue hue cover. Michael reacted almost immediately as he made to snatch the small notebook but unable to grab it as Malfoy avoided his hands.
"Like it? Bullshit! Who are you? And what do you want? Why me? Why are you doing this to me? ANSWER ME!" I gritted with so much revulsion engraved in my voice. My chest was burning with hatred. My eyes sting with tears that freely flows. I want to hurt her. Punch her with all my might for making my life miserable.
As I have descended the stairs, I can already hear the chattering from the combined kitchen-diner area. Upon reaching the room, I was greeted by the amazing smell of the food.
“How? Where?” Hermione asked in a surprised tone. She was just as bewildered as me at the thought of us hunting in the deep forest.
From the previous chapter:
Michael was Ginny's Ex-boyfriend.
"Oh good, you can now hear us. I thought you went into a seizure state when you are not responding to us." Malfoy snickered. "But you have to know your head is too hard. Look at my hand, it is all red from hitting you."
"Experience? Theories?" I doubted him. How can anyone have the same problem as Harry?
"I'm fine. I still do have them but they have been appearing less since our unfortunate adventure but sometimes there were ones that made me woke up  in the middle of the night and couldn't return to sleep." She smiled wearily.
Just freedom.
"Let's just say. I have an idea of what is happening with you" Malfoy eyed him.
"Hermione, I'm sor-" I mumbled but was cut-off abruptly as Hermione had run with her arms spread open and she embraced me strongly. Her arms tightened around my neck and she sniffed and sobbed.
"Hmm..." He answered nonchalantly. "I never have expected that hearing words of gratitude from you, Potter, would make me feel good. That's a first."
"Huh?" I, idiotically, responded at her. I blushed as soon I realized how I sound so silly.
And with that and with great effort, Hermione shut up.
I am asking what do you mean by me looking better?" I grinned at her as I neared my face to her.
Malfoy raised both of his eyebrows in disbelief clearly shown on his face. There was an awful one minute of silence before Malfoy sighed.
Suddenly, Malfoy's face turned serious, and stared at me, with much intensity. "To eat what?"
Cheers erupted from my teammates. I can Ron calling out to me "Good job Mate!" while Hermione shouted at him. "Stop egging him, Ron."
"Hmmm...Malfoy?" I muttered as I look up at him again.
The dream started with me, opening my eyes, as I again was laying down. I was facing the grey sky, dull and lifeless. Then a single snowflake slowly descending towards me. I raised my hand up to reach for it and as I did, my attention was drawn at something in my closed fist. I open it then blood started to flow. Startled, I abruptly sat up. The splashing of something was heard, echoed throughout the wide horizon of black and white.
"Well then. On what business do the three of you have with me" The headmaster asked.
He took out a knife.
"I will" Draco smiled, faintly. "Let's go, Father"
It smell so good that my mouth watered a bit. Distracted, I didn't recognize that one of Malfoy's butterflies found me as it landed on my bandaged hand. As soon as it had landed on me, I panic and flinched away - making me reveal my location as I accidentally step on a branch and it cracked as it broke under my weight.
To them, I am a monster.
RED. That was the only thing, I saw as I took a swing at her. Smashing the blasted mirror. Pain erupted as my fist got pierced by the broken pieces of the glass. Her laughter fading slowly.
"Lies!" I shouted, angrily.
"P-Potter, what a-are you doing here?" Corner stuttered with uncertainty but tried to hide it which fake arrogance in his tone and voice.
"Father" Draco uttered with a strained voice. "You promised that you wouldn't do anything unsightly just for this day." Draco, with a bored look, talking down to his father like he was scolding an infant. "This is an important day, Father." He stopped to emphasized. "If you can't do that. You can go home. I will tell mother that you can't come because of an -" He halts for a second to think of a word. " itch, you can't suppress."
"What more do you want to ask?" Malfoy grumbled as I again interrupted his time with his butterflies.
We dashed as fast as we can, following behind us closely we're the hungry creatures. I saw a flicker of movement to our left, then a giant hobgoblin appeared, apparently, its target was Hermione as it reached out to grab her hair. Draco immediately reacted by pulling her but was a bit slower than the Hobgoblin. I raced over and brace my body as I smashed my back and shoulder to the snarling Hobgoblin then we came tumbling as we lost balance.
"I was merely stating the facts." He said in a bored tone as he towered over us.
"So, Let's get unto our main agenda for the day," Hermione said as she brought out her beaded bag, opening it. She grabs something from the inside - books. Of course, Hermione and books, they are inseparable.
But what got me in contemplating is my demon. She has been showing less and less, the last time she appeared to me is when Draco almost saw her through the mirror, which was a month ago. Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy for her to just disappear and never come back but I feel that the more she is away, the more she is preparing a bigger and nastier surprise for me.
"INCARCEROUS!!!"
Me, Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus climbed up the spiral staircase until we have reached our dormitory, which was located at the top of the tower while Hermione went with the other girls through the doorway to the girls' dormitory. The room had five four-poster beds with the theme color of the Gryffindor, which is deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with our trunks at the foot. We all got into our sleepwear and bed.
Beside him, Charlie guffawed at my embarrassed face. Growing red at every minute that I spend with them, even Remus apologized, which made the others laughed more.
After finishing her speech, a deafening silence reign over us throughout Malfoy's kitchen, as I began to contempt the idea of becoming not a Human.
"Are going mental, Harry-mate?" Ron said with a slacked jaw as he stared at me, making his blue eyes larger than the original size.
"Really? I think you look dashing oddly, " Draco said as he raised my face, lifting my chin gently. "If not, I would have not kissed you."
"What you do mean 'We killed him'?" I asked her. She giggled then pointed at the chunked meat at the bottom of my feet. I can see the white-cloaked fluttering, that had been soaked by the blood, that had almost had turned red.
Hissing through my mouth. menacing as it sounds like a snake that is about to attack. Ever muscles in my body bunched and arched, twisting up from the cold ground. I flipped off my back in a spin, crouching in a defensive stance as I glared out in the open field in search of danger and prey.
Hermione.
The light from the window was the first thing that had greeted me in the morning as I woke up from my sleep. It is the first time I had ever felt refreshed from waking up and it left me to confuse.
He spoke a spell and the newspaper ignited into flames and turn to ashes, scattering on the floor. Tiffany appears behind him and quickly clean the dirt with a spell, in a flash.
"Harry..." Hermione's soft and concerned voice whispered as she reaches out to pat my tense hand.
I called out her name more of disbelief of her hearing her say something so vulgar while Draco called out her name with amusement and proud tone as he muttered: "So, Gryffindors could be taught. I am proud of you, Hermione!"
"As for the reason." Malfoy intervened whatever Hermione gonna say. "It's personal. Ah... Well, you are going to know about it anyway might as well say it on your faces so I can see your reactions. And I got to savor your taunting."
The flickering embers of the fire; the creaks of the snapping of the wood were the only sound that can be heard through-out the room. The harmonious aura as turn to a strained one as I felt bitter and sweet from the news of the drastic change of the opinions of the important people in my life, towards me. Hermione seems to notice my despair and flinch in guilt as she realizes how insensitive the words that she had revealed to me as she nervously twists her hands.
I turned away from him, denial swirl in my chest as it gripped my heart.
Ginny and Hermione just had arrived.
Ginny run-up to my side, trying to see if I was seriously injured. She whispered. "Are you alright?" I whispered back to her to spare her from worrying so much. "I'm fine"
"I don't want to know your nightly escapades, Potter. Please spare me from the details. I don't want to vomit early in the morning." He drawl at me while looking away.
Sighing, I let myself calm down before I started to walk away.
I woke up.
"Yes?" Hermione urged me to continue, slowly.
"Harry?" Hermione spoke gently beside me.
Hermione is like a sister and my best friend to me.
"Yes. I still have this." Malfoy showed the forgotten notebook. "I can show this to Professor McGonagall"

Screaming as the girl stumbled away from my claws. She keeping yelling a name that I have no concern about. A hot flashed went through my body as it seeks relief from the hot flames scourging my body. My head swirl in pain and heaviness, my skin prickly.
"And do you have an appointment with him?" He said with one of his eyebrows raised.
"Would you stop that!" I grumbled at him as he continued to stare at me. In our background, Hermione was trying but failing to hold on to her laughter as I can still hear her gasping and giggling.
I don't know if being a dark creature is more sinful than cheating on your girlfriend with your ex-rival.
"Baddock, Malcolm"
Noticing the dark sky and the moon and stars have already risen, I realized that it must have been hours since then. I blushed in embarrassment. "Sorry for you to see me like that."
"What happens, Harry?" Ron nearly shouted on my face as his spit came flying.
Rolling his eyes at me. "Really, Potter. Even the Weasleys should have known about it. They forgot their purebloods. Your Godfather should have told you. After all, he is black."
I turned to the headmaster Dumbledore and spoke about our summer's adventure with the Gulon and the dreams - the nightmares.
Raising one of his eyebrows, the male faced the bushy-haired girl."Explain."
Harry braced himself against a tree, still trying to catch his breath. The responsibilities of his life felt crushing. Schoolwork and friends and trying to explain where Draco had gone waited for him back at the castle, but he was in no hurry to return. All he could do was breathe and be.
Water (even the most luxuriously oiled and soaped bath water) is not among the best of lubricants. But Harry didn’t care. What a difference the touch of another made: Draco’s clever hands, the rocking of his thighs against Harry’s, that velvet-iron cock that thrust against Harry’s...everything was too perfect to handle. All was slippery and hot and Draco as Harry came in his lover’s arms. Bone-tired as he was, he flopped back onto his chest and rested there until they were both pruny, Draco rubbing his back all the while. Pink-cheeked and fragrant, they dressed and returned to the eighth year dormitory together.
Perhaps this was his opportunity to ask Potter about his reasons for the boon he’d requested? No, Draco needed to lull him into a sense of security first. “Something borderline engaging...ah. Why aren’t you an Auror, one of the wizarding world’s jackbooted elite? I remember you were terribly invested in the idea a few years ago,” Draco drawled.
Hermione scoffed and finally closed her book. “He couldn’t have learned Parseltongue, Harry. It’s innate, it’s not written down anywhere. Trust me, I’ve looked.”
Harry practically jumped out of his skin when Ron, who was all of a sudden lounging against the doorframe, responded. “Wouldn’t you, mate?” He laughed and walked over to his bed, flopping onto it. “Not that I want to talk about the ferret’s underthings, but a bloke could get used to silk, y’know?”
Potter shrugged. “I’ve done impossible things before. This one doesn’t seem so hard.”
“Nice, ‘Mione,” Harry said absent-mindedly, returning his attention to the Quidditch magazine he was pretending to read. Hermione busied herself with the gifts and wisely pretended not to notice.
Harry was still thinking of Teddy and his someday family when he opened the fifth letter at breakfast the next day.
Luna was just flipping through the song book, wondering aloud which folk songs nifflers would like best, when Pansy snapped. She had had enough.
Somehow, Harry had chosen exactly the wrong thing to say. Hermione’s face grew pinched, and Ron flinched, hitting his head on the heavy lid of the trunk. Fortunately, Hermione responded calmly. “No, I’ve decided to celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts this year. Lots of reading to be done.”
A bell chimed softly as Harry pushed the door open. The interior was expensively pleasant, smelling lightly of cedar and lemon. The walls were painted a dark blue, a color so deep and rich that Harry wanted to fall in. Shafts of sunlight reflected off the honey-colored wood of the fixtures, highlighting a case of shimmering sapphires and emeralds. Harry shrugged off his jacket and hung it on the coat rack by the door, feeling slightly warm as he looked around for someone to help him.
. Are you sure you must return to Hogwarts?”
Taking a deep breath, Harry locked the door firmly and cast a hasty
Harry grimaced. “You’re going to make me dance, aren’t you.”
“Your bed’s on a platform, Dr-Malfoy?”
“Would you like that, Harry?” Draco asked, already starting to unbutton his waistcoat. Harry nodded, and Draco continued. Navy trousers and a lilac button-down followed the waistcoat, and Draco was nude too. He was toned and lean everywhere, except his perfectly plush arse. Harry’s mouth watered seeing his long, stiff cock. It was ruddy and full and looked good enough to eat.
“Squeaky clean,” Draco ordered when they’d reached the correct threshold, and the door creaked open. A vast expanse of white tile gleamed before them, as though it were a competition to see which surface would be most blindingly bright. Of course Draco sauntered in like he owned the place, remarking on the new decanters of bath oils and judging the thread count of the towels. With a flick of his wand, frothy pink and gold bubbles foamed from the jeweled taps. Clouds of scented steam rolled through the room, obscuring Harry’s view.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright, Malfoy, hold your thestrals! I wasn’t presuming anything, just trying to figure out what the house was thinking.”
Rod was there with Malfoy, splayed over the vast work table and writhing in pleasure. Slender fingers of iron gripped the man's hips as Malfoy ate him out slowly, decadently, stopping only to drip shimmering praises in his lover's ear. Harry stood frozen in shock. Malfoy was absolutely destroying this enormous man in the most tantalizing way possible. And he was certainly not a bottom.
Harry quickly closed his mouth. “Right.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened in surprise before he composed himself. “You
A soft gasp found Harry’s ears. Draco stood just a step away, all roses and cream in his soft blue shirt, his sharp grey eyes consuming Harry whole. Heat rose in Harry’s cheeks, embarrassment and lust battling in his stomach.
Malfoy, who had gone stark white at the sigh of the butter, nodded. He reached for the nearest cupboard and started taking out bowls while Harry searched for another exit. By the time Malfoy had extracted about twenty large mixing bowls, Harry had given up.
He gripped his broom more tightly as Malfoy approached him. “Er, morning, Malfoy. Did you just call me your guy? Like, dude or mate? That’s what
After a few minutes of desperate snuggling, Draco interrupted. “
Harry had hoped the first day had simply been a fluke, or some elaborate practical joke, but no. Tuesday’s letter was even worse. It arrived promptly at lunch time, accompanied by a pistachio green box with a fleur-de-lis trim. Harry shook the box gently, and something rattled softly inside. He set the box carefully aside and unfolded the letter.
Hermione’s eyes were full of pity and uncertainty. “I don’t know. You seemed very happy together, but he may have been just trying to get close to you because you’re his mate. Not because you’re Harry. There’s not a lot on the subject in the Hogwarts library, but creature mates are terribly complex. It’s similar to marriage bonds after the mate bond is complete. In the meantime, his creature instincts naturally draw him to you. As Malfoy’s mate, you are supposedly the only person able to make him happy, and mates are supposed to spend the rest of their lives together.”
bloody all right, Hermione! And,” Harry tried his best to whisper, he really did, “it doesn’t help that fucking
“Harry, do you even
Yay we're back! Can you tell how much I like writing from Draco's perspective? Time to whip out all the ten-dollar vocab words.
, Potter,” was the last thing Harry heard as he turned on his heel and Disapparated away.
“It’s er, it’s good. Really good.” Harry even went as far as to rub his stomach exaggeratedly. “Um, yum.”
The first day of January was brisk, with a certain quality of cold, clear light that cut through to Harry’s bones where he stood at the entrance to Hogwarts. All was icy and still. It was a new day, a fresh new year. And Draco and Harry were heading to London.
“Arse.”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked her. She nodded, quiet as her head was surely swirling with ideas. Ron and Hermione remained utterly silent for the rest of the day (Hermione didn’t even raise her hand once in class), but the next day they were their usual selves. Harry occasionally saw Hermione rubbing the scar on her arm in Malfoy’s presence, but that was all. They did not seem to want to discuss the letter.
Harry smiled. “I guess we’ll see. I hope not.”
“I understand you’re wary. I intended to tell you eventually, but I’d hoped you would love me for myself alone, without any fated obligation. As my inheritance has effectively shattered that opportunity, I would like to ask your permission to formally court you.”
Harry scoffed, and Malfoy smirked. It would only be polite to introduce himself. Ugh, his name was probably Chaz or Dick or something awful like that--
the letter and pretend to have never received it.
Thundering down the hallway at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement always made Ron Weasley feel particularly powerful. Thick dragonhide boots pounded against the floor, and scarlet Auror robes billowed in his wake. He usually just walked instead of thundering: being a war hero and finally filling out his six-foot frame had helped Ron feel much more comfortable in his own skin. But going to Malfoy’s office always required a bit of a confidence boost. He reached the door that read D. Malfoy, Ministry Potions Consultant in ridiculous ornate script and burst in without knocking.
” Gray eyes studied Harry. “Now that you’re satisfied...I must admit, I had an ulterior motive asking you here tonight.”
, Harry!”
“I might, but I think that’s everything I have right now. Could I owl you if anything else comes up?”
“I’m done,” Hermione quietly announced. “There’s nothing at all wrong with the letter. Shall we have a look?” She cast a quiet
Seamus grinned. “I thought I wasn’t half-bad. Didn’t ya like the high kicks? Pulled a muscle, I did, solely for your entertainment.”
Harry took his time processing what he’d learned about Malfoy. He processed it in bed every night, and every morning in the shower, and during one particularly long Sunday all over Grimmauld Place until he’d processed himself raw. Finally, Harry decided he had to discuss The Malfoy Situation with Ron and Hermione. Surely they would understand his predicament.
Harry laid one hand on Draco’s chest, feeling the searing-hot heart underneath beat unsteadily. “
“Who’s courting you then, Harry?” Luna asked.
Yet when Draco rose on his seventeenth birthday, he felt crushingly, disappointingly the same. No beloved image swam before his eyes, and no pull behind his navel led him to his fate. The following year was an exercise in drudgery. Without the hope for a mate, Draco did not understand why he was alive. Particularly when the presence of the Dark Lord infiltrated every part of his home, infecting it with fear and darkness.
A shocked Harry spun around to see Draco Malfoy leaning casually against the wall, half-hidden in an alcove, running his well-groomed hands over Harry’s cloak.
“I’d like that. Race you to the pitch, Potter.”
Ron shrugged. May as well. “I’m in then.”
When Harry judged it safe to turn back around, Draco lounged at the far end of the cavernous tub, hair darkened to golden-blond by the water and toned body hidden tantalizingly beneath a layer of bubbles. Very fragile bubbles, ones that would disappear with nothing more than a breath…
“I suppose you could do worse,” Draco finally admitted, his mouth twitching with suppressed laughter.
Harry
“Same, Ron. Same.”
Malfoy Manor” to his wand. To his dismay, he had to walk all the way around the pond and down a lane on the other side. Apparently, his Apparition was much more approximate than he’d intended after all.
“You’re really interested?”
“Yes, buttering toast and talking to Zabini is very suspicious,” Hermione remarked dryly. She’d barely looked up from her book at all.
Harry glanced at Hermione with questioning eyes, and she immediately understood. “Oh, it must have an undetectable extension charm on it. You’ll have to reach inside, Harry.”
Emerging from his reverie, Harry noticed a dusty old ruby brooch next to the pocket watch in his top drawer. Ornate golden filigree surrounded a ruby the size of a hen’s egg. Some kind of crest was carved into the large gem, but it was too worn away for Harry to recognize. Had the brooch always been there? Harry couldn’t recall, but figured it was probably some Black family heirloom that Kreacher was trying to hide in plain sight. He sighed and tucked it into the pocket of his jacket. Perhaps he could deposit it at Gringotts or unload it on some jeweler.
Malfoy fell boneless onto one of the tall chairs at the kitchen island, one hand draped theatrically across his brow. “Oh no. We’re going to die here, Potter. Bury me amongst the china. If you dare chip a single piece of crockery, I'll haunt you for the rest of your days.”
“Not at all, Potter. Unless you’d like that, of course. But I’d hoped to discuss a few important issues before you disappeared again.” His hands kept playing with the cloak, almost mesmerizing in how they wound the fine fabric around one hand and let it fall. Until Harry saw what looked like an opening.
dated the biggest blokes available, and his worry fizzled into irritation.
“Leave me alone, Potter.”
. And Malfoy was sitting so close and his thigh was so strong and so warm, but it wasn’t possible for him to be actually interested in Harry. He wasn’t even bent, was he? He’d really only ever seen Malfoy with Parkinson, but he’d assured Harry weeks ago that they weren’t dating. “That vindictive bint? No, she knows too much,” Draco had derisively laughed. “Excellent shopping partner, though.” Harry smiled at the memory.
Malfoy’s eyes brightened as Harry dipped one crunchy spider leg into the secret sauce. Ugh, it tasted like pickles and old cheese: Harry now had absolutely no desire to know what it contained.
“I was walking by, and you rather looked as though you wished to be rescued.” He clapped one hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezing it lightly. Harry gritted his teeth in annoyance, Surprisingly, he felt Malfoy tense up next to him.
He shrugged and shucked off his clothes, tossing them haphazardly on a velvet chair. He wouldn’t be here long enough for them to wrinkle anyway.
The dragon had lain dormant for many years. Yet now, at the slightest sniff of Potter’s presence, it was fighting to reach the surface and reach for him. To claim him or kill him, Draco couldn’t be sure.
(See the end of the chapter for
with Malfoy. Then again, for all he knew, Malfoy created such tight-fitting robes that he did have to measure his clients’ cocks. No, that was absurd.
It embarrassed Harry to have come so quickly, but Draco only smirked. “No need to feel bad,” he said. “We both know that I’m irresistible. And next time you come, it’ll be on my cock.” Harry shivered. Something about the combination of Draco’s posh accent and filthy words dredged from a gutter entirely intoxicated him, sending heat down his spine and straight to his groin.
“Careful there, Potter. One has to be on one’s guard in a home like this.”
“Really, Dean? Right here?” Harry asked in disgruntled disbelief.
"It looks like a huge cloud. So, it's... it's either Harry will have bad luck on his Quidditch games this year for maybe... hmmm... thunderstorms or its just bad weather?" Ron shrugged at me. We really don't suit for Divination.
"Don't you worry, Professor. No one will be harm except me." He said in a bored tone and brought down the blade on his palm, slicing it diagonally.
I felt empathy for him.
"Thanks for the compliment." I barked back with a sarcastic smile.
Walking through the dim-lighted hallways and towards the exit, the way to Hagrid's hut. As the cold morning breeze swipes through my body and my face, I felt relaxed. I started to run, the wind twirling around, rustling my hair across my face.
"No, I do not regret nor will I apologize. She deserves it." Malfoy said with a hint of hard tone.
Bright!
Malfoy didn't speak but reached for his pocket and showed a locket, that was silver and had the most beautiful design of vines and roses, embedded with diamonds. No wonder Romilda will steal it. She was after all, into beautiful, expensive, and luxury things.
"Really, both of them!" Hermione said as she made the same facial expression as mine.
"Then, Potter would have more surprise and would be angry at us for not telling him anything." Draco nagged at us as he continues his breakfast, with poise and grace.
Annoyed and worried, I closed my eyes. "Everything I see, You see. Everything I do, You know. Everything I think, You are informed. You have invaded my life. What do you really want?"
I closed my eyes and slowly breathe in through my nose and breathe out through my mouth as I tried to collect my thoughts and do recreate the expression on my face that I know might be blushing from my excitement. There were so many things that I wanted to ask but  I couldn't find the opportunity to inquiry about because of him being a great distraction for me.
"Really, Draco! Do you need to say it like that?" Hermione grumbled at Draco, a scolding tone. "Thankfully, it was a success."
"Potter, I didn't know that you have become an animal." An arrogant voice said. "Seriously, you should have chosen a better meal."
Flying has always been able to make me relax. The wind blowing past me, cool and calming. The sky wide, with few clouds that cover the blue horizon. The Sun shines gently on us. I was hovering above the Quidditch field on my broom, helping our captain in the supervision of the team as they practice for the upcoming match with the Ravenclaw, 2 days from now.
She giggled.
-----------------------------------------------------------
"Inheritance?" I asked foolishly.
"That's none of your business, Potter!" He said in anger. As he was gaining his confidence with every second that passes by.
With that, Draco turned to Sirius. "Uncle Sirius, I apologize on my father's behalf. Could you let it go?"
"Now, I know why Draco loves to tease you, Harry. Your reaction is so funny." She gasps as she slowly sat after finishing her giggling.
"What kind of graffiti, Ms. Granger?" Headmaster asked.
"I- I was- I mean we were-" I started but could not say anything to salvage the situation. Being walk-in by your best friend, who is also the mutual friend of your girlfriend while making out with your ex-rival is not on my wish list!
"Are you really all right, Harry?" Ginny said as she stood beside me. Looking so worried as she looks over me.
"Stop that, George" His mother reprimanded him.
It seems the Hobgoblin that I just killed off was a scout and following close to him is his herd. Upon smelling the blood of their brethren, they attacked us. We were lucky enough that we survive that hunting team but were unfortunate to encounter them. Worse, Draco was injured as he shielded Hermione because I was too distracted. I panic and released a dangerous spell that almost set the forest on fire and might have killed both Draco and Hermione. It's a good thing, Hermione was there as she was the one, who fixed Draco up and snapped me out of my outburst.
"I think, Harry" Hermione, with her bushy brown hair, paced in front of me, back and forth. "We should tell this to Sirius when he gets back from St. Mungo. He might know something since these all started after that incident"
"Harry!" Remus called out as soon as he saw me. I already forgotten my distress, I flew to hug Remus.
"Mr. Malfoy, bring a weapon is not allowed." Hagrid tried to intervene as he reaches out to take the blade from Malfoy's hand.
"That's true," Draco said as he runs his fingers through his hair in a relaxed manner. "You should also sleep, Harry. You need to rest."
"Thank you, Malfoy for enlightening me," I uttered after inhaling and exhaling as I come in terms of my arrogance and lack of knowledge.
"How about your family? From what creatures did you came from?" I asked sarcastically, a trait that I got from him in the two days of my stay in his presence.
“Yesssh…” He smirked at us as he slowly answered, prolonging the ‘s’-sound of the word, making me gulped hard. He trudged through the forest path and we hurriedly follow him.
His thoughts shifted and without speaking, without any warning, he turned his head, fixing his gaze steadily on me.
"OoH." I muttered intelligently.
Hermione started marching across the woods, thinking deeply. I followed behind, listening to the sound of her voice - it reassured me beyond my imagination. Trying to contribute a bit, I told her. "You forgot about my enhance senses or what could have really happened to me when I attack Michael Corner after I went down?"
As soon as I spotted the so-called "cabin", it stood on top of a small hill. The cabin - no, it was wrong to call it - for it was more like a small mansion made out of fine white wood and grey-bluish stones, give off elegance and pristine.  Then came a path with tiny white pebbles with a vast land laid in front of it, full of different varieties of flowers. A clear separation of the fairy-like state mansion from the dark forest. A walk near it, the side of the manor, I can see the vines climbing in an artistic manner giving a more majestic aura to the place.
I could feel that I was blush as the heat was all over my face. Mrs. Wealsey released from her embrace then faced the twins.
"The child was murdered by a group of muggles" Sirius abruptly murmured.
Three humans to chew on...Heh heh heh... to play with...the joy...Heh heh heh...' The beast snickered as it lowered its head then immediately snapped its jaw at Hermione, who almost fell but righted herself up - running frantically away from the Gulon. I could hear her desperate sob as she reaches out her hand for us, Ron and I. I felt hot anger as soon as I saw her face, full of tears and her eyes drown in terror. I stop from my tracks and turn to face the monster with false bravery. My wand at my hand - waving it to cast a spell.
"Granger, maybe, Potter is still in a state of shock," Draco said. "Want me to hit him?"
Hagrid looked stumped by Malfoy calling him - professor, which had never happen till now.
Another appeared.
I surrender to him as I scolded my erratic heart telling it to, "be quiet".
Seriously, this is killing me.
But of course, Fate is really a naughty mistress. As we were all jogging toward the gargoyle - the entrance to the Headmaster office, in one of the hallways, Hermione almost crushed to a tall figure in black attire which unfortunately turned out to be Professor Snape.
Day and night were the same to me, the only blessing to my mind is when I was too tired that I knock myself to sleep.
"That's not true." Hermione defeated her cat. "Crookshanks is not a demon."
As I have scanned the whole list, I felt that we have many clues on what creature I have become but we never got the answers and List on what are the abilities that I might have attained but for the other questions that we have noted on the very end of the paper, we still have no answers.
-----------------------------------------------
Catching every breath, that person gave into the wind, tears that return to its beginning, sparkle of light from his eyes slowly fading from the darkness without any warning of its absconded. I let heaven cry for him as the rain falls on us, because right now I couldn’t move, as I caress his face before he would leave me behind in this world, full of sorrow.
"Come here." He said as he beckoned me with his hand. " Let's start with this one to test our theory about you."
"We didn't. But it is an essential matter, that is why we need to discuss it with the Headmaster." Hermione bubbled as she again raised her head to face Professor Snape.
"Ah, Mr. Weasley." Sirius greeted. He walked up and shook hands with a middle-aged man, red hair with old wizardry robes, Ron's father, Arthur Weasley. "Its been a while"
'Focus, Harry.' I shouted in my head.
"And your type is Redheads with freckles?" Someone asked me from behind.
"Huh?" was the only thing I said. As I remembered Malfoy's pained expression.
'Let me show you the way.'
I really think that I should find psychiatry for my mental health because right now even with the dire situation and all this weirdness, I found myself liking Malfoy's laughter.
"Not that!" I grumbled, in panic. "In a romantic way. You're making it that, I just only want you for your body."
Unwilling, my body started to shudder and there was a heavy feeling in my chest, so I gasp out for air and as it filled my lungs, the scents hit me hard - Hunger, that was the first thing I could think. A rumbled came within me, like a snarling wolf. My mouth filled up with saliva and my teeth sharpened. I don't know what was happening to me but I know that I am hungry and their food out there to eat.
"Remus about those ruins, I wanted to talk about it. Everything from what and why Sirius and Bellatrix were there? What was the thing that we saw in there?"
Smirking at my full-blown panic expression as he sniggered at me, which earn him of being elbowed by Hermione, who was glaring at him.
Draco Malfoy.
"Well. Well, it's the Weasleys, blood traitors. No wonder it has become unbearable here at Diagon Alley"

"I am sorry, Hermione," I said on the verge of tears as well. "Sorry."

"Draco!"
End of the previous chapter.
'What joy!' I rolled my eyes, more reason to be pushed away for being a freak.
'Then I am really dead now?'
Grumbling for a bit before he replied. "Then, you may call me Draco, Hermione."
"Specifically, with ash grey eyes."  Hermione followed up.
Romilda Vane is a Gryffindor. That giggling girl, who has large, dark eyes, long curly black hair, and a prominent chin. She is pretty but very conceited and often does speak in a dramatic voice. I remember that time when she tried to give me gilledwater spiked with a love potion. Shudder!
" Ms. Vane, indeed, had insulted me but such thing I can let go. After all, I also did my fair share of insulting people, especially towards Gryffindors and muggles." He said in the most adult-like manner that I couldn't help but be in awe. I mean he had the maturity to even acknowledged his mistakes in front of us.
"I have been researching these past few days before I escape from Hogwarts. In those books, there have been clues on what might have happened and what have you become, Harry." Hermione stated as she absent-mindedly reminisces her facts hunting in the library. "I tried feeding you fresh animal blood and it seems like it kind of work out. And I am here because I am your friend, Harry. What a silly question!"
"I have to go," I said as I back towards the woods to escape from him.
"Harry" Hermione whispered. "Are they still following us?"
"Stop it, Guys!" Ginny intervened beside me. "If you, two continue with the contest of evil smiles. Then everybody especially Ron will be shaking in fear."
"What do you mean seeing through my eyes?" I murmur to myself.
"Lucian, my older sibling," Malfoy muttered with a somber look in his eyes. I recognized the name that he speaks of, from the conversation we had with Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Weasley. "Lucian's grave got..." Malfoy halted as his words seem to get stuck in his throat and pain was evident on his face. "Somebody disintegrate his grave and stole his body." He finally said.
"Stop it, Michael." A female voice said. A very familiar one. Coming between us was Ginny.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
A heavy silence reign the Great hall, as the speculators that had been watching me and Michael - expecting a fight and they are now more interested in Malfoy's interference. I could see Ron, Fred, and George's mouth were all wide open, shocked as I am. Malfoy, lately these days, he had become good at surprising people.
My whole body tensed up from my anger towards him. I have not been in my top shape these recent days and I am in no condition to pretend to be Mr. Goody goody, especially if this bastard is going keep on slandering my father.
"But really, stop! It creepy." Ignoring Ron, Ginny said to us.
“Okay. Wear something warm. Draco said we will be going outside, today. Something about testing your abilities.” Hermione uttered. “See you in the kitchen. We’ll be having breakfast first.”
She grinned at me,  as she knows why I still irritated at her. Dressed in her light brown hunting gear: long sleeves shirt with black leather armor patches on her vital areas and tight leather pants with a dragon -scaled boots, courtesy of Draco, she was sitting down in one of the cushioned-sofa as she was waiting for me beside was Draco with his black turtle-neck long sleeves shirt emphasizing his pale skin, skin-tight cargo pants - leaving no need for imagination what was beneath them, and a  half-metal chest plate covering only his left pectoral as the leather straps tied and wrapped his upper torso enhancing his muscles.
Then slowly, the headmaster walks up to me and laid a hand on my shoulder, and as I look up to his face. He let out a reassuring smile.
"What's wrong with being with Draco, even he is an arse. Being with someone who can understand you, whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't matter as long as you are happy and safe. I am absolutely fine with it." Hermione said. "And an affair? I don't see any sort of affair here when the partner that you speak of has already discarded you, Harry."
"Morning, Harry," Hermione greeted as I went down the stairs as I only just wake up. "Had a good night?"
After my sanity has slowly come back to me, I saw the sun shining brightly at me as it warms me up with acceptance.
"I agree to that." Hermione nodded. "You need help on this one, Harry. This is serious."
Taking a sip from my cup as I try to feel comfortable with the tension of attraction that sits between us. I felt awkward about how to go about this situation but at the same time, I felt impatient as I just really want to touch him.
Malfoy turned his head slightly towards me but he didn't let his eyes wander off from Harry's enraged state as he held onto his wand tightly and pointed it at my friend.
"HUSH!" Malfoy said in an indifferent tone. I couldn't even sense a hint of pain in his voice as the blood trickled down from his hand but all the worrying in me vanished as the smell of his blood hit me.  His scent hit me like a charging bull. There were no words that could describe what happened to me at that moment.
'Demon! What's going on? What do they mean that I am dead?'
"Timely?" He offered as he took a sip from his drink.
Everything had been going well for me, these past few days. With the regular drinking of the dreamless potion, I wasn't able to dream about HER again. And I was also grateful for the small leather pouch that Malfoy gave me. The blood pebbles did a great job in curbing my appetite but it still unable to fully satisfy me. Well, it's better than having none, right?
I rose from my slumber trying to leap up and twist to turn away from her but my body wouldn't budge from where I lay. As I open my eyes, I saw thin silver chains had a wrap around my body, which was hindering me from moving.
"Are your injuries still hurting, Harry?" Hermione asked as she saw my irritation on my face.
Arrogant bastard.
"What do you think I am saying, Idiot?" Michael said with much ignorance. "Everybody knows that you're too jealous of Potter's fame. We don't know if you're too into that for you to do such an underhand method!"
"Hermione, since you are a genius..." Draco smiles slowly at her while he was dragging his voice in a teasing manner. "Would you be a dear and please explain it to the knucklehead."
'We killed him. He won't annoy you anymore." She smiled at me, warmly.
"I know, Harry. I know you didn't mean to hurt me." Hermione chanted as she still stayed in our embrace. "I know."
"What do you mean 'why I am here'? This is my cabin, Harry." He answered with one of his eyebrows raised.
And that would be embarrassing.
"No, I am not" he answered back.
I took one of the offered chicken legs and took a small bite. As the cooked flesh touched my tongue, an irresistible urged to vomit shook me. The chicken leg tasted so awful like it was sand that was inside my mouth instead of food. I felt my whole body broke a sweat as I forced the food down my throat. Then I hurried gulped down for water.
'Ah, that's why Ron called me a toad. I look terrible'
"So that's why." I just uttered.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Somebody broke through our perimeter.
"I can't." I said, quietly. I couldn't continue. I'm still unsure and fear this situation. I don't know how will Malfoy react.
"What?" Annoyed, I snarled at them.
"Your intention is good but the result will be devastating." He said seriously. "Your goal will cause death for the house-elves. Their extinction."
‘I wish I can snatch the smug look on his face.’
"And today is the death anniversary?" I inquired in a hushed tone.
"Yes, I will file a case against her in the old ways." Malfoy said as he started to calm down. "I will take it up to Britain's ancient council of wizards and witches."
With a shaking hand, I unlocked the stall. "H-Hermione, w-what hahaha...is happening-g with me?"
"Hermione," I said.
' I see...' He quietly murmured against his folded hands as his elbows rested on his wooden desk.
Shaking my head, I snapped out from my dazed mind. Wonders are still out there, waiting for us to be discovered and this is one of them. Walking towards Hermione, I took some utensils from her and started helping as well.
"One of my hand is still missing, so, if you be so kind, Granger please levitate Potter. I'll lead the way to my cabin." Malfoy said as he started to walk ahead of us.
2. Strength (Hermione made me carry a boulder, so yeah! by Harry) (The boulder weighed around 200 kgs and Harry can easily carry it by Hermione)
With that, all the girls within the room burst into a fit of giggles and were swooning with the mere idea of romance. My jaw slacked open in disbelief then I rolled my eyes in annoyance. Because my death predictions were getting old so it moved on to my love life. Really!!!
Draco's confident form as he crouched near the ground, almost concealing himself to the grass and blended with the bushes. His muscles flex under that well-fitted black pants as he was about to pounce like a graceful predator, his dilated eyes were focused on the prey, which was a great moose. It was at the edge of the grass-field meadow near the edge of the dark forest as it seems to be protecting its herd that was currently grazing.
----------------------------------------------
"Let's just say. I have an idea of what is happening with you" Malfoy eyed him.
From the previous chapter:
"Bloody hell! What just had happened?" Ron gasped out.
"Hey, how come you're not tried?" He asks as we stroll towards our usual sits. I froze as he sat across me. Indeed, why? Then, I remember my predicament this morning and again I felt a cold dread invade my chest. I smiled at Ron, masking my discomfort with his question.
I don't really know if they are really treating me as an adult - only in times that I have to face the Dark Lord and always as a child with any other decisions in my life?
"What?" I had to ask, out of curiosity.
Oh, let me drink it!
"But I do agree with him on this one, Albus." A woman's voice said with apparent anger in it. Professor McGonagall came in with strong strides.
"I would suggest you not to do so, Mr. Malfoy. The elders in the old Britain council punishes harshly and they will not bend the rules for a child." Headmaster Dumbledore spoke gravely.
I dropped his arm suddenly as if I was stung by his words, blood started to climb up to my cheeks as I heard his accusation. "No, it's not." I weakly denied it.
After finishing the porridge and drinking the potion, I decided to go down to deliver the used plate, utensils, and glass. Upon exiting the said room that I was staying in, I found myself walking along a beautiful hallway with high ceilings, floors and walls made up of white wood. The walls were decorated by paintings of different sceneries of nature - varying from mountains to ocean shores, each piece was wonderful and majestic but also mysterious. Some corners have pieces of furniture with the same color scheme as the room that I was staying in - pale, light, and cream. After a while, I came upon a stair that leads down and I took it. Reaching the bottom, I find myself again admiring what seems to be the living room - simple but elegant - the very first room that I saw before I pass out.
Upon entering, I couldn't help myself to be completely amazed by the said place. Inside the manor, the light can freely enter making the place more surreal as the place was furnished by light colors - giving off a feeling of peace, warm and safe. Simple and elegant that was the best description of this house, an unexpected contrast from Malfoy's nature, who is known for his cunningness and coldness.
"Draco!" Somebody called out. A feminine voice. Pansy Parkinson.
"Here." He reached out then took my hand placing a small pouch. "These could help you to curb your hunger for the meantime."
We spent the whole morning trying to drill the tactics with everyone in the team and by afternoon, we had a small break as Hermione and the girls from the Gryffindor brought some snacks. Ron was already eating his portion while Ginny was waving for me to get down to the ground as I was still up on my broom. As I was about to fly to them, I notice a group of people on the far side of the Quidditch field. They seem to be fighting or rather chasing someone. I flew towards them, and as I shorten the distance between them and me. I realizing that they were: Michael Corner and his group (Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Grant Page, and Jason Samuels) and in the middle of their circle, the one they are cornering was none other than Draco Malfoy.
I stared at her, unbelievingly as soon as she said those words."What do you mean by 'you're on the right track'? And why are you here?"
The voice replied at last. After a minute, the cave shook as a pounding of something came from the direction of where we came from. The dust and the drips from stalagmites started to fall over us.
Come in and play! You'll run and I'll chase you... Just don't let me catch you or else you might end up in my tummy hehehehe...
A scent that I hate.
"But all these options and solutions will still depend on you two, Harry and Hermione. After all, it's your lives." Draco slowly looks at me.  "Just remember your not alone. Well?"
Then finally he spoke. "Why not?"
The irony, the book kind of like talking about me except it's not a split personality. It is another creature inside of me. "What's its title?"
"Sirius," I said as I happily pounce on him.
"Yes, I still do have them but they have to less compared to before," I muttered as I pretended to be busy with my stuff.
"I'm fine, Hagrid," I replied back.
"Hibiscus tea with a hint of my blood." He spoke indifferently.
"Irish," Dean mumbled at the back Seamus
"M-m-morning" They both greeted as they yawned, walking wobbly - still groggy from sleep.
Hermione looked so intense she didn't seem able to breathe in. "You can't make me do this, Harry." She gasped out as tears started to fall out from her eyes. "You can't."
Malfoy gripped his hands, and then took a hold of my shirt. Angerly, he shrieked. "I don't need your pity, Potter!"
"You have slept for three days straight, Harry." She argued. "You need to eat."
"Hermione and I decided that your diet must be completely be changed but we have to find out what is your preference in terms of food," Draco explained. "Basing from Hermione's findings and the recent incident that involves you from changing into an uncontrollable creature. We have listed down what are your basic food and a list of what you might have become."
According to her.
In the midst of being chased by a horde of giant acromatulas and the fear of death as well as my abomination transformation and all that shit, I felt intoxicated from the adrenaline that was pumping in my veins - the thrill that sings in my every fiber of my body and the power that I could feel in every stride that I take. That made me question my sanity.
I finally understood the hatred that the Malfoys expressed upon muggles. They have lost someone. It's a valid reason to loath but not fair that they should do stereotype. Still, I could understand.
Draco and I settled down in the living room as we sat on the lounge in front of the fireplace as the fire burns the chopped logs, it creaks and breaks. Draco's house-elf pops in front of us as space, where she appears crackles, bringing with her, a pot of chocolate drink with three cups and freshly baked cookies then disappearing again with a snap, after Draco thanks her with a dazzling smile.
With my enhanced magic abilities, the two Hobgoblin went flying as high as 10 feet before falling down the ground with a loud thud sound. I rushed back to Draco and Hermione.
"Huh." Hermione dumbfounded as her eyes were wide. "King?"
My face sting from her slap, the pain woke me up. I guilty bow my head for even suggesting that. "I'm sorry, Hermione."
I inhaled deeply, shaking my nerves desperately before releasing slowly. "Okay, I will tell you everything but first, we need to help Harry. I promise you that. So, please help us.
"Draco." Hermione retorted back with a frown on her face as She turned towards the blond.
I was completely dazed. I didn't felt a spec of irritation for being laugh at instead I sighed in satisfaction as I successfully made THE Ice Prince of Slytherin laugh. It was like I have won a lottery. But better!
I lifted my head and sniffed the air. I peered around a thick tree and looked up the pathway. It was too dark for any human to see and artifacts are a must to see through the dark, but for me, the faint light that escapes the leaves of the thick trees was like sunshine streaming between the leaves: every detail was sharp to my eyes. I had my wand on my hand, ready anytime at the slightest noise.
"How are you feeling?" She asked.
"Wait, Mr. Malfoy. Please do tell us what did Ms. Vane told you for her to earn this." Headmaster asked as he urged Malfoy to return to his seat. "As I said, you are here to be heard, not to be blamed."
A few minutes had passed. My empathy for him made me uttered his name. "Malfoy." Looking at his pale face, as I straighten up and walk towards him.
"Yeah, I understand," I replied, too quickly, that Remus raised his eyebrow in question.
'Hermione, what do you mean to leave you? I'm still here.' I wanted to say but my whole body just won't move even my mouth was heavy as if something was placed on it.
Immediately, Ron's worried face brighten up at the prospect of food. "That's right, Harry. I'm also hungry." He followed me with glee. As we both went to the Great hall and reaching the Gryffindor's table, Hermione was already there, eating salad. Upon seeing us, Hermione waved, urging us to come and join her.
"It's Draco." I finally said. As the intensity of Sirius' stare bore a hole on me. I continued. "He was different today. And who is Lyra?"
Author's notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and, revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
"I- I have to think about it first," I said with my shaking voice.
I raised an eyebrow at him. As his playful manner, erase the awkwardness and tension in the air.
Fred stood up and imitated Ginny's walk, exaggerating his version of Ginny's hip swaying. "Are alright now, Harry?" Fred said in a fake feminine voice then he futtered his lashes towards his twin.
Ginny step closer to her mother, as she sensed her mother's distress and hugged her. "Of what, Mom?"
Malfoy, who was still inside our compartment sighed in annoyance as he rolls his eyes. "They're overreacting. I was gone for only 2 minutes."
"Of course, Mate. We're best mates." Ron smiled at me. "After all, we're called Golden Trio"
By the long run, the Acromantulas were still on our tail and Hermione did her best to distract them with her spells, blasting them off. As I try to focus on escaping and suppressing my blood lust. It was getting harder and Hermione seems to have noticed my suffering as she did her best to help me. Muttering encouragement and trying to soothe me. But I was so bloody hungry I felt stoned. The numbness was slowing and creeping through-out my body and I fear that the longer this chase will be, I would lose control sooner or later and I might give in to the bottomless dark hunger within me that I just want to bite off the flesh from Hermione's neck.
Then the sorting ended.
"I wrote to Severus, a letter explaining your stay with me during my vacation leave that leads him in informing Dumbeldore. So, the headmaster is aware of your situation." He said as he was playing with my fingers, fiddling them while gently squeezing them.
"You!" Shocked was carve out from her face then a force seems to have pushed her back away from me and she disappeared.
Silence.
Darkness.
I didn't realize that someone was holding my hand until whoever it was, squeezed it, and called out a name again - Harry, then I have realized it was a female who was holding me. From her hands, I could feel the warmth of her body, her blood flowing.
The three of us abruptly halted in our walk, as the voice whispered through the walls. The voice echoed and the temperature in the cave dropped suddenly into a freezing point.
"Where's Dad?" Ginny asked as her eyes swept across the room, in search of Mr. Weasley.
"I have been..." I started.
"Potter," Malfoy called out as he turned towards me.
"Ron, let me go!" Hermione shouted as she tried to push Ron's arm away. "Harry needs our help."
Casting down my eyes as I hummed in agreement with his words. I doubt that it would be any simple as to what was said in the letter that was sent to Draco. People will still fear me even though I have proven to them as many times that I want to defeat Voldemort, the Dark Lord, and not I am seeking to become one.
“Oh, it’s you!” burst out of Harry as he recognized his boyfriend.
Hermione frowned. “This is surprisingly thoughtful for Malfoy. He knows you like lilies.”
Harry grimaced and did as he was told, hating every moment of it.
“What’re you doing at our table again? And in our seats? Get back to Slytherin with the rest of the snakes. Bloody ferret, you should know better.” A vein pulsed in his forehead. Harry knew that vein, and he also knew that Ron before his morning tea was fearsome indeed. He opened his mouth to try to diffuse the tension, but Malfoy was faster.
“Deal,” Harry grinned and chucked a puff of bubbles into Draco’s face. He sputtered, scooped the bubbles off his own face, and tossed them back at Harry. Harry dodged and they hit the wall behind him with a wet slap.
Malfoy rose to his feet slowly as Harry backed toward the door. He observed Malfoy from a safe distance, taking in how the usually polished boy seemed wild and wrecked. Heaving chest. Bruised, swollen red lips. Shirt open at the neck, showing the creamy skin beneath. Luminous silver eyes stared at him in abject longing. As if he were the only other being in all the world, and Harry was tempted to turn back. But beneath that longing was a raging, hungry fire, one that threatened to consume him until there was nothing left. Fear and uncertainty clogged Harry’s throat, his heart pounded, and it was impossible to breathe. He couldn’t stay there any longer. He spun on his heel and stumbled back to his dorm as fast as his legs could take him.
Draco sighed dramatically and shook his head, lifting one hand to the intricate mother-of-pearl buttons that barred entry to his stiff shirt collar. "Very well. I suppose this necessitates a costume change. Go sit at the dining room table and wait for me.” Harry was rather hoping Draco would start stripping in front of his delighted audience, but instead, he retreated to his bedroom and shut the door firmly behind him. Not wanting to waste a single second, Harry legged it to the dining room.
“No, Mother understands the pull I feel toward my mate. And she’s headed to our French villa for the new year, so she had much to occupy her mind.”
Something small and metallic on a small pedestal started to vibrate so violently that it fell to the ground with a metallic clatter. Vines uprooted themselves from the ground and offered a sharp pair of gardening shears to the two men.
“I love myself, I want to see it…” Pansy began. Her performance of “S.L.U.T.” was absolutely dazzling, if she dared say so herself. She sashayed back to her seat and slammed a shot of soju.
Despite his whirlwind approach, Draco had managed to cobble together quite the ensemble. Harry was garbed in fitted black trousers, an emerald silk button-down, and sleek dragonhide boots. He was, however, puzzled by the last item Draco had chosen. “Draco, what’s this leather bit on top?”
Later, skin slick with sweat and pressed against his lover, Harry chuckled under his breath. When Draco asked him why, he explained "I didn't think asking just one question would turn out quite like this."
Draco had next decided the problem to be Louis himself. Despite Malfoy Enterprises paying well over minimum wage, he couldn’t muster the zeal to sell water to a man dying of thirst. Yes, Draco reassured himself, Louis simply hadn’t been enthusiastic enough; he didn’t understand the
“Of course you have to ask something impossible,” Draco spat, gritting his teeth. His eyes burned with something that was definitely not tears.
To Harry’s great surprise, Draco Malfoy himself swung open the broad oak door. He was as blond and angular as ever, but his formerly severe hair fell unbound in waves to his shoulders. He wore a fitted suit in tawny linen with a deep blue pocket square. Harry was stunned to see him in Muggle clothes at all; judging by the gawking look on Malfoy’s face, he was surprised too. “Potter? To what could one possibly owe the pleasure?”
“Harry, you’re back! Oh, how we’ve missed you!” Hermione exclaimed, half-running into the room. She pulled him a hug immediately, and Harry’s nose was thrust right into Hermione’s riotous hair. She smelled like hand lotion and thick black ink, just as she always did, and it made Harry smile.
Harry thought.
He used to bring me a platter of these as a child, as a special treat when I’d had a bad day.” He laughed softly. “I had considered naming the place Dobby’s, after him--but it doesn’t have quite the same ring as Spideys.”
“‘Mione, you should read this.”
Spending hours each day with Draco only had a
“Do you have your gloves? A hat?” Draco inquired as he tied Harry’s scarf for him. Draco had insisted he was perfectly fine in just his wool overcoat, but he’d bundled Harry in so many layers that he felt like a marshmallow man.
“Er, is the room getting smaller?” Harry asked. Now that he was paying attention, the walls were certainly not where they had been. One could easily have done laps around the room before, but now it was around the size of a large automobile.
Draco smiled. “No, they are merely a facsimile of the real merpeople. Whatever do you mean about them not liking you?”
The Malfoy lands had been a point of pride for their family for centuries. Generations of Malfoys had fought and bled for their land, against wizards and Muggles alike. Acres of rolling Malfoy property surrounded their ancestral manor, but the true glory of the family began with its gardens. The sprawling gardens encircling the manor were adorned with rambling roses, daffodils, prim delphinium and phlox. Proper English flowers, in a proper English garden. The conservatory held anything but.
Harry grinned and took a long slug of his drink. “Probably enjoying the sun, just like us.”
Harry huffed and raked a hand through his hair. “Sure, yes, whatever. But I feel like you don’t really see me anymore. I’m, you know, messy and angry and short and--”
Malfoy paused, looking Harry over carefully. His eyes sharpened as he stalked toward Harry, crowding and caging him against the wall. Malfoy was all hue and scent, exuding expensive cologne and a spicy fragrance beneath that was all him. Harry sighed and drank him in. Malfoy might look delicate, but the arms surrounding Harry were determined and strong and overwhelmingly sexy. He leaned in slowly and growled again, his breath caressing Harry’s ear and making him shiver.
Between violent, ruinous kisses, Malfoy licked a long stripe up the side of Harry’s throat. A broken groan ripped from his mouth, as though Harry were the most rare and delicious taste in the world. Then Malfoy’s hips rolled sinfully against Harry’s, sending shock waves of sparking pleasure through his body.
“Of course you have to have a fucking gorgeous cock. You’re perfect in every other bloody way, why not this one too,” Draco grumbled.
. There weren’t many, and I think the only one that could apply is
“Screw your apology. And I already know about the dragon stuff. ‘Mione figured it out.”
"Yup," Ron grunted. "Tickled pink."
“If I wanted him, yes.”
Harry grinned. “No? You sure?”
Pulling on those green robes brought color to his cheeks and allure to his eye. The man looking back at him was perhaps a bit awkward (and his hair would never, ever look presentable. Perhaps he should ask Hermione about the possibility of sentient hair), but he looked happy. Maybe even handsome. Harry knew he’d still feel rather short and scrubby next to Draco, but he was still glad to be by his side.
you may keep visiting, as long as you’ll allow me to do something with that awful hair of yours.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy’s head snapped up and she glared at Harry vehemently. “Gone, Potter. Don’t worry your pretty head, he’s perfectly fine,” she spat, all former insouciance gone. “But Draco won’t be returning. He wanted me to give this to you, but I wanted to see how long you’d take to ask me about him. Four days, Potter? Really? You don’t deserve him.” Pansy’s lip curled as she pushed a crumpled letter into Harry’s hands and minced away.
Harry set the note aside carefully and tapped the bubble with his wand. It disintegrated into a shimmering mist. Fragile, cream-colored lilies in a modest vase slowly opened, blooming as Harry watched. Harry reached out one hand to brush a soft petal, but found they were made of wafer-thin glass. A gasp escaped Harry as he realized how rare and intricate the magic that created them must have been. He sat down hard on his bed, surrounded by the scent of lilies.
“I didn’t, it was for the letter.”
escaped his mouth, but Malfoy didn’t seem to hear him. Harry wasn’t sure if it had been a question or a protest, but after a moment, it didn’t seem to matter anymore. Because Harry
“Ah, Malf--oh no, I’m sorry…” Harry stuttered, almost dropping his wand in his haste to get up.
“Malfoy,
Warnings are appreciated--but yes, happy Christmas to you too, Gr--Hermione,” he stuttered.
that Harry couldn’t bear to burst his bubble.
“Are you sure you wouldn’t care to come with me? It’s not too late to change your mind,” Draco asked, coolly handsome even in his silly fur hat.
“You’re on, Malfoy!”
For wizarding families, the character of a home is even more pronounced. Something about all that magic soaking into the foundations makes odd things occur. When generations of a family have grown and loved and perished within its walls, a house may develop certain unexpected qualities. Namely, its own personality, entirely separate from that of its residents.
“Really? Oh,
means, you know.”
Neville’s cheeks were slowly turning a deep scarlet. He began sketching a very lifelike Trevor next to the plant. (Drawing Trevor was certainly not part of the assignment; Professor Sprout did not care for toads.)
But it was only neighborly to frequent Malfoy’s shop. Harry did need new robes, after all. Or he would eventually. So Harry owled requesting an appointment, and was promptly booked for the next day.
Malfoy knelt before Harry, reaching up to measure each broad thigh and his inseam. Harry bit his lip hard, hoping the pain would distract him from thoughts of Malfoy kneeling before him in a different situation, but then Malfoy’s hand brushed against his sensitive cock far too firmly to be accidental. Harry gasped as his body flooded with warmth. He looked down to see Malfoy studying him as he reached out and deliberately stroked Harry again.
Harry rolled his eyes. "And I run a bloody yarn shop, what's that got to do with anything?"
“Weasley. Just the man I wanted to see. And Granger, too: wonderful. This is for the three of you,” he explained, passing a heavy, cream-colored envelope to Hermione. She took it hesitantly between the tips of two fingers, as though he were trying to hand her a wriggling parcel of damp flobberworms.
“Yes. You’ve been ignoring my owls.”
Harry gritted his teeth and reached for his wand. But before he could spit out some insult or question (he wasn’t sure which), Malfoy began to speak.
?” Harry groaned, long and loud. His body had rather forgotten it had bones at all, judging by how irrationally he was splayed over the sofa.
Malfoy tutted disapprovingly. “Stand in front of the mirror, Potter. I shouldn’t have to tell you this, but demonstrate good posture for once in your life.”
--yeah?”
“Ah, so this is how you’ve been avoiding me.”
Malfoy scoffed. “Call it extra credit, Potter. Besides, honeysuckle is already a vine, so it was half-done already. Bend down a bit, if you will.”
“Mal?” Harry asked skeptically.
Potter, the site to which you referred me is blocked on the library’s computers. BLOCKED. What kind of lurid filth are you trying to send me? Is it the same place where you’re getting all the awful jokes? If even the Muggles are wise enough to block it, it must be truly depraved. Please advise.
Smugly,
“Sorry, ‘Mione,'' he gasped. “But some of the girls are giving me weird looks now. Ron’ll understand.”
. He quickly told his friends about Malfoy’s invitation to Hogsmeade, how Smith had interrupted, and then how Malfoy spat flickering fire at Smith and absconded with Harry.
“It’s called a
Malfoy whipped off his apron and made for the door as though a vampire were going for his jugular. Harry chuckled under his breath again and followed.
“You ask such a thing, and you know that I am unable to refuse you?” Draco had been trapped by Potter as soon as he had made his request. He had no choice now except to go through with the boon, unless Potter rescinded his request. Draco desperately hoped he would do so, for he longer even had a heart to be wooed or (more likely) broken.
“...Complicated. I--well, I liked when he kissed me, even though it was scary.”
Harry rolled his eyes and chomped down anyway, correcting his boyfriend through a mouthful of sausage. “Shuddup, you’ll offend people. It’s called a sausage roll. You really haven’t had one?”
“Second, as I’m sure many of you will be delighted to learn, we will be hosting a Yule Ball this year. All students fourth year and above are extended an invitation, so please begin planning your dress appropriately. Finally,” she paused, waiting for the excited chatter about the ball to die down. “I would like to stress to each of you the importance of this school year. This year is our opportunity to come together as a school and build ourselves up stronger. You are not solely your family, or your house, and each of us makes our own choices. I will not tolerate any inter house bullying or strife from any of my students. I trust you will make myself, your families, and Hogwarts proud with your mature conduct this year.” Hermione nodded along with every beat of McGonagall’s speech. For once, Harry found himself wanting to do so as well. He’d never be best mates with any of the Slytherins, but he didn’t want any of the bickering or petty hexing that usually tinged the school year with irritation and regret. He knew he’d have to avoid Malfoy to make that happen (he always managed to get under Harry’s skin, even when he’d tried to behave), and was more than willing, despite the strange cuddling that Malfoy had forced on him. And speaking
how long I’ve wanted to do this to you? How long I’ve wanted to see you, flushed and panting and completely destroyed, and to know that I was the one who brought you there?” Draco growled, low in Harry’s ear. “It’s been years, you absolute prat, and of course you’ve just become more buff and gorgeous and bloody
Harry said nothing for a long moment. He could feel Malfoy twitching uncomfortably behind him.
I do not anticipate your reply. It would be far too much to expect our flawless Saviour to keep up with his correspondence. Even though he is still just a speccy git.
“I need to do this, ‘Mione. Don’t worry, it’ll be okay.”
A slow smile softened Malfoy’s face. He reached out and took Harry’s greasy hand across the sticky plastic table. “Wonderful. And if you wanted to come by again for lunch, you’d be welcome to.” His eyes fell to his lap and he glanced up at Harry through long blond lashes. “Actually, if you’d be willing, I have some marketing questions I’d like to ask. Perhaps over dinner? I could pencil you in for Friday.”
“Yeah, sounds good, ‘Mione. See you later.”
Potter grinned. “Yeah, it’s been about four months now. Surprise!” He turned back to Draco, nuzzling his cheek softly. “So, you’re coming home with me, yeah?”
The flowers were quite pretty, but they were from
“Please,” Draco grinned, holding his arm out for Harry to take. He felt rather like an aged old woman or a Southern debutante, having some young man’s arm offered to him, but took it nonetheless. It was nice to be so close to someone so warm.
and Muggle carols really cannot compare...”
The man stared open-mouthed at the menu options, his banal confusion melting into something far more alarming. “Hi, could I get the, uh...wait, what is this place again?”
“Don’t
“What?” a confused Harry asked, shirt hanging half off his tanned shoulders.
of apparition split the room, but Harry saw only the tip of one pointy ear poking from a nearby cupboard. Apparently, that was as close as Bitsy was willing to come to strangers. Malfoy shrugged and continued, slightly more calmly. “Tea, please. With those apple cheddar scones.” The tiny ear bobbed in agreement, and another crack indicated the house elf’s disappearance.
And then Potter’s eyes met his. What captivating eyes he had, like a mossy pool in an ancient forest. Sweet relief washed over Draco, and he felt cooler than he had all summer. The dragon within roared with the delight of possession, urging him to touch and woo and claim his mate.
Silence.
Thanks for the invitation, dinner sounds great. I’m very much looking forward to it.
“Ron learned one word from hearing you say it, Harry. Malfoy would have to have done the same, and you’re the only Parselmouth we currently know of.”
Harry turned to exchange a stunned look with his friends, but to his surprise, they were already huddled together at the Gryffindor table. The letter lay flat on the table, surrounded by an opaque bubble as Hermione waved her wand over it again and again. Checking it for hexes, then: even though Malfoy had said it wasn’t cursed, Harry couldn’t blame Hermione at all for checking.
Malfoy seemed mollified by Harry’s hasty compliment, and they cleaned up together in silence while the biscuits baked. (Honestly, Harry did most of the cleaning. Malfoy located the washing-up liquid, which Harry grudgingly acknowledged as helping, and pointed out errant crumbs on the counter, which he did not.)
"Brill. Bring Potter, yeah? I know Blaise is already bringing Hermione.” Parkinson turned to Malfoy, tipping his face up with one long lacquered finger. “And what about your mystery man, Draco? Would he condescend to join us and our motley crew?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I suppose some exercise couldn’t hurt,” Draco said thoughtfully, turning up the tall collar on his cloak. “I won’t be inviting you in, of course.”
Harry thought. “Er, your hair is long now…’s different.”
Now, only a few days later, Harry half-wished he had gone to Malfoy Manor with Draco after all. He scowled at the winter storm rattling the common room windows and snuggled further into his woolly jumper. Christmas was supposed to be a jolly time, but this year, Hogwarts felt terribly empty. Usually it felt like home, like comfort and friendship and childhood all wrapped together. But this year the holidays were off somehow. Madam Pince was in a snit after discovering one too many damaged books, and the very air of the library felt harsh and toxic. Harsh winter storms had made the Quidditch pitch entirely unusable, the weather only clearing long enough to taunt Harry before it fouled again. Even Peeves seemed to be feeling low; he’d only abducted Mrs. Norris once, and the ridiculous outfit he’d dressed her in had none of his usual panache.
not. Good night.”
Harry wondered.
Harry gawked at her, dropping his goblet. Luckily, there were only a few drops left, but they both winced as it clanged loudly against the stone floor. “What?! But we’re barely adults! D’you think it’s a wizarding thing, or a Weasley thing? Or,” he made a face, thinking of Draco and the kind of expectations he might have, “a pureblood thing?”
A fragment of fragrant parchment dislodged itself from the ceiling and fluttered to the floor. Malfoy picked it up and read aloud:
“Harry, you can’t say ‘yuck’ about what is probably a ridiculously lavish courting gift.”
Thank you as well for procuring and setting up my mobile. I already have so many more pictures of Scorpius than I would have otherwise. They don’t move, but they are precious to me all the same.
“Is it a matter of concern?” Narcissa asked.
Now Potter was practically leaping about the stage, all of his earlier shyness having faded. He raked a hand through his shaggy hair, lewdly shaking his hips in Draco’s direction and flashing him a lascivious grin.
“Did you like dancing with Malfoy?”
), I set myself the task of learning how to use a computer. Hence my reason for initiating this correspondence.
Harry loosened the drawstring of the velvet purse. He glanced inside and saw...nothing? Maybe Malfoy had forgotten to put the gift in?
Harry began to realize that he was not, in fact, very good at taking care of himself. He shouldn’t be eating beans on toast five times a week and running ten kilometers every night. Most people didn’t avoid relationships with the terror that he did, preferring covert encounters with strangers in bar bathrooms. Panic attacks haunted his days, and nightmares his nights. The countless hours he spent working out were a form of self-punishment, rather than self-care. He was not happy.
“Long, long ago, a beautiful witch dwelt in a village with her father,” Malfoy began. He wove a bizarre tale of dragons and fate and fire. It had a strange dreamlike quality that Harry tried to shake off, but he felt himself transfixed regardless.
The man wrapped one gargantuan arm around Malfoy, who curved into him happily, flicking a challenging glance at Harry. He seemed to be daring Harry to say something insulting, but all Harry could feel was a faint tinge of worry. Malfoy seemed so small, so fragile compared to the vast man beside him. But then Harry remembered that Malfoy
“He kept calling me his mate…And then he
She smiled, warm and amused, before turning back to the window. “Thank you, Draco. You too.”
too much to ask if you don’t want me seeing my friends. It’s too much if I’m not allowed to talk to anyone but you, and you keep trying to push me into fucking you before I’m ready. I might never be ready, and you said you’d accept that, but now I don’t know what to think.” Harry sighed heavily and glanced away from Draco, into the brush. “Hermione thinks she’s being subtle, recommending all these books about unhealthy relationships, and I’m starting to think she’s right. We’re not good for each other. You’re not good for me.”
“Er, maybe later. We’re actually here on official business; the Ministry has received some complaints.” Harry flipped open his notebook, brow furrowed as he studied his scribbled notes. “Apparently you’re trying to sell a Class D non-food substance as food, deep-frying it, and serving it with a special sauce of which you won’t disclose the ingredients...yes, I think that’s it.” He snapped the notebook shut and dropped a steadying hand on Ron’s shoulder. (He had just noticed the large, lurid pictures on the menu board and was starting to hyperventilate.) “Care to explain?”
My hands started to drift towards the edge of Draco's shirt as I seek out to touch his warm skin. My fingers reached within his clothes groping his stomach, his whole body jerked and he abruptly pulled away from our kiss as he pants. "H-harry" He gasped. The way he called my name to send a strong emotion in me that made me anticipate more, I was instantly becoming hard in my trousers. I was ready to completely eat this creature within my arms as I push him on the lounge and climb on the top of him when...
"No, your not." Hermione was in full-blown panic as she tried to climb down from my arms. "Let me go, Harry. I can run. I have to set a barrier. PLEASE!!!" She was desperate as I tried to ignore her cries. Finally giving in to her pleas as I nod my head at her. Then slowly I let her off and I took out my wand as I protected her while she prepares her spells for the barrier.
"Good afternoon to all of you, young minds" A wishy-washy voice came about. Professor Trelawney had arrived with her huge eyeglasses, threatening to fall from her face. "Today, we are to unfold and clear the paths of our future, take a glimpse of whatever lies within our souls."
"No," I said. My voice was raspy, I guess I must have been shouting longer then I have thought. There was a long silence between us before Hermione broke it. "Nightmare? The same one?"
It had been hours before the tears in our eyes has finally stopped from flowing. We settle ourselves on the edge of the queen-size bed. I was informed that I have been unconscious for straight three days which had made Hermione worried.
"Yeah..." I said as I hid my face. I just want the ground to swallow me whole.
I turned to the headmaster Dumbledore and spoke about our summer's adventure with the Gulon and the nightmares.
I open my mouth but no sound came out as I wanted to reassure her that I wasn't mad at her but no words came out from me. I could not form a convincing sentence to let her know that I wasn't affected by the news because I already expected it that much.
"I heard from Hermione that you were still having the nightmares?" Remus asked.  As Remus moved to sit on the bed. It made a squeaking sound and the slight trembling was felt.
Under me, I could hear Draco snorted as he was amused by how I am making a fool of myself. "Very intelligent of you to say. Harry, my dear. Also very original as well." He snickered. "Actually, Moine isn't blind. You're the only one who oblivious to it."
"I'll be fine." Mrs. Weasley said, softly. "Just take care of him, even his wife. She might also be in shock of what did happen to her child."
Hermione is my best friend and my sister - the one who understands me the most and nothing could change that.
Waving our wands to shrink everything into Hermione's beaded bag that was charmed with Undetected expansion spell. In about ten minutes, we were all done and we move out of the area to a different location with Disapparation.
After a good minute, I finally come to terms with my inner struggle that this is really happening. I slowly took out a chair from the dining set and sat in an abandoned way as the chair creak from the forceful way, I sat down. Hearing the creak, I could hear Malfoy grumbled, quietly.
"Mr. Malfoy" Professor McGonagall tried to call out. Her face showed concern and fear in it.

We lurched into one another as we landed in different parts of the forest, under us were dried up leaves with brown, black, orange, and yellow in shades. The woods were thick as they grew near each other and even though it was morning, almost no light can pass through the dense canopy above us. I began to breathe in the cool air of the forest, the scent of the earth, and could hear the slight sway of the branches felt heavy on my ears. I couldn't anymore hear the heavy footsteps, only the forest's sounds.
“Thank you, Tiffany. You are the best.” He grinned at her as he took the plate.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Please do, Mr. Potter. This is an immediate matter to be solved, after all. I would like to ask the three of you to wait outside for the meantime." She asked softly.
"Shut up, Granger." He said then brought the knife to his left hand and slice across it. The blood from his hand was dripping fast and as its scent hits me, I started to struggle more. But the lad didn't panic or flinch away from me instead he walked slowly towards me. A very unusual sight that had made me stunned as I cease from moving and fighting my ropes. And upon reaching me, unexpectedly, he raised his wounded hand and place it on my lips.
I don’t want this. I don’t want you to go. Don’t leave me. I need you. I love you. You are my life!
"Sorry, Ron. I'm j-just..." I mumbled, uncertain of what I could tell him.
Chapter 09. SCREAM
Especially, Draco.
"So, how are you feeling, Potter?" He asked suddenly. "Hungry? In pain? Or feeling sick?"
"Laugh if you want" Malfoy uttered. His body unconsciously stiffens as if to guard himself against us, to whatever taunting he had expected.
Hermione tensed up and paled as she heard Draco. She gripped her wand as she nervously followed Draco, hidden behind the thick bushes that surround us, I also end up following her as she pulled me down in urgency.
"I understand." She said, her lips were so tight that form in a thin line. "I'll cut off his dick,"
"Potter, it's given willingly and not taken forcefully." He said as he took my hand and placed the warm tea. "Just think of it as blood donation or to humor yourself think of it as how a donor mother gives her breastmilk to another child." Then he took off as I laughed at his sarcastic comparison of my situation to a mundane matter.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Fear started to struggle with me, cutting off my breathing. A coldness swept in. I wipe my sweat that started to form on my forehead with a trembling hand. I could hear my heart quickens like it was vibrating through my body. 'Calm down, Harry. Calm down!' I thought to myself.
"What about that one?" Moine pointed one as she stared at the largest of them, the one on Malfoy's head.
My voice barely carried over the sound of our hunters, the Acromantulas' pincers clicking in excitement as a mob of them crash in front of the thin barrier that we made. The barrier made a breaking sound as it was about to disappear from the sheer pressure that it was receiving from the Acromantulas. But it didn't stop Hermione from jumping from her place as she took out her wand in a defense position.
"Is that's so. Then it means you going to be fine." Hermione sighed a relief.
Thank you for being here, Hermione!
He took out a knife.
"What's this? Trying to escape already with another girl, Potter?" Michael smirked as he walks up to me.
I was feeling hungry.
Hermione cried out for me, in panic and terror.
"What?" I dumbfoundedly uttered. Then I realized that my legs were shaking and Harry was already laid on a white soft-looking couch.
“Tsk, tsk…Oh, Harry, you’re such a liar.” She accused as she giggled and glide around me. “I was watching you as you got drunk by the marvelous taste of what I have an offer you, surely you can’t deny it?
"Always happy to correct you, Granger." He said finally, with a hint of teasing in his voice.
"I think... They are not following us." I said as I still listen for any movement out of the ordinary. "I can't hear them anymore."
Message: I am so sorry for everyone. It's been a while. I have been having issues with my laptop and I still don't have the money to buy a new or even fix this old laptop mine, so please bear with me. Thank you for understanding!
"Okay," Draco said as he steps closer and raised his hand over my head then SMACK!!!
"Yep!" He answered with hype as he gathers all the scraps of paper and walked towards the trash can and throw it all out. He took a fresh parchment and his feather, dipping it in the ink, and began writing again with his make-up predictions. Shrugging, I followed his example cause I am fed up with trying to make a decent Divinatiuon assignment. We continued predicting our doom days this whole month for another hour while the other people around slowly left for bed and emptied the common rooms - leaving me and Ron having the whole room for ourselves. After finishing my Divination assignment, I move up to my Charms assignment, which was about the movement of wands when conjuring a spell when the portrait hole opened and Hermione entered the common rooms. She was carrying a stack of books in both her arms as she made her way to us, placing the books with a loud thud as she laid down on our table.
Everyone was having a mixed reaction with what Malfoy revealed, some are with disgust, some are with awe while others have no idea how they could approach this.
As soon as I saw that Malfoy was in danger, I made a dive, speeding down towards them. I suddenly feel a boiling sensation in my chest, realizing that I was extremely angered by their action. I can hear shouts from my friends and my teammates but right now, my mind only focused on getting to Malfoy before they could hurt him.
Draco blinked in surprise. The wind whisked through the woods, carrying a scent of earth and herbs.  "We need to, Hermione. Magical creatures seldom come in the meadow that is why we need to hunt in the darker and deeper part of the forest."
This is a Deja vu. Like the situation, when we met at the Diagon Alley. I couldn't help but become more amazed by Malfoy's change of attitude. He had indeed matured and the funny part is: he is scolding THE Professor SNAPE, in front of us - just like what he did to his father, the last time.
"Yes, Draco?" Halting from walking, I curiously turn to him.
"What do you mean 'I guess'?" Hermione snapped at me. She suddenly grabbed my shoulder and urge me to stand up. "Let me see them. Let's go to Myrtle's bathroom."
I cleared my throat awkwardly.
Draco looked up and stared at me, intensely. I huddled down inside my oversized pajama, which I forgot to change when Hermione and Draco were both insisting on me to eat first. I need to find better clothes to wear if I were to live with Draco, even for a short period of time. I don't want to look bad.
The raindrops fall on to our tent as it - pitter-pattered. And as the rain grew louder and stronger, now and then birds would chirp as the thunder would roar, the wind would howl and, the lightning would flash across the sky. The cold air from the forest would swipe in our tent, while Hermione and I had sat across each other with a cup of cocoa in both of our hands.
Chapter 10: A Deal with the Demon
I laughed as it was true after all.
Sighing, I slowly got up and followed after her. When Hermione is determined, no one can stop her. Upon arriving at Myrtle's bathroom, We entered. It seems to be Myrtle wasn't there to bothered us, I went to a stall and open my shirt, to see if there was still damage but as I reached the buttons in the middle of my shirt, I froze and started to gasp as I panic. My gasping was heard as Hermione pounded on the stall's door.
I want to eat them, both of them. Right. Now!
3. Dumbledore's none interference on Harry's situation will also be tackle later on as well.
No Darkness.
------------------------------------------------------------------
As minutes pass by, it became clear to him my so obvious clueless state as he sighed heavily at me, in mixed frustration and sarcastic sympathy.
Standing straight with the aura of regal, the blonde turns to the female saying. "What benefit would I get out of this and why should I help you?"
After, what seems to be an eternity of waiting, Draco finally looks at me and chuckles breathlessly. "Do you still want to kiss me?"
No misery.
As if remembering that we are wizards and not muggles, Michael took out his wand and pointed it at me. Coward! Since he can't win by duel of fists or duel through Quidditch, he would cowardly use his wand on an opponent that doesn't have any weapon of some sort. Malfoy was far better than him. At least, he would wait for me to draw my wand. Challenging me, a respectful rival. Michael started to yell words to attack me in rage, forgetting that it might result in his expulsion. He yelped out the Entrail-Expelling Curse.
"Yes!!!" He must have been too focused to be startled that much.
My blood boiled in anger, like magma churning deep within me. I want to punch somebody but I know I shouldn't. My anger is a hunger for release - to have destruction or pain. The pressure was too much to handle as the raging sea drives me crazy and numb. I could felt that my breath came fast and heavy. My whole face was hot and my eyes, which I took a glimpse from the reflection of the mirror in one corner - showed glaring red with rage. I want to let it out - curse at them, be violent and just...
"Yeah, I remember that day." Ron interrupted. "You and Ginny were blushing as red as a tomato."
Malfoy stared at me, long enough to make the skin of my whole body and my face - warm and weird that I cough out loud to break the awkward silence between us.
Hagrid, why the hell do you love these creatures!?
"Well then. On what business do the, three of you, have with me" The headmaster asked.
'Let me show you the way.'
That's the last thought in my mind as darkness invaded and I heard Malfoy's shouts as I fell asleep.
"Scared?! Ha! You wish, Corner!" Ron stood suddenly from his chair, following his lead was Fred and George.
"NO! Stop that Malfoy. I am not that kind of person." I shouted as I felt so embarrassed. I cleared my throat then I speak again. "So. In my dream, this female demon was urging me to just let go of my self and let her take control of me."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"You are wrong when you said it wasn't Potter business to butt in." He smiled in a sneering manner. "It is Potter's business."
We continue to wander inside the cave as Hermione explained. "According to Scandinavian legend, it a hodgepodge of various creatures, usually described as being the size and shape of a large dog, with some cat-like features such as the head, ears, and claws. It is also shagging and it has a tail of a fox or a dragon."
Hermione rolled her eyes at me, saying it to me in her gesture 'Really, Harry!'
What is really happening to me?
"Sirius?" I asked as soon as I released him from my embrace, looking around to see if there's a mop of black hair among the midst of redheads or even a sight of a huge black dog but none was found.
=====================================================================================
I returned to the room, that I previously slept in after the talk with Hermione was done. I felt tired as I laid on the soft mattress. An emotion engraves within me, starting to leak then erupt out from my chest - it was hot, painful and it is making me unable to breathe. Then I realize that I was angry.
I almost smile at Hermione's chattering. Trust Hermione to be calm in these kinds of situations. "I am not silly, Hermione." Then I froze. "Escape?"
Screams and yells in horror followed and fear to reign them all. Others came in to surround me with their wands up and on defense while others run for their life into safety. All the suddenly, From being their champion, that they cheered and revenue and now I am a horrid monster that they are trying to get rid of.
"What are talking about?!" I barked in anger as I was accused by Malfoy.
New abilities:
He bowed his head near my ear and whispered. "Calm down, Potter. Your eyes are turning red."
The pang of starvation, the dry yearning of thirst...its making me lose control over my body, my mind and myself. And the bullshit bloodlust is pulsing all over my body. I started to shake, I fell on the floor, on my knees and my head bow as I pant harshly.  Hermione was busily brandishing her wand to add more support to the erected barrier, her sweat poured as she was giving her best effort to protect both of us.
"Mrs. Weasley, more beautiful than I last saw you" Sirius cheekily vocalized as he moved towards her and kiss the back of her hand.
As minutes pass by that seems to be hours to me. Hermione finally giggled.
"Hello," Luna said with daze expression.
"I have other theories that I want to try, Harry. Is that alright with you?" She asked me.
"Oh, shut up, Malfoy" I retorted in an annoyed tone. Then, a sharp pain erupted on the top of my head. "Ow!"
"What?!" I, ghastly, asked. I am not used to this new Malfoy.
"Potter, you might be a Strigoi"
As agreed, after finishing our breakfast, we went out to try out some of the theories that Hermione and Draco have formulated on the past few days when I was still was knocked out.
00. Prologue.
With nothing else to do, I roamed for a while. Walking onward, through the veil of snowflakes when suddenly a rush of strong cold wind blew past me, it ruffled my hair and fluttered my clothes.
After an hour, Professor Trelawney slowly walks table to table to check on the activity that she instructed us. Commenting on the results and the figures in each teacup of each of her students. I felt a sudden burst of irritation as she reached for us. I'm sure she is going to say something about my untimely death. Again! Just get on with.
"Thanks, Draco," I whispered as I stared affectionately at the teacup in my hand.
"I just can't sleep," I replied to his question.
I slowly came into consciousness from my deep sleep and started feeling my whole body. My senses took over as it tells me that I am safe wherever I was. I felt the soft satin mattress underneath my body on where I lay, caving in from my weight, and the fresh cool breeze that came from (I guess) a nearby window as it gently tangles up my wild hair. The fragrance blew by me was a mixture of pines, lavender, and freshly wet earth that told me that I am still near the woods. I could hear the birds' chirping, the rustling of the leaves of the trees, creaking of the branches, and the muted voices of two people that I could distinguish that belong to a girl and a boy.
Realizing, that I am again in the same nightmare. I look down at the ground. I am standing on an ocean of dark red blood as it flows and raises to my ankles. Chills run thru my body as the sensation of liquid trickle down on my body and as I felt the stare directed at me. I turned and then there she was again. Her pale face, submerged with madness, as she smiled at me, wide and with teeth. Her eyes were unfocused and hungry.
"Harry?" Sirius tapped me at my shoulder.
My entire body stiffened. "Yes..."
Slowly, Malfoy dropped his hand and showed it to the class. His palm had no wound, not even a trace of a scar was left. Many whispers and murmurs going on about.
"How do you feel?" A quiet masculine voice whispered in my ear. I turned to Draco as I heard him asked.
"Potter." He said as he reaches out for me. "I can help you."
My demon must have found it amusing the panic state and my denial that I was in. As she continues to giggle at the back of my mind. 'I told you last night, Harry. That I'm close, right?'
A resounding sad sigh was heard from somewhere as I slowly realized Draco sat beside me as his hand rub my back comfortably and hypnotically that slowly smooth my sorrow. How long did I crumble down? I did not know. Long enough for Hermione to be asleep, as she was still kneeling and her head lays on my lap, her cheeks stained with tears. I slowly unfold my body trying not to jostled her awake. I straighten my back, my spine cracks, stressed from bending. I grumbled as the pain shot from back to my waist. My eyes sting and swollen, as I tried to open them.
I open my eyes for the first time and gaze above me in absolute surprise.
"Well, it hurts now," I grumbled at him. 'Jerk' I sneaked in under my breath.
"Sorry," I said as I tried to find any food that I might appreciate.
"Sirius" I called.
I desperately took a hold of his jacket and yank it with so much brutal strength, that I have never known that was in me. "I'll do anything for my best friend," I said, harshly.
"Remus, don't tease Harry too much." Billy chuckled, huskily. "He is still in a daze. Its seems to be last night, you and Ginny had a good time!"
Malfoy just stood there. Not speaking, but his eyes speak another. His stare was so cold and the anger in it is freezing like ice. Ron also sensing that this wasn't the usual Malfoy, took a step back. After a minute, under those gazes, my body started to sweat. Then he looks away to face Hagrid. That's when I realize that I was holding my breath as I started to gasp. I also notice that both Hermione and Ron were breathing heavily.
‘I wish I can snatch the smug look on his face.’
"Yes, let's do that." She said as she took my hand ushering me away from the whole group. "To Headmaster Dumbeldore?"
"Not really," I replied with an unaffected tone. Michael Corner was a trying hard bully, he was far less intimidating than Malfoy. Easy to ignored.
Author's note:
"Stop! This is not going to lead me to hear you out that the dream turns out to one makeup session because I don't to hear the rest of the story" He said in must force and fake disgust in his voice.
"Yes, it is I," He said sarcastically. I almost rolled my eyes from his sarcastic and dramatic way of speech but I know this not the time to do such things. Harry needs me.
Sighing, the Headmaster Dumbeldore slowly stood up. 'Harry, do you recall anything when you fell from the pit?'
Now, that I think about it. There was something different about him. He still got the arrogant aura, aristocratic robes, slick smooth down white hair that seems to have grown out to shoulder length since the last time I have seen him. His face that still had the sharp edges, had become more adult-like, more of his mother than of his father. He was the image of his father with the mellow and softness of his mother. But what was so different was his facial expression and his stormy grey eyes - held sincerity and the sadness in them instead of the usual smirk and presumptuous look. I wonder what had happened.
"Okay, then sleep after drinking this." He offered the teacup again.
As we exited the beautiful tiny mansion, what greeted us was the warm ray of morning sunlight and the overgrown yet elegant garden of Draco. An aroma of herbs and flowers gently float over us as the fresh and cool wind had blown towards our direction. Just beyond the makeshift fence, made of the stock up white stones, were rows of pines and wild bushes - a formidable barrier, if I say so myself as it did its purpose of hiding the whole infrastructure.
"Until Alice's Domain, right? Our final place to check in our list." Hermione whispered as she bowed her head, like having a deep thought.
Chapter 15: Hermione's cry
"Help me?" I tripped over my feet as he came near me. "HOW?"
"Ron." Hermione scolded him.
'Do you want to live, Harry?' Said the voice in my head.
4. Stamina (I didn't get tired with a three hours hike by Harry) (Increase stamina with no signs of being tired after running with a speed during three hours by Hermione)
Laughter invaded the whole common room as relief and gratitude spread in my chest. I'm really blessed to have them.
"Sirius" Remus snided as he elbowed him.
"Do tell me, Professor McGonagall. Why I am the only one to be lectured about this incident? I thought that you will hear my side of the story and not assume that I was the only one that had done something wrong. Isn't it too unfair?" Malfoy said coldly.
"Really, Granger. You forgot to ask him when you have been with him for more than two hours." Draco grumbled as he sarcastically jabs at Hermione.
Even his words are still full of sarcastic aura, I could identify his concern for my well being. Maybe I could tell him about HER...
The herd upon seeing their leader got killed off, run away in panic as I heard the thundering stomps of their hooves.
--------------------------------------
"I apologize for being here," Michael smirked in my direction. " But Potter butt in, an issue that he doesn't have any concerns"
"Hermione!!!" I screamed at her as my face turned into a different kind of red shade.
"That's good, Harry. We get to go back," Hermione laughed as she jumped out of her seat out of excitement.
"Yeah but not too hard," Hermione answered.
"Call me Hermione."
"I can't say" Mrs. Weasley muttered gravely. "Confidential and personal. It's about a workmate from your father. All I know is tragic."
I struggle to come out of words that I could say to her but it seems to be I run out of words itself. Then again, I need help and what are the best people to talk it about but my best friends.
"Are you okay?" Hermione asked.
1. Inferi/ zombie (heart stop then restarted but not a corpse, still breathing, not soulless by Hermione) (REALLY, MOINE!!! I still look handsome by Harry)
"This is a pleasant surprise. Having both Slytherins and Gryffindors visiting me at the same time." Appearing out of the blue, Headmaster Dumbledore slowly materialized in front of us.
Draco Malfoy entered, without a word, and shut the door, abruptly before leaning on it. Apparently, Malfoy is all alone since Crabbe and Goyle weren't following him behind.
“What?!” Harry squeaked as Hermione bubbled with suppressed laughter next to him.
Yule Ball time! Also some reeeaaal uncomfy friend stuff, but everything turns out okay.
“Er, can I kiss you?”
“Well, fuck,” Harry sighed.
Saint Potter,
“Good.” Draco felt rather than saw Potter smile, and they stayed staring up at the night sky together for a long time.
“We haven’t much choice, I think,” Malfoy frowned. “I wonder if we’re anywhere near the end. Let’s go.” Together they walked through the door into a grey marble bathroom. Plush white carpet covered the marble floor, leading to a dais on which stood an invitingly large bathtub. Curling steam shimmered from the water’s warm surface, interrupted occasionally by clouds of bubbles or crimson rose petals. A bottle of champagne sweated in an ice bath beside the tub, accompanied by two sparkling crystal flutes. As Harry stared, a tray of chocolate-covered strawberries popped into existence and settled near the champagne. The air shimmered in the air over the strawberries, and he dreaded to think what embarrassing possibility might appear next.
Pansy cackled. “I didn’t even have to do anything, this is amazing.”
Harry awkwardly shuffled forward and stood a few feet away from Malfoy. For once, the other boy wasn’t scowling or sneering. His sharp grey eyes were utterly inscrutable. Malfoy studied Harry for a moment before he stepped terribly, heart-stoppingly close.
Harry paused in his pacing and glanced at himself in the mirror on the back of the bedroom door, noting the glazed look in his eye. No, he’d better not think about that. At least...not right now.
Ignoring the scowl on Ron’s face, Harry agreed and snuggled even deeper into his bed. “Yeah, whatever you like, ‘Mione.”
Harry’s carefully organized thinking collapsed into confusion again. What had Malfoy been
Harry huffed in disappointment. “Well, that theory’s shot.” He tore his eyes away from the Slytherin table to top off his glass of pumpkin juice, and a memory flashed into his head. “Wait! What about the, you know, the creature thing you were talking about when we first returned? Maybe he’s got a snake inheritance or something?”
“Good night,
Draco pouted rather becomingly as Harry told him about rescuing Ron and Gabrielle beneath the lake’s murky depths, and Harry could tell he was jealous. He dared to brush a kiss against Draco’s cheek, but quickly retreated behind a second sandwich to prevent anymore.
A shocked Harry nodded. Technically they weren’t really hurting anyone...but when had he eaten the whole damn thing? Had Malfoy really talked for that long? Had Harry really
“All right.” Harry laughed. “It’ll stop any girls trying to ask me, and no one will try to cut in if I’m dancing with the snooty Prince of Slytherin. I should’ve thought of this earlier.”
“--so the manor was trying to
A grumbling Harry found the iron gates to Malfoy Manor waiting at the end of a winding country lane, tucked behind a lush green hedge. They weren’t latched and gave at his slightest touch.
! I said I’d give you a chance, and I did. I just wanted to have a quiet year for once, and this...this is too serious for me. I don’t want it.”
"Not spin the bottle again, Pans,” Blaise interjected. “Surely we did enough of that in eighth year. We’re not at Hogwarts anymore.”
The hallways were hushed as Harry stepped through the portrait hole and made for the grand staircase. He caught sight of Draco’s white-blond hair from yards away, and the beauty of him stopped Harry in his tracks.
“I’m sure you’ve tried everything. But it is a magical bracelet, Harry. It probably doesn’t want to be returned.” Her expression softened and she took his hand. “Look, I know that you ended things with Malfoy for excellent reasons, but have you ever really let go of your feelings for him? Are things really over between the two of you?”
which he definitely couldn’t do while he was so
Draco gasped as Harry flipped their positions, pushing Draco against the wall and grinding their hips together.
Malfoy placed the hamper on the ground (he’d insisted on carrying it), pulled a silk handkerchief from his sleeve, and enlarged it to the size of a blanket. He laid it out with a flourish and patted the spot beside him. “Scared, Potter?” he asked, gazing coyly up at Harry through dark blond lashes. Harry suppressed the shiver that wanted to run through him at
Potter paled. “I mean, I s’pose someone has to go. Alright then.” He spun the bottle on the table, watching as it slowed. The neck of the bottle pointed directly at the shocked face of Draco Malfoy.
“Anything for you,
Yes, Harry Potter is perfectly fine. Draco Malfoy, however, lives life on another level. And it drives Harry Potter mad. It's not Malfoy being gay that bothers Harry; he came out himself a few years ago.
Draco sighed. Skilled fingers slid under Harry’s shirt, removing it quickly. One hand toyed with Harry’s nipple as Draco surveyed his prize with the hungry eyes of a predator. But Harry was already achingly hard, so he only let Draco admire him for a moment before grabbing his regrettably perfect arse and pulling him back in. Draco’s mouth was pleasure and pain, sin and forgiveness, all at once, and Harry knew he’d never forget his taste.
Harry flushed. That sounded like a
For as long as he could remember, Draco had always been lonely. It was at first the loneliness of a pampered child on a large estate, kept company by house elves and peacocks and an endless string of tutors. He spoke French, his first and truest language, with only his mother, erecting another unintentional barrier between himself and others. At Hogwarts, his loneliness morphed, resembling the solitude that only the most influential and popular experienced. He was surrounded by admirers, lackeys, or even envious enemies, but kept them all at arm’s length. When the Dark Lord came to Malfoy Manor, Draco’s loneliness shifted and became invaluable. The fewer people knew him, the fewer people he had to protect.
“How bizarre. Does it want us to arrange flowers?” Malfoy pondered, tapping one long finger against his chin.
He smiled triumphantly, until he stepped on Hermione’s toes again.
“Really, Pansy? The Weasel?” Draco sighed as he pretended to inspect his flawless fingernails.
“Skip to the good bit, D. Nah, I’ll do it. Harry, listen to me closely:
“Course I am. I look smashing.” Harry smiled, as gently as he could, like trying to comfort a startled animal. Just when he thought he should probably make his apologies for misunderstanding and flee the house immediately, Malfoy began to disrobe.
“Very funny, Ronald. Anyway, open it, Harry! I want to see what it is.”
Harry grimaced and made some inane comment about the flower beds. Their conversation was stilted again at first, but by the time they’d worked their way through the biscuits, Harry had a stitch in his side from laughing at Malfoy’s stories about Bitsy and her vendetta with Pansy Parkinson’s elf. Malfoy had grown rather wan in the kitchen, and Harry was relieved to see a bit more color in his face (not that there ever really was much to begin with). Inevitably their laughter slowed, and the tea grew cold. Malfoy rose and peered at the conservatory walls, searching for some kind of hidden catch or lever, but nothing was found.
“It has the incredibly misguided and cockamamie idea that you make me
httpss://youtu.be/PWeeAoJAq9w
could be happening; but if it was, it was certainly Malfoy’s fault.
“Fancy a walk?” Potter asked as they stepped out onto the pavement. Blinking lights and honking horns a few streets away pervaded the cool night air, but it all felt rather distant and hazy through the fog that was beginning to set in.
“Thank you. Shall I pour?” Draco asked, nodding toward the tea set perched on the tabletop.
"I'll take care of him" Ginny steadied me as I stood. "You should rest for the meantime, Harry. Lie down on the divan."
"You should never answer back," Ron said in a frightened expression.
"That's new." Someone sneered at the back of the room. I glanced at the speaker, expecting it to be Malfoy but then I remember we were having a class with the Ravenclaw. The one who spoke was Michael Corner. Confused, I raised my eyebrow at him as I couldn't remember offending him for me to be treated in such a manner.
"See yeh at the feast." Hagrid smiled as his gigantic silhouette loomed over the first years. It was a tradition that the first years reach Hogwarts by boat guided by Hagrid.
I set aside my feather from scribbling my charms' answers and straighten up from my seat - looking around if there were still people around. The common rooms were empty except for us- sitting by the fire. Hermione took her wand and perform a private bubble spell. I look back at Hermione, who just smiles at me, and Ron, who was confused but was waiting.
"Yes, It is a symbol of Gluttony. It is vicious and is said to kill prey larger than itself and gorge until it can't possibly eat any more. It feasts on meat be it from a corpse or being ripped from a living." Hermione said in a monotone voice like recited from a book. "It is said that no leftover of the victims as it is a feast upon by the Gulon."
"Granger, wake up!" a loud and annoying voice called out. "Do I have to say 'please' just to wake you up?"
Snapping me from my day-dreaming, I searched for the source of the voice. There, from the far corner of the room, a female house-elf stood. A flash of anger blooms in me as soon as I saw the little creature.
"Seamus," Malfoy called out. "This is one of their uses. To heal wounds. They also have other uses like - tracking wounded people, finding the location of the injury, and many other more."
Summary: Harry Potter's life changed drastically, turning around 160 degrees completely. In an accident, he turned into a creature of the dark, feared by all. When the temptation for the call of the blood and flesh becomes too much for Harry. He becomes desperate and seeks help but many of his friends and colleagues turned away from terror and disgust. True bonds are revealed. Friendships are tested. Draco Malfoy, an old enemy, unexpectedly, becomes the light of Harry's dark world.
It was a relaxing morning, that I could say as both of us were mesmerized by the pouring rain outside our tent. It has been a week since Hermione had found me, all of those days had been spent on understanding what had happened to me but alas the mystery has yet to be solve as both of us has only come up with an idea that the change I had undergone into a dark creature, who craves blood and flesh - was no accident but was orchestrated by someone and I have a nasty suspicion that my demon was the one behind this. It was really frustrating because with all the clues that were right up on our faces, we cannot go on with our research and the reason why is I have no idea who the heck or even the name of my demon. Add to that was our limited reading source materials and time that we spend on researching had lessened since we still have to find food and move from one place to another to prevent us from being caught by the ones that were haunting us.
"Hermione, your really a genius!" I laughed as I held both of her hands with glee.
Your no god, Harry. That's why don't blame your self always. Remember, you are Harry. A wizard. Stubborn and cute. Awkward teenager or the brave hero but foremost, what is important is: Harry is Harry. That's who you are. Don't forget it.
"Yes, Of course," I said with much vigor. Her being had given me much courage to live on.
"Granger, you should sit down before you fall asleep on your feet." Malfoy quietly spoke from the doorway, as he stood there observing her and Harry.
"Oh, that's right, Harry, I forgot to ask you." Hermione stood up and walk up to me as she looks me up from head to my toes for inspection. "Are you in pain?"
"Remus, it's good to see you," I uttered as I move away from Sirius to hug the said man. "I miss them" I, vaguely, though.
Then in one crazy second, my reflection smirked at me and all I could do is stare at it. Slowly, The image in the mirror morphed into her. My nightmare was slowly creeping to my reality.
"She spoke?" Hermione repeated. "What do you mean 'She spoke', Harry?"
Anyway, I hope you see that I am trying and enjoy my story. Thank you.
Should I tell him? You say.
"I- I have to think about it first," I said with my shaking voice.
Hermione was looking at me, expecting my answer. Her face that had held a curious expression turn into shock as her glance met my gaze, and I saw the reflection of myself in her eyes. My face had twisted with overwhelming sadness and anger. An expression that I never saw on myself. Compassion spread on Hermione's face as she abruptly stood up from her seat and went to my side. Her arms encircle my shuddering body without fear of what I have become.
It had been hours later or at least it seemed like hours instead of minutes when finally Hermione erected the barrier around us, far stronger than the previous one that we surrounded our tent. The first large acromantula came crashing unto the barrier with a loud bang, screeching in pain as it was thrown back from the rebound effect of the barrier then a second later the others followed. One by one leaping and running towards us, only to be hinder by Hermione's barrier.
"Ouch! Hermione, your really heavy-handed." Draco rubbed the area he was hit by Hermione.
Let's play! As the wheel of life and death starts to spin, what will happen? We can not know for sure.
As I was distracted and Hermione was still busy with the other Acromantulas, a smaller one was able to sneak through our defense and was able to jump on me and bit thru my left shoulder. I was startled with the sudden pain, whirling around so fast (thankfully, enough to throw off the spider) that I nearly lost my footing and had to re-adjust my hold on Hermione as I almost had let her fall.
