Draco loved this part of the Manor. After his father's death and his mother's exile in France, he entirely redecorated the whole house, making it more welcoming, brighter and warmer to live in. He didn't want to raise a child in the surroundings he grew up in. Plus, he needed the past to stay in the past.
"How could I forget? Hello, Mr Potter."
"Well, well! I thought I would not be seeing you today, Darling. How was your night? You seem... satisfied!"
"When did you find out?"
“It’s okay, Dray. Even if Scorpius is the only that I have, I will be happy. Because I know you are his father and that you’ll raise him well.”
“Good. They went to see Tory, that’s why they’re late. Where is Marco?”
“I know. But I don’t want my son to be raised by House Elves. I told you so before.”
Her gaze fell on Teddy and Draco suddenly got it. Of course! Andromeda knew what he was going through as she took care of her grandson on her own after his parents’ death.
Draco sighed in frustration but lied back. Of course, he would need the third finger. He had Potter's cock in his mouth a few minutes ago and could still feel the burn in his throat and how stretched it had been. Plus, he hadn't fuck in weeks, probably months. He definitely needed it. But he wasn't a patient man so, when he started to moan as the three fingers moved deep into him, Draco reached behind and grabbed Potter's black hair.
“Well, if you’re not too tired, then...”
“Non, merci. Nous avons prévu de manger dehors. Par contre, je ne sais pas si c’est encore possible de réserver une table pour demain soir ?”
"Well, they're my friends and I love them way too much to deprive them of a family. Plus, as I'm gay, it's more likely that I won't have any kids in the future. So, it may be my only chance. Even if it'll never be

So he waited. A long time. Way too long, even for him.
, then.”
The blonde man frowned. She already offered him a few things. Books, a new quill, and the keys to their family house in Scotland. She even offered Harry a book on Quidditch, which was nice of her. And safe. But now, she had another gift? For the two of them?
“You know it’s not what I meant, Draco. It’s just that you’re a Pure-Blood and, yes, you were raised as one. And Pure-Bloods don’t take the plane.
comfortable?"
"I don't know; but in Hogwarts, you always were a real dick to me. I couldn't believe you would ever let me fuck you one da, but I was wrong, I guess."
“Parfait. Avez-vous ajouté un lit bébé, comme demandé ?”
"Can't you see it? Aaron, Kyle… Every guy I date are blonde, thin and beautiful. Just like you."
Draco nodded and relaxed as much as he could. Slowly, Potter made his way inside his body and finally settled with a sigh. Draco moaned as he kissed the back of his neck in an attempt to distract him from the pain, but it wasn’t really enough. The burning sensation was there, sharp, but he knew it won’t last. So, the blonde man rolled his hips under Potter’s and whimpered a bit. He felt so full.
They smiled at each other and, after one last kiss, Potter was gone.
“He’s so tiny. And beautiful.”
The other man didn’t reply right away. “They won’t, Draco. They’ll survive.”
"You want too?" He seemed surprised.
Draco complied and took the baby from her. He was already half-asleep anyway. “I’ll let you rest, Tory.”
"That's easy to say for the Saviour."
“I know. Thank you, Doctor. You saved their lives. It’s the only thing that matters to me.”
“God, you’re gorgeous.”
“Yes, but you’re very loud.”
“Good. You can go put your things there, then we can eat.”
The both of them smiled at each other. He could have been free, but he chose to have a family instead. But his son, he promised it, would be as free as he wanted to. No matter what.
"Huh?" Draco, whose head was still buried in the pillows, didn’t notice the change. But he did notice Harry’s stillness. "Why are you stopping?"
“Daphne, Sweetheart! Hello my Oliver! How are you doing? Did you see your cousin?”
Harry did ask him if he wanted him to leave once or twice, but Draco would always shake his head and ask him if
Draco chuckled. “Oh, yes he did. He kissed and drooled all over his face.”
“Fuck, Harry! Don’t stop, please.”
“He is?”
"Some? You redecorated the whole fucking place!"
His mother loved Draco’s gifts too. He offered her a beautiful painting made by Pansy and a very pretty and showy golden necklace. Harry too, brought something for her, and the tears that clouded her eyes upon discovering it took Draco by surprise.
"You thought? What did you think, Potter? That I would fall for your sweet words? That you could say you want me and have me in your bed in a heartbeat? That's not how it works, Potter. People don't always do everything you want. That's called freewill."
"Yeah, I think I’ll find it. If get lost, I’ll just curl in a corner and wait for you to find me."
“Yeah. And you thought you didn’t belong there. Everyone loved you, tonight.”
“Très bien. Il me faut juste une signature ici, puis quelqu’un vous conduira à votre suite. Souhaitez-vous que je vous réserve une table dans l’un de nos restaurants pour le dîner ?”
"You're drooling, Darling."
Draco shrugged. "Why would I? The baby will need both his parents. And our relationship’s great so, there’s no need to get a divorce for now. Maybe one day, if one of us fall in love or something and want to marry someone else."
"I-I know that, I just… I thought you felt the same. Your eyes… I just thought you wanted me too." The dark-haired man let go of his arm and took a step back before straightening up. "I'm sorry, Malfoy. I was wrong, I clearly misread the signs. You can forget about it. It won't happen again." He nodded once, then turned around and started to walk back to the bar.
“Really? You don’t know?”
He got up to follow her, only stopping to throw a last look at Potter.
“Touch me.”
“No buts. Tomorrow... well, today, we sleep in. That’s final. Poppy will come if needed, but not before noon. At least!”
********
"Yes. But he still was my father. And he's not always been like that. Not at the beginning. The last thing he wanted was to see our name disappear."
"Don’t say that. She’ll be wild, that’s all."
That’s exactly  what Draco had to do. Not fuck all night, although Astoria would be open to that, with the pregnancy making her very horny sometimes. No, he had to forget about Potter, not to think about him again.
"Yes, for example."
"He stayed. That’s good. You’ll need him."
“Yes, of course.”
"Perfect! Don’t move!"
They looked at each other for a while, smiling, until a soft cry made them look at Scorpius. All diverted he was, Draco had let the baby bottle’s nipple slip out of his mouth, and he seemed rather angry at that.
"Why? Is it… difficult?"
"I don’t!" He shouted before sighing. "Stop reading my mind, please."
“You’re right, she would be sad. But I also think she would understand if you choose to wait for your wife.”
“Sorry, Mother. We had trouble tucking Scorpius in this stupid baby seat.” He looked at Harry, both their eyes bright with amusement. They had trouble, indeed, installing the baby in the car. And after fifteen minutes of pushing and pulling, they had both seemed to remember they were wizards and spelled it correctly in place.
"So, she agreed to a loveless marriage just  so you can have a child?"
“The hotel doesn’t have two-bedrooms suites, I think. But I could ask.”
Draco shook his head. Here, he was doing it again! Doubting and thinking too much. He could see in Potter’s eyes the love he had for him. He could feel it in his kisses, in the way he looked at Scorpius. He loved being here with Draco and only a fool would deny it.
"Really? They ask you to give them a baby, and you say yes? Just like that?"
“You’re the only one who can say it like that and make me feel so horny.”
?" The green eyes widened. "Oh! You thought that…" Then, he burst out laughing. Draco was a bit annoyed by that reaction. What was so funny? "Gin and I are not together! I just came with her because Luna couldn't. That's all!"
“Oh, she’s good. I’ll tell her you’re coming today with little Scorpius. I should go, now. The sun is rising. And, congratulations for the birth of your son, Sir.”
They toasted to that with a laugh.
He scowled. "I'm perfectly well-behaved, Malfoy!"
"But now it does." He nodded. "Because it’s Potter." Another nod and it was Astoria’s turn to sigh. "I’m sorry, Dray. I don’t like to see you hurting. But it’s only a matter of time, right? Just three little months and baby will be here. Then, the vows will be unnecessary and you can be with Potter freely. You know I won’t mind having him around."
“You too. It feels nice.”
“Hey. Harry, look at me. I love you, okay? I love you and Scorpius loves you too. And we both know you will not let anything happen to us. Ever. You are not cursed. Trust me, I know a lot about those. Nothing will happen.” He repeated and leaned forward to kiss him.
"Don’t apologize. Are you hungry? I heard there’s pasta."
When he saw him tense, Draco stopped everything and let the member go with a 'pop' sound. Potter groaned in frustration but helped him get up.
Draco smiled lovingly at the thought of his baby. "Yes."
The man frown, frustration clear in his eyes. "What? But I thought…"
“I just feel... insecure. All the time. I know you love me, but I can’t help thinking that you’ll grow tired of me and leave us. I feel like you could leave me heart broken and, honestly, I don’t really care about me, but Scorpius... he doesn’t deserve to be abandoned.”
Draco was in the waiting room of St Mungo's obstetric wing, reading an article about some stupid singer doing some stupid thing, when a couple entered the room. He merely looked up, not at all interested in them. He had a stupid article to read, after all. But, as the couple took a seat across from him, a startled voice called his name and he had to look up. There, just in front of him, were sitting Harry Potter and a very pregnant Ginny Weasley.
"Bedroom, Potter. Now." He said against his lips.
"I don’t know. Do you think we still have time to go to-" He was interrupted by a scream almost painful to hear.
"Malfoy! Wait!"
"Oh! I see." The woman grinned and yawned. "Well, I have no remorse in wanting to sleep, then. Go join your Potter, big man."
The man turned his head back towards her and straightened up on his chair. "I'm not."
Draco, now Lord Malfoy thanks to his father's death in Azkaban, had been invited by his future father-in-law, Ignatius Greengrass, a close acquaintance of the Minister. He had thought of not going, given his past, but decided that if he wanted to clean his name and reputation, a ball at the Ministry was a good place to start.
"Do you still want to, one day?"
"Hey Malfoy..."
For a long minute, Draco remained silent and immobile in the living room, his eyes staring at the closed door. Then, he broke down and fell on his knees. And Harry was immediately by his side, taking him in his arms and talking to him silently. He couldn't hear what he was saying, words didn't matter. Only his presence, the sole anchor preventing him from sinking into despair. He stayed motionless in his embrace as they waited long and endless minutes. It seemed like hours, but he didn't really know. He didn't really care actually. All he cared about was behind this closed door. His wife and baby fighting for their lives and one question haunting his mind all of a sudden, almost out of nowhere: since when, exactly did he started thinking about Potter as
"You’ll wait for me?" Draco nodded and Harry smiled. A big, wide smile that made Draco’s heart flutter. "Good. Then I’ll wait for you too. And, when you’re ready, I’ll fight for you. And for the baby."
Draco snorted. “Sorry to tell you this Potter, but most Slytherins are immune to your charm. And almost everyone tonight was from Slytherin.”
Potter quickly walked back to him and looked straight into his eyes. "I did?"
“I know, Sweetheart. But... do you think it’s a good idea to start a new relationship now? With Scorpius and all... What if he leaves? Having a new-born is never easy.”
"Yes, it will. It always hurts. But you’ll recover eventually. You
The nurse came in. “Lady Malfoy needs to rest, Sir. You should leave her and come back later in the afternoon?”
“Good, good. Hello Mr Potter.”
"Right away, Master"
"Were you jealous, when I kissed Kyle?"
“Don’t worry, Dear. I casted a warming spell on the terrace.”
“Just promise me, Harry.”
“Yes, before we boarded. But he didn’t eat everything, so I guess he’ll be hungry again soon. Oh! I forgot his bag in the car!”
Draco turned to him, grinning. “Is it? Est-ce que je t’excite, mon amour ?”
“You still can have a-” The door opening interrupted Draco and, when the Mediwizard came out, both men got up. More carefully for Draco that was holding his son who had fell asleep again. “Doctor? How is she?”
"Alright. Let’s go."
And Potter did exactly as he was told.
"Pandora?"
Draco smiled. He appreciated Harry’s efforts to distract him from what was happening in the other room. “In Greek Mythology, Hyperion was one of the Titans. He was associated with the Sun, the Light. I thought it was beautiful as my son has been my light since the beginning.”
*********
Draco tensed up and gripped at his chair. "W-What? Stop kidding, Pansy."
for Scorpius.”
"I don't know what you're talking about, Pans. Plus, it's Saturday night, and Saturday night means 'only the two of us'."
Draco took his hand and pulled him on the bed with him. He lied on his back, legs spread wide open and Potter settled between them, his hands automatically grabbing his thighs.
He nodded and leaned over the crib to put a kiss on his baby’s head. “See you later, my son.”
“I know, it’s a bit too much.”
“Is it time to go?” He whispered, not wanting to wake the baby up.
"You can put it that way, yes."
He leaned in and pecked the top of her head. "You too, Honey." Then, he turned around and left the room, quickly followed by Potter.
Draco nodded but he wasn’t' looking at her anymore. Instead, his attention was focused on a wiggling Scorpius. His little face was upside down and he knew he was ready to cry.
Harry looked at him, his eyes soft. “No. I want to be here with you and Scorpius, Draco. More than anything. You already know how I feel.”
"But you don't want to?"
"They never do, Tory." He said without opening his eyes.
Draco didn’t care at the moment and ran out of the bedroom while trying to put his shirt on. He ran through the hallways, his heart beating loudly against his ribcage. He thought about everything that could be happening. To his wife and to the baby. But he refused to panic. He had to be strong, no matter what. He stormed into Astoria’s bedroom only to find her sitting on the floor, with tears flowing down her face.
“Here Scorpius. This is your room. Look, there are bunnies and dragons everywhere. No need to be scared, they are just here to protect you.” He whispered, afraid to wake him up.
Draco nearly laughed at that. He could perfectly imagine Potter in those kinds of situations. But when Potter took his member in his mouth, he just stopped thinking.
"I think I’ll sleep, now. I’m feeling a bit tired. But I can wait, so you won’t eat alone."
“Everything about you makes me horny.” Harry slid his hand into Draco’s pants and touched his already hard member, giving it a squeeze. “If I listened to my desire, you would be naked and screaming under me all the time.” He pulled at his pants and took out Draco’s member. It was already leaking pre-cum. “But I still have some decency, so I keep my hands to myself and use my imagination. But tonight... I don’t care what time it is. I’m gonna make love to you, Draco. Nice and slow, until you can’t remember your own name.”
Potter put his empty glass on the coffee table. "You've always been more mature than me, Malfoy."
And then, he disappeared through the door.
“What... what does it mean, exactly?” He was afraid to understand.
"Thank you, Poppy."
“I just compared every possibility and decided it was the safest. And what’s the issue, anyway? If you’re used to it, why are you moaning about it?”
Draco thought about making him wait for a bit, but he couldn’t do that. It would just be cruel and it would certainly deny him an awesome night of sex. So, Draco locked their lips again and moved his body against the other’s.
“You should go take a nap with Scorpius, boys. Merry will tell you when dinner is ready.”
"Does she have your eyes?" Draco asked without really thinking about it.
to be discreet.
Draco smiled all the way to his chambers. He loved those moments with Astoria. Even for just a few minutes, it seemed all so simple and natural. In just a few years, she really did become his best friend, like the other part of him. He couldn’t help but think that the birth of their son would change everything. Even if he loved him already and even if he loved his wife, things will change. They always do in those types of situations.
“Good. The weather was nice and we didn’t have any turbulence.”
But when they were both clean and dressed up, the two men looked at each other in the main room, clearly not really knowing what to do next. Or not ready to do it.
After almost thirty minutes of content silence, he still was not tired of looking at his son. He would probably never be, anyway. But he heard Astoria whimpered and looked at her face only to see pain on it.
Draco squealed when Harry rolled him on his back and crushed him with his body.
“Of course, I don’t want him to catch a cold. Come in, boys.”
"I know. Think about the baby. He’ll be here soon. Our son. Aren’t you excited to meet him?"
“You’ll take care of him. And you’ll love him enough for two. I now you’re...”
"You're not trusting me, are you?"
"Don’t." Draco sighed.
"Draco." He turned his head towards Harry and followed his worried gaze. Blood. All over Astoria's legs and the bedsheets.
The man shrugged. "He’s a good fuck. A bit of a screamer, but that can be fun sometimes." Draco blushed. Hard. "But apart from that... he’s not very interesting to talk to. That’s probably why I get bored. I’m tired of pretty faces. I need... more."
Potter grinned. "Really? So, you finally acknowledged my manliness?" This made Draco laugh.
He grabbed Harry by the shoulders and pulled him up to lay on him. “No sleep, I want you to fuck me.”
"No, I lived it. Do you think they were easy on me? It took them more than two years to stop following and talking of me every day. Even now, there isn't a week without them writing an article about me."
"Maybe, Potter. But I can’t promise you anything. The baby... my son will always come first. No matter what. But if you’re ready to accept it and try anyway, then..."
Harry leaned in and kissed Draco’s lips before they both fell asleep in each other’s arms.
Draco knew he was thinking about his wife and smiled. "Yes. Astoria is fine, although extremely tired. She doesn’t leave her bed anymore."
"What’s going on, Draco?"
“Because Astoria won’t be here tonight and I’ll be.”
"Draco."
"Lovegood. She and Ginny are together. They got married last year."
“Sorry, Ignatius. Actually, I don’t really know what Harry and I are. He wanted to help me after Scorpius’ birth and given the circumstances, he stayed. But... I don’t know, really.”
“I don’t know how you feel. Tell me.”
"You’re okay?" Potter asked, his fingers brushing his jaw and neck.
"I know. I guess it reassures me to hear your voice when I get here as I can't see you right away. To know you’re okay."
"Yeah."
Draco sighed in the kiss. Finally. After guessing it for so long, he finally could hear him say it. The young man rolled on his side too and wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders to deepen the kiss. But as he wanted to take things further for the first time in a month, Harry let go of his lips, laughing slightly as he whimpered at the loss.
"The baby's... coming. Hurt, Draco."
“Yeah. A month ago. Things may have changed, now.”
The man under him laughed at that and grabbed his hips, quickly finding his way inside Draco again.
"Sorry, I don’t get it."
"Now, stop talking and do what you came here for. Fuck me, Potter. Nice and hard."
“I said
A wave of emotions ran through Draco’s chest. He knew all that because he talked for hours with his wife about Harry and what was happening between them. But after a month, he still didn’t have the courage to ask him what
Draco thought about it. Yes, they could try in a few months, when his son will be here and the vows he made will be obsolete. He could wait. But he also knew it wouldn’t be that easy. Even if he was willing to try, was he ready for that? Being Harry Potter’s boyfriend? And was he ready for the moment the man will finally leave him? Draco looked into the green eyes and smiled a little.
"Yes. Oh God, it hurts so bad!" She cried out and grabbed Draco’s hand again. "I can’t do that! I’m sorry Draco, but I can’t do that! Take him out of me and-"
“I know.” He said, even if he didn’t. “Thank you for being here, Harry.”
"Weasley." He said, as politely as he could, but the redhead was already gone.
"I can’t risk having him enter our son’s life without knowing if he’ll stay. It’s not a big deal if Potter leaves me. But the baby... I don’t want him to grow attached only to lose him after."
Draco flinched. Her fears mirrored his own almost perfectly. Did that make them more justified? No! Harry promised him he’ll never break his heart. “I know that. But Harry stayed when I most needed help. And he stayed after that. He’s not here only for the easy moments.”
“He’ll look so cute in it. You’ll have to show me later.”
"No, you don’t understand. I never felt... I’ve fucked a lot of men. Like, a whole lot."
"What kind of Patronus is that?"
Draco nodded. “You’re right. And we surely don’t want that to happen. Don’t we, Scorpius? We want Mommy home healthy, right?”
"Then why even bother if you dump them after a week?"
"Pure-Bloods one?"
“No. Not this kind of damage. I am sorry, Mr Malfoy. I did everything I could.”
"Please, call me Astoria. Do you want some tea?"
“For being a dick.”
Draco burst out laughing. The day before, the three of them spent Christmas Eve with Astoria at the nursing home and her gift to the new couple surprised them both. A one-week cruise on the Mediterranean Sea on next summer for just the two of them! He couldn’t believe she offered them that. Even the beautiful necklace he offered her seemed really pale next to it. The two men told her it was too much, but she had just laughed it off and waived her hand. There was no talk needed.
“Where?”
In the darkness, he thought he saw some redness take over Potter's face. So, he too could blush, then.
“You’re way too sexy, Potter.”
The second time was two years later.
“My... son?” He froze. No, his son was in Astoria’s belly. He couldn’t...
Potter immediately walked to him and took him in his arms. “Of course, I will. Come on, let’s have some sleep.”
was drooling. Merlin, the view of Potter’s back was... amazing!
This new year would be amazing. And even if it wasn’t, he would make it amazing. Because he was the one to decide what he did with his life. And because he finally had everything he wished for years ago. A family, a son, friends... and Harry. The love of his life.
The more time went by, the more Draco was in love with the man. He loved seeing him take care of his son, he loved talking and joking with him, he loved spending the night in his arms and just spending time with him. But he couldn’t stop himself from doubting. Again. Did Harry really love him? Did he stay because he was afraid of hurting Draco? He couldn’t help but expect something to happen, for Harry to leave him. And times like this, when they would fight, didn’t help at all. It didn’t happen a lot and never for serious stuff but, every time, Draco felt more vulnerable than ever. He felt as if Potter was holding his heart in his hand and could crush it anytime. It wasn’t sane to keep it all to himself and knew he had to talk to Harry about it. He needed to protect Scorpius more than his heart.
"Wow, that's…"
He showed his friends with his chin. "The party. It’s for my birthday."
“Do you know where my... friend went?”
“Don’t apologize, Love. I’m always happy to kiss you.”
Draco almost rolled his eyes but thanked her. She had seemed so surprised that he called Potter his
"So, how do you want to do it? Usually, I'm on top, but…"
“Okay. I love you, Draco.”
"Fuck!" He needed that. He'd neglected his sex life for far too long and, now, he could feel that he will probably not hold long. "Don't… play too long, Potter."
The young dark-haired man smiled after a while, then he rolled on his side until his face was a few centimetres apart from Draco’s.
The sight of his back walking away from him broke Draco's heart. What was he doing? He wanted Potter since Hogwarts and when he offered himself on a plate, Draco turned him down? If he thought he was stupid before, it'd gotten worse! But he still couldn't do it, right? Because Tory… Fuck! The baby would be there in three months! He did his part of the job and could start living, now, couldn't he? Plus, Potter wasn't proposing, or asking for a love story with the whole package. He wanted him. That's all he wanted for now. Maybe it would be one night, maybe more. But they didn't have to promise each other anything for now.
"Yeah, as wild as her dad."
"No! No time for this. Just fuck me, Potter."
"Tory. It’s her Patronus." Harry looked at the orb and frowned.
“Don’t worry, Andromeda. I make sure he sleeps and eats well.”
Draco frowned again. Was it that obvious? "Well, that doesn’t change anything. I made a vow."
But now it was different. The war was over, they were adults, both gay… There could have been something between them, and that's why he stayed tonight, but once again, he was stupid to think that. He wanted Potter. Badly. But the thing was: Potter didn't want him. He was just curious about his life and his choices, that's all. Tonight, Potter would fuck this Kyle guy all night and not think about him at all.
“Did they? Must be my natural charm.”
“Vous êtes logés dans la suite palace vue mer, Mr Malfoy.”
Draco shook his head. "Probably not, Potter. I have a wife to go home to."
"Like what? Go home and chitchat with your lovely wife?"
Draco chuckled. "Ah, now that's better. What do you want to do?"
Yet, he was a hopeful mess. Even now, when he was seating right in front of Potter. Even now as he knew his wife was home, alone and very pregnant. He knew she was okay with it, for him to date Potter after the birth of their child, but Draco was still unsettled. He wanted to wait, think about it for a few months after the birth, enjoy his son and his new life before bringing someone new in it. But it was hard to stick to that decision when green piercing eyes were burning holes in you.
him. And he thought he was beautiful. The man moved closer, his hand still on Draco's arm.
"I..." There was despair in Potter’s eyes, and he knew it was the reflexion of his own. "I understand. But... maybe later? After the birth?"
At that, Harry moved closer and kissed him. One of those kisses that take your breath away. And Draco briefly thought that he could never be kissed differently anymore.
The two young men stayed there for a minute or two, panting heavily, then Potter pulled out and cleaned them up with a wave of his wand. Draco dressed up again silently. He was a bit ashamed of what they’ve done. Fucking like horny animals in a public office. With the door open!
"Hey!"
“You’re welcome. I think it’s best if Lady Malfoy rests here, she’ll be more at ease than in the hospital. But, if you’re okay with that, I would like for one of the nurses to stay here. Just in case. I will come back tonight to see how she is and give her more potions.”
"Yeah. I want you too." He didn't specify for how long he'd wanted him. Not relevant at all.
"I was just startled. That you’re gay." He added when Draco threw him a questioning look. "I didn’t know."
? The man shrugged and, arrived at the top of the staircase, he turned left to take another corridor. At the end of it, he opened the door and entered the nursery.
"And, if after the birth, you want to see me again... You can owl me anytime."
"…Potter? What do you mean, exactly?" He wasn't sure. He heard the words, but his brain couldn't understand their meaning. He was afraid to understand.
“Really? He has your hair.”
"How is she? And the mother?"
Yes, Draco loved his chambers and could spend days in here or in his office just next door. By the look on Potter's face, he loved it too.
They laid against each other naked and kissed desperately, until Harry straightened himself and brushed his hard member against Draco’s entry. When he pushed inside, Draco slightly tensed, but relaxed when the tip passed through the ring of muscles. Harry was still as huge as ever and after a month nearly without sex, it felt like the first time all over again. Once he was buried deep in him, Harry stilled for a moment, allowing him to adjust, then started to move. Slowly, like he said. And it felt so damn good. Harry changed his thrusts’ angle a few times until Draco almost screamed and planted his fingernails in his back.
With a frown, he got up, emptied his glass and left the bar without even saying goodbye to Pansy. They were used to that and she knew perfectly well he would be going home no matter what. He had to come home every night. That was the deal. No night out if it's not been planned a week prior. The young man silently walked down the street. He could have Apparated right here, but he needed to walk a bit. Just to straighten his thoughts.
“We should go inside, Mother. The weather is nice, but...”
“Come and sit on the couch, Draco. You’ll be more at ease.” Harry whispered and led him to one of the couches.
“What will I do?” Draco asked suddenly, breaking the silence.
“Thank you, Mother.” Draco yawned discreetly. At least he
"I was." Then, as she was looking at him curiously, he added. "Potter was here."
The man moved closer and shook the extended hand, almost shyly. "Hello, Lady Malfoy."
Draco sighed. “Because Scorpius is way too young for us to apparate or take a Portkey. I don’t want to take any risks. Plus, planes are one of the safest mode of transports. Well, that’s what Muggles say.”
“Are you sure, Mother? It would mean you won’t see Scorpius as long as you wanted to.”
But, when he thought he was about to lose it, the man above him suddenly pulled out. Draco wanted to protest, but Potter took him by the waist and turned him abruptly on his back before spreading his legs wide open and plunging in him once again. Draco almost screamed when he pushed inside him, hitting his sweet spot right away. The moans started again in rhythm with the thrusts, until Potter leaned in and swallowed the sweet noises in a deep kiss.
"Exactly. Oh! That's good!" Je moaned when the dark-haired man took his neglected cock in his hand. "I wanted that too at the time."
The little creature disappeared and the young man sighed and closed his eyes. He was already exhausted. Good thing it was Sunday, or he would have had trouble focusing all day. Then, the thought of being distracted from work by the feeling of Potter’s cock lingering in his ass made him almost moan.
"Yes. Huh… I guess you remember Potter?"
“My boys! You are finally here! I was worried something happened to you!”
"No, thank you. I'm good."
“She had what we call an Ablatio Placentae. It means her placenta detached and caused the intense bleeding. Without your quick reaction, we couldn’t have saved her. But... I have to tell you something else, Mr Malfoy. In order to save the baby, we had to do an emergency C-section. Once he was out, the damage on your wife uterus were visible and... beyond repair.”
"No one does. Except for a few friends."
"Good thing nobody’s here at this hour."
too much? She offered us a cruise, Draco! That’s awesome and I’m super happy to spend a full week on a boat with you, but like you said, it’s way too much! How can we thank her?”
“I love you too.” Harry kissed him and took his member out of his hole, making him moan softly. “And that was amazing. You are amazing.”
Draco pouted. “Were you always that bossy? Or is it because I’m your boyfriend, now?”
Draco acknowledges him with a nod and a small "Morning"
“This is insane” Harry mutters
Draco’s smirk widens as he watches Potter curse under his breath. Potter opens his mouth to say something but then he blinks and blinks again.
“Good morning” a voice greets
Potter frowns. “Neither is mine and Ginny's baby but we’re still excited and looking forward for it to come”
Hermione huffs. “Well if you must know, i am seeing someone, a therapist and believe me, it helps a lot”
An awkward silence fills the room. Harry lays down on the bed and curls into a ball, pulling his knees to his chest, trying to make himself look as small as possible. "Why?" Harry whispers
“How!” Draco exclaims. “What would you do if it were the other way around!”
“Not really,” Harry says. “The baby might not end up dark like Voldemort, i believe we are different from our parents despite whether or not we look or act like them, we’re all different in our own ways,” he states. “Besides, we all have light and dark inside us, we have the ability to choose which to act on, and if i have any say in it i’ll make sure this child won’t have to choose dark” he says mostly the last part to Draco. Harry sends the stunned store helper a smile. “Anyway, help us look for a sofa bed?”
“Why? I don’t deserve your kindness, especially after everything i’ve done and what my family has done”
“Coming” Harry says sliding off the bed and sitting on the edge with another cat like stretch
Narcissa sighs. “Why don’t you go to a wizarding healer, they’re more reliable and this is my grandchild we’re talking about, i want the best for them”
Potter scoffs shaking his head, nostrils flaring. “At least tell me it will be going to a good family, that you’ve taken that into consideration”
Draco is searching for the pasta as Harry rambles on about anything and everything he can think of to fill the deafening silence which threatens to overcome. As Harry is slicing the onions, he curses through blurry eyes as the sizzling of the minced meat starts to get higher indicating it’s almost burning. He’s about to turn around when he spots Draco stirring the meat, making the sizzling die down
“What, it would be to his advantage, he would gain even more respect and power by the death eaters, thinking that they’ll have a new dark lord”
Ron frowns and rubs his arm. “What?” he then looks to Ginny who has tears forming back in her eyes
Harry blinks in surprise. “You draw? Can I see?”
Draco turns his head to the side to hide his blush. “Nothing, don’t be so full of yourself”
Potter huffs but before he could say anything, Draco slowly gets off the bed, revealing his swollen belly bump. Harry goes to help Draco but Draco shoves him away saying “I’m not a china doll, i don’t need your help”
“You never wanted to be my friend, why now”
Harry raises his hands in defense. “Hey, just saying that it’s a lot of food”
Draco is a Slytherin
When he arrives home and turns the light on, he jolts and jumps at the sight of Pansy standing in the corner. Heart pounding from the fright, he counts himself lucky that he didn’t drop the shopping. He places the shopping on the counter and begins to put the things away.
“Why? What?” Pansy trails off. “Why would you have sex with him out of all people”
Passion
“What,” she says. “It’s to help get it into your head” she knocks on his head to further prove her point.
Hermione blinks. “Just don’t be vile or a git and we’re good”
Draco tilts his head. “People are looking for me?”
“When do you plan on telling your father about the baby?” she questioned
Centre stage.
“Nice? With Malfoy? Please” Ron scoffs
“Well, you know what they say,” Draco starts. “Blood is thicker than water”
Draco smiles slightly with the shake of the head.
Narcissa frowns. “My son is not a death eater Mr Potter”
Once Draco is out of sight, Ginny glances at Harry with her eyebrows furrowed. “Why were you both in bed together--actually, why is he even here?”
“Yes it is,” The doctor smiles. “Would you like a photo?”
Harry nods. “I do”
Harry frowns. “You must eat Draco, it’s important to keep your energy up, plus you’re eating for two, it’s going to be draining if you don’t eat,” he says. “At least eat the burger and i’ll eat the rest of your chips” he tries to bargen
Flinching as a hand touches his back, Draco relaxes as he looks at Harry’s big green concerned eyes fill with determination.
“--I know!” Draco cuts him off, he then sighs, shaking his head. “I know okay”
“I’m worried about you Malfoy”
“I hope so” Draco lowers his gaze
Draco jolts and shakes his head blushing harder. “No, nothing, it’s nothing”
“You know why mother”
“Ron, Hermione, and i” Potter says
"It's understandable that you feel tired, anyone who's been through what you've been through will be tired," she states. "But your resilience and determination to keep going is strong despite all that, and that's a good thing Harry"
Comments give me life
“It was Hermione’s idea, of course”
Hermione rolls her eyes fondly. “Of course you only care about the food Ronald”
Draco raises an eyebrow at Harry as Harry sputters and chokes on his own spit. “I do NOT whine” Harry exclaims
“Why not? It’s a monster and I hate it." Draco states slapping his belly
Without another word, he goes to the bathroom, locks the door and stares at the dark stormy grey eyes in the mirror which stares back at him. ‘Why?’ he thinks to himself. ‘It’s all because of this stupid baby, i can’t do this anymore’ he bites on his hand to stop the sound of a pathetic sob escape his mouth.
“Sure P--Harry” Draco grasps his hand allowing Potter--no, Harry to help him stand up to his feet.
The next day, Draco wakes up to his stomach swirling and twisting like a washing machine again. Carefully getting off the bed so as to not upset his stomach further, Draco gets started with his day by getting ready for work. Making his way to the kitchen, his stomach rumbles like a growling monster. However, his stomach also twirls as if someone is twisting his insides.
"Yeah but it's not what you think," Harry exclaims. "He doesn't want to have Voldemort's child, he was...he was raped by him"
Harry winces. “Well, it was very unexpected and we didn’t expect you to come so early, so technically yeah we do,” he says. “But before you can say anything i don’t like this more than you do”
“What’s wrong, what’s wrong?” Draco starts. “Everything is wrong!” he exclaims. “First, I constantly have nightmares nearly every single day. And second, this fucking baby is ruining my life.” tears start to swell in his eyes once again. “I was raped by an evil man,” he finally says the dreaded word which he found so hard to say, as it would be accepting what happened. “Only to end up having his child, I feel like shit every single day and i’m constantly reminded of my past and my mistakes because of the dark mark and...and…” he trails off with a sob
Potter scratches his neck with a sheepish smile. “I basically threatened her,” he says, making Draco furrow his eyebrows. Potter sighs. “But i’m not sure if she’ll listen, i’m sorry Malfoy."
“So what if I am, what’s it to you”
“What,” Draco blinks. “Of course not,” he says. “I’m just thinking they may not be happy to have me there”
Narcissa stares at Harry. “Thank you Mr Potter”
“Yes it is, I didn't fight back, I should've fought back,” he exclaims. “I may have died but at least i wouldn’t have to deal with this now”
Draco rolls his eyes. "Of course I'm not a child, Potter"
Narcissa curses and sprints towards Draco, pulling her son's cold body out of the bath and checking his pulse. Her heart shatters as she stares at the cuts across Dracos's arm, some new, some old.
“Shut up, I’m pregnant! Okay!” Draco exclaims making everyone stare at him
“What” Draco says looking at Potter through the mirror
Draco smirks. “Well well well,” he hums. “If i didn’t know any better i’d say you’re worried and care about me”
Harry stares at Draco, a soft smile pulling at his lips, his stomach fluttering with butterflies. “Yeah”
Thanks for all the bookmarks, kudos, and comments, they made my day
Narcissa pulls Draco into another tight hug. “I love you Draco, never forget that”
Draco scoffs shaking his head, not believing any of it
“You won’t lose me”
Draco squints his eyes shut, his heart pounding against his chest. He drops to the ground and pulls his knees to his chest, breath hitching. “No no no no no,” he mumbles to himself. “No!” he slams his fists and hides his face in his arms to hide the tears streaming down his face.
“What do you mean?”
“I don’t need your pity Potter” Draco growls
Harry lifts the two brown paper bags. “Firstly, I got us both lunch,” he says. “Secondly, i think i found you a therapist”
He stares at his stomach once again which sticks out slightly. “You’re going to ruin my body,” he grumbles. “I hate you”
“Whatever helps you sleep at night” Harry sasses
“We won’t allow anything to happen to you” Harry firmly says
She stands and hugs Draco tightly. “Hello darling, how’re you doing? How is Mr Potter treating you, tell me everything” she sits once again and waits for Draco to respond
Draco scoffs.
“What, of course not”
Once Harry's pacing starts to slow, Hermione gestures for him to sit back down. As Harry sits down feeling a bit calmer, Hermione pours the tea with a sigh.
Draco drops the knife down on the counter with a sigh. “I couldn’t tell anyone,” he whispers. “I just wanted to forget that it ever happened”
“What were you guys whispering about?” Draco questions
“Where’s Draco?” he says instead of answering their question
"He did this to himself" Narcissa cries
Draco flushes. “Thanks guys. It may not be much, but you have me too”
"Thank you so much" Harry beams
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just think about it,” she stands. “Come on lunch is ready”
He clangs his mouth shut and frowns looking to the side.
Pansy nods. “At first i was a bit iffy about the muggles and muggle world, but it’s not that bad I guess, phones and TVs are amazing though”
Ron, Hermione and Draco peep their heads through the door and look between them carefully. “Is everything okay?” Hermione questions.
Draco sighs. “I’m not sure if I made the right choice to be honest”
Harry sighs. "We spoke about it before and he was worried about talking to strangers and how they might leak his information, as well as how no one will want to help a death eater which is actually true--he got kicked out of St Mungo's for Melins sake after he tried to kill himself"
“Well, always about the time when I was stuck in the fiendfyre, the smoke, everything. And then it’s about the time the dark lord...you know…”
“What if i can’t” he cries
Comments are greatly appreciated :)
“It went well, talked about Ginny and the baby, and i feel a bit better after venting everything out--oh and i also may have gotten Draco a therapist”
“--If we’re going to tolerate each other then we should at least not hide anything, if you have grudges or want to say something, then say it” Draco states
“I don’t know”
Draco flops to the floor, hiding his head in his arms and pulling his knees to his chest. “Yes”
Pansy sighs. “At least eat a fruit, it’s something light”
Comments give me life ;)
“No,” he whispers. “There’s no way”
Harry looks at Draco carefully. “Yeah i meant it, whether you like it or not, i’m going to help take care of the baby and make sure it doesn’t go dark”
“We have leaflets about pregnancy if you want to take a look” the doctor says
"Is he the same Draco Malfoy who's pregnant with he who must not be nameds child?"
He grips tightly onto the raver and places it over the top of his wrist, where his veins lay. He knows what he’s doing, he knows that this could kill him, but he doesn’t care, in fact, he wants it to. With a hiss, he digs the razer deep into his skin and slides it across his wrist. A burning sharp pain escalates through him, across his back and wrist. He gasps for air, hissing blood gushes out of him.
Once the food is done, Draco dishes up for both of them a huge amount of spaghetti bolognese. He hands it over to Harry who looks at him with wide blown eyes. “That is a lot of food” he comments
“Huh?” Pansy questions. “What does that have to do with us hanging out--wait,” she cuts herself off. “--Did something happen, what happened?!”
“I’ll be alright, I'm going to sleep, try to forget this all happened for a bit”
“I’m pregnant” he says clearer
“--We’re sure, besides it’s not safe for you to be out there alone, there are people looking for you, you know” Ron says only to furrow his eyebrows at a pointed look Hermione and Harry are sending him
“Oh,” Draco shuts his eyes. “I forgot about that for a moment”
Taking a deep breath he glances across the open cabinets and looks for the razer. Spotting it, he pulls down his sleeve and removes the bandage, revealing his scratched and cut arm. Long cuts are scattered across his wrist, the deep cuts burning against his skin as blood slowly seeps out.
“Anything”
Harry nods. "He's actually been pleasant to be around and I now consider him my friend"
He grabs the razor and holds it tightly on his other arm and drags it across his arm, wincing at the pain but cannot stop, he keeps dragging it across his skin until his vision starts to blur and his vision turns black
Walking towards the kitchen, he sits on a chair and holds his head in his hands, staring at the Hogwarts letter which glares at him.
“Who will look after it then, because i won’t”
Potter smiles slightly. “That’s better, and yes you can”
“How can you be so sure?”
Harry lifts Draco easily
“It’s harmless, we’re just going to use it to see the baby inside your stomach”
Hermione rolls her eyes. “He’s not the same guy we knew at hogwarts, he’s changed” she says
Draco sighs. “Right, let’s apparate then."
“Yeah your stomach is a bit--” Potter joins
“Whatever”
Draco paces around the room waiting for the pregnancy test to reveal the results, thoughts whirling around his mind.
Dr Jones nods. "No one deserves to be subject to unfair treatment and oppression, and from what you've told me, he's a changed person"
Pansy whirls around to spot the familiar man entering the room. Narcissa’s eyes widen at the sight of Lucius before them
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes” Draco grits out
Draco sighs. “I think about it more later” he glances at the time then races out the door and on his way to work
“I’m transgender,” Draco states not knowing where his courage is coming from. “If you have a problem with that…”
Narcissa nods. “Yes we do thank you”
Harry squeezes Ginny’s hand in comfort. “They will be” he says before sending Ginny a tight smile
“Of course”
“Skeeter is probably writing the papers as we speak,” Harry says. “I know you don’t want to think about it, and you have every right, but you must think about what you’re going to do next, you must think about your safety first and--”
Hands
As the music softly plays out to an end Draco breathes deeply and grips onto Harry tightly, Harry grips onto the android with the same amount of passion and strength
The doctor nods.
Narcissa shakes her head but doesn’t say anything.
Narcissa sighs, putting the clothes away. “I know you’re not fond of the baby--”
“--You’re fired Malfoy” his boss grits out
“I’m pregnant” Draco mumbles
Draco lifts his head up to see Potter’s nostrils flaring and jaw clenched. “Huh?”
“And she’s right!” Potter exclaims. “How dare you!” he yells, dark face becoming red with anger. “If you are going to be a wimp and can’t face up to the responsibilities of becoming a father you should have been more careful in the first place”
“I was with my mother”
Harry sends Ron a scowl at the playful gleam in his eyes, before Harry could answer Draco beats him to it. “Slept alright, apart from Potter’s snoring”
Draco’s eyes darken. “What are you doing here?” he spits
Harry looks at Draco and rolls his eyes. “What are you staring at now?” he says
“I’m not ready for a relationship Granger”
“I’m okay,” he squeezes her hands back in reassurance. “As much as i hate to admit it, i like living with Potter, they treat me nicely, besides it’s only until i go to Hogwarts”
Draco’s heart drops to his stomach at the thought of Potter being a father for some reason, but it’s probably more to do with himself becoming a father, or at least, Draco hopes. “Oh” he says, lowering his gaze before taking another sip of his hot chocolate
Leaning into the touch, Draco sighs. “I really appreciate that, thank you”
A knock at the door startles him once again. “What are you doing, if you don’t unlock the door i’m going to open it myself” Harry insists
“Tough, as your mother I refuse for you to be treated like dirt” Narcissa states pacing around the room
Draco blinks. “I don’t have a boyfriend”
“See Hermione,” Ron says with a beaming smile. “I told you they wouldn’t have anything planned and it wasn’t a waste of money”
He flops back with a sigh, stomach grumbling and growling.
Draco stares at him. “Huh?”
“It went well, i’ve got another next week”
Narcissa huffs
“Draco, this is your child, you must face the responsibilities--”
“How dare you lose us customers”
Draco walks into the sitting room with a sigh. Ron and Harry are setting up to play some chess while Hermione is getting dinner ready. He walks towards Hermione and stirs the rice and vegetables together. Hermione sends him a tight smile
He nods at the doctor while trying to take deep breaths to calm down
Why does he keep living? What is keeping him going? He has nothing except maybe his mother. But he just can’t do this
His breathing is hitched and rapid
Draco slowly nods. “So people are hunting me down to kill the baby”
Hermione and Ron look at him carefully. “How are you, Harry?”
Narcissa sighs. “Anyway, did you send your response yet about whether you’re going back to Hogwarts for the eighth year?”
Lucius glances at his son and gracefully sits on a chair. “What happened, son?” he stares at him carefully. “Why did you do what you did? How are you even pregnant with the dark lord's baby?”
Opening his eyes, he gives himself a firm hard nod, before slowly making his way to the balcony and ever so slowly giving the owl his answer. As the owl opens its wings and disappears into the cloudy sky, Draco sighs.
“I refuse to allow you to go back to Hogwarts” Narcissa slams a fist on the table
“About yourself”
“You shouldn’t care about what people think”
“Here’s my phone number if you change your mind” Potter writes his number down on a tissue before handing it over to Draco
Draco stares in horror at the sight of Rita Skeeter sitting there staring at him as if she’s about to eat him. “So,” Skeeter says leaning in, reaching for her notepad and pen. “What’s this about you being pregnant with Voldemort's child?”
Granger, Weasley and Potter stare at him with their mouths open in shock. “Wait,” Weasley holds a hand up. “You…” he starts. “You work here, as a waiter?”
Harry turns around and looks to Draco with a tiny smile. “It’s okay,” he says. “And Draco, you will be okay you know”
“What”
Draco shakes his head laughing softly. "Why? You don't care that much about me do you"
They sit in silence for a while, each not knowing what to say or do now and being to scared to question it out loud
“Right”
With a sigh, Draco allows his mother to place the gift in his hands. He fumbles and feels it, before gently peeling off the sellotape and pulling the small fabric box out. He opens it and feels it to be a pendant with the outline of two dragons on the side of a large silver M in the middle
“Draco,” she holds his shoulders to try and stop his rocking. “What’s wrong?!” she demands
Pansy smirks. “I see,” she says. “So what happened”
Draco hugs back, allowing his mother to rock him back and forward.
“I love you mother,” he sends a watery smile. “You’re the best mother someone could ask for”
“Yeah, good luck with that” Harry says
The audience is like a night sky, dark with little white spots like stars.
“Someone has to be” is merely her response.
“Oh i’m moving in with Potter and his friends since it’s not safe to stay here since Skeeter knows I live here” Draco says
After a bit of rough silence, Narcissa looks at her son carefully. “So,” she starts. “What do you plan on doing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy nods. “Well, who’s the other father?”
Draco glances back to see his boss stare at him and gesture for him to hurry up. Draco coughs to catch their attention. “So what can I get you three?”
Sorry it took me a long time to update, my life has been crazy and hectic and I've been really busy, plus my laptop is on the verge of breaking as the fan is broken so I can't use it as much as I'd like to. Thanks for sticking with me, i hope you enjoy this chapter
“But--”
He lays down and pulls his top up to reveal his stomach.
“Why do you care though” Draco questions
“No, don’t worry, just come over”
“I’ll never like, much less love, this thing” Draco slaps his stomach glaring down at the small bump sticking out
Draco bites his lip. He doesn’t want to move in with his mother as she will be overbearing and won’t leave him alone. He’s about to say something but Harry beats him to it
“Pansy, did you get a Hogwarts letter?”
“Oh,” Draco says. “And are you going to yell at me too”
Draco rolls his eyes. “If you don’t want to eat that much, then not eat it all”
Potter shakes his head. “No, hate is a strong word, besides if you hated me, you wouldn’t have spoken to me today in the cafe”
“Tell you what” Draco says cutting up the meat
“Well i don’t” he crosses his arms
Hermione helps Harry put the shopping away. "How'd you sleep Malfoy? Is the sofa bed good?" She questions
“Well i’m not Potter” Draco grumbles
“Well i didn’t find one” Harry exclaims
“That was ages ago,” Draco says. “I don’t think that anymore”
Draco sighs, bringing the car back to life before making his way back home
“Draco?” An unfamiliar voice calls out to him. “Do you know where you are?”
“...Raped you?”
Before Draco could respond, a nurse calls out for him
“You may not be seen today” the receptionist says
Narcissa pulls back. “Oh Draco,” she sighs. “Everything will work out, everything will be alright”
Harry shakes his head mutely, squinting his eyes shut.
Dr Jones smiles. "That's really good Harry"
“We can’t treat death eaters”
“I nearly lost Draco, my son, my dragon,” she feels tears swell up in her eyes. “I was too overbearing and controlling,” she says. “If Draco doesn’t trust you and doesn’t want anything to do with you, then I’m not telling you anything,” she slowly steps closer. “And you’re not going to ask Draco any more questions if you want to see the light of dawn tomorrow”
Guilt bubbles in Draco's stomach already that he's causing so much worry to those around him "I'll be okay"
“So all those long sleeves in summer…” she says realization hitting him
Ron sends Harry the best puppy eyes he could make which makes Harry chuckle. “I’m down” Harry says. Ron then looks at Draco who nods with a shrug. “Sure, i’m just intrigued to go”
“No,” he decides to be honest. “Not really, the baby wasn’t exactly planned."
Answering the phone, Draco paces around the room nodding his head frantically as his boss tells him off and telling him he can’t be late. Draco claims he’s sick, which he is technically. Luckily he has good attendance and this was the first time he was late, and his boss let him off.
Draco huffs and shoves past Harry, silently stomping out of the room
"Thanks Draco"
Harry clenches his jaw at the man before sending Draco a pointed look telling him with his eyes for him to stay quiet. Luckily Draco just lowers his gaze with a small grimace as Harry opens his mouth to respond
Ginny Weasley bursts out laughing, making the few people in the waiting room stare at them. She then calms down and looks between Draco and Narcissa. “Wait,” Weasley says. “You’re not joking?”
“I beg to differ, it’s something about me”
“Because Harry cares, and i guess you have changed and i would like us to start over”
Draco sighs. “If you say so mother”
Narcissa glares at him. “But,” she starts. “I know that this baby will love you, and that soon you’ll love it back”
Draco leans forward as if saying a secret. “Potter, i saw Potter”
Once again sorry for the really slow updates, my laptop is still broken and I'm trying on my phone lol. Hope you enjoy this chapter. Thanks for all the comments they make my day.
"At least promise me that you'll stay with me today" Harry looks up at Draco with soft eyes
Hermione blinks at him. “Wasn’t he sleeping with you” she says and then winces at how weird that would sound out of context
'Did you run away, did you away, i don't need to know'
Harry shakes his head. “No, at least not yet” he says only for Draco to cross his arms with a “Not helping Potter”. Harry sighs “I went to your flat to tell you that you can move in, and i found your mother there and she told me what happened”
“No, it’s not whatever,” Potter states. “This is an innocent baby, and you won’t be man enough to look after it, you don’t deserve it”
Draco shakes his head. “No”
“Which is true”
Harry shrugs. "I've been high and low, a lot has happened since we last spoke last week"
Harry rolls his eyes. “Whatever,” he says. “I’m going too, so is Hermione and Ron."
Draco sighs. “Then sit”
Hermione smiles. “It’s mature and understanding”
Draco sighs. “Just this stupid monster growing in my stomach”
“Oh,” Potter says “Sorry i just thought since it takes a lot of magic for a male to have a baby, i thought you had a boyfriend or something”
They sit together on the floor in a comfortable silence.
Draco races towards the bathroom before slowly shutting the door and locking it
Harry sighs. “I know you don’t want to talk about it,” he says watching as Draco winces and shuts his eyes. Harry fiddles with his hands. “But what are you going to do when everyone finds out that you’re pregnant with Voldemort's child”
The razor glares at him, mocking him
“Unfortunately”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Right, because you’re handling things so well” he sarcastically says
“What no,” the man says. “You’re in an ambulance, you fainted and you’re on your way to the hospital”
“What no,” Potter shakes his head and hands. “No of course not”
“So it wasn’t a dream” he mutters to himself.
Narcissa sighs. “But what happened...happened, we can’t change the past, all we can do is accept what happened and try to move on”
“...Is gone” Hermione finishes her sentence
The healers come rushing to her. "What happened?" one asks
Ron grumbles nonsense under his breath and looks away. "Only because Harry seems to care about you for some reason"
“It's the only job I could get that didn’t need school results, not that mine isn’t amazing,” he flicks his hair back. “But seeing potions on my list will surely get the muggles confused,” he says. “If Hogwarts doesn’t work out i do plan on doing a course of some sort, just to have muggle subjects on my list as well”
Harry lowers his gaze before looking at Draco who tilts his head. Before Harry could say anything Draco holds a hand up and says "Wait hold up," he cuts in. "You guys can do whatever you want, you don't have to change your plans or anything because of me"
He hears Pansy huff over the line. “Hello to you too Draco” she says.
Hermione sighs. “I have nightmares of the war, watching people be killed and die right in front of my eyes, and the time Bellatrix tortured me, or when i thought Harry died, i have nightmares that he’s still dead, that i’m still in the war”
Draco coughs awkwardly. “Er, no not yet”
Draco startles awake as he flinches away from a touch on his shoulder. “Please don’t do this” he exclaims, pulling his knees to his chest rocking back and forward
Draco smirks. "Aww Weasley, who knew that you love me"
'Does she know that we bleed the same'
“You’d let them think you’re pregnant for me” Draco says voice cracking
Narcissa inhales deeply, shaking her head looking up.
Draco is full-on crying, big fat streams of tears falling across his face as he stares at Harry
Draco nods forcing a small smile. “I’ll be fine”
“Fine, whatever, I'm tired, can I go to bed?” Draco asks standing up
Hermione nods. “Harry is right Malfoy”
“I will not stand for this” Potter states
Draco nods. "The sofa bed is very comfortable"
“And you’re only telling me now?” Pansy hisses
Draco's heart pounds with adrenaline.
“I also lived in a muggle flat like this Weasley” Draco responds
“Er right” he says before sitting gracefully in one of the armchairs forcing his eyes on the TV, trying to ignore the stare from Hermione
“No” he softly says
Unbearable heat
He’s been accepted for the eighth year at Hogwarts
When he sees who it is, Draco furrows his eyebrows but picks up anyway
Ginny nods. “Yeah, they will”
“I spoke to her,” Potter says. “I made sure she won’t write anything about what happened or anything we spoke about”
Harry nods. “Yeah, of course”
Carnage
Potter looks at Draco carefully. “What are we going to do about it?”
Draco nods. “I accepted, I’m going back to Hogwarts in two weeks” he suddenly starts to feel nerves flutter in his stomach
“Malfoy” Potter states
“Well if you’re sure, i’ll apparate by your house in a moment”
“With us by its side, it won’t”
“Still, just think about it”
Harry huffs and sits up. “How are you feeling today?”
“Whatever, I’ve still got my eye on you Malfoy” Ron says
Draco smiles. “I love you too mother”
Draco nods. “Yeah, i’m going back to sleep,” he then looks at Ginny. “I’m sorry about the baby Weasley”
“I’m your husband and Draco is my son, that makes it my business”
“Sorry honey, what did you say?”
They make their way to the waiting, sitting away from all the other people, Draco decides it’s a good time to talk about what he remembered in the taxi.
Draco scoffs and scans the room. Rolling his eyes, he walks towards the bookshelf and grabs the keys which lay besides the books. With a pointed look, he turns around to Harry who grumbles nonsense and snatches the keys off Draco’s hand. Draco laughs softly, his lips tugging upwards into a small smile. Harry smiles slightly at him with the roll of the eyes
“What’s this?”
“Merlin, you have no patience Weasley”
Draco lowers his gaze still not convinced
“Wait a moment,” Potter says holding a finger up. “What’re you doing in a muggle supermarket,” he questions. “Did you get lost” he teases
“What wasn’t a waste of money?” Harry questions nervously
“Why not?”
“I promise”
Silence fills the air.
'Just come home'
“Oh er, no, sorry for staring” she says
“No they don’t darling, they think I'm pregnant” Narcissa rubs a hand on Draco’s back
Sorry it literally took me forever to update, my laptop officially broke and im now writing on my phone, so updates may take a while. Sorry once again
“I’m glad you didn’t abort the baby Draco” Narcissa says
Narcissa cups his cheek. “I think you did,” she says. “It will be hard because not everyone is accepting, but going back will be worth it, I know it will”
“I don’t want anything” Draco crosses his arms
“Draco,” Potter says. “I’ll talk to them and we’ll see how things go, I can't promise that if you do live with us that it will go smoothingly, but it will only be for a few weeks before going to Hogwarts”
“Why?” Draco frowns
Hermione looks at him carefully. “Are you okay?”
“Why?” Draco questions
“Nothing,” he starts but then sighs. “It’s just Potter and Weasley lost their baby, and...i don’t know, i kind of feel bad as they were really looking forward to the baby, and i’m here with mine and i don’t want it, i just feel bad”
Ron huffs. “I don’t care about him, I care about you Harry,” Ron says. “You never answered us about how you are”
Draco sighs and plops his half eaten burger onto the plate and reluctantly eats a single chip. “Potter, as much as i appreciate you getting me lunch, i can’t finish it, i feel very sick today”
“Whatever”
Draco sighs. “I just feel bad that you lost the baby”
Draco feels his heart drop and his stomach growl, but he then shakes his head. ‘Why am I jealous’ he thinks to himself. “Congratulations” he forces out
Draco scoffs cutting her off
“I need to talk to Harry” the voice, Harry now notices, is Ginny's says
Ron stands from where he was sitting and turns to Harry. ”Mate, you still haven’t answered us, are you okay?”
Once they’ve finished eating Draco starts to wash the dishes, as Harry goes to the bedroom to get changed. When Draco finishes the dishes, he knocks on the bedroom door and opens it when Harry says “Come in”. He walks in only to flush when he sees Harry shirtless, his muscles flexing as he puts a shirt on.
With a final nod, he scrunches the paper up and throws it in the bin as he makes his way to grab his wallet and keys before walking out the door. Making his way to the nearest cafe, he sighs, keeping his hands stuffed in his pockets.
Draco moves to a stand and makes his way towards the door where Ron and Hermione are looking in with wide eyes. “We’ll leave you both to talk in private” Draco says before leaving the room and signaling Hermione and Ron to follow him before shutting the door
“Yeah”
Harry sighs. “I will talk to--”
Harry looks at Draco with gentle eyes. “So, you’re going to eighth year of Hogwarts, right?”
Draco holds his hands up and shakes them and his head rapidly. “No no mother,” he says. “You know I want nothing to do with this thing, much less buy stuff for it, besides, it makes it too real”
Harry sighs, lowering his head in shame. “I don’t know what I would do”
“It’s the dark lords”
“No,” Draco growls. “Say what you were thinking”
Draco waits outside for Pansy and once she appears, they get a taxi and make their way to the clinic. The ride in the taxi is silent, Draco suddenly remembers something but decides he can’t say it in the car in case the muggle taxi guy overhears them
Draco gulps. “Er yeah, that”
Harry smiles slightly himself. "Winston Churchill said that"
Narcissa stares at Draco. “Why didn’t you tell us?”
“That’s normal” Harry says.
“Stop this talk Draco,” she squints her eyes shut. “Please, you’re all i have, don’t talk like this”
Before Ron could respond, the door opens with Harry and Hermione walking in with shopping bags in their hands. Dropping the bags to the floor, Hermione greets Ron with a peck on his lips while Harry says "Hey guys" and smiles at Draco
He doesn’t know how much time he’s been crying in front of the mirror but a knock at the door startles him out of his thoughts. “Y-Yeah?” he barely croaks out
"Yeah" Draco lowers his gaze looking at Harrys back
“And choose your choices wisely, sometimes it’s better to just ignore,” Harry says. “Talking back will just make them angrier”
“Right” Draco nods biting his lip hard to fight off the tears swelling in his eyes, everything becoming overwhelming
Narcissa’s face turns slightly red with fury. “I’m going there right now and i’m going to give them a piece of my mind, how dare they not look over or treat my son when he needs it” she says as she’s about to apparate but Draco exclaiming “Don’t!” stops her in her tracks
Draco nods distantly and leaves the room, calling a taxi, and making his way home. Once he arrives home he flops onto his bed, thoughts whirling across his mind. ”What am i going to do” he says out loud to himself. “I need to get rid of it as soon as possible”
Draco blinks. “Who are you? What are you going to do with me?” he exclaims, sitting up much to the pain in his head
Draco falls to the ground and curls up like a ball, bringing his knees tightly to his chest and burying his face in his arms. Pansy’s heart drops at the sight of her friend's broken shaking form. She sits besides him and pulls him into a tight side-hug
“What happened? Why did Draco try to kill himself?!” Lucius exclaims voice laced with pain
“I lost the baby!” She exclaims loudly
“You didn’t even do anything to be tired” Ron says
Harry sighs. “Yeah, people are looking for you because of the baby, people are in a panic because they think the baby is going to be the next Voldemort”
Harry looks at Draco when he feels a hard stare and he notices his face is scrunched up, Harry frowns, wiping his mouth and plopping his burger on his plate. “What? Do I have something on my face?”
“Excuse me,” she says. “No i will not, Draco you’re all i have, please, don’t talk like this”
“No, it’s exactly that”
“Not even for power?” Draco narrows his eyes. “Everyone does something for power”
“Great” Draco mutters
“My mother will take care of it”
Sorry it took me forever to upload a new chapter, things have been hectic
“Woohoo!” Ron woops, pounding a fist in the air. “Malfoy,” he points to Draco. “Get dressed and ready, chop chop, hurry up”
Potter furrows his eyebrows. “No? Besides what’s the big deal”
“Okay” Draco sighs
Potter shakes his head. “You’re pathetic Malfoy, absolutely pathetic”
Draco sighs, the fire dying down. “Whatever, there’s nothing we can do now”
“Me too Ginny, me too”
“Right”
“Besides,” Draco says. “Potter still has to finish his lunch”
Narcissa shushes him with a hiss and wide eyes before glancing around. She turns her hard gaze towards Lucius. “What happened is none of your business”
“What you can’t--”
Draco smiles a watery smile. “I love you too mother”
Draco sighs and wipes his eyes before opening the stall door to reveal Potter standing there with a small tight smile. Draco goes to the sink to wash his hands, Potter following him like a dog.
Dracos lifeless body lying in a pool of blood in the bathtub
Draco narrows his eyes. “What did you get?”
“No,” Draco says firmly. “I’m not keeping the child of a monster”
Harry looks at Draco carefully. “You’ve never cared about what people thought about you before, why do you care now”
Happy New Year!!!!
“Nothing” he shakes his head and forces a smile
“It’s not like i wanted to Pansy”
Draco sends her a thankful smile that she didn’t tell them the real reason
Before Draco could respond, they’ve reached the hospital and are waiting in line to see the receptionist. Once Draco tells the receptionist his name and birthday and that he has an appointment with Dr Smith for an ultrasound, he makes his way to the waiting room with his mother in tow but he stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley sitting there
Draco shrugs. “I don’t know, i didn’t say no, i was too...scared” he lowers his head in shame
Pansy and Narcissa stare at him in shock. Narcissa looks at Draco and sees he’s not lying. How could she have not known or noticed her son was doing this, she’s supposed to be observant, how could he miss that her baby was in so much pain that he had to resort to this
“Yes, it’s a good idea. Astoria offered us a cruise starting from Marseille. Maybe we could come here before or after.”
"I’ll go take clean towels. And warm water." Harry said quickly before disappearing in the bathroom again.
They climbed the massive, white marbled stairs silently, then took a large corridor on the right. There were doors on each side, a heavy carpet on the floor, paintings on the walls and, after a turn left, a few other doors. Draco led the man to the last one and opened it, revelling a large room that let the Saviour speechless.
Draco’s eyebrows rose at the sudden and bold question. So very like Potter. "Is that what it’s all about, Potter?"
Confused, he lifted his head a little to look at the man. “What was that?”
"That’s... short."
*************
"Yes, Potter. I did. And to have an heir." The man looked at him, speechless so he sighed and explained further. "I'm a Pure-Blood, Potter. I'm sure you know that."
“Yes. Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy.”
"Luna?"
Draco rolled his eyes again. "Because
"I told you to wait for me. Why did you leave?"
The fourth time he saw Potter again was two months later. September was coming to an end, the leaves were golden and red and brown, and the last sunny days of summer were becoming more and more scarce. The moment he entered the meeting room in the Ministry and crossed the green eyes, his whole body fired up. He couldn’t focus at all, during the meeting, even if it was an important one about the budget allowed to the last renovations of Hogwarts.
He really didn’t mind kissing a man in public and was actually happy to show everyone this handsome man was all his.
“Well, you are very entertaining, Mr Potter.”
Pansy came with her new boyfriend tonight, the man she met at the bar on the first night Draco slept with Harry. The one she was drooling over when he left. He was a nice bloke, smart, fun, and thought Pansy was the most amazing girl in the world. That enough made him perfect for her.
“Astoria and I were planning to go for Christmas, but with everything going on, I don’t really know. I don’t want to go without her, but I don’t want to make Mother wait too long either. Scorpius is her grandson after all.”
“Do you want to do me some day?” Harry asked and added another finger. “Fuck! You’re tight!”
Potter just nodded, then pressed the button to Level Two: Department of Magical Law Enforcement. "Why the hurry? Is everything okay at home?"
“See? And when he’s older, you’ll be able to play with him.”
He frowned. "Is that all?"
"Do you want another drink, Potter?"
"Here is the bag. Do I need to put anything else in it?"
“I guess I should thank you for loving my son and grandson, then. But I should also warn you. If you ever hurt them, you will learn what a mother can do to protect her family.”
“Trust me, Mrs Malfoy. I know perfectly well what a mother’s capable of.”
“Merlin... I’m going to cum, Draco.”
When Draco told her he wanted to go see his mother in France, she suggested he ask Harry to go with him. To enjoy this time together with Scorpius. And he did. And Harry said yes. So, here they were, on Christmas Day, waiting for an early flight to Nice to be in time for lunch with his mother.
It took Pansy a mere two minutes to detect desire in his eyes and two more to spot the reason of it.
"So," he moved his kisses lower, on Draco's chest and belly. "you were more jealous of the fact we could be openly gay, right?"
“Yes. He is cute. Much much!”
She remained silent a bit then nodded, still looking at the sleeping baby. “Yes, I know.”
“Are you enjoying yourself?”
He loved those moments after sex. It was so easy, so comfortable. But it could never last long and Draco knew he would have to let go of the dark-haired man soon. Even if he longed to share that kind of moment again, even if it was the best sex he had in years. Or ever. Even if his heart ached to let go.
"I always did. Why? Did you feel less manly because of me, before?" There was slight concern in his voice.
Harry hardened immediately in his palm and moaned. “Okay. Ride me. I want to see you fuck yourself on my cock.”
Because if Potter wanted him to wait, it clearly was not to have fun, right? He certainly wanted to ask him about his perfect dysfunctional life again. He wanted to understand what looked like a mystery to him and was Draco's only possibility to have a family of his own. He wanted to see how fucked up Draco's life was, even if he tried to show the opposite. Yes, Potter wanted to "talk" about things he couldn't comprehend. Nothing more.
“I’m so sorry, Tory. I know you wanted more than one child.”
At least, he was back to
"Ginny and Luna wanted a baby so badly that, when they asked for my help, I said yes right away." He said with a shrug.
Draco closed his eyes and let the words run through his veins. “Thank you, Harry. It means a lot to me.”
“The bathroom. It’s next to the bedroom, so we can hear Scorpius if he wakes up. I just want to blow you so you won’t be all excited when we go out for dinner.”
Merlin, why was he so bloody gorgeous? "Potter."
“You say that now, but things change.”
"I see. So what? Once the baby's born, you'll just divorce?"
“Yeah. It’s amazing! Way less frightening than in my memories. We don’t fly that high on a-” He stopped talking, looked around them and whispered, “on a broom.”
"I was just curious, I guess. It’s a bit… unusual."
“You’re not, and they know that. They’ve known about our arrangement since the beginning and they accepted it. I don’t see why they would change their mind now.”
“I know. I won’t have any children anymore. He told me before leaving.”
need to."
"Oh, I forgot! I'll have to move a meeting or two, but I’ll make it work."
“Good. Now that’s settled, can we talk about Astoria’s gift?”
"Damn, you're good at it!"
"Nah. She’s ready to pop, but not yet." The man glanced at his friends over Draco’s shoulder and smiled. The sight was somewhat... breath-taking and the blond man gulped. Where were his glasses? He couldn’t remember if he had them on his nose when he entered the bar. Without them, the green of his eyes seemed more vibrant. Fascinating. "Today’s my birthday." Potter said and Draco almost jumped, startled.
“Good. Can you help me, Draco?”
Draco sighed. It wasn’t a good idea to tell Potter now that he could not be anything more than a one-time fuck for now. But after all, maybe that’s actually what the man was searching for.
"Couldn't you bring a koala back like everyone else?"
"Hum, I think Gin's due date is around the beginning of August. So, a bit sooner than yours."
"He... he doesn’t care." Astoria sobbed and her pretty face twisted in pain. "Ah!"
“I... No. I guess but... you never said it out loud.”
“Thank you, Aunt Andy. He sure is cute.”
He didn't say another word and grabbed Draco's blond hair, pulled his face down and kissed him. Hard. Finally! Draco didn't notice how badly he wanted that, until his lips were on Potter's. It felt so good! Potter's lips were soft and plump against his, and tasted like whisky and cinnamon. The man was a damn good kisser! He licked Draco's lips, nibbled on them, bit them and, when Draco opened his mouth to moan, he shoved his tongue inside, exploring every inch of it.
“A bit better, it seems. The doctors are hopeful, even if they think it will be a long recovery. I still hope she’ll be able to spend Christmas home with us.”
Harry looked the same. Draco did not feel the same.
Feeling a bit dumb, Harry stuck out his hand. His broom zipped straight to his hand. Across the grass, Malfoy’s broom did the same. Next to him, Ron repeated a bit louder, only for his broom to turn over sharply on the ground. Neville’s didn’t even move.
“HARRY POTTER!”
“Are you going home for Christmas?” Harry asked after a moment of silence.
Then Granger spoke again, "Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me."
More whispers. Then,
“Pass her up,” George said, “We’ll let her out and she can follow us home.”
“You’re really asking me why we aren’t friends? When you’re blackmailing me just to ask the question?” Harry asked.
Draco stared at her. He’d done his best to be neutral. Being brave and reckless were not coveted traits in Slytherin or the Malfoy family. He had planned not to tell his parents that he’d wanted to befriend Potter, and he had certainly not planned to let them know that friendship was assumedly still on the table. His father had not asked about Harry himself and Draco hadn’t thought his mother would either. He’s wasn't certain what answer was the right one, and which would tell her what she wants to hear. He didn't know what she was looking for.
Hedwig let out a screech.
“Mum, you never said you knew Harry as a baby!” Fred said, sounding accusatory.
It was more food than he’d seen in his life and looked a lot better than the sort of foods that Aunt Petunia usually set in front of him. He loaded his plate with chicken, potatoes, and sausages. There was also an odd little bottle labelled pumpkin juice that he took a cautious sip of, though it tasted more like it should be a flavor of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavoured Beans.
Malfoy set you up. He was never going to meet you, he must have tipped Filch off-”
"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and forty-seven points; in third, Slytherin, with three hundred and eighty-seven; Hufflepuff has four hundred and twenty-six and Ravenclaw, four hundred and forty-seven."
He jerked awake suddenly to Hedwig flapping her wings frantically in her cage.
Hermione was no better. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.
“I said my father wouldn’t be happy if he heard I was friends with a blood traitor and a muggleborn. I’m not even sure he’d be happy if I were friends with you.” Malfoy explained.
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
“I probably shouldn’t go. Percy’s been a lot more strict since there’s so few left. Two of those being Fred and George. Let me know what you find though. Now, come on. Let’s go outside. We can borrow Fred and George’s brooms and take turns.” Ron said.
“What?” Harry asked.
“Give it here,” Harry said sharply. Malfoy looked at him, his mouth curling into a smirk.
“Yes.” Malfoy said immediately.
“Don’t even get me started on the journaling,” Draco warned.
“Go ahead, Potter,” McGonagall finally said, finally shaking herself from her reverie, “Take a seat.”
Malfoy huffed and slammed his book closed.
“They always have the new models, and you’ve beaten them before,” Lee Jordan said bracingly.
Draco jumped, whirling around to look at Blaise who look both exhausted and exasperated.
“Is that a new broomstick?” He asked calmly, “I’m trying out for the team too. You needn’t have bothered. My father is buying-“ He was interrupted.
“Of course, he has. I’ll be his second. Who’s yours?” Weasley said.
"Merry Christmas!"
Draco didn’t wait to be told twice. He set his cup back on the tray and goes. His mother is a lot gentler than his father, but she’s also a lot better at hiding her feelings. Draco has rarely been able to read her, but it seems like she can see through him like glass.
“Write me,” Pansy said, giving him a kiss on the cheek. Blaise clapped him on the back. Crabbe and Goyle waved as they left the compartment.
True to his word, Malfoy again stopped tormenting them, though it was more like he started ignoring them what with how distracted he became with studying for exams. He’d snap whenever anyone so much as closed their trunk too loudly in their dormitory and forced anyone who happened by to quiz him in every subject.
It turned and saw Harry. It lumbered stupidly at him, dragging its club as he went.
Harry mounted his own broom, but Hermione Granger, who Harry hadn’t personally said a word to since the train, rushed up to him and grabbed his sleeve.
“Look, it’s that stupid thing Longbottom opened at breakfast. I think I’ll put it somewhere for him to find- up a tree?” Malfoy said gleefully.
“We could talk about the dragon. Or where in Merlin’s name you found an invisibility cloak.”
“I should properly thank you. For saving me with the club. I really thought I was a goner there for a minute.”
“We’re taking you back home with us. Have you got all your stuff packed?” He asked.
“Quiet, now,” Madam Hooch called briskly, taking her place at the head of the two lines, “Does everyone have a broom? Put your hand out over your broom and say, ‘up’.”
“Erm, hello.” Ron said mildly when Harry stopped uncertainly next to him.
"It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm sure it is – Can I see it?”
As soon as he made it to his own dorm, he yanked Malfoy’s hangings aside. Malfoy, dressed in silk pajamas and with hair free of his usual product, jerked awake with a frightened noise, clutching his blanket close to his chest.
His father’s eyes were glinting dangerously, something like relief when Arthur Weasley finally got fed up with his needling and their fight distracted everyone.
"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley..."
Harry had no clue what to say. McGonagall’s eyes suddenly softened.
“Look, the new Nimbus 2001!” Ron grabbed Harry’s arm.
“Have you even heard of a Wizard’s duel?” Draco scoffed.
“Well,” Harry said, “I guess you have a choice to make.”
It was a dumb question. Everyone in Slytherin knew he’d be staying.
“It was cloudy, mum, and we used the booster,” Fred said.
He was starting to doze off. He hadn’t been sleeping all that well lately. He’d been having this weird recurring dream about a zoo…
But he had thought it might be different this year. When he’d gotten into Uncle Vernon’s chevette at the end of term, he’d thought the summer would at least be easier to deal with because Ron and Hermione had both promised to write him over the summer. Ron had even mentioned something about them coming to stay at his house.
Neville collapsed into a fluffy armchair by a roaring fire. He was white, covered in sweat, and clutching at his chest. Ron spoke first.
Still, the castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. Ron was as great a friend as Harry could imagine and he found that ignoring the Slytherins was almost easy when he was there. He’d never had friends before.
“What are you
“Malfoy, it’s very important. It’s a matter of life and death,” Harry said.
Draco watched them leave together and then followed Snape out. He could only hope he could convince Snape not to write home about this incident, or he wasn’t so sure he’d enjoy going home for Christmas this year.
“Er, yeah. Can you tell me the difference between the 2000 and the 2001?” Harry asked.
"So," Potter started after a cough. "You're expecting, then?"
“Hey.” He whispered and sat at the edge of the bed. “Yes. This is Scorpius. He was eager to meet you but fell asleep while waiting.
"Yeah. You?"
“Mother, Father! You made it! How is Tory?” Daphne walked to them, her one-year-old son, Oliver in her arms.
The two men stood up and went back the guest house where Scorpius was already sleeping for about an hour now. They both undressed and lied under the sheets. It’s been a long day and Draco could already feel his eyes close. He moved closer to Harry and buried himself in his arms.
***********
"...Yes. But just tonight, okay? It’s... it doesn’t mean anything."
"So, tell me. How was it? I want to know every little details."
"Okay. I think I'm ready. Can you fuck me, now?"
-THE END-
“I know, but...”
Draco took the envelope and opened it. Inside, was a piece of paper showing a reservation.
"I’m sure he will. Sweet like his mother and smart like his father."
"I know, baby. I’m right here. It’ll be over soon, I promise you. Do you still need to push?"
"Stay like that."
The man did as told and moved back, pulling his aching member out of the blond man. Draco quickly got up, searched for his pants and put them on, a look of slight terror on his face.
*********
"Not about the baby. I know you already love him so much and that you’re more than happy to become a father. I mean... in general. This marriage, the vows we took... I never noticed before, but today I can see that you’re hurting. Because you can’t be with him."
asked. If I didn’t, you probably would have started by that. Or we would still be mute like two idiots."
Having a new-born was really time-consuming. Even with the help of the House Elves. He had to feed him every two to three hours, change his diaper nearly as often, lull him to sleep. Add all the cuddles time, and Draco didn’t have any time left for anything else. But he wasn’t alone to cope with all that.
The blonde man nodded and Harry took his fingers out. He stepped down from the bed and undressed himself under the hungry grey eyes.
"They’re both doing great. Ginny’s been wonderful and she and Luna are delighted. Little Pandora is... She’s adorable!"
“He is perfect, Tory. Absolutely perfect. And healthy. I will go St Mungo’s in the morning to see Dr Piren, but Dr Gobler thinks he’s fine.”
“You’re the only man that can make sex sound as romantic.”
“I thought you would be more at ease in the guest house. I had Merry prepare it. This way, Scorpius can have his own room and you too.” She stopped on her tracks and looked at them. “Hum, I supposed you two would share a room, but...”
"Polite? Like always."
“Hello my Darling. How was your flight?” Narcissa Malfoy took her son in her arms and embraced him closely. He wasn’t used to that from his mother, but since his father’s death, things had changed.
After a two-hour flight and a one-hour drive, they finally arrived in Saint-Raphael and parked in front of Malfoy’s house. It was a pretty villa with white walls and ochre tiles on the roof in a calm neighbourhood. Draco couldn’t really remember the first time he came here, he felt like he did all his life, but knew he always loved it. So, when his mother chose to live here after the war, he was relieved. He knew she would find some kind of peace and happiness there.
“Yeah.” Draco took Harry’s member between his fingers. “Fuck me, Harry.”
“Well... He’s always had a hero complex.”
“Oui. Il est déjà installé dans la chambre. N’hésitez pas à appeler le service d’étage si vous souhaitez changer la disposition.”
The future could wait. His present was perfect.
"That's good with me. I'm okay with both, but I can't really picture myself on top of you. Only If it's because I'm riding you."
"No. Move."
"Don't say that, it makes me jealous."
“What for? Meeting my mother again?”
"Tory?"
“Hurting a bit. And I’m exhausted. Can you take him?”
"I was more pissed off than jealous. The way you kissed was vulgar. He seems like a vulgar guy."
What he did tonight… Drooling over Potter, talking to him about his private life, waiting for him… Merlin, he was clearly stupid! But he knew
Draco chuckled. “If you want to.”
romantic, Potter.”
The smile on the man’s face was nearly enough to make him cry in relief.
"I had the time and the money to renovate and change Sirius' house too, but I didn't. Too many memories, I guess."
“Come and sit with me, boys. We can have the aperitif here.”
“That went well.” Harry mumbled, lying on his back, head on his folded arms. Draco was in a similar position, only he was on his belly.
“You’re right. I love you. Merlin, I’m going to ride a damn plane for you. On Christmas Day! If that isn’t love...” Draco chuckled and searched for a bib and sneaked it under his son’s chin. “And I won’t leave you. I don’t know how I could make you understand what I feel for you. For both of you. It’s surreal! That’s why I’m so afraid of taking this plane. Of losing you. So, no. I won’t leave. You’ll have to deal with me until your death, or until you get rid of me. Because I’m not going to be the one leaving. I promise you.”
“I actually thought it would suit you better. I saw the tapestry and thought you looked a lot like your grand-mother.”
“I would love that. Are we together now?”
Just once, Draco. You need to sleep, you’re exhausted.”
“No, I...”
"I know. I made some changes when I became Lord Malfoy."
The former Gryffindor remained silent for a while. "Sorry, I still don't get why you had to marry for that. I mean, you could have done like Ginny and Luna and ask a friend or have a baby with a surrogate mother or something. No need to marry."
have control on. Not in a big flying piece of metal ready to explode anytime.”
He nodded. "You can go use the Floo." He showed the fireplace behind the couches.
**********
"I forgot a file in my office. Need to work on it for Monday."
“You say it now, but... what if-”
“Maybe because her family’s going to be here. I don’t want them to think I’m overstepping and taking her place.”
"The contractions seem close. Don’t you think?" Draco asked the dark-haired man, his eyes full of worries.
Then, the man walked to him again and took him in his arm, sticking their foreheads together. "Call me Harry."
"Oh. Yeah, forgot yours was in July." Draco lifted his glass, looking at Potter. "Happy birthday, then."
“How is she?” It was Harry that talked as Draco was way too lost to think about anything else than his son.
“I guess so.”
“Mr Malfoy?” She whispered and Draco made a step forward. “Please, meet your son.”
They quickly arrived at his office and Potter opened the door.
“It is. Mother chose well.” He looked carelessly at the dark-haired man until something caught his eye. “Harry... is that a hard-on in your pants?”
The way he moaned his name made Draco go crazy. He pushed the man against his desk and pulled at his shirt, breathless.
"What? What do you mean?"
Potter looked sad, but nodded and kissed him. "Alright. I missed you, you know? But I try to be patient."
"No problem. Have a good night, guys!"
“How is she?”
It felt heaven. Potter’s body on him, his tongue inside his mouth, one hand on his thigh and the other on his throat. And his hard member deep inside him, quickly moving in and out, spreading and brushing Draco’s walls. It wasn’t long until he felt his balls contracting, ready to burst. Draco’s hands grabbed Potter’s ass and pushed it even more against him, in him. Then, after a few more thrusts, he lost it. He let go of Potter’s mouth and threw his head back in the pillows, screaming as he came hard all over both of their bellies. A few seconds later, the man above him followed and released his cum inside of him with a grunt, his face hidden in the crook of his neck, teeth planted in the flesh.
The right thing was to say no, he was aware of that. But, instead, he just nodded. He was a weak man for those eyes.
Draco looked at her face and laughed. He knew she wasn’t serious; it was a joke between them. Of course, it would never happen. They both loved this little bundle of joy way too much to harm him in anyway.
As she stood up from her seat and began reaching for her coat, Draco frowned and shot up after her in protest.
"Happy Christmas, Draco."
with blind rage.
Draco knew what they were looking for, but he'd be damned if he let them see it.
A few minutes later, when they finally managed to pull away from each other, Draco shook his head to himself and let out a breathless laugh. As Aria slid her hands up his chest and linked them around his neck, Draco closed his eyes and bent down, pressing his forehead against hers.
"Alright, alright! Enough about that for now!" Draco snapped at them, drawing everyone's attention back to him. "Look, those damn Lions have obviously got the advantage on us right now. Their beaters are using all of their energy to keep me from even touching the damn quaffle so I say, let's up the ante a little bit. If you know what I mean."
Her vision blurred with tears of pain and she stumbled to her knees, gasping as the spell ended nearly halfway down her wing before Bentley yanked his wand back up. She winced, feeling dizzy as she felt blood gushing out from below her shoulder and pooling into a small puddle on the marbled floor beneath her skirt. Bentley's eyes widened, gleaming red with hunger as he dipped his finger into the pool of blood and brought it up to his mouth, licking some of her blood off the tip. Then, with a smile, he raised his wand up into the air again and Aria stifled another scream, crawling backwards by her elbows along the blood-stained floor in a feeble attempt to move away from him.
Astoria smiled at that and waved at him before she turned and began walking back towards the exit of the library.
"I said just shut the fuck up and leave me alone, you damn half-breed
Nodding, she reached out, clasping his hand in her small, gloved one and giving his fingers a firm squeeze.
She reached a hand out to him again, waiting patiently until Draco lifted his weary gaze and met her eyes. They stared at each other for a long time, and Aria was taken back when she saw the broken, terrified look on his face.
"Seriously?" Blaise snorted at her, giving her a smug, knowing look. "
She obviously didn't notice him as she bent down, digging through a drawer of her undergarments, and Draco was unsure of what exactly he was supposed to do so he continued to watch her with an awkward grimace on his face. From where he stood, he could see that some parts of her skin were still a little wet and Draco was unable to prevent himself from staring as a tiny droplet of water on Aria's cheek rolled all the way down the seductive curve of her neck.
Draco broke himself out of his thoughts and looked up, frowning in confusion when he saw Ron Weasley standing across the table in front of him. He blinked and stared awkwardly up at him for a couple of seconds before Weasley let out an exasperated sigh and gestured impatiently for him to stand.
"Weren't you listening? She told you to let go of her hand." He snapped.
thing." Aria surprised everyone when she interrupted Blaise's attempts to calm the other two Slytherins down, causing all of her housemates to glance at her and Neville to glare at her with a slight hint of betrayal on his face.
Aria cast another worried look at Draco from the corner of her eye, biting her lip when she realized that the blond had finally stopped blushing and was now glaring accusingly at her and Blaise with a knowing scowl on his face.
Ron made a face at that and he arched an eyebrow in disbelief.
"I was just curious." Blaise looked amused at her reaction as he leaned back against his seat, folding his arms across his chest. "I mean, the girl's always been fairly pretty but something about her now seems almost
Instead, he busied himself with inspecting the rest of the pub's surroundings. Fortunately, apart from the bartender, the woman beside him, and a large, bulky customer sitting in a booth on the other side of the pub, there were no other customers there that evening.
want you." He parted his lips and leaned in closer,
"I'll be there to keep an eye on you the whole time so I promise you won't get hurt. And if it bothers you that much, I'll tell your sister about it." Aria reassured him with a firm shake of her head.
Suddenly, he was all too aware of how closely their warm bodies were pressed together.
, Aria. It's always been you. And frankly, it doesn't matter to me if you don't ever want a mate, because all I want is to be with you." He leaned in and pressed their foreheads together, causing her to shiver at the small amount of skin to skin contact.
"Why?"
"Y—yes?"
"Draco, it was an accident—"
"You think I don't know that?!" Draco hissed back angrily, shrugging the other boy's hand off his shoulder.
"Potter, I've been at the receiving end of those little glares from my mother for
It wasn't that he hated the girl.
Before Draco could ask him anything else, Blaise's face disappeared from the fireplace with a soft 'pop'. Draco cursed irritably under his breath as he glared at the flames before he turned his confused expression to Aria.
with the ridiculously large frames practically covering half of her face.
Everyone turned to watch as the wedding entourage finally made their entrance into the reception area.
" Aria rolled her eyes again and tried to give him a comforting pat on the shoulder. "For all intents and purposes, the Yule Ball is nothing more than an evening of eating dinner together in our formal wear. You don't have to be so nervous about it." She told him.
Not surprisingly, Bentley looked as though he wanted to move towards Aria again but he stopped when they heard another loud, familiar voice call out to them from behind.
She licked his lips once before pulling away, leaving Draco completely hot and flustered.
you."
"I see."
"You already threatened me to keep your secret, Potter. And I will. I won't tell
" Blaise chuckled and used his wand to float a set of newly dried goblets to the counter behind him. "I think Draco's mother hasn't really signed off on the engagement yet. And besides, Draco's been busy all summer trying to contact this supposed 'dream girl' of his." He added distractedly.
At the thought of Ginny, Aria couldn't help but feel a slight twinge of guilt.
plan for us this year other than to keep our heads low."
"Hate you?" Ron scoffed at her words and shook his head. "You saved his life
"By the way, if you don't mind my asking, is Blaise seeing anyone right now? And would you happen to know if he likes me? Romantically, I mean."
The horrified and somewhat
"You heard me, Parkinson." Neville's lips twitched as he rolled his eyes and gave her another pointed look. "You know, for a Slytherin, you're surprisingly ignorant. I've been trying to give you all sorts of signals for
The disgust he heard in Pansy's voice broke Draco out of his thoughts as he flinched and immediately turned away so she wouldn't see the pink splotches on his face.
"You can't seriously be thinking of—"
"B—but—"
"My younger brother…When he was born, he was diagnosed with this genetic heart condition. The condition runs in our family. It meant that if he overexerted herself or if he became too stressed or emotionally compromised, he might…he could—" Pansy's voice broke so she swallowed carefully, taking a deep breath before she continued.
Aria wasn't sure how long they sat there in that empty classroom, both of them cautiously avoiding the other's gaze before Pansy finally cleared her throat and began to speak in a soft, barely audible whisper.
“Brilliant,” Harry said, shaking himself. He was supposed to be catching up on his summer work, not thinking about how good Ron had it. Ron was disadvantaged himself in many ways, and Harry had no reason to blame him for his own terrible family.
“Yeah, for a bit. It’s alright, though. If I was still in the cupboard, you wouldn’t have been able to bust me out,” Harry grinned.
“You want to talk about this now?” Harry asked incredulously.
When Harry woke up on Christmas morning, it was to a pile of presents on his bed. On the top was a letter.
And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
Harry quickly hid the cloak behind his back, breathing out a sigh of relief that Malfoy hadn’t seen it.
“Ron,” He said, trying to keep quiet, “Ron, what-“
“It’s brilliant,” Harry said honestly.
A blue Ford Anglia was hovering several feet above Aunt Petunia’s flower bushes. One of Harry’s best friends was leaning out the window with two of his brothers in the front seat. Fred and George grinned at him. Ron was frowning.
“Get out of the way,” Ron said, who Harry guessed was quite done with the night at that point. He swung at Peeves who exploded with noise.
"Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes...
"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. Severus, I think five points each would be a fair reward, don’t you?”
Hi, I've been working on this idea for over a year now and I'm excited to finally get around to start posting. The idea is to go through the whole series, but I am bad about having long periods of time between updates. I've worked through a lot of this already so we'll seeeeee. Just in case, you've been warned.
“Because he’s an old codger. I just talked to Harry that night, alright? I knew he was going, but I didn’t help or anything.”
Harry sighed, wondering what his next move should be. He could stay here and be glared at by his housemates or he could go upstairs where Malfoy had just stormed off to.
“No,” Harry said quickly, “No, Hagrid asked around and made an album for me. Most are from their wedding but there’s a few of me when I was just born. Thank you. For that and for letting me stay.”
Harry did not realize what meeting in Diagon Alley would entail.
“Well, that’s to be expected. You can’t judge a character from books written by men who’d never met him,” She said, “I’m sure that no one expected him to be Slytherin either.”
Ron ran to look in Malfoy’s mirror, twisting and turning to see himself from every angle, even though you could only see his head.
“I’m sure all of Slytherin will have one like it,” Fred said, mournfully tracing the bristles.
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath.
“Besides, it shouldn’t be hard to be nice if you want to be our friend. We saved each other’s life with the troll and you followed me there anyway. That says something.” Harry pointed out.
“How do you know about the cloak?” He demanded.
“Did any of you even look at what it was standing on?” She snapped.
She offered him her hand.
"The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in."
He didn’t know what to do. Should he tell someone? He couldn’t see Ron anymore, the last of the Gryffindors in the Hall seemed to be seventh years.
“Right,” Harry said, tucking the card into his bag, “Well. I don’t know if Ron has Merlin yet or not.”
His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. He found that he was not as behind as the rest of the year as he would have thought. The only classes that he really struggled with were potions and history of magic, which he attributed more to the professors than his own lack of abilities.
“Isn’t it obvious?” Blaise said when Draco didn’t answer, “He’s nervous about what his parents will say about his involvement with the stone.”
It was one he recognized, from the album Hagrid had given him at the end of term. It was a picture of James, hair as messy as Harry’s on any given day, holding a bundle of blankets that was Harry. Baby Harry waved his tiny fists, while James grinned and looked above the camera, presumably at Lily. Ron was peering over his shoulder, so Harry passed it to him.
He caught something in the corner of his eye and when he pushed on his glasses, he peered out of his window.
“I’m the only Slytherins here. At least, I haven’t seen any others.
“Potter, I certainly wish you had been sorted into Gryffindor,” McGonagall finally said.
“I want to know why you think you’re too good for my friendship,” Malfoy said stiffly, “Twice, you’ve turned me down now. I usually don’t offer a second time.”
“You have those, I’ll get my own,” He said, flexing his fingers. Lockhart had a surprisingly strong grip.
“But you can tell Weasel and Granger?” Malfoy demanded.
Draco knew his father was anxious. Malfoys were great at keeping themselves contained in public, but Draco had watched his father enough to know it for himself.
Harry would have groaned aloud if he thought it wouldn’t draw any more negative attention. He hadn’t thought about that yet, but McGonagall had said so, hadn’t she? He’d spend all of his time with the Slytherins, dormitory and classes and all.
“Bragging about how you’re the next teacher’s pet, Potter?” Malfoy called, against his (well, Blaise’s) better judgement.
Harry glanced at his face to see if he was being serious but it was carefully blank.
“No, no, it wasn’t me-“ Harry started, but Ron waved at him to shut up.
Harry, Weasley, and Granger were huddled around the wooden table in the hut. Hagrid was moving something from the fireplace to the table, using two great tongs. Even through the dirty window, Draco recognized it immediately. Hagrid had a dragon egg, and it had started to hatch.
“Deal.” “Harry grinned.
“No, that’s true. Everyone at school was certainly surprised. He didn’t know anything about, well, anything.” Draco said.
Desert ended with the best treacle tart Harry had ever had (Mrs. Figg had made some once and ended up having to take one of her many cats to the vet) and soon they were following their prefect down to the dungeon to get ready for their first day of classes tomorrow.
“You’re going to get us in trouble,” Harry whispered, smoothing the feathers on her wing with his finger, “It would only get worse, you know.”
Harry sat there miserably as the sorting went on until Ron was called to the stool. He turned back to watch, feeling ridiculously hopeful that his new friend might join him. But the hat had barely touched Ron’s fiery hair before it shouted, “Gryffindor!” Harry watched glumly as Ron jogged to join his brothers at the cheering scarlet table.
“Alohomora!”
“Ron and Hermione are my friends. And they treat me like it.”
Hermione put Hagrid's flute to her lips and blew. She played a simple melody, some song that Harry vaguely recognized from the telly. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
Harry didn’t know much about brooms and there seemed to be dozens of types in the store. It was packed full with students so Ron had to shout in Harry’s ear to tell him about each broom. Hermione lingered behind them as Harry and Ron talked animatedly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was surprised to learn that he fit in at the Burrow rather quickly. Sharing Ron’s room was fine, the two spent almost all of their time together anyway and anything was preferable to being back with the Dursleys.
Hermione shoved past him and Harry, grabbing Harry’s wand which had still been clenched in his sweaty hand.
He opened his last present. Something fluid and silvery gray slithered to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.
“Yeah, course. We’ll show Fred and George when we get back,” Harry said.
He worked a bit on an essay before he got bored and pulled out a copy of a quidditch book from the library. Around ten, the other boys came up and Harry waited until he heard Goyle’s snoring before he grabbed the cloak and headed up to the common room. Malfoy was alone, studying.
Harry turned back to Ron, “Look, we got along on the train, right? Before either of us were sorted. I know there’s the weird thing between out houses, but as far as I’m concerned, I still want to be friends.”
"It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron.
The teachers had gone through the door behind the staff table, presumably to deal with the troll. No one had thought about the students not in the Great Hall. Harry couldn’t do anything about the others, but there was one he knew for sure could be in danger. Could he live with himself if he didn’t at least let her know?
“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with the twins. “What are you doing? It’s too crowded in here, let’s go outside.”
He and the rest of the Slytherins had already arrived. The others had picked over the brooms, looking for the straightest and calmest brooms while Harry picked a random broom as far from Malfoy as he could.
Harry and Hermione exchanged looks. Hermione rolled her eyes, Harry fished out his galleons.
There was another loud crash and then Professors Snape, McGonagall, and Quirrell had burst into the room. Of course they had to have heard the fight from below. Quirrell took one look at the and then sat hard on the last remaining toilet.
"I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them."
“Go!” Hermione cried, shoving Harry’s shoulder.
“It’s complicated. I had to tell them and then we all got locked out of the tower.” Ron said and looked around the corner into the trophy room.
“Yes! Oh man, imagine the look on Malfoy’s face when you show up with a Nimbus 2001!” Ron whooped.
“What are you two arguing about, now?” Harry asked, watching Granger stop oddly as she had almost continued following Ron. Seeing Harry watching her, she turned on her heel and stood by Neville Longbottom, her face pinking slightly.
Mrs. Weasley was already in line, standing with Ginny, Percy, and Mr. Weasley. She ushered the others closer. Fred and George appeared a minute later, looking as disgruntled as Ron.
“I have to go or we’ll miss our chance. Please, just trust me, and if anyone comes around, cover for me? They’ll trust you. They think we hate each other.” Harry said, sweeping the cloak over his shoulders.
Breakfast was delicious as always, but the twins swore that Christmas dinner was the best part. Harry dragged Ron back to the dungeons before they could insist on going outside.
“Here. Weasley must have Dumbledore already but if you want to start your own collection,” Malfoy tossed his card on top of Harry’s paper, “He probably already has Merlin too, he really is a famous- Potter?”
They ended up somewhere on the third floor that Harry vaguely recognized. Harry bent over to catch his breath. Neville sank to the floor, wheezing. Predictably, it wasn’t long before Hermione broke the silence.
"That wasn’t my fault,” Hermione gasped, “You
“Here’s Hermione’s latest letter,” Ron said, from where he was perched on his own bed, “She’s worried, but I already sent a reply telling her about our plan to rescue you.”
Ron passed Hedwig up to the front seat and a moment later, she was out of sight. Harry figured she was probably on her way to hunt. George pushed the bars from Harry’s window out of the window before rolling it up.
(See the end of the chapter for
They wasted no time in piling into the room, Harry slamming the door closed behind them. Harry pressed his ear to the door, Ron and Hermione on either side. It took a minute to calm their breathing down enough to hear anything.
Malfoy turned to look at him.
Harry craned his head to see Ron across the hall. Ron’s face had gone very red. His brothers were clapping him on the back, Fred and George whooping loudly.
“Yes, what do you know about him?”
The last bit rang in Harry’s eats so loudly that he knew the whole hall had heard it. His heart sank and he moved out from under the hat even before McGonagall had lifted it, though maybe that had something to do with the way she was gaping at him. She wasn’t alone. The entire hall was silent. Harry took an uncertain step towards the table Malfoy had gone to. The table still hadn’t started cheering.
"Miss Granger!"
“What happens if our dormitory is in the dungeons?” Pansy asked, shrilly, as chaos fell over the Great Hall. Everyone started pushing toward the doors as the prefects called for order. Harry could hear Percy Weasley yelling from across the hall.
“But is he ambitious? Cunning? What part of him belongs in Slytherin?” She pressed.
They landed. Harry didn’t have much time to be nervous. He’d seen Mrs. Weasley briefly on the platform both before and after his first year, but they hadn’t had much time to talk. All the Weasley’s had been Gryffindors. Ron, Fred, and George had all come around, but would the rest of the family feel the same?
“Um, yeah, thanks.” He took the offered frog and opened it, “Oh, I got Merlin. Do you collect the cards?”
His mother just looked at him for a moment, Draco didn't know what she was thinking, then snapped her fingers. The elf stepped forward again.
“The alchemist?” Malfoy asked.
Could you imagine?” He scoffed.
“I am not prickly, and he is not Slytherin material. Do you not realize what our parents would think if we become all buddy-buddy with Harry Potter? The one who ruined most of these people’s families,” Draco gestured around at the other Slytherins.
Draco’s hand moved unconsciously to his throat as his father swept by him. His stomach was still squirming, and he knew it wasn’t entirely from the apparition.
“Listen, Potter, if you were in Gryffindor, I would put you on the Quidditch team this year if I could. I’m afraid Severus wouldn’t be so willing. Keep that in mind for next year. I will keep this between us for now, but another risky act like that…I can’t promise Severus won’t find out.”
"The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads."
The broom was sleek and smooth, with perfectly polished wood and straightened bristles. He and Ron weren’t the only ones gawking at it.
“Literally no one else has noticed because that’s mad,” Blaise said firmly, “I thought Snape warned you about getting close with him.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, looking up from his transfiguration notes with a smirk, “Another midnight trip to visit the oaf? Has that shack burned down yet?”
“Eternal life, maybe. Are you stealing it?”
Any comments/concerns/ideas would be appreciated. I am starved for human interaction so I will accept love in any form. At least I'll have time to work on this:)))
It was hard for Harry to see Ron through the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables, but Harry felt very sick that his new friend hadn’t turned to look at him even once. He thought they’d gotten along pretty well on the train, although he didn’t exactly have a lot of experience in the friends department. Still, he knew he would rather be sitting with Ron across the room than here with Malfoy.
Harry dove for the bag of treats on the floor under his bed and poked one through the bars. Hedwig regarded it disdainfully.
“It is odd. Can’t you just tell them that?” Pansy asked.
“Here, I brought this,” Harry said, pulling the flute he’d gotten from Hagrid out of his robes.
People were pushing past him and he heard a snide, familiar voice just behind them.
“You know I hate when he’s right, but this is one of those times.” Pansy said consolingly, “I don’t like him either, especially since he prefers hanging with
“Everyone important,” Malfoy muttered.
Harry Potter was walking into the Great Hall, dressed in his robes and with his school bag over his shoulder. He made his way to the end of the Slytherin table to sit alone.
“Shut up!” Harry snapped, pulling her flat against the wall. He’d just heard a noise from a nearby room.  Neville squeaked nervously.
“Yeah, but it was less than I thought. I don’t think they told him about magic, at all.”
He started making a point of avoiding Pansy just to stay out of the public eye which meant that he spent a great deal sitting with Theodore Nott, who was mostly silent but at least he didn’t parade him around. Or glare at him constantly as Malfoy, and thus Crabbe and Goyle, were prone to do.
“Go on, then.” Ron said, shifting his bag off the chair next to him, “Better you than Hermione.”
George pulled the car back around and the twins climbed through the window.
“No! Madam Hooch said not to move. You’ll get us all into trouble,” She shouted.
Malfoy’s smirk faded and he looked back down at his notes.
Granger left.
“I don’t
“Draco Malfoy,” Ron said darkly.
“Sorry, Harry, I just ran for it. Can you make it back?” He gasped.
“What’s the elixir of life?” He demanded.
“Yeah, well. What’s the point of surviving the Dark Lord if you get offed by a random mountain troll?” Malfoy shrugged, “You saved me first by jumping on its back. Why did you do that by the way?”
"I’ll go first,” Harry gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
"Potter! Wait!" He shouted before changing his mind again. The man stopped, and turned to look at him, a glimpse of hope clear in his eyes. "You were right. You
He couldn’t. He just couldn’t tell him that everything changed the minute he took his arm that night. That now, he desperately needed him in his life. More than anything.
"You know me too well, Tory. It’s almost frightening. Last night was... wonderful, but what if he grows tired of me and decides to leave? He told me he gets bored easily. He may go after a few days, months, or even years. It’ll be painful anyway."
Potter chuckled but took his fingers out. "You're really eager, aren't you?"
"I'm sorry about earlier. Kyle wasn't letting go and he asked for one last kiss. I just got carried away, knowing you were just there… For the first time, you're here and… available? I would be stupid not to try. I want you, Malfoy. Badly."
“Look! That’s Paris!” Harry squealed, showing a point by the window.
Draco gulped down his drink, put the glass next to the other man's, then he got up only to sit down again on Potter's lap. Startled by the sudden move, the man watched him straddle his legs and immediately put his hands on Draco's waist.
“I think we should go. She obviously wants us to, or she wouldn’t have suggested it in the first place. Plus, it will be nice to end the year and start next one just the three of us. Don’t you think?”
The man remained silent for a long while. Enough for Draco to finish his drink and get up to refill it. Then, when he came to sit again, the look on Potter’s face had changed. He seemed almost resigned.
"It is."
wanted to stay. To which Harry would answer
Draco turned his head left and right. “No one can see us, you know?”
"I see. Is this why you had to come back home tonight?"
“Wait.” He wrapped his arms around the man’s neck and kissed him. “Sorry.” He said after a moment. “I just really needed that.”
"Poor girl." Draco laughed when Potter hit his arm playfully.
Draco watched as his son sucked eagerly on the bottle’s nipple.
. He needed the baby. His son. He couldn’t lose him for a fling.
"That. Is that a Patronus?"
“So, I see Mr Potter is still here.”
Draco tensed a bit but waited. There wasn’t any anger or hatred in the man’s voice. Only... curiosity?
“We. That
"Yes. But, trust me, she's more than happy with our... arrangement. It could have been worse for her. It
“That's all? Why you keep him, then?”
good.”
"A non-physical one. That’s all she can do. But... Oh shut up, Potter. Something’s wrong. She wouldn't send it otherwise."
Draco’s eyes widened. “You...” And, when Harry burst out laughing at his face, he hit him again. “See? Jerk! Now, move that ass of yours and clean us. We should sleep a few hours before Scorpius needs me.”
She looked terrified. And awfully pale. "Yes, you can. You’re strong. Way stronger than me."
"Can you bring us tea?"
“Are you calling my son gorgeous?”
“Can’t it be... repaired? Magically, I mean.”
"Sweet Merlin, don’t tell me you’re horny. I’m way too sore to fuck you right now!" He exclaimed dramatically and she burst out laughing.
“Are you sure I should be here? Wouldn’t it be weird?”
"Same reason, different reactions. Because I wasn't able to be a child before, I now live the way I should have. Free. You should try it, sometimes."
"Private one."
"Get. Off. Me. Potter. Now!"
“Wonderful! I love cruises!” Harry let out a startled laugh. Clearly, the idea of Narcissa Malfoy on a cruise among thousands other people was surprising. “Last year, I went on this all-wizards luxury cruise in Greece. Absolutely unforgettable.” Well, that was more believable. “You will tell me when you want to come. I will make sure everything is perfect.”
"So what? You just don’t see anyone else? What if you want to bring a guy home for a night... or more?"
“Hello there, my boy. How cute you are.” The baby looked at her curiously, then to his father, and stretched. “Oh... you’re so big, already! I can’t believe you’re three-month old, now.”
They finally fell asleep one hour later, after another round, more kisses and love words.
"And your wife?" He looked bitter when he said that. "Does she know her husband, the father of her child, is gay?"
"It's been long since I had sex."
“Yes. It is near Nice, so you can go there on Thursday, stay two nights and leave on the first of January as planned. It’s a lovely hotel and a beautiful spot to see the fireworks over Nice.”
Helped by Harry, Draco settled on the man’s hips and directed his member to his entry, sitting on it easily. He swirled his waist a bit, tightened his hole around the hard-on into it and started to move up and down, making them both moan.
“Muggles... I can’t believe you’re the one saying that.”
“Show him to me.”
to know it was already late in the afternoon. Yet, Potter was clearly going back to the Auror’s Department.
“Potter? You ask me to be your boyfriend and I’m back to Potter? No way!”
“Let’s go. I’m starving.” Harry said, but Draco stopped him.
“Is that a bad thing?”
“I said: I can’t believe you have a son.”
The party lasted until late that night, even after Draco put Scorpius to bed. He asked Poppy to take care of him in a nursery for tonight, because he knew they would probably won’t go to sleep early. So, when Draco and Harry finally walked into Draco’s bedroom at nearly four in the morning, they both nearly passed out all dressed up onto the bed.
“We just went to see her before coming here. That is why we are a bit late. She seems better, don’t you think?”
“That’s... long, right?”
"Hey! I’m smart too!"
"Give me room." He quickly felt Astoria’s belly and waved his wand over her, then frowned. "You." He looked at the House Elf. "Go to St Mungo's and bring back two nurses. Mr Malfoy, I need you to leave the room. Something is wrong with your wife and I can’t have you here."
“The only way to save Lady Malfoy’s life was to remove her uterus. I am sorry to tell you that, but your wife won’t have any children.”
“Yeah, don’t worry. I have had my driving license for five years and I don't have the opportunity to use it very often.”
"I had no hopes of sleeping with you at all before tonight. So, sorry, but I’ll keep hoping."
“That’s the fun part. I can’t wait to see their faces when they’ll see you.”
Draco inhaled sharply as the words finally sunk in. Potter
Hair as wild as ever, tight jeans and tight T-shirt, green eyes sparkling under the bar's lights… It was almost ridiculous to see how attractive he was that night. Everyone else noticed too, but apparently, he was not being very discreet about it all.
"No, no, no! I need to-" She screamed again and Draco lost it.
"So... I really thought your
When they reached the bed, they helped the pregnant woman lie back on it. Draco turned on the lights with a flip of his hand.
"Aaron? Why him?"
"Draco, please."
“Why? Because you have Potter in your bed? Did you see Marco?”
Harry’s gaze moved down to his lap. “Yeah. Why? Do you want to take care of it?”
Together with the Weasley’s, they managed to get the trunk through the window and into the car., though they were all heaving by the time they were done.
“So you’ve heard of them? I don’t know who sent it. There wasn’t a signature.” Harry said.
“For having the mind to recognize both darkness and light within ourselves and making the right choice,” At this, Malfoy swiveled to stare at Harry, “I award five points.”
Narcissa furrows her eyebrows. “Pack?”
“Here for an ultrasound” Narcissa says, proud she knows a bit of muggle technology
Dr Jones frowns. "It may be for the best, rape is traumatic, and from someone like he who must not be named, it must have been horrifying, and for it to result in pregnancy..."
Draco sighs. “Okay, whatever, but I swear if i get one bit of pity from any of them and I'll leave”
Potter shuts the book and looks at Draco. “Did you buy baby things yet? I bought so much stuff, I just couldn’t help myself to be honest” he chuckles slightly
“You’re not a coward, you’re going through a tough time right now with difficult choices. And I'm glad you didn’t abort the baby, but if you give this child up for adoption, it’ll probably end up like the dark lord because it won’t have a family to guide and give them love,” Narcissa says. “I understand though why you don’t want to keep it, but I won't allow you to give it up for adoption”
Draco shakes his head. “Saint Potter” he mumbles
“Thanks mother,” he wipes tears leaking from his eyes before groaning. “Stupid hormones”
Ron tilts his head. "I don't know how Harry managed to sleep with you constantly tossing and turning, though he's probably just as bad to be fair"
Draco’s eyes widen. “Mother…”
“Us?”
“Thank you Pans”
“Nothing,” Hermione and Ron say. “Nothing at all”
Once the picture is printed, the doctor hands out to Draco who shakes his head and gestures to his mother, who gladly takes it with a wide smile.
“H-How do you know that?” Draco slowly lifts his head, trying to take deep breaths but each breath is hitched and cuts off halfway
He leaves the room to find Harry scattering around the flat like a confused cockroach. Draco tilts his head. “What’s wrong?”
Draco groans sitting down in front of Potter and Weasley. Narcissa shakes her head at her son's actions but sits him on the plastic blue chairs. The ticking of the clock in the silent waiting room is like a bomb waiting to go off, ticking down until it’s about to explode
"This came as a big shock," Hermione starts. "So right now you must be overwhelmed with different emotions, i mean we all are, but just know if you guys need anything, we're here for you both" she says glancing between Harry and Ginny with a firm look
“Oi,” Draco whirls around with a sneer. “Watch where you’re going”
“But there’s a chance right?” Draco questions
Ron, Hermione, and Harry blink at that. “Wow,” Ron says. “That’s actually very, I don't know, nice of you?”
‘How long has he been doing this?’ Narcissa wonders rapidly
Pansy frowns but nods. “I understand but--”
Harry enters the fast food restaurant and bites his lip to hide the small smile that threatens to lift on his face. ‘Draco is going to be able to get help’ he thinks to himself happily. Once he’s next in line, Harry asks for two take-away double cheese burgers with chips. He then leaves and once he’s in an alleyway, he apparates home to find Draco watching TV. He smiles widely and it doesn’t drop when Draco stares at him weirdly.
“What’s an ultrasoundy?”
Do they stand a chance together
Harry shrugs, glancing at Ron. “Well, i don’t have anything planned, was going to watch TV”
Draco sighs picking at one of the baby shirts with a deep frown, thoughts whirling across his head. “I understand, but I want nothing to do with this thing, so leave me out of it please, i don’t want to go clothes shopping nor do anything to do with the baby”
“Because it is”
Harry shakes his head. “You were taken advantage of and forced to become pregnant by a horrible man, what you feel is absolutely valid”
“Draco!” a voice exclaims
'...i'm on my way'
It’s slow
“Why does this feel like...like…some sort of goodbye”
“If you weren’t so stubborn and followed me, she wouldn’t have found out”
“This is not right, how the hell are you so calm”
Ginny shakes her head. "No no, of course not"
“That’s easier said than done” Draco scowls
“I will always be here for you, I love you Draco”
“No,” Harry states. “I won’t ‘calm down’, this is not fair”
“Oh,” he says. “No, i’ll be fine”
Draco starts to shuffle off the bed before Narcissa and Pansy could stop him.
Narcissa nods and looks at Draco who is looking at Harry gratefully. “Draco, do you want help packing”
Harry smiles. “It should be fun”
After a few minutes, Draco breathes softly and falls to the floor bringing his knees to his chest and resting his head over them, trying to make himself look as small as possible
“I’ve been vomiting for two weeks and this is the fifth time this week I've been throwing up,” Draco says in wonder out loud to himself, his stomach on top of twisting with nausea is now bubbling with nerves.
“-No, it wasn’t your fault, these things...they just happen sometimes”
Draco turns his head away with a blush. “I wasn’t staring”
A loud deafening silence fills the room. Harry shuts his eyes. "Why?" he questions. "Hermione, you know everything," he says much to Hermione's protest. Harry glares at the ground. "Why must this happen?" he says but knows its not her fault. He grits his teeth, anger bubbling in his stomach
Draco runs across the stage
It said on the instructions that positive means he’s pregnant
“No problem Draco” Harry says, sending him a small smile.
Lucius swallows a thick stream of saliva which is stuck in his throat. “Okay, you don’t have to tell me anything and I won't ask further questions to any of you,” he holds his hands up. “I just don’t want to lose you all again”
“Yeah,” Weasley starts. “I heard you now live in the muggle world, i couldn’t believe it, i had to see it for myself to believe it”
“Don’t,” Draco says again. “Please, i don't want to cause any trouble”
“Okay,” she says. “Let's focus on making lunch”
Potter points to his plate of food. “Are you going to eat that much”
“It is not.” Draco shoves his arms down
Draco whirls to a stop and turns around with his jaw clenched. “Could you yell any louder”
“It doesn’t matter what I think, but if you must know, I think it’s brilliant, a new life is always amazing, even if it is a Malfoy” Potter says.
Harry whirls around to him.”Where have you been, i was worried”
“You were a prat, still are to be honest, but I’m not as closed-minded as i was before, i want us to at least not fight every time we see each other”
“Just go away” Draco sighs
Narcissa smiles but before she could say anything the door opens to reveal a man with silky white-blond hair and familiar grey eyes. He walks in with his hands cuffed together with a red magical seal, and two Aurors on either side of him holding his arms.
“I guess people change”
“I'm going back to bed, im very tired” Draco says
“Like what?”
Pansy glares at him. “At least promise you won’t do anything stupid”
“What you said about...you know, the baby”
Draco smirks. “I see you’re as graceful as ever, bumping into people and making them spill their milk”
“Maybe not, but that won’t change things”
Draco blinks his eyes open to see a bright light shining across his eyes and pain flaring up from his stomach to his chest. Squinting his eyes from the brightness, he rubs them and carefully fumbles around to sit up. He glances around the room and notices his surroundings and the squeaky clean smell to tell that he’s in the hospital
“Fine, just a nightmare” Draco coughs to try and hide his embarrassment
Harry and Hermione send him another look
Draco sighs. “You wouldn’t want to know, it’s very...i don’t know, it’s touchy”
“Whatever”
“Glad we agree,” Narcissa says. “Now let’s go to your ultrasoundy thing and see my grandchild”
Draco shakes his head. “I also have nothing planned”
“I don't know Harry,” Ginny sobs. “I was so careful, how could this happen?” she cries. “Today i found blood when i went to the toilet and i went to the healer and they did a few scans but the baby...the baby...the baby is gone”
“I don’t even know why I'm crying, it must be the hormones," he wipes his eyes. “Anyway,” he starts. “I have an appointment at the hospital to do an ultrasound, do you want to come?”
Peering over it, Draco's heart stops
“I swear i did, maybe it fell or something”
Everything bubbling up inside him starts to overflow as he mutters “Fuck it” and grabs some muggle paper and starts to write in the heat of the moment that yes, he accepts the invitation to go to Hogwarts for eighth year.
“Okay,” the healer says. “Well, the board spoke to us, and we can’t treat you and you can’t come back to St Mungo’s ever again”
“I was very good at hiding it”
“No,” Harry says. “If you’ll want me to know, you’ll tell me in your own time”
Draco sniffles, wiping the dried up tear tracks across his cheeks.
Draco sends her a look. “Really, calling me by my full name”
“You’ve already done so much, i hate being a bother”
“Good”
Draco sends her a smile before entering the room
Narcissa glares at her son. “Draco, this isn’t only about you, this child deserves to be with its family and I will use all my power to make sure it does”
“I’m just saying hello to my friend, can’t i do that,” she says. “Anyway, i just thought we could hang out, it’s been a while since we’ve done that”
Hermione opened her mouth, her eyes flashing, but Harry waved to get their attention.
“She’s very respected,” Parkinson said to Harry, as if that should matter to him, “That’s Blaise Zabini. You’ve met Draco, obviously, and Crabbe and Goyle. Theodore Nott’s on your other side, and Daphne’s down there by Marcus Flint. He’s Quidditch captain, if you’re interested in that at all…”
“So? Are you going to answer my question?” Malfoy asked, tugging on the back of Harry’s sweater.
“He thinks the door is locked,” Harry whispered, waving Neville off who’d been pulling his sleeve.
He threw the ball high into the air. Without thinking, Harry leant forward and hurtled towards the ball. He caught it a moment before it hit the ground. He had a moment sitting in the grass to feel proud of himself before-
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
Malfoy’s eyes found it immediately and Harry could see the indecision in them. His desire to use the cloak must have overpowered his fear of being caught because he put aside his book and papers and rose to join Harry.
Harry darted to grab Hedwig’s cage as George scrambled back through the window. He all but tossed her to Ron before climbing back onto the windowsill.
Harry looked up at her. That sounded like an odd way to word his expulsion.
Harry glanced back at the others as he went. Ron looked sympathetic, Granger scandalized, and Malfoy was looking particularly triumphant.
Snape stood and seemed to notice Draco for the first time. His furious expression had previously been levied at Harry, but it had been tinged with something that looked like triumph. Now he was staring at Draco as if Draco had grown a second head. The triumph disappeared so quickly that Draco wondered if it had ever been there at all.
Standing in the center of the room was a three-headed dog, all six eyes blinking blearily as it stirred. It must have been asleep when they entered but it was quickly waking up. The only thing louder than it’s growls was Harry’s heartbeat in his ears. He turned and opened the door and threw himself out, the others on his heels. They were running again- Ron once again pulling ahead. If Harry had been thinking clearly, he would have paid more attention to where they were going, but as it was, he followed the Gryffindors all the way to the seventh floor. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. Harry had seen it before but hadn’t known it was the Gryffindor common room.
Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know."
Hermione, funnily enough, didn’t have time to explain Nicholas Flamel the next morning on her way to board the train, though she was very excited when Harry showed her the chocolate frog card.
“We’ll take care of it,” George said, throwing Harry a thick piece of chain.
"What is it?" Harry asked eagerly.
It was a relief when they had finally finished their last exam, though it was soured exponentially when they discovered that Snape would be making an attempt at the stone that very night.
"No, we don't mind," he said. "She literally followed me out of the tower, it was like someone had cast a permanent sticking charm…”
“Potter? He’s not what I had expected,” There was no questioning who she meant. There wasn’t anyone at Hogwarts interesting enough for his mother to ask about.
Also, I'm following the book pretty closely in the first and second one because I genuinely don't think a lot of it would change. After that, I'll be taking more liberties of my own. That said, I'll do my best not to regurgitate the original books when getting across the same, but important, events.
A few days later, they received their letters from Hogwarts. Harry’s was among them. With the post, Ron received Hermione’s reply, inviting them to meet her in Diagon Alley to shop for supplies.
He followed McGonagall to her office silently. His first few weeks at Hogwarts had been pretty hit-and-miss but he thought it would get better now that he was making friends outside of Slytherin. Even if it wouldn’t, he didn’t think Slytherin was worse than the Dursley’s. He felt sick just thinking about going back.
