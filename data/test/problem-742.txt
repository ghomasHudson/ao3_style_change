He felt so embarrassed to go out in what would be considered pajamas, but Harry’s pants, though bigger than his, would be too long and he’d rather look like a man just waking up, than someone who didn’t know how to dress.
Draco tried pulling his hands free, his breathing shuddering with emotion. “You hate me now, right? You have to. You...have to hate me now...right?” His voice trailed off into a whimper.
Harry bit his lip, obviously keeping back some sort of retort. It must’ve been bad if he was holding back.
Draco huffed, falling asleep to happy fantasies and memories of earlier that day along with revenge schemes playing in his head.
They chatted and Harry ate his chocolate in a few bites while Draco nibbled his. He didn’t care much for sweets. Only when Harry and Lupin got into some sort of banter, did Draco realize how at “home” he felt. Even without Harry’s mark, they acted as if he was Harry’s. As if he belonged there. Like he was part of their family.
“With all the information I’ve gathered, Mr. Black-Lupin, it definitely seems your results of the ultrasound seem factual. You see, for some reason, bear-type numbers are VERY small. Not even 1% of the world’s population. Their magic is very powerful, even the weaker ones. Usually when a bear-type chooses a mate, their mate will have some sort of change. In females it’s usually higher fertility or an immunization to their mates magic, something minute. Males, usually similar results or the changes could be as simple as a need for only that bear and their body will reject anyone else. Here.” She handed him the picture and he was very confused.
The Weaslette squeaked and ended up yanking the tail hard, her grip tightening at the sudden claws going towards her face.
Draco chuckled nervously and looked up with adoring eyes at Harry. “Do you think your parents would mind if I stole their last name? I mean...I WAS the mate of Pup Black-Lupin.” He looked at Harry with big eyes.
Her own ears went back, uncertain, but she complied. Harry wasn’t sure why she complied, but he was happy she did. Though, he wasn’t sure if Draco calling her “mother” was intended.
Harry could only nod as he was shooed out. Logically, it kinda made sense. But...Draco’s expression had said otherwise. He wondered what was in it, and what had made that swirl of magic appear agains his Claim mark.
Draco put his hand on Harry’s back to push himself into standing straight, when he wasn’t bent that far, but paused right next to Harry’s face.
Everyone was gathering out front to go to Hogsmead. Some people were already bunched in their groups or with partners.
Harry side glanced her. “Yeah. He loved those things. There was usually only enough for Draco and he needed it more than me. What kind of livers did you use? Those were his favorite. You still send them, right? I know he gets them less than when he was pregnant.” He began to think. His mate did love them.
Draco realized. Riddle knew where they were. He was waiting for the perfect time to blow away Draco’s cards.
Harry couldn’t help the deep growl that vibrated through his body and out his throat. He could feel how upset Draco was becoming.
He choked on his breath. There were faces in his mind. In the picture. Even with a crooked tail, even with his past, he was happy.
Draco shook his head hard, clearing his throat as he ran his shaking hands through messy blonde locks, trying to regain composure. “It-it was just an impulse, Harry. Remains from my nightmare. I’m fine. Nothings the matter. Your silly mate just had a vivid nightmare. We should-we should go get Albus. You wanted to play Wizards Chess with Ronald, yeah?”
Bellatrix cackled maniacally as Astoria and Scorpius held faces of horror, Scorpius screaming as best he could and Astoria refusing, begging.
The week passed by with stolen kisses and secret glances since it was busy, everyone doing projects and bustling about to get ready for their parents coming during the weekend.
He knew part of it was the fucking Claim. His body for some reason reacted unnaturally strong to one. He’d have to see if there were records on it. Or ask Professor Lupin. He was Claimed.
Harry huffed a laugh and leaned down, kissing gently over Draco’s collarbone and up his throat, sucking softly at his pulse under his jaw, making Draco gasp out a small moan, one hand looping in Harry’s belt loops and the other tangling in the curls at the base of Harry’s skull.
“Right. I can...kind of say the same.” Draco found it easy to smile. “Harry would talk about his “Pop” and “Dad” often. Then I head Professor Lupin speak to you over the phone.”
The candy fell out of his pocket as he was getting back into his normal clothes and though he hated sweets, he popped the round candy in his mouth as he left the hospital.
When he opened the door to the dungeons, the Slytherin dormitory, he spotted Blaise and the honorary Slytherin Longbottom, both sitting on the couch, Blaise listening to whatever the rabbit said.
‘I wonder if he still sleeps like he used to?’ He wondered, curious since a picture came into his head of waking up in Harry’s arms like when they were kids. Warm, safe.
He was good with Law. For one he was a Slytherin and another, he’d argued with some of the best here and back at home. He’d have to wedge his way in somewhere. Even the bottom, if he chose to leave.
Harry wished he knew what Draco meant, but instead, he kissed Draco’s ears, trying to comfort him. “I know. Now let’s get to someone you don’t hate.”  He picked Draco up, as if carrying a large bag and began to walk downstairs to their floo chimney that was there.
He saw Longbottom put down the watering can and rummage around, looking for what Draco wanted. “Y-you know we aren’t allowed near it though. You’re gonna risk losing points?”
Draco did feel uncomfortable. Neither had barely spoken a word since the main hall incident. “You don’t have to apologize for what happened between us. I’ve made amends with your parents about my behavior and I’ve even apol....tried to be less cruel, to Ronald.”
Draco went over, grabbed Harry’s face and pulled him down fast to make a long lick horizontally across Harry’s mouth. It was rough and a bit sand-papery, but before Harry could do anything, do it back or kiss him properly, Draco pulled away, skidding back fast so Harry couldn’t grab him.
He wondered what Draco saw in them. He could have any new or shiny or anything probably worth more. Something like those earrings should’ve been nothing but trash.
Draco snorted, pressing himself more into Harry before kissing him in 3 quick pecks, the last one he gave the “muah” noise to.
He tried making himself even smaller, tried being even quieter. He couldn’t even focus on Harry’s voice since the others were speaking even louder.
“Well, I have what I need. Then I can also keep an eye on you so you don’t get into trouble for once.” His interest quickly turned to his usual aloof front.
She looked to him sympathetically. “Please, I assure you nothing is wrong. You’re not sick. It’s just something...odd.”
He slid to the floor, covering his eyes. He startled when he felt Harry pull his body into his own, Draco sucking up the warmth.
He heard Draco make that “brrrip” noise from the kitchen. “Yeah, and you better explain why you’re so late. 3:00am? That’s ridiculous, Potter. But anyway, so Luna sent another meat pack and it was a liver, which I know you don’t care for, so I’m eating it. You can heat up what I had originally made you earlier. Been craving liver.” He said the last bit more absentmindedly. “I promise we can get you the meat for your favorite dinner later, when they open. You have-technically today-off, right? Maybe we can-“ he cut off when walking out, probably wondering why Harry hadn’t come into the kitchen, he had a bowl of uncooked and bloody liver in his hand.
He saw the blush that spread fast and wild across Draco’s face, across his ears and down his neck. He pushed Draco’s hands away, enough where he could speak. “Well until you formally break up with me, I can call you whatever I want!”
Draco realized. Fucker was trying to be funny. Not wanting to let Harry’s head bang against the rock, he set his head back down, Harry lifting it himself.
Draco hadn’t meant for that. “No-it’s just-Harry...” he took a deep breath again, “my body has been literally altered because of your magic through the course of the 13 years I’ve had your bite. I’m worried...you won’t like them. The changes...I mean.” He turned his head. This nervous wreck wasn’t like him. He could stare down criminals or people who thought they could bend the laws that he knew every trick to, and he beat them without breaking his small victorious smirk.
Draco grabbed his sweater, getting in Harry’s face which startled him. His silver eyes looked pleadingly at him, begging. “I don’t care that you are one. You’re still Harry to  me. But please. I don’t care if you have to take the extra caution to change your ears or make yourself have a tail for the day. When the parents come, Harry, stay away from the Malfoys.”
Harry looked shocked at first, but he grinned large, revealing his giant canines. “They love you anyway, what’s new with you taking their names?”
He hadn’t even realized that’s what he was doing. He just knew he was in no mood to be the perfect Malfoy. He was so tired.
Harry was so confused. Draco really had been itching for a fight and had been his old self. The brat that he was. But now, after they hurt each other...why couldn’t Draco be easier to figure out?!
Draco had to assure him and comfort him for a month, in secret, away from their child. Both had agreed. They’d work on their problems together, but let their child be a child.
Harry just smiled widely and laughed, tilting his head down to kiss Draco’s abdomen and Draco heard him whisper, “I love you too, little one. Grow.”
Draco rose a beautiful brow and smirked, though Harry could tell he was fighting a full grin. “You always were a rule-breaker, Potter.”
Though looking at the stitched up and sleeping Draco, Harry picked up Albus, going over to sit next to Draco.
Harry felt a jealous pang at seeing Draco smile at the girl and pet her head. He didn’t know what they were talking about, but she looked relieved. Luna Lovegood was a mouse and very odd.
Draco awoke with a gasp and body wracking sob. His body was covered in sweat and tears ran down his cheeks.
Harry could feel the purr in Draco’s chest. He rolled his eyes. He and Ron were in the middle of a game. “Nah. I’ll stop by once Ron n’ I are done though, if you all aren’t back by then. Gotta beat him at this.”
Harry swore Draco was more childish than anyone knew. “Make it in the hidden area past the Quidditch field and it’s a date.”
Something was stopping him from doing it.  Not physically. It’s like he knew if he did, he’d never be forgiven, even if Draco found out who he was.
Harry looked at him confused. All he knew about Draco’s family was they were rich, strict with status and were prudes and they gave him the beautiful Draco.
“Mione’ had to go to the store for some things for Rose. I stayed back to watch.” She came out in a tank and work out pants, her hair in a ponytail.
Draco had to admit. She was a much easier person to know as an adult than it was when they were kids.
He noticed the look on Harry’s face. From the distance, and lack of eye visual, he wasn’t sure if he was pitying him or was concerned.
“So it wasn’t a fluke. You called me by my first name.” His eyes glittered. It was too much for Draco.
“You’re not alone anymore, Draco. You have Pop and Dad. Hermione, Blaise, Pansy, and Neville. You also have me.” Harry began to snort a laugh as a thought ran through his head, successfully having Draco in his arms, his face on Draco’s crown. “You even have Ron.”
“Sorry, my friends should be in soon. I’m Harry. Harry Potter.” The boy, Harry, reached his hand out and Draco’s stomach clenched painfully. The gesture similar.
She let out a bark of laughter. “No way, Ma...Draco. You’d be the one to blame since you’re the rich boy.”
For a bit, while they were being loud, Harry had thought Draco was falling asleep. His eyes had drooped and at some point closed. That wasn’t the case with how fast he lashed out once Ginny, for some fucking reason, decided to grab his tail and yank on it.
She hit her palm against his forehead, it was getting heated on her end, whatever it was. Draco stiffened though when he saw the muscle in Harry’s jaw clench as he tried smiling at her to obviously placate her.
Hey, so I got an idea to alternate POV so that’s gonna start with this chapter. So next chapter should be Draco POV and so on. I’ll always make sure y’all know though, in case.
On his walk back, it was busy. The downside to living in the city. He didn’t care for it. His head began to throb as he walked in the station doors, most likely from all the paperwork, only to have pain shoot through his head when someone walked past him, bumping into his shoulder.
By then, whether due to genuine enjoyment or sleepless delusion, Draco was laughing so hard he was gripping his stomach and had tears in his eyes.
Draco’s tail wasn’t in a splint, though the crook was still there. He moved it like normal. He must’ve went to Madame Pomphrey.
‘What a nervous nelly.’ Draco thought. “I need some of that whomping willow crack. You know, I used it a few weeks ago on the thing.” He put his palm up, moving his fingers in a ‘gimme’ motion.
He hadn’t Claimed Draco, despite his approval on his birthday months ago. He didn’t feel it would be fair to his beautiful mate.
He’d been put on maternity leave since it had gotten harder for Draco to work long hours on his feet or deal professionally with others. So, Pansy, ever knowing Draco, decided to have him work from home and do most everyone’s paperwork while they picked up his part in cases.
He wasn’t even sure why he was trying to make enemies with someone the Wizarding world held in a such high praise.
Draco laughed until he lost his balance tripping over his own ankle, but before he could yell, he was suddenly against the hallway wall with Harry’s hands on either side of his head and his scent close enough it sent a warm hum through Draco’s body.
He had panicked, wondering why he hadn’t heard anyone behind him, when he realized it was a Bengal. She was beautiful with sandy hair and piercing jade eyes. No wonder he hadn’t heard her approaching. He couldn’t even cover his neck, his body froze. Then, he had blacked out and the next thing he remembered was putting up a barrier charm 5 times in a row to keep anyone out.
If the Riddle thought he could be petty because Draco was the only one smart enough to flee, then Riddle had another thing coming.
He heard Neville blabber and it made it want to torment. “I’m just pulling your ears, Longbottom. Say...can-can you do me a favor?”
Harry thought he was going to say Black-Lupin. But his breath caught when Draco looked back at Harry, a steely fire in his eyes, along with a grin, almost conspiringly.
Draco must’ve been holding whatever it was he was angry about, in, for a long time. His brows were furrowed in an attempt not to cry, though his whole body shook.
“He’d hate it too.” Harry began to laugh, picturing his best friend blue and green in the face knowing he’d have to deal with Draco. “It’d be funny to see him struggle.”
The doctor made an “ah” sound, like he understood. That was more than Harry did. “You see, Mr. Potter, under a large amount of stress or trauma, a woman, or in this case, man, can go into premature labor. That was all, once the nurses and I leave, you can see them. The baby is quite healthy though small.”
Draco wasn’t just angry, Harry saw that. He saw hurt there, in those beautiful silver eyes. He didn’t blame him.
He turned to retreat to his bed but Neville stopped him. “Harry brought them to you right? I’ll put them in Blaise’s fridge. Which he won’t touch right?” The question was directed at Blaise, who rolled his eyes and did a ‘eh’ motion with his hand.
“You better not go blurting out that you say a Malfoy weak and barely able to stand. If you do, I’ll reveal one of your secrets.” Draco’s voice was growing in confidence but still shaky.
“I’m such a coward. I should’ve told you that day, on the train.” Harry whispered, his voice wracked with guilt.
It took a moment for Harry’s brain to catch up to what Draco sobbed into his hands. He himself didn’t know much about his parents’ deaths. Yes, it was tragic, but to Harry it was more tragic seeing what effect their deaths still have on Sirius and Remus. Why would Draco say that when he didn’t-wouldn’t have known how Harry’s parents died?
He trembled, walking in anyway. There was no point running from something that could take down a whole race.
He swayed his hips, trying to ignore Draco’s hand in his. Draco definitely didn’t know what to do, he observed how Harry danced and tried to imitate.
“Now why’re you doing that? You’re so thin as is, Draco. Hm? What’s that?” Her voice squeaked and he felt the chill of her ghost fingers brush along his mark. A body shuddering chill went down his spine. Oddly enough, he felt no need to guard his neck from her. He suspected it was because she was dead.
The week after Lupin’s visit had Draco going through a few days of fever and pain. He didn’t know why, this time was a bit different. This time, the pain was worse and he saw the thin streams of magic that his father must’ve been talking about, that was leftover from Pup. The magic flickered. It was weak, but that was fine because Pup wasn’t there to renew his bite.
Upon laying eyes on their “guest”, Draco’s eyes widened and he dropped the bowl, it shattered, getting meat and some blood on the floor. He was looking around frantically.
He didn’t even care that he looked like he got in a fight with the greenhouse and he still had Harry’s blood on his hands.
“If you think I know where there’s others of his race, I have no idea. He doesn’t even know any of his kind.” Draco tried convincing Tom as he walked down the quiet, cold, almost clammy hallway towards the dining room. He held his tail close and could only hope Rose and Albus made it home safely. “You’ve dwindled it enough, so why are you still trying?” Anger flared in his belly then, he turned to face the red eyed Wolverine. “Why bring me into this?! You know full well I’m not getting the mark. You’ve humiliated me enough. Funny trick with the meat, by the way. So glad you figured I’d forgotten.” He spoke with a drip of sarcasm. He knew showing defiance was one of the worst things he could do. He’d spent too long married to Harry and it was showing.
“I can’t even feel my tail. You sure I have one? Gotta tell me, Professor.” He blinked, trying to smirk and play it off, but his smirk came out watery and wobbly.
His eyes were needles. “Let go of my tail, Weaslette!” He hissed. It shot so much pain up his spine, Draco couldn’t even touch his own tail to pull it away.
Albus straightened and nodded. “I’ll be good!” He then ran in the chimney and with a stance of confidence, he yelled the Weasley-Granger house and like that, their boy was gone.
She looked at him confused but got up quickly and grasped his hand, as well as taking a small brightly colored candy out of her purse. “Sweets, they always help you make friends.”
He saw a package at the door, once he got there to unlock it. A stamp said beef and when Draco checked to see who would send it, it having a chill charm around it, it looked to be from Luna. She was traveling to strange places, so maybe. Draco shrugged. He could make something with it soon.
He tried diverting the attention and lifted Albus in one go. He was getting so big and Draco was still a twig. Albus protested but didn’t squirm too much. Walking out, he let his tail wrap around Harry’s thigh, a way to say for him to follow.
For some reason, it just made Harry smile. “You know how bad my eyes are. We know each other better than anyone, remember?”
Harry could’ve sworn he heard Draco humming. He wiped his mouth, surprised at how little wet it was.
Draco rolled his eyes, patting Harry’s cheek and allowing his tail to wrap around Harry’s thigh for a moment before letting go and Harry releasing him.
Draco didn’t say, when he reached up to rub Harry’s ear, the one with the earring. Harry grinned at him anyway.
He felt Harry come over and go under with him. Draco tried hiding his hips. As far as he knew, Harry didn’t know.
He did have to remove the splint and he felt for the damage, knowing Madame Pomphrey must not have gotten to it.
Draco smelled like blood, dirt, and salt water. He always smelled like salt or rain water. Well...when he wasn’t wearing cologne.
Draco took one last big breath, placing his hand on the back of his neck, claws sinking deep into the flesh.
“I see how your jaw clenches when you don’t want to do what others say or when you get mad.” He stomped closer. Harry didn’t move.
He didn’t have to, as Neville smiled. “Just let me grab a book. I’ll be right outside. Then if you want to chat, I can hear you.”
Now that he found Harry, more like he found Draco, Draco didn’t ever want to let go. He knew that was childish and clingy but his instincts screamed to not be separated again. He’s not sure he could do that pain a second time.
Draco sighed. “How did you even find me? You stalking me? That’s illegal, you know. Oh, what would everyone think? Their precious Harry Potter being arrested for stalking a Malfoy. What would the papers say?” He paused his taunting to think and frowned. “Actually scratch the paper idea. They’d take your side. Probably accuse me of threatening you...ha! What a joke.”
Harry leaned back up, moving where he was sitting with Draco oddly in his lap. He placed his hands on Draco’s hips, to keep him there. “Do you want me to use a spell to heal it?”
“Have a nightmare, Draco?” He asked. The man had a musky scent. Like a weasel. He smelled like rotten things.
Harry couldn’t feel what Draco was, or what he might be truly thinking, but there were some ticks he saw, gestures and the such.
Said girl huffed and turned her head. Harry wasn’t aware of the eyebrow raise from one of the smartest girls in school as he had said Draco’s first name.
When he saw the kids, they were out back, Albus trying spells with Draco’s wand, all of it backfiring. He let out a small smile before walking towards them. “Hey, Al. Rosy.” He smiled a bit bigger when the kids jumped, letting out small screams.
Draco rubbed his jaw, scanning the table. His father had let out a breath, pinching the bridge of his nose, disappointed again. His mother gave him a pitying look. Astoria was trying to comfort Scorpius by rubbing his hand, bags under her eyes. The small bat had half an ear missing and was very thin, his wings not as big as they should be, possibly from malnutrition. No doubt Astoria knew how bad meat was for the both of them but unable to leave, if the mark was anything to go by.
Draco had just finished putting in a Floo chimney in Albus’ room, the nursery turned his room in the end. He didn’t want anyone finding out about it, though he knew it would be smart to tell Harry.
Draco sighed when he got to his bed. He paused though when he pulled back the covers and got wrapped in.
Hours later, as it neared noon, stacks of meat, wrapped neatly, some from the fridge, others the freezer, lay on the table in front of Harry. He’d been staring at them for half an hour. He should try it, find out where it came from. Like looking at dirt and finding out what region it was from. Problem was…Harry had a bad feeling about it. Something that sounded like Draco’s voice told him to leave it.
Draco scoffed inwardly. He was just another Bear, who just so happened to look a little like his Pup.
He sat where the man usually made him when he was young. There was a plate of meat in front of him. Draco didn’t know what meat it was.
“No need, Potter. I don’t want anything to do with Hero “boy who lived and can’t die” Potter.” Draco sighed, looking away. “Right.”
The three sitting jumped when they heard a sudden cracking of wood. Harry startled and looked down to the case he had been grabbing. His grip had gotten so tight he broke the suitcase, a large dent of splintered wood as the aftermath.
As he got dressed, he ran his fingers across his Claim again. He pictured what he did before Pup bit him. A small gathering of friends and close family. He tried picturing the faces he never saw before.
He swore it felt like the claim mark was searing into him. Narrowing his eyes, he ripped the letter. He ripped and ripped it until he couldn’t anymore, the pieces too small.
“Hey...come to see me weak, Potter? Heh...too-too bad. I’ll be...up soon to-to give you a-a scolding for-for...I’m not sure...haha.”
“Hahaha! Scared you, did we, Harry?” It was Sirius, walking in, a lazy grin on his mouth. Remus popped up after, a little more subdued.
“You’re skin and bone, child! Are you not feeding him right, Harry dear?” She put her hands on her hips.
During the ride, he noticed how close the Weaslette sat to Harry. How she angled herself and spoke to him as if he were everything she’d dreamed of.
He carefully, tail as straight as he could, he walked down the stairs. The portraits actually spoke this time and it wasn’t the nicest things. It was bad enough where he heard Ginny come to the bottom. She crossed her arms, brow quirked and a smirk. “What’s going on?”
It stopped though, at Draco’s reaction. He covered his mouth with one hand, something seemed to click in his mind without his mother saying more, the other wrapping around his belly, his claws digging into the fabric. He began to hyperventilate and his ears pinned back. Harry grabbed his hand when he slowly got close enough, causing Draco to gasp and jolt. He looked at Harry’s eyes, Harry not liking the fear there.
Harry chuckled. Draco glared. “You fucker, I should claw you on purpose for that stunt. Then when people ask and you say, “my mate clawed my rugged face off”, I’ll say, “bastard damn well deserved it”!”
Harry used Draco’s distraction to his advantage. Sliding the hand not gripping Draco’s wrist, to dig into his other hand. Draco flinched but Harry wasn’t done. He slowly took the glasses from Draco’s palm,  the glasses landing on the ground, then he slid his fingertips against Draco’s palm, going up until his fingers were intertwined with Draco’s thin, shaking ones.
She went to work and put whatever clear liquid inside the syringe, she was muttering something, trying to concentrate on her task.
The moment Draco could, he used a spell to clean up the earrings. He knew they were dingy but upon looking at the opal’s shine, he knew he was right. The red and green were light and gleaned in different areas depending on the light. There was a gold ring around the opal itself then on the outer edge it was silver. Though when it was old looking it looked like a rusting worthless piece.
Draco shuddered and he knew his eyes had to be dilated. He was always weak to Harry’s Claim. Even when it wasn’t the marriage one.
Part of Draco appreciated she didn’t know him. But with others still around, he couldn’t let it be shown he was allowing a mixed breed to defend him.
He chuckled nervously. “It’s just to remind me what I almost lost. It only bothers me during winter or if someone is rough with it.”
Draco sighed. “The Malfoy family is part of the group of genocidal purists. It was before I was born and it’s died down. But I’m scared, Harry. You’re not just a bear, you’re the one who had gotten in their way for years. So Harry...”
From where he was next to Harry, he could feel the growl vibrating in him. Harry was about to do something reckless.
“Don’t waste your breath, Weaslette. I will never accept false apologies. We both know you’d do it over again if given the chance.”
Draco didn’t think about it and when he was kissing Harry, he swiped his tongue against Harry’s lips, causing the other to growl in his throat and deepen the kiss. Draco could feel the blush past the tips of his hair.
‘You either lie to your Bear and work for me or I could kill your child. I’m trying to dwindle the Bear population, not allow it to grow, after all.’ Tom had whispered in his ear as the children were busy. Draco saw the Deatheater across the playground, knowing what he’d have to choose.
As Albus aged, he certainly looked like Harry. He was a Bear, no tail except what bears had. His skin was the same shade as Harry’s now but unlike his father, he had pale freckles in contrast. Draco did have to admit the straight hair and eye shape was from him, but it wasn’t enough to ease Draco’s worry.
Ginny’s eyes looked like they were about to pop out of the sockets. She probably wasn’t expecting Draco to be decent. “Wow...A Malfoy actually used my name. Wow, I should’ve recorded that.” She crossed her arms.
He walked a bit more, already feeling the effects of the “medicine”. He saw the old woman’s bathroom. He could see if Moaning Myrtle was still around.
She muttered. “Alright. Let’s get an X-ray of your spine. I’m surprised though, that you haven’t used a heal spell for your tail, now that I see it.”
He felt Draco’s hand twitch and his eyes groggily opened. Harry smiled. “Hey, love.” He whispered, almost afraid to speak normal.
Draco snorted. “That sounds like you’re trying to be a perfect mate by offering me everything. You want one, don’t you?”
Ever since, he’d been trying to find out what he could, but there wasn’t many by the Black-Lupin name. Individually there was. But not as a couple. Fuck, maybe Pup got it wrong? Draco had found out years ago that Pup was most likely a nickname used so often, the other kid thought it was his name.
If he wanted to be new, he had to rid himself of the past. He hoped he was making the right decision.
Sirius looked to Harry, his normally black eyes shining with a reddish hue. Harry knew he made him mad.
Draco knew what he was saying. He smiled, this one forced. “It’s just our professors, Harry. You should worry about yourself.”
Draco fought to make a joke, but he smiled so wide he swore his mouth would split. He grabbed some crates and things to make him a bit higher. He made sure everyone was outside and he saw Sirius dragging Remus out. Harry had already opened it received most of his gifts, it was just Draco’s left to go. He cleared his throat and whistled.
He rinsed his mouth of the bile, the spike of heat going back to the chill. “It’s my Claim. Why? Were they still doing that in your day?”
His father was getting impatient and his mother couldn’t keep his father calm enough to stall for time much longer.
Draco had to hide the grin at the imagery and try to not laugh. Maybe this should be how he torments Potter? It’d be entertaining.
Draco could already feel the clenching in his heart. He took a bite, as is. It was the meat from the dream.
Harry’s own eyes widened. Well...there goes not approaching a Malfoy. He sighed. “That’s not for me to decide. Let’s make a deal. I’ll bring you there, but if he doesn’t want to see you, you leave quietly without an issue. Is that good?” His eyes darkened though as he purposely looked in her blue eyes. “Just a little tip, in case your wand is easy to get to: I don’t need a wand to cast magic, nor do I need incantations spoken out loud. Aim to harm him and I have no fear making this threat.”
Harry felt a weird lump in his throat. He was happy, now that the panic and anxiety was leaving. He gripped Albus’ small fist between his thumb and fingers, feeling how warm he was.
He kept his head turned away from Harry. “Just felt like it, Potter. Go off to your precious Weaslette. I’ll be out of your unruly mop of hair soon.” His voice was quiet but there was spite there. Harry saw him clench at the dirt beneath his fingers.
Harry’s focus was immediately on alert. He’d have to tell Draco later, if he was going to be late. Hopefully they could wrap it up or find something substantial.
Lupin replied by simply handing Draco a to-go container of hot tea, placing a warm pad against the base of his tail and giving Draco a smile he could only call fond as he nodded.
Draco’s heart was in his throat. He knew his tail must be showing his nerves. Harry’s hand on his lower back was not as comforting as he’d hoped.
He had that thing called friends that no amount of money or status could make him feel they weren’t worth more.
It hurt him more seeing Draco try and brush off whatever pain he was in. He felt Draco’s body tremble as he sat up, which was difficult due to his tail being in a splint.
“What’s the big deal? Can he even feel it? I mean, it was all broken and bent.” Ron added. Ron was an idiot, they knew so he must not have thought.
Sirius’ eyes widened then he smiled wider. “My family talks to you about me?” He released Draco, who just stood a bit awkwardly.
Harry scratched the back of his head. “Well...I know it’s probably quite the walk and I know you’ve been alone-“
“‘Ere ya go! Fetched it for ya, Master.” Bellatrix hummed joyfully. She went towards Astoria, one hand clenched against her forearm, nails digging into Astoria‘s mark, the other handing Astoria her wand back, but staying close.
Harry felt there was a whole conversation going on underneath, but his hackles raised at Narcissa‘s eye gesture to Draco’s belly. Draco must have saw him approaching, feeling the magic pulse, because he held a shaking arm out. Harry visibly saw how much Draco was trembling and it worried him, but he listened. If Draco wanted anything from him, he’d tell him. Harry still felt that protective pull, but he tried keeping it in check.
Draco’s eyes looked to his, red ringed but glittering like starlight. He grinned large. “Of course. Can’t have him be a reckless and gullible Gryffindor now, can we?”
Yes, it was a romantic thought, but after going through a great portion of it alone and feeling ill from anyone to come near it, he was resenting Claims.
Narcissa didn’t move, nor say. She seemed to be thinking, if how she did was similar to how Draco would. “Draco...”
She looked at him, startled. She had long brown hair and was dressed in business attire. She smiled small. “Hello.”
He nuzzled, despite feeling Draco’s whole body go ridged and he stopped breathing. Harry knew what this meant back when they were kids. How close and what he should’ve done.
Harry knew what he was saying and he begged to differ. He grasped Draco’s hand that was on his chest, tilted the palm up and kissed there. It was light, but the energy behind it spoke more volumes than any touch could.
Harry felt sick, he had his hand over his mouth, ears back, green eyes wide. He clenched his other hand to his knee, willing his magic to stay calm, else he destroy something. His heart thumped in his chest like a hammer he wanted to beat that Wolverine with.
But he knew that was a lie. His body didn’t reject Harry. He sought out Harry. He...didn’t feel regret or guilt for kissing him. His body accepted him.
The house elf fidgeted. “This-this wouldn’t have to do with your mark would-would it? B-because Dobby was ordered to-to not get information for Master Draco regarding the-the person who Claimed him. Dobby is sorry. Stupid Dobby. Dobby’s not allowed to say that.” The house elf began hitting his own head.
He followed the scent to a ledge out one of the hall windows. Draco was sitting, his knees pulled to his chest, that same crooked tail wrapped around his shins. He swore he saw those silver eyes shine with wetness. He wasn’t sure if Draco knew he was there.
“Hm? I did, with Blaises’ help. They were in the Gryffindor corridors so we brought them here. Harry said you had a bad fever and you were stuck in the infirmary.”
He saw Draco throw one arm limply across his eyes. “What are you doing, Draco? Heh....stupid...” he muttered to himself, a small whisper, his Adam’s apple bobbing.
Though through one book, not one on Claims, but a history book, he learned Bear-types were highly regarded in ancient times so their magic became stronger. So much so there was possibility of them doing it wand free and those who were Claimed went through changes, the length of time depending on the magic strength and soul compatibility. Though that last one was speculation, there not being any evidence to support it.
She turned her head, startled, and Harry swore he’d seen her before. It was the eyes, he’s sure. so similar to Draco’s. Maybe it was the light hair, though she had a large streak of black. She looked him up and down, her posture straightened and eyes hardened.
Harry vaguely saw Draco’s shape get closer. “I didn’t...go easy, I mean. You’ve been...in a more fowl mood than usual so I...”
“What’s this? Sirius I thought you were home.” Both men looked over, Sirius breaking into a toothy grin.
When they both began to get sleepy, their swaying became slower. Draco’s eyes kinda drooped and his large smile turned into a small grin.
Harry’s eyes widened in concern when he saw Draco unravel the bandages. He didn’t have to be right behind Draco to see the still bloody gashes against his neck.
“Draco. I’m disgusted. You don’t greet us when we arrive and instead you’re kissing a male. Must you be a disappointment even when away from home? Is this what our line has come to? With A...” his father stopped to observe what Harry was, and Draco realized. He didn’t make Harry disguise himself! He began to panic.
A sudden thought hit him. Harry knew very little of Draco’s childhood. He knew nothing from before they met to even after they saw each other again. He’d have to ask him one day.
He wanted to tell him. But with the animosity between them and that Draco was actually, well...part of something deeper. Something more. How could “Pup” compare to that?
Harry grinned, a bit forced. “You know he’d be more mad you didn’t at least say hi or give him a kiss before you left.”
Later that night, as they walked home, Harry had begun to carry Draco since Draco insisted on being a tease.
Getting up, he picked her up, Rose still being awake even as she made noises and chewed on her tail.
Hermione and Ron were surprised to see the couple, but as Weasley’s do (and Hermione loved them so she wouldn’t turn them away) they were invited in.
He told the nurse why he was even there and she said she’d see about getting an ultrasound done to see if there’s anything serious that’s going on. The usual things, he supposed.
“Ferret, you’re not making sense.” Harry put his hand on the back of Draco’s neck and he felt it burn. Not badly.
Harry nodded, Draco’s smile making him grin ear to ear. “Yep. Our little Albus. They had to do an emergency c-section. How’re you feeling?”
As he waited for his turn to board the train with Pop, he caught a familiar scent then saw the familiar cute ears and blonde hair, approaching them. Draco was dressed nicely. Unlike the night before, where Harry realized, he hadn’t even noticed that Draco’s hair had been a mess and he was in pajamas like himself! He should’ve stared more...wait...
The doctor hummed, looking over some notes and the picture. “There isn’t one, since you’re still male. If you were to hold child, it might have to be a c-section. That’s ONLY and IF you get pregnant and can do a full term. We don’t have enough information on how complex the magic has made everything to make any judgments. So, don’t be too concerned with that for now. Check in if you have another fever or worse, okay?” She patted his knee and left.
Draco opened his eyes, the ache in his body fading, though the clenching in his abdomen still pinched occasionally. He felt the rough hand of Harry’s gently rub his cheek.
He stole Harry’s sweatpants and used a t-shirt. He still felt the shocks of pain throughout his body, almost making him buckle.
He knew it wasn’t pity. He knew Harry just wanted to help, but he was beyond reason. His tail kept flicking, showing his emotion and each twitch it did sent a new wave of pain up his spine.
Draco shook his head, the air moving and making Harry’s mouth water. He gulped, his Adam’s apple bobbing, and turned back to the berries. They didn’t look as appetizing now.
That didn’t make Harry feel better. “He got some news from a relative he hadn’t seen in awhile and it put him in a panic.”
He jolted at the feeling of a wand tip against his thigh but relaxed when after a spell, uttered by Draco, the pain went away. “You ARE out of it, Potter. Hit your head?” He tried to sound taunting, but Harry could hear the concern there.
Draco had explained his reasons to his mother on more occasions than he could measure and with his father he had repeated what he usually did. That there was no other he wanted and he would reject the others, so to give up.
“Neville, wait. Can...please don’t judge me, but...oh I can’t believe this...can you stay, like near the door or in the dorms? I...” he wasn’t sure how to finish it without sounding like a child.
The light from the hallway obscured the man’s form, but his scarlet eyes glowed in the limited light there was.
Draco choked. He began to laugh again, more so in relieved hysterics. “I...I’m not a Malfoy anymore! I-Harry I...I threw away that name. I’m not a Malfoy anymore and I told it to my-to Lucious’ face! Oh Salazar, what have I done? I can’t ever go back. I just disowned myself. I’m going to have to talk to the headmaster about living here. I have nowhere else. I was just so mad at him and-“
Harry’s eyes stayed not to subtly on Draco as the blonde approached Luna Lovegood. The other Ravenclaws looked surprised, as did many others. At first they must’ve thought it was to pick a fight, but Luna had jumped up happily and hugged him!
Draco was still processing why he was in that state for that long. Maybe he should. The last doctor, not counting Madame Pomphrey, was the Malfoy doctor when he was 15. He didn’t want to go, but he probably should.
Hermoine sighed, putting her fingertips to her head. “Both of you wouldn’t know, but long tails are sensitive. Most of the time we can’t control them either, since they react with what we’re feeling. He had considerable restraint though. I know your grip Ginny and you weren’t going easy.” Hermoine glared.
The tears still streamed down Draco’s face. He shakily loosened the Gryffindor scarf, revealing bandages on his neck.
The coroner arrived and they had no choice but to leave it and report it as it was seen. It didn’t sit well with Harry and when he glanced at Ron, he looked unsettled as well.
Feeling sick, Draco obeyed. He didn’t even have his wand, deciding to leave it behind in hopes Rose or Albus was smart enough to use it, or hope…no. He couldn’t allow Harry to find him if he was near Tom. Draco would have to think. He had to keep an eye on Tom or distract him so his family would stay safe. Maybe Harry would move to make sure Albus stayed safe?
Draco hated how real the dream felt. He figured it was just memories. Memories mixed in so it added to the level of reality.
He truly didn’t get his mate sometimes. Sadly, he wasn’t sure if that was because Draco was an enigma or if it was just a mate thing.
“You know, I do wonder what a bear/cat would look like?” He said loud enough. Mostly everyone got it and he was hugged by Neville, who was already tearing up in happiness, and Hermoine who was delightfully saying how happy she was for them.
Harry’s grip tightened as his heart clenched. He grit his teeth. Harry had to breath through his nose, taking deep breaths. Draco hadn’t used his first name since back then. “Why would it be easier?”
He walked towards the door, Harry knowing he couldn’t say no. He knew he made Sirius pissed, but he also knew his Dad well enough he wouldn’t give him a lecture on it. Must be something else. Either way, Harry’s gut wasn’t happy, if the constant pain was anything.
“Something like that. I’m sorry.” Draco whispered. ‘Nicely played, you sick fuck.’ He thought towards Riddle.
It was the night before the trip and Draco was nervous. Not because of the talk. He came to terms his over thinking was just added stress he bundled together. He’d deal with Harry, then he’d deal with what to do about his family, whether that meant staying until he could leave, or risking whatever outside.
He side glanced when a nicely dressed woman sat beside him. She sat rigidly and nervously tapped her foot. Brown bat wings were held tightly to her back.
“Your Dad was one of the first on the scene that night. Sir-“ he began but was cut off as Sirius came up the stairs.
“He’s...alright, I suppose. I slipped a muscle relaxer in his tea to help with the muscles constricting around the tail and it must have made him pass out. He called your Dad an idiot.” His Pop said, going to sit on the seat opposite Draco. He was laughing, thinking what Draco said was funny.
“Hmm...do you have a mate-or partner, by chance?” The doctor asked as she stared at the picture. She was a lemur.
“Astoria. Stay.” His voice shook. He could feel the hunger. The malicious intent running off him. They turned their attentions to the clacking of heels as Draco’s aunt came in, waving around a wand loosely.
He zoned out at the breakfast table as some Slytherins talked about their parents wedding rings, how they used a ruby. He’s not sure why that thought stuck.
“Don’t rightly know, Mr. Potter. I sent a letter to his family when he arrived, since I wasn’t sure the cause after you and Professor Lupin explained. Then with a messenger hawk, not owl, they had sent this. I assumed it might have been from his family’s doctor. It seemed to work though. Now...you probably have much to do as well, wasting your time here. I better not see you here much this year, Mr. Potter.”
He grabbed the heavy luggage, though he held it like it weighed nothing and pushed it out the cubby. “I’m bringing these to him. He might need something.”
Madame Pomphrey had splinted his tail, until she could have a moment to use an x-ray spell, she gave him something in an IV for inflammation, but decided to surround Draco’s body in ice, he was still in his button up and grey pants, no one able to remove them without possibly hurting his tail., to see if his temperature would go down on its own. When it came to medicine she liked to stay away from spells as best she could.
When they made it and snuck inside, ending up where they’d have to part, Draco got a glint in his eyes and looked around, trying to spot or hear anyone.
Without moving his mouth away too much, Harry spoke against his skin. “Don’t worry. I’m just letting you know that it’s okay.”
They weren’t able to reverse it. They tried after Draco’s fever fit that occurred a while after the doctor visit. Harry had wanted to avoid putting Draco in pain. They had decided to put a fund away anyway, in case they could conceive and it got far. They’d rather be a bit prepared as opposed to thrown out of left field.
Harry didn’t smile or scoff. “Draco, love. You’ve been in and out of that fever for almost a month. I had to give you painkillers just to make you sleep, remember?”
In the moonlight, Harry couldn’t help but admire a sleeping Draco. He lightly traced the silver scar on the back of Draco’s neck.
Draco’s face had grown more and more confused and desperate by the time Neville was done explaining. “Friends? Why would you want to be my friend?” His voice was quiet.
Harry must’ve noticed he was back on the ground because he was trying to dodge the branches to get out, instead of in.
“Harry, is Professor Lupin your Pop?” Draco asked sweetly. He’d rather be safe than sorry, but he was sure.
“I met a nice woman today. I also made progress with the Weasl-Ginny. We actually made the soup together.”
“M-Myrtle? S-sweet miss Myrtle?” He called out. He knew if you buttered her up, she was more friendly.
He looked and saw his friends and even though the group that loved him was small, he wouldn’t have it any other way.
Draco looked him in the eye, his not guarded or angry. “Thank you. Our dancing and you just...acting like an idiot...was a great birthday gift. Even if...it ended badly.”
He sighed, beginning to take out a book to get his mind off the memory and to kill time when the door to his little cubby opened. No one had dared to come sit near him, but his breath caught when he saw a mop of messy black hair, with round ears and skin tanner than his own.
Harry felt a warmth blossom in his chest. “I don’t know. But what does that matter if that’s what you’re feeling? We never did decide what his last name would be.” He used his thumb to wipe away Draco’s tears, knowing he wouldn’t want anyone to see him like that.
His ears twitched around. Neville and the Slytherin he brought with had gotten Draco’s things earlier that morning. Harry knew he had bags under his eyes. He’d been so worried for Draco, but unable to follow, he didn’t get any sleep.
Pup wasn’t dead, as he’d feared. If he was, he wouldn’t feel the pull or he would’ve known it before and his body would’ve accepted another or went into a type of shock.
He ran as fast and agile as he could, which was oddly a tough time, he almost twisted his ankle a couple times.
“Good boy. Let’s see how your mate appreciates your work.” Tom growled against Draco’s ear, though he processed, Draco couldn’t move from where his knees buckled.
Sirius taking a look at Draco’s neck sent a panic in his veins and now since Sirius wouldn’t even tell him why he looked...the wrench in his gut got heavier. “Sirius. Why did you look at his neck?”
Draco hummed, very pointedly NOT looking at Harry. “We’ll let you test it once I ask if you can go over.”
He startled, feeling Draco grab his hand and signal with his head that they should find a spot, not saying a word.
It was in an alleyway near a park. A white sheet lay over the body until the coroner could get there as other Wizards were there to search for clues using forensics.
Harry knew Draco would break soon. He tried looking right at Draco’s eyes, hoping that’s where he really was focused on. “It’s really hard to look at your eyes when you’re blurry, Malfoy.” Harry chuckled lightly.
Something seemed to break and Draco tried curling in on himself. “I-I-I thought you hated me after I left! I couldn’t tell you my family was keeping tabs so I couldn’t...oh, Harry, I wanted to tell you! Then you got friendly with the Weaslette and I knew she liked you! I didn’t know what to do so I just stayed away! Then you just seemed fine like I didn’t just-“ he stopped, having realized the tangent he was on. He bit his lip and turned away, breathing deep through his nose, trying to calm down.
The door slid open and Professor Lupin poked his head in and paused seeing the scene in front of him.
He sighed, walking next to Ron and Hermoine. Ron had been more distant, probably due to the Ginny situation.
His parents ate as if everything was normal, which for them, Draco had no doubt it was. Astoria and Scorpius didn’t eat, at least not much, Astoria had picked at bits to appease Tom, but didn’t allow Scorpius to.
Taking a deep breath, he scanned around, proud of everything. There were secret spells and charms cast around as well. Harry was out with Albus and they were visiting Padpa and Moonpa.
“That’s...odd. I just gave him a low dose, over the counter muscle relaxer. I wouldn’t think his body would be that effected by it.”
He was cut off by the sudden bawls of Rose from outside the door, the adults running to check, instincts on alert once they got their bodies moving again.
He tried nuzzling gently, rubbing the tip of his nose back and forth against the under part of Draco’s jaw. He tried apologizing that way.
Harry jolted, seeing Remus at the door. He put his hand on his chest, taking a breath. “You scared me. My mom did? Why?” It was odd. Remus and Sirius never really talked about his parents. Ever. He also just never asked. He heard what he did and he knew what had happened.
They decided since Draco’s parents weren’t there yet, they’d meet up and see Harry’s. Draco had yet to meet “Dad”, though he wished Professor Lupin could’ve met him on better terms than “a student with a Claim that needs help”.
Harry smiled so hard he swore his lips would split. “You know I wouldn’t do that. I did early on, but enough scars littering my body meant I got it.”
She laughed into her hand. “Why’s that? Oh, I’m not laughing at the family thing, I’m laughing at your out of nowhere blush. Which I understand is rude.”
The family doctor was never gentle when examining or trying to figure out why it had started and why that year.
Hours later, Harry was on his lunch, taking a stroll around, he was sitting too long anyway, in that office. He startled when he heard his phone go off.
Draco was only a bit aware he was rambling. But Harry, ever so patient, let him ramble. Oh, he hated it.
Harry knew he was being petty. But then he saw the blush get darker, the tears sliding down Draco’s face. “Y-you still...but I thought...”
Draco felt a cold iron like heat of anger boil in his belly along with relief that Harry though of him as everyone else did of his family.
Two thin red streams of red smoke was surrounding Draco’s neck, a bundle of magic moved like a nest of snakes on the back of it.
Harry sighed deeper. He always did fantasize what it would be like to reunite with that boy he Claimed.
Harry spoke first, to make the reason clear. “Ginny has something to say about yesterday. Go on, Ginny.”
His breath caught as Draco leaned over his shoulder, arms behind his back. He was so close, Harry could only smell him and it stirred something in his veins, effecting his impulse.
Draco blushed and clawed down Harry’s chest, feeling the muscles quiver underneath. “Oh, please. It makes you feel stronger. Being able to lift me so easy. You couldn’t do it long though-Ah.”
Draco made a surprised noise, before after a moment of Harry holding it, Draco made a desperate noise in the back of his throat, clutching his own hands against Harry’s and tried moving closer.
Draco’s voice hitched at the end and Harry reached his hands up, cupping Draco’s wet cheeks and pulling himself up to try his best to nuzzle Draco’s face.
He couldn’t. “Pup” was a nobody. “Pup” was a kid with big ideas and endless energy who thought he could do things and made promises he couldn’t keep.
“Draco. You’re going to have to talk to me. Was it a nightmare?” Harry whispered, trying to comfort him.
Draco scoffed and his tail flicked about nervously. “Not a Malfoy anymore, remember, Ginny? And of course I’m using your name, I’m trying...” he took a breath. “I’m trying to be civil with you. Not for your sake, but the other’s we share affection for.”

Harry saw Draco reach up, like to gently push him aside. Harry had realized too late that he was blocking Draco’s way.
“Hey, Malfoy. Wanna look around? I think there’s some small shops around. Maybe find something new?” He asked, getting the blondes attention.
Draco had flinched, fear crossing his eyes for but a moment, but it was enough for Harry to see. Concern clenched his gut, so instead of continuing, he quietly-as quiet as he could-got closer, letting Draco see his arms trying to encircle his body.
Not going in too deep with the family genetic thing of the canon HP universe. Also, totally unclear how hospital protocol is with this kind of thing.
Harry nodded, mostly to keep from whatever his mouth would have said or done. His emotions were on high drive and all he wanted was to see Draco and their baby, Albus, for himself to see if they really were alright.
Suddenly being in Harry’s arms, held up against him by strong arms then his hot breath and rough lips against his sensitive neck, had heat flare through his body, suddenly dizzy, and he knew he was blushing.
He shrugged his shoulders. There was a lot, and he wasn’t sure what he wanted to say. He saw Lupin stand and crouch in front of him, he smiled gently, one that reminded Draco of Pup, and he pet Draco’s head.
About a week ago, Draco had collapsed during work with abdomen pain and a high fever. Sirius was the only one home, since Remus was at Hogwarts for the week, having a professors meeting before the school year would start. Then, Harry was at work, investigating something a town over. He’d taken and stayed with Draco at the hospital while they figured out what had happened or if it was a little fluke with his yearly fevers.
‘Oh...yeah. I was in the library.’ He thought, the spring sun warming his back. A chill ran down his spine, the memory from his dream still fresh.
He gazed lovingly at Draco’s belly. It was swollen and they used a secret door for the entry into the nursery. That was Draco’s idea. Very few knew how to get in. Mostly Remus, Sirius, and Hermoine.
Looking at Draco, he looked like he was going to say something, his face in an expression Harry rarely saw. It looked like fondness, but that wasn’t right, when Ginny’s wand tip was at Draco’s throat, under the side of his jaw.
Draco’s brain was quickly turning into mush the more Harry teased and kissed, one large hand gripping Draco’s thigh and the other under Draco’s shirt, sliding up.
The nickname gave Draco an idea. “What about ‘Padpa’ for you and ‘Moonpa’ for Remus? That is...IF it’s a success.”
“Call me Draco, from now on. Luna already does.” He laughed at seeing the normally slightly drooped ears perk and Neville smiled wide.
Draco went over and placed the food in front of them. He glared at Blaise. “Hardy har, Zabini. You’re a right on psychic. Honestly I don’t know what Longbottom here sees in you. Here. Have at it. I’m not hungry.”
Harry looked down to his belt as he felt Draco’s hands there, then his wand, Draco having put it there so he probably wouldn’t lose it. Harry reached and grabbed his wrist, causing Draco to jolt violently in surprise. Harry noted how thin and bony it was. If it were a physical fight, Harry would’ve worried more if he’d broken something in Draco. He didn’t think Draco was ever that thin.
Harry’s brows shot up in shock. “Y-your birthday? Yesterday? Why-why didn’t-“ Harry was short circuiting. He had no idea! His heart clenched. The mate side of him was both happy at the information and devastated he didn’t know and didn’t do anything for him.
But...he was also nervous. You can’t really dive head first into something like this, or at least unlike a lot of things Harry dove head first into.
Harry must’ve known as well because he moved his face a bit away as Draco went to hiss at him too. He didn’t need Harry’s heroism complex right then!
Draco’s heart hammered in his chest even as it constricted with anxiety. He was forced to sit to Tom’s right, between Tom and his father. There was a tense silence. One that his mother broke.
Harry startled when he felt Draco pat his cheek. Not slap him, he just...patted his cheek. Harry whined in his head, wanting to lean into it and keep Draco’s hand there, but Draco removed it.
Harry looked almost hurt. “What? No way. The great and proud Draco Malfoy, supporting a Gryffindor? What would the world think?”
“No, Harry James Potter. I’m not done. You let them hold you up to such high expectations because you are so frightened of being alone! Of being abandoned by all these strangers, you don’t know what to do with yourself! So, you fight and fight and let people walk over you. You get into unnecessary danger because you can’t! Say! No! Because for some reason, the people you have isn’t enough! It drives me crazy!”
It seemed like a normal dinner. Both his parents were acting normal, his father still speaking about suitors and if Draco would just compromise with him. Even his mother had tried speaking with him about how they’d tried being understanding by allowing him to keep the “old Claim” mark as long as they did.
If he waited, yes it’s be more personal, but then their friends would not leave them be if they heard after. “Wish me luck.” He told Sirius.
Draco stopped. “It’s not a Claim induced infatuation. I’ve loved Harry for years. It’s not just me being stubborn.”
“We don’t know, Uncle Harry. We was playing and Uncle Draco told us to be careful but when we looked after showing him we could jump from up high and be okay, he was gone. We even tried to see if he turned invisible to prank us, but…”
Ron reached a gloved hand out and with a grimace of his own, he turned the arm, revealing the tattoo that some of the victims had. It was a skull with a snake coming out of its mouth and twisting.
It took Albus a moment, everyone inside in an instant and the children being inspected for magic and wounds. The only ones being seen were no doubt from playing.
She sighed, having decided quickly to give up. A good choice since he was a stubborn bastard. Harry would’ve fought him till next week. “Just checking if I am. How did you know?”
Plus, he’d be worried if he was her too. Draco was many things and sometimes forgiveness came with a hefty price in his eyes.
Everyone started to pour in soon after. Draco helped how he could, mainly wanting to learn a few dishes Harry liked to surprise him.
Draco’s voice was calm, a simmering fury beneath it. His hands trembled and he tried getting them under control.
He had became startled because Draco held a concerned look in his eyes. He didn’t expect Draco to grasp his hand with both his shaking ones and without a word, pull him away. Not to class, but a bit outside, behind the main doors.
Draco seemed to think on it. He continued to caress and mess with Albus’ hair, ears, face, almost like he was resisting something more instinctual.
Though confused, Harry complied. He had his wand in his pocket, but he’d forgotten it was there. Draco watched him use his hands to put the spell up, the magic moving into the air from his fingertips. The air around them felt shifted.
His head shot up when he heard the Headmaster begin to speak. As Dumbledore said his usual good mornings, Draco had half a mind to zone it out. He wanted to claw at his mark. He needed reassurance from it.
Afterwards, he realized he looked a bit different and it wasn’t because of his hair growth. He couldn’t pin it until he tried putting his pants on and they wouldn’t fit. His hips were wider. His thighs a bit thicker. You’d think being bed ridden for a month would make you lose weight. He truly didn’t remember the month.
“What makes you believe you can speak that way to me? In fact, you’ve done nothing but fight me.” Tom growled, until his eyes lit, causing Draco to squirm. “Perhaps we can remedy that.” He spoke lowly. “Eat.” He then released Draco’s jaw, no one daring to take a breath as they all knew one thing.
Harry’s brain was reeling. “Another…another Cat? When was this?” Harry whispered urgently. He felt he already knew, but needed Albus to confirm. “I know this is hard, bud, but it might help Da find Mom.” He rubbed Albus’ head.
He sighed. “Actually, Ginny, we’re going over to D-Malfoy- so you can apologize to him.” He knew if he just sent her, Draco would probably hex her to America and back.
He hadn’t cried. All he could do was shake and not utter a word all night. Only the promise of getting away had him leaving far earlier than planned the next morning.
Draco got up as quickly as he could, knowing never to make him wait. Brushing his hair, everywhere was cold. It was a winter-like cold, where the home had no heater and the blankets felt they’d been outside too long. He slipped on clothes, but saw in the mirror, the back of his neck had the silver scars from where Harry healed him.
Draco didn’t seem to want to let go of Albus, so he tilted his head up, Harry leaning his down, but instead of a kiss, Draco rubbed his wet, tear stained cheek against Harry’s. “I won’t use this against you if you don’t.”
“Harry himself. So...care to tell me, what’s going through your head? Your friends are worried, you’ve been quiet and stand off.” Lupin sat on the edge of Draco’s bed, the other not minding.
Draco looked away. “I know you’d understand a lot, Harry. Just...just trust me when I say I’m petrified to tell you.”
Draco looked at him wide eyed, like he hadn’t meant to say it. “I...I didn’t...don’t think too much on it.”
The one who Claimed him was practically a ghost! There was no evidence he existed except for the bite on Draco’s neck and his memories.
His eyes flew to her. “No, no, no, nothing like that. Just got lost in memories. So...anything else you want to get off your chest while you have me here?” He asked, a smirk on his lips.
Narcissa looked like Draco had slapped her. Maybe to a Cat species it was. She didn’t turn her head, looking straight on. “Both, in a way. I had hoped I found you before your aunt. But then THIS?! Draco, do you realize the danger you-“
Albus nodded, shaking his head to try and calm down. He refused to release Draco’s wand and Harry let him hold it. As Albus eventually nodded off, Harry was at his limits of patience. He had to find Draco. He wouldn’t lose him again and something didn’t sit right with Harry about the whole thing.
Harry kissed his sternum outside his shirt. “If we’re bringing back our past, then...” he lowered Draco by lowering his arms, bringing his hot breath to Draco’s ear, making it twitch and him groan, “...why don’t I see if I can Claim you without Claiming you?”
To stop from breaking into a fresh bout of tears, Draco looked down. “Hey, rotten one. If you remember this, don’t you use your parents crying to your advantage. Or at least not without incentive.” He risked lifting one arm to use his finger to pet Albus’ head, from forehead down to his nose.
Harry nosed Draco’s neck, the began giving him a mix of feather light and pecks of kisses against the scars and even where neck met shoulder, where he could get to at least..
After a few minutes of chatting with Hermoine, as he picked at the small roast he’d made the previous night, they got the okay to both send him over and try Draco’s Floo idea.
He lost sight of Draco a few times, but followed his scent. As a kid, he didn’t lie. He did like Draco’s scent. He shook his head. He couldn’t get lost in his memories.
Harry took a deep breath. “It’s a lot like that morning...isn’t it? Except, instead of watching the sunrise, it’s turning dusk.”
“I’m not trying to be dumb, ferret, but what is this?” Harry asked and Draco snorted, actually smiling, but he kept his arm over his eyes.
When he returned, Draco’s ears were back against his skull, tail flicking. “Give me your wand. If you’re insisting on being here, give me your wand, mother.”
He breathed deep through his nose. The birthday memory the year prior with Harry brought not as much pain. He focused on that.
Lupin smiled fondly. “Just remember why you’re throwing away your self preservation. It’ll be fine. I think he’s more understanding than you give him credit for. Well, before your house Professors see me, I’ll be off. Just remember, Draco.” He stopped before opening the door. “Do what will make you happy.”
A woman walking alone, looking lost was odd enough. She was a Cat, normal, most felines were diurnal, but she obviously wasn’t used to the area, judging by her looking.
Harry’s breath caught and he knew he was blushing. Since when did he become weak to this beautiful creature?!
Draco liked to act like he was better, and that’s what Harry thought he turned out to be at first. But then he saw Draco getting along with Neville, someone everyone either ignored, didn’t take seriously, or thought as weak. Then Harry saw Luna Lovegood chatting with Draco as well and he caught once, ever since, Draco wearing something she made for him. It was under his robes, but he still wore it.
Draco snorted in amusement, running his claws through Harry’s hair and scratching his scalp, one hand traveling lower to claw upwards from his shoulder blades, the moan and accompanied blush from Harry lit his eyes with a deep green.
But...unlike Neville, who with his sweet personality to all and meek behavior, along with his odd friendship with Draco, there was no way for Harry to get to the Slytherin dorms and he shared no classes with Draco, so he couldn’t find him.
Draco seemed to not know how to react. He held his arms out and Harry made sure he knew how to hold him. Really, Draco had held Rose but their Albus was a newborn.
His ears stood to attention and his tail flicked. He looked over and smiled. “Fingers crossed. For both of us.” He crossed both hands, a gesture he’d seen Hermoine use.
Harry leaned a bit over his shoulder and kissed his cheek, grabbing his glasses. “I just wanted a kiss, My sly Slytherin.”
Harry wasn’t sure if Draco was even aware, since what he saw of the silver eyes were dazed, he had let a couple tears fall as he drifted back to sleep.
Harry honestly wasn’t sure how Draco knew. He laughed and kissed Draco’s head. “Sorry, go back to sleep.”
Harry sighed, seeing the sun rising. He gripped his hair, ears against his head. Why did Draco have to be so prickly! What happened through the years between the Claim and seeing him again that made Draco so guarded?
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and sighed, feeling and hearing the purr emanating from Draco’s chest, making him smile. He didn’t bother telling Draco to stop. His heart swelled as he drifted back to sleep, even in the uncomfortable position and the sound of Draco’s and their child’s heartbeats in his ears.
Upon getting on his bed, he rolled himself in the thick fluffy comforter. Here. Here is one place he can be whoever, whatever, doesn’t have to be proper or anything. He didn’t feel like crying anymore, but he did look at the now dried blood on his hands. A strange feeling went through him.
Neville looked. “Will you make sure to ask Ha-Potter if he went to see Madame Pomphrey? Please. And...thank you.”
Harry’s hands were clenching and unclenching at his sides. He so badly wanted to hold him. It was getting harder to resist each year.
He pulled away, realizing Harry had locked his hands around Draco’s waist. He nipped Harry’s lips, causing Harry to blush.
From what Harry could see, now that he was paying attention, Draco also put plenty of charms along the walls and windows. He wanted to be sure no one got to their kid. That was one reason why he came up. Draco wouldn’t leave the children. “Hm?” He spotted some open notebooks, full of Draco’s handwriting and sketches. It only took him a second to realize that they were spells. They had been teaching Albus early. Albus had shown traits of using magic like Harry, so unlike Sirius and Remus, they decided to try and control it in some way at an early age.
She had hurried over to Draco, tutting about and he saw she was removing the bags of water that was once ice, and using her wand to bring more baggies of ice over.
Harry wasn’t sure why Draco was reacting this way. Something about what his mother said had frightened him. He looked to her, his green eyes blazing. “Why is he doing that?”
Harry shook his head, trying to think. “No. Have you guys heard from Draco recently? We can’t find him…but I can’t just blindly run around and waste time.” He glared at nothing, crossing his arms tighter around his chest. “I feel like I am wasting time anyway just standing here.”
It began to get to the time where they all had to head back, so, Harry knew he had to speak with Draco before then.
The least he could do, was be the best Slytherin his family had ever seen, to make up for his abnormalities and his claim from someone he couldn’t even show existed.
Harry didn’t at first. He caressed Draco’s face, rubbing his cheeks with his thumbs and massaging his face. It was making Draco sleepy. “You’ve been off for awhile. Not just tonight. As mates we have to communicate.”
Draco could only nod. Truthfully the only one he wanted there was Harry. He wasn’t even sure why except his voice, or the tone, helped sooth in some way.
He laughed lightly, his anxiety being forgotten in the moment of being in his love’s arms. “I’d like to see you try, Potter.”
He immediately put a binding charm on the child, causing Draco and Astoria to yell. “Scorpius!” She cried, but Draco yelled after her.
Harry halted her short by gripping her wand on the space between Draco’s neck and Ginny’s hand. Ginny whimpered at the look he was giving her.
“Mate, go for a walk. Your sighing is waking me up.” He heard Ron say, the Capybara becoming annoyed.
He might’ve been, actually, if he thought about it. Ever since the summer he was 11, before starting his first year at Hogwarts, his body had been going through the fever fits. Usually he was awake, writhing in pain and heat from fever. He’d scream and scream till his he couldn’t speak for a week due to a raw throat, even with potions.
“Ma’am? Can I help you get somewhere?” He didn’t get too close to ask or dare touch her. He knew from experience spooked Cats are not to be messed with.
Harry and Ron had split up at the scene, which was quite a gruesome one. Harry scrunched his nose at the scent of blood.
He scooted more against the window, almost flush to it. His knees were still up against his chest and his tail was wrapped tightly against his legs. He tried making his head lower, making his neck harder to get to.
Draco walked out, hearing Albus excitedly tell Harry how great it was but then asking what he did to deserve it. Incentive.
Draco tried, he took deep breaths but after a few of them, tears welled in his eyes and the deep breathing didn’t work.
Sirius got tears in his eyes but he smiled still. “I love it. I’ll run it by Moony in a bit. But you know, it will be. I know you and I know Harry. You both are stubborn to a fault so you both will work to make sure it grows and you’ll find a way.”
Draco began to laugh. It wasn’t the lighthearted laugh of joy he’d shared with his friends and Harry. “What are you going to do? Force Claim me to some toxic, manipulative bitch? Someone who just wants the benefits to my price? You and mother can go fuck Hippogryphs!,” Draco grasped his father’s wand, similar to Harry with Ginny’s, “I am DONE being a Malfoy! No more! I will find a new last name but till then I am Draco! Burn my things back at that lonely, cold mansion! Everything I need or want is here! I am no longer your child so you both can leave this castle.”
Harry hummed but his mind was far behind in a memory. When they were kids, no napkins or anything and Harry was a much messier eater (thanks Dad) back then.
“Draco, darling, calm down. If you don’t, you could-“ Narcissa began, she now revealing her genuine concern.
“I’m his mother. Narcissa Malfoy. I’ll understand if you won’t allow me to see him.” She spoke very properly. Very precise in her speech.
Draco looked over. He felt his heart clench. “Just...why do you guys accept me? I crossed out Harry’s mark. You don’t have to like me anymore.”
“Well, judging by your answer, you do know him. I can...understand, I suppose. I also am aware it’s odd to be out this time of early morning.” She sighed. “I was just hoping to check on him.”
“Sounds about right. You get that from me. Never had much patience when it came to those insulting your Dad. I suppose you’re lucky you didn’t do something. Anyhow, how’re you feeling, Harry?”
He got up off Harry as quick as he could, trying not to breathe quickly and stalked over, up onto the hill, waiting till he saw Harry move and get up.
That sounded like Draco’s mother. Why would Draco’s mother be at their place again? Maybe his Pop was right. The Malfoy clan had to know or be in on it somehow. He had to work his way up. Or…go back to when Draco was a Malfoy. Maybe Pansy and Blaise knew something? Harry growled in his throat. He wasn’t sure where Blaise and Neville were anymore, living wise, and Pansy was a hard woman to get a moment to speak with. Harry sighed, hugging Albus closer, his-no-their child, hugging him just as hard.
He turned his head and saw Draco’s eyes blown wide. He opened and closed his mouth over and over. Harry took off his glasses and moved his bangs a bit so Draco could see the many shades of green in his eyes.
He looked at his rough, scarred hands. Draco’s were so small in his. Long and elegant. Draco let him kiss his hand.
He was never gentle every year, poking too hard or outright ignoring Draco’s words of protest or what was happening. It got so bad, last year he tried to be as silent as he could, until a maid came to check on him and his parents gave him the “medicine”.
“Here, in case you need someone to vent with. I’d also like to know if you are pregnant or not. As long as you don’t try and drag me back to that way of life.” He tried to joke.
Lupin sighed, then hummed, but he continued to smile. “I think it might be a mix of things. But maybe you’ve found someone else, or what you thought you needed from your mate has changed with time. It could just be basic instincts. More importantly, though, Draco...what do you want it to be?”
Wait. Correction, it was the little Weaslette that made him pissed more than anything. The way she chased and clung to Potter, the way she acted like a lost puppy always getting under foot. Oh, don’t get him wrong, he wasn’t jealous. He was just...
He heard. He listened and processed all that information. His body began to shake. He wasn’t even sure what caused it. Maybe stress? “I-uhm...don’t see an area for a child to...so what’s the use in...”
“If you had to choose me or Albus...Like if it was an emergency, which would you choose?” Draco asked.
His Pop would be excited. He was too, they’d get to see Dad everyday. They’d do what married mates did.
A few hours later had Ron winning the final score and Harry buying them dessert, Ron’s favorite for him winning. It wasn’t quite nightfall when Hermione and Luna returned. Harry hoped she’d be staying awhile, he knew Draco wanted to thank her for the exotic meats.
Before Harry could reply with a “you’re welcome”, the train whistled and Draco waved, leaving to a different part of the train as Harry boarded as well.
“Alright. There’s something very important I wanted to talk to you about too. Something I should’ve had the Gryffindor courage to say.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
He wasn’t just relieved because his little...test...worked. It working was a great step to protecting his baby and his mate.
He didn’t even see Ron, Hermoine, and Ginny see him running past with an unconscious Draco, running towards the school infirmary, ignoring everyone who saw him.
Riddle stood again. He bent near Draco’s ear, hand hovering somewhere. Draco didn’t move. He was scared to.
Luna gave him a concerned look. “Harry. I’ve never sent Draco meat. Even with a chilling charm, they’d go bad from where I’ve been. You sure it was from me?” Even Luna tried remembering.
Harry and Albus spoke with Hermione and Ron some before they left, the world around them acting as if nothing was wrong.
Draco wasn’t the only one thinking so because next thing he knew, the Weasley gave him a look of disgust.
Astoria had been confused, but Draco had a feeling he was piecing together what Tom wanted. Draco hoped he was wrong. “Survival of the fittest. That malnourished bat is of no use. Put him out of his misery.”
Harry remembered what he’d said because he remembered Draco hiking his shoulder to his jaw, defensive, a way to protect his neck from someone.
He walked over, bending down as Albus steadied his over night pack. Draco purred and kissed his cheeks over and over. Albus giggled before making grossed out noises.
Grabbing a glove as well, he grasped the letter, pulling it up. There was no envelope, but the paper was older, yellowed, and had torn edges.
Draco’s lip wobbled. He hadn’t even known Harry wanted to know. He tried burying away that part of him because he was ashamed of it. “I know. I never planned that.”
Only when he looked down did he see how utterly gross he felt and looked. He hadn’t to have bathed at least in a day or two, depending on the time.
“Kissing you. I still remember you’d pull me off down corridors to kiss me.” Harry laughed, smiling back.
Harry opened his mouth to apologize himself, for being in the way, when Draco moved the hand from his bicep to his lips.
“Seems to be going well, Mr. Black-Lupin. From where I can see at least, it’s growing from the last pictures and it’s moving. Not much growth, but I don’t usually have patients come in so early on.” She said as she began putting the things away.
Draco almost collapsed onto his knees, but instead, he needed Harry. He was about to breakdown. He knew it.
It scared him how fuzzy his memory of what Pup looked like, was becoming. He sighed. He had things to weigh out.
His ears picked up Draco making noise and he hurried over, thinking he was waking. Draco wasn’t, but his body was twitching, that was more than earlier, and he seemed to be whining out. He wished he could kiss the pain lines in his brows away.
Harry ran over the short distance, panicked himself, though he didn’t show it., his heart hammering like he almost got hit with a bludger.
Then, he did what he wanted to earlier. Against the side Ginny’s wand had been, Harry placed his nose.
Because of Draco’s forgetfulness, pushing away and locking the memories with a key,  he’d put the two most important beings in his life in danger.
He was blushing and elated. He couldn’t stifle the grin even as he kissed Draco. So it wasn’t much of an actual kiss.
He took a shuddering breath. Anymore and he knew he’d break. Professor Lupin’s phone went off. He ignored it, feeling Draco’s needs were more urgent. But the person kept calling.
“It means, I know you. I know more about you than everyone so I can see past your-your- facade!” Draco threw his hands up, but he wasn’t done. He never was.
Draco shrugged, sitting up as well and crowded near Harry’s ear, causing him to blush. Draco spoke in a whisper, his breath ghosting Harry’s ear.
They did remind him of himself and Harry. Maybe it was the colors or that he knew how gorgeous they’d be once polished.
He watched as Draco processed it. The furrow and raise of his brows, his lip quivering, the little squeaks and squawks.
He knew they both must be nervous wrecks, judging by Draco’s jittery actions. They went around different places, mostly looking around, relaxing after the initial stress and Harry caught Draco actually enjoying himself.
He saw Harry’s hand in front of his face, it reaching to cup his jaw and pull Draco’s head towards him.
“I know so because Harry hates you and now he wants me to apologize to you?! I admit you were right. I’d NEVER apologize truthfully to you. You’ve tormented my brother and I and belittled us Weasleys. You made fun of Hermoine. Not to mention you’ve hurt Harry so many times so-“
He stopped to a halt. There was a woman ahead of him a few yards, once he was dropped off as close as the bus could get.
Neither knew what to say, so there was silence. Until he heard Rose making noise and decided to check on her. “I’ll check.”
“Talking is a lot less destructive, you know.” Harry said as he and Draco lay sprawled next to each other in the grass, sun setting in the summer wind, both with their clothes in shambles with bruises and cuts, maybe a fracture or two. The area around them had small craters and dirt kicked up.
Saying he’d feel that way because of their history, of their animosity, didn’t feel right if he were to say it now.
“Potter. Looking for someone?” Harry’s ears perked and he turned so fast he almost twisted his ankle.
It said...it would bring Draco’s dignity back. That he would be “mature” enough to go through with it.
He was curled under the blankets, a habit he’s had for a long time. Usually under stress. The doctor had given him a copy of both, since he asked.
There was nothing but chaos until a hush swept the room when Astoria seemed to understand and lifted her wand shakily, her breath ragged as tears flowed from her face.
Part of him was relieved as he walked down the halls towards the Slytherin dorms. He held his arms to himself, knowing his arm was still bleeding but his body was wracked with cold.
He wondered who Harry’s adoptive parents were? He hoped they’d like him. Did they know of his past with Draco?
Harry hummed. Could’ve been. “We’ll find him. You know he can’t stay away long.” Harry tried reassuring him.
Draco knew he couldn’t stop smiling. Professor Lupin had been right. Harry would be understanding. He couldn’t believe he cried so much.
Harry was definitely confused. “Are you going to give me clues? Because Draco, love, if you don’t, I’d be naming thins for hours.”
“If he’s anything like ‘Mione, which he isn’t, but they’re both Cats…my point, Mate, is that they get antsy. When was the last time you two went off?” Ron asked, making his move, moving a pawn.
He wasn’t surprised when Draco hesitated. He gulped. There was some silence as neither knew what to do. There was so little and so much more.
Two years later and he still couldn’t get Potter to leave him alone completely, now he thought of it. Oh, they fought and often.
“Why?” He asked. He didn’t understand. They could’ve left his stuff. Could’ve let the Gryffindors destroy it. Find blackmail (there was none) or something.
That helped him decide to tell, but he was still on edge. “He’s a bear-type. Why is that important?”
“This...” he whispered, his arm over his eyes and placed his hand softly on top of where Harry’s was on his hips, “and on the other...picture.”
Harry’s eyes widened, eyebrows going to his hair. “Why’re you sorry? I’m the one who knew but never told you. I’m honestly surprised you haven’t scratched my face off yet.” He would’ve laughed, but Draco’s face held such remorse, Harry asked.
He knew in his birth parent’s time some purists began to eliminate his type. Some made it, but now they have to hide or disguise themselves. His birth parents were part of it, having been targeted, but that’s about all he knew.
Ron sat, tapping his foot and ignoring Harry’s comment on Draco plus dating. It made him ill. He really didn’t get what his wife and Harry saw in that ex-Malfoy. “Why’d you name him after our headmaster, anyway? I’d been meaning to ask.”
Draco nodded. If it was just to the store. And really, if he was going to be in the Weasley’s lives because of Hermoine and Harry, he’d have to get along at least civilly with her. He sighed. “That’s fine, Wea-Ginny. I’ll just hang around, if that’s alright with you? Where’s little Rose-Bud?”
Albus looked over and cocked his head. He wiggled his hips like if a tail was there. “When Da is gone long or if you don’t sleep together. Mom tries hiding it, but I worry.”
He’d have to tell Harry. Maybe he could reverse it or get rid of it since it was his magic that did it.
Lupin hummed. “I’m not pitying you, Draco. I’ve grown to like you these last couple years and I know this isn’t like you. Well...I also don’t know the state your tail is in either but I’m sure that’s not the only problem.”
Once Draco was out of earshot, Hermoine whistled. “Oh man Harry.” She giggled. “You have it bad. Your eyes are still dilated and he’s quite a bit aways now.”
Harry hadn’t been mad. He acted it, in front of the crowd they’d gathered, then a professor came and they separated.
Being with Draco all these years had taught Harry to at least observe before speaking, at least to some extent. She didn’t seem threatening. She didn’t even have a purse on her. No wand to be seen either, though that could’ve been hidden easily.
Lupin looked to him in question. He nodded to the phone. “You bantered but said you loved him anyway. It was...”
These...bad thoughts weren’t new either, they just have been building especially since Draco showed his true colors when they were 13.
Before he could pull his hands away, Harry gripped both Draco’s wrists in his hands. “You know I don’t hate you. I was...I was scared. I-“ he cut short, when his eyes landed on Draco’s, able to see clearly.
Ginny studied him for a moment. “I could...show you how to make mum’s soup she makes every summer. Or at least what I know. She hides away the real spices she uses that makes it special.” She rubbed her arm.
Harry paused to think. To get passed his own feelings and Draco’s brattish behavior. What had Draco DONE recently? He couldn’t rely on what he’d learned though. He didn’t know how long Draco had been having the nightmares. The Floo was new too. “He’d been having nightmares and he recently put a Floo in Albus’ room. He seemed…on edge when Albus tried it.”
“Would Mom still be here with us if I looked more like him?” Albus looked up, ears back and tears in his eyes.
“Draco, please. I would also like to...apologize to you for the aggression I’ve shown to your family. Mostly. Some of the aggression was warranted I promise.”
Draco felt very ashamed, though it wasn’t like he was flaunting the nightmares to his kid. Maybe he should start taking droughts to stay awake.
Professor Lupin just fixed him a grin. “Neville let me in and threatened Blaise who threatened the others. Didn’t realize how great it was having a person on the inside.” He chuckled.
He startled, feeling a rough hand gently rub against his cheek. He must’ve got lost in his head. When he looked to Harry again, there was that fond look again.
Draco could already feel the lump returning. Lupin had known about his Claim mark, not who did it and the like, but he was kind enough to be a shoulder and a person of wisdom for Draco. Draco would’ve never guessed how much he needed someone, a parental figure, like Lupin in his life.
A Slytherin. A Purebred. ‘Who do I know?’ Harry tried thinking as he soaked his fathers love up like he did as a child. He didn’t want to…but his thoughts went to his own child. Albus knew of Draco’s nightmares and unless that was the first breakdown, Harry had to wonder if Albus knew anything. Even just words or statements. “I’m going to Ron’s and ‘Mione’s, they have Albus. Draco wouldn’t want me leaving him long, and I’m missing him.” He released his fathers, then nodding.
People had been going missing. Some bears but also others as well. Some were even found with the same tattoo on their left forearm. Some would turn up dead and no one knew how, like the coroner couldn’t say. It also...wasn’t just adults going missing. No one in Harry’s department or even in stations across the city could guess. It had been going on for months and those found seemed to be in worse shape by the weeks. Harry sighed, kissing Draco’s shoulder as he saw him move. He pulled away a bit to see if Draco was still asleep.
“I’m not that young anymore, Moony. What’s the matter?” He got close, panting, not liking the look on his husband’s and son’s faces.
When he was allowed in, he forced himself not to run in. In a little bassinet, was Albus. He saw him first, since he was closest and he knew if Draco ever knew who he went to first, if it was Draco, he’d murder Harry for it.
He gulped. If he was going to do a full term, he’d have to learn. He grabbed what he knew she’d need, or hoped, everything.
He bent down enough to devour Harry’s lips, the rough, wet slide of it along with their tongues, intoxicating.
“You’re not trying because you ARE dumb, Potter.” He snarked. That got a deep chuckle from Harry, sending heat to Draco’s stomach.
Harry’s eyes widened. He blushed deeply, averting his eyes. “I was...I was waiting for you to. I wasn’t going to be selfish again, especially when it hurt you for so long.”
“If you insist on checking on me, then you can follow. I...I have to check something.” Draco said, still in his underwear.
He asked as he pulled away. He saw that dark look, and wondered how far into the house they’d get later.
Harry smiled fondly. “You mean so much more than a Claim, Draco. Silly ferret, you’re so much more. Here.” Harry had an idea and he took out the old earrings. Draco would have to pierce his ears or take the gem out and make something.
“I better get him home too. We’ll do what we can and let you know, alright, Harry?” Remus spoke, Sirius looking exhausted.
The purr got louder, biting Harry’s ear hard, Draco stretched an arm out to move one of Harry’s pieces. “That might give you a chance at winning.”
Harry quirked a brow and walked over, only in his pajama bottoms. “What’s this? X-rays?! Draco, did you break something?” Harry’s voice was alarmed but Draco put his hand up.
“Care to say what’s on your mind, Draco? Or stay quiet?” He drank some coffee from a thermos. His voice was calm, no scolding, no anger. Just concern and curiosity.
“Uh. Yeah. But, first. Why are you wearing a Gryffindor scarf?” Harry thought it adorable. Though he could feel something was off, Harry wasn’t sure what. Draco didn’t look in pain. He must just be tired.
Harry looked down, seeing the usually narrow hips were a bit wider. He tilted his head and ran his large scarred hands up Draco’s thighs, his palms flat against the front of his hips.
He turned, maybe too fast...or was it slow? ...and felt a wave of nausea hit. He ran to the sink and heaved. Nothing came up.
Harry pulled Draco’s wrist he was still holding and slowly, his own breath wavering, rubbed his cheek against the palm, causing Draco to jolt again.
After a few seconds for it to reach Draco’s veins, suddenly he gasped, jumping as far as he could up and ripping out the IV, the source of where the medicine was distributed.
He felt a tight grip on his tail as it was pulled from its spot next to his feet and pulled far, fast.
A few years ago, after a particularly bad night, one where they both were under a great deal of stress from jobs and high running emotions, Draco found out about the dead child and the missing people Harry had been trying to search for. Harry had broken into sobs after telling him, feeling he was a failure. He’d failed so many lives.
Then when he did...he swore that day on the train, Draco recognized him, maybe even was angry for not finding him sooner. But it became quickly apparent that Draco didn’t know who he was.
“-but Tom wasn’t seen nor heard from since, so we assumed he died that night because of your mother’s love and sacrifice.” Remus wrapped up, voice a bit raw, hands gently running through Sirius’ hair as the dog lay curled with his head on Remus’ lap.
Draco thought. Harry definitely hadn’t figured out the earring meaning. “Harry...do you know why I put that earring in your ear?”
“What you did wasn’t right, Ginny. His tail was damaged before and then you agitate it, or worse, by grabbing it. You think I’m going to be mad at him for lashing out in pain?”
“Uh...” he giggled lightly. The sound going right to Harry’s heart. Draco must’ve found out how to kill him and was acting it out. Draco bit his lip and in barely a whisper, Harry barely heard him as much as reading his lips. “Harry, you have berry juice on your face, so unless I have to make fun, I’d get rid of it.”
They both fixed him a long look until Mrs. Weasley came over closer and began poking him, prodding his torso, and clicking her tongue to the roof of her mouth. Draco looked to Harry in alarm and he saw not only Harry, but Mr. Weasley were snickering, Harry specifically having a happy look on his face.
Harry lifted him by his thighs, so Harry’s face came to his stomach. “You know I would. There’s no way I’m ever letting you go again.” His voice was serious but when Draco looked at him, his eyes sparkled that green that Draco saw when he first met Harry. The nap time green when laying under the trees. Harry smiled so wide his fangs were revealed and his eyes crinkled, making his glasses askew.
Sliding down his now closed door, putting his knees towards his chest, Draco sighed. His shoulders wouldn’t relax. He didn’t have much time.
All along stair cases were first years like himself and other years as well. Harry was chatting it up with Granger, Weasley, and some others. All of them gushing about him being “the boy who lived” over and over.
The ride there to the castle was long and all Draco could think, was he felt like he’d done something wrong.
Draco scrunched his brows. “No. A month? You sure?” He’d never had one that long. Maybe a bit more than a week at the beginning, but never that long.
Draco let out a scoff, but it was light, his own body relaxing as Harry’s stifled laughter was contagious. “I wouldn’t dare-“ a snort, holding back laughter as Harry began to shake with it, “-go to a Weasley. I’d rather be alone. He’d…he’d probably piss me off more.”
Draco scrunched his brows. Why couldn’t his parents have reacted this way? With relief and happiness?
“Harry. I...I need time. Please. Heh, and you know I never say please. Please don’t hate me for this.”
“Mom said not to tell you since it was unnecessary, but when Mom and I are out shopping, or taking walks, or talking with aunty Astoria and Scorp, he gets…” Albus then turned his head back and forth, “…Mom gets hit on. Aunty calls it “flirted with”, but Mom argues “it’s not since I’d rather die painfully than go after their generic, ugly mugs with morals so far out the window not even an Eagle could spot it.”, then he’ll look off dreamily and begin purring. I don’t know who it is, but Mom likes someone that’s not Da. He sometimes murmurs the name “Pup”, and when I ask he laughs and says it was his first love and to not tell you.” Albus then slurped down his milkshake from talking so much.
Draco startled, feeling Harry lift his shirt slightly and kiss his stomach, that fond, adoring look still on his face. Draco made a noise and Harry looked up. “I love you.”
He nodded. “As long as it’s going, I’ll feel decent.” Truthfully, he was petrified. He was so frightened of something going wrong. He took a deep breath and tried calming down.
Harry sighed, already feeling that anger build. “Not really. She said something about how he was looking at us. I didn’t speak much.” He went and sat by his Pop, who patted his back.
“You are no better, Draco. I was too lenient with you. So learn your place quickly.” His father hissed.
Getting to their house, he saw a light on. Though he realized, that didn’t mean much. He sighed, unlocking the door and walking in, having Draco’s mother in front of him, seeing if he could spot her wand anywhere.
Ginny looked almost shocked that Harry didn’t agree. “Why are you taking his side? He’s a Malfoy!” She was close to yelling and Harry knew something bad would happen if he didn’t get away.
Harry sighed. “Draco, no. Really I hadn’t thought of it because I thought it was impossible. More than the thought of a little one running around, I want you happy and not in pain from these fevers.”
Draco struggled but jerkily stood, not looking Harry in the eye. He stood tall, once his back was turned, head held high. The gesture alone, hurt Harry the most. He’d thought Draco outgrew it by learning he could trust Harry. “You’re not the only one with nightmares, Potter. I’ve done as you asked, in regards to your nightmares. So…please…” Draco turned his head as if he were to look at Harry, but seemed to think twice, “…let me save some dignity.”
Everything got livelier when Harry showed up, still in uniform but happy. He had come over and kissed Draco but then everyone wanted the birthday boy’s attention. Draco couldn’t blame them. He got Harry most of the time and sometimes he still felt like it wasn’t enough. Rarely was it too much, after all these years.
His father only sent a letter because it meant he was giving Draco a chance to find someone at Hogwarts first.
Harry pulled Draco’s head up and gave him a gentle kiss, one Draco melted into. His body began to relax, along with his adrenaline. “Calm down, Draco. All I got from that was you said you didn’t want to be a Malfoy?” He couldn’t believe it.
Sirius grunted. “The more I think on it, the less likely it is. And really, since Claiming was banned years and years ago, there isn’t much on it. Ugh, Moony was always better at this than me.”
“Then you can walk. Come, it’s dinner time and I know a few people who haven’t seen you in so long.” Tom waited, pointing for Draco to go first so he knew he wouldn’t run.
Draco squeaked as he was lifted into the air and twirled around by Harry, who was laughing happily. Harry set him down, but didn’t give him a chance to ask, when he gripped Draco’s head roughly in his hands and kissed him like he grabbed him. It was hard and rough but Harry let out a happy and pleased noise from his throat.
Draco turned, tilting his head so Harry could see. “If this is a game, Potter. I swear you will-“ he cut off when Harry kissed the back of his head.
To him, that meant they were both on a healing ground. He nodded. “I suppose. If it’s wretched, I can blame you.”
Harry pulled away to look into his eyes. Only when he blinked, did he realize he was crying. “Love, what’s going on?”
“What does that mean, Malfoy?” Harry crossed his arms. He had forgotten, and so quickly too, that they weren’t as close as they were. They weren’t “friends” nonetheless “mates”, despite the Claim saying otherwise, because...Draco didn’t know.
“How am I gonna make it up to him?” Harry thought, flopping back onto his bed. He had packed to let out more of his frustrations. He and Pop would take the train like everyone else, so maybe he could ask him then.
Draco blushed a bit but stuck his nose up. “Mine was dirty. Slytherin’s don’t share so my found sibling Neville let me borrow this. Not that I have to explain anything to you. I just don’t want you thinking because of...things that happened, I’ve went pro Gryffindor.”
Draco’s eyes slipped closed and he allowed himself to feel overpowered by the scent and taste of Harry’s lips on his. He deepened the kiss, wanting more and Harry growled in turn.
She looked over his blood results and everything again, along with the photo, of which he hadn’t seen yet. “What type are they? It’ll help me figure out why what’s happening, is happening.”
Though the battery life in it was dwindling and it was just...old. The machine was old. Maybe for their “anniversary “ he could get Harry a new one. He’d have to ask Sirius about it since it was a muggle contraption.
He knew technically Neville could be in there with him, but he appreciated it nonetheless. Blaise knew he was no threat but he doubted Neville, like himself, wanted many to see him naked.
‘Friends, he said. Did Draco Malfoy have friends?’ He thought back to who Draco Malfoy was. His gut clenched and he bent over the side, thinking he was going to heave again, but didn’t. The “medicine” might be wearing off.
He wasn’t sure how long he stayed under the covers. He missed Harry, but he was also scared. What if Harry thinks it’s freaky? Or is disgusted by what happened? He tried taking deep breaths.
Draco allowed it, unraveling his arms from around himself to wrap around Harry. “Bring me to our baby, Harry. I want to see my child.” His voice was soft.
The picture in his head, of loved ones and Harry around him, it only changed to give each person a face. Draco grinned wide, his heart swelling so much he felt it might burst.
Draco didn’t care if he’d have to steal Blaises’ boyfriend to be here with him. He didn’t want to be curled up alone in Myrtle’s bathroom feeling sick.
But to his surprise, Draco, though eyes slit and tail flicking more in agitation by the second, he put up his hand.
Rose wasn’t in as much of a distressed state as Albus, but she still sniffled, wrapping her tail around her cousin’s arm.
He wasn’t about to give in yet, but he wasn’t as anger ridden as he was with the initial shock of seeing someone look so much like Pup.
He swallowed the lump in his throat. But...he couldn’t just outright ask without it raising suspicions. If he were Granger or someone like her, he could.
Draco shook his head. “No. Actually, it just happened during this last fever. That’s why I had to wear sweatpants. My pants wouldn’t stretch over.” His mouth felt dry. He felt like she was trying to get somewhere but Draco couldn’t seem to pick what.
Harry stopped when a doctor came out hours later. “Mr. Potter. We had to perform an emergency c-section. Ah. Don’t worry, both him and the baby are fine. I was just letting you know what was going on. Once we clean up in there, you can see them. But, before you do, may I ask what happened? According to his chart he wasn’t due for another month. His case is also unusual, but, the pregnancy seemed be going how a normal one might.”
What did scare him, though, was he swore, instead of an adult version of Pup, whatever his child-like mind thought, he pictured the giant grin and tart woodsy scent of Harry.
He had gotten the whole day off, so he wasn’t sure what to do. He could bother Harry at work, but he didn’t know if Harry was in the field. He was sure Hermoine was home, so he could drop by and say hello to her and the little long tailed Capybara.
Remus was biting a knuckle, his ears lowered. He looked…frightened. “Padfoot. Pad-Sirius Black, come here.” He hollered downstairs.
Early Friday morning was when the parents began to show. They were sitting next to each other still from breakfast, Draco having swapped Neville for the morning, when the Weasley parents arrived as they were dispersing.
He blushed but didn’t let himself be distracted. Once he got to the bottom, he huffed. “Rose-Bud needs a change, but...I’ve never...done that.” He took a deep breath, Rose making noise just to make noise. “I was hoping, you’d show me how to change one. You obviously don’t have to. I’ll hand her over.” He went to, but Ginny put a hand up.
Draco took a deep breath, obviously nervous, he outstretched his hand. He was not on good terms with their only daughter and even the youngest son tended to snark back at him. But...they were important to Harry, so Draco wanted to make amends.
Needing assurance, Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry. He pulled back, pulling Harry too. He knew Harry would be over him and if he-yep.
“Here. I noticed you haven’t been at the main hall. Thought... maybe you’d be hungry.” Harry held up a treacle tart. “Wanna come down?”
“You know, Blaise doesn’t deserve you. I really don’t know what you see in him.” Draco scrunched his nose.
“So...” he went to try for a random topic when he felt the MP3 poke is thigh. He got an idea. He took it out and presented it to Draco with excitement, a grin on his face. This made Draco startle at his movement but then looked confused, his brow arched and lip puckered out slightly.
But Harry did tumble back from trying to twist their bodies away from the branches and not being able to move his feet right.
Harry was slightly sad when Draco released his hand, thought the feline looked like he wasn’t sure what to do with them. He looked in Harry’s eyes and Harry saw that vulnerability again. His silver eyes wide in disbelief. “Why would you do that? I-I don’t care what happens to me, Potter. I don’t care about her, there was nothing she could’ve done or said to effect me, but I know you’ve cared for and loved the Weasleys for as long as I can remember. Don’t throw that away for me. You have...” Draco took a deep breath, trying to regain his calm. He hadn’t realized the finger jabbing Harry in the chest.
So far, Professor Lupin had proven himself to be one of the few adults Draco could trust. Draco stood straight, a bad idea, and walked the few steps over and nodded.
A week later and he still hadn’t seen Harry. It was breakfast time in the main hall. Pansy traded spots with him so he could glance over at the Gryffindor table without being too obvious.
Harry huffed but he smiled and complied, not without grabbing Draco’s tail and running his hand from the base to tip as he walked away, Draco blushing at how gentle he held it. He did have to admit though, his mate was hot in his uniform. The thought from earlier, when he was talking with Astoria, came to mind and he blushed.
Harry was a little sad that didn’t get a reaction but thought for a moment. “Shouldn’t be late, unless boss tells us anything. Why?”
Harry looked at his son alarmed. “What?!” He grabbed his son and made him sit on his knee while he wrapped the child in his arms. “Albus, no matter what you came out like, your Mom would love you. What does it matter which one of us you look like?” Harry observed the red cheeks and wet eyes of Albus who sniffled and tried to stop crying.
“You think he’ll be happy? I don’t...even know if it’ll work. There’s still so much even the doctors don’t know.”
Harry swore he looked like he was going to cry. He got up and put Albus near him. “Here. He’s your baby too.”
He entered the kitchen, a stone in his belly. There was a reason Riddle brought him to back then. Back to a meal. Told him to say hello to Harry.
Albus’ lips curled at the edges as he grinned bigger, looking proud, though he didn’t boast. But then with a serious face and his big-for-him hands he put them on Draco’s cheeks, looking him in the eye. “Where you get nightmares, so maybe this will chase them away. Moonpa is gonna teach me to make dream catchers for you. But this will have to do.”
When he felt the pain was gone, he had to worry about deciphering what Riddle said. Riddle wouldn’t let him off that easy. Especially if it wasn’t a dream and he could’ve killed Draco then.
“Goodnight Potter. We shall see if we get in trouble, tomorrow.” Draco broke out in a large, teeth showing grin and with a pivot of his heel, his tail flicking happily, Draco turned and left.
He grinned so hard it hurt. He didn’t have to worry anymore. Harry loved him. He kissed him! Draco had never been kissed before. It seemed Harry hadn’t either, which was a reassurance because it backed up what Harry said. Or so to Draco that’s what it seemed.
After thinking about not much, he placed a hand against his abdomen. He smiled fondly, purring so loud even he noticed.
Harry went to stand but let out a pained groan. His thigh felt like a large rock was thrown onto it. Draco must’ve fractured it. Harry let out a pained hiss and tried getting closer.
Sirius looked over and grinned widely. Very similar to Harry. “Ah! This must be Draco. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you.” He went over and held out his hand. Draco shook it.
Draco, though. Draco wanted to keep the people who made him feel wanted. He wanted the hard work, the grins, the playful taunting. He wanted the love he felt with Pup.
Draco could feel the coil of panic in his chest. ‘Happening?’ What could be happening?! He wasn’t sure how to respond.
He ran. He ran up and down the halls and corridors, unsure which professors Harry went to see first.
Harry didn’t want to hear more and so, to stop the sad look on Draco’s face and prove to him as long as Draco wasn’t a part of it then he’d love him (it’d break his heart if he was. He didn’t want to be Draco’s enemy again), Harry grasped Draco’s head gently in his large hands and kissed him. He kept his lips against Draco’s and deepened it when Draco gasped.
Draco still wasn’t sure what to do about his parents. Now that he crossed “Pup’s” Claim off, he knew they’d be more relentless.
Harry put up a silencing charm around them as Draco began to wail and bawl. He didn’t blabber or try and say why he was crying. So Harry rubbed his back, whispering loving words.
Draco crawled over, farther away, and gathered both the wands and seemed to have found Harry’s glasses, if the noise of acknowledgement he made was to go by.
Draco wasn’t ready to give “Pup” up. He was so scared of losing Draco. He’d waited too long and now he wasn’t sure what would be right.
She pointed where there was a network of nerves going from the bottom of the makeshift uterus to lower and he could only guess with embarrassment where.
Sorry been so long. Was working on other works and needed a break from this one. But I’m back! Hope y’all enjoy! Kudos and comments are welcome.
They walked with Ron, Hermoine, Neville and Blaise. The latter two parted on their own after awhile.
Her eyes widened, looking him over again, seeming to think. She sighed, putting her face in her hand. “That boy...” she muttered, sounding tired. She looked back to Harry, looking him in the eye.
To his surprise, Lupin let out a snort and a small chuckle. “That could never happen. Now, I’m a bit nosy, so what made you kiss him?”
“I saw you kept looking at it. Might have to spiffy it but-“ He halted at seeing large tears fall from Draco’s eyes.
Within a blink…Astoria was against the floor and the screaming, the cackling, and the low growl of praise from Tom, was ringing in his ears.
Huffing, Draco fixed Harry an unimpressed face and pulled him for a kiss. He was getting more used to them, but also wasn’t.
There was that petty bitch part of him that knew he’d get some sort of revenge on Harry for keeping it from him for 5 years.
Draco looked to Sirius with awe. No wonder, Harry was so loving despite his real parents being dead. No. Not his real parents. His birth parents.
Draco laughed. “Not quite, but sure. Unless they call your name, I’m not dropping it now that I’m curious.”
Her eyes widened. Then she looked into his own eyes and she obviously wasn’t sure what to think. In honesty, he shouldn’t have been nosy, but he had this inkling he could help somehow.
Harry opened his eyes, his glasses cracked but most likely by magic, still on his face. He hissed in pain as Draco used one hand to lift his head, the other reaching behind to feel for bumps.
Draco recovered first, sitting up quickly to inspect Harry who’s face was scrunched into a grimace. He didn’t seem to have any broken bones, but he went to lift Harry’s head, the other in too much pain to comply.
“What do you know, oh savior?!” Draco was getting upset. Harry must’ve said the wrong thing. Or the right thing, Harry wasn’t sure.
“Granger. I missed some classes. Mind letting me borrow notes?” Draco had asked and Harry fought to not nose at his jaw. Draco had terrified him yesterday and having him so close was probably bad.
Harry usually pissed him off. But it was usually with words, defensive gestures, or simply doing something that made Draco more irritable. Things like today were a newer thing. Not the end of it, but the beginning. The peace offering and gentle smile. The lukewarm snarkiness with no bite.
They both frowned when they got to the kitchen, seeing Harry a mess with stacks of raw meat all about. Harry being a mess was normal for them, but not so much the meat.
“Oh, please, you love I marked you up. Plus, truly, you wouldn’t have nearly as many scars if you’d gotten that through that thick skull of yours.” Draco replied.
Draco had a decent bruise on his jaw. Harry thought maybe that was why he was silent and hoped it wasn’t fractured.
Harry kissed his forehead and the earring twinkled in the morning light. A month? “Harry? What about my work?”
“Mom was talking with another Cat outside the house when he thought I was still in the bath. Mom was getting very mad. I didn’t understand all they were saying, until Mom yelled, “you think I wasn’t terrified when Albus came out looking like a Bear”, and hissed at the other Cat. Mom tried fixing up the house all day afterwards, mumbling. He had a bad nightmare that night too.” Albus tried rubbing his face on Harry’s collarbone, a comfort gesture, usually to calm himself.
They came upon a little nook area, selling wood carved items and some jewelry. He noticed Draco staring at some dingy, old looking earrings. They looked to be dirty opals but the colors of red and a lime green were just barely noticeable. Harry went back to looking but kept seeing Draco looking over at them.
Harry tried more breathing exercises. “He never explained about the Floo, even though he told Albus it was to see Rose and you guys easier. The kids…they used…they used his wand.“
Harry smiled down at him, seeing Draco like this was an odd reassuring nest in his chest. Like a calming weight. He chuckled, it was deep. He didn’t notice Draco’s blush at the noise. “Oh? And what secrets might they be?” He subconsciously rubbed his thumb against Draco’s fingers.
He rose a brow and sat straighter, putting one leg over the other. “True, but you said “not sure” which isn’t a “no”. Which either means you think I’ll take it as a “fuck off” or I’ll keep asking which you aren’t sure if you want or not, which means there’s no one either near or currently in your circle you can confide in. So...would you like to listen to music to calm a bit or chat with someone who might know what you’re feeling?” He had his cheek propped on his hand, the player in the other.
“Thank you, Professor Lupin, for your help. Defense Against the Dark Arts has been interesting this year. And for...the other stuff.” Draco stood stiffly but his voice was full of gratitude.
He’d indulge his curiosity, but he would also strike if she showed herself to be a threat. He bit his lip. “I’m his mate. Now you.”
He saw Harry did look, his face scrunched in confusion. “Indents in your spine? When did...” he looked to the other, more confused by what he was seeing. “What’s this?”
Draco wasn’t sure. He didn’t even know if he COULD have one and he didn’t want to give Harry hope if he had the stuff but could bear a little one. He also had work, so did Harry. “What do you want, Harry?” He whispered and looked up as he pushed away a bit, enough to see his face.
Sirius hummed and straightened. “Oh, nothing much. It’s not what I was thinking. Quite the tail that ones got. Don’t cause too much trouble alright?” He patted Harry’s head but Harry grabbed Sirius’ wrist.
Harry slowly, almost as if not to spook Draco, turned towards him as well, placing his own rough hand on top of Draco’s on the grass.
Draco scoffed, moving himself to his hands and knees, he glanced around, probably looking for their wands. “Oh please, don’t flatter yourself, Potter. I’ll leave that job to the rest of the Wizarding World.” Again, there was spite there. “Why did you go easy on me, you prick?” His voice strained out and Harry furrowed his own brow. He hadn’t really.
He felt something wet but his nose wasn’t good enough to smell it. He hoped it was water, but pulling his hand back, he saw some blood. Harry wasn’t bleeding bad, but it was enough to send Draco panicking again.
Draco got closer, his breath shuddering. “I...I’ve never...” Draco took a large breath and exhaled. Harry’s nerves were on fire but he wasn’t sure what to do.
She scratched at her head, but then realized something important that happened during the X-rays. “Mr. Black-Lupin, have your hips always been a bit wider than the average cat male?”
He walked ahead, posture tense. The last thing Harry had heard about Draco’s family was that his father went too far, sending Draco to the brink and forcing him to resign his name. He rarely heard anything about his mother. She was dainty, almost. Draco obviously got his figure more so from his mother.
Riddle’s face was in his own, a deep growl erupting from deep within his chest. “You will. Tell Potter I said “hello”.”
In the past, Draco would’ve never even tried making an acquaintance on his own. At least, not out of no where.
Harry sighed. “No. I’m not. Draco wouldn’t leave Albus and Rose. Even if he did, he’d keep his wand. There’s nothing in Albus’ memories or any other magic signature lingering on it. I’m lost.”
Harry nodded. “Draco. Please go to the doctors. Since your fever broke and you’re up, I have to work. Just take your time and go to the doctor.” Harry’s voice was stern.
She was chewing on her fist and holding her cat-like tail with the other. Her bright blue eyes looked up and him. She giggled and reached for him.
He tried using a dish to see his reflection and saw he did have some juice on the corner of his lip.
Draco deadpanned and Harry laughed. Draco huffed, tail flicking as he stole Harry’s glasses. “There, now be blind.”
Harry really wished he could see Draco’s face clearly. “I kinda need my glasses, Malfoy.” He said with a small grin.
Harry gulped. He looked at what he hoped was Draco’s eyes, he swore even with his blurry vision, he saw the silver orbs dance. Wow...he really must’ve hit his head. “Tell me what’s wrong first.”
Then, Ginny had been clingy as of late. Since she was Ron’s sister and he had friendliness towards her family, he put up with it.
Lupin chuckled. “Well, how about before other students and parents show up, I give you both chocolate to get you through the day?” He handed them chocolate and Draco wasn’t sure what to think. He knew Lupin ate it usually to help him with mood or body pain he’d get occasionally.
Harry opened it, hoping for a clue to the person’s identity. The writing was neat, precise. Not really one of someone writing a suicide note. He checked and yes, there was only this one’s signature. Looking at the page, it read:
Draco crossed his arms and looked to Ginny, unimpressed and almost expecting an insult. His tail flicked.
Sirius had pulled Remus out, both getting stink eye from the witch before she gave Draco the medicine.
He did notice the gentleness Hermoine showed to him and felt happy. He had to control his face from breaking out into a giant grin when he heard Draco compliment her hair, no tone of insult in sight.
Albus searched Harry’s eyes, his own slit ones super focused. Draco’s eyes. “Okay. It’s been awhile since it was just us.” He grabbed Harry’s hand and put Draco’s wand in his pants.
He could hear Harry walking over to where he guessed Draco was in the large pile. His voice was soothing, sweet.
Going up the stairs, a lot of the Weasley pictures gave him dirty looks. He ignored them. Rose’ room was a typical baby nursery. He went over and leaned, making sure the baby was okay. She had a full head of curly red hair.
Albus was easily in Harry’s arms a moment later, the child inconsolable. “Where’s mom?” Harry tried staying calm, his voice rough, but not loud, his body shaking and magic thrumming wildly in his veins. Having Albus in his arms helped to ground him. No doubt, if it were before, Harry would be searching blindly.
He looked up. “Can you find out any married couples who go by the last name Black-Lupin?” He swallowed the lump forming.
Harry either hadn’t minded or was oblivious, judging by his lack of reacting to her flirting. Gross.
It was late in 4th year. Some trouble during the year made school go for a bit longer in summer. Tomorrow would be the 5th of June. They could all go home then.
As he walked down the quiet halls, his feet, even in shoes, felt so frozen. He wanted Harry. He wanted his baby. He stopped, pulling up his shirt and seeing the scar from when he had Albus. He had to be dreaming then.
He knew he must’ve looked terrifying to a younger girl. His green eyes blazed with anger, his grasp so tight on the wand you could start to hear it crack. If he bore his teeth, it’d be worse, so he tried keeping that in check.
Harry smirked, though even up close, it was a bit hard to see clearly. “In your dreams, Malfoy. I wouldn’t give you the pleasure.”
Draco’s body felt like it was drenched with ice, when the man who was covered in scars, a wolf’s tail and ears, a few chips in them, introduced himself as Remus Lupin.
Draco deadpanned. That was one long way around a “you must’ve changed” simple sentence. “So...what should I do?”
“Astoria?! Scorpius?” He wanted to run to them, but upon his growing terror, he saw the Death mark on Astoria’s forearm, a great sadness in her eyes. “Why?!”
Draco was right and Dumbledore announced that after the Hogsmead trip, those who would go, namely the 6th years, there would be a parent/guardian visit day so their guardians could get a chance to see how their studies were going and socially how they were doing. Harry didn’t mind, it just meant he’d have a day with his Dad and Pop.
When he was putting in the report the coroner gave, he had told Ron he’d finish up, it was still unknown what killed them. The blood everywhere was not the victim’s.
Harry would rue and learn from this mistake. He would learn to never hide shit like that from Draco again!
Harry had the impulse to follow, but something told him not to. Usually he ignored that feeling, but part of him knew to listen.
Draco had been cautious and unsure, like he wasn’t sure where to even begin with a child, learning what he could, just as Harry was. A lot of it, they’d spend hours awake, simply going over future rules, though those might change, how they want to raise their son, both learning from their loved ones, really, HOW to take care of one.
Remus poked his head out of the kitchen, the scent of Harry’s favorite dinner dishes filling the air, once Draco got close enough. “Oh, Draco! Bring that in.”
When the trolley of sweets and treats came by, most of them, except for himself and Granger, got something. He hadn’t felt hunger since the night before and it seemed Granger just wasn’t a fan of sweets.
Lucky for him, though, the person twirled them, their arms wrapped around Draco’s hips as he dodged the claws.
Harry surveyed the area around, looking for a weapon or any clue, even using a charm to look for a magic signature, but only finding the one of the body under the sheet.
He smiled gently, running his fingers against his cheek, watching Draco’s eyes follow it. “You don’t have to. Just...say...” he gulped. He then took a deep breath.
Draco’s hand twitched as he fought the urge to walk over. Like it was okay to do so. When really, it wasn’t.
In his bed that night, Harry had giggled and blushed. Embarrassing, but he did. That meant Draco treasured him. Treasured his mark. Even though he didn’t know it was him.
To his disbelief, Harry looked and just chuckled. “I’m fine. No need to throw yourself at me, Malfoy.”
Draco burst into a full face blush, swallowing the lump in his throat. “I-Uh-you-too-I mean...where did that...come from?”
Draco sighed. “I didn’t want to outright say she was a “old blood” who was against her family’s ways. I hope she’ll tell me if she is or not.”
As Albus began to fuss, Draco let out a loud purr, the effects immediate as Albus began to drift back. Harry knew they’d probably have to feed him soon.
He gave Draco a few more long and lingering kisses. “Would you like to skip out of the great hall and meet me near the roof? I can use my invisibility cloak to sneak us lunch up so no one knows.”
Draco had to process. He knew Harry’s Pop? When they were kids, when Draco asked him what he was, Harry had said he was either a wolf or a dog. The only wolf that worked here was Professor Lupin and no dogs worked there...
Also, thank you to all who have commented and kudos and read this! It helps give me confidence to keep writing.
Draco smirked, Harry’s aloof playing had him relaxing. “Don’t worry, not all the time. Do you want to guess?”
Draco lifted his hand like he was going to claw Harry’s face, but he halted, his body shaking. Harry’s eyes widened at the tears beginning to form.
“It hurt me...to see you suddenly change. You were always a brat, but...Draco, love-“ Harry began but was cut off by Draco using the wrist holding against him. Instead of pulling, Draco pushed so his hands fumbled to cover Harry’s mouth.
Draco would’ve laughed if he didn’t feel wretched. What she saw in Harry was an illusion. Not real. Whatever heroic bastard she thought up, wasn’t the man he truly was.
“Yes. Somehow the kids made it back fine. I’m worried. Draco wouldn’t leave them alone, at least not long.” Harry grit his teeth, knowing he was too close to the situation but refused to back down or ask for help. “He was acting normal. Kinda…” he muttered, his eyes catching the meat.
What Draco knew, was he was a dork, sometimes hard with words, spoke with his hands a lot, was a people pleaser with a hero complex and mauder like tendencies. He loved treacle tart and odd music that made your body pulse with it. He also had a temper once pushed a certain way or to a certain brink and Draco rarely liked being on the receiving end of it.
Draco jumped, claws extended and he turned fast, ready to swipe at the voice, acting before “who” the voice belonged to registered.
Draco grinned. He’d been in a much better mood as of late. He took out a book to read as he waited for his name to be called.
A short, maybe an hour visit turned into 4 and counting as they did do some blood work and tests and the ultrasound but wanted to wait and see the results before allowing him to leave.
“Can you put my glasses back on me, Malfoy?” Harry asked, lowering their intertwined fingers to the wire framed, old glasses.
Harry hummed, looking back and Draco had to admit, if he wasn’t still feeling wretched, he’d make a semi-joke about Harry in a uniform. “I explained and they’ll await your return. Your MP, little sly Pansy Parkinson, said her other underlings weren’t as good as you.”
Until Draco Claimed him, he wasn’t going to be selfish and do it again. The earrings still worked well enough.
His heart still hurt, even 4 years later. Now that he was older. Old enough to understand, he knew why.
Draco’s eyes widened and he snorted, starting to laugh. Harry raised a brow, not sure what was funny.
It was strange, the feeling that had consumed him for years, was lifted. He didn’t feel torn because the two he’d felt for was actually one person. He deadpanned. Really, if he’d ever seen other bear-types he could have MAYBE pieced it together.
It seemed it was pulled out of line at the base, where tail met back and another spot right below the bend in his tail. He could ask Madame Pomphrey or ask Neville there.
He took a deep breath. There was only one thing he needed from Harry. Just so he’d know the one he loved was safe, along with their baby.
Draco took a deep breath. “I don’t know. I don’t know what I did to piss off the Weaslette. I was already on edge because of something, then I let them all come in and then after awhile she just yanks on my tail. She was so obviously trying to get Har-Potter’s-attention.”
He put on shoes, a jacket, and grabbed his Muggle MP3 player that his Dad got him when he was 8 years old, hoping to cheer him up.
Draco got on his toes and kissed Harry then. He heard Harry chuckle against it, but neither could relax in their bubble before Draco heard a voice. One he was dreading, turning his veins from a nice heat to shocking ice.
Harry thought the humming was a bonus on top of just being cute. Draco seemed to be in a good mood. Everyone had mostly dispersed to either the yards or classes and it seemed they caught him right before.
He didn’t expect Draco to nod. “I’m an only child but I do care for him in a familial way. He explained it’s something that happens in some books he’s read. It’s called “found family”. Anyway, Potter, who were you looking for?”
Harry felt a protective coil burn and spread. He about went to grasp Ginny’s hand, to demand why she’s being like this. She was usually shy and yes, hard headed like Molly, but not so venomous to others.
He didn’t need Pup now that he had others who cared. They weren’t many, but for someone as lonely as Draco, they were more than enough.
When the doctor came in, she switched on the light board and set up the first X-ray. His spinal one. He noticed there were indents in the back of his neck vertebrae along with what looked like nerves coming out. It sent a chill down his back.
“Harry. Give him some space. He’s not going anywhere. I know you’re worried, but you can’t be this wound up.”
Feeling Harry’s hands move from under his thighs to gripping his ass tightly had a jolt of pleasure shoot through his spine so harshly, making his head dizzy.
Draco nodded, he wanted a kiss again. “Among other things, but yes. Now I don’t know where to go. I’m not taking it back. He crossed a line when it came to you all.”
Draco bent to Albus’ level, taking it. Paint was used but it looked like a family picture. There was a sun and a blue moon. Paint figures that he could only guess was himself, Albus and Harry. He smiled fondly at the obvious figures of Ron, Hermoine, Rose, Padpa and Moonpa. “This is beautiful, Albus. Where should I put it?”
Ginny looked to him and piped up. “You agree right, Harry? I know I should’ve let go but he was being rude by eyeing you like he was. Did none of you see the looks he was giving me as well?”
“Do you want it? If it’s causing pain...listen, love. When I Claimed you it was simply because I wanted to keep you forever. I wasn’t even thinking about reproduction. I’m not even sure where to begin to reverse it, if it’s what YOU want.” Harry said, he was serious.
“Will Harry be by after work?” Remus asked, working on a marinade while Draco saw Sirius working on something out back.
Neither had said barely a word to the other in 3 years. Not since Draco left without a word as their 3rd year ended and hadn’t spoken to him since. Coming back the next year after, thinner and more lost looking. Quieter. Angrier.
He heard his father scoff. “You’d throw away everything you have for a stupid Gryffindor? Draco, you’re just being stubborn now. We’ll find you a nice female and your Claim induced infatuation would be gone.”
It was still quiet. The only noise was their breathing, Riddle’s walking. The only heat was from the meal, Draco’s being cooked.
He tried willing himself to move, but his body wouldn’t comply. He curled into a ball again. He’d been doing that a lot as of late.
He knew Harry was sweet, for Salazar’s sake he witnessed it on many occasions. He had a hero complex that honestly...pissed Draco off more than anything.
Draco poked his head out and Harry smiled fondly at him. “There you are. You go to the doctor or stay in bed?”
“How? I’ve never heard of that. You said it was the cause of the fevers, so, why? Why is it causing them?”
He got off the trolley later on as it neared dusk. He had ended up spending a long time there even after Hermoine returned. He was sent home with enough soup for both him and Harry, though since it had vegetables, Harry would most likely eat it.
As they were leaving, Professor Lupin turned his head. “Harry, when you have a moment, will you bring Draco’s things over? You know where I am.”
Once he wrapped his fingers on it, his body let go of the branch. He tumbled when he landed back on the grassy earth but he saw the willow building momentum.
Riddle petted him so gently, Draco waited for the blow. “You know, Draco. Predator’s have to learn that prey is anything. You’ve always been thin.”
Draco hadn’t realized he let himself grin. It was quickly wiped away when he felt the branches moving more actively. The tree groaned in protest. He clung to the branch he was on tightly, he had realized quickly how dumb it was of him to climb to one of the higher branches.
Draco smiled softly. He looked back at his friends and family. He took a deep breath and decided. He’d tell Harry then.
Ginny nodded, though she was obviously unsure. Rose was only a few months old, of course she’d worry.
He felt Draco flick his forehead, he winced at it. “Went easy. Really, Potter. If you’re going to lie, do it right.”
“You sure, ‘Mione? I bet he wants a certain blonde cat to have his tongue.” Neville quipped. Harry blushed harder.
“Well...Moony likes you, so there’s one point for me to get to know you. Two, Harry loves you. Has since he was 7 years old. And you know, it took you almost 10 years to choose to move on from a love you knew so little of, so, I think you’re good for Harry. You’re enough for us, I think, if you’ll have us.” Sirius said as he laid a hand on Draco’s head and smiled.
Draco by then had squirmed to his stomach and tried curling in. Harry reached and held his fingers again, not much for Draco’s sake but his own.
“Uhm..” he started as they both were back in the halls. “Would you like me to walk you to the Slytherin dorms?”
Once there, the nurses took one look at Draco and seemed to know or have enough concern to check. Harry wasn’t allowed inside the room. He could feel the lump in his throat as he tried pacing out the panic. Both of their phones were at home. Truly, he was so focused on if Draco was okay, that the thought to call his Dad and Pop never crossed his mind.
He observed how filled out with muscle Harry was becoming. His hair was parted now, revealing the scar on his forehead. Draco felt both lucky and not enough. It’s been years since he felt that. Maybe it was the sudden body change.
His eyes caught a hold of Harry. He swore he could feel happiness radiating off the Gryffindor. But, how could he, when Harry wasn’t even aware Draco was looking at him?
He was brought out by seeing Harry’s hands twitch, like he wanted to do something but didn’t. Harry’s hesitance made Draco get an idea. He kept his hand pinching Harry’s ear. He was going to see how long he could get away with it.
Just talking to him seemed to be relaxing her, he was glad. She took a deep breath, obviously unsure. “My family, let’s just say, doesn’t approve of how I got to this point. I’m a full grown woman, really.” She covered her mouth at her exasperated tone at the last bit.
He curled into Harry. Part of him was happy it was Harry here and not Albus. But another part of him wished he was alone. “I didn’t know what the meat really was and I should’ve. I was fed it so often... but I forgot.”
Harry opened his mouth to ask as he ran past to pick it up, Draco having seemed to not even realize, but Narcissa beat him to it.
It wasn’t quite dusk, but the colors began to change from blue to the pinks and oranges. It reminded Harry of that morning. So, taking a deep breath, he moved where his leg was up against Draco’s.
She went up and grasped his sleeve. She still didn’t have the confidence to hug him full on, it seemed, or she had to know she was in trouble.
“No, no, no! Draco, never. I’ve loved you then and these years, though they’ve been...difficult...have only made my affection to you grow. At first, I was so worried you were mad. That you hated me. Then I realized you didn’t know. Then you were so angry. I...I didn’t know angry Draco.” Harry looked to Draco’s hands. They were clenched so tight his knuckles were as white as bone.
“Sorry, Potter, no luck. I’m carnivorous, if you didn’t know. Sweets are for children and your teeth will rot. So no, I’m not coming down.”
Truthfully, what Draco said, hurt. It stung. He thought what he was doing was a good thing, that’s why he did it. He was trying to prove he could protect Draco or whoever but Draco...apparently didn’t see it that way.
He liked them and their boys weren’t bad, then again the older ones didn’t have Draco to deal with to cause issues. That had been why he was lenient with Ginny for so long. It seemed, that was a bad decision on his part.
He remembered petting Draco’s tail, manipulating it through his fingers gently, and Draco let him. He even purred at some point. That was back when they were kids though.
Harry broke out into a large grin. He missed this. He wanted to tell him as soon as he could, but it seemed Draco read his mind and wanted to enjoy the trip first.
Harry couldn’t help his next impulse. He gripped Draco around the waist, pulling him against himself. He heard the gasp that left Draco, but he ignored it.
Ron looked grossed out, but snickered anyway. “Sucks for you then. What ALSO sucks for you is we have these cold cases to go through.” He set down more files. “Also, on another note, little Rose is trying to walk. A go getter that one. Mione’ thinks it’s great she’s gonna have a cousin close to her age running along soon.”
“Stop panicking. No one knows except my family and a few I’ve told. Plus it’s usually when I’m home for the summer, so what would be the reason to tell? And for your information, it was today. So I’m counting our dancing, since it was past midnight while we were, part of it. I haven’t laughed like that since I was little.”
It stayed silent as food was brought out (by magic of course) and all Draco could smell was blood. His throat closed as he tried not to look.
Harry followed, a few steps behind. “A helluva lot of precautions. You already hid the nursery, even as we turned it into Albus’ room. I had thought it was fine, since I knew you were protective of him. Is it just that? Ferret…” Harry breathed out once they dressed with no issue, except for Draco not turning towards him, “…I understand you’re a Slytherin, but it’s more than preservation…isn’t it?” Harry walked closer, reaching for the back of Draco’s neck, more so as a comfort to himself. “Love…I need-“ Harry cut off, his hand jolting back, as if Draco had struck it himself.
The rabbit looked relieved. “Thank goodness. You weren’t waking. I came to look for you since you didn’t come back. We’re all worried. Luckily Blaise knew that you escape here to chat with Myrtle sometimes.” He smiled sweetly.
‘So he wants to hear this? Is that what he’s saying?’ Harry was confused and the longer Ginny’s wand stayed on Draco’s throat, the more angry Harry became.
Albus nodded. Harry went over and ruffled Albus’ hair with a large toothy grin, since Draco had him in a hug. “We’ll see you tomorrow. Maybe Rose too. Behave.”
He turned to the younger, giving her a tired look, not wanting to glare at her. “Ginny. What was all that? Draco hadn’t done anything to you.”
His brows furrowed and he couldn’t stop them from doing so. He forced himself to smirk, his slight grimace could be mistaken because of pain. That wasn’t the case, in reality.
He was Harry’s mate and Harry had been a terrible one. He left Draco, he fought with him, he allowed him to get hurt.
Draco’s breath hitched. “H-Harry. S-say something. I’m stuttering and it’s-it’s embarrassing. I’m no damsel, you have to know. I’ve broken your bones too. So...”
After they ate and cleaned up, Draco laid with his back propped against the arm rest of the couch and Harry relaxed on his lower half, arms around Draco’s middle, cheek resting on his abdomen and from the knees down, bent in the air. Draco had no idea how he was comfy.
He hadn’t even realized he’d closed his eyes until they flew open and he swiped in the direction his tail was pulled.
They stopped with a loud “oof” and a hiss of pain from Harry under him, the idiotic Gryffindor using himself as Draco’s pillow to land on.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “My darling winter Ferret, you realize that means so much to me? Even as kids you never said that word.”
Harry had put the blankets down as to see Draco better and he paused when he had to widen his knees farther than usual at Draco’s hips.
Her eyes shifted guiltily away. “I suppose you’re right. Rose is sleeping. Taking her afternoon nap.”
He was glad Draco rarely pressed him about work. He didn’t want to stress him by telling him that something was going on.
‘A bat?’ He realized, along with the large ears atop her head, twitching. She pulled out a book, though it was obvious she wasn’t reading it.
Harry grinned, not seeming to care, and grasped Draco’s hand, the other gasping. “P-Potter! I-others will-“
His doctor, the lemur, had wanted him to come in more often than most simply because of his “unique” case and until they got a clear idea of what he’d need, she’d continue to have him come there as opposed to a specialist who would have no idea because Draco wasn’t what they usually worked with.
