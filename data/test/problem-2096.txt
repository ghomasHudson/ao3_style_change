He felt Ron sit down on his other side. "This is Harry. He's always okay. He'll get out of this and get a message to us somehow."
Draco shook his head and held on tighter, the almost silent sobs wracking his body now. "I'm sorry."
Well, babe, I think that went well
"You're being ridiculous," Harry growled. "Fucking, pig-headed, imbecilic—"
"Hey, what am I? Chopped liver?" Ginny said from his other side.
Lying back down and looking back up at the glowing stars, Draco sighed and his voice sounded amused. "I suppose I could have picked a more opportune time to make my stand than while sitting around the tree on Christmas morning. But they were so insistent on our plans to meet with the Greengrasses later in the day, and then Mother gifted me a book on pure-blood courting rituals, and I just lost my patience. I stood up, told them in no uncertain terms that I would not be marrying
He tasted like memories: like Quidditch, takeaway, and duelling ballet. He filled the entirety of my senses, the smell of his shampoo and the feel of his hand on my neck, then cupping the back of my head. When we both ran out of breath and pulled away, he dropped his forehead to mine as we panted together.
He rarely let me forget it in the years to come, as my small collection of stories soon became a larger series, each fantastically decorated by Luna Lovegood and then eagerly published by a Muggle publishing house. And when they were being carried in Flourish and Blotts two years later, nobody seemed to care that they were written by H.J. Evans. They simply bought them anyway.
Harry laid back on the pillow and sighed. "She hates me."
"All those things you mentioned? They weren't going to be possible in a world with Voldemort. He was hell-bent on destroying so much, and I was the one person who could fix it. It was because I wanted Teddy to be able to grow up in peace, to give my schoolmates like Draco and Luna a chance at a better life, the chance to have a family and people they loved. If I couldn't have it, at least other people could."
Draco found Dudley in the dining room, talking with his girlfriend and several older women. He waited for the conversation to die down and examined the walls with their tacky wallpaper and disturbingly still Muggle family portraits. It looked like it'd been decorated by someone who wished they had taste but sadly lacked any actual discernment.
Harry turned and started stalking. "Am I, or am I not, your husband?"
Draco's throat clenched at the idea of leaving Harry even that long, but Lyra needed him. "Teddy?" he asked.
Lyra put her hands on Draco's cheeks and made him look at her in the eye. She did that when she wanted him to know she was serious about something. Usually, he had to try to keep a straight face, but this time, he only had to hold back tears. "Daddy is going to be okay. I know he is, and then you can come home and take a nap too."
Draco's lips twitched into a small smile from his place on Harry's bed. "You're welcome. Merlin, it's quiet in here now. We need some music."
But that didn't mean Draco was willing to share his closet.
"Yes, jealous. They're getting ready to start this whole new adventure, but it's theirs, and I'm just finishing mine. Teddy's gone off to Hogwarts, and I'm just here, waiting, with nothing in front of me, nobody to love me, no future to look forward to." The words sounded bitter, but I was feeling bitter.
"Deal."
When he didn't move to take it, she nudged his hand. "You have to eat. Harry needs you to be strong. Lyra needs you to be healthy. Eat."
Draco's nightmares were less consistent than Alex's, maybe because he wasn't sleeping as deeply as normal. His dreams generally came in the early hours of the morning, and he'd wake in a cold sweat and an ache in his heart, reaching for Harry before he could stop himself. Harry would pull him into his arms, reassuring him that all was well. Slowly, the remnants of grief would wane, but the fear of that grief would remain, creeping up on him when he let his guard down.
Harry sipped for several seconds, then let his head fall back down. "Thank you."
"Oh yeah!" She ran up the stairs, and Harry turned to him, laughing.
. And I'll be honest, I like yours better. This is way too heavy for lunch while at work."
Oh yeah. Harry closed his eyes and let the music roll over him.
"Teddy." Harry's eyes looked frantic. "Is Teddy okay?"
"Oh," Lyra said, trying to see around Draco. "Is he still sleeping then?"
"Harry…"
"I have to go home for a little while and see Lyra, but I'll be back soon, okay? Hermione's going to take care of you while I'm gone."
"No, they've only been together a year. Those first few months of fuck buddies don't count."
"Really?" Lyra asked, her eyes wide and her little body practically vibrating where she sat on the armchair. She looked back and forth between Harry and Draco like she was afraid they were pranking her. It was several days after their initial decision, and as they'd learned that the legalities of the adoption were large but not anything that would ultimately hinder them, they decided they were ready to talk to the kids.
"Because…" she prodded.
Draco leaned over and kissed the crown of her head. "You're a good girl. Auntie Angie is on her way over to stay with you both, and Alex hasn't met her, so you make sure you're there when he wakes up, okay? And tell him I'll be back. I just have to go see Daddy for a while."
"It's a gay bar," Draco leaned close and said into Harry's ear, his warm breath making the hair on Harry's neck rise. "Well, not entirely, but mostly. They host drag nights and are notably gay-friendly. We're here to find somebody for you to flirt with, remember?"
Luna leaned in and kissed her partner. "Thank you, love."
Of course, he was. And that's what Harry was so afraid of. The light changed and Harry drove on. "Don't worry. You'll understand soon enough, I reckon."
"Okay, everyone ready? Alex, I'm going to carry you. Lyra, hold Hermione's hand and don't pull away."
The sobs grew louder and Draco just held on, helpless to do anything else, his own face wet with the grief for the child, praying to whatever powers might be listening that his own daughter wouldn't have to go through this same pain.
daughter.
"What you came home to…the chaos. It was good. The silence of the last few days, the perfect behaviour? That wasn't normal for small children. The fact that they both felt comfortable enough today to begin acting out a bit? It's a good sign."
"Are you ready, Harry?" he asked, his face so close that his breath brushed my cheek.
"Doing it?" Draco asked, his voice confused. "Doing
"Alex," he said, trying to keep the panic out of his voice. He ran his hand over the boy's back. "It's just for a little bit."
"Evidently they studied it in more detail after the Memorial in May." Hermione froze, her eyes widening. "Harry—"
That helped. The reminder that another little person I could call mine would eventually enter this world. It helped.
You guys suck! This is how you tell us?
him. Missed
Harry’s resultant grin was almost feral, and Draco fled before he could embarrass himself. Salazar, even professionals had their limits.
"Draco is good with kids, no matter what he thinks," Hermione said, then she caught his eye and winked, obviously aware he was listening. "He likes to consider himself a grumpy Slytherin, but he's really a big softy. My kids adore Uncle Draco."
Draco glared at his father. His years in Azkaban were only visible if you looked closely, but they’d softened Lucius’s edges enough that Draco had found it within himself to forgive the older man. Mostly. But that didn’t mean he wanted him interfering in his life. “I’m not interested in any of the women you’ve been throwing in my path.”
"I don't get paid enough for this," Draco muttered, and Harry snorted. "I'm not a Mind-Healer. I'm not a career coach, and Circe knows I'm only just now figuring out my own shit."
Andi conjured a chair next to Draco and tucked her arm under his. "Where's Harry?"
"Just be there for him, Draco. And we'll be there too, don't you worry. Text us the information when you have it."
Gathii was a beautiful man. He was tall, the dark skin of his African childhood positively glowing, and the light accent in his voice added a level of polish that I couldn't possibly hope to emulate.
He hesitated on the threshold and turned back.
Draco laughed. "Yes, she does. I'd ask if she'd always been that way, but I think we all know the answer already. Anyway, Pansy said eighth-years have permission to leave the castle Friday and Saturday night, as long as we're back and on the grounds by midnight."
"Do what?"
"If I find someone, yes," Harry promised, and the idea of being himself, of being 'out' in a public place gave him a thrill.
need is sleep, as well. When he's awake, you'll want to be here."
"But like, when did he tell you about himself?"
Her eyes filled again. "But you almost didn't."
He'd been a victim too.
Actually, maybe this
"And," she added, this time the smile becoming more full, "I also wanted to tell you that Teddy's awake. He's asking for you. Andromeda already told him about Harry, but he wants you."
So posting on Monday/Friday is turning into Sunday night/Thursday night (American time). Either way, you're getting an update to read twice a week, lol. I like to keep chapters around 3k words, but this one is a bit shorter. It was just a natural breaking point, but the next one will back to around 3k. Likes and friendly reviews are most appreciated! I'd love to hear from you.
"Alex?" Harry asked, testing the spell, then nodded in satisfaction as the boy didn't answer.
Draco sighed, because she had a point. "So, Alexander and Sophia Torres Obliviated Sophia's siblings and sent them to Canada."
Harry's dark hair, usually so untamed, lay lank around his face, accentuating the grey hairs that peppered around the temples. The beard Draco loved so much had been shaved by the Healers so they'd have a better indication if and when the Stasis Charms began to fail, as Harry's beard would begin to grow again. It was a better indicator than even their monitoring charms, but Draco hated it. Harry loved that Draco loved his beard. And though Draco knew it would grow back in just a matter of a few days, it still didn't feel right.
He walked along the other arrangements, glancing at Harry. "Do you need to worry about picking something that won't make anyone else jealous? A boyfriend or girlfriend?"
Harry stared, narrowed his eyes, then smirked around the sandwich. But at least he sat down.
"Alex is kind of scared right now, so he's going to stay with your Daddy. I'll make sure you get to say goodbye before he goes, though, okay?"
"That was almost two-and-a-half years ago, actually, Lyra," Hermione corrected. "I'm surprised you remember it."
Draco's throat clenched shut at the simple words, clearer now that his husband's throat was sufficiently wet. He put the cup back down and busied himself, grabbing Harry's glasses off the table and placing them next to his hand—the Healers had removed his contact lenses when they put him under Stasis, so he probably couldn't see much of anything yet—before starting to straighten the blankets that were already perfectly straight.
Alex's grandmother knelt between him and Lyra and put a gentle hand on each of their shoulders. "The
Alex's are different from Lyra's, but they're special. The first notes play and make him bury his face in Daddy's neck as Daddy and Lyra begin to sing.
, after the immediate threat was over, Draco felt as though his chest was constricting, and he couldn't catch his breath? Why did he feel like his entire world was spinning out of control?
"I think peasants probably have more fun," she grumbled. He raised an eyebrow at her, and she giggled. "Fine. No, I'm awake, Papa. And I'm hungry. Can I have some breakfast? Can I wake Alex up and we make him pancakes like Gen and Ethan like to make? I bet he's never had those before."
And with that, he stormed out the door, the faint crack of Apparition audible through the windows.
Harry dropped his head onto Draco's shoulder, breathing heavily. "
Alex turned to Harry. "And my Daddy?"
aunt, though he'd only known her a short time. She was his last connection to his mother, who had passed the previous year; the grief of Lucius's incarceration and death had been too much for her to bear. I'd been there as he mourned Narcissa's passing, and I knew how much Andromeda's continued presence had meant to him.
The best part of living with Harry, Draco realised several days later, was that Harry was always present in the flat, even when he wasn't home.
I froze before saying that again in my head.
"I like it," Alex says, and he hopes they know he means it. Because he does like it. He
to have them.
She gave his arm an encouraging squeeze. "What is it that they say in that film? Just keep swimming?"
"It's brilliant, Potter. You should publish it," Draco insisted one night after he'd overheard Teddy and me at bedtime.
Draco squeezed, hoping he'd reassure him. "Take some time with it, but not everyone is Harry. You've had your mind set on this for a long time, but there are other paths out there."
Draco stopped moving the papers on his desk and looked up. "A little, I guess." Then suddenly it dawned on him. "Is that why you're bringing me lunch?"
fought, and it flavoured everything he did and every conversation he had.
And that was it exactly, Draco realised. That was what he was feeling. It was like they were having this discussion about a boy that Draco had already accepted into his family.
Harry shrugged. "I guess. I mean, I've only ever really worn school robes or formal robes. I'm comfortable in Muggle stuff."
"Harder than pulling him away from us now, only days after his parents were murdered before his eyes? Merlin, Harry, I can't imagine. And how can we know these supposed foster parents know how to handle that? Do they have the time? Will they care? Will they understand him?"
Draco tried one more time to make Harry understand. "Look, the problems at the manor are decades in the making. I need to take a look at the estate and see how I can make it profitable again. That's not something you can just go in and save, as much as you love doing that."
"Hasn't it?" he bit back, his voice challenging.
Harry couldn't meet his eyes. Instead, he looked back at the road and moved the little car they'd rented back into traffic.
Harry shrugged, stepping up behind Draco and resting his chin on Draco's shoulder. "Easy. A pair for recreation, a pair for work, and a pair of boots for snow and mud." Harry brushed Draco's hair out of the way where it curled at the base of his neck, then he planted a little kiss right in the crook where shoulder meets neck that turned Draco's knees to jelly.
Her big eyes were so hopeful that Harry couldn't bring himself to hurt her feelings. "Thank you, Tindles. That'd be lovely."
"So how was school? Sorry I haven't been around."
"Is Lyra mean because she's a teenager?" Alex asked quietly.
"She was upset, yes, but then she wanted to meet Alex, and she's taken him under her wing."
"It goes both ways," Harry said quietly.
"When I got bigger," Harry continued, his cadence similar to Draco's when he'd been reading the story, "I met the Weasleys, and they became my new family. They took care of me and loved me. That's Molly and Arthur. You know them."
"Not grieving. What kind of monster does that make me?"
"Stop what?" Draco asked, afraid to hear the answer. Stop fussing over him? Stop taking care of him? Stop…stop what?
"I know, but it's not really what I thought it'd be, you know? And I've been talking to the Healers, and watching, and really considering what I want to do with my life. I want to help people, but I also want a family someday." He paused and took a deep breath, and when he continued, his eyes were solemn. "I don't want to have to go through everything you and Uncle Harry have, not for something I don't particularly want anyway. Being a Healer will have its challenges, I know that. I just… I think it just feels right in a way the whole Auror thing never did, you know?"
Draco looked up at that. "And they don't know who it was?"
"Burgundy," Neville supplied. "That would look good on you, mate." He gave Harry an encouraging smile, and Harry was suddenly grateful for the other boy's supporting presence.
She shook her head. "Not yet. Anyway, we found the mother's family. Well, what's left of them. She had an older brother who passed away from a drug overdose about a year ago. There's a sister, but she's living on the streets." She closed her eyes and her jaw clenched. This was hard on her, whatever it was.
They were settled in the living room, and Alex was curled up on Draco's lap as they finished reading a book. Harry sat at the other end of the sofa and met Draco's eye. Draco nodded.
"Oh, fuck off."
"Yeah, sure," Harry answered quietly, and Draco hated that he didn't know what Harry was thinking. He always knew what Harry was thinking. That was one of the benefits of having been married so long, knowing what the other person would do or say next, but the distance of the last couple of weeks made him question everything. He consciously kept his breathing slow and steady as he poured the wine in the kitchen and brought it back to the living room, handing a glass to Harry before sitting down. There was only a foot separating them, but it felt like a mile.
I swallowed the lump in my throat and nodded, unable to muster up the 'fine' I generally responded with to such inane questions. Of course, I wasn't okay. I was twenty-nine years old, and I was going home to an empty, silent house, devoid of laughter and love.
"Later?"
She heaved a huge sigh and took a seat across from him.
We're in the second half of the story now. I originally predicted it'd be 8 chapters, but I'm working on chapter 8 right now and am not at the end just yet. I'm thinking it'll probably be about 10 chapters when complete. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and I'll be back with an update on Sunday evening.
already has a list of 'most eligible young women,'" he teased, his voice mimicking a snooty witch.
"Yes," Draco agreed from the bathroom as he picked up another flannel and wet it. He gathered a towel and a comb and made his way back to Harry's bed, sitting on the edge and finally looking at his scowling husband.
"What is it you want from me?" he finally asked, once Harry thought the silence would go on forever.
Harry shrugged. "Don't know. Never thought about it." And he hadn't. He'd heard different songs as a kid, but he couldn't identify any of them as something he liked or didn't like. Except maybe Celestina Warbeck. Ugh.
Hermione didn't stifle hers, though, and she chuckled. "I quite agree, Lyra. Healer Morrison?"
"Harry," Hermione complained when I pulled her to me, giving her a loud kiss on the cheek.
She'd known the basics. She'd known her dad was famous and a hero, and she'd known that her pa had been on the opposite side of the war, that they'd not even been friends until years later, when Teddy was a little boy.
Draco knowing didn't bother Harry as much as it would have a few months ago, so he pushed it aside to wonder about later. "So you told Lucius," he said, trying to return the conversation back to Draco.
anything." Draco was pacing now, and his shoulders were tense like he was ready to defend himself if Harry attacked. "I'm just
"If you can move without waking him, the food is Molly's."
"Okay, so, this is someone called Fiona Apple," Hermione was saying, sliding another CD into a small Muggle player Justin Finch-Fletchley had loaned them. They'd already listened to a variety of bands and musicians, both Muggle and wizarding, and they'd narrowed down that Harry tended to prefer classic and alternative rock, but none of them really got him excited.
"Just give me a minute," he said, running his hand through the boy's hair. "Let me think."
Alex nodded and closed his eyes tight, still not letting go, so Draco withdrew his wand.
"That's
Harry only nodded, though, as one of Petunia's bridge friends approached him.
Draco left me alone to wallow as I'd requested that first day after Teddy left. He Floo-called me that evening to find out what house Teddy had made — Hufflepuff, as if there'd been any doubt — and there'd been daily check-ins after that.
"No, none," I agreed. "And he seems to love it. He's making new friends and keeping up with old ones, even the ones in other houses. The boy's more popular than any kid has a right to be."
"Harry," Draco whispered when the vicar had finished. "It's time to go outside."
That he was broken.
"Yeah, that," his sister agreed cheerfully, before turning to Alex. Her green eyes were crinkled on the sides, like Daddy's always did when he was happy. "Found it."
He was so confused. It was too much information, and none of it seemed to matter. Still, he couldn't stop himself from asking, "I thought the brother was killed too. I don't understand."
Harry chuckled. "Is that what those vows were about? Now it makes sense."
"Harry said we can use his name to make it happen."
"I said it didn't clash with the stone. I didn't say I liked it."
"Draco," Harry whined, but in the bottom of his stomach was that thrill he got when Draco got like this. He refused to admit to it, though.
"Love," Harry said, so quiet that only Draco would be able to hear him, "I'll be sleeping anyway. Please. I need you to take care of yourself."
"I didn't know— It eats me up inside now, but at the time, I didn't know it was wrong. It just
Teddy sighed, his lips twitching at the edges. "Go ahead and tell him, I guess."
Draco turned to the large man, Harry's cousin who'd been the same age, who'd lived in this house while Harry slept in a cupboard under the stairs like a house-elf.
Teddy nodded, then hesitated before seeming to come to some kind of conclusion. "Harry once told me about how my dad wasn't sure he could be a father, how he thought about leaving my mum and me before I was born. It was the war, and Voldemort was in power, and, of course, he was a werewolf. Mum getting pregnant wasn't planned, and Dad got scared and ran, trying to go with Harry on his mission."
(See the end of the chapter for
, and Harry had been there, laying on the floor of some house in Scotland, and Draco. Hadn't. Known.
He nodded and squeezed her hand.
Ewwww
"Lyra, when Daddy got hurt, he saved someone."
You need to ask him, Draco.
Hermione snickered and placed her head on his shoulder. "Oh, Harry. You're going to have a blast."
A crash from the third bedroom — Harry's intended workroom for his photography — drew both of their attention. "Fuck!"
A flash interrupted, but Harry wouldn't let Draco pull away. Instead, Harry raised a hand and saluted the camera with a V of his fingers. Because as far as he was concerned, anyone who didn't like what they were seeing could fuck off.
might have an extra clue.
But Potter was right there, having moved soundlessly while Draco read, and now he was looming, standing in Draco’s personal space. And was he sniffing him?
"Maybe I can take you to dinner, too?"
She sat back and smiled.
"Relax. You're part of the group, and Granger won't let anything happen to you." He grinned and nodded in Ron's direction, where an unreasonably tall woman with an Adam's apple ran a finger up Harry's best friend's arm. "Besides, would you miss this?"
Draco sighed. "Listen. I've done everything I can to show you I've changed, and I thought we were becoming friends. Or at least not-enemies."
Harry shushed her. "This is how they do things, sweetie. He already stayed with you and Papa longer than they wanted him to."
"But then this came from Andi," he said and held out the letter, watching her scan the words. "And Harry's not home, and Teddy—"
"Why would it—"
Draco looked at Hermione, hoping for an explanation. She pushed a chair up for the child, helping him to sit, and then she sighed and rounded the bed. Narcissa got up and offered her chair making Hermione smile, the gratitude clear on her face.
While the floor of the cupboard was completely bare — no boxes, no cleaning supplies, just empty — the walls were not. Crayon drawings lined the back wall like cave drawings — childish drawings of animals and jungles, wolves, stags, and large black dogs. Pushed to the back of the cupboard, packed up tight against the wall where Draco hadn't seen it at first, was what appeared to be an old camp cot, the kind that folded down with no mattress, just canvas on sticks.
Ginny patted Dean's knee then moved to the bench next to Harry, taking his hand. "You deserve to be happy too."
He pushed her off him, giggling. "I am not a baby."
"Cornish pasties. Will that work?"
"I'm sorry I broke down. I'm really tired, I think," Draco said, hoping to brush past the embarrassment. "Let me clean you up a little? I think it'll make you feel better."
"Yeah." He dropped his hand and sighed. "And then he went off and nearly got himself killed. We talked a little when he woke up, but this is still hanging out there."
"Nope. I just decided what it is I like, what makes me happy."
"Arithmancy is hard, but you're smart and like to learn, so I think you'll do well. I didn't take Ancient Runes, but Vic did. She always seemed to like it." He let her sit in silence for a few minutes, and she could feel his eyes on her.
Draco swallowed. "Yes. Yes, he did."
"Okay," Harry said, unsure of what Draco had in mind.
"I've talked to lots of people," Harry said, confused, because, well, duh.
The sun was setting when I Apparated home, my growling stomach reminding me of my missed midday meal. I stepped through my back garden gate, thinking through what I had in my pantry for supper when a voice stopped me.
he was my friend.
Alex's smile made her shoulders relax. Little brothers could be a bother, but hers was nice to be around. Usually. It was probably because she got to pick him out instead of being stuck with whatever nature cursed her with, or so she teased.
"I don't know," she said irritably, standing up and beginning to pace. "Maybe about how he grew up abused by Dudley's parents? Or the fact that he nearly died almost every year in school? Or better yet, how about the fact that he
done tours in the past, which made sense. You had Teddy at home and you needed to be here. But he's at Hogwarts now."
Harry watched Draco closely, waiting for the questions, the reactions, the rejections. Draco had promised nothing would be different, but it already was. He could see it in Draco's eyes.
And Harry was just waiting for it all to fall apart.
away in disgust. The Hogwarts Express rumbled quietly in the background, an accompaniment to the irritation stirring in his stomach.
"Harry," Draco's voice was soft and careful, "I care."
"The power to do this was theirs all along, of course, but sometimes you need to be reminded you can hope for something more. You need someone to show you the bridge.
They changed the subject, and Draco sighed in contentment as their relationship fell back into its normal rhythm. This was good, and Harry would talk eventually. He just wasn't ready yet.
He took another deep breath and let out a little moan of pleasure that nearly made Draco’s cock twitch. It didn’t, because he was fucking professional, but
"I think she approves."
"What about the rest of the family's things," Draco asked quietly, remembering Harry's lack of any of his parents' belongings. "We can't just leave everything there to be thrown away."
"Breathe in, dammit. Look at me."
The hand moving to his head made it worse. Harry was comforting him, combing his gentle fingers through Draco's hair in the way that usually made him purr. Now, though, it just reminded him how much he didn't deserve this man.
"Why does it bother you?"
Lyra sucked in a breath. "What happened?"
Draco watched Harry carefully. The emotions were so clear on his face. Disgust, fear, sadness, irritation, anger.
Thanks for reading! Come find me on
He Apparated to their favourite Indian restaurant, the one they'd frequented since the early days of their relationship but didn't get to as much now that they'd moved from London, and picked up all of their favourites: Keema Matar Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Lamb Biryani. He kept them under a warming charm, opened a bottle of wine to breathe, then sat down on the sofa to wait.
I could feel my pulse racing, and I wondered if Draco could see how terrified I was. Because I hadn't considered this. I hadn't even realised I felt this way until I thought he was no longer available. I'd been prepared to stand aside. There'd been no risk involved except my own, but this would be a step neither of us could come back from.
"Ah." Draco pulled another chair up and looked into the boy's watery eyes which were beginning to droop. "It took me a long time to learn that too, little bug." He held out his arms for the boy. "Would you like me to hold you for a bit?"
"Harry!" Dudley's voice came from the end of the hallway, but Harry ignored him and escaped into the empty kitchen. Breathe. He had to breathe. He dropped his hands to his knees and leant against the countertop, closing his eyes. Breathe.
Harry laughed, relaxing a little. "I like natural colours, I think. Uh, greens and blues and stuff. And, of course, red and gold," he couldn't resist adding. "Well, maybe not the gold, but that wine colour, you know?"
Harry turned to him, sputtering. "Merlin, Draco, they've already had me all over the front page every day this week. 'Potter Declines Auror Corps, the story of the month! What will happen to our bloody world without him?' For fuck's sake."
Draco snorted, irritated. "He's just being stubborn and trying to push his way of things, and in this case, he's overstepping."
"No!" Lyra cried, her eyes wide.
So he drank, but in the process, he realised his hand was shaking and he managed to spill the tepid tea on his shirt. He couldn't bring himself to care.
"Yeah, okay," Harry said finally. "Yes. Thank you."
Harry blushed and mumbled something.
Draco felt his chest tighten, but he knew he'd feel better if they finally got this over with. "I'm ready if you are. But I think I might like a glass of wine first. Do you want one too?"
"I keep them separated by season and occasion. It won't look like this many when I'm done," Draco explained. "The bigger question is, how do you exist with only three pairs?"
"I know," Harry echoed and squeezed Draco's hand. "Me too."
It wasn't until nearly nine o'clock that Draco began to get concerned. Harry had said he might be late coming home, and it was a Thursday, which meant that he sometimes met Ron after work at the Leaky for a pint or put in an extra few hours on paperwork to get it completed before the weekend. It wasn't out of the ordinary.
Taking a deep breath, Alex looked at the large, looming double doors. He wasn't sure if he could do this. He was only five, after all, and five-year-olds were too young to get into trouble for sneaking around manors.
Draco stepped outside to sit on their new veranda in his plush, outdoor armchair with a glass of wine. Merlin, he was turning into a fucking Hufflepuff, wasn't he? They'd been living together less than a week and already he was coming to depend on Harry's constant presence. Harry's current assignment would only keep him gone for two days, Neville having hired Harry to photograph some specimens to submit to Herbology Quarterly. He was sometimes gone for a couple of weeks at a time when he was deep in a project, especially now that he'd caught the eye of the art community and his nature photography was in demand, so two days was hardly anytime at all.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hermione," Draco said with a smile, welcoming her inside. "Is something wrong with your Floo?"
"I don't know whether to be afraid for Alex or excited for Lyra," Draco muttered.
"That's great." He meant it.
"Draco?" Hermione fell to the floor in front of her sitting room fireplace. "What's wrong?"
hated it. Cramped spaces weren't good either.
Draco stepped closer and Hermione saw him, said something to the woman and child, then stood and gestured him over.
One person seemed to be missing, though, and Harry's eyes wouldn't stop searching.
Draco's eyes filled with tears. He couldn't help it; he loved her so much, and he was so scared. "Not really, baby, but I will be."
"Our baby won't look like a mandrake."
"I was," Draco agreed, deciding to lay his cards out on the table. It wasn't something he did often, but it felt right this time. "I'm trying to understand."
"Hermione said the publishers want you to do a book tour."
Draco's door stood open, and when Harry hesitated, Draco's posh voice rang out, "Merlin, Potter, I'm not going to seduce you. Just get in here."
Draco froze. The man on the bed looked…unexpected. His dark, usually messy hair was longer than it usually looked in the newspapers, but it was the scruffy beard and piercing green eyes that had something in Draco’s stomach twisting uncomfortably.
He feels his face get hot. It's kind of embarrassing to have a song, but Lyra has special songs too. There's one that Daddy sings to her when she's upset and one he sings her when he's happy and they're playing.
"Harry," Draco tried again.
Harry sighed. "Well, this is fun. Have they been like this all week?"
"What the fuck?"
"She has another family whose job it is to take care of kids until they have a family to live with all the time. They're very nice, and they're super excited to meet you."
"Beef stew today. I used fresh vegetables from Molly's garden."
Draco watched the boy, watched
Fine. He could do this. "How did you know you were really gay? I mean, you must be sure if you went through all that and risked losing your family."
"For luncheon," Kreacher agreed.
I looked around the house: mess was beginning to accumulate in my weeks of inactivity, calling out to me. I'd just not been able to bring myself to care enough to do anything about it.
Werewolf.
It was nearly two weeks later, while Harry, Lyra, and Alex were watching a Christmas movie and Draco was working on dinner, that the news came.
"Well, yeah, us. How's your stomach from yesterday? Did the canteen's soup bother you too much?"
Something seemed to flash in Draco's eyes for just a moment, but it was gone so quickly I thought I'd imagined it. "Your friends all love you, Potter. You're an idiot."
"This is a wand. Have you ever seen one before?"
Harry whirled on him. "That's what you think this is? That I just feel the need to save things and am compelled to help?" His voice was harsh. "Gods, Draco, you'd think after fifteen years together, you'd understand me better than that."
Pansy hurried into his closet and brought him his favourite, softest trousers and another one of Harry's jumpers. He'd kiss her if he could bring himself to show any emotion, but it was all he could do to hold himself together at the moment. Instead, he let her cast a quick spell on his hair, cleaning it and settling it neatly, and then reached for his shoes.
Harry considered. Draco didn't really have a lot of other options. With Lucius in Azkaban, Narcissa and Draco Malfoy were barely tolerated amongst the wizarding public after the war and had finally just melted away into the background. Harry hadn't really thought about him in a couple of years.
Draco removed Harry's undershirt and pants, and urged Harry into the shower. The water was perfect, streaming over him and washing away the ache that was lingering around the edges of his body. Draco joined him moments later, letting the water darken his blond hair and fall down his back. Then Draco turned and wrapped himself around Harry.
"Are we allowed to throw your name around to make it happen?"
"Harry," a smooth voice came from behind me. "Are you going to be okay?"
"What are you doing?" Draco asked when Harry got close and the room seemed to grow quiet.
Whatever.
"It wasn't that much to lose, honestly," Draco said, and Harry looked over to see the other boy's face twist.
We made it! If this is your first time reading the series, the next story in the timeline is
"So I'm always told," I said, and the snarl in my voice irritated me even more. "Just, give me a few days. Please."
Teddy scowled. "Moaning over me, more like. But I'm glad you're here now. You'll scare them away."
Draco only raised an eyebrow.
Oh, Merlin.
"Which is sexier, long hair or short hair?"
"A few more hours, probably, but they're going to keep him here to monitor for a couple of days to make sure there are no side effects."
"Hi, Alex," Harry said with a warm smile and quiet voice. "I'm glad to see you're okay. Lyra was telling me all about playing with you. Thank you for taking care of her while I've been sick."
"Hermione," Draco said quietly, "can you take Lyra and Helen out for a few minutes? I want to talk to Harry."
"Draco asked us to come," Luna quietly answered. "We thought you might need your friends."
"But…?"
"Shoes?" Harry asked with a smirk.
Her eyes grew wide. "Like, make them dead?"
"He's getting married. Her name is Makena. He's having a ceremony here in England and then another in Kenya with her family near where they'll be living."
"Draco."
Draco swallowed, but if Harry wasn't there, that means he was somewhere else. And that was good. He wasn't lying dead in some house in northern England.
The music began a light, bouncing tune, and Harry's mouth dropped open at the words.
Harry stepped closer to take the offered seat, getting a closer look at Draco, his first since their return from the holidays. His shoulders were more relaxed, his hair looked softer, and his grey eyes jumped out at Harry, looking larger and deeper than he'd ever seen them, almost like liquid mercury. Was that…eyeliner? Harry swallowed, trying not to think about that, but Draco took the seat next to him, and when the Slytherin draped an arm over Ron on his other side, Harry's eyes widened.
Alex shook his head and yawned, then laid back down on his pillow.
"I'll eat this tonight. I think soup sounds wonderful."
Alex turned his head to look at her, still wrapped around Draco's neck. The soft curls tickled Draco's cheek, reminding him of Lyra when she was upset.
In the first days after Draco's and my discussion, when I'd decided to start living once again for myself, for the first time in my life I didn't think about my future as being something others could form for me. I spent those hours cleaning the house and trimming the hedges thinking about what I wanted in my future, considering who I wanted to be.
He was mimicking Draco. And why wouldn't he? Draco was the one who taught him how to use the Black family imperiousness to get what he wanted. It was only fitting that this child, this
He gave a small nod and picked up a muffin. "So now what?"
"What's nice?" Harry asked, still watching his friend near the stage.
Harry's arms encircled his boyfriend automatically, but he wasn't sure what was happening. He thought Draco was trying to comfort him, but then he realised Draco's face was pressed into his shoulder and he was shaking, little sobs washing away in the falling water.
I loved him.
"You're not a monster. Feelings aren't always rational."
Draco grinned, making Harry's stomach bubble in excitement. "Then get on with it. The man has a picture to take."
Draco changed his angle, and Harry's mind managed to focus long enough to realise his body was reacting in a very not-friendly-like way. He pulled his face to the side, and Draco's mouth began to nibble along the side of Harry's mouth. "Draco," Harry said, his voice barely audible. "Draco," he tried again.
"Hand me the catalogue."
“He is. He asked Mr Potter when he picked me up from Al’s last weekend.”
Hermione suddenly looked so annoyed, he considered grabbing his wand, sure he was about to be hexed.
"Fuck," Harry muttered, glancing at his phone display. "Who the hell would be calling me on a Saturday morning?"
The flat was silent when they returned home, the light over the stove that Harry always kept lit casting shadows over the darkened room. Neither had said much since they'd left Surrey, but the words left unspoken hung between them like a fog.
Potter's brow furrowed. "I didn't. Kreacher did that on his own."
Harry's head fell back and his eyes closed as Draco wrapped his hand around his erection. "Fuck."
Alex tightened his hold, and Draco looked at Hermione, feeling helpless.
Harry pulled back and nodded, rubbing his hands over his face as a couple of cars pulled into the driveway of the house. "They're here. We should go in."
Hermione turned to look at the little boy who was now sitting on the other woman's lap, asleep. Her voice turned quiet and maternal. "Little Alex, there, is our witness to the uncle's attack on the family. He's traumatised, and we're having to be very careful with how we ask questions, but he's answering how he can. Children are unreliable witnesses in court, but they still see and hear things that can help."
"It's okay," Draco said quietly, watching as Harry slowly crossed the room. "
"Okay, let's start with clothing," Draco began. "You prefer Muggle clothing over robes, I assume?"
"I told you, you can call her Charlie. She prefers that."
"Mmm…" Draco let his head fall to the side. "Our friends are going to know what we're doing in here."
The song continued, and Draco flounced across the stage, singing at the top of his lungs, putting such feeling into each lyric. The entire pub was cheering and singing along, and Harry's chest grew with pride. Pride for his friend, pride for the decisions his friend had helped him make, pride for the next steps Harry had just decided to embark upon.
I sat across from him on the first day of training, confused and suspicious. We were no longer rivals, but we weren't friends either, and his sudden desire to enter law enforcement seemed incongruous with the Draco Malfoy I knew.
"Merlin, this is going to be a disaster," Draco muttered, opening the door. "No, because that wouldn't be what
Draco moved his hand, revelling in the familiar weight and texture of his husband. He slipped his thumb over the slit and swirled it around, something that generally drove the other man mad.
He nodded because he honestly expected nothing less.
She chuckled. "How is everyone?"
"That he'll get us a message somehow?"
"Gods, yes. I want to see her too. And I want to see Alex, if you think you can bring him along. I want him to see I'm okay." He yawned. "Hermione says I owe him a thank you."
He sat up quickly, cursing himself. He'd clearly taken it too far, but he refused to lie. "You don't have to worry about that, though. Your dad is the best bad-guy-fighter there is. He saved Alex, didn't he? He wouldn't let anything happen to any of us. And you have so much family that loves you, you'd always have people to take care of you."
"If Lyra's my sister, will she share her paints with me?"
Draco smiled. Molly loved that Alex had picked that name up from Lyra, Rose, and Hugo already.
"Oh?" Dad said, looking pleased but trying not to show it. "So, there's no one you like? No boy or girl for you?"
He did. He was having a blast. They'd had four rounds of drinks, each taking a turn buying, and the warm buzz had taken away the panic Harry had felt from the unknown, busy pub with its karaoke and beautiful men. He'd even had a chance to flirt and be flirted with when he'd gone to the bar to buy one of the rounds. Twice, and by two different men! He'd flirted back, or tried to anyway, but the excitement he'd felt that night with Draco just wasn't there.
"Who'd then publish it because it was
"Well, it smells wonderful," Harry answered with a forced smile, not denying his boyfriend's point.
"Uh, would you like some?" Draco asked, trying to mask the awkwardness of someone's elf bringing him an unsolicited gift.
When the TedMagicSummit invited Harry to give a talk on Hope in Edinburgh this year, Harry had been unsure. His books featuring Amil, the boy whose name literally meant "hope", were wildly popular, of course. Now that Harry did a publicity tour each year, he was becoming a household name for parents of school-aged children in both the Muggle and magical worlds, not for what he'd done as a teenager, but for what he was creating as an adult. But Harry was still, and always would be, a private man.
And dammit, I needed to call Simon.
—who was busy snogging his girlfriend in his hospital bed.
Her quiet reassurance calmed Draco slightly, so he stood, went to the closet and pulled on Harry's favourite jumper for comfort, and then followed his husband's best friend to the Floo.
be okay, you know. You don't have to do it all by yourself."
"What?" Harry yelled. "Draco!"
"Where are we going?"
And Merlin knew he wanted Potter. He always had.
hadn’t caught wind of this, Draco didn’t know, but he was trained by both his parents and his profession to hide his reaction, so he simply nodded as if he understood and closed the folder.
Draco saw his son flinch at his grandfather’s comment.
But now he was curled into Draco like a Crup seeking warmth. His thumb was hanging from his mouth as he slept.
"Draco," I moaned, and he wrapped me in his arms.
Draco sat down in the chair, situating them both comfortably, then looked at Harry. "Angelina said the night he stayed at the house and I was here, he barely slept the entire night, and when he did, he woke screaming."
"Your daughter just learned all about your roles in the war, including the information from the biography that arsehole, Breddings, did a couple of years ago. And you don't think that is the cause of your daughter's suddenly strange behaviour towards you?"
And that was another thing. Harry tried to understand that it was important to Draco and Tindles that Tindles be allowed to come here and care for them. Harry had worked with Draco to compromise, to allow the elf to come and do the extra work, like laundry and floors and bathrooms. He did his best to honour Draco's and Tindles' wishes, to not do those things so that Tindles had work to do a few nights a week. So why couldn't Draco honour Harry's wishes to just throw the damned trash away when he was done cooking and wipe up after himself?
“Are you in pain?”
Draco simply stared, baffled, but he understood. If there was anything that Harry was insecure about, it was people wanting to be his family. "Well, we'll have to ask him, of course."
"His name is Draco, and he doesn't need your food.
But Harry was gone, closing the door gently behind him. The light click of the door echoed through Draco's chest louder than any angry door slam.
"Right, well, uh, can I help you with something?"
"Teddy—"
Draco made a little noise, but Harry left his eyes shut and leant his head back on the chair. '
"Fine."
"And does that make your mother my family? Because the last time I checked, she was my mother-in-law, the grandmother to our daughter, and the aunt to my godchild. She's my family too. So, what's your fucking problem?"
The sound Dudley made was reminiscent of an injured animal. "
"Leave him alone, love. He's just thinking deep thoughts; aren't ya, Harry?" Dean grinned and wrapped his arm around Ginny when she sat next to him.
, but my brain wasn't firing correctly.
Draco's heart twisted. Their Teddy. He nodded. "Do I look all right? I don't want to upset him or anything."
But Harry was opening the door and getting out, so Draco could only follow. He watched as Harry hurried over to the house, his shoulders stiff, his movements automatic as though each step were an effort. Dudley and Susanne unlocked the door and went inside, but Harry stood on the front step, staring.
"I want to be, yes," Draco said, a lump in his throat.
"He doesn't. We wanted to talk to you first. But now it's his turn. Teddy's going to take you to Grammy Andromeda's for a while."
"So this thing with Kreacher..." Draco began, taking a bite of his fish. It
"Lower your voice. You're going to wake Lyra." Draco kept his own voice level and even, hoping to get through his husband's thick skull.
Harry had said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry's voice was quiet, but his eyes were serious. "Draco, they're trained for this. I'm sure Hermione wouldn't let him go to just anyone."
And Harry simply wanted to help.
"She really does hate me, Draco. I figured it out."
"Any crushes?"
"What the hell is this place?" Harry yelled over the din, trying to get Draco's attention. But everyone was trying to get Draco's attention, it seemed. Because Draco looked completely fit in his perfectly tailored grey trousers and soft, black jumper, and the eyeliner he'd taken to wearing almost constantly was thicker, drawing Harry's eyes to Draco's.
Harry fell back onto his seat, pushing the
Unlike the fucking smoochy faces we have to watch with you and plant man?
little brother, so that will make him special. And I'll be able to teach him all about how to be a Malfoy-Potter."
"Alex's song!" Lyra yells too loudly.
Draco put his hand on Teddy's shoulder. "They are definitely heroes. But you both did what you could, and you saved Alex."
"Ron, stop it." Hermione gave an exasperated sigh. "Harry, you and Ginny know you're not engaged, nor are you likely to—"
"Thanks, Luna."
"Draco—" Harry's voice was rough and he stopped to clear his throat. "I know what I want. And I think you do too."
Harry wondered how he should take that, but then Draco's eyes slowly ran over Harry's body and when they met Harry's again, there was a definite gleam. Oh.
"Okay," he said seriously, and waved his wand, putting up a barrier from eavesdroppers.
The silence that followed made Harry sit up and watch the other boy. Draco was staring, his eyes narrowed and his brow furrowed.
Harry looked up, and he looked so young. Draco was suddenly reminded of that little first year that he met in Madam Malkins' shop in the overgrown clothes and taped glasses.
So you can what? Can I watch?
"You sound like a therapist," Dudley said with a little laugh.
Dudley took a deep breath and nodded. "The vicar suggested we greet people as they arrive, allowing them to give their condolences. Then he'll start the service before moving to the graveside. They'll be buried here in the churchyard."
Just Dad.
Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Grunge, huh? Okay, let's try…" She started rifling through the pile, but Theo slid one to the top and pushed it to her.
"I have two teams on the case trying to find out what happened. If Teddy wakes up—"
Harry glanced at the phone number again, still not recognising it. "Dudley, it's Harry. How'd you get this number?"
She took a deep breath and prepared herself. "Why didn't you ever tell me about the war?"
"Dessert."
"He's here?" Her eyes grew big, and she looked around, interested.
"And after?" I could hear the hope in my voice.
Harry's rough, quiet voice woke Draco from his fitful sleep and had him bolting upright in his sleep chair. "Harry?"
Her eyes were burning now, and she started biting her nails, which was a terrible habit and she hated it, but she didn't care right now.
"Stop it," Pansy's voice cut him off, a cup of tea suddenly appearing in his hands. "Granger's teams are tracking the coin. You've saved them hours, Draco." He looked down at the teacup in front of him, wondering what he was supposed to do with it. "Drink."
Draco Malfoy stood before him. The Slytherin with the Amazing Arse. And he looked equally as stunned to see Harry.
"Yes. Make them dead. When someone kills somebody else on purpose, it's called murder."
"No," Alex finally said, his voice ringing through the room louder than Draco had heard it yet, but it sounded panicked.
"Okay. Pansy's been begging me to spend some time with her. I'll go over there today." He stood up and kissed Harry's temple. "I'm just going to shower and get dressed. But Harry?"
"No, she doesn't." She
Alex cried louder, and Draco picked the boy up, pulling him into his lap. Small arms wrapped around his neck. Alex was shaking, crying, continuing to call for his mother.
I jerked my head up, nearly giving myself whiplash. Draco was sitting in his chair waiting for me, and he looked terrible. His hair was standing on end in places like it did when he ran his hands through it with worry. His mouth was taut, and his eyes sad.
Harry stared at him, searching for something that Draco could only guess, but when he spoke, his voice was thoughtful. "It won't be easy. The Healers say I'm not going to be back to normal for a few weeks. And your work is going to fall behind."
"I need you too." And he did.
They're not the same as his Mamá and Papá were, of course. Alex doesn't really remember them much, his Mamá and Papá, except sometimes in dreams, but he feels like he remembers them because of all the pictures he has. Daddy and Papa gave him books of pictures, and they talked to Mamá and Papá's friends and got lots of stories about them. They put them in the book so that he can go look at them whenever he wants, and when he's bigger, he'll be able to read the stories all by himself.
"No," he whispered, and he was so close now that I could see the flecks of blue in his otherwise grey eyes.
Not even home yet and she was already in trouble.
I rolled my eyes and handed my friend his preferred glass of wine before I sat down with my beer, ready to watch the football match on the telly.
"Now," Morrison continued, "I want you to remember what happened when Harry came to save you. You don't have to think of the bad stuff, just remember what Harry looked like when he came in the first time." The Healer swirled his wand close to the boy's temple. "Good, Alex. You're doing really great. Think about what Harry's shirt looked like."
But Malfoy —
And there it was again.
"I was waiting. I hoped you'd be ready eventually, and I'd be here when you were."
"Molly said he's been napping with Lyra," he said, confused. "And I woke up with him curled into my back earlier. I don't think he wants to be alone. I mean, he can use Teddy's old bedroom if they insist, but—"
"Gram already brought it up, actually. Evidently, it's normal after what I've been through, and they think it'll be back to normal tomorrow. So tell me what happened? After Harry sent me away? No one will say much, only that Harry's hurt, but that they've figured out how to help him." He paused, and he sounded very young when he continued, not at all like a young man in his second year of Auror training. "That makes it sound like they didn't know how to help him at first."
Harry laughed. "Yeah, I know." He hesitated. "You didn't have to do all this, you know. I'm glad you did, but you didn't have to. Thank you."
Harry narrowed his eyes but kept silent.
"We sent a team to the location of the report…" Hermione's voice grew quiet, and Draco met her eyes.
He was there for me when I needed a night out, when I needed to remind myself that I was only twenty-three, that life continued to go on outside of bedtime stories and ABCs. He was there to encourage me as I searched for a new career, something I could do for myself while staying home and raising an amazing child.
"And that's it?" Harry asked, restless irritation bubbling up inside him. "
(See the end of the chapter for
Teddy, the boy who'd tried so hard to be like Draco when he was small. Teddy, who brought Harry and Draco together, who taught Draco what it was like to be a family. Their Teddy, who—
Draco put everything back into the basket, his stomach twisting at Potter's expression. They usually ate lunch together, and as much as he wanted to try the delightful basket of food, he didn't like how it made him feel. "Wait!"
"Hey!"
Harry shrugged. "No, but I'm talking with McGonagall next week. She's going to help me come up with some ideas, things she thinks I'll be good at that I might not have considered." He hesitated, remembering their conversation, and his stomach warmed. "She says she's proud of me for speaking up and making a change."
"What do you
Draco gasped as Harry pulled back and reached for Draco's trousers, deftly opening the top and grasping his prize, his warm, familiar hand feeling so utterly perfect. "Yes. Merlin, yes."
"Yeah…" Ginny said, clearly bored with his litany. "So…"
The lies just kept pouring out of his son, and Draco wasn’t sure whether to be impressed at Scorpius’s earnest face or frightened.
Potter closed his eyes, then slowly brought his hands up over his nose, breathing into his palms. “I need a potion,” he said, and his voice sounded as though it were being forced through extreme pain. “I need to make this easier.”
And then they stepped into their cosy kitchen and froze.
Does anyone else imagine Draco as Lucy in the Peanuts
Like I said. Empathy. He always knew what I was feeling without ever having to ask. It was never, "Are you okay?" He knew I wasn't, so I didn't have to prevaricate.
Teddy's awake! 💛 What do ya think he's thinking? Those of you who read the final chapter of
"Yeah, okay. Tell Molly I'm taking Lyra up to her room to talk. At least that will lessen the noise level."
Instead, he walked into the sterile-smelling hospital room and stared at the person who formed the cornerstone of that family lying unconscious on the bed. It seemed like days ago instead of just a matter of hours since he'd walked in to see Teddy in another room, the same monitoring charms displayed above his unconscious body.
"He did?" She sat up, sounding interested. "Who was it? Someone we know?"
Draco choked down a laugh. "No. Why don't you talk to Lyra, and I'll go to Alex and Molly."
So, most of the angst is passed, but there will still be a few bumps as we close in on the end of the story. I hope it's not been too heavy for you all. Do you like the angstier turn of this story amidst all the fluff of the others?
Draco glared at his boyfriend. "Sit down with that like someone who wasn't born in a barn, would you please?"
"Fine. Send it to a Muggle publisher. I bet you they'll buy it."
Draco sighed. "Please tell me what you're thinking. I don't care if you think it's stupid or that I won't understand," he said, and he didn't even cringe at the note of begging in his voice. He was just so worried. "Michelle always says that you have to get your feelings out before they can begin making sense."
Harry rolled his eyes at the jab and grabbed for the disc in Draco's hands, putting it back on his pile. "You're ridiculous. I know what you're going to say, but you're wrong. It's not angsty."
He was there for me then, and he was there for now, as I went home alone after dropping that child off for his first Hogwarts adventure, and the darkness that I generally kept at bay was creeping into the edges of my psyche.
Engagement ring?
that?"
"Just be here," Harry said quietly, then he set his jaw and reached for the door.
Harry shook his head. "Can I be alone for a while? Please?" His voice sounded so small, like a young child unsure of himself, not like the confident man Draco had come to know so well.
"I was out of line."
When that changed, when they'd decided to actually try to have a relationship, they were overly careful around one another. Harry wouldn't keep any of his things at the manor, always leaving before either could fall asleep or get too comfortable. Draco followed his lead and did the same, escaping through the Floo of Grimmauld Place late at night like he was afraid of being caught.
"Sure," Luna answered, and the look she gave Ginny was radiant — and extremely pleased with herself. "So?"
"Us?"
Harry huffed out a little laugh and entered, pausing a moment to look around. The essentials of the room were the same as Harry's and the others': a bed, window, fireplace, desk, and armchair. The rest, though, was bright and lush. Photographs of Draco's friends were framed around the room, and a beautiful landscape hung over the fireplace. The armchair had been charmed to have pinstripes running through it, and throw pillows adorned it, the bed, and a large cushion in the other corner that looked ripe for relaxing.
Teddy's voice sounded sharp, and Draco replayed his words in his head.
Draco knew better than to argue with her, so he considered her words as he took Lyra home. 'Together,' she'd said, and dammit if that didn't hit a little too close. He and Harry had always, since those first few months, agreed to take things on together. To go through life as partners.
"Since I have the wrong bits?" Ginny interrupted with a snort. "Yeah. Maybe you should tell
"This is our spot," he said quietly. "It helps me think."
Draco closed the kitchen window so Lyra wouldn't notice he'd been listening when she came in from the garden. Merlin, it was hard keeping the family running sometimes, but at least he was good at it.
Potter turned.
"They wish they could," Harry added. "I know they do. They wish they could be here so much."
"This sucks," Harry muttered, getting into bed that evening. "Everyone's told me teenagers are hard, but what the fuck? She was fine in April."
Potter’s nostrils flared, and Draco felt the unexplained urge to take a step backwards, to flee, but those green eyes begged for him to come closer.
And then the people came. And his face went blank.
He turned around, and Draco's grey eyes were soft now, almost understanding.
"Still. I'm sorry she's such a—"
At the ball.
Draco stood and began to walk the floor with the boy, shushing quietly and rubbing his small back. He found himself bouncing slightly like he had when Lyra was an infant. This child wasn't an infant, but the movement must have brought some comfort as he began to quiet, his sobs decreasing into soft whimpers.
So, when Molly dropped in shortly after eleven, he wanted to kiss his pseudo-mother-in-law.
It was amazing how much more Harry felt like his own person in new clothes. From the moment he put them on in the morning to the moment he took them off, he thought about what made him choose that particular item of clothing and it made him smile. This shirt brought out his eyes, or those trousers made his arse look good, or the jumper just felt
That was the day I began to understand the fickleness of hope, and it was the day I understood that there was a much larger world around me that I had never accounted for.
"Right, so, uh, flowers. I wanted to buy flowers for my partner. I bit her head off this morning and need to grovel."
Draco stuck his head out from the master bedroom at the shout. Theo was in the flat's living room surrounded by a pile of boxes, using his wand to unshrink a few more. "Reference books in the spare bedroom since that will double as my office. Recreational reading there on the wall with all the built-in shelves."
Harry ran his fingers over the petals of a pretty, white and purple lily, one of the only flowers he did recognise, as he had a smaller version of the flower tattooed on his collarbone. But that wasn't right for today's bouquet. Lilies seemed so formal, and Susan was anything but formal.
That caught my attention, and I nearly strained my neck turning so quickly. Ron was grinning, his ears red in the dim firelight, and Hermione, sitting between his knees, had a sly smile on her face.
He hesitated. "It's okay to
But Draco didn't understand; he thought Harry was just being a stubborn, Muggle-raised wizard who didn't understand elves. And maybe he didn't understand them, not really, but it made his stomach ill to give the little elf orders. Even when she begged for them.
He felt the floor crash into his knees, which was odd, but not nearly as odd as the feeling of the world closing in on him. He vaguely felt hands on his shoulders, holding him up.
"A baby," I whispered. Holy fuck. My best friends and a baby?
and a baby.
Alex simply stood.
Harry hummed thoughtfully, slipping his shirt over his head and tossing it into the basket in the corner. "She didn't want to come in and say hi?"
were okay.
Lyra was the primary source, tears running down her face as she sat in the corner. "It's not fair!" she babbled over and over through her tears.
Draco smiled, and his eyes lit up. Or maybe it was the light of the fire. Definitely just the light.
"No, you didn't. I was going to come back and do it myself when I got the chance. Or Tindles would have done it when she came by tonight."
He got down really close and could see several familiar faces. Below Grandmother were Papa and Daddy, a beautiful golden branch tying them together. And below them was a young girl, her hair the colour of Papa's and their aunt Luna's — Lyra had grown in Aunt Luna's tummy, after all — and her eyes the colour of Daddy's, a grass-like green. But next to her…
Harry's heart started beating so loudly he was sure Draco could hear it from where he sat.
"What do we do now?" I asked after a moment, wanting to gather him close, to sink into him again and never surface.
and maybe, while we're at it, we'll find you some boy to get off with in the loo."
"Sure, all of them, if you like. But I think we all three know you're talking about Malfoy."
"Then what's going on?"
Pansy raised an eyebrow and shot a knowing look at Hermione. "Draco came back last week."
Harry pulled his knees up and dropped his head to rest on them. "Sure. Thank you."
"And I didn't interrupt anything romantic between you."
"No, baby, he's at the hospital. They're working on fixing him up."
"Hey, we're taking a break to eat," Harry said, popping his messy head into the closet. "Ginny went to get some sandwiches and chips from the shop up the road. Can you help me set up the dining table so we have a place to sit?"
I forced a smile, trying to feel bright and happy, then turned to find Hermione sweeping me into a huge hug.
"Me?"
"Harry?" Dudley said after a few moments, and Harry realised he must have been silent for at least a minute or so. "Are you still there?"
His throat was on fire, the tears fighting to escape. "Yeah. That's good." She held out a cup of tea and Harry took it, unable to deny Luna anything. "Where's Draco?" he asked, forcing down a small sip. It helped.
"Went to talk to Dudley," Ginny said. She laid her head on Harry's shoulder. "I can't believe you came back here. You're so fucking brave."
Harry wandered out from his workroom and blinked at the early summer sun pouring through the large windows. The kitchen smelled divine — Draco didn't cook often, but when he did, it was always good — and a single glass of wine was waiting on the kitchen island.
"Yeah, we'll go together. Does that sound better?" Draco asked.
She took his hand and squeezed. "He hadn't cried more than a few tears since we'd found them. He needed it."
Her face hardened. "Step back. I'm coming through. Ron!" he heard her yell before he pulled out of the fire and sat down on the rug. He could hardly function, the rush of fear settling into a firm, pulsing dread in his chest.
She took a deep breath, but when her voice came out, it was steady. "He'd been hit twice. The first appears to have been a Severing Charm; it nearly took off his right arm. The second was a Withering Curse. It seems to have hit him fully on his torso."
"Oh." Alex couldn't help himself, his fingers giving in to the itch to trace the lines of the long branches that swirled across the trapestry, ending in the faces of people he didn't know. He tried to read the names of the people he could see. "Who is Reg… Regu…" He couldn't pronounce the name, and he gave up helplessly.
"Was it really that bad, then?" Harry's voice was soft when he spoke after a while. "How long was I out?"
"Water. Please." Harry's eyes were scrunched closed against the dim light.
"You're his family," Draco said quietly. Because as much as he'd never met this Dudley and only vaguely knew there was a cousin, he knew what family meant to Harry. Of course, Harry would want to be there. "I really am sorry about your parents. We'll see you soon."
Draco tilted his head, still trying to just understand. "You're his only family."
"I'm taking care of her."
"What the hell was that about?" Draco demanded, his voice hard and low.
It really started the day I got on the train for Hogwarts that first time. Hell, it probably started before I was born and Sybill Fucking Trelawney made a bloody prophecy. But seeing as how I can't remember my time in the womb, and the years with the Dursleys are now a dull grey in my memory, we'll stick with the fateful day I left for Hogwarts.
She nodded. "I'm not sure we'll ever know why for sure, but given the vitriol coming from Alexander's parents, we can assume. And I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have some hand in Sophia's parents' fate."
She stared, and he could see her little brain moving through everything it could to make sense of what she'd told him. "Are
Draco smiled. "Bet you were glad to be out of there and going to Hogwarts."
Draco snorted but removed his arm. "As though you aren't straight as an arrow. Doesn't mean I can't admire the scenery, though, does it?"
She sat down next to him, and when Ron joined them, she put up a privacy charm obscuring their voices and faces from others milling around nearby. "Right," she started. "So, I'll cut right to what we know."
Draco's shoulders fell and his stomach unclenched. Right. Teddy. He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped at his nose. "He's okay. You got him here in time, and they healed him right up. He's sleeping at the moment, but he's up and about. I'm sure he'll be in here as soon as he's awake again."
"If you've read my books, you might remember the story that I wrote shortly after this time. Amil, our boy pirate, sails into a port where all the people are trapped on a tiny island. They see visitors come and go, but they stay where they are because this is where they've always been. The food they grow isn't sufficient, and the houses they've built aren't enough to keep everyone safe, but they stay because they don't know of any other options.
"Because it's a trapestry, silly. They are made to hang on walls and make them pretty and stuff."
He pointed at her with the wooden spoon he was using to stir the sauce of his shepherd's pie and scowled. "Don't start. It's barbaric. And who leaves their child at home alone while they go on holiday to another continent? There wasn't even a house-elf there to watch him. Honestly. Horrible family."
"Fine. Whatever. Can we watch the match now?"
Harry chuckled and kissed him lightly, then grabbed the wand and cleaned them both. He tucked himself away and fell back onto the sofa with a loud sigh. "I love you too. I really needed that."
"It's not just that, is it, though?" Luna asked quietly as she sat down next to him, laying her head on his shoulder. "It's a lot to carry."
And it worked for them. It'd worked for them for over sixteen years. So why was this different?
"It was, yes," Draco said, uninterested in keeping the edge out of his voice, but Dudley's flinch made him soften a bit more, "but I think it'll help in the long run. He needed closure, so…thank you."
Draco got up and went into the bathroom, brushing his teeth. "We should talk it over with Lyra too," he said loudly after spitting into the sink. "She's already made her opinion known, but she should be part of this decision; it's going to change things for her."
And Draco couldn't say anything to that. He wanted it more than anything, so he gave in and stretched on his side next to Harry on the bed. "I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm so sorry."
"Medium, I guess," Harry said, thinking of Charlie's shoulder-length hair, then noticing Draco's hair that now fell about his own shoulders. Weird.
"I never understood children sucking their thumbs," he said quietly when Hermione handed him his tea. He lifted the cup and sniffed. Earl Grey. Perfect.
"What is there to explain? You were right. I was so wrapped up in my head as to what was—and what wasn't—a Malfoy problem that I wasn't fucking thinking clearly."
wanted to know more even eighteen months later. He wanted to see, wanted to understand. If only Harry would let him.
A couple of notes before we start with this chapter. I've made a couple of changes.
was significantly overdue," he finally managed, and Draco huffed out a laugh.
I forced a smile.
So, if not Harry and not the cat, then Lyra.
Rose brushed past her, running off to see Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron. Dad and Pa were next to them, ruffling Rose's curly, red hair while Alex and Hugo chattered away about something only little brothers would likely appreciate.
getting a photo of you like this."
Draco turned and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. "I haven't dared hope. I was so sure they'd find his family and take him away from us, so I couldn't hope."
"And what's for lunch today?" Draco asked, and he felt his lips twitch. He would not smile. He would
It made sense. Draco made so much sense, and Harry wanted to know; he wanted to try. He was terrified he'd never really enjoy intimacy with another person, and while he was sure that was fine for people who didn't want it, that wasn't him. He wanted to so much. He wanted sex and intimacy and all it entailed. And here was Draco, offering him an easy way to find out, no strings attached.
"I think a beach wedding would be lovely."
"I have an idea," Draco said, his voice suddenly close.
"So you—"
There was a lot of typing, but no responses. Finally, after about three minutes, his phone rang.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "This is my shop. Are you looking for flowers?" And then his eyes widened, and Harry could see the fear in them. "Or is this about something for your work?"
"Ha," Harry grumbled, but Draco could hear the smile in his voice. "More like an exorcism."
"Listen, you're going to be here with us for a little while. I want you to feel comfortable. This is going to be your room while you're here, but if you want to sleep somewhere else, especially now when it's still scary, you can do that."
Harry looked better when they entered the room. The monitoring charm was steadier, and Harry's breathing was even and deep.
My best friends and a
"Sleep, darling. I'll wake you when we hear anything." Her hands brushed through his hair, and he drifted off.
My eyes met Malfoy's grey ones, and I wondered if I looked as unsure as he did. Malfoy took a deep breath and held out his hand. I stared for a moment, hoping I wasn't an idiot for believing this offer of peace.
Draco heard Hermione and the social worker talking quietly in the background.
Draco smiled and wrapped his arms around Harry. It was good to be appreciated.
"These are odd," Draco said, popping a crisp into his mouth, "and utterly addictive."
Lyra came over to look. "Regulus Black. Daddy told me about him. He was a hero who helped Daddy stop the bad guy."
"Lyra," Draco corrected out of habit. "That's not how you speak to your aunt."
When Draco spoke, he chose his words carefully. "I think that you're probably right; Teddy would be very good at being a healer." Teddy seemed to relax, and Draco patted his hand. "We can talk about it more later, but if you went as far as telling Lyra, I'm guessing you're feeling relatively sure about this."
Harry froze. She knew.
That's where Draco was currently in the routine, and he was ready to tear his hair out. He'd not had a decent night's sleep in days, and he really didn't have the patience for this. Teddy's old room was freshened and waiting for Alex, but Lyra wouldn't let it go. He finally sent her to her room and sat down on Teddy's bed with the small boy.
"Well?" Hermione asked, her brows raised.
As Molly predicted, "normal" over the next few days could practically be tracked by the noise level of the house at any given moment. It reminded Draco of the ebb and flow of waves on a beach. When the children were silent, things seemed eerie, as though the entire household was waiting on tenterhooks for another bomb to fall. When the children were noisy, there was laughing, crying, arguing, and the general noise of kids being kids.
"What?" Harry asked, defensive.
Everyone groaned but got up to help. Draco watched, content.
I rolled my eyes and pushed through the gate, each step feeling painful.
His hair was soft, and I trailed my fingers down the short lock that fell close to his left eye, letting the tips trace along his sharp cheekbone, slowly memorising the feel of his face under my touch.
"Fine, I guess. We picked out our classes for next year."
She couldn't stand it anymore. She crawled over and wrapped her arms around him and buried her face in his shoulder like she was a little girl again. He held her tight, the silence soothing her mind. "I'm sorry I've been so mean."
"Harry—"
"It's after ten; Lyra will already be in bed, and from what I'm told, Alex is tucked in next to her. What
So he did. Well, he told them everything he thought Harry would be comfortable sharing, but seeing as how Harry wasn't really opening up, there wasn't much he had to leave out. Mostly, it was just the details he skipped over — they didn't need to know about the panic attack or glassy eyes.
Hermione was already gone.
Lyra goes over to the game shelf and pulls it down, putting it on the table with only a little huff. Wow. It really
They were going to do this again? Bloody hell.
"It is. And so are you. You're absolutely radiant. Twenty-nine agrees with you."
But the morning was over now, and he'd had a quiet lunch in a Muggle park, sitting next to a quiet pond watching the birds. His head was clear, his afternoon open so he could finish his paperwork on his last case, and he felt the stress of the day melting away.
"Being a dad is something sacred to him. Talk to him."
But where the Healers had known how to fix Teddy, they'd had confidence that he'd be okay, there was no reassurance for Harry. Stasis Charms only worked for so long. They might be able to keep them on for a few days, maybe a week, but the charms would begin to fail as Harry's body fought against them, demanding to proceed with that natural routine of life.
Come for me. Please. I want to see you come."
-To my dear friends Drarrelie and Drarrymadhatter, thank you for your beta skills and love.
"But…" Alex felt his throat get scratchy and his eyes water. "But how did it know?"
Draco had been right.
And he had my back every step of the way. He was there for me when I handed in my resignation, the new, single parent of a four-year-old boy who depended on me not to be injured or killed on the job.
A pop outside the back door caught Draco's attention only seconds before the knock on the door.
in my notes and comments after that, and so that's how I began posting it. As I approached the end, I realised that yes, it was Alex's story, but it was about so much more. It's about family and what that means to our characters. So, the story is now updated with the new name, though I've held on to the original as well. (I may also update the name of
"I watch you because I'm trying to figure out how you're doing it."
"Thank you."
Draco smiled to himself, recognizing the small size of the body at his back, and he slowly rolled over, ready to cuddle with the little girl. Instead, he was met with a small head of brown curls tucked into a ball, his head having been what had been wedged into Draco's back.
"She might be right, but he's talking to you, huh? What's he said?"
Draco thought but kept that to himself.
"I told them to fuck off. I mean, I didn't use those words with my Mum, but I did with Lucius. He's a right fucking bastard, and I told him to shove his pureblood nonsense up his arse, that I didn't care what he thought and would live my own life."
"That was my primary school," Harry pointed out, stopping in front of the long, boring, brick building surrounded by automobiles. "I finished there when I was ten."
Alex looked at Harry's bed then back to Draco.
"We just talked about my toys and stuff," she said, giving a little shrug and looking an awful lot like Harry. "I let him play with them."
Harry put the phone down and smiled. How did Draco always know how to pull him out of a funk? He rolled over, his mind finally letting him rest.
He turned, ready to walk out again, but the guests entering behind him stopped any chance of escape. Instead, he stepped into the living room and stood to the side, letting people in around him.
Draco wouldn't let that happen. He
Harry groaned, running his hands through his hair. "I don't know."
Dudley looked much the same as he'd always looked, just older and slightly slimmer, especially around the face. He'd grown into his body, and though he was still big, he looked comfortable in his skin. His red-rimmed eyes brightened when Harry and Draco entered the church.
"What?" he said again, defensive.
Harry snorted. "Yeah."
"Right." I pulled my wand, demonstrating the overpowered Shield Charm the instructor had requested as I allowed Draco Malfoy to throw spells my way. I dropped it just as quickly and began to hurl hexes, confident in his shield.
I placed my hand on the door handle and turned, but I avoided Draco's eyes. "Oh, and I just wanted to say I'm sorry for being an arse the other night. You were right."
Draco put his hand around Harry's waist, steadying him, and relief flooded through Harry's body. He could do this. He wasn't alone.
"In this case, that's exactly what it means. Glad you're catching on," Draco said with a condescending smile. It really
"What?" Harry gasped. "What do you mean?"
"Amil visits with them and explores the island where he comes upon a bridge. It turns out the island isn't alone, that it's part of a series of islands all connected by bridges over the beautiful sea. The islanders were never meant to be separated from their sister islands, but they kept to themselves because that's all they knew how to do. It wasn't until Amil showed them the bridge and reminded them of its use that they were able to visit the other islands. They supplemented their food and gathered better supplies.
"I win," Draco said, smirking with glee.
Draco stood and approached the stage, and Harry came over, taking his hand. "Let's go home."
His eyes were glazed over, his mind clearly a million miles, or perhaps twenty years, away. Occasionally, a tear would slip from the corner of his eye, but he didn't appear to be aware of it. He only held on tight to Draco's hand.
"But you weren't poor."
"Mmm, I think I do. Do you want to get married with me, Ginny?"
He was about to begin changing to his pyjamas when a tapping on the window drew his attention. A moment of panic fluttered in Draco's stomach, only passing when he noticed it was only Otus, Andromeda's screech owl. If Harry was there, perhaps he'd just got caught up with Teddy and had dinner there. With Teddy in Auror training and Harry in charge of the training program, it wasn't completely unexpected for Harry to spend extra evenings with his godson.
"So," I managed to get out, my voice rough, "you aren't together again."
"You want to know, right? What if I kiss you so you know what it's like to kiss a bloke. See if it feels different than the Weas—uh, Ginny. No feelings, just a friend helping you out and all."
? What do you
"I don't like the idea of his going off with just anyone, though," he mumbled, his stomach turning at the thought.
We were going to have a wild sex party tonight, but I suppose.
Harry made a choking sound, and Draco just stared at his daughter in awe. He gathered himself together and raised an eyebrow so she'd know he was serious. "You know he's not your toy, though, right? He's his own person, just like you are. He'll be part of our family."
Molly had left some pasta, so he heated that for all three of them and made sure everyone ate at least a few bites. Alex was a bit of a struggle, there, but Lyra's giggles when she dropped the noodles into her mouth coaxed the other child into eating.
"Draco," Angelina murmured, closest to where he was standing. She pulled him into a hug, but he couldn't bring himself to lean into it. He was afraid it might make him fall over completely. She seemed to understand, though, and stepped back with a smile. "Ron is over there," she said quietly, pointing to a door with two Aurors stationed outside it.
He was my friend, and I wanted him to be happy. Gathii had made him happy once upon a time, and I needed to be okay with that. I
"Yeah, yesterday." Potter looked perplexed but determined. "So, it's supposed to be really nice today. I thought maybe we could sit in the park and eat." He pointed to the basket.
Draco turned his grey eyes on Harry, and his face was serious. "Go on."
"I didn't tell him what it was!" She twirled back to her honorary big brother and huffed. "But you couldn't tell me a secret if I didn't let you talk, now could you?"
Because her Dad had died to save the wizarding world. And she was just…so…
And it was recent. Merlin, how the
"Fine, I'll take you, but you'll use a wheelchair. I'll not have you falling and hurting yourself."
Harry nodded and let Draco draw him into their shower, grateful for Draco's insistence on a flat with a large bathroom and this ridiculous double shower. Draco turned on the water, the steam almost immediately beginning to swirl around them, and stood before Harry, his grey eyes darting over Harry's face.
"Nothing," Draco interrupted. He took a deep breath and seemed to shake off his irritation. "I'm starving. Are we having dinner or not?"
"I know, Billywig. It's okay."
"You knew?"
"After he tried to torture you!" Draco took a calming breath. He would
Draco's eyes stung, and he reached for Harry's head, pulling it down so their foreheads rested against one another, their noses nearly touching. "I would still have suffered."
Her smile turned into a genuine grin and she chuckled. "Keep the change, you filthy animal."
Alex clung on tighter, and Draco sighed. What next?
"Harry—" They needed to talk about when Harry had left. It felt heavy in the silence between them.
"Yeah, just a little dizzy. The Healers said I might feel like that for a few days after large uses of magic."
"You're a good boy, coming today. More than they deserved."
like the darkness started when Teddy left because a part of me went with him. The best part of me.
Draco stared. "What?"
In the down moments between tasks, the darkness would close back in, the negative thoughts encroaching on my resolve to keep going, telling me I wasn't good enough, that I was alone, that I was useless. But I'd think of Draco, of the fire in his eyes when he told me I had friends who loved me, and the memory would push it all back.
"He looks calm enough for this to work, thank goodness." It was Helen again. "It's so hard when they have nobody to comfort them, and they fight it."
She looked around him and frowned. "Where's Daddy?"
"For dating?" Hermione asked, amusement in her voice. "Definitely. For crushes? Not at all. Not if you're not too distracted with Basilisks and Dementors, it's not."
I was jealous of Ron and Hermione starting something new. A baby. A family. And
Draco smiled. "Can I tell you a secret?"
"Magic," came a woman's voice behind them.
Before he came to any conclusions, Draco turned back with a gentle smile. "Okay, so, here's where you went wrong."
Harry narrowed his eyes, but his voice was resigned. "In my experience, getting it out just pisses people off and doesn't fix anything."
Teddy rolled his chair over by Harry's bed and ran a finger over his godfather's wrist. Draco thought he saw them trace the lines of Harry's old Umbridge scar; Teddy had been obsessed with that as a child, his righteous anger being one of the early reasons he'd wanted to follow Harry into the Auror corps.
Lyra stepped off the train, her second year of Hogwarts complete. She'd return in the autumn as a third year, and wasn't that strange?
Another day, another
Hold on
"This is brilliant! Bloody hell, I'm going to be an uncle!"
Draco wasn't mine to be jealous of. He was my friend, and yes, he was the person there for me when I needed it. He was the first person I wanted to tell when something good happened, the last person I talked to most evenings before bed, the person who knew how to make me smile when the world around me seemed to be too much.
"If there's one thing with which I've been impressed while watching you and your husband over the years, it's been your willingness to take on everything together. It confused me at first, but Andromeda had some very pointed opinions on it and bid me watch and see. And she was right. You're stronger together than you are separate. That's something that your father and I, as much as I loved him, never really understood."
Harry's chest tightened, but he didn't say anything, hoping Draco would keep going.
Merlin, now what? Draco wracked his brain, trying to figure out what he could say that would help the child relax. "Can I get you something to eat? Are you hungry?"
"Kreacher lives to serve the House of Black," the old elf croaked. "Master Malfoy cannot eat inferior foods. Kreacher knows how to take care of a good pure-blood like Master Malfoy."
Harry closed his eyes, remembering. "When I got to Hogwarts, everything was new. The wizarding world was completely alien to me, so I just decided to wait and see. And then I was with the Weasleys, and they didn't have much money and I felt weird buying things that they couldn't, so I just didn't. It wasn't important. So here I am, eighteen years old and fucking boring as hell and I don't even know what kind of fucking music I like." His throat burned at the admission, but there it was.
"But—" she started, "But you said Daddy saved him."
He watched her closely, and she knew what was coming next.
Harry chuckled. "It's 10:30. It's not that early."
Harry let out a harsh little laugh and shook his head slightly, then nodded to the sleeping boy. "How could I say no?"
He nodded. "I'm afraid to look. I used to always have it when he was away on missions, or even at work. He never used it, but it was there, you know? Just in case."
Arthur is coming to sit with Harry, so you need to go home and sleep in your own bed. Molly is at the house with Lyra and Alex, cooking up a storm and filling your kitchen with food. Go home, sleep, shower, and reassure your daughter."
Lucius sat back in his armchair, steepling his fingers in front of his mouth, deep in thought. “Well, I suppose you can’t get more influential than the Boy Who Lived to be Minister, can you? I’m impressed, Draco. I look forward to seeing what comes of this.” He smiled. “I’m proud of you.”
"Stop that. Merlin, I'm surprised you didn't do this sooner. This has been…difficult."
"Agreed," Draco said. "The key here is to pick out what
"Aunt Hermione. Gram. Aunt Cissy."
My friendship with Draco Malfoy was an odd thing, surprising in its strength and longevity.
The tenderness was almost Harry's undoing. He needed to get out of there, to go take a shower and wash off the sweat he'd worked up while cleaning, the feeling of disgust that came over him every time Petunia's words teased at his mind. And the water falling over his face would disguise the tears he felt burning behind his eyes.
Draco cleared his throat and glanced at Harry, and when he spoke, his voice was solemn and formal. "Yes, hello. I'm Draco. It's good to meet you, Dudley. I'm just sorry it's under these circumstances."
was Harry. Active and wild, yet lonely and still. And he'd wanted to know more.
"Do you want some tea?" he asked, suddenly remembering his manners.
Molly looked grateful for the interruption. "Oh, just growing pains, I think. Lyra is learning how to give Alex space, and Alex is learning that he has to use his words and not his hands."
"They didn't include him in pretty much anything," Dudley said, his voice quiet from Draco's left.
"No," he started to cry and crawled up into Draco's arms. "Don't go."
Harry flipped through the other discs. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins— "Is this one a wizarding group?"
Draco held his face in place, refusing to let her see his fear. "I'm not sure. Hermione is at the Ministry. She'll be here soon and hopefully, he'll be with her."
Well, who was he to keep his delicious aroma from a starving werewolf?
But to learn exactly what that all meant, to hear about her grandmother saving Dad's life, to learn about Grandma Molly killing Grandmother's crazy sister… to learn that Dad had died.
But each day was a little bit louder than the day before. Each day seemed to be a little easier, a little bit more normal. Old routines slowly morphed into new routines, and by the time the second week had passed, Draco began to relax. They could do this. Whoever had been up with Alex during the night got to sleep longer in the morning, and the other would get up with Lyra, beginning breakfast. By the time everyone was up, fed, and dressed, whatever plans had been made for the day would begin. A visit from Teddy, or a trip to the Burrow, or most often, an appointment with one of the various Healers and Mind-healers.
"It'll be up to Harry," he said finally, and Dudley's shoulders relaxed but his eyes were still sad.
"—wouldn't be in the field alone," Hermione interrupted, her face blank. She stood up. "Ron, go with Draco to the hospital. I'm going to the Ministry to see what I can find out. Maybe Harry's there, in which case I'll bring him with me. If he's not—"
"I didn't know," Draco said again, his voice little more than a whisper in Harry's ear, "how much you'd overcome to be the person you are." He pulled back and stared into Harry's eyes, grey meeting green. "I didn't know that your little faults, those little things that drive me nuts, are actual fucking badges of what you've beat. And I'm so sorry that I've not tried harder to avoid upsetting you about that shit. So much more makes sense now, and I just, I didn't know."
He leaned back against the wall with a sigh.
The sick feeling in his stomach he'd harboured all day was joined with the sting of disgust with himself. He'd been wrong, but he'd also been hurtful.
She took his hand. "Not exactly. Draco, he's asking for you. Alex wanted to see Harry, but he also asked for Harry's Draco. I think…" Her brown eyes met his. "…I think he sees you as an extension of Harry, as someone who will protect him. I think he might trust you enough, and he wants to help Harry get better."
But Draco'd had an obligation and Harry had been running behind. So now, after having been gone a week himself, it'd be another three days before he could see his boyfriend again. Leaving his bags by the door, he dragged himself to the couch and flopped down into the soft, purple cushions.
"Alex," Hermione said quietly. "You remember Helen, right?" She gestured to the woman who knelt in front of them. "Remember how she took care of you when they found you with Harry?"
"Monday," Harry breathed out. "That was Thursday, right?"
Draco's jaw dropped slowly open. He looked like he was about to say something, but nothing came out. He blinked several times, and Harry would have chuckled if he wasn't busy trying not to cringe at his own confession.
It was definitely worth sneaking away.
She scoffed. "Idiot."
"We did it! Alexander Torres Malfoy-Potter! Welcome home!"
"Lyra—"
"None of them looked surprised," Ron contributed. "Honestly, I knew something was up between Theo and Pansy, but I didn't realise Susan was part of it."
Yeah, why didn't he?
Second, I've bumped the rating of this story. It was intended to be a T rated story, but as I was writing this chapter, Harry and Draco had other intentions. It's not gratuitous, but it's definitely now an M rating. If that bothers you and you want to avoid that scene, it's at the very end of the chapter and when it starts, you can skip the rest without missing much plot resolution. For the rest of you, enjoy. ;)
When Draco got to the chorus, Harry began to cheer.
Potter. Who'd have thought that he'd partner well with Harry Potter? But they did, and hours spent together—every day, in fact—brought them closer to being friends instead of driving them both to insanity.
She froze and looked at him. "What?"
Alex opened his eyes and blinked, sucking harder on his thumb.
"They look fine," Draco said, letting me stare, not trying to coax me into the house like Hermione would have done, or telling me to cheer up, as Ron might have. "But if you want to paint them, we will. Maybe a new colour. Something less Gryffindor."
"Really?" Alex asked, staring at the man.
Draco picked up one of the throw pillows and began to worry the corner through his fingers. "I'm happier because I stopped giving a damn about what others expected me to do and started doing what
He couldn't get it out of his mind as he spent the morning with his mother, Lyra playing with Linney, his mother's house-elf, while the adults examined the financial documents. The manor was not only in debt, but it was also growing further in debt with each passing season, the estate income no longer able to keep up with the increasing needs of the ageing buildings and grounds. Draco needed more than just a one-time cash dump to fix the problem. He needed to better utilise the resources so it became profitable again.
It seemed to Draco that his days mainly consisted of waking up randomly to people talking. This time, it was the low rumble of Harry's chest under Draco's ear.
his day.
"And we're lucky to have him. That's what family is, Draco. It goes two ways. It doesn't matter if you're blood-related or if the child just wanders in from a flying car in the middle of the night. Once they're yours, they're yours. And you're theirs. It's really that simple."
"The Healers. Harry and I went in there, and those people were already dead. And then that man, he looked insane; he started hurling curses and there wasn't anything we could do. Even if those people had been alive, though, we couldn't have saved them. We didn't have the skills. Instead, we just got ourselves hurt, and then tried to get away. The people here, the Healers, they saved us."
"I need to paint the shutters," I mumbled, staring up at the house.
Draco stared. There it was again. He was missing a major piece to Harry's puzzle, and he was feeling around the edges looking for the piece that felt like it fit without seeing the big picture.
The silence grew between them, and Harry couldn't bring himself to open his eyes, to see what Draco thought of him. He could hear Draco moving, though, and figured he was probably done, ready to leave.
"Fine," she cried, smacking it down on the table. "Just, fine!" She turned and stormed out of the room, thumping loudly up the stairs and slamming her door.
Kreacher scowled. "
. It's just a family thing for me and my mother to figure out. Try to understand—"
"Is Uncle Harry going to be upset, do you think?"
He vaguely recognised the voice trying to get his attention through the rushing sound in his ears.
"Oh, God," Teddy gasped. "And this boy?"
Draco's smile spread. "Well, then, she's a Hufflepuff, so I'm going to assume she's partial to bright colours and informal displays, am I right?"
—story time— "
And then Lyra woke him early, screaming that Alex was gone and Papa needed to come quick and find him. As if Alex wasn't passed out in the bed next to Draco, his thumb hanging from his mouth.
How was he going to do this? Just, how? He had to face all those people who hated him — the neighbours, Marge, Dudley's friends — and he had to pretend to grieve the fact that the two people who had been supposed to care for him for sixteen years of his life and failed at it miserably, were dead.
"Start small, I guess."
liked. He'd tried things he'd never imagined trying before: woollen trousers that hugged his arse just so; chinos with multitudes of pockets that would hide his wand when he was in Muggle areas; shirts and t-shirts and jackets and jumpers; trainers and loafers and boots.
"I hope so because I intend to remain twenty-nine from now on," she said, laughing.
creating this with you. Collaborating on just about every step of the process was new and exciting and again, I am SO LUCKY to have been paired with such a stellar author. 🥰 - Phe
She forced a little smile. "Where's everybody? It's quiet."
"His Portkey must have activated within seconds. It didn't have time to do much damage, and he'll make a full recovery. There's some healing to do with his organs, but he'll be fine."
A tear fell from Harry's eye. "Please, lie down with me? Stay here?"
Dudley must have seen the anger in Draco's face, and he took a step back, but he didn't run. He straightened his shoulders, ready to take anything that Draco could give. And maybe that's what made the difference. Maybe that's what made Draco calm down and really think about what Dudley had said.
"Well, why don't you ask him?"
“Four years, Draco. Surely that’s long enough.”
body,
Harry stood up and started pacing. "You sound like a fucking Mind-healer again."
"Colour!" Susan said, looking up from her catalogue. "And fabric. Those are where we should start, I think. Harry, what colours do you like?"
" The petulance in her voice took all of Draco's patience. Fuck, yes, he wanted her to be excused, but he didn't want to let her off that easily.
Harry's hand on his was all it took to break him. Draco began to sob—loud, deep sobs that were wrenched from the bottom of his chest. He dropped his head to the blanket, trying to muffle the sound, trying not to let Harry see how weak he was, even if there was no way for him not to notice. Harry would feel guilty, feel like it was his fault, and Draco knew it wasn't. It was Draco's fault; all of it was Draco's fault. Draco was stubborn and didn't know how to love Harry like he deserved to be loved, didn't know how to be the family he needed, and he drove Harry away—had almost gotten him killed.
Teddy gripped the arms of his chair tightly, and Draco let him consider as they approached Harry's room.
But walking into the gallery, looking at Harry's photographs of the wild, magical jungles of South America and the calm, frigid waters of a Scottish loch, Draco felt something inside his chest unfurl.
Which was ridiculous. I knew it was. It had nothing to do with Teddy, my godson, going off for his first year of Hogwarts, and everything to do with me. So it didn't start then. Not really.
"Yes!" Lyra turned back to Draco. "Teddy thinks he's going to try to be a Healer instead of an Auror. He's been talking to the Healers while he's here, and he thinks he'd be good at it." She smiled. "I think he would too. He's always been really good at fixing me when I get hurt."
"I haven't been dropping no eaves, sir, honest!"
. They were choices he'd made because he liked them. His clothes, his choices.
First, I've updated the title of the story. When I first conceived this story while writing
He looked terrible. His eyes were bloodshot and tired, and his hair appeared as if he'd spent the entire day running his hands through it, which he probably had.
"Excuse me," Harry said, pulling away and backing from the room, unable to stomach any more of her hateful words.
Alex's eyes flitted to Hermione for a moment, but he grabbed on to Draco's hand. "Draco."
"If you're suffering, please know you're not alone. Open your eyes and try to grasp onto any hands there to help you. And if someone around you is lost in the dark, please be patient and keep trying. You never know when they'll be ready to look for the bridge.
and Howlers and all the other horrible things that will happen if I come out and let them all down, and then it turns out I'm just not meant to be with anyone at all? Maybe I'm too fucked up from the war and I should just spend the rest of my life alone?"
Harry had another night to stay at the hospital, which meant Draco would be alone again. More than that, he was on his own getting Lyra and Alex settled in. It seemed like ages since he'd gone through Lyra's bedtime routine, even if it'd only been a few days. Her schedule, like everyone else's, had been practically destroyed, and she'd fallen asleep the previous night with Alex and Molly on the sofa.
I held her a moment, wishing the warmth of her embrace could fill the hole in my chest that had settled in over the last month.
The three of them drifted off to the man controlling the music on the stage, and everyone looked around at one another. "Uh, did anyone else know about that?" Draco asked, sounding stunned.
"Yeah," Harry agreed. "I do. So, how do you deal with all that and still be happy?"
Draco simply stared at the fuzzy hairs curling around her face.
Draco had no idea how long he'd sat there, staring, but the light coming through the window was dimmer, falling low on the London skyline when the door opened. He'd ignored the same door multiple other times throughout the day, Mediwitches, Healers, Aurors coming in and leaving, none of them disturbing him.
Draco stiffened, and the change in demeanour made the room abruptly colder, and Harry was confused.
Draco nodded, standing up slowly, careful not to disturb the now lightly-snoring Alex.
What did it
"I'm sorry. Harry's talking to her."
"Yes, ma'am," he said, his voice thick. "I love you, Billywig."
I stared, stunned, listening to the sizzling of the onions and wondering what the hell had just happened. I replayed Draco's words, growing more irritated by the minute.
Harry scowled then raised his wand and threw up a charm to prevent the sounds of the kitchen from escaping. The Crup and cat had already made their escapes at the first signs of discord. It wasn't often anymore that Draco and Harry had an all-out brawl, but when it did, it was epic enough that the pets remembered.
(See the end of the chapter for
tonight."
Images of stubbled chins, hard chests, and sculpted thighs flashed before his eyes, convincing him of the truth of that once again. It'd taken him months to come to terms with giving up the life he'd imagined he'd have with Ginny, but several attempts at more intimate moments together the summer before convinced him it just wasn't going to happen. She'd been more than amazing about the entire situation and had started teasing him when she saw his eyes occasionally land on Charlie.
The boy's weight seemed to grow heavier and the sounds died out, but Draco kept moving. He ran a hand up over the boy's head, petting the soft curls. If he put him back to sleep here, even if he cast Monitoring Charms, he might not hear him quickly enough. He thought back to his nap earlier that day and sighed.
"I can't do this tomorrow," he whispered, as if he were afraid to say it any louder.
"Harry has issues with food," Draco said slowly.
"So, this is where you grew up," Draco said, and Harry could hear the veiled contempt in his boyfriend's voice. It wasn't the kind of place Draco was used to, he knew, and he could only imagine what Draco thought of it.
He thought about the jungle and the loch. Wild and lonely. "I want to understand," he finally said and met Harry's deep green eyes. "When you're ready."
Harry thought back to the years of taunting, chasing, punching he'd endured at Dudley's hands and nodded. "He is. Or was, really. He seemed like he was changing a bit last year, like maybe we could have been friends eventually, but I haven't seen him since. No point, really."
Dudley's news was like an awakening of every memory Harry had ever buried. Every harsh word, angry voice, painful slap, aching stomach, lonely night… They all came back to him like a flipbook, flashing through his mind. And there, in his madness, he had to find the humanity within himself to grieve.
Right. Because then Teddy would see, and I'd been doing so well keeping this from him, the impending darkness that I'd felt seeping around my edges for months.
, chapter 18 of that story takes place shortly after this chapter. Chapter 10 will take place a good bit later. Up next, EPILOGUE!
"You sound like a fucking Mind-healer."
So it was his own fault, really.
He watched Molly walk off to the kitchen and thought about what she'd said.
Harry had been so adamant that he could do this, that he could give this talk. It was important, he'd said, and it might help someone else. If it twisted Harry up inside, drawing forth memories of past pain, then Harry would fight through it and Draco would be there for him as he did.
When I'd said my plan revolved around apologising to Draco, I wasn't completely clear. I wanted to apologise, yes, but I wanted to thank him as well. I wanted to tell him how much he meant to me as a friend, how his presence brought me joy, and how I hoped he'd be there with me in the future.
"Mm-hmm. I mean, she kind of spills everything anyway, so it was intermingled with commentary about Hippogriffs, excitement over next year's electives, and random questions about the war, but yes, she told me she thought the girl was cute and wondered what age I thought she should consider dating."
How the hell did he get to be here with this man? It was so much, but, well, he was Draco Lucius Malfoy, and he deserved the best, right? He snorted at his own ridiculous thoughts and laid his head down on the pillow, settling in to sleep.
Looking at the clock, he turned, ignoring his mess, and took down two wine glasses, pouring himself and Harry each a drink. Then he took his wine and a book to the bedroom veranda and settled in to wait.
"Leave the phone and go. Now." He didn't raise his voice, but he only used what Harry called his Lord-of-the-Manor-voice when he meant business, so Lyra recoiled at his tone as though she'd been slapped.
"Nuh-uh."
"And Draco?"
"Please come out and have some dinner. I thawed some of Molly's vegetable soup that you love so much."
Harry nodded, eyes still closed, his head leaning back against the seat. "Vernon's sister. She hates me. Suggested that Aunt Petunia should have put me down as a baby like a runt puppy."
Once upon a time, I'd seen a ballet on the telly in my aunt's living room. I think it was Christmas or something, and Vernon and Dudley must have been off somewhere, probably at their monthly, father-son, cinema night, watching things blow up. Whatever the case, Petunia had me sitting on the floor helping her wind her yarn while she watched the ballet, and I remember the fluidity with which the dancers moved. The woman twirled and jumped, confident in the knowledge the man would be there to catch her. He, in turn, positively leapt across the stage, the power of his movements adding gracefulness and beauty to the dancers nearby.
Merlin, he knew about the cupboard? What the hell had Dudley told him? "I don't understand."
"I didn't tell you," Harry said quietly.
"I'm not sure that's a good idea."
Harry nodded and turned, trying not to show his dissatisfaction at the answer. His burgeoning friendship with Malfoy, with
"Only if you want us too," Draco added. "If you want us to find you another family, we would do that. We just want you to be happy."
"Yeah, that too."
When the door opened, it wasn't Lyra though, but Harry. He stepped close to Draco and pinned him to the counter with his hips. "Have a good eavesdrop?"
Because you're Malfoy?
His voice was getting louder, and he watched Harry cast a quick one-way Silencing Charm on the room. They'd be able to hear the kids, but the kids wouldn't hear them. "Go on."
I slapped the knife down on the cutting board and turned to scrape the offending items into the sizzling pan. "I know he's at Hogwarts. The fact that my house is fucking empty has not escaped my notice."
"No idea," Harry said, smiling as Draco tossed his hair back and waved to the audience.
Draco ended the call and threw the phone aside, taking Harry's hands in his. "Look at me. Breathe."
"Or that." Draco reached for his wand. "
"From what we can tell, Harry saved him. He's not talking much, but he's said enough. His name is Alex, like his father, and he said his uncle hurt his mum and dad and then hurt Harry and Teddy when they came to help. He said Harry took him away to the safe house where we found them hiding in Scarborough." She paused and gave a little smile. "Actually, he said he 'disappeared them away'."
"Seems that way."
, was still delicate. They tiptoed around one another, afraid to spoil the fragile truce, which was probably a good thing because Harry was finding that he genuinely enjoyed their occasional discussions about Quidditch, classes, and mutual friends. But they certainly weren't close enough friends for Harry to expect to know all of Draco's personal business.
he was my friend. Not
"So, that's it. There's no family," Hermione said finally, accepting the cup of tea Draco handed her with a sad but grateful smile.
"Whatever," he hissed, "you don't understand. I'm going to take a shower."
doesn't want Kreacher cooking for him. I only made food for Master Draco."
Harry didn't look up, just shook his head. "Later."
Draco's prediction sounded accurate. There was no way this wasn't going to be a disaster.
"Me too.
But Draco's problems were typical of anybody who'd gone through a war. Harry's weren't. He had issues with food, for example, his stomach messed up from years of having so little to eat. And he hated the dark. Really,
Because, and here was the real kicker, he was devastated. He really was. The loss of Petunia, particularly, hurt in a way he'd never expected. He was so,
(See the end of the chapter for
What did you do?
"I know, Billywig. What else did Teddy tell you? Did you let him talk at all?"
"Secrets, huh?" Draco asked, intrigued. "Hmm, we don't generally keep secrets in our house, do we? Surprises are ok, though. Is it something like that?"
Harry froze. "You know?"
"So, night out. Easter hols are next week."
Ron slapped me on the shoulder. "No you're not, but you will be. Come on, there's a bonfire down the beach."
"Yes, I'm aware."
Looking down at the Apparition coordinates, I let out a long sigh and spun.
They all sat in silence, Harry's words hanging between them. Finally, Dean grunted.
She started to snap at him but caught herself. It wasn't his fault she was in such a foul mood, and he didn't have a pet of his own since Cat died the previous month. She ruffled his brown curls and gave him a little smile. "Sure, baby bro."
Harry paused. "Huh?"
been hurt, they could reap the consequences.
"Harry! It's good to see you, mate."
"Hmm, that's the game now, then, is it?" Draco turned onto his side, crooked his arm, and propped his head on his hand. "Fine. My family invited a dark lord into my home and forced me to take the mark."
Pulling back, Draco looked at Harry, and it wasn't pity in his red-rimmed, grey eyes, nor was it rejection or disgust as Harry had feared. It was understanding.
Alex simply stared and shook his head, his thumb in his mouth.
The door closed behind him, and Harry moved to his bed and let the exhaustion overtake him, the smell of Draco's shampoo faint on his pillow.
"It was his bedroom until we were eleven," Dudley said. His words were quiet, but Draco heard each sharp syllable; they cut through his chest harder than that Sectumsempra curse ever could have.
Bloody hell. I
"I don't know how," he admitted, surprised as the thought escaped him.
Later, as he headed back to the office with the flowers in hand for his partner and a date for dinner the next evening, Harry smiled.
"Malfoy, Potter, you're paired up," Trainer Jeffreys ordered. "Get up here and show everyone how it's done. I expect the two of you to set the standard for the rest of the class."
"And then what? Then he's even more attached to us, and it's even harder?"
Because it was Malfoy Manor? It was the Malfoy estate? He had a duty to the estate that was his, not Harry's, to pass on to his descendants.
"Both, I think."
"Draco—" Harry's voice broke before he could say anything else. He pushed his glasses up, pressed his palms to his eyes, and took a deep breath.
"It makes her sound like a Weasley. I have more respect for her than that."
Draco rolled his eyes. "You're an idiot."
angry at everything she'd put him through, but someplace in his chest, she was still the woman he'd tried to impress as a small child, the woman he'd given a flower to on Mother's Day. He'd wanted more than anything to earn her love and approval, and though he'd never been able, that desire was a part of him and his memories, and now a part of him grieved the loss of the chance to ever make it happen.
"Harry," he managed to get out, trying to explain to whomever it was holding him that they needed to worry about Harry, not about him. He was fine, even if a voice in his head told him he wasn't.
"I've got him, Lyra. You go on." Draco knelt next to the boy, and his daughter looked torn, glancing between her new charge and the door to Harry. Finally, she nodded and sprinted the rest of the way.
"You died," she accused, and then she burst into tears. "How could you do that to us?"
"Don't go."
Draco smiled. "Whatever makes us happy."

He placed the potatoes and onions into a baking dish, followed by a few hastily cut carrots, some red wine and a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and finally finished off with some salt and pepper. He took some beef out of the refrigerator and placed it on top, added more wine, then covered it all and placed it in the oven.
"Well, there was definitely some fucking involved." Pansy's smirk morphed into a distant, dreamy look that made her look nauseated. Or maybe it just made Draco nauseated. Either way, there was puke involved.
insanity, now that he thought about it. What else would convince Potter to bring him lunch to the office, leftover roast beef on thick, freshly-baked bread? And that was just the first day. The second, Potter's house-elf beat him to it, and a basket of fresh cheeses and fruits appeared on Draco's desk. The old elf barely had time for a bow before he popped away, leaving Draco speechless.
"Did he tell you he wanted one?"
It was simply too good to be true. Maybe it was because they were both gone so often that it was working as well as it was. It'd been nearly six weeks and, other than some arguments over the purple cushions — and let's face it, those had been more fun than distressing and had ended with excellent makeup sex — things had been relatively easy.
"Is out of his hands. It was part of the agreement on his plea bargain. The Ministry insisted that I would take over the Malfoy estate and vaults. I'm letting them continue to live there because someone has to take care of the house and grounds, so it made sense, but all he's done by this little stunt is to remove whatever responsibility I felt to help him. If he's going to continue being a bigotted arsehole, then he can suffer the fucking consequences."
I'd long ago learned to trust my instincts in this area.
By the time Draco entered the room, a book tucked under his arm, Harry was seething, sweat dripping down into his eyes. He was reorganising the pantry as he'd already cleaned everything else he could see, but he needed to keep moving, needed to get the irritation out of his body.
Draco stared for a moment before raising a single, well-manicured eyebrow. "Is this just another test, Harry?" Draco asked, his voice challenging.
Theo grunted. "Is that going to leave any room for Potter's?"
"Play with Lyra," he said, starting to cry. "No."
Draco realised Harry was staring at him, green eyes sparkling with amusement. He raised his eyebrows, and Harry grinned.
At least there was that. Draco couldn't imagine making Alex relive the moment he lost his parents.
"I was the poor relation, yes."
He thinks about it. A movie with popcorn sounds fun, but maybe later when it's dark. He likes watching movies in the dark. "Can we play Snakes and Ladders?" Lyra never wants to play that. She says it's for little kids, but if it's his day… his Adoption Day… well, she has to do it anyway, right?
And then I saw him in Gathii's arms, and everything I'd planned to tell Draco seemed insignificant, but I wasn't sure how.
Hermione came up beside him and put her hand on his shoulder. "Neither of you ever mentioned it, not even when he was in Syria."
"Why would they hang a rug on the wall?" he asked his sister. She was two years older than him and seemed to know everything.
“I’m fucking miserable, that’s what I am. Pain? Yeah, but I can deal with that. It’s the smells. They're horrible. Hermione said there are potions that will dampen my sense of smell until I learn to deal with it.”
"You're welcome. In return, tomorrow you're going to tutor me on that advanced Shield Charm since I didn't get to work on it today."
"You were looking for signs of Harry in this house, weren't you? When you were searching the photos?"
His mouth tightened, but he kept his gaze locked on hers. "I did. I told you what you asked about, and I told you what I thought was age-appropriate."
She gave a firm nod as if that confirmed her assumptions. "That's what Daddy does, right?" She took Draco's hand. "Come on. I want to meet Alex."
He looked up, surprise in his eyes—eyes, that as everyone pointed out, matched her own. "Lyra," he said quietly.
Draco hummed from the bathroom where he was applying his face cream. "Well, hormones, I guess. And she's not that different. She's just…grumpy."
"I missed that smile," he said, a small smile on his own lips, but his eyes were still sad. "It's hard, watching you being all grown up."
But Harry was entirely absent. He wasn't in a single photograph. Not one.
"That's understandable. We'll be there. Just text him the time you need him there and an address."
"Alex," Harry began quietly, "did you know that I'm like you?"
Draco looked at Harry with narrowed eyes and wrinkled brows. "You're not sure?" he asked, drawing out the question. When Harry didn't answer, Draco rolled his eyes. "Yes, I've done some things with a bloke, and yes, I'm sure. I've been sure since fourth year, if you must know, and it didn't take anything more than the Quidditch locker rooms to convince me. Surely you've noticed things like that too?"
He closed his eyes and nuzzled his face into my hand, and I could feel my chest swell. I loved him so much. How could this have been here for so long without me noticing?
When Draco woke, it was to find himself lying on a cot in Harry's hospital room, a small head of curls nestled into his shoulder and Hermione watching with a sad smile from a chair across the room. The smell of breakfast made his stomach growl loud enough for her to hear, and she chuckled.
"It's only procedure," she said, placing a calming hand on his arm. "Nobody's going to insist he sleep alone, but the option needs to be available."
"Well, I mean—"
"But—"
"I—I don't understand. I just saw her yesterday when I dropped Teddy home. She was fine." I felt numb; I knew I should be feeling something,
"Harry saved Alex. I couldn't move; I just froze. I don't think I'm cut out for this."
She smiled at the use of Draco's pet name for her. "Love you, Papa."
"Oh, Potter, you should see yourself," Draco said after a moment, wiping the tears from his eyes. "Don't worry, his virtue is safe from me. Or perhaps you're worried about your own?" Draco winked, and Harry's face began to burn.
She ran off to the kitchen area and began moving around, expertly assembling Harry's dinner and humming to herself.
want to do?"
Alex woke three more times that night.
Harry nodded. "Thank you."
She looked at the door. "Will you put up a Silencing Charm?" He hesitated. "Please?"
"You need to talk about it, and Harry doesn't look ready." She flicked her eyes to Draco. "And it'll probably help him help Harry."
“You smell delicious,” Potter finally finished. “Gods.”
I loved him. He was my friend.
"Okay, spill it," Harry said as he entered their bedroom, both of the children tucked into bed and the house dark. "You've looked like you might explode with whatever it is for hours."
Oh, god.
"For fuck's sake," Draco muttered. "Of course, you are."
Ron looked at Hermione. As head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, she'd been receiving the updates from the medical staff in Draco's absence.
"I mean that you need to get off your arse and start doing things. Teddy's at Hogwarts, not dead. You're mourning, for Merlin's sake, and I'm tired of watching you sit here every day, hopeless, as though there's nothing left for you." He stood up and grabbed his jumper off the back of the sofa where he'd draped it earlier. "Open your fucking eyes."
"Good call," Draco answered, and he unbuttoned Harry's jeans and reached inside.
Across from Ron, Hermione sat with a woman in a purple, Muggle pantsuit, and a little boy.
"And she told you this?"
"I know."

There were tears audible in Hermione's voice when she spoke. "Love you. Sorry." She was quiet for a moment while Draco felt his world fall apart around him. "That's it. But Draco, that doesn't mean he's not okay."
Draco sighed. There was nothing to be done for it, he supposed. He was officially becoming a Slytherpuff.
"Decoration," Draco said, his eyes sweeping the room.
His senses began to clear, and Hermione eased him onto a chair he'd not noticed until that moment. She stayed with him, slowly breathing, no longer speaking.
"Why aren't you mad at Draco then? Or me? Or Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron?"
Draco couldn't speak, he just shook, letting the tears and snot run into the blanket under his face. His nose was clogged, too, and he felt disgusting, but he couldn't stop.
Teddy narrowed his eyes, looking for a trick, but when Draco moved the chair he, himself, had been sitting in and transfigured it into a wheelchair, the younger man finally relaxed and nodded. "Okay, then." He sat down in the chair when it reached him, then looked up at Draco, his voice barely audible now. "Please tell me. I need to know."
"I said, no. Take me to Harry. And explain what you meant. What was this kid
Stop it, Ginny. Draco, what's wrong?
"They'll get nowhere, and we're looking at filing criminal charges against them for conspiracy to commit murder, as it appears they were aware of his plans. We're going to follow this through, but the point is, even if they wanted the child, we wouldn't let them have him."
"I want to be happy."
He cleared his throat and straightened his minty-green Healer’s robes. He could do this. He was a professional, for Salazar’s sake. “Mr Potter. What seems to be the problem?”
Luna pulled away from Ginny and clapped her hands like a five-year-old offered ice cream. "Yes, please! I love champagne!"
I don't know how long I sat there, my friends talking quietly while I absorbed the news of Andromeda's death, a woman I considered like an aunt—the good kind, not the shitty, like Petunia. At some point, though, someone must have moved or left because suddenly a pale hand was on mine, squeezing, comforting, and I fell apart.
"And then she adds stuff to it. Broccoli, carrots, whatever vegetable is handy, usually. And that's when she's not adding additional helpings of meat or potatoes or whatever."
The thing about hope is that it can be a fickle emotion. If you don't truly feel it in your stomach, if you're only beginning to find it in your life or if you base it upon something transient, you risk shattering it completely.
I'd just never considered that Malfoy, of all people, would join me there.
"Harry!"
Only two weeks later, fate forced Harry's hand and Draco realised that he hadn't been ready either.
~~Sincerely, Janieohio
Which was ridiculous and melodramatic. Of course someone would adopt him, give him a family, and he'd grow up happy and loved. Draco just hoped that whoever they were, they deserved this brave child.
Harry's eyes snapped open and met Draco's smokey gaze. "Fuck. No, Draco. Being happy. I'm trying to figure out how you're able to be so bloody happy despite everything. Everything has changed for you — your status, your family, everything — and yet, you actually seem happier than you ever were before. I'm trying to figure out
afternoon.
"Is it still because of the war?" Draco stood up suddenly, pushing his hands in his pockets. "Or maybe because I'm gay? Or—"
Parvati cast a spell turning Harry's walls into mirrors, and Draco let out a long whistle. "I'll need you to teach me that one. It will definitely come in handy someday."
Draco folded himself down on the large cushion in the corner, still staring at Harry like he was some creature in one of Hagrid's classes: interesting and a little dangerous.
"Pa said you've been working doubles all week."
He ran his tongue over his lips, hoping they weren't too dry or anything. Harry saw Draco's grey eyes fall to watch him, and Harry blushed, pulling his tongue back in. Merlin, he couldn't do anything right, could he?
They'd been good together, and I'd be a terrible friend not to want him to have that, no matter my own feelings. So, I worked Draco's happiness into my hopes and plans, that he'd have what he always wanted. I'd be there to stand by his side and support him.
Harry saw the first people beginning to arrive and shook his head. He said he'd be here with Dudley, and so he would. He
He was shaking too. Of course, he was. Andromeda was his
"Think what?"
Andi's eyes seemed to scan his face, but she didn't say anything. "I see. Teddy's doing well. He's unconscious."
"I know," Draco rasped. He cleared his throat and pushed Teddy into the hallway, heading towards Harry's room. "And he uses it instinctively, often without realising. They had to put him under a Stasis Charm before he killed himself."
"Nothing happened," she said, truthfully. When he raised an eyebrow, she rolled her eyes. "Seriously, it's nothing."
The thing was, Harry was coming to admire Draco. With each passing month of their eighth year, Draco appeared freer, happier than Harry had ever seen him before. It was like some previously-unspoken-of mask had fallen. He laughed louder, he spoke livelier, and he drew in those around him. He ignored the taunts of those intent on holding his past against him and, instead, worked to prove them wrong, to show them that he'd changed, that he was no longer the little shit they'd all once known.
It all started when Draco mentioned he didn't enjoy eating in the Ministry canteen for lunch. A passing comment about heartburn was all it took to create mayhem.
I met Malfoy's eyes once more, and this time, the smile filled his face, transforming it into something bright and open.
"I don't know what Harry's told you about his childhood, but since you've been relatively nice to me, I have to assume it's not much."
Draco smiled gently. "Yes, her name is Lyra. You're pretty smart."
Draco shook his head. "And Teddy is at St Mungo's."
Draco sat down in the chair next to the hospital bed and stared at the man he knew so well.
Molly blushed and slapped him away. "Oh, go on now." She sobered a little and put her hand on his arm. "It's going to be okay, you know. It's hard to see the big picture when you're in the middle of it, but this too shall pass, and you'll all come out stronger for it."
He stiffened his shoulders and waited.
"…doesn't look good, but he's here and they're working on him. Let Malfoy sleep. I'll send you an update as soon as we have it."
Draco's stomach felt sour, so he got up, stirred the simmering meat on the cooker before preparing a pot of tea. He didn't say much, just thought about his own family, the way Lucius would have reacted if he would have even spoken kindly to a Muggle, let alone deem to marry one. He could understand why they'd try to send her family away, why they'd relocate to another country themselves.
So why now? Why was it that
Harry thrust again, running his hands through Draco's hair and devouring his neck. "I put an alert charm on the top step. We'll hear them coming."
Harry nodded. "Yes. I want that very much."
The following day, a large picnic hamper was sitting on Potter's desk when Draco entered the Aurors' offices. Potter looked up with a grin.
Harry nodded and took a bite of the soup Draco set in front of him.
Draco ended the call and walked down the hallway to the closed door of the workroom. He knocked lightly. "Harry?"
She started to roll her eyes, but he kept going and she froze.
"God, Draco, I'm not going to last long tonight," Harry said, gasping. "But I want you to come with me. Please."
"Well, you're an idiot daily."
"What? I notice things."
"I love
"It wasn't fair for me to learn about it that way."
"And I'm sorry I hurt you. I didn't realise they'd started teaching that at school, and—"
"Can I play with Kiwi when we get home?" Alex asked as they began to walk. "Please?"
Walking along the wall of photographs, Draco's eyes sought out any of a small boy with messy hair and glasses. Most were of Dudley at various ages, his parents sometimes present with proud smiles on their faces. As different as they were from Draco and his parents, the Dursleys still reminded him of his own family in photographs from his childhood. These images told the story of a close family and an overly indulged child. Yes, there were definite similarities.
