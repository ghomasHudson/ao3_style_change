Harry thought to himself, turning away from his school. Strangely wobbly, he picked up his pace, but he couldn't manage more than a slow jog by the time he'd reached the end of the first street corner. He almost sunk down onto his haunches before a figure appeared as if from nowhere at his shoulder.
"Jackie –"
Ron was all but frothing at the mouth. "What – what are you even -?"
Lifting his own head, peering down at Draco once more, Harry smiled. "Looking forward to it."
"Discipline and Punishment?" Pansy said, skirting around Jackie with a slight frown on her face. "Does that… interest you?"
The woman tipped her pointed chin towards the dressing room where Harry and the director still stood smiling and chatting practically in the doorway. "Just because you're working with him doesn't give you the right to get familiar. Keep your distance."
Harry didn't understand. He couldn't understand what had upset Draco so much, or what exactly he'd said that had caused him to be so angry. Was it even anger? Or frustration, maybe? Some kind of pain or distress? Harry didn't know because he'd only had a moment to attempt to discern just what had struck Draco like a blow across the face before he was all but running from him. If he hadn't taken the time to offer a hand to Harry to drag him into Side-Along Apparition, Harry would have almost let him go.
Not perfect, not healed, but better. It helped even more that, so close to Draco, he could feel his own tension ease slightly, too.
"You two are going to pair up, then?" Jill asked from Harry's shoulder. "As usual?"
"Looked down on them?" Harry asked. A wall of defensiveness immediately erected itself within him, not unlike that he felt when he heard whispers of homophobia turned directly upon him. "For something Muggleborns didn't choose and had no control over?"
"Did you do something magical then?" Harry asked, as much to distract himself as out of real curiosity.
"Pansy."
Draco only chuckled, pressing a kiss briefly to Harry's cheek before turning back to the theatrical explanation Blaise was holding as they waited for their order. Harry stared up at Draco for a long moment before, fighting the urge to grin like a fool, he slipped his arm back around his waist.
"Haven't seen you in a while," the man said. "We didn't get a chance to exchange numbers last time. Where've you been?"
Nothing.
Dimitri raised a hand like a shrug. "Not at all. I'm more than happy to give you my apprentice."
Striding into the dining room, Harry leant over his father's shoulder and swiped a hot chip from his plate.
"Yeah, James, you're encouraging," Harry said, dropping down onto his haunches at the bottom of the stairs to tie his shoelaces. "You're a bad influence."
Unconsciously, he started singing very softly as he made his way down the hall toward the stairs.
Back at Number 4 Privet Drive, Harry trudged to his room, grateful that the Dursleys weren't home at the moment. He flopped on his bed and tried his best to NOT think about what had happened. Voldemort had been resurrected. Cedric had died. Life was definitely going to get worse!
“Guess it's true I'm not good at a one night stand, but I still need love 'cuz I'm just a man. These nights never seem to go to plan, I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?”
This confused the hell out of Harry, who even lowered his wand and simply stared at Draco.
Finally, Draco got to the point. “So, do you know how to fix it?”
About halfway through the dance, the Entertainer jumped up and wrapped her legs around Draco's waist so that she could lean back and really grind into him. After a few seconds, he pulled her up into his chest and gave her a kiss that immediately made Harry see red.
Harry barely had a moment to wonder what Draco would think about this turn of events before Ginger was leading them to the nearest Apparation point. She promptly Side-Alonged them both to the place on Knockturn Alley that they were investigating.
“How am I being an arse?” Draco questioned in bafflement.
Draco stood toward the back in relative safety since he was in charge and he was basically overseeing the battle. It would be up to him to stop the Death Eaters from disobeying any direct orders from the Dark Lord, otherwise he was more or less expected to just let them get on with it. Which he did, despite being repulsed by Greyback's methods – which left at least one body to step over – until he heard something that sounded like someone landing on the tower.
it was all this licking that got people horny and ready to shag each other within an inch of their lives.
On the other hand, despite the fact that Draco had started out playing the field – with Harry's knowledge and acceptance – he'd ended up... not... Probably from the moment Draco first brought Harry back here to the Manor, he'd just not been interested in anyone else. And he honestly couldn't figure out why!
Harry was not pleased to find himself sticking to the disturbing theme of the last song. “Well I'm not paralyzed but I seem to be struck by you, I wanna make you move because you're standing still.”
try to sing a hint to Draco in public in front of everyone.
Anaya, Vihaan, and Hunter (Parkinson-Malfoy) were the only Potter kids in Fourth Year, and so, they felt a bit like they were on their own when it came to relying on their siblings. That said, Anaya and Vihaan were both Hufflepuffs, and so, managed to invoke the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor qualities of their mothers (and father), and take charge of their house. Under their command, Hufflepuff did surprisingly well and made it to the center of the Maze fairly quickly.
A minute or so went by, but then both lines faded and a new one appeared.
Draco took the drink warily and sniffed it. Apparently finding the drink acceptable, he took a sip. His face had an appraising look on it for a moment before he took another sip. Then he gave her a tiny smile.
But Harry wasn't having it. “Merlin, Draco! You look terrible! Please tell me what you're doing; I'd rather help you than watch you continue to suffer like this!”
Amelia bit her lip and looked to the floor while Remus2 tried to look at the ceiling and pretend that he hadn't heard anything.
Harry shrugged. “Well I'd agree if he left it at that. Instead, he transfigured a bunch of desks into a bed, tied me to it, and tickled me all over with his tongue.” Harry blushed and looked away. “I was naked...” he added in a soft mutter he wasn't sure if he wanted them to hear or not.
Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart. “Really, you shouldn't accuse – dangerous thing to say – wands away please!”
Draco was at his wit's end! Not only had the book he was waiting on NOT arrived, but he was now receiving impatient letters from the Dark Lord – which were in code of course – threatening dire consequences if he didn't complete his task soon. Unless that book contained a miracle that fixed that Salazar damned cabinet, he was done. There was nothing more he could do.
To emphasize his point that this was absolutely not allowed, the Dark Lord murdered her with an Avada Kedavra, and then fed her to his enormous pet snake. Despite expecting that both of these things might happen, Draco was startled enough by it happening literally right above and in front of him, that he fell out of his chair.
Draco was normally very well mannered at dinner, but he was so flustered by Harry's unexpected presence that he couldn't restrain himself for long. Narcissa barely had a chance to finish her introductions – “I'm certain I have no need to introduce our son to you, since you were in the same year, but allow me to introduce his bride-to-be Amanda.” – before Draco was blurting out: “Why in the bloody hell is
That said, lots of magic produced green light in various shades, so just seeing the color wasn't necessarily an indication of what spell it was, but still, one would be motivated to avoid it.
Gryffindors!” She handed them each a flask as promised. “And sorry, but I have to supervise the transformation in case something goes wrong.”
The moment the water was the perfect temperature and Harry stepped under it, Ron entered the room. “Are you okay? And don't worry, I spelled myself so that I won't attack you with tickles.”
The moment Bella was satisfied the sword was a fake and called the Dark Lord, she offered Granger to Greyback. This triggered a somehow miraculously free weasel to spring forth from the door leading down to the dungeon. He then managed to shock everyone in the room by disarming Bella, her wand being caught by Harry, who promptly stunned Lucius.
that we get dressed up to go to the Leaky. Blaise has charmed the owner into letting him have Karaoke one night a month – and tonight's the night.”
Harry was silent as he also sank to the floor and contemplated his sudden dilemma. On the one hand, offering to donate a 'dose' to Draco at this exact moment was clearly wrong – considering what Harry now knew – BUT NOT offering could potentially be fatal. He ran a hand through his hair, sincerely wishing that he'd known all of this before setting up this situation.
This was the part that was harder than it had been for the Fourth Years as Harry had added a lot more challenges in the wrong directions for the Sixth Years, whereas for the Fourth Years, if there were four possible directions, two would be empty, one would be the right one with a challenge, and one would be the wrong one with a challenge. NOW, ALL directions had a challenge whether they were the right direction or not.
"Well, not every day," Harry said.
A flicker of memory, something about a florist, breezed across the surface of Harry's mind, but it disappeared before he could grab hold of it. "I'll bet," he said. He glanced over his shoulder as the barman reappeared behind him with a gesture of the two glasses he held. "I'm actually here with friends."
It was a whole two days before Harry's parents left the room together. Two days before Harry was given the privacy of Draco's sole company. He couldn't bring himself to resent either of his parents for it; Lily looked so nervous, so tense, at the prospect of leaving that Harry had to impress upon her both the proximity of the nurse's station and the cell phone Sirius had retrieved for him only the day before.
"I'm not."
"Hey, I did work! I read books!"
"It wasn't only two seconds."
"Hey, Hermione," he said as, while the rest of her classmates flowed past her, Hermione paused alongside him. Glancing over her shoulder distractedly, he offered a cursory, "How are you?"
"Did you tell Blaise as well as Pansy?"
She smirked into the dregs of her wine. "Alright, Lord Pompous. I'll refrain."
"That's the one. He's boring."
Pursing his lips, Harry glanced over his shoulder at the dark dormitory. Snores and the gentle squeak of springs still added a quiet backdrop to the otherwise silent morning, and not a single person had started to awaken yet, but it wouldn't be long. Harry should get up, should retreat to his bed before anyone noticed, before they saw that not only was he not sleeping properly – Ron already regularly commented on that – but that he'd taken his sleeplessness into Draco's company where Draco had, somehow, unwittingly, fixed the problem.
It was a slow, undulating coupling, far removed from what had become frantic and desperate the night before. Draco thrust upwards and into him, and Harry rolled his hips and met him with each motion, his gasped breaths and low murmurs of Draco's name as intoxicating as his weight atop of him. It was gradual, and blissful, and awash with spreading warmth that radiated from Draco's groin and down to his very toes.
"The magician?" Draco asked, clarifying as he had every time since Harry had first mentioned his comrade-in-arms at the local party supplies store. As always, he sounded derisively dubious.
"I wouldn't say that two instances equate to forming a habit," Draco said, the regal tilt of his chin rising slightly higher. He had a long neck. Harry hadn't realised he liked that until that moment. "But if you're referring to my staying behind while the rest of my classmates have left, then yes, I have done so.
How insufficient an explanation for what existed between Harry and Draco. Turning towards him, Harry met Draco's eyes and tipped his head slightly in a silent question. Not that it really needed to be asked at all. 'Being prepared for that inevitability' was something Harry thought he'd been gradually perfecting for months. Years, perhaps. Maybe even before he'd first kissed Draco on a cobbled street in Lucerne.
"Cheapskate."
Ron picked up on the eleventh ring. "Yeah?"
It was a bad night.
a bloody maze." Then he paused, and his gaze trained just a little more sharply upon Harry. A beat or two passed, Harry raised an eyebrow in question, and then Draco unslung his camera, flicked it to life, and raised it to his eye. In the middle of the hallway, as though there was no one else about, he snapped a picture of Harry.
"If you have a problem with it, go down to the Great Hall and get your food for yourself," Harry had said, shaking the burger pointedly. "Don't make me dump this in your lap. I'm still going to sit there, but it would make it gross."
The ex-Ravenclaws he passed were still playing poker, though half of them looked more intent on sipping their drinks or counting their coins than actually playing. Michael was stretched out across the only route across the room, and Harry nearly tripped over Mandy's foot as he stepped over them both. The ex-Slytherins had somehow managed to obtain and keep the majority of the seats around the fireplace, though a handful of dancers had made their way into the centre of the suite's ring and looked to be trying to pull their reluctant dorm mates to their feet.
Harry couldn't speak, but he nodded.
"I'm…" Draco trailed of for a moment before clearing his throat and continuing. "I'm just about to leave."
Exams were still a handful of weeks away, but his headache was a near-constant companion, the buzzing reminder in his ear that he had this essay to write, that chapter to read, or those notes to go over once more and to complete properly this time. Harry didn't know what he'd do without the support of his surprisingly compassionate professors, or the mutual suffering of his friends.
"Personally, I believe that the modern judicial system is inherently flawed," she said with a sniff, dropping primly into her seat. "It's practically medieval."
was the place she'd decided she needed to be when she'd – what, escaped from gaol? He didn't know anything, but that didn't stop him from spinning around and fleeing with every inch of terror that abruptly swept through him.
"Need a hand, Malfoy?" his assistant Yu asked, edging away from where he and Dawley stood to the side of the room as awkwardly and redundantly as ever.
The studio itself was situated on one of the upper floors of a soaring building that overlooked a sea of other, less soaring buildings otherwise identical in their blank whiteness and walls of windows. Following on Pansy's heels, he entered a wide, echoing foyer of polished floors and minimalist desks and attentive receptionists. Draco followed her as she bypassed them into a sleek elevator without comment; he didn't question that it was clearly a Muggle building that she'd led him into. Even had he not already known the nature of the grey area between Wizard and Muggle, Pansy's missives had informed him that, outside of the notorious
Harry grinned. "Yeah."
"No, I mean we just pulled up next to the museum –"
Typical.
"You can't really blame him, I suppose," Harry found himself saying, staring at Malfoy's profile and only half aware of Ron's attention snapping towards him.
"Not yet," Draco replied, slowly. "Just... not yet."
"Isn't it just?" Pansy replied heavily.
Draco's throat became abruptly dry. "Even after what they did to you?"
"Shut the fuck up," he said lowly.
Harry immediately felt his hackles rise. Some upstart of a reporter – because it was a reporter, was always a Wizarding gossip-monger that invaded the sanctity of their space – was spouting noise about Dot. It would always be the same in that regard too: Harry should be the figurehead of the Wizarding world, not a figure in the Muggle one. He should be working for the ministry, or he should be an Auror, or he was supposed to be reserving his public appearances and professional time for Wizarding magazines and papers.
Flipping up the collar of his jacket to shield his neck, Harry hunched his shoulders as soon as he stepped out of the building of
He'd heard whispers from classmates about avoiding parental notice but hadn't really heeded it. His parents were cool. They were fine. It didn't matter what they knew, and they'd taken his coming-out better than Harry had hoped, let alone expected. But this?
Raising his tea to his lips, Draco paused before taking a sip. His breakfast sat heavily in his stomach, a sodden lump that didn't quite smother the sickly bubble of nausea that hissed and sizzled in his gut. Lowering his cup, Draco picked up his wand instead and pressed the tip to the edge of the letter. He paused for a moment, the spell on his lips, and hated himself just a little for the thought that crossed through his mind.
Harry might not like them, wasn't sure if he'd ever like them, but he would attempt amicability. Malfoy was likely still an arse, even if he hadn't spoken a word throughout the entire feast, Parkinson probably still a cow despite the trembling downward turn of her lips, and Zabini almost certainly still a confident prat even though he didn't look it, but Harry would try. They didn't deserve to be hated so fiercely, or at least he didn't think so. There was too much hatred in the clean-up after Voldemort's destruction as it was. Harry was so goddamned sick of hating.
"You," Draco said.
"I'm not – Blaise, fuck off, get out of my face. No, it's my phone. If you want to ask him something, call him yourself. No.
Draco shook his head but it wasn't quite in denial. With a shrug and a surprisingly casual, un-Draco-like gesture, he released Harry's hand to instead drape his arm around his shoulders. It was entirely unexpected, and Harry might have been stopped short if he hadn't already paused in step.
Then they'd practiced magic. For a little bit. It didn't last long, however, with one particular segue of a spell.
Travelling with Harry had been an experience as close to perfect as possible. So close, and that even accounted for their stopover in Hawaii that had unexpectedly resulted in one of the biggest arguments they'd ever had. A day of stalemated silence that followed had invariably been the lowest point of the entire year, but afterwards? Making up and struggling through an apology, and then resolving to never, ever tempt fate again by challenging one another to a flirt-off with strangers at a club had bridged the momentary rift almost immediately.
Hermione smiled. She was nestling herself into her cushion with the casual entitlement of one who practically owned the place, house and couch included – which she sort of did. In skirt and tights, a scarf looped loosely around her neck, and in the process of kicking her shoes off, she appeared entirely comfortable, entirely subdued, and not at all like the face of activism and equal rights that she'd become in so short a time.
Harry had glanced down at where their hands hung side by side, knuckles occasionally brushing but no longer holding. He hadn't meant to let go of Draco's hand, but stepping out of Diagon Alley into easy sight of the Muggles that still hastened past one another into the dusk – it didn't feel right. He couldn't help but feel watched, as though anything and everything he did, every glance he cast Draco's way, stamped a sign on his forehead of 'head over heels' and 'hopelessly gay'.
"Sit," Von said after he slipped the casual shirt over Harry's shoulders as though he were a child who couldn't do it himself. Harry didn't really care about that so much anymore, either. "You're not stepping out of this room until I'm done with you."
"Bullshit," Jackie said, leaning onto the table and cupping her chin in her hands. "I've heard it."
"I can be very persuasive, dear."
"Excuse me, young man," she said, a Scottish lilt to her tone. "Would you be able to point us in the direction of the primary office building?"
Pansy huffed into the phone, though it sounded more amused than indignant. "Am I not allowed to express my concern? The world is vicious at the moment you know, Draco."
And touching. Touching felt good. Not the kind of touching that he hadn't really done with Cho, or had only done a little more with Ginny, but a different kind. A hand resting against his own. The warmth of a body alongside him. When Ron slung an arm around his shoulder, or Hermione leaned against him to peer at his work, or the few times he'd sat next to Ginny at dinnertime and she nudged him fondly with an elbow.
"They didn't tell me. Not anything. And they're all –"
Harry laughed. His agitation from waiting might not have abated, but how often did anyone get to see their best friend finally ask the object of their affections on a date? Even more rarely that it actually amounted to something.
"That
Maybe it should have worked. Maybe, if he hadn't been fighting the urge to throw up what little food sat in his belly, he would be able to do it. Or maybe there was something that would have stopped him.
In her rich coat, however, her knee-high stockings and the ridiculously high heels she wore, her wariness could certainly be construed as arrogance. Her 'Muggle clothes', as Draco called them, only seemed to enhance the impression. She certainly managed to catch Jackie's eyes, though.
Draco almost replied. He almost denied her, which would have been a mistake, for that too would be admitting Pansy's correctness. But he didn't get the chance before the door was swinging open from where it had clicked shut at Picard's departure.
The sounds of chaos that had flooded the hallway just outside the studio all day had died to near-silence. Murmurs of conversation still interrupted Draco's isolation, but it was negligible. It left Draco with his thoughts, whirling in a mess that had been afflicting him for hours.
"No problem," Ron said. "It's all good. So… Jill, right?" He accepted the hand Jill offered, matching her smile with one of his own. "We're gonna be a partnered group?"
Draco nodded immediately. "Of course, Mrs. Evans. In an instant."
Just like, as was starkly apparent, Jackie was apparently stunned by the sight of Pansy.
Harry shrugged. "I suppose. I don't know all that much about the process, but I reckon it'd have to be pretty crazy trying to sort it all out."
Draco tipped his head in what wasn't quite a nod. "If you'll have me."
"It wasn't," Draco said with a return of his small smirk. "Which is what makes it even funnier."
A slow smile crept its way across Harry's face. It wasn't a fake smile; not the kind that he wore before the camera. Draco was quietly pleased that, when it came down to just the two of them, Harry rarely seemed to paint that smile upon his face anymore. "I think," he said, a little chidingly, "that you would have to be a bit of an asshole to demand something like that."
Harry couldn't move. He couldn't find his voice to reply - not as Gertrude stared at him, and not even when the majority of the lights in the room abruptly dimmed. He stared at her through the ensuing spotlight brightness fixed upon them both, and she stared at him in return, smile small again and waiting.
"Hm."
"You too," she said. "Don't think I've overlooked you, Draco Malfoy."
"No, you're not," he murmured.
It was all wonderful. Terrifying. Unbelievable had Harry not witnessed it for himself.
Draco slipped a hand from where he'd returned to grasping Harry's thighs. He dropped it instead atop Harry's own, squeezing his fingers in a convulsive grasp atop his chest. "You feel so – so –"
he thought, propping his hands upon his hips.
"Oh, can you put the kettle on for me, Gin?" Hermione asked, raising her voice. "I'll have a peppermint tea, if you would."
"Tell me about it." Ron rolled his eyes, though shot Hermione a fond glance in the same motion. "Though some people probably disagree."
Draco hardly noticed when Ipetsky lurched into motion. He barely heard the sharp, spitting, "shit. Dammit, Malfoy, you – you didn't –" before stuttering into growling curses. He was hardly even aware of the moment that Ipesky snatched his wand from his jeans and, swinging in a wild turn with barely more than a glance towards Harry and a frustrated groan, disappeared in a crack of Apparition.
"I don't know," he said. "It's just something he's started doing lately."
"Fuck off."
Maybe Abel was a shy kid, just as Jill had said. Harry knew precious little about him other than that he was quiet, rarely contributed, and seemed content to follow Jill around like a puppy whenever she joined them in C&C. But it didn't really matter that he didn't know him; to an extent, Abel was like himself, like Jackie and Jill, and that made him worth helping.
It wasn't looking to be a good day so far, and a part of Draco, the immature part of him that still clung to the entitled and admittedly spoilt child he'd once been, urged him to say to hell with it. To just go home. To leave the world for the day to sort itself out, because he couldn't face it. Draco knew he wouldn't, but the thought was unerringly tempting.
"No, not briefly. I'm not saying that more travel in the future isn't on the table, because I'd love it to be, but sticking around for a while seems like the best option."
"Jackie, magic was fun," Harry said, breaking into her animated spiel that included more arm waving than she likely needed, "but it's the
"Harry too," Jackie said, shooting Harry an exasperated glance. "For someone who apparently prefers sport over school, he does far less actual sporting than he does homework. You're a failure of a jock, Harry."
"About the other day," Harry finally said. "In Potions."
"Kind of." His voice was growing strangled now, and Harry couldn't quite work out the exact reason why. It wasn't quite awkwardness from but something like it. Not quite embarrassment either, though that felt a little closer to the mark. Tucking his face into the cradle of his arms, Harry spoke as much to the dark crevice in his lap as to Draco. "I really like it. It makes me feel calmer for some reason. Just touching, or whatever. I don't even care how that sounds, 'cause it's true."
Draco frowned. "Experience?" he said. His eyes narrowed slightly as he eyed Harry. "I had wondered with yourself and Jacqueline –"
"Yeah, I haven't forgotten." In spite of his teasing words, Ron's smile died. "You never got that?"
"True."
Jackie grinned. "You will if you love me."
"Never better."
Harry slowly lowered his gaze down to his textbook once more. Considering only Cragstone's description, such a short segment when compared to the rest of the mind-numbing chapter, almost made him uneasy. Harry pursed his lips again. "You reckon I only have to read this bit?"
"Maybe for you," Hermione retorted. "I have important things to listen out for."
A pause met Harry's question and, when he glanced up at his friends, they were all eyeing one another not quite sheepishly. He didn't call them out any further. After all, what did he care that they bet so immaturely upon just about anything these days? This was one area of their communal teasing that always seemed to be at Harry's expense rather than including him, but he didn't mind. Not really. When they actually had the money to do so, why not? None of them had really had the opportunity to live properly as children in their teenage years.
"Padfoot, don't be an arse," James said, sounding every inch his mental age.
"This room always brings out the best in people, hon," Calliope said, gentle and soft, like a soothing balm to the abrupt ache that had taken up residence in Harry's chest. "The best and the worst. The good and the bad."
, he thought to himself, sliding down in his seat and tucking a heel up as he lifted his book once more. "A little help would be nice, though," he muttered, as much to himself as to Jackie.
Pansy's smile was small but fierce. Unexpectedly so, Draco thought, because despite her initial benevolent performance, she rarely showed such sincerity. Rarely to never, in Draco's experience. "Then we're of a like-mindedness. I doubt the assumption of your own role is entirely pure of intention either."
Draco's frown sat so low it shadowed his eyes. His jaw visibly clenched, a muscle bulging slightly before releasing. "It would be the logical assumption and subsequent reaction," he said slowly, as though speaking to someone particularly dim-witted. "I just professed that I had feelings for you, while you've been using me as a well-padded and insulated seat for the past several months –"
But Ron nodded immediately. "Definitely. She's not into thinking stuff like that. I mean, of all people, can you think of anyone who would be less likely to pick on someone for that kind of stuff?"
Harry Potter!" the girl exclaimed, eyes brightening. She clasped his hand in both of hers and squeezed it enthusiastically. Then, all but bouncing in her heeled shoes, she dove into a rapid torrent of German that Harry hadn't a hope of discerning the meaning of.
Why it was alright if Harry was touching Draco, sitting on him, leaning against him, and yet to receive a hug from Ginny or a touch from Ron, a pat from Hermione or the bump of a shoulder from any other one of his classmates left him distinctly uneasy, Harry didn't know. He wasn't sure he'd ever know. All he could think was that, while the brush of a hand felt wrong, too close, too compassionate and affectionate, and too loaded with the potential for instant recoil, when it came to Draco all of that didn't seem to matter.
"Screaming?"
"Dude, no." Jackie pulled a face. "Way, way too early for that."
Draco didn't meet her attentive gaze. Instead, he drew his own from his plate towards Harry once more. "Somewhat, yes," he said.
He knew Bellatrix was insane, that she had an agenda, and that Harry played a part in that agenda. That she had a lord and she was, somehow, working to bring him back. To life? Possibly. Probably. Harry had deduced that much.
It was such a backhanded compliment that Harry almost thought it was a criticism. He found himself swallowing a smile a moment later, however; Malfoy was still a bit of a prat, it seemed. "Didn't think you noticed."
Shaken from rumination, Harry glanced across the table towards him. Draco's face had hardened, his lips thinned in that way that Harry had recognised in recent months meant he was sorely tempted to speak, even to rant and rave, but that the inhibitions born from a hateful world held him back. He stabbed his omelette, however, his disgruntlement redirected.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's fine," Draco said. "I'm not bothered to get up right now anyway."
Not quite as soothing as the presence of a warm body leaning against his own, however.
"That's incredible," Draco breathed, staring at the card raised in Harry's hand. "How did you do that?"
"I can't change how I acted."
"I said
"Asking me to consider all of your classmates worthy of respect is both ludicrous and impossible," Draco grumbled. He sounded like a petulant child, right down to twist of his lips.
"I appreciate your confidence in me," Jackie said, momentary annoyance displaced by a grin.
"Isn't it? Although, from an alternate angle, Ewon McAllister would certainly not have been awarded third most-handsome bachelor in Wizarding Britain had I not preached of his skill in wooing."
Impossible.
Jackie sniffed, plucking at a loose thread of her fingerless gloves. "Whatever. I have incentive now."
"Because I'm a Malfoy. My name doesn't elicit as much respect as it used to. Quite the opposite, actually, given certain family relations. History speaks for itself."
Ron slept. How he managed, Harry didn't know, but he'd always been a fast sleeper. They'd spoken quietly, shortly, before bed that evening, murmured words of little consequence – "Hermione wanted to head to Hogsmeade this weekend for Christmas shopping," and "Cool. Maybe I'll come this time" – but Ron's eyelids drooped and he didn't last long. Harry envied him that. When was the last time he'd fallen to sleep without a struggle? He didn't know. It felt like a long time.
Harry swallowed again. The buzz of voices hummed in his ears, a hitched clatter of noise that suggested shooting was minutes away, but he couldn't tear himself away from Gertrude's stare. He could barely blink himself. Facing a Death Eater was one thing, and it was terrifying. Facing Voldemort was another entirely, and that had been a whole new level of terror. The deaths of the war had been fear-inducing for different reasons, and the chaos that had gripped the Wizarding world before Kingsley Shacklebolt became the new Minister for Magic was overwhelming, and stressful, and dizzying. The interviews, the paparazzi, the questions and praise and congratulations…
Keeping his smile fixed, Harry lowered his gaze to his wine, swirling it idly. "I don't know. I think Dot's planning on turning away most offers for a while. We're expecting outcry about something or other, or hyper-focus – which wouldn't be the first time and is far from pleasant."
"You don't have to," he muttered, absently relieved that his jaw wasn't quite as painful as it could have been. Not broken, then. Not dislocated.
And he was here. In Potting Point. After school hours.
"Expressly instantaneously," James said, jabbing a finger at him with such obvious undertones that Harry couldn't help but roll his eyes. "I don't care if this is a Muggle hospital –"
"Another?" Draco's eyebrow rose further. "Another
"Draco?" he asked, lowly and almost tentatively. "What was that about?"
"I dunno. I think I maybe hoped so." He eyed a handful of men and women barely older than himself in floor-length robes with sweeping sleeves. It was about as far from modern fashion as possible, and Harry wasn't exactly the bee's knees when it came to such sensibilities. "What happens if a Muggle wanders in here or something?"
"I said move aside, girl, unless you want to join the dead."
"I've just had the kettle on," she said, reaching for and raising a mug nearly as big as her own head. From the heaviness of her eyes, bleary behind her glasses, it was clear she needed it.
"Actually, it's –"
He turned the page of the magazine and scanned the printed writing, barely attending to what he read. It didn't surprise him to hear that Malfoy was a photographer, or that Parkinson was a journalist, or that Zabini owned a winery three countries away. Maybe four years ago, in the midst of a war and their pain, and hatred, and grief, but now?
A not-argument began over recolouring the curtains, and they quickly evolved into an even more abrasive mess of shades. Harry couldn't watch the argument ensue of too long; the curtains were already starting to give him a headache.
Tucking a foot onto the edge of his seat, Harry slouched back into his chair with a nonchalance he didn't feel. He fiddled with the rose as he pursed his lips. "No, this isn't 'real magic'. It's just a trick. I had it up my sleeve."
Edging around the room, using it as a crutch to keep himself upright and growing only slightly more confident with every step, Harry crept towards the door. Or he tried to creep; the scuffing of his socked feet seemed far too loud to his ears. He was sure that, however far away Bellatrix was, she must certainly hear it. Between that and his thundering heartbeat, it felt certain that she would hear his every move.
When Harry turned up at Hogwarts, Draco had made up his mind. Without breaking his cover and thus the trust of his cohorts, Draco was going to do his utmost to protect Harry and help him do whatever he needed to do to defeat the Dark Lord. Which meant that he quietly ordered Vince and Greg to Disillusion themselves so that the three of them could wait for Harry to show up.
When he woke up in the morning, he was free from the alcohol AND the Veritaserum, wearing only his pants while Harry clutched him like a teddybear in his sleep. For a good two full minutes, Draco was happier than he'd ever been in his life, but then reality reinserted itself.
Draco simply rolled off Harry and watched him get up and run off toward the voice that was getting closer to where they were hiding in a small clump of trees near the lake. Grinning like an idiot, Draco slowly got up, brushed himself off, and leisurely walked back to the castle.
Harry frowned in confusion. “Is that a yes or a no?”
Then she turned around with a chuffed smile and strutted to Draco until she could grandly present him with the mug.
Determined to ignore him, Draco stepped around him, but Harry just HAD to stick his nose in Draco's business: “Where're you going?” He demanded.
That night, Harry took off his shirt – since it was hot and stuffy in his cupboard anyway – and stared at his arm as he waited for his imaginary friend to say something.
Blaise and Pansy exchanged catty grins. “Hold your Hinkypunks! We're here!”
There was a deafening silence for a long moment as everyone held their breaths to see what had happened. Sheer chaos returned as the whole hall broke into tumultuous cheers. Everyone swarmed Harry trying to hug or at least touch some part of him. Even Draco managed to squeeze in and catch his hand for a moment before slipping away and finally going to his parents, who were standing together in a corner and both looked like they were about to faint from the relief of the Dark Lord dying. When they saw him coming, they let out sobs of even greater relief and held their arms open for him.
“I look like you!” Harry blurted out in bafflement, scratching his head. “Aren't I SUPPOSED to look like someone no one knows?”
Not daunted in the slightest, Amanda turned her smile on him. “That's because I was in with those studying for their NEWTS while you were with the Sixth Years. It was a big group. I don't blame you for not remembering every face there.”
After a moment, Vernon's expression turned weird and he loosened his grip on Harry so that he could hold him still with one hand to the throat while the other tickled his armpit.
When everything was said and done, the massive battle that ensued as the Sixth Year students closed in on the exit to the Maze got rather heated, and not exactly, erm... sporting. The flag changed hands so often that it was difficult to keep track of which House was winning. Even the students had trouble keeping track as often a student would accidentally steal it from one of their own Housemates.
At first, Draco decided that his best bet was to not look at Harry at all and pretend that he had no idea who the boy was. However, his plan was immediately foiled because everyone was eager to have him confirm Harry's identity. Lucky for him, everyone was so focused on Harry's face that they weren't looking at Draco's. Draco felt a moment of concern – which probably showed on his face – over how distressingly abused Harry looked.
Before Harry could gather up his wits, Draco cast all the spells necessary to turn Harry over, have a few pillows under his hips for proper elevation and support, and then re-secure everything so that Harry couldn't escape even if it occurred to him to try.
When he was looking in the mirror, it took him a moment to notice that Harry was behind him in the entrance of the shop. His first response was happiness to see his Soulmate followed by an immediate urge to punch him in the face. But rather than focus on Harry and give anything important away, his eyes flickered to the other two and narrowed in distaste.
Petunia gave him a look of suspicious disbelief. To Harry's relief, she insisted Vernon leave the room before he could look at Harry again.
James (the younger) nudged her with his elbow. “No use in chickening out now. We summoned them to answer questions, and that means answering questions in return.”
Draco tilted his head in invitation, a look of pure challenge in his eyes. His target promptly grinned and pounded his best mate on the back. “Looks like I'm about to be very busy for the rest of the night! Don't wait up for me!”
Pansy looked hurt, but nodded in understanding. “Of course. Of course you're exhausted. I'll go for now, but I'll be back in the morning.”
Draco smirked. “Well, some of them are, but I think I look a bit better in blue.”
Draco licked the drop as requested, and then turned to smirk at Astoria's sister. “Does that mean you don't actually plan to marry him, Daphne?”
When Draco pulled back enough to work open Harry's trousers too, that's when he noticed the hesitation in Harry's eyes. “Something the matter?”
“You once tried to cast the Cruciatus Curse on me,” Harry pointed out, then mentally smacked himself for bringing up the night he nearly murdered Draco.
I'm not so much of a goddamned asshole as to tell you to study the wrong thing."
"Good afternoon, sweetheart," she said. "How was your day?"
"I was in the drama hall," she explained, scooting around the table to drop into the spare chair at Harry's other side. "My monologue isn't exactly coming along great."
Draco blinked up at them, eyes hooded and expression carefully blank. "I'm sorry, can I help you?"
"What?" Harry asked, peering at where Blaise, leading the line, had drawn a small pouch from his pocket and begun extracting coins. "Wait, are those -?"
A hand drifted around Harry's back, around his waist, and fingers hooked into the back of his shirt.
"That's so cool," Ron breathed.
Draco had already been in a disgruntled mood. Pansy, for all of her taunting and tempting, dangling the potential carrot of her contract with
Harry had never been big. He wasn't tiny either – or at least hadn't been in his later years at school – and stood barely an inch or two shorter than Draco. It made him short by modelling standards, but not small.
"Mm." Draco certainly agreed on that. The girl was something. "And her stare."
"Nah, I'm not on today," Sirius replied.
"The tenth century?" Jackie said, voice rising. She sounded almost impressed. Or horrified, perhaps; Harry often found it difficult to tell the difference. "How is something even that old?"
The man didn't need to reply. He followed like a dog on Harry's heel as Harry wove back through the club, leaving any thoughts of Draco, work, and anything at all behind him.
"Probably 'cause they are," Ron muttered. "I wouldn't take it personal or anything."
Harry blinked. Portraits. They were just portraits.
be there, that he should
"No studying. I mean none, like, yeah? At all. And yes, that includes you too, Hermione."
That Harry found his own feet leading him to the Slytherin table was only partially surprising. The numbers worked out, after all, and when he considered the class as a whole… the ex-Slytherins weren't ostracised anymore, or at least no more than they afflicted upon themselves, but wariness and awkwardness still radiated from their corner of the room. Harry had already crossed the dividing line a handful of times that year, spoken up when he could even if he didn't really want to, if only to set an example for others to follow. It was a strange phenomenon, but if he'd learned anything in the past few months it was that people watched him whether he wanted them to or not. They watched him and, sometimes, they even followed. He may as well make the most of the unwanted attention.
Blaise made quotations in the air to accompany his words before folding his arms across his chest. He smirked as he watched Harry consider his words.
Harry blinked. He stared at Draco for a moment before shrugging and raising his hand to his hair once more. "Either way, it doesn't change the underlying problems. Von still despairs over my hair. I think he's compensating."
Harry nodded. That much he could believe. Unexpectedly, it didn't hurt to think of being told such a thing either. Harry was far from confident in the stability of their relationship, for how could he be when their 'relationship' was barely days old? Yet somehow, that Draco would openly tell him if he was busy or not in the mood eased his concerns. Rarely had Draco ever cancelled on their weekend study sessions, but each time it hadn't seemed for a reluctance to see Harry.
"I went to my call-in for
Like how many of the witch hunts hadn't been of real witches, and that those who had been involved saw it as a special brand of entertainment and daring to tempt fate and avoid the flame or the noose. Or how the controversy over Jasper Maskelyne's contribution to World War Two had more to do with the Wizarding world's struggle to cover up his unlawful meddling than any issue of truth.
"Let me guess," Harry said, turning back towards him. "You wanted to whine at me about magic again."
"You don't?"
Hermione sighed with fond exasperation. "You really have no clue of what I do in my job, do you?" she said, her tone making it apparent that she spoke rhetorically.
Harry flapped a hand at him. "Whatever. Anyway, he was a Slytherin, so now everyone since he was around who is in Slytherin too has a black mark against their name?"
"A menace to society?" Draco chuckled as he swept up the little pile of ash with a flick of his wand. "Well, that's a little more imaginative than most, I suppose."
"Copy it from Hermione's seeing as that's the original one."
Instead, turning his vague gaze out to the Dragon's Nest common room instead, he folded his arms and laid his cheek down on top of them. The room had lost most of its inhabitants to their dormitories, leaving the space feeling larger than usual. It wasn't a big tower to begin with, so the feeling was appreciated.
He trailed off, and the silence that followed reverberated in Harry's ear. He almost couldn't breathe, his breath coming in stutters. His other hand rose to cusp the phone against his ear, and in the midst of a ballooning, incredibly warm swell in his chest, Harry realised he was nodding almost desperately.
He'd heard it before. Essentially, Draco had heard it only the previous day. But just as it felt different speaking his own feelings aloud that morning, if felt different hearing Harry's, too.
"Even though you hate the Phys Ed locker rooms and everyone involved in the subject?" Harry asked.
The frenzy, the fervour, the maddened laughter that arose when those very drugs took hold, and the subsequent collapses, or more vomiting, or the seizure he'd witnessed once when someone had tried a bad batch.
"I want to go home," Harry murmured to himself, not for the first time since he'd woken in the foreign, closed room, subject to the whims of a madwoman. Squeezing his eyes closed, he wished for it so hard that surely,
Harry was at a momentary loss. Was the name supposed to be private? A Hogwarts secret or something? "Why would you call your A-levels newts?" he asked.
It had become a Friday night tradition amongst them. Though Harry's friends invaded his flat at any given moment, and similarly invaded Hermione's house whenever Ginny could all but kidnap Harry to join them, the club had become a habit that was as ingrained as Harry's work schedule. It was easy to set it on a Friday night, easy to come after work finished, because work for each of them ended as variably as the rest of their schedules.
"I did bad things. Everyone did, I know, but especially me. Sometimes, when I hold my wand, I can hardly even move my hand to conjure something as simple as a
A week ago, the Hogwarts students had come to Potting Point High for the first time. A week ago, Jackie had all but dragged Harry towards the cluster of students his two barely-acquaintances Ron and Hermione had deemed necessary to warn them away from. Harry had barely thought about the meeting again for the rest of the week.
"Yes, quite some time." The flower spun in Malfoy's fingers and he gave a smile that was almost but not quite a smirk. "I never would have considered the possibility of you eventually returning my feelings."
DRACO MALFOY, AN UNRELENTING VILLAIN
"True enough."
Words died in Harry's mouth. Whatever he'd meant to say was washed aside as though it had never existed in the first place. Staring at Draco, the words hanging in his ears, for a moment Harry was at a complete loss. His anger dissolved. His frustration was swiftly waned. Even his annoyance dwindled into nothingness.
"What do you mean by that?" he asked, almost warily.
Pansy's scoff somehow didn't sound like a scoff. More like a sigh, almost a silent whimper of longing. Shaking her head, she drew her gaze sidelong, skimming across the empty common room. It took her a moment to gather herself, to shake aside whatever conflict lay within her just beneath the surface, and when she turned back to Harry there was a hint of her usual aloof and slightly contemptuous confidence.
"More's the photographer that I have an objection to. I should find a new one."
Ginny laughed. "'Playing' in the loosest sense of the term. She's actually pretty good on a broom but lacks a competitive streak so much that I don't think winning is even a word in her vocabulary."
"Thanks."
Harry, dragging his own attention from them – was it really so interesting? – blinked towards Jill. "Um… Yeah, no, it was alright." Then he paused. "Wait, scratch that, it was complete bollocks. No one but me did any work."
Jackie scowled. "Alright, nerd, what do you suggest?"
"Thanks," Harry murmured, cheek resting against Draco's shoulder that didn't feel as disagreeably hard as it perhaps should have.
"Or with those birds, or how you said your phone miraculously worked when it was 'broken', or when you forgot your umbrella and –"
"What are you doing here?" Harry asked, more than a little desperate.
Harry almost immediately tuned them out. They'd fallen into such exchanges more and more often of late, and while Harry didn't begrudge them their odd form of flirting, he wasn't particularly inclined to listen to it.
Draco arched an eyebrow. He dabbed the end of his nose with a finger. Then, eyeing Harry with a shrewd stare, swiped a finger in his own chocolate brown and bright orange scoop. He was smearing it across Harry's cheek before Harry had the chance to duck away from him.
"We have the shoot tomorrow," Harry said absently. Then he almost winced.
Drawing his gaze from where his parents had secluded themselves in the corner of the room, Harry rolled his eyes at her. "Sure, Jackie, that's exactly what I'm doing."
"Don't I?" Malfoy asked, smirk that apparently wasn't quite so uncharacteristic of him nowadays widening further.
Leaning over the tray before him, Draco agitated the distilled water within with gentle, deliberate nudges. The glare of the shadowed red light throughout the room, pooling in even the darkest corners, gave the water an uncanny resemblance to blood, but that similarity was one that Draco had long ago learnt to overlook. It was worth it to produce his photographs in such a primal, involved manner.
Her slap caught him across his face in a fierce blow. It was strong, her arm so strong, that even seated Harry was thrown to the floor at his side. Bellatrix shrieked her frustration, feet stomping, and Harry could only scramble to sit up once more, to press himself into his corner and make himself as small as he could.
The foyer was open and echoing with the sound of heeled shoes, hurrying feet, and general haste as it always was. More so than Harry was used to when he entered, for he'd arrived later that day in the company of his friends than he usually did. Crossing towards the double-seated receptionist's desk, he extracted his arm from Ginny's to wave a hand at the man and woman seated behind.
"You have a standard? As far as I'm concerned, I'm the one who –"
"A proper answer?" Draco echoed, almost faintly.
"What, you?" Harry feigned surprise. "I would never have picked it."
As Clementine strode towards Draco and Harry in confident steps, she carried with her an air of professionalism, of superiority without condescension, that immediately made Draco feel just a little small even without consideration for her height. Not even the small smile that touched her lips alleviated that, nor that she immediately stuck out a hand towards Draco as soon as she was close enough to suitably offer it.
"I think so," Harry murmured, though for Draco's ears alone. Almost surprising himself – for barely an hour before it had been the furthest thing from his mind – he managed a smile.
Draco's lips twitched again. "Appropriate."
"Then why -?"
Von chuckled as he plucked a vial from its shelf. He squinted at it briefly, raised it to his nose for a sniff, before pouring it into his own cup of coffee. "Bless his soul."
Pansy's lips parted, but it was Draco who replied. "You," he said slowly, then paused for a beat before continuing. "What are you really –?"
"Because I said I would." Draco turned towards him, and Harry wasn't quite quick enough to snap his gaze away. "I don't know what you've heard of our school, but I did see you speaking to Weasley and Granger last week. I know that, by and large, most of the stories they'd tell you of Slytherins are unfavourable, but I'll at least stand by my word. Besides, I said I meant what I said. I'm curious about you."
In such a short time, Draco have come to realise just how much he didn't want that. After what had happened with Ipetsky, what he'd seen, what had followed, the way the photoshoot the next day had felt so distinctly different… How could Draco not think otherwise?
"These private school kids," Lily's voice took on a shrewd edge. "This wouldn't be the boyfriend you've been so secretive about, would it?"
want it, so why not? He allowed himself to sink into the thick taste, the heat of Simon's hands, and the weight of him as he pressed Harry into the unfamiliar bed to be lost in skin, and warmth, and gasping breath.
"Understandable," Draco said. He reached a hand for Harry's as his fingers tangled between themselves. "It hasn't been so long as for anyone to be okay with it just yet."
But he did. He had. And despite the warning signs that bespoke promise of the day getting only worse, Draco stayed at work.
"Hey," he said, stopping at the edge of the table. "Seamus has made a decree, you know. No studying tonight, and that includes you. Even Hermione agreed, though not in so many words."
Silence, and just… nothing.
Dimitri gave her a crisp smile. He was a short man, slightly plump, and he somehow filled the doorway despite his diminutive stature. His spiked hair, gelled precisely to quilled points, matching the cropped goatee upon his chin, spoke of one who took pride in his appearance. That much was even more apparent from the sleek lines of his trousers, his fitted vest and the folds of his overlong collar. Draco could respect that in a person. He'd never quite understood how anyone could step outside of their house without showing their best to the world. It would leave them far too open to attack.
Pansy opened her mouth to retort, then paused. Her eyes narrowed. She glanced at Harry, back at Draco, then to Harry again. Something like understanding dawned, flicking aside the residues of her blank mask. "Oh. You've got to be kidding me."
"That's…"
"For the bet, or a drink?"
"Lily doesn't get angry."
Morning came too soon. Breakfast passed too quickly.
"How long does your school get off over the Christmas period?" Draco asked, leaning against the side of the wall with all of the casual, elegant grace Harry knew came so easily to him. Maybe there was something to be said for an aristocratic upbringing; Harry was sure he couldn't make a simple slouch look so classy.
"Altogether?" Pansy tapped her chin with a finger. "About sixty, last counted."
That was it. That was all of it. Draco didn't thank Potter, and he didn't have the chance after Potter turned and walked away, weaving through the crowd that skittered aside and practically parted for his passage anyway. He didn't talk to Potter after that at all, for that matter. He hadn't been close enough, and he hadn't even seen him but in photographs.
Then he pulled his gun. Or it should have been a gun, even if he rarely had a need for it. James was licensed, an armed officer when on call, and it would have been understandable. Far more understandable than a wand.
"What's that about, then?" Harry asked, returning to his magazine and the supposedly 'stunning' story of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez's wedding plans. It was unremarkable drivel, but he read it anyway, as much for the pictures as the article. J-Lo always had decent fashion sense.
If it could be called enthusiasm, that was. C&C was never a particularly enthusiastic class in Harry's experience.
and that there really was no doubt that he was good-looking. Harry couldn't withhold his answering grin.
"Will it?"
Draco hardly noticed. He hadn't any particular interest in the recruiting process, but he'd heard so much about Pansy's work directly from her that he couldn't help but be a little invested. Besides, some of the pictures were truly dismal.
"Again, understandably. It was a… a horrible thing. Any parent would be terrified."
"I'm off," he said, breaking into James' assurances.
"Right."
He thought about using magic. About Apparating. Hell, he even tried it.
But most importantly, and perhaps the most common uniting feature: he shouldn't be anywhere near Harry Potter.
"Yeah, pretty much. I've never travelled before, so now seemed as good a time as any."
"No," Draco said, though it was emitted as more of a growl.
Harry didn't know, but it was. A stupid fucking problem, because in spite of everything he, Jackie, and Jill all declared at school, despite everything they retorted to the arseholes that were Jacob and his groupies, it still felt like he was doing something wrong. Breaking some rule. The heavy feeling of unease that plagued Harry every time he stepped outside with Draco, prodding him whenever he felt the urge to take Draco's hand in public or forced him to smother the urge to reach for and kiss him, properly manifested into depressing understanding.
"Thank you. I take that as a compliment."
"Do you?" Harry asked, keeping his tone as casual as he could manage.
to be here, then," Jackie said shortly. "Just drop the unit if you're not going to do the proper work."
The greater part couldn't accept it. He couldn't. He didn't want to, because that would be to accept something far bigger and deeper than Harry had considered possible for himself. It would mean that somewhere along the way his concern for Draco had grown into something more. It meant that he cared for him as a friend but also as something beyond that. It meant that, far from the rivalry or even disregard they'd once shared, Draco had become someone important, and Harry hadn't even realised it until then, let alone told Draco about it.
No more chaffing at the bit. That bit sat comfortably, just as the reins settled confidently in Dot's hands as she navigated him through still-persistent fans, and paparazzi, and just about anyone who'd opened a magazine in London in the past three years. Harry was happy to let her have it.
It was cold, but Harry's enthusiasm staved off the chill. The breeze was icy and crisp, but it seemed to coax him on rather than hold him back. It had been less than a week since he'd travelled to London to see the museum and a little over a day since he'd last seen Draco, but the hours seemed so much longer than they should have. It wasn't Draco's fault that he couldn't visit the previous evening as he so often did, and not because their pretence of studying had been discovered. Harry didn't bother to feign studiousness as he ducked out the door every night.
Someone steadied him with a hand on his shoulder in return. Someone else nudged him away from the mix of dancers who weren't even dancing properly anymore. A step, another guiding hand that seemed more like a hand to hold him up, and then Harry was staggering free from what felt like too many people. Only to trip over something – someone? A foot? His own foot – and tumble forwards belly first.
Comfortable. Just like sitting in his lap, and just as inexplicably.
Harry's smile became a full grin, and he dove in for a crushing kiss once more. When Draco leant up towards him, pushing his mouth against Harry's own and parting his lips to suck him in with thirsty desire, Harry sunk to meet him. Only when he managed to claw his way free for a momentary breather did he speak again.
"I know," Harry said, and likely he truly did. Draco knew he would have and could accept that he did, but in some ways, despite that even to simply look at him would give evidence that he was model material, it still struck Draco that he was a very different person to the boy he'd once known.
"I'd actually rather you didn't imagine me in the sack with anyone, to be honest," Harry said, more to himself than to Ron.
"I'm not," Harry said.
"I've done you a favour," Pansy said, flicking her finger at him once more. "Don't pretend you're not hungry for it. You've wanted to shoot Potter for how long now?"
"You gonna come with?"
"They live in a castle," Abel said quietly from Jill's shoulder, talking more to his toes than to Jackie. "It's in the mountains with only a small town nearby. They have a slightly different curriculum, or so it seems from what Ron and Hermione have told us." He hitched his shoulders in his version of a shrug. "Something like that. Ron mentioned they play a sport called quidditch, too, though he didn't really explain what it's about too well."
"Why the bloody hell did you buy me a dress?" Harry couldn't help but ask for the umpteenth time.
Ron laughed, leading her through the arched entrance, but Harry barely heard that either. Ducking away from his friends unnoticed, he slipped through the thin stream of students, shared a brief smile with Wayne, brushed by Su's shoulder, and picked up his pace as the majority of them fell away to leave only a handful interspersed in its wake.
(See the end of the chapter for
That was it. That was the worst part. The letter writer made sense. Just as it made sense when it had flatly and cruelly torn him apart for his past actions as a Death Eater. The writer had done their research, and it was almost eerie.
that's was fun, not its history or relevance to society or whatever."
Ginny eyed him sceptically. "What, and deprive you of what little you're actually eating?"
"How do you know about that?" Draco asked, his voice shaking.
As with every time that anyone referred to or even mentioned his abduction, Harry's stomach clenched. The flux of nausea wasn't quite as fierce as it had been a fortnight or even a week before, but he could still taste the unsavoury tang of bile at the back of his throat.
Maybe. Just maybe.
A/N: WARNING - blatant homophobia makes an appearance. Again. Sorry.
"There's always an easier path. But not for me. Not in this instance. That wasn't the one I was put on."
"An owl?" Draco asked.
Draco blinked. The hint of a frown touched his brow before smoothing away almost immediately. "I was under the impression that was the desired outcome of our conversation."
And maybe to Harry. Possibly, maybe, just a little, though watching as Harry stared at the empty doorway, Draco couldn't be sure. He hadn't a bloody clue.
"I didn't really mean it to be. Better to be obvious with these kinds of things than to give leeway for misinterpretation."
Draco's hand almost flattened over his face, covering most of it. "You really didn't know." It was less of a question than a bland statement of fact.
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
Harry's smile widened. "Sounds like a pretty good plan to me."
Draco wasn't sure, but the thought triggered another than had been itching at him for the past hours. A naggingly persistent thought that had grown more and more intense throughout Pansy's interview with the sense of wrongness.
"Actually, we do." Pansy sniffed. "Some fool on the Board of Directors decided three years ago to make Muggle Studies obligatory for senior students. They're trying to expose us to people like you and integrate –"
As it turned out, they did. The ex-Hufflepuffs in particular seemed to have an inventory up their sleeves. In short order, the tower was flooded with sparkling charms, chanted words, and splashes of colour that flew through the air like flung paint. The effect was immediate and brightening more than just visually; at a glance, Harry could see smiles widening on faces and even heard a laugh or two.
"Murderer guy?" Draco interrupted, his lips twitching.
"I don't think it's something that should be brushed," Draco said sharply. His voice rose slightly, and though Harry knew that they were in a restaurant of mostly German or French-speakers, he couldn't help but dart a glance sidelong. "This is a problem. It's wrong."
"Well," Draco said, drawing out the word. He let his ensuing silence speak for itself.
"Is that curiosity I hear?" Ginny teased, still snickering. "Curiosity from – what was it that magazine called you the other day? The 'aloof and mysteriously distant' Harry Potter?"
"And Harry, your replacement pair is going to come out of your allowance for the next few months unless you can find your old ones."
. While most of the interviews had been booked to take place at
He wanted to touch him. To feel him. To make Draco feel as good as he'd made Harry feel. The longing was so intense it was almost overwhelming.
For a moment, Harry stared at his hand in persisting confusion. Then he extracted his own hand from his pocket, slowly but not warily, and placed it in Draco's. His fingers were still somehow cool, soft and get firm in their grasp, and that firmness was enough that Draco almost winced. Stabbing pains in those parts of him that he didn't understand the nature of hurt more than he'd considered was possible.
"Ostra –? Oh. No. Not really. I mean, we never had particularly deep conversations or anything, but Dudley and I used to play together sometimes with his friends. I always had breakfast and dinner with them and everything. My aunt and I actually used to cook in the kitchen a little bit together."
"I know, but –"
"If it wasn't me you were dating –"
Harry almost jumped as Von, appearing seemingly out of nowhere, dropped a hand onto his shoulder and tugged him further backwards as he in turn stepped forwards. Like a body shield, he planted himself before Harry, all but entirely blocking out the approaching paparazzi.
And yet it was all superficial. It was all seeing, and touching, and sex. Harry liked sex, liked it a lot, for that matter, and the urge to pursue the mindlessness of easy pleasure was sometimes a necessary balm to soothe what was otherwise an incomprehensible itch. But Harry wasn't so blind to pleasure to know that it wasn't enough. Not for him.
Mostly, however, were the Slytherins. Or the ex-Slytherins, as had been an announced distinction of the eighth years over dinner. He hadn't expected to see any of them return either, but maybe he should have. With the exception of Goyle, an absence that Harry felt guilty at feeling relieved by, every single one of them had returned. Maybe it was to be expected. Maybe, with the oppressive hatred trained upon anyone with any connection to Death Eaters these days, Hogwarts was the only safe place for them.
There, a stretch of a counter laden beneath glassware, bottles and beakers, stoppered vials and liquids of vibrant colours. As Harry glanced towards it, he saw one beaker, swirling with muddy, viscous fluid, burst a swamp-like bubble from its surface.
Maybe it was the casual dress, the return of his oversized jumper and plain jeans to replace what he'd been dressed in for the formalities of most of the day. Maybe it was the glasses. Or maybe it was that, when Harry looked at him, Draco felt as though he was actually being seen as himself, and there really was no hatred in his eyes. He just looked, and saw, and accepted.
"Where… do I want to go?"
Hermione nodded. Ginny was determinedly open about her exploits; she made a point of keeping Harry updated of when she was having a photoshoot, explaining that she deemed it 'relevant' to him because of his own job. "Yeah," Hermione said. "She burst into my house yesterday afternoon and it was all, 'Hermione, listen to what happened' for nearly an hour before I could actually get the whole story out of her. Unfortunately, Ron was over at the time, so…"
Jackie's smirk drew wide. "Seriously," she said. "On the proviso that, if you do actually lose your virginity, you have to tell me all about it."
Harry himself wasn't particularly partial to the club atmosphere – or at least to certain aspects of it. The dancing was fine, and he'd even become comfortable with stepping onto the dancefloor when he'd finally learnt what to do with his hands. The conversations privatised by the din and the occasional drink were a bonus, too.
"I don't really care. I'll go wherever. Wherever I'm asked to go or I'm needed, I suppose."
"You've used a darkroom before?" Harry asked, pausing in the act of pouring his own tea.
"And besides, you don't like me. Not really. Let's face it, Draco, even the sex has become a bit lack-lustre these days."
It was surprisingly unremarkable thenceforth, a breakfast much like any other. The only difference was that, without quite knowing how it happened, before he'd even finished his plate Harry found himself sitting almost completely in Malfoy's lap. 'How' seemed to be a bit of a confusing sequence of shifts and shuffles, but 'why' was a little less explainable. Why the hell Malfoy hadn't shoved him off with a huff, mostly. Why Harry didn't shove himself off, too.
"I think this is progress," he said. "Look at all the work we've done today."
"Of course not. Neither am I."
Draco thought.
He didn't want this. Not at all. Not
Harry certainly didn't dislike Samuel. He just didn't want to be in his company sometimes. It had nothing to do with how good a photographer he was, or how credible his name was. Samuel was a nice enough guy, and a good worker, but even so.
"Yeah. That."
"What?" Harry asked at the same time as Draco, their questions equally desperate, equally bewildered.
"You can come to dinner with me."
Draco scoffed. "I'm fine."
It was chic. Sophisticated. Minimalistic and refined, with dark, polished floors that reflected the soft, bright lighting overhead. Round tables scattered throughout, each draped in rippling white tablecloths and set with wine glasses and glistening cutlery. Throughout, a tinkling hum of music permeated that would have pleasantly offset any murmur of conversation that disrupted a private meal if any existed. It wasn't necessary just yet; there was barely a handful of diners within, and Draco couldn't say he thought less of the restaurant for it. The wide windows showed the sun had barely begun to retreat for the evening.
Just like Jill, for that matter, who had perched herself on the end of Harry's bed as soon as she'd come in, crossing her legs as she turned towards him with an open-face and a gentle touch to his foot. Draco too; he stood rigidly at Harry's side, as straight backed and blank-faced as the first time Harry had met him.
Draco blinked. Shaking himself slightly, his expression cleared into the quiet impassivity he always wore. "Lunch," he said with a short nod of his head. "Are you hungry?"
Those that strode towards him with rapid step and waving arms, already calling questions that had heads of fellow pedestrians turning and curious eyes narrowing, weren't visibly paparazzi. Or at least not at first. As Harry took a step backwards, however, he saw a camera appear from within the coat of one, a quill in the hand of another, and any doubts he'd held evaporated.
Unfortunately, Ron had taken that moment to finish off his drink. In a violent spray, he coated the table in spit and beer, spluttering and gasping as he did so. Hermione rocked in her seat, blinking at him owlishly – Harry wondered if she'd reached the blurry-eyed stage of her drunkenness yet – while Ginny burst into cackles of laughter.
"Who the fuck are you?" Keith asked.
Draco stared at Harry, then he stared at Jackie. It was Pansy who replied, however, with another sniff. "Well, you are."
Jackie nodded. "Definitely. Got any leftover dioramas from younger years?"
Glancing over his shoulder one final time, Harry caught a glimpse of Draco's pale head, his gaze lowered and expression blank. "Yeah," he said. "That."
What was he doing here? Draco picked at the sticky bar top, scowling to himself. Honestly, what how had he let himself be coaxed into coming to the club? It wasn't because of Pansy's bloody suggestion, even if he was incessantly aware of the weight of it hanging from his shoulder pointing him towards his camera. It wasn't because he was hoping to interrupt the companionable conversation occurring a dozen bodies down the line, because, much as he might want to, Draco knew he wouldn't.
He was tall and had a pair of noteworthy shoulders on him. He carried himself in a way that turned heads and drew eyes, only to deter most of those with a sharply raised eyebrow and a curl of his lip that immediately spoke of the prat that he was.
"Do you fancy me?"
"Shit! Goddammit!"
Had Draco left yet?
he thought. Then he shook his head. "I suppose it'll be alright, so long as we can decide on a topic to research."
"Have you forgotten what you came in here for?"
Shrugging again, Harry casually crossed the minimal distance between them and hooked an arm around Draco's waist. It felt surprisingly natural, easy, and utterly wonderful to be so close. So close in public specifically, and yet for once Harry didn't feel the need to glance over his shoulder for judging eyes.
Von muttered something else beneath his breath, but he sounded more amused that derisive when he continued. "You know, most people choose one of the other."
"... a deep breath. Come now, a deep breath. With me: in… and out… In… and out…"
"And who better to do it than Renee? She's incredible, Harry. Hell, if I was an apprentice still, I'd want to be training under her."
"Oh, sod off," Harry said, rolling his eyes. Draco flashed him a grin, however, and he couldn't help but reply in kind. "There's overprotective and then there's obsessive. I don't think Mum knows the difference."
Draco didn't pause for quite so long this time. "What do you mean?"
Stepping from the room, he shivered slightly as the fog and warmth diffused down the cool hallway. The sound of the air conditioning powered overhead, but it hadn't yet managed to take the chill off the morning. It was that chill that had kept Harry in bed for so long that morning as it was; only Draco's commitment to his work had coaxed him from their shared blankets.
"Hey," he said by way of greeting, glancing between Malfoy, Parkinson, and Zabini. "You're stuck for numbers too?"
"Not really," Harry said with a shrug, folding a leaf of spinach with his fork. "The days can just be pretty long sometimes, though."
"What's that?" Jackie asked, glancing between them both and Blaise's empty hand.
against her leg. They filed like water seeping through a delta when the elevator pinged open, and Draco duly followed.
Still, when he and Draco stepped into the crowded corridor amongst squishing and fleeing students, and when Draco tapped his elbow to gain his attention and draw him to the side, Harry stopped. He would have stopped even if the crowds around him had insisted on dragging him away with them with the force of mob mentality.
said kid on the other end of Draco's line.
"The ugly duckling?" Echoing was all he could manage.
Harry didn't even need to glance towards Ron to be aware of the lewd connotations of his remark. He could still see his shit-eating grin even without turning his way. "Sod off, you fucking ass," he muttered, hunching a little into his seat.
"You? Read books?"
Why a club would have such a blatant set up was ridiculous to him, but even as his heartbeat thudded in his ears louder than even the music, he supposed it was logical. Better the lust-blown fools seek privacy there than in the bathrooms. Better than on the dancefloor itself. Better than leaving and robbing the club of clients. It was almost too perfect, and despite himself, despite what he wanted, Draco felt almost sure that he would find Harry beyond it.
Draco snorted. "She says that, but she knows neither Blaise nor I will actually abide by her restrictions. Besides," he swept a hand through his hair with a sigh, "I just wanted to talk to her for a minute or two. About the posters."
"Taking such a vocal stance on controversial subjects?" Dot glanced down at the page of notes she'd been taking throughout their conversation. She grunted before nodding in a way that was more considering than agreeing. "Considering the subjects at hand, I think the majority of exposure articles will have to be kept from the Muggle world but… I'll work on it. You'll have to scrub up your public face, too – and scrub up everything else, for that matter – but I don't think it will be impossible."
She shrugged. “You'd probably snog everyone here, grope and grind on the dance floor, and take off to go shag your girl in about 10 minutes or less. The good news is that when the two of you DO decide to go shag, it also helps with your stamina, so you'll last a bit longer than normal.”
looked ready to go find a bed soon and shag their partner into it.
But no! He now had an owl! And she was real enough that she could land on him, put dead mice on his chest, and try to nibble on his fingers. Good thing he wasn't afraid of mice or spiders, having been raised in a cupboard.
Draco sighed impatiently and waved that away. “NOT for the club! I already know what to wear there.”
In a stroke of brilliance, Ron sank his hand into Harry's hair and yanked on it
After a moment of silence, in which the light above the call for help button was the only indication that they hadn't immediately been forgotten about, Draco looked over at Harry.
He was cut short when Harry's squeal turned into encouragement: “Yes, yes! DO IT!”
The first person singing just so happened to be Theo Nott, who started in a near whisper: “Let the
So, when Draco cornered him in the boys' bathroom again (although it HAD been a while), he didn't try to escape or argue. Wary, Draco held out his hands.
As the world seemed to fade, Draco stared vaguely at the ceiling, but still managed to see Harry's grief stricken face hovering over him. His hands were out like he wanted to grab Draco's hand – or perhaps his whole body – but was afraid to make things worse.
-for one off.
After Auror Ginger left the room, Ron turned a confused frown on Harry. “Oi, mate? I have no idea if I'm supposed to cover my eyes when I get dressed. This is some woman's naked body, and I'm pretty sure Mione would get mad at me for ogling it if she were here.” He focused very hard on his feet in order to get his knickers on without looking at the part between his legs.
The moment Draco was done shoving all his belongings in his bag, he spun to rush out of the dungeon, except a hand grabbed his arm and stopped him.
Even so, the kiss was...
Draco was silent as he thought this over for a few long minutes. Eventually he sighed. “Look, you know everything now – everything related to my feelings for you anyway. It's not like I can make the things I said not true. So really, it's not ME that has to make any sort of decision. Either date me, or let me go home.”
Until Harry showed up.
“Where do you want them?” The woman asked as Harry handed over the 18 Galleons they owed.
“Bathroom,” Ron grumbled with a shrug.
Luna got up and sang a beautiful and slightly Spanish sounding version of
No matter what Draco wrote after that, Harry refused to even look at his arm.
Narcissa looked to her husband, who forced a tiny and just barely polite smile. After taking a sip of wine, Lucius deigned to reply. “We've decided to name you as one of our Heirs – with all the privilege that entails.”
It wasn't until after he was back in his room with orders from his Aunt not to leave it again for the rest of the summer, that Harry realized that extreme events must override the curse, since neither his Aunt nor uncle – nor cousin – had tried to tickle him despite staring at him quite furiously.
Harry shook his head. “Oh hell no! You're going to wait until I strip you off too!”
Narcissa pressed her face to his chest and cried as silently as possible. Draco simply stroked her back for a few minutes, letting her cry without acknowledging it. When she was able to sit up and compose herself, she took hold of Draco's left hand – since she was sitting on his left side.
Scorpius stopped at the last moment, preventing them all from going any further, since he was in the lead. “What if dad murders us???”
Once again, Harry gave Draco every incentive to stay the entire weekend. When Draco woke up on Monday morning, he was in an excellent mood. He read Harry's note letting him know he'd gone to work, stretched languorously, and then Apparated home. One thing was clear, no matter WHO Harry was trying to date, Draco had an incentive to attend the
The dummy must have been magicked at some point to help the student, but now he barely had enough magic left in him to murmur a bit when Draco picked him up. Draco carried him over to the piano and – using all his new repair skills – figured out how to return the dummy's ability to talk. As he suspected, it was charmed to spout reassurances and compliments.
As Harry smiled and acknowledged cheers at the end of his song, Blaise interrupted everyone. “Oi, Potter, are you being serious with that song, or is it just something you fancied singing?”
Harry smiled at him. “Me too.”
This managed to cheer Harry up slightly. He smiled at Draco a bit wryly. “I suppose you would know...”
Draco shrugged. “Most of the time, I can manage it just fine. But if I DON'T – if I miss a... 'dose...' I'll die...”
Chuckling softly, Narcissa ruffled his hair. “It's perfect, my love.”
Snape ignored him and cast a spell to grab Harry and levitate him over to the rack – and then secure him to it.
Opening it, he quickly located the chapter on Soulmates.
“DON'T ASK THAT, MATE?!” Ron roared as he pulled the scanty shirt over his head. “I WANT TO LIVE?!”
Harry harrumphed, feeling inexplicably jealous. He pouted and glared, tempted to push Draco completely off him and smack him across the face. Instead, Draco laughed, shook his head, and kissed Harry again.
“Sadly,” Draco confirmed. “The girl I think I might marry is still in Hogwarts until the end of this year.” Which seeing as how the school year had only just begun, was basically the entire year.
Ron shook his head in amusement, but otherwise left him to sleep. In fact, Ron had more important things to focus on now that he was going home to his girlfriend.
“At all?” The bloke pressed hopefully.
Still extremely suspicious, Ron tilted his head to the side and peered at Blaise. “Yeah? What's that?”
Harry couldn't decide whether to chuckle or moan in pleasure. The tickling was simultaneously annoying and... good. He closed his eyes and surrendered to the feel of being shagged for the first time.
that Draco could sing, and not just sing, but bloody fucking
Harry held up his hands and waved them a bit frantically. “How is this MY fault?!”
Long and surprisingly gentle fingers tickled Harry's tight pucker, making Harry jump from being startled. He also gasped out a protest, but it was incoherent and more of a grunt than an actual word.
Draco stood up, looking
Draco scoffed, but since his cocoon was facing away from them, they basically ignored him.
magic in life-threatening situations —”
There was a pained sigh from across the room. “I can't
Draco sighed, feeling put upon. “And
“Morning,” Draco greeted.
“I'll be here, right after dinner with my parents,” Draco promised.
As it turned out, Harry had struggled so much during his tickle torture that the knots were impossible to untie, and so, Petunia had to use an extremely sharp knife to cut the ropes off. To Harry's surprise, she actually took enough care NOT to cut him. After about a good ten minutes of hard work, Harry was finally free and more than grateful to grab his bathrobe and head off to the bathroom to take a long hot shower.
On the other hand, unless it was Cho lying about not being a girl to throw him off, it was MALFOY!!! HOW and WHY in the hell was it MALFOY?!?!
Draco frowned. “But wait? Wouldn't that NOT be against the rules?”
Narcissa – having a lot more practice at taking insults with grace – placed her delicate hand on her son's shoulder. “It's alright, Draco. I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.”
“Licking or being licked?” Draco asked in amusement.
Heaving a great sigh, Vernon stood up and left the room, not bothering to free Harry from his bondage. This meant that Harry had to suffer the indignity of laying in a rapidly cooling puddle of urine until it was full dark.
“Oh go on!” She ordered, pushing him off the stage.
“Here here!” Ron cheered in agreement.
At the end of her song, she turned to Blaise. “Forgive me if I am wrong, but I have a strong feeling that Harry is next.”
When the music reached the right spot, he took a deep breath and began the soft and slow part. It was an American song, so not too many people knew it – especially since the Wizarding World didn't always listen to muggle music.
Draco growled in frustration. “I HAVE family and friends! I still... I still can't stand the thought of waking up tomorrow to find that nothing's changed. That I should be in Azkaban but I'm not. That my parents want me to be happy but I don't deserve a moment of it!”
out of your mouth.”
Blaise finally managed to get some of the men to take a turn. To be honest, it didn't matter how straight a bloke was, Blaise could talk just about everyone into just about everything. Thus – after a good two hours – nearly everyone had had a turn.
Harry harrumphed. “Oh yeah, sure, once I figure out how to flirt!”
The two of them were content to silently cuddle as they recovered from their glorious orgasms. Draco was holding Harry to him with his right arm, which he was laying on, and Harry absently ran his fingers up and down Draco's left arm. Suddenly, he noticed something that made him sit up rather abruptly.
Harry felt his anger deflate abruptly and sighed as he let Draco go. “Don't let haters who know nothing about you win.”
Draco rested his forehead against Harry's. “For as long as you'll have me.”
She pulled open one of his eyelids, then slid her hand inside his shirt to check his heartbeat. Finding a fairly rapid one, she very quietly asked directly in his ear: “Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?”
“Mostly?” Narcissa questioned with an elegantly shaped brow raised in disapproval.
Harry looked only slightly pacified by this. “Hmm... I suppose you have a point.”
Out of nowhere, Rowle was stunned and Draco was punched off his feet.
Harry shook his head, then flinched. “Well, not on purpose. You stole the drink in which someone was trying to slip ME something.”
It took a moment for Snape to think over how best to do this, and then grabbed the chair Harry had been sitting in so that he could use it to help himself get to his feet. The moment he stepped away from Harry, Harry rolled over and shakily got to his hands and knees. It took a few deep breaths to gather up the strength to stand, but by then, Hermione had come over to give him a hand. More than a hand as she used her body weight to haul him to his feet, and then slung one of his arms over her shoulders so that she could support his weight as they walked away. She even very kindly (and without a word) cast a spell to dry off and clean his trousers.
Those he set to float around the room at equal distances from each other. Lastly, he cast a spell on all of them that would also 'pipe' the music from his magi-laptop. Ready in a surprisingly short amount of time, Blaise took a few minutes to explain the concept to the curious crowd.
Sounds indicated that people were now fighting on the actual stairway, thus getting closer than ever.
Back in the Room, Draco already had all the things he needed to implement the plan. After all, he'd had almost all year to fine tune and refine it, and he'd been carrying the supplies with him so that he couldn't be caught off guard should things finally work out. Thus, once the Dark Lord had summoned everyone via his Marks (which Draco hissed as his burned unbearably for a few moments) and they had come through the cabinet, Draco was ready to lead them.
Unfortunately, Draco remembered that their OWLs were right around the corner, and that he really needed to study a bit more before bed. So, he slipped out of Harry, strangely reluctant to do so, despite having gone at least half soft already. Then he sat back on his knees and took a good look at Harry.
After a surprisingly glorious weekend in bed with Harry, Draco woke up on Monday morning to find a note on the pillow next to him.
Jackie thought the exhibition itself would be boring and all but begged them to avoid the tour they'd already signed up for. She'd attempted as much on numerous counts both throughout their trip and prior, to which Harry had stalwartly objected to.
"I'd rather you didn't see," he found himself saying, then almost winced at his own words. Swallowing a little painfully, Draco curled his hands into fists on his knees and continued nonetheless. "I'd rather you didn't see. You… you shouldn't see things like this."
"Why he would bother when he doesn't have any apparent artistic flair is a mystery to me."
"Would you stop talking?" the Hogwarts girl said.
Harry blinked. Once, then again. "What? Draco, how did you get -?"
Sirius squeezed his shoulders. Shook him. Asked of him. And then another voice interrupted, a voice Harry had heard briefly just as he'd landed heavily to the ground.
"Me what?"
Draco swallowed. He licked his lips. Readjusting his phone against his ear, he took a deep breath and began the trudging climb up the remaining steps. "It seems like a wonderful opportunity. If Madame Clementine wishes to discuss this further, then I would be honoured to arrange a call or meeting to..."
A sound escaped Harry's throat, strangled, but Bellatrix didn't seem to hear it. That or she didn't care. Bending over him, reaching for him, she grasped Harry's arm before he could scramble away from her. Despite her size, she managed to hold him down as though it were easy. The knife was so close to Harry's face that he almost quailed.
It was going to be a little awkward. Maybe more than a little. But Harry figured that he and every other student had to start somewhere, didn't they? If they were going to remedy the situation of the still-present but less pronounced ostracism of certain members of the student body, active steps would need to be taken. Besides, the eighth years had already started, hadn't they? What with the party of their first evening back, and – and –
"And you didn't tell me."
This time it was prestigious, wealthy superiority complexes. It wasn't really a surprise.
Harry stood before the bathroom mirror, attention trained upon his reflection and head tipped slightly forwards as his fingers plucked at his overlong fringe. He didn't seem to notice Draco's entrance, or at least didn't heed it, for he didn't pause in his meticulous ministrations, for which Draco was grateful. It allowed him a moment to stare without being caught.
Mostly, however, he wanted Harry to want him back. It wouldn't mean anything if he didn't have that.
"That's beautiful."
Draco frowned, momentarily drawn from his stupor, and glanced towards him. "What?"
Draco nodded.
Harry stared at Draco, then at Blaise who, before Harry could take it, retracted his extended hand into a gesture of placation instead. He wasn't quite sure what was going on, but he was clearly missing something.
"He always Apparates away in the middle of it when this happens. Sad to say it's not the first time we've been walked in on."
Malfoy grunted. "Then don't expect me to expect it. Idiot."
"Oh god," Harry said, squeezing his eyes closed.
"I don't know if she can say this on camera."
"They're being pretty persistent," Ginny said.
Harry laughed. It was as forced as Jackie and Jill's had been, but it felt good. Nice to be able to talk and think – if only mostly think – of something other than the past few days. Over a week, it had been. Harry almost couldn't believe it.
"Oh, because it's not indestructible or anything?" Jackie said, grinning.
"Malfoy," he blurted out.
"What, did you need me to hold your hand and show you the way?" she replied. "Hell, Harry, I didn't realise your eyesight were
Harry shrugged. He didn't care that nothing had become of Draco's threat. It didn't matter in the greater scheme of things because the important thing was that Draco had stepped in, had wanted to, had been about to, and Draco was his goddamned
It was all sleight of hand, of course. The appearance of the handkerchief, practiced so many times as a kid that Harry could draw it from a pocket or his sleeve so fluidly that none would notice. The knot tied with such extravagance and such intricacy that watchers wouldn't notice that it was hardly a knot at all, and the unravelling thus miraculous. The clap and the further flourish that 'disappeared' the handkerchief once more in such an affronting manner that the lobbed throw over the shoulder wasn't noticed.
"Magic has been an integral part of society for centuries," the tour guide said, a middle-aged man with long hair, a smoker's rasp, and a theatrical flair to the gestures accompanying his every words. He spoke as he led his dutifully silent guests down the entry corridor, walking backwards and gesticulating as he did. "Whether for entertainment, science, medicine, or even in contribution to wartime efforts, it has existed and been an integral part of many a generation."
Harry watched as he flicked through his spread of creams, eyeliners, and eyelash curlers. "How come?"
"You told me you weren't finishing up until tomorrow."
There was nothing in that room. Nothing but empty walls and empty floors. No blankets, no bed. Not even a chair. Sometimes what Harry supposed must be called a chamber pot appeared, but it didn't last long. He didn't know why it appeared, or when it would come and go, only to notice it on occasion and deduce its meaning.
"Which one do you want?" Jackie asked, dropping her pile of books before picking a pair at random and holding them up. Their covers were faded, the titles ornate in Old English calligraphy. "They both look enthralling."
"Oh no, of course not. You're only hoping to save the world one step at a time."
on the cover. "Virginia Woolf? Good choice."
, as it were, so I think it will be…"
Without another word, she swept away, past and behind the couch and out of sight. Head slightly tipped, Harry listened to the sound of her footsteps as she made her way up to the girls dormitory. His hand didn't slow in its gentle ministrations of Draco's hair. The comfortable silence left in Pansy's wake hadn't really been disturbed in the first place.
, Ron, so you – you shouldn't… You can't just make –"
He trailed off, but it didn't take much guesswork for Harry to join the dots. Oh. So Pansy had someone too. That was… unexpected. Or maybe it wasn't. Harry didn't know but didn't comment or ask further.
Harry was out, he was happy to be, and yet the fear that necessitated all but constantly looking over his shoulder remained. He spoke loudly and proudly at school with Jackie at his side and Jill at his shoulder, but it felt different. Was different. Was unutterably scary. What would people think? It shouldn't matter, and Harry didn't want it to – but what would they say? What would
Draco leant away from him. He was still smiling. His hand still rested on Harry's shoulder. And Harry couldn't move.
"You were given a handful of weeks, Harry. You don't have any need to contact the agency to let us know of your whereabouts. Or at least not for my peace of mind, though I do believe Von is distressed by your absence. He doesn't seem to know what to do with himself even though he is being torn between two alternative jobs at the moment."
"Mm."
Which wasn't as unusual in the industry Harry found himself as he considered it otherwise would be. Or should be. Everyone seemed to wear a mask of sorts – that for work, and that which was tucked sadly beneath.
"A salad isn't very substantial, Harry," Hermione said through a bite of bread.
"That I do," Pansy said, uncrossing her legs and rising fluidly to her feet. In her impractically high shoes, she was of a height with Draco himself when she clicked her way to his side. "This afternoon is our first meeting with the subject, in fact."
to god!”
would you like me to place the drops?”
“Draco...” Harry murmured softly, kissing the back of his neck. “I told you last night that I don't know what to think about ANY of this... I... All I can promise you is that I don't want to use you. I only have about 15 minutes each night when I get home before exhaustion overwhelms me and I pass out. And then on the weekends, I spend as much time with my friends and chosen family as possible. I don't know if I CAN date you... but... If you want to try it... If you want to take those 15 minutes I have each night and spend them kissing... If you want to hold me when I'm sleeping... I... I think I'd really like that...”
“So... you're single?” Harry asked with a strangely smooth face.
“Mr. Potter!” Narcissa greeted with as much joy as she'd use with her favorite long lost cousin.
Harry sighed and slumped a little in frustration. “So what am I supposed to do now?”
Now Ron looked skeptical. “And you liked even that?”
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, well, everyone else is having so much fun, so I decided that I want to give it a try.”
? I'm so scared that I'll never, get put back together, keep breaking me in, and this is how we will end, with you and me... bent.”
He stopped short in the classroom door and pulled his cloak off, panting heavily. Draco took one look at him and held out his arms. “What's wrong?”
At that point, Parvati INSISTED that she have a turn so she could drunkenly belt out
“It seems like you have time now...” Draco murmured suggestively.
“Fuck!” Harry swore in frustration. “I really gotta go!” He cried out as he pulled free from Draco's arms and fell out of bed. Not even getting to his feet, he summoned his clothes and yanked them on. “I'm really sorry! I TOLD you that I didn't have much time!”
Thus, Snape was getting frustrated by Harry's lack of progress and taunting him. “You're such a bloody moron, Potter! You can't even stop me from seeing your worst memories and giving me ammunition to use against you! You were doing better when I unwillingly tickled you!”
is that? Watching my boyfriend lick up this fit bloke has me ready for bed. NOW!”
When Harry came home from work, Draco had dinner on the table ready to eat. Harry looked shocked.
Ginny had been sad but admitted that the two of them just didn't feel right together. Hermione had immediately drawn up a chart of all possible romantic candidates and jotted down notes on how to chat them up effectively. Ron had suggested that they simply take Harry out to a club that specialized in that sort of thing.
Harry planned to go tell him off after breakfast – since Hermione rushed off to confirm an epiphany and Ron had to hurry to his History of Magic Exam – but he was surprised to find Mrs. Weasley and Bill waiting for him with the other Champions' families. All in all, Harry quickly forgot to be mad at Draco – which was good since Draco managed to ambush him in the bathroom once again – as Harry was making his way toward the Third Task.
To his disappointment, after about two minutes, rather than answers to his questions, all he got was an even bigger red octagon. Sighing, Draco decided to wait and try again tomorrow.
Ron snorted in amusement. “Well sure, but I mean, what specifically?”
Still...
“Ah,” Hermione murmured in understanding.
All in all, he was actually sort of happy when the hols came to an end and he was forced to leave the Room for a while. None of the books he had on Magical Furniture Repair were helping, and he had to wait for a few new ones he'd ordered to arrive anyway.
He didn't think the same tactic would work here.
He stood up and marched over to Draco, glaring at those who were currently offering him things. “What do you think you're doing?” He demanded of a man that looked intense and angry.
Draco really was half asleep, even so, he murmured: “I hate you Harry.”
At this point, Draco got to sing softly, almost like a lullaby. “There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface. Consuuuming, confuuusing. This lack of self-control I fear is never ending. Controoolling, I can't seeeem to find myself again, my walls are closing iiiiiinnnnn, I've felt this way before,
“Don't be absurd, luv. Why would I be avoiding you?”
Taking a breath, Harry continued. “You will be going into the Maze, which has been designed so that each house will start at a different corner, and ALL of you will have an equal chance of making it to the center of the Maze. You'll encounter all sorts of obstacles; some of which are magical creatures, some of which are puzzles or riddles, and some of which are challenges you won't realize are challenges unless you solve them.”
Potions with Slughorn – later that day after lunch – was fairly boring because Slughorn kept fawning all over Harry – and by extension, his friends. Miss Know It All was showing off again, and even telling their very Slytherin Professor that she was muggleborn (she means Mudblood, Draco said to Nott, both sniggering) managed to lose his interest. He was very quickly turning out to be a disgrace to Slytherin House!
Sure enough, the article was accompanied by a picture of Harry and Parvati looking at each other like they knew a happy secret which slowly changed to them kissing. The kiss started out chaste enough, but quickly grew heated until they were clinging to each other and giving it their all. For some reason, this picture turned red, which made Draco realize that the entire room had gone red.
Draco sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Look Potter, I'm not drunk enough to –”
But then all hell broke loose and everyone flooded back into the castle and so many reinforcements arrived. Even the house elves were fighting! But Draco noticed that strange things kept happening. Shield spells popped up out of nowhere to protect those fighting against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Draco was suddenly filled with a hope so profound that it felt like it stabbed him in the gut with a sword. He gasped and couldn't catch his breath because of it.
Albus hastily cast a Sonorus on himself to add. “That's alright daddy, we already ate!”
“By existing!” Harry exclaimed, emphasizing his point by tapping his pointer finger on the table emphatically.
bet you have, I know our letters were useless — but we couldn’t tell
Meanwhile, when Harry could drag his eyes off Draco for five or so seconds, he managed to glance over at Blaise and Pansy, who were
As the song grew closer to the chorus, it picked up in speed, and Harry was doing a beautiful job of singing it. “Shouldn't be so complicated, just hold me and then, well just hold me again! Can you help me I'm
Harry rolled his eyes and gave Draco a LOOK. “I already told you! I've been brooding over how to ask you to marry me! I couldn't smile because I was so afraid that you'd say no!”
Taking that as agreement, Harry pulled one of Draco's arms over his shoulder and helped him walk over to the bed – which was basically on the opposite side of the room. He twitched his fingers to wandlessly magic the covers aside, and then carefully sat Draco on the end of the bed so that he could magic the bloke's expensive shoes off. Harry probably would have left it at that, but Draco got an impatient look on his face, pulled out his wand, and magicked his suit jacket, waistcoat, and trousers off to the side, leaving him in his button down shirt, pants, and socks – complete with little calf suspenders to hold them up.
See, on the one hand, if it WAS Cedric and he KNEW that they could talk to each other via their arms, then why had he gone to the trouble of finding him and telling him IN PERSON about the egg? Also, since no one would know anyway, why wouldn't he just TELL him what the secret of the egg was?
Trying hard not to get his hopes up, Draco closed his eyes again and let Harry do whatever he wanted, which was surprisingly nothing more than kissing for the rest of the night. The passage of time and the alcohol eventually teamed up to put them to sleep, but it happened to be the best sleep Draco could ever remember having.
The first course was served and the first sips of the excellent wine were taken before Narcissa gave into the near glare her son was giving her. “Oh alright!” She turned to Harry and gave him a bright smile. “Harry, as we stated in our invitation, we invited you here tonight in order to settle our debts to you.”
Harry blushed, not able to BELIEVE that he was about to lick Ron all over in public. Ron was surprisingly mature, volunteering to go first.
Satisfied, Draco did his best to return to his mother before she noticed that he wasn't where he was supposed to be. Unfortunately, she was smart enough to see through his excuse and stared him down upon his return. “Where were you?”
Happy for an excuse to get away if even for only a few minutes, Draco did as he was told, despite his mother's indignant protests on his behalf. Out in the courtyard, he turned the men into small boulders. This would prevent them from escaping before Bella could dispatch them, but also had the advantage of if she forgot about them – which she was likely to do – he could turn them back and release them later.
It was agony to wait even the minute or so it took for a response!
Both elves looked at him and Draco tangled up naked on the bed with an expression like this was the worst thing that could have possibly happened. That said, both promised to follow orders – Dobby genuinely sounded happy to be of service, but Kreacher was as gloomy as ever, probably only agreeing without protest because it meant being of service to Draco.
Draco hadn't relished the idea of entering the Forbidden Forest without some guarantee of safety, but since they weren't too far in and it was unlikely that anything that lived in the forest would come this close to the castle, he looked around and decided that the place would work just fine. Especially if fixed up a bit. He transfigured the grass and leaves into a large plush cushion for them to lay on.
Harry groaned and enjoyed every moment until he realized that Draco was torturing him on purpose. “I said blow me, damnit!”
She continued, her voice terse and sharp yet thickened with concern more than anger. Sighing, closing his eyes once more, Harry tipped his head back against the wall behind him and endured her tirade. James might be the become loud and exuberant, dramatic and jovial, but Lily was the real terror when it came to overprotectiveness.
"What? That it's unnecessary?"
, he thought, tipping his chin to rest against the side of Harry's head. He closed his eyes, though he didn't think he could fall back to sleep even if he'd wanted to.
Draco only grunted, the sound felt as a vibration through his chest as much as heard. Harry stared up at him, eyeing his persistent frown. He had the sudden urge to wipe it away with a his thumb.
He trailed off, watching the ensuing performance, and was only aware that Draco wasn't doing the same when his knuckles brushed the back of Harry's hand. He started slightly but didn't pull away as Draco leant into him again to whisper into his ear. "I could show you, you know."
Harry's life was different – different to how it had once been, how he had imagined it would be, how the world expected it should be. It was different because he'd stepped into a role that none but Gertrude had seen him capable of and, rather than sinking, he'd somehow learnt to swim. It was different because with each shot, each captured picture, each advertisement that played on the Muggle television that he acted in, he edged further and further from the Wizarding world.
There was the one where Harry was sitting on the ground from his first shoot, his knees drawn up a little before him and the neck of his oversized shirt pulled to the side just enough to leave his collarbones exposed. Harry stared at the camera, and he looked so young that Draco was once more all but overwhelmed but a wave of nostalgia. That makeup artist, Von – he had a way with a brush. He'd worked wonders.
"I think it's probably looking like an acid-based substance, though I'd have to check with an indicator first. You can see around the edges. See?"
"I'm telling you how to study, yes."
"And? What of it? I do."
Harry hated that most of all. Anyone who could belittle Dot, could think less of her simply because she was a squib, wasn't worthy of any of their time. The derision towards squibs was an aspect of the Wizarding world that Harry had never and would never abide.
"Fixing you?"
Except it wasn't. It wasn't unbelievable and it wasn't impossible. Even as Draco shook his head, denying his own words, Harry knew that he was certain of his own interpretation. Harry's hands started to shake in their hold on the mirror.
Harry turned his frown upon him where he stood still hunched and very distinctly awkward in the back corner of the elevator, but he let it slide. He supposed it was all but expected for it to be Target Harry Day given the circumstances. Instead, he turned back to Ginny as the elevator pinged on a floor not their own. "You're weirdly vocal about my love life these days, has anyone ever told you that?"
PJ only grinned up at him, and Harry felt his smile widen further. His pace picked up a little and he found himself almost grinning as he continued the rest of the way home. It might be just a small victory, but in that triumph Harry saw the faces of every single person who had looked down on him.
tonight before I suggested it. Tell me I'm wrong."
Instead, he took a step backwards and sunk into the chair directly next to Draco's own. Just as reluctantly, Draco let him go, unhooking his hands from his waist and turning back to the table and breakfast. "I can't imagine today will be as long as they've been until now," he said, picking up his tea once more. "Blessedly."
Jill only shrugged. "Nothing much. It just looked like something was going on here, so I just thought you should know that Mr. Dawson's coming down in a second. I heard a couple of the fourth form kids running up to get him."
He loved quidditch but found the rush of adrenaline from flying to be even more captivating than he'd ever found the game to be.
Oh. That. Just that.
Harry didn't hear what else she said. Maybe she said nothing more anyway. Lurching forward, he all but flew across the room towards Draco, half aware that Draco stepped towards him in return but otherwise oblivious. He knew Draco wasn't dead. Even seeing the boggart, he'd known. Just as he'd known he couldn't have done anything else for anyone who had died, and that he hadn't been the one to kill the Death Eaters that appeared before him.
"I didn't tell either of them anything," Draco said. "They're just cluey enough to pick up on what is apparently blatantly apparent to anyone I spend time with."
"It's probably got very little to do with how I look or act, or who I am as a person. It's… I'm an idea, you know? Both as a model and as Harry Potter."
Ron huffed, stabbing at the remaining chunk of pie pastry on his plate. He glanced across the table at Draco as he'd been doing throughout the entirety of lunch and, with what seemed to Harry a Herculean effort, said, "You're so lucky you don't have brothers or sisters, Malfoy."
Why? Why did he do that? Why didn't he ever try to impose his own choice on the matter? Why did that part of him, the part that had always been so defiant and loud, so demanding in their school days, have to disappear when Draco had always secretly loved it? The challenge, the exchange of verbal warfare, the thrill of one-upping him – it had been a highlight of his adolescence that Draco hadn't realised was so important to him until it was gone.
Harry couldn't help but sink backwards a little into his seat. He abruptly wished that he weren't quite so far away from the crewmen. "Thank you?" he said warily.
Jackie had a little bit more of a time of it, but she'd said that the example Harry's parents had set had gone a long way in swaying her own. Harry was glad for that, at least; Jackie deserved to be happy, even if she kicked and fought every step of the way.
"Maybe you should drop by and meet him, then. You can come to the next shoot or something if you'd like. I'm sure I could ask Dot to pull some strings."
Which meant that Harry had to get himself out.
Draco didn't reply. Not for a long, long time. Harry's not-awkwardness, his not-embarrassment, quivered in teetering confusion for a moment before slowly dissipating, and he closed his eyes with its departure. The quietness of the room, Ron's incessant snores, a muffled whimper from the direction of Wayne Hopkins' bed, was lulling and soothing in its own way.
The clatter of cutlery and crockery met him as Harry poked his head from the mouth of the hallway. Sweeping a glance across the sunlit suite, he zeroed in on Draco seated at the table, the spread of room-service breakfast before him and the steam of tea tangling amidst that of pancakes, bacon, and eggs. As ever, the sight of that much food niggled at the part of Harry that clung to his diet with rigorous compulsion, but it was less demanding that day. Certainly when Draco paused with his teacup half raised to his mouth and smiled at him.
If Jackie was there, Harry could have kept his cool. He was the level-headed one of them both and he'd had more than enough practise. If Jill was there, he thought he could have too, because she was like the calm in the middle of the storm to shelter in. But alone? Alone, Harry had no hope.
Until Draco stopped it.
Sighing, resigning himself to the inevitable – for Sammy had a history of persistence when ignored – he opened his eyes and picked up his phone. Only to freeze when he caught sight of the name and number on the screen.
It was almost ironic how Jackie's annoyance served more to soothe Harry's guilt than exacerbate it. Somehow, being asked why they were "back already, you lovebirds?" and "I'd like to say I'm surprised, but… couldn't you have at least given us a heads up?" was less gruelling when Jackie's blatant annoyance contrasted so fiercely. By the time the pizzas arrived – steaming and nowhere near as greasy as Pizza Hut's, to Pansy's evident delight – Harry had returned to ignoring Jackie and Jackie to her glaring and seething mutters. He didn't even truly feel guilty anymore; it was hard to cling to in the face of such open acceptance from three-quarters of their group.
Silence fell. It stretched, continued to stretch, and Harry shifted awkwardly between his feet. His only placation was that Draco still clasped his hand as comfortably as before.
"- and I will not, ever, interfere with another student's attempts to do the same."
Harry cringed, shrinking into the corner of the room as he always did, but he couldn't hide from sight. He couldn't bring himself to look away from the madwoman raging before him either, wand in one hand and knife in the other. It felt as though, if he did, she would spin towards him with a curse and her blade spinning for his throat.
still for school, you know," he'd said, frowning as they'd climbed into the car that morning. "If you've got such a problem with it you don't have to come,"
"Maybe this is just a part of that specialness."
"I wasn't –? Jackie, we practically always meet outside the library. Why the hell would you go to the locker rooms?"
Harry cut himself off. Or he wished he'd cut himself off. It would have been less humiliating then to be silenced by Draco leaning towards him and slightly, gently, ever so briefly, pressing his lips against his own. Except that humiliation was barely more than a distant echo in Harry's head, bulldozed by the more immediate concern.
"A bad man?" Harry attempted a smile. "So a politician?"
"I don't think I could ever say it out loud to you," he said, his own words echoed back to him in the silent room, "but I do. I like you, Draco Malfoy. I think I actually do."
Draco lingered, and it was only because of his continued scanning that he noticed the pair of stumbling drunkards with their arms pretzeled around one another slipping from behind a heavy curtain, revealing a dimly lit hallway beyond. The curtain flopped closed again, seeping into camouflage against the dark wall alongside it, but not before Draco was striding across the club towards it, all but shoving clubbers out of his way as he did.
"Merlin, Harry, if you keep staring at me like that then I'll think the bastards made an even worse mess of me face than it feels like." He smiled slightly, a little smirk, and only the slightest wince suggested it hurt to do so.
There was no need for the tokenistic 'to study' anymore. A meeting at the library would more often than not lead to a wander around town, likely stopping off at the community gardens – a good spot to practice magic for the surplus of private and shaded corners, even in the chill of winter – then to grab a snack, have a tea, or have Harry call Lily to let her know he'd be out for dinner. Sometimes they visited the shopping centre. A couple of times the local arcade, which would never cease to be hilarious when Draco was involved. He was no less competitive than Harry was.
Of that, Draco had no doubt. He'd been the subject of Pansy's 'persuasiveness' many a time through their shared history. What she couldn't coax forth with a smile and a silver-tongued request she acquired through sheer intimidation. Draco could almost pity her victims sometimes.
"She's not allowed to," Harry said.
welled within him. But it was less of a struggle than it had been only a week before to shove the thought aside. Almost easy to focus more on the warmth of Draco's fingers, his gaze, and the tight, clenching feeling in Harry's gut that he'd always gotten with Draco but seemed all the more significant these days.
"That's… impossible," Jill murmured, still unmoving.
Hermione sighed, though she too didn't appear particularly disappointed. "I should know better than to bet against you when it comes to Harry," she said, propping an elbow on the back of the couch and raising an eyebrow at Ginny. "You do know him best."
"Lump Crabbe and Goyle together, because I'm not abiding their company," said the dirty-haired kid.
"Are you really…?"
"And you're not worried at all about having to actually talk to them again in," Von glanced at his watch, "less than half an hour?"
"Just because you don't need me to doesn't mean I have to stop. Shut up and eat your croissant."
"It's no secret that this job will put you in the limelight. In the favourable limelight, if also an eventuality rather than an immediate reward. Your name will be attached to Parkinson's articles, to say nothing of your photographs, and every single person in the Wizarding world will see them. I can assure you of that much."
A/N: Thank you so, so much to everyone who commented last chapter. I can't even say how lovely and supportive I found it. Each and every single message made my day, so I can't thank you enough.
"Gross is cool," Jackie said, twisting the book back towards herself. She leered down at the picture on the double spread. "That's awesome."
"Well… I guess it all started when I was eleven…"
"Yes, and I thank every day that I have you to be that one." Turning towards Harry and entirely ignoring where James had descended into a tussle with Sirius reminiscent of the schoolboys that Harry had never been, Lily slipped back into solemnity. "It's not so much your schooling that concerns me, Harry. I have faith that you'll keep up to speed."
With that, he produced as if from thin air a sheaf of cards and spread them in a perfect array before him to the smiling and murmuring delight of the crowd. Descending into further theatrics, fingers sweeping and wriggling, he played his audience like a fiddler with his fiddle.
have, defended if he'd been more than a face in a magazine, he couldn't help but feel guilty for his choices.
"Sure. Sometimes it's not study at all, am I right?"
Many thought Dot was a hard woman, and they would be right. Many thought she was career driven, merciless, and rigorous in her approach to life and her expectations of others. They were right too. Dot was hard, and demanding, and generally unapproachable even to those who knew her best. She had been an agent of
"No. I forgot."
He saw Ipetsky first. The tall man was prominent where he stood at the bar, white shirt stretched across his shoulders and spiked hair as stupid as ever. He fit seamlessly into the scene alongside with other attendee of the club in his casual yet fitted clothes that would likely draw the eye of anyone who looked if he wanted them to.
"Having a couple of bodyguards always helps," Blaise added. At Jackie's frown, he jerked a thumb towards Vince and Greg. "Crabbe and Goyle here are our bona fide escort. Isn't that right, fellas?"
"Know what?" Harry asked. The words sounded almost like a plea to his ears. The residue of anger and distress and adrenaline was a sodden mush sitting heavily in his gut. He just wanted to go home, or go and complain to Jackie, or seek Jill and her gentle commiseration that could always soothe emotional wounds despite her inevitable forgiveness of Jacob and his fellow terrorists.
Or he would have been surprised. Tea was very far from his mind at that moment, and Harry had disregarded his own, dropping his hands into his lap. His shoulders curled, hitching further and further with every word Draco uttered. It wasn't because he was sad for the accusations, or that Draco was making them. It was because they were true.
"A shame just for me?" Harry asked. "I wasn't aware you'd been to Lucerne before."
More importantly, would he realise that Harry could cast actual magic in a way that Draco apparently had before Harry had even realised it?
Not that it lasted long. In a fluid movement, Harry looped a leg over him to straddle his hips. He settled himself comfortably – a little too comfortably in Draco's opinion – and he must have known what such the sight of him, what his weight and the brief canting of his hips, was doing to Draco even before Draco uttered a groan through slightly trembling lips. His smile was knowing as he leant towards Draco and bestowed a chaste but lingering kiss upon him. Then he pushed himself upright and started rocking his hips against, and there was little else Draco could do but grasp his thighs in an effort not to buck against him.
"That's the problem," Draco snapped.
"Yeah, well, I couldn't just ask you straight off the bat. But she didn't know, and she said it wasn't any of my business, even though I reckon I made her curious. But Ginny – you know Ginny actually asked me about it, too."
"What did I just say to you about that name?"
Draco couldn't speak. He wasn't sure he would ever be able to speak before Harry again. Seeing him like this… He knew it wasn't his fault – or at least not that he'd been beaten to a pulp and bloodied mess, even if the reason behind it was justified – but a rising tide of shame and embarrassment welled within him.
Harry chuckled as his friends broke into simultaneous contributions of "I feel like chips," and "something filling but not too heavy". "Okay, okay. I've got it." Waving at them vaguely, he led the way into the hallway with their chatter following after him. Only to pause in step with a peripheral glance in the direction of the conjoined room.
"Good. Then go and have fun with your friends."
Harry stared at Ron as he lowered his gaze back to his hands. His crooked smile had a slightly mischievous edge to it that mirrored the way he played distractedly with his long fingers. When he glanced up at Harry, it became a grin. "Sounds stupid, right?"
It was different because he had an agent who wasn't just a manager but a squib, a menace in the modelling industry, a businesswoman of her own right, and the hand that effectively held Harry's assumed reins.
Seamus Finnegan walked alongside Dean. He was smiling in spite of the sobriety of the feast that evening, nothing if not the picture of confidence and enthusiasm despite that Harry knew his parents had all but demanded he forgo school that year.
curious of your magic. Especially curious, in fact, and not prejudiced, as you similarly seem to misguidedly believe. If anything, your disappearing handkerchief last week has only made me all the more so."
James stumbled into the room, collapsing to his knees before Lily and scrambling to her side. His hands shook as one reached towards Harry, towards his pale face and chubby cheeks, his closed eyes too still to be
It was a question – or the opposite of the question – that he'd taken to asking every night of late. The kind of question accompanied by a quivering smirk and a sideway glance as a quietly smiling Lily. It wasn't even as embarrassing as it used to be – though still managed to be just a little bit for the fact that it was Harry's parents who asked.
Harry loved them just as they were. He loved their differences and loved that they were all friends regardless. But what he loved most was that they all just seemed to
"The Lord will return," Bellatrix had said, though not to Harry. As she'd paced, muttering under her breath, it sounding almost like she were chanting a mantra. "He will return. I will bring him back. But why won't it work? It should work, so why? Why, why, why…"
Harry was fine with that. More than fine, because it meant that Draco was all but forced to work with him. Even better was that Draco was a good worker.
"I think it's cute," Blaise said with a wink in Harry's direction. He laughed as Pansy elbowed him.
Dropping his chin onto Draco's shoulder, because he knew that Draco not so secretly liked the contact, he scooted into his side slightly. "Guess it's a good thing I'm not Muggle, then," he said.
"Now?" Harry glanced back at the performance, at his friends. "What about -?"
Draco's lips quirked, and he didn't look at Harry when he murmured a brief, "Thank you."
So he did. And, though the museum had been interesting in its own way, Diagon Alley was infinitely better.
"I can drive for a bit on the way back tomorrow if you'd like, Harry," Jill offered when he finally dodged around a dawdling couple to fall into place at their side. "I haven't had much practice, but even so, if it's that much of a trial –"
Or it would have been interesting if he'd been able to actually read the textbooks he and Jackie had borrowed from the city library earlier that week. Even better if his partners helped him in his studies.
The quotation marks with his fingers that Ron made only added to the stupidity of the situation. Harry hadn't a hope of withholding the flush that flooded his cheeks, heightening further as Ron returned to his grinning.
"I like her eyes, even if I think the eyeliner's a little heavy."
"No, no, it's not that," the plump woman said, and a glance showed her waving a dismissive hand at her fellow. "You can always tell the pining ones. They sigh a lot."
heard but not spoken.
"I guess…" Harry trailed off. He licked his lips, took a breath that hitched, and managed to raise his gaze to meet Draco's. It was hard, but somehow utterly necessary when he noticed Draco staring back at him as though he were the only person in the room. "Why did you ask me to come with you? Yesterday, when you were leaving – why did you ask me?"
"Of a sort," Harry murmured detachedly, frowning slightly in the mirror.
"I think it's possible," Harry said, as though they all weren't stalwartly pretending to be speaking of anyone but him. He didn't want to have this discussion, or any discussion of a similar grain, but he needed to. He needed to know if those little things, those little bits and pieces that he'd never noticed before, that might not have been there before, arose because Voldemort had killed him or whether they'd always been there. Was it possible to have parts about himself that he hadn't realised? More than that, could there have been parts that were hidden, tucked away without his knowledge, because of – what? Because of priorities?
Harry felt as Draco flipped the duvet back from Harry's bed. He felt when he slipped beneath the sheets, the springs of the mattress protesting slightly and the weight of him impressed at Harry's side. He flinched just a little as one of Draco's legs brushed against his own. Flinched, then shivered as a tremor tingled across every surface of his skin.
and for
Agency – that he was in the hands of a pair of insignificant nobodies like Draco and Pansy was a veritable offence to their delicate sensibilities.
"Yes, and they're the ones who abuse the use of Photoshop until the image barely even resembles the original anymore." Draco rolled his eyes, shaking his head. "Utter idiots. As if they believe that people can't tell."
Tipping his head back against the wall, Draco closed his eyes once more. His calm aloofness, his relaxed demeanour, was reinstated, but Harry thought it looked a little different now. A little less fool-proof. Almost without realising it, he found himself smiling just a little.
"Maybe I will." Pansy paused for a moment. Then she cleared her throat, and in a surprisingly tight voice continued. "Take care, Draco. It really is better to stay away at the moment."
Harry didn't take the comment to heart. Jackie oftentimes said such things. They didn't have any real weight behind them, and Harry had long ago been learned to see the jest behind her glare. Jackie loved him; he'd never really doubted that. It helped when the rest of the school at large couldn't stand the sight of him.
"I think that's a little extreme, don't you?" Hermione said, wriggling into her seat until Harry withdrew his feet just slightly. "You're allowed out, aren't you?"
"Really?" Draco asked, once more not looking towards Von. His eyebrow arched as he stared at Harry, but he didn't continue.
The world was surely turned on its head. Draco Malfoy saying thank you? From what little Harry knew of him, he was sure that gratitude wasn't something Draco offered freely. Maybe Draco really was crazy. Had Jacob or one of his friends gotten him over the head before they'd chased after Harry? That would explain a lot.
Draco shook his head in confusion, the strangest look crossing his face. “I... don't... remember that...”
“Yes!” Draco snarled.
“Yeah alright,” he agreed wearily, gesturing for Terry to bring the cauldron over.
Draco had to think this over. He wasn't particularly interested in doing his prefect duties this year, and so, hadn't been patrolling as often as he was supposed to. This was probably why Harry hadn't ambushed him one night to pay him back for the broken nose. No, all his spare time was taken up trying to fix that Vanishing Cabinet.
Ron was surprised to hear his name hissed at him urgently as he passed a dark alcove on his way to dinner. In his single-minded determination to get to the Gryffindor table as soon as possible, he nearly ignored the urgent beckoning, but sheer curiosity stopped him in his tracks.
All too soon, he was back at Bella's side. Suddenly, the chandelier came crashing down on them and Draco felt justified in protecting himself rather than try to prevent Harry from escaping. It was sheer chaos with Harry grabbing the three wands (including Draco's) out of his hands, his mother trying to pull him to some semblance of safety, their old house elf Dobby disarming his mother, Harry shouting for his weasel to take Granger and go, and then...
Harry and Ron scrutinized a picture she held up. It was of a man they'd never seen before. He had rather plain brown hair and dark eyes, and more than likely wouldn't be noticed if he was standing next to a person, he was that unremarkable.
They exchanged a concerned look. Narcissa bit her lip in thought, then nudged her husband. Lucius nodded in understanding and braced himself.
Unfortunately, neither of them could ever actually say that out loud. And then Harry was gone. Draco stood there, numb and not even caring that he was bleeding from the shards of crystal that had cut him up. Humming very very softly in sympathy, Narcissa rubbed his back while no one was looking. And then...
When Draco returned to his friends, after snogging half The Club – or so it seemed to Harry – and accepting damn near an entire smaller bottle of Lust Potion by licking drops off those that begged him to, he stared at Harry with an expression that clearly wondered who in the bloody hell he thought he was that he could sit in Draco's chair. This was so familiar to Harry that he nearly blurted out a snarky challenge to a verbal duel. But then he remembered – yet again – that he was in the middle of a mission.
Beyond desperate, and now laughing so hard that he was coughing – a sort of hack up his lungs cough – Harry took a deep breath and shouted “EXPELLIARMUS!!!”
Deciding that since Ron had been honest with him – despite be clearly reluctant to do so – he'd be a terrible friend if he lied or deflected now. So, Harry held up his hand and showed Ron the writing. “She had me writing lines with a quill that used my own blood for ink.”
Draco stood up and slammed a hand on the table. “You mean to say that Slytherin is the ONLY House that doesn't give its Prefects such a big tactical advantage!”
you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, oh, we’ve got
“Don't feel bad, I think Auror Ginger forgot to transfigure half my outfit,” Harry consoled, pointing out the fact that his tee shirt was so 'artistically' torn that it barely covered his chest, and also, his trousers were so tight he wasn't certain he'd be able to zip them up!
Draco immediately looked contrite, even wincing sheepishly as he turned to Amanda – who he had almost forgotten about in his fervor to best Harry. “So sorry, luv! I didn't intend to make you feel badly.”
be Veritaserum since I can't seem to stop telling the truth!” Draco was sounding a bit frantic now. He leaned back a little as if trying to pull free from Harry's grasp, but not very strenuously.
“Mate, you're on fire,” Ron informed him as he hastily patted the smoke emanating from Harry's 'artistic' shirt.
This time, Harry gasped softly into Draco's mouth when he reached climax. Draco moaned, swallowing Harry's gasp and kissing through his own. Happy and utterly relaxed, neither really wanted to move. However, they both knew that they'd easily fall asleep if they stayed curled up, and so, they got up and pulled their clothes on just enough to not break any school rules on their way back to their beds.
Harry was gobsmacked again. He had
After that, neither of them wrote again for a long time. The next time words appeared – after Easter break and nearing the end of the year – Harry felt a chill down to his bone.
After a moment, Dumbledore smiled. “Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.
With surprising gentleness, Snape scooped Draco into his arms and carefully carried him through the entrance door. The entrance must either recognize nonverbal passwords, or else the Head of House never needed to use one, since Snape had said nothing. Harry was disappointed because he was hoping to use the password to sneak in later on to check on (or perhaps spy on) Draco as necessary. Sighing in relief that Draco was being taken care of, Harry jogged back to Slughorn's party just long enough to find out that Hermione had already left.
Luna Lovegood – of all people – somehow persuaded Blaise to let her go next. Nearly everyone looked to be bracing themselves for a rather painful experience, but she turned out to be surprisingly good as she sang a song called
Draco stared at the bird in shock. It was alive! It had gone through to Borgin and Burkes and returned... ALIVE!!!
“It's a bit like a catalyst that will trigger a 'curse' so that once we slip this in their drinks and they drink it, they will be 'cursed' to speak in lyrics – HONEST lyrics – until they get everything out in the open and feel better.”
Not wanting to hurt his beloved – even though he'd lied about it to Harry's face – Draco scrunched up his face and threw himself into a course of action that would seal his fate one way or the other. “Cruci–”
Draco decided to look up at the ceiling on the off chance that more truths he'd quite like to avoid telling came out. “I look inside myself and see my heart is black, I see my red door I must have it painted black, Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts, it's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black – Only when I start to think about it, I HATE everything about you, why do I love you?”
Only a shouted: “IMPEDIMENTA!” forced them to stop.
“Morning,” Harry returned. “Hungry?”
Rather abruptly – and completely unexpectedly – the lift stopped between floors. Obviously, its doors did not open, and so, they were trapped. Draco just barely suppressed a growl of frustration.
him into the bed. This proved to be exactly what Draco needed as he arched his back and got tighter. When his orgasm hit, those magical little flutters made Harry groan rather gutturally and pump him full. The two collapsed into a heaving pile and swiftly passed out.
“Er...” Harry droned, not entirely sure whether he should be offended or... nodding in agreement... Unable to decide, he focused on eating his pastrami and muenster on rye.
BLOODY DATING!!!” Draco denied vehemently.
When they were getting ready to leave the train, Greg pulled down his trunk to get his robes, and Draco thought he heard a gasp of pain from the rack. It seemed Harry really did sneak into their compartment. When everyone else was leaving, he told Pansy (who was trying to wait for him) to leave too because he needed to check something. Then he shut the curtain on the door window and made a show of looking through his trunk.
e in trouble and need to marry with all due haste because of it?”
Draco was a bit torn between being relieved that he hadn't been sent out to lead a rampage on more or less innocent people, and being upset that he was being kept rather close to the Dark Lord's side. That said, it seemed as if Voldemort had taken a bit of a liking to him, personally teaching him things and expecting him to perform the duties of his right hand man. For example, when Dolohov and Rowle returned to report that they'd had Harry Potter and his two friends practically in their grasp, only to be defeated leading to their escape. Draco was responsible for performing the Cruciatus Curse on them to the Dark Lord's satisfaction.
It was now Harry who looked rather thin and malnourished. In fact, dye his hair white-blond and give him a few extra inches of height, and he could be Draco from a year ago. Unbearably urged to comfort his Soulmate, Draco had to push away all tenderness and try to remain as emotionless as possible.
“Oh...?” Ernie questioned, more interested than he thought he'd be.
Ron snorted in amusement. “You mean HERMIONE learnt! The two of us were as lost as ever and she basically did all of the work herself.”
To which Draco replied: Fuck off!
After a while, Harry relaxed enough to chat a few blokes up and dance with them, but he never felt comfortable with the idea of simply shagging a stranger. So he left the club that night still wondering what it would be like.
Thankfully, this seemed to cancel the spell on Harry preventing him from leaving. Sighing in relief and not sorry in the slightest, Harry spun around and ran off at top speed. He did not slow down for any reason and ran straight to his dorm, to the communal shower, where he could strip off his vomit spattered clothes and clean up.
As he was emotionally coming to a better understanding of his feelings for Ginny – that as much as he felt a sort of love for her, he seemed to really want her as a symbol of everything normal in life he was missing out on – well, the more he grew confused.
Draco pulled back the millimeter or two he'd pushed forward. “Problem?”
Everyone else looked astonished bordering on downright gobsmacked. Ron and Hermione were even gaping at him. Suddenly, Terry burst out with: “Bloody hell! If I'd known that
Nodding, Draco released the bully into their custody. At this point, the bully had spotted his mistake and was babbling a plea to be given a second chance. Ignoring him, Draco resumed his quest.
Draco smirked. “Actually Potter, the last time I saw that necklace, it was on display in Borgin and Burkes. I swear on my father's life that I did not give it to Katie... Bell? The Seventh Year Gryffindor Chaser?”
Snape looked rather disgusted, but he did not let up. In fact, his tickling got a bit more intense – if that was possible. Harry's intense concentration of a moment ago vanished, and his screams got louder than ever.
The Tickling Curse
“Exactly!” Harry exclaimed happily, shifting to reward Draco with a kiss.
As Theo sang, a man – THE man – emerged from a back room holding up a large bottle of potion for everyone to see. He poured some into six smaller bottles so that six gorgeous women could walk around The Club and sell drops to anyone that wanted some.
Blaise gripped the microphone as he waited for the music to reach the right beat. Part of his magi-laptop karaoke program was a spell to project the lyrics at the perfect spot for the singer to see them if needed. Bouncing just a little bit, Blaise sang a song called
But rather than warm up in the slightest, Slughorn simply moved on, murmuring: “Yes. I was sorry to hear that he died, although of course it wasn't unexpected. Dragon pox at his age...”
Blaise handed over a few extra Galleons. “Put a good dozen drops on there so that I have an excuse to take my time.”
Harry looked up slightly to see her holding out a comb in her left hand even as the scissors in her right hand were open and ready to cut. He reached up and grabbed the comb, holding it up like she ordered. About two minutes later, something caught his eye, making him stare as words formed on his arm. Despite pausing for a moment to move which strands were being cut, his Aunt said and did nothing to indicate that she saw them.
Draco felt all the blood drain from his body into the floor under him. “What?” He was so stunned that he couldn't think for a good two or three seconds. Then his brain processed the question, but it still didn't make sense. “But... I don't understand...”
After hinting to Bellatrix that she'd have a chance and a requirement to kill her niece and husband if possible to prove her loyalty, Bellatrix practically sighed with relief and promised that it would be done as soon as possible.
“Mah?” Harry asked in amusement.
Ron was practically dying from curiosity now. “What did you like about it?”
Harry suddenly felt sick! It didn't help at all that Draco loudly told all his friends that Hagrid would probably be sacked even if he did turn up. And then LAUGHED at both Harry and Hagrid until Harry managed to grab his blood stained picture (the Bowtruckle he'd been holding while drawing it had scratched him nastily and run off), and escape in the direction of his next class with Ron and Hermione.
would I do that?”
The dummy purred in sympathy. “That's beautiful, luv.”
Narcissa laughed and kissed her adorable son. “Well, what if her parents don't want her writing on herself? At your age, they probably won't believe her if she says she didn't do it. And you wouldn't want her to get in trouble, would you?”
Pearl scoffed. “My mum wouldn't let him murder me, so I'm safe.”
“If you want your chair back, you're going to have to buy me a few drops of Lust,” Harry stated, unable to stop himself from challenging Draco after all.
Harry did not need telling twice. He grabbed Draco's hand and dragged him out to find a bit of privacy. Thankfully, Crabbe and Goyle were already sent off by McGonagall to bring her stuff to her office. Thus, when they reached the Forbidden Forest, Harry only looked around enough to make sure that no one else was looked ready to follow them. Despite being watched curiously, no one dared come close enough to the Forbidden Forest to see what they were up to.
Humming happily, Harry shifted to comply. Hours passed as Harry pounded Draco into the bed, changing positions every time he felt close to finishing. Eventually, Draco wrapped his legs around Harry's waist and
