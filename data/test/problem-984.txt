“Harry, mate you’ve never in your entire life cared about your outfit. What’s going on?” Ron sounded curious and Harry knew that there’s no way out of this conversation.
He heard as Draco started to laugh again, Harry was sure that he knew exactly what he was thinking. “You could show some support.” Unfortunately, this comment only made the blond laugh louder, and Harry noticed that Andromeda joined him. “Traitors all of you.”
“Are you sure you want to be seen with me holding hands?” He asked once they were safely inside the carriage.
“Now I believe we have some things to discuss before you attend Hogwarts again. Firstly, when it comes to your accommodation, there is a new tower for the 8th year. Your rooms will be double and your roommate is already selected, there is also no possibility of changing your room or your roommate, understood?” McGonagall paused as a low disapproving murmur could be heard. When his classmates finally stopped the new headmistress begun again. “Additionally there is a separated table for you in the great hall. Secondly, I will not tolerate bullying, hexing or abuse of any kind. It doesn’t matter if the attacked person wasn’t fighting during the battle or was fighting on the wrong side. I don’t care what you think about the trials and the punishments, everyone is welcome in Hogwarts. This school is not only a source of hope, but it is also a home for the lost and the ones that need it. I will not allow for bullying of any kind. Of course, other students will also be informed of this. And finally, if you ever need help, no matter who you are and how unworthy you think you are, believe me, help will be given to these who ask." Draco looked at her and found McGonagall's eyes already locked on him. He wanted to show her that he understood, but all he could do was stare. Finally, he gave her a small nod and the headmistress continued. "Now I believe that there is a feast waiting for you and of course a speech needs to be given. Your carriages are outside the station. Welcome home.” With that, she spun around and disappeared.
“No problem Harry, oh and before I forget Hermione and I are going to have a date night tonight, I’m taking her to this restaurant that you showed me, so don’t wait up” Harry could see Ron’s cheeks reddening and smile.
He wondered whether he should trust her. She told him that she was on his side, that she will help him, but was she telling the truth, could he really put this on another person. For a moment he was tempted to do just that and let her help, but then he remembered Lucius telling him that if he asks for help once more he will be punished. “Thank you for the recommendation, I’m sure it will help, but now I really should go to class.”
Waking up again Draco noticed that he was still tightly held by Harry, but this time the raven-haired boy was awake and looking at him a dopey smile. “Hello.”
“That’s awesome. We can spend holidays together. I’m pretty sure that Molly invited Andy to a dinner at the Burrow, so by extension you are also invited. That was actually the thing I wanted to ask, but now I don’t even have to persuade you since Andy will make sure that you attend.” Harry’s smile was huge and just looking at it made Draco’s insides twist pleasantly.
“Harry you don’t have to thank us. It’s an honour that you agreed. Who else would we even ask?” Hermione continued as she hugged Harry.
Slowly he unpacked his bag looking for the potion book not noticing that Draco expectant gaze. Upon taking out most of his possessions Harry discovered a loose piece of paper that was put between the transfiguration and DADA textbooks. Still not looking up he quickly took the loose page from his bag. When he looked at it he couldn’t take his eyes away from it.
“Do you think that I have a future in Quidditch?” Draco was taken aback by the question, it was unusual for Harper to doubt themselves, but he understood that Quidditch was essential for the two. He smiled and enveloped the child into a hug.
Draco was silent for a long time, then when Harry thought that the Slytherin won’t answer, he heard Draco’s voice. It was soft as if all fight left him. “I miss Pansy and Blaise. I mean sure we still owl, but it’s not the same. I miss her jabs and the way she always made sure that we matched. And I miss the way Blaise let me rant even when he was tired of my bullshit and I miss our little prank war every April Fool’s day.”
He was afraid of what the person is going to say about the fact that he no longer lives at the manor, what are they going to do when they find out that he is friends with Harry. Will they think that he somehow Imperio him or used some kind of potion? Will he be sent to Azkaban?
“Yes, Mr Potter, I’m afraid that you must.” Her tone didn’t betray anything and he started to worry.
“Thank you Rosmerta, do you think it will be safe for us to sit out there?” Even though he was relieved that Rosmerta was letting them stay he was still worried about the other patrons.
He didn’t expect to be attacked on his way to the first lesson, since Harry wasn’t taking Advance Arithmancy, but this only showed that today he couldn’t let his gourd down. Right now not only were his robes pink but so was his hair. He knew that he shouldn’t have opened the paper crane, but it just felt so nostalgic. This time The-Boy-Who-Lived gone too far, Draco looked as Umbridge,
Harry notices that Malfoy slightly flinches and moves away. Andromeda holds her hand in place and after a while, the boy slowly brings his cheek to her hand. He notices that Andromeda frowns.
He could help the hopefulness that came over him Potter was going to back to Hogwarts, maybe they weren’t the best of friends or even the worse of friends but this could mean that he won’t be so alone.
“Maybe it needs to be a combination of two potions.” The suggestion was vague, and he was aware that he could help more, but he knew that Pandora wanted to develop the potion on her own. She only sought his help when she needed to test it or when she wasn't able to find anything useful in books.
Now lying in bed next to his boyfriend Draco smiled and turned towards Harry, successfully burring his face in the crook of his shoulder. Draco held his breath as the Gryffindor pulled him closer and laying a protective hand around Draco’s waist. Slowly he exhaled and smiled feeling the warmth radiating from the boy, soon he was asleep once again.
so I forgot to update because of two reasons. Firstly, I'm working normal hours so I currently have less time and secondly I started to read this amazing fic, I highly recommend it. Here is a link to it https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417/chapters/27167826 the fic is titled survival is a talent and it's written by ShanaStoryteller. The story is beautiful and I love it also it's not finished yet so I don't know how much it's going to hurt. I highly recommend this work <3
“If you want me to make a list of things I wasn’t allowed it would be way too long and I think it would take a lifetime to complete.” His tone was even but Harry could hear the bitterness.
When his brain decided to work properly again he could see Andromeda smirking at him. She was right Draco really was oblivious, the boy only put Teddy to bed and moved to stand next to Harry.
Unfortunately, Slughorn was still as frustrating as before the war, but at least he stopped with all the parties. The professor became distant to every student that came from Slytherin making it almost impossible to ask for his help if someone wanted to experiment or simply clarify something that was said during the lesson. Most of the Slytherins from lower years begun to ask Draco potion related questions which was nice because he could revise his knowledge, but this also made him worried about the future of the subject. He knew that Snape was favouring his house, but at least the people that wanted to learn something more about potions and weren’t terrified of the guy could always come to him. At first, Draco thought that his opinion about Slughorn was biased since Snape was his godfather, but when even Hermione started to complain about the lack of preparation for N.E.W.T.s he knew that Slughorn was the problem for the education of all the houses with Slytherin at the front of the line.
“I’m not a monster. I made some bad choices because I wanted to protect people who didn’t deserve it. Yes, I stupidly thought that once the war would end they would stop being shitty parents and finally change, but I’m not a monster.” He felt tears falling down his face.
“I’m sorry. It’s not that I don’t want to, I just, I can’t face him. I can’t see Granger knowing that my aunt tortured her. I can’t see Weasley without hearing his screams. I can’t see them without wishing I was dead. Not now, not yet.” He hoped that Harry could understand. The expression on the boy’s face was unreadable and Draco hated not knowing what will come next.
After placing the last rose petal on the floor, a knock sounded on the door and Draco quickly turned around and opened the door.
“Remember how yesterday you told me not to stay up too late when I was going out with Ron.” Draco furrowed his eyebrows as he recollected that, but he also clearly remembered that Harry did get home at a reasonable time.
“Attention students. I know what day is today, but no pranking will be allowed from this point till lesson.” Draco knew that he didn’t imagine the way McGonagall's stare lingered on him. He smiled at the witch and placed his wand next to his hands.
Once again Hermione looked at the boy sitting next to Harry. His eyes were glazed over, he was looking at something that didn’t exist. Draco had dark circles under his eyes and although they weren’t very prominent they were still there, his hair was dissolved as if he didn’t care about the way he looks anymore, but he was still dressed smartly. She could see why Harry developed a crush on the boy. He definitely wasn’t her type, but she could see how other people could find him attractive.
A moment later a small group of Slytherins walked past them and Harry noticed that Draco’s lips curved downwards for a fraction of a second then as quick as the change happen they were back to Draco’s perfectly mastered neutral expression.
“I’m good. Are you coming with us, Harry?” Draco looked back and noticed that Harry stood awkwardly behind him.
The Great Hall was still silent when he leaned and kiss the boy. Together they made their way back to their dorm, Harry covered in feathers and Draco in his hideous pink clothes both smiling.
He couldn’t stop himself Draco was talking about healing and potions and he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the blond. He didn’t know how but suddenly he found himself right in front of Draco, the boy didn’t seem to notice their closeness still absorbed in his explanation. Harry couldn’t stop looking at the blond, at the way he moved his arms when he was exited, at the smile that brightened up his whole face. He needed to do something about the feelings that threaten to rip him apart, so he kissed him.
Harry barely made it on time to the welcoming feast. He smiled when he noticed Teddy in the crowd of 1st-years. He watched as Minerva read the list of students pausing slightly at Teddy’s name.
“And - ” He paused Andromeda couldn’t get him, she had to take care of Teddy. The only other person that could get him was. “Harry can get me, Harry Potter.”
He didn’t know how long he was starring when suddenly Draco’s voice brought him back to reality. “Are you alright, Harry?”
For a moment Draco looked nervous. “I always wanted to do something with potions, but I don’t think that being a potion master is for me, so I want to become a healer specialised in potions and potion damages. This way I can not only help people but also make up for the wrong in my past.”
Draco looked at Molly for a long time, then did the only thing he could, gave Molly his baby cousin and quickly made his way towards the kitchen.
year. His father went to prison and he was punished for this. He got an ultimatum either he will serve the Dark Lord in his father name or Voldemort will torture and kill him and his family.
Before he could say anything Draco spoke. “Thank you, professor, for all your help.” Harry noticed that Draco purposefully didn’t address the officials, who started to redden on their cheeks a little.
“Okay, you already woke me. Let’s dress you and then back to bed for me.” He looked at Ron and felt a smile creep on his face.
She could see that he wasn’t with them at least not entirely. She saw as he ran up the stairs and heard the door of the bathroom close. She exchanged a glance with Harry.
He couldn’t focus on Harry’s words and it seemed that Harry gathered that because he paused and started to breathe in a way that allowed him to follow his breathing pattern.
“See ‘Mione I told you they will be here.” As always the extreme loudness that was Ron would not let him fall back asleep. Slowly Harry opened his eyes and found that Draco was still pressed to his chest and somehow the blond was still asleep.
For a moment Harry thought that he was intruding on a very private moment, no one ever hugged him like this, not even Molly with her never-ending supply of love. Just when he was about to turn around and busy himself in the kitchen he felt a hand on his wrist. When he looked up he saw Draco, the blond was smiling and Harry never saw anything more beautiful.
“What if she changed her mind? And its past curfew, what if she won’t help us after curfew?” Harry knew that he shouldn’t laugh but the panicked voice of the ice prince of Slytherin made the corners of his lips involuntary turn-up.
“Yes it was, wanna do it some more.” Looking at the blond he noticed the dazed look that was mixing with a wide smile.
“I won’t let anything happen to you.” He wasn’t sure whether the blond heard him, but he didn’t really care. This was a promise that he will keep no matter what.
He was confused when the witch spoke to him in the gentlest tone he ever heard her use. “I wanted to apologize to you Draco.” For a moment he couldn’t understand what she was saying and then it clicked.
He didn’t want to, he could feel his whole body tense up. He needed to move, what if his aunt would throw him out because he didn’t do something she asked for.
Harry laughs and for a second he thought that he said something wrong, but then he looked a little more serious. “Probably. Come on we are almost at the mall and I want to see your reaction.
After a moment Draco smiled and tears appeared in his eyes. “Oh, Harry that would be amazing.” Suddenly Draco stood in front of him and kissed him.
After another moment of silence, Draco looked at him with fear in his eyes. “I… it’s complicated, I don’t know what is happening. My dreams they changed and I don’t know what is going on.” Harry wanted to say something, to ask what he means, what change, but then Draco spoke once again. “There was something there with me and it was closer, Harry. It was too close. I don’t know what it is I just know I can’t let it touch me.”
After a month of torture, he finally had enough of his delusions so he gave up and went to the only person that would take him, Andromeda. Then Harry showed up and help Andromeda heal him.
“Come on you two we will wait for you in the common room.” Still laughing the two of them finally left their room.
His former nemesis sat in front of him, next to his aunt and slowly picked up his cup. Harry could see untouched pastry on his plate. He frowned and moved his eyes upwards, the boy in front of his looked almost identical with the image Harry can recall of him in 6th year. Bags under his eyes were dark and prominent, his sharp features made even pointier, his moves were painfully slow as if he was afraid that if he shows any kind of emotion he’s going to be smacked.
“We should hurry up.” Draco didn’t really mind the cold weather, but he didn’t want to caught in a snow storm. When Harry didn’t answer he begun to worry. For the last week, Harry was being weird, quieter, more lost in thoughts. Dracon didn’t know what was the reason for this change and he didn’t like it, he much preferred when Harry was loud and smiling. He stopped and noticed that the raven-haired boy didn’t even notice, he let him make a few steps and then called out to him. “Are you okay Harry?”
Neither of them noticed that the door to the kitchen opened and Molly stood in the entrance to the kitchen until she loudly cleared her throat making both of them jump away from each other.
“Have you ever thought about having our own child?” Draco could tell that this surprised Harry, his browns were furrowed and he looked uncertain.
He brought his hand to his face and as he made contact with the cut he could feel it opening again. He looked up and for the first time this evening he saw himself in the mirror. His hair was everywhere, his whole left side was covered by it, but he could still make out the bloody stain.
Pandora started to pace the room. “Like connecting Disillusionment Charm, Silencio and Notice-Me-Not to achieve untimed cloaking.” She paused for a moment then smiled with one of the mischievous smiles. “That’s actually clever. Thanks, dad.” With that, she ran out of the room.
“This was brilliant.” With a smile, Harry noticed that Draco’s voice was a little hoarse and it was all thanks to him.
“And why not?” Draco knew that this question was coming but honestly he couldn’t answer it even to himself.
I'm writing the three last chapter, and after that, I'm going to start working on another fic. Thanks for reading!
He slowly felt himself drift when suddenly the fireplace flashed green, quickly he sat up and watched as Draco appeared in the fireplace. As his boyfriend dusted himself off, Harry stood up and enveloped him in tight a hug.
Through his haze, Draco suddenly heard a child’s laughter. What was a child doing with Bellatrix? And then it all clicked.
However, he didn’t want to tell Potter that he is worried that his presence may have a negative impact on his young cousin. They may be forming some sort of friendship but he is still unwilling to spill all his worries and secrets.
He watched as a small pond appeared, looking closer he discovered that it was the small pond that he was so fond of when he was a child. He knew exactly where it was on the manor grounds and even now he could find it with his eyes closed. He could feel himself smile. “Oh, you got to teach me how to do that.”
When the train finally arrived, the compartment that he and his friends were occupying once again was the last to exit the train. Harry was the last to actually step on the platform when he finally pocked his head out of the train the crowd of students once again looked straight at him. He wanted to run, but suddenly a hand appeared in front of his head. Draco wanted to hold Harry’s hand despite the poisonous looks that the rest of the students were sending him. He took his hand without hesitation and let Draco guide him to the carriage.
This time it was Ron, who answered him. “That’s why we came for the two of you. I figured that since no one saw the two of you since we got off the Hogwarts express you will be here.”
Trans and non-binary people are valid and amazing. Ace/Aro people exist and I love every single one of y'all!
For the first time they ate in silence, Harry found it a little difficult to eat with only one hand but he didn’t want to let go of Draco’s hand. When he looked at the boy next to him he noticed that Draco was pushing his food around his plate without actually eating it. He frowned Andromeda told him that Draco still had difficulties with eating when he was nervous.
“I’m sorry. I think I crashed your party. I — fuck I’m sorry.” Draco breathing was picking up again. She tried to calm him, but nothing was getting through to him.
He felt Andromeda’s arms on him. She was saying something, but he couldn’t make out any words. His legs gave up under him. Someone picked him up. He couldn’t say whether it was his aunt or Potter. Someone moved him on the bed and then the darkness took him.
year, the feeling of uneasiness lessen and Draco could breathe a little better. All the chatter in the Hall was silenced with one glance from the new headmistress.
Dr Bright looked at him in silence for a moment. “Okay. Let’s begin then.” He still didn’t move his eyes from the door, he could hear shuffling of papers. “I need to know why you became a part of the group that called themselves Death Eaters”
A car drove past them and he couldn't stop the grimace that appeared on his face, in the corner of his eyes he could see that Ron did the same. He wasn’t sure if this is because of the flying car incident from the second year or if Ron has the same problem with the air quality that he has, but the gesture immediately made him relax.
Polish LGBTQIA+ Community I know it's bad but don't lose hope. I see you and one day it will be better. If not we can always start a revolution!!!
After putting on the film, Harry sat next to Draco. A moment later he felt Draco shift, and he watched as the blond lied down on the couch.
Draco could feel dread working its way up to the surface. He wanted to run, running is always the best way of survival. He stood up and immediately fell once again. His legs weren’t listening to him, but he had to move and he had to do it soon.
The students slowly started to exit the train. Draco, as well as Harry, didn’t want to be seen by anyone so their compartment was the last to empty. When Draco finally emerged from the train he could feel the shift in the atmosphere. He knew that people would not react kindly when they saw him, but he hoped that the hexes would start at least after the feast.
Andromeda abruptly stopped talking mid-sentence and looked at him. “Good, he was attached to me when you were at Hogwarts now he is all yours and Harry’s. Tonight you two are babysitting and I will relax.” She smiled at Granger, finished her conversation and only after that she nodded at Harry and him. “Let’s go boys.”
Hermione could hear as Draco mumbled almost inaudibly “bathroom” and hurried away from the table. She saw that Harry wanted to follow, but instead, he sat down and looked straight at her.
Once again Draco was brought back to reality by Potter’s voice. “Actually, I was wondering are you free tomorrow?”
Draco knew that holding Harry’s hand was selfish, what if someone sees them and will give Harry problems. All the different scenarios kept popping up in his head, but still, he couldn’t let go of the comfort that this small gesture brought him.
Harry was worried, he knew that there would be some backlash when he decided to start a relationship with Draco, but he was not expecting the groups of people to approach him every day asking if his relationship was a joke or if perchance he was blackmailed into it. Some even went as far as trying to convince him that Draco used an unforgivable on him or dosed him with a love potion. The more he had to explain that he, in fact, was sane and that he was happy with Draco the more annoyed he got.
He didn’t stop on his way to their table but he did slow down and let Harry catch up. When he felt Harry’s presents next to him, he smiled and kissed him on the cheek.
“Come on, let's help Harry and Sam with the table and hope that your sister won’t set anything on fire this time.” Harper laughed as they made their day to the cottage. Harry couldn’t believe that Teddy already ended Hogwarts, he remembers sending him off at King’s Cross as if it was yesterday. Now the boy stood taller than him with a smile on his face and the whole world opened to him.
Draco was sure that if he passes all his N.E.W.T.s with outstanding results he will be able to find a job, the problem was that this conviction didn’t help him learn. He was studying for 6 hours straight and his sleep schedule still was in tatters. Harry helped a lot, the boy was very supportive, recently he was on a mission to get Draco to sleep through the whole night, which included almost caring Draco from the library to their room. The memory brought a rare smile to his face, he was sure that Harry caught it because the raven-haired boy started to smile as well. Draco still wasn’t sure how he got so lucky but decided not to dwell on it too much.

Draco was shocked to discover that even when days became shorter and darker the friendship that he had with the golden trio didn’t disappear. With every day he spent with them he appreciated them more and more, the darkness in his mind was slowly replaced with the warm feeling that he associated with his new friends. Another change that came with the new season was Luna. When he agreed to help Neville with the potion he didn’t know that Luna would be with them, but slowly he warmed up to her. The girl didn’t blame him for the fact that she was trapped in his family home, Draco couldn’t believe that she actually thanked him for the fact that he tried to help her and the rest of the prisoners. The potion that they were preparing was almost done and he was sure that around holidays they would be able to test the final product.
“You heard him, Andy, it seems that I am staying.” Draco was glad that Harry didn’t sound disappointed or angry. “I just have to say Ron and Hermione not to wait up for me. We kinda got separated.” Looking around Draco noticed that he could see the couple anywhere.
The lesson was peaceful until the Headmistress told them to practice. Draco watched with amusement as Harry picked up his wand to cast the spell. At first, the rubber replica stayed in the shape of Harry’s wand, perfectly still, then just as Harry made a quick move with it the whole thing became wobbly and Draco couldn’t stop laughing. Harry looked at his wand then at still laughing Draco.
“This day cannot get any weirder. Yeah, I will help.” He hoped that this time he was right and this day didn’t hold any new surprises.
“There was a lot of scared boys Harry, but none of them did what I did.” He couldn’t keep the bitterness from his voice.
“Honestly, boys you have a whole classroom waiting for you.” Harry hated when Hermione used her parent voice on them, he hated it even more when she was right.
When they arrived in their room, Draco pulled Harry towards him. The kiss they exchanged was passionate and left him breathless and wishing for more. Thankfully he didn’t have to wait long, Harry kissed him and Draco quickly pressed against the shorter boy losing himself in the kiss.
“Okay so next weekend camping, that’s it?” He looked at Draco expecting him to just nod, but Draco looked flustered. “What is it?”
“Yeah, okay I will give you that.” He knew that she was disanointed that her potion still didn't work, but Draco wasn’t sure whether to encourage her more or thank Merlin.
Trans people are valid and of course Trans Rights! Non-binary people and Asexuals people exist and are part of the community.
“I’m sorry for casting an unforgivable on you and for using you. Although I have my reasons I don’t consider them valid anymore.” Once again the perfect pureblood was speaking.
The door on the opposite wall creaked and opened. Bellatrix stood in the doorway, but that wasn’t possible, right? Bellatrix was dead, she couldn’t do anything to him, not now and not ever again. He knew Bellatrix, she was crazy and her crazy was reflected on her face, but this person didn’t have the look, that hunted his nightmares. He could feel himself back up into the wall. The person was getting closer and Draco didn’t want to look, only pain will come if he misbehaves.
“I didn’t know you have company. I can come back later if this is not a good time.” He could feel his whole body tens again.
“Draco, you’re beautiful.” He felt himself jerk and Harry speed up his pace. “I’m going to come.” With that Draco felt the Gryffindor orgasm.
The prospect of safely spending the day in Hogsmeade without having to worry about their friends interrupting them or judging eyes of the other students sounded nice. “You can take me anywhere as long as we won’t be going to Madam Puddifoot's. I have nothing against pink, but this place screams enough.”
“It adds excitement. Anyway, what did Minerva wanted?” He allowed for the change of topics, not wanting Harry to embarrass himself more.
“What kind of healer will come to aid him, Andromeda.” She glared at him. ”I know that he’s your nephew and I don’t want him to die, but if I say his name at St. Mungus no one will come. You and I both know it” The boy had a point
“Draco, I need you to tell me everything. I know that your father most likely did it and I understand that talking about this is hard but I need to know” Oh, great now he felt like he didn’t have a choice.
Draco watched as Harry blushed slightly. “I didn’t want her to see me in pyjamas at noon.” Draco looked at him and only just noticed that Harry was in fact in his pyjamas, patterned in small moving golden snitches.
She wanted to say something, really she did, but no words came and when she looked at the boy she noticed that he had a faraway look on his face. She turned towards Harry and realize that her friend looked at Draco with concern as if the boy was lost in more ways than one.
He could feel Draco’s hot breath on his face, the blond leaned in towards Harry’s ear and whispered. “There is a lot of things I’m talented in.”
Draco shifted once again, his right hand that Harry still held laid on his chest and Draco’s body was pressed to Harry’s left side. Harry’s right arm was secured around Draco’s waist. Slowly the felt his consciousness slip as he felt asleep with Draco in his hand he heard a “Thank you” that for him sounded far away, but somehow he knew that it came from the boy next to him.
After they cleaned up and cuddled on the sofa, Draco knew that he couldn’t postpone this conversation anymore. Slowly he detangled from Harry’s warm body and looked at him. Harry looked surprised and concerned.
With the corner of his eye, he saw that Draco started to wake Sam up, mentally he wished Draco luck, their youngest child was a nightmare to wake up. Hermione also began to stir because of the noise that they were making. When she finally opened her eyes and noticed that he was standing in front of her, the expression she wore morphed into accusatory one.
“Is she okay with you telling me this?” Ginny talked about this so effortlessly and Harry wondered if he ever will be able to be so free.
Currently, Harry, Hermione and Ron stood in an empty corridor, they were waiting for Draco to finish the practical part of his transfiguration exam, which would mark the end for the N.E.W.T.s for the four of them. Harry was immensely glad that now they could relax, and that they didn’t have to wait for another week to finish their exams as some 7
“Do you think that this suggestion was smart?” A voice that he didn't think he would hear again outside of the Hogwarts walls startled him.
“Oh, I’m sure that the people would do anything for the chosen one.” For a moment he thought that Draco was mocking him, but when he looked at the blond he was smiling. “Just imagine the ministry officials trying to lift a tree.”
The backroom of The Three Broomsticks was not how Harry imagined it, first of all, it was bright and he also couldn’t find any speck of dust.
When he composed himself, Draco found that Harry was looking at him intently a small smile playing on his lips. He couldn’t help but smile himself, slowly he moved to stand next to his boyfriend and kissed him.
And end by informing you that Trans people are valid, non-binary people are valid, ace/aro people are valid and part of the community and don't let any TERF convince you differently. Even if this TERF wrote your favourite book.
“I wonder if you are McGonagall’s new favourite student.” Upon noticing the sceptical look that Draco shoot at Potter, the boy who lived only smiled wider and added. “I mean you were daydreaming during her class and you don’t even get detention, trust me you’re the first”
At first, she didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. Of course, she didn’t notice after all she wasn’t really looking for any signs. The boy was agitated which in itself was weird. She didn’t know what to do, she couldn’t just tell him to leave, but Harry was coming and the boys didn’t get along no matter how hard she tried. Draco was shaking she could see it from the other side of the room.
Draco loved growing up in the manor, sure it was gloomy, gigantic and he got lost at least once a week, but it was home and his parents lived there. He loved his parents, they were a little hard on him, but he knew that they loved him and they only wanted what’s best for him.
Harry thinks Draco is pretty, then does a risky move and thinks that he fucked up (Spoiled Alert! He didn't.).
With one swift motion, he took Draco’s arms in his. “It’s gonna be okay Draco and even if it’s not I’m going to be there with you and we can leave at any moment.” Draco uttered no sound but Harry watched as he slowly nodded and looked
“We need to remember to take Harper to their training tomorrow.” He watched as Draco’s face fell a little.
“Is that a bad thing? Are you leaving me?” He hoped that the attempt at humour would cheer Draco up.
“I — could you excuse me for a moment?” he didn’t wait for the response. He could barely control his limbs.
Quickly he made his way to Draco, when he was close enough, he enveloped the blond in a hug from behind. He felt as Draco relaxed and leaned on him, he smiled and kissed the blond’s temple.
The raven-haired boy turned and walked back to him. “Are you okay?” this time Harry’s sounded worried but also soft and Draco could do nothing but nod and hope that the Gryffindor couldn’t see how flustered he was.
She heard the door click open. She looked behind her and could see that Harry was standing there with his wand drawn. She knew that Draco couldn’t see this, but she still moved to cover the wand. The door opened and Andromeda couldn’t believe her eyes. Draco collapsed on the floor, there was a bleeding cut on his cheek and for the first time she noticed how thin he was.
He reached for Harry’s hand and together they went after his aunt. She led them to a room that he didn’t recall, he was almost sure that it was not there during summer. Andromeda stopped in front of the door and turned towards them. Draco looked at her when she caught his eye Andromeda stepped to the right and he saw the door. In the middle of the door, his name was written in Andromeda’s neat handwriting.
“I mean I can, I learned from Snape so it’s only logical, but I know that not everyone would be okay with me tutoring them so Hermione could also do it if people are uncomfortable.” He knew that he was getting more and more agitated, but he needed Harry to understand that he wanted to do, he wanted to help.
Noticing that Harry still has his underwear on, Draco quickly took hold of them and freed Harry’s cock. The raven-haired man gave him one of his brilliant smiles and started to kiss Draco. Just as he was about to turn Harry stopped him and kissed him once again.
He immediately looks at the train and saw Draco, his Draco. His face looked paler than usual and Harry could see the irregularity of his breath by the rise and fall of his chest. He didn’t even know how he got rid of the crowd that surrender him, but in a second he found himself in front of the blond. Slowly he made sure that Draco’s was okay. He stayed with him during McGonagall speech, he only left Draco for a moment in which he had to climb into the carriage. When the door close behind him he could hear as Hermione and Ron loudly exhaled and he smiled. Finally, he had a moment of peace, Harry sat next to Draco and upon examining hi face he noticed that he was smiling. Harry was glad that even in a moment like this the blond could find enough strength to smile. The rest of the ride to Hogwarts was spent in silence. The four of them knew that this moment of peace will end the moment they enter the school.
“I believe you.” He looked up, the man reached for his wand and Draco recoiled instantly. “I’m not going to hurt you, I promise. I going to heal your hand okay?” He didn’t know if he could trust the man, but his hand started to sting, slowly he nodded. The relief was instant. “I realise you don’t trust me, but I think you should find a therapist or someone who you can talk to.”
As he was about to open his mouth and deny everything Andromeda spoke again. “I won't say anything, and I'm certain that Draco didn't notice anything. This boy can be so oblivious sometimes, but if you want to talk about this I'm always here.” Harry suddenly understood what Ron meant about being ready to talk.
“Andromeda, what’s going on?” He needed an explanation of why Malfoy of all people was in the same house that his godson was in.
Draco laughed as Teddy chased Victoire and Dominique around their cottage. The whole family got together because of an announcement that Ron and Hermione had to make. Draco suspected what it was, but decided not to spoil the fun, instead, he watched Harry, who
When Draco first found out about the dinner he made Andromeda promise to him that she will go first to make sure that all the Weasleys were okay with him attending. After his aunt left he was to wait for five minutes and if she didn’t come back in this time then it meant that it was okay for him to go.
He wanted to argue but a vision of new sweets made him shut up. The ice cream was actually amazing, it was sweet but not overly sweet like Harry said they would be. When he looked up he noticed that Harry had an expectational look on his face.
At first, Draco didn’t react and she saw as Harry’s hand hovered above his hand. He didn’t take it and she wondered if this was some kind of trigger. She looked back at Draco’s face and found that the faraway looked started to leave his eyes. Suddenly he stood up and Harry quickly moved so Draco could leave.
“Because she is wired like that. She sees someone who needs taking care of and she is the first in line to do it. I think every mom is like this.”
“But I still did.” This argument was familiar for him, every day in the Manor he had it with himself.  Logically he knew that there was nothing he could do, but deep down he was still trying to find a better justification for his actions.
“Just to get one thing straight, I didn’t visit Andy only because of him, I was also visiting Teddy.” He didn’t know why but he felt like he needed to explain himself.
He thought that he had better control over his emotions, but the fact that right now his breathing started to slowly pick up and his vision was getting more and more blurry proved him otherwise.
After a week of constant planning, they finally came up with an idea that made not only Draco and him happy, but also Hermione and Ron. The plan consisted of frequent trips to muggle London and Hogsmeade and trying new thing. For Harry, participation in this was personal for two reasons. Firstly, he was a little selfish and wanted to be there when Draco discovered new things, the look of wonder that appeared on the blond face when he tried ice cream for the first time was imprinted in Harry’s mind and he wanted to see all the emotions of the once ice prince of Slytherin. Secondly, he had enough of being a passive watcher as Draco slowly started to resemble the boy that he found crying in the bathroom in 6
Just as he was about to lay down the door opened, Harry stood in the doorway concern was painted on his face and it was almost too much for Draco. He stood there in the middle of the room looking at his boyfriend and he realised that for the first time he had someone he could confide in, someone who won’t judge if he tells him that today was too much.
Exchanging glances with Hermione he noticed that she nodded and smiled a little. “Okay so we can definitely have drunken camping, but you two need to breve some hungover potions.”
A cough drove his attention away from the boy sitting next to him. He looked up and noticed that Hermione was looking at him and then a Draco. At first, he didn’t know what was wrong, but then he looked down and noticed that he was still holding Draco’s hand. He felt a blush making its way up his neck.
“If you allow me.” Harry was sure that McGonagall sensed Draco’s hesitation and wanted to give him an option, by the, also knew that this was the only way to understand what is happening to him.
After imagining Minerva’s face when she will have to read the list of names that consists of Wesley’s and Potter-Black’s he joined the laughing.
“Mr Black could you stay for a moment, I assure you, you won’t be late for your next class.” Draco looked at her and noticed that the witch looked a little concerned. He nodded and looked at Harry, who was standing next to him.
Now on Saturday’s morning, Harry was buzzing with excitement, he couldn’t suppress his smile when he looked at the blond sitting next to him. Draco was wearing black trousers and elegant crimson sweatshirt that he borrowed from Harry. When Draco put on the sweatshirt Harry couldn’t believe that the Slytherin looked good while wearing Harry’s clothes, but now looking at Draco a warm feeling appeared in his stomach and he couldn’t take his eyes away.
“I bet he spread his legs for your protection.” Draco couldn’t see the person who said this and before he could scan the group another person decided to speak. “Harry Potter’s personal slut.” He could feel as his body started to shake. “Or perhaps he used some sort of love potion to make the saviour of our world fuck a dirty Death Eater.” Draco wanted to turn and run away, he knew that it would be cowardly but he really didn’t want to deal with all the group that was getting bigger and bigger.
When they finally broke the kiss both of them were breathless, Draco couldn’t stop looking at Harry’s swollen lisp. “Thank you Draco, this is amazing, but I don’t have anything for you.”
OMG, they were roommates! Also if you cannot tell I'm a fan of the Marauders and now Hogwarts has Mr Black and Mr Potter once again.
“Harry are you okay? You drifted off again.” He felt his cheeks darken. He knew that he got more distracted to closer the holidays got, but could anyone blame him. The more he thought about spending time away from Draco the more he missed him, even though they still were in the same room.
His family had a trial, of course, it had a trial. After the fiasco with Black, the ministry couldn’t afford any mistake, so Draco and his family were first put into the ministry custody and then a fair trial happened. Deep down Draco knew that Potter would show up because Potter couldn’t stop being the savour. Thanks to his testimony his mother got five years on house arrest and for this he was glad.
The blond smiled and led him downstairs where Andromeda already set the table. As Teddy was currently asleep the three of them tried to make as little noise as possible. This, however, didn’t stop the conversation entirely. In a lowered voice Andromeda asked them about the school year. Draco, of course, got more question because Andy needed to be brought up to pace about Draco’s side project with Neville, Harry throughout the whole conversation tried not to show his jealousy.
When he could finally regain control over his body and his body stopped shaking. Draco noticed that Harry was watching him with a funny expression on his face.
Harry looks back at Andromeda, their eyes lock and he knows that both of them have no idea how to respond to something like this.
Draco didn’t know what game Harry was playing, but he was almost sure that he didn’t want to be a part of it. Sure the hand-holding and hugging was fantastic. He felt safe when he was wrapped around Harry or when the Gryffindor took his hand every time that he was starting to panic. For the first time, he felt safe in someone else presence and of course, it had to be Harry, it always had to be Harry.
McGonagall looked at him sceptically, but when she spoke he couldn’t hear the suspicion in her voice. “I see. If you haven’t found anything yet, I recommend talking with someone who is a specialist on the matter or someone who practised the matter longer. I also recommend you ask for help you are not alone this time Mr black.” Draco noticed that for a moment she had a weird nostalgic expression, but quickly she scolded her face into more professional.
“It’s okay, all is forgiven. You can call me Molly, mrs6 Weasley is so formal.” Molly smiled at him. “Oh, Harry is in the kitchen, we still have some time to dinner, Hermione told me that you two need to talk, so if you want to do it, there’s no better time than now. The kitchen is just round the corner, next to the dining room”
He heard Ron snort and expected a snarky comment to come from him, but it was Draco who beat him to it. “Honestly Harry, you’re always hungry. Do you not feed yourself?”
“Oh, Harry… Harry… I’m gonna…” Before the blond could finish Harry felt Draco’s cum on his hands. The image made Harry pick up the pace and soon he felt his orgasm. He came with Draco’s name on his lips just like the blond did with his.
Hermione didn’t tell them what was the title of the exhibition, but he trusted that she chose something interesting. The four of them eat their breakfast while Neville talked about the new herbology project that he was going to help with. Harry was happy for him. He knew that the boy is currently working on creating a plant that can help with cruciatus damage, but he still has to find some potion master who would work with him, and Slughorn wasn’t very kin on helping Neville. Harry knew that Neville was aware that right now Draco is the best potion maker in Hogwarts and if he really wants someone’s help it has to be Draco’s. That’s why during every meal and every time they were hanging out with Neville he was bringing up his herbology project and by the look that Draco currently had on his face he was going to cave in sooner than later.
“Days when we don’t have to worry about lessons or about other people, days when we can be just us and cuddle or in this instance lay under our tree and just be.” Draco still didn’t open his eyes, the Slytherin looked extremely relaxed and Harry intended to keep him this way.
Before he had a chance to check or even say anything Hermione beat hit to it. “Draco I’m glad you could make it. Harry cannot shut about you.” He felt his cheeks heating up.
Tears were still streaming down his face. “Who would help me. You just said it yourself, they all think I want to hurt them.” His voice sounded wrong, he couldn’t stop the tears and now he couldn’t even control his own voice.
“Harry, I wanna… more.” Draco’s voice was tinted with lust and Harry was proud that he could pick it up.
If you are from Poland remember you are a person, you are amazing and I see you and the fact that you are not giving up fills my heart with so much pride for you. Never give up, we are going to survive this! <3
Harry was laying on the sofa of Grimmauld Place, his eyes trained on the fireplace. Today Draco was coming back from one of his lectures, that focused on reversing advanced poisons and Harry was determined not to miss his arrival.
Quickly she scolded her expression into something more professional and started to explain. “Mr Black you see I believe that the shadow that hunts your dreams is, in fact, a part of you.” Draco looked at her and wanted to protest just as Harry started to cough. The witch looked at them unimpressed and gestured for them to settle down. “Let me explain, you were brought up in a very strict way, I imagine that your parents didn’t want you to interact with people that weren’t deemed worthy.” He nodded and looked down. “There’s really nothing to be ashamed of. Because of the fact that your parents wanted to turn you into a miniature version of them, your mind didn’t create a space in which you can be yourself. Don’t misunderstand me, Mr Black you may find forest calming, many people do, but this forest is bare, untouched.”
He thought that Draco will move away from him after this admission, but Draco didn’t move for a very long time. Harry worried that perhaps he fell asleep, but when he looked at Draco he noticed that his eyes were blown wide. And Harry understood what happened in an instance. He always thought that Draco’s parents were telling him that they are proud of him every day, but now he knew that this wasn’t true.
“It’s okay Harry.” Looking at the blond he could see nothing but honesty, but the feeling of disgust for himself was still present.
Hermione smiled and kissed her husband. “I’m pregnant and we would like Harry and Ginny to be the God-parents”
“Harry we wouldn’t want anyone else. You are and always will be a part of our family.” Draco watched as Harry’s smile grew.
Hermione started to talk with Andromeda about some book at both of them read when Harry spoke. “I’m going to Andy’s tonight, so you’re on your own with dinner.”
Rosmerta looked at Draco then at him and finally after what felt like forever she nodded. “Very well follow me to the back.”
“Oh, that’s brilliant. Then I will be here tomorrow at noon. As for now do you want to play or watch a movie?”
He used all his will power to answer Draco, but even for him, his voice sounded a little shaky. “Why wouldn’t I have everything?”
Harry held his breath and allowed Draco to get all his worried off of his chest. The boy was badly shaking and Harry pulled him a little closer. He wanted to wrap him in a hug and make all his worries disappear.
For a moment nothing happened then Draco started to kiss him back. Harry couldn’t think, right now the only thing that matter, the only thing that was real was the blond in his arms, the blond that was kissing back.
“Hey! I wasn’t the only one that took his time.” Even though he knew that it really took both Draco and him forever to finally figure out their feelings and gather enough courage to confess, he still felt the need to somehow defend his pride.
She helped the boy stand up, Harry on his other side. She could hear as Draco was trying to talk, but all his words were slurring together. Andromeda knew he wasn’t drunk even if he acted like it.
He followed Sam to the edge of the forest where a small pond was. Draco loved that pond when Harry shoved it to him he replaced the one from the manor with this one in his mind on the same night. San tugged at his hand, and Draco looked in the direction that the child was pointing. An enormous brownish toad sat near the bank of the pond. He smiled as the child started to talk about the difference between toads and frogs.
The Gryffindor smiled a little and lead him towards the bed. After noticing that Draco still wore his robs, Harry helped him remove them and Draco watched as the raven-haired boy neatly folded them and placed them one of the chairs. He almost laughed at the gesture, Harry knew him so well. After removing his robes, the Gryffindor returned to him and lowered the two of them onto the bed. Immediately Draco curled u closer to Harry, the raven-haired boy started to gently stroke his hair.
“Dear are you sure you should eat all this?” He hated when his mother sounded all high and mighty “I don’t want to be rude but I would want you to get pudgy, after all, you are coming back to school soon”
“I can’t. I have a psychological evaluation before Hogwarts. They want to make sure that I won’t be hurting any student or that I’m not a Death Eater in disguise.” All three of them turned and looked at Draco.
He walked through the streets of Muggle London, his luggage at his side. He knew where he was going, but he wasn’t sure if he will be welcome.
Harry smiled at him, the smiled looked sad and Draco realized that he knew the answer. “Probably not, but one can hope.” And Draco hoped.

Hello, I'm late with the chapter I know but TBH I'm still not okay after my exam session and I will try to write more during the weekend so next chapter should be up on Saturday, hopefully!
For a moment he debates with himself how to say what was bothering him without making the trio mad, but when he couldn't come up with anything he decided to just say what was the problem. “It’s the air. I hate it. It smells wrong” From the look that Hermione gave him, he said something wrong, slowly he started to open his mouth to explain, but Ron was faster.
I'm going to give you some details on the Sirius raised Draco fic. Basically, I started to write it, and I like it very much, but I'm gonna start posting it when the plot will get to around the 3rd year because of my work and uni. The chapters will be also longer around 5k per chapter, so I also need time to edit them, so I hope that you will be patient.
During his first year at Hogwarts, he didn’t know how to behave, he never had this much freedom and besides, he still believed in the things his father basically beat into him. Then winter break came and he saw happy reunions, this made him realize that his family isn’t so great, his parents shouldn’t punish him, shouldn’t leave bruises on him. Still, he didn’t know what to do with this knowledge, he could just go through the notions and survive. When the first year ended and he was below Granger, his father wasn’t pleased. Lucius almost killed him this summer, so in the second year, he decided to take all his frustrations on other people. He hated Granger because in his head she was the source of his pain, he hated Weasley because he had the family life and love that Draco never had and never would have, and he hated Potter because he had real friends that would die for him, not future business partners like he had.
Noticing his hesitation Draco flipped them over, placing himself on top of Harry. His hand lingering near Harry’s cock and his mouth closing on Harry’s earlobe. After a few seconds of sucking the Slytherin moved away and looked Harry in the eyes.
“Wait, you’ve got Hermione and Ron to distract me while you prepare all of this, I could’ve helped you.” Draco couldn’t believe how stupid this boy could sometimes be.
“Honestly, Harry. It’s like you don’t listen to your son. Toads generally have shorter legs as well as rougher and thicker skins. You have to spend more time with your son when he sits next to the pond. I seriously don’t know how the frog possession started, but I feel that this one isn’t going anywhere.”
After what felt as forever but was, in fact, a very long five minutes he couldn’t stand it anymore and went for the door once again. Before he could try for the handle, the door swung open revealing surprised Draco.  The surprise quickly melted into one of the smiles that now rarely appeared on Draco’s face. “Hello, roommate.” His voice was sweet and for a moment Harry didn’t understand the implication behind the words, but then he felt as his eyes widened.
“Andy, what did he said?” He knew that he shouldn’t be pushing, but he needed to know the full story.
Andromeda’s voice made him look back at her. “Not to worry Harry. I’m sure that we will see them any minute now”
When they arrived near the pub Harry noticed that Draco started to fidget. He played with his hands, Harry watched as Draco started to scratch at his left forearm.
Harry, his Harry choose to be seen with him, to be his friend. Draco wanted to hug him so badly, but he knew that he couldn't, at least not in front of everyone.
“We have a room Weasley, this one.” The two of them didn’t even look ashamed when they started to laugh at the blond bed head.
-year Harry could admit that the Aurors weren’t for him. Both Ron and he left the training, Ron decided to help with the new joke shop and help Hermione, who was on her way to becoming the next minister of magic, on her work with creature rights while he still didn’t know what to do with himself. Harry loved the fact that he had more time for Teddy, Draco and all his friends, but after being constantly in motion for the last 18 years of his life he couldn’t help but feel useless. Draco decided to persuade Potion Mastery, and thanks to the potion that helped with the crutiatus damage he was moving quite fast through the potion field. Harry was sure that soon the blond will focus more on healing in his potions.
“You kidding, we are actually going to room together?” Harry saw as the smile was slowly disappearing, the boy slowly nodded and Harry presented him with the biggest smile that he could muster.
For a moment Dr Bright just looked at him, then he nodded, stood up and send an owl. 15 minutes later there was a knock at the door. Thomas opened them and in walked Harry looking like he just woke up and Draco never wanted to hug him more.
The silence in the room didn’t help Harry’s wandering mind. This time he knew better, he won’t be the first to speak, he can tell that Andromeda also waits for Malfoy to speak.
Harry watched as Draco’s face close off, the look on his face was similar to the one that he had at the beginning of his stay with Andromeda. He knew that Draco wanted to run, but Harry won’t let him. With one swift move, he turned around and came face to face with a young woman in bright pink robes.
“Harry James Potter, next time you are taking care of the little nightmares. I seriously won’t be envying when they will finally attend Hogwarts.” Draco started to laugh at comment and Harry once again questioned if he wants to teach at Hogwarts when that happens.
Between constant visits to the library, studying, attending normal lessons, doing his school work and sleeping less and less Draco was going insane. He knew that he won’t be able to survive on only a few hours of sleep much longer, but Hermione and he still, after three weeks weren’t able to find anything like this in any book that was even slightly concerned with the topic of occlumency. Most of the night Draco felt like crying, he was aware that this could take time, but he was slowly going mad.  The days bleed together, every day looked the same, nothing was helping him and he knew that sooner or later the feeling of being trapped that was so familiar to him when he still was living in the Manor will come back.
After they ate, Draco washed the dishes and the two of them walked to the study where Harry placed the new couch and the TV.
“Well, I think it’s high time we go back to Andromeda’s. I’m sure she cooked us dinner. Are you staying or do you have plans?” He knew that his voice wasn’t back to normal, but at this point, he didn’t care.
They stayed in this position for almost an hour when Draco finally regain some of his composure. Slowly he lifted his head and looked at his boyfriend. The Gryffindor had his eyes closed and he looks peaceful, without thinking about the gesture Draco lift his hand and brushed the loose curls from Harry’s forehead. When he looked back at Harry’s face their eyes locked, Draco could stop looking into the emerald eyes.
It’s been a month since Harry and he decided to bury the hatchet and Draco had to admit that Potter wasn’t as bad as he thought his whole life. Sure, at times he was annoying and sometimes even selfish especially when he wanted to play chess and Draco wanted to sleep, but everything that happened to Potter during his life, he couldn’t find it in himself to say no to the boy. They play chess every night and although Potter came close a few times, he always won. Draco had to admit that this small victory over the boy who lives made him extremely proud of himself.
Draco just looked at him with tears in his eyes. “ I never knew that you could be so sappy Harry. I – Thank you.” Harry smiled and thought that Draco deliberately left out the last sentence that escaped his bloody mouth that never knew when to shut up but the boy continued with a small smile on his face. “And I wanna live with you too. You make me happy, I thought that I always will be sad, but you make me smile and laugh. I can think when I’m with you.”
“Thank you, I’m still trying but I want to believe that I’m finally becoming the person I’ve always wanted to be.” The smile on Draco’s face was catching and soon Harry was laughing.
At these words, Harry noticed that McGonagall’s whole domineer changed. She looked at Draco and Harry could see that she was curious, impressed but also deeply worried.
He felt his heart skip a beat. “I don’t know if I’m allowed there.” When Harry looked at him questioningly Draco reluctantly complied. “The whole imperious thing.”
I hope y'all have a great day and that you punched some nazi. Be yourself and keep fighting. I love you and I stand with you. Don't give up and don't let the assholes win.
“Brilliant. Finish your melting ice cream and let’s go.” Draco looked down at his hand and found that it was in fact covered in melted ice cream. He felt his face redden. “Don’t worry, there’s a toilet inside.”
The problem always arose when he made a mistake. It didn’t matter if the mistake was a small one like forgetting to ask permission for something or getting something wrong when his father questioned him. At first, the punishments were small like going to bed without dinner or being sent to his room, but then it started to escalate. His father sometimes closed him in the dungeon for a day or two and then the beatings started.
At his question, Draco smiled wider and Harry could hear him chuckle silently, the blond looked away for a moment and then their eyes were locked. “I don’t know Harry it’s not like someone steals your clothes for over a month.”
After half an hour of waiting Draco finally speared in front of him. Even though his expression would be considered unreadable by most Harry now knew better, Draco’s eyes still held the same emotions that were present before the lesson began.
One of the better things that came from Draco’s friendship with Neville was the fact that more and more students started to see him as their peer and not as a Death Eater scum. Sure Draco still had to deal with some justice-seeking students, but more and more people made the effort to see him as he is and not as he was made to behave.  A lot of students also saw the fact that Draco changed his last name as proof that he no longer believes the pureblood ideas.
Sleep took him almost imminently, one moment he was laying in his bed listening to Harry’s breathing and the next he was standing in the similar crossroad. Something was there he could feel it, it was closer than before. He remembers that when he first had this dream he would walk and walk for hours trying to find out where each of the four roads would take him. Each time he would end up back where he started and when he woke up he would be more exhausted than before he fell asleep. When Voldemort lived at the manor the dream changed, Draco could feel that he was no longer alone, something or someone was with him. He didn’t know whether this thing was looking for a way out or him. After a month of this, he knew that this thing took permanent residence in his dream, he could feel it getting closer and closer. One night after some Death Eater decided that testing his new curses on Draco was a great idea, he decided to wait for the presence. He knew that this was stupid but he was exhausted and at this point, he didn’t care if this will kill him or not. He sat in the middle of the crossroad waiting and even though he could feel the thing moving and coming closer to him, it never actually approached him. Now he knew that if he turned around he would be able to see the thing. Slowly he started to walk the opposite way. He could feel the thing coming closer and closer, he didn’t know when he started to run. Vaguely he could hear that someone was calling his name, but he couldn’t focus on the voice, he couldn’t stop running, he couldn’t let this thing catch him.
He wasn’t sure what went wrong, but he knew that he needs to fix it somehow. After a few tries, he finally managed to write a quick note to Granger to make sure that Harry will still attend the Weasley holiday dinner. He was sure that Granger will force Harry to attend even if he didn’t want to.
This year is horrible, but please don't stop fighting. I believe in you and I support you. If you are form Poland, I guess we will see each other during one of the protests. Keep fighting!!
Harry didn’t know what was wrong but something happened at the gallery. The perfect mask that Draco wore, slipped when they watched the series that focused on sexuality. He didn’t really know what could possibly happen but he trusted that Draco will explain everything to him later. After what happened when they watched the painting t
“You stupid, insolent bastard you meant to tell me that you still didn’t compensate for your stupidity in 6th year” Draco could feel the shivers take over him “I still can’t believe how you manage to convict that bastard Potter to testify for you.” The coldness in Lucius' voice made him feel even worse.
After a month Draco was done. He couldn’t do this anymore. His mother and the constant jabs and commentary she provided. His father’s cane that was more frequent the longer he was home. And most importantly his mind, he couldn’t shut his mind.
Draco couldn’t help but look at the raven-haired asshole, who transfigured all his clothes pink. It was breakfast and he sat next to Neville in his now pink robes knowing that he needed to be patient. A large black owl landed in front of the Gryffindor, Draco knew that during breakfast Harry won’t be paying attention to who the sender was. He watched as the Gryffindor absent-mindedly reached for the envelope and unfolded it.
This story is different because I wanted it to be an age gap story meaning that Draco is born during the second war and becomes a potion professor at Hogwarts, where he meets Harry a DADA professor. Harry is still the boy who lived twice, but he is 37 years old while Draco is 23. I know that the age difference is big but in no way I want the relationship to be predatory or based simply on sex, both of them are adults. In the beginning, Draco has no idea who Harry is due to being raised in France and while the aftermath of the war will be present in the story it won't be the main focus. I want this to be kinda enemies-to-friends-to-lovers but with a clean start.
Andromeda was standing behind the counter. Harry turned towards her and noticed the knowing smile that she gave him.
“If we go back who will save your atrocious wardrobe?” He knew that he bravura in his voice sounded fake, but at this point, he didn’t care. He wanted this day to be at least good.
“Well, I probably don’t need to give you a tour. So please close the door behind yourself, don’t let the draft in.” just like that the fake mannerism was back. He knew that it won’t be long for the screaming between Potter and his aunt to start.
Harry pulled slightly away, just enough to look at Draco’s face and with his thumb wiped the tears that escaped him. The raven-haired boy moved closer and rest his forehead on Draco’s. “Come on, we can cuddle.” Draco couldn’t answer him, too afraid that his voice would betray him, after a moment he slightly nodded his head hoping that it would be enough for Harry.
They were supposed to meet at a muggle bar. Hermione and Ron were already there and Harry was volunteered to retrieve Draco. He was glad that Draco became a little bit more comfortable with wearing less formal clothes because when we saw Draco fucking Malfoy in with a soft emerald cardigan, white t-shirt and black skinny jeans he couldn’t breathe. His stupid brain couldn’t stop picturing hugging the boy in front of him.
Without stopping for a breath Harry moved the two of them towards his bed when he heard Draco gasp as his calves hit the bed he stopped and looked at the blond.
“Here drink I all and then we will talk.” She noticed that her voice was a little shaky, so unlike her.
Draco reappeared 10 minutes after he left his eyes were red and she could see that his face was a little damp. Harry immediately made the place so he could sit.
“Did you break something again?” Harper’s cheeks were tinted pink and Draco knew that they most likely did.
“Did you pay them to walk in front of us? Draco began to laugh at the question which did not put Harry’s nerves on ease.
He wanted to back away, to run but he needed answers and this was the only way he could get them. “Okay, will you kill me?” The creature stood still for a moment and Draco was getting ready to run when it shook its head. “That’s reassuring. Is there a way to get rid of you?” Once again the thing stood motionlessly and then slowly nodded. He wanted to ask how, but he knew that the thing couldn’t answer this question.
She watched with horror as her nephew’s legs give way, and he was falling to the ground. Only to be caught by Harry, who seemed to be on high alert. She watched as Harry picked Draco up as if he weighed nothing and Andromeda started to worry that it was precisely the case.
Draco had to admit that this was a very theatrical exit, he smiled thinking of what was to come. Maybe this year won’t be a nightmare, he had Harry, Granger and Weasley. He could do it, this time he will survive without hurting others, he had people that cared, people that he cared about and that cared about him. He made his way towards the carriage that he would be sharing with the golden trio and smiled.
Draco’s voice made him silent. “Yeah, you deserve it. Actually, I think all three of you deserve to hear the actual reason.” Harry could hear the change in his voice, it was more close of, more guarded. “This is a long story that starts before Hogwarts. I can, of course, shorten it but if you want to know the truth, the real truth and the real reason, I highly recommend the long story of how the life of Draco former Malfoy went to shit.”
Draco felt his whole body clench and relax, after a moment Harry lied on top of him and Draco untangled his hand from his curls. Slowly he started to stroke Harry’s back.
“That would be brilliant” the smile on Harry’s face grown and Draco could feel as his own smile made an appearance.
There was a pause, Draco just looked at him and Harry started to wonder if he did something wrong. Draco’s face was calculating, his hands very clasp together, Harry knew that this was mostly to prevent them from shaking.
“Harry is like 8 can you come back after 10?” Harry smiled, he knew that Ron liked to sleep in on weekends, but this was a very important problem and he needed his help.
The days between the beginning of the break and the dinner seemed longer than when Harry was visiting and slowly it drove Draco insane. He was counting the days leading to the dinner and minute by minute he felt more and more nervous. He knew that Andromeda picked up on the change in his behaviour but she didn’t push him for information.
“You know how it is to grow up one way, to always be told something, to be conditioned to do something? You may know it’s wrong or you may want to break that pattern and yet you cannot because you worry that something horrible is going to happen.” He paused for a moment. “I know that it won’t happen but I’m still afraid to do it, I’m afraid to ask for help.” Draco didn’t know why but admitting to Harry that he was afraid made him feel better.
Additional information this chapter is the last of my pre-written ones, so I will make a short break and the next chapter should be at the end of the month or the beginning of July. Hope the end of June is kind to y'all. <3
Together they walked inside the room and immediately Harry could see that Andromeda knew Draco more that he thought he did. The walls were covered in books, some muggles, some wizard. The desk stood near the window so that Draco could see the garden, Harry noticed that one book laid on the desk, from the title he gathered that it was about healing. Looking around he noticed the bed that had Slytherin green covers and the wardrobe. Although the room was small, Harry could see the happiness and excitement in Draco’s eyes.
To his surprise, Draco squeezed his hand harder and when Harry looked at him his cheeks had a lovely shade of pink. “I… Can you please hold my hand it makes me calm. You make me calm.” Draco was looking everywhere but at him and for a moment he wasn’t sure what was supposed to be his next move in this situation. Draco started to pull his hand away. “Of course you don’t have to. Just forget it, this was stupid.” But before Draco could finish he already trapped Draco’s hand back in his.
Before he could even ask, Harry already answer his question. “I will wait for you, so we can go to herbology together.” He smiled and the raven-haired boy returned the gesture.
“Yes. And you and Luna.” They looked at each other and after a moment both started to laugh. “But seriously, thank you for telling me. I thought that Luna was with Neville.”
He knew that Draco tried to be strong, but he also knew that he will only know how this affected him tomorrow. He didn’t want to leave Draco.
She could see that throughout the whole exchange with Ron, Harry’s eyes were locked on her. She looked at him and saw that there was a question she could easily decipher. She knew that she had to give her response, she didn’t feel ready.
Harry noticed that Harper was talking with George clearly distracting him as Pandora and Fred Jr carefully put a few drops of some greenish potion into his Butterbeer. To the left Sam was talking with Rose and Hugo about his new hyper-fixation, Harry wasn’t sure if this time it was Shakespeare or Byron and he noted to remember to ask him tomorrow. Teddy was sitting next to Victoria and Dominique trying, and from what Harry could gather failing to change his features to look like Peeves, both of the girls were laughing, and Harry felt himself a smile as well. Louis and Roxanne were discussing something very vividly, and Harry wouldn’t be surprised if it had something to do with Quidditch. He looked around and searched for the familiar head of platinum blond hair. After what seemed like forever, Harry finally located his husband near the pond. Affection filled him, and he felt as a warm smiled appeared on his face.
“What are you thinking about?” Potter’s tone was soft, he liked it. It was so unlike the tone that he used to use with Draco.
“Yes, I think it would be good for me. Besides, when Teddy gets to Hogwarts I will make sure that he won’t be getting in any trouble.” Draco laughed at his comment and soon Harry joined him.
Suddenly Harry was hit with a great idea, quickly he picked up the taller, but lighter boy and moved towards the bed.
Draco seemed surprised, he didn’t speak for a moment and then a small smile appeared on his face. “Thank you, I think this was the second-best speech someone gave me.”
“It’s public knowledge. I wanted to protect my parents, he said that he would kill them if I disobeyed.” He didn’t know why he had to retell all this again, he didn't want to remember.
“Hey, little guy. What’s up with you? I see you have a new toy” He loved watching as Teddy's eyes light up and a big smile coloured his face.
Draco could just nod his head and hope that this will end before he has a whole meltdown. “What about Hogwarts?” His voice was still raw, but at least the tears started to slow down.
The N.E.W.T.s came quickly after the April Fool’s Day, but Harry supposed that he shouldn’t be complaining. Without the constant threat to his life for the first time in eighteen years, he could say that he was truly prepared for the exams. Not only was he on top of his homework, but he also learned a lot of new things that could potentially help him in his future job.
When the time finally came she realised that she was not ready. She knew that Draco read about occlumency, but she wasn’t prepared to hear about the problem he has. The first idea she had was a curse, but the more he told her the less it fitted. Trying to stretch her memory she couldn’t find anything that would fit what the boy was saying. After Draco finished his explanation she knew what she has to do.
“These assholes. The ministry never learns. They are just a bunch of prejudiced people that think themselves better than everyone else.” Harry was surprised at Hermione’s outburst, but when he thought about it, it made sense.
Suddenly a hand was on his right forearm, he didn’t notice when he moved it and started to scratch at the mark. The skin on his left forearm was red and the skin broke in few places. He looked at the blood with vacant eyes.
“I will hold you to that promise.” When they entered the classroom Draco was in his whole teacher mode, meaning that he barely glanced at Harry.
She heard as Draco’s breathing picked up. She knew that Draco needed to be the one that would open the door.
A small smile appeared on Draco’s face as he sat nearer to the wall, opposite to Ron and next to him. Harry was aware that by sitting next to him Draco shows him that he isn’t going to run even if he wants to. This made him a little proud.
Walking towards Transfiguration he noticed that fewer and fewer people were staring and shouting at him, he had no idea what brought the change, but he hoped that they are not planning something for later.
Quickly Draco stood and moved to face Harry. The bracelet was mostly all black and made out of thin straps, the pendant was gold, a colour that complemented Harry’s shin tone, and in a shape of a snitch, between the snitches wings a small emerald, that reminded Draco of Harry’s eyes, was placed. With shaking fingers, he fastened the bracelet oh Harry’s right wrist and smiled.
After he finally got his breathing back under control, Potter spoke again. “I couldn’t sleep because I need to go do some shopping and I really don’t want to deal will the crowds.” He pauses for a second as if to make sure that Draco is okay. “I managed to hide from all the press and all the people up to this point, but with going back to Hogwarts I’m afraid that my brief period of peace finally ended.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t think this would happen, we can come back to Andromeda’s or if you still up for some ice cream we can go to muggle London.” He knew that he sounded desperate, but he needed to make sure that Draco was okay.
Draco took his hand, and Harry could do only one thing. He leaned and kissed the blond, trying to push everything he was feeling into the kiss. When they pulled back to take a breath, Draco was smiling, and Harry quickly kissed him on his jawline.
“Do you really want to risk the wrath of Hermione Granger?” The sile that was present on Draco’s face faltered and Harry started to laugh out loud. “You don’t have to look so put out. We will still have all afternoon for ourselves.”
He knew that sooner or later he would have to talk about it, especially that he started to fall asleep boring classes or their library visits. The exception to this was their last visit to the library, he not only finally shown Harry one of his sketches but they kissed in front of the full library.  Draco was falling more and more for the raven-haired boy and he knew that no matter what he did this feeling would never disappear.
“Harry” Draco’s voice was tinted with lust and having him utter Harry’s name only made him move faster into the blond.
The man opened his mouth and most likely said something to him, but Draco was too anxious to understand him. After a moment the man understood that Draco was in no position to comprehend what was spoken to him and pointed at his door inviting him in.
“Check your robes.” Confused the Gryffindor started to pat on his robes, after a moment he looked up and took his wand out from the front pocket.
“Yeah, I’m okay.” He smiled at the Slytherin, who smiled back and went back to packing. Observing the blond, he made a decision, this Holidays he either will get a boyfriend or will have to get rid of some very strong feelings.
“Since we both have nightmares I thought that we could help each other. We could wake each other up and maybe try to comfort the other.” For a moment Draco thought that Harry will laugh at him, the fact that Draco could hear that his voice was shaky didn’t bust his confidence. But when he looked up Harry was actually smiling at him.
“I know that you are nervous, but you don’t have to, the war ended and all of us know that you only wanted to protect your family. Draco, I forgive you.” He could felt as the nervousness in him lessen and he relaxed more into the hug.
This time he had to wait for two whole lessons for the Gryffindor's revenge. When he arrived at Potions Harry was already sitting in his usual spot. The boy looked a little dishevelled as if he ran to the class, this especially put Draco on high alert. In all his pink glory Draco carefully made his way to his seat, even though after inspecting his seat nothing looked out of place, he was still wary.
Malfoy’s breathing slowly picks up, but the boy speaks anyway. “It wasn’t a curse. The cane is cover in some potion that makes wounds heal slower.” He hesitates and Harry almost doesn’t hear the next words that leave his mouth. “The last time he used it my wounds didn’t heal for a month”
“Yeah. I just…” the boy in front of him looked nervous and Draco wondered how could he face Voldemort and still have difficulties when talking to him. The silence stretched between them and Draco was afraid that Harry going to keep whatever is Happening inside when the boy all but shouts his question. “Do you have plans over the holidays?”
Today Harry and he were left to their own devices, while Hermione dragged Ron to another museum. Draco suspected that the red-head secretly enjoyed the museum trips and his reluctance was a ploy to annoy Hermione, but he decided not to share his observation with the witch. Since the weather wasn’t as hot as the day before the two of them decided to go sightseeing. Draco was surprised at how easily Harry was able to navigate the place. All the narrow lanes made Draco confused, but he was sure that the Gryffindor could safely take them back to the hotel from any place in the city.
Suddenly Harry remembered how good Draco is at charms. April Fool’s Day was in two weeks and Harry realised that Draco had played him. The Slytherin was smiling at him now, a mischievous glint could be seen in his expression and Harry now knew that maybe winning will be harder than he thought.
“If you up for tea Harry is still downstairs with Teddy and I’m sure that it will make you feel a little bit better. You can never go wrong with tea.” Draco didn’t know how thirsty he was until he heard tea
“Draco breath. I promise you that neither Ron nor Hermione hated you. Ron helped me dress today, he was the one that suggested that you help me with buying new clothes.”
“If you like you can sit on the couch. I will talk to you in a moment okay?” The man’s tone was careful as if he was worried that Draco would break. He wasn’t wrong, but Draco still felt weird being this easy to read. He nodded and moved to sit on the couch.
“Harry, so nice to see you. Come in, Draco will be down in a bit, he had a taught morning, but everything is all right now.” Andromeda smiled at him and handed Teddy to him.
Draco was exhausted, he couldn’t stop thinking about Harry holding him in his arms. The image of them cuddled up together hadn’t left his mind since yesterday and sitting next to Harry on the Hogwarts express wasn’t helping.
After a quick trip to the new dorm and a short chat with Hagrid during which Harry promised that he will visit next week, he all but run back towards The Great Hall. Draco wasn't there yet, so he tried the door, but it being closed, Harry started to pace the hallway. He knew that it was stupid and McGonagall would never be a threat but he couldn’t get Draco’s shaking form out of his head.
“Nonsense Draco. Stay as long as you need to” She still didn’t look at his face, and he knew that she will do it sooner or later.
Minerva looked at the two teenagers in her office and she hated that even after all they’ve been through they still cannot catch a break. They reminded her so much of her earlier pupils. Sirius Black and James Potter the boys that always brought trouble, the boys who she couldn’t save. This time she will do anything in her power to change the outcome. She will not allow for any more death on her watch.
“He upset you. I don’t want to see you upset.” He wondered if he was exposing himself too much, but Draco only smiled.
“Oh, call me Minerva. I am sure that Harry already informed you that Horace’s employment terminated this year.” Draco knew, exactly where this conversation was leading, and he was surprised that it took her so long to ask him. “And I know that your job currently consists of researching and developing medical potions which makes you a perfect candidate for a potion professor.”
“Well, Hermione wouldn’t be that bad if she learned how to season. You, on the other hand, are helpless. Honestly, I don’t understand how you avoided Molly’s cooking lessons.” Harry was full-on laughing at the expression that his friend was sending him.
When he entered Draco was laying on his bed, face down. Harry didn’t know how to start this conversation but after a moment of contemplation, he decided that waiting is not going to do any good.
That night in their room Draco showed Harry his small sketchbook. Harry was surprised, but Draco quickly explained that his parents never knew that he had it. The drawings were good, but the blond insisted that they could be better if he had some time for practice, but for the past 3 years he couldn’t draw and now the only thing that he can think about drawing is the war.
“I will be okay.” He wanted to laugh, of course, his father used a curse that was this dangerous. “I would like the tea before a healing charm, please”
“Well, then it’s the high time you watch one. I think you will like it. As for what you said about your family, they may be blood purists, but I believe that you quitted, or am I mistaken?” Harry's voice was playful and Draco hated that this made him defensive.
“But you still love me.” Even though this was a statement Draco felt a need for Harry’s reassurance.
Harry exaggerates his breathing hoping that Malfoy will follow. After a few minutes, he notices that the boy in front of him relaxes slightly. “Better?”
“The street light? It’s an indicator that shows when it is safe to cross the street.” Even though this was most likely the 10
“I – yeah. But please don’t call me Malfoy.” Harry just stares at the boy. “It just sounds too much as my father. I just need a break from it all.” Harry understands.
“Apparently they kissed because of the war nothing more. Luna figured out that she prefers to kiss girls, preferably redheads and Neville is still figuring his stuff out.”
“I care because I think that you were alone for a very long time and I know that you may think that you don’t deserve it, but please realize that you are just as much a victim of circumstances and choices that were not yours as me.” He paused and made sure that Draco was actually listening to him.” I care because when I look at you I don’t see a Death Eater or a bully, maybe once upon a time I did, but now I got to know you and I realized my mistake and I will make sure that you are okay.  If I am more or less okay and my life was as much out of my control as yours then I want to make sure that you will be okay too.” Harry noticed that Draco was frozen, his face did not show any emotions and for a second he was afraid that Draco will run from him.
The four of them slowly makes their way out of the castle wards where they apparate to muggle London. Draco hated the noise that the city makes. He didn’t care for the muggles, he never really did, but the noise made his head hurt. Another thing that bothered him about Muggle places was the smell of the cities. The air in the muggle cities always smells different, he got used to the clear air that he grown up with and now the slights change made him uneasy.
George rose his hands and started to touch his face after a moment he smiled and began to search the crowd. Soon his eyes settled on Pandora, he smiled and walked to her. When he reached her, Harry assumed that he held out his now invisible hand, she took it and soon George started to talk about developing a partnership. Harry smiled, their children were amazing every single member of their family was fantastic and so full of potential.
The style of the paintings was realistic and Draco loved it. He loved the colours and the use of contrast and the attention to details, maybe with practice, he could paint something so beautiful.
“Just be here with me, hold me and don’t let me break even more.” Harry kissed his forehead once again, then answer him in a very determined tone. “I can do this.”
“See I told you, they are great.” When she looked at Harry he was wearing the biggest smile she ever saw on him and without realising she smiled too.
“Thank you. You’re quite good too.” The Gryffindor lift his head and shoot Draco an annoyed look, which made him laugh.
When Hermione first heard about the idea she laughed at Harry, but after the initial shock worn off she convinced them to let her help with the preparation and with spreading of the news, which Harry knew that she was good at from the days of DA meetings. At first, he half expected her to try bully Draco into letting her co-teach, but when after the first class, during which Draco helped Hermione with perfecting one of the most complicated potions, she came to him and told him that she did learn something, he knew that she will let Draco do the teaching.
When he saw just how bad and resigned Malfoy looked, Harry started to feel guilty for his earlier doubts about Andromeda’s story.
To say that Harry was nervous was an understatement. Logically he knew that Draco and he are friends now and there’s nothing to be nervous about, but his brain wasn’t listening to the logic, so here he was sitting on his bed in only his trousers thinking about what should he wear. He felt like every teenager in films before they had a big date, only he was meeting a friend.
“Sorry. Hi, how are you?” When he looked up he noticed that Andromeda was smiling at him, he felt a warm growing in his chest. Draco wondered if this is how a real family should make one feel.
Harry took his hand and guided him to their table Neville following behind them. This time no one made a move to stop them.  The three of them sat down and Harry immediately put some food on Draco’s plate.
“Oh.” The boy in front of him smiled and moved closer towards Draco. “So, you are saying that I can kiss you again?”
“Do I really have to?” Draco always thought that Harry was crazy but now after the boy who lives spoke back to McGonagall Draco knew that Harry was not only crazy but also had a death wish.
Polish people please stay strong and know that I support you no matter what and if you ever want to talk don't hesitate!
Draco smiled and planted one more kiss on Harry’s face before he took Harry’s hand and pull him into the room. “Today is Valentine day, so I’ve decided to make it special. What do you think?” He watched as the disbelieve morphed into wonder and the boy who lived turned to the basket.
“I think he will forgive us when he discovers that he finally has a sibling.” He said after he calmed down.
The smile that was on his face fall and logically Draco knew that this question was coming but he was not ready to answer it. On one hand, he wanted to go back to Andromeda’s and sleep for a week, but on the other hand, he really wanted to stay with Harry, the boy couldn’t dress for shit and someone had to help him.
He averted his eyes and focus on Teddy, he was sure that Andromeda will want to talk to him about this, but he couldn’t do it today. She must have sensed this because a few minutes later she started to talk about dinner. This was one of the reasons why he already loved her more than his own mother even after so little time with her.
When he arrived Harry, Hermione and Ron were already waiting for him, he smiled and joined his friends.
