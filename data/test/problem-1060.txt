breeze ruffled his hair. He turned and made his way down the street, sighing
Harry sighed in relief. He certainly didn’t want his sex life laid bare for all to read.
Then there was the fact that Draco would constantly ask if Harry wanted to be inside him when they got intimate. He always said no, but figured there had to be something good about it for the older boy to want it so often.
Harry chastely kissed his lips before pushing Draco upright and taking a step back. His hands immediately went to work rubbing the knots from the blonde’s shoulders.
“Of course it didn’t Harry. You didn’t want to do it.” Draco said sympathetically. “When you actually want it, it’s supposed to feel amazing.”
Ever so slowly, the fingers deep inside his body began sliding in and out, quickly finding a comfortable pace for the younger of the two.
As before, it started vibrating followed by sparks and the twins’ voices.
“No.” He stated.
Naked and wet, Harry left the bathroom and waddled toward the large bed, unfortunately no longer a water bed because Harry hadn’t been able to get out of it by the time he hit his sixth month. He dried himself with his wand before crawling on top of the covers and falling asleep almost immediately.
“What happened, Harry? Why are you in the hospital-wing? And where’s Ron?” She asked in one breath. “I only found out you were here because Ferret-Face told me.” She added, her voice disdainful at the nickname.
Draco stilled immediately and pulled his mouth of off Harry, sucking forcefully as he went and eliciting a drawn out moan from him, despite the pain.
“Look at me, Harry.” He whispered.
Professor Dumbledore extracted a small knife from within his robes. “That’s not how a magical contract works. It needs a drop of your blood.” He stated.
“I know but I’ll cross that bridge when I get to it. Maybe by then he wouldn’t mind.” Harry said trying to convince himself more than Draco. The rest of the walk was spent in a surprisingly companionable silence.
“More, now.” Harry finally begged.
While applying the salve, Harry watched the bruises fade from purple to light greenish-yellow before he put his shirt back down.
“Everyone’s been so nice.” Harry noted vocally.
Just when Draco got to his feet, Harry retched right where he had been sitting.
The next two weeks felt like a year to Harry. He knew it was his own fault though because he was doing exactly what Draco had told him not to do: watching the clock.
“No one is going to punish you, not even if you still belonged to my family.” He said as he pulled the house elf off the floor.
Crossing his arms angrily, Draco replied, “Yes, I do. She’s the same mind-healer Harry had when he was sixteen. One of our daughters is named after her. He knows and trusts Emma. She’ll come. Just get her,
“Tastes like cotton candy.” He said as he licked his lips.
“I suppose. I mean, if you want to be.” He said blissfully.
“W-wait” Scorpius cried. The older boy complied immediately, not wanting to scare or harm the boy during what was obviously his first time.
Now that Ron was gone, there was nothing stopping them from being together. But they didn’t seem to do anything any differently. They spent two of their meals in Draco's room and one in the Great Hall to spend time with their friends. A few people seemed to notice the increased amount of time the two boys were together but it wasn’t enough to get people to really care. They were grateful for this.

With a frown, Draco replied, “I’m not sure if I should say. I probably shouldn’t have said what did. Like I said, I don’t want to upset you.”
Two Identical sets of green flecked, gray eyes, one framed in blonde hair and the other in black, stared up at the two men.
can’t do anything right either. And I swear our children are the spawn of the devil or at least have some Weasley in them because— fuck that hurt.” He was cut off when Harry started working out a particularly large knot just below his right shoulder blade.
It was silent for some time as Draco couldn’t quite figure out how to react to Harry’s attitude.
As the kiss became more heated, Harry used his hold on Draco to pull them as close together as they could get. His hands moved down from the middle of the blonde’s back to grip his arse and pushed their groins together so Draco could feel just how much he wanted him.
“Of course.” Ron replied.
“I have a little while yet.” Draco replied. “Madam Pomfrey went to make sure breakfast gets sent up here for us, well you anyway. She’ll be back in a minute. Then she wants to check you over again.”
“No.” Harry’s reply was clipped.

“Actually, we uh… we broke up.” Harry explained. “She wanted the famous Harry, not the Harry I really am.”
“When?”
Emma and Lily were looking up at her in awe. “Wow!” They exclaimed together.
Harry gave her a pat on the head. “Go play.”
After several minutes of dueling tongues, Harry pulled back and they just gazed at each other. Draco brushed a few strands of hair out of Harry's face and caressed his cheek, smiling softly.
“T-twins?”
Harry finally turned to look at the man he was being forced to marry. “Something like that.”
“You’re the one that wanted to know what it was like to carry a child.” Harry said as he slowly pumped his finger in and out of the blonde’s ass.
Fingers snapping in front of his

opening his mouth just enough for the spoon to pass through.
When Harry came back around to the other side of the couch, the blonde was still standing on his tiptoes. “Why are you standing like that?”
Harry nodded and replied with a small, “Yeah.”
As you know, Christmas Holiday starts next week and I was hoping we could get together some time then since I will be staying in the castle. But if you’re going home, that’s fine too.
“We have?” Draco asked, confused.
Feeling calmer and a little more confident now, Draco replied, “Harry's going to come live with us in August.”
With the covers up to his chin,

Draco leaned forward and put his mouth by Harry's ear. “You like that?” He panted.
Unfortunately, Draco had to admit,
Still smiling, Draco stood from the couch and held out a hand to help Harry up. “Why don’t we leave the rest of your mess for later and take a bath?” He suggested, already leading the shorter boy toward their bathroom.
There was a brief pause before Draco closed the space between them by bringing their lips together in a kiss. Harry stood there in stunned silence, trying to process what his school rival was doing to him.

“And you’re sure Dumbledore can’t make me stay there once I’ve turned seventeen?” Harry asked skeptically.
“Scorpius, what’s wrong?” Draco asked, clearly worried.
Harry whispered as the pair made their way down the street.
“Y-yeah.” He replied, just above a whisper.
“I’m not ready to leave.” Draco stated, fully clothed once more.
“So did I.” Harry responded quietly. “But that was also when I thought I was dreaming or that you were a delusion I had created as a coping mechanism.”
After some soaking and splashing, Harry got up the nerve to strip completely.
It was nearly an hour later that a much more painful contraction ripped through him and brought him back to consciousness. When it was over, he was panting and clutching at his distended stomach, silently praying for it to stop.
Harry used a charm to check his temperature and a moment later, a wispy green number
Draco swallowed his bite. “If you finish that, then yes.” He replied and picked up a new piece.
“Of course, sir. Just let me change into something more suitable. I’ll be there momentarily.” Madam Pomfrey replied.
Thirty minutes later, and the brunette was hardly more than halfway through the pile. He considered taking a break at that point, but he quickly changed his mind because he just wanted to get it done and over with.
“What kind of person do you think I am?” Harry asked as he angrily crossed his arms.
Draco helped Harry to his feet once he was sure he wasn’t going to throw up again. “I don’t care if it is ‘just a bug’. You’ve been like this for almost a week. You’re going to see Madam Pomfrey tomorrow.” He ordered.
Oliver looked skeptically at the teen. “He’s kidding right?”
Once the car was off, Harry handed his keys to the other. “Would you mind getting the door for me?” He asked as tiny droplets started hitting the windshield.
“Oh, I’m sorry.” She said.
As the twins giggled and skipped
Draco looked at the tiny bundle in Remus' arms and then back at Sirius. “It might not be a huge deal to you or me, but I’m sure Harry feels terrible about it. I accidentally upset him earlier and I think part of it was because he didn’t have any other names.”
“The poor boy, after everything he’s gone through his best friend turns on him like this. He’s going to need rigorous therapy with a mind-healer after the trauma sets in.” The old man said.
“I have one more question.” He seethed. “Was he a virgin before you betrayed him?”
Harry took a few deep breaths to calm himself down before continuing. “That was almost a year ago and I haven’t even attempted a serious relationship since then. I’ve certainly had my share of one-nighters, with both men and women, but nothing ever came of them.

“I could leave you here, but I

“He’s my best friend. When we’re around other people he acts like the normal Ron. But when we’re alone and he’s angry…” He trailed off and started crying again.
“I should hit you again for being dumb enough to have sex without protection. Even a condom…” Oliver seethed.
“Mum, can you take Lily, Emma, and Lyra to get a snack?” Obviously, no one actually thought they’d be hungry, especially with one of them currently asleep, but the three of them were still far too young for a story such as the one Draco was about to tell.
“Come on, there’s nothing to be
“Now, if you’ll excuse me. I think I’d like to be in better company than the likes of you bigots.” Draco said as he stood from his seat and tossed his napkin down. He then turned to Harry, all nastiness leaving him to be replaced by bliss.
“Shh.” Madam Pince reprimanded.
Life before vanquishing the Dark Lord had been bad and Harry thought there was no possible way it could have gotten any worse. Apparently, he had been very, very,
After covering his shaft in lube, the blonde leaned over his raven-haired boyfriend and gave him a gentle kiss. With one hand he pushed Harry's legs open a little wider and with the other, he lined himself up with the stretched pucker waiting for him.
“Really?” Harry suddenly piped up. “I’m not saying they should get married, but I’m surprised you aren’t all for it, love. You’re the traditional one.”
“Ok.” Harry said meekly. He felt numb and at this point he probably would have jumped off the astronomy tower if he was asked too.

“Well, where’s Ron?” She asked next.

“That is an excellent question.” The headmaster started. “Let’s see… I think it was just over three centuries ago now that the heads of several pureblood families got together to discuss our slowly dwindling numbers. I believe the Potters and the Malfoys were among them actually.
“That sounds like a great idea. What made you think of it?” Draco asked as he opened the door to his room.
“That’s fine.” Harry responded.
The two of them watched as the baby tried to wiggle his way forward to get closer to his parents. After a few failed back and forth rocks, Scorpius turned his attention to flipping onto his back again. Once he was face up, he reached out toward Harry and giggled at the upside down image.
“No, mum, we’re fine.” He vaguely
Harry tried to answer but he started vomiting again. This time it was accompanied by blood, and quite a bit of it.
conditioning assaulting him immediately.
“No, definitely don’t want that.”
“Go!”
“24.” Ron snarled. “And he deserved it every single fucking time! He gets everything he wants without trying and I never get anything!”
For the first minute or two, Draco moved at a moderate pace, not wanting to hurt the other boy. Harry could feel every inch sliding in and out of him and it was the better than he could have possibly imagined.
Draco's thrusting became erratic as Harry tightened and convulsed around him. He groaned against Harry's neck as he erupted inside him and collapsed on top of him once he was spent.
“Yes.” The younger blonde man replied through a forced smile.
Harry spent most of the next day shut up in his room trying to decide what to wear. Several times he contemplated just answering the door naked, considering he was going to end up that way anyway, but he didn’t think the neighbors would appreciate it as much as Draco. Most of the concealment charms had been lifted after the war and other spells put in their place so that the muggles wouldn’t be confused as to why there was suddenly a Number 12 there.

asked the teenager with a raised eyebrow.
“Dad!” Draco shouted after he finished reading Harry's letter. It had been sitting on his desk for over a week now but he’d been too afraid and too busy wallowing in self-pity to open it. Only innate curiosity of the unknown finally convinced him to read it.
After a few minutes of rolling and grinding hips, Draco bit down lightly on Harry's neck. He arched off the bed and further into Draco's body as he gasped and spilled himself in his pants, shortly followed by the other.
“Tonks, what did I tell you about your hair?” The minister said before she could say a word.

around Draco’s neck, fearing he might fall.

Emma was still unsure but she smiled back anyway before running forward and giving him a hug. Scorpius returned the gesture. “I hope you feel better soon.” She said when she pulled back.
Ethan ran a hand over his head, but before he could reply, “Why not Potter-Malfoy?” Draco interjected.
“Fire whiskey.” Scorpius mumbled half-heartedly.
“I never knew any of that.” Harry said. “I mean, I assumed about the stretching because Ron
“I met Ron Weasley on… on my first day of school, on the train ride here.” Harry slowly started. “We were best friends for three years or at least… I thought we were.”
When he turned to look at the other door to the room, green eyes widen a bit when they landed on the person that woke him up. In a flash, images of long forgotten memories flitted through his brain and Harry was wide awake.

“What took you so long?” The raven-haired teen asked as a familiar, painful squeezing ripped through him once more.
“It was that bitch, Monica. I told
“Papa, stop moving.” The girl applying purple eye shadow to his eyes lids demanded.
Harry started to feel a familiar tightening in his balls and lower stomach. “I’m gonna come.” He gritted out.
After a while, Draco managed to pull Harry's mouth off of his but he had to continue fighting to keep him off. “Harry— Ha— Harr— Harry!”
“Nothing.” Harry mumbled as he turned even redder.
“I do hope that was a rhetorical question.”
A moment passed where Ethan fiddled with the bottle he’d retrieved from his bedside table. Suddenly, Scorpius felt a wet finger circling his virgin hole. He held his breath as the digit pushed passed the tight ring of muscle.
Nightmares had plagued Harry's mind for a while. He’d wake in a cold sweat, sobbing into his pillow. Once he was calm enough to walk, he’d get out of bed and quickly make his way to Draco's room. It only took three nights of this for Harry to start sleeping in his blonde boyfriend’s room instead of his dormitory.
“Just tell me.” Harry pleaded. “I don’t like people being on eggshells around me.”
“Um… no.” Harry said nervously and moved a little bit closer.
Draco hugged him back for a moment before the teary-eyed brunette sat up. “You have no idea what this means to me.” Harry said as he wiped his eyes before the tears could fall.
can n-not be James.” Harry stated, pointing in the general direction Madam Pomfrey had gone. “I already h-had a J-James and he was taken fr-rom me.”
Harry rolled onto his back and spread his legs apart to give Draco access to his most intimate place.
Green eyes closed and their owner held out his hands as well. A piece of fabric was placed in them. He felt it for a minute trying to figure out what it was but he had absolutely no idea what it could have been.
When they headed up for breakfast, they stopped in an alcove near the bottom of the stairs that went up to the entrance hall where they shared a last kiss just like every morning.
Harry smiled a little, eyes closed, and Draco took that as a yes.
“What the bloody hell was that, Malfoy?” He asked in a tone not nearly as harsh as he wanted it to be.
The teen sighed, not entirely knowing what to say. “Sort of, but not really.” He knew his answer was incredibly vague, but he wasn’t ready for

“Yeah, sure.” Harry replied sardonically.
“Over two years now.” Harry replied.
“Well I do. And I’d like to be able to kiss my boyfriend without wondering if he’s just thrown up or if I’m going to get sick too.” He responded and held Harry tighter.
“Draco, we’re in the library.” Harry said, though he didn’t try to move back to his own seat.
“Yes, of course,” Severus replied quickly. “Siri,” he whispered, “let’s give him some privacy so he can get them dressed.”
When Harry next awoke, it was to
“Make it quick.” It was followed by the loud footsteps of the large man making his way down the stairs.

With that, the pair took each other’s hand and made their way into the castle to start their last year as students.

With a small nod, she answered, “I
To say the ride to platform 9 ¾ seemed short would have been an understatement. Both teenagers had changed out of their school clothes, Draco into normal robes and Harry into muggle jeans and t-shirt, before the train had even left Hogsmeade.
Using his wand, he quickly removed Harry’s bindings. Next, he found the bathrobe that had been thrown across the room and got it onto the other man’s naked body.
In the sweets shop they took a look at all the usual candy and bought some for later. They also checked out a counter full of free samples of new products. When they left, their gold pouches were considerably lighter and Harry had a five pound block of fudge that Draco had bought him just because Harry had wondered how long it would take a single person to finish it.
Finally she stood up on slightly
Harry sighed in relief when he read that he wouldn’t have to testify. He wasn’t sure he would be able to face Ron again or if he’d be able to talk about in front of him and a bunch of other people he didn’t know. It wasn’t very hard to decide he wouldn’t be attending the hearing.
“You’re afraid… of being pregnant?” Harry guessed. Draco nodded and Harry tightened his hold around him. “Then why did you tell me you want to know what it’s like to have a baby?”
Draco chuckled. “And a moment ago you were in tears.”
Once in the house, Draco, followed
Ordinarily, the drive home took fifteen
The blonde man stared at Harry with narrowed eyes for a moment. “Fine.” He answered and stomped toward the passenger side.
Once he reached Draco though, he was too nervous to announce his presence. But he didn’t have to wait long for one of the other Slytherins to do it for him.
“Really?” Harry asked with a sniffle.
Severus smirked. It wasn’t the first time he’d played pool.
Hogsmeade weekend couldn’t come fast enough for either of them. Every minute seemed to last an hour, every hour seemed to last a day. By the time that Saturday came around, Harry was a nervous wreck.
Just then the lunch trolley rolled around. The boys bought themselves a few snacks to hold them over until dinner at the castle and after stuffing their faces, Harry felt decidedly better.
With deliberate slowness, the blonde pushed his finger the rest of the way in and then paused for a brief moment before sliding the appendage back out to spread the lubricant.
Harry nervously started biting his lip as he continuously glanced between Draco and the other three. He desperately wanted to just throw himself at the blonde but wasn’t sure if he’d be ok with it with them there.
Harry suddenly went red under

“I-I don’ wanna b-be alone.” He cried, burying his face in his hands.
When he sat down, the entire mattress rippled underneath of him, making him jump off in surprise. He then put a hand on it and pressed it up and down quickly. He could hear sloshing.
Draco chuckled and shouted, “Hurry
Harry crossed his arms and raised a brow. “And what exactly are you used to?”
“It was nice seeing you, Hagrid.” Harry said as they stepped off the bridge. He waved and they parted ways.
Ron eyed the vial warily. He had a vague idea of what it was and kept his mouth shut tight. There was no way he was saying a word except by force.
“Whatever you want to do is fine with me. But I was thinking that we could just get something to eat at The Three Broomsticks and then just kind of walk around and buy stuff.” Draco explained.
Harry looked from his husband’s retreating back to his son’s confused face.
Harry also started noticing some changes to his body. One being that his stomach was already starting to show a bit because of how skinny he was to start with. He was also very tired and had to pee a lot. It wasn’t fun. But it would be worth it in the end.

“Okay. Okay, you can stay. But one word or action I don’t like and you’re gone. Do you understand me?” The blonde asked, slightly irate.
“Here, you’d better take this now.” He said as he uncorked the vial and handed it to Harry.

they finally stopped rolling across the ground, Harry found him self unable to
After a few minutes of relative silence, Harry flipped over so that he was facing the blonde. “Can I ask you something?” He asked.
Once the nub had been thoroughly molested, Draco stilled his finger and looked up at Harry. “You ok?” He asked softly, just to be sure.
Harry stared unseeingly at the child he was still holding. Tears pricked his eyes and silently began sliding down his cheeks.
Harry turned his head so that his

“Yeah.” Harry grinned. “Let’s do the baby pile first.”
smiled breathtakingly before pulling Harry flush against his chest and molding
“He’s going to be so happy.” The blonde man stated with a large grin as they made their way down the hall, barely paying any attention to where he was walking.
“Come on, it’s time for presents.” Draco insisted and nipped the shell of Harry’s ear.
A moment later, he felt a warm splash on his bare feet. He glanced down and saw the other boy’s hand on his own cock, milking every last drop from it.
At St. Mungo’s, Harry and Sirius carried Draco through the floo into the welcome area, Severus following close behind.
Harry grinned happily. “I’d like that. I’d really like that.”
The woman in question came into view and replied, “I was calling for assistance.” Behind her stood a familiar figure in black.
In the dim light, he could barely make out a form huddled in the corner. The young Malfoy pulled out his wand and cast Lumos. He was surprised, to say the least, at whom he was looking at.
Draco shrugged. “I said it was the
“He seemed nice. What did he want?”
Madam Pomfrey immediately took Harry to his reserved bed and lowered the stretcher onto it before vanishing the unneeded item.
Harry finally askes Draco something he's been wondering for over four months now.
The younger blonde man turned to his own son as he reached into his pocket. “Scorpius, I know you’ve only driven the car around the block before, but I want you to drive your sisters and Lucius to the house. Be. Extremely. Careful.” He handed the keys over the teen.
“Nope.”

“None.”
The dark-haired boy turned his head to see Draco sitting on the side of his bed, holding his hand.
“Anyway, what I really wanted to talk about was how we need a more permanent form of birth control besides potions and spells. Both are too easily forgotten or overlooked.” The blue-eyed man explained.
“What made you remember?” Draco asked.
Harry leaned up and planted a kiss on the other’s lips. “Of course, you are.” He said with a grin. They took each other’s hand and headed up to the infirmary together.
remained, including: all of the Weasleys, except Bill and his family, Hermione,
Harry tried to smile back but with the way he was feeling, he couldn’t and Draco clearly saw it written on his face. It took everything the blonde had not to hug him again because if he did, he probably wouldn’t be able to let go.
Draco had the decency to turn red. “Yeah, that does sound like young me.”
That last thought gave him an idea. Knowing it would be the only way for him to get to the infirmary until Draco came back from class in an hour and a half; Harry called out, “Dobby.”
“That’s why we’ll be using magic.” Draco
“No, you can have it.” Harry said absentmindedly.
Harry set aside his cup before picking up the small boy and setting him on the table in front of him. “Well, why do you want to know?” He asked, toying with his son.

“It’s necessary though.” Harry sighed.
“You’re glowing, Harry.” A fifth year Ravenclaw girl said in passing. This pattern continued until the two boys were settled into a carriage.
“Well it
“J-James.” He repeated. Everything came flooding back and he nearly dropped the still unnamed infant.
“Me neither.” Harry brought his hand to Draco’s and waited for the familiar bumping against his palm.
“That’s it, baby.” Draco lightly bit the side of Harry’s neck and the latter screamed his name as his cock spurted its load into the bed beneath the pair.
Once again the line went dead.

“You know, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think you were a five year old girl right now.” Draco teased.
“Not tonight, little love.” Harry bent and kissed his son’s forehead. “But definitely tomorrow.”
“That’s not very likely to happen. There

“What’s that?” Harry asked.

Harry looked at him in confusion. “We do?”

“Really? Can we open them?” Harry was suddenly excited.

Then, instead of taking the cream back and doing it herself, she ran a few diagnostic spells on his torso to make sure there was no internal damage. She seemed happy with the results so Harry didn’t worry about it.

After folding the blanket and setting on the change table, Draco moved to the crib to give his son a goodnight kiss. The parents then whispered goodnight and I love you to the now sleeping baby and Harry laid him in his crib.
“I didn’t even know you were gay.” It was the only thing Harry could think to say at the moment.
“Shh, shh, shh, shh. Yes, you can, Harry. I know you can.” Draco said as he knelt next to the bed to be eye level with Harry.
Harry's smile was sad now. He’d forgotten his friend as well but for completely different reasons. He hadn’t had the time to remember.
He slammed his fists down on the table. “I don’t know, alright?!”
Harry quickly poured the proper

Finally, he set the brunette on his feet and took a firm hold of each of his wrists. With a smirk the blonde quietly said, “Well
I just want to say that we love you Harry and you are still welcome here at any time. In fact, this summer you, Sirius, and Remus are going to come over so we can celebrate your birthday properly. Hermione is invited too, of course.
“He s-said it wouldn’t h-happen again, Harry. We got passed the first trimester th-this time. It wasn’t s-supposed to happen again.” Draco cried into his chest.
“I do.”
Slow, Harry finished the piece of toast and managed to eat half of another before the bell rang, signaling the start of class.
“Oh, Harry, that’s awful. Why didn’t you tell us?” She asked with slightly damp cheeks, having teared up during Harry’s narrative. Ron’s face was red with anger.
“So, you’re our new healer?”
“No, say it.”
“He told me once, like, the day we met. Wah… wuh… it started with a W. That’s all I can remember.”
“Me neither.” Harry added as he pulled his shirt over his head. They both looked down at the fabric stretched over his belly.
“Amazing.” Draco whispered in awe. “I’ve never felt a baby kick before.”
“Harry?” He called as he stuck his head in, but the dark-haired man was nowhere to be found.
“What about him?” The raven-haired man asked, bouncing the child in his arms slightly. “Does he have a name yet?”

“Hello, Harry.” Hagrid said, beaming down at him.
“Tired… sore.” Harry mumbled groggily.
“I suppose that’s something but I still don’t think you should do what he tells you to.” Draco said heatedly.

Unfortunately, I already made plans to go home for Christmas. Perhaps I could arrange to come back early and we could… explore each other further.
Now Harry could feel his release upon him, drawing closer and closer. His hips were being held down by Draco's hands with what had to be bruising force. And suddenly, it was gone.
Harry back to reality just before Mrs. Weasley turned to him. He gave Ginny a
He smirked triumphantly every time Harry sucked in his stomach when Draco pressed his tongue into the slit. When he’d run his tongue from the base to the tip, Harry would moan loudly, causing Draco to release a moan of his own.
“I said out!” The stern women said again. They both scrambled to collect their things before she could send it flying out the door without them.
I’ll take maternity leave. Happy?” Harry exasperatedly explained.
Narcissa gasped in shock and covered Elliot’s ears. “What do you mean Harry was attacked?”
“Emma said you’re sick. Are you?” She whispered with wide eyes.
“He found out.” Harry said through his crying. “He was making fun of me, saying I was getting fat. Then he poked me and I guess he noticed what it was. He asked if I was pregnant. I said no but everyone knows I’m not a good liar.”
As you can see, things are taking a darker turn.
Harry shook his head harshly, interrupting his friend’s words. “Draco already-”
The blonde man pulled a pamphlet from his pocket. “There’s this muggle procedure that’s picked up in popularity in our world. They call it a vasectomy.”

The blonde grabbed Ron's out stretched arm, bent it behind his back, and put him in a head lock.
propped up on his hand.
Not only that, but the morning sickness that had gratefully left him only a week before school ended, came back full force after three days of being there. Harry didn’t know if it had just been a short reprieve or if it had something to do with his surroundings that brought it back.
The man quickly changed the girl’s nappy. “I suppose I could do without having to change those anymore.” He grumbled to himself as he sat in the rocking chair to soothe Olivia back to sleep.
“Draco! Oh Merlin, Draco! I need to come!” Harry tried to wiggle one of his hands free but Draco's grip was just too strong.

With watery eyes, the brunette looked at the red brick separating them from the muggle side of King’s Cross.
Everything came into focus as Harry slid his glasses on at the same moment that Snape stopped next to him, an oddly gentle smile on his face.
“Of course. This is my family too, Draco.” The older blonde replied.
Draco gave Harry a soft smile. “It’s ok. I needed a shower anyway. But even if I didn’t,” he lifted Harry’s chin, “It still wouldn’t matter. Besides, I’m your husband, it’s my job to comfort you in whatever way you need.”
Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, has found true love at last in the form of one Eric Harrison, 28. Not much is known about the wealthy squib, as the happy couple has yet to be interviewed. But Mr. Harrison gladly provided us with a summary of his relationship with the young Potter.
“Yeah.” Harry gave his husband a wide smile. “This is James.”
Apparently she had snuck away from the rest of the family to say good night to
“Go ahead.” Draco replied.
job. Honestly, why had Harry hired such a slut to work at a daycare center?
“Dobby!” Harry croaked, catching the blabbering creature’s attention. “I need you to get Madam Pomfrey.” He was infinitely grateful that he was between contractions at the moment.
The brunette sighed. “Draco, what part of ‘today is Scorpius’ birthday’ do you not understand?”
The boy pocketed the keys and took
“Here, let me just…” Ethan scooted behind Scorpius, placing a leg on either side of the smaller body. Before getting started, he took a quick swig of the whiskey still on his nightstand. He offered the bottle once more, but was turned down.

Harry didn’t know what he was going to do. He was home alone with a small child and his hands were currently bound. But before he had any time to really dwell on that issue, his phone rang. His head snapped up toward the sound and he saw ‘Draco <3’ displayed on the screen.
“It’s on now” He said after a minute or two and launched himself at Harry.
“You are such a girl, Harry.” Draco
“Harry is coming with me, that’s what going on here.” Draco explained without looking away from the mop of dark hair resting on his chest. “We’ll just get his things and be on our way.”
“Well go on, ring the bell.” Draco nudged his son forward.
Harry gave a sly smirk and replied, “No.” Both boys immediately deflated. “I thought about it… but then I remembered that’s where you two little monsters came from.” He ruffled their already messy hair affectionately.
“Do you remember when your birth canal began forming, the conversation we had?” She asked sternly.
“Good night.” Harry replied a little sadly as he too laid down facing away from his bedmate for the night.
Time wasn’t the only factor that contributed to Harry's ability to sleep peacefully. Exhaustion was another big part of it, and not from over-studying for final exams as one would expect. No, now that Harry had crossed the line to being a
“What does it matter to you anyway?” Ron asked as he struggled to get out of Draco's grip. “It’s none of your business.”
The blonde man smiled again. “I know you don’t.” He sighed and finally replied, “James.”
that his bladder decided it needed emptying. He sighed as he forced his way up
“Wow. This is where you live?” Harry asked as he walked in, mouth agape.
A familiar head of bushy, brown hair followed by red entered the room.
One long hallway later and Draco
Sirius stuffed his hands in his pockets and sulked but remained quiet. He knew Remus was right, even if he didn’t like it.
Draco dropped his trunk once they reached the drive. “Fine, my own mother scares me.” He answered, flailing his arms a bit as they waited for an empty carriage to pull up.
Draco nodded and stood from his kneeling position to sit on the edge of the bed. “He’s so small.” He commented once he had the infant safely encased in his arms.
“Alright. Just… let me put some pajamas on.” Draco said.

“I think we’re done for today.” Emma, no longer smiling, said once he’d finished telling that part of the story.
“I told you it feels good.” Draco breathed in his ear, Harry eagerly nodding in agreement.

Ron's face reddened in anger the
Forgetting everything he’d learned and practiced with Madam Pomfrey, Harry began to panic and hyperventilate, suddenly wishing he’d gone to stay in the hospital wing. As his breathing sped up, his head started to swim from the lack of oxygen and he fell back onto his pillow, unconscious.
Draco continued in such a fashion and buried his face in her hair at the side of her neck. Harlot’s pleasured screams were muffled by the pillow beneath her. Her breathing hitched as he began placing love bites on her skin. And suddenly, something gave the young man pause. Hadn’t he been pressed against her hair?
While they waited, Draco and Madam
“But daddies and papas are supposed to love each other just like mommies and daddies.” The young boy stated.
Both sated, the pair laid together in companionable peace.
“I just said my head hurts, Potter, geez.”
“If you need anything, my room is right across from his.” Draco acknowledged him with a nod before turning his full attention back to the boy on his lap.
“I read right through your little act. You’re scared.” Draco stated softly.
Once their breathing and heart rates returned to normal, Harry yawned loudly and snuggled as close to Draco as he could possibly get.
asked after feeling Elliot’s forehead.
“Harry, are you ok?” Draco asked when he saw the tears.
“Yeah?” Ethan asked, then said, “I’ve wanted you pretty much since we met. But I had to wait until you were sixteen.”
The blonde man turned to take his leave, but a thought occurred to him. “I should also probably mention this so you aren’t surprised by it later…”

Papa.” He whispered.
Madam Pomfrey had wanted him there since Christmas Day, but Harry adamantly refused. Instead, there was an entire corner set up and reserved just for him for when the time came.
The blonde had desperately wanted to argue but he held his tongue because he didn’t want to upset Harry anymore.
Draco laughed lightly at Harry's antics, tilted his head up, and crashed their mouths together. Their tongues immediately delving into each other, exploring and tasting.
“Are you bleeding this time?” He asked softly.
A moment later, it was gone as Harry cast a glamour over himself.
A thick silence spread between them.
Harry jerked awake from the sudden screaming. In his sleep fogged mind he couldn’t quite comprehend what he heard or if it had even been real. Then there was a thump from the bathroom. He sat up so he could see over the footboard of the bed and saw his husband’s prone form on the tiled floor.
“Now then,” The witch started, her excitement rising. “When’s the big day?”
“Well, I guess the burning question is: How did you two meet?” She scratched something down on her parchment.
“Why don’t I take him?” Emma suddenly piped up.
“Shut up!” Draco screamed. Then he stomped on the side of Ron's head, knocking him out cold.
“Who are you?” He finally asked the question he had been wanting to ask for weeks now. All she did was smirk, grab his tie, and yank him forward into another heart stopping kiss.
“Feeling better?” Draco asked as he finished with the cream.
Instead of answering, a hand grabbed the back of a dark head and smashed their lips together in a heated kiss. One of Harry's hands moved to cup the other’s cheek and the other went to cover Draco's hand that was still splayed across his stomach.
As they made their way back to the school, faces red from the cold and smiling, Draco suddenly realized that his boyfriend wasn’t walking next to him anymore.
“He’s the one who’s been helping me get through all of this, Hagrid.” Harry gently said to his first real friend.
“Uh… yeah.” He replied and looked away from her to stare blankly at the table. That was probably the best he’d be able to do for now.
Just as the blonde girl was about to push the door open, Scorpius brought his arms up to rest on the toilet seat and began sobbing into them. The sight scared Emma. She’d seen any and all emotions from the sulky teen but she’d never seen him outright cry before.
Harry rested his forehead on the blonde’s collarbone. “Fine.” He grumbled and Draco squeezed him a little.

“I was a snotty, little, elitist brat.” The boy in question answered.
“Calm down, Scor.” James said to his twin.
The conversation Harry's aunt and cousin were having floated in through the door that Eric had never bothered to close when he left. He allowed the sound to go in and out of focus in his mind until he heard the doorbell ring.
“My mind-healer.” Harry replied as he got comfortable in Draco's embrace. He quickly explained his session schedule to them.
“Don’t open without me.” A still naked Harry whined as he rushed back to the bed. He climbed in and pulled the silver comforter over himself.
The older of the two grabbed a remote from next to the whiskey bottle and clicked on his stereo. Pounding rock immediately began playing.
Harry started to whine. “But—”

As they continued to make out, Harry could feel a hard cock against his hip. His mental interest rose, but, unfortunately, he had to wait for his body to catch back up. He wanted to feel that cock inside him and now that his nerves had worn off, he was getting impatient.
Finally, after a short stare down,
“What’s going on?” Though the words were muffled by the cloth in his mouth, apparently it was clear enough.

“Mr. Malfoy, be useful and keep applying this. I need to get you a pain relieving potion. The one thing this salve doesn’t do is make the pain go away.” She said softly.
Draco sneered at his husband. “What’s there to talk about? He went against us and now he deserves to be punished.”
“You look adorable today, Harry.” Draco noted as he set the dark-haired boy back on his feet.
kid did that to dad?” Scorpius looked like he might cry as he spoke. “And why had I never heard of him?”
After the two young men took a minute to gain their breath, Draco asked, “So, was it what you expected, Potter?”
“Does it feel like I’m for real?” He asked, thrusting his hard-on against the smaller boy beneath him.
Harry was warily looking between his godfather and his boyfriend. Sirius had leaned forward and was staring intently at Draco as he spoke. When he finished, Sirius continued to stare for moment.
Since he didn’t have the time for that, he used a few well known spells to

Scorpius stared down at the slice of pepperoni pizza already on his plate. He hadn’t eaten since breakfast and had thrown-up twice since then, but he wasn’t feeling particularly like eating. He knew he had to eat though, for the baby’s sake, if not his own.
Draco chuckled lightly. “What else would I call you?”
With his head on the blonde’s chest, Harry snuggled as close as he could get into Draco's side and breathed, “Why does the bad stuff always happen to me?” It was a good twenty minutes later before either of them spoke again.
The younger man continued, “I’ve been happily married for 15 years and Scorpius here is the oldest of our four, going on five, children.”
Draco wandered into the aforementioned room and sat down on a brown leather sofa. It was a few minutes before Harry came back, throwing his damp jacket over the back of a chair and dropping into it.
“Actually, that was the second time we met.” Harry interjected.
“Harry.” Madam Pomfrey said, gaining both of their attention. “Just like before, I need you to push on the next contraction.”
“Hey, where’re you going?” He asked quietly.
“Harry, calm down.” The woman said soothingly. “Our world is different than the muggle world. Men are able to get pregnant. It doesn’t happen that often but it does happen.” She explained.
Draco didn’t need to hear anything more than that. He rushed passed the medi-witch and to the other end of the room.
“And what am I supposed to do?” Scorpius asked, sullen as ever.

wrapped his tie around her hand. “And you are a Sexy Slytherin.”
laugh, Harry!”
“Potter, don’t sneak up on me like that.” He said angrily and ignored the fact that the naked body behind him was making him hard.
She wasn’t holding a baby and they couldn’t hear the cries of a newborn. The worst possible outcome jumped to the forefront of Draco's mind and his heart began hammering in his chest.
“Sorry.”
Ron’s face reddened in anger and he slapped Harry across the face. “It’s time for you to shut the fuck up, I think.” He pulled the gag back up from around Harry’s neck into his mouth.
“He hates me, doesn’t he?” Scorpius sniffled, on the verge of tears again.
Draco laughed and Harry noticed,
“Laugh, point, stare, talk. Maybe worse…” The dark-haired boy trailed off.
“Dra- Malfoy… are you-” Harry started, but was cut off when a hot, wet mouth descended upon his burgeoning flesh. “Holy! Fucking! Shit!”

building and were now in an air-conditioned car.
“Ok.” Harry said sadly. He really didn’t want Draco to leave right now but he did have to go to class. He watched the blonde leave the hospital wing and just stared at the door for a few minutes after he left.
Harry kicked out at his attacker, using the other’s weight and current lack of balance against him.
She said as she stood far closer to him that what was polite or appropriate for
“It’s not a big deal.” Sirius cut in. “Lots of parents have trouble naming their kids. If what I heard from relatives is correct, my brother was home from the hospital for an entire week before my parents picked a name for him.”
Harry was about to jerk away or push the other off of him, when the hand on his knee suddenly slid up his leg and cupped his crotch. When it started rubbing him through his jeans, he felt absolutely mortified that his body reacted.
Lucius stood from the table and laid a hand on his only son’s shoulder. “Of course, Draco.”
Draco started to walk away when two hands grabbed his arm and the girl pressed
“Conceive?” The young brunette asked. “Conceive what? What is going on?”
“Nothing’s gotten into me. I just feel really good today.” He said as the trio headed down to breakfast.
“Of course, sir.” The healer left in one direction, Draco went the other, heading toward the waiting room where their family was congregated.

Carefully, Harry slipped his arms under Draco's knees and behind his back and slid up the wall into a standing position. He shifted his hold a bit before stepping out of the shower and into their adjoined bedroom. He laid his lover on the right side of the bed and then walked around to his side.
Harry slumped back onto the bed and felt relief flood every cell in his body.
“He’s a what, now?” Harry asked, eyes going wide with shock. “A muggle?” He then started giggling in a slightly hysterical matter. “I’m sorry, Scorpius. I know it’s not funny, but you just seem to have a horrible combination of circumstances.”
Draco moaned into the kiss and gripped Harry's hips so he could lead him backwards toward the poor excuse of a bed.
“At least you tried.” He said, glancing up from the blonde’s chest.
Draco quickly took off his robe. “Here.” He said as he wrapped it around Harry's naked waist. “Is that better?” He asked as he started to soothingly rub the other’s back.
It was August 29
Harry sighed. “Yeah, I know. But I’d
“I hate him.” Ron stated simply.
“Harry, can we take a break?” Draco whined.
“Everything upsets me and I don’t know why.”
“My name?” She supplied. “Yes. And I’m still honored that you would name a child after me.”
“On the left.” He immediately replied.
Draco then took off running toward the second floor girls’ lavatory, as it was closest.
After an agonizing wait, the curtain disappeared and he jumped up from the bed he was sitting on to stand next to Harry. ‘I’m turning soft.’ The blonde though.
Harry’s glazed, jade eyes looked into Draco’s silvery-blue ones for a moment before the pair continued their journey to the fireplace.

“I think it’s time to go inside.”
was closer to their level and made a spinning motion with his hand. “Turn
“Is your homework done for tomorrow?” He asked. Harry nodded. “Good. Because you’re going to bed now.”
“You are too.” He said back.
“This…” Draco laid a hand on Harry’s pregnant stomach. “…is mine.” He then turned his attention to Harry. “He can’t marry you if you’re already pregnant with someone else’s child.” He explained. “It took forever to find because I was looking in marriage law books and I barely found this as a side-note in a pregnancy law book for witches.”
“Do you want me to tell Daddy?” Emma whispered nervously.
“So how far along is that?” The pregnant boy asked as he pulled the gown back down.
Harry followed slowly behind them and went to stand at his mark to wait for the music to begin with no small amount of trepidation.
Harry began sobbing uncontrollably.
“Sort of.” Ethan replied as he stood back up. “We actually thought about naming her after you, dad, but that’s sort of off the table. We had talked about the name Olivia if it was a girl though. What do you think?”

The teen understood what his dad meant and managed a slight twitch of the lip in amusement. It was followed by a soft sob.
“Awwww. Why not?” The younger boy asked.
“Why?” He asked next.

Ordinarily, the little girl would have taken offense at the use of her twin’s name, but with how upset her brother was, she ignored it. “Are you ok, Scorpius?” She quietly asked as she stepped a little closer.
“I like everything you do to me.” Scorpius replied breathily.
Harry sighed as he folded up the letter. It had been nearly three years since he had gotten his godfather back and at times, he sort of forgot about him. He still wasn’t entirely used to having a family that loved him and cared about him.
“No.” He answered shakily, “Just wait a minute.”
“When would you say you fell in love?” Ms. Manuel asked, taking notes once again.
“Harry's almost ready to lock up.”
“I was wrong?” Harry asked sheepishly before turning to vomit again but only ended up drying heaving.
With the other hand he cupped Harry’s face and rubbed the brunette’s cheek with his thumb. “I love you. Ok?”
“Where are James and Scorpius?” He whispered, still staring straight ahead.
The other man continued to sob for a minute or two before he managed to compose himself enough to speak.
Draco was shocked at Harry's second curse word. He couldn’t remember ever hearing him swear before… and he really liked it.
“Is there anything in particular you want to try?” Draco asked, almost lazily stroking Harry’s awakening flesh.
Since he was still hard, Draco decided it would be a lot more fun to take care of the problem with her than his own hand.
Lucius gave the letter back to Draco. “Unfortunately, it is. It’s not a very common practice nowadays, but they never made it illegal. Harry was still underage when his legal guardians made the contract, therefore, it can’t be undone.
Fred and George
“I’m sorry.” Harry whispered and wrapped his arms around his husband’s neck.
“Alright, let’s see. How’s this?” He started softly rubbing the raven-haired boy’s shoulders.
“Alright then, there’s just one more order of business.”
is why I stopped you. You clearly need a lesson in manners, not that I would expect anything more from Potter’s child.”
As he worked his way downward, Ethan noted a growing difficulty in his rubbing from the awkward angle of his wrists. “You know what, why don’t you lie down and take your shirt off? Get more comfortable.”
Above him, the older boy gave a few hard thrusts before shouting his own release. “Scor!” He bellowed, pressing his hips firmly against the lithe ones beneath him, riding out his orgasm.
Looking between his son and the man who sired him (for he refused to refer to him as ‘father’), Draco replied, “I’m not surprised. He never liked Harry.”
“Good night, love.” Draco whispered with a small smile and kissed the brunette’s forehead. He watched Harry sleep for a minute before he walked around the privacy screen and motioned with his head for Remus and Sirius to follow him.
Draco hurriedly checked in on his youngest child to gratefully see the toddler was still fast asleep in his bed. He sighed in slight relief before making his way to his own bedroom.
The dark-haired boy pulled the blanket tighter around himself. “Five more minutes.” He mumbled sleepily.

it couldn’t have been more than fifteen minutes since the others left.
His nightmares had pretty much become non-existent. Most of the ones he did have weren’t bad enough to scare him awake and if they did, Draco was right there to hold him.
Looking hopeful, Harry asked, “Did you find anything?”
“Ready, love?” He asked, stroking his own erection a few times.
Harry sat on the sofa next to Draco once he was back and snapped open the box. “I’ve got bandages, anti-bacterial cream, alcohol swabs, medical tape, and probably anything else you might need.” He stated as he pulled out a few items. “I also grabbed some paper towels and got some wet. Now, talk.”
Blatantly keeping his attention off the other man, Harry replied, “He is and he just wanted to offer his congratulations.”
Draco thought about it for a moment. “You couldn’t have apparated. The muggles would have noticed your suddenly disappearing and you would have gotten in trouble. Astral projection is the closest thing I can think of.” He explained.
Immediately, her back completely left the wall and her nails dug into his shoulders as she screamed her completion.
“What’s happening to me?” Harry asked as he held his stomach.
The pair sat in a pleasant silence before Draco broke it by saying, “I actually have something else for you, too. I’m just not sure if I should give it to you yet.”
The two chatted amiably as they headed down to the dungeons.
Harry tried his best to ignore his lover’s ministrations, but the attention and naked body pressed against his back was getting to him.
“Oh, I wanted them to meet their brother.”
“Yeeaaah… Why?”
“Oh, you think that hurt? You’re fucking lucky I haven’t castrated you yet!” Harry seethed.

The Slytherin pulled his head back and realized that long, strawberry blonde had turned into short and black. At the same moment, the hot wetness around his cock started to tighten painfully and he quickly pulled out.
On his way back up, Harry heard a
Draco let out an appreciative moan and leaned against the shower wall in front of him so he wouldn’t have to support all his weight on his legs that were slowly turning to jelly under Harry's skillful hands.
sippy cup.
“Harry.” Draco called, as the brunette man had jumped up from the bed and dashed back into the bathroom before he could even ask him what he was doing.
The teen in question looked toward the door and cracked a wide smile when he saw the other father of his soon-to-be-child entering the room.

“That’s sounds good.” He said sweetly.
“Welcome back, Mr. Potter.” She said evenly. “I just need to make sure everything went alright. Then I want you to take this sleeping potion. It’ll help you heal faster.”
Retrieving his wand once again, Draco cleaned them up before making himself comfortable in Harry’s embrace.
“Are you going to tell him?” The older of the two asked.
“…rius… …Siri… SIRIUS!”
Harry dark brows drew together. “Then what?”
Finally he came to the conclusion that it was the way it had happened and that he didn’t know her name, or anything about her at all. In fact, he was starting think he may have fallen asleep and dreamt the entire scenario.
“Starlight.” He said curtly.
“No. I have to pass this potions test or Snape’s going to give me detention. Again.” Harry said with his head in his hands.
The blonde picked up a small, rectangular package wrapped in silver. He quickly opened it to find a fairly interesting potions book. “Mum’s not great at shopping for other people.” He muttered and set the book aside.

at me, Harry.” The brunette pulled back just enough to look up at him with
But you know what the irony is, he won’t be able to. Not for a while at least. You see, I’m already pregnant. I know because I have all the symptoms. I’m just lucky that my muggle relatives are stupid and think it’s “wedding jitters” or something like that.
“Please.” The brunette begged.
“You’re at St. Mungo’s, young man,” Healer Mendes replied. “I’ve checked you over, and other than the headache you seem to be just fine. However, I’d like to keep you here just for a few hours to be sure. I’ll get you in a room.”

Draco looked up through damp lashes. “You’ll w-wake me up as soon as I can leave, right?”
“Here, let me take her.” Ethan offered as he collected the small bundle. “Can I take her to meet her family?”
“Draco, is everything alright?” A frantic Narcissa asked as she rushed to her son.
The twenty-seven year old slammed on his brakes the moment he had seen the person, possibly a woman, dash into the street. The lesser friction of the wet road caused his car to slide a little and just barely stop in time.
“What
“No!” The blonde shouted with panic building in his eyes.
“Why?” Sirius asked, almost unable to comprehend the truth.
“Now if you will please wake him.” Professor Dumbledore said. The witch did as he asked.
Harry was about to tell her it was alright and that he didn’t mind when a soft hoot and tapping on glass sounded through the room. The group looked toward a window on the other side of the room and saw an owl perched on the window sill trying to get their attention.
When they came back, Draco sat on the opposite side of the bed from where the medi-witch was working. He took Harry's hand as she pulled a blanket up over Harry's waist and pulled the hospital gown he had changed into off of his stomach.
Her hands quickly found their way
“Who cares what anyone else thinks?” Draco asked with a small smile. “What’s important is that we have each other and the support of those closest to us. Besides, I thought we got passed this when we went to get you maternity robes a few weeks ago.”
Harry's brow furrowed. What could have his Draco so scared it reduced him to tears? “Of what? Did someone threaten you or the kids?” He quietly asked. Harry could feel the other murmur his response against his chest but only managed to catch the word, “baby.”
“And it takes twenty to get there
to spoil rotten. Harry was just glad they salvaged their friendship.
When Harry didn’t pull away, Draco decided to take it a little further. He added his tongue to the mix by lightly licking the seam of the other’s lips.
When they reached the portrait of the fat lady, the silence turned a little awkward.
Monica’s reaction was to stand
The two aforementioned young men stepped forward and hands were shaken.
then put the boy back in bed and waited for a few minutes until he was asleep
“Of course not.” The blonde replied. “While I could easily get by in life with my looks and the money I’ll inherit from my parents, I don’t want to just sit around all day for the rest of my life. I want to actually do something and for that, I actually have to know things.”
Draco smirked up at him and replied with, “Yeah, but I’m your whore.” He flicked his tongue over one hardened nub before immediately sliding farther down Harry’s body and sucking the erection he found there into his mouth.
on the key ring. He twirled the keys on his finger as he headed for the front
He got up and carefully placed the mirror on his bedside table. He opened the drawer and pulled something out. When he came back, he was holding a gift for the other. It was a very small box wrapped in shimmering blue paper.
“I’m freezing.” Harry said ten minutes later.
“And they were going to name him Scorpius.” Harry added when Draco didn’t continue.
While he was distracted by the kiss, Harry picked up some snow and shoved it down the back of Draco's robes. “Shit!” He jumped up and struggled to get the snow out.
brought out the color of his eyes. Draco had to admit, Scorpius was turning
Draco shrugged and pushed his hair back. “I don’t know, but you have money and power. That’s where people like my father come from.”
“I’m sorry. I’m just nervous.” Harry replied. “Articles about me in The Daily Prophet don’t always go well.”
Harrison assures us that an interview will be scheduled in the near future. He also gave us a small peek into their life as a soon-to-be-married couple, that we should expect an announcement for the birth of their first child within a year of the wedding.
With a light chuckle, the red-haired man moved around the bed and stopped at Harry’s side. He crouched down to the bound man’s level and, surprisingly, removed the gag.
“That really is a good idea, Harry.” Draco said happily. “Enough talk though.”
Christmas holidays had come and gone much quicker than either Harry or Draco wanted. They didn’t even do anything other than what they would normally do together. The biggest difference was that they spent every single moment with each other.
off while he got the water running in the tub.
“Yes.” Scorpius practically whined.
The young man in question glanced
A minute passed as Ethan continued to dry hump the boy beneath him. He finally had the sense to stop and ask, “Do you want to keep going?”
I know we mostly just talk through our mirrors before bed but I couldn’t wait that long to get this out, even though you probably won’t get this until tonight anyway.
Harry grabbed his wand that he had dropped and stood up. He quickly cast a silencing charm on the room before making sure the door was locked. It wouldn’t do to have two impressionable five year olds walk in on them. He turned back to his husband and paused to take in the sight before him.
Draco sighed in relief. There were only a few bruises this time and most of them were already fading.
I hope you’re doing alright.
With an amused smirk, Draco turned his attention from the quietly arguing couple, to Harry, who was now leaning back on a pile of pillows with their son in his arms, nearly asleep. He quickly picked the boy up from Harry's arms before something bad happened.
Ron shook his head curtly. He wasn’t going to let Snape put something he made in his mouth.
“Are you sure? I mean, you just came barreling out of that alley there. It looked like you were running from something.” Harry said skeptically, staring at the strangely dressed man.
“Uhhh… okay, I guess.” Scorpius stuttered, secretly wanting the touch of the older teen.
“I love you too.”
I’m sorry; I just really needed to get that off my chest.
“Emma! How’s Harry doing?”
“Ok” Harry sniffled.
After a short duel of tongues, Draco pulled away, gasping and panting for breath. He noted that she was just as breathless, if not more so.
Draco pulled off for a moment. “This is your first time, again, isn’t it?”
dashing. You’ll be beating woman off with a stick at the party.”
“When you’re ready, I’ll listen.” Draco said quietly and gave the boy in his arms a reassuring squeeze.
waited for her to leave, hoping she hadn’t seen him staring.
“Can… can I ask you a question first?” Scorpius asked timidly.
and just about every other wizarding newspaper and magazine, within a week, if not the very next day.
“We?” Scorpius squeaked.
Draco grabbed the edge of Harry's almost elbow length sleeve and slid it up to his shoulder. A small gasp escaped his lips. An angry, purple, handed shaped bruise adorned Harry's bicep. He quickly reached for the other sleeve and saw a matching bruise there as well. He then placed his hands gently over the marks and Draco saw that the person’s hands that caused them, were even bigger than his.
“His uncle
“They told us only one person could come in. Your dad tried to argue about it, but I pushed passed him. That’s why the door opened so harshly.” The young Wood explained.

“And you go to boarding school?”
“Remember, in bed before I’m out of
Harry let go of his trunk as well and wrapped his arms around Draco's torso, resting his chin against his chest and smiling up at him. “I doubt she’s half as bad as Mrs. Weasley. So I think I can handle it.”

Albus came to see me and Arthur this morning and told us what happened. I couldn’t believe that my own son would do something so terrible. But he showed us irrefutable proof of what Ron did.
A tinge of pink adorned his cheeks as Harry said, “It’s your Christmas present.” He handed it to the other with lightly shaking hands. “I hope you like it.”
Harry took the box and slowly opened it. Under the paper was a black velvety jewelry box. He opened it and gasped. It was a silver pendant on a long chain set with a ruby and an emerald in the center.
“I agree,” Draco stated, helping the other remove his clothing.
some medicine then.” He picked the toddler up and went into the kitchen with
That seemed to pull Harry back to the task at hand and he pulled the rest of the way back before slamming back in, causing Draco to slide a few inches further up the bed.
Harry's eyes grew impossibly wide. “What are you talking about?” He screeched. “You do realize I’m a boy, don’t you?”
“That’s why I’ve decided that I want
“I had Tonks send him home so I could straighten up the mess he made. I fire-called those redheaded devils and demanded they tell me the counter spell so I could fix it but they wouldn’t. When I was done with that, I went to sit in my office and this happened.” He gestured to his neon pink robes and gave his son’s down turned head a small glare.
Draco stayed with Harry through the rest of lunch. All too soon though, the bell rang and the blonde reluctantly left Harry sitting there, alone, again.
“It’ll have to wait until the next time Sirius and… Severus go out.” Both older
Harry pouted a little but replied, “No, I’m not.”

“Is that the only reason you’re engaged?” Narcissa asked.
“Her name’s Astoria Greengrass. I met her while looking to hire a surrogate mother. I’d wanted a child for a while but since I don’t sleep with woman, I didn’t have another choice. She was calling to let me know her next pre-natal exam had been rescheduled.” Draco finished with his right knee and started cleaning up his shins.
Harry had been ready for retaliation and ducked out of the way just in time. He dropped to his knees and prepared another ball. When he looked up, Draco was gone. “Where’d you go?” He asked.
nodded and drained his glass. Then they both paid for their drinks and went
Draco finished tearing off the wrapping paper to reveal two sets of knit baby booties. One done in Gryffindor red and gold, the other in Slytherin emerald and silver. Hermione’s knitting skills had greatly improved since fourth year and Harry stated as much.
“Friends?”
That was the last straw. Draco let go of him, shoved him to the ground and kicked him in the stomach.
“It’s alright. It’s not like I haven’t failed a test before.” The dark-haired boy sighed.
“The minister himself couldn’t make you stay.” Draco reassured him with a nearly smug smile.
“Who was it, Harry? A teacher? Another student?” Sirius asked when he managed to let go of Harry enough to see his face.
Harry pulled his son back into a comforting hug. “You aren’t alone. Your father and I are right here with you. Plus, Grandma Cissy, Grandpa Sirius, Grandpa Remy, Grandma Molly… everyone. No one is going to leave you alone with this.”
wrong.
“Hello.” They said in unison. Harry heard no response from the guest and assumed he may have nodded or waved in greeting.
Scorpius nodded. “Ok.” Harry smiled. “Good. You also have my permission to go back to your room if you get too uncomfortable or your father
“It sounds like your brother is
Harry pounced.
“Hmm?”
