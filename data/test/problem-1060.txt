"I cannot report Katie's thing until I get proof, but I will get it. And I will end you. Fuck, how can I be such an idiot? You are despicable."
Draco could not stop himself from grinning a bit, just with the corner of his mouth, but he hid it like a criminal and run back to the privacy of his bed.
"Watch me. If they want to give us detention, they should be here, and it is not my fault that I have a busy schedule. Already fifteen minutes passed, Potter, and that is definitely too much."
And now he was looking at him. Draco knew he looked like shit, but he did not need Potter staring. Hadn't he said that he didn't care? What was he looking at then? Stupid Potter with his stupid hair all over the place. It was a horrifying view, really, all that black, tangled mess on top of his ridiculous face. Why was he having breakfast at such unearthly times anyways? Draco kind of expected him to say something, but the green eyes eventually turned back to his food. Stupid green eyes.
He opened a bit the curtains of his bed so that he could see the moonlight. He found some consolation in that. Another method he used to avoid spiralling after the nightmares was to hug a pillow. Pretend it was some person that would die to protect him. Which was as pathetic as everything else, of course. He stayed like that for a while, not daring to close his eyes again, catching glimpses of the red bed across the room. If he stayed very quiet, he could hear Potter breathing.
Potter reached for him, as if he wanted to touch him, and for a very small second, a wicked corner of his head convinced Draco that it would be very easy to pretend that he was still feverish and delirious, so that he could keep that obliging and awkwardly helpful version of Potter around.
"It's not funny, Ron," reprimanded Hermione. "Snape took away twenty more points from Gryffindor. We will lose the Cup at this rate. And that's going to rest in your shoulders alone, Harry."
Ugh, he'd gotten on his nerves with all the staring, he'd made him lose his shit with his dumb challenge. Beg him to stop? You beg me to stop, Malfoy. Harry thought they had gotten over the stupid masks phase. But once again, Draco was hiding behind a hate and a coldness that had to be fake. How dared he hide after having slid his tongue down his throat? Harry knew better than to believe that Malfoy's feelings were inalterable. Malfoy was all emotion and Harry had witnessed it, behind every mask, the gray turmoil at the bottom of his eyes. But hell, he was good at pretending. It was as if the thing that made them go crazy and engage in stupid dares was not there anymore. Merlin, why couldn't he find it? Where had it gone? Maybe he was not close enough, maybe he needed to get closer, wreck the barrier, crush the defences, and.
But he was not going to back down, because if he only had the luxury of a single option, he at least was going to get the most out of it.
They did not talk. Harry eventually felt like he could stop eating. Malfoy was a distraction big enough to not have the need to fill the silence with food. And it was not awkward because Malfoy was too focused on the food. He ended up finishing everything, which for some reason felt extremely satisfying for Harry. When he was done, they tidied up and Draco spelled the smell away and sent the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.
Harry stood up, not bothering to hide his anger, and walked towards Malfoy while Snape made the desks and chairs vanish.
"No, Potter. You are fine," Draco said, and Potter chuckled. It was embarrassing. But it was more embarrassing the way the chuckle made Draco's stomach react.
Harry's heart hurt in his chest. Malfoy's body shined because of the water and he was pale as the moon. He was fucking beautiful, but Harry forced himself to look away. For some reason, he could not force his legs to leave the bathroom.
"None of your business," he replied hastily, focusing on the angry commands in his head that sounded awfully like Pansy:
"I'm going to shower," said Draco as an escape route, and Potter acted all betrayed and confused again, which Draco deliberately avoided thinking about.
." Potter looked stupid with that face, not that he didn't always look stupid, and that was not how he sounded at all.
"Didn't you want to go to bed?" At this point, Harry just wanted to escape those piercing gray eyes.
"Oh my sweet dear," Ron interrupted. He looked as if his eyes were going to fall out of their orbits. Hermione was shocked too, mouth completely open. "Oh my fucking and bloody dear. That's- That's disgusting, Harry. Merlin, I cannot. I surely cannot."
"Mr. Malfoy is already standing up. This is a practical exercise, which you would know if you had been paying attention. You cannot do it if you are sitting," he snapped. "Now, move. Your insolence just cost Gryffindor ten points."
"Suspicious? You mean besides the fact that he skips every class and he always goes to sleep extremely late?" asked Ron bitterly.
"You left the Dark Mark in plain sight?!" shrieked Pansy. Draco, the most thorough and cautious person she knew, had gone around exposing a really good reason to lock him up in Azkaban. Just because he was stupid and horny.
"What the hell are you saying?! There's been no kiss with Malfoy! He is a guy, for fuck's sake! I would have told you if I suddenly liked guys!"
"'Of course not," Harry managed to spit out, too hysterically to be an ounce convincing. "Why would you think so?"
"Don't overthink it, okay?" murmured Ron, pulling her into a complete hug. "We will talk to him tomorrow."
. Red and with a funny-looking, swollen nose. "And stop grabbing my arm as if you could touch me with those dirty paws. As if you were my friend or something."
He also was an annoying roommate. The prick had left some dinner for him every single night of that week. As if he had some saying in what Draco ate or stopped eating. And he kept having noisy nightmares that would interrupt the little hours of sleep that he got himself. It was insufferable that he got to be the victim of a ridiculous amount of tragedy and misfortune, while Draco himself had to
"Potter, I know that reflection is a skill that you find difficult, but we will be needing more than three words from you," said Snape. Draco caught McGonagall eyeing him dangerously.
"Exactly, and Harry is the Chosen One. The Chosen One to kill Voldemort, who is Malfoy's boss if we are right. That means that Harry is the worst enemy for Voldemort and all of his Death Eaters, and that makes him a target. But if Malfoy and Harry are somehow involved, sexually or emotionally, that puts Harry in an even more vulnerable position."
"We need to what? Why?" Hermione asked, liberating herself from Pansy's grasp, but too curious to live the room.
"I don't know, Hermione! Maybe because I know that he didn't want to hurt her- he truly didn't want to hurt Katie. And he cannot be that bad if he is losing his sanity over whatever it is that he is doing."
"Which was intentional. But now you know much more than most people at Hogwarts, and I would not appreciate it if you went around talking about me."
Draco didn't know where that came from. But Potter's face expression was utterly shaken, as if in the deepest corner of his soul, he agreed. Or maybe it was just pure hatred, maybe he was just angry. Draco got closer to him, trying to understand what had triggered Potter's state. And as he got closer, he felt more and more powerful. As he got closer, the way Potter looked at him made his head spin, all that vulnerability in his stupidly beautiful green eyes, unable to shout something back. It felt good to be able to get under his skin that easily. Potter tried to push him away, but Draco stood still, strengthened by the fact that Saint Potter, the Golden Boy, had
"Mr. Potter! What are you doing?" hissed Snape, which Ron thought was the final warning for Harry to back off.
"Well, I cannot be sure, but he disappears from the Marauder's Map without leaving the castle, so I reckon..."
"What is your mother going to say when she discovers that you ruined her shirt, Malfoy? Why, were they out of shirts for men?"
"I don't know. Malfoy is quite clean," he blurted out nervously. Draco rolled his eyes again, but he could not help but realise that Potter was not particularly dirty. Perhaps a bit messy, especially during the first week, but not as disgusting as he knew some boys their age were. He wondered if Potter had made some effort to keep up with his obsessive cleanliness.
"You could have told me, I just need a couple of minutes and I'm done, okay?" Then he spelled the lights back on, but Draco had already reached his bed and hid behind the curtains. "Goodnight, eh? Arsehole!"
Draco had grown up living in the kind of world that follows wars. A world where everyone knows what is right and what is wrong. (Right is what won. Wrong is what lost.) A world than knows pain and loss. Not that his family had lost much. Which meant that his family was part of the winners, right?
And Potter was looking at his mouth now. He was looking at his lips as if he wanted to drink from them, as if he wanted to bite them off.
"Surprisingly enough, I do," said Potter sarcastically. "And you know it, that I understand what it means to have Voldemort messing with my life."
Harry put his toothbrush, toothpaste, and soap on the other shelf. He turned on the tap and let the hot water run. He also poured some of Malfoy's aromatic products into the bathtub, because
"But what if the monsters are already inside?" muttered Potter, as if he'd forgotten who he was talking to, lost somewhere in his head. AndÂ Draco couldn't do this. He couldn't talk like this with Potter. This made no sense. He didn't realize that he was shivering until Potter shook his head like he was waking up and eyed him worriedly. "Malfoy, you are shaking."
"No, Harry, that's not what we are saying. Have you considered that maybe he is using the kissing and whatever else you do to distract you?"
Hermione could read the distress in Harry's eyes loud and clear, and her heart broke a bit. She couldn't help but feel that Harry identified with the stuff he claimed Malfoy was going through. And she felt powerless.
"You were having a nightmare, I came here to wake you up." Draco loved it when he was able to keep his voice completely cool and breezy even if his insides were an utter mess. He thanked the darkness for hiding all the things that not even his sixteen years of practice in pretending would be able to hide.
He decided to be petty about it, and stretched his time in bed, not wanting to face Malfoy too early in the morning. He shouldn't have worried about it.
"You don't understand!" he said a bit too excitedly, but the Professor was getting on his nerves. "I hate him! That will never change!"
"So do me a favour and give it a thought next time you open your big mouth. Because you can call me anything, Potter, but not selfish. I am not doing this for me."
Harry realised that taking care of Malfoy probably was not the best way to get him out of his head, but Malfoy was sick, and Harry couldn't just sleep while he was sick. Besides, it should be easy to get over him if he kept watching how he puked everything he swallowed.
Something trembled deep in the silver pupils, just for a second. Malfoy opened his mouth to say something back, but nothing came out.
The words of his friends must have arrived to some corner of his brain, because Potter loosened his grasp slightly, although he did not let Draco go.
"Let's seat," said Pansy as she grabbed Hermione's hand, more softly this time. The Gryffindor girl was too shocked to resist. They sat and Pansy dropped her hand as if it was nothing odd that she had taken it in the first place.
Where to go? Slytherin? The Quidditch Field? Draco didn't know. He had nowhere to go. Nowhere to hide in.
Anyways, he was tired. And Malfoy not being there gave him time to take a hot bath. It had been a very stressful day, now that, somehow, both Ron and Hermione knew that something was up. After thinking about it the whole day, he still did not know what was he going to tell them. The only conclusion he had arrived to was the fact that he could never again get close to Malfoy. No more kissing, no more hidden looks, no more worrying about Malfoy's health. Maybe if he was able to stay away from him for a very long time, one day he would be able to understand what the hell had those days been, and what had happened, and why, and when.
"I don't care about Quidditch right now, Potter," repeated Malfoy, as if he was an idiot. Harry felt like an idiot.
Harry hated him. If he wanted, he would be able to make a list in a two mile parchment with all the things he hated about Malfoy. And yet, when Malfoy said
As soon as they finished eating, they passed by the Hospital wing to try and get more information on their classmate's health, but madame Pomfrey promptly kicked them out.
Apparently, Malfoy was not coming back. Maybe he was in Slytherin. He for sure had enough people licking his ass to have somewhere to crash. The jerk would have no problem in making someone sleep in the ground as long as he had a bed. Maybe he was sleeping
"Well, I don't know, okay?" replied Harry, trying as hard as possible to be rude so that they would leave him alone. "It's not as if it's new that I fight with Malfoy."
"Dammit, Potter," cursed Draco. And he kissed him again. Wildly. And Potter did not have to kiss back, because his mouth was already open for him. Their tongues tangled immediately, and it was messy, and wet, and delicious. Draco was pressing their bodies together, and the friction was. Well, it was magical. Potter passed his arms around his neck and buried his hands in his hair. And it would have been outrageous, to mess up Draco's hair like that, but it felt so good that Draco had to swallow a
"From what you told me, he is not precisely keen on accepting help, so it buys us time to find a way to make him accept our help."
"It's not me I'm concerned about. You fell asleep before I did," he said, his smile moving to his eyes.
"What do you mean yours? How can it be yours if its red?" As he spoke, he removed the tie from his neck, and that's when he realised that the tie he had been wearing all day was green and silver. So that's how Ron and Hermione had found out. "I- I don't-"
"That would be honestly surprising, I cannot picture you talking about a topic with an ounce of interesting in it."
Racism is a plague. It is everywhere. We grow in schools were children are bullied on the basis of race or where their parents come from. The mainstream media and fictional worlds only tell the white stories (Harry Potter is the whitest story ever, and JK Rowling had the audacity to call the only racialized character she has Cho Chang). We have the duty to unlearn white supremacy, we have the duty to deconstruct our racist tendencies and to use our white privilege to fucking put down a system that needs people to die and suffer for others to thrive.
And then it ended. Too fast. To little. Draco felt his lips tingling furiously. Potter's lips were slightly parted, and his eyes were wide open. He was gorgeous, and Draco wanted to kiss him again. But his brain was starting to work again, so he fought all the cells in his body and backed down.
He still didn't understand why he had suddenly felt so ill, but he guessed the stressful life that he was heading had decided to knock him off for a night. He vaguely remembered Potter hovering all over him all night before he managed to fall asleep, but he was determined not to let that get in the way of his decision to ignore him. Besides, he did remember that McGonagall had said that she would end the detention if they lasted one more week, and he felt the strength to do that now, after a wonderful night of deep sleep.
"How can one interpret something like that? I could not. You cannot imagine, I really really tried, but it was too random. And the next day I looked for him, but he was ignoring me, and I was so mad. Who the fuck does he think he is? And then in the night he was super late again, but I waited, just so he would explain. But he didn't. He kept trying to ignore me. And then I kind of proved to him that he could not ignore me forever, that he is not as good at controlling his impulses as he thinks he is. The thing is, we ended up kissing again, we even took our shirts off, but then I left. Because why on Earth did we kiss again? It's like I completely lose my mind when he is near. Like earlier today, you know. It's completely sickening. So I decided that I did not want it to happen ever again, and yesterday I was so ready to tell him, to end all this once and for all, but he... He messed with my mind, okay? He came up with the dare thing, and said that he wanted 'just sex', as if he knew anything about sex. And no one was supposed to know but-"
"That's not new, though, he dragged us to Knocturn Alley already. You know, when they almost caught us because of you."
"I cannot." Draco held on to Harry's shirt, in a hopeless attempt of clinging to reality. "I cannot do this. Please, I can't."
"What?! No!" snapped Draco. "I mean, I know that I am mature enough to stand him a week longer, but Potter?! Potter lacks the maturity to even clean after himself-"
Draco realised that he was still seated on his bed. He readily stood up. He may have blushed for some stupid hormonal unbalance, but the room was dark, Potter was blind, and he would have denied it.
"Are you done? Because I want to sleep and your butthurt speech because I kicked you out of my bed bores me."
It was already late when he finally left the Room of Requirements and joined life at Hogwarts again. No one had noticed he was missing.
He really did not want to confront him, but he needed sleep. He needed to get his shit together. He had lost a whole day because of his dumb brain reproducing with unnecessary detail the reason why he now probably had some deathly virus eating him alive. Draco knew that if he went back to their bedroom, Potter would still be awake. Because that's what he did. Have dinner at midnight and breakfast at four AM. But what if what had happened was enough for Potter to avoid him for the rest of their lives? Maybe his neuron had been able to understand that it was much better for the sake of their sanity to avoid each other. Maybe, this one time, Draco would be able to go to sleep without having to speak to him. Maybe?
"Come on, Dray. Let's have some fun," she pushed, but the boy was not very receptive, which she quickly picked up on. "Hey, is everything alright?"
Harry snorted and scowled at him at the same time. Malfoy could not just joke himself out of being hateful.
Draco caught how he changed his mind and smirked with the corner of his lips. Maybe Potter was able to control his neuron when he had enough motivation. He was glad that he'd been able to
"Why didn't I force you? Wow, as bad as your perception of me is, I do not coerce people into kissing me, Potter."
"Professors Snape and McGonagall want you to solve your differences, Harry. That is the point of this seemingly unorthodox detention, to fix the problem, rather than ignore it."
First, the Dark Lord was only fascinating when read upon. In real life, he was just terrifying. But he was now living in his house, and he had marked his arm because he had had the power to do so.
"Oh, come on, you cannot seriously be mad about this," he said with his green eyes shining with tears of laughter.
. As if he had something in the back of his throat. It was gorgeous. "I'm done, anyway. It is always an absolute loss of time to share air with you."
That was clearly a trick question. Answering that they could not bear it longer meant more detention, but answering "as long as necessary" was a
No, he was not going to have a mental breakdown again. He did not have the time for another one. He breathed in deeply, ignoring his heated-up face, flustered with shame.
But then Malfoy's pale face turned red. Red. Like a fucking red light. Like an apple. A red apple. Something in Harry's insides rejoiced. Like what the hell. Malfoy was brilliant red. Shiny red. Harry
Potter had also left too early that morning. Draco always woke up before him. Every single day since they'd started sharing a room, and actually, also before that. Mornings were Draco's Potter-free times. So what was Potter doing disturbing their well-established dynamic? It almost felt as if Potter was avoiding him. How dared he? Draco was the avoider, thank you very much. That's how they worked, and it was fine like that. Potter could not just change it all of a sudden. There were rules, okay? Unspoken rules, but rules nonetheless.
can be used to burn your opponent. Obviously, it is a pretty dark jinx. It increases the body temperature gradually, which weakens and slows down your rival. It is a tricky curse because it can easily go unnoticed, but its effects can be lethal if it is not stopped early enough."
At some point, Draco gradually stopped shaking and he just stayed still, his head hidden between his knees, too tired for anything else. Harry was scared to move, he just sat there. Stroking his back. Malfoy did not complain.
Potter barked a laugh. "What am I going to do without your glamorous shouting in the morning, Malfoy?"
Draco burst out in a loud laugh, and he impulsively hugged her. Pansy doubted for a second, but she slowly hugged him back after a few seconds. And they stayed like that for a bit.
If he hadn't been Albus Dumbledore, Hogwart's Headmaster, and one of the only adults he thought highly of, Harry would have answered very aggressively and inappropriately to remove that condescending smile from his face. But he was Dumbledore after all, so Harry remained quiet.
And that was how Harry Potter, a proud Gryffindor, famous for his braveness and courage, escaped the scene and hid in his bed. And Draco was left alone, miserably standing against the wall, with the worst case of blue balls he had ever experienced. And he felt like crying. Out of frustration. Out of anger. How dared Potter leave him like that.
"Short," he answered without thinking, and then he blushed furiously. If Ron had not been concentrated in not puking, it would have been cute. "I mean, he kissed me, and told me to interpret it as I willed."
Draco blinked, his cheeks subtly turning pink for a second. He really had not wanted to notice the fact that there was no underwear under Potter's trousers, but his mind was doing its own thing. And then he saw the bathroom, flooded and a complete mess.
There was a line. And if he had not crossed it when he had tried to send him on the train back to London, he had done it now. One thing was physical abuse, he was used to that after living with the Dursleys. But those fucking words. With that fucking tone. They still echoed in his head.
It was dark already, and they were not supposed to be freely walking around Hogwarts, so every sound was amplified in Draco's head. Everything from his chattering teeth to their hurried steps across the hallways echoed in Draco's skull. He must've been going insane because the sounds kept getting louder and louder, startling his already too sensitive body every time. When they were almost in their room, he kept jolting closer to Potter's body as a reflex response to every particularly strong sound.
"You are so obsessed that you don't even notice everyone watching how you gaze at me as if I was the fucking moon!"
The weird unspoken truce they had arrived to by living together had been noticed outside their shared room. Hogwarts had become more silent since they had been grounded, but no one likes it when storms get quiet, because it is the kind of silence that chaos leaves behind. Everywhere they went, there were rumours in every corner. Potter was used to it, but it throughly annoyed Draco. However, he hoped that the silence was enough to convince their teacher's to end the whole idiocy they had come up with.
"If you want to call it like that," he said, ignoring Potter's hand. "But we are not friends, Potter. I hate you. I will pretend so well that you might end up doubting it, but I hate you, and I will always hate you. If Snape or McGonagall ask, I will say that I have learnt to stand you and to bear with you, that you have taught me new ways to see the world, but it obviously won't be true, do you understand?"
"I wasn't offering," she stopped him before he fully went back to the conceited guy that would never listen to her, "but then you have to agree with me that Potter is a hobby, and you cannot afford hobbies."
"Shut it, Potter. You are an embarrassment to Gryffindor. That's the second time you physically attack Mr Malfoy. As for you," McGonagall turned to Draco, who had sat down obediently, too stunned to speak back, "verbal attacks are equally despicable. Snape removed fifty points from Gryffindor, I will remove ten more, and fifty from Slytherin. If Professor Snape agrees, the detention will continue indefinitely. You will both have to learn how to behave as the functional adult wizards you are expected to be, or otherwise, you will continue to be treated like children."
, it was terrifying. "Do you think it is your job to find a culprit of something that so obviously was nothing but a
Harry nodded in agreement, providing far less encouragement than he normally would. He grabbed some breakfast for himself. He was starving.
The curtains of the red bed were shut close, and Draco heard how the disgusting prat was snoring. He turned on the lights to change to his pyjamas. And maybe because he didn't mind if he woke him up. Maybe he preferred to start with the operation "Ignore Potter" the following day. Perhaps he wanted a last chance to vent and fight with him, to feel the heat of the discussions and to look into his angry green eyes one last time.
The Polyjuice Potion was ready for Crabbe and Goyle, the necklace was carefully secured in its box. If no one opened it, no one would be injured. He had written down explicit instructions for his stupid friends to follow. No one would be suspicious of him or his accomplices.
Potter's blushed face hiding behind the book, making it painfully obvious that he was not paying attention to the story.
"Whatever you think is best, but be careful. We don't want the whole school knowing about this, and the Weasel seems far more slow and clumsy than you. "
"It will be weird to stop sharing a room with you," Potter confessed, almost too quietly for Draco to be sure he'd heard correctly.
Draco wanted Potter to kiss him. He wanted it because it was a necessary and efficient way to distract him from his dark activities. It was all part of the plan. Feed Potter's obsession with kisses and touches. Have sex with Potter while he planned an attack against Dumbledore and against Hogwarts. Keep the Chosen One close so that he would not see him coming. That morning, he thought that it was like prostituting himself, but it honestly was not as bad as the Dark Lord's tasks.
Potter wiggled a bit on top of him. He then opened one green eye and smiled half mocking half satisfied. Draco knocked him out of the bed. He made sure that Potter saw his own smile, half wicked half conceited.
"Let's not jump to conclusions so quickly," answered Hermione. "Before we consider helping him, we should first figure out what is it that we are trying to stop."
That's when the screams began. The same that he had heard the previous night. The sound was heart-wrenching and Draco missed the loud breathing of earlier. He wanted to leave, to run away. It was too painful to listen to that kind of screaming. During the summer, when the Death Eaters tortured people in the mansion, the howls were similar.
"Wait, but this was long ago, how come you haven't said anything until now?" asked Hermione, slightly hurt.
"Stop trying to change the topic!" Potter roughly grabbed his chair and turned him back again, blocking Draco between his body and the table. They were face to face again, although now they stood closer. Draco hated to be sitting down, it gave all the power of the momentum to Potter when he was the one that was being pathetic, for once. "You did not tell me what is it that drew you away from Quidditch. And don't dare to say that you are good with not playing Quidditch. Because whatever it is that you think is more important, I know it's also the reason why you don't sleep, and why you did not even think of that essay before today."
"Such a gentleman, Potter. Had anyone ever told you?" Malfoy commented as Harry changed his glass of water.
"Do you really want to talk about this naked?" insisted the Slytherin, trying as hard as possible to concentrate in Potter's eyes.
"It's hot, right?" asked Potter, and because Draco's eyes were more used to the darkness now, he could distinguish Potter's silhouette, spread in the bed without blankets, looking at the ceiling.
"But that doesn't count," replied Potter. "The shagging, I mean. It's almost like when we are fighting. It didn't really change anything, so McGonagall couldn't have been talking about that."
"Ron, what's going on? Why are you telling me this?" Harry didn't want to hear it. Why was Ron saying all that. Why was he saying it right at
"What is there to learn with such an insufferable-" he started, but suddenly stopped. He concentrated on the pain in his arm, on his plan. "Well, I have definitely learnt some things, yes. For instance- For instance, how different it is to share a room with a Gryffindor compared to four Slytherins."
"Well, Professor, I wouldn't know," replied Harry getting annoyed. "It's not as if we have been having tea in the afternoons and discussing our childhoods. We have not fought in weeks, that should be enough. We learnt the lesson."
way. Not that Harry felt attracted by it, of course. More like others. If Malfoy did something, people looked. That's just how it was and it was nerve-wrenching.
"Well, nobody asked you to eat my neck out but look at this," Draco said, as he pointed the very clear and very red spot on his lower neck, right above his collarbone. "Pretty crazy for somebody that is completely uninterested in me."
Draco bit his lip harshly to stop himself from giving in. Potter opened his eyes at the sight and leaned forward. Just a bit. Still not enough to fully close the distance.
"There hasn't been any actual evolution, don't you think? I don't think we get along better now than when this detention started."
At first, Draco thought he was a hallucination. Potter couldn't possibly have caught him at the lowest point of his life. Draco was dirty and sweaty and everything hurt and all his muscles felt dumb. And now he was delusional. He couldn't deal with fake Potters now.
His chest was compressing. He couldn't breathe. And Draco fell. Somewhere in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
"What the fuck are you saying? Why would I care about you being close?" And maybe if his voice hadn't sound desperate, Draco would have backed down.
"There are potions you can take for the nightmares, you know?" offered Draco. "They never work for me, but they knock Goyle out for a whole eight hour night without dreams. I have some left if you want-"
Draco did not comment any further but breathed out slightly relieved. He grabbed some parchments and books and walked towards the door, leaving. It was a mystery that he had not thought of leaving earlier, but none of the boys noticed. He was almost out of there when Potter grabbed his arm. Again. As if it was normal, as if he had the right.
"We have been talking about Quidditch all afternoon," frowned Hermione. "What is going on with you?"
Plus, he was starving, as Potter had sharply pointed out. And now the whole room was impregnated with the juicy and tasty smell of Hogwarts' special baked potatoes. If he was not mistaken, his nostrils also detected something sweet, like hot chocolate or caramel apples.
Harry wanted to check his fever because Malfoy was being delusional and Harry had never expected, not even in his wildest dreams, that he would ever hear that from Draco fucking Malfoy. A too high temperature was the only explanation Harry could come up with, but that implied touching him, and Harry could not just go and touch him. He simply could not, not after his little speech on how cool muggle art was. So he buried himself in the book that he was holding and read. He did not understand a thing of what his mouth pronounced, but he kept reading until his throat hurt and his eyes were dry.
Draco was breathing loudly, trying to control the shivering and the impending panic attack that was spreading through his chest and arms, all the way to his feet. Suddenly, all he could feel was the burning Death Eater mark in his arm. He needed Potter to leave.
Harry, obviously, did not know what the hell Snape was talking about. He alarmingly looked for Hermione for a quick summary of the class, but she was in the other corner of the class, partnered with Pansy Parkinson.
"I told Harry to distract Malfoy so that he cannot do whatever it is that he is supposed to do. I'd like to know what is it that he is supposed to do, but I guess that could put him and us in compromising situations..."
Draco screamed when he heard. Screamed is in fact an understatement. It was more like he broke in half. As if a part of his soul had left his body in a howl. If someone had heard, he probably would have hurt them for life. Like he had hurt Katie Bell.
"What are you doing? What's the need of touching me like that?" Harry hissed nervously. Malfoy didn't answer. He was firmly holding his shoulders, in what wanted to be an aggressive grasp, but that was too
"You are awake!" greeted Potter, entering the room, his arms full with new provisions. "I got you some orange juice."
"I've been looking like this all year, Potter. Sorry to disappoint," his tone was terrible, bitter, sour,
After some failed struggles to make Potter leave, they ended up laying facing each other. It was Draco's bed, he sure as hell was not going to leave
And that's when Harry's legs finally responded and he rushed outside of the bathroom. He was closing the door behind him, when Draco called him again.
Okay, right. So Potter was dreaming about him. Wonderful. Bloody brilliant. For a second, Draco felt like fainting, because he was sick, with the
He had wanted to confront him during the day, as unsuccessfully as it had gone in the morning. Now it was almost midnight, and there he was, on the floor, looking at the fucking door. Waiting for him. Unable to think of anything else.
"Wait, are you sure?" Potter asked, standing up quickly for someone that was disoriented after having just woken up. He stopped Draco taking his arm (duh). "I normally remember what I dream-"
"I kind of deserved that punch. I lost it back there," murmured Malfoy suddenly. "And close your mouth, will you? For Merlin's sake, you are disgusting."
He still was unable to move. And Potter kept breathing hard, and now Draco was hard, but there was no way he was going to even acknowledge that fact.
"So, are you going to kiss me or what?" asked Draco impatiently. She was truly beautiful. She had pretty brown eyes, although they were not as expressive and alive as. Well, as nobody. There was no need for stupid comparisons.
"Thanks, Weasley, I can see that you are a true gentleman unlike your friend Potter... Oh, right, you are not actual friends, he is just the celebrity whose ass you faithfully kiss."
Draco, astonished and angry to be so obviously the subject of his mockery, got rid of Potter's grip. Not for long, though, as Potter had the audacity to hold his arm again.
And Potter opened his eyes as if he was waking up from a dream and looked at him with panic, and Draco knew that was the moment when he would wake up from his fantasy, and leave him alone. Draco shuddered at the thought.
Draco tensed up. The professors table was empty and the Gryffindors were clapping like brainless walruses to their brainless leader.
"What the fuck, Malfoy?" he spluttered from the floor, and only then he noticed that he had no clothes on besides his underpants. "Shit."
"Well, walls should be there to protect you from the monsters outside. They are supposed to be safe," Draco said.
Draco went pale. That is, paler than usual. Pansy squinted at him, trying to decipher if it was all a bad joke.
Harry blushed furiously as he returned to their shared room. Furiously as in "with fury". As in "fuck off, Dumbledore".
"Now you change topics. Nervous, Potter? What's wrong? Am I too close?" Tiredness long forgotten, Draco had no clue what he was saying. But it felt like a rush, and it filled him with energy, so he kept going.
"Would you? Would you tell me if you could?" asked Harry softly. Malfoy wasn't red anymore. All the blood had vanished from his face. Now he was white. Terrifyingly white. He started shaking, and Harry felt weak. "I know it is weird, but you can trust me. Maybe I can help or-"
"If you had listened to the whole explanation, you would have known that these spells work both ways. They can be countered with the other, but alone, their effects are ruthless. Next time, exercise your patience, or listen to the lesson."
Harry hated the new room. It smelled weird. Good, but weird. He missed the noise, the mess, his friends. At that point of the night, Neville would be putting on his pyjamas, ready to sleep, and Ron probably was still in the common room with Hermione, playing chess or commenting on his misfortune. Seamus and Dean, Ginny, and all the rest were probably hanging around too. And he had to be locked up in there, in a small room lost somewhere in the castle, alone. Because, of course, Malfoy had not returned in the whole evening.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy! Tell me that it is not true! Tell me that you didn't sleep with freaking Harry Potter, saviour of the Wizarding World and your, I quote you, "arch nemesis" since First year. Tell me!"
was a good conversation opener. His mind could not process further than the wet blond locks dancing around and splattering water droplets all over Malfoy's face.
And Harry breathed. Because he could not tell him or Hermione. But maybe Ron suspected something and yet, there he was, trying to be there for him like he always was. Harry felt a wave of gratitude and love spreading throughout his body. And he smiled, more honestly this time.
. What the fuck. It was not even the usual subtle pink in the cheeks, but an intense red all over his face, including his bloody forehead, and his ears, and his chin, and his neck. Goodness. Harry wondered were the blush ended under his clothes. But then Malfoy ran to the bathroom and left him there, staring, making him feel as if he'd done something wrong.
Draco glared furiously at him, but he did not speak. He did not shout. The only way to get rid of Potter was to ignore him.Â But Potter was determined, and he could feel Draco's arm shivering under his touch.
"So why did you come here?" asked Potter again. And maybe it was because he was extremely tired, or because Potter was sitting very close, or because the question had been somewhat hesitant and apparently that was cute too, but Draco couldn't help but answer as truthfully as the situation allowed.
"If Malfoy cares just a tiny bit about Harry, it is more likely for him to survive if he's not left alone with Voldemort," Hermione explained ruthlessly. Parkinson was not nearly as scary as she thought she was.
"Yes, but we owe him the chance to explain everything, and he has all the rights to do whatever he wants to do, and we have to respect it and support him-," started Ron, in a speech that seemed well prepared.
"No way. Didn't you hear what I said? You have to be able to control your emotions. You don't know how to that."
"What do you mean why? It's you! You would never hook up with anyone in this school. They are all beneath you, you've said it a million times. For Morgana's sake, you get annoyed if they touch you, let alone fuck you."
How could he do that when Potter had gone and dreamt dirty stuff about him, shouted his name in the middle of moans and other sounds that were never going to leave Draco's brain? And he'd done it after explicitly telling him that he did not want more sex with him. And then he'd gone and talked about how big of a hero he was saving people from the homicidal man that Draco worked for, which was completely un-requested information. And now Draco had to deal with that. And then ignore it. Which was really hard when he was standing in the middle of a room that was half Potter's.
Harry understood that he was not helping by being so forcefully on top of him. He slowly moved and sat down close. He helped Draco (Malfoy, Malfoy, this was Malfoy) to sit up as well, and watched as he hugged his own knees desperately. He was not crying, but it was worse. He was desperate. Harry's chest felt raw and wide open and painful. He awkwardly put a hand on his back and stroke him slowly and rhythmically.
"Because that's how fucking conversations go, Malfoy!" Harry grabbed his other arm and did not let go. Their gazes locked and daggers flew from the green to the silver eyes, back and forth. "The point of a fucking question is to get a fucking answer!"
"Is it Voldemort, Malfoy?" Harry was so close to Malfoy that he felt in his own skin how he trembled when hearing the name.
"What a pity. I'm sure that would've been an image to remember," and as Draco said that, he realised his lower body agreed fervently. Potter was cornered against the wall. He looked like a lost fawn, but he was also staring at Draco's mouth eagerly. "Maybe Gryffindors are not as brave as they claim to be."
And the fact that they hated themselves was not even a strong counterargument. Hermione remembered thinking that Malfoy's badges against Harry during the Triwizard Tournament were a bit over the top. Truth was that Malfoy was always over the top, but with Harry he seemed to go even further. If she didn't know them, she would have given the rivalry they both claimed a second thought. Hell, maybe she wouldn't have been surprised at all. In her head, Malfoy had always been a huge bigot that deserved no second thought, but Harry had always been more flexible in the way he changed his mind about people if they turned out to be decent. And Hermione trusted Harry's gut as much as she trusted her own head.
"Son of a bitch!" Ron was not laughing anymore. "Don't you dare listen to that colossal dirtbag, Harry. I cannot believe he said that."
"What the fuck, Malfoy?!" shouted Potter, getting out of bed, so that they both stood next to the Gryffindor's bed, face to face and a visceral mixture of fury and madness between them.
Harry had been scared to death when he'd found him in the forest. The dumb idiot was sitting there with just a shirt in the middle of the cold, and he'd looked so lost that Harry still couldn't get rid of the feeling of terror. So when Malfoy came out of the bathroom, still with dark shadows under his eyes and a somewhat doubtful stance, but with his hair neatly combed and glancing at Harry with the softest eyes he'd ever directed at him, Harry beamed widely.
When the night finally arrived, Draco was on edge. He felt like an addict without his drug. Not even, more like an addict that could not even consider leaving the drug in question. And it was maddening, that the drug was right there, all around him in that horrible room that had too much red and gold, and he had to
"I know that, I do," he managed to say between his clenched teeth, trying to keep a straight face. He did not want to hear it. He wanted to run and hide.
things that were not believable from what he was saying, namely the fact that the conversation that they were having before the kiss was absolutely nothing to get horny about, but he trusted that Potter was too disoriented to realise.
"Potter!" Snape called him before he could cross the door. "One more broken nose and you will be out of Hogwarts before you know it."
images. But at least Ron, as clueless as he was of what was going on in his head, didn't despise him.
Apparently, the room was loyal to them because, although they had not been there in a long time, it all seemed exactly as cosy as they had left it. Once there, Draco closed the door and enchanted it so that no one could enter, and he fell on the nest of blankets and pillows, pulling Pansy with him. She ended up on top of him, with their faces close together.
"This is my room too! And I won't have dirty Gryffindors near the place where I sleep!" shouted Malfoy again, still from the bathroom.
Draco moved his hand away. Potter's closeness burnt. And he tried to step back, but Potter grabbed his arm, and Draco was not surprised. Merlin. When had that become acceptable. Potter grabbing his arm. Potter grabbing his waist. When had it become the
"Okay, then. Let's say I don't think it is a good moment for Potty and Draco to get together now. Let's also say that I don't think either of them is doing any of this for the right reasons. And finally, a fact. They are both stupid, and if we just let them be, they are going to destroy each other."
"I know you think it's stupid. But Ron, what is he doing always alone that has him so absorbed to drop
Harry had figured out that, the moment Ron and Hermione asked, he would reply with a laugh and an obvious and ridiculing "what do you mean Malfoy and I?". That very morning, he'd practised the whole thing in front of the mirror for about thirty times in order to be as convincing as possible.
"I know that what I am going to say will sound like a wild feat to accomplish, but maybe you should just ignore him."
So, why would Malfoy wake up so early on a Saturday? What was he up to? Harry could not just forget the scene at Knockturn alley, as well as that proud conversation he had had with his friends on the train when he had innocently spied on him. And what with the
Dumbledore smiled like he always did, as if he knew something Harry did not. As always, it was infuriating.
"But I would like to!" he shouted, out of control. "I would like to help fucking Malfoy even though I know he would spit in my face if I offered!"
"I told you already. It sucks," said Harry mindlessly. He was focused on the food, and remotely considering where Malfoy might be if not in the Great Hall, where he was supposed to.
They had barely talked that year, although Pansy was still pretending in front of the whole School that she was madly in love with Draco. At some point in the fourth year, she had realised that sticking to him would be beneficial to her, and now she'd heard that he had a special task from the Dark Lord himself, which was only proof of his privileged position. So she didn't mind if the whole school believed that she was an empty headed girl that only knew how to kiss Draco's ass, when in fact, she was one of the most manipulative and powerful people at Hogwarts. Few people knew about the facade, Draco being one of those.
Everyone thought they were back to normal. Malfoy and Potter. And they had perfected their act of pretending that everything was indeed back to normal. But Harry knew that it was all as fake as Malfoy's mask. He knew that the shouts in public were a poor attempt to relief the tension. He felt in his flesh that they both kept acting out in front of unknowing spectators because they feared what could happen if they exploded in private. They feared what neither of them was willing to accept.
Potter did not chuckle at that. "I think it might be my business since it was me who had to deal with your vomits last night. I just want to know what is it going to be today."
It was none of anyone's business how much it had hurt him to watch the Quidditch match through the window, as short as it had been.
Draco stuttered a bit. There was something in Potter's face after having watched him come in his hand that was annoyingly distracting.
"Potter! Get it over with!" he shouted despite himself, hoping that, perhaps, if he waited for him to go to bed, he could sneak out of bed and take some leftovers without him noticing. There was no way Potter was going to finish everything by himself.
And everything hurt. He could not see. He could not sense anything but the pain. He loathed himself. He would rather die.
"I'll walk with you," said Ron. Without voicing it, he convinced Hermione to let them go. He would tell her everything later. Well, not everything. Ron had not told Hermione his theories about what was going on with Harry. He really wanted to, because she would know what to do. She always knew. But Malfoy had always been particularly awful to Hermione, and Ron didn't want to be there the day Harry told her he
And then Malfoy licked his lips. Wet red lips. Harry could not stop staring. Closer. He was trapped. Closer. He could not turn away. Closer.
Draco finally accepted, but only because Potter grabbed his arm again as if it was completely normal and dragged him across Hogwarts grounds into the Castle. Draco's legs hurt and he couldn't walk properly, so in the end, Potter had to basically carry him.
"Same thing," he dully answered. Draco rolled his eyes upon such lack of originality. He was not expecting any better, but at least some effort.
"If Mr. Malfoy promises to wake you up and make sure you are okay, maybe we can put some kind of silencing charm in the room."
Neither of his friends said anything, Ron because he was completely lost now, and Hermione because she was holding all her questions back in order to not interrupt. Harry waited a beat, trying to put his thoughts in order, and then he finally spoke. He told them everything. How everything was weird the moment they started sharing a room. How Malfoy had woken him up that one night that he had a nightmare. How they had dinner in silence but together. How Malfoy always arrived late in the night and left early in the morning. And then he arrived to the kiss. The first time that Malfoy had kissed him.
Malfoy pinched his leg under the table, and Harry turned to look at him. Malfoy was wearing one of his masks, but his neck was slightly pink. Nothing like it had been in the morning, but noticeable enough. Harry suppressed a smile.
"I'm sick of you! Sick, Malfoy! I will not hear judgemental and moralist preaching from a Death Eater pig like you! And much less let you mention my mother-"
"Are you going to Hogsmeade?" Malfoy asked then, with a somewhat strange voice. He took some fruit and started eating as well. He looked somewhat nervous. Harry could not bear it.
"I don't," answered Harry, and he felt the scar in his hand itch. "But it's so obvious. You are malnourished."
It had been too easy, instead of the rush of adrenaline he had been hoping for the entire week. And yet, when he burst the door open, he did not really know what to tell him. Fucking Malfoy was just sitting in a fucking
Malfoy, who had spent all the past days not touching his homework and sneaking around at unearthly times to who knows where.
"Yes, that's what you said after the first night, but you keep spending unnecessary time in that room."
McGonagall still wasn't there and Snape barely raised his eyes from what he was reading. The professor faintly nodded towards the desks, a gesture Draco promptly noticed and followed by sitting down. Harry, not as used to the subtlety of the teacher's movements, was not fast enough.
"That really sounds like you miss me, Potter." The tone was complemented with a cheeky smile now. Draco felt as if he had no control over his facial muscles, which was outrageous. He turned back to his essay, giving his back to Potter, trying to give across a message of "conversation is finished".
is just sex. I don't give a shit about you and you don't give a shit about me, but it's still sex, and you fucking liked it. I don't care if you are not able to accept that."
him, and he was right there, staring at him, wanting to get closer. And Draco could use that against him. He could use that to keep Potter distracted from his underground activities. Maybe he would get so infected with Potter's diseases that he would die before the Dark Lord could kill him. Hell. It sounded good. He could definitely do that.
"He just dreams a lot, you know?" continued Malfoy, glaring at Harry so that he would shut up. "And he shouts things that I cannot even understand. When I said that it is a living hell to share a room with him, I meant it. It is also impossible to wake him up when he is having nightmares."
When Draco literally could not find anything else to clean, he gathered enough strength to leave the toilet.
. Freaking Potter's stupid lips and whatever contagious disease he had passed on to him. Damn the moment when he
"No one is taking Quidditch away from you, Potter. You can still play. Don't get so worked up, Merlin."
And Draco was still standing there, now face to face with a sleepy and sweaty Potter. Which was an image that he was never going to forget and that would haunt him forever after.
". He moved his hands down to his waist and pulled him closer, possessively. And he desperately kissed back. Fast, hungry, dry. Just two boys too messed up to understand what they were doing.
And that was when Draco realised. He realised that Potter had completely forgotten about Katie Bell. The previous day, he had kissed Potter to distract him. He would have never thought that the distraction would last so long. And much less that Potter would be willing to
when i don't post is bc i have small breakdowns with how terrible my english is, but please bear with me
Harry tried to be serious. He had the decency to feel slightly embarrassed about his mouth's doings.
Potter was still imprisoning him against the wall, and then he got closer to bite his ear and hum: "I don't have all night, Malfoy."
So he focused his eyes on the water. Malfoy must have been laying there for a long time, because there were almost no bubbles left. He had probably fallen asleep in the water, which explained the lights being off. Harry was not looking at him, but he sensed Malfoy moving and grabbing some bath robe to cover his body. Thank God.
He did not say it, but Draco preferred to have mental breakdowns when someone was there to notice. Even if that someone was Harry Potter.
in case you haven't listened to folklore by taylor swift, there is this one song called "my tears ricochet" that gives me all the drarry vibes (in general it seems to me like a very accurate song for enemies to lovers to enemies dynamics)
At some point, Malfoy started breathing rhythmically, deeply asleep, so Harry stopped. He closed the book and left it next to the bed delicately. He was exhausted, but he smiled proudly. He'd been able to spend more than five hours on a row without fighting Malfoy. He was starting to realise that it was easy to get along with Malfoy as long as he paid him constant attention and did everything he said. Malfoy was sleeping calmly now, getting the rest he needed to get better, and he looked so peaceful that Harry had no complaints about the past five hours of being bossed around.
care about how distracting Malfoy found him, but his mouth had decided to work on its own. So now he'd said it. Something stupid to prove Malfoy's theory that he was useless at human conversations.
"She wanted to be early to DADA. She is not getting full marks, and she doesn't want to give Snape more excuses to take it out on her. Man, I hate that piece of shit. I can't put up with him."
Draco snorted because he didn't know what else to do. "Not my fault that you don't know how to perform a simple task in an efficient way."
"My eyes are green," Potter said, and Draco was petrified for a second, hearing that too loud and too clear in his head. He really didn't know what to answer to that. What was there to answer? Yes, Potter? I am a sucker for your crazy beautiful green eyes? One part of him wanted to see how Potter would react to that. Only after a few moments of utter shock, Draco realised that he was supposed to insult him for such a self-centred, narcissistic comment.
"Really, Harry? Since when do you believe shit like that? Did he kneel and vowed with the Transfiguration book on his chest? Wow, only the image is enough to make me cry."
He sat in his bed, still half dreamy about how well-rested he felt, and then he saw the book in the nightstand. Not any book, but his top-secret copy of
Draco, however, was not going to play. He had already given up his position in the Slytherin team. He had to keep his mind focused, and he had to profit from the break of having Potter out of the room. He could not get anything done when he felt him lurking around. Potter did not bring himself to ask him about his late arrivals and his early wake-ups, but he totally judged him. At times, Draco could practically see his two brain cells trying to figure out what he was up to every time they encountered.
"Okay, so you do that," ordered Hermione. "I have an idea in order to neutralize Malfoy, maybe even- Doesn't matter. Just distract him, Harry. I have to send a letter. Ron? Come with me."
No, Harry could not allow himself to be fooled by Malfoy's pretty face, and yet he hated how much effort it required for him to look past the pretty face and remember why he was supposed to not like Malfoy.
"Interpret it as you will," he said calmly, carelessly pulling his blond hair away from his face. And then he swiftly walked away.
"The plan is to be there, ready to act. To be on the watch in case we are needed. I don't know what we might or might not need to do, but this is going to get even messier in one way or another, and I normally prefer to have better control of the situations that may cause me or people close to me pain. And I will obviously feel more prepared if we can synchronise when the moment comes."
"Are you completely insane?" asked Pansy in an icy tone. "This is not a problem of who cares about whom. This is about survival and we are only children playing at a war of grown-ups. You don't understand shit of what's happening, so I ask you again, what is your game? And be very careful, Granger, because this little association ends the moment I walk out of that door."
a hand job. Me. That I have screwed you every single year at Hogwarts, that I have insulted Granger and the entire Weasley family more than I can count. I have never given you a reason to believe that I am nothing but an arsehole. And yet, you made me squirm out of pleasure. You came in my hand. Geez, we fell asleep after wanking. Together. And deny it all you want, you'd do it again. And no, Potter, I did not magically change overnight. I'm still a terrible person. I still think you are overrated.
"Pooooooooootter!" he called for the eleventh time, and Harry went to his bed for the eleventh time. The green curtains were opened, and Malfoy was laying with an exaggerated pained face expression which Harry would have dismissed without a second thought if it weren't for the sweaty forehead, the shuddering and the vomits that he'd been witnessing for hours.
Somewhere in the back of his head, Draco wondered why they had not fought. Everyone in Hogwarts had expected an open war. But they had voluntarily and spontaneously not fought.
Harry was becoming an expert at ignoring the voice in his head, especially when the voice came from outside as well.
"Not happening. Not now," he replied sharply, and he proceeded to get under his blankets and close the curtains.
of some detention! That shouldn't be allowed. What's next? Having tea with Snape?" he exclaimed indignantly.
"Well, you know," she started, "the part where you were looking him in the eye, like two inches apart, ignoring all of us and getting closer and-"
by the blonde's little adventures. It was weird that Malfoy was able to get under Harry's skin like that. It was weird, but to be fair, it was not
Harry was extremely full, so he let himself fall on his back to the ground, wanting to lay down for a little bit, eyes closed. He burped loudly. Not on purpose, mind you. Just a satisfied sound after a good meal. But Malfoy squealed in utterly indignant shock which made Harry's eyes open and stare at him, slightly embarrassed, until he broke, and started laughing loudly.
Malfoy growled with satisfaction, and they both dived into it without further thought, Katie Bell disappeared in the back of Harry's mess of a brain.
? He had far more important issues to think about, like the abhorrent task he had to carry out. Which he could not do with Harry freaking Potter two meters away. Not only due to his revoltingly
"Did you hear my nightmare?" he asked defensively as if he did not care much. The defensiveness lost power with him being all shaken and sweaty.
As it could be expected, Harry crossed the Hall in less than a pixie's blink and cornered Malfoy against the wall. Hermione and Ron sighed and followed him. Harry was barely two inches away from Malfoy and he was holding him by the collar of the shirt.
"Last year I had this dreams about Voldemort, as if I was inside his head, so I would know if someone was in danger-" Potter suddenly stopped talking as if he'd just remembered who he was talking to. "Never mind."
Draco wanted to stop trembling then, but his body didn't feel his own. Potter, who couldn't stop himself from invading his personal space, held Draco's hands trying to stop them from moving uncontrollably. "Goodness, you are freezing. How long have you been sitting out here, you fool?"
Naturally, everyone knew. The Great Hall was buzzing with rumours and theories on the matter. It had happened in Hogsmeade, they said. Katie Bell, the Chaser of Gryffindor. Who could have? She is such a great girl. Yeah, who could have? Some talked about an angry ex, others about Death Eaters. Some came close to reality, they mentioned something about a hexed object Katie had accidentally touched, whereas others insisted that it was just a butterbeer intoxication.
"Harry, where does he go when he is not in your room or in class?" asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. Harry also ignored Ron.
hehehe I am not the best with fixed deadlines, but i hope you like this one, pls tell me what do you think!!
Draco stood up, taking the hand of the girl, and he dragged her out of Slytherin, all the way to their room, a small corner lost in the maze that Hogwarts was. It was barely a room, completely empty and not even painted, it had no windows and its door was barely visible. The previous year, they had made it their own with a couple of big blankets and some pillows, and a candlelight fluttered in a corner for light and warmth. It was the only place where they almost acted like friends, where their calculated relationship stretched into a more irrational companionship in which they honestly liked each other beyond the benefits and the costs.
"I don't want to prove anything," Draco said instead. "I don't need to prove anything, and specially not to you. But you are totally obsessed with me, which you keep denying, and it is embarrassing, to be honest. Did you realise that you call me prince? Like who does that?"
Draco smiled, looking at the ceiling. He was not tired at all, but going to bed early was better than enduring the unsettling interactions he kept having with Potter. He could still hear him, though, and he was not able to figure out what the hell he was doing. It didn't smell like food, so maybe it was homework. Draco was just slightly curious about what it was, the healthy kind of curiosity that occupied a healthy amount of space in his head.
"What?! When?" and Harry realised the moment he said it, that he'd fucked up. "Shit, NO! That's not what I meant."
Malfoy's blond hair was messy, all around his head, and his cheeks were pink because of the fever, and Harry thought that it was not fair that even at his worse, he still managed to look like a fucking prince. Could it be true? What Malfoy had said about not despising muggles? Could it be that his views of the world were more than a copy of his father's? But what were his views then? After all, he'd heard Malfoy call Hermione names too often, and even if there were some decent, smart beliefs buried somewhere inside him, Harry couldn't just erase years of insults against both Ron and Hermione. Not to mention Katie's almost murder.
Draco hated to be alone. Alone with himself. It was disgusting to be left with such a despicable excuse of a person. He despised himself.
"Then what's the point?!" he bellowed, and the random students that were walking around them changed directions. "What is the fucking point of being Harry Potter if I cannot help anyone?!"
"What's the meaning of this disaster, Potter?!" he asked, his voice trembling in a weird mixture of emotions, among which he wanted to underline the anger. "I thought we'd agreed on cleaning everything after every use.
"Yes. Of course. He didn't admit it, obviously. But I'm certain. It's just- It's just that I don't know what am I supposed to do- I don't even think he did it on purpose-"
. The maniac psychopathic serpent daunted him. He could not close his eyes without picturing with cruel accuracy his red eyes looking back. He hated it, the feeling that He was watching him, that He knew what and how he was doing. That it was all a sadistic test that he was doomed to fail because his father had failed before him.
"Okay, so I guess you are good," Potter said. His voice sounded velvety, with a kindness that would be unbearable to ignore now that Draco knew it existed. "I will leave some food and water here for when you wake up, okay? Sleep well, Malfoy."
He grabbed his wand, and slowly went out of his bed. He could not even look at Potter, because he knew he was going to lose his shit the moment he did. He saw the flooded bathroom, the completely destroyed room, and managed to not pronounce a single word. Moving cautiously, he threw cleaning spells here and there and returned the place to its original state. Only then, he turned to Potter, to discover not only that he had been mockingly observing how he cleaned his mess, but that he was not even dressed.
Harry realised, probably too late, that Malfoy was having a panic attack. And he didn't know what to do with it.
He heard with blatant clarity how Potter swallowed. A disturbing long gulp, like a freaking giraffe.
"I don't need you to like me, Potter. I'm just pointing out how hypocrite of you it is to deny that you obviously want to come closer."
"I'm sure you can," he muttered. Maybe that was the problem. Maybe he just needed to get rid of the hormones to forget about Potter. Maybe the weird Gryffindor disease that made him needy and broke his rational thoughts would be satisfied with a different person.
chewing noises, but because Harry Potter represented all that he was supposed to hate. All the reasons why he had to do what he had to do.
"It takes a lot of entitlement to judge people like that. Are you even listening? Do you want me to spell it for you how ridiculously clueless you are?"
The room was silent for a while. It was so silent that they could both hear the breathing of the other, which is how they knew that they were both wide awake. And suddenly, it didn't appear as such a genius idea to have the lights off, because Draco still knew that Potter was a few feet away, he could somehow feel Potter's breath under his skin, and the darkness made the tingling in all his cells more intimate and far more undeniable. Something that he just could not ignore.
"Of course not, Potter. I cannot be mad about something that is so not surprising. Believe me, your complete lack of manners was expected. It is hard for me to picture how can a small beast like you go around without any consideration for the rest of the world and..."
"It's simple, Potter. I have physical needs. Please, don't think that I care about you. You are extremely uninteresting, and you are not particularly hot either," he lied without hesitation. "But you are a guy, and I happen to like guys."
"Well, we don't know that. And even if he is not a Death Eater, his family is, and he might want to do anything to be in the good side of Voldemort."
"You wouldn't, Dray! That lady is a blessing for the house, and for my sight too. You know what an excellent cook she is, but she is also an expert eater..."
"But I also don't understand, Ron! I cannot get my mind around this whole mess! I don't understand why on Earth did I ever kiss that bastard! Or why do I want to do it again-"
Ron was blocking her mouth again, and he did not even realise how close he was standing against her. But Hermione did, and she felt her knees weak. She nodded, not because she was impressed by Ron's threat, but because she needed him to back off if she wanted to be able to ever think rationally again.

"We are barely inside the Forest, Potter. The Castle is right there. And you are here too. Why would the danger bother me more than you?"
It was then when Draco noticed the scar. From such a short distance, it was as if he had never seen it before. From afar, it seemed like a clean cut, but it was in fact ugly, as if it had been forcefully sewed together. It spread through Potter's forehead like a disease, and it seemed cold and dark. Dead. Draco could feel the evil magic that had caused that scar. In contrast, his green eyes were wildly alive, transparent to all that he was feeling at the moment. Anger, annoyance, and what was that right there? Surprise? Understanding? Pity? Potter could not
It was Potter's turn not to know what to say. Or maybe he knew, but he was holding it for some reason.
Neither of them apologised, but before they closed their curtains, they exchanged one fast look. There was some complicity in that look, some unspoken understanding, and some relief because maybe and only maybe, it was not that bad to share a room.
"What Potter means," he told the teachers, "is that I need to shout if I want to wake him up. And I might not always be very gentle, but I'm sure you can understand how annoying it can be to wake up every night to shouting and screaming."
Not surprisingly, Harry was paying absolutely zero attention to the class, so he was sure he had heard wrong.Â But then everyone around him started moving, changing spots and walking towards their assigned partner for the exercise. Harry shook his head, trying to wake up, and he discovered Malfoy staring furiously at him.Â Unbelievable.
"Oh, can you?" and Draco kissed him again. Potter seemed to be fighting something in his head, but he did not push him away. Instead, he opened his mouth right when Draco stopped the kiss. "Real control of the situation you've got there, Potter. I admire it."
Potter laughed, tilting his head, too satisfied about how well his stupid strategy to attract his attention had worked. The big headed, self-centred, disgraceful idiot. With his stupid little towel hanging from his stupid waist.
"Don't ask me. She will kill me if I take away from her the first real conversation with you in weeks."
He remembered Dobby. He called him. After hardly ten seconds, there were plenty of dishes around the room. It was
And Potter seemed to get encouraged by the sounds, because he kissed harder, he rubbed harder against him. And Draco shouted something that sounded awfully like "POtter". And he didn't think when he put his hands inside Potter's pants. But touching his ass directly had to be too much for Potter. And, apparently, for Potter too much was not good. Because he abruptly backed away. And Draco will deny that he groaned disappointingly, but he did.
And Malfoy grabbed Harry's face like he owned it, and joined their mouths aggressively. Harry kissed back for two glorious seconds before he pushed him away.
Like Harry Potter with his muggle-born mother. Draco had known since he was seven all the facts about Harry Potter, including the fact that Lily Potter had been one of the best witches in the Wizarding World.
Maybe it was he who was having a nightmare. Yep, it had to be a nightmare. There was no way this was happening in real life.
Malfoy stood up quickly, almost messily. He was still red. Harry stopped him by standing up as well and grabbing his arm, as it had started to be normal between them.
It did not help to have the Chosen One close while he was trying to keep his family alive. Potter had always behaved in a righteous manner that personally made him sick, but it was worse now that Draco actually had to do something objectively reprehensible. That's why, right before they opened the door of the office where the meeting was taking place, he broke the silence.
Draco's thoughts were racing. A dare could work much better as a distraction, particularly for a Gryffindor as Harry Potter. It was perfect, because it would keep Potter close, and they would not need to find excuses to keep doing whatever they were doing. But how to phrase the fact that he wanted to get in Potter's pants as a dare?
Then Draco thought that maybe his insomnia would be more productive if he went to work on the Vanishing Cabinet. It took him some more time to actually stand up, but eventually, he silently grabbed his wand and walked towards the door. No one would be awake to care if he was walking around the castle in silk pyjamas.
He sat down strategically, in the spot that was furthest away from Harry, waiting for their teachers, who were probably looking for each other. They did not say a thing for a while. Some hateful looks were sent across the room, but both managed to not say anything, to avoid the imminent conflict. Harry was very conscious of the Slytherin at the other side of the room. There he was. The smug bastard, seating as if he owned the place. Breathing as if the air around him was not worthy of his lungs.
Potter was crying. He could not see him, but he knew. The words came out strangled, suffocated by hollers and bitterness. It made something in Draco's chest hurt like hell, something that had not yet been hurt.
Draco had his arms on both sides of Potter's head, and his whole body was inclined against him, although not touching him yet. All in Potter's face shouted "do it". His green eyes shined intensely and they did horrible things to Draco's insides. One second they melted his guts, and the next they made him so hard it hurt. Potter did not know what to answer, but he licked his lips. He was telling him that he was not going to give in.
Harry wished he could tell them. But what would he say? Malfoy kissed me. He fucking kissed me. No reason at all. He grabbed my fucking face and kissed me. And that wasn't even the worst part. He could not even articulate in his head what the worst part was.
When he arrived to the room he shared with Potter, he was exhausted. But he needed to get at least a couple hours of sleep if he did not want to collapse while he carried out the most stupid assassination attempt ever. It was around four in the morning, so he was not expecting to find Potter awake. But there he was. Having breakfast in the floor. At four AM.
"Ha, Potter." Draco didn't know where he was getting the energy to act as if he was not going to vaporise right there right now. "You? Entertain me? You would never be able to stand on my level."
without one of them being hexed- in fact, it was more than that, they had even joked around with each other. Hell, he didnât think Malfoy had a sense of humour until before now. Ronâs brain would explode when he told him.
âI want to study Law,â Parkison told them boldly. âI think we can all agree that the wizengamotÂ is in desperate need of updating. And Blaise here may or may not have already been approached by a certain branch of the Ministry, but he canât say more than that.â
"Harry, my dear boy." He jumped at the sound, turning to the massive painting of Dumbledore who was smiling jovially at him. He could feel a lump forming in his throat and blinked back the unwelcome tears now prickling in his corner of his eyes at the sight of his old headteacher.
Hermione looked vaguely scandalised whilst Neville turned a brilliant shade of pillar-box red. Everyone knew he nursed a soft spot for Luna, who had turned him down gracefully at the start of the summer, saying that she couldn't possibly be in a relationship at that time and besides, Hannah Abbot was interested in him. Neville had taken it fairly well, and last Harry had heard, he'd been writing to Hannah all through the holidays.
He repeated like a mantra, focusing all of his attention instead on the water. The feeling of it between his toes, the rays of sun on his back. The surface rippled and he knew Malfoy was there too, that heâd finally managed to enter Harryâs mind.
"Ron, if I find you or Dean rummaging through my trunk, there will be hell to pay." He threatened with as much dignity as he could muster.
"I'm sure the only sleepwalking Mr Weasley will be doing this year will be to Miss Grangers room, and as for you Potter- well I trust you and Mr Malfoy will be able to put your differences aside for the remainder of the year. Don't let the door hit you on the way out."
Upon voicing this particular theory to Ron, the redhead had just shrugged, before saying through mouthfuls of chicken, "Probably mate. You know what the house-elves are like- they all idolise you down there."
"Yeah that's right. Matthew Bulstrode. I heard Pansy talking to Millicent about it last night. I'm not entirely sure what happened but I have an awful suspicion it might have been Greyback."
He'd found himself reading the letter over and over again in the days that followed as if trying to uncover some deeper meaning. But each time, his frustration would grow. It was just so hollow and superficial. He didn't know what he was expecting- an apology maybe? An explanation? He knew he was being stupid, this was just exactly the sort of thing Malfoy would do. He could practically hear his snobby voice echoing off the parchment.
âI can neither confirm nor deny that.â He told her, but there was a telling glint in his eye. âI wouldnât be surprised to see you running for Minister in the next couple of years Granger.â
"Behind me are the room lists. If you have any complaints please take it up with me personally. As all of you are of age, you will be granted certain privileges which I expect you not to abuse."
"I dunno mate, the poor lad was basically shitting himself with joy." Ron chortled. "Looks like you've got another admirer. I'll be sure to tell Ginny she's got some competition."
"I believe they're worried about you being taken advantage of. Being a legillimens would allow youÂ  to uncover the true motives behind certain individuals action. I really must agree with them, it's a wonderful tool."
I knew Gryffindors werenât very bright but you really take the cake.â Harry bristled in annoyance and Malfoy rolled his eyes. âThere are multiple different variations of vows. We could try a simple tongue-tying one or speak me-not.â
âWe were just discussing our plans for after school.â Luna dressed them with a strange sort of familiarity, and Harry realised that this wasnât her first conversation with the trio, if the fond look in Malfoyâs eye was anything to go by. âWhat are you lot thinking of doing?â
"They did but I didn't think much of them to be honest." He didn't bother disguising his frown and she looked rather amused.
"Have you heard from the others much? Greg's in hiding up in Russia with his mother." He changed the subject before Pansy could inflict her wrath. "I'm not sure what they're expecting. It'll only be a matter of time before the ministry tracks him down."
However, what he was not expecting to see, was Draco Malfoy strolling in, glancing around the classroom with a critical eye.
The confession hung in the air for a couple of seconds, heavy and poignant before Harry spoke again. âLook Malfoy, no offence but youâre probably the last person Iâd want to do this with, I donât fancy laying myself bare in front of you." There was a slight pink flush to Malfoys cheeks, and he realised a moment too late how that may have sounded like an innuendo. âI just mean, itâs supposed to be pretty personal.â He said desperately, the room suddenly feeling too hot.
"Yeah they're probably looking at pictures of first years being tortured or something." Weasley spat, and the atmosphere changed in a heartbeat. The room suddenly felt very cold and he felt Pansy stiffen by his side.
"Well, there's certainly no need to sound so disappointed Granger." They whirled around to where Pansy Parkison was stood, eyes glittering mischievously. "I'm sure we'll have a wail of a time."
Dracoâs blood went cold, his heart hammering with panic and bile began to rise in his throat. He was trapped again, trapped like a canary in a coal mine or a sparrow in a vanishing cabinet.
"Of course you'd remember that Albus." She scolded him slightly, but Harry didn't miss the fondness in her voice.
âTalk about what Potter?â Malfoy said, so offhandedly that Harry would think they had just witnessed a completely different thing if it wasnât for the way that Malfoyâs handâs were shaking slightly.
It was a movement which Hermione clearly didn't miss, tugging his arm back. "Come on Harry, let's try to have a year free from Malfoy obsession."
âTrust me, Potter. Itâll be worse for me than it is for you. Youâll be practising in my head after all.â Malfoy assured him, and he couldnât help but feel a slight bolt of curiosity at the idea of seeing some of the things Malfoy might keep hidden. âI suggest that we both make a vow, so we canât tell anyone else anything that we may see in the other's mind to someone else.â
With his other hand, Malfoy took out his wand and muttered something low in latin under his breath. A silvery-white thread moved from the tip of the wand and down to their clasped arms, wrapping itself around them, binding the two together.
It was their third session and Harry was no closer at getting into Malfoyâs mind than he had been to start with. In a desperate effort to make it work, Malfoy had suggested that they changed tactics and that he should try to use Legillimency on Harry instead, so the boy would experience the sensation and how it was
A little while later, Harry bid Ron and Hermione goodnight before heading up to bed. Terry and Anthony were sitting together on the other side of the room, heads bent together in a whispered conversation. Malfoy was splayed out on a bed near Harry's with Zabini. He broke off whatever he was saying when he saw Harry walk into the room, his expression changing into one of blank indifference. Zabini on the other hand broke into a shit-eating grin.
Hermione went pink. âWell yes, thatâs the plan hopefully. Ron and I are thinking of renting a flat in London so weâll be closer.â
âOh Merlin I knew this was going to happen at some point, but do we really need to do it now?â Harry didnât answer and he let out a long sigh. âAlright then. No point in delaying the inevitable I
"You can say that again." Harry mumbled, slumping back in his chair. "Why do they need me to learn it anyway?"
Harry nodded slowly at the suggestion, testing out the idea in his head. âYeah alright. That could work actually.â
There was a moment of silence before Ron interrupted it with a sudden thought. "Wait, surely Malfoy's not back?"
"Whatever you say, mate." Ron sighed, helping himself to a spoonful of peas. "I'm just not looking for a repeat of sixth year."
âBloody hell itâs about time.â Ron said, momentarily forgetting his animosity towards Parkinson. âThose two have been dancing around each other for ages.â
Seamus and Dean took great pleasure in teasing him about the teachers blatant display of favouritism but Harry was secretly suspicious that she was trying to train him up as the next defence teacher. Heâd be lying if he said the idea wasnât tempting, heâd forgotten the way it felt to teach, to see when someone finally managed the spell theyâd be struggling with or the adrenaline which flowed through him during a duel. Maybe he was missing the DA more than he had realised.
âArenât you that kid who trailed around after me all of sixth year?â He drawled, with as much dignity one can muster when pinned to a wall. âLike a little puppy?â
"What the fuck did you just say?" Millies voice was like ice and Draco remembered with a jolt that she had lost her little brother in the war.
Harry was relieved to find his room empty when he arrived. It was fairly large, with five just five beds and to his delight, the ceiling had been enchanted to show the night sky, much like in the great hall. He chose the bed nearest to the window, showcasing a spectacular view over the grounds.
Apart from this, Hogwarts felt relatively the same. It had undergone months worth of magical construction over the summer to undo the damage that was caused during the battle. A task Harry has assumed would be simple enough, but Hermione had explained in depth that Hogwarts magical core had been damaged and it would take more than a few mere repairos to bring the castle back its former glory.
Upon closer inspection, he realised it was Parkison, Zabini and Malfoy. Malfoyâs face was flushed from the cold and he was wearing a grey woollen hat which pushed his blonde hair down. If Harry didnât know who he was, heâd think that the boy looked almost innocent. He shook his head, as though trying to rid his mind of these thoughts. He blamed the alcohol for making him think about things he really didnât want to think about.
"Sorry," He said, clearing his throat, "zoned out. So shall we take bets on which teacher will try to kill me this year?"
"I'll be fine Ron!" He heard Granger hiss from the other side of the classroom and he repressed the desire to roll his eyes. If anyone was in danger, it was him- his nose still hadn't recovered from it's meeting with the girls fist.
Dumbledore's eyes twinkled and he chuckled. "Hufflepuff if I remember correctly? He's the one who tripped over his own feet during the sorting ceremony."
It had been Ron and Hermione of course, who'd convinced him to go back. They'd just been so excited, buying robes and books in Diagon alley like first years and the enthusiasm was catching. He'd found himself buying a new set of quills-
At this, Harry really did choke on his tea and waved for Malfoy to continue whilst he attempted to stop coughing.
Malfoy let out a sigh of relief at the prospect of finally getting somewhere. âThank Merlin for that. You should choose the word, youâll be more likely to remember it if itâs personal to you.â
Ron had remained unusually tight-lipped over this new development and Harry and a slight suspicion that Hermione may have given him a lecture on how she was perfectly capable of making her own friends.
âWhy did you do it?â Harryâs voice didnât sound angry, just weary and Malfoy shifted in his seat awkwardly.
Harry suddenly felt a random burst of resentment towards Luna and Malfoy. So he'd taken the time to apologise to her? And not him? How many more of his friends were secretly bonding with Malfoy?
"Now that your friends have established that I'm not about to hex you, can we continue?" He asked her, busying himself with setting out the ingredients for dreamless sleep so as to avoid looking at her face.
She smiled sympathetically. "Chin up Potter, it's nothing too awful. They simply want you to be trained further in Legillimency."
was slowly beginning to die down but every so often, some kid would pluck up the courage to ask them a question about the war and then in minutes, they would be surrounded by the rest of them, all pushing and shoving each other for a chance to catch the golden trioâs-
âIt wouldnât work Harry. I mean, almost everyone can be taught basic Occlumency but Legilimency is far more complex and itâs rare for someone to be able to master it. They probably think you could can handle it because of the link between you and Voldemort.â She explained.
"Oh, I've heard of her! She played for the Hollyhead Harpies before becoming a teacher!" Ginny exclaimed, looking at the new professor starry eyed.
Toby jumped and flushed red. "Sorry Sir! Professor McGonagall sent me to find you. She wants you to come to her office."
"Draco darling, please relax. I can just feel the tension radiating off of you." Pansy sighed, twisting her manicured fingers through his hair.
Harry had no idea to say, his throat felt like it had closed up. The whole situation was bizarre and he wondered for a second if he'd accidentally walked into an alternative reality. He'd never said more than five words to Zabini before this point but now the boy was acting although they were lifelong friends.
Hermioneâs tentative new friendship with the Slytherins had surprised them all. It had begun with forced politeness but quickly moved into the realms of small talk and smiles when they bumped into each other in the corridor. Parkison seemed to have bonded with her over also being the only girl in a group of boys and now it wasnât uncommon to see the two chatting amicably together or gossiping in a corner.
âThat soundâs about right.â He checked the expensive-looking watch on his wrist. âIâd better go, next week I thought we could start testing your Oclomency shields. I know Severus taught you the basics.â
Draco had always been good at potions. Perhaps it was natural talent or the way Severus had been training him since he could carry a cauldron, but he'd always had an affinity to the subject. The only person who'd ever even gotten close to rivalling his grades was Granger. Perhaps that was why Skyes had thought it would be prudent to pair the two of them up.
Blaise chuckled. "It's a shame we're not rallying against them this year. I feel a second verse of Weasley is our king just bursting out of me."
In the end and after much careful deliberation, they decided on treacle tart for the safe word. Harry had attempted to justify this by explaining that it was his favourite dessert, to which Malfoyâs expression had become unreadable and he muttered, â
Blaise caches on and diverts the conversation to safer territory, giving Draco a moment to breathe in relief.
There was a beat of silence as the other boy seemed to be floundering for the right words. âWhen Voldemort lives in your house for a year,â He said slowly, and Harry was surprised to hear the use of his real name, as opposed to You-Know-Who. âYou tend to want to keep certain things private, certain things he might choose to
âLook who just came in!â Dean whispered loudly, nodding towards the door where three people stood together.
Draco snorted, "How shocking." Pansy flicked him angrily and he subsided. "Okay, okay. Sorry. Carry on."
Malfoy took it firmly, holding him by the forearm and Harry did the same, trying desperately to ignore the tingles which exploded in his arm when he did, like a thousand tiny electric shocks. It was utterly bizarre and he couldnât help but wonder if Malfoy could see it too. He chanced a look up at the blonde boy, who seemed to be determinedly ignoring him but the tips of his ears had gone very red.
âI know.â She agreed animatedly. âI thought I was going to have to lock them in a cupboard if I saw them making those doe eyes at each other one more time. â
Ron blushed and preoccupied himself with scanning around the library. âOh, Parkisonâs over there, I think sheâs looking for you Mione.â
"It's fine Pans. You can say his name don't worry- I'm over it, really." He can't stand her sympathetic gaze, she means well but he's not ready to talk about Theo. Not yet.
The way he said it was almost teasing, lacking in his usual venom. Heâd only ever heard Malfoy talk that way to his friends, so to have it directed at him made Harry feel slightly off-kilter.
"Granger." He greeted stiffly as she approached, all too aware of the green eyes next to Weasley boring into him. Granger had also noticed the staring and gave both boys a glare which could strike fear into even Voldemort's cold dead heart. Potter flushed and looked away, whereas Weasley just shot him a warning look, as though daring him to start anything.
"Well, second cousin maybe? I'm not too sure. All pureblood families are so intercrossed these days."
However, it was most widely believed that Draco and Pansy would marry once they left school and pop out some perfect pureblood heirs. They'd tried dating around the fourth year, but that also happened to be the year of Draco's big gay crisis and needless to say, it didn't work out. In the aftermath, he and Blaise had fooled around a couple of times but nothing ever came of it. The three of them were just too close, dating seemed incomprehensible.
He was an odd one, Harry had never been quite able to work him out. He had assumed that Malfoy would only befriend those whose families were avid supporters of Voldemort but Zabiniâs family had remained neutral during the war and the handsome dark-skinned boy was rarely seen away from Malfoyâs side.
âI do.â The thread glowed brightly for a second, before disappearing once again. They stayed together for a moment before pulling their arms away at the same time, looking slightly sheepish.
He waved his wand a small table appeared between the two of them, complete with two steaming mugs and a plate of sugared biscuits. Malfoy took a sip and raised an eyebrow when Harry made no move to drink it.
He ignored her, instead leaning down to whisper in Dracoâs ear. âYou better look out scum, because when no oneâs watching, Iâm going to rip you to fucking shreds.â
One by one they entered, standing in front of the mirror which would turn milky at their reflection before swinging open to allow them access.
Harry had the feeling that he was on the losing side of this particular battle and sighed heavily. "Fine. But who would teach me anyway?"
Ron's eyes widened in understanding whilst Harry twisted in his seat, craning his head towards the Slytherin table instinctively searching for a glimpse of white hair.
The last time he'd seen him was across the courtroom at his trial. Malfoy had looked younger than he'd done in years, his face pale and hollow with dark circles under his eyes as though he hadn't sleep in days. There was something haunted in his expression, Sirius had it too. It was the look of someone who'd spend too long in Azkaban.
âOh just peachy.â Parkison replied breezily. âI just thought I would warn you against going back to our room anytime soon. Hannah and Longbottom were looking pretty cosy and I dread to think what you might walk in on.â
Harry snorted and she sent him a coy smile. âPotter. Howâs being the saviour of the wizarding world treating you??â
Harry settled in the chair, relaxing his mind as best he could. He began to visualise a lake, cool and glittering when the sun hit it at certain angles. Malfoy had explained to him earlier that it helped to create a space for your mind to go to when starting out, like a waiting room between your thoughts. If anything went wrong, that was the place to go back to.
However, this new method was to no avail. Each time the blonde tried to delve into Harryâs mind, his instincts kicked in and it was as if his brain built up a brick wall, violently pushing Malfoy out.
"And Professor Bellamy who has arrived fresh from Beaubatons to fill our post as defence against the dark arts teacher and head of Slytherin house." A smaller curvy woman with auburn hair and olive skin smiled out at them, giving a little wave. She looked young, mid to late twenties and Harry couldn't help but be surprised that she was already being given such a high ranking job. '
It was that look which had motivated Harry to testify for Draco. He didn't want it becoming permanent.
"I wonder if we're going to have to hire bodyguards for Harry this year." Ginny teased, "So he doesn't get mobbed by first years every time he tries to take a piss or eat a sandwich.
He wished it didn't hurt as much as it did. He'd never been in love with Theo, he was more of a glorious distraction when things were bad, but seeing him with the leggy blonde felt like a betrayal. Pansy had once pointed out that Daphne was basically Draco in girl form, just with tits and minus the personality.
under his breath whilst Pansy shot him a wry smile. âDarling, how wonderful, McGonagall would pass out with joy if she saw this display of inter-house unity.â Her eyes narrowed at Zabini slightly. âAlthough we seem to be missing someone. Please tell me Dracoâs not being cornered by Smith again.â
His cronies laughed like this was the wittiest thing theyâd ever heard and fought the urge to retort that
Malfoy rolled his eyes again and Harry had a sneaking suspicion that it was becoming a habit. âYes, yes, okay. Now give me your arm.â
âWhat aboutâ¦â Harryâs brain went blank for a second before something popped into his head and he grinned. ââ¦Ferret has a nice ring too it donât you think?â
A few carriages down sat Draco Malfoy himself, stretched out across the plush velvet seats with his head in Pansy Parkinson's lap. Blaise Zabini occupied the other side, leisurely resting his long legs on Draco.
Malfoy! Iâve been focusing this whole bloody time!â Harry bit back furiously, the frustration that had been slowly building inside of him for the past hour finally reaching breaking point. âDid you ever think that maybe itâs your fault not mine?â
âYou didnât hate me?â Harry asked curiously at the last part and Malfoy blushed, suddenly very interested at picking at his sleeve.
"You've got to be joking!" Ron groaned next to him and Harry saw that Ron was sharing with Dean Thomas, Theodore Nott, Ernie Macmillan and Micheal Corner.
He knew full well that if he disclosed his true motivations behind the switch -Malfoy- McGonagall would simply roll her eyes and roll off some speech about the past being in the past.
The three of them have always been inseparable, ever since a five-year-old Pansy had marched up to Draco during a stuffy sacred twenty-eight party and introduced herself with Blaise trailing around after her, already batting his long eyelashes at whoever took his fancy. After that night, barely a week went by without the three of them seeing each other.
He had spent the entire afternoon celebrating with his housemates the victory over Gryffindor â something that hadn't happened in a long time â and crowning who has been the best Slytherin hunter in recent years; the Harry from the other dimension turned out to be a gem, impressing more than one with today's performance, scoring point after point with mastery. Although they already knew he was very good - the workouts with him were devastating, he always pushed them to the limit of endurance - he proved that he was the best Potter on the Quidditch pitch.
He saw the doubt on his face, the intrigue of a bet on his ego as a seeker of the Gryffindor house, a staunch enemy of Slytherin and a classic that all Hogwarts liked to see. It was a wonderful opportunity to prove to be the best again.
Draco's face broke again, feeling the cadence of his pelvis desecrating him over and over again. She reached out to kiss him, wanting to seal their pact with the purest act he could offer; He remembered the first time he kissed him, on his bed, feeling just a little of the sweet honey from his lips ... and now, he even bite hard at those places that were kissed by other people, erasing any trace of them, leaving only marks of love for him.
A rebellious and defiant look that looked at Draco with incredible affection, covered by a cape with the embroidery of the Slytherin house. He saw him smile at Draco and then turn to look at him, completely changing the brightness of his eyes to a dull one that reflected obvious disdain.
"I won't be able to stay long," said the blonde, although he entered the compartment with his head held high anyway, "they're waiting for me somewhere else." When his eyes fell on Ron, Harry avoided the next sentence that he was pretty sure was going to to say, slamming the door. Both children were staring at him, and Harry returned to his seat.
"Is the interrogation over?" Draco was looking at Harry with those silver eyes that reflected genuine concern for him. It was not normal for a conversation between them to be more than two dialogues before moving on to the exchange of unnecessary magic.
It was frustrating â not to say pathetic â the effort he made to push away the memories of six nights ago, for with memories so fleeting, he could perfectly recreate it in his mind; he felt every breath of air that Harry blew over his body, every brush of his callused hands and his lips running over his skin.
He released all the air that was contained. Soon, he felt the heaviness come to his body again; he felt tired. He didn't want to admit it, but she was right. It was necessary for her to clarify her feelings.
Draco released him slowly, returning his heart and the sweatshirt that still hung on one of his shoulders.
When he saw Draco, his mind was flooded with images of Draco bloodied in the bathroom in his seventh year, the look of despair and utter fear when he had to kill Dumbledore, the resigned look when he believed that Harry would let him die in the cursed fire. in the Room of Requirement. They weren't thoughts about a stupid supremacist kid, a rich kid who treated anyone but his 'select' group of friends badly, who despised anyone who wasn't a Slytherin. He only thought of a teenager whose world took a 180 degree turn, who relied on the wrong words of someone he admired and trusted.
"Ah, don't worry, these are props, I have good vision," said Harry Slytherin, putting the old-fashioned round glasses in his cape pocket. And I'd rather be called just Harry, and the other one to be Potter, to avoid confusion.
At least that was until recently. When in Defense Against the Dark Arts class, his eyes literally met the emerald irises of his Slytherin counterpart and he saw in them a streak of evil, and then a provocative smile on his face; soon, his gaze traveled to the other Harry's hands, who rested them on Draco's thigh ...
"You have a headache because you haven't eaten in at least six hours," Harry answered, undressing completely uninhibited. Eat it, it will help you.
He pinched the bridge of his nose, pushing to clear away the irrational ideas cascading through his mind.
But it wasn't long before all those ideas were completely gone when the Harry Slytherin took it upon himself to spoil him to death, to be there to distract him when he woke up at three in the morning to the nightmares that haunted him, or his Afternoons without hunger when he gave her a sandwich that was smuggled in the library, and even, in the silence of a room in the dungeons where the only sounds came from the turbulent water of the black lake crashing against the window.
But everything changed that day. It was a Friday, it was dinner time in the great hall and all the students were enjoying a large feast.
"Normal, I guess," Draco answered quite seriously. He immediately stiffened and returned to his nervous state that he used to have these days.
The training he had with the Slytherins in his house was enough for him to know that Malfoy was a person with good command of the broom; it was still a rough diamond, but the brilliance for which it stood out, did not ask anything of any seeker.
-Yes. Harry was loosening his grip on Draco, until he just slid his hand down the other's arm and gently stroked the wrist. Just don't use it again.
As she served the food carefully (the food was not to blame for her discomfort towards her relatives), she briefly thought that she could stay at Tom's until the start of classes. It assumes that you have already served enough time in that house for the protection barriers, which by the way, something else to study.
For example, the Harry Gryffindor in front of him firmly believed that, in Quidditch, the job of seeker was the most important. Surely in the past, it was he who led the Gryffindor house to the victory of the student cup. In that case, she couldn't judge him for thinking like that, but he doesn't agree with it either.
"Tell me, Saint Potter," said Draco softly. "If your parents were alive, wouldn't you do whatever you had to to prevent them from dying?"
"Can you walk faster?" reprimanded Hermione impatiently. "We are late for Charms and Ron is still waiting for us in the Great Hall."
Draco breathed dangerously, slowly, trying to control his anger. Who the hell did he think he was? He knew Potter was annoying and big-headed and just plain terrible, but Draco was not asking for much. Just for him to stay still. For some minutes. Simple civility.
"How romantic, " joked Ron. "But that sounds fake, mate. Really, Malfoy is disgusting, but people don't just kiss others because they are nearby when they are horny. It's the biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard."
"He is just suspicious, okay? He is up to something, and I cannot really get it out of my mind. He keeps going to the Room of Requirements. Alone. And stays there for hours."
"Hey, hey. Come on, 'Mione, you are spiralling. It is a lot of information, I know, but it is all speculation for now. Maybe you are right and I saw something that was not there and they were slapping the hell out of each other until their faces were red."
He really did not want to face him right now, so he barely opened his eyes to answer: "Obviously". Through his squinted eyelids, he saw Potter doubting for a second.
"I just don't buy it, you know? I can't believe that he doesn't care. He is constantly on edge. His- His masks, they don't work anymore. He used to be so good at pretending he was above everybody else- And now he cannot. It's like the masks break before he can use them. As if he didn't have the energy to put them on anymore."
"I cannot, because let me remind you that we are grounded for life. Together. And I swear I will go nuts if you keep doing this shit of not sleeping, and not eating. You don't study, you drop Quidditch, you have gotten thinner and paler and I don't know-"
"He takes every chance he gets to insult us. He has always thought he is better because he has money. And he has told really bad stuff to 'Mione."
Possibly because of how close they stood, Harry's attention had gotten sidetracked by those silver irises that once again masked everything that passed through his mind. Malfoy's face told him that he despised him with all he had and Harry felt his stomach grow heavy.
When they woke up again on Sunday morning, the room was a mess. Harry's stuff was all over the green side, and vice versa. It was almost hard to tell which part was supposed to be which, until the boys came out of bed at the same time.
"You might not talk to each other, but I think that we can all agree that shouting in the night is not a sign of you two doing well enough," said McGonagall.
"You know what I mean." And as Draco's stance grew more powerful, Potter doubted and became smaller.
Well, at least they still had Quidditch. That remained constant, the fact that he could still confront Malfoy up in the sky and forget about their current living situation.
"Are you sure? I would personally be puking all around if I had to share a room with that Slytherin scum," said Ron, sympathetically patting his back.
Harry was right, and Malfoy readily removed the leg that he had used to unsuccessfully try to keep balance when they were falling.Â Harry did not move, though.
"And you think you do?" asked Harry mockingly. Malfoy squinted at him from behind his emotionless mask. "Controlling and hiding you emotions are different things, prince."
"What do you know? You don't know me, Potter! You don't know shit! Let! Me! Go!" he yelled, violently moving his arm to get rid of him. It was the arm with the dark mark. And it was hurting him.
Bloody Potter. What an arse. Now Draco was awake because of him. And he had to stop thinking about him. But Potter would not stop screaming. Annoying. Even asleep, he just
Draco contained the urge to bark a laugh. Potter thought he was so funny. "Precisely, until you interrupted me with your extremely irrelevant questions."
Draco could feel the noisy presence of Potter walking slightly after him. It had been two weeks already, and they had become used to the other's presence. They were used to the silence now.
"I know, but McGonagall believes, and she has the support of all the witnesses, that you must have provoked him."
"What does it look like?" retorted Malfoy. He stood back up with the little dignity he had left. Harry tried to offer his hand, like an idiot. Malfoy patently rejected it, with what would have been a murderous look if it had not been for the lettuce in his hair. He ran to the bathroom.
He did not say it, but Harry regretted how he had punched him at Snape's office. He did not regret Malfoy's new crooked nose, though.
"I dare you-" he said softly, grabbing his chin and kissing him quickly, "I dare you to make me stop."
"I know that you would never ask for my help because I'm Harry Potter and you hate me and blah blah blah. I understand that, so I'm not offering. But if it ever came to a moment where you needed to vent, or to lean on someone, or just a friendly shoulder, you can tell me, okay? I know what you are going to say that it makes no sense and that it's the dumbest shit I've ever said but-. Just-. I just want you to know that I'd be willing to be there if you needed me. No questions asked."
Harry had not slept much that night, and when he decided that it was enough rolling in bed, the sun had still not risen. He really did not want to wake up Malfoy so early, considering how little he usually slept, so he stayed in bed, with the crimson curtains opened just enough to see the green bed. All his senses were focused on what happened in the room. He knew Malfoy was able to sneak in and out of rooms like a snake, with no one (not even him) noticing, but he figured that if he really concentrated on the task, he would catch him before he left again to do whatever he was doing.
Draco also wanted leave, but Potter was really not helping to keep his cool. He was sitting in a well thought position, pretending to be bored and above the sitation. But on the inside, he was on edge. And Potter moving around made him want to jump him and knock him dead. He was unbearable and noisy and obnoxious and Draco was going to lose his mind if he kept pacing around.
Hermione and Ron exchanged quick glances. Harry didn't love it when they communicated with their not-at-all-subtle looks, specially when he was the subject in matter.
stupid thing is making me crazy, Potter. Blame yourself, it's you I can't even look at without losing my mind, you absolute moron-"
"Oh, that's why you are acting so angry and hurt! You've been rejected! What did you do to scare that poor Gryffindor away?"
"If you were able to shut up while you sleep, I would not have had to come here to shut you up myself," he replied and before he could escape the situation as he was ready to do, Potter grabbed him by the arm, with that entitlement that was so typical of him.
Hermione had been researching on Katie Bell's incident. She knew it had affected Harry more than he was willing to admit, so she had tried to investigate what had happened. And she had failed. Nobody had answers for her. Nothing in the library, nothing from Madame Pomfrey, nothing from McGonagall. She still had no clue of how Katie had been poisoned, and less alone who had poisoned her. However, everyone in Hogwarts seemed to be closing all the possible student investigations before they even started.
"No!" Pansy quirked her head at him, dangerously. "I mean, yes! But I don't think he is reallyÂ going to leave me alone, you know."
Draco thought that it was really terrible not to be able to ignore someone so dull and utterly idiotic.
if he somehow managed to complete the mission. Because he also had nightmares about his own loved ones being killed. Because in an ironic and evil corner in his mind, at that instant, he felt closer to Harry Potter than to any other person in his life.
. The plan was simple. Even Crabbe and Goyle would be able to accomplish their parts. All the steps were easy. He did not even have to go to the village. He could stay there, in the Room of Requirements, thinking of an alternative plan if this failed. But it did not have to fail.
Ron felt the contents of his stomach going up his oesophagus, but he bravely swallowed it down. Hermione smiled nervously, struggling to keep it cool. She was not going to judge Harry, not without knowing everything first, that part was clear.
want Potter to shower him. Pity he was too exhausted to speak. "Okay, ready? We are moving to the bed and then you can sleep more comfortably. You can just lay all your weight on me, but I need you to make a tiny effort to stand up, okay? Think that it is all to arrive to a warm, comfy bed, much better than the cold and hard bathroom floor, I promise. It will be super easy."
"But I don't. I don't care. You cannot help someone that doesn't want help. Besides, I have other things to think about."
Potter sounded nervous, frightened, but Draco didn't know what to say to make it better because it was the same thing he felt when he took the potions for the nightmares. He understood what it was like, but he didn't think it was his place to tell him.
When Harry entered their room, he saw Malfoy against the window. A rush of anger spread through his body. But then Malfoy turned to look at him and something else stirred in his stomach. His nose looked funny. Snape had fixed it immediately, but there was a small curve that had not been there before. It also was redder than normally. Maybe two broken noses in less than a month were too much, even in a world of Wizards.
Draco opened his eyes but he needed some time to process his surroundings. The first thing he noticed was that he was unbearably sticky. Then, that he was stuck to an almost naked Harry Potter. Literally stuck, like with sweat and saliva and semen. Finally, he checked his arm, which was thankfully well covered by his wide open shirt. It was the middle of the night. He breathed in deeply.
To be perfectly honest, and as long as he didn't remember that they were talking about Mafoy, Ron was having fun. Hermione was worried and a bit on edge, but Ron felt like laughing it off. Harry was a hilariously bad liar, and yet he kept trying, all blushed and sweaty. It was really funny if they allowed themselves to enjoy it, so he said, as mocking and condescending as he could:
"I do, you jerk! I do give a fuck, that's what I'm trying to tell you. So just accept it and shut up already!"
"My plan is to monitor them. I already told Draco to ignore Potter, but we both know that that is never going to work. I guess you also told Potter something to keep them apart, which probably won't work either. The thing is, this is already messy, and they don't even understand how it is going to explode in their faces. And they keep acting as if they are alone as if this doesn't concern anybody else. I know Draco far better than I know Potter, but he also strikes to me as someone that doesn't ask for help."
"Hermione thinks you might have a point," he admitted. Then he proceeded to fill his mouth with food again.
. The only sign that they had been used was a single blond hair that had rebelliously stuck to his razor. Harry also saw some used towels still drying on top of the radiator, and a reminiscence of Malfoy's scent floating in the air.
"Yes, 'Mione, you should drop your ambitions to be Minister of Magic and become an actress instead."
Selfish. How dared he? Draco didn't know why that word affected him so much. But he couldn't take it. Selfish implied that he was getting something out of the situation. Selfish implied that there was a future in which he was going to be happy again. And that just was not the case. His body was shaking and he wanted to scream until his throat burned. Potter had not clue what it was like. He didn't know how it was to live under the same roof with Him. Potter would never understand how much his arm ached when he dared to think about how much he did not want to kill Dumbledore. Potter didn't know what it was like to be so fucking scared he could not physically concentrate on simple tasks anymore. Potter had no clue, yet he still dared to judge him and get in the middle, every, single, time.
Potter listened carefully with a broken face expression and a trembling lip that Draco deliberately ignored.
He got dressed quickly, and run to breakfast. Ashamed and fluttered as he was, he did not notice that the tie he put on was green.
"What's up, Potter?" he asked sarcastically, putting on his mask of indifference. Which did not cover how terrible he looked, but it powered his stance. "You know that there is no need to stand up when I enter a room? I appreciate the deference, but you can sit down again."
Harry stood up, fuelled by the impatience and the nervousness of a whole night and a whole day waiting for that moment. He was not attempting it to be an aggressive move, but Malfoy flinched and glared at him. Not that he cared. Malfoy was a jerk.
"I want you to leave me alone," he answered softly. And Potter shivered. None of them knew what the other was saying anymore. "I want you to stop
Potter laughed under his breath and Draco caught a glimpse of his chest shaking in the dark. When the laughter died out and turned into a comfortable silence, Draco thought that comfortable silences were kind of their thing. Potter and Draco had learnt to share a lot of comfortable silences since they'd started sharing a room.
"I thought you despised muggles," said Harry, without thinking. He panicked for a second, thinking that Malfoy was about to nod convincingly.
Maybe Potter was not going to accept the dare after all. Draco had considered that possibility straight away, but he didn't want to accept it. He knew that it was a pretty insane thing, to have sex with Potter, but Draco was, well, not excited, but optimistic about it. He needed Potter to dive into the dare and couldn't have him back down. It was a really great plan to distract him, and Draco didn't feel like rethinking the whole thing just because Potter didn't know how to keep his promises. Who did he think he was anyways? Accepting with all that enthusiasm, kissing him as if he had been born for it, passing on contagious diseases that made Draco all jittery and warm inside, and then ignoring the hell out of him the next morning? He could not do that! Not that Draco didn't know how infuriating and outrageous Potter always was, but waking up before him just so that they would not talk in the morning? Avoiding his gaze just because? And was he ever going to finish that bloody toast?
"Five points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. You might want to start paying attention if you plan on pursuing a career as an auror."
Potter was imprisoned against the wall, but he moved so much. He was all over the place, rubbing against him, touching him everywhere. And where the hell did he learn to kiss like that? Like he had nothing to hide. Nothing to lose and everything to give. Suicidal. Because that's who Harry Potter was. And it made Draco crazy. To feel his tongue in every corner of his mouth, to kiss him as if they were fighting. A clash of flesh, teeth and saliva, a struggle to touch and to get closer and closer. And closer. And
"Because I don't need to! You don't have a single thread of proof against me, so you don't get to accuse me! You don't get to mess with my life just because!"
"If my team was competent, I would win with closed eyes. Besides, the self-esteem crisis you would have if I ever won? It would destroy you, and all the Wizarding World. Imagine, if I ever ended their hero, they would send me to Azkaban in the blink of an eye."
"No! You don't get it! There is a... A challenge? I guess? He dared me to... Whatever. Thing is he can't win or I-"
"Did he say something? Harry, all that has happened is not your fault. The whole magical world knows now that Voldemort is back, and that's on you. You opened their eyes, you fought him, but all the bad stuff, that's on them, and if Malfoy cannot understand what a brave and great person you are, all that he tells you is plain rubbish."
Harry entered the shower and purposefully turned the cold water on. This was operation quick shower, operation think of disgusting things like Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon doing it. Come on, Harry, you can do it
Draco breathed in. He just had to open the curtains of his bed and climb in. Potter had always respected that. He just had to hide under his blankets and fall asleep. But Potter was not having it. And the world had to work as Potter wanted. Always as Potter wanted. The Scar-Face had quickly stood up and was holding the curtains, blocking them before he could escape. Their hands were awfully close and Draco hated how he noticed that.
Dobby disappeared. He kept waiting. And looking and the salads. And then at the door. And back and the salads.
"Yeah, sorry. Where is she?" Harry asked, sitting next to him. He could not help but notice that Malfoy was not in the Great Hall.
Malfoy was falling apart. The bags of his eyes so deep they absorbed all the light in the room. Nothing in his completely defeated body, not his horrified grimace, not his shaken limbs, eased Harry's dark thoughts. Malfoy's state confirmed that it had been
No one besides Harry, who was searching through the Marauder's Map, when he saw a dot appear out of nowhere, a dot that read "Draco Malfoy".
"So you let me win to protect my ego, is that right?" asked Potter mockingly, piercing him with those eyes that made Draco feel unprotected. "What's the dare then?"
There he was, eyes open, looking at the ceiling, still shaking a bit from his nightmares. Waiting. (For what? To spontaneously die and let his pathetic existence come to an end?) (He didn't want to die, he didn't think so. But oh, how did he want it to end.)
"Are you maybe not telling me something? I am well aware of Mr. Malfoy's... mischievous acts in this school, but you have got yourself quite similar ones on your record, and I would never dare to say those make either of you irredimible."
Harry glared at her, and Hermione felt like she deserved it. When she didn't know what to do, her coping mechanism was to ask questions. Why. How. Anything that could give her more information. More information and fewer feelings. That was her preference. But Harry was on the verge of exploding with emotion, and her questions were not helping.
"I don't want to hear it, Potter. I don't need you to convince me of anything. You have no clue what it is like. I don't want your heroic crap. I have no options!"
Harry watched as he drank the whole thing avidly. Obviously, Malfoy did not thank him, not even close, but he breathed out a satisfied sigh. Although sick Malfoy was an annoying prick, it was the first time that he was not completely pushing Harry away, and the way he called him, Potter this, Potter that, he was
"You are coming with me," insisted Potter, and he grabbed his arm to push him up of the ground. Draco almost stood up because he was weak and Potter's touch apparently had that kind of persuasive power on him.
"That's stupid. In order to distract me, I would have to be into him, which I most definitely am not. Besides, I am still watching him, making sure he doesn't act suspicious."
That night, Draco arrived to the room late. Even in the darkness, the green and red halves were clearly separated.
"What the fuck do you know?" exploded Draco at last, forgetting about the mask. "Merlin, you still believe that you are a wonderful person and you only mix up with the most wonderful people in the Wizarding World. It's pathetic! Wake up, Potter! You gave
"Oh, really? So your plan is to stay with your shirt on every single time you do it? Do you know a single shit about sex, my sweet innocent boy? Because sex is mostly about nakedness, and hotness, and wanting to get closer to the other, and getting rid of every piece of clothing so that you can touch the other person as much as possible and before you know it you are shouting "Mpfff, oh yes, Potter, right there, yesssssss, Potteeeeeeeer."
She had so many questions, but she was in the middle of a class, and that was sacred. Honouring the title of Brightest Witch of Her Age, she cast a silent spell to turn Harry's tie to the colours of Gryffindor. No one noticed. No one, except for Ron, of course, who smiled a bit hysterically and thought "hallelujah!"
It is not that the system has failed black people, or poor people, or disabled people. The truth is that the system was never meant for them. And that is a system that DOES NOT WORK. Capitalism does not work. Racism does not work. Fascism does not work.
Then, Potter opened his curtains, and Draco was sure he was going to say something, or do something. But no, that was it. Potter opened the curtains and stayed in bed, his breaths more audible now. And Draco knew that the obvious thing to do was to leave him be, to ignore him and his chaotic behaviour. But unfortunately, Draco was not able to coordinate his rational brain with his arm movements, so he also opened his curtains, because he was only human, and mimicry was a basic social skill.
Malfoy had long left, as he discovered when he finally got up. When he opened the curtains of his bed, the blinding light announced that it was late, extremely. It likely was the last sunny day there would be in the Scottish highlands for a while. Harry knew that Ron and Hermione were probably waiting for him to tell them all about the horrible experience of spending the night with Malfoy, but he decided to take a bath. Truth was that there was not much to say.
Draco felt the hot water of the tea soaking his beautiful white shirt, ruining it. It hurt like hell, but not as much as the embarrassment. Everyone in the Great Hall was looking at him and Draco wanted to scream. The cup he'd been holding had crushed into a million pieces in his hand, and there were small red cuts all over his palm and fingers. He vaguely noticed some fellow Slytherin cleaning up his mess, but his eyes were locked with Potter's, who had turned at last, taunting him.
"They complain far less, that's for sure," he said, and Draco could hear his smile. "And they go to sleep at normal times."
"Draco!" called Professor Snape loudly, his voice echoing in the Great Hall. He walked peacefully towards them, as if nothing odd was happening, as if the fighting and the circle of spectators were an everyday thing at Hogwarts (when it came to Malfoy and Potter, they actually were). However, his favourite student did not answer or react to the call, as he was too busy releasing testosterone against Weasley and superiority against Granger. Draco was also too blocked by Potter's body to move.
"Yeah, obviously," sneered Draco, sensing what the question was really about. He mentally cursed Pansy for being so fast.
Not that he knew why he wanted to face him. Or talk to him. But Harry felt that he was not going to be able to go through the day and think of something different than a shaking Malfoy without confronting him first. Plus, there was a
"But maybe we can go for a second round of just sex," suggested Draco a bit too quickly to keep his act completely cool and impersonal.
"I don't know, because he never shuts up and he thinks he is morally superior and he thinks so highly of himself and goes around as if he's a hero whose only purpose is to save everybody, and I don't need that-"
"Be quiet, Mr Potter. And sit down. One more word and it will be a hundred points less from Gryffindor. You too, Mr Malfoy. Grab a chair and sit down."
Kissing had already been too much. So what the fuck was this then. What on earth were they doing? What was Malfoy thinking off? It made absolutely no sense.
"If you were straight-forward and told me what exactly you are planning, then I would be able to consider collaborating with you."
Draco was legitimately scared. He didn't want her to know, but now she knew. She'd guessed. She'd bloody guessed without any prompts. He was cornered and that's were his tomb would be. In a dirty closet. So he might as well die with pride, right?
Malfoy arrived a couple of minutes later. Alone and without the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.
He clearly wanted him to lose it. He was asking for a fight. He was basically begging for it. But Draco was too
"What?" he snapped. Harry felt hot and his body had started reacting to the images his brain was now processing.
Potter went even more ballistic and squeezed tighter. Everyone in the Great Hall was silent, so the suffocated sound that left Draco's throat was perfectly audible.
Draco hid in behind his curtains, furious. Potter did not grab his arm this time. Good, because he would not have been able to respond to his acts. There was no way in which he could express how much he hated him.
Merlin help him, Harry wanted to punch himself. He was weak, a sick embarrassing hormonal teenager that did not deserve to have a hand.
, as if there were no more generic compliments. McGonagall seemed happy with the answer, though, and even Snape had nothing to pick on.
"I'm sure," he said instead, listening to the predominantly coherent parts of his rationality, which made Potter drop the hand with which he was reaching for his forehead.
"Who do you think decided on the mixed Slytherin-Gryffindor decoration? Snape?" Potter snorted, amused by his own joke.
"Why are you scared then?" Harry's voice was so low it was hard to hear. Maybe it was him that was scared.
"I didn't want to hurt your ego. You would have been completely insufferable if you'd thought you didn't do a good job."
For a moment, there was silence, but then the noises came back. It seemed like he was actually making an effort to be quieter, but it was unbearable anyways. Had no one ever taught him to eat like a person? So Draco went out of his small shelter of green pillows and velvet, and sat on the floor, facing Potter. He was even more disgusting now that he could see him. At least he chewed with a closed mouth, but his lips were shiny, and his face was red, and even his eyes seemed a bit tearful, from having eaten so much. Morgana, how much had he eaten?
"I swear to all of the Greatest Wizards, if you don't be quiet, I will tell McGonagall that you wish to drop her subject!"
There still was a lot of food, but Harry kept eating, and waiting, and thinking of all the ways in which he was going to shout at Malfoy the next time he saw him.
"Okay, Potter, you can read out loud. I cannot sleep anyways if you keep turning pages with the delicacy of a mammoth."
"I don't care! You are such a miserable, selfish, sad man," Potter said, looking at him with a despise that made him sick.
"So wanna take off your shirt and go again?" Potter asked, breaking the safe distance that Draco had established.
Draco went to the bathroom, wanting to quickly wash his face and get some sleep. But nothing was that easy when you shared a dorm with Harry Freaking Potter.
And then the subject of his obsession entered the room. And the way he had his tie untied around his neck, and how he wore his crumpled shirt outside his pants, and that hopeless mess of ungovernable hair on top of his absurd face with those sodding emerald eyes hidden under the same pitiful glasses that he'd been wearing since they were too big for his head in the first year, it was all a personal attack. It had to be intentional, the fact that Potter was destroying him simply by standing there in front of him.
He wasnât sure how to react to that, part of him was desperate for a fight, adrenaline was pumping through his veins and it would be so
Malfoy jumped in surprise but redeemed himself quickly. âI havenât decided quite yet. I think I might travel, explore other cultures. I have relatives in France and it might be nice to meet at least one side of the family who isnât completely deranged yet.â Harry let out a snort at the admission and Malfoy addressed him directly. âI suspect youâll be in Auror training as soon as possible?â
"Chin up Draco, we can find a pug somewhere for Pansy." He pointed out to Draco's amusement and Pansy's horror.
If Harry didn't know any better, he would say that this years feast being based entirely around his favourite foods was just a coincidence. However, he does know better and after seeing twelve enormous treacle tarts on the Gryffindor table alone, as well as all his favourite side dishes, he is growing slightly suspicious.
"What? By laughing?" She exclaimed, looking exasperated and Harry was beginning to feel more and more uncomfortable being in the middle of a lovers tiff.
âYes?â Parkisonâs voice was steel and he couldnât help but notice the way her body shielded Malfoyâs protectively.
She waved Parkison over and the black-haired girl approached their table, giving the boys short nods in greeting.
"You could say so." He replied and was beyond grateful when she didn't ask him to elaborate. He'd learnt how to brew it in the sixth year when the nightmares had gotten too intense. Living in the same house as Voldemort tended to do that to a person.
The memory exploded all around him and suddenly Harry was back in the classroom, panting with shock. Malfoy was sitting opposite him in a similar state.
"Oh honestly," Hermione sighed in exasperation. "It was all in the letter. You really ought to start paying more attention. All eighth years are being put together, we'll be sharing a common room and dormitories."
They all laughed except for Luna who smiled dreamily. "I wonder what would happen if I tried to sell my pants."
Malfoy simply raised an eyebrow and took another sip of his drink. Finnigan, Iâm a lot of things but a hypocrite isnât one of them.â
Harry settled in one them, picking at a loose thread in his tie as an effort to calm his bubbling nerves. He only had to wait a few minutes before the door of the classroom opened and he straightened, expecting to see some portly ministry official or one of the unspeakableâs he had encounter over the summer.
And so once again, Harry found himself on the Hogwarts express, with Ginny curled up on his lap, Ron bickering with Hermione and Luna trying to teach Neville the proper way to harvest leaping toadstools.
âWhy donât we come up with a safe word? That way, if it gets too deep, you can say the safe word and cover up the thought or memory with something else.â
He sighed heavily. "It was fine I suppose. Absolutely ridden with Gryffindors, I feel sure they're multiplying." Theo laughed at this and he tried not to flinch at the sound. "I've been paired with Granger so naturally Weasel is out for blood."
He inspected his body briefly in the mirror, he was in better shape than he'd ever been before and his skin was vaguely tanned from the long days he would spend sitting outside of the burrow with Ron when the grief in the house got too claustrophobic.
"Oh fuck off Malfoy." He spat, but to his immense annoyance, the other boy didn't take the bait, instead, he just rolled his eyes and carried on his conversation with Zabini as though Harry wasn't even in the room.
Malfoy shifted a little, looking serious. âPotter, I am in no place to judge bad childhoodâs believe me. Itâs normal for traumatic memories to pop up during these sessions. I have no doubt that youâll be seeing some things in my head Iâd much rather be kept private.â
Ron opened his mouth to speak but before he could do so, a small boy came jogging up to them, panting heavily.
"Darling I might curse you myself I saw that." Pansy raised her eyebrows and he sat up, wrapping an arm around her shoulders loosely.
He crossed his arms. "I don't have much choice in the matter do I?" She gave him a small nod and he relented. "I'll try a few sessions but if it doesn't work then that is the ministry's problem, not mine.
Malfoy nodded slowly. âThatâs great Aunt Walburga's house, isnât it? I think I visited as a child. Is that appalling display of elf heads still there?â
Harry had been in the library when heâd received another letter from McGonagall, informing him that his first Legilimency lesson would be later that evening in an empty charms classroom. Upon hearing this, Hermione had switched to full out research mode, scouring the shelves for any books vaguely relating to the subject.
âWith great difficulty I presume.â Malfoy's smile turned wicked. âItâs a good thing youâve got- what was it the judges said at the Triwizard tournament again?â
"Oh yes, Draco's coming back." Luna declared, and Harry stared at her in surprise. "He didn't want to but Narcissa insisted. She wants him to get his NEWTS so he'll be able to get a job."
âCowardly, vile scum. They should have given you the kiss, no one would miss you, not even your whore of a mother.â
Ron faltered a little at this but only for a second. "Well...well Bulstrode didn't need to get her knickers in a twist about it!"
âTo understand why I made certain decisions, youâll have to understand how I was raised.â Malfoy began. âFor the first eleven years of my life, I was raised to believe that pureblood were superior over others. I had no reason to doubt or question this, everyone I knew had the same mindset, I only ever played with pureblood children and went to pureblood parties. Why would I ever assume that what my parentâs were telling me was anything but the truth? People envied my mother and respected my father like they were gods and I adored them.
"I won't tell you! They are not trophies to show around, Draco. Plus, straight people get mad if you share their "experiments"-"
"So what have you been doing today?" asked Potter without looking at him, as if he did not care. It was cute how he tried to play it cool.
"You have never ever even been close to do such a thing, dear. I would say that it will probably be harder for you to ignore Potter than whatever You Know Who wants from you, but you'll manage."
"Crowley, Potter! Just grab it and go!" he snapped when Potter finally was within reach of his nightstand.
Silently, Ron and Hermione wished him goodnight and off they went to the Gryffindor tower. Harry was left with his dark thoughts.
. It felt privileged to have a bath when in Gryffindor they had to share showers that not even the house-elves were able to keep completely clean. It felt splendid to soak the warm and perfumed water.
And off went Snape, his black cloak loyally after him. And a startled Draco had no other option but to follow.
Then, Draco opened that cabinet again because he was a self-torturing imbecile, and the dead bird hadn't moved. "Wake up, you stupid creature!" Draco grabbed the nonsensically small dead body and threw it across the room. It was disgusting.
much more. Sure, he was trying to be accepting and understanding of Harry's horrible taste in men. But how was it possible that no one was saying anything about the green tie. And why on Earth was he wearing that when he was not even able to talk to them about it?
Yes! The apple was back. Beautiful apple with the beautiful bite that served as an identification. He was a freaking genius, modesty aside.
idea, because he had managed not to go crazy during his whole life, and he was not going to allow something as trivial as sharing a room with his declared school rival to do the deal. Really, it was ridiculous that he had endured being almost killed, the loss of his parents, and the life with the Dursleys, only to end up losing his shit because he'd kissed Malfoy a couple of times.
Harry smiled broadly, his chest shaking a bit more with the sniggering. "Am I? Does it bother you? Too hot to stand, princess?"
"Okay..." started Hermione, but she didn't know how to continue. She felt pity for Malfoy, but it was still Malfoy. "Okay, and how- How can you know that?"
"Fuck you! Are you even listening to yourself? Voldemort has been ruining my life since I was one, Malfoy!"
Dumbledore looked out dreamily through the window, lost in better times. Harry stood up, understanding that the Headmaster would be of no help if he wanted the detention to end.
He pushed up his sleeve and looked at it. The scratches and wounds from the previous nights were still there, but they did not disrupt the deep blackness of the drawing, the serpent and the skull perfectly visible, making fun of him. However, at that moment, it did not hurt. If he did not look at it, he would not know it was there. Except that he always knew.
"It's called vomiting, Potter. It happens when one is sick. And personally, I'd rather be alone while I'm at it. So don't worry, and close the door after you leave."
"She probably means that bullshit you pulled five minutes ago in the Great Hall," explained Ron, not completely joking.
Hermione was not convinced. She did not want to believe it, but the pieces fitted very well indeed. Harry had been mourning for Sirius all summer, but the moment he'd seen Malfoy, he had kind of come to life. He'd forced them to follow the blonde all the way into Knockturn Alley, obsessing over the theory that he was a Death Eater. And then in the train, he'd actually confronted him. And then again before they got detention together in their new room. And he'd been so mad when he discovered that Malfoy had dropped Quidditch. And from the moment they had started sharing a room, Harry had been completely distracted, and he also seemed to be sleeping less and skipping more meals, saying he would eat in the bedroom. Jesus Christ. It all made sense.
Potter coughed uneasily, and Draco smiled cynically to the ceiling. "Well, I don't know, Potter. I most definitely have discovered new stuff about you."
"Well, if I told you all the annoying stuff Gryffindors do all the time, we would be here forever. Nightmares are not even the worst thing I have to stand."
Potter conjured some music and the water in the tub started running. For a moment, the Slytherin's face contorted like a broken record, but he quickly recovered his mask of neutrality and focused on the essay for Snape.
When the day came to an end, Hermione was buzzing with all the questions she had, but Harry ran away back to his red and green bedroom before she or Ron could stop him. The only thing she could do before Harry disappeared, and she was not completely sure as to why she did it, was removing the spell and giving back its original colours to the tie Harry was wearing.Â Hermione had wanted to run after him, but Ron had grabbed her by the arm to stop her.
"I'm sure it is far more annoying to have the actual nightmares," said McGonagall firmly. Harry forgot too often how much he appreciated her.
Their bodies fitted perfectly in the dark, curled against each other, merged in a mess of arms and legs, green silk and red cotton. And they breathed in unison. Calm and warm.
"Of course not," said Ron reassuringly passing his arm over her shoulders. "We are the best friends he could ever get. Besides, not everyone would be so understanding of his weird kink with the snakes."
Potter was looking at him straight in the eye, daringly. Draco stared back firmly, ignoring how blushed his face must have been at the moment. Potter could not know that he wanted to run away. Draco had never been scared of him, but this was different. This was a whole new different kind of terrorising. The kind that apparently Potter was great at.
him now. And Draco was in the fucking moon because his hands were rough and big and he could feel them in his back and in his stomach and in his chest. And it was too much. But it was the best kind of too much.
that obsession. Merlin, it was weird. Ron could not fathom how could that pale, entitled prick could ever be...
And off he went. Draco had nothing left inside his stomach, but he stayed there, half asleep in the toilet, feeling miserable. At least Potter had left him to be miserable alone. He was sure Potter was not going to come back after the scene he'd just seen. Which made it easier to ignore him. And it also sucked.
"Hm, well, I suppose he is clever. Not like... Not like school smart like Hermione. I mean, you can judge that. He is school smart too. But when he talks and stuff, he is clever."
"No, Malfoy. I know it was you," he said disgustedly. "You didn't go to Hogsmeade, so you sent someone? Pansy? So that she could enter the girls bathroom? You really are so miserable that you have to pass on your shit just to have an alibi?"
Malfoy was breathing softly, but he still wasn't asleep, so after a tense silence, Harry dared to call him in a whisper.
"Then you can leave, don't go to the room except to sleep. Avoid him. And if you feel that you can't, then come to me. I can make sure you are distracted, alright? We'll study or whatever you want."
"Help yourself, prince," and it did not sound as sarcastic as intended. It was entertaining to see him eat, and at least that way, his mind could rest and stop wondering about where and what he was doing.
Especially because, on top of everything, the great and marvelous Harry Potter was sleeping barely five meters away from him at that very moment.
Draco inhaled deeply. Potter had said "we" as if they had something in common- As if they were living something similar even though their situations were opposites. Or maybe Draco was reading too much into it and it had just been a way of speaking, a way of not sounding too selfish by saying "us" instead of "I".
"We've kissed a couple of times. And we jerked each other."Â Pansy limited her reaction to two slow blinks. "Happy? What do you care anyways-"
Harry looked at Malfoy as if he was seeing him for the first time. What the actual fuck. What the fuck were they doing. It made no sense. It made no fucking sense. What was Malfoy doing. Bloody Malfoy. Why did he look so good all blushed and parted lips. And no shirt. Harry felt cold. He also did not have a shirt. What the actual fuck. Malfoy had a huge red spot in the bottom part of his neck, close to his collar bones. Harry realised he had done that. He pushed away the thoughts of wanting to do it again. It was too much.
"What the-," shrieked Malfoy as he opened the door and found his arm trapped in Harry's hands. He was wearing just a bathrobe. And he had not brushed his hair. Which was kind of wet.
Harry was most definitely not thinking about ways to save the world. His mind was much closer, too focused on the blond boy sitting some rows ahead of the classroom. It was not as if he was not embarrassed of his thoughts. Harry was perfectly aware that he sucked, and that he should not be dedicating so many neurons to the fact that Malfoy was wearing a turtleneck under his robes. Sharing a room with that serpent had completely fucked up his brain, and Malfoy kissing him
"Thank you, Herms," said Harry after finally swallowing the potatoes. "And don't worry, I know. This is Malfoy we are talking about. He will always be Malfoy. It doesn't affect me." The tone too squeaky to sound believable.
"What? What the hell do you have to do that leaves no room to put your ass on a broom and show off your new equipment? Fuck, Malfoy, you love all of that. You love Quidditch. What the hell can be so important that it makes you forget the thrill of flying?"
Harry didn't know what was up with his friends, but he knew something was, so he did his best to avoid uncomfortable conversations. He was sure it was about Malfoy and he had no clue of what would he say if they asked. During the classes, he pretended to be very invested in the topics the teachers discussed, contrary to what he had been doing at McGonagall's. And during the breaks, he ranted about everything and nothing: Quidditch, exams, the second hand Potions textbook he'd been using. Ron and Hermione had not found a moment to talk in private and put their knowledge in common, so they did not stop him. After all, Harry was talking eleven times more than what he had been doing in the past weeks.
That day he went to great lengths; He woke up early, Hermione helped him dress in the best Muggle casual clothes he had in his closet - black jeans, a red plaid shirt over a black T-shirt, and his faded converse - and had arrived fifteen minutes early at the venue. agreed ... even so, time was passing too slow for her liking. For this reason, the anxiety that he felt from long before, when he could not even recognize the feelings he had for Draco, simmered inside him slowly, thinking that the other had repented, that he decided better not to attend with him, leaving him with his heart. runaway.
Not to mention that her hair was messily slicked back, leaving some unruly black strands in its wake, and the fact that she didn't wear the glasses he had worn since she could remember.
He stretched his arms up to loosen the muscles in his back and took a deep breath; at least everything that happened yesterday had been relegated as a memory of an intense day. A moment created by his so fanciful mind.
Draco became the sun star of Harry's little universe, the one he depended on completely for an afternoon of adventure or to study tediously for the next potions test. His best friend stood out from the rest of his Slytherin companions who were small asteroids that made his life a little more bearable with jokes towards the Gryffindors and mockery of the Hufflepuffs.
"And you, Draco," Harry said, turning his gaze to him as he set Hermione on the floor. Without you, none of this would have been possible.
"After such a long time, I have to confess something," Harry said, bringing a sugar gum to his mouth.
He felt despair. And now, with a clear mind, he understood that it was irresponsible to do such a thing. He did not know the consequences of interfering in other timelines â let's say that such trifles did not interest him at the time of creating the diary â and perhaps it was a mistake to wish someone else who was not from the same universe.
Harry â the Harry Gryffindor â knew that happened when his emotions were out of control. It was magic in its most primitive and purest state.
"That ..." Ron cleared his throat, not meeting his eyes. Yes, that's a pretty high bar. Did you say car accident? What is that supposed to be?
But that would be history for another time and universe. For the moment, he would enjoy tearing this Gryffindor apart, and he smiled knowing how much he would enjoy seeing his face change with despair and agony at impending defeat.
Harry just walked through the makeshift corridors, looking among the people who had fought side by side with him in that impossible war; some if he knew them, others were new faces. It might sound cruel, but maybe all of that was necessary for the course of history to continue with a happy ending.
-I am not dumb. I know what I saw, and I know when people like each other. Hermione was silent for a few moments, seeing any reaction of his and continued: "I saw you hiding on the day of the game near the infirmary and I know that the Harry here, the one in this world, also attracts you."
Harry followed with the swaying of his hips, stopping at the point where he had noticed, he used to come with just a little pressure. He grabbed the base of Draco's penis, preventing him from freeing himself and only got groans in response. He pulled his member out of the alien body and with force, he turned to face Draco, who looked like a divinity fallen straight to hell, wrapped in a cloak of lust with his rosy cheeks and heavy breathing.
Draco got up and tossed his raincoat on the bed, but not before crumpling up a piece of paper that he still held in his hands.
But he still felt a hypocrite. It was a very silly pretext, and even someone as clueless as Ron Weasley might know it.
And so, despite Malfoy claiming at first that he had to be somewhere else, he argued (politely) with Ron about why the Appleby Arrows were better in technique than the Chudley Cannons but had worse equipment until Hermione, half an hour earlier. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, he had approached his compartment.
Harry Gryffindor could see how his other self walked alongside the headmistress of Hogwarts, so elegant, haughty, distinguished, with his ego inflated to the sky, very similar to ...
Two things were clear about that confrontation; one, the Harry Slytherin was obviously interested - and not in a friendly way - in Draco Malfoy, and the second ...
Harry released the air that was in his chest. He felt a slight reassurance after that, it wasn't because something happened between them; They had only been together for almost three weeks, it wasn't for things to move that fast. And the little mental stability that he had achieved, he went overboard when he quickly thought that he had to do something, because both Slytherins shared everything together, that was the first time in days that he had seen Draco really alone.
"Does it matter?" Harry shrugged at the look he received. I mean, my parents were in Gryffindor, right? I suppose I will also go there, although I would not mind staying in any other.
And, above all, how it felt to be kissed by those thin lips with which he had fantasized much of his stay at school. Maybe since fifth grade, when he was part of the inquisitor squad and was dedicated to looking for any excuse to annoy Harry much more than he did.
Ron and Hermione met each other's eyes for an instant, avoiding their gaze full of questions. That only happened when they wanted to hide something from him, and he couldn't help but think of something more serious that Gryffindor had lost.
The vigor with which he penetrated another's body transported him to a mystical place, losing himself between the pleasure he felt running down his spine to the sweet sensation that settled in his pelvis, slowly accumulating those exciting sensations.
"I see so much talent in you, and although I have not assigned you a house in the past, I know that you undoubtedly belong to ..." The hat saved a second and continued: "Slytherin."
"And what a blow, are you okay?" Now Ron, who was still wearing his Quidditch uniform, was the one who spoke and put his hand on her shoulder.
For some reason, it gave him mixed feelings; On the one hand, they got the newspaper they worked hard day and night for the last few months to fully work. On the other hand ... he felt his heart clench with despair at the resounding certainty that Harry Slytherin could leave as soon as McGonagall was told.
