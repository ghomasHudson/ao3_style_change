It was evident that his refined mind had very quickly made the link between Potter’s memory and the risks of such a loss in someone’s life.
Harry opened his eyes, breath short and frowned when he saw Malfoy irritated in front of him, an eyebrow raised, arms crossed on his bust.
The two entangled silhouettes of the owners stood in the middle of the entrance, closely connected and short of breath.
“How do you know that?” he asked carefully, his breathing getting more jerky at the thought that she had noticed something unusual as she had always done.
"Hey Neville! How are you, mate?" Dean added, bending over to give him a friendly pat on the shoulder.
“Me? Nothing. You, on the other hand, will tell me exactly what you remember,” he quietly explained.
Malfoy had become his drug, and he was taking more than enough. The very idea of knowing that he was so close to him electrified him far more than he would have liked.
"Yes." She seemed to brace herself for what she was about to say. "I wanted you to know first. I'm divorcing Ron."
"We had the whole Manor refurbished after the War. Even the parts that hadn't been tainted by Voldemort just brought back bad memories. I oversaw most of the design along with my mother. My father was rather busy at the time."
They greeted each other and sat in silence for a few minutes, just gazing at the various wizards and witches milling about the room. Harry also took his time to observe the two other men at his table.
Harry had been sitting there with his eyes closed for some time and he spoke without opening them. Once he did, he felt tears in his eyes at the revelation.
, and it basically depicted attempted rape. While that part wasn't good, the figures were still beautiful. Apollo was slender, fine featured, and if Harry remembered right, blond in pictures. Truth be told, he did look a lot like Draco, so Harry supposed, that was his type of man. He wished he could have taken a picture of Draco besides the statue, but they weren't allowed to take their cameras in. They did buy a book of the Gallery though. Harry considered learning photoshop.
The witch just smiled at him and took another sip from her flute. Harry drained his and exchanged the empty glass for a full one.
"I'm sure that once we prove that Ginny cheated on you, everything will be all right. She hadn't been exactly a model mother either. Also, there's the whole affair with the potion."
"I did help them to renovate the Burrow," Harry recalled. "It only seemed right, since we lived in that new house."
Harry was glued to the window. He seriously had no idea what Draco was doing beside him, he was so mesmerised by the colourful houses and the seemingly endless stream of people going about their business on the narrow pavements. London was a busy city as well, he knew that, but it never had that crowded feeling. Everyone seemed to move to a slow and steady music, while the people in Rome lived to the beat of a fast-paced pop song. Horns blared from all directions, and their driver wasn't afraid to use it either. Harry resolved not to look forward. He really didn't want to know how many times they nearly hit someone. It was so loud and full of life. They passed a huge and grand white building, that inspite of being built reminiscent of ancient structures, it was obviously a modern construction. They also drove by two sets of very long steps, a great wall of rocks, wound down some narrow streets, and stopped on a really narrow one. On one side there was a row of buildings, on the other side of the street there was a big gate. The flag of the Vatican hung over it, and Harry wondered what that was about.
Once he was clean and dry, he went back to bed, the body soothed by the endorphin which was spreading throughout his being until reaching his mind. He turned off his thoughts and let himself go, knowing that tomorrow he would regret...
He then took a few seconds to breathe deeply and began to rise with difficulty as he walked toward a wall to lean heavily on it. He had pushed his shoulder against the cold stone by resting the side of his head, his hand still holding firmly the place where his leg was throwing him atrociously.
He was afraid to have really imagined Malfoy’s answer when he stared at him without moving before finally putting a hand in his pocket to pull out what looked like a pocket watch.
The hypothesis was confirmed when he settled on one of the chairs around the table, concentrating on fiddling his fingers. Draco frowned, searching for events of the previous day that might have disturbed him further. Although he concentrated strongly, he found nothing very restrictive about the exchanges they had maintained, except the fact that the sons of Death Eaters were still out of reach.
Besides looking at statues, what Harry really wanted to do was to get used to being with Draco in public. It wasn't always easy. Mostly it was just the occasional look, but there were some, who decided to express their problem with two men being together verbally. Harry had expected it, feared it, but realised he couldn't let it rule his life. Once he was divorced he could make the relationship public in Britain as well, and he wanted to be comfortable in it by then.
did an article on famous wizard couples, and included them on the list. Thankfully, homophobia didn't exist in the wizarding world. Harry was a bit puzzled by this, but Draco explained to him that most homophobia stemmed from monotheist tribal cultures, where people were afraid that if not everyone reproduced, the tribe would die out. Since the Wizarding World always had a lower infant mortality rate, and longer life span, that attitude never developed. Now Harry just wished the Muggle world would also be more like that, but as he looked into the issue, he realised that the change was already happening, albeit slowly.
Draco frowned, but the other was clearly enjoying the food. So he sat down as well. He took his knife and fork, and tentatively tried them. The dish was indeed as good, or probably better than the meatballs the night before. Apparently, Harry could cook.
They fell on the bed, hands sliding over naked flesh. Draco managed to get the upper hand in their erotic wrestling and attacked Harry's nipples. They both moaned.
Harry pushed the disturbing images that Adrian's speech created in his mind to the very back, sealed in a box on top of shelf 'do not disturb'. He swore to stay away from all thoughts concerning Draco and sex in the future. They were too unsettling.
"I hope you have all read through the extensive documentation that you got yesterday in preparation for the vote." The Chief Warlock glared at the members from above his spectacles. "Now, please raise your wands if you are for the new legislation and keep them in your pockets if you are against."
"Fine. I think you should divorce her. I never knew why you married her in the first place. She's a groupie. She married Harry Potter, war hero, boy-who-bloody-lived, celebrity. Not
"What are you doing here with that man?" He came out with the question right away as he had no time to waste.
"Oh," was all Draco said and he stood to get his own glass. He poured it full and sat back down, his eyes on Harry.
"As you wish, Harry." She stood from the table, ran out the door towards Diagon Alley and even managed to brush a tear from her face.
"I never thought that you would be the kind of person who would just lie down and take everything silently."
The following weeks went by uneventfully for Harry. The kids were back and he was glad for it. Even the short holiday from work made him happy, since he could just play all day with the children, at least when they weren't in school. Surprisingly, Ginny put a lot of effort into their relationship, more than she had since they'd gotten married, he noted. She would offer him sex at every opportunity, try to make his breakfast, even though she had always hated being in the kitchen. She called his diet silly and tried to feed him his regular fare of a full English with toast and juice, but he refused it and instead ate what Dinky had prepared for them. She tried again a few times, but eventually gave up. Once that came to pass, she focused all her energy on being very romantic instead. Picnic lunches in the park were a regular occurrence and Harry went along with them half-heartedly. He knew that he should have been happy with his wife's displays of affection and newfound enthusiasm for their relationship, but he was rather annoyed and weary of her sudden interest.
The grey orbs met his green eyes and again, what Harry could read there was horribly bewildering, both sorrow, pain, envy and a strange sympathy shining within.
Draco remembered perfectly the day when all their hatred had fallen, to give way to desire. That feeling had grown and developed, and none of them saw it coming…
“Harry? Still not dressed? But... why are you pointing your wand at Draco?” he asked, going from Harry to Malfoy, without understanding.
“Fuck you, Malfoy! I already explained to you that I don’t know what took me, it’s just done! We won’t talk about it again, so print it in your perilous mind, is that clear?"
“Well. It looks like you’re recovering pretty fast, young man. One more day here and I think tonight you can go back to your dorm for the night.”
He reopened them, blocking his breath in his chest and leaned forward, between Malfoy’s legs, moving forward his face to his own and kissed him passionately.
“I would say that you have something to worry about, because sex accelerates the deterioration of your brain cells.”
“I understand that you lost control of your magic moments earlier, but your differences with Mr. Weasley have nothing to do with this course and I would ask you to respect me and your comrades for the smooth running of this one!”
Their entrée was roast beef with equally roasted vegetables in a red wine reduction. Harry assumed the sauce was made from Malfoy wine as well. Finally, for afters, they had poached fruits with vanilla cream. Everyone was completely full and ready to find a nice bed for a few hours after eating the hearty meal.
They were lounging in bed a few hours later, too tired to do anything but bask in the afterglow, when there was a knock on a window. Draco couldn't be bothered to get up, so it was left to Harry to drag his naked self out of bed to let in the owl. He immediately recognised it as Teddy's. He felt a bit guilty, since he should have written a letter to his godson after declaring himself for the Dark side, but he was a bit afraid as to how the boy would handle it.
Harry's people watching was interrupted by an elderly wizard. He had been previously introduced as Bartholomew Mildew, a Light Wizard member of the Wizengamot.
"Yes. Lucius Septimius Severus Augustus, to be exact. Kind of funny. But he was really known as just Severus. He was a really strong emperor. He fought many wars and won. He even tried to go against Scotland, but he died in what is now York. Naturally, Father wasn't named after him, but I do seem to recall Severus mentioning something like his mother named him after an emperor thinking that it would give him strength in his struggles."
"Ginny wished to travel for a while after Lily was born. Of course, I had to stay home with my duties as an Auror," he began.
Then Harry remembered that Molly never did attend any of the parties; she always stayed at home. He silently scolded himself for saying something so stupid.
The man sitting on the couch didn’t know what to say. He disagreed with his friend’s views so much, but he had no idea how to contest them.
Now this folks, is a big one. You have all been waiting for it. :D Harry does a bit of traveling and I have posted pictures on my Facebook page that I used as reference. I'm also posting a link to the hotel I mentioned. It's a real place, I did a lot of research to be accurate, so please check it out.
"Oh, can he come and play? My dad doesn't have many other friends who have children I could play with." He made a sad face and dropped his head a little to look up pleadingly through blond lashes. The boy obviously knew how to look as cute as possible, so that he couldn't be refused. Harry hated to admit it, but it was working too.
“Ugh, I’m sorry if we were not supposed to use the piano,” Harry said, kind of embarrassed now by their very public display.
Harry had to still himself in order not to fall. He patted her head, encouraging her to let go. He was glad for her reaction. Girls usually favoured their mother, but Ginny really hadn’t taken a lot of care of Lily.
"Yesterday, I thought of how my life and also that of my children was going to change. The only relatives they have are among the Weasleys." He decided to talk about what concerned him the most and not the tingling on his wrist, or the feeling that their legs still touching gave him.
"Maybe. It would mean paying Astoria off. I would have to love the man a lot," Draco said and his voice was more emotional than before. Harry supposed the blond never expected such a thing to happen, he was probably enjoying sleeping around too much.
"You are right. I have become lenient with her," he admitted as there really was no way of denying it.
"Fine. If you hate it, just push me away," he said, as he got to his feet, swaying, and made it to the other couch through sheer force of will. He flopped down next to Harry and took his glass from him, placing it on the table.
“He allows me no freedom. He wants everything to be his way and for me to be his meek little wife. I know I have been for some years, but I don’t want to be anymore. I want to work - to become a healer. All he wants to do is produce more children. He knows we would not be able to afford any more, but he says he wants to have the most children out of all his brothers. I told him I don’t want to do that, but he just ignored me,” she explained, all of it coming out in a rush.
"Good, good. I was afraid you had the arrogance of youth and with all that fame many grow big heads. I'm sure I'll be able to help you a lot once you take your seats. Now my only concern is your wife." Mr. Mildew pulled his lips in worry.
“And if it isn’t Hermione. You clean up well,” he remarked as he looked her over. Hermione couldn’t decide if it was a compliment or an insult, so she just ignored the remark.
"Oh, there's Linda! I'd better go and say hi." Ginny got up and was already shouting to her friend. Harry watched her go and looked to Arthur.
He hoped he could find her soon, but after a few hours the sun had begun to set and people seemed to be heading back to their hotels. He didn't hurry back though. As the sky turned orange and red, painting the sea with similar colours, he sat down on an abandoned lounge-chair and just stared at the magnificent scenery before him. He was alone. He wanted to have a warm person beside him, to hold and enjoy the brilliance with. Letting a sigh escape his lips, he tore his gaze away and spotted a blond head a few chairs down, also watching the sunset. For a second, he thought it was Draco and felt a rush of delight spread out in him, but as the man turned, his face was all wrong, chiseled and entirely too masculine. Harry shook himself, and stood up.
"What can we do indeed," he pretended to ponder the issue as he headed to the dining room, his wife close on his heels. "I don't think there really is anything we can actually do. There is nothing in the article that is strictly speaking untrue. Though it is malicious." He sat down at the head of the table, looking around expectantly. "All we can do is try to keep Ron from attacking people."
He reached for the lube on the bedside table, and slicked his fingers, so that he could lubricate the opening. After that, he coated his own cock liberally, which was rock hard, and slightly oozing his fluids. Harry took a deep breath, forcing himself to relax a bit. He lined himself up, and Draco spread his legs out further, to make more room for him. He was watching Harry intently, his eyes clouded with desire. Harry slowly inched himself in, breathing hard as the tip was in. The orifice was incredibly tight, inspite of all the stretching he had done. He looked down to see himself inside, the pink cock in front of him standing hard. When he was sure he wasn't going to come, he went in deeper, until he was fully in the other man's body. He sighed, and looked up to see Draco's face. He was smiling.
Harry was a bit miffed about what the man was saying. He clearly thought him to be stupid and not even a bit clever. He thought about correcting the bloke, but then he realised that perhaps it was for the best if he was considered unassuming and easily led.
"Good morning, Harry. Are you just going to gawk at my house all day long, or do you actually intend to come in?" He smirked at the man before him.
The proceeded to have a pleasurable breakfast together, which included feeding each other fruits, and eventually lead to the tray being discarded onto the floor. Harry found it a lot better way to wake up than the previous year.
"You're right." Harry blushed. Sometimes he still found it hard to remember that things had changed since school. "Sorry," he added.
The eldest Weasley seemed very proud at being asked and Harry had to hide his smile behind his cup. So far, all was going according to Malfoy's plan. He had suggested that some flattery would entice the Weasleys to be as helpful as possible.
Harry went back to the dining-room and resumed eating. He also asked Dinky to take up some food for Hermione, just in case she felt up to eating something.
"You wanted to have lunch with me for a reason," Harry started after he gave up waiting for her to do so.
Draco's head popped into view above him, and Harry was glad that he could only see the faint outline in the darkness and without his glasses.
Hermione winced at the remark and Harry felt sorry for her. It meant spending Christmas away from her children.
“I have a reservation!” he said eagerly. He’s never had one before and he was very proud of himself for having thought of it weeks in advance. Okay, actually on January 2nd.
When Harry was done with the rest of the story of their stay, had passed the printed out pictures around, he took a deep breath, and plunged ahead with telling them what he had decided.
"But Ron is my brother and she wants to leave my family. She belongs with  us, with Ron now, you know that. "
"I don't see why not. I'll probably have to discuss it with the tutor, but I'm sure he can handle two such well-behaved boys," he said, pointedly, making the warning to behave clear.
"If I got you the broom, you would ride it at home and the kids would want to go too. That would be dangerous for them. Besides, you have no need for a new broom. You hardly ever ride the one you have." He felt justified in his denial.
“Of course!” Ron affirmed, “What year do you want us to be?” He asked, crunching into a new Chocolate Frog from which he pulled at the head to pull it out
"Fine, I see you have a lot to say, so I'll take care of what's not my business, a little further," he replied in a tone without calling, before he quickly walked away.
“I’m not a Death Eater, Potter, and regarding your memory loss, Ron and the Aurors are going to do everything they can to get you out of there, so
Harry had never seen Malfoy look at him like that. He squeezed, and swallowed before scraping his throat, turning away his eyes, feeling much too embarrassed to continue to challenge him.
The beautiful fireplace with aristocratic moldings diffused a gentle warmth in the small office, denoting largely with the place in which it was located.
“Do what you want, but it doesn’t change anything for me. I made a promise and I intend to keep it.” He replied, with his dragging voice stooping down to pick up his cape which he had lost during the kiss.
“It didn’t seem to bother you that much when you were yelling at me to continue my little business…” Malfoy sneered, his eyes shining maliciously, crossing his arms on his bust.
He then plunged his hand into one of the pockets of his trousers to pull out his wand and made a wrist move towards the coffee maker who set on.
Harry frowned at the icy tone. He didn’t seem to have done anything wrong, and they hadn’t seen each other since the last nonverbal spell class he gave him.
Ron brought one of his fingers to his mouth and moistened it with his tongue before turning a page of his magazine, without taking the trouble to answer him.
Maybe he just imagined it after all and didn’t have to worry about the confused feelings that were rushing inside him when he was thinking about Malfoy and his fucking grey eyes.
Harry watched him suck one of his fingers to cover him with saliva and quickly turned his eyes to the ceiling when Malfoy pointed his finger at his orifice.
Draco has clenched his teeth to repress another crisis of tears and gripped his glass firmly between his fingers before carrying it back to his mouth to finish the contents.
They took the time to chat a little before heading to their next classes, which promised a long day’s work.
And Draco had given up the idea of trying on his suit, and he following Harry to their bed, devouring his lips avidly, lying on the sheets, Harry just above him. Draco squeezed his fingers a little tighter on the edge of the kitchen closet, remembering Harry’s lips eating his neck, his warm breath burning his skin. His jet black hair, tickling his chest, making him shiver, his heady perfume filling his nose.
Harry frowned, raising his eyes to Malfoy’s, without understanding. This one then passed a hand behind his neck, pressing it to bring him closer and crushed his lips on his.
Harry was totally in a trance with Malfoy in his head, nose, mouth and ears. He remembered the nightclub, the sensation of his tongue wrapped around his own and the fine, silky hair he had felt between his fingers. His moans were thicker and stronger and his hand accelerated on his dick.
This fucking ferret reported his attention on the man who now stroked his cheek and took his wrist to remove his hand and lower it with a cold gaze.
Harry shouted again when Ginny’s team scored a new try, clapping his hands, his eyes traveling through the stands. His gaze abruptly ends his run on the grass, in a small recess of the field.
“What the fuck are we doing here then? We have to go find them!” yelled at Harry, rising quickly, fists clenched along his body.
Harry sighed heavily, sticking one of his hands on his forehead and grabbed a few strands of his hair between his fingers.
“I still believe that he always knew it was me. I wouldn’t know how, but... I saw in his eyes that he knew...” Harry added, remembering the look of Malfoy on that famous day.
“It’s the last thing I wanted to do but I think we have some things to clear up, indeed” he sighed, in spite.
Harry frowned as he tried to unravel the situation.  What student would be so disturbed that he would be plunged him into an indeterminate sleep?
Harry could feel his pulse accelerating against the thin skin of his neck, beating at the rate of his jerky breathing as he tried to contain his discomfort and apprehension.
"To tell you the truth, I don't think I still hate you, not like before in any case. It's more of a habit than a real feeling. But I don't understand where you and Blaise were going?" he announced, taking great care to choose his words.
“It doesn’t change the fact that it’s Malfoy, Hermione, and whatever he’s trying to do, he’s still the son of a Death eater and a Death eater himself.” Ron jeered.
Malfoy’s hand accelerated and Harry had to cling to his shoulders to hold on. He was gasping under Malfoy’s pressing movements. He was biting his lip, moaning louder, grabbing the shirt under his fingers, his head tipping back to meet the wall. He contracted his lower belly when he felt Malfoy’s movements become erratic and he came, in a long groan, plunging his head into Malfoy’s neck to stifle his cry.
One of Malfoy’s hands detached from the bed to go to find Harry’s erection and gripped him firmly, a raucous scream escaped from his lips on this contact and he tilted his head back.
Ron had mentioned Kingsley, Harry couldn’t see how his best friend would have enough weight to put him on the spot. Perhaps with the help of his father? Or perhaps it was also part of a novelty of his future life…
"Cowardly!" Malfoy shouted at him, laughing. He then turned to Harry, who was clenching his fists and glancing at him. “Breathe Potter, or I think the vein on your forehead will burst,” he sneered.
Malfoy straightened up abruptly, tipping them over and leaning over him to reach out his arms and lay his hands flat on either side of Harry’s face.
Harry drank it and made a toast with Ron and Hermione before being joined by Ginny once she was changed. They spent the rest of the evening drinking and singing, before returning to their dormitories to finish their already well-started night.
“It still happens to me, but don’t worry, they’re not as violent as they used to be,” Harry lies in a little smile.
He took a step in his direction to be able to admire it in more detail, followed closely by Malfoy whom he heard sneering.
Malfoy didn’t move, still looking down on him, obviously not determined to take care of his erection which was beginning to hurt him.
Draco raised his arm between their bodies to enclose Potter’s waist and quietly put his hand on his hip before holding his breath and having them both Side-Along.
He sighed, noticing that he had not advanced more in his inner reasoning than in his lesson of the day. Raising his head, he leaned it against the tree, staring at the partly cloudy sky to rest his eyes.
“Count on it” he said, opening the door with a smirk, before crossing the threshold and disappearing behind.
Malfoy frowned, gently pressing the wound with his thin fingers, before taking out his wand and pointing it at it.
He finally found a table in an angle against one of the walls of the pub and settled there, removing his coat. Two candles were floating in its center and Harry lost himself in contemplation while waiting for Malfoy’s return with their drinks.
Harry felt a panic attack coming and turned around, discarding as he could the dancers on the dance floor, regaining the exit and the air from the outside that he absolutely needed, there, now!
Ginny closed her eyes taking a deep breath. Harry took the opportunity to get closer to her and held her tight. She circled his waist and he stroked her hair to relax her.
“And one night, you went up to the Astronomy Tower when I was already there. I used to go there to refocus myself, and it’s the first time I’ve seen you there. You didn’t say anything, you just stood there, looking at the landscape, and I enjoyed the silence between us. No sharp remarks, no spells cast by anger, just two confused souls seeking calm” He added, taking the picture in his hand, a slight smile in the corner on his lips. “And then it went on. Another night, this time, you were there before me and you started the conversation”
Harry could feel every part of his organ stretching under Malfoy’s burning replica which violently compressed every artery and made him bend under the mortal weight of his words.
“Get up, we have an hour before we have to go to your meeting with Theo” he announced, in a voice made hoarse by the rising desire.
Harry did not answer right away, his head was spinning a bit and he had difficulty concentrating on what the young man was saying to him.
Harry didn’t want to move, because he’d have to face reality. He didn’t want to cross Malfoy’s eyes, not knowing what attitude to adopt. Malfoy stepped back slowly, removing his hands from his waist and casted a quick cleaning spell.
The cold has been bitterer in recent days, although the sun is high in the sky, warming the students a little.
“Obviously, since I’m here studying to become one” he affirmed, without detaching his eyes from his book.
After he got dressed, he went looking for Ron and Hermione to tell them he was coming home. He didn’t know how much time had passed since his little interview with Malfoy and he had a furious desire to wash himself...
Seeing Malfoy in these conditions after trying to put words into what he was feeling only reinforced his feeling of discomfort. Greatly blurring the emotions that overwhelmed him as soon as he was by his side.
His trademark well in place, nevertheless hoping that it was not too cracked, he consented to turn vaguely towards the creaking, seeing two silhouettes approaching.
"Oh yeah? Have you looked at yours lately? You really have nothing to envy on this point if you ask me."
Walking down a paved driveway, they leaned on a barrier that ran along it and quietly finished their ice cream in silence.
“Just a courtesy call, that’s all. But judging from the tone of your voice, I feel like I’m not welcome?” he replied, raising a skeptical eyebrow.
Too much affected by the hatred that had passed through him at that moment and by the use of a spell that he did not know the effects of until he cast it at him.
He allowed himself to be guided by Malfoy’s expert mouth, which began with a very sweet kiss, barely pressing his lips, as if to accustom him to his own. Then he opened them to caress those of Harry with his tongue which let it pass to embrace Harry’s tongue.
Harry had just finished climbing the last step of the staircase which separated him from the second floor landing, the breath was running short of he having to hurry so as not to arrive late.
His almost white blonde hair flew slightly in the wind. His head back, his eyes closed, his mouth half open that let out some groans. His breath became more and more erratic as the body leaning over him maltreated his neck with hot kisses.
"No, please stop taking me for a git. I know there’s more and I’m sure it has something to do with the bloody ferret!”
“I wish, in the future, you wouldn’t say my first name again please” Harry said, embarrassed, fleeing Malfoy’s gaze.
“They’re working. It shouldn’t have been, but their wedding was cancelled, so they moved their leave.” Malfoy jeered, in his dragging voice.
Draco could feel Potter’s fingernails crawling into the flesh of his back, scratching his skin on one of his shoulder blades while little black dots danced before his eyes. Harry came in turn, pulling heavily on Draco’s hair as his head tipped back and broke the kiss. A raucous and heavy moan escaped from his half-open lips that Draco saw totally now.
A clear and cold sneer escaped from Malfoy’s lips, his abdomen shaking with small tremors as he continued to scowl at him.
The Slytherin sighed, playing with the amber liquid in his glass that he was gently spinning in his hand. He never thought that returning to Hogwarts would be so easy, he who thought to receive a ton of insults for almost killing Dumbledore, or for taking part in the war on the wrong side.
Frowning, he raised his head slowly to see a dress appear different from his own in many ways. Already, the quality of the fabric seemed better and the colour of the inner sides was not that of the Gryffindor but that of the Slytherin judging by the blazon pinned on the bust of the person who stood before him.
He quickly stood up in a pronounced scraping of the bench which made him wince then followed his classmates in haste.
His heart was beating very hard in his chest and he took a deep breath, which he blocked in his lungs and went one last step forward.
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath that stuck in his lungs. He focused on the spell he wanted to cast and the object that would be impacted. He clearly visualized Neville’s wand and saw it fly away from his hands once the spell was pronounced.
Still, no matter how much they worked, they always went to sleep in each other's arms. Even if they didn't always have sex.
As he was contemplating the book in front of him, staring at the woman on the cover, he heard Jingle Bells again. He turned around to see Draco Malfoy enter the shop. He had to school his features to hide the delight he felt upon seeing the man who was becoming his friend and ally in the recent months.
"I knew you didn't belong there, in spite of everything and your mum saved my life. She saved all of us."
“It’s good though. She has no idea what divorce means in the Wizarding world. I can have the kids taken from her and she would never see them again,” he spoke, shaking his right fist. “If she wants to see them again, she’ll have to come crawling back to me and ready to bear me more kids. Did you know that Fleur is expecting her third?” he asked, rounding on Harry, who shook his head. “I will not be beaten by any of my brothers. I’ll have the most children and make my parents proud.” He straightened and stopped his pacing as he said this.
"It wouldn't have worked. I sucked at the Unforgivables. Severus probably saved my life that day." His voice was still full of pain as he remembered his late godfather. "I was never really angry at you about that curse, even if I still have some scars. In a way, the pain felt like a relief. I felt more pain in my soul than the rips in my body from the curse. Then, what you did for us during and after the war ... I'll never be able to thank you enough for keeping me out of Azkaban. Your testimony on our behalf was what kept my mum and I out of there and gave my father a lighter sentence - even though he was such a bastard to you." He stopped and looked the other man in the eye. His own grey eyes were full of emotion and Harry was struck by how different he looked from the usual haughty Malfoy.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione cried, obviously distressed about his lack of knowledge. “The Wizengamot makes the laws. Seriously, didn’t you learn it as a part of the Auror training?”
"It wasn't serious. He'll probably be a bit disappointed that I'm off the market now, but he'll get over it."
Draco quickly cast a locking spell on the door, and then dropped to his knees. As he started to divest Harry of his trousers, the other man could just moan and think what a lucky guy he was.
She shared his blush a little and watched as the two took their places in front of her. They both picked up a cup and sipped, though Harry had a bit of a tough time handling the delicate china.
Draco smiled to himself and quickly got dressed. He moaned at the few articles of clothing he could wear. Reaching the bottom of the stairs he noticed that Harry was just pouring food on plates from a pan and putting them on the dining-table.
After a quick shower, where they managed to only kiss, Harry fell asleep with Draco Malfoy in his arms. He had never slept so peacefully.
Harry took the opportunity to get closer until he was barely three feet away. Malfoy swallowed his saliva before glaring at him.
Never mind his reason, never mind Ron, his desire for Malfoy defied all understanding anyway. Harry let the wave of desire sweep through his entire being, forgetting all that was not Malfoy moaning openly below him.
“Oh don’t be, really, I really appreciate this aspect of your personality, it gives me the right to be as unpleasant as you!” Blaise replied, in a grin.
His breath stuck in his chest at the delightful sight of Potter, prey to the incredible orgasm that had just finished him off.
Malfoy looked at him for a moment, arched an eyebrow, seeming to ask him if this was really what he wanted. As if to answer him, Harry stroked his pale bust with his hand, lowering it to his belly, and finally resting on his groin, marking a slight pressure on the erection of Malfoy who contracted his jaw, holding back a moaning. But Harry saw in his eyes that he had understood, when Malfoy got up to take off his last clothes and sit again on his bed, as naked as he was.
Harry suddenly realized that he had just learned Apparition, having succeeded in doing them after only a few courses with Mc Gonnagall, during the few months that elapsed from his sixth year.
Harry knew that Hermione was not fooled, he still felt his gaze upon him as an accusation, an affront that made him feel guilty of hiding the truth about what he really felt.
“I thought so. I still think so.” he nodded, looking George right in the eye. “He’s a jerk, but he’s not bad.” he added, raising a shoulder. “And then that’s air through the engine now, and it’s true that he’s good at what he does.” he concluded by looking at Malfoy again.
The wizard therapist’s silhouette appeared on the threshold of the door which he closed behind him, before turning completely in front of Harry.
The stadium around him became a little more blurred but the training continued and Angélina had already left, in possession of the Quaffle, towards the opposing goals.
They’ve never really had a threat in almost two years now. Once, the general alert rang in all the offices of the Ministry causing panic among some not accustomed to being in the field. Harry immediately grabbed his wand and joined Ron who was already on guard to prepare for the threat.
“I knew it was bullshit, this "change" thing, it’s in the genes, when you’re as rotten from the inside as he is, it’s for life!” Ron claimed.
The sentence was about to come down. Draco was smiling full of teeth, feeling Potter panic to his left, waiting for the cleaver to fall.
On one of them, he was right beside him, Harry saw himself glancing at him and making a little grin while Malfoy looked at the lens, raising an arrogant eyebrow.
Ron stared at him for a long time before returning to his original position on the bed and unfolding his magazine.
However, he would never have thought that they were so. He had dropped his feather when he heard Malfoy’s voice and raised his head so quickly that he had smashed his neck bones.
He didn’t want Malfoy to take him, he was old enough to do it himself. But, he didn’t have direct access to St Mango’s and obviously Malfoy would never let him go alone.
Then he silenced all the other thoughts undoubtedly turned on Malfoy and his fucking new sensations that were floating inside him and hurried head down to the second floor to recover the answers he had need. The ones that would explain why he came to this.
Harry shuddered despite the heat that filled the room. Malfoy was all over him... and he liked it, he knew he shouldn’t, but it was stronger than him.
Harry squeezed his teeth, trying to chase away this unwanted picture that persisted to remain embedded in his retina.
So Harry looked down on him, showed him he wasn’t the pawn he hoped for. That he had enough self-respect to stay and watch him without leaving the room after what they’d done.
Malfoy wrinkled his eyes. He lowered his hand, which still held a few strands of his black hair between his fingers, and pinned it on his neck to draw him sharply towards him.
Opening his eyes, Harry risked a look at him, looking at his face focused on his task, his eyebrows wrinkled, his head leaning slightly to the side while he bit a corner of his lip, making meticulous gestures that made Harry vibrate.
He lingered a little too long on the mouth of Malfoy who realized it since he passed his tongue on his lips. Harry swallowed, blinking his eyes and then lifts them up to Malfoy’s.
"Lunch? When would I have cooked, Harry? You lent the house-elves to Mum to help her with the many children that stayed over."
"Oh, well, yeah. I tried to be a good friend to Hermione and help her in seeing what was right, but it didn't work." He bowed his head in mock defeat.
"No way do I want that disgusting man, Potter,” he was still whispering, even though there was no one around them. “I may be gay, but one, I top, two, his idea of sex is not what I would prefer. Frankly, I like to keep my partners more or less intact. His previous toy expired after a month and it wasn't pretty. Also, Potter, if you haven't noticed, I said ‘body slave tattoo', not Dark Mark. It would be the one that he specifically designed for his toys. It keeps the possessor of escaping, or ever having sex with anyone else. It may do some other nasty things, but I'd rather not find out what," the blond revealed.
"But it does. To me." Harry wished that he had some Firewhisky in his system again, but if he did, then Draco wouldn't believe him. "It felt right. And good. Look, I'm scared of what that may mean, but these recent months I've learned that I didn't like my life. I thought it was perfect, but now I just don't know how I could. It was like being asleep and now I'm finally awake. I thought I wanted to be an Auror." Harry frowned. "I do love helping people, but I never liked violence, being a slave to hierarchy and Ministry bureaucracy. As a politician, I can help more people than ever before. I didn't see the world around me for many years. I never noticed how unhappy Hermione was, or how much of a bigot Ron was. Even if I did see it, I ignored it. I also ignored just how bad my marriage was. I hated a lot of things about the house we lived in, about the way we lived, but I never said a thing."
As they passed, Harry noticed that Draco was standing behind them. The younger Malfoy man was wearing a smirk on his face and had his eyes locked with someone. Harry followed his line of sight to spot a dark-haired man of obvious Mediterranean descent with a similar expression. Harry realised that it was Adrian. Adrian smiled then, and quietly parted from the crowd in the direction of the Floo as well. Draco followed in a few moments.
"Fine, Hermione." Harry was speaking loudly enough by then so that all who wanted to could hear everything. "You are a disgrace as a woman, a wife and a mother. You have gone against the wishes of your husband and when he rightfully demanded that you do as told, you left him. Now you have the audacity to want to rip your children away from the Weasley family - where they belong. With such an attitude you are no longer welcome in my house."
"Of course they are, Potter! You surround yourself with hypocritical Light  Wizards and then you're surprised when their prejudices show." Malfoy  frowned and shook his head. Then he calmly walked away.
"No, Harry! Don't you try to send me home! That bitch is still wearing my name and as long as she does, whatever she is up to reflects on me."
"Don't be silly. Where would you put them? A couple of other families are staying here too. Tomorrow it'll be like one big family picnic. It'll be fun, you'll see."
"Harry, you know that even my father got passed his prejudices. We learned to give credit where credit is due."
"Oh, eh, yes." It all felt rather surreal to Harry, and he even considered that he had been transported into another universe. Lucius Malfoy was making small talk and still smiling. It was rather unnerving.
"I..." Harry, to his own amazement found himself considering the offer. The boy was really pretty, but as he thought about it, another boy came to mind, who had grown into a beautiful, blond man. "Really, no."
"So true, Astoria," agreed another woman, though Harry had no idea who she was, he couldn't even see her. He did decide that is was better to eavesdrop if he wasn't seen, so he left the opening, but still managed to hear everything.
Harry laughed a little at the sight of that expression. That was when Hermione entered the room, greeted Harry and sat down opposite him in Draco's old place.
"Go ahead. Thanks to that little law you and blondie passed, I can have the children, your money, the house, everything. You can slobber all over the bookworm now. What Ron saw in her is beyond me."
"True. However, once you get to know the dark families I'm sure you'll find people who will get close to you. It won't be the same, though. Is it too much to sacrifice?" Draco looked at him with an expression that allowed him to back out from all of it. Harry sighed and shook his head.
"Of course, Hermione," Lucius answered. He even bowed a little and while executing it, he snuck a peek at Ron, who just sputtered incoherently. Malfoy offered his elbow to her and they both regally walked towards the Floo.
"Not if I can help it. Usually wars in the Wizarding world require strong leaders that people can stand behind. However, if we are such strong leaders and we keep the fighting limited to words only, I'm hoping we can find a peaceful solution." He looked pleased at Harry engaging him more. " One way of changing how people think about Muggles and Muggle-borns is with the power of words. That is why we are actually introducing new terminology. Magic-users are people who are able to use magic. Wizards and witches are those who participate and live in the Wizarding world. So we are actually moving towards not distinguishing between blood but rather culture." He stopped to catch his breath.
“No, Potter,” he said, bringing an end to the dark-haired man’s good mood. “It’s not that simple. Weasley has the votes and you can’t just take them back whenever you want to. He was given the votes because you were unfit as a minor. Of course, it was Dumbledore, the Chief Warlock, who appointed him as the guardian of your votes.” He paused a bit, considering his next words. Harry got the sense that Malfoy wanted to remark on that piece of the past, but eventually decided not to. “Since you never claimed them, you still have to prove that you are fit to hold the positions. Only the others can vote you back in. So you would need to convince the Light Families that you’re on their side, while also giving a reasonable explanation why you would like to have the votes now. If they know you want to change a law, they’ll never side with you. Although, in order to actually change the law, you would need the support of one side.”
The Gryffindor had told the others about Ron being eager to slow down the divorce process after hearing about Hermione's new beau. Draco was very smug that his plan had worked. He sat in the chair with a satisfied air about him and grinned at Harry over the rim of his teacup.
Ron next to him was undoubtedly a Chudley Cannons player. His orange robes clashed horridly with his hair and even Harry cringed at the sight. Of course, he couldn't identify which one because he didn't follow Quidditch all that much anymore, just the major events. The Cannons hadn't made it to anything important in a long while. The younger Weasley was currently doing what he always did when presented with a vast amount of food. He was shovelling it into his mouth, grinning around his mouthful. He quickly got up once his plate was empty, probably going for another helping. Harry stared after him for a moment, but quickly diverted his attention to Arthur.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Politics was not his forte, but he knew where he could get help. Therefore, he brought forth his friendliest grin and directed it towards the man in front of him.
"Harry, it's okay, you have to," Hermione said, though her quiet voice was a bit hard to hear over the blood rushing in his ears, but the way she touched his hand made him look down on her. "I understand what Malfoy is saying. They are not going to vote for you while you oppose their ideals. It will only be for a little while. At least you'll have your family back with you. I'm sure I can find another place to stay. It will be just pretending."
“Oh really? You are such an expert in relationships, Malfoy?” she said, not being able to let that slide. “I never heard of you dating anyone. Your marriage just came out of the blue.”
Well, this is the last real chapter, just the epilogue to go. I started on that, but if you guys have any lingering questions, then tell that in a review, and I’ll put that into the epilogue.
Ginny extracted herself from his arm and disappeared in the direction of the romance novels. The two men watched her go and Mr. Blotts returned behind his counter.
Back on the streets, the weather was getting worse. The last of the autumn leaves swirled around and Harry burrowed his face in his scarf. They hurried into Fairyland, one of the toy shops on Diagon Alley that opened after the war.
"True, but he said something that got me thinking. Do you know the differences between Light and Dark Wizards?" he asked the question that had been bothering him for a while.
Harry couldn’t understand why Ron was acting the way he was. He didn’t seem like the person that Harry knew. Instead, he was horrified at what he was hearing and didn’t know how to respond. This wasn’t his friend.
Harry was amazed that the two older Malfoys would be looking after the children. They were not the typical grandparents. However, he knew that he could trust them, so he just nodded and off they all went, presumably towards the pool room.
Harry cringed a little at the sudden light. He was looking at Draco a bit perplexed, as the fog that the dream had created slowly lifted from his mind. Then he recalled that the dream was actually a memory of his last birthday.
"It's okay, Hermione. Apparently, the book that I found is rare and was the last one printed on the subject. It's over a hundred years old! The Shoppe owner explained this to me when I bought it. And I only know that much, I was too sleepy to read more last night," Harry said, blushing. He was used to Hermione knowing everything and him listening with wide eyes.
Harry Potter finally turned 17. He did not get a birthday cake, or any presents, as per usual. Well, perhaps he did, but he never found out. As the clock struck midnight, signalling the fact that he was of age, he immediately cast a charm on himself that made him undetectable to owls, or other magics. His second deed on his birthday was to apparate out of the hell hole that his aunt's house was straight to an alley near Gringotts.
"Sir, I can assure you that I'm not involved with Ron's wife," Harry said,  trying not to sweat. He had the sudden urge to speak without pause and  reveal anything the man wanted. If Greer had asked about Horcruxes, Harry  would have told him everything.
"Mr. Mildew, I know that politics is hard and that I'm not very knowledgeable in the area. However, that is why I rely on men like Mr. Weasley and you to help me learn how to become a good and valuable member of the Wizengamot. Over time and with guidance, I'm sure I'll manage."
As he was nearing the house finally, he saw the albino peacocks he remembered prancing around a manicured lawn and on both sides great white fountains spurted out jets of water. They did not have any statues of people on them, even though he expected something like what he had seen during the war at the Ministry. The decorations on these fountains were just fish and flowers.
The dark-haired man followed and soon found himself in a great library. As far as the eye could see, there were books standing on gleaming walnut shelves. To the right, he saw some winding stairs leading up to what he assumed to be the second floor. In the middle, was the study area with a few matching desks and further back, there were some very soft looking leather sofas. On one of the sofas, the man he had been seeking was lounging. A mug of something steaming was in his right hand and an open book resided in his left hand. He looked very relaxed as his trouser-clad legs were lying on the sofa exposed by the open robe he was wearing. Harry doubted that he had ever seen Malfoy look so incredibly at ease. He approached him, his footsteps were swallowed up by the thick carpeting.
"You don't have to. Let's just leave the past behind us. We both wronged each other and then helped each other. I think it has all evened out in the end. Now, we will work together and make sure that our children will never have to know what it's like to live in a war."
"All right, I'll admit probably no one would like that," Harry admitted, but then realised what Malfoy said first." Wait, you're gay? Since when?"
Their food was as beautiful as advertised. Harry decided to make a toast, since he had discovered that he was actually really good at making toasts.
Harry was painfully aroused. That much he knew. He also knew he wanted to explore further. He couldn't remember any girls' kisses ever affecting him so much, but he was also afraid. The thought of embracing what he felt was terrifying. It wasn't just the physical aspect. Kissing Draco felt so right, as if it was the one thing he was missing from his life. When he was still happy with Ginny, she felt like home. Draco, however, felt like fire; deliciously warm, almost burning, and still consuming. He felt alive. He didn't want the feeling to stop. It wasn't just about the physical things that Draco made him feel, either. All his life he had been looking at the blond, and while he kept telling himself that he was checking what his enemy was up to, he had been lying to himself. He had been watching the strangely beautiful pale boy he had met in the robe shop. Draco was also smart, intelligent, and he enjoyed his company. In their adulthood their differences had become milder and their similarities strengthened. Harry wanted to be with him. He wanted to be the one to whisper dirty things in his ear on a balcony in the middle of a party. He wanted that lean body in his arms and those lips on his. However, he also wanted to feel so calm, secure and at peace with the world as he has when he slept next to Draco in the greenhouse
Harry did as he was told and entered the Manor. He didn't see anyone in the foyer and considered that he should have sent a message that he was coming, but in his haste he forgot. As he was wondering where to search for one of the inhabitants of the house, he heard steps approach from the left and he looked down the corridor. The small figure who made his way towards him was Scorpius Malfoy. He was glad to see the child as all their interactions had been pleasant, and the boy was always knowledgeable about the whereabouts of the members of his family.
Harry nodded in understanding and took a swallow of his tea. It had a soothing taste that he enjoyed. He wasn't looking forward to socialising with those people, but it was for a good cause and he had done worse for a good cause.
When he arrived, instead of taking up his customary position beside Hermione, he sat down next to Draco.
"For a few more months, probably. We'll probably be ready at the start of the new year," the blond assured him.
“Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Thinks-He-Can-Do-Anything. No we can’t change their bloody minds, Potter!” Malfoy was getting very irritated by the things coming out of the other man’s mouth. He took a deep breath to still himself. His voice was calm as he went on. “The Wizengamot is divided up into two parts, as always: the Light and the Dark Families. Both have their own agendas. You may be able to sway a few families on minor issues, but not on major issues like family law, or education. Especially not since Arthur Weasley holds three votes in his hands!”
They lapsed into silence. Draco was obviously waiting for Harry to start speaking. However, he had to wait a while as he was well on his way to consuming his second glass of Firewhisky by the time Harry opened his lips again.
"I know. You are a smart witch, Hermione, in spite of having made the grievous error of marrying Weasley," he admitted. "Now we only have to decide how to go about it. First of all, Potter needs to have a spectacular, public falling out with you. Preferably shouting at the top of his lungs about how much he wants you to return to your husband," the blond man said, contemplating just how to set up the scene. "Then you move out and move into Malfoy Manor in a huff. We should be seen around Diagon Alley shopping and in the more posh Wizarding restaurants, to show people that I'm educating you and to generally introduce you to the upper regions of society. You, Hermione," he made sure that he had her full attention, "can tell all that will hear that Potter only took you in, in an attempt to convince you to return to the Weasel and once you refused him once and for all, he kicked you out. I will add to that by telling everyone how I heard about your plight and as the Weasleys are an old enemy, I decided to help you. Meanwhile, we also decided to show people that with proper education you can become a part of Wizarding culture," he finished, smiling even more at the wonderful plan he concocted.
Later that day, when Harry was in his room, alone in his bed, trying to fall asleep, he was thinking of Draco. He too had taken to calling him that since it seemed like they were going to establish a working relationship, perhaps even a friendship. When the man wasn't trying to ruin him, he was actually not so bad. He let himself wonder a bit about what it would have been like if he hadn't meet Ron on the train, but rather ran into Draco again. Could they have become friends? He could have been in Slytherin House. The difference between such a life and the one he had would have been enormous. Still, he let himself be swept away in the fantasy and it even reached his dreams. He saw himself with the Snitch in his grasp, in dark green Slytherin robes, and smiling towards a Chaser Draco who grinned back and gave him a playful wink.
"Yeah, Malfoy, sorry. I'm just realising that it's not going to be as easy as me walking in there, demanding a vote and going out with my Wizengamot seats, is it?"
Their first course arrived in a few minutes and it was one of the bubbling soups. Harry expected blueberries or something like that, but tasted mushrooms. It was actually very delicious and the bubbling felt funny in his mouth. He polished it off with a smile and was in a much better mood after having something in his stomach finally, even though he was breaking his diet. Mushrooms were among the banned foods.
"I still don't understand why you feel this way so suddenly. You seemed happy and content before," Harry noted.
By morning, he had joined the others half asleep, nobody having really recovered from the liters of ButterBeer and the small ovens swallowed during the evening. So it was not difficult to hide his catatonic state from his friends who were not at their best either.
Without paying more attention to him, Malfoy grabbed the shirt hanging on the edge of the shower before gracefully donning it and meticulously closing the buttons.
When he returned to his room, he ran aground on the bed, holding his stomach, tears of disgust streaming down his cheeks.
"You mean you really don't have anything against this kind of practice?" he says, wrinkling his eyes.
“Worst…” he growled, breathing again on the smoke coming out of his mug. “Ginny wants me to accompany her to all the wedding tastings. She has already booked slots without consulting me to test the various caterers.” he added, rolling his eyes. “Last week I had to choose between lilac or roses on the guest tables!” he complained, drinking a new sip of coffee, “But who gives a shit about fucking flowers, honestly?”
That his body could no longer stand him while he rushed into an abyss where Nott’s voice murmured and where he and Malfoy kissed.
He was anxious to discuss all this with Dumbledore and if he knew that Pomfrey wouldn’t hold him back, he would have already left here to go into his office and confront him with explaining everything he knew.
It had absolutely nothing to do with how he felt about Ginny when he had saw her again. It had been totally different, almost bland next to the whirlwind of emotions that had passed through him when he found himself facing Malfoy.
Harry looked at him in silence as his words were circling in his head, unable to calm the anger and bitterness that was taking hold of him.
“You shamefully plagiarized me, yes! I should have tabled it before giving you the opportunity to do so.” he growled, grabbing his drink hard and spilling a little whiskey on the table.
Their shoulders grazed as he passed by his side, the contact making them both flinch. Harry caught himself inhaling the smell that reached his nostrils, no doubt the perfume of Malfoy which he recognized for having already felt it while they were Side-Along, slapping himself mentally for doing such a thing.
Then, with a tense smile, he began to remove his shoes, throwing them to the ground, removing his winter cloak which fell at his feet.
It hurt so much it was good, it radiated and neither of them held back. Malfoy moved against him, their hands winding their erections that shocked each other and this move made Harry moan again, still raising the temperature in his body.
She turned to face him, her orange eyes peering at his, looking for the same burning desire that he read in her. Harry didn’t really know if he wanted to, but he let her take the lead, too stunned by his infatuation.
Draco smiled, raising his eyebrows encouraging him to share what he was thinking. Harry blinked, quickly turning away from his face, visibly unaware that he was staring at it intensely and concentrated on a corner of the coffee table before taking another sip of wine.
A light perfume enveloped the air at the place where the silhouette had probably been observing him a few minutes earlier and the subtle and fresh smell made him open wide his eyes when he thought to recognize it.
Potter abandoned the cork and stared at him with his incredibly green eyes, in a determined gaze that took Draco's breath away for a moment.
He had met Ron who had just cast a “Stupefy” to a wizard before raising his head in his direction. He had opened wide his eyes when he saw him limping clumsily to a safer place and immediately rushed to support him.
The anger took place in the midst of this whirlwind of emotions and his little strangled cries came to break the silence of the night.
Harry swallowed with difficulty and took a deep breath knowing full well that he could not hold his words.
Yet, he had never completely managed to hide his feelings in the presence of Potter. One of the many other Harry's faculties that Draco had faced irreparably.
Malfoy, still seated on his bed, turned his eyes in his direction before raising a sceptical eyebrow.
The atmosphere was harsh and seemed to weigh on his entire body as he crossed the threshold. His footsteps echoed on the tiled floor and he noticed that the temperature had dropped sharply in this part of the Ministry.
Draco put a knee on the blankets, and leaned silently over Potter. He then raised one hand and gently placed it on his shoulder, which he began to shake.
“Don’t tell me, I can’t get my hands on the document I’ve needed since this morning” he says, snooping through the scrolls on his desk.
Potter ended up sitting down too, putting the parchment beside him before sticking his incredible green eyes in his own.
Malfoy had changed in recent years and in a good way. Harry didn’t know why, but he was glad he was okay, and he stretched a little smile to that last thought.
