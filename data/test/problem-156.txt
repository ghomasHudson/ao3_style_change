“I do. I want to be with you. So fucking much.”
Harry gave a sharp nod. “It’s good...fuck, Draco, it’s good.”
“Is that a problem?”
“Their
— and feels something painful twist in his gut. Draco is still holding on to that piece of information, hiding it even from people he considers his friends.
“Do you want to talk through it, then? I thought writing down everything that appeals to us for a career might be a good start. It should give us a good basis for personality tests and discussion.”
“That’s not… what I was going to say.” Harry hesitated, fiddling with his fork. He’d totally forgotten how to eat food.
Instead, nothing had happened.
Granger straightened and pushed her hair out of her eyes. She watched Draco in silence.
“Look at you,” Potter says. His eyes are so bright. “Look at
They’re standing so close, Malfoy propped against the kitchen table, Harry chest to chest with him. Harry can see the tiny flecks of gold in Malfoy’s grey irises. When Malfoy speaks, his warm breath bathes Harry’s face.
“Do you see me complaining?” Draco lifts a defiant eyebrow. “I know why you did it. I know you didn’t know what the spell did. Fucking let it go now.”
“Fine.” Draco places a hand on his desk — his rings clink on the polished dark wood — and stands. “I will show you a trick.” He unties his silk scarf and folds it, puts it on the corner of his desk. “But only because your pathetic sex lives are spoiling the atmosphere of this office,” he walks around his desk and to the middle of the room, “and I can’t be the only person taking one for the team every weekend.”
Malfoy doesn’t speak, and neither does Harry. All Harry does is nod — a frightened, hesitant jerk of the chin — and Malfoy lowers Harry’s briefs with a slow grin.
“Let’s see if your arse is as amazing as it was ten years ago,” growled Harry, advancing towards Malfoy.
he hadn’t noticed. He was walking at his usual brisk, elegant pace, seemingly unhampered by the snow and the irregular terrain, his chin held high like he owned the place. The place being the mountainous slopes of Ben Macdui, in the Cairngorms National Park, currently covered in feet of snow and very much
“We’re really doing this, aren’t we?” Harry asks in a low voice, his eyes on his hand stroking Draco’s skin.
With a sigh, Harry walks back towards the landing.
Harry lifts his hands to cup his face, brings their lips together, halfway between a kiss and a devouring hunger. He rocks his hips forward and his cock aligns with Draco’s, so desperately hard they both moan into each other’s mouth.
“Oh, sweet fucking Merlin…” Draco whimpers, eyes wide. “You’re going to… to…”
“Didn’t have the chance...last time,” Draco confessed, his breath hot against Harry’s bare skin. He felt Harry tremble under his palms. “Can I—kiss you?”
The flip side of these memories assails Harry with equal force and frequency: he can’t forget the whiplash of Malfoy’s Disapparation. He remembers standing dumbly in a cloakroom aisle in the aftermath, his softening dick still out, scrambling to pull his pants and trousers back on before Ron could find him.
“A Niffler,” came Luna’s dreamy voice from behind them. “They’re such fantastic creatures, Draco. Do you know they have Nanticoot-repelling powers?”
“Yes,” Harry moaned. “You feel amazing, Malfoy, so hard, so hot—” His own orgasm was only starting to ebb when he felt Malfoy’s cock grow impossibly harder and then freeze deep inside him, before it pulsed, hot and slick, turning his hole filthy and wet on the last few pumps inside him.
Harry just stares back. “That’s a lot of money, but I’m not sure I understand why it’s a problem. The Malfoys have been wealthy for generations. That’s all Malfoy ever talked about in school. What he did with his family money is none of the Ministry’s business as long as it’s not illegal, is it?”
that’s

—right into the face of a formidable, stock-still Narcissa Malfoy.
The Niffler pushed the cover aside and climbed over Draco’s duvet. He had a look on this tiny face... Lucifer, there was something almost

Hannah winks at Draco. Draco would take great pleasure in watching the colour rise in Potter’s cheeks if he wasn’t sure he was blushing himself.

“Go away,
“So… does that mean I’ve got the job, Malfoy?”
It’s true, though. Scorpius establishing the use of given names was the first step towards a more personal relationship than Draco would have initiated.
Harry’s chest hurts. His eyes are burning. He feels the wetness in his eyes start to spill over his cheeks.
Draco wanted to curl up and live in those green eyes forever.
Draco snorts, rivulets of rain falling from his hair, running down his nose. “Time to head back. I’ve no plans to freeze my arse off in the rain just to listen to Harry Potter wax lyrical about me.”
“More like the knob-heads kind,” Ginny muttered. Everyone around the table nodded except Draco. He tore another piece of his napkin. This clearly was another Harry Potter mystery he’d been left out of by years of bad blood. Context clues suggested Christmas might not be the best time to ask about it.
And it will just be the beginning.
almost
Potter,” Malfoy said, mock-applauding. “A first-year spell and this is how you perform it?”
Dammit. No bedroom talk at work, Harry! We went over this, for Merlin’s sake.
A heavy silence falls after Draco’s words. They’re going to have to. If they want to keep up appearances — if they want to buy time, give Harry enough to convince the Ministry of Draco’s innocence…
Harry rolled his eyes. “
Draco stays quiet for a long time, his gaze down and away, his teeth worrying his bottom lip. Harry holds his breath and waits, while outside the office the night sky turns fully dark, yellow-grey clouds crossing it, the lights of the city reflecting on their rain-soaked edges.
“Oh, yes. Always,” said Draco. He tapped his fingers on his chin, pretending to think. “So... All is good in the human world. Child labour, starvation, disease, financial crises, general pettiness. Next to it, my minor acts of naughtiness and bullying seem a lover’s caress.”
At that, Potter laughed. “That leaves the socially awkward and sexually frustrated part. I knew we had things in common.”
“You will be in charge,” Malfoy’s slow drawl resounds in the warmth of his office, and the quiet formality of his tone is all the answer Harry needs, “of planning my trips and escorting me to and from the Caduceus offices in the City, where I go to on a daily basis, but also to any place and event where I need to be. You will do the same for my son, Scorpius, who goes to school three mornings a week and has appointments with his therapist two afternoons a week. In addition, you will also check any incoming post or parcels for curses and poison.” He keeps pacing, his lithe, graceful silhouette stark against the flames in the fireplace. It makes his hair glow gold. “You are expected to work closely with the other personnel under me: Ernestina, who is Scorpius’s nanny, and who’s also in charge of the house’s logistics; Jemima, my assistant; Lux, my driver. You will be holding a position formerly occupied by Gregory Goyle, who — as you very well know — is a close friend of mine. He was also deeply appreciated by the rest of my team. The success of your trial period will greatly depend on how well you get on and coordinate with these people. I need a team who’s united; I have no time or patience for dealing with quarrels and tempers. Disruptive elements tend to get sacked pretty quickly.” He stops pacing and finally looks up at Harry. “Is everything clear?”
“Circe,” Pansy exclaims as she drops in a chair by the cheeses. “I
“No kidding,” he muttered.
“And that is…?”
Hermione covers her mouth.
“Is it serious between you two?” Ron asks. Harry expected Ron to tease him or scold him. Instead, his expression is grave and earnest.
“Where are you from, Ernestina?”
“Wandless self-defense. Trust me, it can come in handy.”
They climbed the stairs. Draco felt himself shiver and wrapped his winter cloak tighter around him. In the near-darkness, Harry’s eyes gleamed with humour.
— and he wondered if that was why they were so good at it together.
. He pushed himself more, skating faster. His breathing picked up speed and he let out an exhilarated exhale. There was so much joy in moving like this. He always forgot about it until he was flying, or skating, or running. Lucius had always only valued Quidditch for the prestige it could bring. Physical activity, with its lot of sweat, exertion and flushed faces, had always be deemed unfit of a Malfoy.
As if she hadn’t just had Harry’s wand pointed at her a second ago, Narcissa holds herself straighter and nods with impressively polite dignity.
all of this was just a far-off fantasy. He returned his husband's smile wholeheartedly, “And then we’re going to make a
“Yes.”
All right, I’ll be serious. Something I didn’t expect was how supportive the people who truly mattered were. Your friends and family, especially. I’ve had a healthy fear of Hermione specifically, ever since she punched me when we were schoolkids. I half-expected her to repeat her performance after finding out I was shagging you.
Harry braced his hands against the countertop and rammed back into Draco. “Will you touch me?” He sounded on the verge of begging. “Your hands on me...I need—”
Mind dwelling on the skating rink incident, Draco shrugged. “Okay.”
“You need me,” Harry breathes in response, and Draco’s trembling hand stills on the fabric of his robes. “Trust me when I say how much you’re going to need me.”
But for reasons that he doesn’t care to examine too closely, Harry feels compelled to take this one.
It’s dark. Nobody thought of building a new fire, or switching on the small lamp on Draco’s desk. And now nobody thinks of casting a Lumos
So here you go. The final proof. I really am as ridiculously stupid as you’ve always thought, Potter.”
“It is,” Harry says. “What a fucked-up piece of luck, right?”
“Wait...it’s real?” Draco was baffled. He would have thought this kind of news would have arrived to the magic world. He would have thought Mephistopheles, his appointed demonic mentor, would have shared the information when they’d meet. Not for the first time in recent months, it hit Draco like a Bludger in the face: how sheltered he’d been, how closed off from the wider world, working as a teenage demon in wizarding communities.
comfortable, a little voice that sounds like a cross between Pansy and Ernestina keeps telling him.
And actions, Harry can do.
He cleared his throat.
On behalf of the Department of Mysteries. It was all very formal, if that worries you. No breach of protocol that would impact the case against my company. At least until I answered personally and she… got rather enthusiastic about the prospect of our working together on her project.”
“I would. I am a demon, after all. Or have you forgotten?”
Another thought that Harry refuses to consider.
In the beginning, all I could see was the negative. Public opinion about me might be more favourable than in the past, yet I doubt I was Wizarding Britain’s favourite candidate for Harry Potter’s partner. I’ll admit, I was scared at first. Scared that you’d change your mind about us.
Malfoy did. It was possibly the only instance of him heeding a request from Harry, and Harry thrilled with that secret satisfaction. He strode out of the Great Hall as casually as he could with Malfoy in tow.
Harry felt his face heat, half in embarrassment and half in reluctant desire. Over the night, they’d fucked so many times, they’d acted so uninhibited, he had lost track of what had been said and done. In the soft daylight bathing the cabin, Malfoy’s filthy words and their unabashed hunger for each other felt surreal.
Ron had just patted Harry on the back in apology and left him alone. To Harry's own endless surprise, he’d thrown himself into the task, reading about Malfoy’s life with a hunger bordering on fascination.
Parvati had replied. ‘
“All right."
Draco couldn’t understand. Didn’t Harry see? Didn’t he see how
So he just says, “Fine. I’ll try to be more careful with my choice of words.”
About his life in Paris, laughing and sketching ideas for children’s equipment. Becoming friends with the most unlikely person he could have imagined — an older Spanish house-elf, smart as a whip and so ambitious, her faith in her own project was positively contagious. Things he’d always wanted to keep for himself, the piece of carefree youth he’d managed to scavenge from the ruins of war and the Malfoys’ fallen reputation. He’d ended up telling the Aurors about Nesting’s dividends and how he’d invested them in developing Juvence and the structure of Caduceus. The lawyer had sat next to him, her face grave, and hadn’t let the Aurors go until they’d promised Ernestina could be discharged for the night, considering the numerous holes Ella had poked in the current wizarding laws. She’d been able to dig out some obscure legal precedents from the European Wizarding Court that Draco hadn’t been aware of, and that could apply to his case. According to her, nowhere was it written, in fact, that Ernestina’s and Draco’s association was illegal.
Just then, the front door opened, letting a brush of cold air and a burst of familiar voices in. Luna craned her neck to see who was coming in, her eyes bright with joy.
“So you work for — Draco’s mother?”
To the readers who waited for this fic to be done before reading: I sincerely hope the story makes sense as a whole, and not just chapter by chapter :) I wrote this in about a month, and it's hard to have any perspective on it for the moment :) It might be imperfect on many levels, but it's still been an incredibly fun ride for me. I hope it shows, and I hope you had a good time reading, too!
“There’s really nothing to be said about it…” Harry had shaken his head at Draco’s frown. “Not tonight, anyway.”
“What’s a good name for a Niffler?” Luna said, placing Jeff on her shoulder. Jeff, resigned to his fate and determined to make a good impression, curled around her scarf.
“Like zis?” Gabrielle asks with a timid bat of her lashes. She drops a hair pin, bends to grab it, and lifts back up, her curtain of golden hair elegantly swept to the side of her neck.
the castle to be cold and drafty and
“Hello, Mistor Potter, sir,” she says with a light foreign accent that vaguely rings a bell, her r’s rolling and her vowels flowing. “Thank you for coming. Ernestina is bringing Mistor Potter to the waiting room, sir.”
The question has been nagging him since he left St Mungo’s, but he didn’t dare bother anyone about it. Draco had told him it would take weeks for Scorpius to recover, and the little boy’s family was probably too busy taking care of him to indulge Harry’s concerns. That was when Harry had realised, truly and definitely realised, how much he’d come to care for Draco and everyone around him. How much more than a simple case was at stake for him, if Draco decided to discharge him.
Draco’s birthday dinner is surprisingly delightful despite the mismatched crowd. They all gather in Draco’s study, the wide open French doors letting the sounds and smells of a late spring evening drift inside. After a few minutes where everybody seems to stare stonily at one another, Scorpius interrupts the stilted conversations by announcing he’s going to play a piano piece for his father’s birthday.
“I asked you what you were humming just now.”
When Dennis Creevey rang the doorbell, Luna jumped off her armchair to greet him. Draco welcomed the break. He felt oddly wrung out, his shirt sticking to his armpits in an uncomfortable, cold sweat. He cast a tired
It was all the indication Harry needed, because a second later, he was grabbing Draco by the collar of his shirt and pushing him up against the countertop lining the side of Luna’s kitchen.

“Exactly,” Hermione nodded. “I think he spent every summer holiday in Little Whinging. Maybe Hastings, occasionally, when his Muggle relatives felt like seeing the sea. They were the

“Big day tomorrow. It’s been a pleasure.”
I was spoilt and hateful, and I looked down at everyone who wasn’t like me. And the worst part was that I was still envious of the things others had that I didn’t, as if the world were nothing but a zero-sum game.
He heaved a sigh of relief. And then a certain white-blond git standing in front of the buffet turned in his direction, and Harry felt the Great Hall tilt.
They shared a look, smothering their giggles behind their hands like schoolboys.
Scorpius nods again, more eagerly this time.
Malfoy watches him, eyes wide. If the light weren’t so dim, Harry would think he looked… almost disappointed. “That’s… quite alright, Potter.”
“Do what?” Draco snaps, unable to keep the defensiveness out of his tone.
Harry studies him while pretending to be absorbed in the swirling patterns of steam rising from his mug.
“God, you’re the worst,” Potter murmured, his voice full of spite. “I forgot just how rude and self-absorbed you are.”
“Does Mephisto know you’re here? Because you’ve been spying on me for Lucifer knows how long, and you still haven’t said anything that would remotely look like an actual check-in.” He leaned in, bringing his face close to Jeff’s. “You want something from me, and you were hoping to make it look like sage advice from my mentor’s pet. Possibly in exchange for something.” He lifted the fist enclosing the signet ring. “Shall I venture a guess as to what it is?”
“Welcome,” Harry said, leaning closer, the whole left side of his body touching Draco’s right. Draco put the almond in his mouth and watched Harry. The candle on their table gave off a soft halo of light, reflecting against his glasses and highlighting his dark hair.
He’s spent so many years not knowing that that person existed, not knowing that he’s already met them, that they were within his reach. Just because he’s realised it under more than shifty circumstances doesn’t make it any less real.
Harry lets go of his wrists and is instantly on him again, kissing, moaning,
“His aura was never pretty to begin with,” she continued as though Draco’s sunny afternoon hadn’t taken a darker shade. “It was always murky and dark. Not like yours.”
Still laughing, Hermione unfolds the pushchair in one click and sits a babbling, smiling Hugo in it.
reflected on his pale irises and his pointy, patrician features. Then... he smiled. Reluctantly, barely meeting Harry’s eyes, and with a light blush blooming on his cheekbones—but he
Of course he's not worried about Scorpius Malfoy.
I’m too embarrassed to discuss this face to face, anyway.
“Put your hands on the door,” Draco said. His voice was low but his tone was purposeful. As though in slow motion, Harry nodded and obeyed. His arms bracketing Draco’s face, he waited, shivering. Draco smirked and slowly, so slowly, fingers trailing down Harry's sides, he slid down Harry’s body and fell to his knees.
“Oh, haha, who cares about that, Malfoy, if we're going to die? Besides, I would rather
Everything Pansy had just said was true. Draco could not believe he had been so obvious, all this time. She took his arm and squeezed.
“I’ve wanted you,” Draco whispered back. “For so long—”
Yours truly,
Was that blowjob a way to repay Harry for the testimony that had saved Malfoy’s life all these years ago?
Harry leaned closer, his chin almost resting on Draco's shoulder. He smelled of soap, firewood and warm wool; achingly ordinary. This boy, the first person who's ever made Draco
“What about Neville?” Harry asked. “You reckon he was on board with Luna’s diabolical plan to have us fuck again?”
“What have you got there?” Harry asked, pointing at the books Draco was holding. His cheeks were still pink and his eyes seemed huge, almost unnaturally green in the firelight. Draco held out the books for him to see. Harry read the titles out loud.
working order.”
Did you?
Draco pulls back sharply. “Is this why you’re here, then? Not hurting me?
Since we’re being nagged left and right about it (you may have chosen to live with Weasley, but nowhere does it say I have signed up on receiving pissy memos from bloody Zacharias Smith,
“Have any of these led to anything?” Harry asks.
“Your father,” Jeff said, “is rotting in Azkaban because quite frankly, he does evil so effortlessly, he puts professional demon like you to shame. And since when do you care about human parents? You’ll be off to your next assignment in less than half a year and will never hear the name ‘Malfoy’ again.”
I’ll always have regrets about the things I did before and during the war. I’ve spent...I’ve spent years in therapy trying to sort out my feelings about my past. In the end, I think my therapist was more willing to forgive me than I ever could. I know I was just a kid back then...but so were
“Could he have Apparated out?”
He would just have to focus on that when chatting with his old classmates, and not on how unfulfilled he felt. How lonely.
Harry’s fists clench, something bitter like bile creeping up his throat. “That bad?”
Everyone laughed and Draco smiled, stupidly pleased by Weasley’s reluctant praise. He was making his way across the pitch towards his teammates when Weasley continued, “Honest, Harry, sometimes I can’t understand why Gin even left you. How can you even still be single? You’re every girl’s dream boyfriend, mate.”
Feels, with a sense of horrible inevitability, his body go hard where Malfoy’s sharp hips cut into his.
“Oooooh yes,” Malfoy moans, head between his arms, “so good, so slow, fuck, Potter, you’re huge, yes, keeping going, keep fucking me, I want you  balls deep in me—”
Malfoy stood very still, shocked into speechlessness by Harry’s blunt candor.
Harry does. His heart is overflowing, full to bursting, and he pours everything he feels into the kiss. Draco whimpers softly, pulls Harry closer, pulls him on top of him.
But…?
“Fuck,” Draco swore out loud. He adjusted his clothing hastily, buttoning up his trousers as the rest of the world came back into focus.
Draco shrugged, unphased. “They don’t have much leverage, now, do they? What’s the worst they can do? Slap me on the wrist? We all know I love it. Demote me? I’m already at the bottom of the demonic ladder.” He lifted a smug eyebrow. “I’m so shite at my job, I’m basically untouchable and you know it.”
“Why not?” Ron’s head pops out of the kitchen door. “Oh, sorry. Because he got hurt at school? He also hurt you.” Ron nods at Harry’s bandaged arm. He's munching on a piece of cheddar, a smear of tomato sauce across his forehead, and the sight of his best friend cooking dinner for all of them, looking all soft and domestic, is too endearing for Harry to stay cross. Ron means well, after all.
Harry gapes at Draco. “Why must you always go for the lowest blow. For fuck’s sake, Draco. We need to think about this together. It’s not you against me. I have as much to lose in it as you do.”
“I’m saying I’ve been with you, watching you, getting to know you… and maybe I’ll never be the most impartial person when it comes to you, but…” Harry takes a breath, feels the heat of Draco’s hands through the fabric of his shirt, against his chest, and lets the confession pour out of him like rain. “I’ve made no secret about the fact that I care about you. A lot. I know I’m paid to be around you, to supposedly spy on you… but this has nothing to do with it. I wake up every morning looking forward to the day I’m going to spend with you. That’s how much I’ve come to care. You’re — you're clever, you’re bloody brilliant, and you’re a good man. You’re a good man, Draco Malfoy, and if you don’t believe me, then I’m stubborn enough to believe it for the both of us.”
For once, Harry didn’t feel like rising to Malfoy’s ribbing. He turned around slowly, taking their surroundings in. He felt the tiny hairs along his arms stand on end. The back of his neck pricked.
Malfoy bristles, but doesn’t make a sound.
“I did try to start a livelier conversation,” Draco said. “Perhaps you could tell us about
fate. Yet I remember how it was when it was your turn to bring us food and water: you sneaked in little pieces of bread, sometimes. They were dry and stale, as though you’d managed to scavenge them from the kitchens where they were supposed to be thrown away. You spoke softly. You didn’t cringe when our hands touched over the plate of food. You even smiled at us. Oh, Draco, I know it was your way of trying to make us feel something—make us feel better, more human, more worthwhile. But...your smile was worse than tears, really. As though you would rather happily trade places with me than go back to them. It made my heart ache for you. I could hear screams upstairs, sometimes, through the ceiling. Thuds, like bodies falling to the ground. I always hoped they weren’t you.”
Draco lifts his hand to cut him off.
And decided to ask once more.
Thank you for reading! I love kudos and comments <3
The door had barely snapped shut behind them that Harry grabbed Draco by the front of his shirt and pushed him roughly against the door.
He lifted a sarcastic eyebrow. “Oh wait; I was there, too. It was bloody

Draco’s heart stuttered.
I wanted to thank you all for your lovely, amazing comments!! They make me smile and laugh and even tear up at times, you guys are the best.
Draco, ridiculously, had thought he’d become this kind of friend to Harry. Apparently, he’d been mistaken.
His chest felt tight, hot, as if a

Maybe she’s right.
“They’re gone,” Malfoy says, voice rough. His stormy eyes never leave Harry’s. Harry’s hard cock glistens with saliva, an inch from his face. “Be as loud as you want.” He leans in and licks the leaking tip of Harry’s cock with a soft tongue.
Harry tenses slightly. “I— I’d rather you wouldn’t,” he says. “I’m not— I’m not ready to go public.”
“Yes, Potter,” Malfoy panted in the crook of Harry’s neck, “I’m divorced and
and the crushing sensation slowly fades. He takes a big gulp of air, then another. It’s like resurfacing after a long dive, his lungs too tight for the intake of breath. He’s cold, shivering, but the feeling of the room closing up on him recedes. He might not break down.
Harry catches Draco’s eye. He feels like he can breathe again, Draco’s presence matching the brightness of the morning sunshine. They smile at each other for a long, cautiously sweet moment.
“—that the audit is over and Caduceus was found clean once again?
Draco felt an odd pang of nostalgia at the memory. At the time, the rook-shaped house had slightly unsettled him, accustomed as he was to the strong, straight, classical lines of the Manor. He had covered his unease and had followed his little cousin up to her room while the adults had tea downstairs. It was the only time he’d been there. There was something about Luna’s mother that Lucius disapproved of, and it kept them from returning. They still saw each other on big family events throughout their childhood, but it was neither substantial nor consistent enough to build a bond based on familial ties alone.
“Hey... how much do you know about Harry’s plans after Hogwarts?” he asked, voice guarded. Hermione and Ron exchanged a look while Ginny leaned her elbows on the table. Nobody answered and Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh,
and to Scorpius' waltz
He sees Hermione open her mouth just before the fire flashes green and he steps into it, disappearing into the whirling void of the Floo network.
“What is this about, Kingsley?” he asks bluntly, wariness inexplicably flaring in the pit of his stomach.
at him, like he’s about to pull the rug from under him — and leans forward. He lowers his head over Draco’s cock, keeps his eyes on Draco for a heart-stopping moment, before licking a long stripe from root to tip. Then he takes him into his mouth, and Draco’s vision goes white around the edges.
standards?
“I do.” Draco lifts a hand to his face, rubs his eye again. It’s too dark for Harry to tell if he’s crying. “This is how I feel.”
Did she give you a little ‘I’ll hunt you down and kick your arse if you hurt my friend’ speech?
“Hello, Mr Potter,” says Dewey, the Minister’s secretary. He looks up from the large diary on his desk, a golden curl falling on his forehead.
“Yeah… I’m sorry it has to be this way. I wish—” Harry sits with his back against the sofa and sighs. He reaches for Draco’s hand, and Draco twines their fingers together. They let them slide slowly, back and forth. The study is warm and dark and intimate, and Draco wishes… wishes this could be the whole truth. Nothing between them but this feeling of kinship and overflowing want. Nothing preventing Draco from letting himself fall in love with Harry, fully and irrevocably.
Harry stares at him in disbelief, unable to reconcile the image of his Draco, his clever, observant, logical Draco, with the walled-off man in front of him.
Harry sighs, dropping himself back into the soft cushions of the sofa.
But what if he let it? Maybe just a little...?
Draco tugs at Harry’s belt and opens his eyes. Harry’s staring at him, heavy-lidded and slack-jawed, and when Draco undoes the buckle and pulls it open, he lets out a strangled, surprised little whine that goes straight to Draco’s cock. He pulls Harry’s jeans down and Harry wiggles to help, pushing down his boxers, letting his half-hard cock hang free as he bends to toe off his trainers and socks, stands again to roughly pull his t-shirt off.
“Let me stay, and I'll work until the Ministry gets off your back.”
“You realise this could only be the door to the storage room,” he said. His voice was lower than usual. He sounded like he was trying to avoid waking a sleeping Hungarian Horntail.
When Harry turns, Ernestina is staring at him with large, unblinking eyes. She shakes her head ever so slightly.
When they reach the door, Draco turns to gaze at his friend. Greg holds himself still, waiting for Draco’s orders. Just like he’s always done since they first met at the age of five, two little pureblood wizards from neighbouring families in Wiltshire.
Harry pushed his leg between Malfoy’s thighs and kissed him. A long, deep, wet kiss, one that he hoped was the perfect preview to what he’d do to Malfoy in a minute… Malfoy who was rutting against Harry’s thigh with helpless little moans as Harry kissed him.
“It’s a great song.”
Harry’s chest ached at the sound. It was novel and thrilling, knowing he was the one who made Malfoy laugh like that.
“You have no idea,” Draco muttered, buttering a piece of toast. It wasn’t even half past eight in the morning, classes were about start soon, and he felt as though he had already lived through a full day.
“Were you?” Harry’s frown almost hid the hurt in his eyes. Almost.
“Thank you, Ernestina.” All the while, Malfoy’s appraising gaze follows his movements. At last, the little boy seems to notice Harry’s presence in the room. Eyes widening, he wraps his arms around his father’s leg and scurries around him as if to hide.
Listen, now. You’ve been summoned here because the bosses have a new mission for you.”

Pansy rounds on her husband, her black patent leather heels clicking on the marble floor. “I am, quite literally, the
A few years ago, Angelica, the Mind-Healer he was seeing at the time, had asked him why he insisted on working for the Ministry for Magic when the place always left him restless and anxious. He had told her the same thing that still holds true today: the Atrium, the lifts, the stairs, the bloody corridors and sodding offices and meeting rooms… they were all part of his history. He could either deny it all or accept it all, but he wasn’t going to pick and choose.

“Call me Harry,” he gasps, Malfoy’s hand still working his leaking cock. “And tell me what you want.”
with my clients and their families. I become close to them, I even usually move in with them. Most of the time it’s a twenty-four hour, seven days a week job, so I want to be around all the time in case I’m needed. Which is why I obviously can’t work with people I don’t respect, people I don’t want to be around, even in a professional manner. And the thing is—” Harry pauses, fakes embarrassment. “I…
Harry walked closer to the kitchen island.
Harry Potter had his head lowered over a scroll of parchment, a lone black curl falling on his forehead, failing to obscure his infamous scar. The light of the nearby fire caught on his spectacles. The lights and shadows turned Harry’s glasses white, making him look like one of Mephistopheles’s ravens. The pink tip of his tongue was caught between his front teeth. For once, he was deeply focused on his homework.
“Thank you, darling,” Pansy murmured, her black eyes briefly meeting Draco's. “You were right. It is cold.”
The red glow illuminates the chiseled plane of a cheekbone, and Harry steps forward.
Your attention. Your touch. Like an infatuated teenager.” His eyes go back to Harry. “It has to stop.”
“Yes, but Harry grew up with Muggles,” Hermione explains patiently.
“All right,” he says, defeated. “All right.”
“Pretty sure I'd read these books faster by myself.”
I should have known. Slytherins will be Slytherins.
Malfoy shrugs wearily. “What about you?”
Walk down the stairs, quiet, careful. Balzac limps next to me. The house is very still. Sleeping. Magic like slumber. The light in the foyer is pale white. (Lovely. Cold. Soft in my eyes.) The green scent of the hydrangeas, freshly cut. No clatters and rattles from the kitchen yet. (Nestine still asleep.)
It doesn’t help that so little has changed since the war; that same bloody fountain, the same whooshing sounds of Ministry employees coming in and out of the Floo, those same claustrophobic lifts that he avoids whenever possible. He prefers the exertion of walking several flights of stairs to the dreadful memories that the creaky lifts never fail to trigger.
“You found me, huh?”
That, and of course the infinite bullying possibilities that Houses offered to the dedicated, result-oriented demon.
“Hey,” Harry manages. “Any problem?”
Possibly
“No!” he said forcefully. “I am. I
On Tuesday morning, three weeks after the charity gala at the Wizarding Chamber of Commerce, Harry receives a note from the director of the Royal Opera House. It’s a thank you card, acknowledging the sizable donation that Harry made to the organization a few days before, and lauding Harry’s unwavering support of the arts. It comes with two tickets to the premiere representation of Swan Lake on the next Saturday. Harry looks at the thick rectangles of paper, the aisle and seat numbers taking up the top left corner of the tickets in bold black font. The seats are in the back corner of a box, one floor above the stalls. The perfect spot to watch the show without being seen. It’s a Muggle show, so he’s unlikely to be cornered by paparazzi once he gets there. Definitely an added bonus.
Like they're in love.
“I’m fine. I’m fine. Just tired. You know what these events are like.” Ron had looked like he didn’t, but hadn’t challenged Harry on that. “A nice walk and some fresh air and I’ll be ready for bed.”
Harry had gone through the list of potions sold by Caduceus, some of them even a potions novice could see were of groundbreaking importance:

“You are only doing your job, Mr Potter, I believe,” she says evenly. Harry blinks and stares. It’s been over ten years since he last saw Narcissa Malfoy, but she barely looks a day older than forty. A regular user of
Draco laughs. “The people who care—?” When Harry takes a step towards him, Draco flinches. “The public’s never seen my Mark. Even during the trial… I refused to show it.”
Potter lifted an eyebrow. “What about a visit to the Quidditch lockers, then? For old times’ sake?”
Oh fuck me, I take ONE (1) bathroom break and these two idiots KISS??
“That’s because the last good men in England have all landed in Draco’s bed,” adds Lavender with a wistful sigh.
Draco remembered.

That’s the power of it though, isn’t it? Making you think you’re a willing participant. Upbringing and family ties can be harder to shrug off than an
He smells like something Harry wants to taste.
“And then,” he pressed his forehead against Harry’s, “I'll get myself nice and slick with your favourite lube,” he wandlessly summoned the lube and caught it in an outstretched hand, before pressing the cool bottle gently against Harry's side.
“No.” Harry comes closer, tries to put his hand on Draco’s arm again. He wants to touch him —
“Shut up,” Harry laughed, a little embarrassed and pleased with Malfoy’s reaction. “And hurry. It’s the end of the world, alright? Just—take your clothes off, and make it good.”
“Fuck—
McGonagall had allowed the constitution of four Quidditch teams with players selected on their abilities and talent. Each team was made up of seven players, one of each year. Eighth Years, who were a post-war anomaly in the otherwise pristine new curriculum, had been deemed adults and thus excluded from the team.
Before Ron can answer, Hermione chimes in.
“Well thank you, Auror Potter. Your single-mindedness and—ah,
“Potter,” he breathed, praying his voice wouldn’t quiver.
“So can I.”
“I’m going to make you come,” Malfoy announced, breathless and delighted, “fuck yes, you’re going to come and squeeze my cock so tight, Potter.”
“Luna!” Neville skidded to a stop when he saw Harry and Draco there as well. “Erm. I didn’t know you weren’t done.”
Malfoy’s head rests on Harry’s shoulder. Harry slowly reaches up and threads his fingers through Malfoy’s fine hair. Malfoy lets out a long exhale against Harry’s collarbone. “Merlin, no wonder you’re so fucked up. And you asked me why I was scared.”
Harry had seen the forums. These lunatics believed the mountain hid a labyrinthine net of corridors and caves, like a giant ant hill for them to take refuge in while the rest of the world burned. It was easy to dismiss them as a bunch of sweet loonies, until they started disappearing. Not just them, but all the other loonies—Muggle and magic folk alike—who had followed them to Ben Macdui. Muggle families reported that their relatives weren’t answering mobile phone calls; wizarding families said their owls returned after failing to reach them.
“Draco, darling, don’t forget that Potter might be there. You wouldn’t pass on a chance to see him in person, would you? Not after all these years tracking his every move and his every date in the tabloids?”
fit. I’d gladly make…
After months near Harry, though… Draco’s starting to wonder how long he can keep up with his side of the game.
“I was thinking that little Italian place in Marylebone, first.”
Harry’s hands slide down Draco’s sides, and he’s pushing him against the door. It rattles in its hinges, and Draco faintly pictures all his coworkers pressing their ears to the other side and stifling giggles. It would be mortifying, if it wasn’t for Harry’s fingers hesitating just below the waistline of his jeans.
Harry smirks.
“What?” Draco drops the form on his desk, but doesn’t sit. “Why am I getting you a receipt form? Other than the fact you’re incompetent and forgot to bring one with you?”
“Forgive and forget much, Potter? I was a dumb teenager. Making fun of people about their tiniest flaws was a normal pastime.”
“Feels so good, Harry. You feel amazing. This—” Draco starts. Has to stop when Harry twists his fist to squeeze them tighter. “This is even better than what I imagined it would be.”

“This is something of my own invention,” he said. “Remember the war—?” He met Luna’s eyes again, and barely stopped himself from cringing. He looked away. “Remember when he...when
“Draco... This isn’t like you. What are you even trying to do…?” Harry’s question ends in the back of his throat, high and strangled. He feels it coming before he knows to name it — the shortness of breath, the blood pumping so loudly through his skull he can’t hear anything else, the cold sweat spreading on his nape and the small of his back—
“Headmistress,” Harry piped up. “I want to reiterate how lucky I am to have been paired with Draco. He’s one of the most clever and thorough people I’ve met, and he also managed to make this career research interesting and fun. I mean, just look at how creative he was! Muggle tests paired with Wizarding spells! It’s all brilliant, really, but...” He scratched the back of his head, hesitated. “What about extenuating circumstances? What about not
“You’re
Just in time, too: black clouds had veiled the sunshine from moments ago and it was dark as night. The wind was blowing fiercely now, sending a dust of snowflakes flying around them.
Ernestina nods slowly. “Good luck, Mistor,” she says.
“You fucked me within an inch of my life. It doesn’t get more personal than this.”
Well. I don’t know, Potter. You tell me. It rather seems like a question for
you've taken in then.
The words were so chaste when Harry’s hand was so obscene, dipping down Draco’s pants and grabbing Draco’s aching cock with already expert fingers. Draco nearly blacked out from the need to be touched like this.
Dear Drake,
“Just looking forward to my gift.”
“Did you even know who you’d be working for?”
“Oh, I think the answer is tailor-made for this moment, Potter,” Malfoy murmured. “Without hesitation, I would do
Harry cups his cheek.
“That’s
Harry drops his head in his hands. “Why?”
Harry’s eyes turned darker. “Yes.”
Dear Draco,
“You’re not the boss of me, Potter,” Malfoy grumbled, until Harry’s hands found his arse and squeezed. “Who am I kidding,” he yelped. “Yes you are.” Laughing, Harry obliged by lifting his hips off the ground when Malfoy pulled his trousers and pants down in one motion.
Luna shrugged with a soft smile. “It doesn’t make it any less true.”
And also because he was interesting, and challenging, and infuriating, and so bloody fit Harry couldn’t wait to get him naked and begging for his cock. He pointedly pushed his hips into Malfoy’s and relished the strangled moan that came out of Malfoy.
Because that tree was the Entrance to Hell.

it becomes a matter of national wizarding security. Which is why we can’t just have the Aurors on this case. We need someone with more... power.”
Harry turns a frantic, pleading gaze at Malfoy. He’s already rehearsing a promise for silence in his head, anything to keep Malfoy quiet about the whole incident, and Malfoy must see his intention written all over his face.
“What?” Harry had asked.
“Sooner, then?” Malfoy asked against Harry’s lips when they’d pulled back a fraction. “How soon?”
So he changes his mind, and makes a decision.
“Er. So. Can I have the form, please?”
“Both of you can stay a while longer,” Luna said, putting the kettle on. “I enjoy having you over.”
“Sod off, Malfoy.”
She doesn’t respond for a while, immersed in her task of scrambling eggs in a pan. Before long, she sets the pan of golden scrambled eggs aside, waves her hand over it as a stasis charm settles, and she turns back to Harry, wiping her hands on her apron.

A burst of laughter and tipsy conversation filters through the layers of cloaks. Harry’s heart jumps in warning. Other people. Guests of the charity ball coming to collect their cloaks.
want, this time?”
Daydreaming has turned into a dangerous act. The memory of the stolen dalliance hovers in the periphery of Harry’s mind, like the elephant in the room that Harry refuses to acknowledge.
she said, sipping her tea. She didn’t look at him, but he heard the smile in her voice. “Welcome to the club, Draco.”
“We’ll be nice, Harry.” Hermione pats his arm. “All I want to talk about with Draco is our project.”
Malfoy hastily clears his throat. “Is lunch ready, Ernestina?”
“Harry,” Draco said. His given name still felt foreign on his tongue. Foreign, but sweet, like his mother’s chocolate truffles. “You came.”
on the other hand...
Pansy groans dejectedly.
“Okay.” Hermione Levitates the pushchair as she walks back upstairs. On the black metal frame of it, a brand name stands out in white cursive. Harry’s mind flashes back to a parchment rolling from Draco’s glass-top desk, Harry nearly stepping on it. Words written in a foreign language, topped with calligraphed words. Draco’s gaze as he gripped Harry’s shirt and pushed him up against the shelves of a supplies cupboard, teeth bared on a laugh.
They started running, Malfoy on Harry’s heels, Harry still holding his hand.
Draco hesitated and the Quick-Quotes Quill stilled over the parchment. “But...Luna, the series is called

“You’re not.” Draco's voice was humiliatingly raspy. He wished he could look cooler, more in control, but there had always been something about Harry Potter that made him lose his composure. Him being
Harry’s trousers are thankfully clean, but his shirt has been torn half open somewhere in the midst of their...
Have you ever sucked cock? I bet you would be amazing at it. Merlin, with that mouth and those lips— I’m going to teach you so good, Harry, you’re going to be the best at it, the best cocksucker wizarding Britain’s ever seen—” Draco’s babbling now, but he can’t stop, because Harry’s moaning at each of Draco’s thrusts and filthy promises, and he’s matching the rhythm of Harry’s hips, frantic and breathless. “And I’ll get on my knees for you too, trust me, I’m dying to, and you’ll fuck me so good I’ll forget my own name, say it, say what you’ll do to me—”
“Hi, Draco,” Harry says, meeting Malfoy’s eyes. After a week of calling him by his given name, it still has a strange flavour on his tongue. It’s still a small, furtive intimacy that somehow feels important, significant, and forbidden at the same time. It’s unsettling, when Harry’s used to calling almost everyone he knows by their given names without a second thought.
Ah, yes.
Five disgruntled heads snap up, weary gazes fixed on Draco.
“Please, Mother, your presence never is. Scorpius is going to be delighted, and so am I. In fact, Ernestina will go wake him up in a second, as soon as she’s finished putting breakfast together. Let me check on her.”
Harry
But now.
“In the getting fucked in the arse area.” Malfoy says, his voice a strained whine. If Harry wasn’t desperately hard, he’d feel pretty proud for eliciting that kind of sound from him. “Alright, hold on— let me— do the spells.”
Still sitting, Harry feels exposed, vulnerable—but he doesn’t move.
Draco clears his throat and continues as lightly as he can. “Scorpius is going to miss you.”
Hermione’s words still echo in his mind, but he’s not sure he cares about careful. He never did.
Yours,
As expected, the press is a nightmare. Within hours of being spotted in Draco’s company, a day after starting work for him, their pictures were splashed across the front page of every wizarding newspaper and magazine in existence. Photographs of Harry in his dark Muggle suit, standing protectively next to Draco as they both walk the short distance between the car and the Caduceus lobby, were suddenly everywhere. In the days following this “groundbreaking revelation”, as Draco liked to call it with a sarcastic eye roll, red Howlers were flying into Draco’s office almost every ten minutes. Harry Vanished them with a slash of his wand, a handy little spell that the Unspeakables had taught him years before, after the news of his break-up with Ginny had hit the front pages of the wizarding papers.
Draco watched as Harry pulled books, quills and parchment from his school bag. In the warm candlelight, he looked as any of the other students around them. Yet his magic constantly buzzed against Draco's skin, a reminder that this ordinary-looking kid was one of the most powerful wizards Draco had known.
“Daddy,” the boy says. It’s not a question.
antics, you underrate me too,” Draco replied. “You and Longbottom? Really? How long has
Around the long family table, plates and platters of food passed from hand to hand, followed by gravy boats that floated precariously a few inches above the guests. Draco couldn’t help but notice the vacant seat between George Weasley and Penelope Clearwater, Percy Weasley’s fiancée. Out of the corner of his eye, he could feel Mrs Weasley’s absent gaze constantly drawn to the empty space where her son should have been. He could see Mr Weasley covering her hand with his and squeezing.
“And… Ron wanted me to tell you it’ll be fine if you find Draco is innocent. He’ll work with you to see it through, if that’s your conclusion. However, he asked me to remind you that you still don’t have any information on the origin of Draco’s wealth, and that might be the only thing that could satisfy the Minister.”
“You've met Ernestina,” Malfoy says, almost to himself.
“You didn’t even clean up after the last time,” Malfoy murmured behind him, his voice trembling with lust. “Mmh,” he added with an appreciative hum, his fingers already pumping inside Harry, “you feel so wet, so filthy. So full of my spunk. I could fuck you all day and you wouldn’t get enough, would you?”
“Let’s say there was enough room for another couple of small, subdued friends tonight.”
Nothing has seemed to wipe the skeptical look on Ron’s face, so Harry had skittered away and out. He’d stopped on the steps of the Chamber of Commerce for a minute, face turned towards the starless London sky, and had taken a deep breath.
It seems that everything reminds him of Draco these days.
Draco’s knees wobbled with pleasure and anticipation. He wanted to initiate Harry in his own way; he wanted to watch him lose his mind, come undone in Draco’s hands, in Draco’s mouth—
He keeps the suit jacket he’s wearing underneath, patting it down. His fingers brush the small, round shape in the crook of his pocket. Since Malfoy gave him his Snitch back, Harry’s taken to carrying it around everywhere again. But now the feel of it is tinted with sadness. The memory of something he thought he could have, and flitted out of his hands like a Snitch taking flight.
Harry half-collapses on Malfoy’s back, pressing him back on his elbows. For a split second, he cringes, hoping he’s not hurt Malfoy, that Malfoy won’t feel used… but then Malfoy moans once more, his cock giving one last sated throb in Harry’s hand.
“Oh, come on, mate.” Ron seems eager for the change of topic from Acromantulas to almost anything else. “It can’t be that bad for you, can it? I know we haven’t talked about your… er, personal life in a while.”
Ernestina nods. “Welcome to the team, Mistor Potter.”
“Good morning, Ernestina. Good morning, Harry.”
Draco doesn’t come closer to his mother, and she doesn’t seem to mind. Maybe the Malfoys are always like that, Harry thinks — or maybe Draco knows he’s already given too much away without his mother noticing the smell of Harry all over him, too.
Yours,
Under the pad of his fingers, he can feel the bumps and ridges of Malfoy’s lifeline, the places where the skin is rougher or softer. Malfoy inches closer, his breath warm as he leans into Harry’s space.
“And I am?”
the wizarding world had to rely on independent apothecaries and potion Masters. There were barely any standards in brewing potions, and quality and strength would vary widely from one potioneer to the next. It’s as if the entire Potions industry was freelance. And that wasn’t the only limitation!” Hermione points a finger up, and everybody around the table listens. “If everyone works in their own corners, there’s no confronting ideas. There’s no discussing about what works, what could work better, what others are doing that could inspire us. There’s no innovation!” She pushes her chair back and gets up, setting her glass on the table and gesturing to the other guests, tipsy and passionate. “Innovation! It’s the crux of the matter! The Muggle world has progressed in tremendous leaps over the last century, and where has the wizarding world stood in the meantime? Teaching children potions and spells that have not budged an inch since the Middle Ages, and never once looking beyond its meticulously groomed fences to take inspiration from the way other humans lived!”
Harry’s in bed with a book in his lap when the knock comes at the door. He puts the book down to mark his place. He’s been reading the same three sentences over and over, unable to focus. He runs a hasty hand through his hair, checks that he’s presentable, and says, “Come in!”
They sat in silence for a moment, Harry slowly closing his eyes to enjoy the music, Draco watching him, trying to make sense of what he was listening to.
“Studying. Or charging blindly into the future,” Draco sighed. “I guess I’ll take the former, and you’ll take the latter, as usual.”
“Are you boyfriends?” she asked, keeping her voice blessedly down. “You say you don’t know what kissing all night makes you, but it seems rather clear to me, sweetheart.”
You’re a fucking Ministry mole, Potter. Not my confidente. Not my therapist.”
Draco had rolled his eyes. “That’s bisexual stereotyping.”
“Duly noted,” Potter answers absently, as Draco follows the retreating group and closes the door behind them. He seals it with a discreet
one o’clock. A few more hours to go, then he would be free to go back to the office and wrap up the last article of the series. He let them while Dennis set up the equipment for the photoshoot. Dragging his feet, he walked to the kitchen.
“Well...this is for our readers. I do know you a little, obviously, but
The study still looks eviscerated by it.
“I would. But it’s getting late, and it would be most unseemly if we showed up late at my aunt’s.”
“Just... try to find the middle road, Draco, and we’ll be fine,” Hermione smiled.
“And to you too, Mother. To what do I owe the… ah, unexpected yet
“But if you want to, I’ll tell you a trick. Do you want to hear it?”
“You did? How—?”
he wants to snap. He keeps his mouth shut. He’s learned that antagonising the press only makes the next-morning tabloid titles worse.
“Congratulations, you amazing, law-abiding bastard.”
“Is Harry okay?” Hermione had still asked, always the perspicacious one.
“C’mon, Potter,” he whined when Harry let go of his lips, “get to the point.”
“Of course.” Luna stepped back to let him in. “It’s so much warmer inside.”
His one true love.
“All I hear is that you’ve been thinking about me.”
Yes, definitely.
Imperceptible details, flashes of conversations, stunted gestures file past his brain. Draco’s strained, sometimes overtly suspicious demeanour at the beginning of Harry’s employment.
Ron lifted his eyebrows.
“Shut up. You —
“He can still do damage,” Harry points out.
Malfoy does.
A sign that they’re going to be okay, despite Harry’s qualms and fears.
She hung Draco’s things on a coat peg and sauntered off to the living room without another word of invitation. Bewildered and hesitant, Draco followed her. Luna had always been unpredictable and hard to read. Her Hogwarts nickname flashed in Draco’s mind.
“...and you… are going to
Laughing, his colleagues position themselves around Draco.
“She was just telling me how you met,” Harry says. “I was wondering… why did you decide to come back to London?”
Draco and Harry left the room and made their way to the Seventh Floor.
He’s only hit with how self-righteous he sounds when Malfoy snorts in response. “Why, I didn’t know you cared.”
“Temporarily. Give me… three days. Enough to bring Scorpius home, get things sorted. Enough for me to think.” He looks back at Harry, and it’s almost pleading. “Can you do that?”
When Harry had been anything but evasive.
“See?” Malfoy breathes in Harry’s ear. “Trouble averted, Potter.”
“Aren’t you going to ask about me?”
“I thought they’d never leave,” Harry tells him. They both know who he’s referring to. “I don’t mind guarding your pretty arse, Malfoy, but keeping those snivelling quillpushers away from you for weeks was exhausting.”
Lucifer, Draco was so gone for him.
Ron continues with a placating tone. “Remember Gregory Goyle, from school? He’s just resigned and moved away from London. Up until a couple of days ago, he was Malfoy’s bodyguard. A listing for a replacement was posted yesterday in all the main wizarding news sources.”
“God, Draco.” Harry exhales, his breath stuck in his throat. “As she should be. It was… quite frightening, actually. I’m sorry, maybe you don’t want to hear it—” But Draco shakes his head, wide-eyed, and waves at him to continue. “It was like... like too much magic contained in too small a place… ready to explode. I’ve seen accidental magic before. Hell, I’ve done accidental underage magic before… but that was something else.”
“Damnit, Potter. You’re supposed to antagonise me, remember?”
He dropped himself on the other end of the sofa, arms still crossed, eyes on the crackling fire. The fireplace was decked with glittering tinsel and branches of holly. The merry, Christmassy look of it only added to the hurt Draco was feeling.
cousin, Luna.”
“Harry, you can’t make a deal with a suspect,” Hermione says.
Oddly, it grounded Harry. He felt calmer for Malfoy’s agitation. The storm might be raging outside, but they were safe, here, together. For now.
“Something about it bothers you, though. You find it… provocative. That I am who I am. That I dress the way I dress, that I move the way I move.”
Harry watches as Malfoy’s eyes scan his CV and his eyebrow shoots up in a sarcastic curve. He points at a line.
“Harry and Draco, sitting in a tree!” Matilda sings.
“I have, unfortunately,” Draco conceded. He listened to the song until the final notes of the guitar faded out.
Harry suddenly remembers the tall, wide frame of the man standing beside Malfoy on the picture, and understanding hits him like a Bludger in the face.
Draco seems unphased by Harry's jab. “Yes, it is. I live for me. For Scorpius. For my mother, for Ernestina. I live to make Caduceus better.”
-Draco Malfoy
“I think he wants to be alone,” Harry tells everyone when he steps out on the grass. Blaise and Pansy look like they sobered up in the last five minutes. Hermione and Ron look like they’d rather be anywhere but here.
The conversation stays quiet and pleasant as everybody tucks in, helping themselves out of Ernestina’s rich selection. Harry is halfway through his first serving of mash and peas when he catches Draco’s conversation with Hermione. Draco’s leaning forward and listening intently as she catches him up on her department’s most recent findings.
“So your career path was a strong, personal choice?”
Harry looks at him, appalled.
“Only my close employees know about it. My family. My friends.”
and his whole face feels hot. Draco, though… Draco is a debauched sight to behold. Cheeks pink. Lips swollen from Harry’s bites and kisses. A small tear at the collar of his t-shirt. And his hair — his usually perfectly, artfully coiffed hair — is a mess now, fringe falling in his eyes, sweaty strands sticking to his temples, the rest of it in complete disarray. Harry can’t help the tightening of his chest when he realises it. That he did this to Draco. That Draco said he could be his.
They’d been walking in the snow for what felt like hours, Harry’s nose slowly turning into an icicle and his hands and feet growing numb with cold. There was still no sign of anything remotely suspicious, despite Malfoy’s methodical, fastidious combing of what seemed like every single square inch of this bloody mountain. Once an arse-licker, always an arse-licker, Harry thought pettily. Malfoy couldn’t help kissing up to to the higher-ups even when there was no one but him and Harry around. Arse-kissing was probably embedded in his genes.
Harry’s heart speeds up in his chest. He loves how fast Malfoy rises to his bait, how well he knows which of Malfoy’s buttons to push to get the reaction he needs, even after all these years.
“There might be unattended champagne and canapés left. You?”
“Those people have done worse things than blackmail. Why should I feel bad?”
PS: you know what the others are going to do tonight, if we’re not at the pub? They’ll probably start a betting pool on whether or not we’re somewhere shagging.
“Yeah,” Harry smiles shyly at him. Draco lifts his hand, runs his thumb across his cheekbone.
“Only if you stop shutting me out!”
Luna settled in her green armchair with a contented sigh, as though this was a friendly conversation and not the most nerve-racking interview Draco had conducted in recent memory.
“Nothing. Just that there might be more… contemporary artists to choose from.”
“What is it?” Ron asks, concerned.
Quidditch, then.
Ron is leaning over a vase of grey hydrangeas, sniffing with a suspicious air. Ernestina watches him with a nonplussed frown, and Harry swiftly catches his friend by the elbow and leads him to the study, nodding at Hermione to follow them.
There’s only the sound of the rain falling on the leaves of the cherry trees outside. Inside, the grandfather clock ticks the seconds away with grim finality. All around them, the disaster of the day remains — the upturned unicorn and dragon chair, the parchments everywhere, the ivory keys of the ruined grand piano gleaming on the floor like teeth.
Those sharp cheekbones. That tiny, pert arse Harry could imagine pressed against the palms of his hands…

“We… we just talk a lot, you know? And spend so much time together… It makes it harder not to see all the good things about someone. Until he found out the truth about me, of course.”
“Fuck, yes,” Draco says through gritted teeth, opening his eyes to find Harry staring hungrily at his face, pupils blown so wide the green has almost disappeared. “I spent
“You promised you’d protect us.”
“You liked it?” Harry asks. It’s a stupid question. He’d been there. He’d… felt how much Malfoy enjoyed it. He can’t help feeling insecure. It was his first time, after all.
Let’s win the
Harry
Hermione, engrossed in her reading, simply nodded. After a minute, she pointed at a line on Draco’s parchment.
Harry frowns. “But see, there’s a slight flaw in your plans, Kingsley,” he tells him. “Malfoy notoriously disliked me back when we were at Hogwarts. And I can’t say I liked him much either.” Harry runs a hand through his messy hair. Kingsley’s eyes lift to the lightning scar on his forehead and Harry drops his hand, annoyed. His hair flops back into his eyes. “I don’t see Hermione here, nor anyone else from the Department of Mysteries, so I assume I’ll have to go as
“That will be the best news to come out in a long time,” Draco said.
Harry looks at him. Takes in the passionate way Draco talks about his life’s work. He looks at his beautiful face, his eyes the colour of a cloudy sky, his mouth held in a serious line. Immerses himself in Draco’s single-minded focus, soothing like walking into a warming spell. He lifts his other hand and cups Draco’s cheek, thumb sliding across his sharp cheekbone.
He’s feeling hopeless, because he doesn’t believe he’ll ever find anything like that, ever again. Hermione, perceptive as always, doesn’t push him to say more than he wants to, but after every one of her visits, she leaves his flat saying, “Time heals all wounds, Harry.”
He bounces against Harry faster, calling Harry
Harry didn’t stop him when he turned on his heels and stalked away.
Harry bursts out laughing. “Yeah, you would have been the worst.”
“For fuck’s sake, woman,” he mutters with a mock-disapproving shake of his head. He glances at Potter, takes a breath, and straightens his shoulders. “Yes, Potter. Over here. I can sign this in.”
“What do you need from me now?” Harry all but whispers.
“You—” Potter starts, then stops. His jaw is working. “Why are you doing—
“What do you think we should call him?” He heard Ginny ask Luna a few feet ahead of them.
“I know.”
The fact that she achieved her goal by telling him it was the incantation for a new spell she was developing makes me wish she had Sorted Slytherin. Sadly, she’s a Gryffindor through and through. Let’s just say her recklessness has its advantages on occasion.
Malfoy tugs at his wrist, still enclosed in Harry’s hand. “I had to. If I’d stayed, I would have… compromised.”
Draco had given him a wide-eyed, innocent look. “If I can’t be a bit Slytherin about it, what’s the point?”
Draco pulled the soft, rounded flesh apart with his thumbs, whispering a gentle cleaning spell. Harry’s entrance was furled and dark pink, twitching at the sudden exposure. Draco brought his lips to it and kissed—a wet, open-mouthed, sucking kiss that made Harry cry out above him.
“I think you should call him Jeff,” Draco suggested behind them.
The tree was a familiar presence in Draco’s life—this one, the previous ones, all of them. It didn’t mean he
I don’t know what’s going on. I keep going through every detail of that night, trying to figure out where it went wrong. What I did wrong. Did I do anything wrong?
“I know,” Harry said with a rueful look at Draco. “Trust me, it would be so much easier to keep calling you ‘Malfoy’.”
“Hello, Mephisto.” He schooled his features into a practiced bored look. This never failed to annoy his demonic tutor. He lifted the piece of red parchment streaked with a scribble in blood-red ink:
“Malfoy—” Harry warns, squirming under him. Malfoy’s erection is a hard length pressed against his own, the thin joggers leaving nothing to the imagination. That’s still too many layers of clothes between them, and Harry wants them gone. “Less talking, more undressing. Unless you want me to come from just this.”
“Can’t. Breathe,” Harry laughed and lightly pushed Malfoy, who lifted his head from where it rested on Harry’s shoulder and pulled out of him, coming to lie next to Harry with his head propped up on his hand.
Harry’d received the memo from Dewey almost as soon as he’d walked out of the Ministry ten days before. Now, after what feels like an instant, his meeting with Kingsley is in three days.
“Always thought it was pretty obvious.”
“I prefer to think of you as a jar of honey.”
“Yeah?” Malfoy leans in to nip at his jaw. Harry nearly whimpers at the sensation. “I almost wish I would have peeped through the keyhole, watched you stroke that huge cock of yours until you came.” Malfoy’s lips move to Harry’s ear, licking along the shell. Harry moans pathetically. “You love it, don’t you? Thinking of me while you wank? Tell me, Potter, do you need both hands to get yourself off? With a cock your size, I would imagine so. Merlin, I’m rather good at blowjobs, and it still took all my skill to take you down my throat.”
“The friends of my friends are
“Be nice, Potter,” Penelope says when she passes by him. “I have no qualms kicking your arse if you so much as touch one strand of Draco’s hair — Boy Who Lived or not.”
Time to lift his lazy bottom off that bar stool and move.

“‘Afternoon, Jemima. Is he in?” Harry asks, nodding towards the door to Draco’s office.
Harry thinks. “You sound like you might need a hand.”
says the title at the top. Below it:
to the chest. It was also a loud, clear, long-time-coming wake-up call. He doesn’t remember much of that morning. The Auror department had an arrangement with the Department of Lost and Found: all magical objects and artefacts gathered in the course of an investigation that ended up not being classified as evidence would be delivered to the DLF, so that they could one day, be handed over to their rightful owners. Wilson, Harry’s intern, in charge of bringing the discarded boxes of evidence to the DLF, had called in sick that day. Harry had offered to bring the box down to the DLF himself. Not as an excuse to see Malfoy again. No. Harry hadn’t thought about
“They’ve identified you as a suspect for illegal activities conducted through your company.”
She nods, her smile widening. “Probably not.”
His beautiful green eyes crinkled at the corners. The lines weren’t there two years ago. They fit the gorgeous prat, though. It made him look different. Normal. Natural. As though he and Draco were still good friends. Friends who’d slept together two years prior, certainly, but friends nonetheless.
“Aye, Mistor Potter, sir!” Her hands fly to her dirty apron, dropping her whisk. It hits the floor with a clatter, splattering egg batter everywhere. “Ernestina is not expecting Mistor! Breakfast is not ready yet, sir!”
The second level has darker wood on the floors, with matching furniture. Unlike the study upstairs, this one has a wall covered from floor to ceiling in shelves of vinyl records. So the ones he thought he saw in Malfoy’s office weren’t a trick of the eyes, then. Harry walks to the shelves, pulls out one of the records. It’s a copy of Janis Joplin’s
Jeff shook his head dolefully. “Don’t thank me. I don’t know why you’re asking me this, kid,” he looked almost sad, “but whatever’s got into you... I’ve seen it before, in better demons than you, and it can’t be good.”
“Convoluted, indeed.” Draco sighs and leans into him. “You wouldn’t even be here if Smith wasn’t so obsessed with me. If they weren’t
Malfoy’s smirk broadens. “The very best in the world.”
Harry said. “They're brilliant, aren't they?”
“It’s beautiful. It’s snowy and impeccable. We’re in the middle of Scotland and it’s nearly Christmas. Of course it’s freezing. We’ll cast Warming charms.
“Yes.” Immediate. No hesitation. Draco took Harry’s chin in his hand.
Draco’s eyes never left Hermione as she spoke. When she stopped, he noticed he was holding his breath. The napkin in his lap was half torn to shreds. Their little group lapsed into a loaded, mournful silence.
With one last smile, Harry joined the snowman-building group. Luna Lovegood was next to Draco in an instant.
She nudges Ron, who frowns.
“Then maybe it’s about time you realise that’s what we are, Draco.”
Harry eyed him dubiously. They walked in silence, further down the main street. Harry stopped in front of Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop.
of Draco’s life. So rude of you to imply I’m only
“Nah,” Weasley was waving him off good-naturedly, “Malfoy is one of the best there are. Remember how many games Slytherin used to win when he played for them?” He turned to look at Draco and shrugged apologetically. “As much as it pains me, you’re not all bad, Malfoy.”
of all people—
An odd look crosses Malfoy’s face at Harry’s words. He nods, rather formally. “Yes, of course. Follow me.”
“I see why you’re worried. I should have mentioned my blackmail plan has been entirely hypothetical so far. But Cavendish and all the others are linked, and they talk. If one of them said they’d been attacked or robbed by a wizard, it wouldn’t take long for anyone with more money than they can spend and less attachment to ethical practices to trace my magic back to me.”
Harry gave him a small half-smile. “’That what you had in mind?”
“Yes, well.” Draco pursed his lips, fighting a smile. “Let's meet this
Potter gave a humourless little snort that went straight to Draco’s cock. “All right. You think my life is so much better than yours? You think you’d rather be a professional Quidditch player in the limelight than a high-ranking Gringotts director?”
Harry comes with his hand clenched around the coat rail and the other fisted in Malfoy’s hair, hips stuttering in helpless, blissful thrusts. Part of him vaguely knows he’s supposed to let go, but he keeps his hand in Malfoy’s hair and fucks until he’s fully spent, until come drips down Malfoy’s chin. When he finally relaxes his grip, Malfoy pulls back. His face is pink, his lips red and raw, a vein popping on his forehead. Harry feels like apologising. Jesus. He got… He got carried away, he should have stopped it, they shouldn’t have… He opens his mouth, but his excuses stay stuck in his throat. Malfoy wipes his chin with the back of his hand, lifts glazed eyes that still feel predatory, and— swallows. A pointed, deliberate gulp, with Malfoy’s smug half-smile as punctuation. In this moment, he looks so much like Malfoy — the version Harry’s always kept in the back of his mind, all these years — a hungry, debauched version of Malfoy, that Harry’s cock gives a treacherous lurch at the sight. Malfoy shifts on his knees, spreading his legs a bit wider. The movement draws Harry’s attention to the bulge tenting Malfoy’s elegant trousers. He lets go of Malfoy’s hair. He moves his hand around, a careful, tentative gesture. He wants to cup Malfoy’s cheek, to run his thumb across those swollen lips—
“I suppose I am,” he said, clearing his throat. “It’s not—inconvenient, I hope. May I come in?”
“What an image.”
“Oh, who cares?” he moans. “There are giant bloody spiders hanging over our heads! I don’t want to hear about spiders, let alone giant ones, I just want to eat my weight in canapés and get out of here as soon as humanly possible.”
Harry turns towards the door. It only takes a few steps for him to reach it. He hopes, blankly, that Draco is going to try and stop him.
spreading the next day.
“They’ve gone to visit Grandma Molly and Grandpa Arthur, actually,” Hermione tells him. “And I wanted to see you.”
Draco shivered.
It was the hottest thing Harry had ever seen.
“You left,” he says, voice low. “After you’d made it sound like you wouldn’t.”
I was just — I haven’t seen one in a long time. It’s always a bit of a shocker, you know? The Mark.” He smiles, a small, wry thing. “You’re right. It’s your office. And even if it wasn’t… it’s not my place to judge you. I’m sorry I… reacted.”
“No, Mistor Potter,” Ernestina shakes her head with a half smile. “We met in Paris. Ernestina was working for another wizarding family but they were moving to Japan. And Ernestina was recommended to Mistress Narcissa who offered to hire her.”
“Frowned upon, yes,” Ella'd conceded with a sneer. “A backwards way of thinking of other magical creatures, if you want my opinion. But not illegal.”
He felt the back of Harry’s gloved hand touch his.
“You’ve never minced your words, Potter,” Malfoy smiled eventually, slow and intent. “To think I used to hate that about you.”
“I… I’m not here for you to experiment,” Malfoy says.
“Er. Dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years, Luna.”
“Cleaning spell?” Harry asked. His voice—husky, raw—didn’t sound his own. He pushed his glasses back on his nose.
if you want to—” There’s the distant sound of the door rattling with each of their thrusts, Harry fucking him into the hard wood. Draco’s never lost control like this, not since he was fourteen and had soiled his pyjamas with come, one early morning in his four-poster bed, after barely bringing a hand to himself. He bucks into Harry’s grip, but Harry’s hand is still pinning his wrists to the door and no amount of squirming will make him loosen his grasp.
“Please be careful.”

Luna settled into the chair, tucking a leg under her.
Draco placed the headphone in his ear. It was a curious sensation: the sounds of the room blocked only from one side, the crackling of the fire and the creaking of the castle around them still permeating his other ear.
“Your idea?”
Draco’s stomach flips at Harry’s words. It’s so intense sometimes… Draco struggles not to shove Harry away just so he can have a minute to catch his breath. Face heating, he scrambles for a change of topic. Back to the auditors.
Hermione seemed to take pity on him. “It does sound like something you’d be good at.”
with eyeliner, didn’t he?
Because the man — Harry’s gaze travels up the tall, lean frame and up to the back of a shockingly white-blond head — is Draco Malfoy.
He puts a foot on the floor and stands, staggering as he regains his balance. “Fuck me— I fucking
it. It’s a precious, tenuous feeling, in a life that has always left him so little choice in everything.
“Draco. I’ve known you since we were seven. If you think I wouldn’t have noticed, you really underrate me.”
“It’s nothing… It’s just a magical sprain,” Harry says weakly. “With the bandage and potions they gave me, it’s only going to be a matter of days.”
“Why not?”
Malfoy has Harry’s flies open faster than Harry can react. Malfoy. On his knees. Malfoy on his knees in front of Harry, his intent unmistakable, his fingertips skimming the waistband of Harry’s pants. Harry grabs at coats, grabs at Malfoy’s shoulder, grabs at anything that might prevent him from toppling over as his knees go weak. Malfoy on his knees, about to— to blow him.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”
for a Slytherin.
Until Malfoy barged in Harry’s life again, and upset everything Harry thought he knew about himself.
he thought.
That his plans have all gone to hell, and that this is the end.
“Later, Potter,” Draco says, voice softer around his clipped accent, and Harry smiles. He touches his fingers to Draco’s hand once more, his palm this time, and lets them linger for a moment. Then he pulls back and straightens up.
Your personality type is
Draco almost slid off his stool. The day already felt like a cart ride down into the Gringotts vaults, and he hadn’t even started asking her questions yet.
Harry laughed softly. “I always tell Hermione about everything.”
He’d never thought he and Harry stood a chance, but Draco had wanted him anyway.
Malfoy held himself very still. He was paler than usual, and it wasn’t the blue light’s fault.
“I…” Draco blinked, then gave himself a shake. “Yes, that was all. I thought it was a rather full day—”
Draco nearly tripped. It felt like swallowing a bucket of ice while simultaneously bursting into flames.
The house is as grim as ever, probably even more so now that he has the contrast with Draco’s house so clearly imprinted in his mind. He’d found his emergency stash of Dreamless Sleep when he’d stumbled back home the night before, fuming and disappointed and guilty. As he’d practically poured a vial down his throat and fallen into bed, the heavy potion-induced slumber slowly drowning his friends’ concerned reservations, he realised he hadn’t needed Dreamless in weeks… not since he’d last been here, not since he’d moved to Draco’s home.
The room is a library. It’s magically lit with wall torches, lined with bookshelves from floor to ceiling, with a ladder in the corner to reach the higher shelves — the room must be thirteen feet tall — and a few club armchairs huddled around low, round tables.
Not just happy for everyone else.
“If you’re mine, oh Merlin, if you’re mine I’ll make you feel so good, Harry. I’ll show you — I’ll show you
“Harry, I need you to get us three invitations to the Society for the Protection of Acromantula and Magical Tarantulas!” she says, her intense expression made nearly maniacal by the green flames.
“I did not lust after him!” Draco protested, although it was exactly what he’d done.
Malfoy wasn’t in his office this morning when Harry walked downstairs. His hair is lightly mussed, his eyes soft, and he’s wearing well-worn, nicely fitting jeans and a dark blue jumper that looks as soft as a kitten’s paw. He looks like he woke up just a few minutes ago. He looks… normal. Human.
Harry hesitates, then walks in.
“But you still need me now.”
pleasure of your visit?”
What had Malfoy been doing in the cloakroom that night? Yes, clearly, he’d picked pockets. But what for? Was it how rich kids got their kicks nowadays? (Not that Malfoy could be called a kid. He was the same age as Harry, after all. And he’d grown quite convincingly into his adult looks. He’d been all lean limbs and broad shoulders and strong jaw that night, miles away from the pointy roundness of his teenage years or the emaciated gauntness of his features at eighteen.)
“I don’t,” Harry confesses, and he’s surprised to realise he doesn’t have to lie. “Or at least, not the way other people do.”
“No. I need more time,” he tells Ron. “I’m not — compromised, or anything. I can tell the difference between my work and my— my

Draco wouldn’t let his mind go there.
applying
Dear Draco Drake,
“Fuck,” Harry exhaled harshly when what Draco was about to do registered in his brain.
Harry moves again, interrupting Malfoy’s string of praise and curses and replacing it with a long, guttural moan.
As if there was anything small and subdued about their present company.
“Impatient.”
Smith’s words still ring in his ears, still make his hands itch for his wand. A bloody
“Gross!”
“Harry,” Hermione warns.
“A game of Seekers, all right,” Malfoy growled in Harry’s ear as he thrust up against him, cocks leaking against one another.
Draco put his hands on Harry’s waist as Harry wrapped his arms around his shoulders, bringing them closer.
Past images filled his mind, unbidden, stealing his breath.
he heard Malfoy above him. He sounded breathless. “I’m going to make you feel so good.” The hand on Harry’s side withdrew, and Harry felt Malfoy pat the floor around them.
Harry is so taken by the spectacle on stage and the whirlpool of his own thoughts that he doesn’t notice the man who slides in the seat next to him. Until the stranger leans in and whispers in Harry’s ear: “I never would have pegged you as a ballet enthusiast.”
He stood up and moved towards Harry, a predatory gleam in his eyes. Harry took a step back, stumbling over an ottoman, landing on his backside with a thud.
“No take backs, Malfoy.”
Harry had bitten a trembling lip and Draco had wrapped his arms around him, humming softly into his hair, murmuring nonsensical reassurances that it would all be alright, one day. It would never be completely alright again, but Draco didn’t expect it to be. He was learning fast that this imperfect balance of joy and pain and sadness and love and fear and bittersweet nostalgia was an intrinsic part of being human. He was fine with it. He had chosen it. He had held Harry close until his shaky sobs had eased into calmer breaths.
“I needed you as much, if not more, back then.”
but I might have to preface a lot of the next chapters the same way as well, so... Yeah. This is my favorite part of the story.
“Charms have never been my forte,” Matilda deflates.
“For Circe’s sake, Potter. Have breakfast with us. Who do you think Ernestina is cooking this massive meal for, just a seven-year-old child and me?” He stands, smiling in mock disbelief. “Just wait here. I’ll wake Scorpius up and we can all eat.”
“Confident?”
, remember?”
It was easier this time: all Draco had to do was follow his instincts. He listened to the music of Harry’s breath, of his moans getting more needy and whiny as Draco increased his speed, of his own heart beating like the wings of a phoenix in his throat. He sucked Harry harder, licking across his slit on his way up, pushing his cock further and further down his mouth on his way down. He knew he must be drooling but he couldn’t bring himself to care; not when Harry was shaking against him, trying desperately to stay still, his hands clawing at the door, his balls tightening against his body.
he steps out of line,” Harry corrects.
Harry half-nods, half-shrugs. He wouldn’t call himself a fan. When it comes to culture, he often feels like he’s just begun to glimpse the tip of a very big, very daunting iceberg. So far, his self-educated approach to art has consisted in sorting it into two groups: the art that’s easy to like, and the art that requires more work from him.
“I promise you.”
“I had no idea,” he murmurs, “that this piece was Chopin. It was — beautiful. Truly.”
“Old habits die hard.” It was the closest to an apology Draco wanted to give him. It was mean-spirited, he knew. It wasn’t Harry’s fault he felt that way about him; in fact, Harry had never done anything worthy of a crush.
Well. Harry’s still standing motionless near him, and there’s no avoiding the topic anymore.
*~*~*
Draco stopped and looked over his shoulder. No one was following him. Night was setting over the Hogwarts castle. From where he was standing, on the threshold of the Forbidden Forest, it shone like a lodestar, nestled among the snow-capped fir trees.
“Yes,” Draco says quietly. He looks up at Harry from under his lashes, his face still in Harry’s palm. “We said that when you come back…” He swallows, looks for his next words. “I’m done waiting. I’m ready. ” He wraps his fingers around Harry’s wrist, nuzzles at his palm. “I want you,” he confesses, eyes shut.
“Er, thanks, Luna,” Harry muttered. He slid Draco a look. When Draco met his gaze, he swiftly looked away.
“Why don’t you… assess the damage then, and I’ll lay the table?”
“Give me a couple of minutes to recover,” Harry says with a crooked smile. “And then we can try… We can do whatever you want.”
and jumps on Blaise first, wagging his tail and slobbering over his jacket. Harry and Pansy snap out of their strained moment and exchange a quick glance.
Also, I seem to remember you spent an awful lot of time in very tight leggings on stage. I have a suspicion the costume designers who came up with Frederic’s outfit knew exactly what they were doing, because it’s quite unfair. You… you look like you were born to wear those things. The way they highlight your body, the way you move in them, so seamlessly, like water on a window pane.
“The ‘Bend and Snap’ is infallible, Penelope.” He grins, winking at her. “I promise you, your team’s morale will be off the charts once everyone gets laid next weekend.”
“Are you being serious right now?”
That’s when Harry sees it.
He hits the wall with his fist.
Malfoy’s eyes are grey and wide, a line forming between his brows.
“Narcissa Malfoy is here?” Ron groans.
“You won’t decide anything with that attitude,” Draco shook his head, amused.
It’s Draco Malfoy.
“Do you think we were this tiny in First Year?” Draco asked him while collecting his books.
“What?” Harry adjusted his glasses.
The play was brilliant, by the way.
Inside, there is a clear, bright foyer, all white marble and tasteful dark wood furniture. In the back, a beautiful stairwell twists around a wrought-iron banister. Tall vases full of white and grey hydrangeas frame the doors leading to the rest of the house on the right and left sides.
“I do now,” Harry said, hands balled into fists. A furious frown twisted the lightning scar on his forehead.
It’s important that Daddy sleeps in and that Harry does as well. (So I send my magic to tell the motion-sensing charms to stay quiet.) (They listen.)
The Mediwitch is putting the last touches to the bandage around his left wrist when there’s a knock on Harry’s door. The Mediwitch looks at him with raised eyebrows, a question. Hermione and Ron have already been around, as have Molly and Arthur. Ginny sent an owl. Kingsley sent a memo that Ron handed Harry, a piece of parchment in a nondescript brown envelope. He read it when his friends were gone.
Harry’s trust seems to give Malfoy pause. “So you like men, huh?”
“You’d forgotten about it until my mother caught you walking around looking thoroughly debauched this morning.”
I know. I’d be getting involved with my purported ‘employer,’ with the main suspect of an ongoing investigation. And,” Harry lifts a finger when Hermione opens her mouth, wanting to finish first, “even if Draco was neither of these, I would still be getting involved with… with
Harry’s here, still kneeling, patient and waiting, and he’s just… Harry. His body is warm between Draco’s legs, his skin inviting in the dim light of the study. His face is bathed in the glow of the lamp on Draco’s desk and he looks younger, artless, and somehow that’s what crumbles Draco’s last walls. They’re the same, he and Harry. Despite everything — despite life taking them in opposite directions then bringing them back together in the most improbable way — they match, inevitable. Draco holds Harry’s gaze, focusses on the feel of Harry’s hands sliding up and down his sides, soothing him, grounding him. Harry touches him, an awed expression on his face, as if he can’t quite believe it’s happening. A mirror to Draco’s feelings. He touches him like every one of his scars is beautiful, sensitive, erotic. He should know — he’s the one who put them on Draco’s body. Marked him as his. With a soft whine, Draco reaches for Harry’s face, pulls him close, kisses him. Harry melts into the kiss, melts against him with a soft, encouraging moan. And just like that, with the slide of Harry’s hands on the fabric of his shirt, on the flies of his trousers, with their hands desperately grabbing at one another, with their tongues sliding hot and hungry together…
it’s true.” Harry waggled his eyebrows. Draco laughed, thoroughly charmed. It felt brilliant to finally be able to do so in Harry’s presence. “You can’t ask me for an interview after sex. I’m weak and pliant, and I could agree to anything. It’s unfair.”
Harry takes it, leans back against the back of the chair, and opens it.
Plus, all our bosses were there and got to enjoy it. The funniest part was everybody giving each other the side eye and wondering… ‘surely it cannot be
“I know. I can’t risk it,” Harry says. “It has to be me. Anyone else they put in my place would be Kingsley’s lap dog. Or worse,
“Yes,” Draco continued, fake thoughtful air firmly in place. “But you’d have to give me something in return.”
I’m kidding. Let’s ditch those dolts and find something a little more civilised.
“Good. I’m just checking. I know what you're like with medicines, and remembering things in general.”
“What?” he said, unnerved by the scrutiny.
Draco was waiting in the queue for lunch when Harry just. Walked up to him and. Grabbed him by the front of his lab robes and. KISSED HIM.
After a few weeks of that, Hermione firecalls him one night.
