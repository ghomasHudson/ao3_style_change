The smile tightened, just a smidge, as those long, pale (warm!) fingers wrapped around Harry’s. “Potter. How very lovely. I have important things to be doing, here in London, and instead they send me On Progression round the countryside, which, frankly, is little more than a glorified holiday,
She winced a bit, looking apologetic. “Well, apparently there was someone else who needed the goodwill tour more...” He started to ask a few questions, but a posh drawl from behind him, one he knew all too well, answered them all.
they insist I need their best Auror-” the sneer emerged for just a moment “-as a bodyguard, and it turns out he’s essentially a glorified babysitter. Come on then, let’s get this over with.” He rolled his eyes as he turned toward the Floos.
Harry had meant the question to be genuine (nowadays he hated the thought of Draco being afraid of anything), but Draco took it as more of a challenge. “If you’re not afraid, neither am I. Come on, then, you Gryffindor, keep up.” He strode boldly up to the gate and slipped through without letting himself think in the slightest about what he was doing.
Harry flicked a look and half a smile back at him. “Surprisingly good company, really.” He shifted, and at first Draco thought he was just uncomfortable, until Harry was properly facing him, leaning in, breath warm on Draco’s cheek. “And, you know, I have an idea or two of how we can pass the time until the rescue party gets here.” They both turned, just enough that their lips met, and the sparks that had been growing between them the past few days (years, really, but who’s counting?) burst into a bonfire, and they were lost to anything except the kissing. Time even became a hazy concept, the kisses slowing as exhaustion overtook them, until they fell into sleep still tangled together.
The next handful of stops were much the same, cheerful hosts, hearty, filling food, and more livestock than either of them were prepared for. Still, they were spending enough time together (and sharing enough experiences) that Draco thought Potter might actually be warming to him, and that one day they might finally become friends. By the time they left Glastonbury Abbey, they were even on a first-name basis.
Harry just laughed and flopped (face up, thank you very much) onto the other bed. “Your secret is safe with me. So I’m guessing you’ll want a real restaurant for dinner tonight? We could take a stroll downtown, do some sight-seeing or shopping before or after.”
“Oh.” Draco hadn’t expected Harry to cave so easily, had been gearing up for a great row, and now he wasn’t quite sure what to do with himself. He let his head drop back against the tree trunk and stared up at the remarkable starscape. “They might not find us, you know. We might be unfindable. Still, if I have to potentially starve to death millions of miles from home, the view is certainly worth it.” He flicked a look over at Harry. “And the company’s not bad, either.”
“And so gracious of you to give up your spot to me, Granger. One might almost think you like me.” The look on Malfoy’s face was more a genuine smile than the sneer Harry was expecting, and he was dressed in an unexpectedly Muggle (though still unfairly attractive) style of a black suit, with black shirt and black-on-black tie. It made his skin and hair glow like a star come to Earth, and Harry really needed to stop writing florid poetry in his head. He was an adult, dammit! A professional!
Draco staggered into the hotel room and collapsed face-first onto one of the ridiculously large beds. “Civilization at last. Proper, comfortable beds. Meals that aren’t somebody’s Gran’s recipe. No roosters whatsoever. Bliss.” He gave a heartfelt groan, and Harry chuckled as he went around the room, doing his security checks and setting the wards. As he came around to where he could see half of Draco’s face, mashed into the duvet, the one visible eye opened and gave him a half-hearted glare. “And if you ever tell
As Draco’s panic receded, his first instinct was to lash out in anger, and of course the favorite target of his anger was right there next to him. “This is all your fault, Potter! You were the nutter who wanted to follow crazy music and go through a mysterious gate, and now I’m pretty sure we’re on an alien planet, with no way home, and we’re going to die here, and it’s all your-”
Harry nodded firmly. "Yes. When Draco came to me, his whole back was open. The wounds even infested and got really bad because I couldn't tend to them. It was Mrs. Weasly who healed him up."
The next morning, Harry's nervousnes was back. Even with everything he said to Draco yesterday, it wouldn't be easy, facing the Dursley's after that kind of leave. Back then with the car, they had at least had the whole year to calm down. Now it had barely been two weeks. His nerve seemed to show, because Draco took his hand beneath the table and stroked it with his thumb soothingly.
"Draco, I think you have already guessed that the use of the 'Flesheater' is absolutely forbidden today. Whoever did this to you will have to answer to an inquiry." He suddenly looked old and worn out.
Ron unpacked his chessboard and they began playing. Harry wasn't really astounded to see that Draco was quiet good. He had always known that the blonde was one to strategize and plan, unlike himself who rather plunged right into action. He still lost to Ron, but something told Harry that he probably wouldn't if he had been on his best, since it was a very narrow defeat. Ron was delighted. He urged Draco to play with him again and again, until Mrs. Weasly came in and told him off for overtaxing him. But Harry had the feeling that Draco had really enjoyed playing with Ron. In the end, it had been 6 games, two of them won by Draco, four by Ron. His lover was really good at this game. That evening, Mrs. Weasly build up the Dinner table in the living room to give Draco the opportunity to eat with them without straining himself to much. At first the Conversation was subdued, as no one really knew what to say. It were Fred and George that broke the Ice, by asking their father about work and Mr. Weasly began to tell them about an old Muggle-Woman who had bought a beautiful necklace which turned out to be enchanted so that it made the wearer have a constant hiccup, a newly wed Pair who had acquired a Service that constantly refilled itself until even the thickest Muggle had to notice that something was off and a Ring, shrinking on the Finger of the Person who took it on, that they had been able to take of at barely the last second before the owner lost his finger. He said it had been mayhem with all the charms to make the Muggle's think that none of this had ever happened. The only one who sat still and without a smile that whole time was Ginny. When Mrs. Weasly just said that he should have brought home that self-refilling service, she stood up very abruptly, saying she wasn't hungry any more and leaving. What followed was a very awkward silence, in which Draco looked very downcast. Harry suddenly felt a rush of anger towards Ginny. He gave Draco's hand a squeeze and then stood up too, excusing himself. He hated to leave Draco alone, but this couldn't go on.
"Oh, Arthur told me the news... I am so glad everything went all right! I've made you both tea... You must be exhausted! Come in, come in... brush of the soot, there's a good lad... "
"That's all I can get you right now, sorry... eat up and don't worry, you'll be safe in here. Just don't leave the room, 'kay?" he said hastily, kissing the other softly on the cheek. The Slytherin looked puzzled, but Harry couldn't stay, he dashed out of the room again, right on time to hear Uncle Vernon's angry shouting. He made sure the big man saw him running out of the front door and where chasing him. They mustn't go near his room. He ran over the lawn and and heard Uncle Vernon puff behind him like and old steam engine. In front of the Hedge he stopped and turned around, letting Uncle Vernon catch hold of his arm.
"Draco... tell me this is the first time this happened..." Fear clenched his chest. The Slytherin met his eyes only for a split-second, but it was enough. In this Ice-blue Orbs, Harry could see the pain of a lifetime. It all made sense. The mask, he wore. Why he mentioned his father in almost every second sentence. He had to convince the world, convince himself that everything was fine. That they were a loving Family. In Draco's world, Image was everything. His whole life had been one great masquerade.
Then she stared at Draco for a Moment with the same x-ray glance she had given his father. Harry thought just for a moment, he saw her expression soften. The she nodded. "Fine, You may both go."
"Whatever happens in there, You will always be welcome to stay at the burrow, as long as you like. Please don't forget, Draco: You are not alone any more. You have Harry. And if you ask us to, you will have the whole Weasly-Family right behind you." He smiled very softly. Draco's eyes went even wider and he looked for a second as if he wanted to hug Mr. Weasly. But then he just nodded but Harry could see that his face had become just a tiny bit less green.
Draco mumbled something that Harry couldn't understand due to sobbing and his face being screwed up in his lap.
"At one point they will find out, at the latest when we get back to Hogwarts. It's okay to let them read it. It will spare me to have to explain it to them. Just tell them if they ask that nothing in this article, for once, is exaggerated. " He looked sad, Mrs. Weasly on the edge of tears again. Harry cleared his throat.
"Do you think you can just walk away from this? Hiding one of... of your kind in our House, by the looks of it, I'd say a dangerous person anyway! Threatening us with those... Tricks of yours into believing that we couldn't lay a hand on you? Well, not this time, you rotten brat, not this time!" He breathed harder now, as if he had been running a marathon. Harry looked at him. One part of him told him that Uncle Vernon was still very tall next to him and that he weight at list thrice his amount and could probably crush him by weight alone. But he had a wand and Mr. Weasly was with him and Ron and Draco. He wasn't alone any more and he wouldn't budge this time!
Come the next morning, Harry started to wonder in which way the Weasly's would appear this time. He wouldn't mind them bursting into the fireplace again and shocking the Dursley's but when he came to think about it, it would probably be best for Draco if they came by Car.
Harry kissed back, deep and longing, he wanted to hold Draco, wanted to protect him, his heart from harm of any kind. He wanted him to be able to smile more often, to be happy.
"Hey, love.", he whispered softly, "How do you feel?" He had to fight back the urge to cry in glad relief but felt that it wasn't the right moment. He didn't need Draco worrying about him. The addressed coughed and his face contorted in Pain.
"You have to do that yourself." ,he said calmly. Then he turned around and went down, leaving a very thoughtful Ginny behind.
She sat down next to Harry and smiled friendly. "Here, dear, you might want to drink that." she said quietly and held up the tug. "There are Painkillers in there, but I couldn't make them too strong or you might pass out again." ,she apologized. Then she helped Draco into a half sitting Position which made tears of Pain appear in his eye corners. Harry's heart seemed to rip apart. With shaking Hands, Draco held the cup and drank in small sips. After about the fifth one, his face began to soften and the fog in his eyes seemed to clear a little. He sighed in relief. "Thank you Mrs. Weasly," he said and Harry could hear the absolute honesty in his Voice. It seemed that the Painkillers were taking effect.
"Are you... are you sure? That won't be a nice visit, you know... I mean, you've seen what they are like back then... I can be happy if they haven't burned everything by now."
"Draco..." Harry was uncertain how to start. He didn't want Draco to be afraid any more. He didn't want to have to remind him about what happened. But he had to.
Draco gulped and Harry could see him resisting tears now. Mrs. Weasly looked at hi, for a moment longer with warm eyes, then turned and said: I'd better go and wake the others, You have to go in about two hours." and strode out of the room.
"You overslept, you silly Boy!" she began nagging, starting a long tirade of what was wrong with him, why they had to put up with him and what a rotten and ungrateful spoiled brat he was. Harry let it all wash over him in silence, his sole thought up in his bedroom, hoping Draco was still sleeping. He finished making breakfast just as Vernon and Dudley came down the stairs. Glad to have an Audience, Petunia turned to Vernon to tell him that Harry had overslept, what led to the black-haired boy hearing the same speech he just had from his Aunt, now out of the mouth of his Uncle. He shuffled some Toast on his Plate, carefully hiding a bit of bacon underneath it.
"Never again will you lay hands on Draco, do you hear me?" His chest was heaving with the effort to not cruciate him here and there. He must not attack first. If someone should come in now, they must understand the situation. That Malfoy, not he had started all this.
They sighed theatrically. "Now she will pick all of those sad little boys who always try to get her attention."
"I would never Draco. I love you. You have to believe me. I love you. You are everything that matters to me. And I swear on my life, that he will never touch you again. Never. I love you Draco, I love you..." Again and again, Harry whispered these three words into Draco's ear, praying that they would cut through the thick layer of hopelessness that he had pulled around himself. He carefully made Draco lay down and went on stroking his hair and whispering words of love and hope, of happier days, gone and yet to come, of everlasting faith. He kept on doing so, even when Draco had finally fallen asleep, for he feared that if he stopped, what little was left of his lover would lip away and vanish into nothingness forever.
"So... you and Harry, huh?" He asked flatly. Draco nodded. Then there was silence again. Then Ron said: "Do you play Chess?"
So deep in his head, he didn't hear Mrs. Weasly until he registered a pair of feet right in front of him. He looked up, startled, causing Draco to stir and hastily started stroking his hair again, listening to his now again steady breathing. Mrs. Weasly was standing there, a plate in her hand who's contents Harry couldn't see from his angle but which smelled like cookies. She smiled a bit sadly, then sat down opposite him, putting the plate down. Chocolate Chips.
Draco watched her roam about the kitchen collecting, bowls and Eggs and Flour, his expression not quite readable to Harry.
"Ahhm... could you say that... that last bit again...? He stammered. Hermione raised her brows. "I knew you didn't hear a word we talked." She said sighing. "I haven't said anything in the last 5 minutes at all."
"Maybe, Harry, it would be a bit much for your Aunt and Uncle if four of us came all at once...,", he started but a snort from both Ron and Draco interrupted him. The two looked at each other, then at Mr. Weasly.
"Behind these door are two Dementors, waiting for you. You have been charged with the regular abuse of Draco Malfoy in body and mind, of rape and it seems that we can add attacking Ministry officials to the list. You are hereby sentenced to 10 Years in Askaban. Get him Out of my sight!"
The night before the hearing, Draco didn't sleep at all. He only had to close his eyes for a second, but they flew open again at once, as if he could see images inside his had, whenever he didn't see anything else. Harry tried again with the Patronus, but it was no use. Not even the cumulation of good feelings and Hope could help Draco get past his terror and anxiety. Harry, of course, hadn't slept much either, though he had dosed of every now and then, only to be wakened shortly after by a start or a shudder when Draco's eyes had accidentally fallen again.
"Can one of you get the cage? I have a hard time, carrying both it and the trunk" he said to the others. Ron snatched the empty Cage, accidentally scattering a bit of sawdust and owl droppings around the room.
It was over. No way could he control himself now. Removing the fingers in one swift motion he replaced them with something much bigger. Draco groaned as he positioned himself and then, with one single motion pushed in. Draco's cry of surprise pleasure was like an aphrodisiac as Harry fastened the rhythm, Draco clinging to him as if for dear life. Harry kissed him until they were both breathless and then with one last Push they came.
A sound rattled from the adjacent stall, like a hand scrambling at the wall.  Harry’s breath ceased completely and caught in his chest.
The lights and screams were muted and Harry could hear his own breathing.  He leaned back into the rickety toilet.  It was so beaten that he expected a moaning cry to rattle its pipes.
“Ron, get out.” Ron fumed up to argue and Malfoy slipped back into his signature shit eating grin.  Harry nearly lunged at him right then and there.
“It’s pathetic, isn’t it?  This is all that’s left of me.” If the silencing charm on the bathroom wasn’t so strong, Harry wouldn’t have heard his rasping voice.  Malfoy avoided his eyes and smiled in resignation at the cracked tiles.
Malfoy still moved smoothly despite the heaviness of his breathing.  His arms wrapped around Harry’s shoulders, bringing them as close as possible.
At this angle, Harry could feel the jagged edges of healed wounds.  A myriad of rough patches and burnt flesh that made Malfoy’s breath catch when he rubbed against them.
He could barely think with how strangely dizzy he was, but he could pick up the distinct tones of dryness in the man’s hoarse gasp.  It was similar to the gruffness in Head Auror Shacklebolt’s voice, who Harry swore burned through a pack a day.
Except the majority of his days were spent signing off documents and writing up drinking and flying charges.  Harry couldn’t blame Shacklebolt, he was certain that the entire ministry would be in uproar if he allowed their dear saviour to get hurt.
“Wank yourself.” Malfoy groaned as if it was the greatest idea in the world and his free hand scrambled to yank off his buttons.
He didn’t know when his plans for the future went from a wife and family to paperwork and stumbling home at 3 am, too drunk to even apparate.
“Anyway, you’ll never be able to guess who the new trainee picked up.” Harry was seriously contemplating throwing his empty mug at Ron’s head when the door to their office swung open.
“Then don’t.” The stall door creaked open and Malfoy spared him one small smile before heading out into the flashing lights.
Harry did the same, giddy from a good orgasm and decent company.  He grimaced at the cold, sticky liquid soaking into his shirt.
The other man was just as tense.  The bathroom stayed pin drop silent until the man couldn’t hold in his cough anymore and dissolved into a fit of quiet wheezes.
“I’ll do it!  Everyone out.  Now!” The trainee who’d been shaking in his boots finally broke, startling like a pigeon as he fled from the room.
“Mmm... Potter.” Harry took in the ruffled shirt and ripped jeans, though he wasn’t sure whether those could even be called ripped jeans with how little jean they had.
Harry put one foot forward, crowding into Malfoy’s air.  It was impossible for him to describe what that tone did to him.  The depth and huskiness combined with that slight touch of warmth, how Malfoy’s voice crackled and strained on certain words, as if he was breathless with the effort of speaking.
He knew he shouldn’t indulge those thoughts, especially during work hours.  But he couldn’t help but wonder what everyone would think if they saw what was building inside of him.
“I never want to let you go.” He regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth, but Malfoy didn’t freeze up.  He stared into Harry’s eyes and smirked like he’d just caught the snitch.
But there was no war to fight anymore and it was easier to duel a Death Eater than his own conscience.  It left his mind with ample time to go over everything in excruciating detail.
There was again a ripple in the court, louder this time, but Madame Bones raised a hand a tit fell silent again.
Harry looked at Draco, who seemed uncomfortable. He looked around as if he was seeing the place for the first time too. Then he looked at Harry and there was a kind of pleading, mixed with defiance in his voice.
"Harry, are you quiet all right?" asked Mr. Weasly very confused and looking a bit concerned, as if he thought, Harry had a shock or something.
"I can't." he whispered. "How would they look at me, if they knew? I am filthy, disgusting. My own father Harry... Why had it to be him? Anyone else would be a different story. But him... how can I tell anyone what he did? How can anyone look at me with respect ever again if they know what I am?" He had started crying again. Tears streamed down his pale cheek that still looked very hollow, even though Mrs. Weasly had tried her best to nurture him properly. But Harry had seen Draco vomiting a part of his food often after the meals. He couldn't stomach much, was still shaken. Harry didn't think this had anything to do with his wounds. No, this was a psychological Problem, not a physical.
This still left the question of where Draco were to live. His Mother had two Sisters, Bellatrix Lestrange, currently in Azkaban for being a supporter of Voldemort, and a Woman named Andromeda Tonks, who had fallen out with the Family because she had married a Muggle and to whom Draco had never spoken. Mrs. Tonks had been informed about the Situation and arrived four days after the trial. She seemed like a nice enough woman, kind hearted and good natured. She had a daughter of her own, Nymphadora, but she was already Grown up and didn't live with them any more. She and Draco talked long and hard about their possibility's and in the end it was decided that for the rest of this summer he would stay with the Weasly's and next he would start living with her and her Husband, Ted Tonks. She said he could think about whether or not he wanted to visit over the Schoolyear-holidays already, but that she wouldn't push him.
"Well, in that case, I should tell you from Mafalda Hopkirk, that you are to receive a warning not to do magic any more, while you are under age, Mr. Malfoy. As do you Mr. Potter, this is your second, don't repeat it."
It became his Mantra over the day, as Draco's condition got worse and worse. He lay himself next to the Slytherin, who was shaking violently under a fever shiver, even though he had to all the blankets and Sweaters over him that he could find. It was horrible.
Draco stared at the floor for a moment. Then, with great effort, he drew his head up until he looked Amelia Bones right I the face. When he spoke, Harry knew, he was telling her and no one else.
"Ah, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter. Please come in and sit down." She indicated towards to wooden chairs on her left side. As they walked through the room, Harry saw him.
"You are not allowed, boy. They expel you from your stupid school and you will never be able to become one of... their lot. Yes, we should have prevented you from going Years ago. St. Brutus', that's right. Time to make it more than just the story for the neighbours, don't you think?"
Harry grabbed a hand of powder to and repeated the action. Once he'd finished saying his destination, he started whirling around, shooting past other fireplaces until he landed with a small 'thud' on a floor in front of a gigantic fireplace, twice as big as the one he just left. Draco was already standing there. Harry patted his clothes as to get the dust of a bit, then he looked up.
"Why not? I'm sorry, but I fear I have nothing more suitable for you..." the black-haired started an excuse but Draco shook his Head.
The rest of the drive home was quiet, they played chess and exploding snap, ate from the Sweet trunk and laughed at things that had happened this Year. But Harry joined in only half-heartedly. His mind wandered, through the train, into the Slytherin compartments, to Draco. What was he doing right now? Did he miss Harry as much as Harry missed him?
He sighed, as he scrubbed the Windows in the hot summer air, sweating, even without his shirt on. A glance back told him that he had to mow the lawn next. His back already hurt and he felt a nasty sunburn come along, since he didn't have any sunlotion to protect himself.
"You are a good boy Draco... a good boy... I tried to tell him you are a good boy, you didn't need to be punished... you're a good boy who does his mommy proud..." He said it again and again, and tears welled out of her eyes and down her face, Draco looked shocked but did not say anything. His mother continued stroking his hair.
"You do not hurt Harry. You do not touch him. You do NOT curse him. You will NOT DO ANYTHING ANYMORE!" Harry could hear the rage, edging on madness.
The Silence was deafening. Deadly. Harry could see the shock in Mr. Weasly's eyes turn into pure hatred towards that man who had so utterly destroyed everything he should have held dear. When he spoke again, the Griffyndor could hear the effort he had to make to keep his voice calm, so as not to upset Draco even more.
"Arthur Weasly, Harry James Potter and Draco Malfoy, We are hear on behalf of the hearing against Lucius Malfoy."
"Mrs. Weasly, how come you are already awake?" ,he said with surprise. A glance on his watch told him it was only half past a quarter to seven.
"No, you won't have to worry about that. I have send your Uncle a little letter you know, in which I have asked him to keep it safe... I might have used a little threat here or there about what would happen if we got there and your possessions were harmed.", he winked and Harry couldn't help but grin as he imagined Uncle Vernon getting a letter like that. Than he looked back at Draco, who looked very determined.
Her hair was as white blond as Draco's and her skin was pale. Yet there was a striking difference to the woman Harry remembered to have seen on the Quidditch world Cup. That woman had looked strong and proud. This women looked a bit dazed and confused. She wasn't small but she looked... vanishing. She was so pale and slim that Harry had the feeling a gust of wind could blow her away.
"It's okay. You don't have to defend her for me. I don't hate her... I am a bit angry at her for leaving you alone like that, but at the same time... It is hard to stay angry at someone so..." He tried to find the right word to describe it without hurting Draco, but it was he who finished instead:"...broken?"
Her smile became more sincerely. She stretched out a hand and stroke Draco's hair too. The she stood up, and patted her skirt to clean it.
He almost bitterly laughed at that thought. No one here cared if he was a wizard or not. But being a gay person was still not really aloud in society. Being open about it like they were could have got them into serious trouble if they had lived in this area apparently. How pathetic.
Harry crept through the Darkened corridors. He wore his invisibility Cloak and tried not to make any noise, because he knew Snape was on Patrol tonight. They could have taken another night. But tonight was special, needed to be celebrated.
His outer scars where healing faster now. Mrs. Weasly had told Harry that if you were past a certain point of healing, it went relatively fast. That Draco's wounds had been so very bad had been more due to the fact that they had been left untreated for too long and got infected, than to the actual wounds themselves.
They landed in a deserted side street, only inhabited by a cat, who was severely shocked by their appearance and shot out of sight. Harry could hear cars driving in the distance. They must be in London already. Mr. Weasly nodded satisfied and set of toward the noise, Harry and Draco behind him, Draco holding tight to the dark haired boys hand. They didn't talk much, but all the noise around him as they went through Muggle streets seemed to distract Draco at least enough to prevent him from diving into the near-comatose state again. Once or twice Harry saw people, mostly gangs of young teenagers point at them. He wondered a bit why that was, because Mr. Weasly had managed to dress himself reasonably well, so that he shouldn't draw too much attention to him and Harry and Draco where not really any different. It took him a while to understand, that it was not the way they looked. It was the fact that he and Draco where holding hands.
he looked at Draco, who did not react immediately. When he stood up, he did so with Harry's hand still clutched in his fist. He looked quiet surprised, as if he hadn't realized it had been there the whole time. Harry glanced towards Madame Bones.
"Come on you two!" said Mr. Weasly and they marched to the desk on the far side of the Atrium, where they gave a bored looking wizard their wands, who weighed them, stated their attributes and returned them.
"... but it is time to end this little Drama now, don't you think? I mean, I got quiet out of Hand. And you really shouldn't toy with people like this Draco. That poor boy next to you really thinks you are in love with him. That is not very nice." Concluded Mr. Malfoy, his smile malicious. Draco trembled still, but said nothing.
"I don't know...", he muttered quietly. Harry watched him carefully. Thinking about what happened had caused a Panic-attack that had shaken the blonde very thoroughly. But now he only looked tired again.
He started to caress Draco's chest, sliding his hands softly, carefully over his delicate skin. Then he dipped down and began to nibble on the others nipples, which rewarded him with a deep and hungry moan. He wanted to kiss every inch of his lover, and he did, laying kisses over his collarbone, his chest, his navel (which made Draco giggle) and then at last came to the region he had been waiting for. Here to he lay soft kisses Draco writhing and moaning under him. It felt so good, so good to give his lover pleasure.
"High Court. I think it is clear that my son is under a very bad influence at the time. I admit that I may have been a bit harsh when it came to good school results, but don't we all just want the best for our children? If Draco felt abused through this then I am very sorry but I only did what any good Father would have done to ensure the future of his child." He spoke smoothly and so fluently as if he had learned it by heart. Harry felt sick. Draco next to him trembled ever harder.
"Horrible", he croaked, "But better than before." He tried to laugh at the weak joke, but this send another shot of Pain through his body. Harry soothed him down softly.
When he had finished, it was temporarily silent in the room. Then Perkins, who had been listening the whole time of course said:" Blimey... I think I need something stronger then cocoa."
They wet back down and Harry almost let himself believe that it would be that easy, when... "Not so fast, boy!"
"You interfering little brat." He said it slowly, very calm, but Harry could hear the coldness, the hatred behind this.
"Meet me tonight in the third floor." He said, fixating Draco, who's eyes widened. He stood still for a second, then he wrestled his arm free and ran away.
When they reached his room, he made Draco sit down on his bed and hastily pulled some of his clothes out of his cabbet. In the light of his room, Draco looked even worse, his usually pale expression now looking an unhealthy gray. There were dark shadows underneath his eyes and tears had left their mark on his cheeks. He looked as if he had been through hell.
"Look, I don't know what happened, but you are safe here, ok? I won't let anyone hurt you, not my Aunt and Uncle, not the Person who did this to you... no one will get near you, I promise." He now said next to Draco who seemed to ease up a bit.
He arrived at the (third) Corridor and stood in Front of a Brick Wall. He went past it once... twice...thrice. While doing this, he wished hard, as hard as he could. He wanted to get in. He wanted to be with the Person inside that room.
At eight O'clock they left the house together with Mr. Weasly. Mrs. Weasly hugged them both this time and Harry could see her eyes becoming watery again. Ron patted Draco on the back, which seemed to slightly confuse the blonde, mostly Harry guessed because no one had ever patted him on the back before. The rest of the Weasly's merely winked and wished Draco good luck. He looked very pale now and even a bit green.
"But I need to talk to you. Because clearly, you don't have any Idea, how you make Draco feel.", Harry said, harder then he had intended to. But he couldn't let her hurt Draco an more.
Draco seemed grateful for that. Andromeda really was a nice person but to him she was a complete stranger and he had a hard time trusting. Too much had happened.
But it would never be a Problem. They wanted each other so badly. Harry opened the door and walked into the room.
"Here, you can put these on. There not very new or good, but..." He stopped himself from saying 'but at least their whole', feeling that it would not come across very good. But Draco didn't react anyway. He stared through Harry as if he had no Idea what was going on. It scared the Griffyndor.
It was his really family, wasn't it? So they probably liked him. Wasn't that how family's worked? Even the Dursleys, the worst People Harry could think about, loved their son. So what could it be?
Oh dearies, I am so sorry. It took me forever to find out how I really wanted to end this Story, but I think I finally got it. Including this one, there will be three more chapter from here on, the last of wich will be ver similar to the first one!(You have been warned ;)
"Draco, you really should put on some dry clothes. You'll get a cold. I would love to offer you the shower, but that will have to wait until morning, ok?" Still no response. Draco just stared at him blankly, as new tears started rolling down his cheeks. Harry didn't know what to do. He had to get Draco out of these clothes or he would he could even get a lung infection. He touched Draco's Arm. This produced a reaction but not the one Harry had imagined. The pale boy jolted and scrambled on to the corner of the bed where he tried to make himself as small as possible.
The followed Mrs. Weasly into the kitchen, where she immediately started to make toast and scrambled eggs and bacon. It was only now that Harry realized.
"How are we getting to the Ministry Mr. Weasly?" Harry asked, to distract Draco, yet keeping a close eye on him, because he wasn't so sure he wouldn't faint.
." She said, putting an effort on the word alone. Draco shook his head and tugged Harry's hand. Madame Bones looked a bit taken aback.
Draco had awoken. He sat upright on Harry's bed, finally out of the ripped and soggy clothes from before. When Harry came in Draco just put on the shirt that Harry had given him. He had his back turned to the other and the Griffyndor could see an assembly of gashes on his back, all looking fresh and angry burning. He gulped and decided to bring it up later, not immediately.
Panting, Harry rolled himself of Draco and cuddled into his side, the other ones chest heaving in n effort to catch his breath.
"It was not... all... that person did to... to me. There was more." Harry could feel Draco's heart pounding on his wrist, loud and hard. Mr. Weasly looked concerned and worried. "What else, Draco? What else did that person do to you?" His voice was soft and full of compassion.
"I'm sorry.", he said quietly. Draco looked at him, and opened his mouth, clearly to say that it wasn't is fault, but Harry shook his head.
They arrived at the Burrow much faster then was natural, so Harry presumed that Mr. Weasly had used a little bit of magic to shorten the Journey. When they got out of the Car, Mrs. Weasly came hurrying towards them.
But we can't just turn up on the doorstep of your parents and ask them, can we? We need help in this, love. I want to help you, so badly, but I fear if I curse your father and just get it, there will be more Problems instead of less." he said the last sentence with a twisted smile, but to be honest, he was dead serious. If Lucius Malfoy ever got in front of him again, Harry wasn't sure he could guarantee for anything.
Still from that moment on, something was different. Harry suddenly noticed all the small little details about Draco that he never saw before. How his long, white fingers contrasted with the dark wood of his Wand. How his Hair gleamed when he had been showering after Quidditch Practice. How there was a kind of cold fire in his eyes when he got angry. How graciously he moved, and on and on. It didn't take him long to realize that he was completely lovestruck.
One quick lick along the length of his member made Draco buck his hips towards Harry and cry out. His hands reached for Harry and he fisted one hand in that untidy black hair, all the while moaning and gasping at the continued pleasure.
"Mr. Malfoy had stood up and looked positively livid now, but Madame Bones gave an air of being quiet able to silence him if he didn't shut up by himself.
Harry was at Draco's side faster than anyone could say 'curse' and the spell that Draco had directed at the heart of his father was distracted so that it hit the wall opposite. The black haired boy held Draco's Wand-arm firmly in his grip, keeping the struggling boy from shooting more curses.
"How did it go? Are you all right Draco? You look pale, do you want something to eat, a hot chocolate maybe? No, that's a drink... A chocolate bar!"
"You brought a friend... Did you ask Daddy? If not, this could be bad... very bad... Daddy may get angry..." She swayed a bit and put one of her long-fingered hands to her head as if she had a headache. Draco's Expression was no longer anxious. It was sad. Maybe he had hoped that somehow his mothers confusion would be cured if his father was locked away. But this did not seem to be the case. He made a step forward and took her hand. Then he guided her careful back in her room, and made her sit down on a chair. She let him, looking slightly dazed still but Harry could also feel that she didn't have anything against Draco's presence. When she sat, Draco knelled down in front of her, so that he could look her in the face.
The black-haired looked at him and sighed quietly. Then he began to write a note to Mr. Weasly. He explained that Draco and he were currently in the same location and that Draco needed medical Treatment and some care taking. He didn't want to explain the finer Details in a letter, it was to private. And there was always the danger of the owl being caught of and the post being searched, in which case he didn't want to reveal too much.
"Mrs. Weasly." He finally said in a quiet tone. Even though she was rummaging around loudly with all the Ingredients, she stopped as abruptly as if he had shouted. Standing very still she did not turn around.
From the sounds the Slytherin made he was more than ready. Harry pulled his fingers out and put his own member at the entrance. Draco moaned loudly, rocking his hips forward as to invite him in and Harry didn't need any more convincing. He pushed completely into Draco, who let out a loud scream, and waited until the blonde had adjusted. Pushing back and forth he soon found a rhythm that seemed to drive Draco crazy. He yelled and moaned, gasping for air and stuttering Harry's name whenever the black-haired pushed in.
"Harry, you have been there for me in probably the hardest time of my life. What kind of a boyfriend would I be if I wasn't able to have your back now?" The Slytherin blushed a little and Harry realized that it was the first time ever that Draco had called himself Harry's boyfriend in public. His heart made a jump and there were a kind of tingling in his stomach. He squeezed Draco's hand firmly and nodded, his throat dry. Mr. Weasly smiled.
"You're beautiful...", Harry whispered quietly and he saw something surface in Draco's Eyes, Love and maybe a bit of pain. Harry knew this feeling. This thin line between Pain and pleasure that never seemed quiet clear with them. He kissed Draco again, deep and full of Lust, from his mouth he wandered down to his Collarbones, loving the little moans that he got in return. His hand wandered beneath Draco's shirt, caressing the already hard nipples, making him moan and gasp under his touches.
Harry stood there and suddenly felt very lost. He wished that there was something he could do, something to help Draco. But he was powerless. For the first time in his life he realized how god damn powerless he was. He couldn't save Draco. He hadn't been able to protect him. There was just nothing he could do.
Draco's Voice was still feeble and sore but he had spoken. Tears were still streaming down his face, dropping into his already wet lap. He looked up and for the first time, he seemed to really I see Harry. His eyes were not sparkling any more, gone was the cold fire. He looked broken and shattered and his look pleaded for Harry not to desert him.
"Not for what happened. I am sorry, that it took me so long to find you. I should have seen it earlier, should have given you someone to tell all this." He looked deep into those blue crystals, like ice, or the sea, incomprehensible and mysterious. Draco looked back and when he smiled now, it was a real smile.
"Who will you send it to?" asked Draco carefully, when he saw that Harry took a Parchment out of the Drawer. Harry looked at him. He had planned to write to the Weasly's but now started to think if it was such a good Idea.
after which no one seemed really interested anymore, though Harry did spot two Garden gnomes in the backyard a few days later that definitely hadn't been there before.
"Do you think you can just do this to me? After all I have worked for so hard, after all I have gained? I am a respected member of the Magic Society. I am a well now benefactor for Charity's. I am influential at important parts in this Ministry. Do you think I will let you ruin all that? For him?"
"He... he... abused me...he..." Draco took one last deep breath and then said, so quiet that Harry nearly didn't hear it "...raped me." Pain, so much pain shone in this bright blue eyes, but there were no Tears. Harry asked himself if there were only so many tears a Person could shed before he became dry of them.
"I want it to end.", he said after a while. "No matter what, I want it to ed. I can never go back to that again." he took a deep breath. Then he looked down at Harry, beaten, so up giving that his Heart throbbed painfully.
"Yeah.", He just said, feeling sad. This big house had been built for a family. Instead it had housed an Insane Asylum of Fear, Pain and Confusion. He took a deep breath and looked at his lover.
He spoke in a soft, low voice as if soothing a frightened animal. Carefully, he came on the bed and neared Draco. The other looked at him in fear, but Harry kept speaking to him carefully.
"Of course. Why don't you come into my study so that we can talk undisturbed." He beckoned them up the stairs into a small, cramped room. There were papers everywhere but also a lot of stuff that looked ordinary at first glance to Harry, like a collection of spoons, lots of watches, cellphones, Pens and others, but Harry was sure that most of them where either already magically enhanced when Mr. Weasly got hold of them and the rest had been bewitched my himself or was about to be. Mr. Weasly was fascinated with Muggle stuff and loved to try and take them apart and update them with one or two spells, very much to the dislike of Mrs. Weasly.
Harry opened his mouth but, again, it was Draco who started speaking first and Harry closed it again hastily. It looked as if the fact that his father was now locked away and he was safe brought out Draco's normal self again and Harry would be damned to go between that.
"I'm sorry Harry, I really didn't mean to cause any Mayhem at your Aunt and Uncle's, I just..." But Mr. Weasly's explanation was cut short because Harry sank to the ground now anyway, positively roaring with laughter, as was Ron. Draco, clearly not used to such out breaks of amusement, smiled.
"You better eat up," sighed Harry, "because it could be the last bigger meal for the next few days."
When they got there they looked back at where Mr. Weasly must be coming any minute. And sure enough, he came. He came fast, almost running. He skidded to a hold in front of them, said "Grab my arm!" and they had only just done so, when Mr. Weasly already started to dissapparate, but not, before Harry could catch a glimpse of Uncle Vernon, trumpeting like an injured rhino, ran towards the, red faced and looking murderous. Then he was gone, Harry felt this very unpleasant feeling of being pressed through a way to small tunnel...
As they walked towards the Dursely's House, Harry began to feel sick with fear. Draco took his hand, and a kind of warmth, that had nothing to do with magic spread through the Griffyndor. Or maybe it did. Maybe this was a kind of magic all for itself. Hadn't the love of his mother been a kind of magic too, moreover, according to Dumbledore, one of the most powerful ones? He smiled to his boyfriend and looked over to Ron, who grinned at him cheering as if he wanted to say 'Don't worry, we're here for you'. He felt better.
"That is what Mrs. Weasly called it... I didn't know it was called that." He added. Madame Bones turned to Harry.
"You know I can't help but wonder", he whispered in a hoarse voice, "what it must be like to have such a mother." Harry hugged him tighter.
When they decided it was no use to even try it any more, it was about 6 in the morning. They stood up and went down into the living room, thinking that, even if they couldn't sleep, they might find some rest away from Ron's snoring.
They arrived. There was no one in the Garden, but Harry couldn't help thinking that Aunt Petunia was peering through one of the Curtains already, eyeing everything suspiciously.
"Later, Molly. Draco is very badly hurt, you have to Prepare a bed fast and bring the aid kid to it. We have to take care of his wounds before the infection spreads." Mrs. Weasly went pale but nodded with a resolute face and hurried of to the house. Mr. Weasly got Draco out of the Car with the same spell he had used before to levitate him and went after her as fast as possible without hurting him more, Harry walking behind him. When they entered through the door Mrs. Weasly ushered them into the living room, where she had put a bed. Mr. Weasly let Draco down, careful not to let his back touch anything. Mrs. Weasly went even paler and started to tend to the wounds immediately. She cleansed them and applied some potions, which seemed to make the red of the gashes less angry. Draco winced and whined softly but he didn't regain consciousness. When Mrs. Weasly was done, she sighed.
"I sadly can't do the same for you, as your Aunt and Uncle are Muggles and do not fall into our department. But if you want, I can bring you there to get your schoolbooks and broom and stuff."
After the Argument with Ginny had been clarified, Draco's presence in the Burrow became much less strained. The Weasly's began to get used to him and in response, Draco became less jumpy and subdued, even starting to laugh at the meals and taking part in the Conversations. Harry was blissful, to see his lover get better. Still there were the nights. Draco would wake up almost every night, sweating, sometimes crying. Harry never had to ask what he had been dreaming about.
Hedwig had been out when he and Draco had been leaving Private Drive that Day and she had fluttered in at the Burrow the next morning, displaying again her strange power to always know where to find him.
But Harry had no Idea how Draco's inside really looked. Even when he did laugh at a joke Fred and George had made, he seemed kind of reserved, as if he wasn't really there. The fire had not really returned to his eyes. There was a spark, but it didn't ignite.
The thin black rimming Malfoy’s eyes had smudged into a wet mess and the painful stretch of the skin at his throat looked beyond depraved.  Harry couldn’t have imagined the image if he tried, but he found that slutty was a good look on Malfoy.
The worst of it was the last year.  Constant paranoia was common on the run and while Harry’s overactive survival instinct was great for duelling, it was much less helpful in an innocuous nightclub.  He was pretty sure the most dangerous thing there was the amount of vinegar Dean drowned his chips in.
Except this time Harry was wholly distracted.  Because not only was the man kneeling, there was another pair of legs far too close to be anything else than what it implied.
Harry’s head snapped to Ron, wondering how much he knew.  Ron’s jaw was set stiffly and he could clearly sense the tension in the air.
Harry had already accepted the consequences of being the Saviour.  Even if that meant he could never again truly enjoy a good curry, or that he had to mumble excuses to his mates on his night out to flee for the toilets.
Malfoy was in fact kneeling, but it was over the toilet.  His eyes were lined with a soft eyeliner, smudged around the edges by pools of tears.
A dark part of Harry’s mind screamed about Malfoy’s lack of movement, a sickening memory entered his mind of him laying cold and limp.  In a frenzy of emotion, Harry wound his fingers into Malfoy’s hair and tilted his head back to press in deeper.
Harry broke out of his daze and shoved any errant thoughts to the back of his head.  He really was being ridiculous.  Plus, he’d ought to make his way back before Ron nicked a chip off of Dean’s plate.
“To whom do I owe the pleasure?” Malfoy looked like shit.  His shirt was slipping off his shoulder, a far cry from the immaculate suit and robes he wore on the regular.
Luna was similarly busy with whatever she constituted as research, and Ginny... well.  Harry doesn’t remember the last time he’d even seen her, much less spoken to her.
Harry heard the rip of soft denim and Malfoy was tilting his head up to stare up at him.  His eyes were dangerously clear despite the tear tracks trailing down his cheeks and when they locked with Harry’s everything collided into a tidal wave of warmth.
He wondered whether the heavy grit in the man’s voice was a byproduct of his gagging, or if it was natural depth.  Would that unique smokiness coat every syllable if his words were hushed and whispered instead of groaned and cut off?
“I am an auror.  I have taken a professional oath to uphold the law, and I will not have you worming your way into the station to
To his surprise, the thing in Harry’s chest was only growing.  And at every filthy lick and swipe from Malfoy it blossomed into something raw and uncontrollable.
“For Salazar’s sake Potter, take it all.  For once in your life, let yourself be greedy.” Malfoy wasted no time in bringing their hips together to rub in a slow grind.
Plus, he always felt an eerie heaviness when he walked into the castle.  Even after the rebuilding, it felt like every corner of the building held invisible ghosts and piles of stone and rubble.
“Fucking Merlin.” Harry choked out on a reedy breath and Malfoy chuckled like he wasn’t handcuffed and at the department’s mercy.  At
He doesn’t know which cry he’d meant.  It was odd that he had more than one to associate with grisly bathroom accidents, three if he included the troll.
“I think you like it too.” Harry felt a dangerous wave of post orgasm bravery push him forward as he knocked their foreheads together, licking across Malfoy’s lips.
The other man yanked up his zipper with professional detachment and slipped out of the door.  Harry pressed one stiff palm down onto his erection and tried not to feel too guilty.
With his front pressed against Malfoy’s back, he lets the heat spill from his mouth and blanket their bodies like a serpent of flames.  Strobe lights were a pale comparison to the inferno that Harry could create with his appetite for Malfoy.
No matter what it meant, Harry would take anything he’d get.  Even if it felt wrong considering how much everyone else had lost at his expense.
“An auror who hides from bright lights and climbs out of bathroom windows.  How impressive.” This time Harry really did punch Malfoy.  His fist crunched into Malfoy’s jaw in a heavy underhand and it felt fucking marvellous.
His vocal chords vibrated against Harry’s palm through his skin.  Harry could feel all the scorching heat passing through his flesh, a radiating warmth that climbed up his throat like dragon’s breath.
He just hoped that sleep-hexing his hydrangeas off the nightstand would be the worst thing to happen, but hoping wasn’t enough to stop him from going to bed with one wrist handcuffed to his headboard.
Malfoy still had one hand around his prick and he startled when Harry crashed onto the floor in front of him.  The cubicle was far too small to accommodate both of them, but it left plenty of opportunity for Harry to press himself up against Malfoy.
“Out.” Harry didn’t know his voice was capable of sounding so stony, but it was certainly a day for firsts.  Malfoy rolled his eyes at the whole affair, looking awfully pretentious for someone who had their hands tied behind their back.
One weak hand clutched at his hip and Harry snapped back from his craze.  He looked down to see Malfoy’s hooded eyes waver as his fingers led Harry’s hips into a new pace of fast, grinding snaps.
Maybe Harry was just getting too old for clubbing.  That must be why every muscle in his body was tense, waiting for a body to slam into him or a flash of neon light to leave him doubled over in pain.
He pushed open the rotting wood door of the lavatory and expected relief to flood him.  Instead, there was another kind of cold, heavy claustrophobia.
“Well.  Hello to you too, Potter.” Draco Malfoy snarked from the doorway in what was the most sinfully rich and husky voice Harry had ever heard.
Malfoy’s deathly skinny fingers pulled at Harry’s belt and slipped into his pants.  He huffed a cloud of spicy heat over the head of Harry’s prick and Harry couldn’t stop his whine of discomfort.
On second thought, that was probably utter bullshit because Harry couldn’t really focus on anything other than how much he wanted to be the one in that stall.  That and the absolute shameless pleasure in the man’s moans, loud even under the sloppy sucking.
They stumbled into Harry’s stall and Malfoy’s bare knees hit the floor.  The dingy lights threw a dull filter over everything but Harry was still certain that nothing could compare to the sight of Draco Malfoy on his knees.  His eyes were hooded and sultry and his tongue snuck between his teeth to swipe over his thin lips.
Harry shooed Ron from their shared desk and Malfoy watched with silent amusement.  Then Harry slammed him against the desk with one fast movement and the sneer quickly dropped off his face.
Malfoy’s frantic motions had the tip of his prick skimming Harry’s button up.  His hand smacked against Harry’s stomach and with one strategically placed thrust he spilt over his knuckles.
“I think you need this as much as I do, Malfoy.” The answering whine was chipped and scratchy, chins banging as Malfoy pushed forward.  Ash laced with cinnamon and metallic blood was overtaken by the taste of salty cum and Harry licked into Malfoy’s mouth, tasting himself on his tongue.
.  Fucking gag on it Malfoy.” Harry didn’t recognize his own voice with the ruthless undertone.  Malfoy tightened his throat with a choke, finally surrendering to the brute force of Harry’s prick working open his throat.
Ginny was ignoring Harry’s floo call, owl mail and even his patronus charms.  After a long day at the Burrow helping Hermione and Ron while narrowly avoiding sympathetic stares from Mrs. Weasley, Harry was at his limit.
In fact, he made it all the way into the stall before even considering anything else.  But comfort didn’t explain the heavy duty disillusionment charm, or how his eyes darted down to check for a glimpse of snow white ankle.
“You might be an altruistic idiot but don’t think for a second that I am too.  You’re freezing and I have enough fire to
The first thing Harry noticed was how weirdly dry Malfoy’s tongue was.  The second, immediately after, was the
This time, Harry didn’t pretend he was there for anything else.  After a brief stint at the bar he shouldered his way into the bathroom.
“I lost people too, Potter.  Crabbe had every right to resent me and I’ll never be able to correct that.” Harry was reminded of the wide eyed terror on Malfoy’s face when he stared back at the roaring flames, entire body shaking with the inexplicable despair of losing a human life.
But that didn’t stop Harry from missing fieldwork.  He hated the nervous tension building under his fingertips, he needed the rush of a duel.
He knew he had finally won.  Malfoy was the one thing that the Saviour would never have, because the only one who could handle his heat was Harry.
It was times like this when Harry felt like he’d fallen behind.  It’d been easy to forget during the war when everyday was a gamble on his life, but now he had all the time in the world.
Malfoy pulled back to keep talking but froze at the set of Harry’s jaw, strained and pleading.  He drifted one hand to Harry’s cheek as if really looking at him for the first time.
The other man answered with his own deep hum of assent, but Harry’s mind still hadn’t caught up with the situation.
He stumbled into the only available stall and felt a vague twinge of satisfaction.  Despite the size, it wasn’t cramped inside.  It felt just right.
He pulled Malfoy in close.  To do what, he didn’t know.  But before he could speak, Malfoy hissed out in a judgmental, sibilant tone.
He knew he should feel bad about Malfoy’s situation, or at least about how much he enjoyed listening to his strained sentences.  But there was something undeniably
be alone.  There would be someone else, sharing in the silent satisfaction.  Harry had a vague idea that it might be part of why he’s fallen into a quiet sleep every night since, sated and finally rid of the incorrigible itch in his throat.
Harry only pulled away when Malfoy was writhing with overstimulation and nipping aggressively at his lips in retaliation.
“But you aren’t really like that, are you?  You do a marvellous job of hiding it, but you’re just as fucked up as me.” Malfoy’s voice wasn’t nearly as deep and richly crackling as it‘d been before, but Harry liked the way his words broke, the ravaged way he sounded when pushed to his limit and then beyond.
He stumbled back to slather Malfoy’s lips in the fluid, a few shots catching on his eyelashes and cheek.
At least he thought he‘d accepted it until he locked the rickety metal latch.  Then the infuriating anger at how unfair it all was struck him like a hammer.
He simply couldn’t step foot in the place and not remember.  His recklessness would inevitably land him locked into that old cubicle, spending another night alone.
It was morosely fitting for him to feel equally crowded in a raging fire as a chilly, cramped closet.  It seemed the wizarding world was too full with love for their saviour to spare any for Harry.
.” It sounded more like a gravelly mess of rasping than a word, but it was undeniably filthy and undoubtedly dangerous.
The dance floor had gone from annoying to oppressive.  Harry doesn’t know whether it was the push of bodies from every direction or the garish red-orange strobe lights.
“A few minutes?  And how did you feel after?” He knew what Malfoy meant.  He hadn’t noticed with the adrenaline, but he’d spent days after the war hacking up blood and ash.  The soot clung to his throat and burned like capsaicin.
Harry didn’t know where Malfoy learnt to talk like that, the Malfoy he knew was icy and snide, hiding behind a cowardly shell.  This man was all radiant heat and razor sharp remarks.  It was as if the unquenchable flames had lit a spark inside of him.
It wasn’t even that he was alone, everyone had their own scars from the war.  Ron had lost his brother for Merlin’s sake, and Hermione still paled when anybody mentioned Malfoy Manor.  So why did it feel like he was the only one trapped in an inferno of memories?
But he still made his way to the bar, craving the anonymity that he could pretend to have in the dark wave of bodies.
“You... you really don't know how to let go, do you?” Malfoy’s voice was so broken and quiet that Harry was certain that he wasn’t supposed to hear.  But then he was being pushed back against the sinks and it was all ash and cinnamon and bitter, iron-tinged blood.
