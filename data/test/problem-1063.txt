And winked. She smiled at Potter and asked him how he felt lately and how school was. Then, she looked at Draco, snorted, turned around and left, not saying a word.
Potter's friends, but he just did.
Harry nodded slowly. He didn't know what to tell Malfoy, but he wanted to be honest.
"Maybe you're right," Ron agreed, "But I want to be sure."
"Yes, minister." Potter answered monotone.
"Get dressed. Come on, lazy boy.", Draco said.
Harry understood and followed Ron into the kitchen where the stove was filled with pans in which eggs, bacon, sausages and vegetables were cooking.
"You've been gone for a while." Ron noted, "Got busy with Lydia?"
"Oh is it? Yeah, it's my fault your father got locked up in freaking Azkaban and he won't coming out until you are 33! But if it weren't for me, you would be 57!" Potter shouted and this sentence felt to Draco like a slap in the face.
He walked up to the new tower and through the common room to the corridor where his dorm room was. He entered and his eyes immediately fell on the boy laying in the bed opposite Harry's - asleep. Harry had to smile. He walked up to Malfoy's bed and leaned over him. Malfoy looked so peaceful when he was asleep, Harry almost didn't want to wake him.
"A memory with your mother didn't work? What exactly?", Harry asked and sat down on the edge of the bed.
"Why would I?", Potter asked. Draco didn't answer, he just shook his head.
Mrs Weasley stuck her head into the room. "You're right, Harry. We never do."
"Kreacher!", he shouted loudly and Draco twitched. He heard footsteps and someone jumped down the stairs.
Carefully, Harry adjusted Draco in his lap, so their groins rubbed together perfectly, their chests and stomach pressed together.
"You've been out long." Ron said, "I thought you were going home early."
Harry took Teddy off her hands, kissed him on the forehead and welcomed him home.
He heard someone clear their throat and Harry looked up. Ron stood in the door and looked at the two of them. Harry waved him over without Hermione noticing Ron sneaked to the couch. He took Harry's place on the couch and Hermione looked up. She looked at Ron with big, wet eyes.
"Neville!"
Harry knew Draco didn't like to talk about his father, but Harry never had a problem with it, but now that Harry saw how much pain Draco had felt because of Lucius, it was strange.
"Haven't I already told you that you shouldn't be sorry for every shit?", Draco asked and winked. Potter rolled his eyes.
"Aww!" Angelina, Ginny and Hermione said simultaneously.
"Weasel?" He asked and acted very surprised and confused.
"You weren't.", Potter answered. Draco laughed weakly.
"Nonsense. You sing more beautiful than anyone I've ever heard before.", Draco said.
"I said stop talking!" Draco repeated sternly, stressing every single syllable. He pushed Potter into a dark corner.
"Am I right to suppose you are coming over for Christmas?" She asked Ron, Hermione and Harry.
"In this one, he was about three years old.", Narcissa said.
"Because we're not sleeping with him."
Blood rushed to Harry's face and he was considering hexing Zabini, but then Draco grabbed his chin and forced Harry to look at him. He didn't talk. He just stared at Harry, his wonderful metallic grey eyes looking at Harry's green ones.
"It was actually Malfoy's idea," Hermione added smiling and shrugged.
They all agreed and went on the train with a lot of effort, because many of the younger students came up to them. Sitting down in an empty compartment, Harry felt the old feelings again - the amazing feeling to arrive at Hogwarts. During the ride, the old lady with the sweets trolley came by and as every year, Harry bought something for himself and his friends. She was happy to see all of them again and needed to shake Harry's hand. Gratefully, Harry smiled at her and prayed her. Passing around Chocolate Frogs for everyone, Harry opened his and got the card with Dumbledore.
"In two days. So from Monday for the whole week."
"It's not." Harry said suddenly less amused, "I like it."
Malfoy didn't look like he was going to smile, he only looked Harry deep in the eyes. So deep Harry thought he was looking at his soul, trying to find out Harry's darkest and most secret secret. And then, Malfoy leaned in. Just so close there was still space between him and Harry, but their noses were already almost touching. He mustered Harry's face. Harry wanted to make him feel better, so he did the only thing he could think of - closing the gap between them. It wasn't a kiss, their lips were just slightly brushing against each other for a few seconds.
you don't hate me anymore?" Harry asked, but he wasn't offended and he wasn't disappointed, this was exactly what he had wanted to hear.
"Did Malfoy keep you awake?", Hermione asked. Harry looked at her. Did she know? Impossible. From where should she know? She was clever... No. She didn't know. She couldn't.
"Nah, I'm freed," Malfoy answered nonchalantly.
"Nothing, it's just... I-"
"You drive me mad.", Draco smirked. Harry laughed again and stood up.
"Elvis Presley."
"Shut up!", Harry said and glared at the idiots. Draco only looked at his hands and didn't say anything.
"What does that mean?" Nott asked.
"You okay?" Nott asked.
"Argh! Great work, Draco!", Parkinson screamed and stomped with her foot on the floor. She stormed away. Crabbe and Goyle looked between Draco and Harry.
"Shut up, Potter.", Draco cut him off and grinned, "I know how I look."
Harry laughed. "
"Nothing, nothing. Only a few stupid seventh-years who try to take revenge.", Draco told her. She sighed.
"I am allowed to leave today, so I can sit up now and kiss you.", Potter answered. Draco shook his head.
"Where have you been?" Draco asked as if Harry owed him an explanation.
"Right." Malfoy said sarcastically, still smirking.
"No. No, he didn't.", Harry said and watched Professor Sprout, who stood in front of the class. She smiled and began with her lesson.
Without sayung something, Potter stood up, grabbed Draco's arm, Draco immediately grabbed his bag of sweets and they left. Potter pulled Draco all the way to the Whomping Willow. Draco escaped Potter's grip and stepped back.
"Fuck all of you!", Potter said angrily.
"Don't be stupid.", Ron said.
Draco opened the door a bit and peeked outside. "Don't look," he ordered and without asking, Potter put his hands in front of his eyes. Draco slipped into the dorm and quickly searched for black underwear and a pair of pants. He held it in front of his crotch and grabbed a towel. With the towel in one hand and the clothes in the other he jumped back into the bathroom, locked the door behind himself and started getting dressed.
Draco quietened and turned around, closed his lips with Harry's and smiled. Harry smiled too and got pressed against the wall. They stood under the wather and kissed.
"Delightful?" Luna answered smiling.
"Wow.", Harry was taken aback.
"How about favorite Quidditch team?" Harry asked and the following answer would be very important to him.
"First, I want to tell you that I've read a book.", he said. Potter looked very unimpressed.
"If you excuse me, I need to look for something.", Harry said and hushed outside.
Draco only laughed. Suddenly Harry wondered where he was going to sleep, but he didn't ask Malfoy, because he didn't want to make him uncomfortable. Maybe Harry also wished Malfoy hadn't thought about that. Malfoy asked Harry if he wanted to go outside to the garden. Following Draco back downstairs, Harry hoped he wouldn't have to go through the Drawing Room, even though Draco had been oddly understanding before.
"Oh. Quite enjoyable. Didn't really do anything. Helped my mom a bit with the house and-"
"Oh my God, I can't believe it!" He said out of breath.
Harry nodded and cleared his throat. "Yeah. Sorry. Come."
Malfoy nodded and kept eating. Harry wondered what that had been about.
Malfoy led Harry into Honeydukes. Harry loved this store. It smelled like sweets and everything was bright and happy. Malfoy walked over to a shelf with lollipops. He took one with the shape of a heart and one that looked like a bat. Harry watched him, his slim fingers wrapped around the stem of the lollipop. Harry's eyes moved up to Malfoy's face. He looked at the sweets in his hand and blinked. To Harry it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion. Malfoy turned his head and looked at Harry. They looked each other deep in the eye and something in Harry was starting to prickle. It felt weird and yet good.
"Yeah, of course he
"Enough, Kreacher.", he said sternly.
The temperature didn't come down when they left Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. They all put on sunglasses and Hermione put on her giant sun hat. She looked great with it - like a real diva. So they made their way down the Alley and eventually stopped to get some ice cream. Hermione insisted that they aould wait outside the bookstore until they had finished their ice cream, so the books wouldn't be offended.
"Mister Harry Potter! How good seeing you back at health.", a little house elf smiled up at him. Harry smiled too and sat down.
"Yeah, just imagine he likes you.", Nott whispered to Harry as they passed, "He doesn't."
"What are you thinking?" He whispered.
"Narcissa Malfoy, his wife, is a wonderful woman. She told me so much." Potter pulled out a piece of paper and read out loud:
He watched Malfoy closely as the waitress reached their table and set the steak in front of Malfoy, clearly showing her cleavage.
As Harry finished, he stood in front of Draco's bed, his arms crossed. Draco didn't look up, but Harry knew he noticed him. After the fifth time that Harry had cleared his throat, Draco finally looked up.
"Let's go.", she said and they made their way to the Entrance Hall and outside to the grounds.
"Yeah. See you, Weasel.", Draco answered and grinned.
Harry nodded agreeing, kissed Teddy on the forehead and watched him be carried outside.
"Yes. Scared of introducing you to my father.", he said quietly and looked at Potter, who rubbed Draco's back encouragely.
"Man, it's so great you're here!" Theo said, his words as unclear as Harry's and he clapped Harry on the shoulder.
"Right." The witch checked the long list of names, "Third floor, fifth door to the left."
"I hate that you have this many scars," he said.
"We'll see us in greenhouse two.", Draco whispered and kissed Harry again.
"What's wrong?" Potter asked Draco and looked rather guilty.
"Draco?"
"Fine. Now go. He needs you."
"Hey." Harry said softly, "You're awake."
"Stop doing this," Harry said, exhausted.
"Let me do it.", Potter offered and looked at the big bruise with a worried look. He held out his hand, but Draco slipped away, so that his back hit the wall.
"What?"
Draco stood there and smiled. Potter breathed in and out peacefully and Draco could cry right away again. He missed him so much!
"Hey, mate. Why so happy today?", Ron asked.
Harry nodded understanding. "I know."
"Yes, Potter?"
"I am Professor Lupin."
"My mother wanted to invite my friends to the Manor.", he said. Potter looked up at him and smiled.
She checked her list and sent him to the fourth floor - treatment for spell damage. Harry jogged to the door he was sent to and found Nott and Zabini sitting on two chairs next to the door. They jumped up when they saw Harry.
"Malfoy. You had nothing to eat yesterday and drank two bottles of fire whiskey. It's absolutely normal if you don't remember anything," Longbottom said.
?" Harry started sweating.
Harry smiled back and Malfoy vanished into the bathroom. As soon as the door closed, Harry jumped out of bed, took a deep breath to stop the pain, and walked over to the bedside table. Harry knew now not to touch it. Instead, he took out his wand and tried every spell that came into his mind. Nothing worked. Maybe Hermione would know what to do. Harry sent his patronus and hoped it would reach her in time before Malfoy would get out of the shower.
"I'll give it to you the next time we see each other."
"What? Can't we even go to the owlery now without having your face in the way?", a girl from Ravenclaw asked, looking Draco through narrowed eyes.
"No, I'm sorry Potter. He hasn't been here lately.", she answered with an excusing look.
Seamus did as he was told and immediately reddened. Harry and Ron watched him stammer a few words and halves of sentences and helped him to form the other halves. Harry, Seamus and Ron were still in their pyjamas - they have had a sleepover the night before and Harry didn't want to get dressed before he really needed to go.
"Harry?" Ron's voice broke the silence in the dark.
Harry and Draco jumped up and put on their pullovers. Harry told Ron he could uncover his eyes, but as soon as Ron did, he put his hand right back up.
"I'm sorry.", he said.
"Potter!", Draco snapped and Harry grinned.
"No," Harrt said and shook his head, "Don't you start like this. You have no idea how angry and hurt I was. I am."
"It will always stand between us," Draco said and Potter's eyes hushed back to him.
Potter's eyes flew open.
. Draco looked at him with a quizzical look.
, the thing between you and Malfoy would become more, then you can't go out of her way forever. Someday you have to face her and I think better sooner than later."
"What the fuck are you doing?", Draco gasped.
"Potter.", Draco whispered against his lips.
Draco nodded.
"Is that okay for you?", he asked. Draco felt Potter's breath on his lips and smiled.
He kept walking through the dim corridor. Harry broke into a run.
And so they did it on the small round kitchen table. Until the table screamed and finally broke.
"Malfoy invited me to Nott's birthday in three weeks." Harry mentioned while flicking through the pages.
Weasley seemed like he would vomit and Granger looked as if she
Another kiss.
They sat down across from each other and set up the chess board and figures on the table between them. Harry felt excitement spreading inside him but he tried to hold back his smile because he didn't want to annoy Malfoy. But to Harry's surprise he got a glimpse of Malfoy smiling himself. They started playing and Harry found that Malfoy really
After some time they went back inside and as Harry checked the clock in the living room he found that it was already nine o'clock. Malfoy pulled out his wand and cast a quick drying spell on himself and Harry did the same. The smile on Malfoy's lips threw Harry off track and he didn't know what to say. So to break the silence Harry asked if Malfoy wanted to drink something. Malfoy nodded and Harry filled their glasses with water again. Harry smiled widely. He was happy and even though Malfoy didn't mean to show it, Harry could see that he was happy too
"I'm sorry, Hermione. I didn't mean to worry you, I just lost track of time."
Malfoy stared at Harry. "Today," he replied, sounding absent.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Draco. Today is the last day I'll see them. We can spend the whole holidays together.", he said and walked closer to Draco, but Draco took a step back.
"Nice choice, nice choice!" Dean said, hyping up the crowd even more.
"It's called yoga, idiot.", Potter answered and stood up. He rolled up his mat and shoved it under his bed.
He took a deep breath and Draco held his hand. Every house in thus street looked similar. In front of this house stood a red thing with four wheels. Potter said it was a car, which Muggles used to get feom one place to another. Draco had read about cars in the book.
in their sense wasn't harmless enough.
They lay down in their beds and Draco smiled. Somehow Potter understood him. In some way both of them shared the same past. With a smile on his face, sleep swept over Draco.
What was happening here?
you trying to be nice?" Granger asked.
"That should be interesting.", Harry said and stopped.
"You have to?" Longbottom said sternly and shoved Draco out of the bathroom.
"Draco?", Potter asked as they sat down on the couch together. Draco looked at him.
And a third time, Draco nodded wordlessly.
"Please. Draco." As soon as Harry said this, a tear rolled down his face.
Harry rolled around in the hammock and watched Hermione watering her plants while Ron was inside making lunch. Harry wasn't a very talented cook, and since Ron had had Molly as his teacher, he was their better option. Harry thought about the night before as he closed his eyes. Malfoy hasn't been as a pain in the arse as Harry would have thought. He actually hasn't been that bad. Harry wouldn't say he'd been nice, but he hasn't been
He garbbed at Draco, his hands meeting smooth, warm, firm skin and just the feel of Draco's body against the pads of his fingers, just the smell of him, made Harry feel like he was coming apart. Draco was breathing fast, his hand working Harry's foreskin slick and sure, so much better than Harry doing it himself. So good, so insanely good, and when Draco tightened his grip and worked him right down to the root, Harry let out a long moan and came all over Draco's fucking fist, long spurts of it, making Harry shake.
Harry looked at Draco, who shrugged. Harry sighed and grabbed his wand. He lifted the spell from the curtains. Ron opened them and even though he knew Draco was in there, he looked shocked.
Draco stood up too, glaring at his father.
Narcissa has never been a fan of empty phrases, so she always said only what she thought.
Pansy smiled. "Great. This evening. Wear something cool."
"Would you excuse me?" He said, didn't even wait for an answer and stormed out of the room. Draco sat down in the armchair in the common room and ripped open the letter.
As you guessed, I just recieved a letter from father as well. He was very stern, he told me I would have disgraced our family and he wouldn't have expected this from me. He also said Potter was our enemy. I am deeply sorry, but I fear I have to disagree with him. When I visited Potter in the hospital wing, his friend also called me their enemy and it hurt me a lot. I feel like the war has separated our world more than before. Now also my generation is affected by believing in good and evil and I just don't know how to survive this."
Draco's throat dried and he was just about to suggest they should work on covering Potter's whole body with hickeys right now.
Harry shoved the cauldron to Malfoy. He looked in again, pulled a face and drunk. He tried to talk, but his face went even more pale than it already was and he held his throat.
Harry nodded, but then realized Draco couldn't see him. "Yeah." Harry started to cry, but he tried to keep his voice steady so Draco wouldn't notice anything. "Yeah, he was the one. He was my dad's best friend and very quickly he was mine, too. We were going to live together."
Harry's throat tightened and he gasped for air. He was having a panic attack. Hermione and Ron caught on quickly and got up and sat down next to Harry.
"No problem.", he said, nodded at Ginny shortly and left.
He had a beautiful handwriting. Draco wrote, that he missed his mother and thanked her for these nice words. He didn't address his father specifically. He wrote, that he was sorry to tell his mother, but he wasn't coming home over summer, because he had found someone better, who would like to have him in company. As he wrote these words, Harry smiled. At the end, he wrote:
When they make Potter that unhappy, then they are no good friends. Draco stepped out from behind the shelf and walked up to their table. The three of them looked at him, only on in Potter's face was relieving to be seen. Draco smiled at him.
Draco closed the door behind himself and went downstairs. On the street, he lifted the charm and the leather jacket in his hand became visible. He mounted his broom, kicked off the ground and made his way to the diner. The sky was still a little bright and the air was now at a perfect temperature.
"Don't pretend you don't wish I will starve," Draco answered and snorted.
"Stop it.", Harry told him after dinner, when they all sat in the Gryffindor common room.
"Don't you worry about it." She said.
"Can I maybe?" Draco asked shyly.
"Good."
"House elf?", Draco asked and looked around.
Harry didn't see it coming that she clicked her pen and scribbled something down on her clipboard. Oh shoot, what if Malfoy would find out about this? Harry scratched the back of his hand nervously.
"No. I won't. Mom, he hates me. I said things I didn't want to, but I was hurt and stupid.", he answered.
Vernon didn't reply. Harry smiled sadly and let Hedwig out of her cage. Aunt Petunia brought food upstairs into Harry's room for the two of them and Draco shot her some frightening looks. It was not much to eat, but Harry was already used to it.
Sipping his beer, Harry looked around. Ginny, Luna and Hermione danced happily to the loud music, Dean, Neville and Ron watched them smiling. Harry felt a bit of jealousy when he looked at the boys watching their beautiful girlfriends dance. He sighed and put his glass to his lips. But Harry's jealousy vanished as Luna grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the girls. He joined their dance and Ron, Neville and Dean laughed amused and started dancing as well.
"I don't want this."
"Tell him."
"Yes, I do.", he answered.
"Wow, Neville, that's so cool.", Hermione said smiling. Neville smiled back and bit in his carrot.
"Well," He said and got up, "Shall we go back downstairs?"
"Merlin, shut up.", Harry said, rolling his eyes, and stepped even closer, so that their bodies slightly touched.
Draco forced a smile.
"Yeah, nothing," Malfoy answered and sounded convinced.
Harry's heart leapt and he smiled.
"Sorry, Hermione, but I'm really tired. I think I'll be going to bed," he lied.
In the matter of the following week, London has evolved into a beautiful winter wonderland. Harry and Ron have been at work most of the week, but on Saturday they went out and about with Draco. It was nice to see him again and even though they didn't hold hands in public, Harry felt Malfoy's hand brushing his own every now and then. They walked through the snow, wrapped in coats and scarfs, through Diagon Alley. Ron wanted to stop and see George, so they made their way down to the joke shop.
"What is with his eyes?", he asked after thinking what he could say next.
"Is he here?" He asked.
"Hello Potter. I'm Draco and I'm here even if you didn't expect me to come.", Draco laughed quietly.
"I don't think so," Draco answered and laughed.
Harry nodded and walked out the door with the three Slytherins. They followed him down the lamp-lit street through the pouring rain, hurrying around corners and finally stopped in front of a very familiar pub. Harry and the others stormed inside and to Harry's relief they found Malfoy sitting at the bar, a half-empty glass of whiskey in his hand.
"Now...", Hermione sat down next to Harry,
"Or this-", he grabbed Harry's arse.
"Fine. The prison sentence is reduced to 15 years. With that, the case Lucius Malfoy is closed." And he hit with the gavel on the desk once again.
"We should get dressed." He said and Draco nodded.
"Hermione went to the store and Ron ist still asleep." Harry answered with a light smile.
"Thank you dear." Mrs Weasley answered as she stirred the sauce, "Ron, help Harry to lay the table."
"You're having these dreams again, aren't you?"
"Are you mental?" Ron shook his head violently, "He should
"Are you sure?", Potter pulled away, looking utterly confused.
Harry and Malfoy made their way towards the hut and a sweet scent filled their noses. Harry smiled. This was Christmas. Harry ordered two caramel apples and gave one to Malfoy. Harry smiled.
He stood for a moment and then hurried to the living room. Even though he hadn't gotten a letter back from Malfoy, Harry hoped he wouldn't have changed his mind. With a flick of his wand Harry rearranged the pillows on the couch, folded the blanket and tidied up the couch table. The kitchen had already been cleaned by Ron after lunch, so Harry was glad he didn't have to do anything there. He cleaned the bathroom by putting a spell on the cleaning utensils. While they were doing their job, Harry left the bathroom. He froze for a second and thought. Should he clean his room too? Was Malfoy going to go to his room? But then Harry thought it couldn't hurt to clean it up a little as well.
And so Harry told Ron what had happened that morning as he woke up and Madame Pomfrey's face when she saw them both lying in his bed naked. Ron couldn't stop laughing.
Hermione laughed softly and shook her head. "No, you're all clear. Harry just wanted to talk to Malfoy and I thought it would be nice for the two of us to go out."
"No, don't."
"You did, Harry."
"And even if I did, what's wrong with it?", Harry asked angrily.
"Hey Potter.", Draco greeted Harry happily and kissed him shortly, what made Parkinson's face turn red in anger.
Draco looked up at Potter. His fingers were trembling and Draco figured Potter must be really nervous to have asked this.
"No problem," Longbottom said and Draco watched him walk away.
"Well then." Potter said and smiled. He actually smiled at Draco.
"I don't know, Harry. Do you really think it's a good idea to be with his father when he learns that his son is dating his former enemy?", Ron asked and furrowed his brow.
Draco stepped out and hoped that Potter wouldn't notice him, but he did. He turned around and opened his mouth to say something, but the second he saw Draco's "clothing", he closed his mouth again.
"Of course you can." Hermione said and the two of them sag down.
"What is it?", he asked. Potter couldn't speak. His mouth stood open and he breathed in and out. What was it???
"Draco, how do you think of keeping the bloodline uphold? He's not pureblood and you won't have any children. What will happen to the Malfoy-family?", Lucius asked.
"I dreamt of you. And me.", Draco told him hesitantly. Potter turned around.
Harry knew.
"Well, I was just..." Harry tried to talk himself out of it.
Without any warning, Draco stepped closer towards Harry,
Harry smiled too and agreed. They didn't talk for a while, but Harry noticed Malfoy shifting uncomfortably.
He really didn't want to sit with them. And he was sure that they definitely didn't want to sit with him.
"Just tired." He said.
Harry and Seamus followed them and sat down as Ron put the pot in the centre of the table. They ate and laughed and Harry's eye fell on the clock. He had an hour until he had to be at the party. Harry felt his heartbeat fasten with the ticking of the clock. Why was he so excited?
Harry looked up.
"Your scarf. Wow, thanks." Malfoy said happily.
No, not the person. Potter! Draco ran from
"I showed Ron a few Muggle games.", she explained. Ron smiled.
"After all the years you should be used to it.", Pomfrey said and Harry smiled.
"Don't worry about me. I'll just go and pretend that I don't exist so you can talk shit about me." Draco said and left in his room.
"You are the stupid one here! Why don't you just accept it? Why? Is it so hard for you to understand that I really like him? What would you say if I say Hermione's a foul Mudblood no one likes? What would you say?", Harry bellowed out.
Draco rolled his eyes and gritted his teeth, but Harry laughed and jumped next to him onto the bed. Harry touched Malfoy carefully, making sure he wasn't hurting him. Harry felt more butterflies in his stomach than he had ever felt before. Lying here with Malfoy, not talking, just being in each other's company was so soothing - a word Harry had never imagined to use in that context. Something crossed Harry's mind that made him stop smiling immediately.
"Well, let's go and come back later. Draco is waiting for us.", Harry sat and stood up.
"Can you-"
"Malfoy.", she said and nodded.
"Then what's the reason?"
"Me? Oh, I'm fine.", Harry answered surprised.
"So you're telling me," Theo put the book in his lap and folded his hands on it, "that Potter suggested to have a truce and you said yes?"
"I dont want to go.", Draco breathed, his hands gently tugging on Harry's hair. Harry chuckled.
Ron already sat in the garden when Harry came out as well. Crookshanks sat in Hermione's lap. Harry looked up at the sky and saw that his beautiful new owl came soaring down towards them, but he wasn't alone. As they came closer, Harry saw that the second owl had a letter in its beak.
He wanted to like them at least for Potter - Alright, Draco admitted it, it was ridiculous to still call him Potter, but it was a habit.
Harry clutched his heart when Mr and Mrs Weasley came into sight. They smiled so proud as if he was their own child. "And you can tell everybody, this is your song..."
"Malfoy.", Harry whispered.
Draco woke up again and moaned. It was twenty minutes before lunch and his body was a wreck.
"Which one?", Draco asked nervously.
"I- you know what? Fuck it. I'll do it.", he answered.
Theo's nosy look followed Draco from the door through the living room until he sat down next to Theo on the sofa.
Harry tried to think of good memories, of things that made him happy. And funnily enough, Malfoy came to mind again. His smile that was way too rare, his grey eyes, his excited look when he watched Harry dance and his stupid favorite ice cream flavor.
"How did you do on your exams?" Hermione asked Harry.
"No really, it's fine, thank you." Nott ignored Draco professionally, "You've done more than enough to help."
"Favorite food?" Malfoy asked.
"Well, alright. Do what you think is right. Now what was that with the attacking?"
"Why not?" Harry asked curiously.
Malfoy shook his head. "Hate it."
Harry grinned. "I'm a
Harry was making breakfast - scrambling eggs and toasting bread and cutting fruit. He knew he should probably keep eating healthy food for a few more days, but he just couldn't stand not having scrambled eggs in the morning. When everything was done, Harry levitated it over to the table. He sat down and started eating. Halfway through the eggs, Harry realized how lonely he really felt. He wished Hermione and Ron were there. Or Malfoy... Harry sighed and bit in his marmalade toast.
"No problem mate."
"Harry Potter," Draco finished.
"It's fine.", Draco answered, smiled and kissed Potter on his forehead shortly.
"What is wrong with you?" Ron said loudly, "You wouldn't do anything for Harry! We know what you wrote in your letter so you can drop the scheme now!"
They sat by the water for another hour, until the sky was in the darkest shade of black and some stars peeked out from behind the heavy clouds. Until Draco stood up.
Harry smirked and led the Slytherin upstairs. He opened the door to his dorm and stepped inside. Draco followed him and closed the door. Draco looked at Ron and snickered.
"And what did you dream last night?"
Harry couldn't help but laugh. Malfoy was right, this
Malfoy nodded again.
"We can't leave now.", he said.
"We have watched both of you bitch about each other for seven long years." Theo said, "Ever since you met each other it was one long duel."
"Do they hurt?" He asked in half a whisper.
"This is insane," Harry said and laughed.
"Well, good.", Granger said and watched them with narrowed eyes.
"Oh.", she said coldly.
Harry grinned back. He knew that Draco had no chance against his Firebolt, and soon enough, Draco found that out himself. They soared through the air, the wind ruffling through Harry's hair while Malfoy's hair stayed exactly as neat as always, after all it had taken him fifteen minutes this morning to get it like this. Flying had always been relieving to Harry, something where he can clear his mind. But now, as he was flying above the grounds of Malfoy Manor with Draco Malfoy, Harry couldn't clear his head.
Harry smiled. He pulled Malfoy's face down to his and kissed him. "You are amazing," he said and smiled, Malfoy smiled as well.
Harry smiled. "Yeah, I guess that's when it started. He took me to my aunt and uncle's after my parents died, but obviously I don't remember that. He saved me and brought me home."
This lesson was awful. Harry had to stare hat Draco all the damn time, because he knew how Draco looked without these school robes on.
Harry laughed even louder as Hermione grabbed Ron's bag and pulled out three boxes of Liquorice Wands. Ron shrugged sulky and put two boxes back.
"Hey.", Harry said. Draco looked up, then back down without saying a word. Harry nodded and pulled off his shirt.
"Yes, Ron. Again," His girlfriend said annoyed, "You can never read a book too many times."
happened?"
"I said forget it, Potter.", Malfoy's voice answered and he shook his head.
"Yes, Harry, they're right. Is everything okay?", Hermione asked. Harry felt anger rising up inside him.
Ron didn't answer, he stared straight ahead. And before anyone could hold him back, Dean launched himself onto Malfoy.
"Yes, yes, but who are you going to ask?", Ron asked.
"What? You don't like them?" Malfoy asked and Harry couldn't decide if the tone in his voice was concern or disappointment.
"I- I don't have anything to wear..." Malfoy said as Harry grabbed his pyjama.
"I'm not." Malfoy scowled.
"And besides, I want to have you around me twenty four hours a day.", Harry added, smirking.
When Harry woke up in the middle of the night, he was sweating and his heart was beating as if he'd just run a marathon. He'd had a dream about Voldemort, the first one since the end of the war. Harry didn't like to think of it like that, but he wouldn't be surprised if Malfoy was the reason for this dream. Whether Harry liked it or not, Malfoy was the closest Harry would get to Voldemort now, and Harry and Malfoy were pretty close.
, it's
"What?" Draco asked a bit confused.
"Just like in the beginning, huh?" He said.
"Neville, promise you won't tell
"My father reads the prophet.", Draco said and Harry felt like someone punched into his chest.
Draco looked up at Potter and swallowed.
"What?" Hermione and Ron blurted out at the same time.
"This has become to be one of my favorites," Potter said.
"How's he doing?" Nott asked.
Draco didn't know what to say. Why did Potter act like he was interested in all of this? Draco didn't want to talk about his mother or his feelings. He stared at Potter for a long time and could see that Potter was feeling intimidated and sorry. Draco sipped his whisky and looked into the glass as he put it back down on the table.
"Want... to come to my place?" Harry said before he could stop himself.
Harry and Draco kissed shortly before Malfoy opened the door and stepped out into the street and Harry closed the door. He sat down on the soft living room carpet and played with Teddy until Ron came back from the market.
"When I was little, she used to sing a lullaby to me. It was about stars and stuff like that, a Black-tradition. She cradled me in her arms and sang.", Malfoy said and still didn't look at Harry.
It was quiet for a long time and Harry really, really wanted to sleep, but something was bothering him.
off! What the hell?! Draco felt weird, what Potter must have noticed.
it, that was sure. Even though he had had these dreams... It was strange. Draco didn't think these dreams meant anything, but he was scared of Potter seeing them, so he started taking Dreamless Sleep- a potion that allowed him to sleep without having any dreams.
"Will Nott be there when they release you?" Harry asked.
"So you're smoking." Harry finally said after he made sure that this wasn't a topic Malfoy would be offended by.
There it was again. That one word Weasley had used as well.
"Thanks.", Harry smiled.
"Tired, Potter?" Draco asked.
"Boring. I've learnt much more when Snape was teaching the subject.", Draco answered. Potter's brow furrowed.
Harry showed him the finger and followed Draco outside. Although Harry knew what Nott said wasn't true, he had a strange feeling as he followed Draco through the dungeon corridor. In front of the library, Draco stopped and waited for Harry. When Harry finally caught up, Draco looked at him worried.
"He just turned one year old this April." Harry told her and watched Malfoy out of the corner of his eye.
"Outside!", he hissed to his two friends.
"Your not communicative this morning, are you?"
"Harry!" Hermione let herself fall on her knees beside him.
" Malfoy said, but smiled.
Potter stepped back and looked even more afraid. "Did I do something wrong? I mean-"
"Are you okay, Mal-"
They sat. And kissed. Harry found that Draco had more muscles than it seemed, and he had such a petite waist. And then they stopped. And talked. As Harry yawned widely, Malfoy smiled.
Harry looked at him.
"Ron, I-", but Hermione gave up talking to Ron and tried it with Harry: "What's going on here?"
"You're
"Huh?" Harry asked.
Harry walked towards the room,
"I need a cigarette first." He said and walked out of the store without another word.
"What the hell, Potter?" Draco said outraged and laughed.
Harry did indeed like what was behind it - an even bigger fireplace than the one in Malfoy's room, two enormous dark green leather armchairs and shelves and shelves of books. On the floor was a big fluffy carpet showing the Slytherin crest. The room looked actually cozy, unlike the other rooms in the Manor. Of course, everything was held in black, green and silver - how could it be different when every generation of the Malfoy family had been in Slytherin?
About twenty minutes later, Harry and Hermione made their way to the Great Hall. Draco already waited for them and together, they set off for the library. Draco took Harry's hand and as Harry looked at him surprised, he shrugged grinning.
"Happy Holidays, Harry.", Hermione said with a small smile and hugged him.
"Well. Did you like it?"
"Because many students tried to damage it and the headmistress was afraid someone could manage it. And she thought maybe someone might steal it." Hermione explained.
"Um, guys, I'm sorry but I'm really tired now... Had a long day.", he told his friends.
He walked with Hermione over to the table, where her stuff lay and to his regret, there sat Ginny on a chair and wrote something on a piece of parchment.
Harry didn't know what to say. He took Draco's hand. How had he never thought of the fact that this relationship affected Draco as well as Harry?
On their way into the Great Hall, Harry asked Hermione, "Why is the book in McGonnagal's office?"
"Why are you acting like this is not a big deal?" Ron asked.
"Alright.", he said coldly and continued eating, avoiding Draco's eye.
"I saw your dreams. How they treated you."
The bathroom door opened and Malfoy stepped into the room. He rubbed his head with a towel, but froze when he saw Harry, tears streaming down his face and letter in his hand.
"Sleep well, Harry.", Granger said smiling. Draco rolled his eyes again.
. Harry had never found out what that talk had been all about, but he was really fond of the idea that Ron and Draco had a little secret.
Harry's and Draco's eyes found each other's and they smiled. People on the dancefloor made room for the groom's to dance. Harry felt overwhelmed by happiness. Draco held out his hand with a smug look on his face.
"Yes.", he said and a lot more students groaned and shoved more money towards Seamus, who grinned widely.
"What are you talking about, you idiot? Of course he will!", Draco said.
Harry closed the door behind himself and sighed. Malfoy was an idiot. Harry couldn't talk normally to him because he was always bickering and snapping at Harry. Idiot.
"Whoa, what? Who said anything about getting together? I mean did I?"
anything, the only thing he was being was ridiculous.
"I'm going to get Ron. You stay."
"Merlin!", Draco said loudly, "What are you doing?" Potter laughed.
"What were you thinking about? You were so quiet." Pansy said and Draco rolled his eyes.
"What the hell, mate?" Ron said quietly, "How did he get here?"
Draco nodded. Harry kissed him on the forehead and his hand twitched. He wanted to touch the Dark Mark, he wanted to know what it felt like. But Harry wasn't sure if he could, if Draco would want him to. Harry thought the issue was less that Harry saw the Mark rather than Draco himself seeing it and being reminded of it. Before Harry could voice his concerns, Draco lifted his hand from Harry's chest, grabbed Harry's wrist and put his hand on the Dark Mark. This was such a huge step and Harry almost couldn't believe it. He slowly and carefully traced his finger over the faded snake and felt that there was nothing there - no burn in his scar, no tingling sensation under his fingertips, no anger. All Harry felt was Draco.
This morning, as they walked down to the kitchens, many students were shooting him and Potter looks that made even Draco flinch and he had had to see these faces for seven years already.
He took Draco inside the shop and Draco stormed to one TV.
"Nope. Get it yourself, Malfoy.", Potter answered and flipped the page uninterested.
"No seriously. Why not?", he asked.
you can see him, only one person is allowed in there." The woman answered, then turned on her heel and walked away.
"You look nice today," she said, "very handsome."
"Draco?", he asked loudly and wished his boyfriend were here. The curtains were opened and Harry looked up excitedly.
Draco realxed a bit, because Potter was still smiling at that was all that counted right now.
"Sirius, what should I do?" Harry asked quietly even though he felt really ridiculous doing so.
Draco ordered another round of whiskey. Harry rolled his eyes and tugged at Draco's arm when he pit down the empty glass again.
Harry watched the healer walk away and then turned to look at Malfoy, who looked very sad again. Harry sighed. He just wanted to see Malfoy smile again like he did on the rooftop.
"Nothing.", Draco answered, "Shut up, Potter." Potter laughed.
Harry smiled sadly. He felt really bad for Malfoy and he would do anything to make him smile again, but Harry figured the only thing doing the trick would be Narcissa getting healthy. Malfoy yawned widely and Harry felt his heart jump a little.
As always, Blaise sat with his new friends. Draco simply couldn't understand how Blaise could forget all his values so easily. Draco sat down in his usual lonely spot at the Slytherin table and watched everyone else while he bit into his carrot. His eye fell on Potter, sitting at the table across the Hall and talking to his friends. Arse.
"You sure?" Pansy asked worried and he nodded.
"This is Draco. My..." Harry stopped himself. His
Draco's heart leapt forward together with his body as he shot bolt upright. He pressed one hand against Potter's open mouth and gripped Potter's hip with the other.
"I don't want to see this." Malfoy said, but Harry didn't care.
"Um... I'm going to take a shower now, I need one.", Harry lied. Ron looked at him.
The waitress turned bright red and waved at him shyly. Potter turned back around.
"Piss off." Harry said and closed the bathroom door behind him. While he got dressed he heard Malfoy laughing outside and Harry wanted to punch him in the face so badly.
Slowly, Nott, Goyle and Zabini nodded and left the room without looking back. Harry knew, they did whatever Draco told them. They had done so since they were children and they won't stop doing so now. Harry looked at Draco, who waited until the dokr was closed.
So many stores in Diagon Alley and Draco just
Harry nodded. "Me too."
"That's Sirius.", Potter said, pointing at the boy with the long black hair.
"Good morning.", Ron said and looked around the grey curtains.
"I love you more, Draco Malfoy.", Harry whispered and rolled to his side as well and looked Draco in the eyes.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and finally stuck out his index finger. Teddy wrapped his tiny fingers around it and his hair turned silvery-blond. Harry smiled at Draco's surprised expression.
Potter wrinkled his nose and he looked almost cute, so Draco had to smile. He had never imagined staying up late with
"Are you crazy?" Potter asked, "We are
Harry twitched and cringed and pulled a face. A warm hand touched his neck and waist and pulled him against a second body. Harry felt the pointy knees, but didn't wake up.
Draco heard a shriek from the girls and they ran away. He was confused and everything had happened so fast, but Draco now realised what had happened.
"Because Granger wouldn't let me go. Said it would be rude or whatever." Draco lied quickly, "So I figured..."
"Your face is abnormally red.", said Neville, he too didn't know where Harry had his eyes.
"If you're not going to tell me, then don't mention it.", Malfoy said and continued unpacking his own trunk.
"Why so bitchy, Potter?" Malfoy asked and laughed stupidly.
"Don't try and talk to me, Potter.", he said.
The minister narrowed his eyes again. Draco's heart was beating fast. He looked from Potter to the minister to his father to the Wizengamot and back to Potter. There was a moment of silence in the courtroom while the minister glared at Potter, who stood there with his usual smile and looked back at the minister. Then the jury started whispering and the minister took his gavel and knocked on his table.
Harry narrowed his eyes. Something was going on, but he didn't know what. The two of them and Malfoy have been acting strange all week now. Mrs Weasley hadn't answered to Harry's letter and when they have walked along Diagon Alley, Harry had noticed that there were a lot less people in
"This will be cold for a second.", he said and waved his wand over Draco's red knuckles. Indeed, coldness swept over his hand, but vanished after a second.
"Good morning." She said and wandered into the kitchen, "How long have you been up?"
Harry looked back at her.
"Don't you worry, my boy.", he said and turned to face the class again, but Harry spoke:
"Why don't you wear the sweater?" Harry asked.
Harry nodded. "She did. But what if she gets mad at Malfoy? I mean maybe she doesn't want him to have anything to do with me?"
Draco's chin dropped. Did he just say Draco was
"Draco, we need to get up.", Harry whispered. Draco rubbed his cheek on Harry's bare chest and shook his head sleepy.
"Before you ask, I'm not giving you Potter now. He needs to explain something to me. It's private so I can't let you listen. And besides, Potter doesn't have to stick to you whenever you want. So if you will excuse us, we have something to discuss."
"Just wait.", Potter said and vanished smiling.
. This was crazy. This was absolutely mental! Draco pulled his hand back.
"Because I thought you wouldn't like it. And I thought it's not important enough to bother you with it.", he answered shyly and turned red. Harry smiled.
Harry tuned around, now facing Draco.
"Potter, what in Heaven's sake are you doing?", he asked breathlessly.
"No! Forget I said anything."
Harry looked around again, then left the room and closed the door behind him.
Harry nodded slowly and turned on his heel.
"Is it?" She asked smiling and the librarian nodded.
"Talk to me."
"Nope.", Potter answered and locked Draco into an iron grip.
"Draco.", Harry replied and smiled.
But the second they were in the Café, Draco let go of Potter's hand. Not every Wizard had to know they were together.
get busy with her."
"Nothing?" Ron asked again.
"What?", Draco asked and looked up.
"It's not funny, asshole.", Harry said.
But there was no need for that. Malfoy shoved Harry away. He wiped his puffy lips with his hand and took a step back into the bathroom. "What-" he breathed hardly, "What are you thinking?"
He went down to the lake, which was nearly frozen. Harry sat down on a stump and watched the small snow flakes falling down to the cold ground. Harry sighed.
"Merlin's beard, are you so stupid? I didn't want to eat without you!", Draco answered angrily.
"Are you really the son of Narcissa?", Kreacher asked and Draco nodded.
Malfoy looked up and a sad smile hushed over his lips. "I thought I'd try."
Seems reasonable, Harry thought.
"I wanted this. Of course I did.", Potter said and pressed a quick kiss to Draco's lips and smiled apologetically.
He couldn't believe Theo actually wanted to go to Flourish and Blotts later. The hottest place anyone on Diagon Alley could go to was a bookstore. But Draco had been too hot to argue, so he'd agreed.
?", Vernon asked.
"Oh my god," Malfoy said and rolled his eyes, "Do I have to narrate or something?"
Draco wasn't back. Harry wasn't sure if he was going to cry again or if all his tears were shed. He closed his eyes, but couldn't sleep. Without the calm breathing of Draco, Harry couldn't realxe.
The rain had passed as Harry, Ron and Hermione drove to King's Cross the next morning and Harry felt a fluttering sensation in his stomach. It has been too long since he had been on the Hogwarts Express. Ron and Harry have asked specifically to ride the train, because they were getting sentimental. Hermione and her trunk and cat went first through the wall, Ron and Harry followed. Platform 9¾ was usually crowded with loads and loads of students and their parents and a lot of familiar faces.
Harry swallowed. It was nor easy for him to tell Draco this, but they had shared so much. They spoke about their past and the war and everything and Harry needed Draco to know it.
"Why are you being nice?" Harry asked through narrowed eyes.
Potter tasted like sweets, and his tongue slid so sensually against Draco's, it was impossible not to melt into the kiss. Draco's hands flew to Potter's waist, desperate for support, because he was beginning to feel dizzy. He tilted his head sideways, pressing his cheek into Potter's warm palm, and opened his mouth fully, welcoming Potter's intrusion by sucking gently on his tongue.
"Dad says it was a hell of a mess." Ron said, "Lucius would have gotten twenty years at Azkaban, but apparently his heart suddenly stopped beating."
, the beloved boy. Everyone had known his story when he was only a child and now even more people knew his story when he was eighteen. It was so unfair.
"Draco, come on out!" Blaise said after knocking on Draco's door for about the hundredth time.
"Don't you think it's weird?" Draco asked.
Harry thought. The common room was empty and Harry assumed that everyone else was in the Great Hall or outside while the weather was still dry. Suddenly, Harry and Neville heard a loud noise. Seconds later Ron stormed into the common room and let himself fall down on the couch between his friends. Harry looked at him. He had seen Ron like this only once before - when they had been in the forest and Ron had thought Harry and Hermione had a thing for each other.
"Let's get something to drink." Malfoy said, oblivious to Harry's fonding.
"Don't worry about me. I'll just go and pretend that I don't exist so you can talk shit about me," he said and left for his room.
"I know mother has gone crazy in the war and I can't understand how she thought being in contact with Potter was acceptable. I would never disgrace you or our family. When the Daily Prophet reaches out to me, I will tell them the whole truth: how I hate Potter as much as ever and I don't want anything to do with him if I don't have to. But maybe I might find out something valuable you would want to know."
Malfoy pulled the door open and said loudly, "Stop banging against the door!"
"I can't."
"You are, Draco. And Mr Malfoy, I don't want you to love me, I just want you to accept me. And if you can not accept me, accept your son. Accept him like he is and let him be how, who or with whom he likes. Because I think you love your son.", Potter said.
"Weasel, Weasel.", Draco stopped him.
Harry was still shaking his head when he entered Hogwarts. He had to find Neville! Harry walked through the Great Hall, looking left and right, searching for Neville's face. But Harry couldn't find him there, and he couldn't find him in the common room. Harry made his way to Neville's dorm and knocked on the door.
"I know it's weird for you being back here." He said.
"So...", Granger said and rubbed her palms together. Draco saw that she was pretty uncomfortable with the situation and he smirked. Mission accomplished.
Potter froze.
"I don't know!" Malfoy shouted back and looked angry "You prick what have you done to me? What potion have you slipped me?"
"Where are the others?"
"Malfoy.", he said and nodded. Draco nodded back.
Harry nodded and went to his room. They both went into their bathrooms and took a hot shower.
"Me?" Malfoy asked and Harry opened his eyes again.
Harry looked at Ron.
Harry looked over to the Slytherin table, where only a few students were sitting. Most of the Slytherins didn't come back to Hogwarts because of what had happened in the war. Harry searched for a familiar face, but he spotted him nowhere.
"Malfoy? Are you bloody serious right now? This git?", Ron asked and Parvati shifted uncomfortable in her chair.
A few seconds later Harry found himself in front of a nice house. Malfoy and his mother were already waiting by the door.
Draco looked at him, then at his hands, which were laying on his chest. Draco felt Potter's palms getting warm and he felt his magic flooding through him. He eyed the other boy carefully. Potter bit his lip concentrated. Draco smiled.
Malfoy just nodded slowly. Harry was kind of proud that Malfoy didn't start to shout or insult Ron as he normally would have done. Ron looked from Malfoy to Harry to Hermione and back to Malfoy. Harry felt that Malfoy was holding Harry's hand tighter than before.
"That's really ridiculous." Ron said and showed Harry the article he'd just read, "Who was the person who blabbed?"
Harry couldn't hold it anymore and came into his boxer shorts. Only a few seconds later, Draco came in his own. He sunk down on Harry, kissing his chest.
"Yeah. Some minutes later, we entered the Entrance Hall and I suspect you remember the rest." Potter nodded smiling and kissed Draco.
"Not long." Ron answered and held his forehead.
"This isn't a good memory. I tried to get you killed," Draco said self-loathing.
"Harry, I'm not sure about this," Hermione said and nervously looked towards the bathroom door.
"Empty cage?" Malfoy said before he even said hello.
"Of course I did. But do you really expect me to beg for me to sit next to him? I just wanted to be nice. I always just want to be nice but sometimes I think it all just crashes against a wall," Potter said, seemingly hurt, "And he doesn't want me to be nice to him. It's hard enough not to punch him in the face when he's talking to me like that, but to stay nice... I'm not even starting with how hard this could be."
"Don't worry. I'm a bottom," Potter said.
Malfoy shook his head again.
On Christmas Eve, Harry, Ron and Hermione took the Floo Powder to the Granger house. It was a very neat house (dentists...) and a lot of pictures of Hermione and her family, but also of her with Ron and Herry were sitting on the mantelpiece. Harry liked this place - it was quite the opposite from the Burrow, but it was nice. Hermione seemed very happy to spend yet another Christmas with her parents, considering the incidents last year.
"Well... When the Dark Lord and my aunt lived with us, it was a very hard time for me. I thought that I would be a disappointment for my family and in sixth year, I got this job to do... I didn't want to do it. I was feared. And fear made me do things I didn't want to do. The night on the Astronomy Tower... I didn't want to kill him. Really, Harry, I didn't want to do it. I lowered my wand! I really did! It was... I didn't want to be a coward anymore. All I wanted was to make my father proud. If I hadn't killed him, I mean Dumbledore, the Dark Lord would have killed me! I didn't eant to do it. Believe me, please, I-", tears streamed down Draco's face.
"Welcome to the family," Luna said in her dreamy voice and smiled. Harry laughed when he saw Malfoy forcing a smile as well. Neville clapped Malfoy on the shoulder and wished the two of them a happy reunion. Malfoy thanked him, what threw Neville a bit off track, but he smiled and left the hospital wing with his girlfriend.
Draco lay in bed staring at the light coming from his window. Pansy had left only a few hours ago and Draco hoped she wouldn't come back any time soon.He needed to talk to Theo and he was going to do it tomorrow. Today he was too tired to do anything.
"Now, let me help you.", he said. Draco narrowed his eyes.
Harry shook his head. From where did he know what Malfoy smelled like? God, what was wrong with him?
"This is a nightmare, Hermione!" Harry said after the feast, "I can't live with him. Not for a minute and especially not for a whole year!"
Harry didn't keep asking, he just sat down silently at a table. Malfoy sat down opposite of Harry. A tired-looking woman came to their table to take their orders.
Finally Draco admitted he maybe didn't remember
"Shut up, it's romantic.", Harry replied.
Harry held his elbow out to Malfoy, but he just rolled his eyes. Harry furrowed his brow, unsure of what was going on.
?" He asked.
"I'm sorry?" Malfoy said confused.
"I promise I will keep him safe whenever you can't. And I promise I won't let anyone hurt him in any way." Harry said.
"Are you... do you...?" Malfoy stammered.
"In act?"
"Today at lunch, we talked about the Tournament and that he was sure that you'd win.", Zabini continued.
Harry frowned. That kind of sounded… as if this was Harry's idea in the first place. As if Draco had been doing him a favour. But, then, actually—
Why was he freaking out anyways?
Draco shook his head.
Harry was glad that Ron and Hermione consciously avoided asking about what had happened at Hogsmeade. Instead they talked about upcoming exams and lessons. But Harry couldn't get his mind off Malfoy. What was going on?
"What?", he snapped, "Now you're bored enough to talk to me?" Harry's brow furrowed.
She let go of Harry, who then hugged Ron shortly.
He repeated the action, his hands sliding that bit higher, and fingers reached up to thread into his hair, gripping gently as if Harry were trying to ground himself, stop himself floating away.
Harry was thrilled, of course, but irritated as well. He decided to overlook the weirdness of this event and focus on the fact that Teddy was here. Teddy didn't have much of the evening, though. Hermione convinced Harry that Teddy had to go straight to bed after dinner or he would be too tired to watch the fireworks. With three hours left until midnight, they set up their tents in the field, making a circle around the big bonfire. Harry was sad that Hagrid couldn't be there - he would have liked for him to see this.
"May I present you, my parents. Lily Evans Potter and James Potter.", Potter said and smiled at Draco.
"Draco, are you alright?", he asked and laughed as Draco stopped in front of a TV shop and pressed his nose against the window.
He ignored Draco completely, what was totally in his liking. Potter piled his books on the table and started doing his homework. Draco sat down on his bed and read a Quidditch magazine. It was strange that the two boys could be in one room without fighting, insulting or something.
? They never talked about a term for their relationship.
walked out on
Without waiting for another response, Draco grabbed Potter's wrist and pulled him away from the rest of the group.
"You're mad."
"Yeah, well..." Malfoy shrugged.
"W- well equipped, Potter.", he stammered, not looking away from Harry's own prick.
Harry saw Malfoy looking up excitedly. He couldn't answer this question! If he would say yes, they would never stop asking who it was. And if he would lie and say no he could hurt Malfoy. So Harry grabbed the bottle of Vodka the two entertainers had prepared. He opened it and took a big sip. The crowd cheered again and even Ron started clapping and laughing.
"And you must be Vernon. Ah, Harry has told me so much about you.", Draco said, turning to Harry's uncle.
Everyone stared at him, then at Harry, then back at Malfoy. "What in heaven's name is going on?" Ron asked.
Malfoy didn't say anything, he just looked at Harry, blinking slowly. Harry realised that Malfoy's lashes were absolutely stunning. Despite his hair being silver, his lashes were dark, just like his eyebrows. Harry guessed it were Narcissa's genes.
"Good morning Miss Williams." Harry said. Miss Williams was one of those regulars. She was a middle-aged lady with frizzy brown hair and a bright smile. Her husband had passed away a few years ago and she lived not far from where Harry lived. Sometimes they accidentally met on their way to the store and walked together.
"Let. Go." Ron said and pulled away his arm, causing Malfoy to fall over.
"Everthring alright?", he asked worried.
Harry thought with a slight smile.
"Oh god you behave like little children," Hermione said annoyed and rolled her eyes.
Harry couldn't believe what he just read. He felt tears streaming into his eyes, but he tried to hold them back and kept reading.
are not allowed to sleep in one room.", Pansy daid and snickered.
Draco shook his head. "Potter's."
"Not bad." Malfoy said looking around.
"Because you are alone. You have no one here, apart from me. And because I can't stand it ehen someone does something to you, harms you, fools you, laughs at you or does anything else that you don't like.", he said. Now, Draco couldn't hold back a smile.
"I love you, scarhead.", Draco answered.
As he walked away, Harry thought, it was even more odd, that he didn't care as much as he thought he would. Something inside him wasn't working right. Why wasn't he disappointed that Cho was already going with someone else?
Draco hated them for pretending that it was easy to hold hands with the person they love when it was not for him and Potter.
awkward. But the fact that Harry laughed seemed to ease Malfoy up, because he put the glass down and didn't go back to rubbing his knees. Harry looked around the room, trying to figure out what they could do.
"Ron, I'm sorry. I know you don't like him and out of coincidence I know that he doesn't like you. But will you two please forget about that for a second? Because I'm really badly in love with him, Ron."
Harry wanted to go, but Draco grabbed his waist.
Harry furrowed his brow. What was going on in there? Did they know he was awake and wanted to fool him? Were they really getting along? If they were - and Harry hoped so - it would be best they didn't know Harry knew about this. Smiling, he sneaked back upstairs and crawled back into bed.
Harry turned back around. "You're an idiot." He said and walked back towards Malfoy.
"What is going on?" Potter asked, but Draco just kissed him. Really hard. And really long.
"No, he's not, Ron. I've already explained it to you. Some children start to walk at the age of one. And how old is Teddy? Right. One." Hermione said annoyed.
"Alright, I'll tell you.", he said and rolled his eyes again. Potter grinned.
Hermione and Ron both looked at him.
Harry turned his head. "Where to?"
Malfoy slowly shook his head, but didn't say anything. Harry's eyes rushed over Malfoy's face, trying to take in everything they could get. He couldn't see if Malfoy was crying or if it was the rain rolling down his face, but Harry knew Malfoy was sad and he finally showed it. Harry didn't want to do anything wrong this time. He felt his clothes getting soaked and sticking to his skin and wondered what they were going to do about this.
Harry woke up and looked around. His room was dark but he knew by heart where everything was, so Harry got up and slowly manoeuvred his way between his potions table and bike towards the door. He sneaked over to the room down the hall, opened the door and stepped inside. Harry got in bed next to his godfather and slipped under the blanket.
"I do." Harry said , even though he couldn't see the point of arguing right now, " I just wanted to pick something up."
He jumped up. Why had he not thought if that earlier? Harry ran up to his room and stormed to his trunk. He searched it through and pulled out a map. He tapped it with his wand and said:
I had left.", Potter said with his shaking voice. Draco sighed. Potter looked at him.
"You have to leave," Draco whispered and winced at his words.
"I say we'll sleep.", Harry suggested and Draco nodded.
Headmistress Minerva McGonnagal had decided to put two students from different houses together and, of course, how could it be different, Harry had to share a room with Malfoy. Out of all students, he had to live with
Draco didn't hesitate, but leaned forwards and reached for Potter, letting his hand run along his waist, feeling for the shape of his body through the thick folds of his cloak. Potter's lips parted, and Draco held his breath.
"I'm exhausted," Harry said. Malfoy nodded and wanted to get up, but Harry didn't let go of his thigh. "Draco," Harry said quietly. Malfoy's eyes widened, he blushed and stared at Harry.
"Draco.", Harry breathed and now he let Draco kiss him.
"Father.", Draco said coldly.
"Thanks," he said absently while staring at the letter.
Harry only scoffed. He didn't know if he was more sad or angry or just plainly disappointed.
"You know, he lived at the Manor.
Malfoy left the Hall quite early, Harry noticed. But he decided to ignore the Slytherin boy and he kept eating. After Harry, Hermione and Ron had finished, they stood up and left the Great Hall as well.
"Did you say something? I mean,
"Dumbledore is sitting right here, Hermione and Ron are outraged enough and I don't think the minister wants to see this.", Harry said.
Mrs Granger smiled. "Oh, sure, how nice."
"Let's see what the day might bring."
"See you later, idiot.", Draco said.
"Still, my parents would never approve," he said.
"Malfoy, wait!", he said again and caught up with him at last.
"Oh, I wasn't intending to tell you but then I saw you sitting here and I just had to ask."
"This is not about who is capable of what. Miss Granger, I am sorry but only the roommate, who is in this case Mr. Malfoy, has the ability of seeing Potter in the mornings and at night. Unless you all decide to
"Seriously, Malfoy. It's not your fault. We never talk about it, so..." Ron said.
"Goodnight, Mr Potter." She said.
"There are so many things I would like to tell that abnormally disgusting little rat!" Ron almost shouted.
? What was wrong with him? They both stayed silent and Draco dressed himself.
Without touching his cock, Draco slid the zipper of Potter's jeans down. In a graceful motion, Draco dropped to the floor on his knees and without hesitation drew Potter's prick deep into his mouth, sucking it all the way until his nose nuzzled dark hair. Potter groaned and the table squealed at Potter's movement.
Harry smiled and sat down on the chair Dumbledore used to sit on when he heard footsteps coming up the stone stairs that led to the office. A young student Harry didn't know knocked shyly on the opened door and Harry waved her inside. The girl say down on the chair across from Harry and took a deep breath. Harry could see how nervous she was.
The two boys joined her at the table and started eating breakfast. It was quite awkward, no one dared to talk and Harry noticed Narcissa's eyes darting between him and Draco. She even managed to sneer at Harry. Grinning to himself, Harry ate a piece of cantaloupe and decided to enjoy the summer sun while he could.
"Mom.", he said, "I think he's fine. He's with this stupid Weasley girl and he's happy with her."
"Now piss off!"
"Come." He said over his shoulder, "I need air."
"Honestly, Draco.", Zabini spat, "This is low, even for you."
"I'm fine.", he said.
"Yes, I do! I do want you! Every minute, every second of my life!", Potter answered.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Shut up, Potter."
"Harry.", Draco whispered again, sounding troubled.
"Get a room, you two!" Dean mocked.
"You don't have to pretend that you don't exist." Potter said and Draco only rolled his eyes.
Harry shook his head and a smile broke out on his lips.
"Harry...", Granger called after them, but they ignored her.
Harry looked at him with a confused look, but got up too and followed Malfoy who still held on to Harry's wrist and pulled the terrace doors open and pulled Harry outside where it has started to rain even more now. The air was chilly and refreshing and Harry took a deep breath. To his surprise, Malfoy pulled him even further, away from the sunblind shielding the terrace and out into the rain.
Everyone cheered and clapped and Harry figured that must have been enough, but as he turned around he saw McGonagall  shaking her head. Harry sighed. If he was going to do this, he was going to do this right.
Draco looked at him confused. "Why exactly am I adorable?"
"Stop exaggerating!" Draco shouted.
"Sorry Potter, I have to get up and get ready," Malfoy said.
The train would leave in ten minutes. Potter had promised his friends that he was going to bring them to the station.
Harry smiled gently. "I'm sorry," he said softly.
Draco shrugged. "I guess."
"This ceremony is a symbol of how far you have come these past years. It is a symbol for the promises you will make to each other to continue growing stronger as individuals and as partners. No matter what challenges you face, you now face them together."
"I... I'm sorry.", Harry said. He felt shame rising up inside him because he hadn't taken that much of time. Draco let out a small laugh.
"I like it like this.", he breathed against his neck and hissed him there. Draco laughed.
Harry laughed. He folded the letter and put it in his bag when Draco came back.
"Have you found him?", Ron asked.
"Do you want some tea?" Harry asked quietly and Malfoy nodded.
"Stop showering so long!" Harry shouted.
"Every time you feel uncomfortable you insult people and start being mean," Harry observed and was pleased with himself when he found Malfoy actually nodding slowly. "You really don't have to feel uncomfortable with me. I am so sorry if I made you feel like you were just some other guy for sex. You're not. I haven't exactly found out
"These electrical signals now control the electron beam, which emits the fluorescent layer on the image tube and reflects the brightness values of the scenes recorded by the camera. The picture actually appears in tens of small flashing spots. Since our eye is sluggish and can not follow this speed, it takes the picture only as a whole and sees for example the football match in the stadium.", the man finished. Draco nodded a third time, then turned to Harry.
Potter's chest was bare, and he closed his eyes and moaned as Draco's fingers skimmed over his stomach.
"Why?" Ron asked with a confused look, what changed into a horrified one very quickly, "Is it some kind of anniversary today? Did I forget about something?"
Seamus groaned.
Harry and Draco lay in Harry's bed, facing each other and waiting for the bells to stop. As they did, Harry looked into the wonderful grey eyes of Draco.
God, he wanted to hear him. Potter gripped Draco's own cock and jeked it in his hand.
Ron raised an eyebrow. "Going on?" He asked, "Like, philosophically?"
here," Harry said, "but that was hours ago.
The ring he put on Harry's finger looked the same, only instead of a ruby there was a big emerald and it was the name
"What is your goal, scarhead?" Draco broke him off.
"Yes!" Ron said enthusiastically, "That's it. With the trousers you already have in the dressing room."
Draco shot Cedric a dark look before he walked away. Harry looked after him, confused.
"Hermione, drop it.", Harry said annoyed.
"Does your parents know about us?", Potter asked. Draco froze.
He jumped on his bed, crossed his legs and looked at Potter. Draco didn't say anything. Potter didn't say anything. They just looked at each other. Draco was looking at Potters shining green eyes behind those stupid round glasses. And Potter was looking at Draco's grey eyes. Potter licked his lips.
"I am.", Harry croaked.
"Oh my god! Oh my god!", Draco said. He was out of the bed faster than Harry could say "Quidditch" and pulled on his pyjama quickly. Harry smiled satisfied.
"Of course I care! Why do you think I slept in front of the bloody hospital doors two nights in a row just to be the first see him? Why do you think did I brought food up there in case he will wake up? Ah, right! I'm Draco Malfoy, I have no feelings and things as love and friendship are nkt in my vocabulary! But should I tell you something? You lot are not better! You don't know me! You know nothing about me! So leave me alone! And if you would really love your best friend, accept his love for me, you stupid bastard!", Draco shouted and turned around to leave.
"Mister Potter! Be quiet!", Madame Pince hissed.
Draco grinned and opened the door of the cupboard. He took a hold of Harry's hand and dragged him along the corridor.
Also he wasn't welcome at
"So what? Leave me alone.", said Harry and rolled his eyes.
Ron blurted out a laugh, but Harry glared at him and he fell silent. Harry kept feeding Teddy, but listened attentive.
?! His room was so much better than Harry's was. Harry stepped outside and a warm wind blew through his hair. The grounds of Malfoy Manor looked so beautiful in the summer sun. Harry felt two arms closing around his torso and Draco's chin lay on his shoulder.
Harry looked from Malfoy to Teddy and back to Malfoy, thinking hard for a moment. Then Harry smiled. "I love you too."
"Morning, Potty.", he answered and kissed Potter. Draco laughed.
"So." Hermione said rubbing her hands, "Dig in."
"Draco." His mother said and gently placed her hand on his. "You are the man of Malfoy Manor now."
As the evening went on and on, everyone was having so much fun. Harry excused himself from a conversation with Hagrid and Madame Pomfrey and went to the stage. He tapped against the microphone and cleared his throat. When everyone quieted down and looked at him, Harry grinned nervously. A spotlight fell on Draco, who looked around surprised.
Harry laughed quietly.
Pansy laughed her evil and dirty laugh, that was so Slytherin it was almost like Draco's, but of course Draco didn't laugh very often.
"You know what I want to do now?", Draco asked.
Hermione appeared behind him. "When are you coming back?"
This made Harry's hands shake.
"You had a mass murderer as godfather?", Malfoy asked in disbelief. Harry nodded and sniffed.
"I wouldn't try him.", Harry said smirking.
"Goodnight, Mister Malfoy."
Harry bit his lip uncertainly. Sam and Seamus weren't even paying attention. In the time Harry had gotten changed, Seamus had started talking to Sam and wrapped him around his finger. Harry and Ron snickered quietly.
Getting back downstairs, Hermione had already bewitched the kitchen utensils to cook Harry's favourite food, while Ron prepared a stack of DVDs to watch. Harry smiled. He loved his friends so much, it was unbelievable. Harry wanted to help Hermione, but she insisted that he sat down and relaxed.
"We had Harry Potter in an interview and he told us his plans for the future. "I will go back to Hogwarts for my eighth year and finish my N.E.W.T.s, just like my best friend Hermione Granger wants me to." he told us with a smile. "Do you have any specific plans what you are going to do after your time at Hogwarts?" we asked and he nodded. He already started training for being an Auror, what had always been his dream and we are sure he will be a good one."
"GET! OUT!" Malfoy shouted even louder, so loud that Harry thought his friends in the common room must have heard it.
So was Draco. He put down the paper for a second before he continued reading. How did Potter know about this? Not even Draco knew this.
The Christmas holidays began on Saturday the following week. Harry, Ron, Draco, Luna and Seamus stood on Platform 9 ¾ and waited impatiently for the Hogwarts Express to arrive. When it did, the Platform was immediately filled with people, the large majority of them younger than the five friends. Harry spotted Hermione coming out of the train and waved her. Immediately, a lot of people whispered his name and formed a party for Hermione. She hugged Ron tightly and gave him a kiss. Then she hugged the others - even Malfoy. Neville stumbled towards them and hugged Luna, then the others, and shook Draco's hand. It was the same with Dean and Ginny.
Only a few people raised their hands, the others were either scared of Potter or really agreed with what he had said. Then the minister spoke.
Harry rolled around in bed. He knew it was time to get up, but he just couldn't make himself move. Hermione had been in his room three times already, saying they wanted to have breakfast. Harry had told her to start without him. Now his stomach was rumbling and he decided to get over himself and got up.
He was afraid of the answer - afraid Malfoy would say
first?", Seamus asked. Harry rolled his eyes and answered.
Harry watched Goyle dance and felt sad. He knew what it felt like to loose someone important in your life.
"Night." Harry heard Ron whisper through the hallway.
"Ok so let's go."
"Oh, you want to know why.", Potter answered nodding. He sat down on his bed.
"Well, Draco picked it out.", Harry answered shrugging.
"Draco will show up here more often and I want you not to disturb us." Kreacher nodded.
There was silence. Neither Ron nor Hermione knew what to say. Obviously the memories weren't fond oned for them either, so hearing about this must be really hard for them too. Harry felt a tear rolling down his face thinking about the words he was about to say next.
"Come on." Harry begged, "We don't have anything to do now, we can just go to Eeylops Owl Emporium and buy one."
"Mione and I are going to visit her parents for a couple of days and my family for the rest of the holiday," Ron said.
Theo rolled his eyes, but kept leaning over and wated to see who it was from.
Ron shoved Harry into the kitchen so he would let Teddy and Malfoy alone. Harry watched them out of the corner of his eyes while he half-heartedly put water in a pot. Malfoy snuggled up with a tired Teddy on the carpet in front of the fireplace. They played little games and Draco entertained Teddy with a round of peekaboo as Teddy's hair turned silvery-white. Harry felt his heart jump. Draco actually tried getting along with Teddy and it looked more and more like they were becoming a little family - Harry, Draco, Ron, Hermione and Teddy.
"So when are your idiots leaving?" Malfoy asked, filling his lungs with smoke and blowing it back out.
"What... what should be with him?", he asked and why was he so nervous?
Malfoy blinked. Harry stared at him, wondering what would happen next. Would he say something? What would he say? Would he just walk out? And why? Would he punch someone? No, he wouldn't do that. What if he would?
Draco ordered another lemonade and then he realized something: The last time they had sat here and talked, they had both been drinking alcohol and Draco had thought this was the reason they were getting along just fine. But now neither of them had had any alcohol - that Draco knew of - and they were getting along anyways. So maybe the alcohol was either just an easier way to start talking, or it was never a factor at all.
It was now a day before Potter's birthday and Draco hadn't written him since the incident. Draco just had no idea what to say and it seemed neither did Potter, because Draco hadn't heard from him either. He rolled around in his bed, burying his face into his pillow and sighed. How did it come to this? Why was he being so whiny? Draco took a vague guess that maybe he cherished Potter's friendship more than he'd thought. But was it a friendship? They met a few times, that was it. But on the other hand they'd talked for hours in the diner and Draco didn't even think about being bored. Draco had decided he would stay in his room until he found what bothered him so much.
"We are gathered here today to celebrate the special love that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy share." The headmistress said.
The meeting had been quick, Harry and Ron knew the new Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt, as he had been a member of the Order of the Phoenix. Even though neither Ron nor Harry had taken their N.E.W.T.s, he assured them they could start becoming an Auror right away.
