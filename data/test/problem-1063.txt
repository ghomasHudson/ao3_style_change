- As a matter of fact, I was trying to save your sorry ass. You don’t remember lying here for almost 3 hours now, barely conscious?
- How would you know? I told you what I wanted, it was all the information you had. You had no way of knowing my intentions. I’m not sure I even knew them. It was just what felt right in that moment. And besides, if I was ever going to be ready, it was that night. I felt good, I was on a high from what we did before and if anything, waiting wouldn’t have made me more prepared for this. The only thing waiting would accomplish was getting rid of that high and then I would be less ready if that makes sense.
‘I don’t know, I don’t remember. It wasn’t important enough.’ That was a blatant lie and Harry was just hoping that nobody would catch on.
Harry couldn’t look at the scene. He looked at Draco standing next to him and saw him biting his lip, holding back tears. He unlaced their fingers, wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him close – he didn’t even fight it, holding on to Harry tightly, burying his face in the crook of his neck. ‘It’s ok, you’re safe now, it’s just a memory…’ Harry whispered, gently running his fingers through the blonde hair ‘…he can’t hurt you anymore, he’s dead… I’m here, you’re safe… It’s all fine now, I’ll stay with you, I’ll keep you safe…’.
- It’s Potter. – His friends exchanged knowing looks. – He took some self-made concoction of potions and right now I’m not sure how he’s still alive after what he drank. I need one of you to go find Slughorn, give him the list of what Potter ingested and ask him to come up with something to help. I can’t do it on my own, obviously, and if he dies, as he will if we just leave him there, I’m going to get blamed for it.
- No, it’s not that. It’s what you said about them knowing who you are. I just never realized until now that we hadn’t talked about past relationships…
‘Well, you don’t need to use it by yourself. You can have a cleaning person and they would use it in your house.’
‘Oh, don’t be so dramatic, mother, it was…’ But suddenly Draco fell silent, whitening while looking at the cobblestone street. Harry followed his gaze.
‘Well, hello, Potter. I heard you thought I’ve offed myself after our little encounter last year, so here I am.’
‘And that is exactly why we’re taking you under our wing, dear!’ Molly exclaimed. ‘You seem like you could use some warmth, if you’ll forgive my expression. Now, I don’t know what you’ve been fed with so far, but you’re starting to look thinner than Harry and we cannot let you go on like that!’ Everyone laughed. Harry sent an
‘Um, well…’ Draco was suddenly looking at his hands. ‘I had an idea, but ever since father…’ he looked really lost for a moment. ‘…ever since father’s letter I don’t know if it’s even possible.’
‘I don’t know, haven’t checked yet.’ He glanced at the Muggle alarm clock on the nightstand. ‘6:30. What time are we supposed to be in the office anyway?’
By now Harry’s brain was as far from potions as possible. He didn’t even read the instructions before reaching for a vile of armadillo bile to add it to the cauldron, when a firm hand on his arm stopped him. He looked to the side. Draco was keeping his arm firmly in place.
‘Oh, so you’re moving in together? Fantastic!’ Ginny seemed genuinely happy for them. ‘Where will you be living? I’m expecting a house warming bash and if there’s no invitation for me we’re going to have a serious problem, boys…’
- I’m trying to restrain myself, believe me. Years of indoctrinated hatred towards your incautious lot don’t let go that easily.
As such, Monday morning Harry decided he had to muster enough courage to talk to Ron. He got ready as quickly as possible and knocked on his ex-best friend’s bedroom door before he even got a chance to say hello to Draco. Neville opened the door.
With his mind mostly at ease about this, Harry started to think more and more about the physical aspect of his relationship with Draco. He knew Draco said they were going to take things slowly and Harry was grateful for it, but some part of him was starting to wonder if Draco wouldn’t loose interest in him. After all, it was December, they’ve been together for three months now, and so far they’ve only gone as far as kissing. He was mauling this over for a couple of days before deciding he needed to broach the subject himself – he figured Draco was probably waiting for him to do that. So one Friday evening, two weeks before Christmas, Harry decided to take action.
- I can take care of myself, trust me. I’ll be fine. I just need some pointers on how to get started.
‘This is exactly why I came here myself, Mr. Longbottom. This is very serious business, whatever is inside of that room can potentially be fatal, and without Mr. Malfoy’s help the risks are even bigger. But we do need to determine if we can trust you.’
‘I think, Harry’ Narcissa interjected ‘that if there was someone to be considered a perfect candidate for an Auror, it’s you. You’ve proven time and time again that you have both skills and determination for it.’
‘The case! Ron found the snatchers, they’re going to be interrogated today!’ Suddenly, he noticed Draco turned completely white. ‘What’s wrong?’
20 minutes later, Draco was almost done retelling the whole story of how him and Harry cracked the case and how Harry came to a conclusion that Draco wasn’t in fact a part of the ring, when he glanced at Weasley and his heart nearly stopped. He knew he was in trouble the second he saw Ron’s face twist into something that might at some point have been a smile, but it was too full of disgust and hatred to be classified as such. Barely scrambling any coherent thought he finished his testimony and tried to brace himself for what would inevitably be an attack from Weasley.
It was already past midnight when Harry and Draco finally left the Auror Office. They had been going over Lucius’ information and setting a plan in place for a couple of hours, together with Kingsley, Ron and Neville, and, having finally established that the four Office employees would visit the Manor the following evening, after dark, all Draco and Harry had the energy to do was to apparate straight back to Harry’s apartment and collapse on his bed.
- Yea-Yeah, I did. – Harry was desperately trying to go back to his original train of thought after those revelations. – It just never occurred to me that you should know that… - He swallowed. – That you’re my first boyfriend. First serious relationship in fact.
Side note: bonus points for anyone who understands where I got the 'infinitely worth saving' quote from (and while I'm at it - I realized, after writing this chapter, that even if we disregard the 'wizards knowing muggle tv quotes' issue, the timeline doesn't exactly add up, but it fit so perfectly there that I decided to leave it in. Sorry if it bothers you, I'll try and be better with any future references!)
- “Someone”, not “something”, Draco. – He looked at the Slytherin with a small smile. – I didn’t know how much exactly you blamed yourself for all of this. I thought you just felt bad for hurting me with… well, at the end. I never knew you felt guilty for the whole thing. You shouldn’t. I told you I wanted this and that’s why we did this. If you forced me to do this it would be a completely different story, but you acted on what I said I wanted.
‘You guys are overreacting. There has to be a Chief, it’s in the bylaws. And Kingsley will never give this job to Lucius. Just give it some time.’
Several hours later Harry was still uneasy. Draco’s behaviour during Potions terrified him, and the fact that after all of it went down he seemed unbothered enough to return to his cauldron like nothing happened didn’t do anything to aid the situation. They didn’t speak since that one order to stay back Draco barked at Harry back in the dungeons and now during dinner they were each sitting at their own house tables not looking at each other. Harry was jabbing his peas absentmindedly when Dean plopped down next to him.
- So you say, I would like to give someone full control over my life? – Harry didn’t seem convinced.
- I’m not sure I do actually… - Harry was now just as abashed now as Nott was. – You mean you’re not gay?
- You need to get out of this rut you’ve been in, Draco. – Nott said, handing his friend a bottle of Firewhisky.
It took Draco a few days to come up with a plan on how to find out if he’s been outed by Potter. One Monday morning he waited for Mina to go to sleep and reached for his wand. He became quite good at self-transfiguration, and even if his best work was out of the question, he could still make himself look different enough for the people in Diagon Alley to not recognize him. He gave himself some muscles, facial hair and long, black ponytail and made his way to the Leaky Cauldron.
- I cannot fucking believe you right now. – Harry was somewhere between utter disbelief and frustration – That was cold, even for someone like you.
Draco decided that he needed to be honest with himself for once. There was no need to keep up appearances in his own head – nobody was exactly there to probe around in his thoughts anymore, not with Bellatrix dead and his father in Azkaban (he really should be more upset by the fact that he probably won’t see Lucius ever again, but somehow it didn’t bother him – his mother got out on the virtue of saving Harry Potter in the Forbidden Forest and that was all that mattered. He had all he wanted.), so what was the point in burying all he truly felt somewhere deep?
Longbottom came here to commit suicide because he was so ashamed of falling in love with your ex-girlfriend he couldn’t live with himself. Or was it Weasley that killed him? He was the one to find the body in the first place, so maybe he didn’t
Once again, Harry found his fiancée’s confusion thoroughly amusing. He briefly explained what Underground was and after getting an enthusiastic reaction from Narcissa (she was turning into a bit of a train aficionado at this point, Harry thought) they made their way towards the stop. It didn’t go entirely smoothly, however, because Draco had a little bit of a freak-out in the middle of the escalator ride and Harry had to assure him it was completely normal for the stairs to move that way and they were not going to be swallowed by the gap at the top where the steps disappeared. What proved to be even more of a challenge, was a ticket machine, with both Draco and Narcissa refusing to believe that there wasn’t, in fact, a tiny person inside whose job would be to hand the tickets to the customer and who would spend their day laughing at people struggling to purchase one. Completely exhausted, Harry decided they needed a couple of minutes before they would actually get onto the subway car, so he dragged them into a little store to get something to drink. He got a can of coke, a bottle of water and some weird grape soda in an alarming shade of toxic purple, and they all sat on a bench to regain some composure. It turned out that even though wizards had their own beverages, it seemed like Draco was quickly turning into a fan of coke (his mother however, stayed on the safe side and stuck to water, proclaiming that both of the fizzy drinks were ‘too frightening’).
However long it took him to find Harry, it was too much wasted time for Draco. When he finally spotted him through an open door, he stopped dead in his tracks. The sight made his gut wrench – Harry laid on a bed, lifelessly, at least half a dozen healers hovering over him while Ron and Neville stood at the foot of the bed, their heads hung. The scene reminded Draco of a funeral. Seconds ticked away and he couldn’t move. He didn’t want to know how severe the situation was, he didn’t want to even think about the possibility that he might have lost his love for ever, let alone face it. Internally, he was screaming and crying, pleading with the universe to please just take him instead, but on the outside, he just stood there, rooted to the spot, like a Malfoy-shape statue. He vaguely registered one of the healers turning around to face the door and heard him say ‘Mr. Malfoy, what are you doing here?’, but he couldn’t respond. It was Ron shaking him by his shoulders that finally caused him to move. Everything was a blur, everything looked and sounded like it was muffled by a thick layer of wool – mechanically, without tearing his eyes away from Harry, Draco walked towards him. Up close the sight was too much for him to bear – he collapsed to his knees, resting his head on Harry’s bed, just looking at the love of his life lying there lifeless and paler than the sheets around him.
With their education basically behind them, Draco turned his attention to the question of his future with Harry. He knew he couldn’t see them split again after they’ve left Hogwarts, but he was well aware that life outside the castle walls was going to be much different – somehow, while they were still in school, the word of and ex-Death Eater and The Boy Who Lived being an item didn’t get out, but Draco knew it was only a matter of time before it spread like wildfire as soon as they stepped foot off the grounds. And what was worse, his own parents didn’t know anything yet. Draco wasn’t particularly concerned with his father finding out – after all, he was in Azkaban for life, so how much could he possibly do about it? But his mother was exonerated and living in the Malfoy Manor, very much still a part of the wizarding community, albeit shunned to its outskirts. Draco knew he had to tell her before she would find out from some other source. One evening he sat down and wrote a lengthy letter detailing almost everything (he left out the part about their first night together and the subsequent fiasco with Theodore, she didn’t need to know about it, and him and Harry didn’t even consider this a part of their relationship history by now), asking Narcissa to try and understand that for the first time in his life he was truly happy and telling her that whatever her decision in the matter of supporting her son through this was going to be, he was set on keeping the relationship going. To his surprise, Narcissa wrote back almost immediately, her letter addressed to both Harry and Draco in fact, telling them how happy she was and inviting them to stay in the Manor as long as they wanted to while they figured out where they were going to go on.
‘I don’t know! He popped in from time to time to check on me. Maybe he just wanted to talk or something.’
Neither Harry nor Draco knew how it happened, but was already June and their last year at Hogwarts was nearing an end. They’ve been so wrapped up in their new relationship that they didn’t even notice how the months flew by and before they knew it, they were leaving the Great Hall after their last exam ever. It was still 2 weeks to actually leaving the castle for the last time, but they weren’t going to have classes anymore, just a couple of sessions of job counselling with the heads of houses while they were waiting for their test results.
‘That’s no way to talk to your supervisor, Mr. Malfoy. You’ll need to learn to behave.’ Harry was laughing.
- I do care about you still, you know? – Harry stepped into the room after Neville strategically retreated to the common room. – You don’t just throw 8 years of friendship out the window.
- What are you getting at? Voldemort is dead, there are no Death Eaters anymore. What does it matter what’s on Draco’s arm?
- We’ll get to that. – Draco realized he was too harsh, so he tried to soften his tone. It wasn’t easy for him to not be so icy in bed with someone, he wasn’t used to it. – There will be plenty of time for it baby. For now, let me take care of you. Do you want that?
‘That happened ten minutes ago, Potter. So you’ve been bi-curious for ten minutes and now all of a sudden you’re into me?’
- If you’re sure than let’s do this. – Draco smiled back. – But ONLY if you’re completely sure. And we’re stopping if anything feels uncomfortable. You can’t force yourself to do anything for my sake, do you understand?
‘Fine…’ Potter sighed, rolling his eyes ‘I suppose you might have a point. Not with me being stupid, obviously, but with the other thing.’
- Don’t be, it takes time, I know. But continue please, because I still don’t understand why was Granger crying.
‘Will you all stop with the accusations?! Is this going to go like that EVERY case?!’ Harry blew up. He couldn’t stand it anymore.
‘What’s there to talk about? I don’t have a kink, I told you twice already, I just like strong, masculine guys. You know, the ‘muscles and a rough exterior’ type.’
‘Draco…’ he was panting, but nothing, besides how the blonde made him feel, mattered anymore ‘…take me.’
‘No. For once I’m thinking clearly.’ No matter how much Draco threw up, he was still drunk, so he was in no state to stop himself from talking to Potter right now. ‘Tell me, Potter, what do I have to live for? I have nothing, I’ve been completely disgraced by what my parents did and then I took it further myself, becoming a Muggle whore…’
‘It’s not about drinking. I just realized that everyone is moving on and I’m stuck at home, so I started thinking that maybe it’s time to get back out into the world again…’
It was no use thinking about it, Harry decided – he made his peace with the fact that whatever he felt for the other man would go unfulfilled for the rest of his life, and tonight shouldn’t change anything. But it stung, like an iron bar in his lungs, to know that Draco didn’t even consider this. Because surely, if he felt even an ounce of what was inside of Harry, he wouldn’t just take up and leave like that, not just because Ron saw them. If he was ashamed of what he had done that meant that there was nothing besides Firewhisky and poor judgement that motivated him.
- Yeah, he’s like that. He’ll help you if you put the work in. You know, “teach a man to fish” kind of thing. – She smiled.
- Exactly. If there was no last will and no living wife, her father’s money would have been split 3 ways between his daughters, so a third of it would be your mother’s. And just as with the money she had before, your father has no right to any of it. But then, it’s a double-edge sword. – She saddened. – Because that same lack of agreement that lets your mother keep the money, means that the Manor is owned only by your father and he can do whatever he wants with it. Well, you could look into other laws, there might be something that prohibits evicting your own wife, but as for you, I think it’s a lost cause…
‘That won’t change any of their charges though. So they can’t gain anything and the risk is not worth it. No, I doubt they would do it. But if it makes you feel any better, I’ll be there during the questioning.’
‘I’m impressed, Potter.’ He leaned elegantly against the wall, crossing his arms. ‘I thought you were going to crack in front of her.’
- Hey Ron, I actually really have to discuss something with you. – Still calm, ok, so far it’s not entirely bad.
- Ron, please, don’t. Slughorn will return any minute, you’ll get detention for challenging someone in the middle of class… - Hermione was a little too practical in this situation for Harry’s taste.
‘No, that’s not what I’m asking. If I get convicted, all of them are going to think he tried to help me. So what happens with his career?’
‘I’m really sorry for this. I shouldn’t have. I’m really grateful that you invited me here with Harry but I think you’d rather spend this evening without me.’ He pushed his chair back to leave, but was promptly stopped by Molly standing up.
‘We’re getting this regularly when we move in together!’ Draco stated matter-of-factly. ‘It’s a shame it’s so small though.’
‘Harry, please.’ Draco scoffed. ‘Do I really seem that over the top? No, I like my things to be simple, elegant and, above all, functional. I don’t need everything around me to be delicate and intricate, there’s no need for it.’
- Not directly, I know. But you asked if the idea of you taking charge of me sounded good because it was you or because I wanted anyone to do that and you were just there.
Somehow, all the emotions Draco thought he’d left behind him in recent days, came back. He was sitting there, on Potter’s windowsill, at 2 in the morning, smoking a Muggle cigarette (how exactly did it happen? He used to be a proud Slytherin and now he somehow managed to go through all the vices he could think of in a span of a month…), wearing some abominable creation he’s been supplied with (‘sweatpants’, was it?), battling a string of confusing thoughts and images that had no place to even be in his brain, let alone resurface like that.
- Loose interest? In you? – Draco looked like he wasn’t believing what he was hearing. – Love, I could never loose interest in you. I just don’t want you to feel rushed. I’ve wanted you all this time and I will want you, even if it means waiting months. Don’t worry about me, I can take care of myself.
So, I have elected to take a few creative liberties on the procedure in front of Wizengamot (I hope those don't bother you too much) - in case you wondered, it's based on real-life systems where those who investigate are the ones to prosecute the case (and so ask questions during the cas etc.).
‘You.’ It was barely audible, even in the complete silence of the apartment. Potter was once again refusing to look up at him, focusing instead on seemingly trying to burn a hole in the floor with his gaze. Draco was completely shocked by Potter’s confession.
- Trust me, hardly anybody would want to be in your situation. You’ve been shoved into being a leader practically since you came to Hogwarts that 1
‘Because it doesn’t matter to me anymore. I cut ties with these people. And it’s not really illegal as far as I know, right?’
‘I don’t know, I just have this feeling that something is off. Like he’s going to come after someone and it won’t end well.’
He groaned and lit another cigarette. The pack was half-empty already, despite Potter throwing it at him hours before. When he first suggested Draco tried tobacco to slow his, permanently racing, mind down the day before, Malfoy only scoffed. How would some mundane, Muggle plant help him? But it did seem to work and now he was hooked. Maybe it wasn’t as good as his herbs, maybe it didn’t empty his mind completely, but at least while the smoke filled his lungs he was able to focus on one thing at a time.
Malfoy, on the other hand, was as far from things not mattering and being ok as you could possibly get. He just couldn’t believe how dense his friends were being ever since his last confrontation with Potter.
So, how's my attempt at writing safe and fully consensual sex? It's the first full scene of this particular kind I have ever written, so do let me know :) I might go back to the severly-more-rough practices at some point, but I'm thinking that's more of a sequel material after I wrap up this one (I kind of have a rough idea for a part 2, but nothing's set in stone yet, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated!)
. What the guys described was more like tar than blood, right? So my guess is the dark magic in the barrier somehow interacted with the dark magic in your mark. Voldemort should’ve probably foreseen this, but he didn’t – it wouldn’t be the first time, if we’re honest, he had a tendency to, well, ignore things. And your father was the only one who knew so Voldemort didn’t expect any of the Death Eaters trying to open that door.’
‘Ron will have to deal with it. If he can’t get it through to his head that he was wrong, he is just being an idiot. And frankly, regardless of the fact that he was wrong, I have absolutely zero interest in his input on the situation.’ Harry looked determined.
- No, it’s not like when you’re not feeling well and someone is bringing you cookies and tea, if that’s what you understood. It goes further than that. Some days I just want someone else to take full control of my life and just look out for me while I do what I’m told. Draco says it’s a whole thing and it’s supposedly called “being a submissive”. – His face was red, he could hardly look at his friends in embarrassment.
‘It fits, Draco, it does! Look here, at the bottom!’ Suddenly, Potter’s side was on top of Draco’s thigh, pressing firmly in as Potter leaned forward to show him something. It took all of Draco’s willpower to focus on what Potter was saying. ‘The woman said she has seen you several times in that field, right? We know what you were doing there, but the only reason she would be there at the same time would be that she was doing the same thing!’
‘You mean Potter? That whole thing a year ago was his fault. Although I suppose he sold you a completely fabricated story…’
‘You are. You’re in no state to be taken seriously and besides, you’re a suspected member of a scheme-running group, so you’ll need to testify.’
‘And he asked how I see him being here and us three working together.’ Harry felt his face turning white. This was no good.
‘What about?’ Draco was desperately trying to come up with something that would get rid of Potter. He wasn’t exactly succumbing to self-loathing like he used to, but it didn’t mean he was feeling entirely good about himself right now.
‘I don’t know. I just don’t. I have been doing things like that all my life, it just comes natural to me. With my family you learn this before you even talk.’ Draco sighed and looked at Kingsley. ‘Minister, did you find anything in there?’
‘I don’t know, just came to mind. Come on, it’s just between us. You’ve got dirt on me, so it’s only fair I have dirt on you. So who was it? Normani? She-Weasel?’
‘Well, what can I say, my brain does weird things sometimes. I think the…’ But he didn’t have a chance to finish this thought.
The ex-Slytherins were sitting by the Great Lake in the last rays of end-of-the-summer sunshine before autumn would inevitably take over. They were supposed to study together, but somehow all of their books laid discarded on the grass and the students were deep in conversation.
- God, if that doesn’t mean I’m a freak, I don’t know what on Earth would mean that! – He looked like he was on the verge of tears again.
‘Don’t forget where I grew up… But if you’re offering, I’ll take it. Honestly, you’re saving my ass yet again.’
‘Well, Minister, frankly speaking, I want to be here when the snatchers are interrogated and I can’t do that if Malfoy is not questioned before.’
‘Just try and fucking stop me…’ Draco didn’t know where it came from, but he found himself facing Granger, pointing his wand at her. ‘I fucking dare you…’ He saw her reaching into her robes to raise her own wand, but his instinctive action was faster. ‘
- Listen carefully now, because I will not repeat myself. If there’s even one more instance when I hear… - he didn’t finish this thought, because all of the attention was suddenly on a figure coming in their direction. Potter.
- What do you mean you don’t hate him anymore?! – Weasel was clearly disgusted at whatever he was just told.
‘Well, that last one is kind of logical, there was no need for a… how did you call it? Trigger? …if you were there.’
- No, I don’t have time right now. – It came out way harsher than Harry intended it to be and he made a mental note to apologize to her later. Right now, he had to find Draco’s friends and talk to them. Luckily, they were all gathering their things from a small table by the window where they usually studied together in the evenings, preparing to head out to breakfast. – Hey, guys, I wanted to talk to you if it’s ok… - Harry was scared of their reaction, but he just had to know if Draco was telling the truth when he told Harry he was a different person now.
‘Ron’s right.’ Harry said bitterly. ‘Lucius Malfoy is the new Chief of Aurors, even if this is not his official title, and it will stay that way.’
- I dare you, you fucking scum, say one more word and you’ll regret the day you were born. – Not using any of the Unforgivable Curses right then and there was the most difficult task Draco faced in his life. Over the wrath he didn’t even notice that nobody moved a muscle, everyone was too shocked to break the fight apart. – I fucking dare you, say something else… SAY IT! – He was screaming, but it didn’t matter.
‘And way under-desired for anything else…’ Draco said glumly. He knew Harry would take it as a reference to his Dark Mark, although in all honesty that was not all he meant.
‘Well, that is a concern, I have to admit it. In that case, Mr. Potter, you’ll be the one responsible. You live alone, am I correct?’
exactly did I say it, Mr. Weasley? I merely said you found the room in his childhood home, this doesn’t automatically implicate Mr. Malfoy.’ He looked at Draco and Harry’s eyes followed his gaze. Draco looked horrified.
It took him a few days just to compose himself enough to think about what he was going to do. He didn’t dare go back to the parlour in case the word got out already and other wizards would come to have their fun with him. He still had enough money put aside to somehow get by, so he wasn’t worried about it.
- But… but why? What happened? – Pansy was stunned. Draco sighed and looked at Harry. It was clear there was an incredible pain in his eyes.
‘No. Don’t do it. I love you, I’m not ashamed of this and I will not run because someone sees us together.’ He said calmly, quiet enough that only the Malfoys heard him. ‘We’re doing this and if someone has a problem with it, it’s theirs to deal with. I am not, and will not, be apologizing for who I’m with.’
He was in the middle of kicking himself mentally (for the third time that day) for allowing himself to go there (
- What other stuff? – Harry was desperately trying to sound calm, although by now he was starting to panic. Neville knew, so God only knows who else Ron told. This was not good, this was definitely not good.
The only logical conclusion Draco was able to reach was that Potter was, on some level, attracted to him, but at the same time he hated him too much to ever actually do anything about it. And that whisky must have dulled down the hatred considerably.
‘I’m afraid it’s our only option. It was your family home, and if anyone is going to know what’s hidden there, it’s Lucius. And depending on what he tells you we might be able to determine who besides him knew. But you would have to do it alone – none of us can be seen with you if he is to trust you. We would be listening to the conversation from a different place.’
‘Draco, please… You have to believe me…’ Malfoy’s expression has changed for a fraction of a second, but before Harry could decipher what was it, he was back to a completely blank mask again.
‘There, the second line from the top. While he was spying on you, Ron found the remnants of what looked like a campsite. At first we didn’t consider it because we thought you were the one to make it. But then you told me you’ve lived in that hut for a year, so the campsite must be somebody else’s…’
‘That was a fluke. There is nothing there. Wait, did you tell boss about this?!’ Harry was panicking.
‘Maybe it will die down in a few weeks?’ Harry tried to sound hopeful, but he really didn’t believe it himself.
- Mal… Draco. – To all their surprise, Ron cleared his throat and spoke. – I think if you both love each other and want to be together, you should at least try and work it out. Merlin knows I’m not the biggest fan of this relationship, but it seems to me that I’ve got you two wrong from the start. I thought you were planning on being a… - He hesitated. - …boss of Harry of sorts, and I really didn’t like it. You know, I didn’t trust you. I still don’t completely, not after what you’ve done. But after tonight it seems to me that I was wrong. That you both were wrong in fact. You can’t control Harry, nobody can. The git never does what he’s told and it seems you trying to break up with him was no exception.
- No, it’s nothing, I was just thinking. – He sat on the bed. – Well, no. I was kind of panicking honestly.
‘Harry, please, don’t. I’m not going to fall apart.’ Draco tried to smile, but he was too scared of what Shacklebolt was planning. ‘What is it, Minister?’
- Oh, I see. I suppose there isn’t much I can do besides just being myself. But how do I act with clients?
‘Longbottom.’ Ron never used his real name during operations – it was routine for all Aurors to use aliases, but Ron was tired of making up names. ‘And thank you, you’re very kind. But I need your help, madame, if I am to succeed. I need all the information you can give me on this bloke you’ve been seeing that they say used to be a Death Eater.’
‘But he wants all his influence back. He used to be a very powerful person, don’t forget that. And after the war he lost most of that influence. My guess is he wants to go back to where he was before, and a big job in the Ministry would be a good way to do that.’
‘Oh God, are you ok?’ Harry immediately fell to his knees beside him – Draco’s face was twisted in pain, his right wrist covered in nasty, blistering burn marks. Harry couldn’t see properly in the faint
- Oh, look at you… - Ron laughed, clearly amused at Draco’s enthusiasm over Muggle food delivery. – A couple of months with Harry and you’re becoming a fan of Muggle lifestyle!
‘Muggle thing. They sell whipped cream in long thin cans that come with a nozzle and you can spray it onto whatever you’re eating, already whipped.’
- I… I don’t know. – Harry sat up. Draco suddenly felt cold even though the room was warm enough. – I realized some time ago I’m gay. After the war ended and I could freely be with Ginny like I thought I wanted to, I realized I didn’t have any romantic feelings for her. She was-is amazing, and I feel good around her, like I can finally be myself, but there was no love there, you know?
– he has bounced back from his wasted state Harry has seen both back in Muggle London and when Ron first brought him back from Scotland, and now he was tall and elegant and lean, his skin back to its usual, almost iridescent, tone, that reminded Harry of white marble. Harry smiled to himself, looking at how Draco was chewing at his bottom lip, thinking. There was a faint hue of colour on his cheeks and his usually steel-grey eyes seemed to darken with determination, and Harry was instantly reminded of how Draco looked at him last night: it was almost the same, although yesterday there was maybe a little more warmth in those eyes – like Harry wasn’t a
‘Well, you buy it in an electronics store. It’s a store that sells household appliances, like cookers, microwaves, vacuums, washing machines…’ He added, noticing the Malfoys’ expressions. ‘But I doubt we could use it for ourselves. I don’t know if Grimmauld Place even has electricity, and besides, magic tends to interfere with Muggle technology – that’s why there is none of it at Hogwarts, even though having a cell phone could be kind of handy at times.’
‘It’s not what it looks like!’ Draco knew it was an instinct, it was cliché really, but Harry’s words burned. He was really being stupid if he thought this would mean something, wasn’t he? Not that he did, at least not consciously, but through all the amazing sensations he was going through minutes before he hoped, somewhere deep inside, that maybe, just maybe, something could come out of it. Now he knew there was never even a shred of chance for it, ever, and he was falling again, although this time it had nothing to do with pleasure – this time it was like he was pushed off a roof of one of those tall, Muggle buildings, and at the end of the fall there would be a solid, flat, unforgiving concrete. He heard the door shutting when Weasley left and stood up to go take a shower. He didn’t even want to look at Harry right now, it was too painful.
And there were a couple of one night stands with several Ravenclaws, one Durmstrang student over the Easter holidays and one very drunken mistake with Nott. All together, around 12 people I think?
‘Canned cream? What on Earth are you talking about?’ Draco, all patched up now, was staring at him in disbelief.
The inside of room 20 was dimly lit and very different to the rest of the parlour. Where other girls preferred to decorate their quarters in red or pink, Yasmine opted for a rich, moss green with silver accents. Both the matron and Jeanelle found it a little out of the ordinary, but the clients seemed to like it and it somehow weirdly suited the thin blonde. It made her look like a forest fairy or a nymph, Jeanelle thought, if forest fairies or nymphs were real.
In the common room, Draco was battling similar thoughts. By now he was completely sure that he was to blame not only for how Harry’s first time ended, but for the two of them even going there in the first place. He should’ve said no when Harry told him he wanted to go all the way tonight. Neither of them was ready for it, it was clear to Draco – Harry’s motivation for moving further was shaky, he could see that now clearly, and Draco let himself use it to get what he wanted for months now, even though he should’ve known better than that. It was a scary realisation that he let lust and greed overtake him like that even when he thought he was still able to control himself. Somehow, it was even worse than what he did at the end – he was well aware that he wasn’t thinking then, but those minutes earlier he was so sure he still had a cool head on his shoulders. And now it became apparent that he wasn’t thinking at all and he didn’t even realise it. He didn’t deserve Harry. He was supposed to protect him, not hurt him. And if he was the one to cause him so much pain that Harry was reduced to crying from it, there was no hope for the two of them. No, he needed to take a step back – however much he wanted Harry close to him, above all he wanted his boyfriend to be safe and happy, and he wasn’t the one to make that happen. Harry has already had enough monsters in his life, he didn’t need another one. Draco threw his head back, trying to control the tears. The thought he was better than that, he thought he would be able to break out of the circle of violence he’s been a part of ever since he could remember. And now it was obvious that he couldn’t do it even for the one person he loved above everyone else, the only one he would kill for. He smirked bitterly. “Kill for” – yeah, he should’ve known weeks ago, when he attacked Thomas. That was when he should’ve stepped away. He should’ve realised that his actions then proved he really was what everyone around him took him for, and backed out then. He would’ve had his heart broken, but Harry wouldn’t have been hurt like that. But no, he was too much of a self-absorbed coward to do that. Once again, he put his needs above Harry’s when he should’ve done the exact opposite.
by Rita Skeeter – read the headline. The title was annoying by itself, but the fact that it was a piece by Skeeter made Harry nauseous as he began reading.
What Harry regretted, however, was that he let his feelings show. He just desperately hoped that Draco wouldn’t figure out his expression when he inadvertently admitted that Draco
Ron and Neville left, and Draco was now feeling completely drained and terrified. Veritaserum was still in effect, swimming through his bloodstream, so he knew that he couldn’t undo his confession. He felt miserable under Harry’s gaze, like what he said hurt them both: it wasn’t like Harry had any feelings towards him, and now that he knew how Draco felt, he would most likely feel obligated to stay with him, even when he clearly didn’t want to – Draco knew that Harry was too much of a good, caring person to risk doing anything that would push anybody, even Draco, to hurting themselves. So he would stay there, waiting for something to change, before he could just up and leave Draco forever, because he surely can’t be expected to be stuck with him for the rest of his life. But the moment Draco blurted out his potion-induced love confession, it became clear that those feelings weren’t going anywhere, that he would be forever in love with Harry Potter. And even if somehow, at some point, he would manage to lie and convince Harry that he was over him, just to free him of the burden of having to be there, it would take time. And in the meantime he would be the lowest thing he has ever been in his life – a charity case for feelings. He chuckled bitterly to himself, wiping the tears that gathered in his eyes. How could he have been so naïve to think that he had already hit his rock bottom? It should’ve been obvious – as long as you can still somehow survive with all the self-loathing and pure, unadulterated hatred towards yourself, it can still be worse. He sighed. At least this time there was nowhere to go. At least this time there was no way he could survive this, so things couldn’t possibly get any worse. Give it days and he wouldn’t be here anymore. And he wouldn’t even have to do anything, just stay there exactly where he was, feeling exactly as he did right now, and his own revulsion with himself will tear him to shreds on its own. It was just a matter of time.
- Oh, judging by the conversation we all heard, there might just be something there. – Pansy proclaimed in a sing-song voice.
‘You got the job! Of course, you’re not an Auror, so all the paperwork and court duties are on my head, but other than that, we work together!’
‘Well, frankly, yes…’ Harry sighed. ‘But I don’t want you to think that I’m having these doubts for my sake!’ He added hastily. ‘It’s not that I think of you badly, I’m really grateful for your support and all the love you’ve shown me, I really am! To be honest, I saw during the war that neither of you wanted to be there, wanted to do this. I know you’re good people. I just suspect this would bring a lot of attention to you and I don’t think it would be good attention.’ Harry was rapidly turning red. This was not the conversation he wanted to have with his future mother-in-law, ever.
‘Coincidence – yes, suspicious – no. If I was in on it, they would take me to travel with them, that’s one thing. I would be, well, I was, the perfect excuse for them, so they would want me everywhere they went to use me just as they did in that village.’
‘Fuck, you’re so tight…’ Draco was growling again, but it only made Harry want him all inside. ‘…you’re so
‘Wow. That, I was not expecting…’ He tried to pull himself together. ‘But thank you, I’m flattered.’ Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter get up and leave the room.
- Lay off him, Hermione. – Draco looked ashamed for some reason. – I asked Theo to hurt me. I asked him to not hold back, he only obliged.
, but a person that has been described to me by a witness in a case I’m working. And that happens to be you.’
‘Minister, they can’t! You just said it, Malfoy’s involved! AGAIN!’ Ron was flailing his arms and screaming.
‘…And you are a leader, Harry.’ Draco smiled reassuringly. ‘As much as it pains me to admit it, I’ve been wrong about you when we first talked about it. Our time together has showed me that it’s not that you…’ He glanced at Narcissa, clearly not wanting to say too much in front of her. ‘…that you need to follow someone. It’s just the war has exhausted you and you needed time to rest and get back to yourself. But that doesn’t mean you are not a leader.’
He groaned, resting his head on his desk. If he was prepared to be honest with himself, he would conclude that it was simply because anything was better than going back to his cold and empty apartment (he bought a small studio near the Waterloo East train station about a year prior). Ever since the war ended, he felt alone. Ron was happily married to a very pregnant Hermione, while he and Ginny had a falling out – the demons of war were too much for her to handle so they split and by now she was engaged to Dean Thomas and Harry was all alone.  He tried to find someone, following Hermione’s advice, but every woman he met seemed to only be interested in being Mrs. Potter, not actually Harry’s wife. It was frustrating and discouraging, so a few months ago Harry turned to fulfilling his carnal desires with Muggle prostitutes – that way, he could be whoever he wanted to be, without the burden of being The Chosen One, and he didn’t even need to change his appearance that much – he only needed to conceal his scar, which was tricky at first, but with time he became quite proficient at it. Harry sighed and packed up his things. It was no use sitting there at his desk anymore. He knew he had a lot of work to do the following day, so he decided to apparate straight into his bedroom and go to sleep.
It was Sunday, so they all had the afternoon free, but Harry didn’t want to join his classmates in hanging around in the common room. He was lying on his bed trying to finally get done with all his homework that was due next week, but as soon as he figured out a particularly tricky question on his Charms worksheet there was a knock on the door. Malfoy raised his eyes from his Herbology essay and called for whoever was on the other side to come in. It was the first break in silence in the room since they finished their last night’s conversation in a fit of laughter. Harry didn’t know how to act around his roommate anymore (at least not until he finally figured out what the hell was he feeling), so he decided it’s best to just stick with ignoring each other.
) arse swam into his head, Draco had to bite his lip to stop himself from groaning. But the closer he got to finishing, the more difficult it became – once the orgasm hit him, no amount of blood on his lower lip (he didn’t even register when that happened, he was too preoccupied with fantasizing about running his tongue all over Potter’s impressive muscles) was enough to stop the loud
- I am, thank you Neville. – Harry decided not to ask what Neville really meant on the off chance that he was interpreting Neville’s speech wrong. – You’re a good friend, you know?
- Honestly, I figured as much myself. With all you’ve been forced to do, it seemed obvious that you hadn’t exactly had time to hook up with people.
It was already past midnight. His excursion to the Hogsmeade Apothecary was a success and Harry was – for the first time since the Battle of Hogwarts – peacefully lying in his bed thinking about nothing, when a loud “BANG!” of opening doors brought him back from his blissful state of haze. He registered (not without some difficulty) that Malfoy had come back to the room from wherever he’s been all Saturday. Harry didn’t care. His brain was floating through the vast plains of literally nothing and although he didn’t quite manage to fall asleep yet, for once he was not accompanied by the distraction of neither the outside world, nor his own disturbing thoughts. So what if he was a freak? So what if the wizarding community placed their trust in the worst person for the job? It didn’t matter now. Somehow, the concoction of potions he took 2 hours before made it all right – like nothing mattered anymore, but in a good way. Harry couldn’t explain this, but it felt right.
I'm thinking of writing a oneshot set during their summer at Malfoy Manor - it would be way less dark than this one, kind of a general funny domestic fluff about how useless are both of them at household chores and how confused Malfoys are at things like cell phones and cabs :D Let me know it you'd be up for reading this one and what Muggle technology you think would be most confusing (in a funny way!) to wizards :D
Ron stood up and followed the figure from a more-than-safe distance. He arrived at a small hut at the very edge of the forest a couple of minutes after the person already closed the door behind him – he knew this must be the correct place, even though he didn’t clearly see the figure disappearing inside, because some of the fresh herbs from the field were lying on the windowsill next to the door. He braced himself, lifted his Disillusionment Charm and knocked. There was no answer. He stood there for a minute, intently listening for any sounds of conversation, before knocking again. This time he heard something that resembled a moan or a groan, although he couldn’t determine if the cause of that was pleasure or pain. He decided to open the door and check.
‘Do you really? It’s the middle of the night and we’re talking about us having sex. And you’re under no obligation to talk to me right now.’
‘As long as Ron insists that I’m out of my mind, this is how it’s going to be.’ Harry said bitterly. ‘I’m sorry Neville, but I’m not the one having a problem with me and Draco, he is.’
- Oh, nothing, I just find it ironic that you seem to display the same propensity for switching sides as your boyfriend. Two peas in a pod, you know what I mean?
Harry was devastated. There was nothing he could do to convince Draco he wasn’t lying – no matter how many times he repeated it, how many times he told him to just try and believe, Draco was sure Harry was saying all these things to just make sure there would be no suicide attempt. So they were stuck like this, in complete silence, both of them still in Harry’s apartment and both of them still working in the office, for days. Harry knew Draco was hurting – it was enough to just look at him, bent over piles of paperwork day and night, to see that there was nothing but pain in those grey eyes, that he was just wishing something would happen that could free both of them.
‘Actually, Minister…’ Ron cleared his throat. ‘I do still have my suspicions about them, and this is, after all, our case, so I think it would be better if I did it.’ Harry was quickly getting angry. What was Ron playing at?
‘Well…’ Hermione hesitated. ‘We think that your injury is actually related to your Dark Mark. You see, it seems like what Voldemort put on the door was designed to somehow suck out all the positives about a person that tries to open the door. Kind of like dementors do, but instead of bringing out the worst memories and feeding off of them, it was supposed to permanently remove the good memories and good qualities of a person. It has been attempted once before, with no success, if the books are to be believed, and this is
‘Yes, trigger. A thing that would let them determine if a person is magical and if they have someone to rely on in a time of a crisis.’
- You’re right Theo. – Draco sounded scared. – After I blacked out it stopped hurting so I wanted more.
‘Ginny? Ginny Weasley?’ Malfoy chuckled. ‘Your victim’s fiancée? Oh, this is getting more and more interesting…’
- You know, parlours, call houses, whatever you want to call them. – Mina saw Draco’s confused expressions. – Brothels.
‘I’m going to ignore the jabs at my intelligence, Malfoy, because this is actually a good idea.’ Potter all of a sudden looked slightly intimidated, like he was ashamed of something. ‘In fact, I had a sort of… brief thought…’ He hesitated ‘…nevermind.’
form, because no matter what Draco tried to do with it, it refused to form a uniform ball like it was supposed to, and crumbled into several smaller ones.
- Fuck off, all of you! Leave me alone! – Draco’s patience ran out. He was disgusted with what he heard, with his own reaction to it and now, on top of it, with his friends’ attitude towards the whole situation.
And it seemed like half of the ex-Gryffindors agreed with Harry’s opinion – in a matter of seconds three wands were pointing at Malfoy’s face. If it wasn’t for Hermione’s “Stop this right now!” Ron, Seamus and Dean would’ve hexed Malfoy – each one with their own spell – which would’ve inevitably sent Malfoy to the Hospital Wing for at least a week, by Harry’s estimation.
‘Not important, it was a long time ago. And you’d never say yes to this anyway.’ Potter turned red, like he realized he said to much.
- No, I’m not ok! – Harry bellowed – Bloody McGonagall won’t let me switch rooms! She says it’s the “safest option”, because apparently I’m the only one that can defend themselves against that fucking pathetic excuse of a Death Eater!
He should’ve known this time would be different, though, because this time it wasn’t just his imagination he had to go off of. The second the picture of Potter’s (round, decadent,
- Yeah mate, are you all right? You look like you’re about to hex us all – Ron, in turn, had fear written all over his face.
‘Yes, they’re in the garden, I’ll have Ginny fetch them. Is everything all right? Where are you anyway? I thought your house wasn’t hooked up to the network…’
He stood up, threw one last icy glare towards his fellow ex-Slytherins and stormed off towards his bedroom. He was fuming. How the hell could they believe he had feelings for Potter?! He despised him. The bloody hero took away all he cherished in his life. He blasted the door open and stopped dead in his tracks. The scene he witnessed inside was definitely not what he had expected…
- Why do you think I always take this long to get out of the shower, silly? – Draco laughed and Harry felt enormous relief washing over him.
So there it was. The one moment in his life he never wanted to live through, the time when he would find out how long he’s going to Azkaban for. Not that it mattered anyway, nothing about him mattered at this point – he would gladly take a life sentence if Harry’s job would be safe in return. He tried looking at Harry, tried to understand what mindset was he in, but all he could find on his face was something similar to anger – but not quite. He thought he has seen the same expression on Harry’s face when he was chasing a snitch during Quidditch matches a lifetime ago. So Draco looked around. The three actual snatchers were there with him, looking solemn, like they knew their fate already. Weasley was looking like he was expecting to be declared a winner of some great tournament and like there was no way he would lose this.
‘And what good does waiting do me?’ Draco refused to look down. They were frozen like that, Harry’s hand on Draco’s wrist, eyes locked, leaning towards each other, for a couple of seconds before Harry finally let go and spoke.
The scene seemed to go on for hours, but all Harry could focus on was Draco’s tears on his neck and his nails digging into his side. It hurt, but Harry knew it was nothing compared to what he was feeling right now, just listening to the memory. He tightened his arms around Draco, trying to shield him from what was going on. ‘Shhh, don’t listen… It’ll be over soon… Don’t listen, just focus on my voice…’ He whispered quietly enough for only Draco to hear ‘You’re not there anymore… It’s not real, it’s not happening, nobody’s hurting you now… Don’t listen… Focus on me now, breathe, focus on my voice, not on that…’ It seemed to work – Draco was still crying, but his breathing evened out a little and his grip on Harry loosened. The screaming stopped and Harry dared to look at what was happening.
- I got it. – Pansy looked flushed and out of breath. – Slughorn wasn’t even asking too many questions, he just wanted to know who was stupid enough to take this.
‘Okay, let’s say I’m convinced. But what does it change if they caused the triggers or just used them?’
- Oh, ok. I wasn’t sure Draco told you. And call me Theo. Anyway, if we’re on the topic, I don’t know how you feel about it, but from my end I want you to know you don’t need to worry about it. It was one mistake, we never should’ve done it and it was a long time ago. – He looked somehow out of countenance. – And besides, we… - He hesitated. – We’re not compatible. We’re into different things there, if you know what I mean.
- I know, I know. What you’ve been through would discourage anyone from being in charge, and the fact that I’m most likely right about who you are only amplified that.
‘Chief of Aurors, Holland, is retiring. And guess who secured himself a position to oversee the Office until a new Chief is found?’
Harry saw the group and his legs suddenly carried him in their direction. He stood over the Slytherins and hesitantly asked “Draco, can we talk in private?”. Draco threw one last warning glare at his friends and stood up to follow Potter around the lake.
‘You know, your behaviour back in the…’ Potter sighed ‘back in the place. I saw you were terrified to be found there, at what must have been your lowest, and I just thought that nobody needs to know that. That nobody needs this sort of thing being put on blast about them.’
Harry knew that Ginny wasn’t going to wait for him forever, but it stung nonetheless. He thought that after almost five years the news of her and someone else getting married (he didn’t even bother reading her fiancé’s name on the wedding invitation, it wasn’t important) would be bearable, but it still hurt to know she, like everyone else, has moved on, while he was stuck inside his home. He sighed and stood up – maybe it was time to slowly come back out again? In any case, he decided that he needed a drink and that this time, he was going out. By himself, because he still didn’t feel like being around other people, but out nonetheless. He got dressed, locked the door, and decided to apparate into Hog’s Head.
It was all a haze. Draco wasn’t even sure he really heard what he thought he heard. He was trying to compose himself enough for any sort of reaction, when a sheepish voice brought him out of his trance: “Draco, can you hug me?”. He wrapped his arms tightly around Harry resting his chin on top of the Gryffindor’s head. All was good in the world. There might, after all, be a chance for some happiness.
‘We’ve already amended the agenda for today, Mr. Potter, so we will be proceeding according to the one that includes your request.’
Draco Malfoy was walking along Grosvenor Place. It was nearly midnight and he had no idea where to go. It was barely 12 hours later he was a part of one of the most powerful magical families in Britain – now, he was an outcast. His parents have just been sentenced to life in Azkaban for their involvement in the war, leaving him with nothing. He chuckled bitterly. Their supposed friends were so certain they were all getting out of the whole ordeal scot-free that all their collective gold was spent on legal representation during the trial. Hell, his own parents were so sure they were going to be declared innocent that they took out a loan against Draco’s childhood home, thinking they were going to pay it back once they were cleared of all charges and back on their feet. Now it was all gone. By now, Narcissa and Lucius were probably sitting in their cells in Azkaban and Draco was lost in Muggle London having fled all the press that followed him ever since the moment he stepped foot outside the Ministry of Magic. He knew he couldn’t go back. He was a homeless son of convicted Death Eaters with no money and no friends – even if he was willing to ask for help, he was well aware that there was nobody that would be ready to spare him even a scrap of their floor. No, he needed to stay on the Muggle side of the country. But where to go? How on Earth was he going to survive? He knew nothing about earning Muggle money, he had no education that would be useful whatsoever and on top of that, his sheltered upbringing left him with no contacts here. He was so desperate to get away, he had no plan in place. He sighed. There was no use dwelling on that right now, he needed to find a place to sleep. He looked around. It didn’t seem like there was anything other than lying down on a park bench he could do right now. The thought terrified him, but it wasn’t like he had any other option. He conjured himself a pillow and a blanket and braced himself for what he thought was going to be the most degrading night in his life. Oh, how wrong he was…
Narcissa was already at the entrance, door open, looking outside for them. As soon as she saw the two figures approaching, she ran towards them hugging them and practically dragging them inside.
- You mean don’t tell anyone else you want Malfoy to give you orders? Are you already ashamed of yourself? I’ll see what I can do. I haven’t decided yet.
‘It wasn’t about that…’ Potter’s voice dropped to a whisper. ‘It wasn’t that I thought you were dead, it was what happened before.’
- Didn’t need to do what exactly? – Draco knew this was not going to be a pleasant conversation. Even though the Slytherins were clearly on his side during the argument, as soon as the four of them were alone, their faces changed.
‘I want to know why you stopped me from asking that one question. And as for trust, it’s coming to me, I’m not completely there yet.’
As he made his way there, his frustration only rose. What else was there in store for him? It’s bad enough he’d have to endure the (very unwelcome in his current state of mind) company of the other houses’ students practically 24/7. How far did exactly McGonagall go with her “sunshine and roses” approach? If he actually listened to her start-of-term speech he might know, but his mind was elsewhere. In fact, it was elsewhere for months now. He was drained, tired, scared (although he tried with all the willpower he had left to push that last one out of his mind – Malfoys don’t get scared, he reminded himself constantly, and after all, he WAS still a Malfoy, even if stripped of all recognition of everything this name used to mean) – he tried to convince himself for all this time that it was just difficult to adjust to the world without the Dark Lord, but if he was really honest with himself he’d see that his state of mind started much earlier, at the beginning of his 6
- You’re not a freak. It’s just who you are. If you were a freak, what would that make me? – Draco whispered. – I’d be a freak too. Most likely regarded by other people as a sadistic one at that.
‘No, he can’t know!’ Harry was clearly panicking. ‘We need to set some rules for this! You can only talk about the case!’
‘I’m not going to explain the concept of television to you, it’s way too much of a story for right now. We’ll have to do it over some alcohol at some point, because it’ll take at least a couple of hours.’ There was that warmth again – did Harry just suggest spending time together AFTER Draco moves out? ‘Anyway, since you’re alive again, I’m going to the office. I’ll talk to the Chief and find out about you being my assistant. Wait here for me?’
‘Well, if you put it like that…’ Ron was clearly not happy, but he didn’t say anything. Harry and Draco exchanged amused looks – if anything was stronger than Ron’s stubbornness, it was his fear of Hermione’s wrath.
- That does it, Malfoy! – Ron was shouting. – You and me, after lunch, by the lake. We’ll see who’s eating slugs for dinner!
‘Lard? That’s lard? I thought it was cream!’ Draco had such a comically horrified expression on his face that Harry nearly fell of the table laughing.
- Don’t I date what? Tell it how it is? Were you or were you not the only one here to get branded with a Dark Mark? Am I wrong? – Dean was livid by now, but it was nothing compared to what Harry saw rising inside Draco.
- No, that’s not what I was talking about. Although, actually, I might want to know. – He added after reflecting.
- Baby, how could I? It’s all evidence of how amazing you are. And now you’re mine, all mine, and I get to be the only one to cherish these marks? – Suddenly, at the mention of marks, he looked down. His Dark Mark was clearly visible against his pale forearm, the only thing he hated about his own body. He thought he’d gladly let himself be slashed multiple times, ruining the perfection of the rest of his skin he appreciated so much, if only that would erase this hideous testament of his past. He bowed his head and tried to hide his left arm behind his back. There was no need for Harry to have to look at it, he was enough that Draco had to each morning, when he carefully wrapped his forearm in a muggle bandage to hide it.
Deciding he needed to pace himself with the alcohol, he groaned and stood up to return to his bottle. But as soon as he turned around to leave the bathroom, he was suddenly face to face with Potter.
- Mate, I’m sorry, but you’re kidding yourself right now. I can see now you’re too far gone to reason with. – Dean stood up to leave and Harry knew this meant he lost all the support he might have had in his Gryffindor friends. He just hoped that Hermione would be an exception to that.
- Come on, Draco, you can’t be sulking in here all day long! The boys and I are going to the grounds to study there and I’m taking you with us! Not a question! – Only now her eyes fell to the other bed. – Oh, afternoon Potter.
And so they went on. The Underground ride was uneventful, but when they got out of the station at Charing Cross Road (Draco having been considerably calmer on the escalator this time, although still not completely convinced he wasn’t going to end up wherever it was the steps went), Narcissa clutched Harry’s jacket in fright at the sight of the cars speeding by.
‘What reports?’ Draco’s mind was elsewhere for a moment, so he didn’t understand what Potter was talking about.
- Honestly, I don’t care what people think. Plus, I doubt I’ll become public enemy anyway, I’ve done enough good for the community to cut me some slack.
Days went by and although Harry and Malfoy went back to ignoring each other, there was still a lot more hostility in the air between them than before their argument in the common room. It started with petty things, like Malfoy taking an unusually long time to get ready in the morning when he knew Potter had the same breakfast and classes to get to as he did. Harry was convinced he was doing this just to spite him – after all, the wanker hardly ate at all, he didn’t usually go to breakfast and even if he did, he’d just down a cup of coffee in one go, so it’s not like he needed to get ready before Harry.
- You know god damn well what you meant! And lay off us, ok? We’re not bothering you if YOU didn’t notice!
- So I’m wondering if it would be a good idea to pull him out of there. He won’t come back on his own, he has nothing here, so he needs someone to lend a hand.
‘Intuition and bluff. I had an idea that something was off all the way back during the trial. Yaxley and Rowle would never spill this much on their own. But I didn’t know for sure so I lied to get Weasley to admit it.’
The second blow came a week later. Harry was eating dinner when Ron and Hermione stepped into his kitchen. It was obvious that Ron was furious.
It was past midnight when Harry stumbled through his front door, piss drunk and exhausted. All he could dream of right now was to collapse on his bed and sleep for the next week – but the scene that he witnessed once he entered his living room sobered him up at once.
twink. Young, blonde, well-built with a pretty face…’ Harry must have drunk more than he realised, because he would never say any of this if he was sober. But then, the combination of alcohol and his sudden urge to make some light-hearted fun of Draco, gave him all the courage he needed.
‘Don’t worry, we’ll manage without it. Go find some fruit and we’ll have a fruit tart today.’ Harry decided to remain optimistic. Draco sighed and went to look for something that might be useful on top of their pie-turned-tart. He returned almost immediately holding up a bunch of bananas looking very pleased with himself.
‘Harry, no!’ Draco looked at him horrified. ‘You can’t do this! You heard what she said, it’s dangerous!’
‘No, I didn’t. I’m trying to get rid of this picture from my brain. I told him I thought there was something between you two but that it was just intuition.’
‘So why didn’t you stay there?’ Draco didn’t know who asked the question – his eyes were at Harry, who was looking like he was on the verge of tears.
‘No, Mr. Potter.’ That was taking it way too far, Harry thought but bit his tongue. ‘Since you’re clearly interested in hearing what the suspects have to say – and I don’t mean that in a negative way, it’s completely understandable – I think the best course of action would be to allow you to take part in all the hearings. Now, seeing that the circumstances are, well,
This rejection proved to him once and for all that there was nobody that would be there for him. The lust wasn’t masking the loneliness anymore, Potter single-handedly managed to make morph them into a tiny little sadistic tandem festering inside Draco’s brain, waiting for a chance to strike again and again and again when he was starting to feel down on himself.
‘What? Where?’ He had to pull himself together, quickly, before he inevitably got hard again and Potter would notice something.
‘Lucius? No.’ Draco went stiff at the mention of his father. ‘I don’t want to, if I’m being honest. I don’t want nothing to do with him after all he put mother and I through.’ Suddenly there were tears in his eyes – he looked like something broke inside of him right at that moment, like he himself got broken. ‘We never wanted what happened, mother and I. I know it’s probably nothing after all that happened, but I just wanted to say I’m sorry. I know it mends nothing, but I just want you to know that I never wanted to be a part of this. And I know my mum didn’t either. We were just following where father went, we didn’t think we had any other choice. We both just wanted to stick together and we decided to just be there in the background, you know, to still be together as a family. Now I know that it was a wrong thing to do, that if father wanted to do what he did, we should’ve just left. But it wasn’t easy – mother loved him, despite what he was, and I was just raised to want to be like him, it was imprinted in me for years. I only started thinking for myself shortly before it all began and by then it was too late.’ Draco was crying, hiding his face in his hands. ‘I was stupid, I realize that now, I made all the wrong choices I could have. I’m sorry. I know you’ll probably never forgive me for all the hurt I’ve caused, but I just needed to tell you that it was never my intention to do it. I never imagined it would all turn out this way.’
- Maybe because I was afraid to talk to you about it before, didn’t you think of that? – Harry felt heat rising to his cheekbones.
- We both know I have to. I’ll talk to McGonagall, try to figure out the living situation so you don’t have to spend time with me. – And just like that, it was all over. Harry couldn’t even cry anymore, he was just staring blankly at the door Draco shut behind him.
It felt like he was being ripped apart. He didn’t know if there was no time for lubrication spells or if Nott decided to oblige his pleading for pain, but it didn’t matter. All that mattered was his hands were bound above his head, Theodore’s hand was on the back of his neck keeping him in place and he was on his stomach, being stretched by his friend’s thick cock beyond what he ever felt before. It hurt so much he was seeing white and every muscle in his body was trying to make him get up and run, against what his drunk brain was telling him: “You’re getting what you deserve, you’ve earned this, you’re a monster and this is how you should be treated…”. He didn’t know if he was being pounded for seconds or hours, he completely lost track of time, he nearly blacked out from pain. At some point there might have been tears, but it made no difference to him. All his focus was on trying to keep breathing, but it seemed like an impossible task. He didn’t know where he was or who he was with anymore. He barely heard what the person said.
- I think I understand. You gravitated towards her because she’s a strong person. On some level it must have been the same reasoning that led you to have this conversation with me of all people.
‘So you’re saying that the more this thing stays open the worst person I become?’ Draco was terrified.
There was complete silence at the table. Harry was stroking Draco’s hair, while the Weasleys and Hermione were looking at their own hands. After a while, Draco wiped his tears and spoke again.
‘Same here. I found one report of an attack on a Muggle, but nothing came of it, and one attack on the person who was later approached, but they didn’t know who did it. Oh, and there was no incident in Scotland, before that last one, when they used me as pawn.’
- Anyway, - Zabini broke the uncomfortable silence in half-whisper – what we saw in Potions was way over what we would’ve expected from Draco. Honestly, I don’t know what to even tell you, he never acted like this, not even before the war when he was still a full-blown arsehole to everyone he didn’t like. Oh, don’t look at me like that Theo, you know he was! We all were! – He responded to Nott’s irritated look.
‘Well, not for us, because we can just cast a cleaning spell. Muggles have to do everything themselves.’
‘You’ve put me in an impossible situation! I’m locked in here with Malfoy, I’m going stir crazy! I can’t fucking sleep because of it and now apparently I’m drunk at 7 a.m.!’
‘Could you stop embarrassing me for a second? And please, refrain from calling me that in front of my fiancée!’ Draco was clearly uncomfortable with the sudden outburst of motherly emotions.
‘And where do you plan to get it? It’s not exactly an over the counter thing.’ Ron was clearly terrified.
- It does. Trust me, it’s not easy for me. I have never felt about anyone the way I feel about you and walking away is the most difficult decision I had to make in my life. But it’s the only way.
If anyone was less happy with Shacklebolt’s abomination of an arrangement than Harry Potter was, it was Draco Malfoy. For the first twelve hours, while the drugs were still in his system, the whole thing seemed bearable (albeit by a very slim margin), but by that evening, when everything cleared, Draco was reduced to a permanent fixture on Potter’s couch, staring at the ceiling, not paying any attention whatsoever to his surroundings. The bitter truth slowly crept up on him, simultaneously with the drugs leaving his system – he was once again a part of the wizarding community that didn’t want him there, and even worse, he was now a suspect in a case held by the Auror Office. He never imagined his life would turn out more loathsome than it had been back in the Muggle London, but at this point, he would give everything for an opportunity to become Yasmine again. Hell, even having sex with Potter seemed like a better option than being forced to spend a single second more on his bloody couch.
- We do. But we can’t. I need to find some way to deal with this before I do something even more stupid… - Draco looked up. It was obvious he was at his wits’ end. He gave Nott a long look. – Fuck me, Theo. Fuck me till I can’t take it anymore.
‘Appreciated.’ With that, Harry slid off the windowsill and left Malfoy alone. He needed to do some thinking on his own.
It was under the stream of hot water they really had a chance to look at each other naked for the first time and Harry instantly understood why he was coming up with all the references to Draco’s arse back in September. It looked remarkable. Harry couldn’t resist pressing his chest to his boyfriend’s back and running his hands down to his full cheeks.
It took him at least a few tries to force the whisk to start whipping the cream by itself – Harry stopped counting how many attempts there were exactly after the third time he’s been hit in the face with it, because Draco sent it flying across the table. Regardless, the cream was being whipped and the crust began to take its form – or at least,
‘I figured there would have to be some protection against lifting the spells from the outside. Or by people they’re designed to keep out. I just didn’t know what protection exactly. This one, I haven’t seen it before.’
For the next two weeks Harry spent time exclusively with Draco and his Slytherin friends. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs avoided the group like a plague (the first time they backed out the common room when they saw Harry, Pansy, Baise, Theo and Draco sitting by the fire, Harry had a sudden flashback to the 2
The article went on, but Harry couldn’t stand a single word more. He crumpled up the newspaper and threw it in the fire.
That’s it, that’s enough. ‘Why am I talking to myself?’ – did he really just say that out loud? No, he couldn’t have. But then he heard Malfoy shout ‘Did you say something?’ from the living room.
So he decided he best laid low for now and he ended up in London, in his godfather’s home (he couldn’t really bring himself to call it his own – it would always belong to Sirius). He hasn’t been there since the fiasco at the Ministry at the beginning of this whole horcrux-hunting journey. He knew that Yaxley has seen the place, he suspected that he might be able to enter – and if he did, Merlin knows what fate would await Kreacher. He dreaded coming through the door, not knowing what he’ll find inside. But it was quiet. Nobody was there. It was like no one has seen the place since Sirius died, like he, Ron and Hermione weren’t ever there, like Kreacher never existed. It was somehow worse than if he would’ve found his body somewhere – at least then he would be sure what happened to his house elf and he could bury him (somehow, the idea of following the Black family tradition of mounting his head on the wall was not an option for Harry). But Kreacher had vanished and all Harry knew for sure (although he had no idea how he knew that) was that the elf never betrayed them, never spilled anything he heard while Harry was his master – and that realization made it even worse. Yet another death on his score card.
‘So what, Weasley, you think me seeing a case file open is more of a problem than seeing Harry naked?’
‘Seriously, Ginny? You’re going against me on this? I thought after all the things you and… After all that went on, you’d be supporting me!’ Dean was shocked.
- Oh, do you actually feel like you’re a Slytherin now, huh? – Ron was annoyingly amused with himself. – If you didn’t notice, we were talking about their Quidditch team, you inserted yourself in it all on your own buddy.
Sharp knock on the door tore Draco out of his thoughts. It was three months since he started pretending to be a Muggle and for the last two of those he spent half his time as a woman, a sex worker no least. If his parents knew where their only son was right now, they’d disown him – if there was anything left to be disowned from, that is. Hell, if anyone in the wizarding community knew Draco became Yasmine, there would be a scandal like there never was before – not that it made any difference, Draco was not welcome back no matter what he did or did not do, even though he still kept that one last glimmer of hope for returning to his rightful home alive through all the shit that was his life right now. But nothing stop those incessant thoughts that plagued him every waking hour. He was reduced to a glorified toy, forced to do whatever men who came to see him wanted him to do, just to not end up on the street. The fact that he, and only he, knew all those supposedly heterosexual men were really spending their nights with a male was not much of a consolation. He had no feelings whatsoever towards his clients, neither good nor bad, so the knowledge that he was deceiving them made no difference to his state of mind. He grunted and tried to brace himself for what was inevitably going to be yet another night of being used in every way imaginable. Jeanelle entered and informed him that in a couple of minutes he was going to have a client and that he needed to be on his best behaviour, since it was a regular of Normani’s and tended to spent astonishing amounts of money any time he visited the parlour.
‘Possibly. Shut the door behind you on your way out.’ Malfoy seemed thoroughly bored with the conversation.
He camped out in the field for hours, but it was all for nothing. Nobody came and just as the sun was rising over the horizon, Ron decided to get up from the boulder he’s been occupying for the last six hours and head back. He stood up, wincing for his poor arse that went completely numb by this point, frozen to the rock, and stretched. He would have to come back some other time.
- What did you just say? – Harry tried to step out from behind his boyfriend to stand next to him, but Draco’s outstretched arm stopped him.
- I don’t know, I’ll have to figure something out. I don’t know anybody here, so last night I just slept on a park bench.
- Oh, I see. – Harry was looking at his half-eaten breakfast now. He suddenly wasn’t hungry anymore.
- Oh, so that was where the infamous Black residence went! Bellatrix was livid when she found out she’s not getting it, but nobody told her who really got it. Turned out for the best, I suppose.
- Ron, please, can you hear me out? I’m not asking you to be my friend, I understand your position. – That was a blatant lie. - I just have one tiny thing to ask of you. And I suppose you might be ok with it given how you’re feeling…
‘Nothing. There’s nothing I can do. Even if I thought he was right, which I don’t by the way, you already know everything. So short of obliviating you, which would be entirely counterproductive, there isn’t anything I can do about it. Like it or not, we’re stuck in this together now.’
‘What’s gotten into you first thing in the morning?’ Ron looked taken aback, but it did nothing to ease Harry’s anger at him.
- I don’t know what her, well, “affiliations” are, I don’t know her well enough, but from what I’ve heard, she might be the type of person you would subconsciously look for, even if she wasn’t the right gender for you. Just to find some level of protection in her.
‘Well, kind of. I heard a guy wanking off once and it gave me… ideas.’ Not even drunk Harry would admit he was talking about Draco.
- You’re a lunatic Potter! – Draco didn’t register how, but he was on Potter’s bed checking his pulse. It seemed fine, thank Merlin. – You need to go to the Hospital Wing now! Or better yet, to Slughorn!
- What the hell was that?! – Zabini exploded once the doors were locked and protective and silencing charms were in place.
He has almost reached the exit when he overheard his name being mentioned in a conversation between two elderly witches standing nearby. He didn’t want to insert himself into the conversation, so he just pretended to look at a shop display next to him and listened carefully. “Yes, yes, Draco Malfoy… The Death Eaters’ son, yes… Somewhere in Muggle London, they say Harry Potter has found him… Apparently he’s really not doing good… Very, very bad in fact…”.
- Baby, that’s no good, you can’t go on like that! You’ll get mugged or worse! Come with me, I’ll let you crash at my place until you find something for yourself. Like I said, I work nights, but it’s not from home so you won’t have to deal with that.
- Maybe it’s easier that way. I’ve done a lot of self-reflection this past few days and I want you to know I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I’ve done to you, it never should’ve happened. It was inexcusable, I swore I’m going to protect you and I hurt you. I was only thinking about myself that day, I realize that now. – Draco was crying. – I should’ve known it wasn’t true what I told you when I said I’m not violent. I am. It just comes out when I’m not controlling myself so I never saw it. I should’ve, after what I did to your friends, but I didn’t. I was kidding myself when I thought it was only because I was angry, I should’ve predicted that it would come out because of other things too. Because of how much I wanted you. I know you’ll probably never forgive me, but all I can do now is try to make you understand how much I hate myself right now. I have never felt this worthless. And I’m not worthy of you…
‘That’s because so far you’ve been essentially a bounty hunter, Potter. Your job description was to find people with arrest warrants over their heads, the cases themselves were already made. Now that most of those are gone, you’ll have to figure out how to build cases on your own. If I were you, I’d get myself an assistant for that – you’re way too limited with your logic skills to manage this sort of thing on your own.’
‘Wow, awesome! Congratulations! I’m going to the Auror office too, and Draco…’ He saddened. ‘Well, Draco is actually what I wanted to talk to you about.’
Draco instinctively reached to Harry and pulled him in. They ended up lying there, at the foot of Harry’s bed, with Harry’s face buried in the crook of Draco’s neck, their chests pressed together, legs entangled, Harry tightly wrapped in Draco’s arms.
- That I did. – He was still cold towards Harry after their lack of communication that morning. He didn’t want to get hurt by rejection. – What about it?
Even when the light went out, when all that was left was darkness around him, he knew it was still somewhere there – like it never was about the light itself, but about what it indicated. Like whatever it was reached him itself, because he couldn’t reach it on his own. Like the nothingness approached him, hugging him and slowly melting him away, one thick, black drop at a time. It might have hurt, but he was beyond the point where he could actually experience anything physical – he was just
- Yeah, I’ve known him since I was 14, he’s like a father figure to me. I come here every morning to hang out on my way back from work. Of course, Henry doesn’t know what I do, he’d throw me out if he knew. He thinks I’m a night receptionist at a hotel. You saw his attitude towards, well, our line of work.
It was almost three weeks after the assignment when a breakthrough happened. On a Saturday evening Ron, Hermione and Neville marched into Draco’s and Harry’s room, with solemn expressions, carrying several large, leather-bound volumes.
- No, Ron’s just being stupid. So what if you’re gay? I don’t care. My uncle is and he’s one of the funniest people I know. Of course, I’m kind of worried for you with the – Neville was visibly searching for words and Harry was starting to feel uneasy – other stuff, but that’s your choice. No one can tell you how to live your life, you know?
- Wait a minute, something doesn’t add up here. – Harry was looking at Draco and Nott warily. – You say Theo was the only person that could hurt you that much, but that’s not what he told me before. He said he’s not into violence in bed. So how come you came to him?
- WHAT?! – Draco was not sure if the sheer horror that swept over him was because of his privacy being violated or the idea that Potter was self-medicating based on a book he had no foundation to use safely.
- There’s nothing wrong with that, you know that? – Hermione didn’t seem to grasp what Harry was trying to say.
- It’s not that he was talking about… about that thing. It’s really not. I couldn’t care less if he was insulting me to my face about my past, I can handle that. It was the way he worded it, the way he directed it at Harry. – He looked at his boyfriend. – Harry, I’m sorry. I never meant for it to go that far, I just saw how he made you feel and I lost it. I can’t handle someone hurting you like that. I’m so sorry… I know you think I’m a monster right now, but I swear, that’s not me… - His eyes were starting to water, he couldn’t control the lump in his throat anymore. He knew what he did must mean loosing Harry and he couldn’t bear the thought of that.
‘I suppose. I’ve been looking at the paperwork and I might have some ideas.’ Harry noticed Ron’s confused expression. ‘I know I’ve left you to do all the groundwork, but it’s our joined case, you know. I’ve been doing some work of my own. As for this git, I think we best talk to Shacklebolt, he’s the one with authority, maybe he’ll find him a place in Azkaban for the time being.’
Harry made his way to the parlour where he thought Draco might be. Upon arriving, he asked Jeanelle if Yasmine was working. To his surprise, Jeanelle looked at him sadly and handed him a sealed envelope without a word.
- Oh, I thought you were going to work with Draco now that… - Neville didn’t finish that thought obviously abashed.
- Well, there is not much I can change about how I look – especially since I can’t just cast a glamour sitting here with you, Draco thought - so I suppose I’m going to have to work with what I’ve got.
‘Minister…’ He started quietly ‘I realize how this looks, but I assure you, all the secret storage rooms I knew about have been already opened. I have no idea what they found or where, but I’ve seen the house being emptied and there was nothing left as far as I knew…’
‘You’re getting a character reference from Hermione’ Harry smiled and hugged the blonde. ‘Oh, and we’re going to the Weasleys at 7 o’clock. Brace yourself though, once Molly warms up to you, you’ll be force fed and there will be no protesting.’
‘So what now? I’m supposed to go there and confront him or something?’ Harry didn’t know what to do.
- It is. – Harry smiled and leaned in. They didn’t even hear the others’ groans while they were kissing, Draco’s hands around Harry’s waist and Harry running his fingers through the blond hair. It was too sweet and intoxicating to even pay attention to their surroundings. But they had to pull apart eventually, there were still several issues to be discussed, and not all of them could wait until they were alone.
It was true – after the war, Harry has all but locked himself inside Grimmauld Place and refused any job that has been offered to him, deciding instead to live off of the contents of his Gringotts’s vault until he figured out what to do with his life. At first everyone seemed to be fine with it, but as the time passed, his friends began worrying about him, as he insisted on keeping to himself as much as possible – so much so, that they’ve even stopped inviting him to nights out, because they knew he’d refuse. Three years after the war only Ron and Hermione visited him regularly – Neville popped in from time to time to check on him, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley tried to drag him out to the Burrow for family celebrations, but other than them, Harry practically lost contact with the wizarding community.
- We’re not idiots, Potter. What the bloody fuck is going on anyway? If you’re here than what was that? – Dean looked just as confused as Seamus did.
In the middle of the room three people were leaning over something covered by a white sheet. Harry blinked and in the dim light of the room he recognized Ron, his Auror partner Jenkins, and Roberts. He stood rooted to the spot, eyes glued to the three figures who, by the looks of it, haven’t spotted him yet – this can’t be good.
- What are you talking about? What do I care about if you had a serious relationship before or not? I told you, I have feelings for you and that’s all that matters to me. Of course, I’ll have to take it into consideration, but we’ll go as slow as you’ll be comfortable with. I’ll wait for you, I promise.
He had no idea if Potter bought his lame excuse, but that wasn’t what was important right now. He needed to take care of his
happening between you and Malfoy lately, you know? If I didn’t know any better I’d think you’re into some shady business with him… or worse.’
- Take that back, Potter! – out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Nott standing up from the couch nearby and reach for his wand – Leave the guy alone or I swear to Merlin…
‘I’m thankful, Potter, but I highly doubt it. For one, I’m an ex-Death Eater and my parents are in Azkaban for life – not exactly qualities the Auror Office is looking for, I suppose. And for the other, how do you imagine me working with you if Weasley is your partner?’
‘And you want me to order Mr. Malfoy to be sent to Azkaban for an indefinite amount of time until you find this band of snatchers and manage to confirm Mr. Malfoy’s involvement?’
Suddenly, Draco was on his back on the floor, Harry on top of him, both of them lost in their second kiss. It was hungrier, more desperate than the first one. When Harry’s tongue slid across his neck, Draco pulled away.
‘So, Mr. Wesley…’ He said, looking at Ron. ‘you say you suspect Mr. Malfoy might be a part of this scheme you and Mr. Potter have been investigating?’
- Good God Potter, this is too advanced for your limited brain power! – Why was he insulting Potter anyway? – This is a manual for the Healer training! You’re barely scraping by in N.E.W.Ts!
‘Guys, stop.’ Neville took a step forward. ‘This is the worst situation to have a fight in. Malfoy, lead the way. Ron, shut up and follow.’ They all obeyed and soon they were climbing a wide marble staircase. By the time they were standing outside Draco’s bedroom door, they were out of breath.
Ok, so as you most probably gathered by now, I have zero knowledge of dom/sub relationships. This is just how I understand it - if any of you feel offended by my take on it, I sincerely apologize, and feel free to explain in the comments.
- But I have friends to help me figure things like that out. – That was a good enough lie for now. – You’d be surprised, but Slytherins are pretty good with the feelings stuff.
‘Don’t be dramatic, Weasley, it’s only three floors. And besides, I spent most of my time in my room anyway. Perks of having a house elf, you can have anything delivered.’ Harry noticed a faint tinge of pain in Draco’s eyes when he said it. Ron tried to push the door open, but it wouldn’t move. Rolling his eyes, Draco stepped in front of him and opened the door with ease. ‘I never liked people invading my space without permission.’ He shrugged.
‘You’re not a monster, Draco.’ Harry wiped his tears away. ‘They forced you to do this. If anyone knows how Voldemort really is, it’s me, and I know you had no choice. It doesn’t change my opinion of you.’
- No Hermione, let him talk. He clearly has things to say, better let him do it now so that I can go my way alone after this discussion is over.
- Who, not what. – Draco corrected him gently. – Ask yourself, if I were to tell you right now that I can, let’s say until the end of the weekend, take care of you, look out for you and guide you through everything, and you wouldn’t need to decide anything, would that sound good or bad to you?
came back to him. He looked through the window – there was a couple holding hands, kissing, clearly saying their goodbyes at the bus stop. Suddenly, Draco felt furious – this wasn’t fair! Life was not supposed to turn out that way, he wasn’t supposed to end up all on his own.
- Not talking to perverts, thank you very much. – Ron’s voice from inside the room sounded like a very poor attempt to cover up loathing with disinterest.
, you weren’t convicted and your parents have nothing to do with it. If anything, your perspective could be useful. And on top of that you, on your own practically, cracked the case neither me, nor Ron, had any idea how to solve. The office has been talking about it for weeks, everyone’s impressed with how you did it.’
‘I need to know your idea, Mr. Malfoy. This is privileged information and I cannot divulge it freely.’ The Minister’s suspicion was slowly morphing into curiosity.
- That? Oh, it’s nothing, just my band logo. I’m a rock singer by day, you see. – He tried to smile, but it was way more effort than he could manage right now.
‘You don’t actually believe this, do you? For one, it’s Lucius bloody Malfoy – he’s scheming, he’s conniving, he’s…’ Ron waved his arms ‘a
‘Not usually. But they’ve sent a crapton of paperwork, so I guess it wasn’t a quick job.’ He pointed to the kitchen counter. Indeed, there were several stacks of parchment.
I have to warn you again: More violence coming your way. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I wasn't planning on it to go that route, but it just happenned, I just can't make this story easy and fluffy right now (*hides*). But we're getting there, there is a chance for some fluff later on (if I don't change my mind again, that is).
‘Oh well, who do we have here…?’ Harry would recognize that snarl anywhere. ‘Fancy seeing you, Potter. It’s been what, five years?’
‘How do I function after this?’ Draco still not completely calm, but his expertise in compartmentalizing let him shove all he witnessed back into the darkest corners of his memory. ‘I don’t think about it. I just bag it up and pretend this never happened.’
‘I told you.’ Harry’s expression was gone in an instant and Draco felt a slight tinge of regret. ‘If you’re still up for it, I can talk to my boss and maybe try to get you a job there. I could use an assistant and you made a good impression on the Minister himself, so this might work out.’
Harry was twirling Draco’s wand, that Ron brought back, between his fingers. The hawthorn still felt good in his hand, still somehow felt like it belonged to him more than it did to Draco, maybe because he never actually won it back, Harry has just given it back to him after the war was over. But then again, it didn’t entirely make sense – he has disarmed dozens of wizards, both at school and during his career, and yet none of the other wands connected to him that way. There was never this feeling of warmth spreading through his fingers, up to his arm, when he was holding any other wand – he didn’t even have to cast any spells to know this was not the same. He never understood why, even though it jumped at him before, but Draco’s want felt almost like his own holly phoenix one – actually closer to it than the Elder Wand did for that brief moment he was using it. But the Elder Wand was different, he told himself, it was one of a kind so maybe the connection just didn’t work the same way as it did with normal ones. He never thought much about it, he was perfectly happy with his own wand, but now that Ron has retrieved Draco’s and brought it back, per Kingsley’s instruction, it struck Harry as odd.
- How do you even know it’s Draco? – Harry was desperately hoping everyone would just stop being so sure they know what they’ve heard.
Three days later the whole school was on the grounds, walking towards the platform in Hogsmeade to board the Hogwarts Express back to London. Harry was walking hand in hand with Draco, surrounded by Ron, Hermione, Pansy, Theo and Blaise. They were all talking and laughing, but Harry noticed Draco seemed distracted. He thought it must be difficult for him to be done with school and going back to his family home with his father not there, so he decided not to ask what was wrong in front of their friends.
until you crack the case.’ And with that, Kingsley left their office. All Harry could manage after being ordered to basically be Malfoy’s nanny for the foreseeable future was a very loud, and very work-inappropriate
‘In the matter of accused Scherback, Windsor Arthur…’ Minister’s voice was grave and serious. ‘…the verdict is: guilty. Sentenced to 10 years in Azkaban prison. In the matter of Drapel, Maurice Joyce - the verdict is: guilty. Sentenced to 10 years in Azkaban prison. In the matter of Knight, Peter Hover - the verdict is: guilty. Sentenced to 10 years in Azkaban prison.’ There was a pause. ‘Before I announce the verdict in the matter of Mr. Malfoy, I need to say a few things. Please escort the sentenced parties out.’ Once Draco was the only one left, Shacklebolt ordered him to sit down.
- You all right sweetheart? – He asked casually. Draco’s heart jumped up to his throat. He was desperately trying to not show how panicked he was.
- Are you completely sure? It might be uncomfortable at first, it might even hurt, and you’ve had a lot of firsts tonight.
‘Oh, thank you for your honesty…’ Ron sneered. ‘If you must know, he asked about the case and how much you involved Malfoy, and what parts of it did he figure out.’
‘Why? You want me to treat you like I would one of my co-workers all of a sudden?’ Potter was sceptical.
Riled up again, Harry stomped into the common room only to find it unusually crowded. It seemed like everyone was reading a notice from McGonagall that was posted on the message board. He managed to squeeze himself in the front of the group and read that the day after tomorrow was Hogsmeade Saturday. He briefly felt better, but the little happiness it gave him was gone the moment he turned around to push through the crowd and leave, only to bump into somebody standing behind him. Of course, Malfoy.
- Well, you could say that… - Draco didn’t want to have to invent a whole backstory for himself, but he realized he would have to. – I grew up in a very, uhm, sheltered community. I don’t really know much about Mu… modern London. – He hoped Mina wouldn’t notice his slip-up.
‘Sod off, Malfoy. It’s a difficult case and me being stuck here with you doesn’t help. If I was able to go into the office at least I would have someone to bounce ideas off of.’
- Yeah, that’s why I’m worried. Is he always like that? I mean, we’ve had our differences in the past, you know that, but I haven’t seen him that furious and threatening before.
- I couldn’t go through it again. And this time it was even worse than then, because I was the one to hurt you, not some other arsehole. And it was physical, not verbal. So I started drinking again, just like then, to try and forget, I think. And it all led to the same pattern as before. And I ended up with Theo because I knew if there was someone who would be able to fuck me up like I wanted to, it was him. I’m sorry, Theo, I really am. I never should’ve even come to you, let alone do the rest… - He looked at his friend apologetically.
And I'm sorry, but I just couldn't resist writing a little jab about You-Know-Who's nose, all the memes are too funny to just leave it out :D
- Yeah? So what has been the topic of conversation for the last hour? – Zabini looked far too content for Draco’s taste.
- Look, boy, I don’t know who do you take me for, but I’m not into – the man’s face twisted – your kind. I have a wife and I love her.
- Mate, falling for this git is not simple in itself… It’s the most bloody fucked-up thing you could tell me. And now you’re telling me it’s even more complicated than that?!
- Wow… I never knew he was that protective. I mean I know he’s loyal and he’ll do anything if he cares for you, but that? I never suspected he had it in him. But, if he was so into this Ravenclaw, how come nothing came of it? Draco was with this older guy in our 6
‘No, I didn’t. I really am innocent this time around, but what if they say I was a part of it? Fuck, I was so focused on actually finding the guys that I never even considered what they might actually do. Or say.’
- Easy for you to say, you didn’t just loose the love of your life. – Draco was slurring. They were both drunk, it was already their third bottle of alcohol that night.
‘Well, yes. He did get you involved in his work while you were a suspect, so that might be seen as conspiring – depending on how you look at it of course.’
‘To die. Well, not quite, it was beyond dying, it was like I was supposed to go there to make it like I never existed at all. And then I thought that the room sort of came to me and I was vanishing away…’
I was only two nights later when Ron spotted a tall, slender figure at the edge of the field. The woman was right – whoever this was, they certainly looked like they were alarmingly malnourished and sick. Observing the person, Ron determined that there was next to impossible for it to be Malfoy – there was no way he would look this bad, not even after almost two years in exile. Malfoy was a wizard, after all, and a pretty good one at that, no matter how much Ron didn’t like to admit it, so with his skillset he would surely figure out a way to at least obtain some food in survivable quantities. No, this person looked like they’ve been living off of the bare minimum and it showed – their skin had a nasty, ashy-green tinge and their chest and stomach (starkly visible in the moonlight, because the person was wearing only torn-up Muggle jeans that were clearly several sizes too big) were so wasted Ron could practically see the heartbeat through. When the person turned around and faced Ron (still invisible under his Disillusionment Charm) his (Ron has determined that the person was a male) face was sunken in, like the skin was stretched over the bode directly, without any muscles or fat in between. His eyes appeared bigger than they should, with heavy, dark bags underneath that looked almost black in contrast to the impossibly pale complexion. The only indication that the person was a living human being and not an Inferius were the lips – still full and red, slightly parted as he muttered something unintelligible under his breath, picking some herbs, arms elbow-deep in the tall grass.
- Guys, there is a situation… - Draco mentally scolded himself. There was no time to start with a lengthy introduction, he needed to act fast.
A week after his conversation with Ron, Harry decided he needed to talk to Draco and offer him help. He came to a conclusion that the best course of action was to give Draco keys to Grimmauld Place, since it wasn’t being used anyway, and a small position in the Auror office – he needed an assistant anyway, and if Draco was willing to come back and reinvent himself, his perspective might be useful.
‘Thank you, Minister. Mr. Potter, let’s start from the beginning. 18 months ago you informed the wizarding community that Draco Malfoy killed himself. Why is that?’
‘Actually, he hasn’t told anybody anything. Just that he has ran into you and you were in a very dark place. He wanted to help you get back on your feet, you know?!’
This was entirely Ron’s fault, Harry decided around 6 in the morning. If it wasn’t for Ron and his stupid hunch that Malfoy was somehow involved in the swindle, Malfoy wouldn’t be living with him right now and Harry would be happily straight and not… whatever his sexual orientation was right now.
have sex with Malfoy, he told himself again, Malfoy was a bloke and Harry wasn’t into blokes. He never even thought about guys that way, no matter who they were. He was 20 now, so if he was gay he surely would’ve figured it out by now – after all, he has seen his friends in the showers after Quidditch practices countless times, so if he really was into that sort of thing, something would’ve happened then. And this was why, no matter if the voice in his head was or wasn’t right, he sure as hell
‘I have nothing. Absolutely nothing.’ Harry sighed, throwing the last piece of parchment onto the pile. ‘I need coffee.’
- YOU HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING?! God, and I thought you two were going to be good for each other! You dumped Draco, he’s worse than ever, I haven’t seen him sober for days, and now he does THIS and you’re telling me you haven’t done anything?! How much of a thick, self-centred arsehole are you?!
‘As you wish, my love.’ Harry grinned. ‘I’m glad you found something in the Muggle world you enjoy. And they do sell this in bigger bottles.’
- Not necessarily. If they believe you, it’s actually an asset, because many men like what they call “fresh ones”, but it’s very common to just pretend you haven’t done it before, so the matrons ae weary of that kind of thing. You’ll have to be convincing.
‘No, no, that’s not what I’m talking about. I just need to know if Yaxley and Rowle cracking was because of the Veritaserum or if they talked on their own – my father will probably know which one was it, and I have an idea to use that, but I can’t risk blowing the whole story over this.’
‘That’s one way to do it. But then again, we don’t know if transfusion would actually do anything, this is just a theory, nobody has tried it, because wizards don’t do it. And on top of that, transfusion on a wizard would be incredibly complicated in itself and we would have to find a person that loves you enough for this to even have a chance…’
He rolled his eyes and began analysing everything that happened since he was marked by Voldemort. He had done it countless times before, but this time it was from a different perspective, so it took some time and effort. By the time he heard Pansy’s knocking on the door 20 minutes later, he reached the conclusion that he did, in fact, have feelings for Harry (somehow, just like a couple of days before, he couldn’t bring himself to refer to the ex-Gryffindor as “Potter”, not even in his own head). But what was he going to do about it? That would have to wait, for now there were more important matters at hand.
- I can’t wait to run my tongue along those, you know? – He was sure the lust was clearly visible in his eyes, but he didn’t care. Harry deserved to know just how much of an effect he had on him.
‘Yeah, but it says I need two. As amazing as you are, you’re just one person. And who do I go to for the other one? Nott? Pansy? Don’t make me laugh…’
- Hello Pansy. – Harry had lost all his concentration, so he reluctantly set the parchment down bracing himself to go find Hermione. After all, now was as good of a time as any. – Seen Hermione?
‘It’s nothing like that one, you know it. Treat it like a witness’s testimony – that’s essentially why you’re here, you’ve done nothing wrong.’
The rest of the journey was spent mainly with the two Malfoys listening to Harry explaining how the public transportation in the Muggle world worked. While they were still talking about trains and buses, everything seemed fine, but as soon as they moved on to planes, both Draco and his mother turned completely white.
‘Can you please explain this using something I’ll understand?’ Draco was trying to mask fear with impatience.
- Come on, you can tell me. We’ve been friends forever, if you can’t tell me stuff, who are you going to turn to?
‘I don’t know, never dwelled on that. I mean, I did have sex with several women, so if I’m not straight, I’d be bi. Why are we dissecting my orientation right now anyway? We were talking about your kink.’
- Yeah, it felt like a right thing to do. That’s what something like me should be treated, right? – All of a sudden Harry had a flashback to Draco correcting him when he referred to himself as “what” instead of “who”. It all clicked into place.
‘It isn’t, I’m at the Malfoy Manor with Draco.’ He wasn’t sure if Mrs. Wesley knew about their relationship, but telling the truth felt like the right thing to do.
‘I’m sorry… I know you don’t really want to be here, but you’re the only person that has a chance to help us if something goes wrong. We don’t know what’s in there.’
‘No! He never announced himself, he just stopped by whenever. Same as Ron and Hermione! Maybe he knew I’ve gotten the invitation and wanted to talk about it?’
‘What I mean is that even if Ron was right, and we were together, his attitude towards it makes no difference to me. I don’t select people I surround myself with on the basis of what Ron says about them.’
- What the bloody fuck was that? – The door to Dean’s and Seamus’ room opened and the two ex-Gryffindors ran into the common room. It was clear that every 8
‘I can, Mr. Weasley, and I just did. This is not your decision to make. And your refusal to obey by my orders on this, is precisely why you will be working with Mr. Longbottom from now on. Now, Mr. Potter, seeing as Mr. Malfoy will
- He claims he’s not. There is going to be a time for interrogation, hopefully, now go! – Draco all but pushed her through the door and turned around to return to his room. Nott was looking at him curiously.
Draco’s throat closed up. He couldn’t even force himself to look at any of the people in the room. He dropped his head and managed to utter only ‘I did.’
‘Because I told you I love you, you know it’s true, there’s no way to undo what I did, and you have no feelings for me. And you’re too much of a good person to just leave after what I said, because you’ll think I’ll hurt myself, so you’ll stay here to make sure I don’t, even if it’s the last thing you want.’
‘And why would the timing of Mr. Malfoy’s questioning change anything? Not that I object to the idea, frankly, it makes no difference to me, but I’m just curious as to what motivates you right now.’
- I didn’t need to. – Somehow Harry managed to gain control of himself and speak calmly. – Whatever is attached to you, is part of you or even next to you is as far from “fine” as it can possibly get.
‘And why exactly do you care?’ He reached for the bottle, but Potter caught his wrist – the skin underneath Potter’s fingers burned.
- Sir, I… - the words got stuck up in his throat. He was a Malfoy for God’s sake, Malfoys didn’t beg! – I was wondering if maybe I could exchange some labour for some bread. You see, I just came to London – it was safer to just pretend he came from somewhere else and that’s why he was sleeping on a park bench. After all, it wasn’t really that much of a lie, Muggle world was a very different place to where he used to live – and I haven’t got any money, but I really need some food.
‘Now that we know, we can react quicker. Plus, the use of magic in front of Muggles falls under the normal Wizarding Police, not the Auror Office. So knowing it’s connected to our case this way, we can take that and investigate those ourselves. As soon as something happens we can apparate straight there and make an arrest!’
‘It would make sense if not for that last one.’ Draco was sceptical. ‘Let’s assume you’re right – now, they come to Scotland, find that old lady. They wait some time and while they’re waiting they see me and they come up with the idea that I’m all the proof they need. But they still don’t know if the woman is a witch…’
- It was Ron. He… he lashed out. He said that I’m delusional, that you somehow got that idea in my head to take advantage of me.
Three days later, Harry, Draco and Narcissa woke up early, ate a hasty breakfast and set to travel to London completely relying on Muggle means of transportation. Draco was still convinced the idea was ridiculous, but he stopped complaining loudly when they were boarding the train from a nearby town. Since neither him, nor his mother have ever dealt with Muggle money (Harry considered himself quite insightful to pack whatever he had left over from years prior,
Twenty minutes later they were sitting on the floor of Harry’s living room. Draco and Ron were glaring at each other, a small bottle of Veritaserum, almost empty, tossed on the floor between them.
year, my first. You don’t know him probably, he was from abroad. Then I had a brief fling with Davies’ older brother, it lasted about 2 months somewhere in the 6
Harry spent his days battling the question what the bloody hell to do with Draco. As his shock and disgust cooled down, he realized Malfoy was in a rather pitiful situation and outing him right now wouldn’t be a good thing to do, but he still didn’t know if he should help him get out of Muggle London and back into the wizarding world. He was staring through his office window trying to decide what to do, when Ron’s voice brought him back to reality.
‘You can’t be sure!’ He was rising up from his bed, fuelled by increasing anger. ‘God knows what that shit was – it could’ve been Voldemort’s own invention for all we know!’
‘Do we have any other choice? You’ve been running around Britain like a maniac for three months and we have nothing!’
‘No, Ron didn’t tell them what it was for. He figured he couldn’t say anything without admitting it was your idea.’
- …but I don’t think it’s that. It kinda feels like I felt about Ginny back in the day. On some level at least.
It was only Saturday night that Draco was able to emerge from this thoughts enough to talk to his friends. They were all sitting in an otherwise empty common room.
But thinking of Ron, in whatever way, only reinforced Harry’s belief that it was completely his best friend’s fault that he was lying there, awake, dissecting his own sexual preferences, when there was no need for it. And that made him angry – at himself, at Ron, at Malfoy somehow. How many more bloody sleepless nights was he going to have until this whole ordeal was over? He sighed and got up. Anger was still bubbling in him, but there was nothing he could think of that would help. He was still tipsy from all the whisky, so he decided to go make himself a cup of coffee to hopefully sober up and figure this out.
connect Draco Malfoy and sex in any capacity? It wasn’t like they ever actually had sex – not on any practical or logical level. Yasmine was not Malfoy, she was a woman. Of course, for the first couple of months after Malfoy’s supposed death, Harry was plagued with nightmares of his last meeting with Yasmine, where Yasmine’s face suddenly turned into Malfoy’s, but it was only because of what happened after they were done – that much was evident from the second part of those dreams where Yasmine-Malfoy shot herself (himself? Harry didn’t even know anymore) in the head. Why this connection suddenly then? He worked through it, managed to rid himself of those nightmares, it was all behind him. Most days he didn’t even think about the memories that caused them – up until the point when bloody Draco Malfoy was back in his life once again. And now all the confusion and bottled up anger was seeping out of him again, doing things like this. He hated his own mind sometimes. He thought if he just tried hard enough to forget about all of it, to just focus on the fact that he had to deal with Malfoy being in his apartment, he would erase everything that happened over a year ago – like it wasn’t even real, like he dreamt it all, and like the reality was that Malfoy just ended up here solely because they needed him for a case and Shacklebolt was being a complete, unreasonable arsehole.
- Oh… - Mina’s eyes widened. – Are… are you considering it? There might still be other options for you, you know?
‘Assumptions are a dangerous thing, Potter…’ Suddenly, Draco was leaning towards him and all Harry could think of was how much he wanted those full lips on his own. Or on his neck. Or on whatever part of his body Malfoy would want them on. But all that happened was that Draco reached across Harry for a pack of cigarettes and lit one. ‘…you never know what’s in you, and you can have a very brutal awakening one day.’ Harry bitterly thought that this particular day has just came.
‘More or less…’ Ron coughed as another cloud of smoke from whatever Malfoy was indulging in filled the room. ‘What are you smoking anyway?’
- You didn’t need to do that, Draco… - Pansy said last Thursday right after they left the common room.
- Well, that’s settled then. We’re spending the summer in the Manor, you’re teaching my mother about Muggles and she’s teaching you to cook. – Draco grinned.
- Are you sure? You can stop me any time. I will not force you to do anything that doesn’t feel good to you.
– out as evidence, although we don’t know if they knew that you were a Death Eater or if it was just a coincidence.’
Harry felt the real, present-time Draco shaking looking at the scene. He took the blonde’s hand, linking their fingers together. It was cold as a corpse and trembling.
- He won’t. – Harry tried to seem certain. – He’s a coward, he knows if he puts one toe out of line, he’s out of here.
‘Where have they surfaced so far?’ Draco slid gracefully off the counter and crammed next to Potter on the couch, bending over a hastily drawn map. ‘Ok, so it seems like they’re steering clear from any big cities and communities with a large number of wizards… Now, do you have any dates? It might be useful to track when they went where, there might be a pattern somewhere.’
- No. – Draco was suddenly very firm. He caught Harry’s wrist not even an inch away from his cock. – Don’t.
- I never want you to feel that way again, Draco. I can’t even imagine it. I love you, you love me, we’re supposed to be happy, not hurt like that. And we will be. – It was the cue everyone else needed to leave. After they’ve shut the door behind them, Harry and Draco were left in the darkness, falling asleep holding each other like their lives depended on it. To both of them, they actually did.
‘What do you mean? Was Ron right, is there something between you two? He went completely off the rails last year, but that was when he thought you died, so I don’t know if conviction would end up doing the same to him…’
- Draco, we know, we told you that countless times already! You don’t need to try and hide it! – Pansy was clearly frustrated with him.
‘I think we best stick to canned cream for now, Draco…’ He said when he managed to compose himself. ‘That way we at least know what we’re eating.’
‘It does sound reasonable, Mr. Potter. Now, I shouldn’t really be even asking this, since it’s going to be an order, but – Mr. Malfoy, are you willing to comply by this arrangement?’
‘Once again: sod off, Malfoy.’ Harry was in no mood to talk to Draco right now, so he slammed the empty coffee cup on the counter and stormed off to take a shower.
- Say what, why don’t you take me the same way I took you and then we’ll think about having some more fun if you’re up for it? – Draco had to concentrate all his energy on not shoving his boyfriend’s face into the pillow and fucking him into the mattress.
‘All of it. I work from home now, so all the paperwork is there. Draco’s actually been helping us, well, me, figure it out.’
- Yeah, he’s a sucker for compliments. I asked him not to do anything about it, the child was too freaked out by the effects to ever try that again. He promised to keep his mouth shut.
And so, following his best friend’s request to be left alone, a month later Ron was by himself on an assignment somewhere in the middle of nothing in northern Scotland. He was tracking a particularly tricky band of snatchers that seemed to specialize in convincing elderly wizards that they needed their (obviously paid) protection because Death Eaters were on the rise again – ridiculous idea, Ron concluded, given that most of them were either in Azkaban or dead, but nevertheless it was a matter to be dealt with, and since it proved to be too difficult for the ordinary magical police force, the task fell to the Auror Office, no matter how much beneath his skillset and job description Ron found it.
They both got their new robes (Harry’s in black and Draco’s, obviously, in deep, emerald green) and headed back towards the bookstore where they left Narcissa. This time, all three of them opted to apparate back home – the day was too eventful to battle Muggle transportation again.
- But… What of he tries to hex you? You know this git will sooner or later stoop to that! – Ron was getting worked up.
Draco turned around. He couldn’t get enough of the Gryffindor’s body. Harry was shorter than him by a good couple of inches, much more muscular and his skin was not as smooth as Draco’s – where the blonde’s body was covered by what seemed to be endless stretches of finest ivory silk, Harry’s chest and arms were covered in countless cuts and battle scars. Draco took the sight in, running his fingers along some of the biggest scars, biting his lower lip.
- Oh, she might have inherited some of her father’s money! – Draco exclaimed. – She’s a Black, they were loaded and she had 2 sisters, so it might still add up to something!
, he thought, realizing that whatever happened back at the Manor must have not killed him, or he wouldn’t be there. Then, as soon as the idea that he was, in fact, still alive, sank in, everything else came back – slicing his forearm, opening the door and that horrible realization that everyone he ever loved or cared for, was no longer there. Was it real or was it all of it just in his head? He looked at his arms and screamed – his right wrist was still burned badly, but his other arm was what was worse: the cut he made was opened up, the skin at its edges looked like it was melting away. Did it mean that whatever he experienced, all the thoughts he had back in his old bedroom, were a reality? He didn’t have a chance to try and decipher this, because his scream alerted a nurse who was now rushing towards him.
‘You mind if I join you?’ It was more of courtesy than a question, Harry was going to stand in that window and smoke, no matter what Malfoy said.
Not only has he been seen sobbing like a child on the floor, begging for drugs, but he was ready to sell himself, yet again, to Potter of all people, to survive. And somehow this was worse than when he actually did it over a year before – because this time there was no tricking, there was no Yasmine, it was clearly and undeniably him, in his own skin. His brain, seemingly on its own accord, decided to torture him with a mental image of Potter’s reaction when he found out who Yasmine really was, side by side with the memory of Draco being just left there last night. Last night was incomparably worse, that much Draco knew for sure. And then, out of nowhere, Weasley’s face, painted with utter shock and horror, swam into his head:
- Draco, what are you saying? – Harry didn’t even see his tears coming. – God, Draco, please, don’t tell me you’re about to say what I think you’re about to say… Please, don’t do it… We can work things out, we now know what we’re up against…
‘What are you getting at? You’re trying to find out if I’m into you?’ Draco laughed, but there was some undertone there that Harry couldn’t decipher.
‘I suppose. But you’d have to learn a lot of stuff before you’re actually allowed behind the wheel. Now, let’s go find the Cauldron!’ Looking at Narcissa’s still worried expression, Harry realized he never actually explained how he was going to get them safely to the other side. ‘See those wide stripes going across the road? That’s where you cross. And those lights up there tell the drivers that they need to stop because people are coming through.’ They reached the crossing and Harry pointed out the pedestrian signal. ‘When that one turns green, the one above us, for the cars, will turn red. Red means stop, green means go, so we get a go ahead to cross while the drivers are told to stop and wait. It’s all connected and it happens automatically. Do you understand?’ Narcissa nodded, but she was still clutching Harry’s jacket fearfully.
‘I’m not having a problem with you and him! Do whatever you want, you can shag in the office for all I care.’ Ron shrugged. ‘What I do have a problem with is you somehow convincing everyone around you that him working here is a good idea.’
(as he began to call it), it was obvious from the number of returning clients. And the second time Potter came to him, he chose Yasmine over Normani, so rationally, he must have been at least better than her. The evidence was compelling, it was all backed up by cold logic and reason – so why was he seemingly being burned from the inside ever since Potter blurted it out? If it was not shock, what was it? He already knew it was not love, this he figured out some time ago, and hatred didn’t fit well with his symptoms. Once again, he rationalized that it must be loneliness. It was perfect – he was completely alone in the world and the thought that he made someone else feel good enough to register it as the best sex of their life was just a reminder of the time he had those kinds of relationships. Any kind of relationships in fact.
‘Ok, ok, a hard-on. But nothing came of it and nothing will, and I’ve never even fantasized about a bloke, so I’m assuming I’m straight and that was just a fluke.’
‘As ready as I’ll ever be’ Draco smiled back and they went into the house ready to begin their new life together.
The judges stood up and retired to a small chamber next door. Harry knew it was a custom for them not to wait with the sides of the case in the corridor, so it was going to just be him, Ron, Draco, and whoever was assigned to watch over Malfoy, there. Harry stood up. He was still seeing white and he needed to get out of that room as soon as possible, before he would do something really, really stupid, like punch Ron in the face. He opened the door and all the fury left him in an instant, as soon as he saw Draco standing there, white as a sheet and clearly terrified. Harry realized he must have heard all the screaming at the end of his deposition. In a blink of an eye, Harry went from absolutely livid to horrified. He knew his outburst at Ron might have just sealed Draco’s fate – nobody was going to believe them now that Ron got it in the judges’ heads that there was something between them.
‘Oh, Drakey, you’ll always be my little baby boy. What took you so long anyway? I was worried sick!’
- Oh yes. Forgive me, I’m still pretty new here and I haven’t yet seen a man so handsome. – Distracting the clients with compliments usually worked, so that was Draco’s best bet. He was frantically scrambling for some plan of action, since it quickly became apparent that facing one of the most prominent figures of his long-gone, past life, meant he couldn’t fall back on his usual disassociation between himself and Yasmine. No, he was Draco Malfoy tonight, and Draco Malfoy was a woman.
‘…and there is nothing between me and him. And there will be nothing. Why do you have a problem with it anyway?’
‘Certainly, dear! I see him very often in the field by the forest – if you follow the same road we met on you’ll find the correct one, it’s around a mile from here. If you want to catch him, you best camp out there around midnight – sometimes he comes out then and sometimes I notice him at dawn, so you might to spend the night there. He’s tall, very thin, like he’s hardly eating anything, and pale – very, very pale. Oh, and he has blonde hair, almost white, but a little more silverish. Really, he would be quite handsome if he didn’t look like he was halfway to death…’ She continued on, but Ron’s mind was spinning. No, it wasn’t possible, Malfoy was dead. And even if he wasn’t, what would he be doing in some God forsaken end-of-the-world village in Scotland that seemed to have been forgotten by the whole world?
‘I never said this, Mr. Potter. I said that you have to ‘keep an eye’ on Mr. Malfoy until his involvement in the case, or lack thereof, is conclusively determined. That, in turn, means, that regardless of the order of interrogations, Mr. Malfoy is to be watched over until all the depositions are collected.’ Harry turned white. So they weren’t going to let him listen to the snatchers’ testimonies!
‘Didn’t feel appropriate. He doesn’t need to know that. And I figured you wouldn’t want anyone else to know.’ Potter looked down.
- Oh God, you’re both insufferable! – Pansy groaned. – Not even a year together and you’re arguing like a married couple!
‘But you said so yourself, once he starts bleeding normally, it means the dark magic is gone, right? So there would be no interaction.’
‘Dying.’ He didn’t even try to fight it this time, he knew that as long as Veritaserum was working, he wouldn’t manage to lie.
Shacklebolt cleared his throat, breaking the moment. ‘Mr. Weasley, Mr. Longbottom, regardless of what we’ve seen so far, I do feel we need to go back and investigate Mr. Malfoy’s history further. I’m sorry to say, but however eye-opening what we’ve witnessed so far has been, it doesn’t aid our case – I hope you don’t take this against you, Mr. Malfoy…’ he addressed Draco hesitantly.
‘Literally nothing. There were incidents of performing magic in the presence of a Muggle, although we can’t track what that magic was or who performed it, the wands were either unregistered or they belonged to dead people.’
Back in London, Draco was still spread over Harry’s couch, lost in thought. He knew he went too far for his own good last night, but he never expected this sort of behaviour from Potter, not after his immediate reaction. True, they were both drunk, but that has never stood in a way of honesty when it came to that sort of thing – in fact, it usually helped. So if Potter was okay with what they did last night, why would he do a complete 180 in the morning?
That was not what Harry just got worried about. Somehow the whole topic of past relationships slipped out of his mind completely until now. Of course Draco has had boyfriends before, that was obvious, but up until that point, the thought hadn’t registered with Harry. He was rapidly approaching panic mode. What now? Did Draco suspect that he was his first serious partner, let alone boyfriend? How would Harry tell him that? Will he back out if he knows? And what about sex? It was safe to assume that Draco’s first time was long gone, but Harry was still a virgin and he wasn’t even sure how sex between two guys was supposed to look like. That last thought caused a bitter chuckle. He was 18, by all means an adult, and his whole sexual education were crude jokes tossed around the Gryffindor dorm and some magazines he found in the cupboard under the stairs back at Dursleys when he was moving out – all of that obviously very heterosexual. He was screwed. It was Draco’s worried voice that snapped him back to reality.
‘Oh, excuse me for disturbing!’ Potter’s mocking tone was getting on his last nerve. ‘If it makes you feel any better, you’re disturbing me more than I’m disturbing you. I’ve got paperwork to do and I’ve got nowhere to do it, since you’re occupying my couch.’
‘I wanted to tell you, but you made so much fuss over us arriving home after dark that I didn’t even have a chance! And how do you even know I did it and not Harry?’
‘Harry…’ Draco dropped to a whisper. Harry felt a sudden wave of warmth inside him. All he could do, however, was move his hand again. ‘He can hear us!’
Someone had to be assigned a room with a student that used to be a different house. And that student sadly had to be a Gryffindor, since both Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws returned in even numbers. – she explained like she was speaking to a child.
On the other side of the door, Harry was not sleeping either. All is previous determination to not dwell on the ‘did I have sex with Malfoy’ issue was gone the second he remembered pressing himself against the blonde’s back. Why exactly did he do this? He could’ve just as well passed him the parchment. And why did he lean on Draco that second time? There was no logical reason for it.
‘I’m fine with it, Minister, but I would like to make a request if possible – can I, instead of home office, just take a vacation leave? I think this case proved I shouldn’t be working from home if other people are there.’
They all laughed. When they finally arrived at Waterloo station some 90 minutes later, Narcissa was looking a bit apprehensive.
- Of course! I’ve been pulled out from being homeless by people, so I’m trying to repay the debt. – She looked at him with a sort of affection you’d expect from someone looking at a lost puppy. Draco winced at being spoken to like that, but he decided it was better not to offend Mina.
‘See those stripes on the ground? And those signs by the side? That’s how they know where the lanes are and which goes where. There is a whole course in Muggle driving, you need to pass an exam and get a special permission to go on the road. It’s surprisingly safe if you follow the rules.’
‘Ma… Malfoy?!’ He managed after a while. It turned out that there was in fact a Dark Mark on the man’s arm, fully on display now.
Draco didn’t think it was even possible he could loathe himself any more than he already has. And yet, there he was, several hours later, back in his male body, in the shower of Mina’s apartment, scrubbing himself for the third time. Why did Harry fucking Potter have to come to see him of all the sex workers in London? Scratch that, he didn’t even classify himself as a ‘sex worker’ right now. He was a whore. It didn’t even help that tonight alone he made enough money to put down a deposit on a small studio apartment he’d been eyeing for the past week. If anything, it made it even worse. Right now, his only hope was that Normani would return and Potter would go back to his favourite girl and leave Draco be.
- Well, that’s rather obvious given what we’ve just heard, isn’t it? – Seamus looked like he was quickly starting to regret coming into the common room.
Safely back in his bedroom, Harry threw himself onto the bed and buried his face into a pillow. The confession he just blurted out without thinking burned like molten metal. Why exactly did he say this? It’s not like he has ever even thought about who his best sex was with. And even now, once he had the chance to consider this question a little more, the answer he gave made no sense. Not only did he never felt what Draco said sex should feel like, but even within his limited scope of experiences what they had was average at best. He had had much more intense orgasms with several girls, and what Draco, no – Yasmine, did, was far from what Normani was capable of. He was being stupid, he thought, it was just residual hatred he still must have had stored away somewhere, that just came out, purely to mess with Malfoy’s head, acting on instinct.
‘No. You shouldn’t even be doing this in the first place, but if you’re set on it, we’re doing this in the apartment. It’ll be safer.’
He sighed and turned onto his back, staring at the ceiling. Why was he suddenly calm and collected? The thought that Yasmine didn’t exist should’ve been enough for him to be throwing up by now – after all, once you accept (or even think) that, the only logical conclusion would be that he, in fact, had sex with Draco Malfoy. And that some part of his masochistic brain registered that as the best sex of his life. But he didn’t
‘WHAT? Draco, no! You can’t do this!’ Harry was mortified. He knew Ron and he knew this was the worst idea ever.
‘Oh, but you must be mistaken my dear! They were certainly sure they’ve seen one of the You-Know-Who’s former allies camped out in the next village over! They said he has a Dark Mark! And after what they’ve told me, I’m sure I’ve seen this particular young man several times around here – you know, when I was picking up herbs in the fields – he most certainly lives somewhere close!’
‘And what if they don’t find the intent in there?’ Draco didn’t want to even think about Harry getting fired because of him.
Harry was hurting, both physically and mentally. What happened in the shower could’ve easily been considered completely Draco’s fault, but Harry felt like he was equally to blame for it as his boyfriend was. He should’ve told Draco to slow down, that they were going too fast for him. At this point, he wasn’t even sure if he initiated moving past blowjobs because he really wanted it for himself, or because that was what he thought Draco wanted. Harry shook his head. He was torn between completely blaming himself for the whole situation, like he deceived his boyfriend to gain something (although he really didn’t know what) and being afraid of him after what happened. It didn’t help that his brain decided (completely on its own accord) to replay Nott’s words from the Great Hall. “I’m just not into as heavy stuff as Draco is… I’m just not into as heavy stuff as Draco is… I’m just not into as heavy stuff as Draco is…” – If that was what their first time together has led to, Merlin knows what Nott really meant by “heavy stuff”. Was Draco lying when he said he wasn’t a violent person? And if he was telling the truth and he wouldn’t consciously want to hurt anybody (somehow Harry managed to push the other option out of his mind, for now) was this a testament to the possibility that he had problems controlling himself? It was one thing to deal with his outbursts when they were caused by anger, like they were with Ron and Dean, but it was completely different when it was with Harry, whom Draco was supposed to love and take care of. And exactly how far would that aggression go? Harry registered bitterly that it was obvious that Draco wasn’t above killing someone when blinding fury overtook him, what he did to Dean proved that, but what if lust had the same effect? He was too afraid to think about it. God, how he wished he had someone to talk this over with! But he was alone in this – he knew the Slytherins weren’t the ones to go to with this sort of dilemma and for now he didn’t really want to confront Draco, not before he made up his mind at least on what it was he was feeling exactly. He desperately needed Hermione now – he knew she would be the only one that could help him and that he could trust her completely. But now, even she wasn’t speaking to him.
- Oh, I am. I’m just not into as heavy stuff as Draco is. – How he managed to state that so matter-of-factly, Harry had no idea.
‘Excuse me, miss, have you perhaps heard about the Auror Office?’ It was his standard opening line designed to identify witches and wizards.
- SO FUCKING WHAT? Am I wrong here? Is he not just a waste of oxygen for everyone around him? And to have the fucking audacity to show his bloody face here after all he’s done!
‘Because I don’t trust you! Harry’s perfectly capable of defending himself if you decided to do something to him, but if you start meddling with our work, that’s going to be tougher to prevent. I’m still not convinced you are innocent of those swindle charges.’
‘No. He’s not dead, but…’ Hermione was still looking at her hands in her lap. ‘He’s really out of it. They’ve put him into a coma, but nobody knows what’s going to happen. He cut his hand with a broken vial, on accident, and some potion got into his blood. We don’t know what it was and what damage it did, but the guys thought you were both gone when they got you back here…’
Draco was back on the windowsill again. Why exactly did Potter’s confession shock him like that? He knew he was good at
‘And how exactly are you planning on achieving this ambitious goal?’ Draco was quickly getting irritated with Potter.
‘So they’re just filling him up to his eyeballs with whatever?!’ Draco was screaming. ‘He’s not a lab rat!’
- I don’t know, all right?! – He was yelling again. – It all just came out of me last night, like something broke! What are you getting at anyway?
‘Maybe, but…’ Harry didn’t know how to finish this sentence. He knew if he said what he really wanted to say, this conversation and all what they’ve built with both Draco and Narcissa, would come crumbling down.
‘I know, Mrs. Wesley. And I’d really like to change that at some point – you’ve always been like a mother to me, so it would mean a lot to me if you could stand by us…’ He was interrupted by Ron and Hermione rushing in. Molly saw them, sent Harry a slightly saddened smile and left.
‘Well, I think he’s not.’ Hermione interjected. ‘Think about this: Malfoys have been cleared of all charges, so there is really no tangible reason not to employ them. If Kingsley refused, they would make a huge fuss over it – accusations of discrimination at best. And it could even lead to a court case. And on top of that, with Lucius in the Ministry, at least Kingsley now has a way of keeping an eye on him.’
Draco couldn’t sleep that night. Why was every Potter’s touch burning him? Well, that much was obvious, he thought, it was still the lust that has resurfaced days prior. And the fact that it didn’t lead to an erection (
“Oh, God…” – that was all he could manage. Harry seemed to understand, because he laid down beside Draco and smiled, drawing circles on his chest with the tips of his fingers. They stayed like this for a while, just looking at each other. There was no need for words, they understood each other completely, like their whole lives were just a build-up that always had to lead to this moment in time, so when Harry turned around, Draco knew what it meant, and somehow all the fear and hesitation was gone.
- Since when do you even take into consideration how I’m feeling? – Harry had to concentrate very hard to not ask Ron why on Earth would he take his feelings into consideration when his happiness didn’t hurt anybody.
‘There is nothing to tell! I got it, I saw Ginny is getting married, I haven’t even bothered to check who her fiancé is, I got upset and went out. When I came back, you were there.’
‘Potter, how on Earth do you taste like cherries?’ He cocked his head to the side. ‘You’ve been drinking Firewhisky, not some liqueur…’
At any rate, do let me know what you think! Like I said, this is my first fic and I'll be really grateful for tips of what you liked and what you didn't!
- So, I gather, you feel better performing than being performed on? – Draco was slightly amused with his boyfriend’s enthusiasm.
‘Miss, we have received several pieces of information about a group of people travelling all over the country, promising protection against Death Eaters in exchange for a rather large sum of money. Have you been approached by them?’ He didn’t really have much faith by now, but there was no harm in trying.
year was sound – normal people look for glory, not run away from it, so it was only logical he would look for it too. Only weak people looked for someone to take responsibility for their actions. Was the Sorting Hat correct all those years ago? Was he better suited for Slytherin? He was no Gryffindor, that was for certain – Gryffindors were supposed to be brave and all he wanted for a long time now was for someone else to take care of him for a change. God, how much more pathetic could he get? The only comforting thought was that now that Voldemort is gone, nobody was ripping into his brain gaining access to his every thought. Oh, the Daily Prophet would’ve had a field day with this! “The Chosen One is secretly a weak freak!”. “Freak”. This one word has stuck for some reason. “You’re a freak!”, “Nobody thinks like you”, “What the hell is wrong with you?”. He repeated those questions in his head for Merlin knows how long, until a loud screech of an owl brought him back to reality. No, he can’t think like this. He needs to find something else to focus on or he’ll wake up screaming after yet another nightmare.
- I-I’m not gay! – Harry was visibly flustered. – And if anything, no body part of yours qualifies as the “fine” category!
‘Then make some room on that sill.’ Harry had no idea why he all of a sudden wanted to sit opposite Draco, there was clearly not enough room for two people there. But it came out and Malfoy was already taking his legs off the windowsill to make room for him.
He closed his eyes. It seemed like the decision has made itself. There would be no Draco Malfoy anymore – or at least, no body occupying the Earth under the name, because Draco Malfoy, a person, was long gone at this point anyway.
‘It looks like a lot of fun actually, I might get to it at some point. I mean, no harm in at least trying, right?’
Diagon Alley looked like a Muggle photograph. People stopped dead in their tracks, in complete silence, looking at the three figures that just arrived. It was obvious nobody was expecting The Chosen One to show up with two of the most famous ex-Death Eaters. Narcissa stood rooted to the spot, while Draco made a move that seemed like he wanted to turn around and run from the place. Harry raised his head high and wrapped his arm around Draco.
Draco smirked bitterly to himself – oh, if only… Everything would be perfect, wouldn’t it? There would be no pain, no humiliation…
- Fine, if you’re not willing to reach out to him, I will. – Hermione stood up, determined. – I just need to figure out what he might have used that we won’t think of.
‘Harry, you really need to try and go back to normal.’ Hermione was (yet again) trying to convince Harry to go see a therapist.
So there he was. On Potter’s couch somewhere in London, wishing he was dead. He has never gone that far in his spiral. In the Muggle world, he was determined to do whatever it took to survive, to build himself a new life – even after he thought everyone knew what he had become, there was still a chance to hide somewhere and avoid the judgement of the community. And once he did run, he found solace in the drugs – they kept his own mind dulled down, making it impossible to dwell on what his whole life turned into, even if he wanted to (not that he did, he wasn’t a masochist). But now he was forced to resurface from his exile, stripped not only of any dignity that might have lingered somewhere adjacent to him (because it for sure didn’t feel like it was in him), but also from the only thing that somehow help him just exist out there in the world (after all, what he had out there, in the middle of nowhere in Scotland, could hardly be classified as ‘life’). There was nothing left for him here – even if he was to disregard his most current state and not count the pathetic Draco Malfoy-shaped vessel he’d been reduced to, his future didn’t exactly seem that much more optimistic. He was either going to be found guilty of being a part of some scheme he had nothing to do with and sentenced to Azkaban, or he was going to be declared innocent and let go – but to where exactly? Once again, he had no place to live and nothing to his name. Scotland was out of the question, now that Weasley knew where to find him, and going back to the Muggle world didn’t seem like much of an option either – his encounter with Potter taught him it was far too easy to be found there. Once again, he was treated to a memory of what Weasley said the other day: last year Potter apparently wanted to help him. He scoffed – like that would be a viable option! No, there was no chance. He refused to sink any further and accept charity (
- You really believe this? – Ron didn’t seem convinced. – You need some defences! Some shield charms at the very least! I’ll write to Bill, he’s a curse breaker, maybe he can lend us some ideas how to deal with this tosser!
Harry turned around to face his friends. Ron and Hermione looked worried, a couple of feet away Neville seemed like he’d been Stupefied.
- And what do I care? – Ron looked at her in disbelief. – That’s not my problem. He could fling himself off of the Astronomy Tower for all I care.
‘Don’t make me laugh, Weasley. I happen to know you have an unofficial stash in here that nobody tracks. Or, if you’re too afraid, I still have some contacts that can obtain some any given moment – that is, if you’re not scared of me…’ The smirk he said it with was terrifying – for the first time Harry thought that maybe Ron was onto something with nit trusting him.
