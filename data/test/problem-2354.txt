“Potter. Really.”
Draco caught Harry’s wand mid-air and batted the Death Eater’s wand away. Before the wand had even clattered to the floor, the Death Eater was incapacitated and the other Death Eater began to run away. Draco had him incapacitated and on the floor in a matter of seconds.
golden now, sun-stained from his years of outdoor work. He couldn’t remember when he had grown his hair out exactly; it was sometime after his father had died. He found that he liked pulling it back into a messy bun during a dig to keep it securely out of his face. His skin was a little more sun-tanned as well, although his time at the museum in London had already started him back on the path to pale. He lifted his dark dragon-leather satchel over a shoulder and stepped off the train, feeling like a giant as children eagerly scurried around him.
Draco sat down in his usual seat beside the door. Eventually, everyone else filtered in--everyone except Potter, anyway--and sat down, leaving Potter’s seat and the two seats on either side of Draco as empty as usual.
Harry, this version wasn’t that man
The dementors were pulled into the blinding light as quickly as they had appeared. The chorus of their whispered shrieks echoed around the empty ballroom and Draco cringed against the miserable sound. Then the dark portal in the ceiling was spinning. Shrinking. Shrinking down to the size of an orb. Until it

for the down to fully absorb a failed antidote potion before a reaction of that nature could take place. He had assumed that James Potter would have returned to his room within that span of time. And if he hadn’t, it could only mean that James Potter did not return to his room that night when he was supposed to. Draco opened his mouth, and then closed it again. “Your son was reckless. He disrespected my authority, and disrespected his Potions partner. I refuse to ignore poor behavior simply because his surname happens to be Potter.” Draco turned and kept walking.
It was one night.
“How about your brother and sister?”
Right?
“Hello, Professor Malfoy!” Lily called smilingly.
“Mmm. Now you’re getting it.”
Harry stopped breathing entirely as Draco maneuvered the zip down to its base flipped his trousers open. Harry inhaled sharply through his nose as Draco pressed his palm over Harry’s erection through his pants. “Draco...”
He stirred.
"They're safe," Draco assured Harry, not lifting his mouth from Harry's skin. "James, Albus, Lily. They're all safe."
Draco just clutched Harry and buried his face against his warm chest, giving a small grunt in response.

...Wasn’t it?
He and Harry stared at each other in the dark, a million unspoken things between them, until Draco's eyelids grew heavy.

When Draco awoke alone in a tangle of sheets, he was briefly horrified that Harry had abandoned him. But Harry was standing in the kitchen, reading a newspaper and sipping at a cup of tea. “You left,” Draco complained, already hungry to touch Harry again. “Why did you leave?” Even in bed, Draco could read that the front page was nothing but headlines from the night before.
“Alright?” Draco asked, wishing to keep Potter safe in his levitation spell until Potter had found his footing.
him again. He felt like he was being ripped apart, and yet Potter’s hand felt like the anchor keeping him together. “I’m calling a Healer.”
Harry was watching him with gentle eyes, his expression a pleading question. Draco felt himself relax as the worried, crumbling pieces of his heart molded themselves back into place. Harry didn't look angry. He looked...
“Shit! Fine! But if it doesn’t work within five seconds we’re going to St. Mungo’s!” Granger crossed the room and dipped the dropper into Potion Eight. She returned to his side, pressed the dropper against his lips, and tried to force his jaw open enough to let the drops slide into his mouth. He focused again, trying very hard to loosen his jaw. His muscles felt like they were cracking, but his mouth opened. It was such a small movement that Granger probably couldn’t even

Two Aurors offered more of a chance than Draco had alone, but three wands against twelve Death Eaters were still no odds at all. Draco needed to separate them.
Draco could feel himself cringing as Potter called his name. Draco kept walking. Maybe Potter would give up and leave him alone. Potter appeared a few feet ahead of Draco, hovering on his broom. “Join us? Four would make for two even teams. I’m trying to help Lily and James improve their Seeker skills.”
She smiled at him from her wooden chair.
He had a party to attend.

And then, there he was.
Draco still walked around the battlements like usual, keeping watch while Potter walked along the edge of the Forbidden Forest or along the lake or around the castle moat. The nights were getting colder, but Draco didn’t mind. He liked the cold air and if it ever became too much, he cast some warming charms. Draco folded his hands behind his back, watching Potter walking near the Quidditch pitch. He noted how well he knew the mannerisms of Potter’s gait even from so far away. He was so focused on Potter, he was more than a little surprised when he collided with someone.

entirely been the alcohol after all. Well, Draco was doomed. There would be no going back from this. With one stupid, half-arsed kiss, Potter had ruined him for the rest of his life. Ruined him for anyone else. Brainless twit.

How could Potter not see that?
Draco had expected to be overwhelmed by a looming sense of oppressiveness the instant he stepped through the entry doors, but the feeling never came. It was just a house. A clean, empty mansion of a house. It could hardly be blamed for every barbarous thing that took place beneath its roof.

Any single one of them could be what he was looking for, perhaps with the exception of 3, 4, and 9.
But the room was still too silent.
Merlin, Potter was actually letting him go through with this. Draco brushed a thumb over one of Harry's nipples as he traced his tongue along the top of Harry’s spine, involuntarily thrusting his hips once against Harry's lower back. Soon Harry was bucking up into his hand, his chest heaving as he gasped for breath. Draco bit down at the base of Harry’s neck and
Harry stepped forward. With the wrong foot. Halfway into a measure. In the middle of a beat.

Granger looked thoughtful. “Well all of us were thinking about something with very direct purpose. Something to accomplish. What opportunities would be available to--”
“Oi!” Weasley called from the door. “You coming back out, mate?”
Draco ran back to the potions classroom. Maybe if he stood in the exact same spot where he had entered this vision and wished himself back…?
“No! Nothing like that.”
“She didn’t hurt you though?” Draco almost hated himself for asking, but he had to know. He couldn’t stand the thought of Potter going home with anyone who wanted to hurt him. He couldn’t stand the thought of Potter in pain, especially when all Potter had probably wanted that night was to be held. And Draco had often found himself lonely enough to know exactly what that felt like.
“I know!" Harry said, his voice tight and tense. He let out a breath and when he spoke again, his voice had returned to a gentle whisper. "I know. I thought you were...that you had...I’m sorry.” Harry lifted his hand and pressed it gently against Draco’s face, touching Draco's jaw and lip, where the hurts that Harry's fist had once left had long since healed. Draco stepped away before he could be seduced by the golden warmth he so desperately missed. By the

sort of look, and Weasley visibly relaxed.
"A pain in the arse," Draco said mindlessly, wriggling his hips to try and urge Harry's fingers deeper. Harry was a delight in the arse, really, and that was the problem.
Draco smiled gleefully into his pillow, relieved that Potter couldn’t see his face. Draco nodded a final time. “Saved me again, Potter,” he said into his pillow after Potter left.

wanted to kiss that mouth. And Potter, his eyes still dark and glossy and undoubtedly staring at Draco’s lips, tilted his head up toward him, his eyes almost pleading. Although it may have started as a game, Potter's reaction was most certainly not pretend. The room began to spin, although Draco wasn’t sure if it was from the alcohol or the fact that he had Potter so close, where he
But what other option did he have?
“With Hermione, Rose, and Hugo, making their way outside. Brilliant call with that walking stick.”
On a cold January day, the students and faculty finally returned. Draco planned to skip dinner that night, not ready to encounter anyone yet. In the months before the holiday break, he had nearly forgotten what it was like to be alone. He had forgotten how much work he could accomplish when he was alone. He had forgotten how much he even enjoyed being alone. It was lonely, and miserable, and wonderfully familiar. He didn't want Harry to ruin it.
Oh, he

?” Draco stood, anxiety swirling through his gut. “Are you alright?” Potter was crossing the room, moving straight toward Draco as if he had no control of his own two feet. He was close. Closer. Too close. Far too close. Something was wrong. Something was terribly, terribly wrong. Draco gently pressed a hand against Potter’s chest, trying to steady him, trying to keep him in place. Potter was only inches from Draco’s face, and Draco intended to keep him at a distance. “Say something.” But then Potter leaned forward and kissed the corner of Draco’s mouth. It was short and simple and soft and sweet, but Draco dropped his hand and stepped back until his calves were pressed against the edge of the bed, feeling completely undone. Unnerved. Unfastened. Unmade.
His thoughts went back and forth, back and forth, the entire miserable holiday.
“Take James and find Lily and Albus and
Lily marched over to Draco, her lips pursed out to her nose in an unhappy pout. She reluctantly handed him a box of Bertie Botts, then kicked Draco in the shin and ran out of the room before he could even say “ow.”
“Morning, Draco,” Cornelius had muttered without even looking up. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about--” Draco had stumbled toward the door and out of the caravan as if Cornelius had come down with dragonpox. He ran into the forest without a morsel of breakfast and couldn’t even be bothered to care.

knew how to respect a teacher? “Excellent. Three points for Slytherin.” Albus looked up at him then, smiling sheepishly. Draco didn’t know why, but it filled him with a strange sort of pride.
Draco cast a warming spell on the icy stones and with one final protective glance toward Harry patrolling beneath them, they both sat down. Draco cast the spell, allowing James to see his father through Draco’s eyes. It had been a while since Draco used Legilimency, but everything went perfectly. Draco revealed all four glimpses of Harry that he had planned. It didn’t take very long.
Potter kicked Draco’s bedpost so hard that Draco wouldn't have been surprised if it had scooted along the floor. “You can’t even--!” He looked at Draco very seriously, trying to catch his breath. “I don’t know why I

. Who the hell would want to sit with him while he ran potions experiments? “I don’t suppose you would be interested, Granger?”
The shelves were labeled alphabetically at the top with rough wooden shapes of letters. He walked past the A and the B, which had swung sideways so that the loops of the B faced downward like a plump arse. He found C, D, E, and there it was. The letter F was partially cracked through the middle but in far better condition than G, which was missing entirely. He began skimming potion titles. Faceless potion, no thank you. Fatal potion, best avoid that. Fear-mongering potion. Interesting. Feather potion. That could be practical, depending on its effects. Feces potion? Felatio potion? Who the hell thought that allowing sixteen year olds to invent their own potions was a good idea? The fertility potion at least sounded like it could be medicinally practical. Fisticuffs potion, he didn’t need. He was already trying very hard to not punch anyone in the face and didn’t need any encouragement in that regard. Flame-resistant potion, that sounded decent. Finally.
“Correct.” Draco tried to return their focus to the waltz by stepping forward, but Harry was rooted like a tree; Draco did nothing but press their legs together. He quickly stepped back again. "I'm fine, thanks to Granger."
. You have as much right to be here as anyone else.”
He’s--?” Granger gave Ron a
Draco sat in the Great Hall for the Halloween Feast wearing fine velvet black robes. Weasley and Granger hadn’t arrived yet, but Draco didn’t mind their absences. With Potter not speaking to him, it offered a pleasant sort of quiet. Or at least it did, until James Potter ran into the hall like the building was on fire. James was breathing heavily, as if he had just ran across half of the grounds. Potter was on his feet within seconds. Draco just kicked back and took another sip of pumpkin juice.
It took nearly two weeks to discover that the donations lists in the library were more or less useless. Carter’s donations had been given in bulk, and no one had bothered to sit down and make any record of the items donated or where each item ended up. Draco did, however, find a lead when scanning through potions donations. Small batches of potions donations were frequently listed as being taken to the “Potions Storage Library.” Apparently, somewhere in the dungeons was a large storage room that contained all of the potions stored by Hogwarts. This meant, of course, that in addition to the decent potions donations, he would probably have to filter through unsolicited donations and student projects. In theory, the room should be filled with preservation charms so he wouldn’t need to worry about spoilage. At least he hoped so, because some of the potions listed were well over 100 years old.
Draco moaned against Harry's mouth. This was all he'd wanted all
“Draco…”
“And let me know what you find, won’t you? I’m very interested to learn what sorts of potions we have been storing away.”
It felt like such a personal thing to confess, but he murmured, “Hebridean Black,” against Harry’s neck.
Now that the war was long behind him, it was easier to view the Manor as a place he had once called home. Yes, Voldemort may have walked

As soon as the snitch was released, the four of them began zooming around the pitch, watching for it. Lily glimpsed it first, darting toward one end of the pitch, but Draco didn’t see any sign of it. Then he saw the snitch glittering in the opposite direction and realized that she was

But he smelled rather delightful, actually.
“Potter.” His voice was so rough and guttural that he barely recognized it. “Wait.”
“Come now, Potter, I have parchment to grade.”
Finally, he went back to Potter’s room and sighed, allowing himself to sink to the floor by Harry’s bed. Harry was sleeping now, and even this younger version of Harry looked like
“What? Oh. I...” Potter's face reddened. “I don’t know, I was still half asleep. I guess I was thinking of...er...a dream I had. And what I would like to be doing about it.”
Draco felt his wand flinging from his hand as he reflexively reached out around himself, trying to grasp anything to prevent his fall. Then he hit earth and for one terrifying moment he couldn’t breathe while all of the air was knocked out of his lungs. As soon as his lungs began working again, he gasped and groaned, his knees aching, his palms scratched. Potter landed somewhere behind him, and Draco instantly looked over his shoulder to make sure that he was unharmed. Potter sputtered and gasped as Draco looked around them. They were standing in a deep, square dirt pit, empty but nearly ten feet wide and at least fifteen feet tall.

He didn’t want to have to
Potter silenced him by pressing their mouths together, gripping the sides of Draco’s face, his thumbs grazing back and forth along his cheekbones in that way that Draco loved. He sighed against Potter’s mouth, bringing his hands to the uneven mess of fabric that had made its way back up Potter’s hips. Draco pulled Harry closer as that golden heat tingled against his lips and dove into his bloodstream. Draco’s cock throbbed, still half hard from watching Harry come.
Bloody hell, Potter was doing this on purpose. He was just trying to make him look bad in front of his colleagues. But if that was really the case, Potter certainly didn’t look much better.
Dinner last night had been so effortless. What would happen if he
“I am?” Harry whispered as he pulled away, reaching down to stroke Draco’s hardening cock between them.
He was about to step onto Hogwarts grounds.
"I can...I can see that maybe now's not a good time..." Cornelius stammered.
“N-no,” one squeaked. Draco practically felt like he was back in front of a classroom. Merlin, was he really this easily persuaded at that age?
“Right! Ready for the next one, then?”
Draco rolled over until Harry was beneath him, trapped between his thighs. "Now let's see how
Draco sighed with relief. Oh thank Merlin. Thank Merlin, and Morgana, and Salazar’s big sweaty bollocks. “The truth, I guess.” Draco could practically feel his eyes going all mushy and sparkly as they looked into Potter’s eyes. He felt his hand tightening around Potter’s wrist. “I took the second potion, but I’m fine, and I really, really,
Draco stumbled backward until the backs of his legs collided with the dirt wall. Draco leaned over his knees, balling the fabric of his shirt into a fist above the pulsing pain from Potter's fist. “Oh and I haven’t?” He glared at Potter but remained standing, his free hand pressed to one knee. “You have a
Apparently Cornelius had abandoned his research altogether to pursue his gossipy editorials full-time. Cornelius’ eyes flashed to Draco, and Draco couldn’t speak. His heart was racing. He wasn’t sure what to feel. He was suddenly back to that morning at the caravan in Norway--abandoned and alone, all because of one life-altering mistake.
“But it’s so
“Oh,” Potter said flatly. “You’re back.”
should do more research on this, Draco. I have a tendency to try to take on too much. Who did you get to assist you? Was it you, Harry?”
Draco tried to enjoy a light lunch in his office, but found he couldn’t enjoy much of anything in his office at all. Everywhere he looked had a memory, and all of those memories revolved around his godfather. He kept catching himself staring sorrowfully at the chair in the corner, where he would sometimes curl up and read during Snape’s office hours. There would be no working in that room with any sort of peace. At least in Snape’s old quarters, there wasn’t a memory everywhere he looked. He had never actually seen Snape’s quarters as a boy. So it was nicely reminiscent of him, without being overly depressing. He stood up, the decision already made.
. Lean and muscled and delicious and fucking
Draco watched Potter in disbelief, now feeling even
Maybe it would be better if Potter continued to stay away, and then he could...well, he would finish his potions work secretly, and then leave Hogwarts behind forever.
As soon as they were outside, it was evident that James hadn’t needed to show them much of anything. In the dark, the cobblestones of the keep were flickering beneath a sickly green light. Once they reached the drawbridge, the Mark could be clearly seen, bright and gigantic, over the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Potter stepped forward, but James was clinging to his arm.
Draco released the spell. Potter pushed himself to his feet and walked to the open door. Draco was still standing on his bed in a silk robe, looking up at Potter, who was now standing in a doorway in the ceiling of Draco’s bedcurtains. Such strange magic, this was.
“Mr. Potter, what an unpleasant surprise. That's five points from Gryffindor for a student breaking curfew.”
Draco dipped two fingers into his mouth and slid them over Harry’s entrance. He watched Harry’s eyes roll back as he leaned down to suck Harry’s cock back into his mouth as he pressed one finger slowly into Harry’s opening, feeling Harry’s sphincter flutter around his finger.
. He wanted Potter breathless and gasping against his
Draco sighed and dropped his gaze, watching Potter’s shadow move below them. “The only person who can tell you your father’s stories is your father.” James groaned and was about ready to stomp away again, before Draco said, “But I can tell you what I know.” And so Draco did. Draco told him about the years leading up to the war, Potter's claims that Voldemort was back, about what happened at the astronomy tower, what happened at Malfoy Manor, and all about the Elder Wand. They were actually sitting up on the battlements long after Potter had gone inside, but James was listening without complaint, and Draco realized he had never really
, she meant...
The truth was, he already thought about Potter far more often than he would have liked. He often wondered how Potter was doing, but he refused to ever try and find out. He thought about those wonderful times he had grimaced at Potter, insulted Potter, tried to be better than Potter, disliked Potter, despised Potter, hated Potter, hated Potter,
found plenty of dried ancient potion ingredients. But he also found the Tomb of Hannu, which contained the largest collection of ancient texts referencing the Fountain of Youth he had ever seen. It was in the hieroglyphs on the walls. It was in the papyrus rolled in jars. Not only did the texts contain a partial list of ingredients, but the texts indicated that it had been

defected.”
“Why don’t you want him to know?”
. Why couldn’t Potter look at him with disgust and hatred like he used to? “I know,” he whispered. He wasn’t wearing his eyeglasses, and Draco found that he kind of liked it, being able to clearly see Potter’s eyes. Well, he was realizing he kind of liked Potter’s face regardless of whether he was wearing glasses or not. It was such a strange and silly thing to realize, but he had never really had the opportunity to realize it before. He was realizing a lot of things, really.
“Relax, Draco,” Harry said soothingly. “It’s nothing I haven’t seen before.”
killed. Right? Draco ran his tongue over the tender bleeding flesh on the inside of his mouth.
“Please don’t make this harder than it already is.” Potter’s eyes darted to Draco’s lingering erection and bit his lip as a boyish smile crept across his face. Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh
Draco shifted in his seat.
He eventually passed the younger version of himself leaving the Slytherin common room, walking between Greg and Vincent. Draco lingered, watching Vincent with a mournful heart. He watched the way the young Draco openly mocked Vincent's stupidity. How little he knew then. How little they all knew.
Their noses met at the tips, and then Draco allowed the tip of his nose to skim lightly down the side of Potter’s nose. A warm, tingling heat blossomed between that slightest touch of their bare skin, and Draco felt his fingers clench more tightly against Potter’s back, pulling the fabric of Potter’s pyjamas into his fists. Morgana’s tits, it was possible that Draco had never been more aroused in his entire life. His hips thrust half an inch before he could stop himself. “Draco,” Potter’s voice was something between a whisper and a groan, his voice tight as Potter shifted his hips. Draco nearly moaned in agony at the additional friction against his cock. He could feel the heat coming off of Potter’s lips. Potter, the beautiful mouth-breather, was practically panting against his
“I like this. The not fighting,” Harry said as he lifted his hand to run it along the back of Draco’s wrist, where a surge of warmth ran up his arm. “And this.” Harry pressed his fingers a little more purposefully against him and that golden warmth intensified. “I like this too. And...” He twisted a little in Draco’s arms and attempted to lift an arm behind his head, but found he was trapped by his wet shirt, still tight at his wrists. Draco unbuttoned Harry’s shirt at the cuffs and pushed it off of him completely, throwing it across the cubicle. It hit the wall with a wet

“So I suppose this is what you meant about the doors,” he murmured against the mattress.
It was far too thick for that. And Draco knew, because he knew Potter’s wand intimately.
. “Um….Babe...Why does your wardrobe lead to Malfoy’s bedroom?”
Draco took a deep breath. It was too late now. He decided to do what he always did in times like these. He had done it the first time he was on this train, and he could do it now: act far, far more confident than he actually felt. He straightened his shoulders and stepped back, smoothing out his robes and running his hands over his golden hair. It
The Grand Ballroom was already ten times smaller without masses of people inside of it. When Draco fully stepped inside, he stopped breathing.
As expected, a house elf was waiting for him in the Hogwarts keep. “Are you Mr. Malfoy, sir?” The house elf asked meekly. Draco nodded. “Please follow me, Mr. Malfoy, sir.”
“He actually killed you?” Mother had always assumed that the killing curse had failed when she found Potter alive. He was the Boy Who Lived, after all.
“Well, yes, and that was the problem wasn’t it? All beautiful and perfect and oozing testosterone.”
“But that’s not very nice at all! Don’t worry, Professor, we will see that he is scolded.” Lily turned back to James. “But what did it
“Yes, I think that might be it. How fascinating. And, frankly, terrifying. This type of magic with this level of power in a potion is... we should do more research on both of these potions.”

A sadness eased its way into Harry’s emerald eyes and he nodded, his eyes falling to Draco’s bare collarbone.

Why was Draco even leaving, anyway? He wasn't sure anymore. He was running because he always ran. He was leaving because he always left. He was rebuilding the Malfoy name, because that's what needed to be done. ...But he'd been invited back to the Ministry, hadn't he? The Malfoy name had already been restored. Well, in that case, he was leaving because he needed to continue his research. ...Research that could be completed almost anywhere once he collected the resources he needed. Well, then he was leaving because that was the
. It would probably be very difficult to explain to whomever occupied the room after him, but he had grown kind of fond of the silly thing. Maybe the next occupant would too. Draco wasn’t sure he would even be able to sleep anymore without silk pillows and the sound of trickling vermouth at night. He would find out soon enough, he supposed. He slung his dragon-leather satchel over his shoulder, took one last look at his rooms, and made his way outside.
The week went by quickly. Still, Draco was beginning to wonder if Potter was purposely avoiding him. Potter stumbled into the faculty meeting late, didn’t look Draco’s way
“In here, darling!” Granger called absentmindedly without even turning to look.
After supper, he retreated to the Potions room to begin running potions tests. He spent the entire weekend running tests. He started by labeling each mysterious vial with a clear number. Then, starting with the first and working his way through the rest, he began to run tests to identify the ingredients within each of them. By Sunday night, he was fairly certain that number 3 was some kind of alcohol-based potion, whereas numbers 4 and 9 (8 and 9 had completely blank labels) possessed characteristics similar to some love potions, but the rest were far more unique. And what was worse: as he cross-referenced his work with his ancient texts, he discovered that each and every one of the UTH vials contained at least one ingredient that matched his expansive Fountain of Youth ingredients lists.

“Of course I have.”

James leaned back against his pillows, crossing his arms with a cocky smile that looked so much like Harry’s that it hurt Draco’s heart a little. “A stag.”
Longbottom looked from Weasley to Draco, clearly not convinced. He cast a Legilimency spell and Draco offered no resistance. He could feel Longbottom flipping through his memories like pages in a book. Draco couldn't help the sly smirk that crossed his face when Longbottom found the memory of Draco and Harry in the shower.

The sneaky reporter looked a lot like Cornelius.
The Death Eaters behind Draco laughed.
“It would’ve taken me, I suppose,” Potter finally said. “I probably would have let it.”
“Ha! I knew it. Only a Weasley could appreciate something so ugly.”
“Alright?” Draco asked throatily, hardly recognizing his own voice. Harry nodded quickly and Draco leaned back up, pressing his lips lightly against Harry’s before reaching for a pillow and wedging it beneath Harry’s hips. “Relax,” Draco swallowed, reaching for his own cock with one hand and Harry with the other. He aligned himself, the tip of his cock brushing against Harry’s opening. There was a rush of golden heat, and Draco had to bite the inside of his mouth to ground himself. Harry arched off the mattress again and threw his arm over his face, laughing at himself. Then Draco began to slowly press himself inside. Inch. By. Slow. Inch.

“Lily!” Albus’ scolding voice hissed from behind Harry. Albus poked his head around the other side of Harry's robes. “Hi Professor. Thanks for the sleeping draughts,” he said, pinching Lily’s arm and pulling her back into the hallway.

Draco nervously glanced back at Potter, who was now just…

Draco preferred to shield his emotions behind insults and a harsh facade, while Potter preferred openness and honesty and the occasional angry outburst. ...Nevermind that Potter seemed to be the one person who managed to consistently see
“Yes.”
“Did you expect anything less?” Draco stepped toward the ladder behind him.
After breakfast on Friday, Headmistress Granger announced, “I would like to remind all faculty members that there is a faculty meeting at two o’clock this afternoon, in the Faculty Room.”
Right. Absolutely despised him.
had been treated as such.
Granger had let him keep the potions he'd studied that year in case he wanted to do any more research on them, so he added those to his belongings. He had agreed to owl her with any interesting findings.
“I’m not very good at it,” he shrugged. “I like having two feet on the ground. Besides, Rose is meeting me out here in a minute.” Draco stepped a little closer and saw that Albus was reading a Potions book, but it wasn’t anything Draco had assigned. “May I join you for a moment? I could use a rest.”
The idea of apparating to Malfoy Manor didn’t exactly thrill Draco. The Manor still felt tainted in his mind, but it was the only home he had and, more importantly, the only place where he would be able to find proper attire for the grand celebration.

See it there, below their hands, emitting the--?” Draco squinted and picked up the photograph in an urgent rush of excitement. Then he picked up the first photograph Harry had pointed at, looking back and forth between them. “Merlin,” he whispered. “Harry, you’re brilliant,” Draco turned and skated his lips over Harry's.

found it. We’ll need to run some additional tests to confirm, but this could be it, right? It’s clearly some kind of extraordinary healing potion.” Granger was so excited that she was now standing on his bed, literally jumping for joy. “We found it! We actually found it!”
Draco looked toward Potter in alarm. “You heard? The truth potion--you heard everything?”

Draco stared at the fountain, waiting for something to happen. Waiting for the house elf to return with someone to heal or scold him. Waiting for the first potion to...well,
As Draco followed Harry back to their room, he felt the wires of himself tightening, as though at any moment he would snap. He would return to their room. He would sleep. He would leave in the morning. He repeated this over and over in his mind until he could feel his steely exterior slowly returning, and he felt more comfortable beneath it.
"Oh!" Potter sounded almost relieved. "I um... I help the Aurors sometimes.
“Quite." Draco briefly pulled a stopwatch from his waistcoat and glanced at the time. "Well. Shall we go to dinner, 'Grand Guest of Honour?' Don't want to keep your fans waiting.” Draco bowed and exaggeratedly offered his arm as a joke. When Harry stood and actually wove their arms together, however, it didn’t feel like a joke at all. It felt perfect.
. She was giving everyone the false notion that the snitch was in the wrong place, distracting everyone to give Draco a chance to dive for the snitch. Fucking brilliant. She was more Slytherin with every passing day. As Draco extended an arm and reached for the snitch, James bashed into his side, the tip of James’ broom crashing into his ribs so hard that for a moment Draco thought he might have fractured something. Unlike the rest of them, Draco wasn’t wearing any protective gear. He gripped his broom tightly with both hands and tried to steady himself, pressing a hand instinctively to his ribs.
"How'd they get past the Aurors?" Granger asked quietly.

Albus jotted a note in the margin of his book. “I didn’t think of that. Thanks.”
But the question was lost when fireworks boomed through the sky. Harry pressed his hand out over the flat stone, brushing his fingers lightly against the edges of Draco’s. Draco curled his pinky finger around Potter’s, and pressed their knees together.
By the time Draco had arrived in the dining hall, Harry was nowhere to be seen. The feast hadn’t actually

Now Draco was remembering the way Potter had last whisper-groaned his first name against Draco’s mouth as their cocks rubbed together. He felt himself growing very, very warm as he gazed at Potter. He parted his lips so that he could breathe. He was becoming a bloody mouth-breather, and all he could think about was how it felt to have Potter panting against his mouth. How it would feel to have Potter panting
Draco was grinding his teeth. “Leave. Now.”

know I’m gay?”
The dark orb that the Death Eater had placed on the floor was spinning rapidly, lifting toward the ceiling of its own accord. There was a sickly green flash, and the orb opened into a wide, black, circular portal high in the ceiling. A cloud of dementors began pouring through the portal and into the room. There were so many that Draco couldn’t even hope to count them.
As he neared the pitch, he could see that the dementor was undoubtedly confronting Potter. If Potter hadn't noticed the dementor before, he was surely noticing it now.

“I don’t like it," Draco pouted. “The only one targeting your arse should be me.”

By the time Draco was standing behind Lily, however, Harry’s attention had shifted toward the front of the room, back toward the members of the Ministry. Draco suddenly had a sour taste in his mouth. He could watch Harry dance with Lily or Granger, that was one thing. But so many of those Ministers looked surprisingly fetching and powerful in their expensive, modern dress robes. Draco even spotted Blaise Zabini among them, looking as handsome as ever. Some dark and possessive part of Draco began to bare teeth at the thought of watching any single one of them in Harry’s embrace, and he realized he had made a terrible mistake. He had wanted to see

Ultimately, he cut her off and suggested her friend go talk to a counselor and would she

Back in London, the crowds were so thick that Draco was relieved that he had thought to apparate onto a rooftop. Once on the ground, he pressed his way through the streets toward one of the magical palace entrances.
“That’s not possible,” James said, flying over to get a better look.
Draco poked his head back into the bathroom. Potter leaned out from behind the shower curtain again, soaping his arms and shoulders. Draco felt every muscle in his body clench as he stared at the suds cascading down Harry's skin. “What time is dinner? I’ll need a shower when you’re done.” He'd need more than a shower, if he was being honest with himself.

“I’m pretty sure it was you, Ron,” Potter said.
Potter jumped back onto his bed and violently closed his bedcurtains. Draco walked right through them as Potter collapsed backward onto his pillow. Potter was crying. Why the hell was Potter crying? What had happened?
“None of your business.”
“Really?" Draco said flatly. "He hits me all the time.” Well, Potter had never hit him quite like

How had Potter endured it all? So much had already been thrust onto his shoulders when they were children. Draco was old enough to see how
“Good," Harry grinned, but it quickly turned into a thoughtful frown. "What about the Ministry? The Manor?”
She was silent for a long while, watching as he stirred and added and read. Then, Draco nearly dumped the entire cauldron over when she said: “You like boys.” It was not a question. He just stared up at her, eyes wide. Before he could even begin to explain how inappropriate the conversation was or ask how she even

Draco followed her back down the spiral staircase and down the hall into the next wing. Draco already knew where they were going--the old Potions classroom.
There was a brief moment of silence as the very room seemed to hold its breath.
to see Harry.
Draco smiled against Harry’s skin and pressed his lips to Harry’s neck.
“Draco!” Potter ran into the room and fell to his knees at Draco’s bedside, pressing a warm hand to Draco’s writhing chest in an attempt to still him on the bed so he wouldn’t convulse
But he couldn’t fight it anymore. He felt like a tidal wave surging into shore. Draco reached above his head with both hands, grabbed a pillow, and pressed it tightly to his face with all the strength of his forearms until he couldn’t breathe. Finally, he stared apologetically directly into Potter’s eyes and allowed the building tension to release as he screamed into his pillow. “I like you so much I can’t think straight,” Draco began, lifting the pillow to take a breath before pressing it back against his face, “and I can’t actually tell you because you would leave me. You would leave me because I’m worthless and I’ve done nothing but push you away my whole life, and if you ever left me I think it would destroy me, Potter.” He took another breath. “I don’t know how to do this.

“Potter?” Draco asked nervously, scooting forward until his legs were dangling over the edge of the bed. “What potion--?” Potter took a few staggering steps toward him. “
“Haven’t the foggiest. Hold on. Going to test something.” Malfoy stepped aside and out of view, pinched himself,
“I think that would be unwise. What if there is some kind of counter-reaction, and--”
“Of course I will,” he said a little more snappily than he meant to, hoping that his voice sounded more confident than he felt.
The doors had gone to rights by early Saturday afternoon, to everyone’s relief. Draco had spent most of Sunday napping, and the rest of the week trying to focus on anything but the memory of Potter in his bed.
Draco sat down on the edge of his bed without a single protest. What was the world coming to? He was actually listening to Harry Potter. “Are you sure you want to... I mean, I can prepare everything.”

Draco never would have thought that he could actually have this: a full life. He never thought that he would feel so full and loved, especially after so many years of misery and hardship. He certainly never thought that he could have it with Harry. After everything they had gone through, Draco knew that they would be alright, because they finally had each other. In a way, they'd had each other all along. Draco felt stupidly joyful and way-too-deep in love every morning when he woke up with Harry Potter at his side. It should have been impossible, but it was his life. His delightfully good life.

After another couple of hours, they were all quite drunk--or at least Draco was--and the crowd had begun clearing out. There were only a few old men left in the corner.
“Need something?”
Curse Granger and Weasley and their damned scheming!

Draco continued through the hallways, hunting for the four Death Eaters he had sent to find the Minister. As his boots collided against black and white tiles like the ticking of a clock, he feared he would never find them in time.

“What am I doing now, then?” Draco pressed his hands to Harry’s shoulders, smoothing his palms against the fabric of his shirt. “You’ll be splendid. If you can defeat the bloody Dark Lord, you can survive a handful of politicians.”
"If you stop I
“Potter!” he called a little edgily. Potter stopped a few feet away from the bar, looking questioningly at Draco. Draco closed the gap between them, flattened both of his palms against Potter’s chest, and
“Of course. There’s something I’d like to discuss with you as well.”
“I came to you last week, after the pub,” Potter whispered against Draco’s skin, planting kisses along Draco’s jaw. “You’d had too much to drink. I thought you didn’t want me.”
It was almost a shame that his son would never see the young Harry Potter, though. “You want to?” Draco asked, wondering why he hadn’t thought of it before.
“Yes.”
“See that, Potter?” Draco pointed to the corner of his eye, hoping that it would divert Potter from his reddening ears. No one saw Potter’s pyjamas?
“When you--? Oh.” Suddenly everything made a lot more sense. Draco had been sleeping like the dead, and Potter was probably the one who saw the Patronus, informing him that his child was in the healing ward because of a poor spur-of-the-moment decision that Draco had made. Well, fuck.
“Show-off. Do you

. Absolutely refused. “I guess I... I thought that if your wand was any indication, that maybe you and I...if you ever came back, that maybe we...” Potter’s eyes went somewhere else for a moment, clenching the wand more tightly in his hands. Draco felt the rain practically sizzling against his cheeks as he thought about Potter wanting the two of them to be as
“Err...huh,” Potter mumbled, scratching his fingers through his hair.
“Neither did I, to be honest. But these aren’t your usual potions, either.” Draco told him about his discovery and his new potion experiments.
, and he hated it. Albus poked his head into the compartment a few minutes later and sat across from Draco with a book. James followed shortly thereafter, noisily dropping into the seat next to Albus.
“A tie, I think.” Draco said, staring down at the snitch trapped between his and Potter’s clasped hands.
Potter was stammering again. A beautiful, stammering idiot, and Draco absolutely loved it. Because he knew exactly what Harry was trying to say. He found himself almost sobbing into Harry’s mouth as he gripped him tighter, then backed away, pulling Harry’s clothes off of him. Pulling down his scarlet robe and unfastening his tie with clumsy, eager fingers. The buttons were taking too long, even after Harry had lifted his own hands to help. Draco reached for his wand and murmured a spell that transported all of their clothing to the infernal sofa. Harry blinked at him.
like being back in school again, except Draco wasn't throwing any taunts and Harry wasn't actively stalking him.  ...On second thought, it wasn't like being back in school at all. They were interacting even less.

“Spend it elsewhere.”

, clearly. Potter had the frightening ability to do that to him. Potter’s brainlessness was a contagion upon all humankind. A door slammed, and Potter let his head fall back down against the mattress by Draco’s neck and cleared his throat.
Draco didn’t bother to respond. He was trying to disappear back into the crowd, which was proving to be more difficult than pushing to the front had been, because everyone was now pushing against him in their attempt to get a better view of Harry.
Draco nearly moaned at the sight of him.
the ground at all. It was sort of. Floating. And I thought. What if it’s one of those dementor things? They kind of look like that, right?”
When he emerged, Potter had turned more lights on, which was helping Draco feel a little more awake. Now, at least, he could clearly see that Potter was already showered and dressed in a pale green button-up shirt with a dark green tie draped loosely untied around his neck. A very familiar pale green button-up and dark green tie.
Draco was already half asleep when he felt Harry reach across the bed and trace a gentle fingertip down the side of Draco's face. Draco hummed into his pillow as the tingling heat caressed his skin. “Stay,” Harry whispered so quietly that Draco was convinced he was already dreaming. “I wish you’d stay.”
It was late on Sunday evening, but not so late that he expected Granger to be asleep. He crept into her office and poked his head in. She was sitting at her desk, organizing piles of parchment. Draco cleared his throat and her cat howled. Granger looked up. “Professor Malfoy,” she said, looking surprised. “Come in.” Draco entered her office properly and sat in a chair on the other side of her desk. “How are your classes going?” she asked.
Granger ran back over to Draco's desk and flipped through his research journal. She immediately began pulling ingredients off of his shelves and readied a cauldron. She was attempting to make a potion to counter whatever he had just taken, based on the suspected ingredients he had noted in his original tests.
Draco lifted the pillow and gasped as he looked at the ceiling, trying to catch his breath and swallow the growing tightness in his throat. “Oh Morgana,” he whispered to himself. His whole body went slack, and he timidly met Potter’s eyes. Potter’s beautiful, kind eyes.
Potter laughed. It was a tight, breathy, almost angry sound, but it was an improvement. “He did, didn’t he? I’m glad he wasn’t the one to carry me back to Hogwarts after he killed me, or I think I might’ve—”
Harry smiled nervously up at him. “I don’t know how you do it. I’m no good at this. You’re sure you can’t stay? Guide me through it?”
“Can we just--?” Potter asked.
. Draco clenched his teeth and turned away from the window. He continued his walk toward the station until he realized that all his feet had done was circle the block. He was standing in front of the same shop window again, with the same dress robes on display. Draco checked his watch. He still had a little time before he needed to be at the station. It couldn’t hurt to simply

Draco subtly traced his fingers along the skin of Potter's chest at the point of the V in his shirt. Touching Potter offered its own kind of high, and his drunkenness made him bold. He dragged the thumb of his other hand down Harry's chin and onto his shoulder. He leaned forward until the outside of Potter’s left thigh grazed the inside of Draco’s right. Draco brushed his lips ever so slightly against Potter’s earlobe. “Harry Potter,” he whispered as seductively as he felt, his lips moving lightly against Potter’s ear. He kept his voice quiet enough so that only Potter could hear. “If you go home with anyone tonight, it had better be

When Draco heard Harry’s breath deepen and even out about fifteen minutes later, he knew Harry had finally drifted to sleep. As exhausted as Draco was, he couldn't sleep. Between the lingering bourbon, the sight of Harry in his boxers, and the golden heat of Harry’s touch in the dark, Draco was as hard as a fucking boulder. He slowly, quietly moved just a little farther from Potter and allowed his hand to drift beneath the sheet and into his silk pyjama bottoms. Draco sighed with pleasure when he wrapped his hand around his cock. He allowed his mind to drift, and it very quickly drifted to the man sleeping next to him. To the feeling of Potter’s thumbs along his knuckles. The feeling of Potter’s hot breath on his face. The sight of him in the shower. The feeling of his amazing mouth on his cock. He began to stroke himself slowly and silently beneath the sheet. He grew closer and closer to climax, until--

“Oh ho! Off again, are we? Well, whenever you do decide to settle down, I hope to be the first to know. No, I won’t have Australia laying claim to you, not a mind like yours, you know!”
“Potter!” Draco snapped as he marched down the hall after the meeting had ended. Potter spun around, looking at him curiously. “We need to talk.” Draco clenched Potter’s robes in
Well, bugger.
“I’ve got my feet back on the ground,” Potter said, crouching with his hands on his knees on his bedroom floor.
“I’m telling you, you really need to lose this thing for blondes, mate. Next thing you know, you’ll be going home with
“I saw you tonight,” Draco said as they relaxed in the jacuzzi tub, hours later. Draco’s back was nestled tightly against Harry’s chest as steam curled around them. “The final potion took me back to third year. It was sort of like being trapped in a pensieve.”
unfasten the gauntlet that hid one of his darkest secrets didn’t seem to matter all that much. It felt as innocuous as someone untying his shoelaces. Harry threw the cuff onto the pile with their other clothes and ran his fingers up and down Draco’s bare forearm, where his pale skin had gone a little pink and patchy from the leather in the hot water. Harry ran his finger in figure eights along the faded, unmoving snake of his Dark Mark, and Draco allowed his head to fall back against the wall.
“That’s…not helpful at all.” Albus’ face sank, and he looked practically terrified. Draco instantly felt guilty. “I mean yes! Brilliant! Thank you for your assistance. Three points for Slytherin.” Draco hoped his smile didn’t appear as false as it felt. Really, he was running on vermouth and frustration and nothing about the doors was making any sense.
Potter's voice grew softer, more resolute. “I really
“He hates me.” Draco finished for him. “Fine. That’s just one more Potter who hates me. Well, he’ll have to fall in line. There’s already at least ten thousand individuals eagerly awaiting my demise. I’m not terribly concerned that your fifteen-year-old has added himself to the list.” Draco reached for the door handle. He was ending this conversation. He was getting out of this closet before any rumours could spread. Plus, he had to prepare for tea with Granger.
. Dancing with Lily was an acceptable choice, and less likely to drive Draco mad with jealousy. With Lily’s help, Harry could stop searching the crowd awkwardly and begin dancing.
can find us.”
Back in his rooms that evening, Draco kept trying to remember details about the night at the Hog's Head, wondering if he'd done something to scare Potter off. He'd had way more to drink than he was used to, and the whole night still felt blurry no matter how many times he tried to remember it. ...Except the very dreamy memory of Potter’s ear in his mouth. And gold. There was still something about gold. Anyway, maybe he had misinterpreted Potter’s body language and crossed a line. Certainly when Potter had suggested that they be
“What's the potion?”
Draco wrapped one of his legs around Harry’s and dug his fingers into Harry’s back--wanting to feel all of him, every last inch of skin as he pressed his chest against Harry’s mouth. Harry licked his way back up to Draco’s neck, pressing their bodies tightly together.
cast a Patronus?”
He pulled out an eyedropper, stuffed it into the first potion, and lifted it over his mouth until three drops fell onto his tongue. He smacked his tongue against the roof of his mouth and swallowed.
Then he took the dropper and allowed three drops to fall onto his tongue. Draco relaxed onto his mountain of pillows as Potter took his journal and the potion back to his desk. So far the potion gave him a dizzyingly elated sort of feeling, but with Potter nearby that might not have been the potion at all.
There was a shriek toward the end of the hall, and they saw a swish of dark robes. Two more Death Eaters were chasing someone who looked a great deal like the Minister of Magic into a room. "Not much choice, is there?" Weasley said, adjusting his hold on his wand.
“Yeah. I started when I was just a little kid, with Aunt Hermione's help. I thought it was silly that he kept going out to buy them all the time. He’s pretty awful at potions, so he doesn’t even try to make his own.” Draco smiled at that. Some things never changed. Potter had

Draco led the house elf back to his desk in his rooms, where he had three vials in an open stand. “Now,” Draco said, turning to the house elf. “I am going to drink this potion. I do not know exactly what it will do. If I appear to be ill or in any pain of any kind, you need to contact a Healer immediately. Understood?”
here?" Weasley muttered testily.
...Then the last waltzing lesson happened, and his Potter box threatened to blow open. Draco carefully picked up every stray piece of his wounded heart, stuffed it back into the Potter box, and sealed it tight. With sticking charms. And nails. And more sticking charms. And then he mentally had a giant sit on it, just in case none of that was enough.
. You do realize that, don't you?”
, with all of the freedoms to explore the Hogwarts grounds that teachers received? That was the far more promising option, and somehow he had actually managed to do it. Although, now that he was actually encountering giggling children on the Hogwarts Express, it was an option he was deeply reconsidering.
“I mean...sorry, Harry.” Weasley suddenly became very interested in his pint glass.
Draco enjoyed a light breakfast at a classy cafe down the street. He sipped an espresso afterward, daring to even read a newspaper. Somehow the prospect of encountering Potter’s face didn’t seem as loathsome as it once had.
Draco took a breath. There was no need to panic. It was entirely possible that Lily and Albus were perfectly safe.
Now Draco was quite certain he was dreaming. He had been pleasantly surprised that Potter had even allowed Draco's hand inside of his pants, but
want me to, do you? Aren't I supposed to stay here for the next 24 hours?” he grinned. “To assist you? For science?” Potter eagerly leaned forward again, but Draco held out his hand to stop him.
it, you have to--”
There it was again: a tangible golden heat that began at his mouth and spread through every inch of him. How often had he dreamed of this? How was it possible that anything he'd ever dared to imagine paled in comparison to this reality? Everything about Harry Potter was impossible--even his mouth. This wasn’t just biology. He had kissed people before. This was like nothing he had ever felt in his life. This was, quite literally,
Potter’s ramblings were making him think things he should
"I suppose this is why we need Slytherins." Harry chuckled and wrapped his arms around Draco. “You realize, of course, that this means you are never allowed to leave me.” Harry tightened his hold until Draco could barely breathe.
But it was still all
Draco’s neck snapped back around with renewed curiosity, his eyes focused on the fabric of Harry's bed curtains, his ears alert. Had Potter just said what he thought he'd said?
“Oh, even better! So
good to see you back in the country, sir! Word is, your potions research is the envy of the world. I was just talking to the Australian Wizarding Ambassador the other day, and would you believe it? He was trying to claim you as their own, he was. No, I said, we’ve still got him, we have indeed! Will you be taking your father’s place in the Ministry?”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Draco was sprinting now. He had started sprinting the instant the words “hasn’t been able to cast” came out of James’ mouth. He found the nearest door leading outside and burst out onto the lower battlements, jogging along the edge toward the stairway to the keep, scanning the grounds for Potter. He could just barely see the dark, familiar shape of Potter past the pitch, walking toward the Forbidden Forest. Draco had had a few close calls with dementors in some tombs, but he'd only ever been able to produce a misty sort of light. It had bought him time before other researchers rushed in to help, but it certainly wasn’t enough to banish a dementor or send a message to Hogsmeade, where he
involved Harry Potter in any way. It hadn't involved flirting with Harry Potter, or kissing Harry Potter, or sharing a very steamy night in the Quidditch changing rooms with Harry Potter. It
“Yes,” Draco said reluctantly. It was better than nothing.
When Harry wrapped his lips around the tip of his cock, Draco’s head flew upright. His elbows slipped completely out to the sides as he watched in hungry disbelief while his cock began to disappear into Harry’s mouth.
Draco followed Granger, Weasley, and Potter upstairs, waiting for Granger to have a free moment to give him the key to his room. But Granger and Weasley appeared to be going to
Draco wasn’t sure what to show him, exactly. The war? That might be too intense. Draco ultimately decided to show James the memories of Harry on a broom for the first time, followed by a Quidditch match, and Potter flying from the dragon at the Triwizard Tournament. Maybe he would end with a scene from the Fiendfyre, when Harry saved Draco's life. It had a nice arc to it.
. They stared at each other for a few moments. Draco felt as though something in him had lifted. He felt strangely light. He watched the rain dripping down Potter’s face in the dark, noting the way it had slicked his hair down tightly over his forehead. His spectacles were covered in raindrops, and they looked a little foggy with the cold. Potter shivered, as if he had just caught a chill. Then he cleared his throat and stood up, waving his wand around the pit, testing a few spells, but nothing appeared to work.
“Come on, Malfoy,” Potter said, straddling Draco's hips in the dark. The dark--thank Merlin for that. Potter was standing over him in the middle of the night wearing an almost identical outfit as the fated morning of the door incident.

Lily dug into her other pocket and pulled out a very fancy scroll. “He has to go to

Draco hesitated.
“Now what?”
the discovery of the healing potion. But if you interpret it differently, it’s actually the Muggle hieroglyph for combat. The combination of symbols here indicates to me that these two were sworn enemies.” Draco pointed at the two human figures.
“Can you open it again for me?” Draco asked, soaping his hands beneath the water.
big enough for both of them. They may as well have been sleeping on different continents. Draco was almost disappointed.
“Okay, okay,
This was going to be an interesting last night. Or at least a very, very difficult one.
, for fuck’s sake. Yes.
Surprisingly, the celebration had roared back to life shortly after the Death Eaters were dealt with. No one could argue that the Wizarding World didn’t know the true meaning of
He certainly hadn’t expected to have a life epiphany there, in the middle of nowhere in a Norwegian forest, and it quite literally dropped him on his ass. He fell back onto the dirt, staring at the trees with wide eyes and the new realization that maybe, just maybe, his feelings toward Potter had been more complex than simple hatred. That maybe he actually...
Draco risked a glance to Potter’s face, but Potter’s eyes were either closed, or so downcast that they appeared closed in the dark. But Potter kept… well...
“Out!” Draco yelled, allowing his head to come crashing back onto his pillow, the enchantment between him and Potter--thank Merlin for small miracles--broken. One more minute, and he almost assuredly would have been snogging Harry Potter, Lifelong Archenemy of Draco Malfoy and Saviour of the Wizarding World. What the bloody hell had he been thinking?

Draco was already so on edge that when Harry began to come and the pressure tightened impossibly around Draco’s cock, Draco couldn’t hold back. With two more thrusts he came, still buried deep inside of Harry.
Draco clenched his jaw. Oh,
wands, one of which was made of very familiar hawthorn. And this Death Eater was torturing Harry.
. He was constantly on the move, seeking ancient or forgotten potions and recipes wherever they led him: archaeological digs, research facilities, academic institutions. Above all, he was seeking new people who didn’t know his name. People who wouldn’t see him and think:

“Right.” Never mind that that awful state had apparently been in Draco’s arms.
Draco was grinding his teeth. Suddenly he realized that this wasn’t winning at all. Winning was what would have happened if he had accepted the fact that he had lost in the first place. Now Weasley was touching Potter. Slapping him on the back like they had just finished a bracing game of Quidditch or something equally ridiculous.
Nothing.
Draco looked up. The sky was clear, and his namesake constellation was curling itself widely across the sky. “It was war. Your dad went through a lot.”
Draco swallowed and took a large step backward before he could do anything stupid, and Potter’s hand quickly lifted from his waist and was rustling in his own hair. “How was that, Weasel?” Draco looked over at Weasley, whose smile had gone a little crooked, and his whole head was craned sideways so that he looked like a confused dog.
. Potter had said
That week, the school was buzzing with gossip. Where had the Mark come from? Who had cast it? Was someone trying to infiltrate Hogwarts? Was someone trying to kill Harry Potter? Or, in Draco's secret thoughts, was someone else after The Fountain of Youth? They never caught any Death Eaters and they still hadn’t found any answers, but Potter and Granger went back over the grounds, casting a series of strong and complicated protective wards. Draco had offered suggestions, reviewing the spells the Death Eaters were most likely to cast in their attempt to break into the wards, if that had been their intent at all. Potter began patrolling the grounds almost nightly, and Draco often found himself going for walks around the battlements at the same time. To think. Just to think. It had nothing to do with watching Potter from the battlements as he walked the grounds alone. It had nothing to do with a newfound desire to protect him from potential dark wizards who might hurl themselves out of the shadows and try to kill him. Again.
Draco sat down and opened his research journal. He had drastically revised his notes beneath Potion 1, giving it a proper name and so forth. He turned to a blank page, wrote the date in neat, slant script, and then:
“Of course
“No, really though!" Ron leaned forward to look down the bar at Malfoy, but nearly fell off his stool. "Malfoy, you wouldn’t believe it. I remember the days when so many strangers would try to flirt with Harry that we would have to cast sobering charms so as to not die of alcohol poisoning by the end of the night.”
“Says the man who uses them like weapons.”
didn’t, but the refs made a terrible call.”
After a few general announcements, the meeting was over. Before Draco could make his escape, Granger called him aside. “Professor Malfoy,” she said. “Would you be so kind as to join me for tea in my office in an hour? There is a matter I would like to discuss with you.”
The Hogwarts Express lurched as it crossed a bridge, and Draco’s head shook from side to side, still gently pressed against the glass window. The door to his compartment slid open, and two young girls with armfuls of sweets blinked at him from the hallway in embarrassment. Draco simply stared at them. One of the girls, who had shoulder-length orange hair and a vaguely familiar bone structure, angled her head to one side, studying him with open curiosity until the other girl was dragging her out of the car by her robes. Soon they were running down the hall and hadn’t even bothered to slide the door closed again behind them. He would have to get used to that, he thought. Being surrounded by children. Possibly being friendly to them, even. On second thought, possibly not. Snape had gotten along perfectly well without ever being
Draco swooped down, landing a little more roughly than he had intended to, but managed to stay on his feet. “Later, Weasel,” Draco called as he tossed the broom on the green beside him.
Still nothing.
instead of fighting.
--to get away. Away from memory. Away from aristocracy. Away from politics and purebloods and propriety. Away from stuffy rooms and judging eyes and expectations for his future. All of it. So he ran.
Draco leaned back against the tree, thinking of how he had discovered that trick when trying to intensify his own variety of sleeping potions. He thought of the bottles of them he had left in his rooms--enough to last a week, and then some. It helped him get through the bad nights. The nights when he would dream about the war. It made sense that Potter needed something similar. “You make Sleeping Draught for your dad then?”
He pressed a palm against his crotch to adjust himself and took a staggering breath at the touch, tempted to start wanking like some hormonal teenager.
When Longbottom was close enough, he punched Draco across the side of the face. "Draco Malfoy," Longbottom said bitterly as Draco lost what little balance he had against the wall and toppled to the floor.
Draco didn't know how deeply Harry still confided in Weasley and Granger, but he must have told them
