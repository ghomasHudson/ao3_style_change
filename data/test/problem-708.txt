“There’s no need to say anything, Harry,” he says, the appeasing smile on his face a jarring contrast to the whites of his knuckles and the strange sadness in his eyes. “I’ll come find you in an hour.”
It was a mistake. A terrible, costly mistake. Draco hadn’t noticed at the time, didn’t notice at all until the next morning when they woke up together, naked and entwined in each other’s arms. Those moments were rare, one of them usually running far away before the sun came up so they didn’t have to face what they’d done. Looking back, Harry wishes he had left Draco alone in that bed that morning. Instead, they woke up together and it was mere moments before the other man was screaming at him to leave after catching a glimpse of himself in the ornate mirror across the room.
“You stare so loud,” Draco says suddenly, closing his book in one hand, keeping a finger on the page and looking up at Harry. “It’s distracting.”
“You left this at the wedding,” his voice calls from the drawing-room doorway, shocking Harry out of his wallowing. He turns to see Draco dropping his robe over the arm of the sofa, pouting slightly. “You left me, too.”
“If you’re going to fuck me then fuck me,” he whines with an undignified pout. Harry laughs and pecks his puckered lips.
“Are you going to stare at me all night or actually do something?” Draco asks, finally pulling the shirt off and dropping it to the floor. He steps closer to Harry then and works at his remaining buttons with impatient fingers.
He didn’t turn around for the whole journey to one of Pansy’s many spare bedrooms, too pissed off to speak to or even look at the man behind him. When he finally found one that was blissfully unoccupied, he grasped Draco’s wrist and pulled him in, locking the door behind them with ease.
“Of course she told her mother, Potter. Don’t be so dense. She’s a clever girl, aren’t you, little dove?” He asks her, never dumbing down his voice like a lot of people would to a child of her age. She nods, pulling a face at Harry that makes Draco cackle with glee.
The one thing he can’t be sure of is what’s next for them. For the first time, he doesn’t want to push away the hope he feels for the future. It seems like a possibility now, armed with the knowledge that Draco loves him back. There may be uncomfortable conversations, disapproval from the few people in Harry’s life still unsure of how to trust people like Draco, but in the end, he knows they’ll have each other. There’s peace in that thought, a peace he isn’t sure he’s ever known.
Draco sighs, turning away from Harry’s frustrated gaze. “It’s for you,” he mumbles, Harry barely catching the words. “An apology—a goodbye, I don’t know. It’s not coming out right.”
The aged house-elf is there in a moment, standing at the side of the bed with his head bowed. Harry rarely calls for him. These days, he gives him tasks every now and then and lets him take care of the house in general just to keep the peace.
He doesn’t need to be told twice. Using his grip on the blond locks to anchor him, he fucks into Draco’s mouth, breath hitching at the feel of it. He doesn’t think he’s going to last long, the image of the love of his life on his knees before him and letting him defile his mouth like this just too much to handle.
The kitchen comes into view far sooner than he’s prepared for. The door wide open, the soft glow of the lamplight spills into the hallway. He stands in the doorway and takes in the scene before him, heart aching and deeply confused.
His eyes meet the other man’s grey ones and there’s a flicker of something there. Something he can’t read, or perhaps doesn’t want to. There’s a tiny smile on his face and he can’t tell if it’s forced or not.
Draco frowns, eyes still locked on the parchment below him. Harry couldn’t read it if he tried, the letters far too muddled up.
It’s a cold winter's afternoon. Snow kisses the ground, settling more and more as time passes and blanketing it with crisp white flakes. The tent they painstakingly spent the morning setting up is blissfully warm, charms preventing any of the chilly air from seeping in. Flowers adorn almost every surface, some he’s never even seen before, and all manner of creatures seem to flit around the space freely, never once bothering the guests. It’s an overwhelming mess of colour and movement that somehow manages to be elegant and beautiful and so
if that doesn’t make Harry’s softening cock twitch. It’s not even the dirty words, though they definitely play a part, it’s the way the word
Harry feels incredibly smug, knowing it takes little more than a barely-there touch to have such a stubborn man crumble. He lowers himself down to give him a kiss, holding himself up with one arm placed next to his head. Their lips brush and something changes, something deep inside of him that says
Lost in thought, when he finally locks back in on their conversation, Hugo is babbling away about something Harry can’t keep up with. Draco seems to understand.
He doesn’t realise that he’s standing frozen in the doorway until Draco places a hand on his cheek, bringing him back to life.
He’s standing above Harry now, looking down at him in the chair. It doesn’t feel like part of the game anymore. “You’re a bigger fool than I thought, Malfoy, if that’s what you think I mean,” he contends, not breaking eye contact with the man.
," recalls, chuckling to himself at the memory. “It was hilarious, watching them dance around each other for weeks with rings in their pockets at all times, waiting for the right moment to pop the question—part of me wanted to break and tell them, a much bigger part wanted to see who would get there first.”
Ron looks at him for a second, like he’s considering something. Hugo wiggles in his hold, murmuring but not waking up. Somewhere across the room, he hears Draco’s laughter ring above the music. He smiles to himself.
They’re 27 now, far too old for this thing they can’t let go of but they haven’t stopped falling into each other. It’s worse now, Draco all but moving in with him and rarely spending a moment outside of his company. Harry hasn’t told a soul about his feelings, not even his closest friends. It’s so clear to him that they know, their pitying looks following him everywhere he goes. Sometimes—against their better judgement—they try to bring it up but he shuts them down quicker than they can utter the words. He can’t take it.
Harry huffs out a startled laugh. Thinking about it, she probably will. "I vote we elope," is what he says in reply.
“At my sister's wedding, Harry? Really?” He complains before getting up and grabbing his sleeping child from Harry’s arms. He’s well aware of what’s happening here and wants no part in it. “Tell him, after you’re done with whatever weird shit you’re gonna do.”
“You’re older than me,” he retorts, tucking himself back into his trousers before helping Draco off the floor. “And it’s not my fault you left me with just my hand for a week—missed your mouth.”
The smugness radiating off him is almost suffocating. If he wasn’t so desperately in love he’d find it repulsive. He’s playing with Harry’s tie, completely messing it up. “What if my mouth was busy all week?” He ponders with a smirk. “There were a lot of lonely men on the trip.”
Rose wiggles her way out of Draco’s arms and onto the floor, straightening out her dress as she rights herself. “Am I sitting with you, mummy?” she asks Hermione.
Draco laughs lightly, the sound slightly strangled with unshed tears. Harry stands, pulling Draco to his feet as he does.
The house feels lighter as they make their way back to their room. Floors warm beneath their bare feet, each hallway illuminated just enough to guide them, it seems to be giving them it’s approval. The magic feels more settled too, the anxious fizzing replaced with a gentle buzz that feels like it’s wrapping around them. He’s not sure if he’s the only one who feels it, or if he’s losing his mind. He finds he doesn’t really care.
“Not my fault you don’t pay attention to anything but Malfoy,” the redheaded man answers smugly, pulling up a chair and flopping into it. He’s already lost his shirt and tie, probably around the third glass of firewhiskey.
s and Draco’s pretty moans, the gentle rhythmic thud of the headboard against the wall. One of Draco’s hands is fisted in the sheets, the other resting over Harry’s just below his waist, holding it there.
It doesn’t take long for him to get hard, not with Draco’s hand working him and warm lips moving against his. It’s so much and yet not at all enough when he wants
“Oh really?” Draco asks, pulling a funny face. “That’s lovely, thank you for sharing that information. I’m sure dinner will go down a treat now that I have the thought of Hugo’s smelly nappy in my head.” Rose giggles at that, muttering a small ‘very stinky’.
“Then you’re going to take me home and fuck me,” he breathes with a whine, like he always does when he’s trying to get a rise out of Harry. He twitches in Draco’s hand and the cocky twat just smirks.
Ginny and Luna hadn’t been able to come in the end, Luna falling ill a few days before leaving. They got a floo call on their first night here from an ecstatic Ginny explaining that it wasn’t illness at all, but
“Our next speaker needs no introduction,” Ginny calls out, making Harry groan. He knows she’s about to say something he won’t like. “Give it up for the saviour of the wizarding world, my ex-boyfriend, Harry Potter!” She finishes with a dramatic flourish, sticking her finger up at him in a rude but all-too-familiar gesture.
He bought the ring around a month after they worked everything out, knowing it was far too soon and yet unable to stop himself. Multiple times since then, he’s considered asking. Every single time he chickens out.
Draco leans against the table, standing far closer to him than is necessary. There’s still a flush on his face, either from the cold outside or from what they were doing minutes ago. “I think so.”
Draco shifts, just slightly, fingers twitching like he’s stopping himself from doing something. Harry tracks every slight movement, every breath, like a sceptic watching a magician. “Is there something you’re trying to say here, Harry?” He asks, using the name like a weapon.
There’s no crueller thought to him than the reminder that he’s never kissed those lips. The only rule he hasn’t broken and the one he thinks about almost constantly. He doesn’t know how they do it, how they know each other’s bodies so intimately and still avoid crossing that one tempting line.
Draco hasn’t noticed him standing there. He doesn’t think Draco is capable of noticing anything right now that isn’t the half-written letter in front of him. Harry is terrified.
Harry had stumbled into one of the bathrooms at around three am to find Draco Malfoy sitting in his bathtub. He’d looked a lot different then, his hair cut ridiculously short and an almost-permanent frown on his pointy face. Harry, in his drunken haze, hadn’t been entirely sure what to do with the information that Malfoy was hiding from everyone like a frightened animal.
Before he can respond to that terribly unconvincing lie, Hermione’s voice floats out of the doors and onto the porch, calling them to the table. Groaning at the prospect of another salad, they begrudgingly remove themselves from the swing and do as they’re told.
He tugs Draco’s lip between his teeth, mind reeling at the soft gasp it elicits. He’s angry and tired and so in love that it hurts but none of that matters now. All that matters is them.
The moment it hit, he felt like the world was going to end. They were sitting in Harry’s office, Draco lounging in the big plush armchair in the corner as if he belonged there, sunlight streaming through the window and kissing his skin. He was reading, a small smile on his face as he skimmed the pages, and Harry couldn’t look away. He realised, in that moment, that this was their new normal. Draco wasn’t there to fuck, or to fight, he was there because he felt comfortable there, in that room, with Harry.
He’s not sure what he’s going to walk into. Making a mess isn’t something he thought Draco capable of, the man barely able to stand being around Harry when he’s at his most disorganised. The house is quiet as he walks through the halls. It feels sad, almost, like it knows something is wrong and that only furthers Harry’s growing discomfort. The walls breathe a heavy sigh, the magic in them that feels so tied to him—to them—fizzing with
“On the bed then,” he gives in, his own patience wearing thin. Draco goes without a fight, turning his back on Harry and pulling his underwear off, inviting him to look. He does, drinking in every inch of the bare skin. From his shoulders to the curve of his spine, to his pert arse, he’s perfect. If Harry weren’t so eager to get on with it, he’d drop to his knees and worship him until the sun streams through the crack in the curtains. That isn’t what either of them needs right now. That can wait for tomorrow, if there is a tomorrow for them.
Harry can’t remember how it went from that to Draco bent over his desk moaning his name. The whole thing was a blur of frantic touches and ripped clothes and the sound of their breathing. It wasn’t supposed to become a thing, but it did.
Harry frowns. Quickly, he dismisses Kreacher with a nod and dives out of bed so fast he nearly trips. He pulls on some boxers and an old, worn t-shirt before leaving the room and making his way down to the kitchen.
He’s about to say just that when something catches his attention. Someone is talking to Draco, leaning against the drinks table and moving in far too close for his liking. He can only see the back of the man from where he’s sitting, an unfamiliar and rather muscular man with dark hair. Draco’s type. The blond man himself looks unbothered, cocking his hip and sipping his drink with a ghost of a smirk playing on his lips.
thank you so much to anyone who got to the end! adding this epilogue was unnecessary and completely self indulgent but i hope you liked it anyway
Harry nods, flashing a real smile in return. “Just thinking,” he murmurs, placing his hand over the one on his cheek. It’s painfully intimate, and so unlike them. It’s all he wants.
Draco moans. “Harry,” he says again, the name sounding so unbelievably right coming from his lips. “More—please, right there.”
Draco drops his other hand to start removing his own shirt, getting right to it. Harry can’t help but watch as each inch of pale skin is exposed, along with the thin, perfectly straight scars he left there all those years ago. The first time he’d seen the scars, he’d been unable to touch the blond for weeks afterwards, too overcome with guilt. They talked about it, multiple times over the years, and now the guilt only comes to him on his worst days. All he sees when he looks at Draco now is perfection, flaws included.
“Of course,” he confirms. “I think you might be the only person who hasn’t noticed yet. I’m very obvious, apparently.”
Draco hasn’t said anything, still staring at the ring. “Do you like it?” Harry asks, suddenly unsure. “It’s uh—probably too late to return it now, but I can get you a new one if you don’t.”
oblivious? I’ve been in love with you for over a year!” He shouts, the confession bouncing off the walls before laying itself between them.
Draco left the ministry too, pretty much the same week. He’s not set on anything yet, spending a lot of his time holed up writing novels he won’t let Harry read. It brings him joy and that’s all Harry cares about. Ron and Hermione are the busiest of them all. Ron’s due to start back at work soon now that Hugo is nearly old enough to start at nursery and Hermione is working her way closer and closer to the Minister for Magic position. Harry’s terrified for whoever she runs against when the next election rolls around.
Harry’s floored, gripping on to the back of a chair to stop himself from falling over. A goodbye? He doesn’t understand. He’s almost too afraid to ask. Wonders if maybe things will be different if he pretends he didn’t hear it. He contemplates turning around and leaving the room, going back to bed and hoping Draco will be there when he wakes up. He knows, however, that it’s futile.
“Of course not, dear,” he says with the tone of someone talking to a senile old man. Harry loves him so much it hurts.
“Uncle Harry,” she greets, attempting to whisper but miserably failing. He misses the ‘Hawwy’ phase that she grew out of far quicker than most children. He’s holding out hope for Hugo.
He’s being shaken aggressively, rocked back and forth where he lays by four tiny hands. Cracking a tired eye open, he’s not at all surprised to see Rose and Hugo kneeling beside him in the huge bed, giggling conspiratorially. Rose is seven now, wise beyond her years and increasingly troublesome, Hugo is four and more than happy to be her sidekick.
Sooner than he likes, the other man pulls away. “I’m sorry—I—“ Draco halts, breathing too fast to get any words out. Harry’s startled by it.
Arms come up around his neck, their faces now inches apart. “You’re lucky I’m into cocky bastards, Potter.”
“What are you laughing at?” Draco demands, a slight flush colouring his cheeks. There’s something in his demeanour that suggests he thinks Harry’s laughing
Draco shakes his head, a smile playing at the edge of his lips. “As much as I’d like to see that, it’s fine. One hour.”
He’s so close to asking. It feels like the perfect time, the sun getting ready to set and the sea calm before them. The universe seems to disagree, however, because the second he reaches for his wand to summon the ring, Draco looks away from him and towards the house with a frown on his face.
Draco scoffs. “Forever, it feels like,” he admits, taking a deep breath. “There were feelings I couldn’t explain—at the start, and then it kept happening and I didn’t know how to stop it and then the stupid rules—“
Harry whines pitifully, shoving his head back between his knees. It’s not funny at all. Tragic, maybe.
Rose taps him on the shoulder when the officiant starts speaking and he dutifully puts her down so she can run to sit with her dad in the front row. Ron grins at him, tears already streaming down his face. Molly is sitting next to him with baby Hugo on her lap, she’s gone past crying and straight into full-on sobbing. As expected.
Without even a murmur of hesitation, Draco places his left hand in Harry’s. He presses a kiss to the back of the hand, right over a scar he got from one of his more disastrous attempts at cooking, before sliding the ring onto his waiting finger.
He reaches over to boop her on the nose and Draco swats his hand away with the hand that isn’t holding her up. The movement makes her giggle and it warms him. “Where is your mum? Does she know you’ve run off? You know you have to tell her where you’re going, especially when there’s a lot of people around,” he scolds lightly, causing Draco to roll his eyes at him.
His thrusts falter for a moment, stunned. Cock twitching, he brings up the pace, the grip he has on Draco’s thigh tightening. “Fuck,” he bites out, punctuating the word with a particularly sharp thrust that just misses the bundle of nerves they both want him to hit. “Say it again,” he demands.
Harry shrugs, it doesn’t mean anything. They’re friends now, the others bring their friends to the Burrow—granted, not as often but he’s not going to bring that up. It’s sex, sex and friendship and entirely one-sided feelings. They work well together, understand each other in ways they can’t get with other people.
He’s painfully sober, not having had much time nor much want to drink until this very moment. There were some attempts at dancing, very painful ones mainly thanks to his partner being one glass away from falling over—namely Molly.
“Thank you, Rosie,” he ruffles her curls gently. “Now, everyone, I don’t think you need to do another toast or you’ll all be too drunk to get on the dancefloor—but give it up for the beautiful brides!”
Draco starts laughing beside him, more of a chuckle than a full belly laugh. Harry turns to him with an inquisitive look. "What?" He asks, amused by the way he looks right now, red-faced and puffy-eyed.
Harry’s on the bed in seconds, pushing the smaller man’s long legs apart to settle on his knees between them. He leaves his hands on Draco’s thighs, running his fingers along the soft hairless skin. “You could do all the work if you want,” he quips gently. “I’ll just sit here and watch you touch yourself if that’s what gets you off.”
Harry tried. He tried to fix things between them but was met with stony silence and feigned indifference every time he approached the man.
“I thought you knew me better than that,” he says, accusation leaking into the words. “But clearly not. Clearly, you are as much of an oblivious prick as everyone says.”
and I just want to be left alone with it. He’s never going to love me back and I’m not going to make life hard for him by burdening him with my stupid feelings.”
“You—fuck,” he stutters as Harry repeats the move, smirking. “I just want you,” another broken moan as Harry just barely grazes his prostate, refusing to give him what he needs. “I need you in me. Please.”
At some point, around a year or so after the first party, they fucked for the first time. Harry had been working late, finishing off some paperwork on a case he’d been working on for far too long when Draco had appeared in the doorway to his office looking like an angel backlit by the light from the hallway. His usual ministry robes were gone and, something Harry will never be used to, he was wearing a perfectly tailored suit much more in line with muggle fashion than wizarding.
The thought of Draco thinking that for years hurts more than the thought of him never loving him back. “That’s,” he starts, not quite sure how to word what he wants to say. “That’s such bullshit, I really need you to know that. It was never that for me, ever.”
“Thought you were sucking me off?” he accuses, leaning back against the wall so he doesn’t fall to his knees at the way Draco is looking at him under his lashes.
“So fucking beautiful,” he says again, unable to stop himself. He finds that he’s never meant anything more in his life. Draco is always beautiful, always the most breathtaking person in a room, but here underneath him in this bed, he looks touched by the gods. They’re so close, almost every inch of them pressed against each other, and yet he’s never felt so out of reach. Harry is wholly unworthy of being allowed the privilege of seeing Draco like this.
Draco flushes, pretty and pink. “I’m fine,” he mumbles, uncharacteristically shy. “I’d rather wait till we get home—want you inside me.”
Even with his eyes closed, he feels Draco’s answering smile as strongly as he feels the warmth of the sun on his face. “I love you too,” he replies easily. “I kind of gathered when you told me five minutes ago, and half an hour before that.”
Draco laughs, the stern lines of his perfect face morphing into something somehow even more beautiful. It gets harder and harder to ignore the well of feelings filling up inside of him when he’s right there and so
He sits in the large armchair, tie removed and shirt undone to just above his navel. The ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner does nothing to quell his anxiety, tapping his fingers on his thigh to try and level his breathing.
Blaise starts cackling. A full-bodied, booming laugh that echoes across the field. It’s bordering on manic, a far cry from his usual indifferent demeanour, Harry turns his head to look at him.
It’s not the biggest bedroom in the house but it’s the only one he’s ever felt truly comfortable in. Every other one has always felt too tainted by the lives of the people who came before. There’s a large bed in the middle of the room with crisp white sheets and the softest duvet he’s ever had, black wood bedside tables on either side. The one on the right side, Draco’s side, only has one item resting on top of it; some muggle romance novel he would have hidden from Harry a few years ago but now displays proudly, knowing he’d never judge. Harry’s side is more of a mess, covered in all sorts of trinkets. An alarm clock he never uses, a small and quite ugly cat figurine Teddy had given him once, an extra pair of glasses he’s never needed and countless other useless things.
He does feel very lucky indeed. He presses a kiss to his lips before moving along to his jaw, pressing feather-light teasing kisses into the skin. The soft moan Draco lets out when he kisses the sensitive skin below his ear is the sweetest sound he’s ever heard. Tentatively, afraid of ruining everything, he nips at the spot before sucking a mark into the skin. Draco only holds him tighter, gasping at the sharp pleasure-pain.
“Shut up,” Draco replies. Their hands brush for a second, just a ghost of a touch. He still doesn’t turn to look. “You look good.”
Harry laughs, swatting his arm gently before resuming running his fingers along it; soothing. “It’s nothing bad! I just—there’s something that’s bugging me.”
Harry laughs, pulling her into a one-armed cuddle, bringing Hugo in on the other side. Pressing a kiss to both of their heads in turn, he smiles to himself.
He presses a kiss to Draco’s head, running his fingers through the blond strands. It warms him to know that even then, they were connected somehow. “I’m glad you landed on my doorstep and not someone else’s. I’m glad I let you in.”
“I absolutely do, you’re a fucking tease,” there’s a growl in his voice. A warning. Tired of waiting, he takes matters into his own hand. It takes all of three seconds to push Draco’s hand away and pull his cock out of his boxers, giving it a few tugs to ease the pressure.
Ginny’s grin dims significantly, a frown etching its way onto her pretty face. She levels Draco with a questioning look. “What? You’ve—Everyone’s had their suspicions for years—what do you mean
Harry shakes his head. That’s such a lie that for a moment he doesn’t know how to respond. Draco is far too good for him, has only ever done good for years. All Harry did was one thing he was essentially raised to do, Draco has spent the last ten years making up for the mistakes he would have been forgiven for anyway. Even beyond forgiveness, he does small kind things even when he thinks nobody can see. Harry always sees. He doesn’t think he’s ever possessed the ability to truly take his eyes off him.
Draco drops himself fully into Harry’s lap, both of them breaking the kiss to groan when their crotches brush, the touch barely enough to do anything and yet so maddening. Harry surges back into the kiss, not wanting to be apart for more than two seconds lest one of them decides to open their mouths and ruin everything. He runs his tongue along the bitten lower lip, heart thudding when Draco grants him entrance. Their tongues meet and Harry doesn’t understand how he’s gone so long without this.
“Harry, Draco,” the nod she gives them both in return is accompanied by a grin almost as wide as her face. They’re in trouble and it seems Draco senses it too, his entire body freezing next to Harry’s.
Ginny is due to walk down the aisle any minute. Harry’s trying hard not to search for grey eyes amongst the rows of people.
It’s unlike Draco to get out of bed. Once asleep, he’s not known to wake up until properly rested and ready for the day. Given that they went to sleep just hours ago, he can’t think of a logical reason for Draco to be gone. So, naturally, he worries.
Draco’s searching for something in his face and he wonders what he sees. Wonders if the love he feels is finally slipping through the cracks, unable to be contained.
Draco groans. They’ve been eating healthy all week, Hermione—newly on a health kick—insisting that she cooks every meal. Harry thinks Ron might be bringing out the divorce papers if someone doesn’t take over soon. “I’m going to kill her if I have to eat kale one more time,” Draco declares, probably not exaggerating.
Pressing a kiss to the top of his head, Harry ponders how to word this. “That night, why did you come to me?”
The blond man nods, removing himself from Harry’s lap—much to Harry’s disappointment—and standing up. Harry follows, nearly stumbling when he does so. He grins at Draco sheepishly.
Pushing himself up, he settles back to look at the man beneath him. He hopes, more than anything, that this isn’t the last time he’ll see him like this; in his bed, spread out and beautiful. Shaking off the creeping unpleasant thoughts, he grabs one of the pillows at the head of the bed and helps Draco lift slightly so he can place it beneath his hips.
Everyone’s up and moving about now as the tables are pushed further towards the edges of the tent to make room on the dancefloor. Harry doesn’t move, just stays in his spot at the head table and watches everyone moving around.
Harry frowns, reaching out to boop Rose on the nose. “I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, little one,” he reprimands lightly.
Instantly, he opens them, accepting the two fingers Harry presses in. He moans around them, running his tongue over the digits eagerly. Harry loves that he gets to see him like this, so uncharacteristically submissive. The image of someone else in his place is one he can’t bear to envision. Begrudgingly he pulls the spit-soaked fingers out and moves his hand down their entwined bodies, lifting himself up a little so he can reach between them to wrap his hand around both of their cocks, both of them moaning at the contact.
Eventually, Draco’s inability to wait patiently makes itself known once again. Nimble fingers wrap around his erection, taking him by surprise. He stills his hand, raising an eyebrow at the man below him. He doesn’t get a response, just an incredibly well-practised innocent smile and the feeling of the hand tightening around him. Groaning, he thrusts into the fist.
“Yep,” He confirms, shaking off the urge to grab the man by his tie and break all the rules. “All mine, Salazar Slytherin can go fuck himself.”
“Don’t,” Harry says, firm. He can’t do this, not now, not ever. There’s a reason he’s avoided talking to them about this, it’s a door he’s kept firmly closed for so long that he’s afraid of how much dust is gathering inside, waiting to choke him. “I can’t.”
“Okay love,” he all but whispers. “One more hour, then we’ll leave. They’ll all be too drunk to care by then. Is that okay? We can leave now if you want—I’ll deal with Ginny hexing my balls off.”
He honestly thinks he could kiss him in this broom closet forever, but Draco seems to be on a mission all of his own.
Coming out of the home he’d found in Draco’s neck, he pulls back far enough to see him, their faces close. “You’re so beautiful,” he murmurs, the words barely audible above the sound of Draco’s breathing.
“Okay, okay—you win,” the blond sighs, looking like the words pain him. He lets go of himself, letting it drop back onto his stomach and holding his hands up in defeat.
He breathes a heavy sigh, the cold air turning his breath into swirling clouds. “I’m not having this conversation—Not again, and certainly not with you, Zabini. Loving Draco isn’t some spectator sport for you all to comment on, it’s painful and it’s
Frantic apologies and a discreet spell later they’d made their way home, Harry wondering when Draco had become fluent in French.
By the time the curtain opens, they’re standing apart, trying to look like their worlds haven’t just changed entirely. It’s just two of Ginny’s teammates, a little too merry and seemingly heading home. They don’t pay the two men any notice, just stumble past them and out into the snowy night.
“Demanding,” Harry murmurs, though he obliges, lifting another strawberry up to Draco’s waiting mouth, the juice dripping down his fingers when the perfect teeth take a bite. He can’t help but watch Draco, eyes stuck on the red tint on his lips. If they weren’t likely to be interrupted at any moment, he’d like nothing more than to claim those lips with his own and taste the strawberry for himself. And maybe much more.
“Some very odd noises, so I thought ‘hey, let’s look around and see who’s missing’ and to my surprise, the both of you were nowhere to be found—and then! In you walk together, looking like that,” she rattles off her story like it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to her. Harry would very much like the ground to open up and swallow him whole.
“When you saw it was me—you didn’t leave. Why?” He asks. They weren’t anything but acquaintances at that point.
The realisation that they enjoyed each other’s company came with an even more frightening one. It coursed through him, every inch of his body freezing with the shock of it. He was in love with Draco Malfoy. Had been for so long that it didn’t even register to him until that point, looking at him taking up Harry’s space with no care in the world.
The ceremony passes quickly in a haze of vows and the soft glow of the marriage bonds being formed. Ever since the first wizarding wedding he attended, he’s been fascinated by the difference in customs. It’s always a sight to see, the threads of magic weaving around the clasped hands and joining them in a way he’ll never be able to fully comprehend.
Why now? After all these years. Why kiss him like it’s his only reason for living and say his name like it belongs on his lips and still deny that there’s anything between them but sex? He feels like he might be sick.
“I don’t do that,” the redhead woman interrupts, making everyone laugh. She absolutely does do that, has almost caught Draco in his bed multiple times doing it. He’s had to change his wards countless times over the years.
He doesn’t want this to end. He gets the feeling Draco feels the same, the both of them completely connected for what feels like the first time.
“I’m awake,” he grumbles, rubbing his eyes and shifting into a seated position against the headboard. Thankfully, he’s dressed.
“One of my biggest regrets in life will forever be missing out on seeing that for myself, pensieve memories just don’t do it justice,” Harry says with a laugh. “I’m so glad it worked out though, I’m so glad you survived all the dramas that come with planning a wedding this beautiful and made it here. I love you both a lot, I wish you many years of happiness and offer my services if you ever need a babysitter in the future,” he adds on with a wink.
Ron scoffs. “That’s bullshit and you know it is,” He pauses to take a sip of a drink that lays discarded on the table. Harry’s pretty sure it isn’t his but he decides not to say anything. “I was in love with Hermione for years before ever saying anything about it, how do I not understand?”
Before he even realises what he’s doing, he’s out of his chair and crossing the tent in swift strides. Sidling up next to the pair, he barely looks at Draco before checking out the offending man. It’s another fucking quidditch player. Rory something, from the Irish team. The man looks a little put out at the intrusion before he registers just who’s intruded on their flirting.
" my dad is obsessed with muggle technology. Says its so much more interesting." He says coolly. I nod understandably.
" what do i do? He said he wants a platonic relationship." I put my head back, resting it on the back of the couch. Pansy sits down and puts her head on my shoulder, draco lays his head down on my lap.
Without thinking i slid into bed with him, bringing his blanket up to cover us both. I snaked my arms around his torso and dug my head into his shoulder, taking in his scent. He tensed at my touch, but relaxed soon enough.
It was 9 pm. We were 4 hours into the party and the worst thing that could have ever happened to me just walked in through the door. Adam.
" 5 pm to midnight. We need to arrive at the manor an hour early to get ready there. Its just easier." Blaise shrugs.
He pointed his finger at me and pushed my chest. I looked over to blaise. He was sitting there just looking at me with tear streaks on his face.
It was faint, but i could still hear it so clearly. He reached for my hand and grasped it tight and smiled.
She gestured towards harry who was sprawled out on the hospital bed. I walked over to him and sat down on his bed. He was unconscious, like most times i did this. I took off his ventilator mask and hesitated.
I was on the brink of tears. He glared daggers into me and i felt the stab of each and every one of them. His gaze hardened and thats when i knew i could never change his mind. I shut my eyes closed and nodded.
At first it was just a few petals, then it was a handful, until it was a full flower and now i was practically throwing up bouquets. The gallons of blood i had coughed up washed away as i turned on the sink faucet, taking the petals with it.
My chest constricted. The pain didnt subside and i fell back in the chair i was sitting in. Soon, i fell asleep too.
" in the past month, i grew to love harry like a brother. And it pains me that you, my best friend are the reason he is dying, so please dont make the mistake of letting him go." Blaise said quietly. Ron walked over to him and hugged him by the waist, blaise resting his head on rons shoulder.
" oh don't talk none sense. Call me Lorelei. " she brushes off the shoulders of my robes, much like Blaise.
" a-adam. He came over, he proposed to me. " i felt rons grip tighten a little more, like he was afraid to lose me.
" of course blaise. Its my job." She chuckles lightly. We seperate and she gives a small smile to hermione before joining her on the bench.
" ron stop. You cant ruin this even more." The crowd circled us. Draco comes back with Hermione and Pansy, running to me. Pansy came right up to Adam and slaps him across the face. Hermione flinches while helping me calm down.
" wedding planning SUCKS." Blaise complained as he trudged into the manor. Ron came in after him, rubbing his fiancé's shoulders.
" what?" He finally squeaks out. I dont wait to respond. Instead i pull him closer and connect our lips. He gasps slightly before closing his eyes and kissing me back. The people around us gasp and 'awwww'. We finally pull away to see Draco, Hermione, Pansy, harry and the three heathens standing there.
I hear the announcer yell over the speakers. The entire crowd cheers as they look at the screen. A lovely couple is chosen for the first one. They give each other a peck and the game resumes. This goes on several more times. Every time a couple is chosen the arena yells " kiss, kiss, kiss!". I wonder what is so fascinating about seeing two people publicly show affection?
The room felt hot and stuffy and my blanket was spread out on the floor. My eyes were red from the crying and not being able to sleep. my body felt weak.
I sinked down to the floor, leaning against the wall and grabbed my book bag. I took out the swirling blue potion and opened the bottle. It wasn't unpleasant like i thought it would he. It smelled like mint and berries although the taste did not correspond to the scent at all. I shivered from the potion and stood up. The burning in my throat disappeared and the nausea i often get disappeared.
" thank you." He whispered into my shoulder. My confusion broke out into a smile and i hugged him back.
I finally stepped out of the shower, shivering from the sudden coldness. I used a drying spell and quickly dried myself. I was halfway through dressing when it came. A cough attack.
I was so focused on the photos i didnt even hear the fact that the yelling had stopped. I looked over the office more and more until i heard a door slam shut downstairs. Seconds later blaise entered the office, obviously frustrated. He sighed and grabbed a bottle of firewhiskey from the little tray table beside the door. He poured the ember liquid into a glass and took a big swig. I stared in his direction, my hands in my pockets.
We finally separated from each other after what felt like an eternity of complete bliss. I opened my eyes first. I saw as the redheads eyes fluttered open. Just As he opened his eyes, the Chudley Canons seeker caught the snitch. The crowd went crazy. Everything was so loud but Ron and i stayed staring at each other. A slow but genuine smile spread across both mine and his face. As the announcer announced the scores we finally turned back to the arena.
Me, hermione and blaise were running down to the infirmary. Pomfrey called McGonagal this morning, informing her that she had found harry in the bathroom unconscious and bleeding.
He's never gonna love me back anyway. There isn't a point in hoping. Im just putting the people i love in pain by staying.
" no its not. I got........jealous of you and ron while you were planning such a nice gesture and i ruined it." Harry said disappointedly.
" who was my surgeon?" Draco opens his mouth to answer but he stops when we hear the door slide open. We both turn towards it. There standing at the doorway was Cormac bleeding Mclaggen. We had a summer fling in the 7th year, but i ended it because i realized i wasn't really in love with him. Draco turns back to me and sighs.
" hey, i got a letter from your mum. She wants us to have dinner with her. Thought you should know. Also come to grimmauld today before dinner. Bring draco with you, harry is whining.
I ran out the library and into the nearest bathroom. I choked out the petals and after an extremely unpleasant 5 minutes, all the flowers were gone. I wiped away the blood from my lips and rinsed out my mouth.
I grabbed my wand and muttered wringardium leviosa. The chess pieces floated up and neatly placed themselves on my nightstand.
I wave at the house elf and we walk to what i assume is the dining room. He pushed open the large wooden doors leading to a beautiful room with a large long table in the center.
Pomfrey came rushing in and stopped mid step when she saw me. Her eyes widened as big as dinner plates and she immediately went to work.
" ok but just for now, lets not..... consummate as kingsley put it. But i think we should tell our partners about the agreement, see how they react." I said.
I said back with a painted smile. The thoughts in my head still weren't clear and i didnt want to think too much of it.
" MINISTRY OF MAGIC!" I yelled loudly. The green flames engulfed me and soon i landed on the first floor of the Ministry. I shook off the ash from my shoulders and walked to the side. Harry and Hermione appeared about 2 minutes later, then we walked towards the elevators. We came up onto the 4th floor, the minister's office. We walked out and proceeded down the hallway to Kingsleys office. We stopped at the door and i knocked slowly. We heard a muffled " come in" so i twisted the doorknob. When we walked in we saw three things. What seemed like a blood test on Kingsleys desk, pansy and draco siting on a couch next to the fire, and Blaise, sitting in one of the chairs opposite of the desk. I walked over to them and sat in the other one. Hermione and harry sat on the couches, trying desperately to keep themselves put together.
I woke up in a hospital room. I felt disoriented, then i realized someone was holding my hand. I turn my head over, wincing as doing so. There Blaise was, holding my hand in both of his. He was asleep, he looked exhausted. His dress shirt was unbuttoned and disheveled, his shoulders slumped down but his grip on my hand was surprisingly firm. I smile at the scene before me, rubbing small circles on the back of his hand.
" i love him!" Blaise shouted, gesturing towards me. I froze, wait was this true? Hermione and pansy gasped. Harry and Dracos arms dropped from me. Adam, cormac and Lavender looked as if they were told the world was ending.
" and you expect us all to be fine with it? You have less than a week left harry! For all i know you could die at this very moment!"
" wait no. Not exactly. Well not legally or technically. Its complicated." I stammered out. anyone in our situation would have agreed, it was difficult to explain.
" hes my fiancé. See? The paramedics took off his ring because it had an enchantment on it. I kept it" blaise slipped my ring back onto my left hand. He raised his matching white band.
A/N: i know this is super short but i rlly wanted to end it on this adorable note so yeah. I will write more next chapter.
" something to do with Draco, blah blah blah." I finished for him. He shook his head and took in a deep breathe.
" why dont you go upstairs? Wait in my office." I said to Ron. He nodded and ran up the stairs. I watched him disappear into the second floor before turning towards my confused boyfriend.
" you are the one who is in love with him but too much of a pussy to say it. And now he is dying because you wouldn't tell him you're true feelings and now he thinks you've rejected him!"
Moments later he opened his eyes and immediately started coughing. I supported his back as he sat up and coughed up the rest of his petals.
" okay, i need to sit on you lovesac." Draco said before jumping towards it and landing in the bundle. Me and ron started bursting out laughing when harry walked in from the kitchen. He was too shirtless, and from the corner of my eye i could see draco squirm a little.
" now stand on the stage and ill take your measurements, it will only be a minute." She flicked her wand and a measuring tape flew towards ron. He lifted his arms while the tape started measuring his waist and chest. I took a seat opposite if him, watching the tape flow around his body.
" can we grab a coffee later so we can talk about our situation?" I asked. He nodded and looked at the other four. I looked at them as well and saw that they had paired up and was in riveting conversations already ( Draco +harry, Hermione+ pansy btw).
" alright then, lets get your measurements honey." She motioned ron to follow her to the corner with mirrors.
I sat opposite of her in a dark room. An auror was standing by the door, waiting for us to finish. I know i wasn't getting married right away, but in 5 years, my mother may not be here. Or at least her mind wont.
" oh it is so good to see you my darling." Mother said while patting my back. I bent down to reach her level as i towered over her.
" okay. Blaise is sleeping." He nods and walks over to blaises chair, tilting it and dumping Blaise out of it. Blaise woke up with a start and fell off his chair, landing on his butt. He frantically looks around before standing up and nonchalantly sitting back in his chair, legs crossed. All was silent, until draco and i burst out laughing . Blaise scoffed and walked to the door.
After I broke up with Adam, me and ron started spending a lot of time together. It may have had to do with the fact that Hermione and Pansy were now officially dating but still. This made the whole fiancé thing so much easier and it was a lot more fun this way.
" how the fuck can you lay there and tell us that? I am not fucking giving up on you! You asshole, i will find that motherfucker and i will make him love you even if its the last thing i do!"
" yes." I whispered before we both got up and walked to the kitchen. He had already made dinner which was always a nice surprise to come back to. We sat down at the kitchen island and ate our dinner. We talked while eating and in no time we were both done. I grabbed our plates and set them in the sink to wash them. I started running the tap and grabbed the sponge.
" oh and tell Ronald i want to meet him!" She yells right as i apparate. I apparated into my living room and almost jumped out of my skin when i saw Weasley standing by the kitchen island.
" you too dear. Well it was great having dinner with you darlings. Ill see you at the engagement party next week." She moves over to blaise and kisses his cheek.
I see Adam standing behind blaise, scowling and glowering. I turn away from Blaise for a moment to look at him, a small grin evident on my face.
" why would i be? My boyfriend is just discussing "nothing" with my best friend behind my back is all. Why would i ever be mad?"
" but i am not getting married yet. In 5 years. Harry made me promise him 5 years." I looked down at my lap. She hummed and tapped her nails on the table.
" oh hey. " ron said with a large smile, motioning us to come in. I returned it to him and walked into the apartment. Unlike the corridors and the outside, the inside was warm and cozy. Almost like it was wrapped in a blanket. There were floating candles all over the ceiling, book shelves filled one of the back walls, and the yellow light reflected off the gold detailing on the walls.
" trust me harry. As his best friend, i can tell he does. It isnt a matter of whether your silly high school crush likes you, its a matter of life or death. And for the first fucking time in your life, put your own life before someone else's, please for the love of god."
" yeah, It is. I love him. So will you leave me the fuck alone? Im not going to marry you!" Blaise yelled at adam. He then turned to me and bit his lip. I was so shocked all i could do was blink. He looked down and nodded.
Tears formed on my face as i ran down to the infirmary as fast as I possibly could. I passed students and teachers all while running at the speed of light. I bust through the infirmary doors, probably giving Pomfrey quite a shock. I frantically looked around the room when I finally spotted him.
I couldnt help the tears from falling. My hand came up to my face and i covered my mouth, stopping myself from screaming out in anguish.
I waited until his breathing evened. I waited until his eyes fluttered closed and i was absolutely sure he wasn't awake.
The healers spelled ron onto the trolley and flew away. I watched as they left without a word. Harry put a hand on my shoulder.
" yeah got ur gallon of cologne?" Harry snapped back with a sweet smile. Blaise and I made a small laugh. Draco sneered back at Harry.
" its fine. You can do it after dinner. Come on. They are coming soon." Harry led draco down the stairs and into the kitchen where everything was organized. Harry put on his chef's apron and got to work. He flicked his wand and pots and pans flew out the cupboards, landing on the stove. Ingredients floated out of the fridge and proceeded to cut and dice themselves as harry put water in the pots for the pasta.
" no he's meeting the minister WITH YOU!" Hermione yelled slightly. I shook my head and stood up from my bed.
" splinched. I didn't even know until he fell down." I grab my scarf and tie it around his arm to stop the bleeding.
Pomfrey came into the room. I nodded to her and she nodded back. She gave me my medicine for the night and left. I took my pills and my potions and laid back down.
Harry scoffed and walked through the archway that led to harry's office. Both their offices had an open floor plan, one huge office with a arch way in the middle. Draco's was a little bit bigger as harry had a bigger office at hogwarts. There was a glass sliding door in the arch way so that they would get some peace and quiet, but still be able to see eachother.
" what are you waiting for? Chop chop, we dont have all day." I clap my hands twice and motion for him to go change. Without hesitation he runs towards the stairs up to his room.
I shifted away from him, trying not to wake him up. I got off my bed and walked over to the window. I sighed and opened the curtains more.
" Lady Zabini is in the Dining room. Buddy created a dinner for you all, it is waiting in the kitchen."
A few moments ago i was arguing with blaise about my patronus, and now my blood was boiling from rage.
" i was supposed to have 3 months. Three . Now i have less than half a month." I whimpered. She reached over and hugged me. Tighter than ever. Like i was breaking to pieces and she had to keep them together. I muzzled my face into the crook of her neck, sobbing silent tears. She and i cried for what felt like hours, keeping the same position.
She and hermione left the room and just left me and harry. I rubbed harrys back and brought the bucket over.
" goodnight, blaise." He whispered before turning off the light and walking out. What he didnt see was Blaise Zabini's eyes opening a few monents after ron closed the door.
" excuse me? No. Im not going to leave everyone i love for you. They are my life, you realise that?" I say. I pull his arms off me and walk into the living room.
Ron, blaise and i paced around the infirmary doors. Rons leg anxiously went up and down and Blaise looked like he was on the verge of tears.
Draco and harry rolled their eyes as their two kids walked into the foyer where they were sitting having tea. Lilly and Scorpius were both 15, 5th years at hogwarts. Harry and draco adopted the twins at age two, 2 years after they got married, 3 years after draco proposed.
The healer spoke softly. Hermione rubbed harrys back and ron stood arms crossed, as if he needed to protect harry at all costs, even from his deadly disease.
I whipped my head around towards the voice. It was harry. His eyes were red and puffy but he was still smiling.
" i was born ready. Are you ready to be completely babied by my mom and tortured by my brothers? I have 5 of them." i teased back. He chuckled and nodded.
" nobody has ever gotten as far as stage 4" Harry whispered. Ron looked at his best friend, who for the first time they have known each other, looked weak and frail. His body shook as he struggled to keep awake.
" oh were not together. But i am hoping to change that soon." I let out my laugh and held onto rons shoulder. We chuckled silently at harry, who had been staring bewildered at draco for a solid 30 seconds. Madam malkins smiled sweetly and let out a small laugh.
This wasn't supposed to happen. It was just a dare. Make draco malfoy fall in love with you. How did i end up here?
" shh ron. Its alright. Im going to be okay." Harry hugged his best friend, the tears still evident on his face.
" he's gonna be at the ministry today, with you." Hermione answered. I raised my eyebrows but i wasn't really all that shocked.
Harry looked around them for a second. He was surrounded by the people he loved, going to the place he called a second home. He had children with the love of his life when just 20 years ago, he was dying because he thought draco would never love him back. His friends were all also happy and had children of their own.
Draco muzzled his face into harrys shoulder and sighed. Harry was still frozen, the place where draco had his face felt like it was burning under his breath.
After McGonagal was informed of my condition, she allowed me to stay in a private room with ron rather than out normal 5 person dorm. My condition was worsening, and the only relief i got was when i was with draco.
" awwwww." She says before hugging us both, hermione soon joining. Harry and Draco give each other a peck and look at us. When they step away from us we stay still. Our foreheads connected.
" WHAT?" Harry immediately jumps up. Their tired faces were completely gone. They shared a look of confusion and interest.
My mind went back to the dare. The stupid, stupid dare. Making draco malfoy fall in love with me. We were in our 8th year, the triumph of the year before was still ablaze, and my fellow gryffindors thought it would be an amazing idea to give me that task. I took it obviously, albeit a bit reluctantly.
Ron frantically weaved through the crowd, trying to find blaise. At the same time blaise was doing the same thing. They finally met each other in the center of a full crowd. This engagement party was more of a ball than a party. Well what were they expecting? A Zabini threw it.
"What the hell blaise? You scared the living shit out of me..." he looked up and saw me. His face of nuisance shifted to one of worry. He went around his desk to me and grabbed my shoulders. I let out a shuddered breathe and immediately fell into his embrace. He hugged me tightly and rubbed my back.
" anyway. You were splinched. You had some internal bleeding but we got it covered before you lost too much blood." I nod as he explains the procedures and what i was treated with.
" what?" He asks in surprise. I nod and confirm what he did hear was in fact true. He stands up quickly and makes a squealing noise before running to get his wand. He makes a quick patronus and sends it to pansy. He then turns back to me with a serious face.
The room fell silent. I stood up to interact with my new patronus. I touched the tip of its nose and it snaked itself around me, reminding me of happy memories.
" wait so what does that mean? Are you two dating?" He points at me and blaise with his pen. I swallowed the lump in my throat. Blaise held my hand tighter.
" I understand perfectly well that you are concerned for your friend but Mr.Malfoy you need to get out-"
" oh hes at work. Apparently he couldn't get the day off but he will be here to pick you guys up for Christmas." She nodded. Draco smiled at her and started a conversation.
" okay no. We can salvage this! Its fine... we'll just ummm.... ignore them." Blaise says, grabbing Rons wrists. Ron nods solemnly and pulls Blaise in for a hug. They stand there hugging each other, not wanting to deal with either of their exes.
Sirius was 19, orion was 18 and Tobias was the oldest, 21. Tobi was 6 when they adopted him, sirius was 4 and orion was 3. All three also graduated hogwarts just a few years ago and made it a tradition to see their younger siblings and their dad off to hogwarts every year.
" well i dont see it that way Malfoy! Im doing you a favor by not gettting the surgery believe me. I dont know who i would be without them okay?"
" a few more minutes. I promise i'll let you go then" he mumbled in a low voice. I nodded and laid my head back down on his chest. If i could, i would live this moment forever.
" i dont know. It makes him look like and upside down carrot." Blaise and draco peeped into my bedroom to see how it looked. I was wearing a dark green robe with black panels and silver detailing.
" i like carrying stuff. And organizing is my favorite part anyway. If you wont help me lift them could you at least levitate these to the kitchens?" Draco nodded towards the kitchen.
" okay. Alright i gotta go get Draco and Harry in case we need a bouncer. Also i really need to make fun of Draco for being short. Being around you makes me feel like a midget." Blaise jokes. I laugh along and bite my lip. Blaise was 6'1, but i was 6'4. I mean what did they expect? Have they even seen the family i come from? To be fair im taller than most of them, except fred and George.
I ran to his side and looked down at my best friend. His shaggy black hair was a mess and his face and chest had trails of blood on them. But other than the horrible condition he was in, he looked almost.... peaceful. Like he was dreaming something nice.
" oh shove off. Stupid smitten redhead." Pansy muttered under her breathe as she walked off and laid next to hermione, putting her head in her lap just like she did for Draco.
" so, transfiguration. Anyone got their notes?" Draco asked as he grabbed a book and handed it to harry who was practically falling asleep.
" i should take her to the dungeons." Blaise stumbled over to her. He almost fell but ron caught him before he did.
" i have been kind of looking for a reason to break up with lav. Believe it or not she and i aren't really the best couple." I say the last sentence sarcastically. Blaise chuckled softly and looks back at me. We stare at each other for a short moment before i broke it.
I groaned as i propped myself on my elbow. My head felt like an anvil just got dropped on it and i was this close to just doubling over and never getting up.
After lunch we went to the manor. We acciod our supplies from Grimmauld and met Draco, Theo and Goyle at the entrance.
I sighed and threw the letter on my desk. Eris cooed and stepped closer to me. I handed her a treat from the little dish sitting on the corner of my desk and scratched under her wing. She made a little happy 'hoot' and left to do what i presume , is hunting.
We were finally at Zabini Manor. After an hour of trying to pick out what i wear we were finally here.
" i know, but then i wouldnt have been able to show off that i know that spell." Harry said triumphantly. Hermione scoffed and turned away.
My thoughts ran as i laid hopelessly on my hospital bed. I stared at the ceiling, the room lit by the moonlight.
" ENOUGH! I don't want a platonic relationship, i don't want to just call him my fiancé as a joke or pet name, i don't want to be just his friend." I snapped. Harry and Hermione looked at me in worry.
She looked up at me. I could see the sadness swirling in her eyes. I could see how she didnt want to answer, how she didnt want to believe it. She looked up at the ceiling and swallowed hard.
Ive been beside harrys bed for three days now. I sleep in the infirmary on a bed next to him, i wake up before him so he doesnt have to feel lonely, and after school i bring his homework. It was our routine.
" hey guys. Did you get your suits?" Hermione asked while pansy was looking at some new type of firecracker george had created.
Me, Hermione and harry each had a pint of ice cream and were now eating in the kitchen. I was sitting on the barstool as Hermione was propped up on the counter and harry leaned over the sink.
" oh! Thats called a kiss cam. Its magicked so that they only point towards people with chemistry between them. Normal muggle ones don't have those enchantments tho." He answers.
" we have magic dear, why dont you just levitate them." Harry said when walking through the front door of the newly replenished malfoy manor, now renamed Potter Villa.
I woke up with a jolt from my alarm clock. I turned towards the nightstand to see the device flashing 9 o'clock in bright bold numbers. I remembered i had to meet Kingsley today so I groaned and sat up on my bed, propping myself on my elbows. I stood up and looked out the window of Grimmauld place. Harry ,Hermione and i had moved in together after school ended, about 5 years ago.
" okay. Have fun. Ill get you later." I say and wave goodbye. He kisses my cheek and pulls away. I feel heat rising to my face and i quickly run off to find Hermione.
" no." I mutter. Adam looked like he had been slapped. His face was filled with sadness and shock but contorted into anger and fury.
" you were gonna propose again." Harry said through his hands, thoroughly embarrassed by his own behavior.
I run down the stairs, yelling for Him. I see him in the middle of the crowd and i run over. I reach for his arm and grab onto it.
" oh right. Sorry haha." Blaise laughed. The four walked out the room, leaving harry and draco alone.
" alrighty then. I must go to my chambers as there is a massive hangover waiting for me in the morning." Pansy wobbled to the door.
They stopped by the slytherin dorms for something and that something was 2 bottles of muggle whiskey pansy had managed to smuggle into her room. They were 1 bottle in and Blaise was asking draco now.
" no need to trample me as your doing it!" She shrieked. Blaise rolled his eyes and grabbed the book from rons hand.
" oi draco, Where were you! We were supposed to have breakfast this morning." Blaise came running into the room, abruptly stopping when he saw harry and draco on the couch.
"Are you dating anyone?" Blaise pulled me out of my thoughts. I remembered the ring and turned a little red.
" shit." He cursed as he was bent over the bucket, throwing up flowers. When he was done he looked up at me and smiled.
Suddenly we heard a loud 'pop'. We both turned back to the living room. There we saw a very confused redhead standing up from where he had landed. He turned towards us before his eyes went wide and his hand landed over his eyes. He turned his back towards us.
Harry and draco's other three sons came into the platform. Sirius rest his hand on his dads shoulder while panting, trying to catch his breath.
" i cant let you run off and possibly catch hanahaki like that. I dont need to lose two people i love."
" the fucking rings remember?" He said holding up his left hand. I exhaled loudly and pinched the bridge of my nose. The damn rings.
Hermione sighed sadly and looked at me. A tear rolled off her face before she took out her wand and started muttering the spells.
She rushed to my side with the potion. I managed to guzzle it down. It soothed my throat for a little while. Until the coughing started again. It was much worse than before. Mounds of petals fell from my mouth. And then......... a leaf. A leaf came out. Then a pile of them. Soon i was hacking nothing but leaves.
" it leaves out his hair though. Makes it stick out." Harry commented from behind them. Draco nods in agreement.
" fine. Ill go. Dinner is at 9 and the whole gang is coming so be nice okay?" Harry kissed draco's cheek, immediately lifting his mood.
" i love you too." I cut him off. He immediately stops to look at me. We stare at eachother for what feels like eternity. His body was turned away while his head was facing me.
When he was finally relaxed, i looked down at the bucket. I examined the flowers, narcissus flowers. They were covered in blood but i realized it wasn't only just petals but also leaves and bits of stem too. I grimaced at the thought of having flower stems up your throat. I put the bucket in the bathroom and grabbed a washcloth. I wet it slightly and sat down on harrys bed, wiping his mouth of the blood.
I woke up to the sun shining in my face. The curtains were pulled back a little and a beam of light was passing through.
" come on loverboy. Why so salty?" Harry coos. I scoff and keep walking. When we enter we see pansy and hermione in an arm wrestling competition and blaise keeping rep.
In the early stages of my disease, even a whiff of his cologne could send me choking. But now i learned to control it and it wasn't so often. Even if my condition worsened, my control increased. Its the only way i could keep it hidden for so long.
" yes right now. Come on lets go!" He says yanking me towards the door. I sigh in defeat and grab my keys before being rushed out the door.
Blaise offered his hand and i took it. He pulled me up and i stood next to ron and him. I turned to him fully and hugged him tight.
"I love you draco. And because of it im dying. But id rather love you and die than forget you and live."
" and i said no. When i did he became furious. He grabbed m-my a-arm and..." i drifted into sobs. He hugged me and rubbed circles on my bad.
" how is this going to work? Are we going to break up with them? Do we move in together? Do we start a relationship?" I ask. Blaise furrows his eyebrows and shrugs.
" ive missed you." He whispered into my ear. It sent a shiver down my spine, and not in the good kind.
After the game we walked back to my house. We walked in comfortable silence, like we often did. When we came to my front door, we stopped at my doorstep.
" whats the point then? What am i doing here? Why am i here day and night tending to you? Why am i here comforting you while you are in love with SOMEONE ELSE!"
I blurted out. Hermione dropped the bottle of potion she was holding and gasped. Madam Pomfrey looked at me in shock and then turned to hermione.
" Call the ambulance, its too dangerous to floo and we definitely cant apparate again." I yell as i put pressure on his abdomen, where the wound was the worst.
It had been a week since Rons accident, and it was the day before the engagement party at the manor. Draco, pansy and i were getting ready to go to diagon alley where we were gonna meet Ron, Hermione and Harry. Pansy wanted to get a new dress and i thought this would be a good opportunity to get Ron some new suits and robes for the party.
" hey. So i thought we would get you some new suits for the party. My mother said nothing black because it makes you look drab so we should get a few more options." He nods and listens. His arm was propped up on the edge of the booth top, right behind my back. He smiles at me and takes a swig from his butterbeer. That smile ill never get tired of. After about an hour of sitting there, we came up with a plan.
" oh hermione thinks that she can beat pansy because she has better upper body and core muscles and also because she has been fighting with you two since she was 11, but pansy thinks she can beat her because she is determined." Blaise nods and goes back to the two girls.
" here you go. Make sure to save some of it." She smiles as she hands the 5 gold pieces to the ecstatic house elf.
" screw them. They are the reason why you are in this situation anyway. Lets leave together. You will have me, wont you?" He said hugging me by the waist once again. The once sweet and comforting action felt suffocating and controlling.
I nodded reluctantly as she called for ron. He came in a few seconds later, she grabbed both our arms and we vanished.
" ok." Blaise nodded and pulled out his wand. He muttered the spell and a wisp of blue came out. It morphed into a horned serpent and soon slid out of the room after blaise gave it its message.
I walked to Harry's area and peaked through the curtain. Harry was curled up into a ball in his blankets, he was shivering. The infirmary was cold but not that bad.
" do you want to know what we were talking about?" Draco asked calmly, rather amused of his boyfriend's jealousy over such a trivial thing.
I grabbed onto his hand and sat down beside him. It was one thing when he was dying of just hanahaki but it was a whole other when he was also in need of two full pints of blood.
" look we dont have to-" he starts but u cut him off. I grabbed him by his Chudley Canons scarf and pulled him close. He bent down to reach me as i connected out lips together. The arena went wild. Cheers could be heard from both viewers and the players. It was honestly surreal. In the moment it felt like nothing but us existed. The way he and I fell together felt so.... perfect. It was never like this with Adam. Never.
" no Ms.Pomfrey. Its alright. You didnt know so how could you have helped me? Im okay. No need to apologize."
" thank you lady Zabini, buddy is very grateful." He bows before quickly scurrying off. Mother and i keep talking during lunch. Before long i realized it was almost 3 pm and that i should be getting home. My mother walks me to the door and hugs me goodbye.
" whenever we go somewhere you only get tea. Its chamomile." I say and got back to my own mug. I see him shrug and take a sip, smiling when bringing it down. That fucking smile that could break you heart.
" that you're the one he loves!" Ron looked at draco who looked at me. I covered my face with my hand and closed my eyes. Ron you absolute fucking-
He looked pale and sickly. His face was sunken in and he looked so drained. He looked like he was just sucked by a dementor.
" why do you think i dont mind sitting with him? Sharing a scarf? Cuddling, sleeping, spending the night in his room. Helping him in potions, hanging out with his friends. Its all because of him. It doesn't help that i get aroused by the secret language he speaks too." Draco laid his head on the table.
" i have hanahaki. A disease born from unrequited love or rejection. Im in my final stages." He whispered so quietly, like if he said it any louder his voice would shatter.
" hes dying. Hes got 2 weeks tops to live. If he continues like this he will be gone by the end of the week."
" anyway..... this is about, Blaise." Harry finally managed to squeak out. This got my attention. Draco, Harry, Hermione and pansy may have been getting along very well lately but me and blaise were still in shaky terms. We were friends, but more like good acquaintances. We at least could stand each-other now so that was good.
I started hacking violently into the sink. Piles of blood and flower came up. My body ached and tensed, my muscles contracting. I doubled over and fell to the floor. It must have been loud because the next thing i hear is ron bursting into the room.
" oh ummm Cormac." I mumble out, eyeing him up and down. I tower over him with my tall figure. He looks up at me with a sickening smile.
" yes it is. You are dismissed." He nodded. We both stood up and went for the door. The other 4 followed us, pansy grabbing onto Hermione, trying not to fall. Hermione was blushing but she somehow managed to hide it. I turned towards Zabini.
" yeah. He spent the night at my house, be appeared in my office late at night." His anger continued
" um yeah but also because some of his personal info was missing." Mclaggen had reached out and shook his hand.
" ready to apparate?" Blaise turned to me. I nod in confirmation. He holds on tighter, i glanced over to him and for a second, just one moment, seeing his face lit by the moonlight, seeing him smile at me, I forgot everything. This only lasts for a second until  we were being warped to our destination. His face was gone, but i felt his touch. Suddenly, a sharp pain went through my stomach.
I roll my eyes and take my wool gryffindor scarf off. I wrapped it around dracos neck and saw him immediately relax. The scarf had heating charms on it and it was a gift from Mrs.Weasley for Christmas.
" i do like him like that. Ive had a massive crush on him ever since 1st year. I rejected him last month because astoria kept following me around and my father was still alive. If i started dating a bloke then all of the pureblood families would know and i would be done for. I needed their support. At least until i was head of house and i became that. So now there is nothing stopping us from being together. Only him and his stupid ass not liking me back."
" yeah.... of course." He mutters. I nod and open my door. Before entering however i turn back and kiss Ron on the cheek. He turns just as red as he did at the game. I give him a Sweet smile.
Draco watched as harry carefully took out the healing potions draco had brewed for him and placed them in a glass shelf, easily displayed and readily accessible. He watched as harry replaced the already finishing floo powder next to the fireplace and tucked away the bag full of green powder into a nearby drawer. After harry had successfully organized his office and put everything away, he proudly looked over at draco, who was still watching him carefully.
" anyway. Relationship status. You're still with Lavender right-?" Cormac took out his pen again and started writing.
I stared at him, still smiling. I lifted his hand up to my face and placed a gentle kiss on it. I turned my head towards the entrance as the door slid open and revealed draco in his healer robes. He looked over at me and smiled, closing the door behind him.
I realized i wouldnt get anywhere at this state and pulled myself up from bed. I grabbed one of harrys hoodies he gave me and snuck out of my dorm. I was in my boxers and i was walking around the castle floor.
The infirmary was cold today. Ron and draco stopped visiting since last week. I heard that draco knew what happened to me and still chose not to come. I felt heartbroken, but you cant break something that is already broken.
He laughed and walked over to me. He wrapped his arms around my waist and sighed while resting his chin on my head. A light pink dusted my cheeks while he continued to hug me. He swayed from side to side, taking me along with him. It was peaceful, until we were interrupted.
Suddenly draco scoots closer to me and wrapped the scarf around me too. He rested his head on my shoulder so it was more comfortable for us to share the scarf.
" i dont think we have to, i mean i don't really want to break up with Adam. Do you want to break up with lavender?" He asks me. This time i was the one to furrow my eyebrows.
Draco nodded a response and continued his book. I listened to his heart beat, allowing myself to drift off.
He brought his hands up and ran them through my hair as i leaned forward and deepened the kiss. He pulled back and smiled at me wide.
" you motherfucker, you did it!" He hugged me first. He engulfed me in a bear hug and turned towards harry that looked confused.
" harry!" Hermione went to hug him but he winced at her touch. The bandages and cuts still very fresh.
" we.... ran.... all the way..... from .... diagon alley...." Hermione panted, holding onto her sides. I nodded slightly and went back to dressing.
It was the day of the party. Blaise had spent the night at Grimmauld because of an incident with his ex. I let him sleep in my bed while i slept in my office. I woke up and walked down the stairs to see harry, hermione and pansy having breakfast by the kitchen counter.
" Its the only way we can be together. So, will you marry me?" He asked the damn question. I froze, i wanted to say something but the shock completely overwhelmed me.
" hello. My my how big you have all gotten. I remember measuring you for your first year at hogwarts! Now how may i help you?" She clapped her hands and smiled.
" but you have me! What more could you want?" He asked. I stared at him in a mix of anger and sadness. This was going to be a long fight.
"hes great. He spent the night at my house last night." This caused his face to turn serious and angry. Just to spite the asshole, i decided to tease him a bit.
He has cough attacks throughout the day, and im always there to sooth him. Blaise visits a lot too, along with pansy, luna and ginny. A lot of the gryffindors and the occasional fan girls flock the infirmary during after school hours, but im always the only one to stay.
I stood up, careful to not make any noise. I walked to the bathroom and turned on the lights. I squinted at the sudden brightness of the room and proceeded to walk towards the sink. I kept most of my things here now, since I'm gonna be here literally until the day i die.
" well if you weren't such a goody two shoes and had some street knowledge, id think you'd win." I explain she looks at me like i had just told her the earth was flat.
The first flower i coughed up were roses, then they changed to lilies, then orchids and now....... narcissus.
" dont worry blaise, i know you'll get him. I mean you already got him legally but, i know you will get his heart too. Just give it time." Pansy said, patting my chest.
I really wanted to say it. I love you. I love you more than i loved cormac, lavender, even hermione. I love you more than i loved anyone. But when i saw his face, i couldnt bare the thought of not being able to see him happy around me. What if he hates me because of it? What if he cuts contact with me?
The crack in his voice broke my heart. I shut my eyes as tight as i can and tightened my grip on his hand. He tightened it too.
He had bandages up his arms and he looked even paler than usual. Blood bags were hung up beside him being transfused by huge needles.
I flinched. I turned around and saw draco leaning against the wall and looking at me. I exhaled in relief and closed my eyes, leaning against the window sill for support.
" hanahaki." Blaise finished for me in a small voice. I nodded solemnly and dropped down to the floor, my back against the wall. They both sat down on either sides of me.
" yeah, best trio in the world. But anyway we need forces from both the Golden and slytherin trios to defeat the trio of old pasts. Okay? So stop shoving your tongues down each others throats and come help us not die." I wave them over to follow me. They fix themselves on the way, making sure they look presentable.
" okay we leave for dinner at 7:30, that should give us enough time right?" I turn to the bundle of peace that was draco and he nodded.
" yes we do. Unless you want to spend all tomorrow cramming in all the knowledge you could have been taking right now because you didnt do it today." Hermione scolded slightly.
I made it to the infirmary, not even realizing i had walked this way unintentionally. I creaked the door open and carefully closed it shut behind me, making sure i didnt make a noise.
" i dont know. Maybe red. Or maroon. Warm colors looks best on you. Maybe charcoal grey, that would look good on you." I rest my chin on my palm, propping it up on the arm of my chair. Ron smiled and looked forward.
It was almost at the end of the year, just 3 more months left. And i, harry potter, savior of the wizarding world, the chosen one, had fallen madly in love witb Draco Bloody Malfoy. The hanahaki didn't start until that blasted day. The day he rejected me.
Ron was head of the aurors defense team, pansy an unspeakable in his department, and blaise was head healer in the pediatric division in St.Mungos. He was often brought to draco's hospital for consultation. Pansy and hermione started dating a year after graduation and got engaged a year later. Yep, they moved quickly. Blaise and ron got engaged last month and draco was still waiting. Until February, when he can finally propose. February 26th, the day they officially started dating, and the day harry almost died. It will be their 5 year anniversary on that day and draco can finally propose.
" okay take a swig of this."  Hermione handed draco the flask. It was a mix of veritaserum and whiskey to block out the taste. Draco took a swig and set it down, now under the effects of veritaserum.
I woke up to the sun in my face the next morning. Some where in the night, draco had shifted into a laying position, and i was laying on his chest. His arms engulfed me in a tight hug and pulled me close to him. I could feel his breath by the top of my head and the hairs on the back of my neck rose up.
Thats when it started. The coughing. Harry started hacking up petals and blood. I quickly went to Pomfrey's station and grabbed a clean bucket. I held it to Harry's mouth as the petals fell in and rubbed circles in his back to soothe him.
" i love you. Im glad i finally got you." Blaise turned to me, as harry and Pansy argue about whether Hermione cheated at monopoly.
" oh sod off, we're talking about Ron not me." Harry said crossing his arm. Hermione and i chuckle at his toddler like actions. It was like that for the rest of the night, none of us got much sleep. We talked about nothing and everything, and managed to finish 6 pints of ice cream.
Adam had trapped me, the smart git. I was talking to fred and then he approached me. Fred the idiot just tapped my shoulder and said ' talk to your friend' and left to go talk to bill.
" it was wonderful meeting you Mrs.Zabini." We are at the doorstep of the large mansion. She kisses my cheek once more and holds me by my wrists.
" WHAT? You are getting married to that SNAKE? Hes a DEATH EATER RON! This wont work out. He will break your heart and you will come crawling back to me. They ALWAYS do." Cormac paced around the room in anger. Blaise stood up and towered over Cormac. Cormac was 5'7, Blaise was 6'2.
" so the surgery went well. There was some bleeding in your liver but i got it fixed. Im here because some of the information on his sign up sheet was missing."
After the party ended, we went back home. We all ended up staying at Grimmauld in case Adam or the other two came to pester us some more. We stayed up all night, talking, playing board games and drinking. It was the perfect end to a not so perfect day.
Draco closed his eyes. He didnt know what he was saying, and at this moment he wanted nothing more than to know.
We sat in comfortable silence as harry smoothed out his sheets, constantly blushing the entire time.
" what? Oh no! No no. Me and her were never really..... a thing." I say awkwardly. She just nods and sighs
" ok fine. You can have that. Okay what time is it?" I clap my hands and ask. Harry flicks his wrist and the time appears on the wall.
" yeah." I said before covering my face with my coffee. Blaise nodded with a slight smile on his face.
" yes dear." Harry gave him a chaste kiss on the cheek and flicked his wand, the boxes levitating out of dracos arms and following harry to the kitchen.
" language Mister Zabini. Now, we have special rings you must wear, if you two are to..... ummm... consummate.... with anyone else. You will immediately be teleported to eachother. So i suggest you be.... careful." Kingsley said, very obviously uncomfortable. I let out a sigh and leaned back in my chair.
" ron , you are marrying him." Harry said. I rolled my eyes and Hermione smacked him with her spoon. Harry grimaces and grabs the back of his head where Hermione hit him.
" i found out today that i am in a legal contract. I have to marry him." I said plainly. He looked at me like i was insane.
" i found out about the contract, there is a loop hole. If before the two betrothed parties get married, one gets married before them, the contract us void." He said excitedly.
" weasley" we both answer. She nods and writes our names down on two separate cups before walking to the back to make our drinks. After about 5 minutes she comes back with two steaming cups. We take our drinks, thank her and sit in a booth near the corner.
" listen here you little shit. That stunt you pulled yesterday left me THOROUGHLY HUMILIATED. I know what this is about. You just want me and harry together so i confess my crush on him but it will NOT WORK ZABINI."
" oh fuck no. Your not getting away with it that easily pretty boy." Hermione came up to him and sat next to him, arms wrapped around his neck.
" okay, so i gotta meet with Kingsley at 10. Hermione has work, and im hoping if draco and pansy are there you too wont make a mess of yourselves?" I asked pointing at Harry. Pansy and Draco were healers at St. Mungos meanwhile Hermione was an unspeakable and Harry was an Auror with me. He nodded and we walked over to the fire place. We each grabbed a handful of floo powder. I stepped into the fire place first.
" really? You didnt know? After all the clues?! How he would only let YOU borrow his clothes, how he would constantly try to be around you, how he could never sleep properly knowing you weren't safe. Or how he loved to tease you and was constantly trying to make you feel better and how he would only let YOU stay behind in the infirmary? He wouldn't even let me stay the night and yet you got "hes dying because he loves me too much" privileges. For gods sake his flowers were NARCISSUS'!"
" how have you and ronald been doing? Are you two getting on well?" She said as we walked to the patio, where we always had lunch on Saturday afternoons. Some called us boujee, we say classy. I smiled softly at the thought of ron. Wait when had i started doing that?
The small Jack russel terrior ran off with his message a few seconds after being conjured. Ron turned back to the velvet couch, which held a now asleep Blaise Zabini. Ron smiled fondly at the picture before him. He grabbed the glass out of the unconscious boy's hand and set it back on the tray table. He found a blanket nearby and covered blaise with it. He looked at the picture once more.
Right now we were sitting in the library, his nose in a book and my head in his lap. It became a normal friday evening routine for us. We sit in the library in comfortable silence, just taking in each others company.
Me, draco, blaise and ron were sitting in the bleachers, watching ravenclaw and hufflepuff practice. Unfortunately 8th years couldnt play quidditch anymore as it was an unfair advantage. So instead we would often watch the other houses play.
" okay okay, lets go somewhere private. Im sorry everyone! Its just a Misunderstanding. Go back to enjoying the party!" Pansy yelled and pushed Adam forward. We walked upstairs up to Blaises room and locked the door.
Now their manor looked like a home, replenished, renewed, reborn. They were finally moving in after a full year. They both had fulfilling careers. Draco as a healer and the director at the new hospital he opened just last year and harry was the defense against dark arts professor for the 2nd year now. After his first year, the curse of the D.A.D.A teacher only being able to last one year came in, but harry whined so much about losing the position that he forced hermione and blaise to work for weeks trying to find the counter-curse. Eventually they did, and now harry was going back this fall.
" Adam? I knew we couldn't trust him. Slimy bastard, always gave me bad vibes." Pansy stated. Right after she said that blaise appeared in the doorway, wearing my shirt. Pansy and hermione try to hide a smile while Harry is just digging into his breakfast.
Shit. Harry looked at a slightly panicked ron. They glared at eachother for a few moments before harry finally said something.
" no. Im not gonna let you die that easily. Im not gonna let you give up. You defeated the most powerful dark wizard of our time, you defeated a basilisk, you defeated that psychotic motherfucker more times than i can count! You, harry potter, will not die after going through all of that, and certainly not at the hands of a couple of flowers and draco fucking malfoy!" He yelled. Blaise stood up too.
Adam once again wrapped his arms around my waist and rested his head on my shoulder. I smiled fondly and finished up. I dried my hands and turned back to him, leaning on the sink. I cupped his face in my hands and kissed him softly. The kiss started to evolve, becoming more passionate. He pushed me further back, me leaning backwards over the sink now. I gasped slightly as he bit down on my lip, he took this opportunity to let his tongue explore. It was getting more and more heated. Adam propped me on the kitchen counter and i ran my fingers through his hair.
" awww did i hurt malfoys feelings?" Harry pouted then broke into laughter. He gave dracos arm a little push and knocked on the door. Draco shook his head but he had a wide grin on his face.
" ill tell him you're sleeping. And plus, i cant let you go when you're in.......... that situation." Harry gestured towards dracos pants. Draco shifted and rolled his eyes.
" what's up bitch?" Pansy pat draco's shoulder as she walked in and pushed the bottle into his chest. Draco rolled his eyes and examined the bottle.
" disappointing. I know. But the parseltongue part must have done a number on him for him to have to stay." He said unamused.
" no. No im not. Im really in love with him." I say, looking over Harry's shoulder and over to blaise.
" yeah. I think adam stayed in my apartment. I accio'd my suit and some supplies tho so i should be fine until i get home." Blaise took a sip of his tea and set it back down.
He looked at me like he was thinking. He turned around and faced the window, grabbing the edge of the window sill.
I woke up to a patronus from Ron. His little terrier danced around my room before giving me the message.
" WHAT?" Draco yelled loudly, staring at me. Ron made an 'O' face and backed away from me. Blaise had a pained expression and grabbed hold of rons shoulder, and by rons reaction, it was painful.
" blaise. H-Harry he- hes in the t-third stage." He sniffled. He sobbed into my shoulder, his taller frame crouching to meet mine.
I waited in Blaises office. I sat on his office chair and looked over his desk. Blaise was an auror in my department so I recognized a lot of the cases laid out all over the large oak table. From downstairs i could hear yelling and i couldn't help but feel sorry. I am the reason why they are fighting.
" why? This is all your fault anyway!" He yelled loudly. His face was filled with malice while he stared me down.
" you could have looked at the clock." Pansy downed the last of her tea and set the cup in the sink.
Harry finally took his hands away from his face. He looked at the rings and smiled. He placed his hands on the arm that was currently coiled around his waist.
" yeah. Hey when we go to their wedding we'll be the Weasley-Zabinis." I chuckle, grabbing a magazine to flip through.
Suddenly the game starts and you hear loud cheers from all around the arena. Ron is very enthusiastic about this, as am i but he just seems so into it. It rather cute actually...
I feel flowers coming up so i unwrap myself from the scarf and run out. I had just made it to the gryffindor changing room and threw up the flowers in a sink. Ron must have noticed because seconds later he burst into the room.
" we have a potion, it should stop the burning in your throat and it will relieve some pain after you throw up the petals. We also have a spell that will allow the petals to float out and stops them from coming back for a few hours."
" harry." I whispered quietly so i dont startle him. He slowly opened his eyes and looked at me. Green eyes met grey ones and i felt my heart stop.
" nothing. You go on like u used to. If anything develops, so let it be." Hermione stated, being the voice of reason. I sat down on the ottoman opposite of the couch. I have been having this feeling, like butterflies in my stomach every time i think of blaise, for a while now. Maybe i....
" because blaise was sleeping in my room." I take a sip from my coffee. Hermione slams her hand on the table and stares at me.
I went to left, but he grabbed onto my wrist, spinning me back towards him. He connected our lips again and i closed my eyes. This one was sweeter, and longer. We pulled back and i stared into his eyes.
" hmm, those robes are a little short on you. No problem." Blaise said before taking out his wand and flicking his wrist. The robes extended and tailored themselves to fit me perfectly. I noticed the suit had done the same and  it was a lot more comfortable than before.
He brought his hand up and caressed my face. I closed my eyes as he traced the areas under my eyes. I noticed the bandages on his arms and my heart ached.
" that is just wonderful. I will see to it. Do not worry about a thing. Although i do ask you not to dress so dark, it really doesn't bring out your eyes. And I will send you clothes to wear so dont worry." She finished by hitting the table lightly. Blaise turned to me and smiled.
" what? Oh yeah. We get company quite a lot so we thought, why not more seating?" He smiled softly. I could have melted on the floor right there.
" kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!" The arena chants like they did for all the rest. Ron looks over to me, his face matching his hair.
" oh YOUR talking about being selfish? What? Its selfish for me to die? Its selfish for me to not want to forget the love of my life?"
I land in his living room covered in ash. He is sitting on his settee with a book when he looks up at me, unamused. He looks down at his book and flips a page.
I shook off the slight chill i had and went to get dressed . When i was in the middle of doing so, someone barged into my room. And of course, it was none other than Harry Potter, and Closely behind him followed Hermione.
" i thought you guys were gonna be platonical?" Hermione stood up and wrapped herself in the slytherin green blanket Pansy had given her.
I start to walk in that direction to get him out of it, but i feel a hand grab my wrist. I whip back around to see Cormac holding my arm.
Draco looked over at Harry's side of the office. It had potions and books all around it, a podium with a spell book left open, quills and bottles of extra ink scattered the bookshelf closest to the desk. Extra rolls of parchment, letters from students, harrys personal owl Apollo in his gold wire cage. Dracos own owl Icarus was also in his cage, carefully sleeping under his wing. The cage was rather large, set next to the fireplace so that they can be warm.
I know if i asked you, you would refuse or ask why. So i thought, why don't i just ask Ronald? Im sorry if this discomforts you, but i must say, Ronald is a very nice boy from the letters we've sent each other. I definitely like him better than Adam. Any whoo, ill see you at dinner in the Zabini Manor at 8 dear. Have a good afternoon.
" pretend? Theres nothing to pretend, i already do." It slips out before i could even stop it. Harry's face falls into one of shock.
I started choking on the flowers again, and still nothing came up. I could barely breathe and the few times i managed to get a wiff of air wasn't enough.
" of course." He said with a sweet smile. I hugged him back again and he didn't retaliate. He didnt say he was tired, or that he didn't want to listen, he just hugged me and when i drifted off to sleep, he carried me to his bed. Maybe there really is hope for us.
" im sorry mate. Im the one who gave you the dare, im the one who pushed you into this. Im so sorry, i-"
The announcer yells. I was too busy watching the game to pay attention to the kiss cam. It wasn't until ron nudged me to look up when i saw it. It was a tall dark skinned boy, and an even taller pale freckled redhead on the screen. It was us.
" tsk tsk tsk. You dumbasses. Anyway, we might need some help. Lavender, cormac and Adam are here . "
I scoffed and proceeded to put the blade to my other arm. I winced as the cut i had already made accidentally brushed against my shirt. I ignored it and proceeded to cut down my other forearm. Like the other one, i felt nothing. My skin felt numb, just like my emotions.
As healers and doctors ran around trying to get the bleeding to stop, we watched in the waiting room. Finally Pansy announced that he has been taken to surgery, and that he is going to make it. I jump up and hug her tightly.
Harry potter, the boy who famously cheated death twice, and two more times at the hands of the person he loved most. Who saved the wizarding world and managed to contract hanahaki in his 8th year. The boy who lived under the stairs for 11 years, the boy who lost most everyone he loved in his life, the boy...... who lived, was finally happy.
" no worries. Like you said, today was just a platonic fiancé date.... right?" I cut him off, rather sad. He visibly gulps and smiles.
" oh nothing. Just my lovely wife and i bring you two some adult juice. I wanted to get you fire whiskey because i know you have a cellar full of expensive wine but Hermione said we should stay classy."
Eventually i closed my eyes and put my head down. I grabbed Harry's hand tight, never letting go. He didnt even look at me. He adverted his eyes down to his lap and stared at it.
" no harm in doing both." Ron chuckled and blaise dropped the book in his lap before settling on the floor, leaning against rons couch.
" if you haven't noticed, he already is. Now, put on a shirt before dear Draco here dies of a heart attack." I wave my hand to him. Harry looked back at me like he was going to say something but when i stared back at him, he quickly shut up.
In the end we chose a maroon 3 piece suit, The vest inside a little darker than the outside, with a white dress shirt for ron. For me i chose a dark navy 3 piece suit with thin vertical white stripes going down the vest. Our family crests stitched onto the left side of our chests. Harry chose a simple black suit, matching dracos iconic all black 3 piece tailored suit.
" its the crest of the Weasley Viking clan. A large 'W' with gold vines and thorns wrapped around it. A sword and axe in the background creating an 'X'" Blaise nods and with the flick of a wrist, my family crest is imprinted in the black satin fabric.
" thats true. But still. Marrying you doesnt seem as bad anymore tho, since marrying someone i really care about. Now those two, they are just idiots." He points at draco who was discussing fabrics with a store clerk and harry who was looking at him dreamily. I stifle a laugh.
The words blurted out if my mouth like it was trapped and trying to escape. Draco and Pansy's jaws were on the floor. Then all of a sudden pansy stood up and started jumping. Draco was trying to hide a smile.
" SHUT UP! We are going to get married and you will forget all about your stupid little family and we will-"
I knew i had grown fond of the boy but i didnt think i was in love. And I thought i was ready to start phase 2 of my plan; only it ended up with me coughing up my lungs filled with flowers. So i asked him on a date, and he refused. That sent me into a coughing fit and i ran out the room. From my mouth i pulled out a single petal, covered in saliva and blood.
" i feel bad for leaving Draco with Harry." I shuffle a little and adjust my scarf as we walk up to the house.
I went back to the great hall and sat back down. When draco asked what happened i just shrugged. Hopefully ron will keep his promise.
" chamomile tea please." Blaise asked. He turned to me and motioned me to order. I shook my head and turned towards the barista.
" ron? You okay?" I go over to him. Then thats when i see it. Blood trickled down his hands and abdomen. I yelled loudly for hermione and harry. I hear footsteps climb down the stairs before they join me in the living room.
" you want me, a person who almost just died. To marry you." He said through his hands, his voice a little muffled.
"Pffft. Of who? Ron? Just because he has a caring fiance and he is talking to MY boyfriend about stuff I apparently cant know about? No, of course not." Harry passive aggressively walked away to start wiping the table.
" but you dont have to. If we get married before you two then the contract is broken. We can be together, you can be with the person you love-"
Harry laughed out of the room. He settled on the big red couch in front of the ever lasting fire. Watching it burn as he drifted off to sleep with only one thing on his mind.
" horned serpent huh?" Hermione asked after pomfrey left and we were all sitting down by harrys bed. Blaise and i were holding hands, one in his and the other in harrys.
" nah, it isnt a big deal. it was bound to happen. She called you stuck up. I had to protect my fiancé." I smiled. Blaise let out a small chuckle and smiled as well. I dont know why but this make my stomach flutter, making him smile like that. We sat like that for a little more until i looked over at the clock. It was nearly 11 pm. I decided it was time to go home so i stood up from the couch. Before i could walk away, someone grabbed my wrist and held me back.
" hey ron." I turn back to the Voice. Cormac was standing there with a clipboard of his own, awkwardly leaning on the wall.
" you just want to go bc there is a chance Draco and pansy will be there." I respond, standing up and walking out the door. They followed me down the stairs and into the living room.
" oh hey ron. Quick question, why was blaise sleeping in your bed today?" Hermione asked. Harry almost choked on his toast and pansy spit a bit of her tea out.
" im sorry." Was all i could whisper. We sat in silence for what felt like forever until Harry eventually drifted off to sleep. I watched his chest rise and fall as he took steady breaths . I reached up and placed a kiss on his forehead.
When i heard the news my blood ran cold. I knew harry was having a tough time but i never thought he would.....
" you know, he's just the cutest sleeper-" he punched me. The crowd turned their attention to us. I staggered back and my champagne glass landed on the floor. The loud shatter attracted Blaise, Harry and Draco who were a few feet away. I saw harry and Blaise run over to me as Draco runs off.
A thing with rules. The number one rule was no kissing on the mouth. Everywhere else was fair game, if a little too intimate, but never on the lips. The other rules were pretty standard as far as incredibly fucked up barely-even-friends-with-benefits goes; no marks, no feelings, nobody can know. If Harry broke a few of those over the years, Draco never has to know.
He’s about to move, inching closer when there’s a gentle tap on his leg. They both look down to see Rose grinning up at them.
He’d thought as much. Pulling his legs up to his chest, he wraps his arms around himself and rests his chin in the dip between his knees. He’s tired, more than anything. “Draco…”
“Am I not allowed to make friends now?” The other man asks, shattering the peace. He’s leaning against the side of the tent, the fabric not giving at all against his weight. Magic, probably.
“Hello little dove,” Draco coos at her, lifting her up when she raises her arms demandingly. She’s getting a little too big to be held like that, but nobody ever denies her. Least of all Draco, who is surprisingly enamoured with her. She smiles at him and wraps her arms around his neck to secure herself. They both look perfectly content.
He hadn’t noticed. She’s right, he finds upon looking around. Most of the guests are seated, a few still milling around finding their places amongst the beautifully decorated tables. He flushes a little, feeling very caught out. They’d been in their own little bubble, as he often seems to be with Draco.
“I’m already regretting this,” he lies easily, turning the box over in his hands. Draco snatches it, grinning.
It had been awkward at first, wary looks and painful small talk. As the alcohol had flowed, so had the conversation. The Slytherins slowly started to look less like they were about to flee and the others begrudgingly welcomed them into their circles, somehow finding something to talk about that wasn’t misplaced blame and trauma. There had been a few fights throughout the night, notably, Miss peacekeeper Granger herself having a heated argument with Pansy Parkinson in the kitchen that to this day neither of them will tell Harry the origin of. Things had settled, once they’d been torn apart, and the atmosphere became a lot lighter.
She did. Last Christmas. Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever get over the look on Draco’s face when he opened it, alone in the bedroom on Christmas night, after they’d both managed to get away from their families. He’d held the soft green fabric to his chest, smiling so softly. There’d been a sniffle, one tear and a whispered ‘never speak of this, Potter’. It had only cemented his adoration.
“Quicker than usual,” Draco comments as soon as the still-hard prick is out of his mouth. “I think you’re getting old.”
He drops Draco’s hand and wraps an arm around him, hand slipping dangerously low on his back. He doesn’t stray further, not yet, though his fingers ache to reach under the material. Draco, impatient as ever, whines.
That’s true, he’d likely have hexed his balls off by now. Unable to stop himself, he presses a lingering kiss to the sore skin he’d bruised moments ago before letting go of Draco to work on undoing his trousers; unable to wait any longer. Thankfully, Draco takes the hint and does the same.
Harry rolls his eyes, using his free hand to remove his glasses and throw them onto the dresser. He can see perfectly fine without them these days, only wears them because he feels naked without them.
The closet is small, with barely enough room for the two of them and the few cleaning supplies stacked against the wall. He can hear the party outside, voices moving past the door far closer than he’d like.
Harry shakes his head, calming the laugh that is starting to draw curious eyes to their corner of the tent. “We match,” he says with a grin, pointing at Draco’s green tie. It’s the exact colour of Harry’s robes.
“I mean it more every time,” he grins, squinting one eye open to look up at the man. Draco is looking down at him fondly, far fonder than he normally allows himself to be caught looking.
“Ginny and Luna are a couple I don’t think anyone saw coming and yet every time I’m in their presence it’s hard to imagine a time when they weren’t attached at the hip,” he says, looking at them fondly. “You’re both younger than me and yet you inspire me so much. In love and in everything else. Watching you grow together over the years has been a beautiful thing to see.” Pausing to give himself a moment, he looks out at the many faces looking back at him.
The redhead woman’s gaze switches firmly to Harry, some sort of accusation in her eyes. Is he too obvious? Is it evident to everyone around them that he’d take down cities just to have Draco breathe in his direction? He doesn’t know what to do, what to say. Foolishly, he’d convinced himself that the kiss had been a turning point, a sign that his feelings aren’t entirely unrequited and their relationship could move out of the standstill it’s been at. Clearly, he needs to re-evaluate.
He maps out the coming conversation in his head a thousand times. Nothing feels right. He can’t word it quite right, in every single scenario he sees himself tripping over the words and falling deeper and deeper into hopelessness.
“Don’t be a prick after you’ve just swallowed my cum in a broom closet, arsehole,” he says with a laugh, really not wanting any part in jokes about other men right now. Draco just grins in reply, perfect teeth on full show. Harry hates him.
“Yes Rosie, at the special table. You’re between me and uncle Harry,” She smiles, taking her child’s small hand in hers. “Come on, let uncle Draco find his seat,” with that, she gives them both another look and walks away, pulling Rose along with her.
“Fuck,” he breathes with a soft chuckle. His hands are firmly planted on Draco’s waist again, thumbs moving back and forth in an almost soothing way; grounding himself. He bumps his nose against the other man’s lightly. “I much prefer this to fighting.”
“No,” he stops him, needing to get this out in the open. “Let me just—let me say this. I’ve been trying to find the courage to ask you this whole trip and I just kept putting it off because I wanted it to be perfect. Wanted it to be good enough for you. But this—here—
“The day Ginny came to me and told me she wanted to propose, it took all of me not to say ‘Hey, idiot, your girlfriend is about to propose to
“Mine now,” he laughs, the sound dying abruptly when he opens the box. There, nestled in a silk-lined cushion, is the ring. It takes Harry’s breath away every time he looks at it. A thick platinum band with an emerald sat flush in the middle of it, small diamonds scattered around the stone. The first time he saw it, he knew it belonged on Draco’s finger.
He drops Draco’s hand to open the door and push it open. Something in the air is different when they walk in together, like the house knows that everything is changing whether they like it or not.
With a tired sigh, he turns over and closes his eyes. They’ve been here so many times but it doesn’t feel any easier tonight, in fact, it feels much much worse.
“Of course not,” he rolls his eyes. “Anyway, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted—love, it’s bloody weird and messy and sometimes I wonder how it’s worth the hassle but then I see the two of you and it all makes sense. You wake up and choose to love each other no matter how hard it gets and I could only hope to have half the relationship you share one day.” It’s taking all of his willpower not to seek out Draco’s stormy eyes right now. He needs to stay on track, lest he starts waxing poetic about bloody ferrets.
“Hermione loved you back,” he says as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. Their situations are so vastly different, if Ron can’t understand that then he thinks all hope might be lost.
Harry huffs out a laugh, jostling them a little. He presses another kiss to the soft lips, this time with no ulterior motives. He pulls away and opens his eyes; surprised to find Draco watching him. There’s a warmth in the blue-grey eyes that’s not entirely rare but still manages to shock him every time, the force of it so overwhelming. “We can talk this all out in the morning, okay?” He murmurs before kissing the tip of his nose in what would usually be an extremely dangerous move, laughing in relief when he scrunches it in response—the warmth not dissipating. “Let’s go to bed.”
Blaise Zabini, of all people, is not who he expected to have rescued him from his own mind. They’re friendly, for the most part. There has always been an underlying tension though, something that he’s always assumed was to do with Draco.
He’s chewing on his lip, looking more thoughtful than Harry thinks he’s ever seen him. “We can’t go home yet,” he says, mulling something over in his head. “It’s too early, everyone will notice.”
“My father almost died,” he says, voice thick. “I got an owl from Azkaban, and my mother she—she broke. Like, really broke. She threw me out of the manor, changed the wards, told me I didn’t do enough to stop him from being put in there. She didn’t mean it, she was just so broken she couldn’t think straight, but I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t go to Pansy or Blaise—they’re great and they love me but they don’t
supposed to mean? It’s already too late. He picks his head up and instead thunks it back against the tree, wincing slightly. There’s nothing he can do here. It was painful enough—loving Draco at a distance, laying together every night but still with lines they would never cross. He doesn’t know if he can do it now that he knows what it feels like to kiss him. He can lock away the war and the loss and the regrets but he doesn’t think the taste of Draco’s lips will go quietly.
Harry laughs and turns his head to press a kiss into Draco’s palm before pulling the hand away but not letting go of it, keeping it held tightly in his. “I thought we were here to have sex, not insult my intelligence.”
Harry himself looks admittedly quite handsome in his dark green robes, lined with intricate gold details. His hair is as unruly as ever, he’s far past the point of trying to tame it. He’s grown to love his hair over the years, if only because Draco loves it (though he pretends not to). It’s one of the things he loves about Draco. He likes all the things Harry sometimes struggles to like about himself. His hair, the colour of his skin, the scar that branches across his forehead. He’ll never verbally say he likes them, always skirting around giving Harry genuine compliments, but Harry knows.
Falling in love with Draco Malfoy wasn’t something he chose to do. Continuing to love him, through the pain of perceived unrequited feelings, through screaming arguments and Prophet headlines and silent treatments, is a choice he would make a thousand times. In every lifetime, over and over again, he would choose to love Draco. Without hesitation.
Harry brings their lips together for a moment. It’s a quick kiss, more for the sake of being able to than one with any real aim. “Come for me, angel,” he whispers into the kiss.
Hermione walks in first, holding Rose’s tiny little hand in hers. She’s three now—almost four as she likes to remind everyone any chance she can get—and she’s the sweetest child. Dressed in the most adorable poofy white dress, small blue butterflies scattered across it and pinned into her curls, she has everyone cooing over her the moment they spot her. Hermione herself looks radiant, deep blue dress with off the shoulder sleeves complimenting her dark skin tone beautifully. They walk down the aisle together and Harry smiles as Rose runs from her mother’s side and into his arms. He lifts her up and balances her weight on his hip as everyone laughs at her antics, utterly charmed by her as they should be.
It’s been over a week since he’s seen Draco. It’s unusual for them to spend so much time apart, their dependency on each other something they do not talk about but is present nonetheless. The work trip the other man had been called on was unexpected and almost resulted in Draco being unable to attend the wedding, which was devastating to all of them. Draco and Ginny’s friendship is one Harry will never fully understand but is ultimately grateful for. She’d marched straight to the Minister herself and refused to leave his office until he agreed to shorten the trip. Knowing Kingsley, Harry would have paid to see that. Luckily, it worked.
