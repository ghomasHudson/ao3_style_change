Draco
The rest of the Wizarding World was ready to move on from the war, even Harry, who’d taken up with a reformed Draco Malfoy of all people. Luna supposed people could change, but she wasn’t willing to sit idly by and wait for it.
“So, why did I run into
Draco closed his eyes and thumped his head back against the headboard. Of course. He'd finally had Potter in his bed, after years of fantasies and pining, and he couldn't remember any of it.
"You've got 20 stitches, along your stomach." Draco closes his eyes, his own voice quieter than the steady beeping of the machine next to Harry.
"C'mon! It's coming!" Harry called behind him as he ran up the steps of the Ministry building. The crowd was screaming in terror as it swarmed in its escape out of the building, but he pushed through the mob to make his way up to the top.
*laugh*
But the smash of a nose
Harry looked a little sheepish. “Sierra.”
. I wonder if your eyes have faded or your skin is wrinkled with age, or if you, too, are immune to the debris of time, waiting for me.
And began the war phase
Malfoy nodded. "I understand, Potter. It does that to me, too. C'mon," he grabbed Harry by the arm and started to pull him out of the room, Harry's legs willingly following.
Until I find out, I'm going to believe in Draco, and Ron, and Hermione. I'm going to believe in what I can control. And I'm going to ask Luna more about what she believes because I think she might be onto something.
You don't actually want me, you want to
So, Lovegood, you did me a favor, really, by killing the others. Thank you—as a reward, I won’t kill you before you kill me; I’m sure I was on your list.
be the central source on the topic. They spun their theories and tales. They’d never accuse her—sweet, innocent Luna—of taking justice into her own hands.
"Alright," he said, trying not to stare at Malfoy's lips and consider what it might be like to kiss him.
"Well--is there some way I can help? Maybe--"
Malfoy was right in front of Harry's face now. There were flecks of blue in the grey eyes. "Talk about distracting! I can't walk down the same corridor as you without walking into you with how much I'm staring!"
He decided to give them a moment before approaching Malfoy, but if he didn't get this over with now, he'd never have the courage.
Luna smiled. “
He filled his lungs with air, less for function and more to remember that he could lighten his body, even if for a moment. He wondered if he could take a breath too deep for gravity's hold; would he barely hover above the ground, blades of grass tickling his skin? Or would he float up up up up until he met the rain at the source?
Harry sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "I'm not nearly patient or knowledgable to explain the concept of chemistry to you, Draco, that's like asking what magic is."
Draco sputtered. "What is wrong with you?"
"But I--"
“And you haven’t found anything fulfilling since then.”
"It's okay, Harry, that's why we're here. Our first dance will be beautiful."
Based on "Remembering Sunday" by All Time Low
Here, in my corner, I wait for you, unable to do anything else. I wonder if you have red-haired children to make angels in the snow and if your wife plucks budding flowers from the ground. I wonder if you make lemonade for the hot sun and watch the first casualty of autumn drift from its delicate branch.
Draco'd closed the door behind him when he came in, and he was still standing. Harry was already kneeling on the floor in front of the suitcase.
At first, Draco'd worried that he'd only find these pockets of contentment under the cover of night with Harry, but late nights had turned into lazy mornings, and discreet one-offs behind the Leaky became lunch at the new Thai place in Diagon.
Draco bit his lip. "We were in an accident. You were driving us--we're using a Mug--a car because the suspect is--"
Then Harry had a thought that made him groan in frustration. “Gods, Kingsley’s going to make us patrol longer isn’t he?”
“Harry, I can’t just leave you here! She’s a murderer!”
“That’s not true.” My voice is low and miraculously steady, belying my nerves. “We love each other, Father, and just because you and Mother chose to spend your lives in a sham of a marriage doesn’t mean I have to.” The words spill from my lips like a secret I’d kept from myself, but the truth tastes sweet and satisfying on my tongue.
Draco watched as Potter turned away, and he really ought to give his hand a stern talking to for reaching out to grab Potter’s arm. “Wait.”
"She—what?"
"I wish you'd let me protect you and your mother. I wish you'd make the right choice, for once!"
The question shook Draco from his thoughts as he faced curious green eyes.
"What's wrong? Are you okay?" It was difficult to stifle the amusement and affection that fluttered in Draco's chest at Harry's immediate concern. "Did he hurt you?"
He opens his eyes. The grave of Albus Dumbledore still manages to be grand and imposing against the gray clouds and flashing lightning.
Draco nodded and let himself be pulled further into Harry’s warm embrace, the solid feel of his broad chest a comforting anchor as he drifted off to sleep once more.
"Potter, wait up!"
"I know, Draco," he says. "I'm doing this because I want to."
Sure, it wasn’t exactly the countryside; Harry remembered long nights in the Forest of Dean, looking at the stars and losing himself in their infinite patterns. When one would occasionally shoot across the sky, he made a wish every time in the hopes that one of them might carry it to whoever was designing his fate. He would count them to keep the nightmares at bay for long enough to sleep until he was inevitably woken by his traitorous subconscious; luckily, the stars would often still be there, a twinkling, comforting reminder that the world was bigger than it seemed.
"Potter—"
Harry bit his lip. "I don't think I could ever just be friends with you," he said quietly.
She cast a
They call it Tarasque.
“You don’t think the Ministry is aware? We’re going all we can to track down the wanted Death Eaters.”
"Alright, I suppose I won't move out
Malfoy pursed his lips. "I think a couple of dates in Hogsmeade, sitting with each other's friends at meals, and some hand-holding should be plenty. No need to snog or anything--such a stark difference in our interactions will do the trick. Then we just gradually spend less time together and they'll assume we're broken up and by then they'll be used to not harrassing us."
Harry'd been sent outside to collect that day's mail haul when he saw one with his own name on it. After casting the protective spells, he'd opened it to see an unfinished and then scratched-out letter.
Your hands on my hips, the stars winking in approval above our heads, swaying to the rhythm of our beating hearts.
The pieces landed in the water, floating away as useless kindling. He looked at Draco's proud smile.
I let my emotions run wild because of you. I lost my inhibitions and my sanity because of you. I lied to my friends and family because of you.
The smile Draco loved so much melted into a frown, and he hated the sight. "Alright," Harry said with a resigned sigh. He carefully removed the bundle from underneath his shirt, revealing an adorable black and white cat with a blue collar.
I notice how your jaw clenches when you're angry, the way your face lights up at the first snowfall of winter, how you mumble sarcastic remarks under your breath when Granger is lecturing you and Weasley, the way you hunch over like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders; you probably do.
Draco nodded quickly. "I'd like that, please, thank you."
"I see love. I see kindness, and strength. I see humor and bravery. Yes, I see your adorably messy hair and gorgeous eyes. But when you wake up and it's static-y and sticking up everywhere, that's yours. The fire in your eyes when you duel, or the twinkle in them when you're laughing, or the way they light up when you're excited. That's yours, Harry. That's what I and everyone else who loves you sees. And that's all that matters."
Cori smiled. "This is a drag bar. We're drag queens."
You kept me from dying; now I need to learn how to live without you.
"Yes you do," Draco said fiercely.
“Of course. I have to get back, but I’ll let Geoffrey know you’re here.” She walked away, but not before darting her eyes at Potter, then back to Draco to shoot him a subtle, knowing wink.
"How," Potter swallows. "How does it still exist?"
Ron prattled on about quidditch, and Harry tried to listen, he really did. But his thoughts drifted inevitably back to Malfoy. He kicked himself again for not choosing a better surveillance point in class; maybe if he'd been watching he'd have seen why Malfoy'd fled class at the end.
“You got tired of your dream job. After two years?”
“You’re enough for me, Draco. You’re everything.”
It's peaceful—or it was until he heard a loud and concerning noise coming from near the greenhouses and decided to investigate and saw Potter sitting astride a bloody dragon.
To the untrained, unknowing ear, Parseltongue sounded like hissing.
I was thinking of the best way to send you a message; to even the score between us, in a way. To let you know that as you continue your little justice mission, you’re to leave me out of it. And that I’ll do you the same courtesy.
I'd ask you to close your eyes, but I imagine you need to keep them open to read this letter. Also, you won't read this, because Time-Turners are now banned and I'm not willing to test the extent of Harry's influence with the Wizengamot for a second time.
Draco tightened his grip around Harry's midsection as they sped down the empty street in Muggle London. Funny how Draco's and his Father's happiness had an inverse correlation.
Draco woke every night, gasping for breath. He fought to forget the grip of Nagini around his throat, the Fiendfyre blistering his skin, the relentless undulation of his body under Aunt Bella’s cruel Crucio.
He resolutely ignored the flutter in his chest as he turned around to face his doom.
Harry approached him slowly, like a skittish wild animal. His arms trapped Draco in a tight embrace, and Draco let himself be captured.
Potter, please, keep your distance from me. You make me feel radioactive, and I need as little chaos in my life as possible, and you can only lead to trouble.
I hate the way you dance
"Or avocado, or eggs."
The Head Auror regarded them with the patience of a man who’d had these conversations too many times before. “I know the case is tough, gentlemen, but I need my two best Aurors on this case. This so-called ‘Little Red’ is dangerous, and they’re embarrassing the department and the Ministry, not to mention murdering people, wanted criminals though they may be.”
Weasley started toward Draco, his fists clenched, but Potter grabbed his arm.
Luna wondered briefly how Harry would feel about this sort of place sharing his name; unmarked graves were lined in neat rows, the final resting places for the bodies of people who were too lonely or indigent when they were alive to have the dignity of a headstone.
A little nervousness crossed Draco's face. "Well, Harry I am sorry to bother you, perhaps I could Owl you, or--"
"Why did she call
. I wish I could memorize the look on your face when you see the headline: "Congratulations to Harry and Draco Potter on their nuptials!" I wish I could be a ghost in the room when you realize that your name will die with you like a disease.
he whispered into Malfoy's mouth as he rutted against him. They spilled in their trousers not long after, clinging to one another as they gasped their release.
Draco couldn't cry, so he let the sky do it for him. He shivered, soaking it up like the grass crushed under the shirt clinging to him like a second skin. He closed his eyes, imagining that the drops sliding down his face were the tears he couldn't muster, the catharsis he hadn't earned.
Harry grinned and chuckled, and Ron pulled his fingers out of his ears with a small glare at Harry’s mirth.
“Yeah?”
Draco sighed, closing his eyes for a moment. Then he looked at Harry, his expression determined. "Come home with me."
“But you don’t actually have to stay and watch me all day, right?”
Malfoy's eyes lit up when Harry took his hand. Harry might not like whispers, but maybe he could trust them when they came from his heart.
"H-Harry?" his throat was sore, scratchy.
“Tom, good to see you.”
Luna cleared her throat and pitched it low. “Fenrir? It’s Lucius,” she said with as much of a posh drawl as she could manage.

They tell me I’m the Chosen One
I want to tell you how much you reminded me of Him in the mere seconds before you cast that spell. I want to tell you that, up until then, I'd been a failure. I failed at being a Death Eater, at my mission—at hating you.
Incarcerous
For the first time in his life, Harry was too excited to sleep.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “And, what, you want me to be your personal New York tour guide? The city’s a grid system. The streets are numbered. Get a map and use it, or better yet, use your mobile. And the MACUSA headquarters are on the corner of Bowery and Canal Street if you need help.”
"Really?"
"But really, Harry, you'll be great. You just need a bit of help. Now, take my hand again, yes good, and the other on my shoulder, right, there you are. And my hand goes on your waist. Now we move. Just follow my lead."
“I—what?”
Tonight was about Draco taking and Harry giving what they both wanted. Tonight was about sweet surrender, about conquer and being conquered willingly and wholly.
Potter smirked, an indecipherable edge to it. “I think I can handle it.”
The song ended, and the crowd rose to its feet in applause. Tarasque smiled and bowed a little before handing the microphone to his other friend, Miss Schegoss, the drag queen host of the evening.
Potter’s face fell. “Oh, did you want me to go?”
The flatware used to gleam in the light of the chandelier, but dust isn't shiny, and time doesn't polish.
Harry shook his head. "I don't know what I did to deserve you."
On and on of his major triumph
He needed some air. He turned to Astoria to let her know of his whereabouts, only to find her a few feet away and mingling with her coworkers in the Department of Mysteries. He took the moment to slip into the crowd, confident that he was unseen as he made his way onto the hopefully empty balcony.
“So, can I go home?”
He hoped his face didn't look as green as he felt, but if Draco's concerned expression was any indication, he was unsuccessful.
Suddenly, Malfoy stepped back and retrieved a quill from his pocket. He winked as he was pulled away by the Portkey, disappearing as quickly as he'd come.
Harry thought of his motel room. He thought of his car and his duffel bag with the calendar and the journal and the pen.
Again we meet, as you stand on this precipice to look at the view, above the jagged rocks and waves below.
“H-hello?” a low, gruff voice called from a four-poster bed. Curtains were drawn around it, concealing the speaker’s face.
Those lips curved into a small smile. "Okay then, Potter, since today is Friday, shall we meet at the entrance and walk together to Hogsmeade for our first date?"
Harry's jaw tightened, the hand holding his outstretched wand trembling slightly. "You don't have to do this."
When she stood, her hands were smudged with black soot, her dress dirtied from where she'd been kneeling. Her back ached, whether from the strain of bending over or sleeping on the couch for nights on end, her wand underneath her pillow. Just in case.
And then Draco dug his nails into Potter’s head, eliciting the most sensual groan Draco had ever heard in his life.
He tensed at the sound of the door opening behind him, but he didn't turn around, hoping that the person would see him and leave him to his misery.
“Did something else happen?” Harry felt a sense of dread wash over him.
He sat and read the letter, his eyes growing wider with every word. He finally finished, slumping in his chair.
Harry shook his head. "I thought I was just watching our memories. I do that when I miss you."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco's eyes went wide. "What?" He breathed.
He let his eyes wander over to the Gryffindor table, eyebrows raising when he saw Potter’s forced smile as he politely engaged with interrupting fans. Granger and Weasley were regarding him sympathetically, as Potter shrugged at his friends in silent apology.
Harry bit his lip. "Astoria found you unconscious on your couch. She brought you here and then she, well...She called me."
He tried not to think about the feel of Potter's calloused hand laced with his, the way they'd glide together around the living room of his flat, their bodies moving in tandem. He pushed away memories of sneaking out in the morning, long and lingering kisses before he slipped out the door before he could ask to stay. Stolen stares in the halls of Ministry, followed by clandestine meetings in whosever office was closest.
“You’ll lose. You’ve never been a very good liar.”
"I took her to the animal healer, and they said she was fine. She’s a British shorthair by the way. But they also said if someone didn’t take her she’d go to the pound and she’s so small and vulnerable and she nee-“
I want to slip out the door without you noticing. I want you to wake up, disoriented and confused with sleep in your eyes. I want you to call for me and be met with silence. I want you to search every room of the house and shout my name, trying to ignore the growing sense of dread that pools in your stomach before you realize that I chose not to let myself die in order to continue living with you.
She felt another remnant of her naivety crumble into dust within her heart, something pure now tainted. Good; no longer would her idealism be her blindspot.
With shaking hands, he knelt down and gathered the pile and stuffed the strips into his pocket. He rose to his feet and
Father grins manically. “Goodbye, son.” He raises his wand and
"I--is that..."
Draco scoffed. "I told you, Potter, I don't need your pity! Don't sully your good name on my account."
Potter’s face shifted, and Draco’s breath nearly caught at the familiar expression on adult features. His eyes were smoldering like slow-burning embers, the promise of erupting into flames if provoked just so. His jaw was set, this time in determination.
You like the wind in your hair, but I don't like your attention off of me.
I don't have much time. But I'm not sure if I'll have a chance to do this when most people do.
"I take everything you do as a personal insult."
Prompt: stray animal, smile
Lyssa smiled. “Ah, you’re joining Mr. Malfoy. If you gentlemen would please follow me. Draco, we have your usual table ready for you.”
?" Draco stopped walking, turning to Harry in shock.
"No problem. You're not bad company, Malfoy," and Potter gave him another one of his easy smiles, like Draco was someone he just...
"Captirevero"
One day, when your atrocious black hair has turned gray, and your green eyes are more for aesthetic than function, you'll take your last breath.
Potter didn’t look at Draco when he said the very last thing Draco expected when agreeing, “Fine.”
Draco'd felt terrified coming out to Pansy, but she'd just taken him in her arms and told him she loved him no matter what. And when she found out about his nonbinary drag persona, she'd been ecstatic.
"A lot can change in six months. You taught me that."
Draco sipped his own wine and flagged down the server. Suddenly, his appetite for food seemed to have returned.
5. He hates cardamom, and anything flavored with it. The man’s palate is so unrefined as to have an obsession with orange soda, but if cardamom is in any dish, he can taste it.
Harry's eyebrow twitched. "Shut up, Malfoy."
"What? What is going on, Harry?" Draco's voice was brimming with exasperation and anxiety.
He hoped Fred was watching over George, whispering new prank ideas with the wind. He hoped he was managing mischief with Sirius, Remus and his father.
“Draco, we’ve been doing…whatever this is for a couple of months now. When have you known me to sneak out in the middle of the night?”
The blonde tried his hand to be mates
"What does that mean?"
Relief wrapped around Harry's heart like a warm blanket. "We'll see about that," his mouth stretched into a grin, cracking his slightly chapped lips. Draco's look of fond exasperation was worth it.
Dear--
"It's going to be fine. You'll be an amazing father, Draco,"
"Promise you'll kill him."
Given such license, Harry’s mind sure felt it had a lot of catching up to do; it brought images of blonde hair shining in the moonlight, gray eyes that held mirth instead of cruelty, cool, long nimble fingers wrapped around his own calloused ones as he lead the attached body into the crisp air.
"I just...how?"
"Don't be nervous, kid, you'll be fine. We're a family," they gestured to the other people in the room.
It’s over too soon, and later I’m watching the slow rise and fall of his chest as he sleeps. The judgmental moonlight glares accusingly at me through the window, but I pay it little mind. There’s privilege in having a natural shine. They would know, the moon and Harry.
The thing about Draco Malfoy is that he's not a very nice person.
"I'm sorry for shouting, Draco, I just--" He looked out the window, his heart sinking when he saw the darkened sky outside.
Xeno looked up from his book with a start, his eyes wide with fear until he saw his daughter. He placed a trembling hand on his chest. “Darling, you startled me.”
and instead ran a hand through his hair, careful not to muss it up.
"You know, Potter, between your little jokes and this stunt you pulled, I'm one insult away from Apparating on the spot and leaving you here."
“Residents?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “You wouldn’t.”
But I digress.
But either way, if you're reading this, please make sure it gets to the right people.
Harry groaned, rubbing their clothed cocks together and baring the side of his neck to Draco. "Draco, just do it."
Relief washed over him, and tears sprung behind his eyes for the first time since he’d sobbed in his mother’s arms when the war finally ended. Now, he blinked to focus on scanning the room until he landed on Potter.
That cannot be me.
“I can’t let you go!”
Malfoy closed his eyes. Finally, his chest rose in a deep breath. He exhaled, his lips forming the word "Hi," just before his body stilled.
Draco pursed his lips, swirling the wine in his glass and taking a sip as he considered the answer. “You don’t actually live in Grimmauld Place?”
Kudos and comments make my heart sing!
He wouldn't give Potter the satisfaction of watching him bleed again.
"Just stop trying, Harry. It's nice of you, but nicknames have never really done it for me."
Your smile is warmer than any sun, your kiss more cleansing than the rain, your touch chilling me more than deep winter snow.
He curled up into the warm blanket, finally letting the exhaustion of the day lull him to sleep.
9. I always wanted to write him a story, one starring those little people he was doodling. I wanted to help describe the world created by his mind. I wanted to do it together, for it to be ours.
I've studied you all my life. I practiced in the mirror, trying to see your features in mine. I tried to emulate the way you walk, the way you speak, the way you think. I wanted to live in the world you created for me — I was grateful for it — because you were the smartest person in my life. You knew better, and you knew more.
I watch Blaise pour himself into his work. I watch him gesture wildly into the Floo when he finishes work calls that delay our friendly dinners, his eyes bright and intense as he rants in complicated jargon. I watch him shy from sensitive topics in favor of discussing his job and his co-workers, and then shifting to mine, and then back to his when the subject dries up. I watch him politely send me off; he has work to do.
"Why not?"
He walked up the stairs, his step lighter. He threw on a soft jumper and trousers and attempted to fix his hair before he walked back down the stairs toward the fireplace.
Draco nodded, his cheek brushing Harry's shirt.
"Er, yes, can I help you?"
Harry bristled. "It's my comfort movie, don't judge me."
They sat at the table and Draco took a large bite before grinning in satisfaction.
Draco let out a laugh. “This show has romance, but I wouldn’t exactly call it fluffy.”
Harry felt tears prick at the back of his eyes. "No one's ever...no one's done anything like this for me before," he said quietly.
He schooled his features. “My nude yoga instructor.”
Harry sipped his drink, relishing the burn in the back of his throat. "I don't know."
“I thought you weren’t my friend?”
Bleeding cuts through one's clothes
"But that would imply—"
“I just answered a truth, so it’s my turn to ask,” Pansy smirked. “Potter, truth or dare?”
The hand on his arm squeezed gently, rousing Harry from his daze. He blinked and shook his head, his eyes focusing on Draco's entire face rather than just his mouth.
Harry held him every night. Let him sob. Let him shake. Let him gasp apologies, sputter out his regrets, give penance to his demons.
“Harry, you of all people have to understand!” Luna’s eyes welled up with tears. “I can’t just let him go! The Nargles are right. I’m the one who has to bring justice! I’m sorry, but the Aurors don’t do shite!’
Gathering his last scrap of courage, he looked Draco in the eye. "I want you to be mine."
“You’re tired of everything, Harry, aren’t you?”
it's in the safe cover of night that he lets his inhibitions slip from his practiced grip.
"Sorry."
I swallow hard. “It’s not what it seems.”
"What'd you say, mate?" Seamus's eyes glittered. "I couldn't quite understand."
60 days, they'd been on the road: him, Harry and Teddy. If you'd told him a year ago that this was how he'd be spending the first 60 days after Voldemort's victory in the war, he'd have called you loonier than Trewlany.
"I love you, too."
They don't know many of the details of that fateful night. As they sorted through the wreckage, Aurors found his diary by the bed, the words slightly smudged in some places from long-dried tears.
Draco didn't look at the way hurt and shock were written on the other man's face; he already knew every expression, every twitch of an eyebrow, every quirk of those lips, and what they all meant.
“Truth or Dare, Harry.”
“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.”
I cannot believe I am being so inordinately reckless. Putting my thoughts to paper is idiotic, even if this journal is protected by a spell only I can take off; they have ways of getting information. They always do.
That said, this is your official warning: don’t fuck with me. Or you might find yourself at an impromptu family reunion.
NSFW/smut
, but Hermione was too kind and Harry too self-conscious to voice it.
Of course, I don't know how you feel with regards to me, other than the confession of some romantic emotions when we first accidentally used this linked journal. But this is me trying to learn from you how to be more gracious, bolder. One step at a time, right?
He hadn’t appreciated Hogwarts’s rolling hills and cool breezes until eighth year, when he and Harry reclined on the ground and counted the stars until they reached infinity. He’d marveled at the expanse of twinkling lights above them when Harry’d gasped.
Draco hummed. “What about Athena?”
"Why! Why didn't you think this through before I fell in love with you?!"
The events of which may seem contrived
“...I guess? I didn’t pay much attention.”
“Why did you and Ginevra really end things?”
Harry had been called many names in his life.
"I said I think we should date."
Flames have an easy way of dancing, nipping at the air with scorching defiance; it's contained, yet free to thrive within its own space while it has energy, wood to fuel its life force.
Harry frowned. “You don’t have to.”
"Well, I-" Harry rubbed the back of his neck. "People are always telling me how highly you speak of me, how much it's clear how you feel about me and, well, I never hear any of that from you."
"She'll come around."
Prompt: truth or dare
“At least we found the body this time,” Ron looked at his hands in his lap.
Suddenly, the Floo roared to life, making Draco jump. Harry stumbled through with a panicked expression on his face, dusting the Floo powder from his formal robes.
The light swelled inside of the ghost, which groaned and sputtered. Suddenly, the ghost burst, staining everything with green slime.
You're my biggest weakness, didn't you know?
He checked his watch and resisted the urge to tap his foot against the leg of the stool upon which he was perched. He'd been sitting in front of the cell for seven minutes, and neither of them had said a word. And while Draco loved a silent game of chicken as much as the next proud Slytherin, he also had no desire to spend his free time staring at the man he would've been if it wasn't for Harry.
“I suppose I'll go, but only since I've already finished my tea,” Draco said with another sigh, which Harry ignored as they both rose from their seats. While they walked to the Apparition point together, Harry replayed in his mind the flicker of emotion on Draco’s face when he said “home.”
So Luna took matters into her own hands. She used her gift; her creatures happily helped her sew the red cloaks. She made lists and plans, read books and cared for her father. It was best not to tell him; his nerves couldn’t take it.
And Draco's smile is as blinding as he remembers.
“Maybe you should talk to him instead.”
Malfoy regarded him with narrowed, scrutinizing eyes, and Harry tried not to shift under the gaze.

Brooklyn Heights was about as suburban as you could get in New York without living upstate, and if you were that desperate for solitude, you should really move to Vermont or Rhode Island or even Canada. If you’re not inhaling a concerning amount of smog on a regular basis, Draco thought, you weren’t a New Yorker.
, standing on wobbly legs as he licked a drop of Harry's come from his lips. Harry's cock gave an excited twitch at the sight of Malfoy's swollen mouth, flushed cheeks, and mussed hair.
"It means Harry is—quite literally—tongue-tied until he kisses the object of his affections," Hermione said as she approached them. Ron moved to let her sit close to him, ignoring Seamus's exaggerated gagging when he kissed her cheek.
!" His voice was raspy and he coughed violently against his unused throat, but it was enough. His rib twitched and snapped, causing him to hiss, but he watched as light seeped from his body to take shape. The colors swirled as the details began to form: wild black hair, green eyes, tanned skin, unsoiled.
"Draco! Come on, I want to talk about this!"
Potter’s expression turned soft. “C'mere.”
nowadays, his only reprieve is found in the alleyway behind seedy Muggle bars, taking anything He will give him: His cock, His hand, His come; never His arse, never His mouth. harry offers himself over every time, hoping He will just take and take until harry's just a living body, and nothing more.
For this story of boys
Luna’s face turned warm once more, filling Harry with relief. “Thank you, Harry, but we’ll be alright,” she said. “No need to worry about us.”
"Oh, what a relief."
"No, I don't, but hopefully she'll want you to do what makes you happy."
Draco closed his eyes, braced himself.
“Thank you, Harry. Your hair makes you look handsome, by the way.”
"I thought you didn't read the Prophet."
"I know what you did, Malfoy."
Malfoy's expression was comically incredulous. "Have you forgotten about the unremovable mark on my arm?"
“There’s no ‘but,’ as far as I’m concerned. Draco, I love kissing you at midnight, at three in the afternoon, at six in the morning. Buzzed or sober, tired or energized, I don’t care. I want your midnights, and your mornings. And whenever else you’ll give me.”
He was a genius, after all. Potter could be talking about anything: his knowledge of the city, his taste in wine. But at the moment, he was particularly proud of himself for thinking to take Potter to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. It was gorgeous, especially at night. Draco often came here alone when he needed to think, but he’d seen couples walk down the path, holding hands and whispering to one another. It was the perfect romantic spot.
Harry and Malfoy leaned in again. Ron buried his head in his hands.
Harry rolled his eyes and gave him a flat look. Finally, Draco laughed and joined Harry on the grass, setting the basket next to them. He spread out a large blanket and fastened it with a temporary sticking charm.
"What are we doing here?"
It was intoxicating, the high that came whenever Draco bit him; when they rutted against each other as he drank his fill of Harry. It was about trust and mutual satisfaction. They both felt the mind-numbing effects of the bite, and Harry had learned to let himself fall into the nirvana, knowing Draco would be there to catch him.
The brunette in his doom
Potter blinked, shook himself, and jogged to catch up to Granger and Weasley.
Harry didn't hesitate to use his free hand to yank the blindfold up and over his head, ignoring Draco's amused expression at the way his hair must be sticking up, staticky. He reached into his pocket to retrieve his glasses, blinking as his eyes adjusted.
eyes on his back. He stepped out into the chill night air, sticking his hands in his leather jacket for warmth while he waited.
It could also be the fact that "Potter" had become "Harry" in just a few short weeks after the war, not to mention Draco's lack of discretion when he left the Manor late at night to meet Harry, whisked away on the back of the other man's motorcycle.
"Your friends miss you, you know."
He trudged toward the door, not bothering to throw a dressing gown over his boxers and t-shirt, despite the constant chill of Grimmauld Place.
10. This list—everything I know about him—is useless. I have all of this love and nowhere to put it, because he doesn’t want it anymore.
The spell settled over the Pensieve, causing it to glow for a moment before the light sank into the metal.
“Yes, love, I’m ready.”
Death Eater."
Harry gaped at him. "Malfoy, you could die!" His eyes welled with tears. "I won't kill you, I can't kill you, I never meant to—"
Did you tell them how I died? Did you tell them about the pools of water mixing with my blood at your feet? Did you tell them about how you watched the remains of my tarnished soul leave my body with my last feeble breath?
Surprise!! I wrote a little sequel to Gold Rush.
"What, nothing? No defense, no denial? At least you're not lying to us--again." Bellatrix was snarling now.
Harry smiled and reached into his pocket only to find it terrifyingly empty.
When they finally sat down, tea in hand, Draco spoke.
"Merlin,
“I’ll be there when it starts, sitting with Cori, Claire and Silver.”
“Fair enough. Hermione?” Pansy looked at Hermione expectantly.
Now, the choice is mine.
Potter’s jaw clenched. “It’s my—well, it was supposed to be my honeymoon with Ginny, but...well, there’s little point in two exes going on a romantic getaway together, and I already paid for it, so…”
He blew out the candle.
The stones were almost as glittering green as the eyes of the man who wore them.
Panic rose in Harry’s chest. “Merlin, okay, do you want to sit down? Are you alright?”
"No, Harry. You deserve this. You died, but you decided to come back to this twisted world. While I think we should celebrate that choice every day, I think you'd strangle me at some point, but you'll just have to suffer through a little extra spoiling from me for the month of July." Draco's face was intent, fiery.
Draco smirked lazily. “Oops,” he said with a grin in his voice. “Guess you gotta carry me.”
"I know you were on the opposite side, but it doesn't look like you were very much involved--and you did come in very helpfully at the end there, so..." Harry stuck out his hand. "My name's Harry. What's yours?"
He landed with a thud on a balcony. After a crack, Harry appeared next to him, gasping to catch his breath for a moment.
Draco absolutely did not blush.
Draco was still shocked, and Harry felt irrational, intense fear well up inside him before Draco's face broke out into a teary smile.
“Can I help you?” Malfoy drawled, “Or do you mind taking your boisterous conversation elsewhere? I was here first.”
Ron watched in shock as Harry leaned forward, pressing his lips to Malfoy's. Hermione reached for his hand and squeezed comfortingly. Finally, the two boys pulled apart for air, and Ron tried not to cry out in shock again when he saw them both smile softly.
And, of course, for two enemies-turned-acquaintances who had absolutely no romantic or sexual feelings for one another whatsoever. No matter how many times they’d shared accidental touches and traded light teasing.
Draco looked at him, startled. "You don't?"
I'm sure you're wondering why I'm writing in this journal once again since we discovered at the beginning at the year that they were linked. I'm still not sure what magic caused them to be connected in such a way, but part of me suspects in retrospect that it was my dear Pansy realizing what I'd written and trying to
"Exactly. Former, as in not anymore."
“Okay, let’s start off easy. I’m an Auror. I live in Grimmauld Place. And I went to Romania for six months after eighth year.”
Little Red.
But his common sense tended to flee at the sight of messy hair and green eyes.
“I said no! You had your chance to ask for forgiveness, for redemption, for protection. Gods, I should’ve known you’d never keep your word. Once a wolf, always a wolf, right?
"Ah, good to see that your tracking skills aren't too hopeless. Now, care to tell me what's wrong with this picture?"
He lets his wand fall loosely from his fingers and clatter to the ground, likely getting wet from the pooling water that's sure to damage the floor, but he doesn't care. He thinks he hears it clink against one of the two empty firewhiskey bottles scattered on the ground, and he doesn't care.
"But Harry doesn't like anyone, does he? Do you, mate?" Ron glanced at Harry, who turned red.
Harry's eyebrows furrowed as he took in the sight of the moonlight glittering on the Black Lake. The air was quiet and damp, likely from recent rain; a cool wind cut through humid air for a moment of relief.
at the damage, and the broken pieces quickly slotted back into place.
You look so peaceful like this. The harsh lines of your thinning face are relaxed, your piercing stare is shaded by your eyelids, your unclenched fists are guns with empty chambers.
I feel you constantly, your eyes on me. I yearn to touch you, to let myself fall into you, easily and with abandon. Every step I take away from you sends me further into withdrawal, an emotional purge from a Harry Potter addiction.
And the blonde knew the end
So when Harry walked into the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione for the first day of eighth year, and the entire room broke out into whispers that made them sound like a snake pit, Harry froze.
“I thought you two were just going for drinks?”
"I can handle myself, thanks."
“You’re welcome. Good luck, gentlemen.”
"Er, it's nothing, Malfoy, never mind—"
That was enough to make Harry blink awake. "I'm sorry, my what?"
“Amycus Carrow, Avery Jr., Travers, Rookwood, and Jugson. And they
Harry bit his lip. "Draco, I'm sorry I don't like whipped cream. I'm sorry I forget to do laundry, and that I dragged you to Sunday dinner. I'm sorry that I worry you sometimes because my job is dangerous. I'm sorry I run late to our dates sometimes.
Sometimes, when the ache of missing you is a little too strong, I close my eyes and imagine your comforting grip, solid and real; the way you used to be. I pretend you really are on my shoulder as if you don't have anything better to do in the afterlife than hang out with me; than to keep your promise.
Something swelled in Harry's chest. "Yes you did, love. You made that."
"I was trying to be brave!" Draco's lower lip wobbled. "I was trying to act on my feelings, follow my heart and all that Gryffindor crap!"
Harry grit his teeth. “Obviously not, Draco.”
Suddenly, familiar arms wrapped around his waist and Apparated them both to a nearby alleyway they'd come to think of as theirs. Harry turned within Draco's hold and kissed him, running his tongue along his teeth and carefully tracing the fangs, making them both shiver.
And it ends with a shake.
She walked until she reached a clearing far from the graveyard. She reached into her pocket and retrieved her knife. She took off her cloak, ignoring the freezing wind that nipped at her skin. With a grimace, she cut through the fabric, reducing it to shreds before leaving it in a pile.
"What?"
Lucius hadn't looked at Draco when he spoke, the distinguished, aristocratic features facing the ancient walls of the Manor.
And they need me ‘till the war is won
His face looked back at him in the mirror; he saw the same familiar collection of features. His father's hair and face, and his mother's eyes; none of it his own.
"...Don't be stupid."
Songfic prompt "Mine" by Taylor Swift
It was a bit risky, he knew, to be standing outside alone at night. But the pull of nostalgia in his gut was stronger than the ache of his feet and the worry of danger.
Draco stretched. "I'm getting tired. I think I'll head back if that's alright."
“Of course you are. I always knew you were batshit,” Draco snarled. “Loony—just like your father.”
Malfoy turned around, wand drawn and sneering. “W-what are you doing here, Harry?”
“So, what’re we doing today?” Potter asked around a mouthful of eggs florentine.
"Draco! Good you're home I--when did you get glasses?" Potter had the audacity to look confused.
“Well, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some resentment, but I highly doubt this Little Red person is one of them. Little Red clearly wants to leave their mark. They want everyone to know that they were the killer. I would wager that if a Neo Death Eater were to go on a revenge killing spree, they’d make it a lot less conspicuous.”
He hardly recognized himself. His gray eyes were enhanced by thick eyelashes and his face looked thinner, more feminine. A dark wig framed his face and brushed his shoulders. The red lipstick was bright and striking with his features. It felt like meeting a different part of himself he'd never known could exist.
They stared; not in competition, not daring the other to turn away first. They just stood there, looking at one another.
"Right, I remember that part. How did the crash happen? Are you okay?"
“I would greet you, but I’m afraid my transformation last night has left me rather debilitated.”
Sincerely,
On one particular day I am bold enough to set foot on one such street, keeping my head low and eyes downcast, humble, so unlike what I was taught.
"Anytime," Cori said with a smile. "I can teach you how to do this yourself if you want."
The bar was dimly lit. A few tables surrounded a small dance floor and a stage. It was relatively quiet since the night was still young, but a few people were sitting and talking in hushed conversations. One person danced by himself to the upbeat song, uncaring of the world around him as he undulated his hips to the music.
“Have you ever played Two Truths and a Lie?”
"Good."
Draco ran from the room, ignoring the professor's shout and Potter's stare at his back.
Ever since Harry turned up outside of his flat, awkward and determined with ‘I love you’ on his lips, Draco no longer needed to hope for celestial intervention beyond the thick haze above him in order to find happiness, contentment.
Putting on his best Auror glare, Harry crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. "Get lost," he said, warning lacing his tone.
He felt his skin tingle with the realization that Harry Potter stood in front of him, vulnerable in the big city. He looked at Draco like a lost child in a supermarket, all big eyes and curiosity. It was heady, the thought of Potter finally seeing him in his element, at his peak—a far cry from the waifish, terrified boy who cowered before the Wizengamot as he was read the terms of his parole.
He froze, fingers still tangled in Potter’s hair, and he removed them when he noticed the others start to murmur amongst themselves.
That moment of blind rage in the bathroom haunted Harry enough during the day that he wasn't surprised that it would make its way into his dreams--but his chest hurt with the knowledge that perhaps it might've gone differently. Might've ended in whispered apologies, explanations, and soft, exploring kisses.
Harry let himself laugh a little. "It's not that either. It's just--none of this," he waved a hand lazily at the mirror, "is mine. Everything in the mirror is from someone else. And that's all people care about. They see my face and think about what belongs to them or to someone else and they don't think about the fact that it's mine. It belongs to me, not them."
“But—”
Harry's heart melted. "It's completely fine, love. You just put the lid back on the water when the pasta was in the pot, which made the pressure build and the water spill over the side. It's alright! All fixed. We'll have delicious pasta."
He hoped Remus finally made peace with the moon, that a scar would never again mar his skin. He hoped Sirius had his leather jacket and his bike. He hoped his father was still messing up his hair, and that his mother rolled her eyes. He hoped Tonks fascinated them all with her magical features and sharp wit.
The person chuckled a little. "Neither. I'm nonbinary. I use they/them pronouns."
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Nomadic. Really?"
"So, I'm not dead, then," Harry knits his eyebrows.
I imagine you can relate, assuming you’ve decided to continue your own existence.
Malfoy rose back up again, throwing his head back onto Harry's shoulder. His breath was hot and panting and his smirk was almost a smile, but all Harry could focus on was Malfoy’s gray eyes enhanced by thick, black eyeliner, slightly smudged and running with sweat and exertion.
It was unsustainable. They'd both known it, but they were too caught up in the excitement, the intoxication of releasing years of pent-up tension. Draco would often ask himself—as he watched Harry's bare back rise and fall with slow, sleep-heavy breaths—if it was worth it; the inevitable pain. And when he was alone in his flat, accompanied by a bottle of wine and his favorite takeaway, it was.
"I'm just saying. You called yourself a Death Eater. Are you?"
My room is my only haven from this war; I don't recognize the rest of my own home anymore. He's taken it over. Even Father's clearly distressed, and while Mother is the most blank-faced of us all, I can see the glimmer of resentment, of anger in her eyes. Toward Father, toward the Dark Lord, toward the war. I can't say I blame her.
"Yes."
"She said you were...talking in your sleep."
Draco licked Harry's neck once more before gently but firmly sinking his teeth into the skin, drinking his fill. Harry groaned, his knees buckling slightly. They rutted against one another, Draco still managing to move his hips in tandem with Harry's. The heat of their clothed cocks combined with the bliss of the bite was enough for Harry's cock to twitch and spill into his pants untouched, Draco following shortly after as he licked up the remnants of his meal from Harry's neck.
He was proud of himself, really, for holding out so long without risking their friendship and pouncing on the other boy with Gryffindorish reckless abandon. It was his fear of losing Draco after only just moving from awkward acquaintances to genuine friends that kept his impulsivity in check. That held him back from seeing if Draco's lips were really as soft as they looked.
Malfoy shrugged elegantly. “If I say it out loud, maybe my mind will stop feeling like a fork in a Muggle garbage disposal.”
Draco looked up from his favorite chair to see the remnants of a snowball drip down the window. Frowning, he rose from his seat when another snowball hitting the glass pane made him jump.
At first, I thought it was Lucius, and that he’d come here to reunite with his old friend. But the man turned his head and I saw the same look of fear in his eyes that I saw in yours.
Draco's chuckle was rich and gave Harry pleasant goosebumps. "I promise you've been here before. Surely you know by the air around us that we're outside, at least."
At that, Harry grabbed Malfoy by the arm, and the other man let himself be dragged through the crowd and into the thankfully empty bathroom.
“It was your idea!”
But Harry couldn't. Despite every Gryffindor urge in his body, every impulse that screamed at him to show up on Draco's doorstep in the pouring rain with flowers and 'I love you' on his lips, he knew it wasn't his place. Draco could resent him for the rest of his life if Harry pushed him to end things with Astoria just to end up brokenhearted with him.
“Four is my final offer.”
It was his own damn fault, too. Draco'd made it explicitly clear at the beginning of their little...liaison that it could never go further, never be more. It was simply a way for Draco to blow off steam and stay within Pureblood social customs. While he and Astoria were betrothed, it was accepted for their pre-marital affairs to be an open secret until the rings were exchanged and vows said.
“I’ll tell you what,” Harry swallowed. “I won’t argue about you wasting days away from work if you let me take you to dinner when I’ve recovered.”
“Yes, the person killing neo-Death Eaters. Why?”
"Merlin Harry! What the fuck?"
They hurled hexes and jinxes and curses at one another, streams of magic flying around the room and singeing random objects in the cluttered Room. Finally, after dodging a particularly nasty spell, Harry snarled, "
The icy ground crunched under Harry's boot when he stepped into the clearing. Dread twisted in his stomach as he surveyed the scene until his eyes caught on something red in the snow.
Draco's expression was comically strange; he stared at Harry for a full twenty seconds before he let out a short, sharp laugh. "You are joking, right?"
“I’m Seeker for the Falcons.”
harry's favorite place is on his knees, His cock in his mouth, drawing any small whimpers, gasps, and moans he can from the lips he's never kissed, never dared. each pant, each caught breath, each flutter of pale eyelashes is a reward that belongs to harry. it's undeniably because of him, for him.
The man barely mumbled a "Huh?" before Harry pointed the wand at the newly formed, yet familiar chest. "
(See the end of the chapter for
the potion whispers in his ear. He checks his forearm once more to make sure the glamour is still holding and, seeing Potter standing alone, adjusts the silver Colombina mask on his face and approaches him.
"Sorry, pumpkin."
Harry groaned. "Merlin, you're hard, Malfoy."
But with someone like Draco, you'd think there'd be a softer side, one that only Harry got to see. You'd think that when they were alone together, in the quiet of their bedroom, he'd be sweet, romantic. He'd give Harry his private smile, the one where his mouth curls up the corners and his eyes go a little hazy and it makes Harry's heart skip a beat.
But then one test turned into two. Before he knew it, Draco spent the better part of his days coming in and out of deep periods of sleep, reaching for the vial every time his eyes opened to the sight of his empty flat, his engagement band on the coffee table next to him.
“Honestly, Ron, I don’t know for sure, but the Death Eaters are either dead, in Azkaban, or missing.”
Harry didn't understand how someone could still look so gorgeous under hospital lights, but Draco managed it somehow. He had bags under his eyes and his lip trembled every so often, but Draco still managed to be more beautiful than anyone else Harry'd ever seen.
I have to think for myself now
When Draco asks about it, running a nimble finger over the ink, Harry smiles.
Kingsley shook his head. “It was a false confession. We even questioned Bellatrix under Veritaserum; we have reason to believe she was Imperiused to confess to crimes she didn’t commit.”
But Draco shook his head. “No, I’m fine. But I think that’s my sign to head home.”
They flew for a little while longer in comfortable silence. Draco closed his eyes, and he realizes that he's never felt safer or more free in his life than right now, with his arms around Potter's waist and the world and its problems so small below them.
He stood there, his mind whirling with images of pale hair, glittering grey eyes, and softly smiling lips that leaned in to press against his skin.
"Draco, why can't I look now?"
Unforgivables must be cast with feeling; like a Patronus.
Harry cringed and turned back to face the table to see Ron and Hermione looking at him, expressions full of nausea and amusement, respectively. He held up a hand in a small wave. Hermione shook her head and smiled fondly.
Harry took it in his own, lacing their fingers.
With the Dursleys, he was a "freak." He was "
"I'm sorry, Harry, I--"
—" he cut himself off, doubling over in his laughter.
They sneered and they smirked
Draco huffed. "Well, what do you want from me? How am I to learn without a competent teacher?"
But Potter shook his head. "We're fine, I promise Taygete won't let us fall. Why are you crying? If you're scared I can bring you back, I—"
Sometimes I talk to Granger.
He sat down in the chair across from Draco, who glared at him over his cup of tea. "I thought I told you not to follow me."
Draco held himself back from shaking his leg nervously against the bed as he watched Potter shake off the sleepy cobwebs in his mind. Finally, Potter sat up and turned, revealing taut abs and the waistband of his pants, the latter of which Draco noted with a mix of relief and disappointment.
“Ow!”
“It’s part of the experience. You don’t have to waste your time schlepping to the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building, but this is a major cultural city in the world, Potter.”
Draco pursed his lips in a show of false nonchalance. “Better late than never, I suppose.”
"I...I guess? Yeah, I mean I had to."
"Is it my socks?"
You don’t have to have read Fog or Wish for this to make sense, but here is the fluffy epilogue to Harry and Draco’s storyline! Enjoy.
“I’m leaving tomorrow.”
Ron turned to Seamus. "Can you translate?"
Harry noticed Draco’s jaw tighten. He ached to reach up and relax it with a gentle touch, but he kept his hand at his side.
Harry reached across to squeeze his hand. “Thank you, Draco. This is really helpful.”
Potter had the decency to look ashamed. “No, I—I believe you, Malfoy, I’m just surprised. I always imagined you’d go into politics or become some business tycoon or something.”
"There you are, Harry, just keep following my lead. Yes alright you can look at our feet for now, but eventually you'll have to keep eyecontact."
“Okay, go ahead.”
Apparently, there wasn't any shaving cream in Azkaban; or razors, for that matter.
HUGE thank you to the incredible
Draco'd said, tears in his eyes, clenching his fists
Also find me on Tumblr!
Malfoy Manor was colder than she remembered. Luna ignored the blaring wards, knowing she only had a little time before someone was alerted. But it wouldn’t take long; she only had to find—
"Don't."
And how they fit with mine.
Draco blushed but glared at her. “At least I never killed anyone.”
Draco smirked a little. Then, suddenly, he leaned in and planted a quick kiss on Harry's cheek. He was gone from the hallway an instant later, and if Harry didn't know better he'd think Draco had Apparated.
"They do when they're the partner to her favorite former student. Besides, I think there's little she'd deny you that's within her power. She agreed readily once I told her my plans."
Harry's voice sounded gruff even to his own ears. He rarely had reason to speak, but he didn't expect his throat to feel so thick.
The Last Will and Testament of Harry James Potter.
"You won't."
"Harry, what's going on?"
"Yeah?"
"Right...er, okay, here's something you don't know about me. I don't like whipped cream."
Draco laughed humorlessly. "I ceased being your son the moment you forced me to join Voldemort." He chuckled again when Lucius flinched. "I suppose I should be more aware of my company. Harry's gotten me in that habit."
I'm in the shine of your skin.
"Fucking Draco." He mumbled into his glass before letting the amber liquid burn the back of his throat, just to feel something there other than the telltale lump that always preceded tears.
Draco flushed and turned away. "Not anymore," he croaked.
Potter opened his mouth, probably to ask Draco what he meant, but he was interrupted by the lights going down.
"Like I said. Not subtle."
They stood there a moment too long, Potter's hands lingering on Draco's hips and Draco unwilling to brush them off.
“W-what?”
“Merlin, I’m batting a thousand in this conversation, aren’t I?” Potter gave him a small, sheepish smile.
He snapped out of his trance and forced his legs to move. "Potter?"
It wasn’t like a flower sprouting through the earth, or the sun peering through the clouds; it couldn’t be compared to a bullet piercing the air and rupturing its target, or jumping from a waterfall into a crystal blue lake.
Ron turned red and plugged his fingers into his ears. “Nope, nope I can’t hear you!”
The man nodded, scurrying out of the now silent bar, the bell attached to the door tinkling behind him.
Potter turned to him with raised eyebrows. Draco flushed and let go of his arm, relieved when Potter didn’t keep walking.
"Never. Especially not toward you, baby."
“Four and a half.”
“Wait, you live here?”
"He already has!"
"H-Harry," came the breathy, surprised reply. "I didn't think--"
Draco clutched the bathroom sink, resenting the sight of his tears dropping onto the porcelain. He scowled when they didn't erode the porcelain, that they weren't acidic after burning in his eyes. How unfair that only he should be the only one to feel this pain.
Now, they smiled at Harry, who grinned and raised his beer in a silent toast. Normally, Harry might be chatting with Draco's friends, but he had his own table, sitting across from an empty chair, waiting patiently for Draco to be done.
Standing on quaking, bloodless legs, he tried to brush some of the grime from his torn and tattered robes, but the effort was futile. It was no matter; he needn't pretend to be clean, letting the flesh reflect the madness and all that.
I really don't know how it got like this.
Harry paused for a moment before he narrowed his eyes at Draco. “What are you doing here?”
Harry groaned. "I regret this. I regret everything. Just--forget it."
“The only one I can really think of is Pettigrew, but he’s dead. And that Bellatrix story seems so obviously fake in retrospect—she was obsessed with Riddle. Like...I wouldn’t be surprised if the two of them…” Harry trailed off and gave Ron a pointed look.
Harry's hands tightened on Draco's hips. "Draco, can I..."
If you were awake, you'd call me an idiot in that fond way of yours that really means that you think you deserved worse than the effects of a spell that neither of us knew at the time. And I'd just smile at you because I can't believe you let me be near you, let alone
*breathily* “There…good.”
It was his face, but it didn't belong to him.
, am taking a break to play this game, then surely you can, too?”
Harry shrugged. “Sorry.”
60 days, they'd been on the road: him, Harry and Teddy. If you'd told him a year ago that this was how he'd be spending the first 60 days after Voldemort's victory in the war, he'd have called you loonier than Trewlany.
Harry shrugged. “If you don’t like those terms, I can come up with more. Now that I’m on bed rest, I’ve got plenty of time to think.”
Other times, she'd let herself stare unabashedly at her sleeping husband; his long, shining blonde hair loose from its ponytail and draped down his back, his shoulders. If she was feeling bold, she might lean in toward him, trying to remember his lemongrass scent. She would run her fingers through his hair the way he used to let her, humming and arching into her touch.
He grabbed the end of her cloak and cast pointed his wand at it. “
They say, this path is for me
It didn’t take long for Luna to get to Romania. Getting a Portkey only took a day, and once she landed, she headed straight for the morgue.
Landing the ship used to be Harry's least favorite part of flying; at first, his instinct had been to fight against the pull of gravity, but Captain Lupin had taught him the art of using the force to his advantage, a guide to a smooth landing.
A loud crack pierced the air, startling her. She sniffed the air and panicked when she detected a distinctly human scent. She took off into the forest, leaving the strips of fabric in the snow behind her.
Draco pressed his lips together. "Sorry, I know yesterday you said you were alright, but I just..." he trailed off, his eyes looking anywhere but Harry. "I've been where you are, before, and I wished someone had been there for me to make sure I was still functioning. And I know we haven't been dating all that long, and you just let me into the wards, and I can go if you want me to but--"
time."
Potter's mouth parted in shock. "What?"
Harry shuddered. “Definitely. So, do we have any leads? Interviews with the father?”
Harry, who was waiting for him at home. Harry, who loved hearing Draco's stories of petty revenge against Lucius; delighted in them, in fact.
Draco's head nearly snapped as he turned to look at a pale-faced Harry sitting in the chair next to his bed. Near Harry stood an unfamiliar woman scribbling on a clipboard. She reached over onto a side table and handed Draco a paper cup. The water was cool, a relief for his parched, sandpaper throat.
Harry's throat tightened at the note. He took another bite of the cookie and turned back to the movie on the telly.
Fear. May it be the greatest gift I ever gave to you, son.
"Don't you have a choice?"
She smirked. “Hello, Greyback. I got your letter. I thought I might deliver my response in person.”
Potter ran a hand through his long, messy hair. “I don’t know…”
And he smiles.
He gathers just enough strength to retrieve his wand with an
I’ll know where you are. If you take this cloak off or cancel the spell, I’ll know. You have two days. In forty-eight hours and one second, you’re done.”
Draco waved a hand. "I remember all that. What happened after we left?"
"Let me show you." Draco adjusted the bag on his shoulder and tugged on Harry's arm without the same care as when he'd been blindfolded. They slowed to a stop in front of a large oak tree that sat a little further along the banks of the lake than Harry'd gone before.
“Well, if there’s anything I can do…” Harry gave her a small smile.
Such as right now.
Stolen glances from across the common room, brushing hands as they pass in the hallway, inside jokes snuck into mundane group conversations with oblivious outsiders.
He had never felt so alive.
He ended the levitation charm on his trunk and then shrunk it to fit into his pocket. He then walked along the cobblestone street and entered the bar.
Harry didn’t think about Draco; he tried not to, anyway, but on nights like these, when the silence is too loud, he can’t help but let his thoughts roam free.
"What?"
“Is there anyone else you can think of that Little Red could target?”
They lead Draco into a back room. A row of mirrors and chairs lined the wall, as people chattered and sipped cocktails and ran around with wigs, half-done makeup, clothes, and heels. Draco blinked, stunned.
Draco scowled, a comforting, familiar sight. "What in Merlin's name are you talking about?"
"Y-yes, but that's in congruence with generations of treaties!"
Seven things he didn't know he missed. Seven things he wanted back in his life.
Draco's expression turned exasperated. "I don't know, Harry, that's rather the point."
Still, Harry knew better than to assume that a place was uninhabited simply because it appeared empty at first glance. His home planet, Hogwarts, had been diligent about educating its citizens about the horrors of colonialism on Earth. Seizing land through subjugation and slavery and violence, humans of the past had been barbaric, inhumane.
I want—
Something in Harry's chest twisted painfully. "I wish that we'd been friends sooner."
"I wish you'd leave me the fuck alone!" Malfoy growled, forcefully casting a defensive spell, which Harry blocked.
But now, I need to discover who and what I am in this world after having lost almost everything I've ever known. I need to separate myself from my Father, and my goals from my obligations; I cannot do that around the one person whose very presence makes me forget how to breathe, how to think of anything else but him.
When I let myself think about it, I fail to understand why I'm so drawn to you. I used to loathe myself for feeling like just another among your followers, but my connection with you went beyond mere admiration. I watched you constantly, as you did me, and I saw the parts of you that no one looked close enough to observe.
Harry took the map he'd placed on the bedside table earlier. "Right now we're here, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania," Harry pointed at the map. "If we wake up at 7 tomorrow morning, we should make it to Chicago by about 7 or 8, with a few breaks along the way."
Malfoy gagged a little as Harry’s cock hit the back of his throat, but he recovered quickly and continued his ministrations as his tongue brought sweet torture to Harry's cock.
You must think yourself clever.
"Overthinking--whatever it is. I can practically hear you panicking internally," Potter's rough, sleepy voice was far sexier than should be allowed. "It's fine."
he said to Ron, a month into Auror training. He'd expected anger, shock. Instead, Ron just clapped him on the shoulder and gave him a thin-lipped smile that said
for the beta! <3
"Yes, I do."
Draco nodded again, not trusting himself to speak. He took the wand from Potter’s hand, closing his eyes and welcoming the familiar spark of magic as it traveled through his fingers and throughout his body.
"Malfoy!!"
You've given up on the pretense of not staring at him. The sun is setting, and that means he'll soon be yours.
I laugh and toss my cigarette to the ground, crushing the ash under my new dress shoes. "When have I ever?"
As they ate dinner, looking out over the city, Harry gave him a cheeky grin. "So, tell me, how'd I do?"
Harry squints against the sunlight that streams through the window and irritates his sleep-heavy eyes. He doesn't know how long he's been asleep, and the daylight is the only indication of the time. He reaches blindly on his bedside table, muttering a curse when he knocks over a half-empty glass of water along with his alarm clock and what he thinks is his wand.
a hangover potion and drank it down, wincing at both the bitter taste and the fast-acting effects. He shook his head and looked back at the source of the disturbance.
Draco shook himself. "Right, sorry." He hissed when he caught sight of the gash along Potter's side, poorly healed as predicted. Draco cast the appropriate charms and Summoned a potion from his stores. After Potter chugged it without question, his immediate trust doing funny things to Draco's insides, the gash was healed.
"Oh hello, Potter. Come to see the show?"
After that, the two of them had gone for a drink, and Harry'd been a champion at differentiating between Draco's pronouns as Tarasque and those as himself. They'd talked and laughed and flirted until finally, Draco realized he was spending more time at Harry's flat than his own, to the point that Tarasque had their own small closet at Harry's. Draco'd even gotten into drag at Harry's flat when running late.
Even as instinctual fear wrapped his heart in an icy grip, he closed his eyes, preparing to be consumed by the fire. Soon, he would be mere ashes, indistinguishable from the remains of the Room.
"Not to you, Potter. Not anymore."
Harry felt Voldemort pull sharply out of his mind. He blinked at Harry in astonishment, and Harry just smirked.
From across the club, Harry hadn't taken the time to admire Malfoy's outfit before storming toward him, but from up close, he was able to run his hands across the front of Malfoy's chest, surprised to note that the sheer button-down was undone all the way down near his navel. Malfoy bent over on the beat of the song and pressed up closer against him, giving Harry easy access to that firm, leather-clad arse. Harry’s eyes trailed down to admire Malfoy’s lean, long legs, accentuated by dragonhide boots. As Malfoy continued to grind his arse against Harry, he felt his cock stir in his trousers, starting to press against the zipper.
On the field of the battle
Harry smiled fondly. Taking Draco's hand, he led them toward the Burrow, its warm light a welcome destination in the icy weather.
"NO!" Hurt flashed across Draco's face for a moment before he schooled his features once more. Harry closed his eyes.
Harry smiles. "I want to go with you."
“And I want to kiss you.”
I do things now, like talk to Granger and spend late nights hunched over my isolated desk and get excited about Muggle scientific theory because I refuse to believe that your case is cold--not when the warmth of your magic clings to a bench in Diagon.
"Do you—"
Draco straightened his spine. “Granger and Weasley sent me.”
He really shouldn't have been surprised to see Hermione's owl pecking at his window one day--and he definitely shouldn't have been puzzled by her message
Suddenly tired of the company of his peers, Draco mumbled a quick “See you later, Pans,” before pushing his way out of the classroom ahead of the other students. Pansy might have called after him, but he wasn’t sure, and either way, he didn't bother to check.
Every time he turned the key to a new motel room, with every acquaintance he loved for a night, he remembered that none of it belonged to him; none of it was his responsibility. He had no home to clean, no job to slave over, and no friends or partner to demand accountability or companionship.
He didn't believe it at the time. How could anyone care more for someone else than for themself? His father certainly hadn't. What if he wasn't any better? What if—
She pointed her wand at the shreds. "
. And it is easy, with Potter. Draco can't help but wonder if he could do this without the mask.
Draco scoffed to himself. Nostalgia, seriously? How pathetic to be brooding over events that’d just transpired over the past three days. It wasn’t as if this was some distant childhood memory that he was reliving years later, reflecting on how far his life had come. No, he was 25 years old and reminiscing over the past weekend like he was an elderly man on his deathbed wondering where the time had gone.
"Okay," Draco said, his voice trembling slightly.
“Question me under Veritaserum, if you must! I swear on my honor as a Malfoy!”
Draco nuzzled closer in answer, wrapping an arm around Harry's waist and closing his eyes.
Potter pressed his lips together. "Well, the way I see it, we have two choices. The first is, I can go and leave you to your Sunday morning. Or--" Potter looked away. "We could get up, I can make us breakfast, and I can get to know you better."
"Merlin you're impossible."
But then, I was taught a lot of things.
Harry kissed his temple in answer, squeezing him a little tighter in his arms.
Draco should walk away and pretend that he’d never seen him. He was a good person now; everyone at WDKMUS (Wixen District Kitchen and Magical Unity Service) thought so. He worked for a non-profit; he didn’t need to be charitable in his free time, too, especially after a long and emotionally taxing day of working his arse off to help low-income Wixen families.
They all chucked. "Thank you, dear," Cori gave him a knowing look before tilting their head in thought. "You know," they said with pursed lips. "You'd look just
Harry nodded, taking the proffered arm in his own. "Ready."
He hoped he’d know the answers, one day. And that that particular day was far, far away. And for now, as he took Draco’s hand in his, he knew they’d fall asleep in one another’s arms. He didn’t have to hope.
Harry's breathing grows shallow. "T-ten years? Am I...am I dead?"
Draco sighed, letting his breath fog the air and disappear into the thick dark night.
She nodded, her brown eyes knowing and no longer naive.
Draco moved their hips to the slow beat, walking around the stage and trying to gracefully pick up the tips being thrown onto the stage, much more practiced in these cherry red stilettos than they'd been at the beginning of their career performing as Tarasque.
He'd lie in bed after she'd gone, wondering if perhaps the dragon had reasons to attack. Maybe the villagers meant to kill it. Maybe it wanted to be left alone. Or maybe that's all it knew.
With a smirk, Harry tossed him a hairbrush, which Draco caught with Seeker instinct.
Harry's expression was as pained, yet kind. "Do you have any idea how agonizing it has been to miss you?"
“Take several days off of work to care for the other when they’re injured. I’m not even sure friends do that.”
One of the best parts of living in Godric’s Hollow was the stars.
At class and the Ball
The clock is still on the floor, shattered and silent.
"No, really, parchment burns easily."
Draco sighed. “Alright, Potter. Meet me outside your hotel at 9:30 tomorrow morning. Get some rest––tomorrow will be a long day.”
Draco shook his head. "Do you know what I see, when I look at you."
"Yes, My Lord?"
"Did you, now? I get so much mail, I can scarcely keep track."

He hadn't heard anything. No Owl, no Floo, no
Father is waiting for me in the living room. His glower makes me miss the moon, and I almost try to Apparate away, but he turns on the wards before I can lift my wand, and I’m trapped.
“What’s stopping you?”
"M-Malfoy?"
Voldemort snarled. “Truth or Dare, Harry Potter.”
1. He loves treacle tart, to the point that he will forego dinner when it is offered alongside legitimate food for his meal. He will eat his dessert last like a dignified human in any other circumstances but show him treacle tart and he can’t help but dig right in.
So when Harry stood in the middle of downtown Muggle London facing the entrance of "Deliquesce," the gay club he'd heard about from a too-knowing, winking Seamus, he knew there was no turning back.
With a sigh, he swung his legs over the side of the bed and planted his feet on the ground.
He had always thought that Potter basked in the attention, that he flaunted his fame and enjoyed the fawning from, well, almost the entire Wizarding World, really. But now, as Draco looked closer, he could see the irritation in the way Potter kept his lips pressed together, the small smile plastered on his face not reaching his eyes. He could, even from the Slytherin table, notice Potter’s exhaustion with it all.
Other than the standard wand and lasso, Draco Malfoy's Explorer uniform was unlike Harry's own. While Hogwarts required its Explorers to wear black steel-toed boots, trousers, a button-down shirt, and a badge, it seemed that Explorers from Truiepets dressed in a uniform reminiscent of old English military garb. While it lacked all the same accouterments and the iconic red color, the striking midnight blue military-style waistcoat, black trousers, and high boots gave the rival Explorers a much more posh, distinguished look than Harry's own country demanded.
Draco nodded. "Likewise. And are you no--nonbinary too?"
She felt her stomach twist at the hurt and resignation in Harry’s eyes as he
Oh, sod it. Hi, Harry.
"Okay."
away, not closing her eyes when her vision twisted into orange and yellow swirls before she disappeared with a pop into the thick, smoky night.
Malfoy paused for a moment, before realization, and then anger dawned over his face. "That won't be necessary, Potter, I'll just be on my way--"
Draco smirked. "I'm pretty fond of you when you're not around."
“What about when a Prophet photographer snaps a photo of me walking into their office?”
It’s a game, I could, forfeit
"Harry, I--" Draco turned around but was startled into silence at the sight of Harry on his knee, a hopeful smile on his face and a small black box in his hand.
He grinned at her. Good, old Luna.
“Tell me, Harry, has that been working out for you? Or am I being more effective than the entire Auror department?”
“Keep your enemies under close watch,” Father always said. That’s why Draco was staring at Potter all the time. It was merely surveillance. Gathering intelligence. But he couldn’t tell Pansy, of course; she wouldn’t understand.
He returns to the tattoo parlor alone. He winces under the sharp needle, but he's careful not to jerk away.
(Is that bad, to curse in my will? Whatever, I don't have time and I don't really care. Sorry 'Mione.)
Potter's grin widens.
"Are you sure? I don't want to--you shouldn't have to comfort me about this, about him. You, of all people,
I hate it when you smirk
Merlin, help him.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. "Are you alright?"
It's not too bad, as far as messages go; the sentiment is true enough. There are worse words to have carved into one's skin; he shoves down the memory of Bellatrix's handiwork on Hermione's arm.
Luna left the cabin and cast a
I would thank you for taking time out of your busy Savior Funeral Victory Tour schedule to attend mine, but it was the perfect opportunity to sneak in your bloody post-war agenda. That must have been satisfying—preaching about second chances and redemption next to the casket of the boy you hated to his dying day.
Draco clenched his jaw and looked away. "Happiness is easier to manage when it's artificial. I ran away from the only thing that ever brought me close to real happiness. I can't handle it."
“There is no problem we cannot solve, Draco,” Mother had said. “Your Father and I will make it all right.”
Potter grinned. “Sounds like we knew what we were doing last night, then.”
10 Things I Hate About Potter
"Who?"
“Three and a half.”
Draco felt the bed dip next to him, Harry's weight next to him solid and reassuring--even if neither of them knew what they were doing.
"Of course I did, Potter. I was just pretending."
, I--"
. She still had an hour until her time was up.
Draco blinked. “What?”
Harry checked his watch with a lopsided grin. “30 seconds, as promised. That’s how I wanted to kiss you back before you left.”
Do I let, it consume me?
"Me?!" Harry's body filled with white-hot indignation."I'm not the one who has explaining to do." He slammed the paper on the desk, making the furniture shake slightly.
It was a miracle that Harry'd escaped with his life, truth be told. But in the end, Voldemort had killed enough of the Order that the Light defenses dwindled. Draco'd defected early on, realizing quickly that his father was involved in a cult-like organization that no amount of prestige was worth the price of joining. Draco hadn't returned home after Sixth Year, instead being transported by a determined Harry, a wary Granger and a nearly green Weasley to Grimmauld Place.
Cori shook their head with a small, amused smile. "I'll send you a few websites. For now, just use my pronouns right and we'll be fine."
"W-wait!"
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. They gave Harry a soft smile. “I love you.”
Began with an earthquake
prank me.
Draco stood smoothly from the stool and regarded the other man, enjoying for the second time that afternoon his new height advantage over Lucius. He looked down his aristocratic nose and twisted his face into a perfect imitation of his arrogant sneer from boyhood. Harry would be proud.
The series truly is over this time...I think.
"Draco?" Harry's voice was scratchy, his throat parched.
Harry's eyebrows furrowed for a moment--before he realized how ridiculous that would look combined with a wide smile--and he moved to greet his visitor.
"You don't get it, do you?!" Malfoy spat. "If I don't do this, he will."
"Malfoy!"
And sit up now with poise
Draco pushed away his plate of food with a sigh, his stomach too knotted with anxiety to eat.
Draco was going to faint. And then he was going to murder Pansy.
Harry snorted. “Do I look happy to you, Malfoy?”
Harry didn't think, he just pulled Draco over and wrapped him in his arms, smiling when the blonde head rested on his chest.
Malfoy laughed breathily, pulling back to look Harry in the eye. "And what will you do about that, Potter?"
For the last word.
"But--aren't they your friends then?"
I picture you reading this at, oh, roughly 17 years old. You're newly Marked and starting to realize what it is your father has gotten you into, what it is you've agreed to.
They’d added a refrigerator and a few other Muggle touches to make it more accessible to Harry and surprisingly more convenient for Draco, including a television. When they’d first moved in, Harry’d had a hard time prying Draco from the television. And now, Grimmauld Place was the regular gathering spot for all Drag Race watch parties, which inevitably ended with everyone sleeping in the living room, drunk and giddy with laughter.
“Your turn now, Malfoy—assuming you’re recovered.”
But in the end, the rumors and conjecture were as outlandish as the creatures whose existence they denied. People believe and see what they want to, she’d learned, and if they chose not to see her, then who better than her to change the real world of which they were selfishly blind?
Harry breathed in sharply. "I'll try."
Harry grinned, shaking his head fondly. “Hm, maybe I’ll ask Luna, see if she has any reporter friends at the
Harry scowled, eliciting a real laugh from Draco, who moved to sit on the edge of the bed.
Draco took in the sight of a discomfited Harry Potter: a slight flush to his cheeks, white teeth fleetingly biting into a plush, full bottom lip, a hand nervously mussing up the rat’s nest on his head.
After this, he wouldn't care anymore.
He stared at the mirror, the face reflecting back at him now twisted in a scowl. He wondered how the public would feel about how he was defiling their precious, living war monument.
Draco started toward the door. He opened it and stepped through the threshold, stopping for a moment to turn his head so his face was profile to Harry.
Draco closed his eyes, kept his head turned.
They say that I’m the Chosen One
Harry raised his eyebrows. "Are you?"
Harry rolled his eyes, endlessly fond. "Let's get closer and figure it out from there."
Harry gave him a small, sheepish smile. "I was waiting for the perfect opportunity. I wanted to do this at sunset, at the restaurant, looking out over the ocean on the last night of our cruise. I thought I put the box in my pocket but I left it in my suitcase and--well, you know the rest."
As I tell you this series of facts.
"No, you don't!"
“That’s why I won’t go back. I can’t stand the silence any longer.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. "With tonight? The proposal?"
"Yeah, what'd you think? I hope it made up for me being late. I'm sure you were about ten minutes from breaking up with me," Harry said with a chuckle.
Harry froze. "What?"
Harry could only shake his head.
I know it feels as if you'll forever be defined by the last seven years, but I'm eight years past where you are now and I can say with confidence that you are so much more capable—more courageous—than you think. And it's Harry, of all people, who is going to teach you that. Let him, Draco. Let him try to show you how he sees you through his eyes. You won't believe him entirely—Merlin knows I struggle to believe it sometimes—but if he's known you at your worst and chooses to see you at your best, then perhaps you can, too.
Oh, sod it. Hi, Harry.
Potter smirked. “Who said I was still talking about the city?”
"My--what?"
Kingsley pressed his lips together and said nothing, looking at the two of them with sympathy.
"Harry, shh. Wait. Promise me."
Prompt: handle with care
Harry frowned. "Yes?"
Pansy paled. “But, that could—”
He’s lying, I never can rest!
"...that was you?"
But right now, watching Potter be with someone—conspicuous and unashamed—Draco could only feel the icy grip of regret around his heart.
Draco smirked; to think he'd used to call that man family.
Kudos and comments make my heart sing!
He looked back to find Draco silent and staring at him curiously. Harry flushed under his searching gaze.
“Hello, sir, may I help you?” Draco turned his head at the interjection to see Lyssa looking at Potter expectantly.
"...it would only require one or two dates in public, only to get people off our backs and--"
"Well, you are bisexual, right? You came out in the Prophet over the summer after your break up with Ginevra?"
Draco’s face softened. “I was planning on coming anyway. As your Auror partner, it’s my job to ensure your welfare.”
Draco smirked. “Unlike you, I wasn’t raised in a barn, so I don’t carry diseases. But we snakes do bite, so mind your place, Weaselbee.”
not pumpkin."
Harry glared at Draco underneath the cloth, hoping that his heatless scowl would be enough to portray his annoyance at being led blindly. Draco just chuckled.
“That sounds good. Do Robards and—”
Harry rolled his eyes. "I think you know me well enough to know that's not what I mean. I want to help you like a normal friend would."
“It’s a party game. You take turns saying three statements. Two of them are true and one of them is a lie, and the other players have to guess which is a lie.”
"Love, do you know how long you've been here?"
Potter answered with a smirk. The next thing Draco knew was a hand on his waist and the
"Oh! No, Merlin, I mean..." Draco's face turned red. "Not for that. I mean just to sleep."
And in the data I've collected in my mind about you, none of what I've noticed indicates that your current behavior is out of any malice or suspicion.
Another is on his chest, the choice to live.
“Father!” I stumble forward, my arm reaching out futilely to stop him but instead grasping empty air. I look at the flames swallowing the only home I’d ever known. Perhaps an
In school, he'd been a "speccy git," a "stupid tosser," a "half-blood prat," and an "idiot Gryffindor."
I started measuring time by our fights. Monday was over the dishes, Tuesday was about Ron's birthday party, Wednesday was over what your father told you at dinner, and yesterday was over how long we'd been together.
Draco recalled Narcissa reading him bedtime stories of dashing knights and magical creatures, but his favorite had been of a powerful dragon that had defended against attackers with sharp teeth and poisonous breath. Saint Martha calmed the beast into submission, and then villagers had stoned the dragon to death.
Draco nodded. "I'll get him if he cries, so you can sleep. We have a long day of driving tomorrow, don't we?"
He sighed. He deserved a firewhiskey to calm his nerves.
His ears were ringing too loudly, his eyes pressed too hard into his palms to notice footsteps entering the bathroom. He wasn't aware of another person's presence in the room until he was jerking away from a gentle touch to his shoulder.
"Am I what?"
I never chose
Teddy. Sweet, innocent Teddy whose parents and grandmother had been killed fighting to give him a better world. Harry was already a wonderful godfather, and Draco had done his part as Teddy's cousin and now caregiver, but there was only so much that two young men knew about raising a child.
Draco mimicked his petulant frown. “Aww, ickle Harry, being waited on for days by his flatmate-turned-boyfriend.”
Draco's eyes widened in understanding. He'd only heard his father grumble about drag queens when he'd had to go to Knockturn on business ventures, and he'd been taught that they were "freaks."
Harry gave him one last disgusted look before leaving the bathroom, the door slamming behind him. Malfoy’s sobs echoed against the tile walls.
It wasn't a substitute by any means. It would never replace what it was made to mimic. In some ways, it was hopelessly inadequate.
All sense of time, noise, and sight dissolved as his body and mind narrowed with the singular goal of wringing himself of all the tears he'd been forced to suppress. Even the voice of his father in his head calling him
And from my perch, my station, I got a perspective few can claim. I teetered on the edge: between Light and Dark, between Good and Evil, between Child and Adult, between Love and Hate. The line was razor-thin, sharp like my Aunt's blade yet steady like a firmly-clasped hand in mine.
Draco let out a high, keening whine and burrowed himself further into the couch. “Don’ wanna. Tired. Stay here.”
It's real, Draco. You're alive, you have friends, you're stable, and you have him. You call him Harry, but you also call him "love" and he calls you "babe" and you're thriving, together.
"Because I'm not a gourd!"
Pansy groaned. "Let's get this over with."
To Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, I leave 12 Grimmauld Place. Yes, this is for the both of you; to share, even if you're both too shy to admit you're in love with each other. Maybe this will help you both get your heads out of your arses.
“I moved here right after eighth year. I live by myself in a flat. And I have a dog.”
Harry cast several detective charms on the enormous box. The words “Handle with Care” were stamped on it in large red letters. There wasn’t a return address, making the package all the more suspicious.
But I think the world has come undone.
That earned him a scathing,
Luna had spent too much time convincing herself that the world didn’t need to believe in the magic she saw. It was their loss.
Harry took a deep breath and walked into the classroom. He waited for the stares, for the astonished gasps, for the wide eyes. But the Muggle students just saw
To Molly and Arthur Weasley, I leave all of the contents of the Potter vaults. Thank you for accepting me into your family and being the guardians I never had.
“Killing people isn’t bringing justice, Luna!”
"Water," he rasped, and Draco immediately reached onto a nearby table and placed a glass of water into Harry's free, shaking hand. It was probably from a sink in the hospital bathroom, but it was still one of the best cups of water he'd ever had, a cool relief sliding easily down his throat.
“What’s for dinner, sweetheart?”
“Since when are you polite?”
"I can't do this," he said to Ron, a month into Auror training.
“My father is buried somewhere in a potter’s field in Romania because no one was there to claim his body before I could get there,” Luna said lowly. “I can’t let his killer get away with this, Harry. Give me two days.”
But you won't miss me. How can you miss what you've never known?
Harry's heart clenched. He walked up to Draco and wrapped strong arms around him from behind, expecting to be pushed away. Instead, Draco leaned into the touch.
Draco's eyebrows knit. He shook his head. "Sorry, mum, I've never met him."
By now, walking from the subway exit to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade was hardly strenuous. And as Draco approached the railing, looking out over the black iron fence at the river and the lights of the financial district, a sense of wistfulness washed over him.
“What’s—”
and they’d left two hours later, cheeks flushed with laughter and firewhiskey.
Potter flushed a little and shook his head, sipping his water.
(See the end of the chapter for
Oh, you might've dyed your hair, changed your name, and shed your skin like the creatures under his command, his tongue, but I see you.
As part of my social reparations of the war--combined with the usual hazing endured by all Aurors fresh from training--I am given nothing but unwanted cold cases. You see, when the Boy Who Lived Twice goes missing it’s the kind of story that feeds the symbiotic relationship between law enforcement and the press. But after a while, even the Golden Boy’s whereabouts are less interesting than the newest scandal or criminal operation, fresh chum to the circling sharks.
"We're looking out for our own interests, Potter. We merely decided to speed up the process."
“Yes, I saw it shortly after I first moved to the city. I have to say, I’m surprised Ginvera picked it.”
I imagine this news is rather upsetting to you. But I have faith that you’ll recover. After all, from what I hear, you’re no stranger to grief.
"...What?"
Gods, the opening feast. He scowled, stomach twisting as he recalled the evening that should have been only celebratory but was turned into humiliation by that Potter boy. How dare he reject him?
Draco blushed. “Oh, er, it’s a word I picked up from a friend of mine. It means, basically, a long or difficult journey somewhere. For example, we’d schlep up the stairs to the Astronomy Tower.”
“Another murder?” Harry took the newspaper and read over the headline: LITTLE RED STRIKES AGAIN: NEO DEATH EATER FOUND DEAD, WRAPPED IN RED CLOAK
The bump on his nose was from Draco.
Malfoy immediately collapsed on the ground, blood seeping through his clothes. Harry watched in horror as Malfoy's chest rose and fell in shallow breaths. He ran over to Malfoy, kneeling next to him.
The only thing in the flat that you let me bring from Grimmauld Place was the clock.
"Congratulations," Harry said evenly. He walked out of the office, the sound of Draco's soft sobs echoing in the hallway.
"Hey, what're you doing out here? You'll get sick," Harry held out a hand. "Walk with me to class?"
Ron stopped talking as Malfoy turned to sneer at them.
“You’re the one who insisted on making conversation, Potter. I’m indulging you out of politeness.”
"Care to tell me what you've got hidden under your shirt?"
The knocking was louder, more impatient, and Harry groaned. “I’m coming! Merlin, Hermione.”
"You pretended to be dead--in front of one of the darkest, most powerful Wizards in history--like some sort of opossum?"
Draco felt fierce, strong. They felt invincible.
, you imbecile."
better one day.
—she left the room and—
“I’ll go with you.”
Now pipe down the noise
Harry shrugged. "Yeah, I mean we work well together when they pair Aurors with Unspeakables, and I--I like you."
Sitting down slowly, Draco nodded. "And um, I don't mean to be rude, but are you a man or a woman?"
To Neville Longbottom, I leave the Sword of Gryffindor. You're one of the bravest, most Gryffindor people I know. This should belong to you.
Just to be sure, Draco
Harry groaned, covering his eyes. "S'not my birthday."
"Yeah!"
I can’t stay here for much longer; eternity awaits.
"TAKE A WILD GUESS,
Potter sat up a little higher, his eyes flashing with excitement at the promise of a challenge. “Dare,” he said, without missing a beat.
"I sort of have feelings for you," Draco mumbled under his breath, barely loud enough for Harry to hear.
Hold on someone's knocking on my--
He let his eyes roam the crowd of students, rolling his eyes when he identified a boy with bright ginger hair. So distracted he was with applying his parents' lesson that he failed to notice the boy with messy black hair and green eyes who stood next to the Weasley.
“Somewhere Ginny picked. The Millennium Hotel.”
The first time, Harry found him in the cafe near their flat.
Based on the song "Chinese Sattelite" by Phoebe Bridgers
Potter, I knew it was you. I love you.
"Harry, let's go!"
“Do we have a list, somewhere, of where we think they each are?”
You deserve more. Your tea should be made by soft, uncalloused hands. Your bed should be warmed by people with kind eyes and clear hearts. Your flat should be full of your family and friends, brimming with love.
Also find me on Tumblr!
"Whether or not you care that your friends and loved ones have been worried about you for three years? And what—if anything—you plan to do about that?"
Draco closed his eyes, letting his head thud against the headboard and then instantly regretting it, gritting his teeth against the sharp pain. "Great. I bet Mother's furious."
"Hum guhhnuhh kuh heh wuh uh cuh tuk uguhn" Harry grumbled, crossing his arms.
If this would be an indication of what his eighth year would be, Harry wasn't sure how much longer he'd last.
Potter looked at him with amusement. "Bossy. Anyway, I brought you back here. You managed to put on your pajamas, but after that, you climbed into bed, you pulled me down. Said I was in no state to Apparate. I reminded you that I wasn't nearly as drunk as you and that I could just use the Floo, but you wouldn't take 'no' for an answer."
"Potter! Pay attention."
I hate you 'cause at first
Ron knit his eyebrows. “But she’s still a wanted criminal! What about the trial for the crimes she did commit?”
She became Little Red.
. It was artfully tousled, rather than shaggy and messy, but it was still long enough to nearly reach his eyes without obscuring his vision or bottle-green eyes. Judging by the wolf-whistles and scattered applause, it seemed their peers agreed, and Potter’s nonchalance was betrayed by the blush coloring his cheeks.
Draco strode outside, walking briskly past students milling about in the courtyard now that classes were finished for the day. He kept moving until the others were out of sight, stopping when he finally reached the Black Lake.
Draco turned to look at Potter, slowly. “You mean 'Seasons of Love'?”
Draco gazed back at Harry, and then sighed. "Potter, if we die, I'm going to kill you."
"No," Draco tugged at Harry's robes, pressing their bodies together again. "Stay."
Draco took off his reading glasses, rubbing absentmindedly over the bridge of his nose. “So, remind me again. Who have been the victims so far?”
Deceptively plush lips trailed hot kisses down Harry's neck sucking little bruises and love bites in their wake. Harry moaned, tipping his head back. He could feel Draco's smirk against his skin as he let his fangs graze across the sensitive skin there, not enough to make a dent but plenty to send tingles down Harry's spine.
Father snarls. “Don’t lie to me, boy! I knew you were acting strange. I assumed it was nerves before the wedding. Turns out you’ve had a secret little coping mechanism in your bed!”
"You set up wards on Kuragin? But Truiepets hasn't made a proper claim yet! You can't land on an empty planet and call it yours! That's a violation of intergalactic law!"
After a few weeks of itching and peeling, Harry feels satisfaction curl in his chest as he examines the back of his hand.
"Well, we missed our reservation. Cerise won't wait for more than thirty minutes."
Luna scowled, but she let Draco help his father to his feet and
"Harry."
“But I still don’t understand—why did she target former Death Eaters?” Ron’s confusion was clear on his face.
Draco nodded, not looking at the professor. He took a deep breath.
Harry shook himself. "Wait, back up--what did you say?"
I don't know how I got this lucky.
Harry had always brought out Draco’s emotions in their strongest, most concentrated form. In his youth, the jealousy, resentment, and anger were acidic on his tongue; he’d spit them into the force of his words, hoping Harry could feel it, too. Now, the love and exasperated fondness he held for Harry melted in his mouth like his favorite decadent dark chocolate: rich and satisfyingly bittersweet; he wondered if Harry could taste it on his tongue.
Draco enjoyed his life.
I hate that I can only see you at night when your name is written in the sky. I like to think that you watch over me like you said you would. Do you remember that? When you said we'd be a "proper family" together?
Rated M
But with Harry, the heat wasn’t so sweltering, the world wasn’t as suffocating, the darkness wasn’t so foreboding.
"Because we know you're trying to do better. I saw you trying to repair damaged parts of the castle. And we've seen you reading Muggle books in the library, helping first years, and you haven't said a rude word to anyone since you apologized. You're not the same person you were before the war, so we're willing to help make sure you get another chance."
I'd like to think you couldn't keep your promise, that you had no say in the matter, rather than the chance that you changed your mind.
Either way, despite my embarrassment, I find I wouldn't change a thing. Even though you drive me mad half the time, you bring out a side of me that used to be rude and angry and bitter. Now, I see that I was angry that you made me want to be a better person. I lashed out all those years because I couldn't handle the fact that you made me want to change, after being told all my life that my blood made me perfect.
“She’s on her break, for the moment, so I’m both co-owner and hostess for the moment. Will you be joining Geoffrey this evening?”
Draco kept his eyes open, let himself enjoy happiness in full color. "Okay. Together."
"I do."
Harry blinked. "Er, yeah, how'd you know?"
Hope curled in Harry’s chest for the first time in months, like the warm hug of a long-lost friend.
As it got later, Draco insisted on getting takeaway, since he had no idea how to cook and Harry wasn't willing to put much effort into anything. As they munched on fish and chips, Harry looked over at Draco, who was staring in rapt attention at the screen.
Draco bristled. “I could have one if I wanted one.”
Now, he navigates the teeming crowd, his mind hazy with memories. Beyond the fog, a star speeds across the sky.
Draco scowled. Harry laughed.
Luna raised her wand. “
I'm better, Potter. A player like you should know how to recognize talent."
And you won't miss me. Oh, you might think you do. You'll miss the dutiful, terrified, and loving son. You'll miss the boy who made you his hero. You'll miss the person I was when you liked me, the person who earned your smiles.
Harry stared into his glass, unable to find a response in the amber liquid.
Because when he's with Draco, he doesn't feel like a "freak," nor is he the "Golden Boy." He's Harry, and he's a speccy git and he's an annoying prat and an idiot Gryffindor.
"No, I did."
you are."
Harry's voice was quiet, soft.
I hate it when you're smart
"How--how did you set up a Portkey connection to an unowned planet?"
Finally, Draco sighed. “I can show you my credentials if you don’t believe me. I’m not—”
Harry let out a disbelieving scoff. "That's all you have to say to me? You didn't think I read the Prophet? What, you didn't think you'd get caught?"
I glanced at the clock warily. You noticed, you scoffed, you strode over to the clock, took it off the wall, and smashed it on the ground.
"Potter, I--" Malfoy stopped for a moment. "I'm sorry. For everything. I know that doesn't make up for--what I did, but I hope maybe I can show you that I've changed over the summer."
“Malfoy? How long have you been in there? Who did this to you?”
"Her name's Taygete," Potter had explained when Draco had stood there, gaping. "Don't, er, tell anyone about this. Hagrid lets me take her for a ride when I...need a break..." Potter's voice softens and trails off.
Harry chuckled. "Come on, Draco, cooking isn't that hard. It's just like potions, which I remember you excelling at."
Potter shrugged. “I realized I’ve basically been doing Auror work since I was 11. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in that kind of danger.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Then I'm to assume this is your doing?" he ran a finger over the collar at the cat's neck. Harry blushed.
Potter chuckled sheepishly. "Yes, tea would be great. Sorry, I really did come straight here."
"Yes, love?"
Draco turned onto his side and looked past his curtains out at the window near his bed. He wondered if he would ever be able to choose for himself, or if his life was just one more thing he inherited. The stars winked at him in the night sky, iridescent and golden.
Draco continued their easy strides toward Harry, finally reaching his lap. Harry smirked, cheekily tucking a single paper banknote into Tarasque's bra.
"Oh, Merlin, she wasn't joking," Malfoy sneered.
Voldemort clicked his tongue. “I’m afraid that’s not how this particular game will work, boy. Now, answer me.”
Draco gripped his wand, clenching his jaw as he ignored the acid leaking from his eyes.
Malfoy scowled. "Of course you can, Auror Potter to the rescue. Fortunately, I shan't be needing your heroic services today. I think I know who's to blame."
Draco let happiness bubble up in his chest, vibrant and free.
Excitement bubbled up in Draco's chest. "Er, do you think you could help me?"
"With what?" Malfoy's eyebrows furrowed.
The years passing by
Malfoy gave a little shrug. "Only one way to find out, Potter."
"If only you would use your powers of observation for discovering the cause and not the symptoms of my frustration, this conversation would be over."
Soon after, when the Dark Lord turned their home into a military base, Lucius smelled of burnt wood; the dark circles underneath his eyes would make pale eyelashes stand out against his skin as they fluttered in his sleep.
Harry scoffed, looking to Pansy for appeal.
Draco couldn't cry, so he let the sky do it for him. He shivered, soaking it up like the grass crushed under the shirt clinging to him like a second skin. He closed his eyes, imagining that the drops sliding down his face were the tears he couldn't muster, the catharsis he hadn't earned.
“But they have a whole song about love?”
Suddenly, he brings his cigarette to the fabric of the curtain, causing it to catch fire. Panicked, I freeze, unable to reach for my wand by the time the flames crept up the fabric and spread to the ceiling.
Harry’s shoulders released their tight tension. He pressed his lips against Draco’s and pulled away with a small smile. “Thank you, love.”
"Yes, Malfoy?" Harry tried not to let his annoyance show in his voice.
He took a step forward, trying to get a closer look and wishing the blonde man would turn his head even slightly from where he was dancing with a tall, fit, brunette bloke.
Your hands on my hips, the stars winking in approval above our heads, swaying to the rhythm of our beating hearts.
He was mere feet away from his bedroom door. He chanced a glance over his shoulder to make sure he hadn’t been seen. If he just—
They tell me I’m the Chosen One
No sword or shield
The implication was clear. Draco let the words reverberate, allowing the meaning to sink into his whirling mind.
“What?” said Potter from across the room, his cheeks flushed once again.
But Malfoy’s confident smirk as he sank to his knees made warmth pool in his groin, his hesitation lost to excited anticipation. Harry suppressed a groan and felt his cock twitch.
And he's also a "sappy sod," and a "fucking tease" and "my fiancé" and "the future father of our children, so you better not die today, Potter!"
"Well, I know one thing you're pretty fond of--and being around me is pretty much essential."
Because the only person able to recognize him under any disguise was currently sitting at the bar, swirling a glass of firewhiskey in his nimble hand and pinning Harry in place with familiar gray eyes.
He checks his forearm once more to make sure the glamour is still holding and, seeing Potter standing alone, adjusts the silver Colombina mask on his face and approaches him.
He froze. He didn't turn; he didn't need to.
Harry’s face fell. “You can’t be serious.”
With a turn of the keys, the engine ceased its vibrating roar. Harry put on his high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat and cast a protection charm to shield himself from the potentially toxic elements on the foreign planet. He'd learned that lesson the hard way when he'd landed on Kuragin for the first time; the noxious fumes of the uninhabited planet made him nearly lose consciousness.
"It's where your blood traitor father and mudblood mother took their last breaths to save you. Gods, they must've regretted it when they saw how you turned out. They should've handed you over to the Dark Lord when they had the chance."
**sequel of the previous chapter
Potter sighed. “Fine, but someone cast a sobering spell on you first. I’m not letting you get near me with anything sharp while you’re tipsy.”
“Er...yes?”
Lucius choked, bracing himself on the cell wall.
Harry nodded. “Does your father know? ”
So he knew that when Potter turned around, defeated, and walked back into the party, the door closing behind him with finality, that it was well and truly over.
"There are more people on your side than you think."
He refused. Patently declined. He would not deal with this...inconvenient turn of events.
"Was that sarcasm?"
"Damn it, it's too late," Harry mumbled.
For the microfic prompt "my juliana"
"I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."
"I'm not!" Draco held up his hands placatingly. "I was just wondering."
Potter’s eyebrows knit. “What? Really?”
I've always seen you, son.
Prompts: suitcase, opportunity, and sunset
He helped Malfoy undo his zipper and push down his trousers and pants, freeing his cock to bob eagerly in the air.
"Thank you, Potter," Draco whispered.
I watch Greg stumble through the Floo when he has nowhere else to turn, a cheap ale on his breath and his t-shirt rumpled. I see him grin lazily at me before he staggers wordlessly to the guest bedroom that I don't bother to ask the house elves to make up. He'll just be back again, and I let him.
Harry let out a shaky breath. “Okay, do you want to use my Floo to call Pansy?”
He didn't need to hear the cackle to confirm where the rope had come from, but it certainly squashed any doubt he might've had.
Draco's eyebrows knit. "What--are you alright?"
"What happened?" He said once he felt able to speak.
“How long have I been out?”
Draco chuckled. “If you think I’m missing work just so you wind up back in here because you restarted bleeding during sex, you’ve another thing coming.”
“Draco, a shooting star! Make a wish!”
Harry was totally fucked.
"Love, breathe, " Harry's voice was steady, patient. "Come home, alright? I have spaghetti carbonara nearly finished for you. Let's talk about it in person so I can hold you, okay?"
Song prompt: "Yeah!" by Usher
Kudos and comments make my heart sing!
Potter and his kind eyes and his extended hand and his bright smile.
Pain, blinding and sharp and burning raced through his body, his bones, his nerves. He started a new letter in his head, wishing beyond all rationality that Potter could read it.
I watch Pansy go on dates with men she doesn't care for, see her eyes linger a little too long on women in tight dresses. I watch her acquiesce to her parents' attempts to see her married and settled, and I watch her clench her jaw when her suitors' hands grip her waist a little too tight or their rough mouths attach to hers without warning. She always unfolds for them, lets her body go limp. It seems submissive; I know it's calculated.
Harry whirled around, heart racing. "What--oh, Draco," Harry couldn't help the giggle that escaped him.
"Who knows? Maybe we'd have been friends back then."
"What—Malfoy, I’m going to get someone, you probably don’t have much time, just—”
Harry didn't need to be told twice. He grabbed Malfoy's hips and spun him around, bringing Malfoy’s arse against his crotch and his back against his own chest.
“Don’t stop,” came a whisper from plump, bitten lips. Draco looked down into wide, pleading green eyes and did the only thing he could.
And I promise to do all of this for as long as I can, as long as you let me. And if you do--if you promise to love me for the rest of our lives--I promise to do the same. Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?"
But I stay. I haunt. I hope.
me; you didn't save me from the fire only for me to drown myself in you.
"It doesn't matter what I think of you."
"But you lied for me, too. You pretended you didn't know me, in the Manor."
"Potter, would you stop distracting from the issue at hand?"
You walk outside, letting your eyes adjust to the lack of light around you. As you walk to your usual alleyway, you don't look back to make sure he's coming; you know he is. This is how it works, how it always has and always will.
harry moves his tongue just so, knowing that the quiver of His thighs precedes imminent come pulsing down his throat. harry licks the cock clean before it is tucked back into His trousers.
He shuffled awkwardly away and into the club, his breath catching at the crowd of people dancing en masse in the middle of the dance floor. Harry wondered if it was accurate to call what they were doing "dancing;" it was more like dry-humping, with arses pressed against groins and hands on hips and groans drowned out by the heart-pounding music.
Angst. Written for my lovely friend
It seemed enough for Potter, who smiled and turned back around on Taygete's back, allowing Draco to reassume his position behind him.
Potter winced. “Sorry.”
“Try me.”
The students stood, gathering their materials into their bags. At the desk in front of Draco, the Weasel was rambling about some nonsense that caused Potter to laugh, revealing one of his dimples. It made Draco’s stomach flip in ways he had learned to actively ignore over the past three years.
Tell me what’s mine.
Draco swallowed, but he didn’t look away. “We’ll see about that.”
Luna’s throat tightened. “He didn’t.”
"Shh, shh," Harry knelt next to Draco and wrapped the shaking boy in his arms, rubbing his back in soothing circles. "You're alright. Take your time."
“Of course, I can change it if you don’t want him to, Harry,” Luna gave Potter a placid smile. “But with the way you’ve been staring at him all evening, I thought you’d be rather excited.”
Draco blinked his eyes open. He reached up to let a strong, calloused hand grasp his own and pull him up and onto a broom.
"Because you're alive, Harry!" Draco said, slightly exasperated. "You're alive and you're here against all odds, and those shit-for-brains relatives of yours never celebrated that so I'm going to, damn it."
Malfoy nodded again. He took the wand from Harry’s hand, closing his eyes. Harry let in a sharp breath at the sight of a soft smile on Malfoy's lips as he reunited with his wand. The image was more compelling than Harry imagined, as evidenced by the butterflies that filled his stomach.
Luna turned to look at him, pride shining in her eyes. “Thank you, Dad, really—” she paused to remove the scarlet cloak from around her shoulders, letting her fingers linger over the fabric. “But I’m the lucky one.”
Harry thought about this. The way Draco brings home treacle tart and leaves it in the refrigerator for Harry. The way he silently, wordlessly draws a bath for him when it's clear Harry's had a long day. The way he factors in twice-monthly dinners with Ron and Hermione and Sunday dinner at the Burrow, despite his discomfort. The way he gets up before Harry every day to get the Prophet and throw away every article with his name in the headline or his picture in the columns.
Draco's whispered, "Yes," was nearly lost in the warm, soft lips that met his.
It was time.
Malfoy paled. “Stop calling me that," his quiet voice trembled.
"We know what you did, Draco."
Losing my mind
Harry shrugged. “I try to use my energy to eat. Not much left for calling a Mind Healer.”
But tonight, Harry’s mind was far away from the warm timbre of his boyfriend’s voice, the gentle scratches against his scalp.
Draco nodded before turning away, stopping when Potter reached out and grabbed his arm.
He handed the quill back to the woman, who placed it in her drawer. "I'll be right back." She left and disappeared into another room.
"Which is?"
Ah, of course. The best part and least expected part of Draco's family: Harry.
Silence.
Not when Harry brought him bagels from the shop next door on the weekends.
Harry shook his head. "Flatmates don't do that—disappear for three hours after a fight without saying where they’ve gone."
and her friends all speculated on the identity of the vigilante. She made sure not to mention the figure in the
Harry's heart melted a little. "Draco..."
You just had to have the last word, didn't you?
Draco stood, stunned, until he felt someone bump his shoulder.
"Potter--"
Once on the street, he leaned up against a nearby wall and cast a privacy charm. He took out his mobile, listening to it ring against his ear.
It's a shadow of its former self, the disapproving sneer that had crossed Father's face as Draco left for the evening. He wasn't sure whether it was the eyeliner, tight black jeans, or crop top that was stoking his Father's disgusted ire this time.
You wouldn't have it any other way. Because any other way, you wouldn't have it at all.
"I didn't know there were payphones in Kyoto."
"Potter. I told you to call me Harry, remember? On our second date."
—dingy motel room and mark off another box on his calendar.
"Thank you, Draco."
"Potter, I don't care that you're in Kyoto and sorry. You could be in Moscow and hungry, or in Paris and tired, or in New York and happy. Not my problem."
“Says the man who decided case reports weren’t worth his time.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. Pansy gave him a quick wink before turning back to Potter.
Malfoy tipped his head slightly. “Thank you, Potter.”
Draco smirked. “Not likely.”
Before, the idea of facing Voldemort head-on, once and for all, seemed like something abstract, yet inevitable. He'd known on some level since fourth year that it would come to this, but with all the sleepless nights and odd meetings with Dumbledore and finding out about the prophecy last year, it was becoming increasingly clear that only he or Voldemort would come out of the war alive. Before, the idea of taking a life, of killing someone, was so abhorrent and unthinkable that Harry had never let himself come to terms with the possibility.
Potter cleared his throat. “Okay, it’s my turn. Luna, truth or dare?
“Just because they weren’t in the inner circle doesn’t mean they just stood around. Sometimes, it was the minor players that did the most damage because no one was looking at them.” Draco’s eyes glazed over slightly, and his expression was faraway.
Harry woke with a gasp, sweat beading on his forehead. A hand scrubbed over his face as he wiped the sleep from his eyes and felt his four-poster ground him to reality.
“Apologize!”
"It's fine--I'm just tired of people taking my food preferences as a personal insult."
“But we’re acting as if it has!” Luna scoffed. “We’re all pretending like the only survivors of the war were people who knew better. Do you really think everyone on the Light side was accepting? You don’t have to be a Death Eater to be bigoted. But there are Death Eaters out there, and I think they’re plotting to take advantage of that!”
“Voldemort. My father. Take your pick.”
And they acted like jerks
Potter nodded. “I can understand that. It’s an amazing city. But I will say—you were wrong about one thing.”
You put your hand on my shoulder. You squeezed it gently and you said, "No matter where I am, I'll always be with you, right here," and you patted that spot on my shoulder with your warm, calloused hand.
But more than anyone else in his life, Draco had the most names for him.
Panic twisted in Draco's stomach. And he and Potter....?
Luna frowned. “I am sorry, it wasn’t my intention.” She bent to kiss him lightly on the cheek and walked to the kitchen, putting down the groceries she’d brought to cook for the night.
The Dark Lord calls me his, but I'm irrevocably, entirely yours.
"Why?"
Unlike Dudley, he hadn't spent Christmas Eves and the hours before his birthdays anticipating presents and sweets. He'd never had anything to look forward to, nothing to keep him up at night in anxious glee.
"Sure," Malfoy cleared his throat and stuck his hands in his pockets. "I'll, er, be going then."
The point is, magic can be purposeless, and yet it has the audacity to remain.
But there must be some mistake
Draco scoffed. "We both know you're pants at healing spells. Come on, show me."
Harry grinned. "Exactly! Alright, now that the water is boiling, we add the pasta." Harry reached for the open box of spaghetti, removed the lid from the pot, and poured the dry noodles into the water.
He smirked. "Come closer, Draco. Let me see you."
Draco's head pounded in protest as he forced his eyes open against the streaming sunlight. He raised a feeble arm to defend against it, squinting and using the other hand to rub the sleep from his face.
Steadfast and convinced of their hate.
"Are you alright?" Harry would have almost laughed at the look of genuine concern on Malfoy's face if he wasn't on the verge of tears.
Harry knew a bully when he saw one, and during that moment, he couldn't pretend it had been Malfoy.
Potter’s face crumpled slightly. “Thanks. Sorry to have wasted your time, Malfoy.”
He lifted his wand and looked down at himself with a feral grin. "See you in a century, Harry," he said, lifting his wand and watching as the dirt poured over the body, trapping it beneath the earth.
“No, Draco, we’ve got to go home,” Harry walked up to the couch. His breath caught when gray eyes blinked wide and pleadingly up at him.
Draco bit his lip. “What if I’m not…enough for you,” his voice was quiet, making Harry’s tiny flat seem huge.
"Feeling a bit vain, are we?"
A pale hand extended.
Malfoy smirked. “Unlike you, I wasn’t raised in a barn, so I don’t carry diseases. But we snakes do bite, so mind your place, Weaselbee.”
But this—this was his opportunity to show Potter, and himself, how much he’d changed, how his inherited arrogance became hard-earned pride. Potter would go back to London bewildered and in awe of his weekend––not from the rush of the city, but because he’d spent it with Draco.
I don't know how long it's been since you left. It's been some amount of seconds, minutes, and hours. I can't count time anymore. I stopped trying.
"Look at me."
They kissed and kissed and kissed, with Draco coaxing little grunts from Potter with every pull of his hair and swipe of his tongue. He didn’t care about the whispering from the other students, or Pany’s peal of laughter, or Granger’s knowing stare at his back.
Draco looked at him with sharp gray eyes. "I never lied to you about being scared to come out."
Luna flung open the curtains and watched his eyes widen in shock.
Voldemort glared—or he would’ve if his eyes weren’t already snake-like slits. “And see, here I thought you might want to spend your final moments playing a little game.”
Hermione pressed her lips together, looking guiltily between Harry and Ron before she finally sighed. "Oh, I'm sorry Harry, but it's for your own good!" She leaned in cupping her hand around Ron's ear as she whispered, "The only way to end the spell is for him to kiss Malfoy."
Finally, Draco must've been satisfied enough to stop them. "Alright, you can look."
Pansy groaned. “Can you two please stop doing that weird, coupley, silent communication thing?”
"I know just—" Draco burrowed his head further into Harry's chest. "Stay. Just a little while longer."
"How do you know that?"
But then again, when has it ever?
A knock on the door registered in Harry's tipsy mind. When he rose from his seat on the couch, he found himself much less inebriated than he'd thought. That would have to change once he sent the visitor away from his doorstep.
“Well? Draco, are you going over there or not?” Pansy’s smile was sharp.
"Okay," Harry whispered, pressing a kiss onto Draco's head. "I'll stay."
“You know you’re keyed into the wards, git. And you have my Floo!”
"Here you are!" The woman handed the bundle into arms that Draco hadn't realized he'd offered. He took the baby carefully, grinning at Harry briefly before looking down at the new owner of his heart.
But with Harry, he could be his truest self, letting his love and happiness bubble up erupt within him, reckless and free.
Turning his face blank, he gave Potter a sharp, robotic nod, and spun on a heel. He should’ve run away when he’d had the chance.
She smiled. "I'm Healer Rostova. Press that pager if you need something, but otherwise, I'll be back in a little while." With that, she left the room, the door clicking softly behind her.
"That's the spirit," Harry murmured, turning toward the ghost. "Alright, grab your stick!"
Harry pitied the living; he pitied those who feared the bliss of a bite, the thrill of being the prey; and now he pitied himself.
"This is amazing! I made this?"
"I suppose I get why you'd want to live somewhere other than Potter Cottage. The scene of the crime, isn't it?"
She heard the groaning more clearly and sensed it coming from what appeared to be the bedroom. She stalked toward the bedroom door and opened it, letting it creak.
Harry smiled and reached into his pocket only to find it terrifyingly empty.
Prompt: break the silence
Draco’s hands were shaking. “My f-father. He’s—the wards of the Manor—I was going to go alone, but then I thought to get you, and—”
Harry just chuckled. "That you do, Draco, that you do."
Once they reached a clear spot on the sidewalk, Draco stopped Potter.
And he gives me his Floo address.
Potter grinned, sharp and wicked. “You’re not the only one who knows the bed-warming benefits of cocks and arses.”
Narcissa frowns in confusion. "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, I haven't seen Draco since Friday afternoon. Can I pass along a message for you?"
Harry opened the door.
"Harry."
“Anything I can help with?”
“Can you look at me now, Harry?”
Never let it be said that Harry Potter does things halfway.
"Not at all, Mr. Potter. Good evening."
His blood raced with anxiety and anticipation as he turned to look at Draco meaningfully. Draco narrowed his eyes in suspicion and then shook his head rapidly.
Perhaps tears burn in punishment when you don't deserve their healing.
"I said I think we should date."
At first, receiving the Dark Lord’s task had been an honor. Mother and Aunt Bella were constantly reminding him of his role in restoring the Malfoy name, now that Father was disgraced, and Draco had swelled with pride.
No, Harry would endure almost any physical discomfort if it meant Draco would keep talking until he was out of breath. Until he ran out of words.
He rose to his feet on slightly wobbly legs—from the firewhiskey and absolutely nothing to do with the way his stomach was churning with nerves—and moved to kneel behind Potter. The other boy was stiff, his back muscles tight with tension even through his t-shirt. Draco wondered whether Potter could use a back massage as well—
"No, but I am your friend. And your flatmate. And I don't want to be worried sick for three hours when you fuck off to Merlin knows where because you're feeling pissy!" Harry snapped, letting his anger creep into his voice.
Harry blinked. He needed a drink.
It's a small story in the Prophet. The kind of thing in the back corner of a paper Harry never reads, anyway. He only saw it because someone had left the paper on the counter in the breakroom flipped open to the society section.
Potter cleared his throat. “Well, er, I’ll see you around, Malfoy,” he said, nodding one final time before turning to leave.
Draco stepped outside and the newly repaired door clicked gently behind him. Harry stared after him, and then at the piece of paper in his hand.
Draco tried to find indignation or annoyance, but there was none. Instead, he found something unnamable, yet vaguely familiar.
That was a beautiful ceremony, wasn't it? It's nice to see that Hogwarts would mourn even its more nefarious students.
When you wake, there's a cup of tea waiting for you under a
"No, we're not." Draco turned to look into bright, hurt green eyes. "You can't expect me to concede to your vision of what our relationship should be. You wanted to break up, and that's fine. But I don't need to give you absolution for the shitty way
. Shut up.
Luna whirled around to see Harry in full battle mode. His jaw was clenched, and his eyes were shining with some inscrutable emotion. Behind him, Draco stood looking between her and Lucius in disbelief.
When he lifted the flaps, he stepped back in shock.
He fumbled with the room key, cursing under his breath when it slipped from his nervous fingers. It finally opened and he stumbled in, almost falling on the rug.
"You know, Harry, for once, I think we finally are."
Harry loved the sound of Draco’s voice.
Finally, he rose from the ground and brushed the dust from his robes just as the trio turned to run off into the night. He watched them leave, even as Potter turned around to glance back at Draco.
Draco cleared his throat. "Like I said, don't be. We made different choices."
"We'll be alright, Draco, I promise," Harry whispered into Draco's hair, kissing the top of his head.
He had discovered some very important information, too. He knew how Potter’s cheeks flushed a bit when he laughed. He knew how Potter grinned and stood a little straighter after he mastered a spell in Defense. He knew how to tell if Potter was anxious by how much he ran his fingers through his truly disastrous hair. He’d all but memorized how much brighter Potter’s green eyes were when he was confident—and even more so when he was angry. Sometimes, Draco liked teasing Potter just so he could see those glinting eyes trained on him; so that he could have an excuse to look at them, to sink into them.
“He said
. Lyssa, thank you for your encouragement, beta skills, brainstorming help, and support. Everyone, go check out her Tumblr. She's crazy talented.
While I wait, I like to watch the tables and chairs be filled and emptied, changing like the tide. The diligent waitstaff cleans each surface in between seatings; the crumbs are swept up and tabletops are covered with starch-white cloths. My own table is littered with shards of glass and stained with tears and alfredo sauce and the traces of passing time.
"Is that really who you think I am?"
Harry stepped out onto the Quidditch field, broom in hand and face set in determination. At the blow of the whistle, he kicked off, already searching for the tiny, fluttering Snitch.
Someone stood over him, muttering something that sounded like his name. but his brain was slow to process the image and accompanying sound of the person's voice.
Harry'd never considered the sound of his own blood before; Draco said it was like listening to a rushing waterfall on a scorching day, coaxing you to just dip one toe into the precarious but cool waters.
Harry walked over to the pot and removed the lid, which Draco must have put back on over the pasta, causing it to boil over. When the water calmed down, Draco looked at Harry with wide, curious and slightly shaken eyes. "What--what did I do?"
Kudos and comments make my heart sing!
"Then why don't you say it to me? Why don't I get to know how you feel?"
Pansy calls late at night. I hold back my wince at the sight of her red-rimmed eyes and puffy cheeks. She makes up a story of some man who'd run from her bed, but I know she sheds tears over the nightmares that won't leave it.
"It's like a small cauldron," Draco mused.
His suitcase.
Harry just shrugged. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Always so responsive," Draco's voice was husky. "Can you be good for me? Let me take what I need?"
“Five”
But if Malfoy hadn't hated him before, he certainly did now, and Harry couldn't blame him.
From the arms of a friend
harry thought that heartache would be a good enough distraction from grief, but at this point, he's forgotten the difference; he's not sure there is one.
“Home,” Draco said softly, and affection spread through Harry’s chest.
"McGonagall, Hermione, Luna—even Ron, when Hermione lectures him long enough. And, y'know. Me."
"Draco?"
"Er, mate? What's going on?" They stopped at Ron's voice.
Draco let out an affected sigh. "Well, I'd better be off. I'm running late to meet Harry. I suppose I'll have to find some way to make it up to him..." He winked at Lucius and walked away, moving through the hallway and past the guards to the exit.
I suppose that's the point of this letter. Here I am, reflecting on what I wish I could tell you, past Draco, about yourself. The things I see in you—in us. The future we have.
I want to thank you, really. You’ve been doing my work for me. I always intended to get revenge on them for how they treated me—like I was a dog.
Suddenly, Malfoy rose on shaking legs and walked over to Harry, who quickly stood to meet him in the middle. Harry regarded him with a tight-lipped smile.
I wonder whether Robards thought he was torturing me by giving me your case; perhaps he decided it would be a proper punishment for me to spend my days looking at your scarred face in your file and coming up with ways to find you. If I succeeded, I’d be helping a former rival; if I failed, I’d be proving all their assumptions that I’m either nefarious or rich and lazy, take your pick.
"Right. So where's the doctor?"
Luna sipped her tea, shaking her head. “I’m sorry, Harry, I don’t know anybody at the Prophet.”
When he's not studying like mad for his NEWTS in hopes of a semi-decent future, he spends much of his time walking. And brooding. Alone.
I look between both ends of the cave. I know the darkness, cowered within it. Potter's smile shines with foreign promise.
“Tell me everything you know about Fenrir Greyback.”
At Draco's challenge-filled look, Harry pulled him in quickly, wrapping him in his arms.
You wait until the world outside is blanketed in darkness, where the two of you can hide what you do, how you feel. When you're certain that the interrogative spotlight in the sky has sunk westward, you move toward the door without looking at him, hoping his eyes are following the lines of the suit you wore just for him. The first time you'd had it on around him, he'd been reckless enough in his want for you that he'd sent you the signal to meet him outside as the sun was setting--before the darkness had settled.
Draco shook his head and smirked. "No, Harry," he raised the glass of wine to his lips. "I'd never do that."
"He's perfect," Harry breathed, gently stroking Scorpius's head. The baby turned his piercing eyes on Harry and giggled, and Draco wanted to bottle this moment—the sound, the smile, the tears in his and Harry's eyes, the joyful ache of his chest—for eternity.
. He set a timer on his wand for seven minutes, planning to use the last three to dry off and head to his last class of the day. But for now, he could drift a little longer.
"No, we're alive. Messy," Harry shook gunk off of his left hand, "but alive."
Harry closed his eyes. Then he sighed and opened them again. “Luna, I have to arrest you.”
Harry managed to huff through his nose, which was the closest thing to a laugh he'd managed in days. He reached for the box of cookies that sat next to him on the coffee table and took a bite of the last chocolate chip one, now room-temperature having been sitting out for an hour since Hermione's owl had delivered them after he'd told her the news.
“But Harry, they haven’t got a chance! Look, the Cannons--”
I hate your stupid face
Harry faltered, grasping nothing as he searched for an excuse. Draco smirked as he noticed Harry’s conclusion.
Why are they assuming
Harry looked up in surprise to see a boy with white-blonde hair standing in front of him.
He landed in Draco's office with a pop, making the other man startle almost violently.
All the lights of Times Square were dull in comparison to Potter’s grin.
Harry startled, turning to look at Draco, who was raising an eyebrow.
Lucius’s reddened cheek twitched with his scowl. “I already told you, I haven’t seen Fenrir in years!”
"Hello to you, too, Orion. And you, Diana. Any idea where Harry is? No? I'm talking to two dogs who can't respond to me? And I've lost the plot? Okay, good, good," he said with a wry grin as he gave loving scratches and pets to the greedy dogs.

Draco grinned at Harry. “Harrryyy!!! Come to join the party?”
He cast a
Love was slow, subtle and inconspicuous—and then it was all-consuming. And frighteningly easy.
DRACO
A new fear suddenly clenched in his chest. He was such an idiot. The moment Taygete touched the ground again, the Aurors would swarm and arrest him, because surely he was violating the terms of his parole. And Potter would merely be seen as the victim of Draco's attempted kidnapping, or nefarious manipulation.
The pounding at Harry’s door was incessant to the point that he knew he could no longer ignore it. With a sigh, he threw the covers off his body, resenting the chill that hit his legs and vowing to return to his cocoon as soon as the interloper had fled his wrath.
You're welcome, Draco.
"It's the truth."
Thank you both for being the best friends I could've asked for. I hope you have the happiness and life you deserve.
“Perhaps you were too busy in Potter’s bed to notice, but your mother’s bag has been packed since yesterday.”
Harry allowed himself an indulgent grin. "You just like seeing more of Sharpay."
“Yes, I know, Father. You may have mentioned that a few
It rolled off Draco's tongue more easily than it should've for a boy his age. His blood raced as he felt the hatred eat away at the last glowing embers of love he had for Potter, righteous and furious.
Harry closed his eyes and thought about a future of gray eyes, slow kisses, and a lifetime of surprises.
And I hope you don't mind if I believe in you, too.
"Bring it on, Potter."
Draco huffed harshly, causing one of the locks of his hair on his face to flutter in the air before falling back onto his forehead. "Well, Harry, not everyone is quite as forgiving as you."
, as Draco had called it, had been a flash in the pan, in retrospect. It was a quick but enormous, blazing fire that threatened to swallow them both; Harry was willing to burn, but Draco extinguished it before Harry's skin could be more than warmed by the flames.
But it was all he had: just the potion and his memories. If Draco's mind insisted on torturing him by reliving the best moments of his life in sepia-toned images, at least this way he could delay the crushing reality a little while longer.
There, lingering and present.
Harry huffed. "You won't get away with this. Hogwarts won't let you. I won't let you."
“Thanks for letting me borrow it,” Harry said, his voice quiet.
Draco let out a shaky sigh, looking at Harry with hopeful eyes as he nodded. “Okay, you’re right. I’m worried for nothing.”
“Malfoy?”
"How long d'you reckon she'd stay here and write if no one stopped her?" Ron muttered.
"No thank you."
I wonder if my hair still gleams in the firelight, or if the dust has dulled that, too. I wonder if you'd like this—the way my heart, my body, my love have been preserved for you as if under a
"Sorry, pumpkin."
"Here I am."

"So, are you really not going to go for the apprenticeship?" Harry asked, eager to bring his complexion back to normal.
His seventh and eighth-year peers were sitting in a large circle and guffawing—likely over some scandalous reveal or embarrassing moment that had occurred in the weekly bonding night.
“Dare.”
, he’d been so close.
“What?”
"How many galleons have you converted to Muggle American money?"
Harry had a lot of hope.
“Of course.” Luna took another step.
it's in the safe cover of night that he lets his inhibitions slip from his practiced grip.
Harry ran reverent, trembling fingers over the grooves. "How did you find this? And--" realization dawned on him, and he looked up at Draco in shock. "Wait, how did we get here? You can't Apparate into Hogwarts!"
Prompt: whispers, breaking the silence
Draco waved a hand. "I might've embellished a little, but that would be the underlying message. So, as I said, it's a waste of time to even consider it."
Harry wanted to see if he could make it run down Malfoy's face.
"What'd they do?"
Draco scowled. “There’s no need to sound so surprised, Potter, I do have skills.”
“Don’t care. Get in here, he’s on my couch.” She turned and walked away purposefully, and Harry trailed behind her.
“I’ll be alright. But come closer, Lucius. Let me see you. The curtains are too thick, and I can’t reach my wand to open them.”
“Natalie. She works with me at the Kitchen.”
Draco looked in the mirror, gray eyes sharp with a newly ignited fire.
But at night, it's your bed he stumbles into with flushed cheeks as you pull little grunts from between his lips. He likes your hair, the way it gleams in the moonlight. He likes touching you, fucking you in the dark, where the world is draped in shadows; it's easier to suck cock when you can pretend you can't see it. He likes to feel you, more than see you.
“Hmm. I’ll guess that you’re lying about not returning to London.”
, Draco thought.
Draco and Harry had taken pains to renovate Grimmauld Place when they’d moved in together. The two of them stripped the house of its dreary and depressing decor, and Draco had been absolutely giddy to remove the nasty old portraits in the house, weeding out the ones they no longer cared for by completing the task in full drag. Any relatives that spared Draco anything more negative than a genuinely curious expression found themselves quickly stripped of their place on the wall.
and he casts a quick
Potter nodded. “Sure, Malfoy.”
Harry frowned. "I'm not running, I'm...nomadic."
Draco huffed and glanced down at the page open in his notebook, which he realized with a jolt of anxiety was completely blank of notes. He looked up to see if he could quickly get down anything Flitwick had written on the board, but the professor had just cast the cleaning charm, the words fading away into oblivion.
charm; cream and far too much sugar, just the way you like it.
“Who’s Geoffrey?”
Without thinking, Harry started walking toward him, an animated Ron following along.
And don’t think I don’t know who you are, either. I put two and two together soon after you put Bellatrix behind bars. You had tears in your eyes when we took your red cloak in Malfoy Manor. Thanks for that, by the way; your mother’s stitching was impeccable, and it’s rather freezing in that house, isn’t it?
The sound of traffic was muffled in the background.
Another step. “I’m sorry to hear that.”
"We'll figure this out together, Draco," Harry whispered as they both gazed up at the sleepy, twilight sky. "We're a team, you and me."
Harry let himself glance over to the figure at the back of the bar. Draco wore a muggle suit just to drive Harry mad, everything perfectly tailored to his lithe form. Draco smirked, his lip curling slightly to reveal one of his sharp fangs, a promise for more. A quirk of a blonde eyebrow was all Harry had to see to know it was time.
"So? I haven't done laundry in a while."
"Draco," Harry held up a hand. "It's alright. Thank you for coming over."
Well, considering that I have recently accepted the fact that we belong to this classification, I think this exercise is all the more prudent, even according to our old standards.
Draco tossed and turned with a frown, eventually pulling the drapes closed around his bed to shield himself from the world for a few hours more.
Draco inhaled sharply, sucking in his lip. Slowly, he knelt back onto the ground, this time closer to Harry. "Then what do you want to be?" If they weren't so close, Harry wouldn't have heard him speak.
"For what? For courting a woman while dating me in secret, feeding me bullshit about being afraid to come out? Or that your well-placed ad got to me before you could?"
Her chest clenched. “Hi, Harry.”
"Hi Draco, I'm Silver." said someone with red lipstick and short black hair cut in a bob that reminded him of Pansy.
“So, where do we start?” Ron said with a resigned sigh.
You were always better, with me.
“No.”
"Turn That Frown Upside-Down!" the cheery slogan was written in optimistic, curvy letters. "After the war, you'll grin like never before, with the Smiling Serum!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy was crying again, trembling. “P-please, just let me—”
"We've been getting on this year, no?"
“He was killed. It was a warning from one of the Death Eaters, telling me to stay away.”
Draco's breath caught as he finally took in his surroundings. They were standing on a balcony in Paris, confirmed by the sight of La Tour Eiffel in the distance. The lights of the city twinkled like stars below them. On the balcony were two chairs and a small table with hot food under a stasis charm. A bottle of wine and two glasses sat ready for them. Draco checked the label and confirmed with a gasp that it was a 1989 Chateau Lafleur.
Draco's jaw clenched. "I thought I could tell you myself."
When you wake, there's a cup of tea waiting for you under a Stasis charm; cream and far too much sugar, just the way you like it.
But now, I spend my days in my Junior Auror office, which is blessedly empty since no one wanted to work with the former Death Eater. Solitude suits me just fine, a sentiment which, I would wager, you share. Funny, how we are connected by a tolerance, or even enjoyment, of isolation.

“Lovegood, I am telling the truth! I haven’t seen Greyback since the end of the war.”
And he apologizes.
"Draco, look at me."
Draco let himself be pulled up and canceled the alarm on his wand. As they walked, he took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Potter entwined their fingers, anchoring him to the ground.
"Yes, yes, 'Oh Smart One.' So surely if you can manage potions you can figure out how to cook! It's basic chemistry!"
"That definitely won't help me focus."
