“You shouldn’t,” Draco snapped.
—then said, a smirk colouring his words, “Call me incredible again.”
Harry gasped in faux-outrage, kissed Draco deeply—fuck, how were his lips so
I grunt. My thighs burn from the effort of pounding into him, but his reactions are more than worth it. Fuck, I’ve missed sex. I’ve missed the feel of it, the noises of it, the smell of it, everything. I’ve missed being able to make another person feel this fucking good.
“As you can see,” he said to Harry calmly, “I am not currently available for a drop-in session. Please remove yourself from my office and come back at our scheduled time.”
“Oof, good one. I was gonna say Filch.”
Malfoy hesitated. “The memory of the moments before our duel,” he said. “With–” A stiff gesture to his left arm. “It would be understandable if that is a problem.”
Potter pulls back and gazes into his eyes for a long, hot, moment, then – without looking away for a second – pushes Draco backwards.
That got Harry’s attention. “Homework?”
“Absolutely I can,” Malfoy said loftily. “Especially when you didn’t tell me before now that you abandoned your support network at a key stage in your recovery.”
Malfoy frowned. “Why the Leaky Cauldron?”
The minute stretches. Draco knows he’s seconds away from waking up on his own bed, cold and sticky and uncomfortable. He braces himself for the snap back to reality.
Harry tightened his grip on Malfoy’s jaw and attacked him, teeth and tongue and lips biting and licking and kissing. Malfoy – who had been so calm and still while Harry was questioning him – burst into life, the book landing on the floorboards with a
“Hmm,” Malfoy says in mock thought. He settles against Harry. “I think you could stand to be trained up for another few months. If you can cope with the hardship.”
“Shit,
“I can’t believe we just did that.” Malfoy’s voice was awed.
“Don’t worry,” Malfoy said. “This will take some getting used to. Take your time. Does anything feel strange? Different to what you’d expect a library to feel like?”
, that feels so good.”
Draco’s name and Draco’s cock throbs so violently that for a second he thinks he’s actually coming.
“So.” Something like pain tugged at Malfoy’s thin mouth. “I haven’t seen you in Auror robes since I became your Healer, have I?”
“Harry! I didn’t – So sorry I didn’t stop by earlier – I was just checking to see if you were here so I could apologise.”
Harry’s chest squeezed. “It’s still me,” he said. He reached out a hand to Malfoy without thinking. Malfoy strode forwards and almost took it, before he thought better of it. He coughed.
,” Malfoy says. Harry is still working Malfoy’s cock. Malfoy raises a hand to grasp Harry’s shoulder and Harry has his mouth on Malfoy’s wrist before Malfoy can draw his next shuddering breath. Malfoy’s pulse quivers against Harry’s lips. Harry whines.
Ron didn’t look up from the Detonator when Hermione sat next to him, but he turned his head to accept her kiss on the cheek.
“It’s hardly advanced Arithmancy,” Draco scoffs, but even so, it’s Harry who makes the first move. He reaches out. Draco steps forward to catch his fingers.
Harry licks a broad, hot stripe up the underside of my cock. I choke.
Malfoy didn’t move. He stood silhouetted against the window, staring out at the darkening orange sky. He looked…helpless.
The jumbled puzzle pieces in my head clunk into place, forming an impossible picture. My face burns.
Malfoy snorted. “I’ve never heard it described so eloquently. Usually I’m told my mental presence evokes the scent of a spiced Earl Grey tea.”
Harry swore and knocked over his third cup of tea in his haste to get up. Merlin knew what the goons in MLE had done with his suspects in his absence. He’d assumed they’d be locked up for a few hours and he’d be able to question them while they were still shocked from the arrest. Now they’d had more than a day to think of alibis and excuses.
“Malfoy,” Potter says weakly, his fingertips hardening to nails against Draco’s scalp, and the sound shoots through Draco, sends heat rushing down his spine. In one swift movement, Draco yanks down Potter’s underwear. Potter’s prick is thick and pink and hard – and hardens further under Draco’s greedy gaze.
He lets out a breath of laughter and starts to rock his hips. I squeeze his cock but bite my lip to stop myself reacting further—the moment feels too fragile to ruin with a groan of pleasure.
Rating: T
“Me?” he says, eyes alight. He locks his fingers together under his chin and leans forward. “Do tell.”
Harry obligingly sucked at Draco’s earlobe, nipping gently. “You were saying?” he murmured. “You’re thinking of Ron?”
Draco’s eyes rake down Harry’s body to his crotch, where Harry’s own cock has not yet got the memo that now is not a good time.
With a monumental effort, Harry lifted himself onto his knees, separating their bodies. He rested his forehead on Draco’s heaving chest.
Harry thrust against him one last time, then rolled sideways onto the bed. Draco made a noise of protest and turned to follow him, but Harry pressed him back against the pillows with a firm hand to his chest.
working – though, to be fair, he’s shaking so much he’s surprised he can even hold the damn wand.
“I’m going to fuck you
“It’s a memory thing,” Harry clarified, gesturing at his head. “Sorry. I get it if you don’t want to talk about work.”
“Yeah,” Draco agreed, nodding. His long hair fell over his shoulders, into his face. “God, you feel –
“Self-important dickhead.” The correction is instinctive.
“Oh, fuck.”
nobody that could take over. It had to be him, and he had to get it done soon. Lives were at stake.
“Did you mean it? Did you mean what you said?”
Harry inhales sharply and jerks his head up. Draco is watching him carefully, his eyes bright even in the dim light. “Oh my god. Are you suggesting—?”
Harry stabbed at his pie. “I mean, I know that sort of thing isn’t a priority right now. But it would’ve been nice to know.” He thought about Malfoy’s long ink-stained fingers running slowly over the spines of books on a dusty bookshelf. The curly-haired Muggle leaning against the wall of the Chelsea Physic Garden. The hint of promise in the dark-eyed stranger’s smile.
“That’s no reason to go behind his back—”
talking about, Malfoy?” Harry retorted, glaring.
“Oh, yes?”
I look down at him. At his pointy, pale, ratty face. He holds my gaze under half-lowered eyelids. Deliberately licks his lips.
For all Draco’s protests, he made no attempt to detach his hand from Harry’s.
“It’s this wand,” he says defensively. “It hasn’t been right since you nicked it.”
“What the fuck is that.”
Harry concentrated. He thought about leathery wings and white, staring eyes. Hot breath that smelled like meat. “No,” he said firmly.
“White ones. They’re supposed to be good luck, according to Luna. It’s a bit of a stupid superstition, honestly, but at least the sun wasn’t shining.” He propped his elbows on the table and leaned forwards as if sharing a secret. “For watching white walruses, wetter weather is better weather.”
“Don’t be stupid, I was the one who made assumptions. You told me all along, right from our first meeting. If I had just paid attention–”
“Good,” Malfoy said. “In that case, I propose we run through a few tests, I will give you a more in-depth explanation about how I expect the therapy to proceed, and you can think the matter over. If you wish to continue, I will see you back here tomorrow for the first Legilimency session. Do you have any issues with that?”
Shit.
“You think he’s pretty?”
it took to get anywhere without magic. By the time he fought his way off the bus outside Hampton Court Palace, he was anxious, sweaty and twenty minutes late.
“Fuck!” Draco squeezed Harry’s hand and squared his shoulders. “Fuck!”
“Yes, dear. From when you were an Auror.” She smiled fondly. “I can’t tell you how pleased I was when you went into teaching. An Auror is such a dangerous career, and you’re still so young. I do wish Ron would hurry up and follow your lead. He’s awfully overworked, and George is desperate to have him in the shop.” She cocked her head. “So, do you like it?”
“Weasley.” Malfoy nods politely.
“Draco’s good at blowjobs, too,” Harry says unnecessarily, grinning up at me. His mouth is puffy and my hand is still in his hair. I feel like I’m dreaming. If I am, I never want to wake up.
Potter’s dark eyebrows drew together, but after a moment’s hesitation, he duly told Draco the full story of his recovery. He talked about how his memories had appeared all at once, but had been difficult to parse for the first week. He talked about how he had spoken to Robards, and was going to lessen his hours with the Aurors. He talked about how he was formally transferring both his Wizengamot and Confederation responsibilities to Granger (who had covered both roles over the last few months and had thoroughly enjoyed herself).
“Yeah. What do you think?”
Draco raises his head, licking his lips. Potter’s eyes are intense – dark and dazed. He’s definitely not ignoring Draco now.
“Okay,” Malfoy says from beside the bed. “Kiss him, Harry.”
It’s five minutes before Draco shows up in Harry’s room. In that time, Harry has hit himself with every cleaning charm he can think of, shoved all his dirty clothes into his wardrobe, lit a few candles, straightened his bedsheets as best he can, and taken his shirt off—and immediately felt awkward and put it back on again. Nervousness has wilted his erection; though there’s still a definite bit of interest, he’s nowhere near the aching hardness he was when he woke up with Draco’s head on his shoulder, Draco’s body curled into his. He briefly considers wanking himself off a bit to perk himself up again, but the thought of Draco walking in on him with his cock in his hand is far too embarrassing. What if Harry misunderstood? What if Draco is coming over for a late-night game of Exploding Snap?
“Hey, it’ll be fine,” he said, slipping into the voice he used for soothing frazzled students. “I promise I’ll take it easy. And I won’t Apparate anywhere. We’ve figured out worse things than this, haven’t we? There’s no need to panic.”
Hermione’s face fell. “Oh. You haven’t noticed.”
“No, but I want him to fuck me again and he won’t until he knows you’re okay with it,” Draco says petulantly. “Can we?”
Harry declined the check-up. Hermione and Ron took him back to Grimmauld Place in a Muggle taxi. Ron tried to pay the driver with a Tesco Clubcard. Harry went to bed.
The thought of
Harry had allowed Malfoy to change the subject once already. He wasn’t going to allow it again. “I can’t believe you left me like that. I genuinely thought I was going to come right there at the table. I’d’ve definitely been in the press, then.”
“What should I call you, then?”
charm glowing on his bed. Potter has been here eight minutes already. There’s so much Draco still wants to do.
Harry waved an impatient hand, but was saved from having to muster up a response by Tom re-emerging from the back room, making a show of peering down at a large, battered book.
this was a waste of time. I
Potter walks haltingly to Draco’s bed. Draco gets eagerly to his feet and circles him, studying him in a way he never normally can, taking in every detail. His eyes linger on the familiar curl of Potter’s hair, the smudges on his glasses, the shadow of stubble on his chin. Potter lets it happen, his expression bewildered. It’s deliciously authentic.
Harry considered that as the sensation slipped down his chest, his stomach, lower. He and Malfoy winced at the exact same time, and Harry ultimately decided that he probably would prefer stabbing ice to boiling liquid—though his balls felt like they had retreated to somewhere in the region of his kidneys.
“Harry?” Malfoy asked.
Harry stood and started to pace. He’d ruined his relationship for this. He’d thrown away – god, he’d thrown away the Weasleys. Hermione. His family. There was no way they’d understand – there was nothing
“Susan and Seamus,” Harry said soberly.
He shakes from the effort of keeping himself in control. There’s a misty sheen over his senses; he’s barely aware of the cobblestones under his feet, the smattering of stars above him, the rough stone of the wall he braces himself on.
Harry paused. It hadn’t made sense before, why Draco agreed to the wedding when he lived as a Muggle, when he didn’t even notice his magic disappearing.
“You also can’t unlearn facts by extracting the memories of when you learned them. You’ll remember the fact even if you don’t remember how you know it.”
“Potter. I risked my career to kiss you. I risked my career to just
“Tell me which other Aurors you fucked.” Harry leaned forwards, pressing Malfoy almost in half as he pushed his cock deep inside him.
“I want you to answer my fucking questions.” But the words lacked conviction even to his own ears.
“A comforting space.” Harry tried to think of the last time he felt comforted. Nothing sprang to mind.
“I can’t believe I’m doing this. Are you ready?
Hermione started to hum to herself while she sorted the drinks, clearly not intending to respond. Harry braced himself. “Just a research thing,” he said. “Hermione wanted to know more Mind Magic theory.”
Another deep breath. They were back in the bedroom, an owl at the window, a scroll tied neatly to its leg. His hand reached for the owl treats. More owls, beaks tapping on glass, letters gripped by sharp talons.
“What? Describe it to me.” Malfoy’s voice was strained.
“– never wanted to see me again,” they said in unison.
“What?” My attention catches on “Granger”, but Harry has wrapped a loose fist around my dick and is stroking me torturously slowly, so I’m struggling to process what Malfoy just said. “God, Harry—”
Harry squeezed. Malfoy bucked his hips with a whine.
Malfoy made a helpless noise. “You can’t just say something like that and then change the subject! Merlin, your impulse control is shocking, I can’t believe…” He narrowed his eyes and pointed accusingly at Harry. “How long do you wait between having a thought and immediately blurting it out?” he demanded. “Five seconds? Ten?”
For a moment, Malfoy looked lost. “Confusing things,” he admitted. “I’m so used to being the one to apologise. I don’t really know what to … Anyway, it doesn’t matter. If you see Weasley, tell him I’ll reply after work. Let’s get started.”
“It was the same night as – as Dumbledore. One of the Death Eaters I let into Hogwarts was called Fenrir Greyback. He attacked Bill.”
Draco nodded, and Harry kissed him. It was slower, softer—an apology for the unexpected Apparition, maybe—and, fuck, it sent desire dripping through Draco like honey.
“Please, don’t mention it.” The words sounded automatic. Malfoy must get patients thanking him all the time. “It was my pleas– I mean, it was no trouble.”
“That’s not – I can’t,” he repeated. “Not with a patient.”
Malfoy’s was cool yet … fragrant, somehow. And there was something else … Harry couldn’t put his finger on it.
He left the letter on the bed, tentatively donned a pair of glasses that were on the bedside table (only to find that the world, once resolved into sharp focus, was not any more familiar), and began to investigate the house he’d woken up in.
Potter is looking at him, mouth agape, like he’s never seen him before. His wide eyes dart between Draco’s like he’s trying to figure something out, like he’s searching for something, but isn’t sure what he’s looking for.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “I notice you’re sitting here alone, rather than accompanied by the unfortunate-haired power couple.”
Potter looks over his shoulder and bites his lip like he’s abashed. Damn him.
“What team would you prefer, so I know for next time?” The pleasure of even saying the words “next time” made Harry’s breath catch. He hoped Draco would attribute it to the roll of their hips, the friction that sent sparks shooting over his skin. “I could get some vintage Wimbourne Wasp ones. You could have Ludo Bagman grinning up at you, if you’d rather.”
Draco shuddered in Harry’s arms. “Fuck. You’re going to kill me. Yes.”
After a solid three days of arguing (Harry holding his breath and Summoning household items every hour in case the contract decided they’d gone too far), they’d agreed to buy the vacant flat above Ceridwen’s Cauldrons in Hogsmeade.
A second finger, and Draco bit his lip, lifted his hips. In and out. In and out.
“What time were you with him? Was anybody else around?”
“Hm?” Malfoy’s intense gaze was still firmly fixed on Harry.
But with a beam and a flourish, Molly’s surprise was finally unveiled: a six-tiered masterpiece, with an edible tableau of Harry and Draco’s lives winding up the tiers, culminating in miniature icing-sugar figures of Harry and Draco holding hands, gazing at each other adoringly.
“About the ‘no kissing’ rule…” Harry began, but Malfoy cut him off before Harry could finish his negotiations.
“Voldemort, he – My scar – Where – wand–”
“No, idiot. It’s from Weasley.”
“Is this more what you had in mind? When you imagined me in bed with you?”
“I mean,” Potter says hoarsely, “I’m actually in favour of you touching me whenever you finally get round to –
“The spell. Did you do it wrong?”
“Make it slow,” he says. A smirk creeps over his face. “Make him want you.”
“I have to move,” he whispers, hoping Draco will hear and roll over without properly waking.
I make a small, tortured noise.
Fuck. Him.
“I’m comfortable with him already,” Harry said quickly. “There’s no need.”
“You didn’t force me to do anything,” Potter says firmly. He’s still holding Draco’s shoulders. “I wasn’t the one who thought it wasn’t real.”
“Never what?” Malfoy’s voice was sharp.
“For it to be valid, they would have needed an element of you, like with Polyjuice. Your blood, your hair, something like that.”
Harry blinked. “Er, I dunno. Rarebit sounds good, I suppose?”
“Shit,” he breathes.
Potter twists around to look. His eyes are bright and unfocused, but even now, even in a fantasy, Draco feels inadequate under his gaze.
The smirk didn’t meet Malfoy’s uncertain eyes.
“Nah,” he says. “He just likes being bossy. He’s happiest when someone takes control from him, really.”
“Nah,” Harry says, accepting his own drink and raising it in thanks.
But Harry didn’t find out what Draco thought, because Harry was kissing Draco desperately, fumbling with the fastening on his own robes. He needed to be closer to Draco, to feel him, to have as much of him as possible before he changed his mind and realised that he didn’t mean it – couldn’t mean it–
were blurring again. The wary stiffness that this version of Potter had carried when they’d been in public had vanished. He was loose again.
“I, ah.” Healer Brisley seemed similarly wrong-footed by the curt interaction, but regained her cheeriness almost immediately. “Lovely!” she said. Her flyaway grey hair quivered with the force of her excitement. “So! As my wonderful clock so kindly reminded me, I have a few teensy errands to run. If you don’t mind, I’ll leave you to get to know one another and discuss next steps. Do give me a shout if you need me! Ms Granger, Mr Malfoy, I assume one of you can send a Patronus?”
“People will think we’ve been stood up,” I say, forcing a grin and nodding to the empty chairs. As attempts at humour go, it’s a weak one, but it’s the best I can do with a stomach full of dodgy beer and the world’s most inconvenient semi.
Draco’s amused voice came from the kitchen; Harry followed it.
“… the ritual of the marriage contract.”
Malfoy’s face crumpled. Less than a heartbeat later, Harry was sure he must have imagined it, because Malfoy was as blank-faced and professional as always. Harry realised suddenly that Malfoy hadn’t looked like that for their last few sessions. The thudding rhythm stuttered again.
I’m amused by my extremely correct interpretation of Malfoy’s drinking habits and I turn to share my hilarious observations with Harry, but he’s looking at me strangely. I raise an eyebrow and wipe my mouth in case I’ve got a moustache of beer foam.
“You bastard,” Draco gasped, his voice so high, so needy. “You absolute prick. I love you too.”
him. “Do you think I’d’ve gone along with it if I wasn’t into it? Now you’re the one not thinking it through. Do you know how many people try to jump me on a daily basis? If I let all of them fuck me, you’d have definitely heard about it.”
“It’s okay to be scared, Harry.”
“No way,” Harry breathed. He propped himself up on one elbow. “Are you having me on? That was the night I fell in love with you too! That’s why I picked it for the ribbons, you were amazing, I think about it all the – Why are you shaking your head?”
“No, not the bed, you idiot.”
For a panicked moment, Harry thought he would fall over without Draco’s hand holding him upright. But then the chill of Draco’s magic flared in his chest, settling him. Harry shook his head, unnerved.
“Just wanted to look something up,” Hermione said, her attempt at airiness hampered by her laboured breathing.
Harry held out his hand and his wand flew from Malfoy’s fingers. Another flick, and Malfoy’s wrists were secure against the headboard again.
Anyway, back to mooning (or not, as the case may be): Parkinson has noticed how perfect Hermione’s arse is, too, if the appreciative look on her face is anything to go by. I narrow my eyes, hoping my glare will warn her off. What is she even doing here? She should have stopped coming to our DA reunion pub nights after she and Luna broke up. It’s DA members and partners only. That’s the
“The last time we were in this office together.” Malfoy’s breath caught. Harry continued, his voice low. “A lot of fantasies from the weeks before. And quite a few from before I lost my memory, actually.”
Except whenever it happens, whenever Harry’s magic—Draco’s magic inside Harry—flares, it feels—
“Answer!”
“Are you calling me a liar?” Madam Pince swells in outrage.
“I’m asking you on a date,” Harry said. “Or, I’m asking if you want to sack off work for the rest of the day and come home with me. Last night I recovered some final memories. I’m definitely interested in revisiting them if you are.”
“Mine, actually.” Malfoy’s voice was dry.
The Malfoy at the desk hummed and turned the page. Harry leaned closer, curious to know more about his past. But this page didn’t hold a schedule, but a journal entry. Harry only managed to read a snippet –
“At least the flowers will be happy,” Harry said, nodding at the arrangements that lined the courtyard. They didn’t seem too happy at all, actually—the delicate petals were taking a battering from the heavy rainfall—but Draco hummed in vague agreement.
He slumped against it, heart pounding. “Oh my god,” he said loudly. “Fuck, I’m sorry, I thought you – Why would you invite me in?!” He thunked his head back against the door. He had been so
“Don’t worry about it. Go on. I’ll see you there.”
Malfoy’s face flickered. “Then I would be very happy for you.”
“Why?” Malfoy asked sharply. “You’re not considering it?”
Draco snorted. He unhooked Harry’s cloak from the rack and held it out. “Madam Tamsworth isn’t that bad. And anyway, her mince pies make up for the, you know” – he waved a careless hand – “general over-effusiveness. If you’d just
“I mean that I’m literally on my knees begging you to take me. In any way you’ll have me. For however long you’ll have me. It’s rather pathetic, really, but I’m trying not to think about it too hard.”
. The warm splash of him on my chest.
Harry swore. He eased in a third finger.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, but Malfoy was silent, his face shuttered. This wasn’t something he could help with. This was something that only Harry’s lost memories could help with. He looked back to the girl helplessly.
of it. Harry Potter is on his knees in front of Draco, naked and hard and sucking Draco’s cock like he was born to do it, like he
” Potter arches his back, pushing his arse backwards. “Malfoy, shit, are you – Are you literally
“It wouldn’t have done anything. You had to be ready to see it for yourself.”
A smile took over Draco’s mouth. It lit up his entire pinched, pointed, beautiful face. “Yeah, you can come over. I’d like that.”
like Draco’s Harry—seductive robes notwithstanding—but he held himself differently to the person Draco had grown to know over the last few months. His shoulders were tenser, his back straighter. His gaze flicked up from the menu every time the bell above the door chimed, and his jaw clenched whenever someone walked too close to the table—an echo of it threw shadows onto the stubble just below his cheekbones.
“Let me fuck your mouth,” he says.
Shit. No going back now.
“Well, yes – that and the brand of a murderous fascist burned into my forearm. I was expecting that to be a significant deterrent.”
Harry nodded warily, unnerved at the abrupt shift in mood.
Harry lifted his head at Malfoy’s tone. Malfoy looked small and unhappy. “You think I won’t want you if I get my memories back?”
Potter nodded, then inhaled sharply. Memory-Draco had caught sight of Potter, and was looking absolutely stupid: frozen, staring, his Butterbeer halfway to his open mouth. Potter blinked, then turned back to the witches at the table.
His hand drops to his own cock, and he palms himself roughly through his clothes. He shifts, pushing his hips into his hand. Malfoy makes a low noise of encouragement.
“Fuck.” Harry’s head was reeling. Over the last few months, ruminating over his depleted magic, he’d suspected everything from the lingering effects of the Horcrux to nutritional damage from the summer he’d eaten nothing but grapefruit and birthday cake. He’d considered poisons, Dark creatures, cursed items of clothing. An unfulfilled marriage contract had not occurred to him.
It’s a mess. Blood winds deep red tracks over pale skin, collecting in thick droplets on the underside of his arm. One of the droplets swells. Falls. Harry whimpers.
His cock is hard and pinker than the rest of him. A silver piercing glints in one of his nipples. I swallow and avert my eyes.
things like – Show me. I want to see.” Harry reached a hand across the table. It was the second time he had demanded to see Malfoy’s thoughts. He had been refused last time. “Please. Draco. Please.”
The question was probably rhetorical, but Draco answered anyway. What was the alternative? More slack-jawed staring?
“Exactly. And it’s why Narcissa was able to evoke the contract in your name. The magic recognises her as your elder relative. She has authority over you.”
“Three.”
Harry nodded quickly. “That’s fine.”
“Shh, it’s okay.” A cool hand rested on his forehead. There was a touch on his shoulder, guiding him onto his back. “You’re in St Mungo’s.”
“That’s
“We’re in a quiet room having a private conversation; this is exactly the same as usual,” Harry said. “You want to know if I mean it? Take a look.” He sat back and spread his arms, watching Malfoy through his lashes.
Malfoy didn’t look up as Harry walked over. Harry stood at the bar beside him, allowed himself three seconds to study Malfoy’s face at a closer-than-usual range, then said, “Hey.”
“Draco,” Harry said. He couldn’t think of a way to end the sentence.
, and really, he’d been paid to work with Harry, he didn’t deserve any kind of thanks or reward—but Harry didn’t wait for permission; he slid his hand over Draco’s stomach, wrapped his fingers around Draco’s cock and started to stroke him with smooth, confident strokes.
Draco drew his wand with difficulty—Potter was still pressing him against the counter. Draco didn’t ask him to stop.
Draco whined. The humour had completely gone from his voice. “Harry, please–”
“Open your mouth,” Draco rasps. Potter obeys without hesitation, his lips parting, his tongue out, resting flat over his bottom teeth. Draco rubs the head of his cock against the glistening pinkness. He teases himself – teases both of them, going by Potter’s frustrated little moans – and rubs the head of his prick over Potter’s tongue, not letting himself slide inside that hot mouth. Not yet. Potter’s lips wrap around him, and Draco manages to pull back, letting Potter chase him, letting Potter try and take Draco into his mouth again and again, only for Draco to deny him, even though Draco is shaking, even though he wants it so much he could scream.
Malfoy’s thumb absently rubbed the back of Harry’s hand. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea.”
This thing with Malfoy—Draco—is still new. But it only took a month for him—bright-eyed, flushed—to confess his favourite fantasy: two Harry Potters, tying him up, taking him apart. Harry immediately considered the logistics. He ruled out Polyjuice. A Time-Turner—challenging. Gemino Curse adaptation? Risky.
“You’re a Mind Healer, right, Draco?” came Potter’s voice from behind him.
Malfoy broke the moment first.
“I’m surprised you came back.” Malfoy watched Harry over linked fingers.
Draco clenched his fingers in the bedsheets. “I appreciate—
Harry frowned at Malfoy, who hadn’t moved. “Where did it go? Did you end the spell?”
“No…?”
, the sturdiness of the wood beneath his hands. “Okay.”
“Not everybody is as kinky as you, Potter,” Draco sniffed, and Harry laughed and pulled him into another kiss, like he couldn’t help himself, like he couldn’t keep himself away now he’d done it once. Draco knew the feeling.
My leg is cold without the weight of Harry’s hand on it, but my face is burning hot.
, yes, like that, do that again.”
Harry quashed a stab of disappointment. He didn’t know if he’d ever been there, but it was unlikely.
“You know, you never used to like Earl Grey,” Hermione said conversationally while she arranged teapots, mugs and strainers. “So interesting – I wonder if it’s related to the memory loss? Or perhaps something to do with a lack of awareness of your own habits leading you to try things you’d ordinarily avoid? I’d love to know more about it. Do you suppose there’s research on that sort of thing?”
Draco was not prepared for this. He thought Potter would dirty talk into his ear for half an hour while Draco touched himself. Never in his wildest dreams did he think that he would ever be able to have – that he would ever deserve the chance, even the fictional one–
Tags/Warnings: mention of drinking and drunkenness, mild swearing
“I want too,” Harry says. He drops a kiss to Draco’s soft hair, lets the shimmer of pleasure wash through him. “Night, Draco.”
“What,” Harry says nervously. “What are you looking at me like that for?”
But Harry was on a roll. “And all that crap he was spewing last night – that you only agreed to work with me because you like having power over me!” He scoffed. “Absolute dragonshit.”
Malfoy’s eyes flicked to Ron and Hermione. Harry turned to look, too; Hermione smiled encouragingly. Even Ron nodded.
Harry exhaled. That…was not as bad as it could have been. Really not bad at all. It was such a reasonable letter, in fact, that it was almost…disappointing. Harry even began to doubt whether he hadn’t imagined the whole thing. Could he have been so sleep-deprived that he’d deposited Malfoy at the inn and returned home immediately, only to pass out and have an incredibly vivid dream? It wasn’t impossible. Much more probable than the alternative, really. A mind-blowing sexual encounter with Draco Malfoy? Harry, who was with Ginny, and Malfoy, who was an arsehole? He reread the letter, searching for a hidden meaning. Maybe he
Before Harry could process Luna’s bizarre words, she had ushered him through the front door. He found himself in a small but extremely grand foyer. The next set of doors were made from a rich wood with dark iron fixtures that reminded him jarringly of the sinister curlicues on the antique iron chest that held the marriage contract. On the other side of the doors, he could hear a low murmur of voices. For a second, he imagined himself walking through them and up the aisle as a bride would do, the guests standing as he walked in, and cold dread locked his limbs in place. But he and Malfoy had agreed—neither of them were doing that. They’d each take a side entrance and appear at the front. No aisle parade. No wedding march. No organ. It was hardly a win, but Harry would take whatever he could get.
When they were like this, Harry didn’t need to say anything. Harry knew he was ready, so Malfoy knew he was ready. The Malfoy in his head reached out and tried to turn the knob of the door. Much to Harry’s satisfaction, the door didn’t budge.

Malfoy pursed his lips. “Let’s try this, then: I’ll cast, and you block me with a standard Shield Charm. Keep eye contact with me while you do. My spell should rebound and let you into my mind, then you’ll be able to get a greater sense of my mental presence. Are you comfortable with that?”
“Is it? Why?”
“I could kill you. It would be so easy. It would be so good. Wouldn’t it be a good way to go, Draco? With my dick in your arse and my teeth in your neck? Would you like that?”
He feels
be real. He can’t be.
Draco’s chest aches. “Do you still want to use my Floo, or can you Apparate?”
Harry lifts his head. “You all right?”
“I meant it,” he says urgently, his gaze locked on me. “What I said about that night. I did want to. I still—”
“Weasley,” Malfoy says abruptly. “Would you like to fuck me?”
“Can you still hear it now the spell is gone?” Malfoy asked. His eyes were bright.
Potter grins. “Let me walk with you.” Draco shakes his head, but he knows he’s going to agree. “The trip will clear my head. I’ll Floo from yours.”
It was some sort of schedule – Harry did a double take when he saw the words “Grimmauld Place”. He peered closer and gasped; it was an account of the last two weeks of Harry’s life before he lost his memory. Harry himself didn’t know most of the information laid out before him.
Harry shrugged. “Not much to say to them, really. None of us want to get in any more fights, so we just sit there in silence whenever I go over. It’s better than arguing, I suppose.”
Each Diagnostic Charm had provoked a similar reaction, but each felt slightly different. Healer Brisley’s were always warm and oozing, giving Harry the uncomfortable feeling that he’d wet himself. Healer Medlar, who Harry had had the dubious pleasure of having worked with throughout the whole of April, performed Diagnostic Charms that felt like the static from a Muggle television.
A month went by, and Ginny still wasn’t home. The weather was getting cooler, Grimmauld Place less stuffy, but Harry hardly noticed; whenever he wasn’t at work, he was occupied with his new pastime: fucking Draco Malfoy.
Harry stilled. “What?”
“The point still stands…”
Harry closed his eyes. Concentrated. Nodded.
Harry pauses when he’s all the way inside. Our bollocks are touching, our cocks clamped together inside Draco’s tight, clenching heat. I squeeze my eyes shut and force myself to take three slow, deep breaths. Harry murmurs comfortingly in Draco’s ear.
Draco took the last few inches. He was fully seated, his arse pressed against the tops of Harry’s legs. Harry was inside him. As deep as he could go.
Once I’ve steadied myself, I open my eyes to Harry watching me. I meet his gaze. He starts to move.
Another painful gulp of air. “I – I made you – I forced you to–”
“Mmm, I did do well, didn’t I?” Draco’s head moved against Harry’s fingers as he preened. Harry imagined tightening his grip.
Well, he knew the answer to that: he
“God, it does,” Potter agrees mindlessly, pushing back against him, taking Draco’s cock deeper. “Feels amazing.
“Good. There’s a fireplace in my bedroom. We’ll see you there.”
“Start to say something and then go all blank and tell me it’s not important.”
Harry is sitting on said four-poster, one leg against the navy sheets, bent at the knee. His jacket lies in a heap next to his discarded shoes. Malfoy stands next to him, still in his tailored grey robes and shiny black boots. Both of them look up as I emerge from the fire.
For example:
had not been as clear. Draco had caught himself snapping and sneering in a way he’d never, ever do with another patient—and had found himself, mortifyingly, faced with Harry’s polite confusion, even hurt.
Draco tore his eyes away from the incredible sight of his finger disappearing inside Harry to find that Harry was looking at him imploringly, his neck straining to keep his head upright so he could watch Draco finger-fuck him.
“Shame about the end, though,” Harry mused after a while. “I closed my eyes when I came, I think. It broke the connection.”
Draco presses forwards, chasing more of the roughness, the heat, and Potter’s back hits the post of Draco’s bed. Potter breaks the kiss with a sharp inhale. Denied Potter’s mouth, Draco drags his lips over the coarseness of his jaw, bites his ear, licks his neck. His skin tastes like the outside, like brisk mountain air, like salt and wood and musk. Draco can’t get enough, and lavishes hot kisses down Potter’s throat, yanking his robes out of the way, the softness of Potter’s skin driving him wild.
He’s still rocking his hips, meeting my every thrust with an appreciative moan, so it takes a second for the words to register. Once they do, I drop my hands and straighten my legs, trying pull out—but he leans backwards, keeping me inside him.
“Of course it does,” Malfoy says smugly. “He’s amazing at blowjobs.”
The garden again.
Harry threw the parchment aside, cupped Draco’s face in both hands, and kissed him.
“I mean, if you want to, obviously,” he adds. “I told you, don’t let him boss you around.”
A safeword? I pull away from Draco’s mouth to ask what’s going on—but Harry answers me without words. His gentle finger hardens into a point and presses against Draco’s rim. There’s resistance, then I feel it give way, and Harry’s finger slips inside Draco. Slips alongside my cock.
“Really, really not,” Malfoy reiterated, an appalled look on his face.
“Are you all right?” Malfoy asked, eyes raking over Harry. Harry felt it like a physical touch.
“That’s cheating! You can’t use
“Before you go,” Malfoy said awkwardly.
“Not if I ask for it.”
“Yes,” he said, interrupting them.
Another pause. I can feel Malfoy’s gaze on me. The hair on the back of my neck stands up the way it does when I’ve figured something out—a chess move, the perfect item for a customer, the reason why someone is acting a bit weird—but my neck doesn’t pass the message of whatever I’ve figured out onto my head, because I’m still completely lost.
Harry considered. “Hogwarts?” he suggested. “I was only there for a couple of hours, right back at the beginning.”
“Er, yeah,” he said quickly, the wary sympathy (or was that, god forbid, pity?) in her smile setting him on edge. “Yeah, I’m fine. Thanks.”
He falls to his knees in front of Malfoy. Malfoy’s thighs widen, and Harry runs his hands over them. Harry is warm now, yes, but Malfoy is warmer. His skin is hot under Harry’s palms, the hair fine and soft, thickening and darkening at his crotch.
“I’ll see you tomorrow?” Harry called, half-standing with some difficulty.
“Stop it,” I hiss. “What about Harry?”
“Well,” Draco said, taken aback. “There usually has to be some kind of existing connection between the two. They have to know each other intimately, on a deeply personal level, to be able to instinctively recognise and welcome the mental and magical intrusion.”
Draco hadn’t realised that his pace had faltered, that his hips had stilled, but Potter is peering over his shoulder, checking that Draco is okay as if Draco is worth something. The half of his face that Draco can see is flushed. His fringe is sweaty, sticking to his head. He’s yanked off his glasses and his eyes are incredible – so vivid despite the swollen black of his pupils. For a moment, Draco can’t do anything but stare.
Dawlish confides in Wilson about his marital problems.
“We did, yeah.”
Then he grabs Potter’s wrist, yanks it upwards, pins it above Potter’s head. Potter makes a small noise of surprised arousal that Draco is going to be thinking about for the rest of his life.
“No.” Harry couldn’t wipe the grin off his face. This was so much easier with Malfoy scowling at him. “One more thing.”
Inside, Draco vanished immediately, leaving Harry to wander, feigning interest. Until he
Then, tier six: the adoring embrace.
“Merlin, feels so good,” Malfoy replied, his head tipped back. He slid down further.
“Fine,” Draco says, his fingers tightening on Harry’s thigh for a second before he pulls away. Harry misses the contact immediately. “I’ll meet you there. Two minutes.”
Malfoy’s grip was painful. Harry focused on it as he pounded into him. Malfoy sounded almost close to tears as he gasped, “You’re gonna – right there, don’t stop – I’m gonna – fuck! Fuck!
Harry thrust upwards again helplessly. The drag of his cock inside Draco’s slick, tight hole was incredible, but much better were the noises that Draco was making, the way he threw his head back and let his eyes slide closed, the way his cock bobbed and leaked onto Harry’s stomach.
“Well – yes. Theoretically. But you’d never be able to get your memories back. They would be gone forever.”
No, these days, Harry thought his birthdays were quite nice.
Another wave, and one of the bowls floated over to Malfoy; the other towards Harry. Harry plucked it out of the air instinctively.
“Harry,” Malfoy said in a strained voice that sent shivers down Harry’s spine. “I can’t.”
The floral smell mingled with the sharp tang of broom polish. Malfoy’s teammate elbowed him and sneered towards – was that Ron, standing next to Harry, looking rather green in the face? Harry’s stomach did an unhappy jolt at the sight; he’d been told he’d known Ron since their first day of school – but he couldn’t remember him looking any younger than twenty-seven.
The library swirled away and resettled to form the familiar shape of the inside of the Leaky Cauldron. Harry was sitting next to Malfoy at a different table than usual, but could easily identify a few fellow regulars: the barman, a white-haired old witch who shook Harry’s hand enthusiastically every time she saw him, the two bald-headed warlocks who invariably sat huddled over the table in the far corner.
Malfoy quirks an eyebrow. “I don’t recall doing much talking this morning, darling.”
“Why me on top?” Harry asks Draco. “This is all about what you want.”
“We didn’t actually do any Mind Magic,” past-Harry admitted.
“Okay.” Harry needs to hold himself back, to keep himself in check, but he’s no longer sure why. He lets Malfoy’s arm fall and resumes his position on his knees before Malfoy, his hands gripping Malfoy’s thighs, Malfoy’s dick inches from Harry’s mouth.
Malfoy lowered his glass. “Oh?”
When I can’t pretend my glass is anything but empty, I ask, with forced casualness, “What about Neville’s stag do?”
“Gonna fill you with my come and taste it in your blood–”
Malfoy’s mouth twisted. “You did,” he said drily. “Seven pages of it. And I thank you for your frankly astonishing amount of detail. Please be assured that I read and understood every word.”
“So,” Malfoy says. He flicks his wand in my direction and sends a fresh pint sailing over to me. I stare at it blankly. “Why the secrecy? Was Weasley embarrassing himself pining after Granger again?”
Harry was absolutely going to revisit the memory of the phrase “intimate situation” rolling out of Malfoy’s mouth. He swallowed.
Harry’s relief buoyed him through the thrill of Draco’s hand over his as they cut the cake, through flashes of camera bulbs and more applause. His face was just starting to ache from his fixed smile when his reprieve came in the form of The No-Maj Matrix, four witches who were, they yelled at the crowd, from Salem, Massachusetts and were ready to party.
“All right.” Malfoy raised his wand. “Let me know when you’re ready.”
“Fifth year.” Malfoy’s voice again came disconcertingly from inside Harry’s head. Or should that be inside Malfoy’s head? “This was the last match we played against each other. You got banned for life after this,” he added fondly.
Harry made a small, helpless noise.
Mum always says my problem is that I care too much. I think that’s nonsense, honestly—one of those meaningless things mums say to make you feel better about overreacting to stupid shit. But I can’t deny that I care about my friends. I mean,
“Don’t clean that up,” he says (if he does have fifty more minutes, he’s going to lick Potter’s chest clean himself) and wrenches himself away, ignoring Potter’s noise of protest. He grabs his wand and dashes across the room to the Daydream Charm box, which is lying abandoned on his bed.
“Four doors,” Malfoy repeated. “Are you sure?”
. It was hours before Harry could calm down enough to think straight. He was beginning to wonder whether there wasn’t something wrong with him, aside from the obvious. Surely this unquenchable libido wasn’t normal in a twenty-seven-year-old. He was so, so thankful for Anti-Chafing Charms.
”So…?”
“Excellent!” the other witch said. She beamed. “That’s settled, then! We’ll see you on the seventeenth. Thank you again for agreeing to do this.”
“We fell asleep on the sofa,” Harry says, his voice hoarse. That’s definitely Draco’s cock pressing into Harry’s thigh. That’s definitely a big, hard, insistent—
Somehow, despite Harry’s memory loss not being public to begin with, the news of his recovery had made it back to Head Auror Robards. Harry was pulled in for a lengthy interrogation about whether he still wanted to be an Auror (yes), whether he was ready for active duty (no) and whether his head was fixed yet (mostly). He wore his uniform to the meeting out of habit – it was only once he got home and caught sight of himself in the mirror that he realised the only time he’d seen himself wearing it in the last six months had been inside Malfoy’s mind. Harry pulled the robes off and shoved them in the back of the wardrobe out of sight.
, but by the dozens of Thirst-Quenching Draughts that Harry had been force-fed by unsmiling Healers. He’s tried to tell him every time since then – whenever Malfoy pushes him, offers himself up, persuades Harry to forgo the potions and chase him over Europe.
At that, Harry snorted. “Well, she definitely fucked up, there, didn’t she?”
“Er,” Harry said.
Malfoy smiled tightly. “Well, goodnight,” he said. He nodded to Scuttleby, locked eyes with Harry for an intense, confusing moment, then Disapparated.
They were both sticky with sweat and come. While his pulse slowed, Harry listened to the traffic from the Muggle street through the window. Sluggishly, it occurred to him to wonder whether the rooms were fitted with Silencing Charms. It would be a problem if the entire inn had heard what had just happened – it wasn’t as if nobody had noticed them arrive together.
“You said that you’ve come up with something that you would feel comfortable showing me?”
Harry laughed wildly. “Three!” He ran into the courtyard, yanking Draco with him.
In Malfoy’s office, another day, another time. The room was empty of furniture. Malfoy was rolling up his sleeve, the Dark Mark an ugly scar on his smooth, pale skin.
“I’ve heard that, sometimes, a Legilimens doesn’t actually need to maintain eye contact.” Harry’s voice was a bit too casual, but Draco was too tired and satisfied to comment.
But no matter how many friends and family members with whom Harry exchanged presents, hugs and laughter over the Christmas holidays, he couldn’t help but resent the time away from work.
“It was seriously strange. Not sure I could do it justice.”
“Mmm, you’re right. You had better go in before you really are late,” she said, blinking her large eyes at him. “And if you think he looks nice, you should tell him. He’s very nervous, and he responds well to compliments.”
He arrived to a Leaky Cauldron that was notably quieter than usual. The reason for this became obvious almost immediately. Malfoy – pale and bedraggled, but with twin splodges of red high on his pointy cheekbones – stood by the bar glaring defiantly at Tom, who glared right back.
They stared at each other.
“The Hufflepuff ghost?”
God, he’s so hot – in both senses. He’s gorgeous, laid out before Harry like a feast, but the
,” Malfoy gasped. “What?”
“Please,” he ground out. “Whenever you’re ready – Let me –
“Shit. What time is it?”
Draco forces a smirk and allows himself another indulgence. “Will it make you feel better if I say I think you’re a self-important dickhead?”
The fantasy is authentic: it’s exactly what Draco wants to be true. It still hurts.
Harry lifted his head and looked downwards. Malfoy held his eyes as he slid his mouth all the way down, until Harry could feel the tightness of Malfoy’s throat swallowing around him.
“Are you – God, is that your –
leave, if you want,” Harry corrects, coming to a halt by my side. “But we’re still up for it, if you are. We just wanna make sure— I know it hasn’t been that long, since Hermione.”
“Thank fuck that’s over. Millie was sniffling through the whole thing. I was
“Very good,” Draco heard himself murmur. He watched in fascination as Harry’s arse swallowed his fingers, over and over.  “Fuck. You’re doing so well, Harry.”
“Can’t you see it?!” It was bloody massive, and it had appeared out of nowhere in Harry’s personal mental space that he’d spent hours painstakingly constructing so his clever, mysterious new Mind Healer would be proud of him.
To his credit, Tom looked cowed. “Ah, just a little joke, Mister Potter, do forgive me. It will be ten Galleons per night, as usual.”
“Okay,” he said. The words sounded strange, as if someone else had spoken them. “Send it.”
The door slammed open. Malfoy appeared, wild-eyed, panting. “Sorry, sorry! Is he – Harry? Are you–?”
With the strange musical note in his voice, Harry could ask anything of Malfoy, and Malfoy would give it. Harry could drain Malfoy of every drop of blood (a thrill shoots through him at the thought) and Malfoy would let him, would want him to, would beg for it.
Malfoy stood next to him. His eyes were dark and fixed on Harry, even inside his own head.
Malfoy’s grinning face flickered and a man Harry had seen only as a portrait floated to the front of his vision. The hooked nose and curled lip of Severus Snape – Harry’s previous Occlumency tutor, according to Hermione – sneered down at him from the wall of Professor McGonagall’s office: a memory from Harry’s unsuccessful trip to Hogwarts.
When he finally slept, his dreams were disjointed, linked only by a muffled pounding noise – the sound of running feet, a fist on a pub table, someone
Malfoy shrugged and looked away. “I think there’s no way of knowing until it happens.”
“That’s not what I’m doing.” Harry concentrated on the image of Malfoy on the bed under him, his head thrown back and his long fingers wrapped around his pink, straining cock. He pulled it from his mind and let it float into the basin.
“What date does the school year start at Hogwarts?”
It would have been an unpleasant experience for everyone.
“I have some idea,” Draco reminded him. But Harry shook his head and swayed forwards, his eyes fixed on Draco’s mouth. Draco’s lips tingled in anticipation.
I don’t really know how to navigate this one, so I say carefully, “Well, he’s not exactly bad-looking, is he?”
Harry fumbles at his flies. Draco’s cock is right there, inches from Harry’s clumsy fingers, flushed and hard, and Draco’s hand is wrapped around it, stroking lazily. Harry falters, his gaze fixed on the movement of Draco’s hand. On the bead of pre-come that grows at the slit. At the way Draco’s thumb swipes over it, spreading it over the head.
“Yes,” Harry agrees mindlessly. He takes Malfoy’s arm and drags his tongue over the wounds, which knit together under his attention. The taste is another punch to the gut, and Harry licks Malfoy’s arm, savouring every drop, until the only traces of his indulgence are the two small, uneven marks of his teeth.
Harry pushed open the door. As always, Malfoy was alone, behind his desk, writing in his journal. He lifted his head. His eyes widened.
It was hard to look at, but Harry couldn’t look away. He couldn’t decide what colour it was. Blue? Silver? Or was it, in fact, completely transparent? Whatever colour it was, it clung to his attention, drawing his gaze and capturing it. Even once the officiwizard had finished and the bowl was full, Harry couldn’t stop staring. Something about it called to mind spring mornings, the Hogwarts lake, the glint of a Snitch…
Even if Harry had asked before, Draco wouldn’t have told him. He didn’t want to tell him now, but Draco still wasn’t sure he should be here, ethically. Maybe reminding Potter exactly who Draco was would scare him away. It would probably be for the best, if it did.
Potter sat back in his chair. “Huh. I didn’t expect you to be like this.”
“Very good. All you have to do is open it. Whenever you’re ready.”
Unable to think of another excuse, Harry grudgingly tidied his desk, taking as much time as he dared.
“You can,” Harry said, his hands moving higher on Draco’s sides, gripping hard despite the sweat that built between them. “I’ve got you.”
“If you won’t tell me that, then tell me this,” Harry said. “Who was it? Which other Aurors have you compromised?”
Draco’s heartbeat thudded in his ears. If he said no, they could go back downstairs and end the evening with a cup of tea and a polite chat. They could discuss whatever was between them like adults, they could shake hands, and Draco could go home and get himself off with his nose buried in the collar of his robes, searching for a lingering trace of the scent of Harry’s pillow.
“That’s good,” Harry said. Brisley wilted at his obvious lack of enthusiasm.
But that had been a different person, Draco reminded himself. He cleared his throat. “So, anyway. Once everything had settled, after, you know…”
But if the incantation is still there.
The scene shifted.
“I reckon it’s one of those ‘he’s serious if I agree but he’s joking if I’m offended’ situations, you know?” Harry takes a swig of his beer and wipes the back of his hand across his mouth. A streak of wet glistens just below his wrist.
” Draco broke the kiss and threw his head back. “Oh my god, feels so good – I’m gonna come – Stop – You have to stop.
It was a stark contrast to the guilty afternoons they had spent together in the Leaky Cauldron. Back then, Harry would lounge in his seat with his back to the room, his eyes fixed on Draco like he was the only person in the world.
Harry lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening to Malfoy hum a song Harry didn’t recognise. He reluctantly admitted to himself that it made quite a nice change, waking to the sound of life, of absently murmured music, instead of the crushing silence he’d lived with since September; he’d spent too much time alone at the Dursleys’ to relish solitude as an adult. That was part of the reason he loved Hogwarts so much—there was always noise, always activity, always the reminder that he wasn’t alone, wasn’t locked up, wasn’t hidden away in shame.
Constant vigilance.
“No, of course,” Harry said, but it was hard to deny that it was an exciting development. Hermione and Ron would be delighted. Maybe he should send an owl to Brisley to tell her about it, too.
Draco’s bark of laughter melts into a moan. “Fuck, I’m so full,” he says, like he’s shocked about it. “God, I’m so—” He rocks back sharply and lets out a cry. “I think— It feels good. It feels—
The crumble did sound good, and the thought of it distracted Ron enough that the topic of Legilimency therapy was dropped in favour of a debate over the merits of custard versus ice cream as the superior crumble accompaniment and Hermione’s odd behaviour quickly faded from Harry’s mind. By the time they were polishing off their second helpings of crumble (Hermione: custard, Harry: ice cream, Ron: both), all three of them were in good spirits.
“Where is this?” Malfoy’s refined accent was almost incongruous with the earthy surroundings.
“Ron–” Hermione said anxiously.
Potter’s only reaction to Draco’s first finger is a quiet, strained exhalation. By the third, he’s cursing again, fucking himself on Draco’s hand, his head hanging downwards, and Draco can’t think – can’t think of anything other than
“I haven’t!” Malfoy’s fingers scrabbled for purchase on his bindings. “I’ve never fucked an Auror before you –
The first had been after that tiff with Weasley. Harry had probably just wanted company, shaken by what might have been his first disagreement with his friends.
Harry’s heart thuds. A dozen responses flit through his head, but he can’t think of a single way to say
A wave of calm washed away the unease so thoroughly that Harry wondered if he hadn’t imagined it. “Not at all,” Malfoy said. “This is a safe place for you to retreat to if your memories get out of control, like they did yesterday. The doors will allow you to sort through your thoughts and store them separately. What you find behind each door is entirely up to you. We’ll dedicate some sessions to that. All of this is about strengthening the control you have over your mind.”
Harry pulled a face. “So what? The intense eye contact and someone shouting ‘
Healer Brisley – it took Harry a moment to recognise her – scurried in with a beaming smile. She cooed over him, asked him a list of questions, and had a stream of other Healers (but not
help me keep it together. My fingers scramble for purchase on Harry’s thighs.
The late hour and the rumbling in Harry’s stomach drove him to the kitchen. Kreacher had dinner ready – a slab of unspecified meat and cold mushy peas. Harry ate it without complaint, and made sure to mention how the protection charms on the fireplace could use refreshing. Kreacher’s snout-like nose twitched with interest, but he said nothing. Harry didn’t mind. He’d wear him down.
“I know, but the pile of post that was waiting for me at home makes me think you might be right. Either way, I just wanted to say that thanks to you, I’m a Mind Healing convert. I’m actually looking for someone to help me mentally manage that sort of stuff better.”
. Each angle of him is sharp, like he’s chiselled out of marble rather than made from flesh—but it adds an element of risk that I can definitely understand the appeal of. He’s cold and dangerous. He’d fall apart beautifully.
There were a hundred answers to that question, the first of which being that it hadn’t even occurred to him. But even if it had—it would have violated the professional/personal boundary that Draco (usually) insisted on maintaining. And there was the undeniable fact that a Legilimency connection was absurdly intimate—Draco doubted that any of his previous lovers would have wanted him in their heads. They wouldn’t have been able to repress any stray thoughts—
.” Draco’s voice—but Draco didn’t realise he’d said anything; he heard it through Harry, through Harry’s appreciation for the way he sounded, his control fraying, his vowels sharp and his consonants messy.
“We’ll stand guard,” the younger one said, winking. “You look so good together, by the way!” The sound of their fresh giggles was quickly muffled by the great wooden doors.
Potter shifts and raises a gentle hand to Draco’s jaw. Draco squeezes his eyes closed and whimpers. Any second now.
“Er, no,” Harry said hastily, dragging his eyes away from the ugly mark. “No duelling.”
“Not yet,” Draco said, shifting again, settling himself. “I want to enjoy this first. God, you feel good.”
Repeating this mantra to himself—
“Cruci–!” he had cried, his tear-streaked face contorted with rage, before he had collapsed onto the bathroom floor, blood spurting from his chest, his face.
I meet Harry’s gaze and open my mouth. It feels stupid—I haven’t, in fact, sucked even a single dick before, so I have very little idea what I’m doing—but Harry lets out a soft
Back to the Garden. They were in a greenhouse. The air was thick.
Healer Morgan, the hag, pursed her lips. “Yes indeed, Mr Potter,” she said. “He’s been here for a few years now. I put in a complaint, you know, when he was first hired—Death Eaters administering care to vulnerable patients, whatever next!—but I don’t mind telling you, I was categorically shut down. The standards of Healing have absolutely plummeted since I started in the field, it’s a disgrace…”
I nod frantically, earnestly. “You feel amazing. So good, Draco.”
Harry kissed him again – roughly, deeply, until Draco’s protests melted into those small, delicious noises of approval. Harry drank them up, swallowing each one greedily, then made his way south. He followed the lines of the ribbons with his tongue and raked his teeth over the peak of Draco’s nipple. Draco cursed, arched his back – and Harry licked further, further, ducking under Draco’s thigh until he lay on his stomach between Draco’s spread knees. Draco’s bound ankles rested on Harry’s back.
“Yeah.” Draco got to his knees, dazed, and lined himself up. “You ready?”
I thrust upwards again helplessly. His arse slaps against my hips. It’s a filthy sound and I immediately want to hear it again, so I shift my feet and fuck him as best I can—though my range of movement is limited by the two full-grown wizards I have on top of me. What a problem to have.
Ginny had been more disappointed than angry. There was always a case, she’d said. And Harry always had to be the one to do it, even though there was a whole Auror department. Harry had told her that she didn’t understand, he couldn’t go into detail, but this one – this one really was important.
It’s unclear which of us he’s talking to, but I feel myself flush anyway. Harry rolls his eyes, gratifyingly unimpressed with Malfoy’s theatrics.
“If this works,” Harry said, “don’t let me be an arse.” He allowed the depth of his feelings to roll through them in waves.
“It’s not your scar.” Ron said quickly, reassuringly. “It’s nothing like that. You lost your memory for a bit. For a few months. Do you remember?”
Malfoy was writhing, squirming, desperately trying to meet Harry’s punishing thrusts but lacking the leverage to do anything but dig his heels into Harry’s back. His head was thrown back – then lifted, Malfoy’s heated gaze raking over Harry – then thrown back again with a groan as Harry pounded in especially hard, Malfoy’s neck bared, the entire length of him stretched out, all Harry’s for the taking. And Harry did take – hard and fast and hot and deep and
” – strangled, like it’s been wrenched from him. His body seizes and his blood
The thrill of forcing Malfoy’s firm self-control to fray had never faded. Over the years, Malfoy had got better at hiding it, but Harry had got better at reading it. Back at school, Harry would never have noticed Malfoy’s jaw jutting as he bit the inside of his lip, nor the way he hid his hands under the desk to flex his thin fingers and thumbs into wrathful fists. But Harry knew him better now. He knew that the way Malfoy turned to the two-way mirror was a tacit petition for help.
Potter frowns at the bottle. Uncorks it. Downs it like a shot.
Half an hour after their meeting with Brisley and Malfoy, Harry ducked through the door into the pub. The barman grinned toothily and waved him towards their usual table. Hermione wasn’t there yet, but Ron was, fiddling with a broken Decoy Detonator with his tongue poking between his teeth. Harry had only just joined him when the bell above the door tinkled again and a harried-looking Hermione burst through. Harry waved, and she sagged, taking in his position next to Ron with obvious disappointment. Harry tried not to be offended.
Unlike someone else I know.
Draco goes cold.
“I’m inside you,” Harry repeated mindlessly, digging sweaty fingers into Draco’s sides. “You’re amazing. You’re my favourite person, Draco, fuck – God, so
Harry straightened Draco’s legs with a sharp tug and crawled over him. “You want fierce?”
Kreacher quietened immediately. “A job? For Kreacher?” Kreacher sniffed, dragging the back of his bony hand across his dripping nose.
Malfoy looked genuinely regretful, which was about the most stupid thing that Harry had ever seen. He shook his head vehemently. “You shouldn’t have had to mention it at all! And I certainly had no right to make such a fuss about it. You have no obligation to share personal details like that, you’re at work–”
“No,” Harry said. “No, nothing like that. It’s just, er … It was really boring.”
“He’s all right,” I allow, shaking my head to rid it of that last rogue thought. “If you like them pointy and inbred.”
He didn’t get a chance to find out.
Hermione bit her lip. “Yes. He was–”
“And are you offended?”
“There would be other signs if you were approaching any sort of deadline,” Malfoy continued. “Changes in your thought patterns, your physiology. So don’t worry about it.”
I start choking again, but he’s laughing.
He didn’t know who “him” was.
Harry’s legs gave out. He dropped into his chair.
Malfoy grabbed Harry’s arm. “It’s fine,” Malfoy said. Harry stared at Malfoy’s fingers wrapped around his bicep. Malfoy let go quickly. Harry still felt the echo of his grip. “Really. I think you have some things to discuss with your friends.”
That had been one of the things that had stumped him the first time, too. “So you’re saying I’m…
“Mmm – Harry–”
He looked accusingly at whoever had spoken, ready to tell them he was busy, and was disconcerted to find himself glaring at a teenage girl. She couldn’t be more than seventeen – her large eyes were set in a round face dotted with freckles.
“I might need a bit of help,” Draco said. “My legs are killing me.”
“Bedroom,” came the faint response. “Upstairs, first door on the left.”
“You’re a brilliant Mind Healer, Draco. You know that already. But you’re also unbelievably kind and patient. I mean it—I literally didn’t believe it, when I first got my memory back, but it’s true. You’ve grown so much since the War. It’s incredible, how you’ve overcome everything that happened to you. You should be so proud of yourself.”
Potter begins to squirm, his shoulders rippling, and Draco holds himself still, letting the hot clamp of Potter’s arse turn torturous, even when his legs start trembling, when the urge to thrust and fuck and take is overwhelming.
Harry’s throat
. And Harry Potter was crawling over him, his sinful robes dragging over Draco. Even through the layers of fabric that separated them, Draco was hyperaware of every brush of cloth, every slide of limb against limb.
So am I.
Draco waited for the punchline, but it didn’t seem to be coming. “Are you joking?”
My voice is rougher than I intend it to be when I ask, “So you’re saying…I can kiss him?”
“You can see it, right?” The wood of the door was visibly shaking with every thud. It really was like someone was behind it, banging to be let out.
Involuntarily, Harry locks eyes with himself. In the half-light, his familiar features are sinister.
Draco exhaled. His wand was already in his hand. When had he picked it up again?
It hit him, suddenly, that Draco was naked. All of Harry’s fantasies unrolled in his head, painfully close to being attainable. Harry didn’t stop lavishing attention on Draco’s neck – how could he, when Draco was groaning like that? – but he let his hand fall from Draco’s hair to his shoulder, finding the edge of ribbon under his fingers and unseeingly following its path as it circled Draco’s sternum, his ribs, his stomach…
Harry would have liked to make Malfoy suffer a little longer, but he himself felt as if he would explode if he didn’t fuck Malfoy immediately. He withdrew his fingers – a moan from beneath him – and lined himself up.
However.
“Well – I suppose so, yeah.”
Harry presses his thumbs into the soft flesh of Malfoy’s inner thighs, watches in fascination as the blood is forced away by the pressure, as it rushes back when he withdraws.
“I bet you can,” Harry said. “You’re brilliant. You’re fucking brilliant.”
Rescue comes again, unexpectedly, from Malfoy. “Don’t you dare.”
This time, Harry retained enough of himself that he didn’t collapse on the spot. He let Malfoy’s leg fall and sat on his heels, catching his breath, allowing his awareness to slowly expand away from Malfoy – beautiful, wrecked, come-smeared Malfoy. It had started raining at some point. A summer thunderstorm.
“You must let go together, gentlemen. On the count of three. One… Two…”
Brisley was beginning to look frazzled. Harry, who had been on the receiving end of Hermione’s intensity a lot over the last few months, sympathised.
“What is that supposed to mean?” Harry snapped. Parvati rolled her eyes and opened her mouth to respond, but Malfoy held up a hand.
. His stomach clenched and his mouth was open and his eyes
The corners of Malfoy’s mouth twitched, his eyes glinting above Harry’s grip. “Would it make you feel better to think so?”
“I don’t–” Malfoy swallows. His Adam’s apple bobs against Harry’s palm. “Trouser pocket.”
“So,” he said, lacing his fingers together and regarding Potter with his head tilted at a careful, open, interested angle. “How has it been, these last few weeks? You said you were fully signed off by Brisley?”
Slowly – so, so slowly – Draco sank down. Harry bit his lip against the aching heat and tightness. It felt like his whole body, not just his cock, was being enveloped by Draco. Harry wanted it. Welcomed it. He’d already been consumed by Draco, already belonged to him. It felt so
“He had to go,” Ron said abruptly.
Harry twists to look at him. I miss the weight of his attention immediately, but I’m also currently getting a pretty spectacular handjob, which definitely lessens the blow.
“Oh.” The world tilted. Maybe Harry was still a little drunk. “And … what was Ron saying about his brother? Did you…? I mean … I know one of them died in the War.”
“‘Quaffle’ if you want to stop,” he reminds me. I’ve barely nodded again before the head of his dick is pressing against me—pressing against Draco’s rim—forcing its way inside.
“Shh, I want to watch,” he says. “Go on, Harry.”
Of course, Harry had also fantasised plenty about fucking Draco, about having him naked and hard and begging. But there had never been any part of him that believed
“How about you last another twelve minutes?” Draco growls, and climbs off him.
A flash of panic shoots through him, and he focuses back on Potter to find him bare-chested, his shirt discarded on the floor at his feet. Draco’s mouth goes dry. He’s seen Potter undressed – they’ve shared a dormitory for months – but it’s never been for him before. He’s never been allowed to
Across the desk, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry. “I’m going to cast one more time and enter your mind again,” he said. “Now you know what to look for, see if you can identify the feeling of the spell. Do you need a moment to prepare yourself?”
Ron’s reaction was, admittedly, alarming; Ron was hardly shy about mocking people, but Harry had never heard him so outraged. How bad did someone have to be before laid-back Ron called them slimy and evil? And it wasn’t just Ron – there had been that tangible frostiness from Hermione, back in Brisley’s office. Who was Draco Malfoy? And what had he done to make Harry’s friends dislike him so much?
“And how do students traditionally get to school on September the first?”
Draco’s back arched and his bitten-off gasp trailed into a moan. “There! Again.”
My heart is pounding at double speed. This is mad. It’s mad, but I know for a fact I’d regret it forever if I said no. I’d be thinking about it for the rest of my life. I’d probably corner them in a few months’ time and beg them to ask again, and that would be awkward for everyone. So I nod, and say, “Yeah. Okay. Why not? If you’re sure. I don’t want to make anything weird. For you two, I mean.”
“Truthfully,” Malfoy said after a pause, “it wouldn’t take much to make me give in. That’s why you need to stop asking. Like I said, I’m not known for my strength of willpower when I’m being offered something I want.”
He can’t have actually
hadn’t he worn his bespoke Maison Capenoir robes? He hadn’t wanted to look like he was trying too hard, but the navy Twilfitt & Tattings ensemble he’d decided on in the end was excruciatingly plain in comparison to Potter’s mouthwatering get-up. Thank Merlin Potter’s hair was still an absolute state, otherwise Draco would have had to Apparate home after all out sheer shame. He forced a thin smile. “Shall we?”
“Consequences? Stipulations?”
He may not have a place in the story.
“It might take some getting used to,” the officiwizard said sympathetically. “Marriage contracts are old magic. I’m not sure it would pass Ministry safety regulations if it was submitted today, you know.” He seemed to notice the twin looks of alarm on Harry and Draco’s faces, and hastened to add, “There haven’t been any recorded cases of anything going wrong, of course! Not for at least a century. Of course, they’re not as popular as they once were, so that might have something to do with… I mean, you’ll be used to it in no time at all, I’m sure!” He laughed awkwardly. “Congratulations again, gentlemen!”
– all he’d done in the last four months was stay at home, spend time with Ron and Hermione and get poked at by Healers. Trying to file those memories into imaginary cardboard boxes did not make them any more compelling. And all too often, he’d found his mind drifting back to the day’s session, and to Healer Malfoy – his vicious glare, his bright laugh, his Dark Mark…
It’s a risky remark, but it pays off when Harry smirks and glances appreciatively at my dick. I resist the urge to preen.
Harry looked at him then, curiously. “Why not?”
“I was under the impression that you were taking advantage of my considerable knowledge of Mind Magic to attempt to regain your memory,” Malfoy said coldly.
So, when Malfoy said he wanted to teach Harry a new skill – how to focus on specific details within memories – Harry was quick to say, “Can you show me? Can I see in your head?”
“You keep saying that.” Harry’s voice came out hoarse. “I still don’t know what you mean.”
Anyway, that was why he was there, wasn’t it? Tea. That’s what Potter had said. Just a drink. Half an hour, in and out. No reason to get his hopes up.
A throb of panic pulsed through Harry before he realised that Malfoy was referring to the looming deadline.
“And I’m your Mind Healer, there’s so much baggage that comes with that–”
Unless…
It didn’t sound real. Then again, they were standing inside an imaginary room inside Harry’s head. Who was Harry to say that there hadn’t been another invisible door there the whole time?
“Would you stop wriggling?”
“Well,” he said once he’d completed his inspection. “I should head back home.”
Harry doesn’t wait for him to finish. He leans forward and swallows Malfoy whole. Malfoy’s cock is swollen with blood, thick with it, and the proximity of it – inside Harry’s mouth, so, so close to his teeth – is torture. Malfoy lets out a low moan, digs his fingers into Harry’s hair. Harry struggles to be careful, for now – covers his teeth with his lips, concentrates on lavishing attention on Malfoy. His blood is so much richer when he’s worked up like this.
“You know, putting resentful thoughts or doubts into a Pensive doesn’t remove the feelings behind them,” Malfoy said from the desk. “If you don’t trust me, you can’t put that aside. The Legilimency therapy won’t work.”
“If he’s so busy, what sort of timeline should we expect going forwards?” Hermione was saying. “We’re over halfway to the six-month deadline. There have already been so many delays.”
Usually I love the wordcount restrictions of drabbles but I was desperate for like 20 extra words on this one. D: Written for the January 2021 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge.
It was that being away from work meant being away from–
“Hey,” Potter says. “I really am sorry. I should have realised something was up. It’s just – when you said I was a stuck-up dickhead–”
“You actually came in for a book!”
Harry concentrated. It was, in a way, similar to the intangible Earl Grey scent of Malfoy – more like he was sensing it rather than hearing it. A dull repetitive pounding, coming from somewhere in the back of his mind.
The elf – Kreacher – didn’t seem too friendly, but also didn’t seem too surprised by his presence in the house. The elf had even called him ‘Master’. So … he did live here, then. This elf was his.
“Ah.” Malfoy paled. “Those … Those were true.”
“Harry,” he breathed, and Harry groaned.
The bedroom was too confusing. Jumbled memories clamoured for his attention. Harry knew that some of them were fantasies – they had to be, surely – but it was impossible to tell what was real and what wasn’t. Hanging over the lot of them was a haze of – was that … tea? His pounding head throbbed, and at two in the morning, Harry dragged his duvet and pillow to the spare room on the second floor, where he’d stayed with Ron during fifth year. The room was clean, tidy and clearly unused. It was a comfort. Harry was asleep within minutes.
Draco shakes himself. “Turn over,” he says roughly. “On your back. I want to see you.”
“We do,” Harry assured him, as if Malfoy hadn’t seen every single café, pub and restaurant Harry had been to over the last month. “This is the first time we’ve been here in weeks.” He grinned. “We really missed the rhubarb crumble.”
“Master,” he croaked, and bowed. “Do let Kreacher know if there is anything else he can do to serve.” Then, without waiting for a response, he snapped his fingers and disappeared.
“I must say, it has been rather nice, seeing so much of you these last few months,” Hermione chipped in, suddenly able to hear again. Ron exchanged an amused look with Harry. “You used to be so busy, Harry, we were lucky if we could squeeze in an evening every three months.” She beamed and clapped her hands together. “Anyway! Now that’s sorted, I don’t fancy cooking lunch today – shall we eat out somewhere? Leaky Cauldron?”
Potter—to look at him like that? “All right. I’m going to cast on three. One. Two. Three.
“Did … Did it not work?” he asked, trying not to sound disappointed. Malfoy was supposed to be amazing at this.
“Maybe I’ll bite you, let your blood soak into your pretty white shirt until it’s red and dripping, and then I’ll wear it.” Harry groans at the thought. “God, it would drive me mad. You drive me mad.”
“It’s a standard physiological process,” Draco says, still bristling.
Malfoy’s face betrayed no emotion. “Tomorrow,” he repeated. “Have you spoken to Weasley and Granger yet?”
Harry had been so distracted by the argument, by the thought of dancing, by Draco’s hand in the small of his back, that he hadn’t noticed Draco slowly leading them to the front of the room. They were standing alone in the middle of the dance floor, every face turned towards them.
“You would? Even though you don’t like who I am with my memories?”
“The power of being Harry Potter,” Malfoy muttered.
“I’m gonna fuck you,” Harry murmurs in his ear. “I’m gonna fuck you and I’m gonna bite you and I’m gonna suck you
“Your mouth,” Potter breathes. “Fuck, I love your mouth.”
“I want you to stay.” He says it so easily, like it’s the purest, simplest truth. “Please. If you want.”
Something in him recoils from the tar-like sludge, screams at him to
“Ignore him,” he says in a low voice. “He likes to pretend he’s in charge.”
“—but I’m not gonna last. This feels so—”
taking him apart. He’s still talking, filth and appreciation pouring from him in between cries of pleasure. I dimly register the fact that the bed isn’t squeaking—isn’t even rocking—despite the rough pounding of my hips. Probably made from some fancy foreign wood, soaked in Strengthening Solution and laced with Silencing Charms. Posh wanker.
He laid out the two letters – the one he’d just written, and the one Malfoy had sent – side by side, comparing the tone. Words had never been his strong suit, but he thought he'd done rather well. Anyone reading them would see nothing more than a civil correspondence between former schoolmates.
”Yes,” Malfoy said.
“There’s one more thing I’d like to do before we get stuck in,” Malfoy said. His pale eyes locked with Harry’s. He had a very intense sort of eye contact. Harry felt a little bit like Malfoy was looking straight through him. “I’d like to quickly test your magic, if you’re amenable.”
There was just so
“The way you put our history behind you when you took me on was amazing. I remember, those first few sessions—you snapped at me, like we were kids. You only did it a few times, then you pushed it down and never did it again. I couldn’t have done that. There’s no way. You’re so much better than me. So much better than so many people.”
Draco finally wins his battle with the buttons. He yanks Potter’s trousers down and immediately buries his nose in Potter’s crotch. He inhales deeply and lets Potter’s scent surround him, fill him. Potter’s dick presses against Draco’s face – fuck,
Hermione’s detailed instructions about the ritual seemed very far away in Harry’s mind, yet he knew exactly what to do. He drank from the bowl in one long gulp. In his peripheral vision, he saw Malfoy do the same.
“You should go in, I think. Draco will be happy to see you.”
Harry mumbled his thanks and skulked to the row of cupboards along the left wall. He couldn’t remember ever using a Pensieve – ever even seeing one – but he knew exactly what to do. He heaved the empty stone basin out of the cupboard and set it on the sideboard. He touched the tip of his wand to his temple.
Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up and his elbow slipped off the edge of his desk. “Ah – no,” he said in a strangled voice. “No, we – we did not.” He straightened the papers on his desk again, though they were already piled neatly. “We didn’t get along too well, actually.” He avoided Harry’s eyes. “We were in rival houses.”
He waits as long as he can. It’s not quite five minutes. It probably isn’t even three. But any longer and he’ll risk ripping the door off its hinges in his desperation to get upstairs.
“I – yes.” Harry watched with fascination as Malfoy’s expression settled into one of distant, polite professionalism. His thin shoulders pulled back into a clean line and he reached out to straighten the quill on his desk.
“Really take note of the sensations,” Malfoy murmured. “And compare it to the next memory. Hold on.”
“Because that’s when I got kicked out!” Despite Harry’s rough treatment, it was the first time in the last few days that Harry had heard an edge to Malfoy’s voice. “And then Gringotts wouldn’t let me in, and once Parkinson found out I was disinherited, she laughed in my face, and I wandered the streets of Muggle London for hours thinking about how you told me your address after my trial and I knew you would help and I – I wanted to see you, I’ve thought about it so much over the last few years but I didn’t think it would – I didn’t know you would – I never thought you’d say yes to this–”
“Why on earth did you do that?”
“Right now.” Harry straightened, convinced his idea was brilliant. “Look at what I’m thinking right now and tell me I haven’t wanted you for weeks.”
“Well, to tell you the truth…” Harry hesitates, then casts a
.” He lifts his unscarred arm from where it was squashed beneath him and settles it under his head. His soft cock shifts against my leg. “I just think it’s a conversation you should probably have. He won’t notice otherwise.”
Harry swears and thrusts upwards.
“Don’t rush,” Harry chides, but another finger joins the first at the base of my dick.
“Oh— No, I couldn’t possibly. The guests. And the contract…”
“Me too,” Harry said, and swooped down to wrap his lips around Malfoy’s cock.
“I’ve always been able to see it.”
“You mean aside from strengthening your mental control, which is the whole reason for you being here?”
“I do,” Malfoy murmured. “I mean it. Stay.”
“Let them in, Harry.” Harry couldn’t see Malfoy any more, but he could still feel him. “You can do this.”
“Erm, actually, do you want to join us?” The look of incredulity that overtook Malfoy’s face made Harry laugh. “I’m serious!” he said. “Hermione says it would be beneficial to be with you in a casual setting. It will increase our level of trust, or something.”
“My mental space,” Malfoy said. His voice echoed inside and outside Harry’s mind.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Stop panicking. I said it’s fine.”
Malfoy’s only response to Harry’s noisy entrance was a raised eyebrow. Harry muttered a greeting and slumped into the waiting wingback chair. Malfoy continued to write in his stupid notebook for what Harry considered to be an obnoxiously long time.
When he was a kid, Harry had never liked his birthday.
“Again,” Potter growls, but Draco is already moving, dragging desperate fingernails down Potter’s back and fucking him properly, gracelessly, instinctively chasing the heat, the tightness, Potter’s noises. Potter is clenching fistfuls of bedding and Draco feels it, feels the squeeze of it in his chest, around his heart, so he looks away, raking his eyes down the pink lines that show the echo of Draco’s nails on Potter’s back, traces them to where Draco’s fingers are digging into Potter’s hips.
Harry shrugged. Picked at the arm of the chair. “Hermione says being immersed in a familiar wizarding environment is helpful.”
Still stunned, Draco pulled out and cleaned up their mess with a fumbling wave of his wand, then hesitated. But then Harry’s hands were on him again, tugging him closer, sliding down his sides, squeezing his arse.
“No.” Draco raised his chin. “I’m your Christmas present.”
“I didn’t expect to see you today,” Malfoy said carefully, putting down his quill.
Harry’s heart was thudding so heavily that he was surprised his voice didn’t come out with a staccato beat. “So you didn’t mean it?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Oh, fine. If it would make you feel better.”
“Show me.”
Fuck, this charm. Draco’s mouth waters. He wants to taste him. He needs to taste him. He’ll never be able to look the real Potter in the face again, but the real Potter never pays him any attention anyway. Draco licks his lips, takes a steadying breath that doesn’t steady him at all, and takes Potter’s cock into his mouth.
“So,” he said, his voice coming out low and rough, “you never answered my question.”
No, the thing Harry disliked about Christmas wasn’t any of that.
Harry’s tongue meets mine and I let out a quiet gasp: I know Harry was drinking beer at the pub, but he tastes like
“I think it’s relevant,” Harry said.
“I’ll leave you two to catch up,” he said shortly. “I’m going to say hello to people. See you later.”
Harry kissed back immediately. Just like that. No hesitation. His entire body curled into Draco, pressed him against the counter in a mirror image of the memory Draco had just yanked them out of, and, fuck, it was everything. It was
His heart is pounding. His hand is unsteady; the glowing clock summoned by the
Harry shoots me a questioning glance, but I’m being so thick tonight that I don’t know what he’s asking. He bites his bottom lip—the lip that softened so sweetly under mine, fuck, what is
“Malfoy.” His voice was rough.
“I used to have a regular meeting with a Mind Healer here, you see, but recently he’s been scheduling other people in my spot.”
“He wasn’t dragged into anything,” Ron said stoutly. “He loved it, he bragged about it constantly when he got the Mark–”
, even though the talk of invitations and venues and caterers made Harry feel a bit sick.
As a rule, Harry didn’t like taking orders from anyone other than his superiors at work, and even then it irked him to be told what to do. On the other hand, Harry did really, really want to fuck Malfoy, so he decided to let this one slide. He lifted Malfoy’s legs onto his shoulders, tightened his grip, and began to move.
Harry imagined himself stranded in the middle of the Thames, the murky brown water replaced by silver memories. “That sounds hard,” he said.
“Never woken up with a stiffy before?” Draco snaps.
Harry quashed the butterflies that fluttered to life in his chest. “Oh?”
Harry’s anger, still simmering, flared. “You always do that.”
Harry whined in response, his body twisting, begging for more without words. “Please,” he gasped. “
“Oh.”
“You’re beautiful,” he murmured against Draco’s mouth, fingers tightening in Draco’s hair. “You’re so beautiful, all I want to do is look at you. And kiss you. God, I love kissing you.”
“See, it’s fine,” he says, and yep, there it is—his expression tips into enjoyment. A deep red has started to overtake the pretty pink flush of his face. “Look, I—
Draco can’t speak.
The problem is: Harry can’t stop touching Draco.
The officiwizard waved his wand and one bowl became two, though Harry did not see how it happened, did not see them separate or duplicate—it was as if there had been two bowls the whole time.
“She wanted me to be happy, too.”
Malfoy flinched, but took a deep breath and continued. “Whatever you want, then. If you pay…”
At the time, Draco intended to do no such thing. But, one throwaway remark from Potter, and here he is.
But, as Harry considered the issue while Ron and Hermione’s quarrel intensified, he found that he didn’t feel deterred from meeting Healer Malfoy again tomorrow. If anything, it was the opposite – he was almost excited to see what all the fuss was about.
“You’re so hot, Potter.” It’s so liberating to say it aloud. It’s so fucking painful. “You bastard. You stupid, untouchable bastard. You’re so hot.”
“Granger, I swear on all that is magical, if I have to come over there and shove him out of the door myself—”
“What am I supposed to be looking for? I thought it would be obvious.”
and refuses to accept that shagging his colleague disqualified him
Harry blinked. “Why?”
A desperate whine crawled out of Draco’s throat. He was drowning in feeling, inside and out. Harry’s hand on him was driving him closer and closer to the edge—and his words were provoking a similar build-up somewhere in his chest, behind his lungs, up his throat. Did Draco want to come, or did he want to cry? It felt like either could happen at any minute. He was at Harry’s mercy. He always had been.
His reflection smiles.
Malfoy watched him for a moment, then flicked his wrist. “
He spun on his heel without waiting for an answer. He half-expected Potter to comment on his rudeness, but Potter stood serenely next to him—close enough that Draco caught an unfamiliar yet tantalising whiff of his cologne (something dusky, spicy)—while Draco spoke with the head waiter, and followed Draco to the table without complaint.
They’re on their way to the library. Harry would rather not be on his way to the library, as the library contains no places to hide from the stares. But when Hermione is your closest friend,
“Of a kind, Ms Granger, of a kind.” Brisley smiled indulgently at them. “Now, let me just find my glasses, give me a moment…”
Harry’s heart warmed. His shoulders dropped. Suddenly, with the approval of his friends, all his doubts vanished. He knew he was doing the right thing. He really was ready.
Harry caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s impassive expression splintering into shock before he stormed out of the office and slammed the door behind him.
The apology had obviously taken some effort. Harry looked at his friend’s stupid remorseful red face and something untangled deep inside him.
Fuck.
“Do you remember when we first met? When I said I thought your memories weren’t lost? Just locked away?”
“Yes,” Harry said, too quickly, too panicked.
“You,” Malfoy said simply. Harry opened his mouth to tell Malfoy that he wasn’t making sense, but Malfoy cleared his throat and continued over him. “Anyway, it seems we agree that mistakes were made. I’m happy to put yesterday’s incident behind us if you are absolutely sure the particulars of my past will not impede your progress going forwards.”
Harry took him in one final time – stretched out on the bed, cleaned and healed but visibly, undeniably fucked. Then he turned, grabbed some Floo powder and stepped into the flames.
I’m not following the conversation at all, but Malfoy’s arse is my current favourite thing in the whole world, so I’m feeling generous. “Let him have whatever he wants, Harry,” I grit out. “Give him— Oh,
But if he hadn’t had his memories last year, that freckled teenage girl would still be in whatever awful situation she had been in. How many people could he have helped over the last six months? How many lives could he have saved if he’d been on duty as an Auror? How much good could he do in the world, once he could remember his place in it?
“Four.”
“That reminds me,” he said. “I have a present for you.”
Harry wondered what he was writing. ‘Harry Potter is an idiot’? ‘Patient 734 shows remarkable lack of any kind of mental function, not just memory’? He squinted at the page – then looked away guiltily when Malfoy glanced up at him. He tried to distract himself from the prickles of shame that crept up his spine. The shattered window and the burn on the wall from the duel yesterday had both been fixed, he noticed. Sunlight fell, buttery and warm, onto the dark wood of Malfoy’s desk.
By the ripe old age of twenty-nine, things had changed. Harry no longer disliked his birthdays; on July 31st, his friends piled into his house, bringing food and booze and laughter. They’d stay up late drinking and talking and making sure Harry was enjoying himself.
“Yes, but when you factor in the year at Hogwarts, the three years of training at St Mungo’s, the year-long research project and the incredible unwillingness of the Wizarding population at large to have anything to do with someone with a”—he gestured to his left forearm—“well. It was quite a tight schedule. But I couldn’t think of anything else I was even remotely good at.”
“You should put sun cream on,” he said gruffly.
He woke up in the middle of the night with a foggy head and a full bladder. He stumbled to the bathroom and took a piss, wincing at the sight of dried come on his cock. He showered for the first time in days, brushed his teeth until the taste of Malfoy was smothered in toothpaste, and went straight back to bed.
“Good morning. Beautiful day, isn’t it?”
“Granger mentioned you’ve spent some time here,” Malfoy said.
Malfoy took even longer to reply this time. When he finally spoke, his sentences felt heavy, as if he had carefully considered each word. “Since there is no guarantee of finding a culprit,” he said, “and no guarantee that, if such a person did exist, they could reverse what has been done to you, yes. I believe it is worth your while to pursue strengthening your own mental capabilities.”
“Never wanna stop touching you,” Harry assured him mindlessly, dragging his mouth over Draco’s jaw to his neck, starting at the sensation of silk against his lips. He’d quite forgotten about the ribbons.
Then again, he can definitely appreciate the value of a realistic storyline. This is tantalisingly believable.
The great wooden doors slammed open and two giggling women—the Greengrass sisters, possibly—burst through. They stopped dead when they saw Harry and Draco. The younger one’s eyes flicked to their laps. No—to their hands, which Harry belatedly realised were still joined. Draco straightened, tried to pull his hand away. Harry held on. He wasn’t entirely sure why.
“Ron!”
“Wow,” he said. “Is that Hermione’s research?”
"Then what?”
“Not being able to touch you is killing me.”
Harry couldn’t speak. When he hadn’t been gazing at Malfoy, distracted by thoughts of hot mouths and pale skin, he had spent the evening convincing himself that he didn’t mind if his memories never returned. He’d have to come clean to the press, and it would be a bit of a pain relearning everything he used to know, but it wouldn’t be so bad. He’d make it work. It might even be nice, starting afresh.
The collar of Malfoy’s shirt is red and wet. Harry’s eyes rake over it, over the dried blood on his neck, the two small puncture marks – already healed.
Malfoy was talking shit. “What do you mean, ‘if such a person did exist’? Of course they exist. I just need the Aurors to stop being useless and actually find them!”
Harry’s vision goes black. He has Malfoy pinned against the wall in half a blink of an eye. Malfoy opens his mouth to gasp, but Harry is on him before his sluggish human senses have caught up, and the sound is swallowed by Harry’s mouth before it can begin. Blood drips from Malfoy’s tongue, pools underneath it, and Harry forces Malfoy’s head back and laps it up, draws Malfoy’s tongue into his own mouth and sucks. It’s only a scratch, the flow of blood already slowing, but each drop shoots through Harry like hot, pure magic. Harry growls, sucks until the trickle is more of a torture than a tease. He tears himself away.
A younger Malfoy – short and sneering but unmistakable – gestured to a badge pinned to the front of his robes. The fifteen-year-old version of Harry scowled from ten feet away. The students in the stands were chanting something. Harry gazed up at them, fascinated. Had he recognised all these faces, once?
Draco’s stomach swooped, his cock aching from how ready he was, from how much he wanted. But he couldn’t help but drag this out, couldn’t help but stare at the incredible, impossible sight of Harry Potter desperately fucking himself on Draco’s hand. Each clench of his hole sent sparks of sensation up his arm, down his chest, straight to his cock.
It was only after Harry had rescued Luna from dancing with Blaise Zabini that he caught sight of Draco again. He was lingering alone by the buffet table, a champagne glass held loosely in his hand. Harry always felt a bit silly, holding a wineglass—his fingers always felt clumsy with such a delicate thing. But Draco thoughtlessly pinched the stem as if he’d been served champagne every day of his life, the glass held straight and sure even as he stared into space.
Malfoy made a small, desperate noise. “Fuck – don’t–” A bite on Harry’s earlobe. “Merlin, I bet you could tear right through – You’re so –
There are fingers at my belt. But Malfoy’s hands are on my neck, my chest. I tear my mouth away.
. God, he was close. In his mind, Malfoy leaned against the wall of the Leaky Cauldron next to him after their fight with Ron. In his mind, Malfoy dropped to his knees, right there in the alley, yanked open Harry’s robes and sucked his cock to the root. Harry imagined what it would be like to bury his hand in Malfoy’s hair. He imagined Malfoy looking up, his gaze locking with Harry’s. He imagined how it would feel if Malfoy cast
“Oh,” said Hermione softly from beside him.
He took a final second to allow the mustiness of the passageway to fill his lungs. Then, Hermione’s hand a firm pressure on his back, he opened his eyes, squared his shoulders, and pushed open the door to the main chamber.
“Master Harry?” The words felt strange in his mouth. “You mean … me?”
“And how was Malfoy?” The contempt was obvious in Ron’s tone.
“Where’s your wand?” he rasps.
“Don’t be stupid,” Malfoy sneered. “The Three Brothers? That’s nonsense. Something from a storybook.”
.” He rocks backwards, his arsehole clenching around me.
“Draco!”
A strange spark lit up inside Harry’s chest. It took him a second to realise that it was hope – something else he hadn’t felt for months. “Wait, what did you do? How did you do that?”
“Not at all,” Malfoy said, and Harry’s heart sank. Malfoy noticed his reaction. “I mean,” he corrected quickly, “I don’t
Harry laughed. He reached up and tugged Draco down by the neck into a kiss. “Don’t be sorry. Fuck. Don’t ever be sorry for that. It was amazing. Better than anything I ever imagined.”
“Ron, distract him.”
“Are you ready?” he breathed.
, right there—!”
“I can’t believe you’re making me rub my dick against Chudley Cannons boxers,” Draco complained, making no attempt to stop.
“Take some.” Malfoy presses his wrist to Harry’s mouth. “You can, you have it–”
On the morning of February 14th, Harry woke to an empty house. Malfoy had stayed at his old Kensington flat—another nod to tradition Harry thought was unnecessary, but, as usual, his opinion had not been consulted.
. I thought–”
Now he’s said it, I do remember. I flex my fingers around Draco’s wrists. Draco licks his lips.
Harry shook his head. “Fine, never mind,” he said. “But in the New Year, I’m going to think up something awful for you to do, and then you’ll be sorry.”
It’s not weird. It should be weird—I’m standing in Draco Malfoy’s posh bedroom, kissing my best friend—but somehow it feels normal, like something we’ve always done. The shape of Harry against me is so familiar, so beloved. I snake an arm around his back and pull him closer, open his mouth, deepen the kiss.
Some more red hair was ahead of him. Harry gratefully followed the beacon of it until it sharpened: Ron, his best man, a solid presence at the front of the room. And behind Ron…
“They said it might,” Hermione said sympathetically. “They said your memories will settle back into place over the next week.”
Hermione’s mouth twisted in a strange way – as if she was trying not to smirk. “Of course,” she said, turning back to Malfoy, “I’m sure Healer Medlar is incredibly skilled. But I never got the impression that he had taken the time to really familiarise himself with Harry’s case.”
, which twists into an
Draco held a hand to his heart, his mouth falling open in outrage. Harry allowed himself half a second to look at the parted lips, the glimpse of pink tongue, then focused on the blackboard. He’d be hearing
Harry mouths an apology and re-casts the spell to surround Malfoy’s chair too. I just sit there, frozen by the memory of Neville’s stag do. I thought we’d had an agreement, Harry and I, to pretend it never happened. I’ve certainly done everything I can to force it down, to act like I don’t remember the feeling of his jaw under my hand, his breath on my lips. I don’t understand why he even brought it up—usually I’m pretty good at that sort of thing, at making connections and puzzling out motivations, but my brain keeps getting stuck on the memory of the taste of
Malfoy sucked Harry’s cock with purpose, and through the thickening cloud of pleasure, Harry struggled to process what was happening. Twenty minutes ago he’d been alone in his study, almost tearing his hair out in frustration. Now, he was in a dingy room in the Leaky Cauldron with his dick in Draco Malfoy’s mouth, almost tearing Malfoy’s hair out in frustration. And Malfoy was so damn good at this…
“Draco?”
Harry nodded, then realised he wasn’t sure how physical gestures worked inside someone else’s mind. “Er, yeah.”
Harry glared. Malfoy met his gaze with a raised eyebrow—his expression bordered on bored.
“Does the image in your mind look like it came from a book?”
“It did work,” Harry breathed, and Malfoy laughed. The sound was strange – it came from behind the image of Ron and Hermione, but it echoed inside Harry’s head. He remembered Malfoy’s bright, delighted laugh yesterday after the duel. The Leaky Cauldron warped and became Malfoy’s office again, but the office as it had been yesterday: the furniture cleared, Malfoy standing across from him, his hair ruffled. Harry felt his face grow hot.
Ron and Hermione both turned to look. The man averted his eyes, abashed.
The humour disappeared from Malfoy’s face as if it had been wiped clean. “Oh, forgive me, Weasley. I should have known you wouldn’t understand.” His tone was achingly polite. “The joke is that twelve hours is quite a long time to spend reading case notes. Of course, I can’t imagine you’ve spent more than twelve hours reading over the entirety of the last ten years.”
“You look nice today, by the way,” Harry said by way of greeting.
“Draco.”
“Malfoy,” Malfoy said.
Draco’s head dropped backwards. He was restless, not quite impaling himself on Harry’s fingers but definitely meeting each thrust, his hips rising, his thighs flexing. He was making these restrained little noises, biting off each one before it could become a gasp, letting out another immediately after.
It’s only because of the winter holidays (starting early this year so the Astronomy Tower can be repaired while most students are away, and isn’t Draco just looking forward to
Malfoy’s face was pinched, unpleasant. Harry couldn’t stop staring.
The thud of Harry’s heartbeat was loud in the silence of the room.
, and Draco’s last lingering remnants of self-control shattered.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “It might surprise you to learn that I am actually fairly well-respected within this field, Potter,” he said with unexpected venom. “There are several other things I could be occupying myself with if you consider my services beneath you.”
Goddamn it. Malfoy looked truly pitiful. What sort of person would Harry be if he slammed the door in Malfoy’s face, knowing that Malfoy had come to him for help?
“Weren’t you gonna fuck me, Malfoy?” Potter murmurs into Draco’s ear. Draco shivers. “Or am I too insufferable for that?”
“Oh, sure,” Harry said. “There was a person perched on the pier with me.”
A thrill goes down Draco’s spine. So it begins.
“Why not? We’re married, aren’t we?”
Draco knows that the fantasy Potter will probably forgive him. He knows it will make his real life so much more painful if so. He knows he’s going to chase it anyway.
as it is!”) still quietly murmuring, the screen glazing the dark room with a flickering blue glow.
That morning, there had been one such message from the Auror in charge of Harry’s case – someone Harry had apparently worked with a lot over the last five years. Harry had had no idea who she was, obviously, but he’d liked her well enough at first. His good opinion dwindled with every subsequent letter.
Harry sighs and nods gloomily. He waits for Hermione to lead the way – her glare is the most effective way of scaring off eager fans – but Pince’s talon-like hand falls onto Hermione’s shoulder.
“The Aurors are investigating every property owned by known Death Eaters to make sure nobody is hiding anything nasty,” Hermione said, when Robards seemed stumped by the idea of
“‘Potentially’?” Harry repeated.
Harry had no idea how he was going to keep himself from coming spectacularly as soon as his dick touched the rim of Malfoy’s arse. All thoughts of stopping had entirely gone from his mind. There was no way he could leave. Not when Malfoy was looking at him like that.
But instead of chuckling politely, Harry’s looking at me, his gaze oddly intense. “Ron,” he says slowly.
When Pomona Sprout asked him at the wedding, Harry was unsure of what their living arrangements would be post-honeymoon. But, as it turns out, the contract decided that for them too: they are required to live together in a marital home—that is, a property with both of their names on the deeds. Unable to banish the thought of Sirius’s outraged face from his mind, Harry flatly refused to add Draco to the Grimmauld Place records. In revenge, Draco refused to add Harry’s name to the deeds to the Manor, to his Welsh cottage, or to his Kensington flat—which Harry thought was ridiculously petty, and was not shy about saying so.

Hermione’s hand found Ron’s thigh again. “Draco,” she said warmly. “Harry has told us so much about your sessions with him; they sound fascinating. Please, do sit down.”
But Draco had kept tripping up—whenever Harry caught him unawares, whenever he did something so incredibly
, Draco wanted him. “The things you think you feel could just be a product of that false intimacy.”
Draco shivered. “Yeah,” he managed to say. “You would have put the entire hospital at risk, you brute.”
Obviously, there was the thing with Hermione. But that’s hardly my fault—Hermione’s brilliant, isn’t she? Everyone who knew her in school fancied her. Of course, not many people actually got to know her properly—most other kids avoided us, either because they thought Harry was a nutter, or because they thought Harry was intimidatingly famous, or because they thought Hermione was a massive pain in the arse. And that’s fair, because all three were true. But take Neville, for example: not bothered in the slightest by all the Boy Who Lived shit, but absolutely obsessed with Hermione. I mean, he was too scared to say more than three words to her, but still. I wasn’t the only one in the dorm mooning over her.
A flash of impatience.
“As if you won’t try to ruin me anyway. Isn’t that what this is about?”
Malfoy took the wand with tentative fingers.
Draco nods, captivated, and follows suit. Potter hesitates with his fingers at his waistband, so Draco goes first, pulling his shirt over his head, emerging with an unpleasant jolt to the sight of the
Draco’s cock twitched and Harry’s eyes fell to it. “Can I…?”
Draco looked down at himself. “Do you like them? I thought silver and green would be funny. But they’re colour-changing, so if you’d rather something different…”
The kiss had lasted much longer than Harry had expected it to. It was still over too quickly.
. “Ah, sorry. Was that too much?”
“Oh.” Harry had been quite proud of the work he’d put in to making up this stupid room. He’d considered everything from cosy sitting rooms to rolling fields to rustic inns – but it was only when he’d become frustrated with the same four straight walls boxing him in and imagined this particular space that something had clicked. He had been surprised at how
Malfoy visibly shook himself. “Sorry. You reminded me of someone for a moment.”
He leant against the brick wall of the Leaky Cauldron, his head tilted back, and let out a slow breath. Malfoy came to stand wordlessly beside him.
“I rather thought there’d be more angst-ridden foreplay,” he said, audibly trying for his usual careless tone but falling a fair distance short, “but I’m happy to jump straight in if you’re really in the mood–”
Harry glanced at the towering two-way mirror that made up the right wall of the interrogation room. The weight of unseen observers hung heavy in the air. The weight of the shackles around his wrists was worse.
“Malfoy. Where is your wand?”
Malfoy made a show of penning something on the parchment placed on the table between them.
“I sense you’re about to tell me.”
Malfoy’s pulse thuds, and an echo of it thrums through Harry, as if the blood Harry has already taken is answering the call of Malfoy’s heartbeat. Harry buries his nose in Malfoy’s neck. He smells so
low, though? I’m fine.”
“What are you waiting for, Potter?” he sneers – tries to sneer.
Their mouths met, Malfoy’s fingers digging again into Harry’s shoulders. Harry found himself reaching back to sharply squeeze Malfoy’s arse, and Malfoy made another delicious whimper that shot straight to Harry’s groin. But he wasn’t pliant for long – one more bite to Harry’s lower lip, and Malfoy shoved him to the side. Harry fell back onto the bed.
When Harry finally lifts his head, Malfoy is sprawled on the bed, his limbs loose. Harry retains just enough of himself to focus on Malfoy’s pulse points – his heartbeat is fast, but strong enough – then he rolls Malfoy onto his front and leans over him.
“I did try–!”
After six months, the Healers had said, the likelihood of regaining lost memories dropped to almost zero. Six months had felt like a long time back in February. Now, at the end of May, it felt like no time at all.

.” His scarred chest rose and fell rapidly. “Are we still roleplaying or are you serious?”
Draco tips his head back and savours the sweet silence. He finally has the dormitory to himself. It’s about fucking time.

“God.” Harry kissed Draco again, then lay on his back in Draco’s spot on the bed. It was still warm from the heat of him. Harry was too hot, sweat prickling over his skin, but he relished the echo of Draco’s body on the soft sheets.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, soothing, so soothing. “I know it’s a pain, but it will ground you. What can you see?”
Harry thought about it. “I was on the pier,” he said. “Watching walruses.”
It was amazing, the power of being pressed into Harry-scented bedsheets by a warm body and a hot mouth. Any thoughts that Draco had that weren’t related to the weight of Harry on him were swept away by an immediate tidal wave of lust.
“What if I just – never open it?”
this?”
Draco cleared his throat. “Either way,” he said, straightening, armouring himself in Malfoy bravado like Harry had watched him do hundreds of times before. “Would you mind closing the door? You’re letting in a draft.” He gave an exaggerated shiver.
“I thought you said you weren’t a Healer.”
“And I said you don’t need to be,” Harry counters. He glances towards Malfoy again. “Listen,” he says in a low voice. “I couldn’t tell you at the time, but the only reason I stopped you was because I’d just started seeing him.” He jerks his head to the bar, where Malfoy is levitating drinks onto a tray, snapping when the bartender tries to help.
“I’m uncomfortable,” he complains. “I love a post-fuck cuddle as much as the next person, but I also need to
“Would have been worth it,” Harry said. “Hold on.”
“That’s not the point! What about when you’re not there to cover his stingy arse?”
The hand-holding was not the worst part. The bottom tier was innocent enough: a tiny Harry was surrounded by tiny Weasleys, and a tiny Draco was flanked by a tiny Lucius and Narcissa. A tiny nougat Hogwarts Express stood between them.
He tentatively offered the owl a treat. It took it in its tiny beak and flew off without a backwards glance. He unfurled the scroll.
Malfoy snorted. “He’s practically smiling at you there. But, for now, direct your attention away from memory and try to focus on the feeling of me in your mind. Once you can identify a foreign presence, you’ll find it easier to learn your own mental boundaries and to control what you see.”
it was suspicious. He’d known it, had gone to Malfoy to confront him and then – what? Malfoy had batted his eyelashes, said he was innocent, and Harry had believed him?
right now and told you to think of anything but an erumpent, I know exactly what we would both see.”
I still don’t know what Draco is asking, but triumph flares through me on his behalf—that is, until Harry gets off the bed, leaving my chest cold and my mouth empty.
“Again?”
“Bollocks.”
“Joking,” Harry said quickly. “Hang on, let me think.”
I was right, earlier: he does look amazing when he falls apart.
Besides, he’d likely be spending the rest of his life doing ostentatious things to appease Draco Malfoy. So, at quarter past eleven, Harry squared his shoulders, tucked Malfoy’s note into the pocket of his stupid fancy robes, and strode determinedly to Highbury & Islington tube station.
“Yes,” Harry said. “If you want to.”
Harry, please – God, you’re – You’re going to have to stop, you’re gonna make me come – You’re gonna make me come in your mouth,
