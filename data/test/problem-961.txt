He notes the way Harry’s nostrils flare, the way his lips thin, an angry frown creasing his brow for a moment before his face smooths out again.
!” Harry says loudly, taking another step towards him. But Malfoy is spinning on his heel, his hair flying around him, and almost running for the stairs, the shine of tears on his cheeks unmistakable in the bright orange flare of the fire. “MALFOY!” Harry immediately lurches forward.
When I finally wrench myself away, we’re both hard and Draco looks completely out of it. He’s dazed to the point where he’s slightly cross-eyed, his lips are so fucking red from being sucked on that I want to suck on them some more, and he’s completely pink in the face, slightly sweaty at the temples.
“This is my home,” Malfoy says, still using that same flat voice. “These are my parents. This is where I belong. Why would I live with you anymore?”
And yet she stands there, bushy brown hair practically bristling around her as she stares (glares) at Draco.
“I thought you might like some company in here,” Harry replies blandly, looking vaguely disappointed as Draco shuts the curtain on him and exits the bathroom.
Harry’s eyes went very wide and innocent. “You’d miss him,” he said gravely. Draco glared and held up his dirty clothes in reply. “You’re cute when you’re mad,” Harry said with a small smile—or rather, smirk.
Draco has a hard time hiding his grin of amused exasperation. “Potter, would you just drink the damn dose, already?”
“Would you...care to maybe stay? For dinner, I mean,” Potter hurriedly adds. “Here—for the—for dinner—eating— purposes...”
that it was intentional and yet his first impulse is to assure me that he doesn’t hold it against me – that he’s not going to blame me for it...
but then I notice that Draco’s left hand is firmly entwined with Tristan’s right and I want to shrug his head off my shoulder in irritation.
take care of Draco, and in dozens of different ways, but never in a way that asks to be noticed or thanked. Low, cushioned stools have sprung up everywhere in the house for Draco to rest his feet on where he sits; an elaborate kit of Muggle lotions and skin care products was left on Draco’s bathroom counter one evening after he’d gone to breakfast earlier that day with mild rashes down his neck, grumbling about the dry, itchy skin on his belly; crates of more books and a brand new Wireless waited for Draco in the library one morning, and the batty old house-elf dutifully loads Draco’s plate with fresh fruit and vegetables every day.
in each other’s vicinity with nothing but hate for each other, nothing but insults and crude trash talk. The only times they
clean. The flagstones underfoot have been scrubbed spotless, and the copper pots and pans hanging overhead gleam blindingly bright. There’s an enormous, stone fireplace on the opposite wall where a fire crackles brightly, what appears to be an empty stew pot sitting on the floor beside it. There’s a large cooking range on the left, atop which sits a frying pan, sizzling quietly, while a tea kettle hums to itself on the counter beside it. Some sort of Muggle coffee appliance sits next to the kettle, and Draco can see, as well as smell, the rich aroma of the dark brown, steaming hot liquid in the tall, glass pot.
, so what can one expect? It had taken me surprisingly no time at all to get used to it, Draco unthinkingly touching me every now and then, when we’d first started spending time together. Ron spent several months flinching wildly and squinting suspiciously every time Draco so much as even casually slapped him on the back, but now he doesn’t even bat an eyelid when Draco invades his personal space –
Draco rolls his eyes. “Potter, that’ll just require some paperwork to be rerouted my way,” he assures him.
then, you will pop in and Apparate me out of there, is that clear? You will not linger for more than the time it takes you to grab my arm and bring me out to safety. Do you understand?”
Unable to read anything in his expression, Harry stared back. Even devoid of conscious emotion, Malfoy’s countenance bore a certain hostility, pale eyes like razors. Harry supposed that to those unused to him, Malfoy might come across as slightly unsettling; frightening even. But he knew Malfoy to be all bark and no bite. He couldn’t find it in himself to be afraid of him; or be worried about him in any way at all.
Harry had visited Draco in the hospital wing the next morning, had silently seethed at the sight of his puffy, bruised face, the way he’d lain limp and unmoving as he’d stared impassively up at Harry through the one eye that wasn’t swollen shut. When Harry had asked him who the people responsible were, Draco had chuckled darkly and pointedly turned away from Harry.
“Draco is not moving back in here.” Harry’s voice sounds loud and deep in the silence that had fallen; there’s a flicker of disbelief in Malfoy’s eyes and Harry suddenly can’t go on any longer without telling literally anybody who would listen about how he feels. “Draco is coming back with me. He’s coming home with me.” He never looks away from Malfoy as he says it. “Why would the man I love stay anywhere else?”
Potter tosses his head back and barks out a loud, tickled laugh, twinkling at Draco. “I’m going to let you have a taste tomorrow,” he says with wicked intent.
in his eyes at that moment that to Draco, it feels as though they’re already kissing, as if they’re already naked against one another.
Draco made an impatient sound through his own laboured breathing. “And what? You want to ensure everybody knows about us before we leave? Hold my hand in the corridors? Snog me at breakfast? Undress me and fuck me in front of everyone during dinner? Oh, shut up!” he said irritably as Harry’s grin grew filthy and he squeezed Draco’s arse as if in approval of Draco’s suggestion. “What do you want?” he asked on a sigh, combing the wild black fringe off Harry’s forehead and gently flicking the pad of his thumb over his scar.
“That’s what I called you over to talk about,” Erickson says, shrugging as he leans back again. “You’ve got feelers around everywhere, don’t you? You’re always up-to-date on these matters.”
Draco can’t stop staring at him after a point. And when Draco’s fluffy grey cat slinks into the room, meowing loudly and sullenly in his post-nap disorientation, Potter looks outright delighted for someone who’s supposed to be...part-dog or something.
Potter’s face falls again, guilt and a slight hint of resignation creeping in. “I didn’t think it would matter to you beyond the sheer absurdity of it.”
Malfoy stiffens where he’s hunched over the kettle, and Harry hears him draw a deep, seemingly calming breath. “About five years, give or take.”
I saw him at work a couple of weeks after I’d kissed him. We’d passed in the corridor as I was on my way to my office. Ron was with me. He hadn’t known back then that Draco and I had called it quits. He was blathering on about something as Draco and I had locked eyes; he’d looked perfect that day, just like he did every day. His gaze had fallen and I’d looked away. When we’d passed, Ron had smacked Draco over the head with the file he was holding and had hooted with glee that Draco hadn’t been quick enough to dodge it. Later on in the office, he’d asked me if that had seemed weird because Draco
Malfoy’s nostrils flare and he impatiently tugs at his scroll again, almost ripping it. “He’s that special, eh?”
Potter barks out a laugh. “You’re hilarious, Malfoy,” he replies lightly, scratching Caesar behind the ears so that the cat nearly falls out of his arms trying to lean further into his fingers.
Resisting the impulse, he drains his mug and dumps it in the sink, and returns Lyra to her chair before carefully edging the slabs of chocolate out of Scorpius’ reach. “What else are we serving?” he asks, pulling over the cookbook and skimming through the recipe.
Draco shivers, and ridiculously enough, arches under Potter, baring his neck, his breath ragged, gurgling moistly in his throat. He hears a swift, sharp inhale and then Potter says, careful and hesitant, “Malfoy?”
Now Malfoy stares at him in silence. “No,” he says firmly after a beat, seemingly unaware of the way his hands cradle his stomach. “
Malfoy was now fighting to lift the other sleeve enough to push his right hand into and all Harry did was sit there and stare, with a complete lack of shame, at his pink cheeks and his long neck and his scarred chest until he was staring at his lap and imagining what it’d be like to pull of the covers and look at the erection that had just poked him in the side.
about what happened to you, Potter, if that’s what you’re thinking,” he suddenly bites out. “I’m not thrilled about the life you’re living now, the things you have to go through on a daily or monthly basis.” Potter just raises his eyebrows, thick forearms, bulging with veins under a smattering of dark hair, still crossed. Feeling oddly defensive, Draco blurts, “I’m sorry. I’m
“Move in with me,” Harry repeats. “Move into Grimmauld Place with me.” Malfoy still looks like he’s waiting for the punchline, so Harry hurries to continue, “There’s plenty of room, Malfoy, and I have an elf who cooks and cleans and you’d not want for a thing over there.”
“I am regretting this so much,” Draco sighs, rubbing at one temple, “Why should I care if you turn into an antisocial lunatic?”
But I’m not paying attention to anything but Draco; Draco’s lips, moving against mine; Draco’s mouth, sweet and tasting of champagne; Draco’s long fingers clenched in my hair; Draco’s soft cheek beneath my palm, his wiry body being bent backwards within the circle of my arm. It feels like my very first kiss. It feels like nothing has ever existed before this. It feels like this is the beginning of my life, like I’m being brought more and more to life the longer I kiss Draco.
“And I accidentally woke him up while I was leaving and then...activities ensued,” Draco had said idly as he’d accepted the loaded plate Hermione had been holding out to him, nodding his thanks.
,” Hermione sighs, “can we reserve the name-calling for another time? Malfoy,” she pats the table again, “if you please. You simply need to undo the buttons over your midriff; you are not required to strip completely.”
He waited for the frenzied disbelief at what had just happened to flood his mind; for the jarring surges of panic and regret.
,” Granger presses, as she approaches his bench, “what are you--?” She breaks off abruptly, and when Draco looks around, he sees her staring, fascination clear on her face, as she heads towards the small, round pedestal in the centre of the room.
Kreacher trots up at that point, laying a broad, creamy white envelope with a red and gold seal on it next to Harry’s bread plate; it’s easily recognisable and very familiar even before Harry carelessly turns it over and reveals the Ministry of Magic emblem.
my filthy mouth, Potter,” he quips, pressing his tongue flat against the smooth softness and licking all the way up to the edge of Potter’s bright green boxers.
When he felt Harry trying to pull away yet again, he growled and brought his teeth down over his lower lip, letting his displeasure be known by biting repeatedly until Harry let out a little snarl and deepened the kiss with a vengeance, sucking on his lips and licking around inside his mouth until Draco was forced to pull back with a long, desperate gasp.
But then Potter is releasing him and that look has vanished, leaving behind a serene sort of friendliness. Draco’s hand falls limply to his side and Potter smiles at him. “Thank you,” he repeats.
“To the birthday boy,” Potter raises the vial to Draco with a rather pained expression before throwing down the contents in one go as usual, hacking violently until Draco pushes a glass of water at him, “Thanks,” he mutters, eyes watering as he chugs it down. There’s silence again as Potter catches his breath, and then, “So...er...I thought we’d go to dinner.”
Malfoy looked up at that, mouth slightly open, grey gaze genuinely surprised. He’s not very pointy anymore, Harry thought. His features carried the same air of sharp perfection that his mother’s did, but Malfoy’s appearance didn’t have that piercing severity to it anymore. He appeared almost...soft in the yellow library light, fair hair tumbling into his eyes, his keen gaze wary as he considered Harry’s question.
“Counsellor Truman,” he greets lightly, nodding once and quickly moving towards the door, pulling out a length of black ribbon from his other pocket as he walks. He skirts a wide circle around the old man with the cloud of white, candy floss like hair standing a mere couple of feet away but even so, the man turns on the spot as Draco walks, openly sniffing the air and sighing, eyes unfocused.
“You made the right decision, contacting and telling Harry,” she says firmly, but with an almost untraceable hint of sympathy. “At least you didn’t assume it was a tumour and panic.”
Draco jumps, almost falling out of his chair as Octavia’s loud question startles him right out of his daydreaming.
It’s a deep, brownish red scar. There’s a chunk of flesh missing, just where his shoulder curves into his back, and the skin over it looks shiny and thin, like a piece of rubber stretched too taut. Around the edges of it, the skin still bears the signs of magical sutures, carefully knitted into the smooth skin of his shoulder. Even healed, it looks painful and raw and Draco can’t help it when he bites down hard into his lip, tearing his gaze away.
Draco gnaws at the rim of the little divot of his belly button, smiling into it when Harry squirms, pressing his tongue flat against the fine hairs and licking over them, from the edge of Harry’s trimmed pubes up to his navel, again and again and with unwavering intent, all the while ignoring Harry’s cock where it lies against his hip, heavy and leaking. Harry moans again, bucking sharply, and Draco curls his hands around his hips, thumbs pressing into his hipbones as he pins him down.
fucking fact that he’s had sex (twice!) with Draco sodding Malfoy. His back feels sore, his legs stiff and heavy, and eventually, his cock slips out, wet and soft, of Malfoy’s arse.
Calmly sipping some water, Draco remains silent for a while longer, Granger watching him with an expectant, shrewd look on her face and Potter seemingly on the verge of bursting as he shifts towards Draco.
Weasley waits through Draco’s caustic rambling, his expression bored more than annoyed. “Are you done?” he finally asks.
“I’ll get there when I get there, love,” Draco informs him gently, wry amusement not fully masking the promise in his tone.
“Fuck, you’re whipped, aren’t you?” she says pulling a face and punching his shoulder with a grin. “Of literally all the blokes you could’ve knocked up and fallen for, it
Sighing through his nose again, Malfoy purses his lips, staring down at the floor between his knees. “I can—I can do this by myself,” he says softly, voice oddly small and uncertain as his lower lip juts out in a familiar, stubborn pout.
He bucks his hips forward and I groan at the friction, denim covered cocks rubbing roughly together, bony fingers in my hair, and sharp teeth at my jaw.
Malfoy looks up, tossing aside the last of his shredded tissue, leaning back in his seat, expression shuttered and cool.
“Mate, I think Malfoy is just tired,” Ron suddenly supplies and both Hermione and I turn to him, taken aback. He looks from her to me, looking like he regrets having spoken at all, but then adds in a mumble, “It’s looked that way to me for a while, at least.”
It reminds him of the Hogwarts library at first, innumerable, towering shelves extending all the way up to the high ceiling, stacked with rows and rows of books, all of them, judging by their musty scent and cracked spines, centuries old. Reading tables line the walls on either side, grimy windows Charmed to let in weak sunlight, dust motes dancing lazily in each broad shaft of yellow filtering in.
“Skipped dinner last night?” he teases lightly, lips quirking up in amusement. Malfoy’s lip, in turn, curls slightly, nostrils flaring again, his expression of haughty disdain so familiar that Harry almost laughs. “I didn’t mean to insult,” he says, stifling a grin. “Go ahead and eat something else if you want; I’ll pay.”
Instead, still maintaining eye contact, he raises his pint to his mouth and takes a long gulp. Draco wants to
He’d been with Harry at the tattoo parlour when he’d gotten the twin black paw prints in memory of his godfather (Harry had jokingly referred to him as his ‘dogfather’ and had then laughed at his own joke for twenty minutes), a complete moon cycle in a gradient of grey in memory of Remus Lupin (elegant and also strangely titillating but Draco had never told Harry that), the bright, fiery phoenix as a tribute to Albus Dumbledore (and to the bird itself, as Harry had insisted), a beautifully illustrated cat to pay homage to Minerva McGonagall (complete with the exact same markings around the eyes), a pink umbrella with miniscule sparks shooting out the pointed end for Hagrid (something Draco hadn’t really understood at first but had just accepted because it made Harry smile that crinkly-eyed smile for a long time) and the deathly hallows symbol which Harry got inked right underneath the scar that the horcrux had left on his chest.
Draco doesn’t have much choice but to meet Potter’s flat, almost entirely black gaze because Potter still has Draco’s hair in his grip, fist tightening very close to the scalp so Draco can do no more than just about blink without risking having a chunk of his hair torn out. He wants so desperately to be angry, to feel humiliated, at being
wearing an outrageously ghastly, maroon jumper with a giant, green ‘H’ on the front, and his house scarf coiled loosely around his throat, the pilled wool catching on the rough stubble on his jaw whenever he moved his head.
"She's a bit of a sadist is more like," Narcissa muttered under her breath to Molly making the other woman chuckle.
Feeling the fist around her heart tighten, Andromeda flipped her hand over and wrapped her fingers around Narcissa’s, palm to palm. “You have me now, Cissy,” she offered with a sad, understanding smile. “And hopefully I have you as well?”
"Dudley Dursley," Dudley returned, setting Chrissy on her feet before he took Draco's hand in a shake. "And this is Chrissy."
Lucius gave him a curt grunt in approval before turning back to his papers and glancing them over trying to remember what he'd been wanting to discuss with Potter before that
"Well, that took longer than I had expected," Lucius drawled as he held his cane under his arm and smoothed down any rumples in his robes.
Having said this he turned away from the window and looked at his in-laws, his adoptive parents, expecting reproof, outrage, anger. No matter how justified or amicable a marriage severing was still frowned upon. He was only met with sad resignation.
Harry chuckled to himself slightly hysterically as he splashed water on his face and dried it off. Since when had Draco Malfoy become beautiful to him?
Five minutes later, Lucius had conjured three more chairs for the children. He was leaning back in his own seat behind his desk, elbows resting on his armrests, and hands folded together above his lap waiting for everyone to get settled.
His children on the mend, with a stumble here and there, Harry decided it was time to start looking to the future. He just never thought he’d be deferring to Lucius’s expert opinion.
"Well, we hadn't seen each other for nearly ten years until a little over a month ago." He told her not sure how she’d take it that he’d started moving on barely a couple of days after Ginny had left.
Over their heads Draco could see Dudley and Marianne exchanging surprised, pleased looks. Straightening up once again he turned to grin at the other two adults.
"Ah, Ronald." He smiled and shook Ron's hand. "Thanks for coming." Looking down his smile broadened. "And Rosie and Hugo! Are you both excited about the party?"
A small frown creased at her blond eyebrows before it cleared and that strangely knowing smile appeared on her lips. "There is this wonderful vegan restaurant just off Diagon Alley. They have really good food. Completely Wrackspurt free."
"Yes, I'm sure he's lost!" he shouted at the incompetent ass in the Department for Missing and Lost Children. "Seven hours! My son has been missing for seven hours, and if you're not even going to try looking then I will have your ass roasted over a pit of Fiendfyre, Goddamnit!”
Potter paid for their meals and soon they were seated at a small table off in one corner with their food in front of them. They ignored the fact that the whole establishment was staring openly at the Boy-Who-Lived and the infamous Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy, eating vegan wraps and salads with none other than Loony Lovegood. Lucius would be the first to admit that it was odd even for all of the things he'd seen in his life.
"This is the Potter Heirloom vault," the goblin croaked from behind them. "Before you proceed, here are some preservation gloves to protect the treasures inside." He pulled out two pairs of silken cream colored gloves from his pocket.
"What are you going to do for Teddy's eleventh, Harry? It's a very important birthday, you know." Molly smiled kindly at him as they sat down at the picnic table to peel potatoes.
Cautiously, Harry pushed, "Why are you worried, Dudley? Is Marianne having a problem with this?" He couldn't image she would, but you never knew. Some of the nicest people you could ever meet could secretly be prejudiced bigots underneath it all.
The look on Harry’s face when he said that should have been captured on film, but seeing as he had no desire to learn how to use one of those godforsaken contraptions, Draco just settled for laughing at him.
The Manor was unplottable. No one would be ringing the doorbell if they couldn't find the place to begin with.
Lucius let the subject drop, but eyed the staff warily as they edged past it on their journey around the room.
"Me too," Albus murmured. Releasing Scorpius he clasped his hands behind his back bashfully and scuffed his shoe on the hardwood floor. "I hope we can play again sometime."
"Oh, no." Harry shook his head in amusement. "He can change everything. Hair, eyes, nose, mouth, skin color, height, and weight to some extent. At this age though, he keeps to the easy stuff; hair, eyes, and a little bit of facial morphing. His mother was always coming up with different hair styles every time I saw her." He smiled with the memory.
Stopping, he gazed unfocused somewhere over Harry's chest. He listened to the heartbeat under his ear and felt soothed by the rise and fall of every breath. "Since then I'd given it up." Draco shrugged with fake dismissiveness.
Giving his friend a bright smile, Harry stepped forward and pulled her into a welcoming hug. "Luna, how did you get here?" he asked when they'd pulled back.
That had been a fun visit, Harry reflected as he went back to washing dishes. They agreed to set a meeting for the next morning to discuss WWW with Lucius.
"Family tree?" he suggested. "Dad's godfather was Sirius Black, right?" James gave him a look that said quite plainly, "duh".
Harry nodded and pulled a folder from his inner coat pocket holding all the information he’d gotten from Gringotts. He rummaged around in it ’til he found the papers detailing his part ownership and subsequent income from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and slid them across the desk.
He lifted his hand and looked at the healing pink scar on his index finger from where the garden gnome had scored a lucky bite. Draco had healed it for him with a special potion he'd made. And Draco had made cookies that day too and always hugged them all when he saw them.
“Hey,” Ron said, unfolding his arms to reach into his pockets. He pulled out several sandwiches and brandished them about. “I brought you what I would want if I had to sit and talk to stuffy old witches and wizards all day.”
i left this fic alone for a good few months and only really started plugging away at again around may, when i felt like i needed a bit of hopeful relief from work and the yk state of the world! i wrestled w/ the idea of endings a lot here & when i decided on this, i thought it worked for me. hopefully it works for you!
Christmas at the Weasley’s had been everything that Harry had known it would be: so loud that it sometimes felt you had to shout to be heard and so loving that it poured out of everyone, made them happier and more grounded. Harry found himself sitting in a corner a few times just trying to soak it up, to revel in the feeling. He had died, but he was here. He was here and he was loved and he loved.
Harry laughed. He looked at Malfoy, felt something twist in his chest, a warmth that flooded through him and felt like fondness. “You ramble.”
The owl had been severe, patient but firm, delivering the letter and waiting for the reply even when Harry tried to shoo it. He hadn’t been sure, staring at the short note, whether he wanted to go. The idea of it was so strange and foreign: if someone had told him a meeting with Narcissa Malfoy at
“Gin, nothing.” Ginny tapped her fingers against the table. “I know, Harry. I just don’t want to hear about it, okay? Let’s just — you were right. We should get something to eat. I’m going to get lunch from the deli on the corner and I’ll come back with it. And when we’ve done that, we can talk about Narcissa Malfoy’s invitation like civilised people, but right now I want to go outside and kick your gate while picturing it’s her smug face.”
“Fuck off, you-can-call-me-Harry,” Draco said and then he was pushing Harry’s hand out of the way, hesitating for a moment before his long, cool fingers wrapped around Harry’s cock. There was a moment where Harry glanced up at him, catching his eye. They breathed together and then Draco started to move, a tight grip, a relentless pace. Harry didn’t need much coaxing. He had already been nearly there and Draco’s hand gripping him, chasing him towards orgasm, was almost too much. His eyes fluttered close and he came, spilling over as his hips bucked and he bit his lip hard to try to press down on the noise.
Ron did not need his help. Ron had his own name, his own reputation, his earnest, open manner. He rushed into the house one day, chattering excitedly, waving a stack of parchment and several books at Harry. It took him several long minutes to calm him down, to draw him back and coax answers out of him.
The loud and nearly hysterical laughter that escaped Draco was, frankly, uncalled for. Harry glared at him. “Fuck off.”
Harry did not particularly like to be called kind. He didn’t know why, just that it left him feeling almost like his insides had become momentarily mush and that made him feel awkward and embarrassed. Feeling his own face heat, he shrugged again and coughed in embarrassment. It made him lean to grab the backpack as he unzipped it. “I have things for you.”
He had told Draco how bad he felt taking payment and Draco, of course, had laughed at him before he said, “You’re an idiot, Harry.” He had turned serious and then said, “But you really like that sort of thing and I think you need to pay attention to that.” His look had been significant. Harry had pretended he understood what Draco meant.
Harry looked at him and then swallowed. He put his hands in his pockets to try and stop himself fidgeting, ducking his chin into his chest to stare at the ground and then looked back at Malfoy again. “If you want me to go, I mean, really, truly want me to go then I will. But you look — upset.”
Malfoy laughed, bitterly. “Oh, it is. You’re always there. You’re there nearly every time I do something stupid, or selfish, or when I don’t want you to be.”
The weirdest part of the afternoon was how quiet Malfoy was. His presence made Harry feel like he had to keep his posture as stiff and straight as possible. He wanted Malfoy to say something but, then again, for most of his life Harry had hated nearly every single word that came out of Malfoy’s mouth. Sitting in his mother’s study in his own house, though, Harry expected Malfoy to say something.
also, thank you to everybody who read and liked this and commented so far! i really appreciate it!!! i've been putting off reading the last part because vague wave but i'll prob post it in the next few days.
“Yeah, you are.” She had not let go of his hand. Instead, she was gripping it with an intensity only matched by the weight of her gaze “I don’t think you realise that. You’re asking everyone to wait on you right now. I know Kingsley spoke to Ron and you about the Auror training. I know McGonagall talked to you about exams. I
After a minute, Malfoy took a breath and moved as if he was going to get up. Harry, not thinking, acted on pure instinct, reaching out and grabbing at his shoulder. Malfoy stared at him and Harry moved his hand, cupping the back of Malfoy’s head, watching his fingers disappear into Malfoy’s hair. He pulled him forward and kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him.
Narcissa stared at him. Harry really, really wished he could read her. “You’re visiting because Draco told you not to?” Harry nodded; Narcissa made a thoughtful noise. “I see. That’s extraordinarily petty. Have a macaroon, Harry.”
“Oh, yeah, that’s right.” Harry took a sip of his orange juice. Hermione had started to sort the quills into order of size. It was really too early for this. “Hermione, do you want to start the list and then I’ll just contribute?”
Harry went back to Malfoy Manor the next day, trying to ignore the way his heart kept kicking, the way his throat felt like it was closing over. He didn’t know what was wrong with him. He wished that the sharp edges of whatever emotion was overwhelming him would fizzle off and die out.
“Yes. I think it may have been Peregrine, the fool.” Noticing Harry’s look, Narcissa said, “Most of the old wizarding home’s have ghosts, Harry. Malfoy Manor has been here a very long time and undergone a period of extreme upheaval in the recent months.”
Cracking open his tin of cider, Harry said, “You know you don’t have to keep doing this, Ron. I’m fine.”
“Harry, I should like to propose something. It’s quite simple, so there’s no need to look so alarmed.” Harry immediately tried to look nonchalant, reclining in his seat, dropping his shoulders. “I propose that if you are here to find something to do, then we can find something to do. If you are here to annoy Draco, I ask that you do so far away from me.” She took another sip of tea. “We are not getting on at the moment.”
Harry, suddenly unsure of himself, grinned and sunk his hands back into his pockets. They stood together without saying another word for a long time. Harry didn’t leave for another fifteen minutes.
Harry rolled his eyes and walked across the kitchen until he was standing closer to him. Malfoy had a veritable library spread out around him, books propped open in a semi-circle and piles of parchment everywhere. He had an array of quills laid out too, all with different coloured feathers. Harry knew he couldn’t have been that frustrated yet because none of them were crushed. He picked up one of the quills and gently ran its feathers along Malfoy’s jawline, lightly tickling him. Malfoy swatted him away.
“Yeah, maybe.” Ron fell quiet and Harry followed suit. Neither of them spoke again until they were out in the fresh October air, which had brought with it a fresh October downpour. Harry put up his hood and Ron wrinkled his nose, casting a charm to keep the worst of the rain off him. “You know, she asked me to mind the neighbour’s dogs? You know Mrs Ormsby? Apparently she asked Hermione to do it while she’s off visiting her son in Nicaragua or something.”
“I’ve just got one thing to say.” Harry watched Malfoy turn towards him again, his jaw set, a wild look in his eyes. It was entirely possible that Malfoy would rush at him and grab for his wand but Harry would bet that he was quicker. He leaned forward and grinned as he said, “It’s just you went from five minutes to ten minutes, so I wondered if you were confused about how numbers worked again?”
“Can I tell you about my week?” Harry asked. “I’m gainfully employed now. I’m a member of the working force. A proper adult.”
Harry considered Malfoy for a long moment. He wanted to burst right out, to tell him that he was being ridiculous. He had been a Death Eater and Harry didn’t doubt that he had wanted it at one point, no matter how much Malfoy had tried to obscure that fact throughout his trial. Malfoy had chosen a path and then deviated from it but that didn’t mean that he didn’t deserve a punishment. He wanted to snap at him and tell him that, for all the horrible things he had done, Lucius Malfoy had done even worse and maybe he did not deserve to be welcomed back to the world with open arms. Maybe, this time, he deserved a lingering consequence.
Harry nodded and then threw himself onto the grass beside him. They looked up at the sky, which had started to darken slightly. The clouds were not as clear anymore and there was the faint threat of rain. Harry reached over and grabbed Draco’s hand.
He liked moving around. He liked being outside and having things to do with his time, but it had been nice to spend the last few months walking peoples dogs, helping them with their pets. It had been nice and made him feel full in a way he wasn’t used to. Harry had always wanted to be an Auror but maybe that dream had died when his body had, the first time. It felt like it belonged to a different part of him, a version of himself that the past had swallowed. The him that stared back at him from the mirror didn’t want that life anymore. The him that Harry was becoming acquainted with wanted to help and liked animals.
Harry was trying extremely hard not to smile. He could tell it was failing. “I’m being punished? But I’m making you breakfast.”
Seemingly content with having enough pasta in the pot to feed a small army, Ron set down the bag and turned. His face was a picture: pinched and wary and earnest all at once. His eyebrows were drawn down but it was clear he was trying to smile and look encouraging. All together, it kind of made him look like he really needed to take a dump. “Well, you know,” Ron said, waving a hand. “After the — after.”
“Well!” Ginny laughed. “I want to know what you want, Harry. That’s it, right now. I just want you to tell me if you want me, okay?”
Harry thought about Draco leaning over cauldrons and worrying himself sick and how he paced sometimes, relentlessly. He pictured the nightmares he’d been told about and the way that Draco shook occasionally, trembling throughout the day. Harry pictured the boy he had known and the almost-man that he knew now. He remembered Draco’s soft voice telling him secrets and asking him not to repeat them.
It was one of the first times that Malfoy had mentioned his house arrest, in one way or another. As far as Harry could tell, Malfoy spent the day swanning around in clothes that didn’t fit him, wearing shoes roughly half the time, picking at cupcakes and stalking people down lanes. Harry decided to tell him (most of) that.
“Harry,” Harry said mildly. He lifted his wand out and cast a quick charm which seemed to mollify Draco somewhat. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“All right,” he said, first to Yolanda and then to Malfoy. “All right, then, I’m doing this first. Want to come for a walk with me? I’m asking you to. I was kind of a jerk and I want to apologise.”
Malfoy laughed. “Yes, I suppose you would.” He stood up suddenly, pushing himself up from the table and beckoning for Harry to follow as he walked towards the door that led to the gardens. “I’m going outside, Potter. Come along, will you?”
“So do I.” Narcissa walked with him to the door of the study. “Please feel free to call at any time for tea.”
“I suppose it wouldn’t be,” Hermione said, propping her chin onto her first. She looked around the kitchen. “The Wizengamot took a lot from the Malfoy’s and it’s hardly as if the Death Eaters left Malfoy Manor all neat and tidy.”
Harry could tell from the moment he saw Malfoy, three weeks into September, that he did not want to see Harry.
Ron was half-asleep on the sofa later that night, a half-drunk cup of hot chocolate on the coffee table, his socked feet propped up near it. Harry watched him for a long time, thoughts going everywhere, firing at everything and nothing, everything he wanted to talk about slipping through his fingers until he cleared his throat. Ron lifted his head just slightly, blinking at Harry.
Hermione paused in the arduous task of picking a large gold quill or a small bronze one and looked at him. Her eyebrows lifted. “I think you can be anything at all, Harry,” she said, but when Harry frowned she quickly added, “I’m serious! But I’ve never thought about you being a healer before.”
There was a beat and then Draco returned the smile, though it disappeared quickly. He still looked pale, peaky, distracted. Harry tried to think of what to say, but didn’t need to because Draco set his shoulders and said, “I’m just bored. That’s all it is. I’m bored.”
“Mate, this is so good,” Ron moaned, through a mouthful of cupcake. He wiped crumbs off of his chin and looked over at the two of them. “I can’t believe you didn’t get more of them!”
Ever since Narcissa’s house arrest had lapsed, Draco had retreated into himself. Harry knew that Draco thought he was being subtle but he really, really wasn’t. “I’m happy for you,” Draco told his mother, smiling at her, squeezing her hand, encouraging her to go out. He would smile at her until she wasn’t looking at him and then his expression would go weirdly blank, a wall of ice sliding into place. Harry saw it, saw the jealousy that flared up and how hard Draco tried not to pay attention to it. He saw how Draco pulled away from himself and into his work, throwing himself into potions experiments that Harry did not really understand.
Harry looked up at Malfoy. He hadn’t moved and he was not sure he would know how to if he tried. He felt like he, too, had become a feature in Malfoy’s garden, like he’d grown roots and would never be able to move again. Malfoy was looking at him with hot eyes, his thumb slowly moving. Neither of them spoke, but Malfoy splayed his hand out across Harry’s jaw wider and brushed a finger across the seam of Harry’s mouth. Harry heard a sharp intake of breath and knew it was his own.
It was not the right thing to say. Harry saw the moment Malfoy’s face froze, the blank look that slotted onto his face. It was only once it was there that Harry realised how animated Malfoy had looked only moments before. He cleared his throat and said, “Your mum was telling me there’s ghosts here.”
Harry blinked at it. Unlike the front of the house, this garden had clearly been well cared for. There was a path winding its way towards the centre and the grass was all the same level. Flowers bloomed, a vast array of colours: flowers which looked like large purple balls, huge purple and white daisies, roses in various shades winding their way throughout the garden. In one corner were a group of lilies, clustered around a pond and there was a greenhouse against a wall. There were so many flowers that Harry could not have begun to identify and he stared at it for a second, frozen in surprise. Malfoy either did not notice or did not care. He walked through the garden towards the back wall, where there was a gate. Harry took another minute to stare at the cacophony of colour in front of him and then took off.
“Harry,” Ginny said finally, drawing her hands away from her face and peering at him, “why aren’t you trying to help me? Or trying to tell me what you think I should do? Why aren’t you doing
Harry sunk a hand through his hair and shook his head, pulling harshly at it. Ginny did not budge. She just kept looking at him. He thought he should have been angrier than he was, even though the anger roared in his ears, made him feel unsteady. He thought everything she was saying should sound like a new accusation, but a slippery voice in the back of his head wound itself free and whispered in his ear
“I’ll stay with you,” Harry told Draco. “I’ll stay with you if it’ll help you sleep. I’ll read to you. Do you remember when you did that for me?”
“All right,” Harry said. He stepped away, putting the piano between them. Harry didn’t know what had gripped him, what drove him to his feet, but there was a panic at the bottom of his stomach and a gaping hole in his chest. “Malfoy, if that’s the way it is then I don’t see the point in...whatever this is.” He flapped a hand between his torso and Malfoy, the gesture so huge that he nearly hit the top of the piano.
He thought about it the next morning and the next day and the day after. He went with Ron into the Ministry and peeled off to try and talk to some of the people in the Department for Regulation and Control, just in case.
Malfoy stared at him, a hard, searching look. It seemed to go on for a long time. Finally, he said, “It’s Hallowe’en.”
Malfoy studied him intently and then exhaled. “You’re talking as if you’re a leader of some kind of force of change. Are you a politician now, Potter?”
Squinting blearily at the words, Harry read them and then sat up straight, shock forcing him into alertness. Staring down at Draco’s crisp, fancy handwriting, he reread it again.
“Please stop talking to the potions,” Harry said fondly, curling his fingers around Draco’s arms and tugging him lightly away. Draco had started to practically croon to the cauldron, telling it stories of Harry’s potions mishaps. “Maybe I’ll take back what I said about you not being crazy.”
“‘Course, Malfoy,” Harry said, still just as cheerful, and he started to walk to the study by himself. He heard Malfoy muttering behind him and that absolutely wonderful sound carried him through the rest of the afternoon and into the next day on a high.
“I do.” Harry lifted his glass to his lips and then thought better of it. “I know what you mean. But you know what I mean too. I do owe her.”
“Right!” Hermione said the next morning, plopping down across from Harry at the table. He blinked at her blearily, barely awake, while Hermione looked like she’d been up for hours. Her hair was still wrapped up in silk and she was still in pyjamas but her eyes were bright with the kind of fevered light that Harry remembered from her obsessive nights spent trawling through the library at Hogwarts whenever she needed to know something. She grinned at Harry, who decided that his best course of action was going to be to continue to eat his eggs.
“Do you wanna talk about it, mate?” Harry asked, sliding Ron’s glass to him. Ron’s answer was a slow shake of his head.
“I’ll drink to that.” Ron grinned and lifted his glass, tapping it against Hermione’s, then doing the same with Harry’s.
Hermione made a noise of agreement. “And then they have to have different representatives. They can’t just rely on one.”
, Harry, honestly.” Draco opened his mouth as if he was going to say something, his expression sharpening in that particular way it did when he wanted to be mean. Harry lifted their joined hands and clamped it over Draco’s mouth.
At that moment, Ron walked into the kitchen, yawning and stretching, scratching his stomach. “The old project was killing You Know Who, mate.”
The sound that left Malfoy’s mouth was torn and broken, almost a sob. He looked swiftly away, staring fixedly into the fire. Harry pressed his elbows down firmly into his thighs to try to dissuade himself from standing, moving over to Malfoy and — and he didn’t know what. Reaching out and touching him.
Harry laughed. He didn’t mean to but he did and then he had to slam his hand over his mouth, eyes wide. An apology rushed out of him and then he said, “I just think — with everything that’s happened, I don’t know if he needs protection as much as care, you know?”
.” Harry had just decided to pay him no mind when he heard Malfoy’s voice, sweeping down from the top of the stairs.
Grinning, he realised he was crumpling the note. He read it again and again, tucking the words into a secret place in his chest. He wanted to remember them. He wanted to never forget them. He felt like he was soaring, expanding, like he was brave and brilliant somehow. He felt exactly like he had that day he had forced Draco to fly with him to try to prove that life wasn’t boring and dull.
His walk up the drive was slower and he had his hands deep in his pockets. A part of him knew it wasn’t quite spring yet — “February isn’t spring,” Hermione had said and ignored all of his arguments that the Natural Order of Things was incorrect and Harry was right with his deep-seated belief (supported by Ron) that spring started once January ended. A part of him knew that but the sun seemed brighter, the days were lengthening, and it was nearly March anyway. When he looked out over the grounds he could see the signs of life restarting and, round one corner, he saw Narcissa staring thoughtfully at what had been a rose garden.
“I’m just not feeling that great. It’s nothing. Probably getting a cold, it’s starting to cool down outside.” He sat up and then stood. Hermione still looked worried. He knew she would;  it wasn’t in her nature to let things go. So, Harry tried on a reassuring grin which clearly wasn’t that reassuring if the look Hermione gave him was anything to go by. “I’m fine, Hermione, honestly.”
Harry’s eyes fluttered closed and he huffed out a laugh. His chest still felt like he was expanding and he tilted his head to brush his lips gently against Draco’s. Draco tried to deepen it, reaching forward to place his hands on Harry’s hips and Harry pulled back. “What if I said,” Harry began slowly, watching Draco’s face carefully, “that I think it’s you? I can feel it. I think you’re there, in my heart.”
Once upon a time, it had been Harry’s most outlandish dream that someone would love him. It had seemed so thoroughly out of his grasp when he was an unwanted orphan, shoved into the cold bosom of a family who hated him. He had been trouble; he had been a freak; he had been the scum on their shoe. He hadn’t known love and he hadn’t known kindness. A part of him had been terrified that he would never know how to give and receive that ever since; on his worst days, he thought that maybe there was something fundamental broken within him. Ron and Hermione had changed him.
Harry found himself lifting his hand, in an almost wave. Malfoy furrowed his brow and he could feel Ron beside him turning to look at him.
“He was always so full of life,” Narcissa said finally, with a movement that almost looked like a shrug. His expression must have done something because she quickly added, “He’s fine! I just — I rather worry.”
Harry noticed Draco was studying him, his pale eyes watching Harry’s movements with interest. For a moment, he let the other boy and then self-consciousness peeked in. “What?”
“Master Malfoy is in the piano room,” Blighter said to Harry two days later as Harry toed off his sodden trainers. Harry blinked at the house elf, who had started to walk away as if that was the natural end of the conversation.
, Potter, there are candlesticks everywhere.” Malfoy spoke distantly, as if he was barely interested in the words he was saying. He dropped his hands from his face and looked at Harry instead with an intensity which left Harry feeling breathless and somehow unprotected. His lungs were tight; the hall was too small; he wanted to go outside again. Instead he blinked up at Malfoy and pulled a face. Malfoy’s mouth quirked into a smile but it was fleeting, disappearing quickly. He was still staring at Harry too much. “Potter, I don’t need you to witness every terrible moment of my life.”
“Of course you can.” Harry looped an arm around Draco’s waist as they walked, a shuffling walk. “People the world over constantly sleep.”
Harry didn’t know how he had got so lucky to have all these people in his life who loved him, who wanted him to be happy, who knew him or were coming to but he was so full of hope and love and joy that he could choke. He reached out and wrapped an arm around Ginny and they sat there, talking in low voices for half an hour before George came out to drag them inside.
“Thanks,” he said, holding the mug. He did not sit down and Malfoy did not tell him to. Instead, they stared at each other until Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“Maybe,” Harry said to Malfoy, a few days later, as he walked up the lane, “I could become a healer.”
“A lot from the Malfoy’s,” Ron scoffed. “If you take millions off of people who have multi millions, it’s not really a lot.”
Harry could see the scowl on Malfoy’s face even from his profile. Harry had to fight to suppress his smile. “Only a little. It was fine. Call me Harry.”
Malfoy breathed in a way that could only be described as irritably. “Yes, I know. I just thought you weren’t going to come. I told Mother all morning you weren’t and then you did and I looked like a knob.”
Harry took a breath and listened as the charges were read out, as Malfoy responded, as the proceedings started. The cadence was slightly more familiar now but Harry couldn’t let himself get lost in it. He couldn’t stop himself from sneaking glances at Malfoy.
“Don’t want anything that was his in my room,” George said finally, once the silence had stretched for too long.
It took about ten minutes for the gates to open and Malfoy was standing just around the first bend in the lane, looking confused and surprised and as if he hated being both of those things.
“I asked you a direct question and you didn’t respond,” Malfoy pointed out, logically, annoyingly. “That’s plenty for me.”
to loom, but took a seat nonetheless. He drank some tea because it would be rude not to and fiddled with the sleeve of his jumper. Malfoy watched him like a hawk.
When he found himself crashing into bed more than a week after he’d sneaked out of Malfoy’s, Harry thought:
“No. I mean, I’d rather that not be it.” Harry licked his lips and straightened his own shoulders, lifting his chin so his face was turned fully towards Malfoy and the bright sun. “I’d rather you not feel like that was it.”
As he turned onto the street with Hermione’s house — his home — Harry remembered how Buckbeak had bent his head and the wild thrill of riding him. He thought about how in awe he had been of the dragons, their glittering scales and the rush of their wings. He thought about the unicorns and the thestrals and the other creatures he’d seen along the way. It made him thoughtful and when he walked straight to the kitchen to find Ron making tea he said, “Hey, Ron. Do you think I could work with creatures?”
Harry pushed a smile onto his face and nodded and left. He found Draco in a long portrait gallery, which was currently completely empty of any portraits. Draco was sitting in the corner, on the ground, a book propped against one knee and the other drew up. He looked up when Harry entered.
“I wish.” He sounded grim about it, stalking over to the door of the study. Harry flexed his fingers around the box filled with cupcakes in his hand, gave Narcissa a bewildered look and a muttered goodbye, before he turned and followed Malfoy.
Draco made a noise like a wounded animal and lifted his hands, digging the heels of his palms into his eyes. His chin dropped to his chest and he held himself so stiffly. Harry moved forward and wrapped his fingers around Draco’s wrist, tugging his hands away.
Making quick work of wrapping the scones in napkins, Harry slipped them into his jacket pockets and then stood up. He didn’t know where to go. It bothered him, the idea of leaving both of the Malfoy’s like this. It bothered him, thinking of the expression on Draco’s face and how quickly he had left.
Sometimes, Harry loved Ron so much he wasn’t sure how to handle it. He wasn’t sure what he had done to make Ron love him either. Harry wasn’t sure what it was that made his friend love
Harry looked at where Hermione’s face had been and swallowed against any panic. “Whatever we can, Ron. Like we said. We’ll just help how we can. We’ll be here for her, too, in case she needs us.”
Malfoy, who was lounging against the banister at the top of the stairs. Despite his posture, he looked stark and severe, his hair pushed back from his face. He wore a dark suit, which looked black from a distance, and a waistcoat. Harry was fairly sure he still had one of his too-large shirts on underneath, but it was hard to tell. Mostly, Harry found himself watching Malfoy’s face. He looked drawn, and tired, his eyes bright with an emotion Harry couldn’t place. He looked like he definitely did not want to see Harry.
She watched his approach with a vague look on her face Harry didn’t know what to do with. The two of them stood, mostly in silence, for a few minutes before Narcissa said, “Please, Mr Potter, understand that I am very grateful. Should you need anything, at any time.”
“What on earth are you talking about? Malfoy, if I was going to regret it I would have done that already. Now’s not any different.”
Harry really wanted to say that they hadn’t (because they hadn’t, not properly, not in any sort of way that soothed his soul) but instead he said, “How can you be busy? You’re on house arrest.”
Harry desperately tried to will the right words to come out of his mouth. “You’re not shit at it,” he murmured. “You’re not. You can do anything you want.”
Harry trailed after Draco to his room and then pressed him against the bedroom door and took off his clothes as easy as breathing. When he slid down his body and dropped to his knees, Draco mewled and twisted his hands in Harry’s hair. He looked down at him, eyes glittering with something Harry wouldn’t, couldn’t name.
One of the best things about the man that Ron was becoming was how rarely he seemed truly surprised by questions. He blinked at Harry only once and then made a noise which was almost swallowed by the roar of the kettle. “Like Charlie?”
Harry’s face was red and he scowled at Draco, trying to press the urge to laugh with him away. “Okay so I’m not great but —”
“They didn’t have to. It was really good of them. They basically told Ron he could just bring them back whenever and that’d be fine.” Harry’s grin was huge and boyish, directed towards first Narcissa and then Malfoy — Draco — who were both sitting in the library. They shared a look and then glanced back at him.
Harry stood still for a long moment. Malfoy’s fingers were still curled around his hip and neither of them moved. Harry felt the burn of Malfoy’s touch, the heat of his breath, the tightness of his own chest. His eyes fluttered closed and he took a breath, trying to centre himself, trying to push the part of him that craved a fight away. Malfoy’s fingers smoothed over his hip bone a few times, drawing a circle. Harry tried to breathe in time with Malfoy.
Walking slowly home, Harry thought maybe he did know what Draco had meant. Harry, who had always had some form of a purpose, had pulled away from the paths that Hermione laid out, that Ron wanted. Harry had ducked letters and avoided meetings and gave his best shot at not giving his best. He had wanted to relax, to settle, to try and just be himself. Turning down a residential street, glancing at the soft glow of living room windows and trying not to stare, Harry thought maybe he wasn’t good at just settling.
Malfoy coughed and, looking surly, said, “Yes, Potter, I know. I didn’t realise that we were going to walk while you told me stuff I already knew.”
Malfoy gestured at his notes as if that explained anything. Harry stared blankly at him until he sighed. “Some of us aren’t going to have the good fortune to be loved and admired throughout the entire wizarding world forever and ever, so I’m trying to get a head start on making a name for myself.”
Harry scrambled forward, rising up onto his knees and reaching out for Ginny. She grabbed his hand back, but otherwise sat entirely still. “I want you,” Harry said. “I do. I promise. I want to spend time with you, every day, and I want to hear you tell me all about your day and to go flying with you and I want —”
It was too late. Ginny had already started into explosive laughter, throwing her head back so forcefully that the hair on top of her head wobbled. Harry groaned and covered his face with his hands, shaking his head forcefully.
that the walls seemed to press in close. Somehow, the room contained a large corner sofa, two huge armchairs and a pouffe. There was a coffee table brimming with stuff, an apothecary sideboard and a piano shoved in one corner. Along the other walls there were bookshelves which held not only books but trailing plants and knick knacks, souvenirs of places around the world, and globes. There were scrolls and on one wall was a huge map of the world, surrounded by postcards. Above the fireplace was a huge brass mirror and the mantelpiece and around the fire itself were covered in candles and tealight holders.
Dinner with Lavender had become something of a routine now. They ate together every other week — lunch or dinner or sometimes breakfast, depending on where the moon was. Harry was ashamed to admit that he had barely talked to Lavender, had rarely listened to her before he had appeared on her doorstep asking questions he thought she could answer. He had apologised once and Lavender had said “Yes that was really silly of you” and that had been the end of it.
Harry could admit to himself, as he tilted his head back and tried to deepen the kiss, that he had thought about this. It had been in fleeting moments, thoughts he had decided not to chase down dark corridors, thoughts that had nonetheless haunted him. The whispered ghosts of the memories came to him now: times when he had been alone and considered what it would feel like to have Malfoy’s hands in his hair, what he would taste like, if he would kiss with any restraint. It turned out that he did not. Malfoy chased Harry’s mouth with fevered determination, his hand twisting through Harry’s hair, tugging at him as if he was afraid he would move away.
The surprise had hit him first, the shock of it making his heart stutter in his chest and his lungs become momentarily incapable of breath but that passed. He felt the sun on his face warming him and clutched Draco’s note in the other hand. Harry realised that’s how he felt: warm. The sun was rising in his chest, warming him from the inside out, illuminating and making everything bright and new. He felt kissed by nature. He didn’t think he felt different — he felt like himself but brighter, stronger, reborn somehow.
Hermione sighed again but the look she cast him was amused, her brown eyes bright. “Shut up,” she said, kicking lightly at his shin. “
It took longer than Harry expected to help Hermione leave and, at the same time, it came round too quickly. He clutched Ron’s hand as they said goodbye to her and they got drunk that night, so drunk that he couldn’t sit up straight until at least dinner time the next day and the hangover didn’t seem to leave his body for days afterwards. Draco laughed at him but made him tea and fed him toast and petted his hair a time or too. He tried to hide it from Patrick and Betty at work but they both independently teased him about it.
“To my boredom, yes.” Malfoy looked over at his pile of papers. “I’m doing a long distance course. One of the institutes in France agreed to it.”
“Hmm. I suppose so.” Harry fell silent and leaned his shoulder against Malfoy’s. Malfoy hesitated for a second and then relaxed, leaning into Harry, neither of them speaking for a moment. Harry resisted the urge to run a hand through his hair, or worry at his bottom lip, or bite his nails, or reach for Malfoy and see if he wanted to start kissing again. He resisted the urge to do anything but stay completely still, syncing his breathing with Malfoy’s, listening to the water fall behind them.
Harry looked back at her and then smiled. “I think I am. Not that I  don’t — I mean, not that I don’t miss you.”
“You definitely are, Potter. Blighter’s already very kindly informed you that we were busy.” Malfoy’s frown was deep enough that Harry could see it from the bottom of the stairs. Also, he hated standing at the bottom of the stairs while Malfoy lounged at the top. He put his foot on the bottom stair.
“I asked you here for a reason, Harry.” Narcissa’s back somehow straightened. “I wanted to talk with you about the situation that I find myself in.”
She made a noise that sounded like a hum but she was staring at the library door and looked wan. There was a strange look on her face that had crept in at the edges of the icy expression, burning the edges off enough that she looked more human now. Narcissa sniffed and then flicked a glance towards Harry.
The words hit like a brick, huge and heavy. Harry’s mouth turned to ash and something ugly twisted in the pit of his stomach. He swallowed, his throat bobbing, but Malfoy looked supremely unconcerned and when Harry opened his mouth to speak he literally waved him away. “Don’t go on, I don’t want to hear it.” His eyes were bright as he said, “I want to hear all about your little break up.”
Narcissa laughed light and bright, happiness bursting in her chest. Lucius and Andromeda were being civil and her family was once again together. Life was perfect in this moment. “I think at least little Lily will be quite the handful as she gets older.”
Chuckling to himself, Harry stepped through the doorway and strode toward the hearth seating himself on the floor before it.
"The goblin should have a bag suitable," Lucius answered as he moved toward the vault door and began speaking to the waiting goblin in low, cool tones.
The inside of the shop looked much like the outside; tidy, cheerful, and a bit mysterious. The place smelled earthy and spicy and welcoming, like cookies and vanilla and cinnamon. Harry looked around to see a whole wall devoted to potions for all sorts of things from skinned knees to aphrodisiacs. The opposite wall was taken up by packaged baked goods that must have been the source of the heavenly smell.
She chuckled delightedly. "You are a handsome young man," she said, pleased when his blush darkened a shade or two. "And so well mannered, too."
Harry smiled and began to stroke the owl, “Well Sterling, looks like we’re going to Hogwarts.” He quickly wrote a reply to the Headmistress and handed it to his new owl, “I think you know where to go.”
“Wow, that’s one hell of a story.” Ron smiled, astonished with the amount of creativity the youngest Malfoy had.
“Say no more. I’ll help. Don’t tell anyone but I’m a sucker for romance. I used to secretly watch muggle romance films when I was younger.” Draco laughed, “So who is it?”
Narcissa shot him a look of pity, “Draco there is nothing to worry about. From what I heard, Hermione is a sweet and forgiving girl,” She reached across the table and held her son’s hand, “You have nothing to fear.”
“Sorry to interrupt,” Pansy said as she stuck her head round the door, “But we need to go shopping Draco.”
Sorry it's been so long. I started University last month and then my laptop broke. Everything has just been a complete mess. Anyway, enjoy this long awaited chapter.
For what was merely a few minutes of walking felt like hours to Pansy, but soon enough they had made it to their destination. They walked into the restaurant and waited for someone to come seat them.
The door then opened wide and Draco and Pansy saw a smiling Mrs Weasley standing staring at them. She smiled even wider when she realised who it was.
“Why you have friends going back? They’re going to be with you every step of the way and so will I. I wouldn’t be surprised if I could convince the others to stand by you as well.”
Ron burst through the door, “Ophelia is a great name now let’s go its 10:30! Draco you look lovely, now let’s go!”
I am so sorry it's been so long! I had so many uni assignments that needed doing, then I had a break from everything. Enjoy the chapter!
I will reappear in the future to this story, but for now, I'm going to work on other stuff to get my motivation going again
“But it is. I let the death eaters into the castle. I didn’t try to stop Snape from killing Dumbledore. I followed in my father’s footsteps and joined a murderous lunatic, “Draco sighed,
You have yet to answer the letter I sent to you about returning to Hogwarts for an eighth year. I do hope you consider returning to Hogwarts for another year. It would help make things feel normal again after everything you delt with during the war. It would also be nice to see you again Potter. I would love to have a catch up with you sometime, I think it would do us both some good. You might not have responded to my letter but there is still a place waiting for you here at Hogwarts, there always will be. I hope to see you in the Great Hall.
"That's what grandma said and Harry didn't say she was wrong," Teddy confirmed. "Are you worried about that now?"
"Really?" he said with genuine interest. "I've always heard of that department, but have never quite figured out what you do there."
"Oh tosh, Lucius." She waved him off. "You know as well as I do that you would have done the exact same thing. Now, be quiet and allow me to indulge my curiosity."
’, but he couldn't get the little s's. He didn't mean to say that." Albus hunched his shoulders, his face reddening.
Without much choice James, Teddy, and Lily followed shooting worried looks over their shoulders at their dad.
A little surprised by the invitation, it took him a moment to respond with a stuttering, "Then call me, Draco."
“I was thinking of redecorating some more rooms at the Manor,” he said into the companionable silence that had fallen between them. “Mother’s been talking about updating the kitchen with some of those magically converted muggle appliances, and it got me thinking that we haven’t really done a complete overhaul as long as I’ve been alive.”
Draco and Harry just stood there for a moment blinking in surprise before Draco snorted with laughter and buried his face in Harry's shoulder.
"I don't know," Draco repeated peering at the fireplace intently. "It’s always worked before." He pulled his wand out and shot a half a dozen diagnostic spells at the hearth.
"Yeah, Lucius knows to keep the floo open for you." Harry grinned. "Are you sure she'll be able to do everything?" he checked, shifting eagerly.
"No, it was not." Cassiopeia looked him in the eyes, her face unreadable as ever, and harshly beautiful. "The floo trip from the station was most disappointing. It seems that the Manor floo has acquired the habit of spitting soot onto your guests. Fix it."
Dudley sat thinking about this for a long while. Finally, he turned his eyes back to Harry. "So, that means the snakes are relatively harmless, then."
"Okay, Shotzy, hurry! And remember don't permanently break the floo. Just make sure it doesn't work for tonight," Scorpius reminded the house-elf as he and Albus scurried to their cushions and made themselves comfortable. He was fully aware of just how over ambitious house-elves could get when they were on a mission.
Flooing to the Ministry was an experience. He'd tried his hardest to avoid the place for the last decade or so and it seemed he wouldn't be able to go unnoticed. From the moment he stepped out of the black bricked fireplace into the Atrium, he was gawked at, and whispered about, and fearfully circumvented.
Narcissa nodded, blue eyes twinkling in the fairy lights. "The Malfoy gardens have many magical plants, Edward. Some are sweet and like to dance and some are mean and like to fight." She smirked at him knowing that she'd caught his attention. "I could show those to you as well, but you cannot touch them," she cautioned.
"Does everyone have their snakes? We don't want anyone getting lost,” he asked as they lined up by the door ready to make the trek home. He received three affirmative hisses and one English yes. Rolling his eyes, he pulled the door open and stepped out onto the street.
"Stop making eyes at my wife," Kingsley grumbled playfully at him, before glancing around to see Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco himself staring at them with completely gobsmacked expressions on their faces. "Ah, Mrs. Malfoy, you have a lovely home." He smiled at her and grasped one of her hands in a light shake.
"I know," he thought as his beloved wife shook in his arms with the effort of controlling her grief.
Teddy celebrates a wizarding milestone with everyone he loves. It turns out the adults need more supervision than the kids.
Chuckling as she huffed at him and waved him away so that she could fix the curl he'd dislodged, Lucius said, "I'll be back for lunch. I'll tell you about the meeting then."
"Oh, well," Narcissa began with an exasperated air. "My darling mother-in-law had some very, shall we say, malicious plants installed during her tenure as Mistress of the Manor. They are very Dark and we have been unable to divine a way of removing them without severe injury," she told Molly, receiving a commiserating hum from the older woman.
Lucius’s jaw really did drop then. "You have one of the Deathly Hallows?" he rasped, looking like he wanted to faint.
"That could certainly be arranged." Narcissa smiled lightly at Margaret, extremely thankful she was a temperate woman and not an alarmist. "Perhaps we should wait until the party is over to attempt it, though. Quite a few of our house-elves were injured just trying to pull them from the ground."
"God, yes!" Draco gasped and arched when Harry sucked a straining nipple between his lips to lav at it with his tongue. "Please, Harry. I want to."
When they got there it was absolute anarchy. The kids were screaming their heads off already, running at top speed and bouncing off the wards around the dangerous plants with shrieks of laughter and bright flushed faces.
"I apologize, but I seem to have gone temporarily insane," Lucius snipped sardonically. "I could have sworn I just heard the words, 'I want to invest in the
"Yeah! Come on, Harry! I can't talk to snakes, but a boa constrictor would be so awesome!" Teddy grinned excited with the idea of having a pet snake.
Harry felt like he'd been slapped. "How could you know that? How did you see it when I, her husband, didn’t?"
Lucius studied him for a moment before waving at him dismissively. "Nonsense. You would have been killed a hundred times over if I hadn't accompanied you. Then Draco would have likely never spoken to me again," He finished with a conclusive tap of his cane on the marble steps in front of Gringotts.
“Crazy!” She laughed, a truly wretched sound, before she took three deep breaths to gather herself. “Harry, I haven’t been right for a long time.”
Finally, after Harry was sure his eyes would dry into raisins from not blinking, Lucius spoke. "I require fifteen percent of the first profit of every investment, be it real-estate, business, or otherwise, then eight percent of any profits after that."
"Don't worry about it." Draco waved him off before he could protest. "My bed is big enough for five and we’ll be plenty comfortable." He looked at Harry and raised an eyebrow at his reluctant expression.
They sat in silence for a moment until Lily skipped up to them and seated herself down in Draco's lap with Belle curled around her arm.
It felt almost like a ten ton weight had been lifted off his chest. Harry couldn't help, but lean over and wrap her up in a grateful hug. "Thanks Mum," he murmured quietly. He only ever called her that when it was a special occasion.
Molly blinked at him in surprise for a moment before she schooled her expression trying to think about how to answer him. "Dear, are you worried that you've gotten over your separation with Ginny too quickly?"
Nodding, Ron absently ran a finger down the condensation on his glass. "They'll grow out of it, Harry. It's bound to take some time. Mum understands, after having them for three weeks unexpectedly she figured they'd want to stick close to you for a bit."
Lucius snorted. "No. If they can't figure out your machinations on their own they deserve to be the victims of your plotting. Although, I will say that I don't think they have any more need of your assistance, such as it is. They seem quite hopelessly infatuated already. It would be unhealthy to exacerbate it," he told them as companionable advice.
, Harry,” Draco protested indignantly. “You can’t hold me accountable for what my immature childish self may have thought necessary. Besides, Professor Snape was a good friend of the family. I’d known him since before I started Hogwarts,” he justified. Then a sneered muttering, “But those Ministry toadies were adults kissing an eleven year-old’s ass. They had no excuse.”
Draco was in the kitchen baking a few batches of cookies for the kids while Harry was watching the little heathens out in the yard when the floo flared up.
Even having observed for himself that Draco was happy to have Harry and his kids for breakfast, the thought of him gushing about anything much less his old school rival was almost beyond comprehending.
The other kids stared at him in abject horror then looked at each other and vowed never to make Miss Cissy angry. They followed Lucius’s order and dispersed to their rooms to get ready for breakfast.
"Nothing." Lucius shrugged before running a finger down the flat of the blade faux nonchalantly. "Just that you have now inherited King Arthur's infamous sword, Excalibur."
"It was good seeing you today, Potter," Draco said with a small smile while he walked the exhausted, but happy Potter family toward the floo. It was evening, they’d shared a light dinner, and the kids were shuffling like inferi they were so tired.
The little boy nodded feeling the conviction in his father's words resonate through the lingering ache in his chest. "I love you too, Dad," he mumbled feeling slightly embarrassed by the mushy words from both of them.
"Sounds bloody boring to me," Ron grumbled back as he lifted the lid on a huge pot on the stove and stirred the contents with a giant wooden spoon.
"It's not that," Dudley began scratching his head as if something was particularly hard to understand. "We just didn't realize that you could jump counties like that."
Harry just chuckled and shook his head. "Sorry, James. It's time to go. Put up the game and let's head downstairs," he instructed. "Who was winning anyway?"
That bit explained, they returned to information about Lucius and soon learned about his leading a group of Death Eaters to the Ministry to steal the Prophecy. His subsequent stint in Azkaban, his escape, and then his and his family's denouncement of the Dark Lord during the Final Battle all followed in short order.
The owlery was cold, but James ignore the chill on the soles of his feet while he stepped over to Artemis’s stand and poked him ’til the bird gave an indignant hoot and reluctantly hopped onto his shoulder.
The woman standing in front of the hearth looked about three times as surprised as he was and simply stood staring at him much like he did her.
The conversation moved on. The kids talking about kid things while the adults discussed politics, the economy and generally horribly boring things that they didn't even want to talk about.
Scorpius shot a panicked look at Albus. He hadn't counted on his grandfather being there and it was unheard of for a house-elf to disobey him. He could see their ingenious plan crumbling before his eyes.
"Don't mention it," he said and watched his best Auror and ambassador walk out of his office followed by three of the saddest looking kids he'd ever seen. Sighing, Kingsley fell back into his chair and hoped with all his heart that everything would work out for them.
"You're welcome," he replied automatically, the exchanged happened so fast his hands were still up as if the box was still in them .
It took them the better part of fifteen minutes to gingerly place every single book into the small velvet bag, but when they were done it looked like it held a single thin book and didn't weigh much more. Lucius raised his eyebrow at the impressed expression Harry was shooting the bag causing him to blush again.
Wrapping an arm around her waist, Draco gave her a comforting hug. "It's alright, Mum. I know." They walked back to the porch at a more sedate pace.
"How can you know?" Hermione asked not sounding accusing, but genuinely hopeless. "How can this possibly ease?"
Despite all of their bad history and past decisions Draco knew his parents had mellowed, especially his father. His forced period of trying to kill Potter had lost Lucius all of his taste for the death of children. Of course it had never been all that strong to begin with. Watching his son suffer through the war and seeing the birth of his beloved grandson had smothered any lingering inclination.
"It is a very lovely color, dear," Narcissa agreed after she was finished giving the house-elf instructions. "I must say, I'm quite envious," she teased as she pulled out her wand and spelled away the smudge of dirt on Lily's dress.
"Quite the contrary, Grand-mère," Draco spoke up before all three of the former Golden Trio could finish puffing up in indignation. "Harry is regarded as the literal Savior of the whole Wizarding World. He's the Head of both the Black and Potter houses and personal friends with the Minister of Magic. As well as a holder of the Order of Merlin, First Class," he stated calmly, but with unyielding steel underneath.
Teddy snatched one of the ginger cookies off the plate on the table and brandished in the air in a distraction. "These are really good cookies, Draco. Sorry, we ate most of them."
Hurriedly scooping up her snake, afraid that she would get stepped on, Lily looked behind her to see her dad was close behind.
"Albus, come and take your snake from my lap," Lucius called over the giggly din that was flowing around the table. "I do not appreciate
Sighing, Harry admitted, "I would have too, actually, but she didn't take it so well. Ron mentioned that she hasn't been quite herself for a while, but didn't tell me more about it."
Rounding a bookshelf, Draco saw Hermione curled into a tight ball in the very back corner of the Arithmancy section crying her heart out.
"Don't act like you haven't figured it out," Narcissa scolded him lightly wrapping her arms around his chest making herself more comfortable. "Really, I'm surprised Draco and Harry didn’t pick up on it. It wasn’t particularly subtle."
"An old family house-elf that had been freed helped them escape," he finished with a shrug staring down at his and Albus’s fingers pressed together.
"And this is Harry James Potter, his godson, Theodore Remus Lupin, and his children, James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna." Harry held the woman's eyes until she broke contact and turned her gaze on each of his children, one at a time.
A shudder ran through Harry's frame before he threw his had back and laughed. "Right, well. Let's get those cookies out of the oven so the kids can think about other things besides us snogging."
Harry forged on. "Draco also mentioned that you might be amenable to the idea of assisting me in investing some of my money," he finished feeling kind of nervous for Lucius’s reaction.
Ron looked at his wife, at her unpleasant expression, sighed heavily and swallowed down the rest of his drink. He signaled a house-elf for another one. Harry had long since given up conversation with either of them and was now discussing Quidditch with Percy.
"I think Voldemort shouldn't have ordered a kid to kill anyone." Lily sniffed angrily. "Draco was just doing it so that Voldemort wouldn't kill his parents."
Harry’d always hated greed and elitist attitudes and people who had more money then they could ever think to use, but now that he was older he could see beyond the snobby arrogance that generally infected the rich and powerful. He could see the benefit and appeal of having those types of assets; money and property and influence in society.
Hermione held his gaze for a heartbeat, silently searching him for insincerity or duplicity. Upon finding none, she nodded silently in agreement and turned away from him to join Narcissa where she was waiting at the door to the library.
"Harry," Ron warned in that voice he'd obviously adopted for the children but still worked surprisingly well on best friends.
"Here, we'll have Fritz show you out to the garden." He called for the house-elf and traded a few quick words with him before ushering the eldest Weasley couple out of the floo room and finally turning to grin at his lover.
"That is not your fault." Andromeda reached out and put a hand on his arm. "She didn’t want you to see it. She was good at hiding it."
It was nearly a week until Teddy's birthday party and Draco was trying to keep his mother from throwing the poor boy a formal ball and inviting half the population of Great Britain.
Draco studied him for a moment before smiling knowingly and nodding. “I wouldn’t want to change too much. I love it the way it is, too.”
"Yes," Draco answered the unspoken question, his gray eyes unwaveringly followed his son up and down the shore. "She had done her duty as my wife giving me a son and fully expected to be kept in the 'lifestyle to which she had become accustomed'. Apparently that meant not having to come in contact with him outside of birthdays and Christmas."
"Snakes? Are you sure, Miss Potter?" She sounded a little hesitant. "Wouldn't you rather look at our Puffskeins or Kneazels?" Now, she just sounded downright hopeful. Harry had to hold himself back from laughing.
"Shit." Harry gingerly set it back down and combed a gloved hand through his hair looking as if he was about to faint.
"No, you're not." Draco pouted, eyes still steadfastly closed to the morning light. "You did it on purpose."
“Yes, I suppose it is,” Narcissa said, after a moment. She finally paid attention to the teacup and took a sip before replacing it. None of her movements were dainty but they were all elegant, a lifetime of aristocratic manners apparent in every one of them. A part of Harry envied it, even though he thought it was ridiculous at the same time. He recalled with some horror his third visit when he set the cup down too forcefully and it had shattered.
Even then, there had been a niggling doubt. He loved his friends and it was more than he had ever hoped for or imagined. Nine year old Harry Potter, shoved into a cupboard under the stairs and staring at spiders, could not have comprehended the depth of love his friend’s had for him. Nineteen year old Harry Potter, lying on his own bed in his own house, still approached it with awe. He could accept that, could even understand it but this — he knew this was different.
“I know you’re fine. It’s just I want you to be more than fine. I want you to feel like me and Hermione do.” Ron opened his own drink, leaning back to recline against a park bench as best he could.
“Are you finished?” he asked his mother, barely sparing Harry a glance. Narcissa nodded and gestured at her son and Malfoy came to her side slowly, hesitating before he sat. He was still not looking at Harry.
Malfoy frowned at him, furrowing his brow deeply, before looking down at his own feet. “Yes, bravo, wonderful job those specs are doing there, Potter.” He sounded sour. “It’s rude to wear shoes indoors. Take yours off if you’re coming in.”
“Not great!” Draco interrupted him, howling. “Not great, he says!” This appeared to be directed at one of the cauldrons, the largest of them, which emitted a foul smell and smoke that curled invitingly despite that. “Not great! He’d probably kill himself trying to make you!”
“It is,” Narcissa said, firmly. “That’s how things work. Your friend has a very important name and did a very important thing. The Obliviator office will be happy to work with him because of it. That’s power.”
Then, because he could fidget even if Malfoy couldn’t, he stuck his thumb nail into his mouth and bit down on it. The noise was too loud and Hermione cut a glance at him, making a disapproving noise in the back of her throat. “Stop biting your nails,” she hissed.
“Then don’t believe me.” Harry spread his hands out wider. “I’m just telling you it because I think it’s what you want to hear. That’s what I do all the time, right? Tell you what you want to hear.”
The prosecutor, whose name Harry vaguely thought could have been Brighton but probably wasn’t, smiled at him with no warmth. “Of course, Mr Potter. I asked if you considered it at all odd that, considering the enmity between yourself and the defendant, you find yourself here today, telling everyone assembled that he’s not that bad, really.”
“I dunno,” Ron said after a moment, with a long, slow shrug. “I wouldn’t mind getting the opportunity to kick some of them in the family jewels.”
As he chewed, Narcissa started to talk again. In fact, Narcissa did most of the talking. Harry spoke mostly to her, answering questions, trying to dredge his own up. He didn’t know how to talk to Narcissa Malfoy: it wasn’t as if he could ask her how she felt about politics, or Voldemort, and asking ‘how’s the house arrest going’ was a kind of insensitive he knew to avoid. Conversation did not flow freely though Narcissa seemed to be listening to everything he said, even when Harry could hear himself trailing off.
“Please don’t say you’re enjoying what you have now, mate. It’s just you and us and then you visiting the Malfoys and then you disappearing sometimes into Grimmauld.” Ron looked serious. “You don’t even do anything there, Harry.”
Christmas was fast approaching, time suddenly hurtling forward with a speed that robbed Harry of his breath. Of course, that could have just been the frosty chill that had settled over everything. When Harry took the dogs out now he had to bundle up warm, pulling a hat down low over his ears, making sure he had gloves shoved into his pockets just in case. It was midway through December, late in the evening, when Harry left his last dog back with its rightful owner, waved off the offer of a cup of tea and wandered home.
Harry curled his hand protectively around the box and glanced around the hallway as if Malfoy was going to be lurking behind a small table or emerge from behind the curtains. He did not. Blighter looked at him with a blank expression.
Ron tilted his head. “You know what? I don’t know. I’ve been sitting here thinking about it the whole time I’ve been here.”
“I’m going to lay waste to you,” Draco shouted over his shoulder. “You’re going to beg me for mercy. You’re going to be so thoroughly embarrassed that you won’t be able to show your face in public for over a fortnight and when you do you’re still going to look sheepish and the Prophet will write about it and I’ll save the article because it will bring me great joy until my dying day.”
Sometimes, it was just that they would sit together in the kitchen, Malfoy pouring over notes and getting Harry to help him with his potions. Harry, who had always been a practical learner, found he picked a few things up from Malfoy but mostly he chopped ingredients and watched. This apparently suited Malfoy just fine, as he quite liked to talk. He narrated what he was doing, a string of instructions which Harry barely managed to pay attention to. He told Harry all about what he was working on, and what the course work entailed, and what he thought of the tutor, and what he thought of the last grade he was given (usually: it wasn’t high enough). Sometimes, they sat together, drinking tea or sometimes wine or sometimes whiskey. Sometimes, they talked.
“I hate how many rooms this stupid house has,” Harry said to his reflection, which looked just as annoyed as he felt. He scowled and his reflection scowled back. Behind him, someone cleared their throat. Jumping, Harry turned to see Blighter, the house elf, looking at him with the expression of someone who was about to do something they found physically painful.
“I know.” Harry morosely eyeballed his cupcake and then he lifted the best bit, the bit with the icing, up to his mouth. He always saved it for last. “You should’ve seen his face, though. It’s gonna be worth it.”
It was a long piece of music. It seemed to go on and on, minute after minute ticking by. Harry didn’t mind. He sat with his head on Draco’s shoulder, watching him play, listening to him breathe. If he could have this, he thought that would be enough. If this was all he ever got for the rest of his life, maybe it would be enough.
“Well. Yeah. If you want to give me it. I wouldn’t — I guess I should have asked if you wanted to, first.”
Harry sighed and then shrugged, carelessly. “Then you’re losing your mind. It’s temporary. You’ll get it back.”
“Great, yes, well done, I wear glasses.” Harry took a few quick steps back across the floor, back towards the piano and Malfoy. Malfoy moved, keeping the piano in between them. It was absurd. Every time that Harry took a step, so did he. Harry felt like he was in an old cartoon, that he was chasing Malfoy around a piano for the amusement of small children everywhere.“Look, can you stop that? I’m no dancer.”
“Mate,” Ron said, his expression making it clear he thought he was being asked a daft question, “I’m gonna join the Aurors.”
Harry rolled his eyes and decided he wasn’t going to pay attention to Ron, who clearly didn’t deserve it because he was trying to interrupt Harry’s precious time with his Shreddies. Spooning some into his mouth, he shrugged and said, “I’ve stuff to do today.”
Ron picked him up from outside the Manor gates, not even attempting to hide his laughter as he apparated Harry home and dumped him into bed.
The look that Narcissa gave him was both sly with amusement and long-suffering. “I can’t say that that surprises me,” she said, drily. She took a step forward, crouching down by some roses and started to pull out weeds. As she did, she said, “I would like to talk about Draco. Momentarily. There’s no need to worry.”
had been in the cards for him a few years prior he would have laughed himself sick. It hadn’t felt as funny when he was staring at the words on paper, thinking about her whispering in his ear, of telling Voldemort that he was dead.
Malfoy sighed audibly and followed him. Harry elected to ignore him but it was difficult when the room wasn’t huge and he usually would have shucked his clothes off by now. It felt different to do that in front of someone he’d been trying to kiss moments before. Still, Harry spun round, hands on the bottom of his t-shirt and glared at Malfoy.
Again, there was a pause. This one was slightly more pointed. Harry didn’t take his eyes off Malfoy, checking the corner of his mouth for a curl of distaste, tracking his expression. There was none forthcoming. Malfoy only continued to stare at Harry in confusion and then he looked down at the piano again. “It’s a stage name,” Malfoy said. “She was a wonderful pianist. My parents hired her to play at their wedding.”
Harry, clutching his mug of tea like a lifeline, nodded as if that was a perfectly normal thing. He supposed it could be, for some people. Maybe George had always secretly liked fishing. Maybe it was something that Fred and George had done. It was hard to know, so he just accepted it, and waited for Ron to come back.
Red as his hair, Ron shrugged. “Just a bit — people were falling over themselves, actually, to help. When we said what it was for.”
something to do and at the Malfoy’s, at least, no one was trying to congratulate Harry or tell him how grateful they were (much, anyway). No one was trying to draw him into reminiscing about the dead.
Harry kept studying Draco, noting the flare of a sneer, the harsh amusement on his face. He recognised the signs of the boy he had known for so many years, the visage of the bully who had been determined to make other people’s lives hell. He recognised it but now it seemed like a facade, a mask that Draco was pulling on to hide the lost look in his eyes. Harry reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear; Draco stared at him in open-mouthed wonder.
Malfoy had made an attempt at clearing some of the larger gardens but it was half-hearted at best. Harry never saw him do it and no one ever spoke of it. The gardens simply
He could walk to the animal Healer, so he did. Harry did that now: he walked everywhere if he could. He had always hated apparating, hated the way his stomach twisted and turned, how his body failed to feel like his own for moments after he reappeared. Sometimes it brought him back with startling clarity to the Forbidden Forest and Harry wouldn’t, couldn’t go back there. He wanted to be in the world, so he walked in it and tried to take it all in.
“I mean it, though.” Ron put his fork down, reaching to hold her hand. “I’m so fucking glad we’re all here. This is loads better than last year. And next year will be even better. And we’re always going to just do whatever you want on your birthday, because we love you, and we’re always going to be together.”
“I’m always running away from you,” Draco said, which was such a huge lie from someone who was currently trying to mould their bodies together. Harry laughed and opened the door to Draco’s bedroom, hurrying through the front chamber to get to the back. Draco made a gleeful noise when he saw the bed and flung himself onto it, curling into a comma.
“No!” Hermione’s hands were windmilling around her, every gesture huge. “I just knew something was! I suspected it! I was telling Ron but I — he
The kitchen was Harry’s favourite room in Hermione’s house — a room that had considered all different kinds of décor, before nudging its way towards farmhouse. There was a large, deep Belfast sink, tea towels decorated with farm animals, a breakfast bar with large stools, and all of it painted a sage green which seemed to soothe every person that walked into it. The Granger’s hadn’t yet returned from Australia – “I’m not sure where they are anymore,” Hermione had said, her face tight enough when she told him that Harry had decided not to push it. Hermione had wanted to come home, though, and Harry had made it his base for the time being.
Harry nodded and then did exactly that: he thought about it more. He thought about it that night as he picked up around him in the living room and his bedroom, pushing clothes and books and detritus into piles. He didn’t get to sleep until late because he lay awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering if that was what the future held for him.
a nice coat. I don’t need compliments from you, though.” He looked truly aggrieved, as if he hated that he had to say it.
when he became excited. He learned, too, the way Malfoy looked when he was tired, when he was laughing, when he didn’t want Harry to be there.
good at, so instead he had thrown himself into things he thought he was good at. He took Mrs Ormsby’s dogs out for walks and runs; he fed them; he played with them. He liked it so much he started offering dogwalking services in the local area, walking the estates and making friends with people and their pets alike.
Malfoy pressed firmly down on the piano keys. “I’m obviously going to say yes, Potter. I know my audience.”
is much better at it than me and I just walk around here, doing my best impression of a pixie in an antiques shop.”
Blighter stepped back and disappeared before Harry could say anything at all. He didn’t want to touch any of the food suddenly, but Narcissa didn’t seem to notice. She lifted a cup of tea and placed a bun onto a plate, which she set to levitate by her elbow. When Harry looked up, he couldn’t help but look at Malfoy too.
Harry reeled back, grabbing his hand and scooting across the floor. His knees hurt from the wooden floor suddenly and he couldn’t stay on them anymore. He pushed himself to his feet, brow furrowed, and stared down at Ginny. His lungs were burning. When he spoke, it hurt. “I have a life! I’m not visiting the Malfoy’s every other day — it’s just a laugh, it’s just to wind him up, it’s nothing.”
“Oh,” said Harry, quiet as a mouse. He looked up at Ron. “Oh,” he said again and Ron’s face cracked, falling into pieces at whatever he saw on Harry’s face. Harry wasn’t even sure what it was — he couldn’t think, he was too full, too shocked at the weight of the idea that him not being happy would break someone else’s heart. He was revelling in it, turning it over in his head, as Ron wrapped him in a hug, huge and bear like, bringing Harry in and almost crushing him. Harry gasped and then hugged him back.
When he spoke, he watched Malfoy intently. “All you have to do, Malfoy, to change how people see you is to change yourself.” Malfoy looked at him askance, his mouth falling open and his narrow shoulders rising as if he was readying himself for a fight. Harry held up a hand. “I really, honestly don’t mean you have to change everything about you. You can still be roughly the same person, but you have to
Hermione looked at Ron and then back at Harry. Ron nodded and Hermione squeezed his hand and said, “You’re allowed to talk to us about it. I’m not going to pretend that he wasn’t a heinous child, teenager and young adult but I think he’s...trying.”
Harry moved, shuffling his feet awkwardly against the ground and then nodded. With complete honesty, he said, “I don’t think I thought once about gardening while Voldemort was around last year.”
Blinking himself back into the present, Harry realised that both Ron and Hermione were looking at him. “You’re writing to him a lot?”
“Posh people, probably,” Harry said. “They’re always talking nonsense. Hermione and I went to Oxford for the day not long ago and eavesdropped.”
It was a criticism said softly, though it felt as sharp as the wind. Harry sucked in a breath and then took a sip from his tin. “I don’t know what I want to do with the place.”
“I do, sometimes,” Harry admitted. He still refused to move. The doorframe was his new home, it was where he stood and let himself be propped up. “But Ron and Hermione are my best friends and I
“That’s fair. I suppose I can’t even promise I won’t do it, but I can try to be better.” Harry tipped his chin up towards Malfoy’s face and then, when he noticed the other boy wasn’t looking at him, he lifted a hand, pressing his fingers coaxingly at the hinge of Malfoy’s jaw. Malfoy started but turned his head to look at Harry. His eyes were wide and grey, tentative but unflinching. Harry stroked the tips of his fingers along Malfoy’s jawline, ending under his chin. He smiled at him, uncertain and unsure. “I’m going to try not to be a gigantic arse.”
“We could have one, though,” Harry supplied, helpfully. Hermione turned a sharp look on him as Ron groaned. “I mean, only when Ron comes over obviously. Two people don’t make much of a club.”
Harry looked at the bags under Malfoy’s eyes. “I don’t know what I’ve done to make you think I’m big into pretending for other people, Malfoy, but I’m really not. You have to let that go.”
Harry looked at him and then nodded. He stood up quickly, turning back to extend his hand to Draco and tug him up. “Then let’s go do something fun.”
. (He had asked Ron about it and Ron had shrugged helplessly. “Dad said he’s going to look at it sometime. I think it upsets Mum.”)
“Anyway, I wanted to say thank you. I don’t want you to think I don’t know that you didn’t have to do it. And I don’t care why you did it, and I don’t want to get into some huge moral argument or to hear your morally amazing and righteous justifications for it, I just wanted to say thank you so I could do it once and get it off my chest and never have to say it again, ever.” Malfoy said everything in a rush, as if he really was dying to say it and never have to repeat it. It was almost impressive. Harry had heard a lot of rushed talking, but never in the kind of cut glass voice which meant every syllable was still clearly uttered. Perhaps it was a skill they only taught properly posh people.
“Don’t be a dick,” Harry snapped. He kept his palm on Draco’s chest and he could feel his heartbeat thrumming underneath it. “I’m trying to speak to you about something important, so let’s not ruin it by retreating to childhood, okay?”
“Well. November is pretty early,” Harry said kindly. Ron blew out a breath and stared morosely at the display again. It twinkled back at them, seemingly even more festive in the face of Ron’s consternation. Harry had met Ron in front of the Ministry after work and they’d wandered into Diagon, in search of Ron’s elusive first Christmas present.  A Christmas shop had popped up, taking over a disused shop, a huge sign out the front declaring
Draco shut it. He was almost silent as Harry told him about his week, as he doled out tales of the different animals he had seen and everything he could remember Patrick say. Draco moved his head to watch Harry talk and Harry knew he had his full attention, could tell how deeply he was listening. Draco’s eyes followed every single one of Harry’s hand movements and eventually he reached out, catching hold of Harry’s hand,  and turning it over to trace the lines of his palm. Harry shuddered, a spark of pleasure going up his spine, but he kept talking and talking until he felt like he’d talked too much.
