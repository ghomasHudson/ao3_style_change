When he first heard Narcissa Malfoy’s cool voice, he went stiff and kept his eyes to the ground. He could feel her gaze on him but didn’t dare to look back at her. Her face came close to his, but his features were so distorted by Hermione’s Stinging Hex it would be hard for someone who knew him well to recognize him, and she’d only met him a few times. She pulled up again and turned to the impatient Fenrir Greyback and spoke the words Harry so dreaded:
A flurry of silver, then the heavy pressing weight of apparition that was only made worse by the goblin weighing him down. They appeared again by the seashore. The stars shone bright above them, the air tasted of salt, and Dobby had the hilt of the silver knife protruding from his chest.
“It’s me”, Harry said and reached out to tap Draco’s shoulder.
Without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry leaned forward and placed a kiss on one of the scars, turning tomato red as soon as he realized what he’d done. Draco’s entire body went stiff for a moment, before he turned around and gave Harry a reproachful look.
“Have to say I’m with her on that one”, Ron said.
Malfoy frowned. “What exactly do you mean by ‘the likes of you’, Potter?” His voice was venomous, eyes burning.
Harry had been scared Draco would be upset about their last exchange, but this fear proved unfounded. Draco acted in the same snarky way he usually did, although he didn’t try to kiss Harry afterwards again. Harry, who didn’t feel that the kissing by itself was in anyway breaking some unspoken rule, took matter into his own hands by kissing Draco senseless after Draco had just sucked him off. Unfortunately, one thing led to another, and before Harry knew it he was back down between Draco’s legs. After that, they both had to lie down for a while. Tentatively, Harry shifted and rested his head against Draco’s shoulder. Draco stiffened slightly but didn’t move away.
“What, have you missed me?” Harry said, grinning slightly at the scornful look on Malfoy’s face. “Shall we?” He nodded towards the door.
“I got the idea from that girl Granger”, Draco admitted about the poisoned mead. “I overheard her saying Filch can’t tell different potions from each other.”
“Well, for starters, you can’t break an unbreakable oath.”
Dumbledore bowed his head. “That isn’t true, Draco. You always have a choice. I’ve not confronted you before, because I knew Lord Voldemort would kill you if he knew I suspected you, but I’ve known that you’ve been meaning to kill me for a long time. It’s a difficult position for such a young man to be in.”
Despite Draco’s dismissal, Harry still wrenched his hands guiltily.
But Draco didn’t wait. He’d gotten hold of his wand and set off a jet of red light that narrowly missed Harry.
When he’d told them about what had happened, Hermione had immediately started smearing The Prince. Ron had said Malfoy deserved it and almost seemed relieved, like Harry had proven that he’d gone back to hating Malfoy once and for all.
” Hermione screamed in a shrill voice.
“I hope you’re telling the truth, because that was too sloppy. There was no chance of success. You know our master has little patience for recklessness. Speaking of which, your minions tell me you haven’t been focusing nearly enough on the task at hand.”
“We thought you might try and duel him”, Ron added. “But I guess you still might have, though it wouldn’t have been in the way we thought.”
“What about you and that Cho Chang?” Draco asked as he pulled away only a few seconds later.
Harry nodded. “Not that anyone will truly believe it if I tell them.”
“What was that?” Ron asked and gulped down some water Hermione had conjured up.
Dumbledore raised an eyebrow. “Why has Draco confided in you, Harry?”
Hermione, on the other hand, was as talkative as ever. Although she went on like nothing had happened, he could still feel a shift in her too. It became evident in how she started missing things when she corrected his homework, and when he got it back with the mistakes marked in red ink, she’d act surprised and frown and apologize to him for not being thorough enough. When they passed around dishes at dinner, she’d send them away from him, even though she must’ve heard him ask her to pass them to him. In the library, she’d get up and look for a book and not be back for thirty minutes, laughing and saying she’d found an interesting book and lost track of time.
“Is that why you didn’t go into Hogsmeade with me? To follow Draco Malfoy around the castle?” Hermione hissed angrily. “Listen, Harry, you’re obsessed. You’re acting irrationally. You have no proof whatsoever – in fact, all the proof we have point
Ron looked slightly sulky at the mention of McLaggen, but his interest in Malfoy’s odd behavior compelled him to carry on the conversation. “Maybe Myrtle gave him a
“That one doesn’t count”, Draco said in exasperation.
For a moment Harry feared that his mind was playing tricks, because he saw nothing but black smoke and fire, but then he spotted them. Draco had climbed up a pile of charred benches and was holding up Goyle with one arm, while the other waved furiously. Draco stretched out his hand as Harry swept lower, but Goyle was too heavy, and Draco’s hand slipped out of Harry’s.
“… grave mistakes! You’ll be expelled!”
“Has something happened?”
His tone was nonchalant, but the unbothered façade was somewhat diminished by the way his shoulders hunched as he spoke.
“How about we call this a night? That was a bit too close for comfort”, Harry mumbled, standing up and buttoning up his pants.
“No, no, sorry”, Harry mumbled hurriedly, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and pulling him in closer to kiss him.
If Draco cared that his gift hadn’t been well received, he didn’t let it show. “
“I didn’t see it”, Harry said, glancing at Draco, who was fumbling with something inside his robes.
“No. You know what I mean.”
Then there was a confused flurry. Dobby was there, and Bellatrix was shouting and suddenly Narcissa’s wand was across the room. All the while Harry was increasingly aware of Voldemort drawing closer. They only had seconds now and he could barely think through the searing pain in his scar. He tossed a wand to Ron, who was holding Hermione, and managed to haul Griphook – still clutching the sword of Gryffindor – across his shoulder. With his free hand he grabbed Dobby.
“Not this
“Take off your trousers and never do that again.”
He pushed down harder, but the bleeding continued. Blood welled up between his fingers and stained his shirtsleeves. The shaking wouldn’t stop, and Harry could feel himself tremble too. Draco’s face grew paler by the second and then, suddenly, he grew limp.
“H-Harry”, Draco stammered and shoved the jar of lubricant towards Harry.
Although they didn’t say it out loud, not finding a new meeting place would be the end of their escapades. With Filch lurking around the castle and the new security measures, sneaking into empty classrooms wasn’t an option.
“Must see?” Crabbe laughed. “I don’t take orders from you anymore. You and your daddy are dirt! Barely better than mudbloods if you ask me”, he laughed, lifted his hand and gave Malfoy a backhanded slap across the face.
Feeling especially malicious, Harry pretended to peer over Hermione’s shoulder, towards the portrait hole. “I think that’s him coming there.”
“Are you trying to kill me?” Harry said once he’d regained his balance.
“Looking for something?” Draco said coldly, moving away slightly, having noticed Harry’s gaze.
“He will never see you as anything but an enemy. Your master can make your dreams come true-”
Draco’s arm had gradually migrated and had come to wrap around Harry’s waist.
“What about the mudblood girl?”
“Who else?” Draco said, wiping at his nose. He had a nosebleed and a red mark burning across his cheek where Crabbe had struck him. “I could hardly let these idiots wander off on their own. They’re just stupid enough to actually manage to kill you, and they would probably blow up half the castle in the process.”
“Maybe Myrtle’s helping him!” Harry exclaimed, grasping at straws.
Harry simply nodded, thinking it best not to inform Draco that he’d found out the whereabouts of the Slytherin common room not through the map, but through his and Ron’s second year Polyjuice investigation.
“I don’t know what will happen now”, Draco started with a shaky voice just as Harry was about to give up and go to bed anyways. “So, this might be my last chance to say that I wasn’t… I mean back before, last year, I wasn’t trying to manipulate you. I know you won’t believe me and I… I’m sorry, I truly felt-”
“We’re almost ready”, she declared proudly after she’d gone through the details of their plan once more.

That much was true. Hardly a day passed without Hermione nagging him about something. It was either Malfoy, Snape, the Half-Blood Prince, or how he was going to get Slughorn to give up his true memory of Riddle. Her favorite was, unnervingly enough, Harry’s constant disappearances. He could almost hear her already: ‘No one who spends as much time in the library as you supposedly do should be that behind on homework!’
“Harry”, Ron said when Harry didn’t respond. “Just give it time. Sometimes that kind of stuff”, he made a sexual hand gesture in the air that made Harry blush, “just gets the better of us. I really don’t want to talk about it anymore, the image makes me want to puke.”
“Uhm, are you sure you don’t-”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione have set out on their search for horcruxes. At present, they're gathering their strength at Bill and Fleur's, but Harry can't help but go back to the events that took them there.
“He just did”, Harry said and looked at the floor rather than at Dumbledore’s face. He could feel the old man’s eyes studying him, piercing through him, and felt a fresh wave of anger. “Anyway, Malfoy’s succeeded and now you’re going to leave the school without even…” But he didn’t get to finish the sentence.
“He is up to something!” Harry said furiously, banging his fist hard against the library table.
“I’m sorry”, was all Harry could think to say.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. At least Draco was alive then, he thought, and tried not to dwell on the fact that Draco probably had been torturing Harry’s friends while Harry had been wondering if he was dead.
This fic alters certain bits of the Half-Blood Prince. The parts not mentioned should be read as being the same.
Harry was shocked to learn there were Death Eaters in the castle, but Dumbledore didn’t reveal the slightest bit of emotion.
Harry only had a moment’s warning, but it was just enough for him to move away from the door before it was thrown open and Snape stormed out. Once Snape had disappeared around the corner, Harry dared to breathe again. He peered into the classroom and saw Draco staring out a window, his hands gripping onto the back of a chair. Harry moved into the room slowly, not sure if he really wanted to reveal himself. As he moved closer, he saw that tears stained Draco’s cheeks and was so surprised he accidentally knocked into a desk.
“Ron and I have been talking and we know, Harry”, Hermione interrupted, and Harry almost fell off his chair, not entirely because of Hermione’s supposed knowledge of his and Draco’s bathroom activities, but partially because Harry hadn’t heard her utter Ron’s name for weeks, not since Ron and Lavender had taken to walking around the castle mouths connected at all times. But Hermione continued, unbothered. “We know that you’ve been following Malfoy.”
Draco sighed. “I suppose so.”
Harry knew at once that he’d said this too loud. He glanced around the room and everyone, including Draco himself, was looking over at him.
“He’s dead”, Ron said coarsely.
“Fiendfyre”, Draco said with a shaky voice. “C-Crabbe had been waiting for a chance to use it.”
“So, for today’s class you are going to attempt to make Amortentia in pairs. It’s a tricky potion to master, so be aware that your first attempt might not be successful. Just like the infatuation it tries to mimic, it’s fickle and one simple mistake might ruin it. The ingredients need to be added in the right order, to the right amount, and at the right pace. Alright then, I trust you can manage to pair up yourselves.”
Harry knew in his gut who was responsible. He assumed the news of Ron’s poisoning had spread across the school, because Malfoy didn’t try to contact him and was even quicker than usual to disappear from the classes they shared together those following days. At last Harry tried to summon Malfoy himself, but he didn’t come to meet him in the Room of Requirement. The coward, Harry thought in anger and threw the coin across the room. He didn’t bother picking it up on his way out. He went back to checking the Marauder’s map regularly, but Malfoy kept to the dungeons or was nowhere to be found.
“Morning Harry, ready for breakfast?” She quipped before squinting at him. “Why do you have flower petals in your hair?”
“Well”, Draco said in a level voice. “The prefect’s bathroom would be risqué, since there’s over a dozen others using it… Not to mention that Moaning Myrtle lurks around there as much as she does her own toilet.”
“So you’re a double agent?”
“If that was true you would’ve gotten the bottle back from Slughorn. You could’ve told Dumbledore, he would’ve understood and helped you.”
With a low grunt, he raised himself up on his toes and slammed the basilisk tooth down. It cut through the silver band with ease. The scream was cut off as the rest of the silver crumbled and turned into dust on the floor.
“Dobby needs to lie down”, Dobby said suddenly in a shrill panicked voice, looking rather pale.
Panic was descending on Harry now, his only relief was that fear made it easier to keep the images of Voldemort, screaming in fury at a huddled figure somewhere far away, out of his head.
“Don’t you think that’s enough to ward off Crabbe and Goyle?” Harry asked at last, pulling off the cloak. “Aren’t they in Hogsmeade?”
“The Chamber of Secrets!” Harry exclaimed.
“And the Carrows can’t enter?” Harry asked and looked around to spot the door.
“Well, sorry about that”, Harry said, feeling embarrassed that he hadn’t been able to contain himself.
Harry’s heart sank. By the tone of Draco’s voice, Harry was certain it was someone fighting on the Order’s side. For a painful moment he saw Ron and Hermione’s unmoving bodies lying on the stone floor before pushing the image out of his head. He could hear the once distant sounds of fighting growing closer.
Then there was a whirlwind of spells flying through the air, lighting up the room in green and red. Ron emerged from behind a wall and narrowly missed Goyle, but then had to dive away again to avoid retaliation. Harry tried to look for the diadem in the confusion – it had fallen somewhere among the pile of garbage the bust had been resting on, but he couldn’t see where. Goyle was dueling Ron and Crabbe had Hermione occupied, but Malfoy had disappeared out of sight. Still, Harry decided to risk it. He hunched down and dashed towards where diadem must’ve landed, but just as he thought he saw something silver, a pile of books next to him exploded. He was thrown off his feet and his back hit the floor hard. Then he saw Goyle grinning above him, wand pointed at his face.
“I think this will be alright – Filch lurks around here sometimes – but I heard Peeves was flooding the Ravenclaw tower. That ought to keep him busy for a while.”
She reached out and touched it with the tip of her forefinger and Harry’s forehead was immediately set ablaze with pain. He had to struggle to remain himself and not wander into Voldemort’s mind.
“I - I don’t like it, how things are, I mean”, Harry stumbled and wished he’d prepared what to say. “I know it’s my fault, but… I don’t know what I can do to make it better.”
Draco looked startled. “Now, why would I want to do that?”
“Very good! Can you tell me what its characteristics are?”
“Well?” Lucius asked urgently and stepped into view.
“Got you now, Potter” Goyle laughed.
“Is this how you’ve been finding me? Have you been watching me?” He asked indignantly, eyes narrowed.
“Maybe I am”, Ron muttered and crossed his arms over his chest. “Now, where the hell were you? I thought you said you were going to the library.”
“It’s not. It’s a counterfeit”, Griphook finally said.
Harry sniggered, but only for a moment. He was busy trying to catch Draco’s eyes to try and compel him to be nice to Hermione.
“Wizards that think they are above other beings because they happened to produce offspring with the right person, wizards who think that one’s blood status is more important than one’s actions.”
He was losing too much blood. In desperation, Harry pressed his hands against the gash across Draco’s chest. It was something he’d seen on muggle television and the only thing he could think to do. He knew it wouldn’t stop the bleeding, but he didn’t know a thing about healing magic. He was vaguely aware of Myrtle wailing behind him, her cries growing louder and louder.
“Good evening, Draco”, the headmaster said calmly.
Dumbledore seemed to surprise them both by listing Draco’s crimes.
Draco ignored him and said quietly: “I hoped you might come.”
“There’s still time for you to come around, Draco. So far you haven’t done anything that can’t be undone. You haven’t hurt anyone, although that’s mostly due to sheer luck for your unintended victims.”
“I know just how.”
He kissed and nibbled his way down towards the trail of hair that disappeared underneath the waistband of Draco’s trousers. Harry undid the buttons swiftly and wriggled them down Draco’s thighs before seeing to his own. Draco’s fingers wrapped around Harry’s dick immediately as Harry stood kneeling over Draco. Harry slid his hand over the length of Draco’s dick, panting slightly, and then down again over Draco’s balls. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut and then opened again as Harry’s hand went further down, his fingers slipping between Draco’s cheeks, pushing lightly against his asshole while his other hand worked on Draco’s dick at a steady pace.
“Hey, lay off, Ron’s not stupid”, Harry said, feeling he had to defend his best friend. “If anyone has the right to spread nasty rumors about you, it’s him and Hermione.”
Draco shrugged and looked away, as if it was nothing.
Neville cleared a path through the still excited students and more or less hauled Harry over to Draco, clearly unaware of the growing tension in the room. The crowd parted before him to let them pass through, hanging back despite their excitement. Clearly, they had all come to trust Neville.
“How did you find us?” Harry ventured to ask.
The Snatchers turned the band of bound-together prisoners around, so Hermione would come into better view, making them stumble and shuffle to stay on their feet.
“Out of the way, Potter”, he snarled, but without any real heat, and with a wave of his wand and an incantation Harry didn’t recognize, the wound started to heal. “I’ve had some experience with healing magic”, Draco explained when he noticed Harry staring.
“Do you care about me at all?” Draco said suddenly, taking Harry aback.
“It’s the first time I’ve seen you naked”, Draco mumbled appreciatively.
Merely minutes later, Snape’s killing curse hit Dumbledore in the chest. Dumbledore’s body lifted into the air and hovered for a moment, before it fell in an almost gracious arch, plummeting to the ground below.
“If we die for them, I’ll kill you, Harry!” Ron shouted as he and Hermione came diving down.
It wasn’t long before Harry realized that Malfoy was following him. He quickened his pace and took a couple of odd turns to try and shake him off. He went in the opposite direction from his next class, down instead of up, and at last he ducked into an old bathroom. It was with an odd sense of irony he realized his path had taken him to the second floor, to Myrtle’s bathroom. Sighing to himself, he went up to the sink and washed beads of sweat off his forehead.
“Oh, that wasn’t me. She likes me, most of the time. Some girl went in there to tease her or something, she’s not exactly the most level headed being in existence, so it was hard to make out the details.”
Harry shrugged. Of course he’d thought of that, he wanted to shout, but he couldn’t blame his friends for their less than thrilled reaction. He shared their suspicion after all.
Draco smirked and pulled Harry in for a kiss. Harry responded enthusiastically and let one hand run down Draco’s chest, until it could wrap around his cock. Draco’s breathing caught as Harry began moving his arm up and down at a steady rhythm, and then he felt Draco’s fingers on him.
“Stupify!” he called, and the werewolf fell backwards.
“Here!”
Draco reached out, as if to grab Harry’s arm. He looked almost desperate. Harry shied away, remembering Draco’s wand pointed at Dumbledore’s heart. Remembering how that hand had lowered. Remembering how Hermione had been tortured in Draco’s home, while Draco looked on. He wasn’t willing to believe Draco again. Not ever, he thought bitterly. He had made that mistake one too many times. Snakes have forked tongues.
“Do you think whoever made this room intended it to be used for this?” He asked, gesticulating towards their naked bodies.
This fic alters certain bits of the Half-Blood Prince. The parts not mentioned should be read as being the same.
Draco sighed and looked at Harry again. Their eyes met, for just a second, before Harry looked away. He decided it was safer to just stare at Draco’s neck.
Dobby gave a slight nod.
It was with mixed feelings Harry watched Draco Malfoy being dragged by the ear by Filch through Slughorn’s party later that night. On one hand, Malfoy deserved the humiliation of it all, but on the other, he was about the last person Harry had hoped to see. So, when Slughorn declared that Malfoy might stay, no one except perhaps Malfoy himself, looked more displeased. Harry couldn’t keep himself from casting sidelong glances at Malfoy as the latter started chatting with Slughorn, having composed himself. His skin had a grey tint that hadn’t been there before, and his eyes were bloodshot. When Snape finally hauled off with Malfoy again, Harry only needed a moment to decide.
“What is this you accuse me of
Harry cocked an eyebrow. “I don’t think it was much worse than what you’ve been doing all year, although the sounds made me a bit queasy.”
Ron shrugged and turned away to fold up his quidditch robes. “Go on, then.”
Ron and Hermione were sitting against the wall and the still unconscious Goyle lay on the floor beside them. Harry managed to sit up. The door to The Room of Requirement was gone.
“Today”, Draco said, pulling Harry towards him before the door had even shut behind him. “We’re not doing any talking.”
“She didn’t have to act like that in front of everyone”, Ron continued, speaking of Lavender, and even the tips of his ears had gone red.
“I’m not saying I approve of the spell, but he was about to use an unforgivable curse, and it’s not like you knew you’d almost kill him. I say he had it coming”, Ron declared and slapped the not-too-reassured Harry on the back.
sent me that chocolate?” He asked in disbelief.
“Harry!”
“Burn, burn, you cunts!” Crabbe laughed manically as he ran, seemingly without control of what he’d done.
“Come on now, take a better look”, Lucius said, sounding increasingly excited despite his son’s hesitant response.
“Bloody murder!” he heard her screaming, but her voice seemed distant.
“I’m sorry”, Draco mumbled quietly and lowered his hand.
Malfoy at least had the decency to look ashamed. “I’m sorry”, he said.
He caught Ron shooting Hermione another worried look.
“Do you want me to stop?”
Draco shrugged. “So, what about… our plans?”
“What?” Harry asked.
He leaned his head back and laughed. As Fred’s laughter rang loud and clear and so very
Harry grabbed a couple of brooms resting in the nearest pile of trash and tossed one to Ron. Hermione mounted behind Ron and they all shot up into the air, narrowly avoiding the flicking tail of a flaming dragon, twisting to claw at them. The heat was unbearable, and Harry’s palms were so sweaty he had to fight to keep a steady grip on the broom. He scanned twisting alleys for any sign of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, but there was none.
“What does it mean?” Harry asked, glancing around to make sure Mrs. Weasley wasn’t about to enter.
“Are you thinking about it again?” Hermione said in a soft voice.
Harry didn’t know what to say. The anger in Ron’s voice was unmistakable, and Harry couldn’t blame him. After all, Harry had just accused Malfoy of poisoning Ron to his face, and then, minutes later, Ron found them like that? He knew how it looked, what it was: betrayal.
The stall door flew open with a loud PANG! and Harry and Draco sprung apart. A jet of red light passed only inches above Draco’s head, only missing because Draco, in their sudden separation, had slipped and fallen to the floor.
Without a word, Harry, Ron and Hermione lunged forward to come to their aid. Harry glanced over his shoulder and saw Draco charging after them, wand raised. Together, they managed to overpower the Death Eaters.
“I’m not going to hex you, if that’s what you’re thinking”, Harry said dryly and color crept up Draco’s pale face.
“Draco-”
“I have it!” Draco shouted in Harry’s ear. “The door! Quick!”
Dobby’s breathing was shallow and labored, his chest moving in quick jerks.
“Harry!” Ron gasped, running into the potions classroom and skidding to a halt, almost knocking over a set of cauldrons. “You won’t believe what I’ve just heard.”
“Do you want me to stop?” Harry whispered, but Draco shook his head.
“Tomorrow”, Ron and Harry both agreed.
Draco was right in front of Harry now. He looked distressed, hands clasped in front of him like he was praying. He was pleading in a way Harry never would’ve thought he’d hear Malfoy plead, the arrogance gone. With a stab of pain, he was reminded of his mother’s final moments.
With that, Harry hurried after them, pulling on the invisibility cloak as soon as he entered the hallway outside the party. He ran down the corridor, listening at every door on the way. Finally, at the last classroom, he picked up Snape’s voice.
“Perhaps then”, Hermione said in a low voice. “Perhaps it’s possible he is a Death Eater.”
After dinner that day, Draco sent him a message using the coin. Harry was dubious if he dared sneak away on Valentine’s day of all days, but then he found Ron and Lavender, who apparently had made up, feeding each other the rest of Harry’s chocolates in the common room, Hermione nowhere in sight, and felt it was safe after all.
Malfoy winced, grinding his teeth in pain. “You must see, if Potter cares enough about a fucking tiara to go look for it
” Harry said in exasperation.
Harry was once again wondering why he was here with Malfoy to begin with.
He was on the opposite side of the wall. Quick as a snake, Crabbe pointed his wand at the it and cried “Descendo!” and it began to crumble. Harry thought he could hear Ron cry out, but if so, the sound was drowned out as things fell through the air, glass shattered, and metal plonked against the floor.
Harry tried to explain the dangers of the journey ahead and to persuade them to stay at Hogwarts, but his friends held their ground.
. All he wanted was to sleep. He’d managed to slip away to the Gryffindor dormitory, with Ron and Hermione returning to The Great Hall to cover for him. He longed to lie down and close his eyes, if just for a moment.
Harry almost spit pumpkin juice into her face. “Not Cormac McLaggen?”
Harry had to hold in a sigh of relief and think fast. “Well, I know he’s up to something, and since the map hasn’t been of much help I just figured this was the only way to find out what he was doing.”
“Well, no”, Harry said crossing his arms defensively. “It wouldn’t let me in.”
Dumbledore assured him he mustn’t do anything at all, but Draco only scoffed. He continued, talking about the help he’d had from Snape and how he’d used the Imperius curse on Rosmerta. Harry felt a stab of
Draco grasped Harry’s face and hauled him back into a kiss.
He didn’t think it possible that Malfoy had actually changed, that he wasn’t just lying to get what he wanted. It was too ingrained in him, after all his family had been teaching him about pure-blood superiority since he was just a toddler.
Not knowing how to respond, Harry stretched out a hand and touched Draco’s face gently. Draco looked up, surprise written across his face. Before Harry knew it, he was leaning forward and kissing Draco softly on the lips. It took a moment, but then Draco wrapped his arms around Harry in an embrace. The soft flutter of lips felt different from the otherwise so hungry kisses they’d shared before. Gentle and slow. A brush of tongue against Harry’s lower lip sent shivers down his spine and stirred something that had been dormant in the pit of his stomach and he had to pull away.
Malfoy sat up as Harry closed the door behind him.
Harry knew that this was his chance. Even Goyle was distracted by Crabbe suddenly deciding to beat Draco up, and for a moment his eyes left Harry. Harry lunged for the statue, his hands only inches from the metal band as Crabbe’s laughter suddenly was cut short.
Dobby stared at Draco with wide eyes and finally stopped fighting against Harry.
“Harry, what-”
To Harry’s relief, Slughorn entered the room at that and prevented Hermione from saying whatever else she’d been about to say.
Not having seen him wasn’t the same as not having thought about him. The search for horcruxes had left Harry with a lot of time to fill. So much of their time had been spent aimlessly wandering, not even certain what they were searching for. It had been hard to keep his mind from wandering onto more and less pleasurable things. Draco’s crooked smile and stifled laugh as he beckoned Harry closer, the curve of his back, and his pale thighs had all made their ways into Harry’s dreams. He’d woken up flushed and warm and praying Ron and Hermione were still asleep on more than one occasion. He was used to dreaming vividly, but not of such things. Draco’s narrowed grey eyes, his shaking hands and sneeringly cruel voice had also come to Harry at times, sending a wave of heat of an entirely different sort through his body. He’d wondered which one would hit him the hardest when they met again.
Harry leaned forward to inhale. The scent might have been the most pleasant thing he’d ever experienced, smelling of treacle tart, the wood of a broomstick handle, and something musky he couldn’t quite pinpoint.
“If that’s what you want to call it, yes”, Draco shrugged.
“Dobby”, Harry said carefully after setting him down. “We’re here because Malfoy wants to tell you something. All I ask is that you hear him out, alright?”
“Come on, let’s focus on this assignment and maybe we can go fly a short bit afterwards.” Ron smiled, wanting desperately to persevere their newly won peace.
“Was there a note with this?” Harry asked, opening the box and seeing that Ron had already helped himself to it.
So, it's been two years since I updated this, but I figured better late than never?
“No!” he said firmly. “You’ll bury that diadem too!”
“Myrtle, who was killed by a basilisk let loose by You-Know-Who would be helping Malfoy, who you think is a follower of You-Know-Who, kill someone using basilisk venom?” Ron said skeptically.
Harry raised an eyebrow and Ron relented the rest of the story. “And, well, then I may have insinuated that she didn’t really have a date or something like that.”
“Ron!” she said reproachfully. “That’s the last of our stores!”
“Mate, you’re starting to sound the way you did when you were twelve. Did you hit your head or something?” Ron asked, peering at Harry like he was actually searching for some physical defect to explain Harry’s odd behavior.
Draco’s face was contorted with rage and he screamed “Cruc-”, but Harry was faster.
Those little things were nothing alone, but together they wove a net of small passive aggressions that made it clear all was not well with her either. Even so, he almost preferred those episodes to the way he saw her looking at him sometimes - like she was expecting him to break down at any moment.
Harry didn’t bother to gather up his things. He left it all on the table, tossing the map down underneath a book as he stood up.
“I’ve not tried to curse you, if you haven’t noticed”, Draco replied coldly and put his wand away somewhat theatrically.
Draco fell onto the bed next to Harry. They lay there, panting, shoulder to shoulder. When Harry looked over, he found Draco staring at him, but when their eyes met Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry softly on the lips. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him closer, kissing him back.
Draco lay on his back with his legs resting against Harry’s shoulders. Slowly, Harry guided his lotion covered cock up against Draco’s hole.
With those words, he took Harry into his mouth and Harry sank back against the wall.
Draco stared at him, then he closed his eyes. “Sit.”
at learning Draco had communicated with her in the same way he’d done with Harry.
“It’s quite alright”, Draco breathed as their lips parted, making Harry smack them back together.
“Oh, Harry”, Hermione said in an exasperated tone. “What about all the things you’ve said about Malfoy? Was it all to cover up this?” She waved a hand around frantically.
“How do you mean ‘care’?” Harry asked carefully. “I mean, of course I care if you live or die, but I don’t need to know what you ate for breakfast.” He figured expressing himself as vaguely as possible was the best way out of this.
Harry took a deep breath and pulled off the cloak. Draco’s eyes narrowed as Harry appeared in the room.
Harry stood by Dobby’s grave and looked out across the sea as waves came crashing against the rocky shore, a salty spray blowing into his face. He’d spent hours out on the cliffs already, just to escape the crowded indoors. Fleur was a ticking bomb, hissing and spitting at anyone who got in her way, and the goblin Griphook made his presence known wherever Harry went. It was with heavy footsteps that he turned around and walked back towards Shell Cottage. He’d barely gone through the door when Hermione grabbed his arm and pulled him away to the small bedroom she shared with Luna, where Griphook wouldn’t overhear them. Ron was already there waiting for him.
He stared down at their feet, cheeks red, clearly embarrassed about something.
“Don’t go down there”, Ron panted, having run all the way up to the attic. “Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing ‘A cauldron full of hot, strong love’, and mom is about one chorus away from turning her into gnome food.”
“Rockwood!” he called out, and he, Fred and Draco sprinted after the Death Eater, who was chasing a couple of students.
“Wait”, Draco exclaimed, and Harry paused.
“Who’s there?” Draco called sharply.
Ron and Hermione both reached for Harry at the same time, but Ron was faster. He grabbed Harry by the sleeve of his robes and pulled him back, almost sending him crashing to the floor. In an instant, everyone else had paired up, all except Hermione and…
Ron, who’d been snoring with his head in his potions book, looked up. “What?” He grunted in confusion.
When Harry had realized the Snatchers were taking them to Malfoy Manor, he hadn’t been pleased. He’d been worried, primarily about how on earth they might get away, but he’d also felt his stomach drop when he realized it was Easter and Draco probably was at home. He hadn’t seen the Slytherin since the night Dumbledore died and Snape hauled Malfoy off to safety.
“No!” Draco snapped, pulling away out of Ron’s reach. “No. You’re going to destroy it, correct? And it will help you stop him, somehow?”
Draco shot Harry a look. “Right…” He looked at Harry again and Harry pointedly stepped on his foot. “Right, right. Well. I guess… What I wanted to say is that I’m very sorry… ehm… for the way that my family and I… Treated you the years that you were… eh… in our service. We weren’t good masters and it was undignified of us, and cruel, and it was uncalled for. And… I’m very pleased that you seem to be happy now.”
“Oh, yeah? Why is that? Tired of cursing Crabbe and Goyle? Want to fight someone who knows which end to hold a wand?”
He stood up and left her staring after him with a concerned look on her face.
. And then, when you did know, you still went on like it didn’t matter.”
Harry looked up and saw the door open for just a few seconds to let a figure in. Draco’s skin was pulled taunt over his already sharp features. His hair was unkempt, hanging into his eyes instead of being neatly swept back as it usually was. A deep gash ran across his cheek and thin lines, much like the scars on his back, crept up his neck. He was skin and bones and looked is if a gust of wind might send him toppling over. Even though he looked weak, he strode in with purpose. His eyes, at least, looked alive.
Harry stirred. He wasn’t at Malfoy Manor. He wasn’t clutching Dobby’s body in his arms. He was at Shell Cottage, he had to remind himself, planning to break into Gringotts.
Harry himself had trouble staying focused. Between meeting Draco, homework, quidditch, and maintaining his friendship with Ron and Hermione separately, he had little time to dwell on what Snape was up to or Dumbledore’s task to get Slughorn’s true memories, although Hermione wouldn’t let him forget about the latter. Even so, the conversation he’d heard between Draco and Snape was still burning at the back of his mind. A feeling of guilt would wash over him when he lay in bed, followed by the sensation he was focusing on entirely on the wrong things.
“Prove it”, Harry repeated more firmly this time.
When Harry confessed it had been months, Ron said he had to sit down.
Draco only looked at it for a fraction of a second. “I don’t know.”
“Now, Cissy -” Bellatrix started, but she didn’t have time to finish the sentence.
She sighed. “Alright, alright. It was just a theory.”
Draco shivered at the mention of the name. “I
Draco shook his head furiously. “No! I have to do this, or he will kill me and my family.”
“Ron,
“I will!” Draco said, pointing his wand at Dumbledore’s heart, but he sounded like he was trying to convince himself as much as he was the headmaster. “Someone is already dead, there’s no turning back from this.”
Malfoy looked like he did indeed mind, but after staring at Harry for a moment as if to assess whether he was truly being serious, he said: “That’s right, you can insult us however you want.”
“Draco, if we give Harry Potter to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven”, Lucius said when Draco remained silent.
He found Malfoy waiting in the corridor, examining a rather ugly painting of a woman and her rather troll-like toddler.
They sat as they were for a moment, panting slightly, Harry’s face red and gleaming with sweat. Then Draco got up and got his wand out, and with a flick the mess they’d made was gone.
Harry didn’t know if this last bit was truly meant to be humorous, but he let out a little laugh nonetheless.
He was busy with homework one Saturday morning when Ron came into the common room with a grin across his face.
“I know”, Draco said with a sigh, sinking further down into the pillows. “I guess I’ve just never really been interested in being with a girl that way.” He looked horrified at having said this and hurried to angrily bark: “Now shut up and put that mouth to better use.”
He was getting dangerously close to things Harry didn’t want to dwell further on, close to breaking their agreement to leave the thing between them as it was, unspoken.
“Anyone who’s met Slughorn knows he’d never give such a treasure away”, she retorted but without much heat.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “So, what if I am?”
“I’m not killing him! But if I get the chance, I will. What does it matter, when the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway?”
“Hermione thought you might be seeing Cho again.”
Narcissa called out for her son and managed to drag him further out of harm’s way while Bellatrix cursed at her for not going after Harry or Ron.
“That’s not funny, Hermione. Who are you going with, anyway?”
“Hermione!
“Six weeks!” Hermione shrieked. “You’ve had six weeks to ask someone to this blasted party, and you’re telling me you still haven’t asked anyone? It’s tonight, Harry!”
Draco glanced back at Harry as he ran, then turned his gaze forwards and shot off a stupefying spell that passed only inches above Rockwood’s head. Soon they’d disappeared out of sight as Harry, Ron and Hermione continued on.
He had to shut his brain off. He didn’t want to think of it any longer and explaining it to Ron seemed impossible.
“Oh, right, good.” Harry scratched the back of his head.
“Just a tad”, Harry replied and pulled Draco down for a kiss.
It was too late to divert – Draco’s shoulder slammed into Harry’s chest and they both went tumbling to the ground as Harry’s wand was kicked further out of reach. The air was knocked out of Harry’s lungs as he hit the floor hard. Draco was sprawled on top of him, pinning his arms and legs to the floor as Harry gasped for breath and tried to shake him off. Harry remembered earlier in the year when Draco had stomped on his face and broken his nose and winced. He expected Draco to hit him, but the blow didn’t come. Harry opened his eyes slowly, staring up at the other boy, at his tear stained cheeks and still wet eyes. They looked at each other for what felt like forever and Harry forgot he should be trying to break free. Then, Draco grabbed onto Harry’s face and before he knew what was happening he felt Draco’s lips press against his own.
“No!” Harry called.
Draco, his face drained of all color, strode forward. He pointed his wand at them and was quick to grab the wands and shuffle backwards, his eyes locked on Harry. The Stinging Hex had almost worn off entirely now and he saw that Draco was studying him, his fresh cuts and bruises and the dark shadow around his chin.
“You look… Well, alive”, Draco said, eyeing Harry up and down. “And I think you have something that belongs to me.”
Even so, they agreed it could wait until they found Ravenclaw’s Diadem. As they ventured into the Room of Requirement, Harry could finally focus on the task at hand. Discarded items from past students had been gathering here for centuries, forming walls and alleys that stretched high towards the ceiling. Harry’s heart sank as he looked around and tried to remember which path he’d taken that day when he’d gone to dispose of his potions book. He’d seen the diadem close to there, but it was like searching for a needle in a haystack, if the haystack was in a maze. They’d passed the vanishing cabinet, but there were several alleyways winding in different directions.
Draco eyed him. “Not yet. I want you to fuck me first.”
The trio returns to Hogwarts for the final battle against Voldemort.
As he passed, Harry grabbed his arm and yanked him back.
Ron seemed happy to do so and they changed the subject to Quidditch as they walked back towards the portrait of the Fat Lady.
“What?” Draco said, taken aback.
Harry nodded absent mindedly. “Thanks, Hermione, but I think I’ll call it an early night.”
Suddenly feeling shy, Harry hurried to get dressed. He slipped on the invisibility cloak as Malfoy straightened out the bed covers.
“Sorry, I’m going to have to borrow Won-won for a bit”, Harry called back over his shoulder when Lavender protested.
But Draco only increased his speed, wrapping his hand around Harry’s dick again as he kept sucking. Before Harry knew it, he was coming with a stifled moan, spilling into Draco’s mouth. Draco looked up at Harry as he came, and Harry thought he could see a smirk on his lips despite the fact they were still around his cock. Then, Draco swallowed, making Harry moan from just the sight, and pulled away with a parting lick that made Harry quiver.
“Yeah, well I figured I better just do what he wants, to get him on my side and all. Ehm, Ron, do you by any chance know if Hermione noticed I was gone? She’s been a bit snappy with me lately.”
“It wasn’t easy to figure out how to do it”, Malfoy began. “At first, I ventured into the Chamber of Secrets. The Dark Lord had told me how to get in, but it was a dead end.”
Relief was written across her face. She let out a gleeful whoop and forcibly kicked the goblin in the face, making him skid towards the middle of the room where he remained motionless.
? Didn’t you get the gift I sent you?”
Harry opened the jar and stared suspiciously at the clear lotion. Then, with a nod from Draco, he dipped his fingers into it and resumed where he’d left off. His first finger slipped inside Draco with ease. Draco moaned as Harry pushed further into him. The second finger soon followed, and Draco quivered. Then Harry, feeling inspired leaned forward over Draco, guiding Draco’s dick with his free hand, and took it in his mouth. Up until now, Draco had only been on the giving end of this. Harry bobbed his head up and down awkwardly, struggling to find a pace that suited him, but Draco seemed to enjoy it even so.
“We can verify that”, Lucius said. “Draco, go and get the goblin.”
Harry took the box. It looked store-bought, almost like the chocolate muggles got each other in films, except this one had a moving image of a witch and wizard blowing each other kisses. It didn’t really look like something Dobby would give him.
Dumbledore studied Harry with a calm and steady gaze.
Draco kept his promise. It was days before he returned to class, but when he did he didn’t as much as glance in Harry’s direction. Harry had to fight the urge to check Draco’s whereabouts through the Marauder’s map. He figured it would be easier to move on that way. For the first time, their separation felt final, and he couldn’t help feeling gloomy about it. He thought Ron and Hermione noticed; they shot each other worried glances whenever Harry picked at his food or went to bed early, but they never said a word about it. He wanted to tell them that he’d gone to see Malfoy, but he couldn’t bear their renewed disapproval.
Harry’s green eyes met Draco’s pale grey. For a moment, Harry was unaware of anything but those eyes piercing him. He’d imagined that Draco would fill out and regain the weight he’d lost during their previous school year, but he almost looked thinner. His hair was shorter and neatly swept to the side, but it was matte and dull. His shoulders drooped a little, making him look almost shrunken. They stared at each other for a second that felt like an eternity, and Harry thought he saw a flash of recognition in Draco’s eyes.
“I’m not trying to pick a fight with you, for once in your pathetic little life, just leave it”, Draco snarled.
It took Harry a moment to realize what Draco was talking about. “
Harry simply grunted in response and smashed his mouth against Draco’s once more. Slowly, Draco slipped Harry’s robes down his shoulders and Harry stopped long enough to pull it off. Then, Draco set to work on his shirt buttons, unbuttoning them slowly until Harry could pull that off too. Draco’s fingers caressed Harry’s skin gently, running up and down his back and over his chest. Harry followed suit and undid Draco’s shirt swiftly. Draco sat up on his knees, so Harry could pull the garment off and toss it to the floor. Suddenly Harry realized that this was the moment he would find out if Draco truly was a Death Eater and dread filled him, but when Harry glanced down at Draco’s left forearm he found it beautifully bare.
“You saw what he was doing in the Room of Requirement?” Ron asked.
With that he kissed Draco, long and hard.
Draco seemed almost relieved for this excuse to stall. His hand was still trembling, Harry noted. His skin looked greenish, perhaps because of the Dark Mark still burning in the sky above.
Draco was lying next to Harry on the bed with his head resting on Harry’s chest.
Malfoy gave Harry a cold look and sat up. “Oh, right. I’d forgotten I was talking to Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, Friend of the House Elves – I’ve still not forgotten the way you stole ours, thank you very much. Is there another title you’d like me to add in there or is that enough for you?”
He cried, waving his wand furiously.
“For what?” Draco interrupted. “For thinking I’m a desperate piece of shit? I am, so don’t be. You don’t know me Potter, you don’t know the slightest thing about what I want or what I’m doing.”
“Yes.”
” Hermione exclaimed, raising her voice as her face turned red. “You shut up!”
“So you knew he did it, and still we find you two sno-”, again he broke off, unable to finish the sentence.
Draco sighed and sat down on top of a desk. “How did you pass any of your O.W.L.s if you are this dense? It’s an enchanted galleon of course.”
“I’ve seen into your dreams, Draco Malfoy”, a familiar hissing voice from inside the horcrux said. “Your master can reward you greatly… But if you betray him, he will strike you down.”
Harry thought and flicked his wand, but Draco parried. Suddenly he heard screaming and Myrtle came bursting out of a toilet stall, yelling at them to stop. A trash can exploded right by Harry, and when Harry retorted and missed, a toilet bowl was shattered, causing Myrtle to cry even louder. Water spurted out in jets, adding to the confusion.
“Did either of them actually say that?” Hermione asked, moving her chair further away from Ron and Lavender.
Harry scanned the castle. It was strange seeing it empty like that, just a few marked dots in their respective beds. He spotted Draco in the Slytherin dungeon. He wasn’t surprised to see him stay at Hogwarts, given that Christmas at Malfoy Manor must be a rather gloomy affair this year. What did worry Harry was that Draco had started going missing for longer periods of time. It was the first time he’d seen him on the map all day. If he hadn’t overheard Pansy Parkinson complaining that Draco would be spending Christmas all alone at Hogwarts, Harry would’ve thought Draco had gone home after all.
Harry had never in his life felt more relieved that Draco was better than him at something.
“Now, what’s this commotion?” Lucius asked and rose from his seat by the marble fireplace.
“We have to get the diadem!” Harry said, turning around in bewilderment to look through the pile of garbage he’d seen it fall into. “It’s here somewhere, we just have to look-”
It was as if the last few months hadn’t happened. In Draco’s stern face, Harry saw the boy who’d tried to get Buckbeak executed. He saw the boy who’d tried to get Hagrid sacked. The boy who’d helped Umbridge. The boy who’d poisoned Ron. He raised his wand higher, to a true dueling position, but Draco didn’t wait for him to get ready. A silent hex flew through the room, hitting the mirror behind Harry as he flung himself out of the way.
Draco shrugged, apparently thinking better of spitting out worse insults. “If you say so. It still means we can’t be seen around there anymore.”
Ron chuckled. “Yeah, mate, that’s like… You and Parkinson. Or even better, you and Goyle.”
“Did you give Slughorn that bottle?” Harry rephrased, feeling sick of Malfoy’s games. This time, he’d get a straight answer, if he so had to force one out.
Harry didn’t know what he’d been expecting. Perhaps for Malfoy to say he wanted to be a better person, but of course it wasn’t in Malfoy’s nature to want to be anything if there was nothing for him to gain by it. He wanted to renounce his family’s Death Eater ways because that was what it would take for Harry to accept him, Harry now understood. Yet the answer shocked him. He was a manipulative piece of shit, Harry had to remind himself. He only did things to get something in return. Even as he thought this, he was unable to fully repress the part of him that was screaming ‘I want to be with you too.’ He’d felt it at times when they’d been together, that lust for something more than pure physicality. That feeling that if this continued, that warmth that grew in the pit of his stomach would spread throughout his body and consume him. It petrified him.
“The Dark Lord will be pleased”, she said with a grin and let her robe sleeve fall back to reveal the twisted shape of the Dark Mark.
“It’s alright, Dobby!” Harry said, grip still firm around the kicking elf. “Malfoy doesn’t mind if you speak ill of him, or his family, isn’t that so?” He shot Malfoy a stern look.
Draco’s face had turned red. “Don’t talk about things you know nothing about, Potter. Clearly, I was mistaken. See you in potions”, he sneered, sounding like his usual self again and heading for the door.
The goblin held Gryffindor’s sword in his almost claw-like fingers, running his thumb across the blade. Harry had begged him to lie for them, but at the same time he knew that Bellatrix fear they’d been to her vault was the only thing keeping her from summoning Voldemort. Her fear that she’d somehow betrayed her masters darkest secret was the only reason they were still alive.
He told them about visiting the hospital wing. They already knew everything that had been said at the top of the Astronomy Tower.
Then Harry suddenly heard it too, the familiar dragging footsteps approaching their hiding place. Quickly, Harry let go of Draco and fumbled around his pocket for a moment before pulling out the invisibility cloak and throwing it over them, merely seconds before the door opened. Filch burst into the room with Mrs. Norris at his heels, shouting “Peeves!” as he entered. Harry had to push himself down tightly against Malfoy to make sure they were both entirely covered by the cloak. Despite this, he still risked craning his head around to get a look at what was happening. The caretaker had stopped and looked around in surprise at finding the room magically lit but seemingly empty. Then a grin spread across his face.
Harry chuckled but did as he was told. He then turned to Draco and began pulling at his trousers as Draco lay down on his back and lifted his hips to help. Soon, they were both naked.
Malfoy then went on to tell the story of how he’d realized one could pass between the two places through the cabinet, and how he’d struggled to mend it.
“Yeah? What, want to take me?” Harry teased.
Then he gave up a soft sigh and fell silent, his unseeing eyes turned skywards.
“So, the Room of Requirement then”, Harry continued, eyeing Draco suspiciously.
“And those are all opinions you assign to me?”
“Then I’ll just have to look at as another thing I have to do – family obligation”, Draco said, his tone turning sharper, but at least he didn’t shrug Harry off.
Harry snorted. “Sad you had to miss it.”
Draco made a disgusted grimace. “Please, you’ll make me vomit.”
Draco approached him with a sly smile on his lips. “That all depends on how this goes, doesn’t it?”
“Harry,
“And have you found him doing anything he shouldn’t be doing?” She asked sharply.
“Okay, Harry, you need to stop, that’s no good. Or, what I mean is, it’s too good.”
Harry’s head was spinning. He didn’t know where to start. Should he explain what Trelawney had told him when he first ran into her, or what she’d said when he left her in a corridor? Should he tell Dumbledore all the things he knew about Malfoy – although he’d been explicitly forbidden to bring it up – or question him about Snape – another topic Dumbledore had grown weary of. In the end, he had to give into the burning feeling of rage.
“Malfoy”, Harry started, then changed his mind. “Draco. We can’t keep doing this. It’s only making things harder.”
In his peripheral vision, he could see Draco rising from the armchair next to Lucius’. He couldn’t help but turn his gaze to the ground as the blonde boy slowly approached, his feat dragging behind him. Draco came to a halt a few feet away. Harry stared at Draco’s shoes, black and freshly polished by the look of them. Slowly Harry’s eyes crept upwards to the hem of Draco’s robes, then to his knees, to the buckle of his belt and up to the collar of his shirt. He didn’t want to look Draco in the eyes and yet he felt almost compelled to straighten his neck and do just so.
This earned him a sharp look from Hermione and had Harry’s cheeks flush red.
“No, I don’t know why you’d hurt anyone or what sort of evil thing you were trying to accomplish.”
Harry did as he was told. He sat on the floor, staring at his bloody hands until his vision was clouded by tears.
“Positive”, Harry croaked.
“Students out of bed! Students out in the corridors after curfew! Come, come, Mrs. Norris, they can’t have gotten far. Surely Dumbledore will let me cut off a finger or two this time!”
Draco had been standing close to Bellatrix and had only managed to stagger a few steps away from the falling chandelier. He was leaning forward on unsteady legs. Blood dripped from his face and he was trying to wipe it out of his eyes with one hand while the other clutched the collected wands. Harry leapt towards him and seized hold of the wands, trying to tug them away. Draco looked up in surprise, grip automatically tightening, and stared at Harry. Then a smile flashed across his cut and bloodied face. He loosened his grip and let Harry pull the wands out of his hand. In an act of theatricality that took Harry by surprise, Draco then flung himself backwards onto the floor as if he’d been struck. He called out in pain as he skidded across the shattered crystal on the floor. Harry stood dumbfounded for a moment, before he wheeled around and pointed all three wands at Greyback, who’d managed to get onto his feet again and was stalking toward Ron with his teeth bared.
“You’re the densest person I’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting.”
“It better be a good apology”, Harry warned as he tickled the pear that would let them into the kitchens.
Draco lowered his head slightly in acknowledgement. A group of ghosts came charging by on their ghostly steads, shrieking in loudly as they passed. In the distance, more screams could be heard.
Harry laughed, heart beating fast. “Like this?”
“You look incredible”, Harry breathed into Draco’s ear, fingers still pushing in and out of him.
Harry shuffled to his feet awkwardly, wondering what on earth had gotten into Draco, his dick half hard and neglected. Draco stood on his knees before Harry and began stroking Harry’s cock lightly. Harry’s breathing became heavier as he got hard again. He looked down at Draco, who met his gaze. Then, Draco stretched out his tongue and licked the tip of Harry’s dick tentatively. Harry gasped involuntarily, and Draco did it again. Slowly but surely, he licked the length of Harry’s cock, before opening his lips and taking it in his mouth. Harry bit down hard to keep himself from making an obscene sound. He ran his hands through Draco’s blonde hair, pulling it away from his face, as Draco bopped his head up and down at a steady rhythm, his tongue occasionally flickering over the tip of Harry’s cock.
”, he said, and fear was written across his face.
She smiled tentatively at him. “Come on, let’s find Ron, before Lavender does.”
“It’s too late. There is no hiding from
Harry paused. It had to be something Malfoy would find utterly undignified, something he wouldn’t do so easily just to get back on Harry’s good side. Then it struck him.
“Like it rough, Potter?” Malfoy panted.
Draco made a dismissive gesture. “Why would I want to curse Katie Bell?”
“Where are you always running off to?” Hermione asked suspiciously when Harry returned to the common room late one evening, just minutes before curfew.
“He said it was a long time ago. He said that he doesn’t want to do those things anymore”, but even as he said it, he knew it wasn’t enough to justify what he’d done.
Harry, who was just as sick of having this conversation as Hermione was, sighed. “As I’ve said, he meant to give that bottle to Dumbledore.”
With a sigh, Draco turned around. White scars clad his back, stretching this way and that. They reached for his shoulders and down towards his lower back. Some were thin as a strand of hair, while others were lumpy and uneven. Harry let his fingertips brush against them gently. It looked like Draco had been whipped, but Harry knew the wounds must’ve been the result of dark magic for the scars not to go away with the help of magical remedies.
Dobby looked at Harry with wide eyes. “Is Master Malfoy ill, Harry Potter sir? He’s delirious!”
“Go”, Harry said quietly as he pulled Draco up.
“No”, Harry lied.
“Not thrilled to see me Weasley?” Draco said in an attempt at his old snark, but his voice sounded almost shaky.
” Harry repeated angrily.
They stepped out of the kitchens but stopped by the door that lead back into the hallway.
“I was starting to think you were standing me up”, Draco said with a sly grin, beckoning Harry closer.
Instead, Malfoy headed the other way and pulled open the door to an old classroom and slipped inside, gesturing for Harry to follow. The classroom was dark, but Draco sent soft lights up towards the ceiling with a flick of his wand. All the desks had been shoved around the room and the furniture wore a coating of dust, uneven in places, a sign that they were not the first ones to hide in there.
“They will be joining us shortly, I imagine”, Draco said. “As soon as they’ve disposed of your guards. I had to go ahead. I have a different task, you see.”
They fell back into silence.
“Well, that can’t be helped now, can it?” Ron said cheerfully and stood up, dropping the bear on the floor. “Just think about how lonely you’d be without me, alright? And how horrible Quidditch would be if you had to bring McLaggen onto the team.”
They fell silent.
is helping you fight the Carrows? Draco responsible-for-Dumbledore’s-death Malfoy?” Ron asked in bewilderment. “And you’re certain he’s not just working with them to get all of you at the same time?”
“I heard Malfoy cheering. Or rather, Trelawney heard him, but I know it doesn’t bode well. Dumbledore will be gone tonight and that means Malfoy’s free to put this plan into work. He’s told me repeatedly that there’s something he must do, and whatever it is, he’s done it!”
Harry ignored her and continued in an angry whisper. “I know he’s the one who gave that necklace to Katie Bell! If not in person, he made someone do if for him”, he hurriedly added as Hermione looked like she was about to interrupt him again.
Harry turned, grabbing Hermione by the arm and pulling her with him when she would’ve continued staring at the fire. Malfoy grabbed Goyle by the arms and hauled him along. Crabbe’s laugh had subsided, and he seemed terrified as he passed them all. The fire wasn’t natural. When they turned a corner, it followed. From the main body of flame, chimeras and dragons emerged, snapping after them with their huge teeth and fiery claws. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had disappeared out of sight. Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to a sudden halt as a flaming snake circled before them. They were surrounded by the burning monsters, drawing closer and closer as they lashed out towards the trio.
“What if I’ve had time to rethink some of that?” Draco said, sounding uncharacteristically unsure of himself.
at all. In fact, they hadn’t talked about wanting or doing anything. Harry wondered if he’d ever spoken to Draco for as long as he had that night. Their other meetings had been more physical affairs, any words uttered at all had hardly contained more than a syllable. Their means of communication was mostly limited to grunts and gasps.
Ron’s face was gradually growing paler, until all color had drained from his cheeks.
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing with
They fell back into a routine of meeting almost every night. Harry had gotten used to Malfoy’s mood changing faster than the budding spring weather. Some days, Draco was talkative, cracking jokes in his drawling way, while on other’s, he hardly said a word and would usher Harry out as soon as they’d finished their business.
“Oh well, that’s progress I suppose”, Ron said cheerfully as she disappeared around a corner. “Why do you think Malfoy acted that way? Don’t think he’s suddenly got a crush on her, do you?”
Harry became increasingly aware that Malfoy was trying to get him alone. He wouldn’t let that happen. Harry had been forced to admit that he was weak to Draco’s pleas, and he didn’t want to risk being manipulated again. He stuck close to Ron and Hermione; Draco didn’t seem willing to talk to Harry when anyone else was around. This strategy worked for weeks, until the final quidditch game of the season approached. It would decide who’d win the House Cup, and Ron was even more nervous than usual. He’d snuck away to throw up between classes, as he so often did, and Hermione had said she needed to discuss her latest Arithmancy exam with Professor Vector and run off, just outside Snape’s classroom, leaving Harry alone and vulnerable.
“Not a word to Hermione, alright? And uh, can I have those? I didn’t get Lavender anything and she will kill me.”
The possibility that Hermione really was dating McLaggen had been up for discussion on more than one occasion during their stay at the Burrow.
They dressed in silence. Harry watched as Draco combed through his hair with his fingers. Harry had decided. He was going to say it now, but he didn’t know where to start. Did you curse Katie Bell? What are you up to? Where have you been disappearing to? Are you a Death Eater now?
Even so, Harry tried talking to Ron about it when the tense silence between them became unbearable.
“He will never give you what you want”, Riddle’s voice continued, louder as the diadem began to vibrate on the floor.
“I guess”, Draco replied unenthusiastically.
“She is very bright”, Dumbledore said with a nod of his head.
Ron looked surprised and fell silent. Then, he pointed over Harry’s shoulder. “Right there.”
“Me and Cho, in here?” Harry said in surprise, turning over to his side to lie next to Draco. “It wasn’t like that. Why, are you jealous?” Harry grinned.
“I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
“Watch Malfoy, and Snape. He’ll know what sort of protections Dumbledore’s placed over castle.”
“Well, I guess, ehm, I’ll see you later, in, eh, potions”, Harry finally said after several moments of awkward silence, hoping with all his heart that Draco wouldn’t bother to attend potions that afternoon.
“Hermione, don’t you think that’s taking spiting Ron a bit too far? You do know you’ll actually have to talk to him?” Harry said, concerned.
Harry winced at hearing Draco call Voldemort that, like a true Death Eater.
Draco sniggered. “You should’ve let me do this a long time ago, if this is how bad you want it.”
“Hermione!”
“I haven’t forgotten what you promised”, Draco said, pulling away.
“I have no master!” Draco snarled.
Harry grinned and took Draco’s cock into his mouth, bobbing his head at a steady rhythm as he worked further down the shaft until he was gagging. Pulling up for breath, he took the time to kiss and suckle Draco’s balls as the latter moaned appreciatingly. Harry then ventured further south and licked the sensitive area just below. From there, it was so close…
As the flaming monsters crept closer, they pulled Goyle onto Ron and Hermione’s broom and they shot away. Draco climbed up behind Harry, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry had to jeer sharply to the left as a chimera lunged for them with snapping teeth. Draco’s grip tightened and he buried his face into Harry’s shoulder as yet another monster had Harry sending them up into a climb. Harry’s heart was beating fast as he scanned the floor items that still were intact.
“Merlin”, Draco gasped. “I’m already close.”
Harry felt oddly jarred at this, at Draco’s conviction of Snape’s allegiance to Voldemort. Up until now, he’d never talked to anyone who seemed more certain of this than he himself was. His wand slipped out of his hand and clattered against the tiles as it hit the floor.
He almost had. When the coin had heated up he’d almost tossed it out the window. He didn’t inform Malfoy of this, but instead he stepped forward but pulled out his wand.
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “That’s funny, I was about to say the same thing.”
Harry obeyed, hardly moving at all until half his dick was buried in Draco’s ass, even though he yearned to. Then, he pulled back tentatively, earning himself a gasp, before pushing back in. After a few slow strokes, Harry picked up the pace just a bit. Draco moaned as he’d gotten used to the sensation. Harry himself couldn’t keep quiet. Each stroke had him gasping. The tight pressure around his cock was almost too much, comparable only to the wet sensation of Draco’s mouth. Draco had one hand wrapped around his own cock, the other grabbed onto Harry’s shoulder, hard.
“What’s this? No chocolate? No flowers? It is Valentine’s Day, after all, Potter”, Draco said in mock offence from where he lay splayed across the bed when Harry entered the Room of Requirement.
Finally, Harry could breathe again. He pulled the cloak off and sat up, feeling relieved but unsatisfied. Draco was sitting up too, doing up his shirt again with hands that trembled slightly.
Sorry for the slow update. I've been a little busy (also I hadn't even started writing this part when I published the last chapter, and that's just me planning poorly).
Draco raised himself up on an elbow and stared down at Harry reproachfully. “Firstly, of course not – only Weasley is that stupid – and secondly, she’s not my girlfriend.”
“Why? Do you want to take me?” he sneered.
He moved down toward the end of the bed and positioned himself between Draco’s thighs. Draco breathed out heavily as Harry licked the tip of his dick in a circular motion.
“What?” he asked, looking up.
“Just say whatever it is you want to say.”
“You did the best you could”, Ron said, and Hermione agreed.
Harry found himself fighting the urge to grasp Draco’s hand.
“Well, gee, thanks, that surely makes up for your daddy being a Death Eater and all that. I’m sure cursing me could earn him a few Death Eater points back, so you might want to reconsider that one.”
“Then I suggest you do a bit less talking”, Draco replied, pulling Harry back in for a kiss.
“Malfoy’s good at potions you know, it wasn’t all just ass kissing”, she said. Then she lowered her voice and glanced around. “He was actually being
Instead, he pretended to immerse himself in Snape’s latest defense against the dark arts assignment. When he thought Ron and Hermione weren’t looking he slipped out the Marauder’s map and scanned the corridors for Malfoy – but he was nowhere to be found.
“Who did this to you?” Harry breathed.
Harry sat up, making Draco shift away from him. “You broke my nose!”
“Can’t blame them”, Ron muttered.
February turns into March and Ron has the worst birthday of his life.
Harry tried to shoot water at the flames, but it evaporated as soon as it emerged from the tip of his wand.
More silence, then Draco angrily said: “Stop looking at me like that, I know what you’re trying to do. It won’t work.”
Their first class for the day was potions. Once the three of them entered the classroom, they found it had been rearranged. The desks usually stood in groups of threes, but now they’d been split into pairs of twos. In the middle of the room stood a large cauldron, filled with a pearly white liquid that sent spirals of steam up towards the ceiling.
“Oh you know, blood and torture. I spent the better part of Easter break hanging upside down from the ceiling”, Draco said.
Harry couldn’t say he’d been surprised to see Draco leaving the Great Hall, following behind Crabbe and Goyle and with Pansy Parkinson by his side. In fact, he was almost relieved. He needed to focus on the task at hand, not be distracted by wondering if Malfoy would betray them. Even so, he would never truly know where Draco’s heart had been once he’d left the castle. So, watching Ron and Hermione finally give up all pretense and kiss was bittersweet. He was happy for them, of course. Yet he couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness at knowing that the only intimate relationship he’d likely ever have, unless they somehow managed to survive the night, had ended in death and betrayal. Just from the looks of ecstasy on Ron and Hermione’s faces, Harry could tell that he’d never experienced what they had.
“Then what do you want?” Harry almost shouted, pushing the image of her out of his head.
Draco nodded and looked away, shoulders sagging slightly. Harry wondered if it had all been a ploy to get to sleep with him after all.
“Draco!” Harry cried and tossed him the giant tooth.
“Wait”, Draco said, pulling away.
“Don’t tell me you even followed him into the toilet!”
Harry thought finally having proof that Draco was doing something would’ve brought him joy, especially after their most recent falling out. Still he found himself feeling bad for Draco. He didn’t seem to want the assignment he’d been given. It sounded more like it had been forced upon him. Harry remembered the scars on Draco’s back and the terrible magic that must’ve been used to bring about wounds like that. Either way, it seemed like Draco had mostly abandoned whatever his mission was around the time he and Harry had started meeting up after curfew. Perhaps it had been wrong to judge so quickly, Harry thought, and now he knew Snape bore at least part of the blame, the way he’d been pushing Draco to continue.
“Potter?” Draco said uncertainly into thin air, having looked around the seemingly empty room.
Harry let out a low, ferocious grunt. He wanted to curse Malfoy. He wanted to send him flying across the room. Instead, he mustered all his willpower and turned on his heels, bursting out of the room before things truly got ugly.
Ron’s eyes narrowed at the mention of Hermione’s name. “When’s she not snappy? But nah, mate, I don’t think so. Think I saw her head up to bed early, after… you know.”
Harry laughed and glanced over to Ron’s bed. “Is that from Lavender?”
“Well, I told you I don’t like girls, so now you have to tell me something about you. Just to make us even.”
Draco didn’t turn around to look at them again. “It could be. I don’t know”, was all he said.
“He doesn’t have a Dark Mark”, Harry blurted out without thinking.
“Oh, ehm, well…”
“Maybe”, Ron said and reached out and snagged another piece. “Or maybe Luna, as a thank you for the Christmas party invite? Although I suppose it’s a bit late for that, and Looney Lovegood probably wouldn’t send chocolates to begin with. She’d send a rotten old beat and tell you it warded off Snotcrinkle Turdclanks or something like that.”
Harry was filled with a dawning sense of mortification since he could very well imagine who Padma had seen, but he had to at least try and feign nonchalance. “Who?”
Harry was still boiling with rage. “You shouldn’t! He’s helped Malfoy with something, and now they’ve done it and… He was cheering, in the Room of Requirement. He’s succeeded, and he did curse Katie, and Ron…” He was rambling, and he knew that Dumbledore wouldn’t respond well to it. The headmaster had already scolded him for his accusation during their previous meetings. “I know he’s responsible, sir! He told me.”
He then proceeded to snatch the box from Harry and kick the bear underneath the bed. Before Harry could protest, he’d disappeared out of the room.
Some color rose to Draco’s cheeks. “I don’t, I just send her away. Plead with her or send her off to do some menial task I’ll tell her is very important, like watching the owlery or keeping track of who goes into the prefect’s bathroom. She quite likes that one.”
With a gasp Harry went harder and faster, managing a few more thrusts before he pulled out, just after Draco shuttered and spilled his seed onto his own stomach. Harry’s cum mixed in moments later and once he was done, Harry collapsed onto the bed next to Draco.
Draco and Harry hauled Dobby to bed by grabbing one arm each. This only seemed to upset Dobby further, so at last Draco had to step out of the room. When Harry finally reappeared, Draco looked genuinely worried.
Draco’s hair was a mess from Harry’s fingers tangling in it, his lips swollen and eyes wide and expectant. Harry nodded. Yes, he very much still wanted to.
Either Draco didn’t hear Harry’s comment, or he didn’t deem it worthy of a reply. After a few minutes of silence, he turned back to Harry, the anger washed away.
“Well, most of it. Not for leaving you on the train though.”
Harry stifled a laugh. “What, does your girlfriend think you’re dumping her for a ghost?”
“Could I really?”
“That was something”, Harry said once he could finally breathe normally again.
Crabbe snarled in rage and tore free from Malfoy’s grip. Then he turned around, grabbed Malfoy by the shoulder and pushed him down in front of himself and Goyle. Malfoy had to let go of his wand to catch himself, or he’d fall flat on the floor. It rolled off to the side to rest at the foot of an old cabinet. He tried to rise, but Crabbe pushed him back down to his knees.
At first the kiss was aggressive, Draco’s lips hard and tense, as if it was meant to be a blow to the face – as if it was meant to hurt. But then Draco’s lips relaxed and became soft against Harry’s as salty tears mixed with saliva. For a moment, Harry lay completely still. His mind couldn’t process what was happening. He was drawing a blank. As Draco began to pull away, Harry’s body finally kicked into motion. He reached up and grabbed onto Draco’s collar to pull him down and kiss him back. He couldn’t think, only do, only follow his impulse. It was purely instinct, he told himself afterwards. He felt like he had so many times before when he’d been in mortal danger, as if thinking would only impede him, like he instinctively knew what to do and there was no time to stop and consider his options. So, he parted his lips slightly wider and felt Draco’s tongue brush against them. He released Draco’s collar and placed one hand on the small of Draco’s back and the other grasped his blonde hair. When Draco’s hips pushed down slightly, Harry bucked his upward, which earned him a slight gasp between the kisses.
Ron scratched the back of his head. “Maybe not. But Harry, I have to say she is right on this one. You know I think Malfoy’s the biggest prick to walk the Earth, but you seem… A bit bonkers actually.”
Immediately after saying this, Dobby flung himself headfirst towards the fire, as if he was about to fling himself into the flames for having said such a thing about his former master. Harry had expected as much and seized Dobby around the waist and lifted the flailing elf into the air before he could get far.
“Yes”, Narcissa said slowly, eyeing Hermione up and down. “I recognize her from The Prophet, and I believe we saw her in Madam Malkin’s with the Potter boy last year, wasn’t it so Draco? Isn’t that the Granger girl?”
He slipped out the door after listening for footsteps and hurried down into the Slytherin common room, which was starting to fill up with students again. When someone came through the secret passage in the wall, Harry slipped past them. Well out in the corridor, he sank down to the floor and waited.
“This? Fighting in bathrooms, you mean?”
Harry didn’t know what to say. In hindsight, it seemed like the obvious course of action. He hadn’t been thinking then either, just acting on his instincts that told him to kiss back. Then of course, there had been the second time, and the third, and the fourth, and so on, and he’d deliberately gone back. Perhaps it was the sixth year stress that had finally worn him down, or, he had to entertain the possibility, he’d done it because he wanted to, and he hadn’t cared to think too hard about the consequences.
“Dobby”, Harry croaked, remembering how the elf had decorated the Room of Requirement in a similar manner for Christmas the year before.
Hermione’s eyes narrowed in suspicion. “How exactly do you know that?”
Harry turned slightly pink. “The last part. That you’re sorry.”
“Dumbledore said I have a choice”, Draco said, sounding sincere for the first time. “He said it wasn’t too late for me.”
“Dobby is very pleased!” The house-elf said, but without sounding so. His big eyes were set on Malfoy and Harry thought he’d never seen the elf look hostile before. “Harry Potter must forgive Dobby, but young master Malfoy is a very, very bad boy! Harry Potter shouldn’t be spending time with such vile wizards!”
“What, don’t you want me to make you cum?” Harry said.
Harry snuck a chaste kiss. “Next time.”
“Harry, what’s going on?” Hermione asked with a concerned look on her face.
“I’m not going. Perhaps, if you also weren’t going… Well, the castle will be deserted.”
Fred and Percy were shouting gleefully at each other when the world suddenly turned upside down. Harry was flung off his feet as everything around him seemed to disintegrate. He flew through the air, desperately clinging to his wand, and landed hard on the stone floor, debris raining over him. It took him a few seconds to understand what had happened. The sudden rush of cold air made him realize that the outside wall had been blown to pieces in an attack. As soon as the realization hit him, he was filled with a sense of dread. His ears were ringing from the sound of the explosion that had torn the castle apart, but he could make out screaming. He struggled to free himself from the rubble that had fallen on top of him, not caring about the blood that dripped into his eyes.
There was still over a week until the Hogsmeade trip and longer still until Christmas break. The days passed by as usual, with class, homework, secret meetings, and Romilda Vane trying to slip him love potion.
“Harry.” Draco’s own rhythm became unsteady as Harry’s finger slipped inside.
“What part of it?”
He pulled out a chair and sat down next to Harry, ignoring Hermione sitting on Harry’s other side.
Draco didn’t need to be told twice; without even bothering to rearrange his clothing he rushed past Ron and Hermione and out into the corridor, leaving the three friends in silence.
“I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
Draco steadied himself on an elbow and reached out and ran a finger along Harry’s nose.
Harry set off further into the maze. He could hear Ron and Hermione’s footsteps, softer and softer as their paths lead them in different directions. He quickened his pace, his eyes scanning the piles for familiar objects. He was running, his breath loud in his ears. Deeper and deeper. He couldn’t hear Ron and Hermione anymore; they must’ve gotten too far apart. And then there it was, right in front of him. A diadem on top of a bust of an old man with a wig on his head. He stretched out his hand, only a few more steps and then…
The world seemed to slow. Harry’s heart sank, and Ron let out a soft sob. Then, Fred coughed and opened his eyes.
A strange noise came from above, like metal scraping against metal. They all looked up just in time to see the crystal chandelier wobble, metal links splitting open as it keened over to one side. Then the last links holding it up gave way as well, and it came crashing to the floor in a flurry of metal and crystal. Bellatrix let go of Hermione and flung herself out of the way. Hermione and the unlucky Griphook, who hadn't stirred during the battle, didn’t have a chance to get away and were caught underneath the metal body as the crystals shattered and flew across the room. Ron ran towards them in the confusion that ensued, and Harry saw his own chance.
“What?” Draco said. “I’m not ill. I just thought I owed you an apology.”
The various spells that had gone awry had hit walls and caused some to start to collapse and others to sway ominously.
Then he pressed a golden galleon into Harry’s palm.
She looked over at Ron, who whispered to Harry: “I think she might be part basilisk. I swear I lost all sensation in my left leg when she looked at me like that.”
“How long ‘has it all just sort of happened for’?” Ron said dryly.
“They claim to have captured Potter”, Narcissa said and Harry was shoved forward by Greyback. He stumbled – he was still bound to the others and couldn’t move much more than a few steps forward – but managed to stay upright. “Draco, dear, come here and have a look.”
saved my life.”
”, he pleaded. “The thing he wanted me to do, I stopped. I should’ve gotten that bottle back, but I didn’t.  I never meant for Weasley to drink it. I don’t want to be that person anymore. I’m not that person anymore”, he repeated.
A cheer went up as the trio shook hands and got their hair ruffled by the crowd. Harry looked around in bewilderment, at the hollow and scarred faces of his classmates, and at the absurdly large room. Hammocks were suspended from the ceiling and tapestries hung on the walls: the lion of Gryffindor, Hufflepuff’s badger, the Ravenclaw’s bronze eagle, and there, almost hidden in a corner, gleamed Slytherin’s silver snake.
“Here”, Draco said, pulling out the faded old tiara from a pocket. It was covered in soot, but the engraved words “Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure” were still visible. “I spotted it when I was dragging Goyle away.”
There was a thud, like a body hitting the floor and Ron cried out Hermione’s name again.
“Oh”, Ron said, looking confused, but Harry knew if he stopped to explain it all, Ron would object and Draco would be gone again.
“So, I suppose we can’t go back to Myrtle’s bathroom for a while”, Harry said at last.
Filch turned around and hurried out of the room as fast as he could manage, but Mrs. Norris stood by the door, her big yellow eyes gleaming in the dark. Harry could’ve sworn she was staring straight at him. Then Filch called for her and she disappeared, the door slamming shut behind her.
“Please, Hermione. I don’t have time to discuss this further.”
Hermione sat in silence for a moment.
They talked for what seemed like hours and Harry was forced to answer all their questions. Ron’s especially grew more prying, and Harry suddenly felt more compassion for Hermione and Ginny, who’d been forced to put up with Ron scrutinizing their relationships for the last few years. When Ron at last asked who’d done what to who, Hermione was the one to intervene.
“The Room of Requirement of course!” Neville grinned proudly and told the story of how he’d been forced to hide from the Carrows. “Over time, more and more students showed up, and so the room changed. At first it was much smaller, and there was only the Gryffindor lion and one hammock, and then it grew to accommodate us all.”
“I thought we were over this”, Hermione groaned. “Why would Malfoy want to poison Slughorn?”
“What happened, happened”, Ron filled in. “I know, Harry. It’s a lot to process, that’s all. Still doesn’t explain why you didn’t turn him into a frog the first time he came at you.”
“We don’t want any company tonight”, Draco said slyly as Harry approached.
“Well, there’s one more thing”, Harry said, lifting his head off Draco’s chest to study his face. “I was thinking that… eh… since I’ve been doing you, it’s about time that you… do me.”
“What?” Harry asked, looking up.
Draco slowly backed them up into a stall, locking the door behind them. He pushed Harry down onto to toilet seat and then sat down straddling him and resumed the kiss. Harry slipped his hands underneath Draco’s robes and tugged his shirt loose, so he could run his fingers over the soft skin on Draco’s hips. Draco’s lips strayed from Harry’s mouth and wandered down his neck, making Harry shiver and sigh. They were pressed so close together, Harry could feel Draco’s hard-on press against his stomach, and he felt his own press up against Draco’s ass. As if Draco could read his mind, he suddenly slid back down towards Harry’s knees and let his hands drop to just above Harry’s trousers.
at the top of his lungs. Bellatrix turned around in surprise and pointed her wand at him, but too late. Ron’s Expelliarmus spell made her wand sail into the air towards Ron, so Harry could leap and grab it. He saw Lucius moving towards them with a hand fumbling around in his robe pocket, as if he was searching for his wand, but instead Harry pointed his wand at Greyback.
“No”, Ron said, still sniggering. “It’s just… well, look.”
Harry had gotten so used to being the best in class that he almost felt offended when Slughorn stopped by Draco and Hermione’s cauldron and exclaimed: ”Wonderful, simply wonderful! It’s nearly perfect.”
The spells passed each other midair, only inches apart, and both wands went flying out of their owner’s hands. Harry’s went up into the air and landed behind him, while Draco’s flew to the side and rolled underneath the stalls. Harry dove for his wand, and for a moment he thought Draco was doing the same thing, before he realized Draco was trying to tackle him.
Harry relaxed ever so slightly. Even so, he couldn’t quite shake the feeling of dread that had taken hold of him when he’d thought Fred was dead.
“Guess that makes us even”, Draco said, letting his fingers brush against Harry’s back.
Harry had his wand resting against his palm. Of course, it wasn’t truly his wand – that was tucked away safely in the pouch Hagrid had given him. It was the hawthorn wand with the unicorn core. Draco’s wand. He’d won it, so it obeyed him. Even so, using it made him uneasy. What had happened to Draco after they escaped? Nothing pleasant, he was certain.
Harry hadn’t been entirely wrong after all, although it brought him no joy.
Harry pulled out the hawthorn wand. “I’m keeping it.”
“Is this okay? I mean, do you want me to, ehr”, he broke off.
Draco groaned. “Damn that blasted girl, and Weasley too. Pansy has been all over me this whole week.”
disgusting.”
“Our common room is on there too?” Draco exclaimed in disbelief and stared down towards the dots of Slytherin students on the bottom part of the parchment.
Out of all the things Harry could have imagined Draco ever saying to him at the start of the year, this was not one of them.
After that, they fell into somewhat of a routine. Harry would check the map after dinner and if Draco was in Myrtle’s bathroom and the coast was clear, he’d sneak down there, and they’d repeat what had happened that Saturday morning. At first it was a one-sided affair, with Draco swatting Harry’s hand away while he was getting Harry off, until Harry finally grabbed onto his shoulders and said: “Draco, I want to make you feel good, it’s not a you did me, so I’ll do you type of thing.” At which Draco relented and let Harry slip a hand down his trousers.
“Well, it makes sense”, Harry continued in a lower voice, figuring he might as well dive in now that he’d scathed the surface. “He keeps disappearing off the map – and the chamber wouldn’t be on the map – and basilisk venom, right, it’s extremely dangerous, only one known cure and all of that. Voldemort could’ve taught him how to get in. It makes sense!”
“Use this”, he urged.
It was only now he realized that not feeling comfortable in telling Ron and Hermione about it should’ve been the first clue that what he was doing wasn’t entirely right.
“Ah, Miss Granger, looks like Mr. Malfoy will be your partner for today.” Slughorn said, pointing an angry looking Hermione towards an equally sour faced Draco.
“Fred!” Percy exclaimed.
“Just lovely, isn’t it?” Ron grinned. “You also got these”, he added, handing Harry a heart shaped box of chocolates.
“Stop”, Malfoy cried in a shrill, panicked voice. “Don’t kill him!”
Hermione blushed and said indignantly: “Well, I couldn’t phantom anyone else quite so horrible you couldn’t tell us, oh ehm, me, about it. Unless it’s Lavender?” She sounded almost hopeful.
Harry thought he knew which elf Draco was talking about, thinking back to the Christmas gift filled with maggots he’d received. Despite his ill feelings towards Kreacher he couldn’t stop himself from saying: “You shouldn’t talk about them like that. They are thinking creatures like any of us, perhaps more than the likes of some of your friends.”
Draco stood rocking back and forth on his heel for a bit, biting his lip and uncertain of what to say.
“Your attempts seemed feeble, I have to say. Like your heart wasn’t in it. After all, there was little chance of either of the two packages ever reaching me, and bad luck anyone else got hurt.”
“So now you’re helping the D.A?” Harry asked when Draco didn’t continue.
“I guess”, was all he said.
“Draco?” Harry asked a while later.
“What about the prefect’s bathroom?” Harry asked and then added, cursing himself for not thinking of it earlier, he added: “Or the Room of Requirement?”
Harry regretfully remembered how Draco had come to possess one of those coins, how he’d caught them and hauled them off to Umbridge. An unwanted flash of memories of all the times Draco had called Hermione a mudblood followed. Then, how Lucius Malfoy had taunted Harry at the Ministry of Magic that spring, how Sirius had… Suddenly rage boiled up inside of Harry. How could he have been so reckless? How could he look past every cruel and petty thing Malfoy had done to him and his friends? And for what, his own pleasure? Harry stepped forward, leaning down over Malfoy, who smirked and stretched out his hands towards Harry, thinking that they’d resume their usual business. He looked surprised but not displeased, as Harry grabbed hold of his robes and pulled him off the desk, so he tumbled backwards onto the floor with Harry on top of him.
Ron and Hermione groaned in unison and exchanged a knowing look.
“As a gag, of course. Don’t flatter yourself any more than you already do. So, did you eat it?”
Draco snorted. “They must’ve realized the room’s potential, if they were at all familiar with teens.”
“Couldn’t that be his scar, stretched out?” Lucius continued and pointed to the thin jagged line that stretched across Harry’s bloated forehead.
“Why would I care about the fucking dia-dum?” Crabbe almost shouted in Malfoy’s face.
“Then cum!”
Draco nodded and with one last look at Harry, he turned and left.
Now it was Harry’s turn to blush. He couldn’t help but remember that time in their fourth year when Myrtle had visited him in the bath.
“Harry?”
As soon as he was out in the corridor, Harry took off running. How could he have been so stupid? It made perfect sense – The Chamber of Secrets wouldn’t be on the map, and if Draco was a Death Eater now, Lord Voldemort could’ve taught him how to open it. What exactly he was doing down there, Harry wasn’t sure, but perhaps he was after basilisk venom to try and poison whoever had been the intended recipient of that cursed necklace. Surely that was it, Harry thought as he stumbled down the last flight of stairs, took a turn and burst through the bathroom door with a stitch burning in his left side.
“Draco”, he moaned. “I’m going to…”
“What?” Draco startled. “Oh, I flushed her into the lake, before, eh…” He broke off.
“You’re not a murderer, Draco.”
“We will be rewarded”, Crabbe said, still grinning. “We hid when the others left, to bring you to him.”
At this and Hermione’s tone of absolute despair, Harry burst out laughing. “Parkinson? You think I’m secretly seeing Pansy Parkinson?”
The Fat Lady was gone, but the portrait hole was open. Harry had just climbed through when he heard someone behind him.
“What about you and Parkinson then?” Harry asked, trying his best to sound nonchalant.
“Why?” Harry continued.
Harry forcibly turned back to Bellatrix. Greyback was already starting to stir behind her. She pulled Hermione forward so they were standing underneath the grand chandelier. The knife pricked Hermione’s skin again and fresh blood welled forward and Ron looked like he might lunge at Bellatrix, despite being wandless.
Three weeks after what Harry now referred to as
The surprise in his voice sounded genuine and Harry noted the absence of his otherwise ever-present sneer. Being wrong didn’t exactly please Harry.
“Unbreakable oath”, Ron whispered as they were preparing that night’s dinner in the kitchen in the Burrow. “That one’s no joke.”
Harry felt fresh anger wash over him. He’d expected Malfoy to get angry and scream or skirt the subject entirely, not to confess. He wanted an excuse to curse Malfoy, but Malfoy seemed determined not to give him one. Although Harry found that his wand was now clutched in his right hand – he didn’t know quite how that had happened – Malfoy had made no attempt to reach for his own. The word
didn’t do anything to it, if that’s what you’re insinuating. It’s just, I gave it to a house elf to deliver it to you and that ugly old thing said something about maggots… Seemed senile, if you ask me. I don’t know why Dumbledore let’s unwashed ones like that prepare our food.”
“Can it have anything to do with why you’re here, Harry?” Neville turned to Harry to ask.
“It wasn’t easy to manage it, at times it seemed impossible… Even so, I could’ve finished long ago if I hadn’t gotten … distracted”, Draco admitted. “But I understand now, there’s no use in fighting any of this. It must be this way. I have to do it.”
After they were dismissed, a beaming Hermione caught up to Harry, who’d been fast to exit the classroom to avoid the conversation that inevitably would follow.
“We’d better split up”, he said.
Draco, brushing off his robes one last time before deeming himself presentable, stalked towards the door without another word. Before exiting, he turned back to Harry.
At this, Harry’s eyes narrowed. “Ron ate it. Why? Shouldn’t he have?”
Draco laughed a cold, disdainful, laugh. “Help me? Potter, the only way you could help me is by distracting me from all the outrageous shit that goes on in this rathole. I don’t need or want anything else from you.”
“I’ve been distracted”, he said so quietly it was almost inaudible. Then he looked over at Harry. “If that’s what you want, then go. I won’t chase after you again.”
“I just remembered that I have to go talk to Hagrid”, he lied, not even trying to come up with a plausible explanation.
“Stand up”, Draco repeated in a tone that didn’t allow for refusal.
“Where you go, we go”, Ron said and there was such finality in his voice that Harry swallowed his protests.
“Presumptuous as always, Potter”, Malfoy muttered. “I wouldn’t go in there if I were you, Myrtle’s in quite a mood and if I try and flush her down the lake again she said she’d raise half the school.”
“How’s McLaggen doing?” He retorted. “Did you write a lot over the break?”
Harry nodded and beckoned Draco forward, so he could suck him hard again. Then, Draco moved back down and repositioned himself between Harry’s legs. Harry thought it would feel unnerving to submit to Draco in such a manner, but it felt natural, like everything they’d done had led them to the moment when Draco’s cock pushed against Harry. It didn’t feel like submitting at all, there was nothing demanding or domineering about the way Draco slowly moved inside of Harry, repeatedly asking if it felt okay. Harry nodded at this, pushing towards Draco, making him go faster and deeper. Draco gasped as his cock buried into Harry, moaned as he pulled away and pushed back in. Harry let go of the last bit of tension and immerged himself in the sensation of Draco’s throbbing dick pushing into him. Harry’s hand found its way to his cock and pumped in time with the strokes. He looked up at Draco, whose face was red, eyes unfocused and mouth hanging open. Just a few moments and Harry was coming, spilling onto his stomach, and then Draco was coming too, having pulled out so his seed mixed with Harry’s.
“Alright lads off you go,” the guard said, ushering them out of the boat. Harry got out first, then helped Malfoy out, who was still leaning into the contact.
“Mr. Potter, you’re back soon. And with Mr. Malfoy. Did you come straight from Azkaban?” Chief Ragnok asked as soon as they walked through the door. Harry noticed there were two seats on their side of the desk now. Before Harry could reply, Malfoy started yelling.
“Harry Potter?” The guard asked once Harry was close enough. Harry nodded. “Kingsley said you’d be coming. You got the order?” Figuring that was the parchment, Harry handed it over. After scanning it quickly, the guard nodded. “Everything’s in order. I’ll get us across the lake, but that’s as far as I go. You’ll have to use your own patronus inside.” As if on cue, a small bird flew from a branch onto the guard’s shoulder. At the guard’s gesture, Harry climbed inside the little boat, magic keeping it from rocking. When the guard stepped in, he flicked his wand, and the boat quickly moved through the water. Feeling the cold breeze, Harry tried not to think about Sirius spending twelve years locked up here. Harry hadn’t even been inside, but the air was oppressive, sinking through his clothes. He conjured a cloak, forgetting it in his rush this morning to Gringotts. Had that really been this morning? It felt like a lifetime ago. A small bump pulled him out of his thoughts. They had arrived on the island. The pair stepped out of the boat and started walking toward the building.
“Yes.” Malfoy snapped, sneering at Harry. His glare then softened into exhaustion. “I’m tired, so if you could please show me to a room…”
Chief Ragnok
Concerned, Harry abandoned his breakfast and flooed directly to Gringotts. He approached the nearest teller, holding his letter.
“So you need to go talk to him,” Kingsley said. Harry glared up at him.
The closer he got to the building, the worse it looked. All dark exposed stone, tall and broken off at the top. Harry hoped he wouldn’t have to go up that far. The inside didn’t look much better. The stone walls and floor gave no insulation from the cold winds. As his stag walked along, Harry could see the prisoners relaxing and leaning towards it, then shivering when it walked away. He pulled his cloak tighter to stop himself from shivering, despite being close to his patronus.
“What contract?” Malfoy asked, still shaking. Harry figured that was a no. He pulled out the key and stuck it in the lock, twisting it, and heard a sharp click. He pulled the door open. “What in Merlin’s name are you doing, Potter?”
Signed, Benjamin Potter, Pericles Malfoy 1902
“I stop here,” The guard said, stopping. “Just bring him out with you. Here’s the key.” He pulled a key off his key hook, handing it to Harry. Harry took it. “I trust you can make a patronus?”
“This is illegal,” Was all Malfoy said.
Gringotts London Branch
“It wasn’t when it was made,” Ragnok replied. Malfoy sighed and put his head in his hands. After a minute he stood up and turned towards Harry.
“Thank you for your help,” Harry said to the guard, who nodded in reply. He pulled the portkey out of his pocket, and after making sure Malfoy was holding onto it, tapped it with his wand. Feeling a tug beneath his navel and after the feeling of going through a tube, they appeared in a cozy sitting area.
Harry walked inside the cell, the stag standing guard outside the door. He took his cloak off and wrapped it around Malfoy’s shoulders. He hesitantly grasped Malfoy’s upper arm, helping him up. Malfoy melted into it.
“You need to stay awake; we have a meeting at Gringotts” Harry said, leading Malfoy out of the cell, following his stag as it led the way back to the boat. The walk back seemed shorter, Harry practically dragging Malfoy along. The guard said nothing as they approached, just motioning them toward the boat. They had almost reached the mainland when Malfoy seemed to break out of his shock.
“Yes,” Harry said, nodding. “I really can’t thank you enough-“
Now it had been two months since the final battle, and the house was in better condition than ever. Kreacher was needed at Hogwarts for the rebuilding, and would stay there for the next school year due to the large number of house elf casualties resulting from the final battle. Ready to start his morning despite his lack of sleep, Harry walked down the stairs and into the kitchen. He didn’t have much on his agenda today, seeing as the house was largely finished, but there were still a few rooms on the highest levels he could touch up. He was buttering his toast and pointedly not thinking about the impending doom that was his future, when an owl flew through the open window. Curiosity interrupting his breakfast, he opened the letter, ripping through the wax seal of Gringotts.
“I’ll explain when we get to Gringotts. I have a portkey. You need to read the contract.” Harry said
“What is this?” He asked, glaring at Harry. “Why are we here? What is going on?!”
“I need to take him to live with me. Well, first to Gringotts, then home,” Harry said. He fidgeted, his eyes going back to the floor. “I hate to ask this, but do you think you could set his trial date sooner? I understand if you can’t but-“
“You’ve got to take a bath, you smell like shit,” Harry said. “I’ll help you if you need me to, and then you can sleep.” Harry started up the stairs to the guest bedroom across from his, which he knew had a bathtub. Once inside the bathroom, harry set Malfoy on the floor, propped up against the wall, and started fiddling with the taps to get the water temperature right. After putting the stopper and a couple healing potions he had stocked into the bath, he looked at Malfoy.
“You can’t sleep like that,” Harry said, glancing at Malfoy’s dirt covered clothes. Worry churned in his stomach. “Besides, you’re probably starving. Food and a bath first, then you can sleep.” Malfoy nodded, looking too tired to argue. Harry practically carried Malfoy into the kitchen and set him down in a chair before turning to the counter and thinking. He knew Malfoy probably hadn’t had a good meal in months, so he would need something easy to the stomach. Soup it is, Harry thought, grabbing a can of Chicken Noodle from the cabinet.
“You’re in my custody now,” Harry said softly. “We’re going to Gringotts.”
“Yes, my schedule today is flexible. Here is a portkey directly into a waiting room in the bank. You will want to avoid the Ally on your return.” Chief Ragnok said.
Finally, the stag stopped outside a cell on the end of a hallway. When Harry looked inside, he almost didn’t recognize who he saw. Platinum hair was dirty atop the shivering figure sitting hunched up against the wall. Even the patronus couldn’t stop the figure from shaking. Tired grey eyes met his own. The man sighed and leaned his head against the wall.
“Here are the coordinates to Azkaban,” Kingsley said, jotting down a few numbers on the edge of some parchment. He tore the edge off and handed it to Harry. “You can apparate there. We don’t have any guards to spare, I’m afraid, but I can sign him off into your care until his trial, which will be in two days and private. You’ve submitted your written statement?”
“Potter, what the bloody hell is going on?” Malfoy asked, frustrated. Before Harry could reply, they heard another voice.
“Sorry, he’s busy with post-war relief. I’ll go see him,” Harry said standing up. “If I can manage it, could I bring Malfoy here later today? If he’s to be my husband, I can’t just leave him in Azkaban.”
“I am sure. By the end of this month you will marry Draco Malfoy or face the consequences. Given the fact that Mr. Malfoy currently awaits trial in Azkaban prison, we have sent a notice to the minister, but according to our seal enchantments, he has not opened it yet.” Chief Ragnok said, his tone giving away his annoyance.
Harry knocked on the minister’s door, entering once he heard Kingsley sigh.
Harry shivered, looking around. The dementors came back after the war to guard their island home. Spotting a guard near a paddleboat, Harry started walking towards him.
“Thank you. I’ll owl if I can’t be back today” Harry said, swiftly leaving the bank, and apparated to the ministry.
“You need to read this.” Harry said, shoving the letter at Kingsley. Seeing Harry’s urgency, Kingsley pulled out the letter and briefly read it.
“What do you mean I’m in your custody? Why am I leaving? My trial-“
“I anticipated that,” He said, handing the copy to Harry. “Good day gentlemen.”
“Ah, Mr. Potter. You must be here to discuss the contract. I am Chief Ragnok, Head of the London Branch of Gringotts,”
Potter-Malfoy Marriage Contract
Harry nodded, taking the parchment. He pressed his hand to the small of Malfoy’s back, who leaned into it, and he led them back near the main entrance where he offered Malfoy his arm. Malfoy looked at him warily before taking it, and Harry apparated them to Grimmauld Place.
“This way gentlemen,” a goblin said from a doorway. “The Chief will see you now.” Ignoring Malfoy’s whispered questions along the way, they started down the hallway toward Chief Ragnok’s office. Harry was still holding onto Malfoy’s arm when they came to the familiar door.
“Harry, you saved our world and never asked for anything,” Kingsley said, seriously. He cracked a smile. “You’re allowed a bit of special treatment.”
“Thank you, sir,” Harry said. He took the parchment being handed to him, and with a nod, left the office. Once he got to the apparation point, he checked the coordinates and in a bang, apparated outside Azkaban.
“ Come on Malfoy,” Harry said standing and reaching towards the other boy. “You’ve got to take a bath before you fall asleep.” The only response he got was a grunt. Sighing, Harry scooped him up under the knees and straitened up, resolving to carry Malfoy to the bathroom. The movement got a reaction out of Malfoy.
Deeming Malfoy clean enough, he helped the nearly sleeping boy out of the tub and wrapped him in the fluffy towel he had stuck a warming charm on. Harry helped Malfoy put on the underwear and sweatpants, which hung off his hips, only staying up because of the string on the waist band. The Shirt made Malfoy look even smaller, and Harry carried his ex-rival to bed.
“Can we go? I’m tired” Malfoy said, no expression on his face. Harry nodded, then looked at Ragnok.
“It’s my pleasure, Harry,” Kingsley said with a soft smile. “Give this to the guards, it puts Draco Malfoy into your custody. Bring him to my office in two days. I’ll owl you with the details.”
“It says something to do with a marriage contract for Draco Malfoy,” Kingsley said, looking back up at Harry. “What does this have to do with you?”
“Malfoy,” He said, knocking slightly. I’m coming in.” He pushed the door open to see Malfoy still sitting on the floor, now naked, rags from Azkaban now thrown haphazardly against the opposite wall. His knees were drawn up to his chest and she was shivering again, but Harry now could see trails of bruises all across this torso and legs. Sighing in pity, Harry pulled Malfoy into his chest. He tried to get Malfoy’s feet under him, but his knees kept buckling, so Harry gave up quickly. He pulled Malfoy up and into the bathtub. At first, Malfoy gasped at the warm water, but soon relaxed into the tub. Harry grabbed a bottle of shampoo and sat behind Malfoy outside the tub. Gathering shampoo in his hand, he gently tilted Malfoy’s head back and started working in the shampoo. Malfoy groaned and leant into Harry’s hands. Harry cupped some water in his hands and slowly rinsed out Malfoy’s hair. He made quick, careful work of washing Malfoy’s body, trying to avoid his bruises, feeling guilt when Malfoy tensed from pain.
“It’s a contract with me,” Harry explained tiredly, his eyes toward the floor. “Our great-great grandfathers set it up. We have to get married and have two kids, or we and any kids we might have will have their magic taken. Once we’ve both read it, we have to live together. I don’t know if he’s read it yet.”
It was two months after the final battle and Harry didn’t know what to do next. Hermione, after returning her parents’ memories and bringing them back from Australia, was studying privately to take her N.E.W.T.S. at the end of the summer, then immediately leaving to teach Transfiguration at Hogwarts for a year as McGonagall hadn’t been able to find a replacement for herself, and couldn’t teach full time while being the Headmistress. Ron had jumped at the invitation to start Auror training early, and without needing to take his N.E.W.T.S. Harry had gotten the same invitation but had turned it down. After defeating Voldemort, he was done. He was tired. So, when Hermione suggested he go fix up Grimmauld Place, he thought he would relax and stretch the work out and move on from the war.
“Are you sure there is no way out of this?” Harry asked after reading the contract through twice. He thought he should feel angry, but he just felt hopeless. He slumped back in his chair, defeated.
“I… I, uhm… Ran into him in the bathroom and he had his sleeves rolled up.”
But more jets of light filled the room as Draco screamed in fury, and Harry turned and fled out of the room.
Once Harry had finished, Hermione said: “You don’t think…”
Neville shrugged. “I had a close call, though. After the first day or so I got very hungry. I tried to sneak into the kitchen, but I ran into Amycus Carrow and Malfoy before I was even half-way there.”
Malfoy jerked slightly and turned towards him, raising an eyebrow. “Look who’s bothered to actually show up.”
“They’re doing… Something. They’re not on their usual patrols. I saw Alecto with Professor Flitwick earlier. I’m sure whatever they’re up to it’s bad”, Draco said with genuine concern.
“Gather around, class, gather around”, Slughorn ushered as the class spilled into the room, waving them towards the cauldron. As they formed a circle around it, Slughorn continued. “Now, does anyone of you know what this is? Miss Granger?”
“No”, Draco repeated. “I want to be the one to do it.”
birthday came around, Harry had hoped to get some respite from pin-balling between his two friends, thinking that this special occasion might create temporary peace. Instead, the day began with Ron eating the chocolates Harry had been given by Romilda Vane so long ago and ended in the hospital wing with a shaken Hermione and a crying Lavender sprawled across Ron’s hospital bed.
Draco shook his head, and Harry tentatively licked again. Draco let out a soft moan that sent shivers down Harry’s spine. Slowly, he worked his tongue into Draco while one hand set to work on Draco’s cock. The way Draco was gasping was sending Harry over the edge and he couldn’t keep from grinding against the sheets. When he finally pulled his mouth away, his pre-cum soaked finger slipped inside to replace it.
“I just wanted to… Talk to you.”
Draco nodded. “Now I’ll have to sneak back to the common room with him lurking around outside”, Draco muttered. “At least you’ve got that cloak.”
“It wouldn’t be so ludicrous, she’s always all over you.”
”, Draco snarled through gritted teeth, fumbling for his wand. “Get out!”
Harry thought he could see Draco jerk at this, but his facial expression was unreadable.
Harry turned to them. “I won’t be coming back next year”, he said.
Dobby. He didn’t deserve to be enslaved to the likes of you.”
“Okay”, he gasped, kissing Draco hard.
“Harry!” Hermione cried. She was rushing towards them, having broken free from the fight against Crabbe. “We have to get out of here, before everything collapses and we get buried.”
“Hey”, Harry said, bending over to take a look at the splinter in Draco’s leg. “This might hurt”, he warned, grabbed the splinter and pulled it out.
“You’re doing something in here and I know it.”
“Don’t stop, don’t stop”, Draco moaned.
When Harry got down to the common room after having disposed of Dobby’s decorations, he caught sight of Ron disappearing out through the portrait hole, an angry looking Lavender heading back to the dormitories, and an unusually cheerful Hermione coming towards him.
“Draco”, Harry replied and bit his tongue to keep himself from asking Draco to go away.
Her voice was a bit too loud and Harry turned red.
It was an hour or so before Ron entered the Gryffindor common room, holding hands with Lavender. Harry rose from his seat by the fire and stalked over to them, grabbing Ron by the collar and hauling him back out of the portrait hole.
“Beats me”, Harry muttered under his breath.
Then, after straightening his tie and running a hand through his hair, he slipped out into the corridor.
Draco shrugged and winced in pain. “Madam Pomfrey gave me dittany, but she said I’d likely still get a mark. What does another scar matter?”
Harry crept out of his bed well after midnight. He pulled on his invisibility cloak and tiptoed past his snoring roommates, down the stairs and through the portrait hole. He didn’t see anyone on his way to the hospital wing, even Peeves seemed to be quiet. Draco’s bed was the only one occupied. Harry stood beside it for a while, staring down at the sleeping Draco. He was wearing a set of pajamas, but the shirt was unbuttoned and exposed his bandage-wrapped chest. Harry was about to go – he’d only wanted to see that Draco was still breathing with his own two eyes – but as he took a step back, the floorboards creaked, and Draco’s eyes opened slightly.
“What is Harry Potter doing with
Harry was relieved Draco was staring at the floor and not at him. He was taken aback by this, he’d never expected, or much wanted, an apology from Draco. Especially one that sounded as if he really meant it. Not that it could compensate for the various deeds of varying cruelty Draco had partaken in over the years, but Harry thought it did show some of that remorse Draco had been claiming he felt. Perhaps, just perhaps, it wasn’t all lies.
Draco scoffed. “Believe what you want, you and your piss-poor blood traitor and mudbl-”
“I wasted time searching it, but I had another plan. Last year Montague got stuck in that old vanishing cabinet, and he told me he was trapped somewhere between Borgin & Burkes and Hogwarts.”
“No”, Harry admitted. “But it was implied, I mean, what other master could they be talking about?”
nice Valentine’s gift.” He smirked and earned himself a slap to the back of the head from Hermione.
“You think
“Oh, okay, sorry”, Hermione said, acting like she’d drop it, but Harry knew her too well to believe it.
“It’s getting late”, Draco finally said. “Are you ready to go?”
The look Draco gave him was contemptuous. “And what is it to you? Do I have to tell you everything I do?”
He told them of his plan for the following year, how he was going to search for Horcruxes and perhaps go to Godric’s Hollow.
Harry turned to Draco, who was staring down at Dobby’s dubious outfit. “Don’t you have something to say?”
The curse narrowly missed Harry but hit the bust. The diadem went spinning into the air and away out of sight.
Harry supposed that after what had happened at Malfoy Manor, Voldemort didn’t much care to see that any of the Malfoys carried wands.
– they hadn’t talked about doing anything like
Harry, who’d been thinking something along the same lines, flushed. “It’ll be the last time if you don’t watch your mouth.”
Harry grinned back. He’d feared Draco would want to discuss what had happened in potions, but Draco seemed entirely unconcerned about it. Instead, Draco pushed him backwards lightly, so he sat down on one of the green beds. Draco proceeded to settle himself on Harry’s lap, straddling him so they were sitting face to face. Harry shuffled backwards and lay down, holding Draco gently and guiding him down on top of him.
After the funeral, Harry went down to sit by the lake. He’d thought he wanted to be alone, but when Ron and Hermione came to join him, he found he was glad to have their company. They sat together by the shore, staring out across the water. Hermione burst into tears and buried her face in Ron’s shoulder and he slipped an arm around her like it was nothing.
“Anyway”, Draco continued. “I’ve made you this.”
So he hadn’t truly chosen a side yet, Harry thought bitterly. Draco could still be waiting to see who would win this war.
Draco’s cheeks turned pink. “Of course not. I was just checking if I need to keep a look out for any rashes.”
“Draco”, Harry moaned again. “Draco, I’ll-” He gasped and came over Draco’s hands, onto their clothes.
