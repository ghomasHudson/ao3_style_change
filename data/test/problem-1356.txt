“You can call me Dean,” he said, then quickly added, “Didn’t look like nothing to me.  Looked like you two were about to—”
“Harry,” he whined, breaking the kiss in order to let out a few shaking breaths.
Getting Harry Potter alone was a task not taken lightly.  Draco Malfoy had spent the first months of Auror training, mapping out everyone’s schedule for the sheer purpose of avoiding each and every dorm mate.  He knew that the Patil sisters woke up about the same time as him, that they crammed any last-minute assignments and ate breakfast in that short hour before they ran off to class.  Dean and Seamus woke up much later in the day, preferring to take lessons closer to noon.  Harry Potter and Ron Weasley on the other hand had a varied schedule.  Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays were their earlier days.  They’d usually leave the dorms around 8 am.  But on Tuesday and Thursday, Weasley would leave for class around 10 and Potter didn’t have another class till about noon that day.
“Oh,” Harry pouted.  It was really unfair that his lips could take on that shape and Draco’s breath stalled.  “I’m not very tall,” he noted.
When he returned to the dorm, the sisters were gone.  Draco could tell they must have left for class in a hurry because they still have a few spare scroll and quills upon the table and dishes in the sink from breakfast.  Draco did the courteous thing and waved his wand at the mess and cleaned it up as he made his way back to his room.  It was when he was sitting on his bed and pulling off his trainers that he noticed it.
“I’ll be right back, I’ve got a dittany solution.”  Draco stayed hunched over and waiting, hearing Potter shuffle on into his bathroom.  It wasn’t long before he came back and Draco held out his hand expectantly.  But what he felt next started him, because now there was a damp cloth across his cheeks.  Potter was cleaning him up, and Draco had trouble breathing already but now it seemed like he stopped altogether.
“Malfoy,” Ginny finally spoke, her eyes blazing.  Draco gulped, fighting the urge to shrink against the piano.  “I know you were a right arsehole to me and my friends in school.  We’re adults now, and though that doesn’t excuse your behavior—Blaise values your friendship for some bizarre reason.  I’ve also heard some interesting things from some of my own friends.  So, I came here tonight to see if what I was hearing was all true, and well, to appease Blaise.  If you want to keep playing the part of a prat, I’d be pleased to punch the other side of your mouth if you’d like.”
“Crookshanks?”
He heard the murmur of the crowd rise, and spotted them a second later.  His eyes widened in alarm, and before he could really process what he was looking at, Blaise caught his eyes and broke out into a beaming smile.  He pulled Ginny along with him, and Draco tried to school his features.
He laughed, leaning against the door frame.  “Really?  That little vixen!”  Draco rolled his eyes and Dean hummed thoughtfully, trying to come up with something else.  “Well, how is that working out for you then?  You think she’ll manage?”
“Fucking hell,” Draco moaned, his cock throbbing in Harry’s strong grip.  Then Harry bent down again and took him deep, his eyes never leaving Draco’s.  He held Draco for one more agonizing slide, and then released his grip.  Draco shouted, feeling his climax immediately, and watched as Harry greedily swallowed it all.  The image of Harry’s eyes smoldering as Draco came will be forever burned in Draco’s mind.
“Well yeah, that’s Weasley for you.  What was
is he, exactly?” Pansy asked Dean and Seamus, completely ignoring Draco.  All he could do was glare at his friend—and secretly contemplate going back to his room to get his wand.
“I don’t have to tell you any such thing!” He argued, covering his face in his hands.
“Oh...no...I’m fine.  More than fine, really...” Malfoy trailed off, a small smile forming on his lips, looking over at Harry.  The look he gave him made Harry’s stomach drop.  Never in a million years would Harry expect to see Malfoy look at him like
'I don't want to be gay. I can't be gay.'  Then he thought about what his father would say. He'd yell, maybe slap him. Probably Crucio the gay out of him. Draco shuddered as he wiped away the tear in haste and decided to go back and finish the letter.
"Draco, are you alright?" She asked whilst popping a treacle tart into her mouth. I grew annoyed. "Pansy, I'm fine. Jeezus, bugger off," I murmured. She and Goyle looked baffled at my absurd language. I immediately felt tremendous guilt as Pansy's eyes started to glaze over and she excused herself to the bathroom. Crabbe looked judgingly at me. "I'll apologize later. Sorry guys." I frowned while turning my thoughts back to Harry.
"He's vile and cruel
"No, I'm good," I teased and slowly unfolded the piece of parchment.
"What happened?!" He shouted, small tears in his eyes.
"Draco, I've always loved you. But if this is what makes you happy, then I'm here for you."
I swallowed back the lump that was forming in my throat and I looked away. Around the room, near the Ravenclaws table, the doors, anywhere that wasn't Pansy. I could sense her stare on me and I just took another bite of my apple.
I didn't realize I was not saying anything until Draco rolled his eyes and sighed, "Are you going to keep looking at me and not saying anything or can we go to bed?" I shook myself from the trance and I felt a smile form on my face.
Draco gripped his wand and pointed it in a lazy warning towards the other boy.
"Technically it's a ferret."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco?" A sickeningly sweet voice lured me out of my sleep and I growled.
"You-you're not angry?" I asked looking around, people were starting to go back to their usual things. She shook her head, smiling.
"Thanks, Pans," I mumbled. And licked my bottom lip as more of the apple ran down my face. Someone else was looking at me and I looked up to see who. I narrowed my eyes until I spotted Potter looking at me. I softened my glare but furrowed my eyebrows in confusion as I saw his dilated pupils looking at my lips and his face flushed a little. His shoulders were also barely heaving up and down. Still noticable that he was out of breath or something.
"This is Crabbe, Goyle. And I'm Malfoy," I took a step closer to him on a higher step. "Draco, Malfoy." I smiled widely at him. Feeling excited that I was finally talking to the boy I've looked up to since I was young.
Pansy just rapped her little knuckles against the door again while sighing really loudly. Finally having enough of her annoying tricks, I rolled out of bed and walked to the door. I threw open the door and just growled, "what."
I extended my hand, "I can help you there." I smiled, getting ready to become friends with the amazing Harry Potter. I could feel excitement bubbling up and then-
'I have Potter...he's my friend now.' Then a faint smile, not a smirk, formed on my face and I suddenly felt a little better. I quickly used a glamour spell and hmphed in acceptance.
"So..." he cleared his throat making me look up at him. He glanced at me in the corner of his eye and when he saw me looking up at him expectantly, his eyes darkened and he quickly looked back forward.
"And here I was about to ask you to the Yule Ball," she sobbed into her hands. I sat uncomfortably next to her, and I awkwardly patted her back, not liking the amount of kindness I was showing her in public. A lot of internal conflict boiling into my skin. If I tell her, will she hate me? If I tell her, will she still be my friend? Maybe she'll stop causing a scene...
"Draco...what was that? What's wrong?" she whispered and put her hand on my thigh.
I hope you liked this chapter. Please comment and share. And don't forget to hit that little star on the way out!
I found Goyle and Crabbe stuffing their faces as soon as I walked in and I glanced around the room. There were a few Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw guys asking the Beauxbatons girls to the Yule Ball and one guy got rejected so hard he rushed past me red in the face, looking sick. I smirked in amusement. But then I spotted Harry. He was sitting with Ron laughing when Hermione said something that made Ron smirk smugly. Hermione grew a little red and then said something that made Ron and Harry look shocked. Then she left. Ron looked at Harry and gave a weak smile making Harry shrug in confusion. As she was passing by me, her eyes looked into mine and I held my breath hoping she wouldn't see the glamour. "Malfoy..." she muttered. I didn't say anything back which made her halt her stride for a second and then she continued walking. I spotted Pansy talking to Blaise and my heart stopped. I started to feel sick again. Groaning inwardly I stood up straight and walked over to Goyle and Crabbe, not looking anyone in the eye. Although I could sense that someone's eyes were on me and I just prayed it wasn't Blaise's.
-------------------------
As soon as I rounded the corner by the Room Of Requirements, I knocked into a very sturdy person. I fell back with an oof and heard someone gasp. I looked up from the ground and saw a very nervous Malfoy.
"Looking for this?" I smirked. His grey eyes flicked to mine and panic spread all over his face. He tried masking his panic with anger.
Mother of Merlin, Harry couldn’t think.  He shuffled carefully over to him, his mind blank.  Never in his wildest fantasies had he ever imagined anything like this.  Fuck, Malfoy was a vision.  Harry couldn’t possibly stop ogling him.  This would be wank material for years, and he didn’t even
for anything concerning Draco.  The mere concept of it all was making his heart race and his head fill with questions to the point it was making him dizzy.
“So, you’ll never guess who our dates were the other night,” Pansy laughed, pulling Draco away from a large snow puddle.
Seamus squealed excitedly, “Oh you so should, Draco!”
Draco answered with a small smile.  Then he leaned in and carefully left a chaste kiss.  Harry’s whole face flushed at the touch.  “Let‘s go home, Harry.”  Grinning, Harry pulled Draco into his arms in a firm embrace.  Then they both felt the pull of apparition take them away.
His run was therapeutic and allowed him the needed time to think about all that was happening within his dorm.  He’d somehow stumbled into an unlikely friendship with Dean and Seamus—and now the twins were even being agreeable.  He had no idea how the dynamic of the dorm could change so much in such a short time.  It was unexpected, and Draco pondered if it was something in the water.  Why else would everyone suddenly be so
Pansy smirked, looking back and forth between them.  Blaise sputtered, which caused both Ginny and Draco to look at him suddenly.  “Oh, for Merlin’s sakes,” Pansy cut in.  “It was 5th year and they just shared a couple of blowies in the Prefects bathroom.  Everyone in Slytherin knew about it.”
“Please go kiss your boyfriend, he’s driving me absolutely mad!”
wanted), he wanted to make sure there was no confusion as to his intentions.
Pansy let out a small laugh and before she could get a word in about that, Draco interrupted.  “Now, hold up.  So, he’s obsessed with me.  That doesn’t mean he wants to—um, take it any further.  There’s no way Harry Potter is even remotely, er, queer.  I’d seen all those photos of you two in the Prophet.  Nothing even suggesting anything else...”
Harry reached across the table for his hand.  His hand was warm and slightly sweaty, and Draco admired his golden skin against Draco’s very pale complexion.  “Draco, if it was a one-time thing, I wouldn’t have kissed you in front of our friends.  I had to take some time, to think about what all this means.  I’ve been gone because I had to confide in Hermione in all of this.  We’re trying to work together on how best to reveal it all to Ron.”
Rose watched them walk past her and continue on towards the banquet hall.  They certainly made quite a striking pair, and most of their guests turned to get a good look at the couple.  A murmur started to rise up throughout the crowd as they passed, Blaise basking in the extra attention; Ginny not phased at all.  Perhaps, being involved with Potter and playing for an international team allowed her to cope with the attention.  She carried herself well, confident in her strides along with Blaise.
“And you’re oblivious, and frankly just a little pathetic.  The war’s over, honey.  It is possible for people to forgive and move on.  Seems to me Harry Potter is all for that idea.”  She took a larger pull of her drink, while Draco simply waved his own around in his glass.
Harry smiled at him with that same smile that had been driving Draco mad for weeks, and then they made their way inside.  A hostess greeted them promptly and seated them at a table near the back of the restaurant.  Draco was secretly pleased to see the establishment had decorated for the holidays.  Hanging on the wall next to their table were two golden bells, with holy and a red satin bow crowning the piece.  Normally Draco would have found the decoration slightly garish, but with the subdued candle lighting it caused the glitter to sparkle.  It was oddly charming.
“No,” Pansy frowned.  “Draco, is something wrong?”
“Well, you don’t need to do that anymore.  My sister and I wanted to let you know, we won’t think anything of it if you’re out here.  If you’re willing to put the past behind you and change this much to become an Auror, I’m willing to take my own judgements of you and put them in the past.”  She gave him a small smile, which caused Draco’s eyes to widen in alarm.  “Besides, you’re not too terrible looking.  It’d be nice to see you more often than a glimpse now and then in the mornings before class...”
“All mine?” Harry asked, his voice low.
His fingers joined Harry’s tongue causing Draco to quiver uncontrollably.  He opened him up slowly, pressing against his tight ring of muscles.  It wasn’t till he was fully relaxed and Harry’s finger slipped inside with ease that he added another.  Draco let out a small grunt, his chest rising and falling in an erratic pattern.  “You all right....love?”  Harry whispered, withdrawing his face to look at him spread beautifully along the bed.  He began kissing Draco’s inner thigh once more as he spread his fingers hesitantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
The kettle whistled just as Potter had hauled the tree up into the corner of the room and was wiping his brow.  Draco jumped, but quickly regained his nerves and started to fill his cup.  Tea, yes, that’s what he was doing.  Getting his tea and getting the hell out of here—leave Potter to his weird Christmas rituals.
“Merlin,” Pansy sighed.  “As sweet as that all is, you’re starting to sound like a Hufflepuff.  I think it’s safe to say I have no desire to jump you anymore.”
“Get over here,” growled Malfoy.  “I’ve been waiting for hours and if you don’t touch me soon I’m going to shoot all over this 18
“It’s Malfoy to you, Potter,” Draco shot back, watching as Harry pulled out a water bottle and one of those Muggle music players.
“Are you sure?  I could help get you to bed...” His arm was dangerously closing in on Draco again.
Draco hid his face behind his hands.  His face as red as the stupid garland decorating the bar.  Eventually he mumbled, “Pansy, I hate you.”
At last, Harry’d closed in on Malfoy.  He pressed himself against Malfoy’s back, his hard cock digging into his shoulder blades.  Malfoy hissed underneath him, bending his back impossibly to get even more friction, and fuck Harry could probably come just like this, covering him all over with his release.  Harry had to close his eyes, this was almost too much and too soon.  He groaned, holding his erection firmly in his hand to calm himself down.  He didn’t want to end this when it’d barely even started.  How dare Malfoy feel as good as he looked.  The prat would never live it down if Harry came immediately from rubbing on his back just a little bit.
With the night sky blinking up above, Draco would run once more.  This time, however, he’d slow down halfway through his lap.  He’d walk the rest of his journey, his eyes scanning the constellations up above.  His mind always on Potter, wondering what the man was doing now.  Was he going to return to Hogwarts?  Was he going to marry girl Weasley?  Was he going to live happily ever after—while Draco just kept on existing?  Perhaps.  This was Harry Potter’s story, after all.  Draco Malfoy played no major role in it, even if his wand is what killed the bastard in the end.
“Yeeeessss,” hissed Malfoy, his face now slipping down the couch cushions.  Harry didn’t care, let the git suffocate for all his trouble.  He pulled Draco further into himself, bending him at an obscene angle, his bonds pulling taut and no doubt digging into his wrists.  Harry pounded into him at a brutal pace, fucking him so hard that the furniture started to slide across the hardwood floor.  “So...so close,” came Malfoy’s mumbled plea.
Harry blinked, looking from the man and then back to Draco.  “Is that...Eddie from Improper Use?”
He heard her sigh, then felt her hand on his jaw pull him up to look her in the eyes.  “Not yet, you are,” she frowned.  “But I have faith it’ll happen soon enough.”  Leaning over she kissed his cheek.  “Wednesday for lunch?” she asked, stepping away from him and into her home.
, he thought helplessly.  It wouldn’t do to make a scene here.
Pansy snorted.  “Let’s see, Longbottom got fit.  Blaise finally has the Quidditch star he’d been chasing for weeks.  And you’ve finally told our Lord and Savior Potter how you feel about him...”
Draco had doubled over, clutching his mouth which had busted open.  Blood was seeping onto his hands, and the coppery taste overwhelmed his senses.  It filled his nose, making it almost impossible to breathe.  He could feel it dripping down his chin, and without thinking he wiped the blood with his sleeve.  There was a lot of blood...but possibly it just looked worse than it actually was.
They both took their shot, tilting their heads back at the same time and then slamming the glass back onto the bar.  Pansy let the alcohol wash over them before she said, “Yes, same one actually.  He’s working on his Herbology mastery.  Apparently, he’s really good with his hands...”
His Auror robe slipped from his shoulders, making a loud thunk upon the floor.  Malfoy cocked his head to the side to look at the source of the noise by instinct, but Harry was pleased to see his eyes were blindfolded with the same black silk material he’d used to tie himself up.  “Take it all off,” he demanded, his face still turned towards Harry.  He sucked his lips inside, biting on them as if he was holding back saying something else.  Harry very much wanted to pull those lips out himself, suck them into his own mouth.  Perhaps even stuff his mouth full of something else, make the annoying prat silent for once.
Perhaps someday he’d find someone that’d look at him the same way those two looked at each other.
“And he lives here with you?” Draco asked, somewhat confused.  Why would Granger’s cat be here and not with her?
Draco snorted, shaking his head.  “Try again, I’ve already got Ginny Weasley on that case...”
“Bloody fucking hell, c’mon love,” Dean grumbled, pulling Seamus to his feet.  They gathered the rest of their things and sent them floating back into their room.  They vanished shortly after.
“Oh,” Draco blinked.  “Here?”
Draco’s breath caught, then he was choking and coughing, and pounding his chest.  Merlin, Pansy wasn’t kidding.  This was a disaster!  To make matters worse, Potter wasn’t laughing at him and seriously thought something was wrong! His emerald eyes widened in alarm and he leaned over, wrapping an arm around Draco and patting him on the back as if to help him!
But that wasn’t what drew Harry’s most attention.
“Why are you telling me all this?”  Draco asked, his head starting to feel lightheaded.  Perhaps the champagne was catching up with him after all.
“I am happy,” he lied, looking down at his Auror issued boots.  The dragonhide leather was still impeccable, haven’t even broken into.  Boots he rarely even had to use just yet.
Eddie bristled, “It’s Edward to you, Potter!  What the fuck are you doing with my boyfriend?”  He growled, brandishing his wand at him.  “I should kill you, you arsehole!  Draco are you all right?  Looks like he practically mauled you!”
“Wow, what’s all this?” Ron asked, walking over to the cabinets.  He pulled out a plastic cup with a lid and proceeded to fill it to the brim with coffee.
He stared sadly out his bedroom window, admiring the ice crystals accumulating upon the glass.  A few moments later, he pulled his wand out and pointed it at the icicles.  Swishing his wand in a swirling pattern, he watched in fascination as the ice formed intricate shapes.  If he squinted just the right way, he could make out a spider, or maybe a hummingbird.  It reminded him of his childhood, looking at the abstract shapes of the clouds within the sky.
and disappeared a second later.
It was merely a second before Harry was closing in on Draco once more, but he wrapped his arm firmly around Draco’s waist and pulled.  Draco’s breath left him in a rush as he stared down at him.  “Are you scared?” Harry asked, his eyes searching Draco’s.
But before he could ponder on what to do, his wand chimed to signal it was time.  Draco took a large breath to calm his nerves.  Fuck it, it was too late now.  If this all blew up in his face, at least he had Pansy to blame for it all.  He swallowed, his throat suddenly drying up at an alarming rate.  With his heart pounding, he walked the small distance out of his room and knocked quietly on Harry’s door.  “Just a minute,” he heard him call in response.  Draco’s heart lurched, just hearing his voice.  Merlin, they were really doing this, weren’t they?
He grumbled, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.  “What?”
Draco really had only one hope of getting Potter alone and that was to wait till next Tuesday to get him alone.  Sure, Dean and Seamus would still be locked up in their dorm and hadn’t left for class yet.  But maybe if Draco could give them a warning beforehand, they wouldn’t walk in and interrupt them.  Draco had to take this chance.
“Pfft,” Harry dismissed that idea quickly.  “Now you just know how it feels anytime someone walks in on you guys.  We’ll behave, won’t we, Draco?”
When Draco ran, he let his mind wander.  He thought of his parents, his friends, Dumbledore, Severus, the Dark Lord—and yes, of course Harry Potter.  At Hogwarts, it was more of a question of
Ginny tilted her head inquisitively.  “Just what exactly did she give you?  I don’t think she’s given us anything yet this holiday season...”
“Ew, Draco, don’t be crude.”  Draco immediately felt relief at that.  Let her date anyone else, but not that fucking prick.
He made a distressed sound at the back of his throat, then bowed his head to the table, wrapping his arms around himself.  “It’s just...I really fucking like him—at least I think so.  And I’m afraid I’m going to screw this all up.  Ok?”  Draco took a shaking breath.  “It doesn’t help that I haven’t got a clue on what to do next.”
Dean laughed, shaking his head.  “Oh, don’t worry about them.  They reacted much in the same way when they caught us snogging the first time.  They’ll get over it.”
Harry grinned, kissing the corner of Draco’s lips.  “Ok,” he giggled, grabbing Draco’s hand.  They skipped out of the living room, practically giddy with what just happened and what was about to happen in Draco’s bedroom.
“He’s bi,” she said simply, as if she was commenting on snow being cold and rain wet.  “Apparently I tend to date in some sort of trend.  Dean Thomas, raging bisexual.  Harry Potter, the closeted bisexual.  Then this sphinx over here that’s had half of London.”
Draco wasn’t stupid, he nodded simply.  “Yes, professor.  I apologize,” he responded.  He gave himself the polite amount of time to linger there, then turned tail and ran.  He walked briskly past the other classrooms, thankful it was so early.  He really didn’t want another confrontation with anyone else while he was in this state.  He hadn’t even got to finish his morning run either, he thought bitterly.
“No,” he responded carefully.  “This just isn’t like us, wouldn’t you agree?  You’re supposed to fight me every step of the way, think I’m always up to something.  Yell at me or punch me, I don’t know.  We can duel for old times sake.”
Draco could feel Potter’s gentle touch at the small of his back, guiding him back into the dorms.  Ron sputtered as they walked on past.  “Oh so it‘s going to be like that, is it?”  He shouted after them, “You’re going to take
doing?”
“I’ll give you something,” Draco whispered, lifting his head off the mat and chasing Harry’s lips.  They connected once more in a burning kiss.
She waved her hand, trying to abate the situation.  “Oh, do calm down.  We all know, we’ve known since second year.  It’s kind of an unspoken truth throughout Gryffindor and Slytherin.  Watch Harry Potter obsess over Malfoy.  Watch Malfoy act oblivious to the whole thing, while secretly he loves all the attention! Harry Potter has had a fixation on you, always has to come in and save the day.  Saving you from fiendfyre, saving you from Azkaban.  Then there’s you, and Draco you think you’re discrete but it’s so fucking obvious.”
Just when he was about done waiting, Potter mumbled out, “Er...well I thought we could be friends.”
Draco settled further into the pillows, and nearly did Harry in when he bent his legs up, spreading them wide.  “Fuck,” Harry practically whimpered, his focus zeroing in on Draco’s furled skin.
He considered his next response carefully.  Draco never really had to think much about
He quickly stopped Potter from getting any closer by taking a step back, his hand holding Potter’s arm in place.  “Potter, I’m fine.  Really.”  He knew he was blushing now, and there was no helping it.
at you?”
“Yes,” Draco agreed, looking away from the couple in question and trying to find the nearest waiter.
Harry had never seen anything more beautiful if he were honest.
“You’re insatiable.”
Draco stopped her with a tug to her arm.  They stood underneath the decorated trees of the park.  Each tree was sporting a different color of lights, and at any other time Draco would have marveled at how beautiful it all was.  Instead his mind was elsewhere, “Weasley?  You went out on a date with Ronald Weasley?!”
.  Potter also informed him that the music player was called a stereo and that not only could it play cds, but it could also play tapes and the radio (which was some sort of Muggle wireless network).  Draco was enthralled with the concept of it all, doing all of this without magic.  It was mad, really.
“Hey,” he called, his arms lifted as he was draping the garland around the top section of the tree.  Draco looked over, and Merlin help him, Potter’s sweater had ridden up revealing a stripe of golden skin.  “Mind making me a cup?” he asked, completely oblivious to the crisis Draco was now in.
Later that night he was laying on his bed, twirling the disc around once more.  He was listening carefully as the last of his dormmates headed to bed.  When the coast was clear, he tiptoed into the living room and went over to the music player.  He examined the contraption for several minutes, pushing buttons and twisting knobs and nothing was even happening.  He was just about to give up on the whole thing when someone asked behind him, “Need help with that?”
“Ron,” Harry growled in a warning.
Draco laughed, shaking his head.  But he failed to comment on that—his mind still so very lost.  Thankfully Dean was there to clear things up.  “Pansy’s just a friend.  And Harry’s an incredibly private person.  I wouldn’t be surprised if he’d been with a guy before.  Not that it matters much anyway.  The heart wants what the heart wants,” he smiled warmly at Seamus.  Seamus blew him a kiss.
“Harry, please,” Draco pleaded, his eyes clenching shut.  He could feel a hot rushing feeling forming at the base of his spine, and he knew he was too close.  He needed Harry inside him, and soon.
She made a face, and Draco laughed along with her.  “Nope, try a different house.”
Potter shrugged on past him without another word, his fingers now gripping the back of Draco’s sweatshirt and pulling them inside the building.  They made their way quickly up to their floor and once there Draco tried to head back to his room.  Potter wouldn’t have that though, and tugged him along to his own room, kicking open the door with his foot.  Draco could barely see with the blood covering his face, but he felt Potter’s hands shift to his shoulders and pushed him down to sit on a soft surface.  A bed.  Potter’s bed.  Oh Merlin, he hoped it was Potter’s bed.
“Jeans?”  He asked, distressed.  “I’m going on a date with Harry Potter and I’m going to be wearing
After Draco watched Potter give his statement in court on his behalf, Draco ran even more.  In the mornings, he’d run past the few remaining peacocks.  They’d startle as he jogged on past, and any other time of his life perhaps he would have been amused at that.  But his mind strayed to Potter and just
Potter grabbed at a bottle, uncorking it and dabbed his fingers inside.  His eyes never left Draco’s face, and soon his fingers returned.  He started the same path he had before, focusing on Draco’s nose.  A cooling tingling sensation enveloped him, the pain easing away.  Minutes passed and he was gradually able to start breathing out of his nose, the scent of blood gone.
Smiling, Harry brought his own hand to stroke through Draco’s hair.  There wasn’t any tinsel in his strands of platinum though.  Draco was already rather flushed and lightheaded from the drinks at the party, but Harry’s touch caused his cheeks to warm even more.  “Don’t know if you’ve noticed,” he whispered, leaning closer.  His lips brushed over Draco’s, “but I’m just as crazy for you.”
Harry laughed, kissing him once more.  “Stop being such a Grinch.”
Then he started to wave his wand, a curse on his lips.  Harry saw out of the corner of his eye Malfoy root around under the couch pillows and pulled out his own wand.
“Dear, we’ve been in here for ages.  Let’s go.”
“Yes, Harry’s sweet!”  He agreed with his weak tongue, then silently cursed himself when the words registered to his brain.  “Now if you’ll excuse me, bed.  I need to get to bed.  Not Harry’s bed—my bed.”
made Draco sick to his stomach more often than not.  He managed to find one wing of the manor untouched from Voldemort’s filth—his old nursery.  He’d transfigured his old crib into a suitable bed, and wore his school wardrobe more than anything.  He didn’t even want to step foot in his old bedroom, he was afraid of what shadows lurked there.
“Well, we could try,” Potter suggested as he now stared at his own trainers.  His blush now reached the tips of his ears and at any other time Draco would have found it endearing.  “I got Ron to back down, the twins seem to like you more now since our game in the snow.  Even Dean and Seamus think you’re not so bad now...”
“Wow,” Seamus said once the coast was clear.  Draco let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding.  Dean sat back in his seat, pulling his coffee to his lips.  “Love...” Seamus started, and Dean looked up and held his gaze.  “Love, that was the hottest fucking thing I’ve ever seen...”
Potter, on the other hand, looked like he just rolled out of bed.  His red and black buffalo plaid pajama bottoms hung low on his waist, the v-shaped line along his hips distracting.  Draco was supposed to have come up with a response by now, but he failed.
“You’re such a bore, dear.”  Pansy lifted her martini glass to her lips and took another sip.  They were both on their third glass of the evening.  “Why are you even trying so hard?  You always look gorgeous.  Come out and let’s go play.  Our Gryffindors should be showing up any minute now...”
“Not going to happen,” he shuddered.  Harry had reached his belt and was unbuckling it.  His breath left him in a rush when Harry reached inside his pants to stroke him.  “Harry,” Draco whined, already feeling himself reacting much too quickly.
He shrugged.  He knew
He chuckled, slipping out of Malfoy and sitting lazily on the couch next to him.  “Well, who’d you think it was?”  He laughed, stretching his legs languidly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Blaise,” she whined.  “Could you hurry this up already?”
Smiling, Draco replied, “Oh just some hole in the wall place in the Muggle part of town.  I can’t even remember the name of the place, but they’ve got good drinks and chips.”
“Right,” he smirked.  They made their way outside and stood underneath the awning, where he leaned in and kissed her cheek.  “Take care of yourself.”
He didn’t want to think about it.  He knew somewhere out there was Harry Potter.  No word from Voldemort meant Harry Potter was safe, that he was working to stop this.  Draco hated Potter, but he hated Voldemort more.  Potter had to win, he
When he finally came through the other end, he had stumbled and stubbed his toe on the side wall.  He hissed in agony, hopping on one foot.  Malfoy better have a good fucking reason—
Harry frowned, his eyes on his own menu.  “Please don’t think you have to do that anymore.  So much has changed.”
“Yes,” Draco agreed.  “It was rather unexpected though.  Did you...”  He paused, considering how best to ask what he wanted next.  “Did you mean what you wrote?  About going there together someday?”
“It’s ok,” she smiled softly.  He led her to his disaster of a wardrobe silently.  This was the main reason for her visit, after all.  Draco had great taste, but Pansy’s was even better.  Draco knew high wizard fashion—Pansy knew
“Thanks!” Potter grinned automatically, but then realized shortly after just who he was talking to and quickly turned around to tend to the tree.  Draco was relieved his back was turned, because he had no idea how to react to
She scoffed, clearly not caring at the attention she was drawing to their table.  “He liked the tea you made him—even wished you a Merry Christmas, and you ran away like a frightened school girl.  Merlin, you’re hopeless.”  She then waved her hand and signaled to a waiter.  He paused at their table and before he could even get in a word in, she smiled politely up at him and asked, “Does this establishment offer anything a little stronger we could put in this coffee?  My friend is a lost cause—think we need to get out the hard stuff...”
Seamus dropped his tea cup, making a loud clattering sound.  “Wait, Draco are you a...?”
Not missing a beat, Seamus shouted back, “We’re not into threesomes, but I’m sure Harry would love to FUCK YOU!”
“Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Parkinson.  I’m Ginevra Weasley and the youngest and only daughter of Molly and Arthur Weasley,” she smiled warmly.  “I must admit, attending this party is very unlike anything I’ve done before.  However, Blaise seems to get me to think and do things I wouldn’t normally consider.  Thank you for the invitation.  It’s a beautiful party.”
Never mind the fact that when Draco finally got to sleep, he dreamed of Potter sparkling with all those Christmas lights.  If he had nothing else on but the Christmas lights, that was a tiny detail Draco was seriously trying not to dwell on too much.
This time Draco laughed.  “No, Merlin,” he shook his head, trying to dispel his laughter.  Their wine arrived at that moment and Draco happily took a sip from his glass.  He was pleasantly surprised by how it tasted and continued, “No, no.  It was with Theodore.”
“Oh, ok.”  Draco licked his lips nervously.  “I’ll, um, owl you a time and place.  That sound good?”
He grumbled irritably as he swiped Malfoy’s folder and started to make his way through the abandoned Auror department.  A quick glance at the clock let him know it was now Saturday, which made Harry even angrier.  He’d wasted too much time in their office, going over notes on a case Malfoy couldn’t bother to give a witch’s tit over.  If Harry’s job wasn’t on the line, he’d not care too.  He had made it to the end of the hall and grabbed some Floo powder, practically knocking the basin over in his own frustration.   Throwing with more force than was probably necessary, he watched the flames turn green.
He draped his burgundy uniform over his shoulders and grabbed his files off his deck and put them under his arm.  He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and looked across Malfoy’s desk.  There, laying wide open was Malfoy’s identical file spread out with all the gruesome photos and details for anyone that wanted to snoop on by.  “For fuck’s sake,” grumbled Harry as he waved a wand at his partner’s papers.  They instantly flew around and arranged in proper order, sliding neatly into a folder.  Harry looked at the file, pondering.
'What the hell?' I thought. After a few moments of silence, he spoke up again, "The Yule Ball is coming up. I was really expecting Hemione to want me to go with her." I noticed him roll his eyes at the thought. "Although, I really don't like her like that."
~A task later~
Dear Potter,
Draco took a deep breath and let out a shaky breath. Pansy was watching him intently with confusion in her eyes. Draco continued to finish up the letter.
And I heard Crabbe's cries of panic and fear. Then I was sliding down his pant leg. Disgusting, I thought. Finally, I made my way out and onto the floor. I was spun around and I felt sick again. I shook in fear and then I opened my eyes. I was on the ground as myself. I felt humiliated as everyone laughed and pointed at me. I quickly got up and let out a yelp. My eyes stung with hurt and anger. Especially when I glanced at Potter and he was practically dying with laughter. Why does this hurt so much?
I shook with anger. Seething, I growled, "What happened?! Y-You attacked me, you bloody git!" I pointed my wand at him and his jaw dropped but then he winced and quickly closed it. Shock was filling my every bone and I could barely feel the bruise forming around my wrists.
"Snap out of it, Malfoy!" Harry huffed, his face getting red. Draco blurted something out, "I want to be your friend." Harry blinked and Draco's cheeks heated up in embarrassment. "What?" Harry dumbly asked, not fulling comprehending the words that just flew out of the other boy's mouth.
Harry's POV
"Remember what we talked about, Draco. The boy will be here this year. Befriend him. Do you understand," he asked slowly and quietly.
"Why were you looking at Malfoy so much?" Ron asked, his eyes narrowed in suspicion.
I flinched and quickly shoved her off.
I extended my hand, "I can help you there
Some sexual tension and revealed interests.
I slowly lowered my hand, feeling my face and neck burning with humiliation from being rejected
"I was serious. I hate fighting," he sighed, looking extremely uncomfortable and vulnerable. "Whatever, it was a stupid idea," he sneered and turned away after I didn't say anything for a while. I wanted to call out and have him turn around. I wanted to accept his request because, damn, this rivalry kept me up at night. Sometimes at night, my mind replayed when he'd smile when talking to Blaise and Pansy. Or my mind would remind me of his soft-looking hair. And I would panic. Because....
Draco had to think and quick. Without processing what he was doing, he pulled out his wand and pointed it at the paper. "INCENDIO!" he shouted frantically. With that, the paper exploded into a ball of fire and burnt the paper out of Harry's hand. Harry eyes widened and he pulled his hands back. "What the hell was that, Malfoy?" he shouted, feeling his heart pounding for two reasons. One, Harry's biggest nemesis had a piece of parchment with HIS name on it. Second, the parchment burst into flames and almost burned the Golden boy himself.
"What did I ever do to you, Draco? Why don't you like me back?" She shrieked while her eyes watered. A few heads turned toward us. My eyes widened and I grabbed her hand. "Pansy, please. You're causing a scene." She jerked her hand away and buried her head in her hands.
Dear Potter,
"He thinks you won't last five," I laughed and looked at my friends and they chuckled too.
Crabbe scoffed, "It's amazing, you're mental. Episode 4 was the best film! How can you prefer Episode 5?!"
Either way, my stomach would flutter oddly at the thought of him late at night and I would refuse to go to sleep. My eyes would be colored black from the lack of sleep, so I started taking Madam Pomfrey's homemade sleep remedy. But I'd get weird dreams that would make me think of a certain blond boy disappearing every time I'd look at him, a serpent impaling me through my stomach, and my parents dying in ways I could never imagine. I quickly stopped taking the sleep remedy. Hence why I was up, walking around the castle.
"Do you still hate Potter?"
Draco blinked. Ever since the second task, seeing Potter selflessly save two people even though he could die, made Draco think differently of the Golden Boy. Since then, Draco's spotted him in a crowd of thousands, his heart has sped up just by the mere thought of him, and he's noticed just how damn attractive the smaller boy is. Of course, Draco recognized these thoughts as very gay ones. Draco has been sure he wasn't attracted to girls ever since Pansy had a full-on make-out session with him third year and Draco wanted to puke afterwards. But he sure as hell wasn't going to admit being gay.
"It's not a good film! It's absolute rubbish!" Goyle growled, raising his fork.
My eyes widened, "O-oh. I thought you guys..." I trailed off at his off-putting smile.
I shoved him hard and heard him let out a low grunt, he looked so angry that the hair on the back of my neck stood up. "He's vile and cruel." I spat out, hurt and angry. It feels like everyone just wants me to lose. I felt a little bit of blood boil under my cheeks as his eyes looked me up and down. "And you're pathetic," I grumbled quietly, instantly regretting it.
He started in alarm, wondering how on earth he missed all this?  Harry’s room looked like a department store’s Christmas display.  There was a giant tree pressed into the corner, with trinkets and lights and ornaments completely covering every surface.  Various stockings hung all over the walls, wreaths of red, green, and gold twinkled merrily.  There was a toy train on a track, chugging along above their heads.  “Potter,” he jostled Harry by the shoulder.
Chuckling, Harry leaned in and kissed at the sensitive spot behind his ear.  Trust Potter to zero in right at his weakness and go for the kill.  Draco was a shuddering mess under him when Harry finally replied, “I’d do it right here or anywhere else you want.  I don’t care.  I just very much want to suck your cock.  Right now.”
Pansy smirked over her own tea, taking a small sip and placing the cup on its saucer delicately.  “Have you shagged him?”  She repeated, her grin turning feral.
“What?” He asked, dumbfounded.  “How in Merlin’s beard do you see that?  He wrote that he sends cards to all his friends.”
Sliding his fingers out, Harry nodded, his mouth and throat suddenly dry and the words unable to form.  He hissed, rubbing the lube along himself, not really realizing his own arousal and how close he was himself.  He was so lost, just on Draco alone.  Lining himself up, his eyes locked with Draco’s.  The look they shared just about did him in, and Harry couldn’t help his name falling from his lips as he finally, finally, pushed inside.
The wet rag inched slowly to his nose and mouth, where the pain was most intense.  Draco winced as Potter made contact with his nose.  “Sssh,” soothed the other man.  “I have to clean you up first, before I can apply the potion.  There’s so much blood...”  Draco simply tilted his head, giving a small nod and leaning closer to allow Potter better access.
“Um, thanks,” he responded, nervously.  Parvati chose that moment to waltz out of their room and join them in the common area.
Draco couldn’t believe his luck.  All he wanted to do was finish his morning jog, perhaps grab a cup of coffee on his way back to get a shower.  But the frantic patronus of his stealth and tracking professor put that plan on hold.  “Shit,” he swore, running out of the park—the slick of snow licking up his trainers.  How could he have forgotten?  It was Monday, he had an exam on Monday!
Before he could ask, she answered, “I haven’t eaten dinner yet.  Have a meal with me.  I promise it won’t mean anything except dinner.  I’m starving.”
, Draco began to panic.  His thoughts tumbling around and perhaps he read this situation completely wrong.  Perhaps he’d just pissed him off, maybe he’d punch him in the face next for even thinking such a thing.  But before Draco’s mind could go completely off the deep end, Harry’s voice broke through.  “Yeah,” he gulped, biting his lips as if he was keeping his smile down for once.  “I’d like that.”
“What are we doing?” Draco asked, breathless.  Harry was transfixed by how his chest moved with his erratic breathing.
“I um...”  He glanced around to make sure none of the others were near or could overhear them.  Weasley and Potter hadn’t even returned to the dorm for the evening, but Draco was still somewhat cautious.  “I was thinking of asking Potter out tomorrow morning.  While Weasley is in class...”
Joining Draco on the bed at last, Harry wrapped his body around him.  And Draco was lost, so very lost in the feel of Harry everywhere.
“Not Blaise, I meant Potter.”
Just then the door burst open and Weasley and Potter walked in and immediately the room was silent.  Draco hastily turned his mug around.  “Oi, what‘s all this?” Weasley asked, taking in the scene of the three of them drinking coffee around the kitchen table, surrounded by homework.  Draco instantly tensed, getting ready to bolt at a moment's notice.
Before Draco could even open his mouth to argue, Dean grinned, “Do you like it?  We saw it the other day in Diagon.  Call it an early Christmas present if you want.”  Then they both continued to giggle.
Just then, he wondered what the rest of London looked like with this snowfall.  He apparated to a park he liked to frequent in the heart of Pansy’s muggle neighborhood.  It was just as beautiful, each building sporting a nice covering of snow.  Fence posts, Muggle telephone booths, mailboxes, park benches—nothing had escaped last night’s snow.  He grinned, taking it all in.
“Yeah,” Draco responded, slightly breathless.  He had no idea what they were supposed to do right now.  But he certainly liked where they were headed.  Harry looked really good with that color to his neck and cheeks.
at him or said
Potter licked his lips, and Draco just about lost it.  This was not happening.  This couldn’t be happening.  Potter surely wasn’t about to--
Once it was all over, Draco still kept running.  He served his house arrest, running more often than he ever had before.  He hated staying inside his house, the residual magic from
.  Now Potter?  Ignore the whole Savior of the World complex and you’ve got a simple man, Draco.  He likes simple things.  You’re going to take him to that ridiculous pub and you’re going to wear that.”
male.”
“Obviously,” Harry agreed.  Then he took a larger pull from his glass, clearly enjoying the selection Draco had chosen.  After he’d swallowed, he allowed himself to ask, “Just...how long have you known you were interested in other men, Malfoy?”
There were some families (like the Weasley’s) that always received their invitations and threw them in the trash shortly after.  So, it came as a startling surprise when Mrs. Parkinson was greeting her guests at the entrance hall when she caught sight of vibrant long red hair.  The young female Weasley bustled through the crowd, with the charming Blaise Zabini on her arm.  Mrs. Parkinson recognized her immediately, having vaguely read about her controversial relationship with the Potter boy.  Apparently, she left him to pursue a career in Quidditch and was training with the Harpies.
But what ended up happening instead was Draco squirming out from under him and avoiding blows at all costs.  He didn’t want to swing at Potter—he knew if he even attempted it, chances are he’d be punished for such a thing.  So, he darted this way and that.  Their instructor was bored and impatient and whistled to signal the end of the demonstration.  And when they were finished, Harry had a confused look to his face and asked, “Why didn’t you hit me?”  Draco never did answer his question.
“Like a slob?” he asked sadly, his eyes looking down at his trainers.  At least he’d convinced Pansy to allow him to buy new shoes rather than using his running trainers.
“I never thought I’d witness the day you’d say I was better than Weasley at something,” Draco smirked.
All of a sudden Potter’s door burst open and music blared into the silence.  It was some muggle song, string instruments and a piano in the background while a man sang about chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose.  Draco had no idea what that nonsense was about, but before he could even take time to comprehend it all, Potter was backing out of his door, hunched over and dragging a tree into the living room!
“They are a little tight,” he agreed, while finishing off his roast.
“How crude,” Draco wrinkled his nose, standing up from their table and wrapping his coat around himself.
“Of course,” he answered, trying his best to smile.  Her gaze saw right through that, and Draco tried his hardest not to slink back.  Another moment and she’d closed her door.  He took a deep breath, then looked around to make sure no one was watching before he apparated.
Dean stood up from the table, blocking Draco from Ron’s line of sight.  Dean was easily the tallest guy in their dorm, and he looked down his nose at Ron.  “He’s our friend.  Got a problem with that?”  His voice carried weight and Draco was silently impressed.  “He’s here because he fucking lives here.  He can be in his room, he can be in our room, he can be out here.  If you’ve got an issue with that you can just bugger the fuck off right now.”
It was as if he was floating—flying with the clouds.  Days later the feeling remained, and he wasn’t sure if he’d land on the ground anytime soon.  He absentmindedly fell into his daily routines, but his mind was back in that alleyway with Potter’s lips against his.  He wanted that again, and he kept wondering when will be the next time they’d see each other.
Malfoy turned to face him on the couch, gaping at him.  “Um well...” his voice sounded hoarse and Harry found it, dare he say it, almost charming.
“Going to use some other wandless trick?” Draco mumbled.  He had his arm draped over his face, eyes shut and completely spent.
to Harry.
Instantly, Potter stopped.  He turned around to face Draco, a sheepish smile on his face.  “Oh sorry, didn’t know anyone was out here...”
“Harry...you look,” he paused, gulping.  “You look amazing.  I am the idiot that neglected to tell you where I was taking you.  I felt under dressed to begin with, so if you’d like to wait, I can go change and we’ll go somewhere else.”  He made to turn, a flush forming on his cheeks.
He shook his head, this time genuinely smiling at her.  It’d been too long since he’d smiled in all honesty.  “I know...now I have to get you a present.”
Suddenly there was a crash from the fireplace and the Floo roared, spitting out another man.  He dusted off his robe, “Sorry Draco, I didn’t mean to be so late.  You know how it gets down in filing and records..”  He paused, his gaze finally meeting them at the couch.  “Oh...”
Draco shook his head, blonde hair falling into his face.  “You keep it,” he suggested, his face turning a shade darker from embarrassment.  He really needed to get his emotions under control—who knew what he’d conjure next?
But perhaps that’d work, in all actuality.  If Draco looked like he was just getting ready for his next lesson, Harry wouldn’t think anything of it.  With his mind made up, he pulled on his uniform and spelled his hair to the side like he’d chosen to wearing lately.  He inhaled deeply when he heard Ron leaving rather loudly and knew now was the time.
the place Potter would want to go to.”
Instantly, Harry’s lips crashed on Draco’s and their world was spinning.
“You...um,” Harry continued the nervous gesture of rubbing the back of his neck.  “You look really nice this morning,” he finished, coloring an even darker shade.
She scoffed, reaching into her bag for her keys.  Her flat was in a Muggle neighborhood and even though she could have easily unlocked the door with her wand, she liked to keep up appearances.  “Draco Malfoy, you will do no such thing.”  He watched her open the door and instantly they were flooded with light from her entrance hall.  “All I want for Christmas is to for you to take care of yourself...and well, to be happy.”
“So, what do you mean they haven’t been together since 6th year?  I saw them after the battle, arm in arm.  The Prophet’s taken loads of pictures of them kissing.  It’s sickening really.”  Draco said over his vodka tonic.
Draco smiled, nodding.  “Yep.”
Blushing from the praise, Draco tried not to squirm too much.  His eyes were so intense, it almost felt like Harry was touching him already.  And oh, how Draco really wanted for Harry to touch him.  His whole skin felt like it was humming, nerves on fire, and magic tingling within him.  “Come here,” he asked, losing his mind.  He wanted Harry.  Now.
Pansy Parkinson truly had a gift.  When she was four years old, she convinced her stoic father to get her a pony.  When she was twelve it was to meet the Weird Sisters.   And now (at 20) it was to persuade Draco Malfoy to join her for drinks in downtown Muggle London.  No one else seemed to have the sway that she possessed.  Was it her plump vermilion lips in that pout that she’d perfected over the years?  Or perhaps her large chocolate eyes that stared unblinkingly back at you, hoping you’d agree to whatever she asked?  Or maybe it was the sheer knowledge that if you didn’t cow to her wishes you’d be on the wrong end of her vicious vengeance—and Draco Malfoy had learned the first time with that one.
When Draco opened his eyes, Pansy had already left him on the couch and had joined the boys in the kitchen.  She was reaching for a lemon bar.  “Pansy!” he wailed.
“Ugh,” Padma groaned, covering her face in her hands.  “I had no idea about Harry.  He hadn’t been with any men before—at least that I know of.  And Draco?  Wasn’t he with Pansy?  We could have sworn we heard her coming in here not too long ago and disappearing in his room with him.”
“No, I’m not thinking that at all.  I’m thinking I might need to leave the room before you jump him.  And if I witness anything to go obliviate myself.”
Harry laughed, shaking his head.  “You’re ridiculous, Draco.”  He said, at last turning away from Draco to open up his gym bag on the floor.
“You too dear,” she responded, kissing his own cheek.  Then she took off towards her flat, just a few blocks away.
Harry chuckled, and started to pull himself up.  Draco wasn’t having that.  He pushed him again, this time at his shoulders.  Harry fell back in a loud thump.  Then before he could recover, Draco leaped.  He swiftly slipped an arm around Harry’s waist, holding him in place.  Harry started to lift his legs for better leverage, only to have Draco press his knee down on one calf, the other hand holding his thigh down.  “You give?”  he asked, panting.
Frowning, Draco could already see the plan in motion forming across her face.  Sure enough she started, “If you want, I could talk to—”
“Fuck,” Harry exhaled shakily, collapsing on the bed next to Draco.  He wiped his brow, his lips fighting a grin as he looked at how severely flushed and debauched Draco looked.
?  He knew it was going to end someday, knew it was all coming to a point.  He dreaded thinking of the next time his Mark would flare—he wasn’t ready to go.  He was never ready for that.  If his Mark burned and Draco left, what would he find at the end of that summon?
“Fuck, Dean!  Fucking knock you wanker!” Shouted Potter.
“Oh, darling, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.  They are so wrong for each other, it’s hilarious really...”
Embarrassed, Draco had now covered his face in his hands while the waiter laughed lightheartedly.  “I’m sorry, miss.  This is only a coffee shop, but perhaps the pub around the corner could help in that regard.”
Harry’s grin was turning downright feral at this point, the longer Draco took to respond to
The moment their skin touched, Draco was frozen.  He looked at their hands, feeling his face heat up.  He fumbled with the disc, dropping it awkwardly into Potter’s hands.  If Potter noticed Draco’s fumble, he hadn’t said anything.  Instead his lips broke out into a small smile, before he slipped the music into the player.  He pushed another button and music slowly started to fill the room.  The sound of drums and a keyboard started playing to a steady beat.  Harry let out a delighted laugh, which made Draco’s insides squirm.
Draco blinked, his mind having a hard time processing what he’d just said.  He gaped silently and was just about to respond when Harry quickly cut in.  “Listen, if it’s too soon, that’s fine too.  I’ve just thought about this and I don’t think I can handle the idea of you with another person right now.  I mean, I realize it’s pretty common to just date around, or get to know several people at once.  But Draco, I guess—what I’m trying to say is I don’t need to do that.  I think I’ve found what I’m looking for.  So, if you need more—”
Groaning, Harry had to squeeze himself for a moment to get under control.  “I know I told you to call me Harry,” he muttered, moving in between Draco’s legs.  “But I’m starting to reconsider.”  Then Harry couldn’t wait another moment, and took Draco deep in his mouth.
“Just make sure he takes his time preparing you.  Just use lots of lube,” Seamus grinned cheekily, but faltered at the look Draco gave him across the table.  “Er, or you take time preparing him?  I didn’t mean to assume you were the bottom!  I have no idea, sorry for bringing it up!”
With her bright red lips in a pout, she continued, “Oh all right.  Could you please bring us two more of those lemon bars then?  Maybe the extra sugar would help this disaster...”
It seemed like an evening like any other.  Draco had finished studying on the common abbreviations used in Auror reports and he was in need of tea if he was going to finish through the whole assignment.  He peeked into the common area, was relieved to see it empty, and made his way to the kettle around the corner.  Standing there, he rubbed at his eyes while he waited for the pot to boil.
Harry’s eyes twinkled across the table.  "You’re so posh, Draco,” he said, warmly.  It was clearly a compliment from his tone of voice.  “I’m sure it’ll be lovely.”
She shook her head, pulling Draco along with her once more.  “Let’s go, Draco.  I’ll tell you about it when we get to the bar.  It’s fucking freezing out here...”
Harry laughs, shaking his head.  “She guessed before I could even get the words out.  I think when I’d came out as bisexual, she had a sneaking suspicion.  She seems to think we’d be good together, if you’ve truly changed your...er, past prejudices.”
His partner made a face, buttoning up his robe and flattening his platinum hair in place.  Harry was pleased to see the mark along his neck that Harry gave him was still visible over his Auror collar.  “We’d only been together a month.  Had to get close to him in order to investigate him.  Was going to dose him with veritaserum over the weekend to get his confession, but I kind of like how this turned out better.”  He winked, walking over to Harry’s piles of clothes and throwing them in his face.
“You’re not even halfway done with your report!  Do you want to be an Auror or not?”  Draco huffed, irritation rising.
“Right,” Harry smiled knowingly.  “Well I guess if you don’t want to try being friends, we can try to go back to being stupid rivals.  It’s kind of not the same without separate houses, different Quidditch teams, and threatening to get the other into detention though...”
“I won’t hurt you,” Harry’s voice cut in through Draco’s thoughts and brought him back to where they were now.  He frowned, “I just spar with Ron all the time and he’s not very good.  I think I need more of a challenge.”  He stood up from his hunched position, stretching his arms over his head.  Draco tried desperately not to look at the stripe of skin at his waist that was revealed from his shirt riding up.  “I recall I couldn’t even land a punch on you the last time.  In order for me to get better, I think I need the practice with a better partner.”
“Hi,” he coughed, clearing his throat.  He could already feel the flush rising from the back of his neck.  But he went ahead and carried on with his plan.  He had a script to stick to.  “I, um, received your Christmas card.”
How could he have forgotten about her and Longbottom?  He guessed that he'd been too focused on his own problems with Potter, he’d neglected to ask about what was going on with her.  He felt like a right twat.  But before he could dwell too much on that, she reached for his hand and started to pull him towards his room.  “Oh, don’t put on that face, dear.  I’ll tell you all about it in good time.  It’s still very new and we’re not entirely sure what we are looking for right now.”
Draco ran in the mornings, before the rest of his fellow classmates even stirred.  It was the only time he had to himself.  He’d layer his clothes when it was cold, charm his shoes to resist slipping, and even repel the rain.  Inclement weather didn’t stop him.  He needed to run each morning, just like he needed to eat or breathe.  It was his only escape in those dark months.
“Wait,” Harry grabbed him by the sleeve and turned Draco back around.  “No, don’t,” this time Harry was the one who had started to blush.  “I really want to see where you were going to take me, dressed like this.  Fuck, Draco you look...”
“You own the old Black property,” Draco noted.  It was common knowledge.  Draco hadn’t stepped foot in that home since he was a small child.  All he could vaguely remember of the place was drafty windows and those horrifying House Elf heads.  He really hoped Harry had gotten rid of those, at least.
They had both finished their meals, the bottle just about empty as well.  Harry stared at Draco across the table, warm and intense.  Draco could feel his gaze raking over him, particularly lingering on his lips and neck.  He couldn’t fight the flush that rose up his face even if he tried.  Draco gulped the last bit of wine in his glass and it slipped clumsily out of his hands as he set it back down.  “Want to get out of here?” he croaked, his stomach in knots.
Parvati leaned in, and began to whisper, “Yeah and what is even up with that?  Have you noticed Harry and Ron are hardly ever here?  They get in rather late on the nights they do stay here.  I think they are staying somewhere else for half the week.  I’d bet they are at Granger’s.”
“Friends?”  Draco laughed, a little too harshly.  Potter blushed furiously, his eyes so intent on watching Draco seemed to falter.  “You and I...we could never be friends,” Draco added, his voice neutral.  He wasn’t sad about this idea, it was a truth he’d learned to accept over the years.  It’d been a long time since he cried over Potter not being his friend, he wasn’t hurt by it anymore.
“No!”  Draco quickly cut in, his hand already reaching for his door again.
Then all of a sudden Harry swung at Draco, and it was so unexpected that Draco moved back, releasing his hold on his thigh.  With his leg free, Harry wrapped it quickly around Draco’s waist and turned them around.  He grappled for Draco’s hands, Draco squirming under him and making it almost impossible.  He kept trying to bring his legs up to kick Harry off of him and the only way for Harry to stop that was to lean his other leg over both of Draco’s.
“Yes,” Draco answered automatically.  Then his blush rose as he’d realized what he’d just agreed to.  Of course, Draco wanted it.  He’d dreamed and fantasized about shagging Harry for years, it was not a new concept by any means.  But for it to actually happen—that Harry would even want to, it was almost unbelievable.
in some horrid plaid pants and an oversized t-shirt.  Draco always had to put in some sort of effort, and even then, he was pretty sure he didn’t sparkle, thank you very much.
Draco walked over to her.  She was sitting on an antique settee with a book propped open in her lap.  Draco tried to glance at the pages but she hastily shut it and threw a pillow over the cover.  He raised an eyebrow at that but before he could inquire any further, she’d pulled the card out of his hands.  Draco waited patiently for her to finish reading it.
set aside by the fireplace.  Pansy gasped, as he carried the thick bundle of wood to the table.  Seamus dropped it, the loud thump as it hit the table deafening.  Then they were all cackling hysterically, and Draco had just about enough.
“Nothing really, I can’t call that slop they serve us anything even resembling food.”
Green eyes blazed.  “Are you sure?” he asked, swallowing hard.
“You going to ask him out here?” Dean asked, slurping up the rest of his lo mein.
Harry groaned automatically, opening his mouth to allow Draco’s tongue to slip inside.  He was going absolutely mad with the feel of Draco completely underneath him, and Harry couldn’t stand it anymore.  With his other hand not holding Draco’s wrists, he brought it up to Draco’s chest and caressed him through the fabric of his shirt.  He loved how sharp the planes of his chest felt, and Harry couldn’t help yanking on the t-shirt and pulling it aside.  At last his hands connected with bare flesh, and Draco moaned along Harry’s lips.
He laughed nervously, pushing Harry’s hands aside to help him get it off that much quicker.  When the last button finally slipped free, Harry quickly shucked it off Draco’s shoulders and proceeded to pull out his silk shirt from his trousers.  His hand came up to Draco’s collar, gently working those buttons down as well.  Draco stopped breathing, feeling Harry’s fingers brush against his bare chest.  “H-Harry,” he stuttered.
“Potter, he tried to kill you.  I should be asking you that,” Malfoy replied, closing in on him and eyeing him carefully.
Draco shook his head, picking up the mugs and bringing them over to the sink.  He washed them by hand, his fingers trailing along the word
“Oh, like you’re not thinking it too, Draco,” she challenged him.
“He’d rather have followed you around than play Quidditch.  Merlin, it was so pathetic.  Then I thought after the war things would get better.  That he’d finally be able to get over his fascination with you.  But boy, was I wrong about that.  ‘Ginny, do you think they’ll take my statement seriously?  His mother saved my life.  He saved my life.  I don’t think he deserves prison, do you?’  Or every time he’d see your photo in the paper.  ‘He looks so different, Ginny.  Do you think he’s getting enough to eat?  They haven’t taken all of his money, have they?’  I was so done with it, in all honesty.  I’ve lost count how many times I told him to just fucking write you if he was so concerned.”
Grinning that same maddening smile, Harry closed his fingers around the ornament.  “Thanks,” he said.
Draco felt his lips tug at the corners, and he gave Harry a hesitant smile.  “I want you too,” he said simply.
“What exactly have you told him?” Draco asked, frowning.
Draco glared daggers at him.  But before he could tell him off, Dean placed the mug with snitches in front of Seamus.  “Here you go babe.”  Then in the next moment, another mug was set in front of Draco.  It wasn’t his typical plain white mug.
Fuck this, he thought and stepped inside the fireplace.  “Draco Malfoy’s flat!”  He shouted, the flames licking up his boots and pissing him off even more.  God how he hated the Floo, he thought as he felt the familiar pull in his navel.
“Yeah,” Harry’s inevitable grin broke out upon his face.
“You really think I’m pathetic?” he asked, frowning.  He watched his wine swivel around.
“Sure,” he muttered in a clipped tone, secretly wanting to run away instead.  He opened up the cabinet and looked at all the mugs of his dormmates.  His face now hidden, he took a moment to take a deep breath and calm himself.  Just which cup was Potter’s?  It was a minute before he eventually made an educated guess and bypassed the bright red cup with snitches to the white one with black deer heads and antlers.  His hands were shaking as he poured the tea, but he was fortunate enough not to spill anything.  Then, without thinking, he pulled the sugar bowl over and dumped a huge helping along with some milk.  Draco preferred his tea a little bitter, but he knew Potter had quite a sweet tooth.
“Really?”  Draco asked in surprise.  One second he felt like falling, the next flying.
"So, Potter, would you like to put our rivalry past us?"
As soon as we got to the school, we were taken upstairs and I kept whispering to Crabbe and Goyle all the jokes we should play on the professors and students. We were silently giggling as we reached a little case of stairs and were told to wait there. That was when I spotted him.
Hermione took my free hand and dragged me to our next class.
"I thought you said you weren't going to eat?" She questioned. "Are you feeling okay?"
I was interrupted by Potter stepping closer to me. "I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy." He pressed his palm against my chest and shoved. I grunted in shock and frustration. And although I would never admit it, but I was a little turned on. His green eyes were intensely glaring into my eyes, as if he could see right through me. And he was so close I could feel his warm breath on my face.
Please comment and leave kudos if you enjoyed this story and want me to continue.
As soon as he noticed I was looking at him, he let out a sound I couldn't hear from this far and jumped. He quickly looked to Longbottom who was talking. But I could tell Harry was flushed with embarrassment.
"Of course, why? You forgot again?" I laughed as he pulled out the textbook. As I was explaining to him in toddler format so he'd understand, I spotted Harry looking at me while talking to Ron. As soon as my eyes met his, he looked away with a red tint to his cheeks.
I walked back to the Slytherin commons room and whispered in the password. As soon as I got back to the room, I was ambushed. Blaise grabbed my wrist and pulled me into the room. I yanked against his grip, "What the hell!" He forced me onto the couch and pushed me down. I let out a scream and he climbed on top of me. I searched his eyes and pleaded for him to stop as he pinned my wrists over my head and started to grind on me. His hips were between mine and he was completely on top of me. I couldn't move. His dark eyes were darker than usual and he leaned down to suck on my neck. His warm tongue found my sweet spot and I unintentionally let out a tiny grunt.
"Let's start over, shall we?"
Before I could see whatever expression crossed his face, I turned around and walked away. I felt a prickle of danger in my neck telling me that he was pulling out his wand but the Moody came to my rescue. I turned around to see Malfoy turn into a....ferret? He let out a squeak and I giggled because oh my merlin...he looked adorable. I just wanted to pick him up and cuddle with it. But then my eyes widened because, 'did I really just think that?' and 'he's my enemy, I can't think things like that.'
"I could ask you the same thing."
-------------------------
"I'm not a fag. Now shut your mouth or I'll hex you so hard, your grandchildren will feel it."
"What do you have against Harry Potter?" I asked, a little out of it because 'Merlin, why is this strange girl sitting next to me?'. "Oh and also, please do come in." I teased as the sarcasm rolled off of my tongue. She rolled her eyes.
'No no. I don't want this. I don't like this!' My mind screamed. But he continued his actions and soon his left hand was left holding my wrists while the other slowly inched towards my waistband.
Harry's POV
Harry's POV
"Why so tense, Potter?" My muscles tensed up on cue and I looked up to where the sound was coming from. I sighed irritably. It's just Malfoy. He said that he and his father didn't think I'd last more than 10 minutes in the tournament and that's when I snapped. "I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy." I glared. It was true. I could care less about his father. But I did wish that Dra-Malfoy had more hope in me. Why? I don't know why. But I did care about what he thought, and it hurt that he was hoping I'd die. Why did that hurt so much?
He started backing away, the corners of his mouth slightly tugged up a little to form a tiny smile. He looked relaxed and at ease. "Good night, Potter."
"Anything from the cart, boys?" An old muggle lady smiled as she passed our cabin. I gave a polite smile, even though I was disgusted that they hired muggles on this train.
But I couldn't help but wonder why I felt guilty and bad for laughing at Malfoy. Why did I care?
*look at his little genuine smile, awww*
He angrily scribbled 'I HATE YOU' in bold print on the parchment but the ink disappeared and Draco felt immense pain on his hip. He let out a hiss and clutched his hip. He ran to the bathroom in his dorm and pulled the waistband of his trousers down just enough to see the words "I HATE YOU" cut into his skin, red blood trickling from the cut. A single tear escaped Draco's eyes. 'Fuck you, Blaise.'
"I wanted to join that competition. Why did he get to?" I mumbled quietly. I felt Pansy wrap her arms around me. I tensed up but felt myself relaxing a few seconds after. Pansy always knew how to help me calm down. Crabbe and Goyle and a few of my other friends were gathered around a tree. Pansy said that she had to get to Potions, so it was just me and the rest of my idiot friends. I spotted Potter walking down the corridor, so I suddenly had a brilliant idea. I smirked as I climbed up the tree we were all huddled around and brushed my shaggy blonde hair out of my eyes. I saw him make eye contact with everyone looking tired and displeased. I called out,
"My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're going to last 10 minutes in this tournament. He disagrees," I took that moment to jump down and walk a little closer to him.
"Prat," Draco growled and shoved him backwards. Blaise smiled innocently,
Malfoy didn't quite hear the last one. Perhaps, because he passed out and woke up only by the moment when Snape more or less healed his wounds and was able to somehow raise him to his feet. Draco was as bad as ever. He hadn’t felt himself like shit for a long time: his whole body ached as if he had just been tortured. However, the professor helped him get to the hospital wing, where he was left at the disposal of Pomfrey alone.
"That we love you," still smiling, the dark-skinned italian responded and carefully watched the reaction of his friend to his gift. "And, in order not to quarrel, we decided to wait until you grow up and choose for yourself, which of us you prefer."
Pansy's hand trembled and within a second she cursed. Malfoy covered his left ear with his good hand, while with the "ill" one continued to put apples in his mouth.
"Don't worry, you still have many years to think it over," Blaise winked, and then added, "But you better choose me."
"Draco, I'm sorry, I... don't die, please!
In the library of the Zabini family, Draco often felt as if he sat on pins and needles, but outwardly, of course, he never dared to show it. He knew that his little friend was drawn to him, but he just couldn't understand why. No one had yet explained to him what love was and that the weird thing written in the books was impossible to figure out on his own. It was much easier to learn the recipe for making a death potion than this.
And suddenly Draco burst into laughter.
School is finally over. As Draco expected, he passed the exams with the best marks, as did many other slytherins and, of course, Hermione. Parting with Hogwarts was sad in its own way, but Malfoy wasn't discouraged. At the weddings of Blaise and Theodore, he was obliged to behave happy, so as not to make the guests sad as well. Pansy, noticing the strained smiles of her friend, only laughed, "You are such a snake, Dray. Well, that's why I love you." Malfoy knew all this very well. It's simply impossible not to love him – even Potter couldn't resist these charms. He sent him off by the end of the school year, yet at Blaise's wedding, where the groom himself was completely unhappy, suddenly crawled to apologize.
The boys didn't let him say a word.
"Draco, listen... I'm sorry, but you already have suitors. I really don't want to stand between you all."
"Well, then it'll be as usual. Moreover, a couple of hickeys for the night won't hurt you," the Italian grinned. "Maybe you'll start sleeping better."
"You? Maybe yeah. But I'm uncomfortable here."
"Yes, I know. But it's still interesting to look at the process."
"But what about...?"
All night Malfoy wondered what he should do. A bunch of ideas came to his mind, but shortly after he was struck by a single good one, for which he even came up with an ideal plan. Deciding not to even try to go to bed, at five in the morning Draco sat down to write Mrs. Zabini and Mr. Nott letters. They were of different content and, possibly, with mistakes, due to the fact that the blond didn't close his eyes for almost a whole day, but it was clearly worth it, because the answers came to him at about two o'clock in the afternoon. It's easiest to negotiate with Blaise's mom – he knew that a hint in one word was enough for her to agree. After all, Beatrice Zabini is a woman who, for the sake of wealth, killed all her husbands. And, as for Nott's father, Draco won't even have to negotiate.
"Do as your mother tells you. Everything will work out, I'm sure," the blond whispered, snatching his hand back. "Besides, no matter what and wherever you are, I'll still love you. You know that.
Malfoy felt like with his skin that something in his life was going wrong. As if he should live some other life, which differs in one small detail from his current one. Everything was just... not the way it should be. For two whole years, the boy contrived to make up insults and set up all sorts of pranks in order to annoy Potter and his friends. Goyle and Crabbe were always there, in order to protect him in case of serious danger from someone from the Weasleys (and there were a lot of them, "jeez, they multiplied pretty quickly," the blond thought to himself). Blaise and Theodore naturally didn't leave their friend either. Sometimes they even helped in creating various things for pranks or discussed what offensive they could say about Granger's teeth tomorrow. Seeing their friend enjoying something, no matter what exactly it was, was just as fun for them. Boys were ready to do l anything for him and Malfoy saw it.
"I... well, I'll think about it," Malfoy finally managed to say in a more or less calm tone.
"Come on, Dray, this trio of idiots aren't worth it," Pansy whispered in his ear and the insulted to the core blond boy could only snort. "There, there, don't be so angry. Sorting is coming soon."
"I told you, Potter," Draco grinned. "They didn't mean it. These rings are just stupid playthings from childhood."
At breakfast, neither father nor mother paid attention to what Draco wore around his neck and finger, no matter how much he tried to draw their attention to objects on his body. For some reason, parents decided that someone just gave their son jewelry and he choose to wear them in such a strange manner. In any case, they'd be calm until one of the rings will be on his right hand – Malfoy understood that quite well.
Malfoy just rolled his eyes, grinning. His years at school were quite calm. He continued to bully Potter, not knowing why. He just wanted to. It was like eating chocolate. You don't have to, but the treat is too tasty to resist, so Draco continued. Nothing particularly interesting happened in the fourth year, apart from the boy becoming a ferret. Draco was nervous for a long time at the sight of the his defense teacher, but Blaise's reliable hand, which held the ends of Malfoy's thin fingers, helped to calm down. Theodore watched this picture and only bit his lips with displeasure. Astoria always giggled as she walked by,
Malfoy is incapable of killing, no matter who tells him otherwise. But Potter, who appeared at the wrong time, seems to have the courage to kill someone and not even regret it.
"Oh, I'm begging you. Me? A villain? Don't be ridiculous," the blond chuckled as he ate the fruit that Blaze brought and even cutted for Draco. "Plus, you have nothing to worry about. My plans aren't targeted towards you."
"He ordered me to marry a woman... otherwise he'll remove me from the family tree," the guy somehow managed to squeeze this out of himself in a trembling voice. His friend stroked his messy hair and whispered something under his breath.
"Of course I'm right. It's fine, next week's final exams and after that you'll be happy with your fiancée. And I'm always going to think about you."
If Umbridge or Filch had caught them, they'd obviously have received a terrible scolding or at least a detention for "inappropriate behavior within the walls of the school." But Theodore honestly didn't care, because at the moment he could only think about how unevenly Draco's breathing was and how wonderful his hair smelled.
"Blaise, and yet... you know, I'm not ready for this to be...
During the war, Malfoy had no time to think about childhood's promises and rings. All that worried him was how he would survive. By the way, in a war, and especially in a magical one, it's extremely difficult to do this. Many victims of this are perfect examples. Blaise tried to convince Draco to hide somewhere in another country, but Malfoy knew that he couldn't easily leave his father and mother. He is obliged to be with them to the end, even though friends didn't appreciate his point of view. They all believed that their own lives were more precious. Perhaps, this is why the Dark Lord ultimately lost.
Maybe he was just hiding them. Or maybe someone didn't let them show up.
Draco wasn't very fond of this unsightly process. He, in general, didn't like all of this, but most of all he didn't like himself. In the mirror, the blond saw not the great and proud Malfoy, but some kind of a doormat. Tears poured into the sink without stopping. Draco knew he was a slytherin. They all get rid of what they don't need, but
Ron blinked in surprise.
Alas, not for long. By morning, visitors had already appeared in his room, but out of them all the one who was allowed to come in was... Ron Weasley. As strange as it sounds.
Draco removed the string from his neck and the ring from his finger. His eyes were squinted again. Mother and father were still celebrating at Blaise's weddings, while he was already in the manor near the fireplace that had just been kindled by the house elves. Malfoy examined the gifts and remembered the sincere pleasure with which his friends gave him these things. They were happy. They believed him. They
Draco no longer listened to him and decided that he'd just fall asleep, while the Weasleys talked about his studies and about what was happening in the world beyond the white walls. Malfoy should also make the note to "apologize to Granger or she will eat you for being so rude."
Draco could barely hold back a heavy breath. He sees it now. He had no choice since birth. Even now, in fact, there was none, because no one else but these two could be considered for marriage. Or there were? In general, is it even legal to marry your friend, especially considering that both of you are boys? Malfoy had no idea, but he knew that asking his father that would be a death sentence. Which, moreover, is signed by the convicted person himself. It was also clear from friends' faces that it was better for all this circus thing with rings to be just a shared children's secret.
"You're the first one who speaks to me as before," Potter said, sitting down in an empty chair, and smiled contentedly. "I'm really glad to see you again."
Potter felt like an idiot. Like a huge-huge idiot. He apologized for a very long time for his words and Malfoy, in the end, accepted the apology, saying that everything is fine, that he is no longer angry. On the same day, they agreed to meet on saturday at seven in the evening. Draco knew instantly that he had finally got what he needed.
"Hmm, how did you guess?" Theo chuckled and immediately got hit by elbow in the stomach. "Come on, we sit well, after all."
Zabini, of course, was upset, but after that he smiled happily again.
"Nope, there is no such tradition to wear two rings at the same time. This is nothing more than a stupid game, where two boys have to buy me out like I'm an object."
He hated fire ever since Crabbe died in it. But Draco hated Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott even more, so it was quite the right decision to throw their stupid rings in the fireplace. For the first time Malfoy watched the flames with a smile. Father would be proud with who his son has become.
Yes, this is the right word, because from his earliest years Malfoy had to learn how to make the right calculations in life. And always so that he would benefit from this. Little Draco absorbed, like a just bought and completely new sponge, all the advice of his mother and teachings of his father from an early age. It turned out that they really helped when, at the age of ten, he first encountered boys from wealthy magical families, who were so alike to him.
"You yourself know very well, where we'll all end up and how it'll end," the boy said, rolling his eyes and crossing arms on his chest. He was still angry. How dare this Potter...!
"Thanks, I'm aware. If you came to bully me, then, at least, be quiet. I suffer enough without you... thanks to your Potter, by the way."
Draco just grinned at that. Parkinson always interpreted good thoughts and this was clearly one of them. His gaze darted to the rings: the first on the finger, the other on the neck. He still had years of difficult choices ahead of him, but he already wanted to give up this. For some reason, all his attention was now attracted only to this impudent boy in round glasses and with a stupid scar on his forehead.
Harry laughed loudly and Draco's heart fluttered for some reason. Why was it never like that with Blaise or Theodore? Maybe they were doing something wrong? Or was Malfoy somehow... broken? He seems to have only two choices in his life, doesn't he?
Nott, slightly uncertainly, ran his hand over his friend's chest and felt the ring with his fingers. A smile immediately blossomed on his face and his hands slipped lower to Malfoy's stomach. Draco's sharp breath prevented them from going any lower. Theodore knew how innocent the blond was (not knowing what sex is by the age of fifteen is unforgivable, and not only Nott thought so), so he instantly tried to translate it all into a joke. He needs to do everything to make his friend comfortable. For this, Theodore was ready for anything. Hugging Malfoy around the waist, the brunette immediately purred,
"Dray, you are, of course, a genius, I'd say," the girl giggled as she ran a small brush over her own nail. "Sometimes, even I want to know what's going on in your villainous head."
Malfoy squinted his eyes and then closed his eyes altogether, smiling sweetly.
"Nevermind. One very interesting gift awaits you for your birthday."
"But they don’t think so. They have serious plans for you."
The blond didn't say anything, instead only left a gentle and childishly light, as if completely weightless, kiss on his friend's cheek and then smiled at him. Blaise had tears in his eyes, while Draco for some reason smiled softly.
"Just don't take any silly ideas. I still want to beat you up for calling Hermione names."
Draco knows their family very well in order to be aware of what will happen very soon. Reading the reply letters, teen smiled and squinted at the same time. In the evening, Blaise approached him with an incredibly lost expression on his face.
Theodore couldn’t hold back a sob as he glanced at the ring that still hung around Draco’s neck.
"I can't," Draco agreed. "But I'll do my best to help. You'd better get married."
"D-don't do that anymore," Draco said nervously, then exhaled.
"Foreign?" Draco asked, blinking his eyes. "And why so?"
Well, it's fine. Draco will show him the wasp's sting.
Draco chuckled.
Draco hated the sixth year as well as he hated Voldemort. Yeah, no doubt, at first he admired him (no matter how stupid it may sound) and was glad to please his father with receiving a mark. However, after that he began to understand that he was only being used.
"Hey, Malfoy, nice to see you at Hogwarts again," but he couldn't possibly calcute that. "How are your mother and father?"
"Blaise, Theo..." Draco hissed through clenched teeth. "It's time to do something with you. I can no longer take any of this."
He increased the size of Blaise's ring with spells, when it began to press too much on his finger, while Theodore's ring continued to obediently hang around his neck. Draco's eyes always were squinted as he watched his friends' every move. Interesting. Very interesting. There was often a grin on his face that only Pansy could see.
"Of course not. You piss me off, but lately I've gotten used to it."
"Mhm, then I would like to know, who you chose as your victim, sweetiepie."
"Dray, you're tired," Theo, who was sitting on the windowsill in the empty hallway, called suddenly. "Come here, at least we'll rest."
He has matured and became wiser. He finally achieves his goal. The most ambitious slytherin of them all, isn't he?
Malfoy flinched when he saw an outstretched hand in front of him. At first he was struck by shock, but after that teen came to his senses and, shaking his head, somehow accepted the handshake. Right hand. Harry, for some reason, turned his attention to Draco's left hand.
"Quite good. In a month, father will be free from Azkaban and mother is getting better in Mungo. Everything will work out for us, don't worry," flipping through the pages of the book, the blond answered in an even voice. "And also step aside. Your shadow prevents me from reading."
him. Draco looked at both rings for a long time without any emotion, but then suddenly an insane grin, full of maniacal fun, lit up his face.
The girl was never offended. On the contrary, laughed even louder. Oh my god, slytherin girls clearly liked to piss off slytherin boys. But most of all, Theodore, of course, was pissed off by the bloody Potter. Guy noticed how Draco looked at the stupid scarhead and he clearly didn't like it. Perhaps, because his own gaze was always directed to the face of his friend. Nott just couldn't enjoy how fast Malfoy was growing.
And suddenly Malfoy gently hugged Nott, gently pulling him to him. Again Draco whispered something under his breath, and then sighed heavily. Theodore didn't really understand what exactly his friend was trying to achieve by this, but still didn't want to distance himself.
"Enough, zip it! Shut up before I shove those apples up your skinny ass!"
Malfoy was still watching his friends' every move. And he always squinted his eyes.
"...Draco! It's your fault, fucker! I ruined my manicure because of you!"
Nott winced, tensing up. He thought about something, but then suddenly frowned and, grinning, let out,
"And you? Would you kill me?"
"Listen, don't be mad at Harry. We all didn't know this spell and what it does. Harry wouldn't have killed anyone," the guy was silent for a while, and then added, "Even you."
"...so, since they got married, then..."
"I see... you know, I guess I have the same dream."
Harry didn't get it – it was written on his face.
"That was your plan, wasn't it?" Draco, who eventually had to sit on his friend's lap, asked.
The Weasley gave him an ambiguous look, and then, shaking his head, exhaled heavily.
Potter almost seemed to be crying.
"What have you forgotten here?" the blond said in a raspy voice.
"Well, get married. Parents know better, you yourself understand that."
Malfoy grinned suddenly as his heart beat faster in his chest. Either because he is dying or because Potter called him solely by his first name. This hasn't happened since the very first year.
He is about to make his choice very soon. Theodore sincerely hoped that on his right hand Draco would wear the ring that hung around his neck as for now. And Blaise, meanwhile, tried to do everything to appease Narcissa. He knew that, in spite of everything, his friend still values his mother more than his father, so he had to work his way through her. But lady Malfoy seemed to feel some kind of trick from the boy and didn't answer his letters, which tried to convince her that her son should spend more time at the Zabini family's manor or anywhere else in Italy.
"But...! Dray, our..." Blaise suddenly took Draco's left hand and bit on his own lip. "What about our wedding? Listen, I can talk to my mother. She'll understand, she'll try to understand!"
"Come on, don't be such a snake. Let's talk. Get to know each other better, hmm?"
"Mhm..." Draco whispered suddenly with a light smile. "Good to know."
"Mother says that when dreams coincide it's a good sign," the boy continued with a grin. "You and I are extremely lucky to have similar dreams."
He also didn't like Umbridge. But for her, as father taught, he had to smile sweetly and carry out all her orders. And maybe there would have been nothing wrong with that if the old toad hadn't put Theodore as an assistant (and at the same time as a substitute) for Malfoy. They had a lot of time to spend alone.
"And I'm glad to see you too, ferret," the red-haired teen grunted. "You look even worse than shit."
Potter laughed again. Blaise, who was standing nearby, between the racks, only clenched his teeth tighter. God, his hands were itching to hit Harry, but now something like that can officially be considered a crime worse than murder.
"I sleep well," Malfoy lied. Blaise's lips curled into a grin as he reached for Draco's pale neck.
Well, Zabini managed to get his friend's interest. Malfoy even tried to somehow blackmail Blaise, so that he'd share a secret and told what interesting would happen on fifth of june, but the brunette kept silent no matter what. Theo also didn't give in to any manipulation. It's okay, Draco consoled himself with the thought that with age he'd gain more experience in getting what he wanted. He had to wait until the summer and finally the day has come. Honestly, Malfoy could've expected anything. A lot of money, perhaps, even though he had it just enough in his bank account.
"Harry, y-you..." Malfoy said nervously, turning even more pale than he was before. "You misunderstood them. This is just their childish idea, this means nothing...!"
Malfoy glanced sideways at the presents in mute horror. Yes, that wasn't what he expected, but he shouldn't really show his shock that much.
"I think, rich and successful," his friend said with a smile. Pale fingers tightened on the hardcover book. No, he can't give himself away.
"I, this... Blaise, Theo," feeling how his voice suddenly trembled for some reason, Draco still somehow managed to keep talking. "What does this all mean?"
"I'm sorry, but I really don't want to spoil anything between you."
"Yes, Theo, me too."
Draco exhaled heavily and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his fingers.
'Maybe he'll be at breakfast!' the thought just hit me as I quickly rushed out of my room and to the great hall.
Scratch that, horrendous day.
I noticed while putting on a spray of cologne that my hands were shaking tremendously. Dark circles and puffiness formed under my dull gray eyes and I wondered if I should use a glamour to cover the bruises on my wrists.
Then he released me immediately and walked into the classroom. Leaving me, a panting, confused mess with a racing heart. After a few minutes of thinking and pacing next to the door, I walked in and Ron called me over with a huge smile. Like always..? As if nothing happened...
My face felt like it was on fire as he slowly stood up, still cupping his face. "Don't get any closer," I shouted, leaping to my feet and hiding behind the couch.
"MMPH!" I cried against his lips that were now on mine. I pulled with all my might and soon my left hand was free. I socked him in the jaw just as he reached into my boxers. He stumbled backward and fell off the couch. I let out a gasp and pulled out my wand that I couldn't grab during the assault. Blaise sat up holding the side of his face. I must've gotten his nose as well because it was bleeding. He looked at me with confused wide eyes.
---------------------------------
There will be happiness, don't worry!
Chapter one - Rejection
My eyes scanned him and I sized him up. I had at least a few inches on him.
"What's going on?" He asked, an uneasy feeling building up in his lower abdomen. Pansy smirked,
Silence. No one moved.
At that moment, she delicately placed her hand on my lower thigh. I squirmed uncomfortably and a little bit of panic kicked in as I shoved her hand off, resulting in an upset face.
"Nah," he shrugged and then we were by the classroom. He pulled me to the side before we could walk in. He bent down a little and his face got close to mine, making me wobble backwards, the back of my head tapping the cobble wall. Shock filled my body and confusion. My eyes widened at the proximity of us and I looked somewhat up at him. I was feeling uncomfortable. He looked me up and down (not so subtly) and his blue eyes darkened and it made a sharp spike of confusion shoot down my spine.
Malfoy stood in a look of disbelief or mockery, I couldn't quite tell. His eyebrow was raised slightly and the corner of his mouth was turned up a bit. I immediately felt foolish. There was no way Malfoy meant what he just said. I was an idiot. I flushed and mumbled "nevermind" turning to leave.
As soon as Professor McGonagall turned Dra-Malfoy back into himself, he got up. I saw his face turn a little red and....was that a tear I saw? No couldn't possibly be. He looked right at me and I masked my concern with a smirk and I laughed along with everyone. His eyes flashed hatred and some other emotion I couldn't perceive.
"Yes, father. I won't let you down."
Everyone started laughing harder as I kept getting lifted up and down. I felt sick. My insides did a flop. "Is-is that a student?!" She gasped in disbelief.
Then I noticed that I was in bed, I must've crawled into bed sometime last night.
Draco sneered, "Of course. I have since first year." He felt the lie roll off his tongue and he held his breath. Everyone started making eyes at each other and he grew uneasy again. "Why do you ask?"
"Potter...please. Just give it back," Draco pleaded desperately as Harry started unfolding the letter. Harry just looked up at him through his thick eyelashes and smirked. Draco panicked and started thinking of all the ways he could rid Potter of the parchment.
Also, why I was getting turned on watching Draco eat a fucking apple. What the bloody hell was that about? I snickered to myself.
Draco Malfoy will not ever be my friend because he is a bully.
Feeling excited that I was finally talking to the boy I've looked up to since I was young
Harry's POV
He smiled against my neck and started rocking his hips harder against mine. I tried breaking free again as my body started reacting very slowly.
In the middle of class, Ron's arm that was resting on my chair suddenly started shifting. His fingers started tracing patterns on my back. I squirmed uncomfortably and looked up at him to see what he was playing at. But he was looking right at the teacher. I narrowed my eyes and turned my head back to face the teacher like everyone else.
Draco reluctantly finished walking down the stairs and stopped behind the couch that Pansy sat on. He observed his surroundings. Crabbe and Goyle sat side by side on giant green beanbags, Blaise and Millicent sat on the love seat together, but not touching, and Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass were sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace. Draco quirked a brow in suspicion.
------------------------------------
So...If you didn't like this, I'm sorry. BUT IF YOU DID, PLEASE COMMENT, SHARE AND LEAVE KUDOS!
"Yes, please. Let's be friends," I breathed, hoping I didn't sound too eager. Draco's eyes widened and he smirked. But it disappeared quickly. He cleared his throat and stuck out his hand.
Love,
I'm writing this letter to tell you how much I...
"Was that a threat?" He yelled while chasing me. I whimpered and ran as fast as I could. But I couldn't help but wonder about Ha-Potter. Why was I turned on by him? Why did I care about what he said? Why was I so hurt by him?
I immediately shook his hand and failed to conceal the giant grin forming on my face. Little sparks shot up my body as our hands connected. Draco's cold and slightly rough hand met my warm hand.
"How do you know my name?" I asked dumbly.
I rose an eyebrow at the blond who was still searching frantically for something.
-------------------------------------
'He probably doesn't know what he's doing.' I chanted over and over again in my head. The signal for the next class did not come soon enough. Soon it was potions. Hermione rushed to find me and stood by me as I gathered up my stuff.
Draco?
------------------------------
The third task was in a few days. I couldn't sleep or breathe. I felt like a pair of eyes was always watching me wherever I went. But whenever I'd search for the eyes, I'd find no one. I shook off the feeling and decided to go flying for a while. It was well past curfew, but I didn't care. I grabbed my broom and snuck out of the dorm; Ron's snoring masking any sound of someone leaving.
I felt my heart leap into my throat. My mind raced in a short panic until I thought of a lie,
-----------------------------
Draco huffed in annoyance and banged his head on the table. He thought about lying and writing how unattractive he is, but he wasn't sure of the consequences that would come from the potion. The quill made scritch scratch noises as he continued writing.
Draco wanted to cry because he knew that what he was writing was how he felt, but he didn't want to admit anything. Sworn enemies. That's all they were destined to be. Both of them were straight so why was Draco even thinking about Harry?
I was having a bad day.
Someone whisper laughed, "Oh my Merlin, it's a bloody ferret." I shouted out, 'help me please, someone' and everyone started laughing at me. I was shocked. My yells were squeaks. Then Moody gripped his wand and pointed it at me. I felt myself being picked up and down. Over and over. I felt humiliated. 'Please help me.' I cried, but cried harder as I saw Potter laughing. Why does this hurt so much?
I felt guilty for laughing and he ran away, Moody right on his tail
"Sod off, Pansy, I'm skipping today," I snapped and shoved my face back down into my pillow.
So....PLEASE TELL ME THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT? :))
I took a deep angry breath to keep me calm.
"And yes, Pansy, I am very jealous. We are 4th years! It's not allowed, even though I really wanted to be part of it. And Potter must've had someone else do it for him. God that bloody git. He and his stupid friends just walk around and get whatever they want. It's like, all Potter does is breathe and '10 points to Gryffindor!'" I exclaimed in a mock of Dumbledore's voice.
