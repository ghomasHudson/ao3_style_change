Something soft and deliciously warm landed across his shoulders, instantly calming the painful shivers that had overtaken him. He turned first, then jumped to his feet. He hadn’t heard the door behind him, and yet Malfoy stood over him, hands still open above him where he’d draped his jacket over Harry’s shoulders. He stood, alarmed, feeling his ears burn.
His heartbeat and breathing couldn’t hide the laughter, nor could it blot out the sloshing footsteps getting closer. Trembling involuntarily, his tired body tried to fight off the cold as he twisted his head around to try and listen. His life could depend on him knowing more.
“World domination?” He laughed with a shake of his head. “Not for me!” He stood up and carried his bowl and spoon to the sink, where he washed it by hand. He left it in the drainer before turning back to Noomi, who had a thoughtful expression on her face. “Are you alright?”
“Is the decoction supposed to cause nausea?” He asked slowly as if his tongue was too fat for his mouth.
He looked up at the stars and smiled. They were the same stars that he’d been able to see from Sweden, and it made him feel better knowing that both he and Draco were being watched over by the same sky. It made him feel slightly closer to home.
Whilst this was partly true, his mind seemed to be flitting between the loss he felt at Ginny’s absence and the unfinished letter sitting on his desk at home destined for a particular pointy blond. The greeting of his letter was both pathetic and stupid, and he knew that Malfoy would roll his eyes and sneer as soon as his eyes danced across the words. He wished he could write the perfect letter, addressing all the things he wanted to say. But, he had never been eloquent, and his handwriting, he knew, was atrocious. His main ambition was to open up communication between them, that and to return the jacket.
The sight of him made Draco smile, and suddenly, the darkening kitchen didn’t seem quite so lonely. He pushed the doodle to one side as he considered his new job role.
“You know, you could always write us a note saying that we’d be in detention.” Victoire pointed out.
Gone was the chubby boy of their youth. Neville was now almost as tall as Ron but not as thin, His shoulders broader and thicker from working in the greenhouses. It was hard to deny that Neville had really grown into a handsome man. The only thing that hadn’t developed so well was his self-esteem. He was still the unsure boy he remembered, nervous to touch or do anything for fear of messing things up.
“Never thought I’d say it, but yes. Surprisingly, I have actually missed the place. Nowhere I’ve visited feels quite like Hogwarts.” Malfoy smiled wistfully as he gazed back at the large front door. Harry watched his face, realising he had never seen that smile before.
“So, is there anything else to do in preparation for the conference?” He asked. If he could keep his mind on work, he could stop the blushing and the embarrassment that threatened to send him back to bed to hide for the rest of the day.
Draco nodded as Rolf returned to his office. He placed his bag on the desk before sitting down. He looked around and noted how most of his co-worker’s heads had turned away to avoid getting caught watching him. He took a deep breath and hoped to get at least some of them to talk to him. He prayed to every deity he could think of, including the boy-who-lived that his day would run smoothly before he started to take out his quill and ink. Maybe he could do this; perhaps he could succeed.
“Heard the kettle and needed coffee.” He muttered dopily as he flopped down into the seat next to him.
“It was blown up during the war. It was next door to Eeylop’s Owl Emporium,” Came a voice from the back room. “I’ll be right out, take a seat,”
“Yeah, the crazy knight that’s always trying to pick a fight?” She nodded and pointed to the lonely corridor where the painting was located.
“It was not the trouble; I saw you coming up from the chalet” She smiled as she struggled to lower herself into the chair opposite, Patrik rushed around to help her. His love for her obvious in the way he smiled at her.
Draco looked back to the open door before facing the concern in Blaise’s dark eyes. Draco didn’t know how to explain what the problem was.
“Nothing. Just noticed that Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins turned up,” Harry muttered as his eyes followed the blond hair through the crowd. “I’m not sure I’d have been brave enough to show up here after everything.” He continued, slightly impressed by the boldness. He caught sight of Hermione shaking her head.
So Malfoy might be gay, and he might have become a decent human being. He felt his heart droop slightly at the thought of spending Sunday alone, going through old stuff to separate, ready for the finalisation of the divorce. Still, he knew that freedom would be his soon. As soon as he passed through the gates, he revealed his wand, and with a crack, he found himself on the top step of Grimmauld place.
Sunday morning, found Draco furiously trying to sort and hang his clothes as he ignored the nervous bile threatening to rise within his throat. The thought of being surrounded by strangers who probably hated him made him feel sick. He took a deep breath as he focused on unpacking some of his suits, his mind wandering to the events of the day before. Blaise was probably back in Italy now; his portkey was due to activate over an hour ago. They’d met up for a muggle coffee in the early hours to bid each other farewell. Draco was sad to see him go; it would be lonely without having a friend.
“Thank you,” Draco offered weakly. He closed his eyes as he rubbed his face with his hands. Relief from the ever-present worry and panic would be heavenly. However, he knew that his conscience wouldn’t let him collect that treatment. He felt it was part of his penitence to suffer for what he had done.
He watched as Molly’s usually warm demeanour seemed dampened at the thought of Malfoy. He couldn’t really blame her. In the war that cost her Fred, Malfoy was on the opposing side. It made him feel awkward thinking his warm and affectionate adoptive mother could be cold and prejudiced against anyone.
“Where have you been?” Harry found himself asking. Malfoy looked at him for a moment, his silvery stare looking like he was considering something.
One of the witches spat on the floor as they walked past, the spittal landing on Draco’s boot. Blaise paused and turned, releasing Draco to turn to the women.
“I’ll leave you two alone for a minute; I could do with a coffee. Anyone want anything?” Blaise asked. Draco opened one eye to scowl at him as he walked towards the door.
He took a deep breath as he tried to extract himself from the memory. He studied the pale marble fireplace and realised that what it represented held more fear for him than staring down a Romanian Longhorn. With that thought, he took a deep breath and swallowed. Taking a handful of Floo powder, he threw it into the fire and called clearly
He scrunched his nose up in disgust. The high ceiling was no long bewitched to reflect the weather outside. Apparently, that enchantment had been lost to the ages. Instead of the cloudy night threatening snow, the new ceiling now depicted scenes from Hogwarts’ battle. The centrepiece “the downfall of Voldemort” could rival the Sistine Chapel in Rome. Each Horcrux had a tableau of equally beautiful and awful imagery surrounding them as the images danced like a kaleidoscope. Riddles diary wrapped in sleek snake-like coils and copper red hair; Salazar Slytherin’s locket, shrouded with trees; Ron stood before it, holding the sword of Gryffindor. Each tableau reawakened an old nightmare as the pictures moved and danced together.
He wondered what cock and bull story it would be tomorrow, wondering whether word of his inevitable divorce had filtered through yet. He closed his eyes, dreading the shit storm that was on the horizon when that little detail got out. He snorted soberly as he considered the spin the Prophet would put on the story. Harry would probably be leaving Ginny to be with Romilda if she could tell her story.
“Yeah, that would be really nice, but I need to get changed and find my wallet… would you mind waiting?”
“Do you wanna come to lunch with us?” He asked. Draco felt a small jolt of shock rocket through his stomach -  he hadn’t been expecting Ron or his friends to go out of their way to include him in their activities. He nodded quickly, despite his surprise.
“Oh, I see,” Luna nodded. “Where is Ginny, by the way? I was looking forward to seeing her,” Luna looked around. Harry looked at Hermione, not knowing what to say.
“Don’t worry, nothing too dangerous,” She assured him. “He’s at the hatching place, mucking out the eggs.” Draco felt the tension leave his shoulders as he began to eat his porridge with more gusto, realising just how hungry he was. Noomi watched him, a smirk on her face. “So, did you have a good birthday?” She asked, raising her cup to her lips, her eyes trained on him.
“Pre-existing condition?” Weasley asked, looking at the Mediwitch. She looked back blankly before Weasley turned his pale eyes to him. “If you don’t mind me asking, Mr Malfoy?”
“The very same.” Blaise nodded. “Lucasta couldn’t help spilling the beans to me the other night about Ginny’s secret lover.”
Lifting his quill to the inkwell and started to read as he tried desperately to forget Draco and their upcoming nuptials. He smiled as he held the feather to his lips. What Draco didn’t know was that he had arranged to surprise Draco tonight. Smiling, he knew Neville was going to cover his rounds this weekend. He focused back to the essay before him and knuckled under, knowing the more marking he did now, the more time he would have with Draco over the weekend.
Harry couldn’t help the eye roll and smirk as he appeared in the doorway, and the children let out a sigh of relief.
“That’s enough of that at the dinner table,” Noomi smirked. Draco’s cheeks turned pink as he smiled.
“WHAT VILLAINS? WHO TRESPASSES UPON MY LANDS? WHO DARES?” The knight spluttered as he tried to pick himself up from the floor, weighted down by his armour. “SCURVY ROGUES!” He shouted into the deserted corridor. Harry stifled a snigger as he heard Filch’s comical footsteps running down the hall.
The years had been good to the Gryffindor, and Draco wondered whether he could say the same about himself. He pulled his stomach in and set his shoulders straighter as he stood back, letting the shorter man work. His salt and pepper hair had been cut short, making it look impeccable compared to the birdnest it had been during their school days. The neat beard at harry’s jaw did cruel things to him as he watched the shorter man move, his shirt and vest pulling against his slender frame. It was good to know that age hadn’t changed him.
“So, where’s Hermione?” Asked Harry changing the subject. Ron noticed and rolled his eyes with a smile before letting the subject switch.
He looked back at the letter before he refolded it and tucked it into his jacket pocket. His stomach growled, reminding him that lunch was ready. He stood and left, the letter virtually forgotten.
The sudden burst of sound and activity seemed to raise his spirits somewhat as he waited for the kettle to boil. From the kitchen, the day looked dark as the low cloud and rain pelted the basement windows. He bit his lip as his mind wandered to the mundane tasks he had to look forward to at work. He felt his eyes roll at the thought of it. He huffed as he dreamed about leaving that job for something else.
“Good Evening, Pep,” Harry muttered to the bird and smiled when the owl chirruped back at him. “I’ve got another letter for Draco Malfoy if you wouldn’t mind taking it, please?”
Shit! Harry cursed inwardly as the blush flooded to his cheeks. He looked away from Malfoy’s eyes and caught Hermione looking at him, a weird expression on her face. His mouth was dry as he put the glass to his lips, realising too late that the remains were mostly ice water. He placed it down, harder than intended, as he felt panic build up in his gut.
Harry shook his head as he gazed down at his glass before taking a swig. “If Ron had cheated on you, could you forgive and forget?” Hermione didn’t even need to think about it before she shook her head.
“Yeah, He ended up with Charlie at the Romanian Dragon Reserve in the end, so we were able to keep good tabs on him there.”
“I’m getting married, but I don’t know much about the details of the day, we’re going on a month-long honeymoon, but I don’t know where to. Is there anything you’re willing to tell me about our special day?” He laughed as Draco moved to reach for some more food.
“Can you point him out to me?” Blaise asked and he and Harry lifted their heads and started looking around the dining hall. Draco looked around as well but couldn’t see the guy so he said no. “Ok,” Blaise said, picking up his fork again, “weird. Let me know if it happens again. I might know those guys.”
Ron chuckled, unsure as well, and offered him a smile, Draco found a smile for him as well and Ron said, “Thanks,” paused, and then added, “know that we know these things about each other, let’s finish the ice cream before it melts.” They two of them leaned forward with their spoons to dig at the container between them. Draco was glad for it, happy that Ron had trusted him with this knowledge and that he got to come out to his new friend without it being weird and strange. Ron seemed more relaxed, which was definitely a good thing, but Draco knew this wasn't and shouldn't be the last time they talked about these types of things.
With that comment setting the tone of the rest of the movie, they continued to watch. Blaise commented on everything, from the second hand embarrassment of Will Turner breaking a piece of the Swan’s house and pretending like he didn’t, to asking whether or not it was actually possible to trap enough air under an upturned boat and use it to walk across the ocean floor, to the stark green-ness of the apple Jack Sparrow was eating casually on a pirate ship. Hermione and Cedric were the only ones who really commented on anything else, and most of them just laughed at all the appropriate parts. Ron noted that Draco seemed to be enjoying himself.
After that, Draco felt that it was probably time he headed back to his room, so he moved his way off of Ron’s bed, grabbing the empty ice cream carton as he went. Ron reached out his hand for Draco to return his spoon and Draco found them later cleaned, lying on a towel next to the sink, drying, while he was brushing his teeth. As he stepped into the shower not long after, he ran the day through his mind. It seemed to have gone on for a long time, the late lunch, the movie marathon, and then the talk with Ron. He felt exhausted as the water ran rivers over his shoulders and down his body, but stable. After some time, he realized how grateful he was to his roommate. In the two days that Draco had returned to college, his new friend had not only trusted him to get to know his friends, but also felt comfortable enough to reveal an aspect of himself to Draco. He recognized that it came from the negative experience Ron had the year before, but he allowed himself a sense of security in Ron opening up to him and then accepting his own admission of queerness.
“Oh, why?” Harry asked before jumping up and towards his computer, “I’m just gonna get some paper and a pen so that you can write things out instead of keeping it all in your head.”
Harry blinked against the light pouring through the windows. It took him a moment to remember where he was. He smiled as he rubbed his eyes. He reached over to the nightstand and felt around for his glasses. His site was getting worse without them. He grimaced at the thought that maybe, after all this time, he should see a healer and see whether there were any possible treatments. He felt the cool, wire rims and opened them up before pulling them onto his face. The room came into focus, and Harry could appreciate the little hut for what it was. It was small and whitewashed, the wooden panelling going from floor to roof. The window sills were natural wood, creating a feature and turning the stunning scenery outside into a framed painting. There were a few knick-knacks around the shack which Harry knew didn’t belong to Draco, but the picture of them together on his desk and the small box of presents by his rucksack, they were all Draco’s.
“Absolutely not! I remember the fifteen-minute lecture you gave me about wanting to fit into your wedding suit. I wouldn’t dream of doing anything that would reign down your wrath upon me.” Harry said in mock innocence.
He didn’t know what he was expecting, but she certainly wasn’t it. Being Swedish, he guessed that he had been expecting the stereotypical blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty that was synonymous of the region but what he saw now was something completely at odds with his expectations that he paused in the doorway.
Draco rested his face in his hands, wishing that the anxiety he felt gurgling away at his solar plexus would disperse but didn’t hold out hope. He let his hands fall into his lap as he closed his eyes. He wished that he had stayed home. He could have avoided the hex and also the catastrophe that was meeting Weasley.
Draco watched in curiosity before he continued. “I went along as part of a Cherokee study group. The main aim was to study their mating habits, protect their habitat, and assess their population stability. Unfortunately, deforestation and Muggle habitation has shrunk their territory considerably.” Rolf nodded eagerly as he waited for more.
“Yes, you did, right before you ran off to find Potter.” Blaise grinned before he arched his eyebrow knowingly, plucking one of the bright green apples from the bowl.
“Yeah sure. They won’t think I’m rude if I’m still unpacking when they’re here, right?” Draco asked and Ron thought he looked rather nervous, but in an ok kind of way.
“Yes, France is wonderful! I’ve been thinking of going to Amsterdam once I take a sabbatical, did you spend some time there?”
“Cool, I’m Harry,” was all the man said, jumping up from his chair behind the desk and walking down a hallway and out of sight. Draco settled down in the armchair, gazing around the room at the different pamphlets and posters that decorated it, all advertising different things about the university. He picked up the school’s literary magazine from the previous year that was sitting on the coffee table near him and leafed through it, taking his time to look over the art and let unfamiliar words wash over him. As he did this, Harry returned to his post and resumed reading whatever he had hidden behind the desk.
Having lost himself in his thoughts, Draco started slightly when he heard a phone ring loudly, cutting through the quietness of the coffee shop. Krum smiled apologetically as he stood to answer his phone and walk out of the building.
“Okay, I’m ready to go,” Krum announced after giving Ron a hug goodbye and a quick kiss on the cheek. Cedric and Harry nodded and Cedric opened the door, sending a “goodnight” over his shoulder as he went. Krum followed him, smiling over at Ron and Draco and held the door open for Harry. Harry grinned over at his best friend and Draco, hefting the bag a little in some sort of solute - Draco wasn’t sure - said, “‘night boys!” and walked through the open door. Krum closed it behind them and then Draco and Ron were left alone in the common space that felt a bit too empty and quiet now that it was just the two of them.
“Oh, Luna, Blaise, um… Ron vaguely and sometimes you too.” Hermione bumped her shoulder with his for emphasis and smirked at him, “I don’t really think he notices that he does it actually, but you two definitely flirt a bit. Maybe if this thing with Cho doesn’t go anywhere, you could try more with Draco.”
“No, I know what they are,” Draco assured him, “I just didn’t realize there was anything special about them.” He gestured towards the card Ron had placed unceremoniously onto the coffee table. “I didn’t even know they had - what? trading cards? - in them. I kind of just figured it was chocolate shaped in a frog mold and that was it. I guess I never saw anyone actually with a chocolate frog before.”
He wasn’t expecting Ron to knock on his door a few minutes later, but he did. Ron apologized for not making sure it was ok with Draco before bringing his boyfriend over for the night and told him Krum would leave in a few hours if Draco wanted. “I know we have our own rooms, but we also share the general space, so I just don’t wanna make you feel uncomfortable or anything.” Ron said as he ran a hand through his red hair. Now that Ron had acknowledged Draco’s ownership over the space, Draco felt a lot better about the whole thing. So he thanked Ron for going out of his way to make him feel more welcome and assured him that he didn’t mind all that much that Krum was around.
“Oooh, friends did you say? Tell me about them,” Pansy demanded, delight and eagerness slipping into her features easily, in a wonderfully practiced manner - Draco delighted in being able to notice. He had a brief desire from a more dramatic group of friends like hers if only to share gossip and experiences, but reminded himself that it was only a small time that he’d known them and there was plenty of time later for drama, though hopefully not too much, but just enough that Pansy would find them interesting. Maybe she would visit and meet them one day, that is, if they remained his friends long enough and if their friendships developed into something close to the relationship that Draco and Pansy shared. These thoughts flashed through his mind as he attempted, once again, to gather his thoughts and figure out the best way to talk to his longest standing friend about all the new people that had entered so recently and so unexpectedly into his life.
As they slowly made their way around the room, the students twisted in their seats to look at people as they talked which was both nice and intimidating at the same time. Some people stumbled through their introductions while others powered through, seemingly used to doing things like this. Draco didn't really think he had anything to show for this summer and so when it was his turn to speak he mumbled out something about giving himself time to relax. He felt slightly undignified declaring his indecision in the case of his major, but was gratified to note that he wasn't the only one. He learned that Harry’s friend was named Oliver Woods and that Harry had gone to a Battle-of-the-Bands type event with Ron and Krum. Oliver’s fun summer fact was his engagement with a local soccer team and placing third in a small tournament. He was most likely one of Cedric’s friends, Draco figured, which was how Harry knew him. Draco’s assumptions were confirmed when he followed Harry and Oliver out of the classroom once Dr. Lupin dismissed the class after skimming quickly over the syllabus and asking if anyone had questions. There were a few, but they didn’t take long for him to answer
“Hey, you’re one of Theo’s friends right?” Theo’s friend asked Draco. Draco just shook his head no. “Oh, I thought you looked familiar and I was going to invite you to sit with us, but ...yeah... Sorry about that.”
“Krum told me on the way here. I think it’s a place called Hog’s Head or something. He said it seemed kind of sketchy but they’ve been having trouble getting booked at the Leaky Cauldron this whole summer.” Ron answered. “I think something happened between Clara and the owner, but Krum didn’t go into details. It would be awesome if we went to see ‘em - it’s been ages.”
“That makes sense. I hadn’t really considered the price of the books before, I forgot how expensive they would be. What’s the site you use?”
After dressing himself in his comfiest but publically acceptable clothes, Draco walked down the front of his home, to where his suitcases, boxes, and bag sat, waiting to be dragged into his car. He exited the mansion and walked to the garage to drive his car to the entrance. As he began to pile his possessions into the trunk, he wondered how much stuff other students would bring and worried about appearing strange, having too much or too little, about what his new roommate would think. He couldn’t remember the amount of things he brought with him to freshman year - it felt like such a long time ago. Thankfully, everything was easy to organize and fit without much effort, except for a few items Draco placed in the backseat of the car.
“Find everything alright?” Ron asked as Draco laid his plates on the table in front of a chair two away from Krum.
“Oh, well I don’t know about Cho, I just met her! And she’s with Luna. I thought maybe we’d hang out a bit, maybe hook up, but nothing serious. With Draco it’s different, I don’t know. I wouldn’t want it to be just a thing.” Here Harry realized how much he actually wanted to talk about this. It had been floating around his brain for a while and it definitely was time to talk it through with someone, and Hermione was such a good option for him. She was perspective and a good listener and knew him so well. He let himself voice as much as he understood, “I like flirting with him, but I don’t think I’ll push for anything more unless I’m more sure of our friendship as a whole and that I won’t lose that if he doesn’t want to be in a different kind of relationship with me. But also,” at this Harry made sure to catch Hermione’s eye so she knew that he was thinking through this seriously, “I’ve only really known him for a little bit more than a month, and I can’t be presumptuous about anything until I know him better and for longer. I just… I don’t know, Hermione, he’s so pretty and interesting and I love being in class with him. I was so happy to see that he was Ron’s roommate because McGonagall even seemed to like him when he came in during the summer and that’s a really good sign. But he’s also kind of quiet and drawn, and pretty anxious, and I don’t want to push him away or anything and I think I would if I made my feelings a bit more clear to him - my feelings, which are, again, only a few weeks old.”
Harry nodded as the Weasley patriarch stood and left him. He glanced up to see Ron and Hermione looking at him.
Harry smiled and ducked his head sheepishly as he sat down. He realised he had been staring. Noomi was cute in the fact that she was pretty but also small and petit. The only things large about her was the white knitted jumper and the size of her pregnant belly. A cup of tea landed before him and another in front of Patrik.
“Have you seen the Prophet recently?” Rolf asked, and Draco shook his head. He didn’t pay any attention to the tabloid unless a certain dark-haired wizard was featured on the cover.
He hated being in this house and how it made him feel. It was as though Voldemort had turned the whole manor into a giant Horcrux. As if the house could influence his thoughts and feelings, pushing him to the brink. Draco knew what a Horcrux was now after reading the notes from the trials and Harry’s testimonies.
“Don’t worry, Scarhead, I’m not here to fight,” Malfoy said, his toned forearms crossed over the flat of his chest.
“You didn’t need to go to all this trouble for me!” He said as he motioned for her to sit down, worried that she might give birth at any second.
“I helped Draco out with some stuff when he visited McGoogly earlier this summer,” Harry grinned and Hermione laughed a little at the name. Draco offered a small smile back, glad that Harry didn’t mention how he had needed help signing up for classes, he didn’t want to seem incompetent to these people he barely knew.
“Cool, I was thinking we could go to Madam Puddifoot’s, I’ve missed it over the summer.” Krum said in response and then after thinking for a moment, “yeah things have changed a bit since last year at least. I think they reorganized the buffet tables and stuff because they added in a second salad bar.”
“Oh, no I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to trivialize your sexuality, I shouldn’t have presumed in the first place, obviously, I mean look at where that got us” but Blaise grinned and waved his hand at him dismissively. “Who’s the girl?” Draco asked, deciding not to press the issue, wondering if it was really ok for him to ask, but pushing forward with the question anyway. Blaise had been forward with him, so why not… he was curious and Blaise could just shrug him off if he wanted to.
Ron looked rather proud at Draco’s words, “yeah, they’re a pretty good group of people, if I do say so myself.”
“True,” Blaise acknowledged after he dropped the other bean-bag chair and then pulled the lawn chair bag off his shoulders so he could open and unfold the chair inside. Ron took the bag and placed in under the coffee table so it wouldn’t get in the way. Harry and Hermione walked out of Draco’s room and sat on the couch, Blaise joined them. Ron made himself comfortable on one of the beanbags and smiled over to his friends.
“Kinda adorable, really. Like in a shy, cute kinda way. He had a butler though, or at least I think the guy helping him move his stuff was some kind of butler, so he’s probably super rich. But he didn’t seem too snobby so,” Ron trailed off and shrugged his shoulders. Krum knew money was sometimes hard for Ron and his family. With the amount of siblings he had, it wasn’t hard to guess the financial strains they were under, especially when Ron wasn’t the only one in college.
Remus and Sirius chatted as they sipped coffee which they were able to get topped off by a server at some point, the time moving past them unnoticed until Sirius was interrupted mid-sentence by a buzzing from his phone - a call this time. He apologized for the interruption and pulled out his phone to answer it, turning head in an attempt at politeness,
Just as Hermione was going to respond, her phone started ringing. When she looked down at it, she saw that is was Blaise and politely excused herself from Draco’s room to answer it.
“Oh, yeah, classic Luna,” Harry said with a grin, “She offers to paint everyone’s book bag. I think Neville is the only one who let her. I thought about it but I usually take my backpack to work and I didn’t want anything outrageous on it - not that I think she would do something outrageous, but you know…”
The moment Draco stepped through the open door to the classroom the knot of worry that had tied itself inside his chest as he power walked his way over unraveled slightly. Dr. Lupin looked over at him with a pleasant welcoming smile as he walked in, Draco tried to offer one in return and wasn’t so confident he managed to do so. Harry wasn’t there yet, so Draco chose a seat towards the middle of the class with empty seats on either side and hoped Harry would get there and choose to sit next to him before someone else did. A minute before class began, Harry walked in talking jovially to a person Draco didn't recognize. He spotted Draco and waved at him enthusiastically - causing Draco to wave back but feel a pull to duck his head self consciously that he squashed down immediately - before directing himself and his friend to sit by Draco. Before Harry’s friend could introduce himself, Dr. Lupin stepped out from behind the desk at the front of the room and caught everyone’s attention. The room quieted as Dr. Lupin began to speak.
“Don’t make fun of me, okay?” She pleaded jokingly when he smiled, “I just like ending the summer with stupid, easy to read mysteries with ridiculous plot holes and conspiracy theories! It makes it easier to start reading all the academic stuff we’ll get assigned soon enough.”
“I don’t know her all that well, actually, but we both recognized each other. It was nice to see a familiar face. Oh but to get back your question, other than the three I already mentioned, I also took an intro to gender and women’s studies, and western civilization 101. I actually think my first semester here was pretty normal. It feels like this one will be similar.”
“Yeah it was,” Draco answered, tucking the blanket more firmly to his body and sat back down on the chair he had occupied earlier.
Puzzling silently at his two companions, Harry forgot to buy half the things he wanted, though looking back on it when he returned to his room, he was glad for - most of the things he had on his list were frivolous and it wouldn’t make sense for him to spend his small amount of hard earned money on things he could easily get from the Great Hall, where he already had a meal plan paid for.
Draco gave himself a moment to turn those words over in his head. He took a deep breath, in through his mouth, out through his nose, and looked down at his hands, which were knitted together in his lap. “I think maybe I’d be interested in kissing you, then,” he said, slowly.
Sirius tapped at his phone to pull up his Hermione chat window when he walked directly into someone else’s path. They two of them collided, in a shocking not painful way, and the person dropped a stack of books and folders on the ground. Apologizing, and going slightly red, Sirius attempted to help, grabbing a folder, several pages that came spilling out of it, and a journal that looked well used.
Going to dinner with them was strange and nice for Draco. He had thought about getting a sweater before they left, but hadn’t wanted to riffle through his suitcases in order to find one he wanted to wear. The Great Hall was warm when they walked in, thankfully, and they went directly to the lines of people waiting to get food, Ron reassured Draco that they would get a table once every had their food. At first the amount of options was overwhelming and Draco found himself missing the food that Mr. Dobby brought him that he hadn’t been required to think about. But the people who worked serving the food were pleasant enough and Draco was able to find the salad bar hidden behind the various buffet tables. Draco filled up two plates easily with chicken and rice and an assortment of vegetables before he started trying to find the people he came in with. He walked slowly through the different sections of seating, checking tables and couch clusters to find a familiar face.  He nervously twisted his head left and right, before he finally saw Ron and Krum sitting at a circular table with an arrangement of empty chairs. When they spotted him as well, Ron waved him over.
“Are you interested in women’s studies?” She decided to ask instead, hoping to get some answers about her other thoughts surrounding this new person in her life. Draco moved onto his last box to unpack which ended up being a tiny refrigerator, smaller even than the one that Hermione and Parvati were sharing this year. It looked like the one her father kept in the basement full of beer and batteries because it was too small to hold anything else.
Ron nodded slightly at him and asked, “Maybe should get to know each other a bit better later, when everyone is gone?”
Draco heard the three people coming down the hall moments before Ron even opened the door. He finished putting one of his posters on the wall before getting down from his bed so he could leave his room and meet Ron’s friends. Ron seemed nice enough. He had been helpful with moving Draco’s things from the car and made sure he was okay with bringing strangers into their shared living space. Theo hadn’t been like that, he rarely said a word to Draco other than a random ‘hello’ every once in awhile. He hadn’t been all that messy but some of his things managed to get into weird places in their dorm - Draco was pretty sure that he still had a few of Theo’s shirts somewhere in his closet, just by accident. Like Draco had told Ms. McGonagall, his last roommate had been fine, not good or bad really. But the fact that Theo would put a sock on the door handle rather than just telling Draco he was going to have someone over was rather annoying.
“Nah it’s fine,” Ron said as he deposited the bean-bag chair in front of the couch, “I mean, we have a couch and two fold-y chairs. I think Draco might also have a chair and you brought three. There are, what, 6 - 7 of us, right? We definitely have enough.”
“We’re having a movie marathon, we need all the sustenance we can get,” Cedric said seriously, patting Blaise heavily on the shoulder, “also, the left-overs are gonna be amazing!” Blaise laughed up him but raise a butterbeer bottle off the coffee table in mock salute.
“Yeah, seems like it. And her bag was amazing - have you seen it? Well I’m sure you have but it’s painted like an octopus and she offered to paint mine.”
It didn’t take long for them to slot their mouths together and lend themselves over to the warmth and familiarity of their bodies. One of Ron’s hands held that back of Krum’s head, fingers sinking into his hair. They barely came up for air.
“Hey,” Draco began sheepishly, “you said you did well with stat before, right? I was wondering if you could help me with some of the problems on my study guide. There are a few things I’m having some trouble with.”
Harry just smirked at her and crossed his hands over his chest, “I’d take the Host over any Dan Brown book any day.”
“Definitely true in some regards. Hmm, well, first of all, I'm sure none of us think it’s weird that you and Blaise made out! It is a relatively normal thing that happens for us. For Blaise specifically, he really likes
“Good. I’m glad Mr. Potter was a resource for you.” She said as turned towards her desktop computer, “I have already granted you access to complete the final step in the online portal so you can officially enroll in your classes.” Draco nodded at those words and followed her instructions, clicking the buttons on the screen in front of him to complete the process. When it was done, he looked up at her. She was leaning across the desk with his cookie jar open and an expectant look in her eyes. “Take a cookie, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Sounds good and let’s do that for the common area too, just like keeping it as non-messy as possible.” Ron allowed, and Draco felt a tiny bit of tension in his shoulders slip away. It seemed like Ron wasn’t put off by Draco’s want to keep their dorm tidy. He added, “tonight was good with the trash bag and everything, it really wasn’t that bad at all,” to which Draco inclined his head in agreement and reached out to spoon another mouthful of ice-cream from the container in between of them.
“It was a few months after she started going to my school, in 10th grade. I think we dated for about a year maybe, probably a little less.”
“Yeah, see you.” Draco said, and waved awkwardly over his shoulder, before heading through the glass doors to the outside world, taking a second bite out of the soft chocolate chip cookie as he did.
“Yeah, can you guys let me up?” Blaise said through the phone; Hermione could hear movement and voices around him and she pictured him in the Prefect lobby, watching as other students rushed by.
“Yeah, they applied for a room together at the end of last semester,” Ron replied as he and his two friends entered the common area, “I mean you know we talked about me and him moving in together, but I think it’s better this way.”
Krum leaned down a placed a dry kiss on Ron’s belly button again, “sure, baby.” His hand was now flat against Ron’s center, finger-tips teasingly tapping lightly on the hardening nub. “Is this still ok?”
[from PP 2:13] the minifridge’s making weird sounds and I’m going to call maintenance - jsyk. Will update you later
Hermione wondered for a moment about Draco’s sexuality because the way he acted with Tonks and what he was saying about his friend Pansy pointed to him being straight. But the fact that he was taking a queer history class didn’t seem like something a straight guy would do except for gen-ed requirements or something like that. So she thought maybe he might be bi. It was a bit weird, trying to figure out someone’s sexuality that she barely knew but it wasn’t like she didn’t do that all the time. Or that other people didn’t do all the time. Hermione had always been the token straight friend so it wasn’t a rare thing for her or her friends to talk about sexuality because they were always so open about their preferences and experiences. In her own experience, straight people were usually more guarded about their sexuality, because they assumed that everyone was straight and it wasn’t something they needed to talk about and it wasn’t a problem for them, a privilege her non-straight and non-cis friends didn’t have. It was something she learned early on when she met Ron and Harry but didn’t realize was a thing until she had her a short-lived boyfriend in eleventh grade who wasn’t interested or comfortable in discussing sexuality and sex the same way she was. Hermione didn’t want to assume anything about this new addition to the group, though, but she did wonder. It might be nice to have another straight person around who was aware of these things. Lavender was nice, but she didn’t get as along well with Ron and Harry as Hermione had hoped. But she recognized that Draco could very well be queer, just because he mentioned a girl and flirted with Tonks didn’t really say anything about him. Harry tended to flirt with anyone without even realizing it and he was always quick to announce how astoundingly gay he was. It was nice to think about, though, having a straight friend who would understand but Hermione didn’t want to get her hopes up, not that she would be all that disappointed if Draco turned out not to be straight….
“Well, we received your forms and everything seems to be in order. I reviewed it all before this meeting,” She said and motioned to a small stack of papers on her desk. “Unless you have concerns or questions, the only thing you have left to do is enroll in classes for this semester. It is a bit late, so there might not be as many choices are you would like, but I am positive you will be able to find classes you want. Worst comes to worst, you’ll have to put yourself on a waiting list for a class, but that’s not a bad option, really. Did you have any questions?”
“You do too,” Draco replied as Harry walked loudly through the door with Krum and Cedric behind him. Ron’s eyes immediately jumped to his boyfriend as he came into the room. He beckoned the man over with a wave of his hand, but Krum moved to put the bags he was carrying down on the coffee table first.
Pansy came on screen looking as polished and beautiful as ever, a full face of makeup and grace that he so much appreciated. Of course, they had not always gotten along, but he didn’t ever think he’d tire of looking at her face, made-up or not, the symmetry of it and the clearness of it and the way it was able to hide and control her emotions so completely. He let his eyes move over the image of her face on his screen for a second before offering a small smile and raising his hand in greeting. She returned it and asked him how his first week was.
[from KnowItAll 2:04] Ron tell Harry that he doesn’t have to text you because we’re going to see you in like TWO minutes. You two can not be this codependent istg
“We’ll figure it out! Or we’ll just have a stupidly long movie marathon. Either way, we can order in food or something.”
He shook his head as his hands drifted to Harry’s trousers and started to pop the buttons at his fly. Harry moved to his shoulder, scraping teeth across his skin. Draco shuddered as they both sank to the pillows that Harry had arranged. Their clothes were gone in seconds as Harry slowly worked him open, milking him for every filthy sound he could make as he cock grew rigid.
“I am,” She nodded, “I think I am frustrated with the being housebound. I hate not being able to do things,” She huffed. “I want to meet our little one. I am impatient.”
Harry nodded as he stood. He bent to grab his bowl, but it was whisked away as if taken by a gust of wind. He snorted as he saw Noomi grin at him, her wand out.
His thoughts drifted back to Weasley and the hospital. What could he possibly know about him? He found his mind drifting back to Charlie and his long hair and green eyes. They were the wrong type of green, though. He’d often thought it; The green of dragon scales or seaweed. He’d caught himself so many times wishing that they were brighter, like sunlight through leaves or shimmering emeralds, and every time, he slapped himself down for wanting to change him. He closed his eyes to banish the thoughts of Charlie and the hurt that came with it. He would not waste his Sunday thinking about what could have been.
“No reply?” Harry repeated with a frown. He sat back down and ran his hand through his hair, pulling at it gently as he refused to acknowledge the sense of disappointment niggling away in his chest. Malfoy would’ve turned his nose up at the lack of greeting, but he thought that the promise of getting his jacket back would ensure a reply.
Draco spun out onto the gravel floor, tripping as his thoughts distracting his feet. He caught himself before he could muddy his clothes, biting back his attack, not secure enough to let loose the tsunami of emotions yet. His precariously built mental walls were crumbling at the base as he strode up the drive, head down to keep out the cold. His head spun as the apparition crack continued to ricochet around the manor grounds. How he hadn’t splinched himself was a miracle. He could feel the Scottish snow melting into his hair. He glanced up at the sky as he tried to distract himself. The snow clouds hadn’t travelled this far south yet, leaving the skies clear and stars visible, and the moon bright. Draco shivered before resigning himself to his return to the manor.
Blaise raised a knowing eyebrow and smirked before he leant closer. “If what Lucasta Lloyd told me is correct, it’s not strange at all!” He whispered conspiratorially.
He slowly pulled on his clothes, settling for something a bit more muggle. He pulled his black jeans on and then reached for the top he’d packed. He’d complained to Harry when He’d purchased it, saying that no one wanted to walk around like a billboard for a band no one knew but secretly, it was his favourite shirt. It was a grey, mottled cotton t-shirt with ‘the cure” written in scratchy writing and the lead singer's silhouette and guitar. Draco had secretly fallen in love with the muggle band, something which Harry had found very endearing. Harry had even gone as far as buying himself a ‘Poison’ t-shirt that he only wore when they went out together. Harry found it hilarious when his t-shirt read ‘Poison’ and Draco’s read, ‘the Cure.’
The office was just as dim as he’d left it, the pile of books waiting for him to finish marking.  He was happy to say that the marked stack was larger than the unmarked, but he still had lots to do. He raised his hands, removed his glasses and rubbed at his eyes. Casting his mind over the next day’s events, he decided that he could probably get away with marking the books tomorrow. Being the last full week, He decided to call it a night.
“As I was saying, It appears that you were attacked and struck with a rather nasty variation of the Somnus delorum hex, which included confundus-like symptoms. I have just administered a general decoction of cornflower and snowdrop for the cloudy eye complaint and the confusion. There may be some lingering dizziness. However, we should be able to discharge you within the next hour or so. Do you understand?”
“I was going to try somewhere muggle, but no one in the wizarding world would think that Draco Malfoy would wear muggle clothes, so I think we can get away with trying out ‘Tre e Viverna’”
Harry stepped out of the shower, feeling refreshed after a long day of manual work. He caught sight of himself in the mirror and paused to look. His stomach looked slightly less soft than it had. However, there was definitely some muscle definition appearing on his arms on chest. He nodded in satisfaction; It was nice to know that the hard work was paying off; he just wished there were fewer scars. He sighed as he turned away from the mirror and the reminders of the war.
“You’re welcome, Malfoy, although I never expected your gratitude,” He replied finally, “I’m glad that you’ve been able to use the freedom. It looks like you’ve used it well.” Harry felt like the words were clumsy, but Malfoy smiled anyway.
Ginny and he were trying to rebuild their own lives in the wake of Fred’s death, and the tabloids frayed already tense nerves. Although he had often felt Gin’s eyes linger on him slightly longer than usual after a new article was published as though she was watching for signs of duplicity. Eventually, the horrid pieces became just another noise in the background of their life.
“Great class, Uncle Harry,” Said Louis with a grin. His pale ginger hair, hanging around his shoulders in an ‘intentionally-dishevelled’ look. Harry knew it was down to Fleur’s Veela genes, but the kid always looked great and knew that the girls would love him as he grew. Roxanne’s dark hair was pulled back into a bushy ponytail at the nape of her neck, giving her a no-nonsense air.  Lucy reminded Harry so much of her dad, Percy Weasley, but thought that it was lucky that she seemed to take more after her mother. The other Weasley’s certainly were good influences on her and her sister.
“Shacklebolt?” Draco repeated. “Kingsley Shaklebolt?” Draco shook his head. “Minister for Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt?” Draco seemed unable to close his mouth. When Harry said that he’d pulled rank, he meant it. He had gone all the way to the top.
“Good lesson, everyone! I have a very good feeling about all of you for your exam next week. Now, remember, refresh your memories on all the creatures we’ve covered and also their corresponding jinx’s, If anyone feels like they need any more help,  my office is open all day Tuesday as the 7th years will be sitting their N.E.W.T’s.” He turned and moved behind his desk as he picked up his book with the homework in “Now, to help your revision, I have marked the homework you handed to me yesterday, please come to the front and collect your papers.” He held them out as he started to call out his students names.
Draco felt his mouth dry out, and his eyes water. He opened his mouth to say thank you when the snitch started to open. Draco watched it as he swallowed. Inside was a small golden heart with a garnet set in the centre. Draco tore his eyes away from it to Harry, who smiled indulgently. “Oh, Harry, It’s beautiful” He croaked, his voice betraying how touched he was.
“Well, as I was saying, you will be the head of this investigation working alongside another member of staff, Ms Cosima Prewitt. Unfortunately, she is on annual leave until after the Christmas period; however, we can really knuckle down when she returns. So, unless you have any other questions, I’ll show you to your desk and introduce you to the team?” Rolf smiled as he slid his legs off the desk and stood up.
She began to slowly pull him away from the hatchery with its smoking chimney to a distant shed. He flicked her wand at the white, wooden doors and watched as it swung slowly open. “Come inside,” she motioned as Draco let her go.
“Maybe. Shame Harry doesn’t play anymore; he was also a sight to behold. Utterly fearless; And always quite fetching in his Quidditch robes. Although I must admit, I always preferred the white trousers to the later grey ones.” Blaise reminisced with a playful glance towards Draco. He scowled, which caused Blaise to chuckle. “Draco, dear. That look hasn’t worked on me since second year. Also, you can’t tell me that you don’t agree.”
He felt around for his glasses before pushing them on, feeling the familiar relief of being able to see again. The room looked like a colour-blind house-elf had stolen all the discarded 80’s decorations and had distributed them unevenly throughout the lower floors of his house. It gave him a headache to look at it all. He could’ve sworn that Ted hadn’t put up quite so much the day before, but then his mind had been elsewhere.
“And no tiny details about flowers or food, that’s cheating!” Harry warned. Draco smirked and rolled his eyes.
He felt a hand on his other arm before he felt the familiar pull from behind his navel. He felt sick as they landed.
“Well they sounded pretty interesting when you described them last night. I’m mostly taking gen-eds this semester to get them out of the way since I have a better idea now what I want to be studying in the long run.” Hermione watched as Draco re-folded the last of his clothes from his suitcase into the bottom-most drawer of his dresser. “Do you have many gen-eds left?”
“Well, not many people do, but I love it. Not as much as my mom, though. She’s over the moon that I’ve invested energy in my Jewish heritage.”
“No, I don’t have any other questions,” Draco replied slowly before reaching up to the open jar and taking another cookie. “Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to me. This has been very helpful.”
Ron nodded seriously at him and reached forward to get a bit of ice-cream for himself. “I guess we can start by talking about the space, like how we want to share it, you know? I’ve never had a dorm with a single before.”
“Yes, that’s fine, I like them,” was the answer he got, so Blaise bit and sucked at Draco’s neck with relish, enjoying the soft sighs that he made. Draco clutched at Blaise in response, grasping at his friend and urging him to continue. Once he was sure Blaise had done good work on Draco’s neck, he pulled the man back up so to recapture his lips, returning to them with an enthusiastic and rather wet kiss.
“Cool. I’m hoping that the classes I’m taking this semester will help me figure that kind of stuff out.”
“Yeah. And, um he/him pronouns for me,” Draco said quickly, making sure that he answered the question. She nodded to him.
“So Draco,” Blaise called from across the table, effectively cutting into the other conversations that were happening, “tell us what classes you’re taking. I wanna see if we have anything together.” Draco blushed slightly under the attention, but managed to give an answer without embarrassing himself.
“Yeah, well every time it’s a bit different for me.” Ron replied, and Draco was relieved that his roommate didn’t focus on the mention of his parents - it was refreshing. “My family was pretty easy actually. It wasn’t until high school that I really met people who made things difficult. This kind of reminds me about when I talked to Hermione about my gender for the first time. Though, we were hanging out and eating frosting and pretzels instead of ice cream.” Ron thought for a second, “It was right after I asked her out, like on a date. I think she already knew, and we’d been friends at that point for a few months, but she was great about it...”
“Yeah that would be nice! Mom left me a few boxes of microwave popcorn and we could stop by Honeydukes on the way back to get snacks,” Ron said and then looked over at Draco, “if you’re okay with that, of course.”
“Did we really? I just. Wow, I didn’t realize. I don’t think I actually know how to flirt or when I do it...” Draco heard himself talking, spilling out the rambling insecure thoughts, he stopped himself before he said anything stupid.
“Yeah, definitely,” Harry said, and then looked like he was going to say something else, but was interrupted by Hermione telling the room that fifteen minutes were up and it was time to get down to business once more. Harry and Draco shared another amused smile and turn to their respective studying.
Ron looked at his two friends, his head moving from left to right, “I missed you guys - I mean, you both. I’ve been trying to get into the habit of not using gendered language,” he said all in a rush and they beamed back at him, “but you know, it’s kinda tough.” And they nodded sagely back. The three of them stood in companionable silence as they watched the numbers move from (2) to (3) “Well aren’t you going to say anything?” Ron asked, as the elevator doors slid open again.
Harry dropped into a chair suddenly next to Draco, causing him to flinch away from the sudden movement.
“I’m Draco and I also use he/him,” Draco said, “it’s nice to meet you.” He looked around out the four people in the room, “it’s nice to meet all of you, honestly. It’ll be nice to start the semester knowing some people.” Especially people who didn’t seem like assholes and were surprisingly (to Draco at least) somewhat gender inclusive. He hadn’t ever shared his pgps outside of a classroom environment, admittedly only one class, and it was interesting to see it normalized to the degree of everyday conversation.
When Ron said he had friends coming over, Draco hadn’t entertained the idea that he would recognize any of them, but the moment he stepped out of his room to say hello, his eyes landed on the curly haired boy - Harry - who had helped him out at the administration building.
Later, when the conversation split again and everyone was talking to the people next to them, Draco turned to Hermione who was starting to eat her dessert, having to talk around Harry who was between them, and asked, “so do you guys know each other from before college? because it seems like you all know each other really well.” She seemed like a person who would answer his question honestly and without judgement, so he figured she would be the best person to ask. Hermione hummed around a spoonful of icecream cake.
“Ok, fifteen-minute break! Get some snacks, stretch, walk around, go to the bathroom. Then we’ll start again. Dean, glad to see you could make it.”
After Krum finished unloading all of his bags and some of Cedric’s he came over with a butterbeer and a chocolate bar to Ron who wiggled to the side of the bean-bag so Krum could climb in with him. Ron moved so his head was resting on Krum shoulder and their legs tangled a bit in front of them. Krum kissed him in the side of the head and asked, “So what are we watching first?” He twisted off the cap of the butterbeer bottle and offered it to Ron who sipped at it happily.
“I guess we didn’t really need all the extra chairs, did we?” Blaise said, eyeing the two empty chairs (one Ron’s and one the folding one he brought).
“It’s totally fine if you don’t want to,” Blaise said, brightly, “just seemed like you might be into it.”
“Oh, Draco,” Pansy sighed, even through her emotional mask, Draco knew that expression and how much she wished they were in the same place so she could play with his hair or give him a hug or just be in the same
Blaise gave him a moment to continue speaking, before pressing on himself. “Okay, I’ll take my apology back, though I
With midterms coming up and also Fall break to worry about, Draco was experiencing a growing level of anxiety. He knew that Pansy wasn’t going to be coming in to town for her break, so he had to decide if he wanted to spend it back at the Manor with Mr. Dobby by himself, or stick it out at Hogwarts, also by himself. He and the butler chatted over the phone every once in a while and, in this case, Mr. Dobby reassured him that he just needed to know a day or so in advance to prepare some parts of the house if Draco was indeed coming for an extended weekend. Midterms were a whole separate can of worms, and Draco knew he was stressing himself out and affecting the people around him. He worried since he hadn’t been a student in quite some time and he did not want to do poorly, now that he had committed himself. It wasn’t that he thought he would necessarily fail his exams or papers, but the effort required to study for tests and the research that needed to be done for papers… It felt like a lot and he didn’t want to do anything wrong.
Ron hummed around his spoon before saying, “yeah that would be awesome. Do you need help moving it?”
Eventually, Blaise deepened the kiss, pressing at Draco’s mouth a bit more intensely and bringing his tongue into the mix. Draco chased after it with his own and raised a hand to Blaise’s chest, clutching at the fabric of his shirt as the two of them kissed with more vigor. Blaise brought his free hand to Draco’s side, just below his ribcage. Draco tilted his head in response, pushing himself more enthusiastically into their embrace and feeling at the warmth emanating from below Blaise’s shirt. Blaise pulled back in order to bite and tug playfully at Draco’s lips, bringing more blood to the surface of the thin skin there. From the sounds that Draco make, he surmised that the blonde man liked that and further descended upon him with his teeth, but not before kissing those swollen lips. Blaise kissed and nipped his way to Draco’s jaw and then to his neck. He paused, lips against the fair skin there, licking it lightly, causing Draco to shiver, and asked if Draco wouldn’t mind a few hickies, his breath perfect and hot, lips fluttering against skin.
Draco grimaced at his own indecision, “I haven’t decided, but I’ll probably just stay here in the end - I mean I could go home, but it’s been nice to be away the past two months. What are you doing?”
In the end, he lent himself to pleasure and came, coating his lower stomach with his orgasm, choosing to breathe through his nose so as not to make any distinctive sounds, more for his own benefit than his roommates. He often found his own noises of pleasure to be rather boring and unattractive and usually did not let himself make all that much sound when jacking off, regardless of how alone he might be. Sighing at the cooling mess on his stomach, Draco reached up and grabbed a tissue from the box he left conveniently close to his bed. He cleaned himself off and decided to take a shower before eating a snack and getting ready for his video call with Pansy. He took his time with his assigned tasks, just as he had with his body, letting the new routine of this living situation pour into his bones and guide his movements. He wanted to be as relaxed as possible when talking to his closest friend but he also wanted to enjoy the nothingness of the time that he had before they talked. In that regard, he hummed as he showered, barely realizing it until it seemed too late to stop - if Ron was around and had been listening - not that Ron would have cared, probably, but for Draco’s own feelings of embarrassment at the idea of someone listening to him hum and then noticing him stopping to do so - all of it was ridiculous of course, because who would care about any of it - but Draco let these thoughts steep in his brain as he washed out the shampoo from his hair, almost grateful for his own internalized embarrassment because of how normal it was for him to feel this way about himself.
“Not appropriate, Blaise!” Draco warned. Blaise had seen it all before. They had shared dorms, after all. One of the reasons that Blaise was as popular as he claimed was because of what he could bring to the bedroom. Draco fought the urge to blush and succeeded.
“Lucasta Lloyd introduced me to the place, a most accommodating woman, I must say.” Blaise smiled as he held his wine in place on the table, his tall, lean body lounging on the chair. Draco had always thought that Blaise was one of the most naturally stunning men he had ever seen, and his grace and attitude only added to his mystique.
Short version... Pansy tried to get Draco killed as well as throwing obstacles in their way at every turn. If you want to know more, I suggest you go read it ;) ;) ;)
Someone converted to Muggles big time. Looking good, D!” He watched as Blaise’s gaze travelled down to his black boots and back up again and nodded his approval. He gave the barest smile as he grabbed his scarf.
He felt a strong pair of hands around his waist and a warm body behind him. He jumped and tried to turn around, but the hands held him steady.
Harry listened intently, knowing how it felt to be frozen to your broom. He thought for a moment about his extraction from four Privet Drive and his agonising flight on his broom.
“I managed to incapacitate the ladies and confiscate their wands after Draco collapsed, which was only a few moments before you arrived. You know the rest.” Blaise finished.
“Don’t try that with me, Fred. I knew your dad and uncle in school. It’s the ‘Or anything’ I’m worried about.”
“Since school, started training right after the war,” He nodded. “What about you? Heard you’re working at the Governo Magico these days.”
“Fine!” He repeated. “We are going to more than one place for our honeymoon, and before you say.” He held a hand up as Harry opened his mouth to protest “That’s cheating too, one of the places is in France.”
Standing in the doorway of his room, he stared slack-jawed and overwhelmed. When Kreacher had disappeared, he hadn’t dreamed that the little fiend could be upstairs vandalising his bedroom with the tawdry decorations. It looked like a tinsel monster had decided to turn his bedroom into a nest. Blue and red rows of thick bushy tinsel dangled from his four-poster bed, while green and purple hung from the picture frames.
There was a long corridor off to the left, which read ‘Containment & Examination’ He glanced down the hallway before weaving his way towards the office. There were only a couple of other people in the room, but their eyes followed him as he walked by. He nodded solemnly to them in the hopes to start on the right foot. When they didn’t reply or acknowledge him, he sighed and continued to the end. He raised his hand to knock on the door when it swung open before his skin could make contact.
“I’m sure that if you chose to do anything to me, I could stop you if I wanted to,” Harry replied, feeling a blush rise in his chilled cheeks. He hoped that the cold disguised the gesture. He watched as Malfoy hesitantly brought his hand up to meet his. As their skin touched, Harry was surprised at how rough his skin was and how firm the handshake felt. Malfoy’s skin was cold; his long thin fingers curled around his own gently as warmth built slowly between them.
Harry sipped his barely cold coffee before answering, using the action to buy him time to prepare. He knew he was not going to like this question.  He placed his cup down before he nodded slowly.
“Firstly, I guess, we could rent out a nice place and have flowers everywhere, we could invite a few more people.” He paused, “I don’t know. Now that I’m saying it out loud, I guess nothing would be different. We’re already inviting all of our family and friends. We’re already holding it somewhere close to home?” He phrased it as a question, hoping to get more information, but Draco remained silent, so he continued “I guess there isn’t really much difference.”
“Not for lack of trying!” Harry snorted “They’re a resilient bunch, remind me of me as a kid.” He chuckled.
“I am an Auror, Harry!” Ron scoffed again, “We tend to keep tabs on ex-death eaters and other Voldemort cronies.”
“I wish I didn’t have to leave, but one more week and you’ll be home,” Harry smiled encouragingly as he gently kissed the blond again.
“Even if I were as straight as an arrow, I don’t think I would ever consider it.” Draco sneered. If he was honest with himself, he had considered it, on many occasions but not in the same way as Blaise. He often wondered what Harry saw in her. What made Harry groan in the dark.
He sighed and closed his eyes, letting his head fall and rest on the back of the sofa. He tried to ignore the flashing lights of the muggle fairy lights, which Teddy had insisted on putting on the Christmas tree. He opened his eyes and looked at the tree. Unable to see anything but flashing, blurry red and green bubbles without his glasses, he could make out the outline of the tree.
The wooden door swung open as Patrik stepped in. He smiled, bright white teeth flashing between his lips.
“Hi, Yeah, I’m Harry. Good to meet you, Patrik. I’ve heard lots of things about you and what you do here.” He smiled as he offered his hand.
Eventually, one arrived, and he stepped on. He turned around, waiting for the people around him to clamber on and press in around him. Instead, he looked up to see a group of them glaring hostilely at him, refusing to share the same space. He felt his heart in his chest as he waited for the lift to close. Slowly the golden gate pulled shut, and the disembodied voice of a woman began to speak.  Draco suddenly jumped as a hand pushed through the lift doors, holding it open and stopping Draco’s escape.
Draco pulled the shirt over his head and proceeded to remember Harry making them dance around their kitchen as he sang, ‘talk dirty to me.’ Draco felt the laugh tumble out of his mouth in the silence of the chalet. It was one of his favourite memories. Harry had been cooking a Sunday roast dinner, and Draco had been fussing over something. He couldn’t remember what now, something inconsequential, no doubt. Harry had taken the opportunity to grab Draco and spin him around the kitchen and dining room, singing the song word for word. Draco had blushed and laughed so hard as he’d tried to escape from his awful muggle dancing.
“So you both finally went through with the divorce?” Ted asked calmly. Hary felt his heart stop as he looked at the lanky teen in front of him.
The cold rush up his spine, and the shiver within his soul told him he hadn’t finished. He stayed at the sink and waited for his body to be done with him. He wanted to rest, to float away on sleep and perhaps never return. Another wave forced thoughts from his mind as the fire whiskey followed. He thought about finally walking the stairs to bed, but he couldn’t. The kitchen was the only space in the whole manor that he had never seen the other death eaters or the dark lord. A house-elf’s domain was below notice. Draco liked it down here.
“Stop freaking out,” Blaise said kindly as he pushed the cup into his trembling hands. “What’s going on in that head of yours?”
Ron opened his mouth to say something, confusion on his face. There was a bang as he jumped. He grimaced
Harry felt a blush rise in his cheeks as he looked into the bowl. It looked like porridge, but the oats were rounder, and she had sliced apple on top. He took a tentative spoonful and after tasting the cinnamon and honey, decided he liked it very much.
“Happy Birthday to you…” Crooned from the fireplace swiftly after the woosh. Draco found himself smiling as he waited for Harry to finish, a warm blush rising in his cheeks. He turned from his desk to see Harry's head hovering in the fireplace and just seeing his face made his insides warm.
He looked at the green jacket which hung from a hanger on the wall. He wanted to return it to stop looking at it and visualising the blond in it. But, the more he looked at it, the more he tried to decern the hidden machinations behind Malfoy’s actions. Surely, he couldn’t have done it for the reasons he’d said, could he? He pulled at his hair again before forcing his eyes away from the jacket.
Between all the battles, curses general neither were able to produce. Their relationship bombed. Both mourned in their own ways, pulling away from each other. Each secretly blaming the other for their infertility. He guessed that it was this that had spurred her on to excel in her career, family no longer being a possibility.
“That doesn’t even sound like me. You just invited yourself around so that you could gossip and give me a heart attack at the same time.”
He shrugged before knocking the cool liquid back. The urge to gag coming almost immediately, but he managed to swallow through it, consuming the coagulated slime. The taste was at odds with the potions consistency; he could taste the peppermint, first and foremost. However, there were subtle underlying flavours he could detect, such as Feverfew, hops, and Betony. The Betony was hardly surprising as Blaise had provided it.
Draco’s whole body trembled as he sat on the edge of the bed, gathering his thoughts. He’d slept fitfully, tossing and turning as the hours dragged by like seconds caught in quicksand. He’d even resorted to sipping one of his prescribed anxiety potions. It stilled the humming nerves long enough for him to drift off, only to jump awake again as nightmares resurfaced. So he sat, panting in a pool of sweat as he rubbed his tired face. The usual horrors of the war now included being hexed at the restaurant. He scrambled to find the picture of Harry in his notebook in a bid to calm down. Seeing his laughing face eased something inside. He knew it was ridiculous, but he clung to the drawing like a drowning man.
He paused, recalling the first moment the Healer had told them that they would never conceive. He remembered the reverberating silence in that small office, like a stone thrown into a well, waiting for it to hit the water.
“Yes, darling boy. It’s just been a long time, and things were so very different before.” He said, avoiding Scorpius’s intrusive gaze.
“We’re both adults, Ted. He can owl you if he wants to. In fact, I’d love to see some of those postcards.”
“Thought we could ask the elves for some ice cream, but they’ve all gone to bed.” Teddy shrugged. “So we were going to chat and stuff for a bit before going back to our common rooms.”
“Mi, we’ve not seen him in fifteen years. So I don’t think we can say that we know his character anymore.” Draco closed his mouth as Weasley flashed him a slight smirk.
“I’m planning the whole thing. If you think I’m skimping on anything I want, you don’t know me very well.” They both chuckled before Draco carried on “If we did a huge wedding next year, what would be different?” Draco asked, trying to ignore his nerves.
He studied one of the newest outfits he’d recently acquired, hanging from a nearby bookshelf. The pale blue shirt complimented the navy blue trousers and looked great with the new brown shoes he’d paired with the ensemble. But the more he looked, the more he knew that his missing green jacket would’ve set it off beautifully.
“A journalist apparently, One of the ‘Seeker Weekly’ or ‘Which Broom’ lot. Apparently, they’ve been leaving the training grounds together more often than not.” Draco covered his mouth in horror.
“Zabini made a citizen’s arrest. She and her friend were floating mid-air in a body bind jinx when I got there. If Malfoy hadn’t been writhing on the floor, it would’ve been funny.”
“About last night” Harry started putting his spoon down and looking between them, “Thank you so much for letting me stay and helping me arrange the surprise.”
“That’s rough. I’m sorry you missed it. It would’ve been great to have you there. I thought that… you know… You and Pansy haven’t always seen eye to eye…”
“Must be nice to have the freedom,” Harry replied bitterly. He closed his eyes, immediately regretting the comment. He knew, without a doubt, that he was not in the right frame of mind for this conversation. He glanced at Malfoy and saw the surprised look on his face. Harry sighed and closed his eyes again. He’d not meant to reference the war or the trials.  It was an unwritten rule, but he had accidentally broken it. He had wanted to go travelling so many times, but Ginny’s schedule hadn’t allowed for it. In all his years, the only travelling he had ever done had been when he’d fled to find Horcruxes. He rubbed his face tiredly. “Sorry, I didn’t-“
“I’m sure it took almost Gryffindor levels of courage to come.” Hermione agreed. “It’s been years, though, Harry. Most of them are upstanding members of society now. I’m not sure what Malfoy and some of the others have been up to, but I heard that Zabini is some star Auror in Italy now.” Nodding with interest, he watched the pair leaning together against the far wall. Blaise said something, and the other Slytherin laughed in response.
“I have never been better!” He nodded with a smile “I’m just trying to remind myself that this is real and that I deserve it,”
Hermione’s eyes widened, “Can he see? I’ve had so many cases come across my desk where the recipient has gone permanently blind.”
There was a moment of silence around the table. Harry felt a wave of guilt at the mention of Neville and his new wife. It had been a surprise to them all when the unlikely pair had gotten married, and it was still unclear whether it was a pureblood marriage contract or a love match.
Some of the women at the office had told him he’d be a silver fox by the time he was forty. He laughed it off. He ran a hand through his salt and pepper hair as he scanned the crowd for Ron or Hermione, suddenly aware of just how lonely he was. There were couples dotted around, talking and flirting, but he was very much alone. He didn’t do well on his own, according to Hermione anyway. He thought he did alright, but she always knew best.
Draco nodded slowly, wondering why he wasn’t able to form a complete sentence. Two pairs of hands pulled him up into a sitting position before leaning him against something.
“Ugh, Don’t tell me that you’ve finally bought into the myth,” Harry asked, ready to feel disgusted. Malfoy’s face changed as his eyes rose from their clasped hands to his lips and then his eyes. His heart fluttered, wondering if Malfoy felt what he did.
Draco shrugged. “I’m not entirely sure. We were talking about family, and I told him I was going to leave before the Weasleys could accuse me of doing anything to him when he offered his hand.”
The headlines had led to a family meeting. He hadn’t been able to look Molly in the eye for months after, the embarrassment too much. He’d vowed never to do that again. He knew Ted was right.
“Ah” replied Patrik. “I will leave you to speak with your Hem Nisse. Come down when you are finished” He smiled as he left the room, closing the door behind him.
“I would hardly think that you would know anything about my character as I’ve not seen a hair from your copper head in neigh on 15 years.” He hadn’t resorted to insults. He was proud of that; And to think that he worried about whether he’d grown as a person.
“Thank you. I like your jacket; it’s very green too” Luna smiled with a slight tilt to her head as if considering something. “Who’s is it?”
He sighed and folded it before he could change his mind. He Accio’d an envelope and put it in the basket next to Peppin’s perch. He stroked the soft, downy feathers of the birds head as the bright yellow eyes slowly opened up to gaze at him.
“See, you know me so well,” Draco smiled before putting another kebab in his mouth. He paused for a moment before turning to Harry again. “So, seriously, how did you find me?”
Draco listened to Rolf as he talked about his children. Twin boys Lysander and Lorcan. Born on either side of the cusp between Pisces and Aquarius. It was fascinating to listen to Rolf, who became so animated that a faint sheen of sweat had appeared on his forehead. Draco nodded and smiled but could offer nothing to the conversation.
Draco’s heart fell. When he had asked for juicy morsels, he had wanted to hear more about Harry and Ginny. He nodded, feigning interest, not allowing the disappointment to show. The bell at the door rang as four teenagers walked in. Draco assumed they must be older than Hogwarts age, but they didn’t look like it. They occupied a table in the corner, raising the noise level in the fairly quiet room.
“People don’t normally insult people when they’re conversing in my experience.” Harry waited, not wanting to look around to see if Malfoy waited. After a few silent seconds, he turned to see him motionless and looking at him—a look of surprise on his face, which was soon erased by the mask.
“It appears that Mr Malfoy suffers from anxiety and panic attacks. Understandably, it appears that the incident earlier exacerbated his symptoms. Nothing to be concerned about, however worth noting in your report.” The mediwitch smiled kindly at Draco before talking again. “What I will do is arrange for a course of treatment aimed to reduce your anxiety. You’ll be able to collect it from the dispensary along with a follow-up decoction which will need to consumed when you get home.”
“I know you’re tired Malfoy, I’ve only got a few more questions, and then I’ll leave you to rest.” Draco nodded, not wanting to open his eyes against the harsh light.
Harry waved his own, summoning two cups from the cupboard. He watched as the spell filled the cups with coffee from the freshly heated kettle before floating them down onto the table between them. He still got a thrill being able to use magic. The novelty of it hadn’t worn off.
He stepped out into the bright day and took in a deep and refreshing breath. He loved the smell of the air; everything smelled so fresh and new. He could smell the dragons too. Smoke and meat with a high metallic tang to it, sometimes the sweetness could be confused with hay. That was the smell of dragons. It was such an unusual scent to describe; only people who worked with dragons could understand. But, it was a scent you never forgot.
Mrs Weasley had already made her feelings known, and he wasn’t sure he knew how Ron and Hermione would take the news. Hermione already knew, he was sure of it, and it would surprise no one if she did, but Ron. He shook his head. Ron would pitch a fit, and their relationship would warp into something strange, tension-filled.
“Don’t give her a hard time,” Harry said, “Probably wasn’t easy living with me and like you said, we’ve not been happy for a while, so…” Harry said as he knocked back the first of his new whiskeys. “I’m surprised it took as long as it did for her to find someone else.” Harry gazed into the bottom of the glass as he felt the bitter taste and the burn as it went down
Draco shook his head, knowing that nothing would deter Blaise Zabini from his mission if he chose to sink his teeth into it. Distraction was the best option. He would have to keep Blaise preoccupied.
The restaurant seemed surprisingly quiet for a Saturday the week before Christmas. Draco suspected that some still held grudges against Goblin-owned businesses even though they had been banking with goblins for generations.
“I was at St Mungo’s on Saturday. Guess who I was with.” Ron announced, drawing in the adult’s attention as he glanced between Harry and Hermione. Hermione shook her head, sending her frizzy curls quivering as she shrugged. Some of the others also shrugged or raised their eyebrows in interest.
“I don’t think so, but they were talking about the war, so…” Draco trailed off, shrugging uncomfortably. “I didn’t instigate it, Weasley. If that’s what you’re suggesting.”
Noomi paused for a second as she thought back. She shook her head. “I don’t think so.” Her face broke out into a smile. “I think you have dominated the world with your talk of dragons.”
“Good Morning,” Draco greeted with a smile, he looked around, but there was no sign of Harry at all.
Blaise whistled in amazement, his eyes wide and bright. “So you went out there and talked about family? I take it that it was a short conversation? Not being funny, but between the pair of you, you’ve got no family left.” He shrugged. “Sorry to be brutal,” He added as an afterthought when Draco glared at him but without any true malice. He was used to Blaise’s ruthless honesty.
Draco nodded as Harry’s hand slid out of his. He held the clothes peg tightly, his eyes trained on Draco.
Without fail, there would be at least three journalists waiting for him at the floos in St Mungo’s, digging around for details about his life. Sometimes they wanted feedback on the most recent Romilda Vane article. Then, when it was a dry news day, they would ask him about the Harpies and Ginny’s career. The whole routine had been going on for so long he knew most of the Prophet reporters by first name, last name, birthday and was even familiar with some family members.
Draco remembered a time when he’d looked at his ancestral home with pride and love, where every nook and cranny showed his family’s superiority and power. Now all he saw was the shell of a house filled with horrors. Black windows, gaping in silent screams as if shrieking at the atrocities they’d witnessed. Draco pushed that thought away as images came unbidden to his mind. He gritted his teeth, squeezing his fists so tightly that the blood began to pound, and his nails bit into his skin. The pain helped, as it always did. The pain grounded him and kept him in the present, both a blessing and a curse.
The hospital was a blur as people and voices seemed to float around him, their voices disembodied and distorted. Being unable to focus on anything made his churning stomach roll uneasily, and he was relieved when they were finally alone in a quiet room.
“Well, a witch disappeared in the Hebridean mountains a few months ago, a muggle couple a few months before that and possibly some livestock from the surrounding areas. Normally, it wouldn’t be much cause for concern; however, there seems to be a growing number of muggle sightings of creatures on the ridges. Unfortunately, no remains have been recovered, and no one has seen anything concrete. We need to investigate whatever is causing the disappearances and deal with it accordingly. The role for which you have been hired is to head the investigation.”
