By the time Harry had meandered his way back to the castle, it was dinnertime. He made his way to the Great Hall, caught one glimpse of Ron and Hermione in a heated argument at the end of the Gryffindor table, and promptly changed course to sit with Luna at the Ravenclaw table.
I wrote this at midnight in an absolute frenzy. Anyway, Harry doubts his identity and goes to the Sorting Hat for help.
"Albus!" She called again, her face taut with worry. When Dumbledore's portrait didn't show any sign of movement, she sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose.
"For what?"
"Ron!" Harry exclaimed, but his friend didn't seem to hear as he kicked a bedpost so hard the wood splintered.
*** -- I am not sorry for the cliffhanger.
"He'll help them," Harry said with such finality that Draco almost laughed. The Boy Who Lived's devotion to the elder wizard was unyielding. "I'm sure he can. But they're not your responsibility."
, Harry, you should have seen it. Big, nasty pus bubbles burst--"
"Going to duel me, then, Potter?" Ron asked, taking a step back and raising his wand. "Then do it!"
. After their match, Madame Hooch had given the three of them a long lecture about the use of spells during Quidditch games. She nearly sent them to detention, but, considering that meant a ticket back to Azkaban for Malfoy, she agreed to look past it if they fixed the pitch.
Draco took a step forward, his shoes squeaking a bit on the bathroom floor. Harry turned to look at him, hopefully. Draco opened his mouth-- say something-- "I-" he paused, looking up at the ceiling where Myrtle had flown away. This was his chance. The Boy Who Lived was right there. One incantation, one flick of Draco's wand.
Harry looked it over. Today, double Potions with Slughorn, first thing in the morning, with Slytherin house.
Harry felt like an eleven-year old, climbing these steps. Suddenly, he was a bloody thirteen year old, and then a fifteen year old tired after an Occlumency lesson, and then sixteen, carrying a bottle of Slughorn's memory.
"Aren't you on parole?" Harry asked, and Pansy shook her head, following him out of the stands.
Harry took a step forward, clutching his wand so tightly that red sparks shot down to the floor. "Maybe."
"Thank you," Ginny said gracefully, taking a step between them, "but Harry and Ron should really be getting on the train, now."
Thank you so much for reading! Comments literally make my day so much brighter, thank you to everyone who leaves them and everyone who reads this story in general!
"My sentence was so short, they just cut it off early," she said with a tiny shrug. "I'm lucky."
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, it looks like I'll be updating every day now.
Harry gave a tiny wave and left the room, slipping into the Gryffindor changing room just across from Pansy's. The shower water was cold, and the entire tent felt dead. When Harry squinted just right, he could still see Oliver's scribbles underneath the layers and layers of poorly erased chalk. Try as he might, he couldn't find his name on there. Like he didn't exist anywhere that had once mattered so much to him.
Ron. Without him, he'd have high-ranking friends, be in Slytherin, perhaps grow to ally with Voldemort rather than fight against him.
Harry remained quiet-- it's not that he wanted to creep on Malfoy, of course not, but if he took his cloak off now, he'd have a lot of explaining to do, both to Malfoy and to his friends. Sneaking out was also out of the question, considering the double layer of doors and the somewhat hypervigilant Malfoy gazing out the window across from him.
Pansy laughed. "Harry used it for the game," she said, "probably why he lost."
Harry felt almost disappointed-- he had hoped the petty thievery would get a rise out of Ron. But there was no time to worry about that now, he had Pansy's promised puzzle piece in his palm. Harry sat down, hand hovering over the silver ribbon that tied it together.
Malfoy looked back down, removing his hand from the graffiti carvings. "Yeah," he replied. "See? Brown drew a lavender flower here." He pointed to a slightly faded drawing in purple ink, on the very corner of the table, signed with Brown in neat handwriting.
for Draco Malfoy, of all people.
Malfoy looked just a bit shocked. "You used my broom, Potter?" He asked, an accusatory look on his face. Pansy threw up her hands, still giggling. One of her hair clips was falling out, and without thinking, Harry reached over and straightened it.
. What did he and Ron have going for them, anyway? Sure, they shared a house, and liked Quidditch, and Ron helped Harry with the Horcruxes, but if Ron hadn't chosen to sit by him on that train, almost a decade ago, then Harry's life would have changed forever.
"Sorry," Harry said, pushing his trolley to the train.
"Harry!" Hermione said, bursting into the compartment. Malfoy hadn't left five minutes ago, and already here she was, absolutely bursting with excitement. "I haven't seen you in forever!"
"Why not?"
"Are you going to study with us tonight, Harry?" Hermione asked pointedly, raising a bushy eyebrow at him. The dining hall was crowded, although Harry couldn't see the glint of silver-blond hair anywhere near the Slytherin table. Harry took another bite of pasty-- it tasted unusually chalky, today-- and shook his head.
Sorry for the cliffhanger in the last chapter, I planned to update yesterday but then I had a sudden thing come up and left y'all hanging.
"Going to torture the truth out of me, then, Potter?"
"And then you come back, and you play the poor, innocent Potter game. Pretend that it's all your fault, ask everyone to come and comfort you. Poor Potter thinks all his friends died for him!" Ron was growing redder, the torchlight casting dramatic shadows over his face. He looked dead. "Waiting for someone to tell you that you're wrong, Potter? That they went down fighting for some cause?" Ron shook his head. "They died because you wouldn't come when Voldemort called. It could have all been prevented. Fred would still be alive." Ron's voice cracked, and his nose wrinkled.
"Thanks, Ron," Harry said, sweeping the candies and the newly-produced, suspiciously squishy fudge into the pockets of his robes, figuring it would be futile to try and argue against it. "I'd better get going," he said as the chimes died down.
Draco took a deep breath. "Potter," he said, "sit down."
The portraits, thank the heavens, were all slumbering. Dumbledore's portrait-likeness had taken a vacation, it seemed, which was good enough to Harry, he didn't feel like facing the soft, glasses-obscured eyes of his mentor once again.
"Potter," Draco said, his voice cracking a little as he tried to pull away. In response, Harry pushed his hand harder into Draco's shoulder, drawing out a whimper.
And he left Draco standing there in the bathroom without a word.
"Pansy. Potter. Were you two…" Malfoy's lip curled a little in disgust.
" the hat said, and the way it said his name made Harry shiver. "
"He's grieving," Hermione replied, biting into her own pasty. "We all are."
"Fancy seeing you here, Harry," a familiar, slightly snarky Slytherin said. Harry turned to see Pansy Parkinson, wearing a Slytherin scarf and two pink clips in her thin hair, sitting just a few rows above him.
The excited buzz of young witches and wizards departing the Hogwarts Express didn't excite Harry anymore. Their excited chatter about crushes, charms, the new Transfiguration teacher-- it felt incredibly disrespectful, at least in Harry's eyes. How dare that Slytherin prefect laugh at a joke her friend made? How dare that first-year step into a chariot and marvel that 'nothing' pulled it?
"What the hell were you thinking?" Ron yelled, red in the face. Harry shot up from his bed, hand slamming on the nightstand to shove his glasses onto his face.
"I'm not going to fool around with you in the Shrieking Shack, Potter."
"You're staying?" Harry asked, unable to keep the excited edge out of his voice. Draco nodded.
He let his mind wander away from the morning, and back to the past, to happier times on the Quidditch Pitch. The first time he caught the Snitch-- nearly choking on it-- and his mind was suddenly brought back to the horrors of the war, the Resurrection Stone, the hopeless way his dead mother looked at him as he walked to his death.
Harry nodded, but he didn't feel convinced. His best friend didn't feel like his best mate anymore-- Ron seemed to find almost any excuse to get out of spending time with Harry, and Ginny wasn't much better. In fact, for most of his time at the Burrow, it seemed as though the entire family wanted less to do with him than they ever had. Harry attributed this to some combination of the press and Fred's death. He was like a walking wound that they could never heal.
"How was your summer, Harry?" Dean asked. Harry couldn't help but note that he and Seamus were sitting much closer together than usual. It may have been a trick of the light, but Harry could have sworn they were holding hands.
‘You’re not coming in?’ Raphael asked, eyebrows a bit frown.
sparked a few memories of something he'd read about before. Wasn't the name Lucifer more common amongst humans? "It isn't true what the mortals say; about him having lost his wings. He
Harry gave him a smile. 'I don't care what your hair looks like, Draco. What only matters is you as a person; your soul of gold and blue,' he told him. 'And if you really want to know what I think about it — I find it truly adorable.' Harry's hand messed up Draco's with a single movement of his hand, making it a resemblance of his own.
'I-I did it,' Draco admitted.
Half an hour passed by and there still was no sign of Harry.
Looking away, Malfoy seems to think about that for a second. He let's out a soft breath, then looks into Harry's eyes again. “How could I
, the Auror. But as the last Death Eaters were captured and most other dark wizards and witches decided to forever hide away in foreign countries, the Auror Department became a boring place to work. Nowadays he only gets called out on a field trip once in 2 weeks and spends most of his time doing paperwork for the Ministry.
. He knew there was no escape from his father; that he would have to go home sooner or later — but if he could choose between those two, he would always choose for later — even though if that meant that it would be harder and more painful. If he could spend more time in freedom, in Harry's embrace; he would always choose for later. If he could escape the evil of the Dark Lord, radiated onto his father's presence; then he would always choose for later.
. Could something go right, go easy for once? Why did things always complicate themselves when both he and Harry were involved?
again.
He opened the door panting loudly, catching for breath he wasn't able to inhale anymore. He heard the girls jump off the sofas, hurrying themselves towards him and wrapping their arms around him like they so often did.
What's an old shoe doing here
'Is that why you came to the library?' Draco asked, glancing at Harry with a little grin on his face.
you want me to do, Harry? You told me I look like the man I hate the most in the entire world! Well, not anymore,' he told him. His voice cracked up more with each word and he could hear his French accent draw through it more than usual. Losing his voice, losing his vocabulary, losing his hair, losing his
'Dumbledore told me that as well, you know,' Harry then said. 'Did he know for long you were coming to Hogwarts?'
. Let’s get in the water now before we catch a cold, shall be?’
, Harry!’ It sounded again.
Loud shouting followed quickly after, and men dressed in dark robes and faces painted the color of blood came running down the street — over the old pebbles and with their wands pointing in the trio their direction. 'Run!' yelled Ron, as he was the first one to spot them. Without hesitation, Hermione and Harry followed their ginger friend over the rest of the bridge, into a forest that laid on its other end. Harry had no time to look over his shoulder to see if the men were still there, but their shouting and hexing of spells told him already enough. 'They're Snatchers!' Ron shouted.
"Maybe you can get off for tonight," Ron said, wiping the grease from his mouth with the sleeve of his jumper. "Tell him you've got an emergency."
The whispers followed Harry onto the train-- first years, stopping their chatter when they saw him. A fourth-year Hufflepuff who gave him a chocolate frog card--
"You can borrow this!" Harry said it just a bit too fast, thrusting out his Invisibility Cloak so hard it nearly hit Malfoy in the chest. "I mean…" Harry flushed, sweating a little. "You both can… wear…"
"Took you long enough, Harry!" Seamus grinned, extending a hand out to him. Harry climbed up and sat awkwardly between Luna and Hermione. Ron was across from him, a bitter glare furrowing his eyebrows.
"Yes!" Pansy chirped, grabbing Malfoy's arm. "Yes, Seeker's game Friday, I'll beat you and all of that, we
with hatred. "Or have I been the side character in the Boy Who Lived's life?"
" She pushed past Ron, checking him with her shoulder, and stomped towards the Great Hall. "And get your own damn food, Harry!"
Harry Wingardium Leviosa'd a branch to poke at the knot at the Whomping Willow's base, muttered "Mischief Managed" to the map, and ducked inside the tunnels. It was a much tighter squeeze than it was in his third year, and for a moment he considered turning back as the tunnel narrowed. Just as he thought that maybe he was too stocky to fit through, he saw a flash of silvery hair in the moonlight.
"You're welcome," he said, sounding only halfway genuine. "Hope you find him," he added dully, before opening the door to Harry's compartment and slipping inside.
"Would you stop your yelling?" The drawling voice of Severus Snape caught Harry by surprise. He glanced up at the portrait, which sat comfortably next to Dumbledore's across the room. Harry could have sworn, for a second, that Snape's black eyes landed on his form, but if he had been discovered, the portrait of Snape didn't elect to mention it.
"In Azkaban?" Malfoy asked, glancing a judgemental eye towards Harry.
"Where is Ron?" Harry asked, glancing around the Common Room. "Did he go to breakfast?"
Hermione tapped her foot in annoyance but didn't offer any criticism. "It feels like we've been here for months already," she said, "and it's only been a day."
Draco didn't respond. He wasn't sure what to say, really. Harry didn't seem to mind this. In fact, he seemed almost relieved, as though Draco's silence had given him the chance to babble on.
Harry realized that Hermione's eyes were filling with tears. "Of course it does, Ron!" She said, her voice breaking a little. "Will you two put your stupid wands down?"
"All right, Harry?" Ron's eyebrows furrowed with concern, and Harry's chest grew tight with annoyance.
Harry considered,
"I don't know, Hermione," Harry said, even as he followed her towards it. "I don't think that Ron--"
"It's beautiful," Harry said. Indeed, if it hadn't fallen into disrepair, it would be a formidable broom-- sturdy, with wood that had obviously been polished many times, trimmed broom-bristles shaped perfectly for aerodynamics.
Malfoy nodded, a solemn look crossing his face. "I understand," he said cooly. "Perhaps you should return to your dormitory, then, as I figure to do now."
Harry drew open the Marauder's Map-- there, yes, Draco Malfoy, in the Shrieking Shack, pacing back and forth. Filch was in the dungeons, and Peeves was in the Herbology classroom, presumably stealing Mandrakes to replant in first-year's cauldrons.
"The truth is, I wouldn't have told you about this if I hadn't-- if I didn't--" he closed his eyes, leaning up, bracing himself. "I have feelings for you, Potter. Love feelings. And I know--" he raised a hand, cutting Harry off, "that you most likely don't feel the same way." Draco's calm demeanor had returned, the tears already dried on his cheeks. "I've made my peace with that. But now, I've betrayed Voldemort. I don't know how long I'll be here, and maybe a bit of your Gryffindor has rubbed off on me, because it felt cowardly to hide my feelings for any longer."
Pansy barked a laugh, but Malfoy remained silent, just the hint of a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. "I can see that," he said, before pushing past the both of them and sweeping into the changing room.
Ron snorted. "Right. Every time we talk, it's always about you, and how Voldemort's affected you, and how bad life is for you." He threw his hands into the air sarcastically. "Poor,
"Let's get breakfast, then," Hermione chirped, and it sounded just a little less fake this time. "Neville? Seamus? Dean?" She glanced around the Common Room, and her bubbly energy very quickly fizzled out. Dean and Seamus were whispering to each other in a corner, and it looked like Seamus may have been crying. Neville was staring, dead-eyed, at the wall. Ginny, a cup of hot chocolate in one hand and the
Draco's back tensed up as he tried to move backward, only to run into the porcelain sink. A snarl crossed his face as Harry leaned over him, tall and looming. His normally friendly face was dark, his green eyes clouded over with something Draco couldn't quite place.
"Yeah," Harry gave a half-hearted grin to Luna as he scooted over to allow room for Ginny. "Yeah, Luna, I'm brilliant."
"In a closed space with me, right," Harry finished. "I was under my invisibility cloak."
Harry's heart sunk, but Ron didn't stop talking. "And you just want to act like nothing's wrong, like it's our fault that we don't want to talk to you. Hell, I'm surprised Hermione puts up with your whining ass. You may have saved the world, Potter," Ron practically spat, "but that doesn't make you a good person."
"Parkinson," Harry greeted, and Pansy laughed.
"For telling people to grab you. Give you to Voldemort. Don't worry," she smiled softly, casting a wary glance to Harry. "I got my due payment for it. A year in Azkaban. Luckily," she stretched her back out, yawning a little. "McGonagall summoned everyone back."
Pansy glanced at Malfoy, concern lining her features. "I mean, if that's what you'd like. I can take some leftovers for you?"
"Draco…" Harry said softly, and Draco squeezed his eyes as tight as he could, willing himself not to cry.
Harry sunk his head down, rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands. The names flew around him, guilting him. The parasitic thought, the one he had tried to keep down for so long, re-emerged at that moment--
The Sorting Ceremony doesn't go as planned.
"Soon," Harry said, standing up to avoid the question. "I'll see you both tomorrow."
Harry pretended that Malfoy didn't mean that as an insult. "I ran out of the Sorting," he confessed, "they started reading the names of the dead students. I couldn't handle it."
"They gave it to me," Harry said, and he felt his face flush with shame. "Because I couldn't get into Hogsmeade."
Hermione raised a distasteful brow. "He's hardly a git," she said defensively, lifting Crookshanks pointedly from his basket to set him safely on her lap. "Frankly, five years is a ridiculous sentence."
Harry wiped his eyes, praying that Malfoy hadn't been standing there long. "I could ask you the same," he deflected. "Plotting something?"
Luna blinked dreamily up at him, as though Harry had pulled her from some deep thought. "You're not supposed to be here," she stated, although she didn't sound particularly perturbed by it.
Cho smiled sadly. "Yeah," she muttered, reaching up to rub her thumb over the badger pin. "It really has." She looked down at her feet for a moment, silent.
And it was probably healthy, too, at least that's what Harry thought. Maybe sticking around with Ron and Hermione was confirming the other students' preconceived notions about Harry's so-called elitism. Spending more time with Pansy definitely warmed Slytherin house up to him considerably, although many of his fellow Gryffindors had grown tense around him. Harry didn't mind it, not really. Some days, he wondered what would have happened if he had been sorted into Slytherin, like the Sorting Hat recommended.
,' Harry echoed with a terrible accent. 'It has something to do with love, right?'
, why did he have to be so weak? Eyes casted away from Harry he stared up to the Quidditch posts. They towered above his head like giant monsters and it frightened him even more.

'I didn't know Dumbledore had a brother,' Harry replied, a confused look visible in his eyes.
“What do you want?” he asks the pair, trying to hit his curiosity as good as he can.
that he felt and just
"Of—of course," he answered, his voice suddenly shaking and his lips dry.
A fire of ginger hair then appeared in their sight, storming directly at them and Harry pulled his hand away again. Ron Weasley looked furious as he crossed the dance floor, pushing a few couples out of his way to reach Harry and Draco. ‘I can’t believe it!’ he almost yelled at them. His face had gone as red as a tomato and it blended in perfectly with his vintage looking robes.
'Is she going to announce something?' Ansel added with the same blind sight as his brother.
Kingsley wasn't quite happy to see them, telling them from the start that he was
A large lake approached Draco's view, followed by a beautiful castle on top of huge rock formations. His eyes looked at it as if mesmerized; it seemed like something from a fairytale. Scotland was more beautiful than he had thought. At least, Hogwarts was. He could see many tiny windows and the smallest architectural details that another set of eyes would simply ignore. Gargoyles in every magical creature's shape; it was all quite the sight.
'No — not at all.' Shaking her head far too many times, Hermione looked away from Draco's eyes. The draping got drawn aside again, startling now both Draco as Hermione. To their relief, it was Harry's face that doomed up between all the glittering gold.
'Why not?' Harry asked again. Of course Draco's father would be able to hurt him, even when Draco was probably smarter and better at dueling; there would always be a way.
haunting him and keeping him from his sleep. His mind kept trying to figure out what it could possibly be, running down a list of possibilities as Draco fought with his blanket and punched his pillow. Feeling extremely exhausted by the complete lack of sleep, Draco got out of bed around eight; an hour he thought Harry would be awake at. He dressed himself in some casual clothes as it was Saturday anyway, a simple jumper and trousers would do for the day. The weather was finally starting to get better again and an early spring breeze blew a few strands of hair out of his face. He almost never wore hats anymore when seeing Harry, knowing that the boy loved his long hair so much.
They seemed unwilling to learn students by name or refer to them by their correct House names. Draco just found it funny, and therefore didn't comment on it at all.
Harry exclaimed, suddenly realizing what the woman was talking about. He met her gaze, finding confusion in her eyes.
Still thinking about all those things, Draco had decided to stay in his room until they would go back to Beauxbatons. But the good-hearted girls were worried about his health, about his hunger and Draco couldn't deny the rumbling feeling in his stomach whenever someone mentioned the word 'food'. And so he got dragged to dinner that night, dragged to a place he would be surrounded by people whom despised him. At least, if Harry told them the truth about his father.
!' he called out.
,' Harry began, his own eyes staring at locket, concentrating. '
Feeling like getting distracted again, he tried to focus his thoughts once more. Potter wasn't really helping with that, stuttering and pouring in tea for the both of them. Since when did Potter become so friendly and polite with his school's archenemy? Draco didn't know, but he did know that this was the moment to talk to Potter about his arm, about the curse.
A nod of ginger hair followed as they walked back inside, together as they were supposed to be all the time — together as friends fighting for the ones they loved.
real, and out of relief he let out a breath he'd been holding in. "You're still here," he now commented out loud, pulling the ladder up on the attic and closing the hatch.
; I am one of the few students who can open the gates for important visitors or whatever — it doesn't really matter why — but it granted me the ability to let Dumbledore in; to invite him onto the grounds of my beloved school. He smiled at me and told me exactly what had happened with that same smile still on his face; as if it all had been a big joke he was the starter of. But he turned serious when explaining to me he had to hide — hide away from the Ministry. I then told him I could help him with that, but that he at least had to tell Madame about it. It wasn't a problem and before I knew I was helping the headmaster of Hogwarts hide away in this school; bringing him food three times a day and making sure he was alright.'
'Are you looking for Castor, Draco?' Voldemort asked him in a whispering tone. Draco couldn't help but respond with a slight nod, his curiosity too grand. 'I have been told that he hadn't been very honest with us — am I right, Severus?'
They flew high above the clouds, softness of white brushing Draco's cheek. He had his arms wrapped around Harry's waist, his head resting upon his shoulder while imagining they were flying on something else than a Norwegian Ridgeback — miles above the ground. The dragon had carried them out of London, left the cityscape behind to exchange it for a mountain view. For a moment it seemed as if they were in Scotland again; as if Hogwarts' castle could doom up out of nowhere if they only looked hard enough. However, they were nowhere near Scotland, and Draco believed none of them truly had a clue of where they were.

, is what Harry had said.
He had stopped it. He had stopped one of the three unforgivable curses without using a wand. He had stopped it by pure will.
Going back to Hogwarts had never been so double for all of them before; they knew they would be safe there again but still Draco was just waiting for Bellatrix to show up outside their window to burn the whole castle down. A few nights after they had returned Draco also started to suffer from nightmares; ones where he was trying to extinguish the fire of the Burrow by holding his hands in the flames — as if it would help the spells to transfer better from his body to the house. And then from one terrible scene to another he was thrown; suddenly face-to-face with Dumbledore with a
His mother shrugs, lifting her shoulders ever so slightly. “I thought it suited you rather well.’ Then she let out a sigh. 'Better than the Eagle Owl every did, at least.”
In less than a second Draco had drawn his wand again, pointed its intricate golden tip at Harry's best friend. '
but it slowed all of them down as Harry and Hermione were worried for what had happened to their friend. It felt like they were losing more and more with every further step they took. Glancing over his shoulder at Hermione, Harry spotted a Snatcher only a few feet away from her. Noticing this as well, Hermione raised her wand and casted a spell — one that wasn't meant for the Snatcher on her heels, but for Harry in front of her. Red shot in his direction, blinding him for a single second before hitting his face and making him fall down by its impact. Imaginary bugs crawled underneath his flesh, made him grab his face with both hands. He heard how his friends fell to the ground shortly after as  — or got
It only made Draco more furious; the Tournament had been something that shouldn't have happened at all. It had caused yet another student to go down in history as a dead victim of the absurd game, but apparently the Ministries of Europe had only had their eyes set on the positive things. 'You can't let her mess with our school,
'Then you should've realized the danger.' A certain anger resounded through his voice — a certain worry that Draco had so often heard in Albus Dumbledore's voice as well.
“We were—,” Potter gets another push from Weasel, more like a hard poke this time, “— I mean,
'H-Harry,' Draco stammered in whispers. 'I'm not feeling so well.' Tears welled up into the boy his eyes, followed by cries that literally tore Harry's heart into a million pieces.
would send him a package or even a letter? There was only one in this Wizarding World crazy enough to do that.
A few other Ravenclaws agreed with Cho's words, and even Luna seemed to sigh in agreement.
'Apparently she thinks I am not qualified enough to help her.' Draco felt a stab through his heart at those words. Admitting it to someone made it real — made him feel like a failure.
help. Maybe he nor Harry were such failures after all.
His mother reached out a hand, and even though Draco would've liked nothing more than to push it away, he needed the support. Holding on to her while taking the tiniest steps, he could feel the scars move all over his body; ready to rip again. It hurt as badly as thousands of knives stabbing through one's figure — their blades burning with the flames of hell. Draco bit his teeth, unwilling to let any of that pain be noticeable on his face. Narcissa let her fingers slide through her son's hair to fix it a little, after they had managed to cross the hallway and walk down the stairs. Sad eyes, ones from a woman whom had nearly given up.
"Bloody hell, Hermione, no need to be rude." Ron took a disdainful swig of Butterbeer before turning back to Harry. "Seriously, Harry, I can stage a diversion. Fred and George gave me these great--"
"It was awful," Malfoy finally answered. "That's all you need to know. The screams--" he cut himself off, shaking his head. "I should move," he finally stated, "technically, I'm not supposed to be in any closed area with you."
The population had hardly settled before a booming voice cut through the easy conversation. "Students," Headmistress McGonagall called, raising her arms above her head. She was wearing a brilliant emerald robe, emblazed with golden stars. Her glasses, too, had been re-made with gold rims, and thanks to Harry being so close he could see the tiny golden flecks in the edges of the glass.
"The Muggles--" Arthur introjected, but the wizard ignored him.
"Severus," Harry whispered to the phoenix statue. For a moment, his heart skipped, wondering if it would work. The phoenix's carved eyes looked through him, beyond him, as if unimpressed by who had dared enter the office. And then, silently, it rotated, revealing the familiar gold-tinted staircase up to the Headmaster's office. As soon as Harry crossed the threshold, the phoenix closed itself again.
Short chapter? Yes. Am I spoiling you by releasing two chapters today? I am.
Ron rolled his eyes. "He was a Death Eater, Hermione," he said.
The Slytherin changing rooms weren't as clean as the Gryffindors', but they felt a little homier-- slightly more worn, with a few silver trophies on a 'bench' that someone had transfigured into a physics-defying broom. Despite never having played Quidditch before, Pansy seemed rather invested in the Slytherin changing rooms, pointing out every tiny piece of history and object of interest.
"How was your summer?" Harry asked, and immediately regretted it.
"Honestly," Hermione agreed, casting a somewhat distasteful look at Ron as he took another gluttonous bite. "how does he expect you to pass your NEWTs? You'll never become an Auror if you don't study!"
Harry put an arm on Draco's thigh. "Hey," he said, and Draco turned to look at him through tear-blurred eyes. "You were manipulated, Draco. Threatened."
I'm sorry I was gone, but look I made you some Content! Daddy made you your favorite, open wide. Here comes the content!
"I get it, Harry!" Ron brandished his wand wildly, and it shot red sparks as it flew through the air. "You can't do anything, can you? Blubbering Potter, too goddamn broken to confront the people who died for him! You didn't even stick around for Fred, did you? You're no Chosen One, you're a sniveling git with a hero complex!" The anger seemed to drain, slowly, from Ron's body, as his skin turned paler and his wand hand grew steadier.
"That's nice to hear." Malfoy folded out the table between them and crossed his arms over it, drumming his fingers on the cool metal, tearing his gaze away from Harry to trace his finger over the graffiti.
"Ron," Harry warned, lifting his hands up, "Malfoy didn't kill your brother."
"Well, you're no Ravenclaw, Harry," Pansy quipped, a dry laugh echoing hollowly throughout the pitch. "But what I did was selfish."
"Want to play a game?" Harry asked, inclining his head towards the Pitch. "If I could borrow a broom."
"Lovely weather," Harry commented, nodding towards the ceiling, which was grey and cloudy and not lovely at all. Ron didn't bother to answer, offering a noncommital shrug and a grunt.
, and it was driving Harry absolutely nutty. He could barely hold a conversation with her, she was always going on about Ron, or about how nervous she was for the NEWTs, or about how worried she was about Crookshanks' graying whiskers. Harry knew it was irrational to be angry at Hermione, who was obviously trying her best to keep the trio from splitting apart, but he couldn't help but feel like he wanted the separation to happen. As great as Ron and Hermione were, it was fascinating to explore this new chapter of his life.
The Great Hall had a noticeably lighter atmosphere compared to the Gryffindor Common Room-- seeing as the younger students probably woke up earlier, brimming with excitement and magic. Harry hated to admit it, but he did envy them, if just a little. He missed back then, when every little spell was so new and such a miracle.
"Yeah," Harry responded, shifting awkwardly as he tucked his cloak into the pocket of his robes. "So."
, Harry thought, already knowing the answer. He could barely even count the number of times this exact problem had manifested itself in their relationship, nor the amount of time Harry himself had spent brooding over whether he truly
McGonagall, he noted, hadn't changed much-- Fawkes, currently a pile of ashes, still had his seat next to the mahogany desk, raised on a platform, obscured by velvety blue curtains dotted with silver stars. Books, cauldrons, even a shallow bowl of Sherbert Lemons, which Harry couldn't help but sample. They were a little bit stale, it was clear nobody had replaced them for a long while, although it could have just been Harry's dry mouth playing tricks on him.
Draco's stomach flipped. Of course. It was a stupid idea. "N-no," he stammered out, hating how weak he sounded. "Just. We can't talk here. Not now."
"No," he said, and he took a deep breath. "Ron… we've been friends for years."
"Our schedules were delivered last night," Hermione said, lip curling a little, "by the House-Elves, no less."
It didn't help, either, that Professor McGonagall had sent all the graduated seventh-years a letter summoning them for one final year at Hogwarts before they could receive the proper credentials.

"I don't blame you," Harry said, "it would have been the wiser choice. A lot of people could have lived."
"Nobody deserves those Dementors, Ron," Hermione said, scratching at Crookshank's tail. "Not even Draco."
"I doubt McGonagall will let us in," Harry pointed out, "and if we don't get back to our dorms Filch'll have a fit."
"No," Harry lied. "I was…" he struggled to think of an excuse. "I--"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry pulled himself to his feet, blinking his eyes fast and wiping down his glasses. "I'll live, Malfoy," he grumbled. "Aren't we not supposed to be together?"
"The one the Weasley twins used to have?" Malfoy asked. "I remember that. Tried to nick it once, was stuck in the Hospital Wing for a week with nasty boils."
"Fine," Harry deadpanned. "Only went to Potions."
Lost in thought, Harry forgot about his friends, who undoubtedly were trying to figure out where he had gone off to, and instead continued to observe the compartment. In previous years, he had never paid much attention to the Hogwarts Express, always assuming that he'd be back, again and again. Such a precious part of his childhood, and he didn't take it in for everything it was.

'Now I finally want to see your room,' Harry then said, already pulling the French further down the hallway even though he had no clue of where to find his room.
'Perhaps you won't have to,' was all the man had left to say before slowly sauntering off, glancing at Draco with mysterious eyes before leaving the classroom.

Hermione had always hated it when Harry or Ron didn't tell her the truth; it was as if she could hear every lie within a sentence and stare the truth out of their eyes. 'I was with Draco,' he repeated. 'But — we didn't go for a walk.'

Having the room for themselves now that Tonks wasn't there anymore, the boys could talk more easily and stay up for as long as they wanted — until the moonlight would hit it's peak of shining the brightest and every star had appeared in the night sky. They were still sharing their little bed, arms wrapped around one another and that scent of pine radiating from Harry's body again. He had missed it so much; even actual pine trees didn't seem to possess the richness of the scent. 'You have to tell me about saving Arthur, Harry. You don't want to keep secrets from me, right?'

Harry swallows and looks down at their hands, Malfoy's pale fingers are still wrapped around Harry's tanned ones. The leather of his glove making Harry's palm feel even more sweaty. 'Our relationship… I was thinking about that,' he answers.

'Because we were supposed to meet at the library after dinner but he never showed up.'

Already walking away from the Gryffindor's table with the box of berets under his arm, Harry had to hurry himself to keep up with his lover's sudden vivacity while trying to swallow down that mouthful of food.
‘I got it from flying a broom. My first time flying,
Hermione and Ron turned their eyes away, followed the goblin, but Harry kept staring at Draco with a weird grin on his face. 'You really don't like getting wet, do you?' he snorted, letting out a little laugh.
No warning had been given when they had snatched Draco by his arm out of the hallway, on his way to the library. He hadn't panicked at first because of the sudden abduction, but he had panicked because he would miss his meeting with Harry. Dragged to headmaster Dumbledore's office, Draco had thought he had done something wrong, but there he had seen the faces of others he recognized; Gabrielle, Hermione and Cho. He had stood beside the equally confused girls and waited for what the professors in front of him had to say.
Moments later they had climbed a few steps, were standing on a landing with and archway that looked down upon the white creature. it was only a short distance; they could jump right on top of the dragon's neck if they wanted to. Draco's knees wanted to give in at the sight alone, and Ron next to him was turning paler by the second. Harry seemed the only one unafraid, his hand confidently clenched around the sword.
It now was the day of Draco's departure, the day he would return to Beauxbatons and then to his family. They had had their last meal, had heard Dumbledore's warning speech and had said their good-byes. But they just couldn't let go. The carriage was to depart within an hour, and Draco and Harry had decided to take one last walk by the Lake, the place where they had spent a lot of time together over the year. 'Promise to write me letters, at least,' Draco told him as they sauntered past the spot where they used to practice the Bubble-Head Charm.
Another movement followed; another one that no-one had expected. Harry’s lifeless body moved again — left Hagrid’s arms as if he had known Draco would perform the perfect distraction. Draco saw his lover race a few feet, fall to his knees to pick up a wand he recognized immediately. A curse of green; fired at the boy straight away. And Harry, defending himself with Draco’s wand.
Madame Maxime then let out a deep sigh, making Draco's heart jump. Was it a good sigh or a bad one? '

And he didn't like the look of it at all. To him it felt as if the butterfly he had once been had transformed into a moth; still in the same category but totally different. One got loved while the other one got avoided.
Saint-Potter.
‘I hate it when we fight.’
He wondered what presents Harry had gotten yesterday; they hadn't talked about it. Beside from the knitted hat, he himself had been given a book on special plants and an elaborate golden hand-mirror from his parents. Celebrating Christmas at home was something Draco had always loved, as the Manor for once wouldn't feel so cold when decorated with Christmas trees and ribbons everywhere. He usually got more presents but his parents liked to hand things over in person, and gave Draco the promise of giving him more once he returned home for the summer. But Draco didn't need more presents; he already had all he wished for.
Harry sighed. If only he had known Draco had been there, maybe he could've met him at a certain place even if it had just been for a few minutes. 'Did you get a glimpse of me while you were there, though?' he asked and to his surprise Draco nodded his head.
?' Harry's eyes just widened as a response, kept themselves locked on Draco as he pulled the red jumper over his head and tossed it somewhere on the floor. Of course Harry had seen his bare chest before, had seen his scar, had seen him at his most vulnerable self; but this time it was different. Even though Draco had already felt a certain attraction to the boy back then, it couldn't compare to where they were now. It made him feel a bit more insecure about himself, a feeling he hadn't really felt before; the vain blond he was. But it had appeared to Draco before that Harry could make certain feelings well up that he hadn't experienced before; hadn't known existed inside him at all.
Professor McGonagall appeared behind them, the tiniest of smiles lingering upon her lips. 'The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our hair down,' she said. 'Let's show the others what
Folding the map again with a sigh, Harry tucked it away in his jacket's pocket. 'We'll just have to go and see for ourselves, I guess.'
Draco was the second one to leave the carriage, hands neatly behind his back and chin held up high. He helped the girls get out; taking each one of their hands and either complimenting them or correcting some of their flaws.
He kneeled down next to him, followed by Ron and a still giggling Hermione. What was happening? Why did Harry suddenly collapse and why did he seem to be in so much pain? 'He's having another vision,' Hermione explained as if reading his mind, sighing deeply and serious again now her strange mood had passed. 'I thought he had the skill of Occlumency under control by now.'
The Manor is more quiet than usual as Draco doesn't dare to leave his room anymore. There has been no more curse spreading since that day with Potter, fortunately. Maybe that simple spell somehow worked anyway. Besides from the soft sounds of a cello being played by Mother, it's awfully silent in the cold house. Pibbly brings him food as usual; only saying something to him when highly necessary. Leaving with empty food trays and leaving behind an empty Draco as well. Draco's weight loss has peaked and doesn't seem to change anymore; leaving him on the edge of being very skinny and near anorexic.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
A few moments later Potter’s wand is directed at his chest, green eyes serious and eyebrows frowned. Heavy book dangling in his other hand, eyes flicking from the page back to Draco. Why did Draco agree to this again?
Harry sneered at his words. 'So you're saying that if that blond git from Slytherin wears red or gold that he's your friend as well?'
Ron nods and stands up as well. He lifts his hand up a second as a farewell and Harry draws back from his fireplace. Bird songs resound through his ears immediately and the tranquility of his house in the forest returns. A bit clumsy he gets up from his knees and walks over to his window. The bird's view on the river below never gets old. He picks up his mug again and drops himself back on a chair. Taking another sip of his tea he suddenly thinks about Malfoy destroying his set of china by a single flick of his hand.
the blond was again, now only a forearm away. At the sound of jiggling china he looks down at his tea cup again, noticing that his hands are shaking. Malfoy takes the tea cup out from him, placing it next to his own on the small table. His pale and gloved hand now both find their way to Harry's and hold them still. 'Do I make you
'My friends are normally the ones to always help me and even though they are acting like giant arses at the moment, they should be the ones to be here by my side instead of you.'
has Ministry connections; so not to worry about me, Harry,' Draco replied with a tone as if it was obvious. 'Now, come on — we don't have all night.'
Scribbling down a note, he had ran towards the library as fast as he could. Halfway he had seen Ron appear out of nowhere, shoved the note into the ginger's hands instead. Ron had given him a weird look before Draco had taken off again, hurrying back to the Headmaster's office.
His words seemed to sink in the way Draco hoped they would; Ron's irritated expression cleared and was replaced by something like pity. Perhaps he had put his jealousy for his best friend away and realized that Harry had never asked to be the person he was; it had been decided by something — someone greater than them all. 'Alright, I believe you. But that doesn't mean I won't be watching
'What happened to you?' The twins were waiting by the carriage, both their arms crossed and eyebrows frown.
Draco smiled slightly and gently lowered Harry's hand from his shoulder. Physical contact was still not his favorite thing ever, even if they just had become friends again. ‘I see. Well, then. To make it absolutely clear that I’m supporting you, and am very sorry for the way I behaved—‘

'That we're on the wrong side.'
'Why did he request an Unspeakable and not an Auror? Azkaban is a dangerous place, I'm not sure an Unspeakable could fight against any of it's prisoners without losing a limb.' Harry's also just a little upset that they could've checked it out easily and then have reported it to an Unspeakable, if necessary. It also would've made all this quite unnecessary.
'That belongs to master Regulus,' he answered. 'Filthy mudblood stole it from master!'
Harry nodded. 'Yes. But wouldn't it be too small to protect you?'
, I didn’t.’
'Stop it!' Harry shouted. He had drawn his wand without realizing, now pointing it at his Potions' professor's head with a trembling grip.
Arthur gave him a little smile before slowly pushing his right hand down, making the blond lower his wand. 'It won't; I promise. This house has been through many things through many generations. It'll survive.'

The old headmaster smiled slightly and shook his head. 'Of course not. Please, sit down again, Draco.'
'Are you alright,
Everyone was on the edge of their seat; anxiously and nervously waiting for the next move the Goblet would make. Dumbledore took a step forward, placing a hand atop the Goblet's smooth stone and drawing it back as quick as it was placed. A few seconds passed and Draco bit his bottom lip, waiting. He felt Fleur's hand grab his underneath the table and he gave her palm a slight squeeze.

. The sudden silence made Harry able to hear his own panting, his fastened heartbeat and he gestured for his friends to follow him. To where; he had no idea — but they had to get out of the Ministry right away. As they ran down the aisle, smoke as tall as the atrium's statue appeared in front of them again — fading away into the figure of Draco's father. 'Give me the prophecy, Potter,' he demanded again.

Draco swallowed and felt his cheeks burn. He couldn't manage to say a single word; his throat felt dry and it was as if a little goblin was playing the drums in his chest. He nodded to her words instead. 'You know that he is Fleur's rival,
. The boy seemed to blend in perfectly in the frosty winterscape, and Harry found it quite a strange sight — a sight he had never seen before.
A smile. Teeth flashing bright. One of Harry’s glasses was cracked again. Smudges of dirt and specks of dust. Draco slowly entwined his fingers with Harry, and wouldn’t be willing to let go any time soon.
Why couldn't he go back to that time?
The students of Durmstrang chose to sit down at a table surrounded by Hogwarts students dressed with accents of green. 'That's the
that Ron was holding in his hands. It reminded him of rat tails. 'Thought you'd never come!'
'After you left I couldn't help but think about the dragons and the task; all my exhaustion had disappeared. But I've come up with a plan during those nightly hours,' her smile brightened but Draco couldn't return it, sensing there was more to it.
Holding on to his hat with both hands, Draco ran as fast as he could. He had never felt rain hit his precious skin that hard before — it felt like he was getting hit by several hexes at the same time. He looked over his shoulder and saw that some girls had pulled irritated faces, but others wore bright smiles. They rather seemed to enjoy running through the rain on a Monday morning — perhaps it gave them a feeling of freedom. Draco himself didn't like it at all and was happy when he was inside the castle, exhausted from the small sprint and soaked because of the rain. He waited by the door, touching each girl's shoulder and counting them in his head. As the last girl, Ella, made her way inside, he let out a breath he didn't knew he had been holding.
'Now-,' Crouch said as he opened the silk bag. 'Miss Delacour, ladies first?'
. Can't sleep?'

That exact moment Harry realized he'd never seen a boy — no, a
‘I thought it was a simple spell?’ Draco asks him, hands behind is back and grey eyes pointed at Potter’s clumsy balancing.
'Then summon it!'
A silence fell. Not even the others, whom had been talking in the living room nearby, were making a sound. Only the loud wind outside was hearable, the faint waves of the sea. 'Where do we start?' Draco asked, turning himself to Harry and breaking the silence.
He inhaled the morning air and looked up at the castle. A few faces had appeared in front of the windows and in the distance he could see a few students eagerly hoping to catch a glimpse of what was going on. A gust of wind hit his face and made him shiver. He quickly retrieved a silk scarf from his suitcase, wrapping it around his neck before handing the round piece of luggage to Hagrid. The tall man then carefully placed them on a neat pile next to the carriage, making sure that Madame Maxime approved of his method of stacking order.
A nod followed, even though Harry hadn't slept well at all. Every night he had nightmares about either Voldemort or Draco; the monster murdering his friends, or Draco being hurt or dead. He would often catch glimpses of Dumbledore as well, stumbling down the Astronomy Tower and getting swallowed by the darkness of the night. 'Did you?' he asked in return — yet another one that got repeated daily.
A moment of silence followed. Tension bloomed in the air like a dark flower catching flame. They both stared at each other, and it was clearly visible in Draco's eyes that he got terribly surprised by this tension, by Harry's words. "You are unbelievable, Harry," soon after followed.
A massive, ivory building towered above him at the end of one of the hundreds of little streets, and with a deep sigh Draco went inside. Light in a variety of colors got cased upon him, on the surrounding walls and the floor beneath his feet. The gigantic entry hall of the Guardian Angels' Community Center reminded Draco of the buildings on earth that the Mortals called churches. With its glass-stained windows and chilly feel. The hall laid deserted with not a soul in sight, but it was too early for Draco to feel relieved — for he knew all the gossiping got done upstairs.
'I understand now,' Harry replied as he pulled Draco closer to him into an embrace. With the boy's head against his shoulder, Draco slowly put his arms around him as well. 'We'll — find a way.'
Wrought-iron gates as high as a house doomed up at the end of the road, a gigantic Manor laying behind. A few windows were lit by a warm light, but the overall feel of the house was cold and dark — as if the devil himself lived there and didn't want to get noticed at all. The Snatcher by Harry's side placed his free hand upon the iron and immediately a sort of alarm went off; startling a few crows at its sound. Only a few seconds later a blond man stormed in their direction, long locks bouncing upon his shoulders with every hurried step he took. Harry immediately recognized him, and that recognition made his heart skip a beat or two; Lucius Malfoy was standing on the other side of the gate. And if that was Lucius Malfoy, then it meant they were at Malfoy Manor — the place where they had planned on going in the first place.
. As white as snow, its eyes a pale white. Large and deep scars; red and swollen. The creature let out a cry of pain as the goblin jiggled a sort of bell which he had found by the wall. The dragon backed off, its cries unbearable to listen to. 'It's hurting him!' Hermione said, pain and sympathy hearable in her voice.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
'No — or maybe… but it's my own fault! I asked him as my date for this party,' she admitted.
'That's enough, Minerva.' McGongall shut her mouth to a tight line and looked from Draco to Dumbledore and back. 'The Ministry has demanded from the Malfoy family to stay in England for as long as mister Malfoy is staying in Azkaban. Therefore mister Malfoy here is obligated to stay in England as well and can't go to Beauxbatons like previous years. You won't deny a boy his education now would you, Minerva?'
rare, indeed."
Draco's heart started to beat fast, his breathing as well and he suddenly couldn't move anymore. The others got up to their feet, hurried themselves downstairs to see what all the fuss was about. But Draco slowly stood up and went over to the window; watched how a circle of fire and flames formed itself around the Burrow. Around a home. The home of a man whom had never trusted him and was right to do so.
They had left a new object behind in the cabinet; for whatever reason that had to be done. Draco still wasn't really sure what it did, but suspected it of maybe vanishing things. 'He had been surprised when the bird had still been there; it has happened many times before so I know he was. Over and over -- he's disappointed to find it again,' he explained to Harry in whispers. They were back in the dormitory, laying close to each other in Harry's bed and with the curtains drawn close. It had been a while since Draco had slept in the same bed as Harry; he had been too occupied with sneaking out of the dormitory at night or simply didn't feel like searching for affection. But now; now he just wanted to be close to him again.
Letting out a deep sigh, he picks up the tea cup again and stares at the ugly drawings. Potter probably drew the animals himself. His shaky and clumsy hands picking up a paint brush to draw silly figures of a peacock and snake; Malfoy symbols. And as Draco sits there staring at the tea cup, rain softly falling outside his window like glitter, he realizes that he loves it.
'Now,' Molly then interrupted. It snapped Draco out of his moment with Harry, made him realize there were more people in the room then just the two of them. It seemed to wake Harry from his enchantment as well as he closed the medallion and hung it around his neck. 'My turn.'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
,' he replied, quickly pulling the warm fabric over his head. Warmth. Coziness. A flashback to Harry's warm Christmas sweater on a cold day in February.
His curious side wanted to ask all about the other Mortals — about what they were like and things alike, but he knew Draco wasn't ready to talk about that yet. Harry could simply sense that even though nothing on Draco's calm face gave any of that emotion away. There would be another time to ask, Harry was sure of it.
Those thoughts only irritate Draco even more, and he wishes deeply that Pibbly hadn’t let the pair in.
Castor took another step forward, trying to get closer to the pair in front of him and shrouding his face in darkness again. The outlines of his burn-wounds stayed printed on Draco's retina for a second longer before his face slowly became visible again in the faint blue light of the room. 'He promised to take me back, to make me part of what I was part of before. A greater purpose, a great cause.' The grip of Castor's hand tightened around his wand; ready to cast a spell any second now. Slowly, Draco lowered his own arm bit by bit, trying to let his own wand slide from his left sleeve. 'Only thing I have to do is to stop you — find the Chosen One.' His eyes moved from Draco's Harry now, as if he had only just realized that the Chosen One was in this very room as well — even though he had called his name first.
Madame Maxime was the first one to get off, stretching out her hand for the mystery man to kiss. The man seemed to be bit surprised by it but accepted Madame's hand and kissed it with great delicacy, as if her hand was made out of porcelain. Madame showed him her brightest smile and got one in return, followed by a blush of pink cheeks. Draco could vaguely hear the man tell Madame his name; Hagrid or something likewise — a name Draco had never heard before. Even though this Hagrid appeared tall to Draco, he couldn't compete against the long and slender figure that was Madame Maxime.
Dumbledore had transfigured the glass into sand; all of the atrium's floor now covered with it. And then he disappeared — the monster named Voldemort disappeared into the sand and for a second everyone thought he was gone, that he had fled away from a battle he couldn't win. But Harry could still feel his presence, his mind doing weird things and making his knees tremble. He fell to the ground again, into the sand and saw visions flash in front of his eyes — too fast to make any sense. 'Harry?' He heard Draco's voice say, saw a glimpse of his figure kneel beside him. It felt like he couldn't breathe anymore and he reached out for help, felt Draco's hand take his and Dumbledore come closer to him as well. Soon he was surrounded by all of his friends, but his eyes somehow kept themselves focused on his headmaster.
Castor pinched his nose's bridge before nodding his head and gesturing to the cabinet. 'Be my guest.'
Harry nodded. 'Yeah, we — er — went for a long walk by the Lake,' he lied. He didn't dare to glance over at Hermione nor Ron, just scooped more scrambled eggs onto his plate.
The last thing Harry remembered was feeling a soft, warm breeze blowing over his face — followed by the darkness of sleep.
Harry shrugged. 'You looked like him from the back. I'm not quite used to seeing your dressed in black robes, you see. I knew he was a Death Eater, and didn't even
Draco turned around to face Harry again, arms crossed over one another. 'You guess a lot, don't you?' Harry shrugged. 'And whatever you're saying doesn't make any sense to me.' Harry opened his mouth but Draco hushed him. '
During all those years of the curse spreading further and further, he has never been able to tell Mother about it. He's just afraid to see the look of horror on her face; the dark memories of their past flashing in front of her eyes.
Crawling off his bed he hurries to the window and takes the small note from the owl. The parchment is wrinkled and Potter's handwriting is messier than ever.
Draco agreed with him. 'I believe so. Well, at least she's not here to mess around with Beauxbatons' education, is she?'
The book lays opened on his lap, fingers clenched around the delicate pages. At least now Draco knows where all the dents and wrinkles came from. The man's green eyes stare at the page intensely and then lift up to look in Draco's, who quickly hides his tiny smile.
Embarrassing me in front of my friends! You—“ Dudley’s sputtering abruptly came to an end as Draco placed himself right in front of Harry’s cousin. Dudley’s brown eyes grew wide and appeared shocked, as if he’d just seen the largest spider on earth. Or an
'But there must be something! You have to help us find an antidote; a cure.' Harry took some steps towards the man, entering his personal space a little more and giving him a desperate stare. 'It's Voldemort's doing and only you can help me fight the last of his legacy.'
He sighed out of relief and placed a hand upon his heart; its loud pace still resounding in his ears. At least he didn't have to worry about telling her anymore, and she didn't even seem that upset or surprised. She probably knew all along, the smart Witch that she was; probably already at the night of the Yule Ball. 'We don't mind it either, Draco,' Marie then said. Seated upon one of the blue sofas with her long brown hair let down, she gave him a sparkle of a smile. 'You and Harry are too cute together!' The girls followed her giggling and Draco blushed to scarlet red.
It was a

Draco frowned. How could it be that Hogwarts had two Champions? And maybe more importantly; how could it be an underaged Champion? He didn't feel mad about it, but wasn't glad about it either. If Harry Potter could get the opportunity to join the Tournament, why couldn't he?
Potter nods firmly and keeps silent; instead flips even more determinedly through the book. Scanning page after page; minutes pass by. Draco makes another cup of tea for himself and keeps his eyes on Potter. Something just makes him keep his eyes on the man. The way he looks at the pages, pushes his glasses further up his nose, scratches his forehead or goes through his messy hair; it all makes Draco so- so
Not another word then left Draco's lips, instead he simply placed his warm hands over Harry's arm once more and stared at it with those bright white eyes of him. The warmth slowly changed from extremely hot to a comfortable, quite pleasant warmth that made Harry almost sigh out of contentment. Slowly lifting his hand again, the red burns had faded away immediately, and Harry's arm appeared as if nothing of the sort had ever happened. "There you go," Draco said, the faintest smile carried upon his lips. "All nicely healed."
is, and therefore I cannot blame him for believing I'm the same as him. But I'm not.'
Draco's figure moved itself atop of him, feeling more heavy than ever which was strange to Harry as he knew the boy to be as light as a feather. His eyes kept staring in his — a possessive kind of stare that suddenly scared Harry to the bone. He wanted to throw the boy off him, tell him to leave and go away — tell him to act normal again even though he knew that was impossible. Harry reached out his hands, took ahold of Draco's face and felt the soft skin that was still as cold as ice. 'I love you,' he said to Draco in a whisper. A wet drop then escaped his eye — a single tear which he hadn't planned on shedding at all.
Draco swallowed and gave her a firm nod, keeping his chin high and putting his hands behind his back. 'Of course. I am only a fourth year, aren't I?'
Hermione sighed at Harry's words. 'It's only normal, isn't it? Now that his father and mother have found out to whom he has been writing all along.'
They had found Harry's prophecy by looking for the numbers and letters that had doomed up in his mind — that had held some meaning that had only become clear minutes ago. As they had obtained it, they all had thought something would've happened — that it would have become clear to why Voldemort wanted the prophecy so badly. But it hadn't done anything — and neither Harry nor his friends had known what to do with it. They also had no idea wether they should destroy it or keep it safe, but they had decided to go with the second option and had taken the orb with them on their search to find Draco and bring him to safety must he be harmed.
Draco gave Harry a side-glance before answering the headmaster with a shake of his head. 'Of course not,
—was also wondering if maybe one of the Beauxbatons girls still needed a date,' he asked, hesitant.
you going,
It quickly became clear to the boys that she was heading to Diagon Alley; the Leaky Cauldron only another street away. The crowd had thinned, the loud noises of Christmas carols slowly fading away. 'She could've flooed to Diagon Alley straight away; why all the effort of going through Muggle London?' Draco asked, his voice a whisper. Harry gave him a questioning look and pulled Draco into a dark alley as Umbridge glanced over her shoulder for the first time. A wary glance — one out of worry and suspicion.
Dumbledore had eventually defended Harry and lifted his suspension so he could return to Hogwarts again in a few weeks — but he hadn't said a word to him at all. He even had avoided any eye-contact and it had become yet another thing for Harry to worry about. Not to mention that strange, dressed-in-pink lady from the Ministry that had been so much against him; that had put him right in Azkaban herself if she could've, just because he had saved his cousin from getting devoured by a Dementor. It had seemed all so strange, her behavior. He had told Draco about her once returned and he immediately seemed to recognize her as the woman he had seen at the Manor only a few weeks ago. 'You must be careful around her, Harry; she's pure evil.'
'From
Harry rose from his seat as well, watched the twins cause quite the drama in the Great Hall with a bright smile upon his face. A dragon made of the most beautiful golden fireworks then exploded into the air, its sparks gliding over the students their heads and making its way to Umbridge. The pink lady crawled to her feet again — even faster than last time — and hurried herself through the door with the dragon following on her heels. The glass frames of her decrees exploded as the dragon did just the same, just outside the Great Hall where she had so neatly presented her rules to the students. Golden sparks flew everywhere at the explosion of the magical creature, landed around Umbridge's sulking figure.
What if she had sent the apple to the Manor — totally forgotten she usually sent it to the forest? The panic spread, his body now trembling to the bone. He couldn't go home; he couldn't explain to his parents where he had been and certainly not with
Ron let go of him and threw his hands up in the air. ‘It’s not the same!'
has escaped!' Heat was rising to his face and by a quick glance on Harry's, he noticed he wasn't the only one experiencing anger.
Dumbledore?
It resulted in no sleep at all, and as he was having breakfast with Hermione early the next morning, he found it terribly hard to stay awake. 'Are you alright?' Hermione asked. 'How did it go?'
Leaving his seat, he made his way towards the portrait and faced the blond boy painted in pastel colors. He wore an aureole of flowers, painted in pastels likewise. One single pale hand was also painted, holding a winged key. '
He couldn't help but worry about Harry the next day when they were seated for lunch, the boy not daring to tell his friends nor Draco anything about his dangerous plans with Dumbledore later that day. Draco also didn't dare himself to ask about it, and therefore remained quiet while observing Harry eating potatoes at a pace three times too fast for his liking.
Draco gave her a smile. 'A morning walk to clear my head.'
Followed by the running students were Viktor Krum he saw earlier, looking straight ahead and ignoring everyone around him. They all stared at him with longing eyes, suddenly aware of having a celebrity in their midst. And of course, Headmaster of Durmstrang Igor Karkarov closed the parade of students. Dressed in white he couldn't stand out more — but wether that was a good thing, Draco didn't know. Rumor had it that he and Madame Maxime couldn't stand each other and therefore Draco also glared at him with stares of pure hate. The man didn't seem to notice though, only kept his eyes straight ahead as Krum had done. Reaching Hogwarts' Headmaster, Dumbledore, he exposed some awfully rotten teeth and embraced him in what could be called an awkward hug.
Dumbledore followed them with his eyes and Draco could swear he saw a small smile linger upon his lips. The Headmaster then turned himself towards the two boys and placed a hand upon Draco's shoulder. 'Fleur did great,' he told him. 'She is waiting on the bench reserved for the Champions in the arena. Perhaps you could join her to watch Harry's performance of fighting his dragon?'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Ansel closed his book as well, stared at his twin-brother as if he had said somethinh impossible and completely absurd before looking at Draco with his ocean blue eyes. 'You won't do that, right?'
Harry found the Merpeople's village quite fast; almost as if he could
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
‘You’re amazing, Sirius!’ Another hug was given before Molly finally pulled Harry away from his godfather.
Heat rose to Draco's head and he couldn't help but feel embarrassed by it all; he hadn't wanted Harry to hug him in the first place and now his whole school including two others would know about their friendship. He glanced over at Harry to see the boy in a slightly surprised state as well; eyes focused on Skeeter with confusion and hate all displayed at the same time.
did he know his full name? Shaking his head a little now, Harry opened the hinge again, pushed the ladder down. "Get ready to answer a million more questions when I return."
Biting his teeth, Draco stared into the furious eyes of his father; their grey color like thunderstorms. 'Just leave me alone,' he scowled, before giving the man a weak push against his shoulder.
Harry nudged him in his side again and lifted himself off the blond, squinting his eyes out of pain once again but not letting it get in the way of hitting Draco fully on his stomach as if the pain was his fault as well. Maybe it kind of was. 'You're unbelievable.'
Sixteen years had passed since then, and the baby of about ten months old had grown to be a boy of nearly seventeen. Once the boy had passed the age of ten, which had been the longest time Draco had been able to guard one of his mortals, each morning he'd felt pride swell up in his chest as he saw emerald green eyes open themselves once more to wake for a new day. Accompanied by the screeching voice of that vile woman, that was.

Draco shook his head. 'Not until a few hours ago; he was as clueless as you were.'
But usually Harry just forgot about the event within the next few minutes, and went on with his day as normal.
'I know, Draco, but we're kind of locked in here, aren't we?' Harry replied with frown eyebrows. 'Or do you know a way out?'
'You shall play, and you shall play it well,' his Mother and Father always told him. 'Being able to play an instrument is one of the oldest and finest Pureblood traditions there is.'
"I don't
"What did you say?" Harry asked, unsure if Draco had actually said something or not.
'Well, while you were smirking at your

"A baby?" One of his brothers mumbled to himself, eyebrows frown. Yet it didn't take long for him to understand, and his mouth fell open, his eyes growing wide. Just like all his other brothers. "A
The boy's table was especially quiet that morning as Draco ate his toast, waited eagerly for the owls to arrive and bring in their letters. A tree branch painted gold was placed upon the dining chamber's tables every Monday morning for the animals to land on, and Draco couldn't keep his eyes off of it. 'If you stare any longer at that thing it might disappear,' André pointed out. He himself had never really been interested about what his parents wrote him — quite the opposite to his brother who was always just as eagerly waiting as Draco for his letters to arrive.
"Let me help," a voice to his left then proposed — a voice so soft and delicate that Harry almost didn't catch it. Realizing it couldn't come from any other than the boy, Harry turned his head towards him again — but found him no longer there. Instead, the boy stood on his other side — so suddenly, as if he'd teleported himself there. His pale gaze grazed past Harry's before his irises turned white again, pointing themselves at the woman. Her blue eyes got instantly drawn to them like magnets, and Harry had no clue of what happened next. Their gaze only lasted a few seconds, but during those seconds it had felt as if the world around him had stopped. There hadn't been any noise, there hadn't been any movement.
Harry knows this is the room where Voldemort used to discuss all his sinister plans with his followers; it's almost as if he can still hear his snake-like voice whisper commands and shout Crucios at innocents he held captive.
of other years and will call their names one by one. If your name is chosen, please remain at you table after dinner as well. Let's begin.'
He greeted them back while guiding them to the door; it was time to face the rain and make a run for the bathroom. 'Remember; straight up the stairs and then to the left. Wait in the hallway on the first floor until all girls and myself have arrived.
," the boy interrupted him, still holding a little smile.
“I know I don't look exactly alive, but I most certainly still am. And still would like to be,” Malfoy says to him. Again, his words come out in whispers. And before Harry has time to react to those words, a few tears roll over Malfoy's cheeks, leaving glittering trails behind.
, he thought again. And apparently Hermione thought so too. 'He didn't call me '
'What was it that Dumbledore wanted to discuss with you?' Harry then asked. He had seen Dumbledore say a few last words to Draco when Slughorn's memory had ended; he himself drawing his head back out of the blue liquid of the pensieve. Dumbledore had seated himself on the edge of his desk; his body hunched close to Draco as they had discussed something in whispers. At the sight of Harry, however, Draco had immediately shut his mouth and casted his eyes away. Were they perhaps keeping something a secret from him? Had it something to do with Draco's nightly trips to the seventh floor? And why wasn't Harry allowed to know anything?
Hermione's back straightened, brows furrowing. "I think you're being unreasonable, Ron," she said evenly, casting another glance in Harry's general direction. "Besides, you shouldn't talk about him behind his back. Other people might be listening."
Harry located an empty apartment at the back of the train and slipped inside, slamming the door before anyone could notice where he had gone. To be safe, he pulled his invisibility cloak from his pocket and draped it over himself, curling up in the corner and tracing a finger over the worn seats. He wondered, absentmindedly, if any of his dead friends had sat here. Had Lavendar Brown made this tea stain, had Colin Creevy carved the "CC" on the wood paneling of the window?
Harry lowered his, Ron did not. Hermione whirled around and fixed him with a glare so scorching that Harry could have sworn a few sparks burst from her eyes. "Ronald Weasley," she said, her voice low and dangerous, "Put your wand down."
Pansy laughed, but it was cut short. "I don't say this often, but I'm sorry."
"For anything. For the Battle. For Lavender. For…" she touched the badger pin, looking down shyly. "I don't blame you. I…" she shrugged. "It seemed like you needed to hear that. Not from me, but from someone."
Harry was immediately stifled as a bushy-haired Hermione jumped into his lap, giving him a tight hug.
Pansy gave him a strange look, but didn't bother commenting on Harry's examination of the broom. "Take a pair of dragon-hide gloves," she said, tossing him a spare pair, "that thing will stab you like a bastard."
Harry slid into his normal seat, too distracted to care about the scowl Ron fixed him with. Hermione straightened herself awkwardly, taking a tentative bite of her sandwich.
The other portraits shifted a little, but remained blissfully asleep. Severus raised an eyebrow at McGonagall, who was now tearing through Transfiguration books.
Harry looked up at him. His breathing was heavy, labored, and Draco's heart sunk as he examined his eyes for any sort of sympathy, any trace of the Boy Who Lived.
"I spent the summer at Shell Cottage," Luna said, her sing-song voice tainted with a strained sort of edge. "Helping Bill and Fleur relocate displaced magical creatures."
"Not really," Harry admitted, which was true. "You?"
The Great Hall was absolutely buzzing with activity, at least on the part of the younger students. "Children," Luna said, head in the clouds, "have such a talent to ignore disaster."
"I can't believe I ever thought you were brave," Ron muttered, kicking his trunk open to grab his pajamas. "You're a cowardly snake. Just like Malfoy, and Goyle, and Voldemort."
"Albus!" McGonnagal's voice pierced through the comforting, shrouded aura of the Sorting Hat's voice, bringing Harry back to Earth. He panicked, removing the Sorting Hat quickly, and shoved it back into the bookcase. He suddenly wished that he hadn't given Pansy and Malfoy his invisibility cloak-- he was forced to sweep himself behind the folds of the curtain, peeking out around the edge to observe McGonagall.
Harry stuck to the exterior walls, with their windows that let in just enough light to read his map. Draco was alone-- that gave Harry quite a bit of confidence. Out of curiosity, he looked for Ron and Hermione and saw that they were both in the library. Hermione was practically running up and down an aisle, and Ron was standing at the end, watching.
"Right," Harry said, raising his hand halfway as a goodbye. Ron pursed his lips into what Harry could reasonably assume was meant to be a smile before taking a few backward steps (he nearly tripped over his robes, which Harry decided not to laugh at), and then scurrying away.
Harry looked surprised by this. "Really?" He asked, a tiny smile at the corner of his mouth. "Trying to lure me out to kill me?"
Harry bit his lip. "Uh… a map."
"No, Luna--" Harry said, sitting up and turning around. Cho stood in front of him, wearing her plain Ravenclaw robes. A tiny badger pin was fastened to the knot of her tie. "It's been a while," Harry said, unsure of where to take a conversation with her.
"Yeah," Harry said drily, "me too."
For a moment, Harry wondered what they could be doing. Was Hermione running after a book that had decided to fly away, or was she searching for the perfect text? Was Ron really standing there doing nothing, or was he holding a net in case something tried to escape? Harry's heart let out a little pang-- not for any fault of Draco's, but just watching his friends be happy without him. It wouldn't be the first, and certainly not the last, time.
"Potter," a familiar voice drawled. Harry, startled, glanced up, to see the imposing figure of Draco Malfoy. He stood awkwardly, wand rolling in one hand, the other's long fingernails picking at the side of his robes. "Why are you in the dungeons?"
"I don't think anyone wants to talk right now," Luna deadpanned, twisting her cork necklace.
"No," Harry shook his head again. "I'm really tired. Yeah--" he feigned a rather unconvincing yawn-- "really tired. 'Night, Pansy. Dra--Malfoy."
"Draco," Harry finally said, and Draco drew away, wiping his eyes off with his sleeve. "Why tell me this now?"
"That new professor is a blithering idiot," she complained, slamming the books shut. Harry crept out from behind the curtain, and yes, Snape's portrait's eyes were definitely on him, now. Snape pursed his lips and gave him a curt nod before continuing, drawing McGonnagal's attention away from Harry and back to Snape's portrait.
Draco wrenched his eyes open and considered the second option. Tell Harry-- The Boy Who Lived, the Dark Lord's nemesis, the boy who made him feel inadequate for years, of his plight. Go to Dumbledore-- Harry would definitely drag him by the ear to his office to confess-- or to Snape, beg for them to protect him and his family. Let loose his secrets-- God, the possibility was delicious, he would finally be able to rest.
Harry traced a finger over the mysterious stain, wondering again if it was Lavender who had spilled it. "What was it like?" He asked suddenly, drawing his hand away to rest awkwardly on his lap.
"Potter," Draco said, shoving his emotions into the pit of his stomach. "Shrieking Shack, midnight. Don't tell anyone, least of all Weasel or Granger."
"I'm sorry you had to go through that," Harry said, and he thought that maybe he meant it.
"It was alright."
"Anytime, Harry," she said, without meeting his eyes. She swept away, down to her group of Ravenclaw friends.
"Don't you want to talk with anyone?" Ron asked, gesturing over to Dean and Seamus. Neville, looking somewhat crestfallen, glumly talked with a tired-looking Luna.
"No," Harry said, "I think I'll go to bed, actually."
Harry's interactions with Pansy had grown easier-- she was surprisingly nice to be around, and nearly as intelligent as Hermione (if a little full of herself), and he had at least become acquaintances with Malfoy. While he certainly wouldn't consider him a friend, Malfoy was at least friendlier to him than Ron.
"No need to be hostile," Hermione's voice chimed in. She was somewhere from beyond where Harry could see without moving. "We're just looking for Harry."
"Ron," Hermione squeaked, "I feel for you, I really do, but I don't think we should talk about--"
"Excited for double Potions, you two?" Hermione asked, pouring herself a glass of pumpkin juice.
Harry nodded, his face turning serious again. "Alright, Draco. Midnight."
"McGonnagal snuck past us," Pansy said, "I was going to send you a signal, but it was too late." She looked shockingly apologetic about the whole thing.
"Am I some sort of pity project for your hero complex?"
"No," Harry lied. "I would have won, anyways, if--"
"Well, good luck, Harry," Hermione said, and Ron nodded.
Harry could count on one hand the number of words Ron had said to him. These three words were "
"Well?" Malfoy asked, taking the Invisibility Cloak off and handing it to Harry. "What did it say?"
"It's like I said, Harry is an insufferable twat." Ron kicked the wall, just a little too close to where Harry was hidden. He lept away, nearly catching himself on a nearby torch. "I tried to listen to him, I really did. I don't know why we're even friends with him."
, Harry was so
"Yeah--" Ron introjected, but Hermione cut him off, sticking a finger into his chest.
Hermione sighed. "Sure they are, Harry." She put another fake smile on and handed him a slip of parchment. "Anyway, I took the liberty of taking yours for you."
"I am not mooching!" Harry yelled, even though he didn't exactly believe it himself. "I--" he stumbled, struggling to find his words. Ron didn't seem to want to wait for him.
"I'm not going to solve your problem," she said, "but Harry, you need to apologize."
"She goes to Hogsmeade," Harry said, remembering the many late evenings he had spent studying the Marauder's Map, "on Saturday evenings. Filch usually patrols the dungeons around that time. As long as we get the password--"
No sooner had he closed his eyes, praying that he could pass out and forget the day when Ron burst in.
Harry flushed. "You don't have to answer," he said, looking down. Harry supposed that, inadvertently, it may have been his fault that Malfoy had been imprisoned.
Ron opened and closed his mouth a few times.
"I don't want to deal with Ron," Harry admitted with a shrug.
"Thanks to you, Harry," he said, grinning a little and offering his hand. Harry shook, slightly embarrassed at the sweatiness of his palms. "I think Felix is wearing off now, but before it does," he turned to Pansy, "d'you think my old Comet's still in the changing room?"
. For a moment, Harry allowed himself to fantasize about what would happen if he got the Stone back. ⅔ a Master of Death, and if he dug the shattered Elder Wand from the bottom of the lake, tried repairing it, maybe he could become immortal once again.
Harry sighed, trying to push down his emotions. Here he was, once again, outside Platform 9 ¾, preparing for his eighth and final year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. So much had changed since he had first faced the brick wall. So many people lost. Mrs. Weasley put a hand on his shoulder-- he was staying with Ron, for the time being, seeing as the Dursleys didn't want anything to do with him-- and gave it a comforting squeeze.

"Have we?" Ron snapped, white-knuckling his copy of
Draco didn't exactly feel like giving a detailed explanation, and, thankfully, Harry didn't seem to want one. Instead, he stood up off the bed and took a step towards Draco, hands hovering above Draco's arms. When the blond didn't move away, Harry wrapped him in a hug, pulling Draco close to his warm chest.
Ron blinked up, mouth wrapped around another chicken leg. "Uh-- yeah," he said, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
, figured you wouldn't be using it anytime soon, what with--" she took a quick glance at Harry, then back at Malfoy, and finally shrugged. "Just figured…"
Neither Harry nor Ron elected to reply, both of them glowering down at their plates. Hermione tapped her fingers anxiously on the table, and Harry couldn't help but feel bad for her.
"It's only been a few months, Hermione," Ron said, his nose twitching a little at the sight of Hermione practically sitting on Harry's lap. It wasn't like he and Hermione were official, by any means, and so Harry assumed it had less to do with Hermione's behavior and more to do with the fact that it was with him.
"You are the one who hired her…" Snape's voice faded away as Harry crept down the stairs, which shifted smoothly and silently as he reached the bottom. It was as though a rock had been ejected from his stomach-- and then shoved back down his throat as he realized he hadn't gotten a single answer.
The question was abrupt, and Draco stalled for a moment, staring into Harry's eyes with alarm, before ultimately deciding that it wasn't an unwelcome idea. "Okay," he said, "fair warning, I don't have much practice."
He grabbed the end of his sleeve and pulled it up to his elbow. There it was, the Dark Mark, black, twisted ink. It had been months since Draco got it, but he could still feel the occasional sting-- the initial pain was nothing he had ever felt before, not even when he was Crucio'd by his Aunt Bellatrix as a child, and it haunted him.
Harry threw his head back in annoyance. "Double Potions?" He complained, re-checking the parchment as if it would suddenly change, "with Slytherin?"
The next few weeks at Hogwarts passed without much fanfare. Ron and Harry weren't speaking, and all the time Harry had previously allocated to spending time with his friends was now spent with Pansy and occasionally Draco, mainly on the Quidditch Pitch. Pansy was a better Seeker than both of them combined, but she couldn't play any cooperative position to save her life. Draco seemed to have an affinity for playing Keeper, surprisingly, and Pansy and Harry would often spend their evenings trying to get a score on him.
Draco remained calmness himself compared to Harry whom climbed out of the Lake in an angry fashion. 'It's not working! It nearly drowned me!' he shouted at Draco.
Draco nodded again. 'But I don't really mind, Madame,' he heard Fleur's voice call out. A weak smile graced her face as she looked from Madame back to Draco. 'Draco's happiness is just as important as the Tournament,
The Ministry Day, as everyone had called it, had come August the twelfth and Arthur had brought Harry to the Ministry. It had been a normal choice for him to do so as he worked there and knew one or two things about the Muggle world. At least, so Harry had thought. He had laughed a lot when he hadn't known how to use a metro card and at his enthusiasm for using the visitor's entry for the first time. Harry had been amazed by the Ministry's atrium but got hurried down corridors and hallways as they had found out his trial would be taking place in only a few minutes instead of an hour. It had been Draco's idea to go earlier than mentioned; he had warned Harry that the Ministry could play an ugly game when it came to trials. And so his advice had helped them to arrive in time.
'See what, exactly?' His mother asked, hysterically throwing her hands in the air before realizing her posture and raising her chin a little.
Draco thought his plan had worked out greatly as he entered the carriage, the twins by his side ready to go home as well. 'So you're not
But as Harry pulled his face away from him and stared at Draco with his beautiful green eyes, it seemed like all life flowed back into Draco's body. He broke free from Harry's grip and placed his cold hands around Harry's neck, his fingers sliding into the boy's hair. He pulled Harry closer to him again, their noses brushing and their lips again as well. As he deepened the kiss, he felt their tongues touch and it sent butterflies right back into his stomach. They fluttered violently at the pace of his heart as he heard the boy gasp for breath. Harry's kisses were so clumsy yet they felt so right. They radiated a warmth that spread throughout Draco's entire body and made it seem like he was floating. Adrenaline flowed through his veins in an amount he had never felt before, and he couldn't help but feel his body react to every time he touched an inch of Harry's skin with his own. Hesitantly, Harry pulled his face away and stared into Draco's eyes. Maybe a little confused but most definitely excited.
'Yet why does it feel like I'm the cause of it all?' Harry replied, biting his teeth and unsure of how to feel.
in those clothes and I can't have my boyfriend walking around like that.'

Ron huffed as he sat down on the chair next ti her. Draco sighed and closed the book he was reading. 'Ron, I know it's hard to believe but I care about Harry as well.'
' to too many things. That's mainly because I always got refused everything when I was a child,' Potter says. 'But I'm happy I at least have him.'
“Wouldn’t know where to go. At least, not without you that is.”
, Draco thought to himself.
'Yes,' another voice now added. Cho Chang came into the picture — still making a certain feeling of jealousy and anger well up inside of Draco's chest. 'It belonged to the founder of Ravenclaw. But it's lost, Luna. No-one has seen in it years.'
“I’d say guarding you is about all that there is to it. Of course I have my powers, I can fly, I can communicate with my brothers and other immortals from the beyond — but I don’t think there’s anything more to it, no.” Draco shook his head, lifting his shoulders slightly again as if Harry'd just asked about the weather and he'd answered with 'sunny as always', or something alike. It didn't quite add up in Harry's mind, but he tried his best to understand.
'A date?' Draco heard a certain confusion in Harry’s voice and it confused himself slightly as well. 'I don't have a date. I wanted to ask
. Laughing of hundreds of Death Eaters followed. A grim atmosphere. Draco's mind a blank canvas as he crawled up again, still shaking and wobbling on his feet. Another leap forwards — hands holding him back as a flurry of desperate aggression overcame him.
'I can't, professor — you're too weak to be left alone. We must go to madam Pomfrey or—'
' is the right description for it.'

But their moment of victory got disrupted quite fast again as Dumbledore and Voldemort came closer to them, destroying the atrium's statue in their way and making it clatter to pieces on the tiled floor. Harry and his friends had to jump away to not get hit by gold, their hands on their heads as they waited for it all to be over. Voldemort produced a snake of fire from his wand, filling the whole room with burning flames. The heat was almost too much to handle but fortunately Dumbledore extinguished the flames with water before anyone could get burned by it, their clothes now soaking wet as they crawled to their feet and tried to find a better place to hide.
'So?' Harry raised an eyebrow and saw Ron do the same. 'Do you mean him warning me about the fact that something was going to happen? Because something already
'Well, Harry didn't

But he was slow, his so-called hurrying nothing more than tiny baby steps. The burning of his scars were slowing him down. It took only a second for his father to stop him from nearing the door, from nearing freedom, a hand pressed against his chest. 'Draco, you are acting like a child.'
of him; his twin-brother Ansel was the
Draco thought while touching the skin above his right eyebrow. He saw his cheeks turn pink while thinking of the boy and his green eyes. And he had been so kind to retrieve Draco's scarf from the ground, handing it back to him with that nervous smile of his. Or when he was sitting there, amongst his friends in the Great Hall smiling brightly with a blue butterfly on his nose. It made Draco's heart flutter, his stomach turn around. He shook his head, watching his mirrored reflection do the same.
'Harry! Hermione! Ron!' Voices shouted, picking up their earlier noise. No-one seemed to welcome Draco though, but he got a few glares to make up for it. Had they still not realized that he was nothing alike to his father? That he wasn't to be associated to the Dark Lord?
What an awful plan it had sounded in Draco's ears. Enchanted in a deep sleep but completely safe… as if Draco had been able to believe that. He had sulked while throwing vile glares at each of the irresponsible adults in front of him before demanding five minutes to at least go to the bathroom before they would unwillingly put him asleep. Of course Draco hadn't needed to go to the bathroom; he saw it as his opportunity to tell Harry about the gillyweed. He had only found out about it the night before while reading in his new plant book. Already on one of the first pages he had stumbled upon it and while reading its description, had known it was what they had been looking for all along.
It was around three in the afternoon, a popular hour for students to hang around the Goblet and take a look at whom was brave enough to participate in the Tournament. Because of that, it was no surprise that when they entered the Great Hall in their small blue group, all eyes were immediately fixed upon them. Draco took a step aside to let Fleur take the lead. She gave him a look with her eyes, telling him how nervous she actually felt as she strode through the Hall with a smile on her face. Draco waited a few feet away from the Goblet, taking in its surrounding blue light and the glowing circle that was the age line. He noticed a duo of red haired boys hovering around the Goblet, studying the age-restricting spell in great detail. They immediately reminded him of Ansel and André; mischievous but a quite cute to look at.
to do such thing.
Dumbledore sighed again, this time very much audible and patted Draco's shoulder. 'I agree with that fact, Draco. It will only be alright once he is defeated, but do know that you are not fighting this battle alone. Harry is a greater pion in this game than you may think… and so are a lot of others. You will have to believe that there is another way; that you're not alone. And when it comes to sides; I know that you will always be on ours, Draco; no matter what task Riddle gives you.'
Is it possible that the War happened exactly five years ago? What day was it again? Draco doesn't know. All days just seem to follow each other endlessly…
Draco turned himself to Harry with a questioning look; he didn't remember Harry telling him anything about saving Arthur Weasley in his letters. 'Later,' Harry whispered to him, understanding the question hidden beneath his grey eyes.
Three sugar cubes disappear in the hot water again, the peacock on the china cup slightly shaking its head in disgust. It makes Potter snort and Draco look up in confusion.
It's true; Malfoy would've been the best student in every class as it wasn't for Hermione. Hermione out stood him in most classes expect for potions. It must have been hard for Malfoy to deal with the fact that a
Mortified, Draco pulls his arm away from her and gets up from his seat as fast as he can. His eyes are slowly filling up with tears from the pain. When was the last time his arm hurt this bad? "I'm fine,' he manages to say, 'I think I'm going back to my room. I'm not feeling so well."
. Draco stood in his place, wobbling on his feet, ready to fall down with his hands pressed against his chest and his wand fallen to the floor. Still in shock but aware of Draco falling backwards, almost going after Dumbledore, Harry bolted forward and took ahold of Draco's hand which he desperately reached out. It was covered in blood for some reason Harry didn't understand, and as he saved Draco by a hair from falling down — he saw how the French immediately collapsed onto the floor. 'Draco!' he finally managed to get out as he fell to his knees. It almost seemed as if a giant blade had sliced through Draco's body; leaving gigantic scars behind and blood simply everywhere.
Memories returned to him — memories of which he wasn't sure were even his. It were his hands, it was his reflection in the mirror, his voice — yet it didn't seem to be truly him whom did and said all those things. He wanted to apologize again, but quickly understood it wasn't his fault, but that of the thing Harry was holding onto so dearly.
Surrounded by his ginger- and curly-haired friends, Harry beamed from across the courtyard. He was laughing again, Draco noticed. And he deserved it. From the moment the green-eyed boy had obtained the Golden Egg; everyone that had been against him had become his biggest fan. They’d all seemed to realize that Harry should've been

to talk about his magazine at a wedding. 'Perhaps not, yet I still want mister Potter to know.'
Draco shook his head. 'I-I have a lot on my mind.'
‘N-not my face, not m-my face...’ he whispers to himself, grabbing for his neck with his hands.
Same goes for you, Harry.’
in French!'
The atmosphere of the pub could've been described as cozy and welcoming, yet it made Draco feel
'I was thinking about you,' he says. A breath leaves his mouth, one he didn't know he was holding in.
The day of the first task had arrived, making everyone chat loudly in the Great Hall during breakfast. Breakfast itself had never been so grant; offering all kinds of desserts and pastries for everyone to devour. Draco didn't feel hungry, though. Neither did Fleur. They sat side by side, staring at all the delicious goods with a nauseous feeling in their stomachs.
?' he then asked, even more worried than before.
"What?"
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Draco frowns. 'How do you mean disappointing me? You found that book, didn't you?'
'Why are you giving up so fast?' he almost shouted to the man.
Then something strange had happened to Draco; a complete stranger had approached him and grabbed him by the wrist while on his way back to the Gryffindor common room. He had gone off to the library alone after dinner, with the promise of trying to search for more clues of whom the Half-Blood Prince could be. He had left rather soon after once again a failed attempt at finding anything at all. First Draco had thought it was a student who wasn't happy to have him at Hogwarts; whom had been suspecting him of being a Death Eater like his father. But it had quickly turned out to be quite the opposite.
, he kept telling himself, but the words sounded fake. Hesitant, he took a step forward again and opened his eyes. Harry was still looking at him, a desperate expression readable on his face. Draco knew Harry would jump off the dragon any second now; unable to leave Draco behind again.
Squinting his eyes now slightly, Harry gave him a funny look. "You seem to know a lot about me, don't you?"
'So, you walked all day and night?' Hermione then asked, leaning close to Harry to be able to look into his eyes but Harry didn't let her. He nodded, even though he knew it was totally impossible he and Draco had been casually walking for hours on end. 'You're such a liar, Harry. Why don't you just tell us where you really were? Is it that big of a secret?'
, Harry, you’re underestimating a Witch’s powers.
‘But I don’t think it’ll be helpful in my case.’
'Why do you even care?' Why
Slowly but surely, Harry's face turned the shade of a tomato. "Y-you can read my mind?" A nod of his head followed. "Have you been reading it the entire time?" Another nod. "W-why?"
Draco piled another book on top and Harry read the title just as confused. '
'And when was that exactly?' Ron asked.
, he thinks to himself. If
. A mistake. I should go back, I-'
The twins their attention seemed to be drawn by Draco's words and their hungry eyes for gossip shot from Harry to his friends, their clawing hands taking ahold of Luna and Ron — Hermione, Ginny and Neville jumping away just a second fast enough. Luna didn't seem to mind but Ron rather seemed to feel uncomfortable; pulling a face and glancing at Hermione for help. Seeing it as his one and only chance; Draco pulled Harry away from the others and dragged him a bit further down the hallway — in the direction of Madame's door.
Wasting no more time, he firecalls his friends. Ron and Hermione's living room appears within seconds; a cozy space similar to the Gryffindor common room. Hermione's sitting on the couch, baby Rose in her arms. She jumps a little at seeing Harry's head appear in the fire but relaxes quickly.
Ravenclaws liked to talk a lot, Draco noticed. Only seated for a few seconds he already got loaded with questions;
Some students were seated at round tables, decorated with ice sculptures of snow angels and others were standing upright around a silver glittering dance-floor. The professors were eagerly awaiting the Champions on the other side of the Great Hall and Draco felt his heart skip a beat as all their eyes, including those of all the students fell upon him and Harry. Side by side.
You have two boyfriends now, Harry?' His friends laughed even louder as they took a peek at the letter over Dudley's shoulder. 'He writes that you're in danger. I don't know about that, but I know that his letter is.' Without hesitation Dudley tore the letter in two, the sound of it's rupture welling up the anger Harry had tried to suppress so greatly.
'I thought you wouldn't push me anymore!' he shouted, giving Draco a vile look. Noticing that Draco wasn't holding his timepiece either, seemed to make the boy even more furious. 'And you weren't even timing me? What's wrong with you today? Have you finally given up on this
A clicking sound followed as he remained frozen to the spot, his heart beating in his ears as he knew all too well to whom that voice belonged to. His bedroom door swung open and revealed a tall boy, dressed in blue silk from head to toe with a golden wand at hand. A grey eye glanced at him from underneath a hat and a grin graced his lips especially for Harry to see. 'Draco,' Harry stammered, not quite believing that he was actually there.
!' Draco shouted back, making Harry laugh as they zoomed further through the night sky.

Hadn't it all led up to that moment; the moment he would become one of

. With the greatest effort he crawled upright again, glanced at Harry whom had hurriedly ran to his bed to get a blanket and pillow for Draco —
A smirk appeared on Draco's face as he realized what was bothering the poor boy. ‘Before you ask silly questions that will turn your head the color of
‘It does,
'You saw me there, hiding behind trees and following Madame and Hagrid through the forest,
As Harry went up the few more steps that were left, he saw that Dumbledore had disappeared out of sight — his figure gone as if swallowed by the dark night. The blond boy from before was looking down through the arched opening, at the grounds beneath the tower with shocking shoulders.
with him?'
. 'I got the same one,' Draco said, pulling the medallion from underneath his jumper and showing it to Harry. The boy only smiled, lost for words as he stared at the little gift in his hand again.
As she strode away again, Potter seemed to have frozen on the spot; probably mesmerized by Fleur's beauty and their enchanted words in French. 'I must go now, but I am sure we will have more time to talk soon,
, written by Rita Skeeter — an awful woman Draco remember all too well.
Literally stunned by this information, Harry's mind came to a halt. He couldn't think for a second nor could he speak. Never had he heard anyone talk about his parents before — besides the one or two times his aunt and uncle had brought them up, only to bring them down with their vile words and lies. Never had he thought he'd hear stories about them, know more than one or two things. Yet here he was, talking to an angel sent by God — hearing tales from him. After what felt like long, slow minutes, he finally found his voice again. "My parents had a Guardian angel as well?"
Draco clenched his jaw, wanted to grab his wand but noticed it was still a few feet away from him; still laid deserted between the remainders of a castle’s pillar. He swallowed, felt lost for just a second before realizing he didn’t need a wand to defend himself. If he wanted to, he could use the magic of his soul.
It keeps raining. May; an entire month of rain. A pool of cold liquid, a pool of tears. June announces itself with a few bird's songs but more drops and no sign of nearing heat. Summer must still be on some holiday because it isn't showing itself. At least, not yet.
"Complicated how?"
The Healer didn't know what to say; still shocked from the sudden appearance of Harry Potter, savior of the Wizarding World.
A small room he had never entered before; the walls painted a shade of lilac and a small bed pushed against a crooked window. Photographs of Fleur and Bill on the room's dresser — and one of Draco amidst them as well. Harry immediately hurried himself to that exact photograph; had to see it from up close as if it was Draco himself that was standing there. With his chin held up high as Draco usually did and dressed in Beauxbatons' uniform, he stood beside Fleur and her little sister with great pride. 'Do you have any photographs of him?' Fleur asked, joining Harry and glancing at the photo herself.
'So what? Every person that wears the Gryffindor colors is a friend of mine.'
Harry then pointed a finger towards the ceiling; towards the sky. "I thought you had brothers up there — other angels?"
"Thank you, Draco," Harry told him, and Draco briefly let his eyes meet with Harry's.
Potter wasn't wearing his Auror robes like last time but had traded them for a pair of jeans and an oversized t-shirt. Something about the man and his oversized clothes made Draco think that Potter wasn't capable of properly dressing himself. A stupid smile was visible on his face, too grin-like to be genuine. Draco's hands were itching to just slap the bastard right in the face to make it disappear, but a little voice in his head murmured that Potter looked quite… cute, smiling like that.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
; Malfoy is right in his face.
A sigh escaped Draco's lips. He took off his beret and let his hair fall loose upon his shoulders. Silver waved over his chest and he stroke the strands with his fingers. Raphael observed him from across the room, face resting upon his single hand again. The portrait seemed to mimic Draco's tired eyes and after taking a deep breath, Draco decided it was better to get some sleep. Tomorrow was another day, he told himself for a second time. Raphael's portrait already swung aside at Draco's nearing presence, not saying a word to him. Flower boy might've also been disappointed in his actions.
? I was invited by Hermione Granger,' he told her.
Castor opened one of its doors and peeked inside. A few cursing words followed as he leaned closer, his face and arms disappearing inside to return a few seconds later with the bird Draco had given to him dead in his hands. 'It's bloody dead,' he called out as he shoved the poor bird into Draco's hands.
'And it is not for you to decide wether or not those rules are
glad to see him again.
'So where are you going with this? Is there someone inside Azkaban that murdered all the Death Eaters in secret or something?' Harry starts to lose his nerve. Could Ron please just come to the point?
. 'Alright,' the boy then said. 'I'll stay.'
inch of you.' The most wonderful smile Draco had ever seen graced the boy's face shortly after, and he wasn't able to say anything more.
The heavy doors of the Manor get opened by a house-elf with big blue eyes. Harry could swear those eyes were the same color as Ron's, but didn't dare to make a comment about it as his best friend didn't really seem to be in the mood to be compared to Malfoy's house elf.
his patronus,' Draco told him.
what a joke it all seems. Of course he could've stayed in a relationship with Ginny, but after the war it just didn't feel right. They both had their own big dreams and ideas for the future, and somehow, they didn't match. And secretly, Harry doesn't even know if he even truly loved her. Or at least, not in the right way or in the way he should have.

'Then stay.'
'No, I mean the other thing. About the lion?'
Disclaimer: I don't own anything Harry Potter. Also this is my first ever Drarry/Magical fic and my Mother language also isn't English so please excuse any mistakes I made.
Everyone grew quiet as their eyes got pointed at Draco again — curious to know the answer to the question. 'Well, the Dark—
, I hope not…'
‘Gryffindor-ish?’
His first attempt failed, and the locket swung aggressively from left to right. Draco didn't seem to notice for once though, seemed to focus on squeezing the air out of Harry's body. Another grab at the locket, and this time he snatched it off Draco's thin neck. Draco froze, and the blond immediately let go, fell down upon Harry like a stone statue.
'Yes, later indeed, my boy. For now, a toast and presents, please!' Arthur announced, taking ahold of his wine glass with a shaking hand and raising it a few inches from the table. 'Merry Christmas.'
About an hour after his arrival by the Lake, just at the moment when Draco thought he might freeze into an ice sculpture if he had to wait any longer, he saw footsteps appear in the muddy ground in front of him. An invisible person was making his way towards him, step by step. Draco smiled brightly as Harry appeared only a few seconds later, invisibility cloak clutched in his hands and himself wrapped in the thickest jacket Draco had ever seen. Apparently the boy from the tales wasn't made for cold weather either.
A bit hesitant Harry opened the front door, whispers following shortly after. He immediately looked around, took in the place he had just entered. The hallway was dark, the wallpaper tearing off slowly as if spirits were trying to crawl from behind it. He flinched slightly when Draco closed the door behind them, the loud sound interrupting his observations. A few portraits were hung against the walls, Wizards and Witches dressed in black throwing glares at him. He flinched once again when Draco hit something, grumbled French words as he kicked something that looked like a troll's foot only to hurt his toe again.
With his curiosity triggered, Draco moved a little closer to Harry to be able to read the small script that Harry now pointed out. 'Property of the Half-Blood Prince?' Draco read out loud.
There was something about Draco that felt so intimidating at that moment; perhaps the way he could basically
‘I can assure you that it isn’t — though I question the same thing a lot as well,’ he answered. Of course it often felt like a dream; was anyone supposed to be this happy? But then the raven-haired boy remembered all he had been through in the past years, and decided that he truly deserved to be as happy as he was. Draco smiled, gestured for Harry to lay down on the bed again. ‘I can’t, I only have five minutes left to make it to class — and it’s on the other side of the castle.’
,' she started, always calling her students that way, 'I have some great news to share with all of you. This year,
— D.M. —
Harry turned around to face Draco and nodded. 'I share a room with the other Gryffindor boys from my year, but I'm quite used to it by now.'
He had to stop; catch for breath and focus his mind. He tried to listen for any movement, but the beating of his heart in his ears made the quiet grounds around him sound loud and busy. How badly he wished he was now the one to have a timepiece that would lead him to Harry.
The wall behind Malfoy's bed displays the cycle of the moon, painted in a crescent shape, almost like a grotesque rainbow. And as Harry's observing this wall, Malfoy clears his throat a little too loud. Obviously drawing Harry's attention, the git points at the two uncomfortable chairs and sits down in one of them himself. Harry follows his example, but jumps almost immediately off his chair again as Malfoy draws his wand. At least, his Mother's wand.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Interest triggered, Harry's eyes grew wide. "Can you show me?" Eagerly, he blinked a few times with that wide gaze of his, but the boy shook his head.
'You kept glancing over at the Forbidden Forest, Harry,' Draco admitted with a smile. Not only clever anymore; also extremely observant.
‘Because they suddenly stopped sulking doesn’t mean I don’t want you around anymore, Draco. And they can help me in different ways; Hermione with her books and Ron... by being Ron I suppose.’
"Right," Hermione said, clenching her mouth shut, cheeks burning. Harry gave her knee an encouraging squeeze, which she ignored. The rest of the ride to the castle was incredibly awkward, the silence weighing over everyone heavier than
Harry turned. Ron, halfway out the Common Room, was staring at him with a half-guilty, half-puzzled look on his face.
The premise for this chapter is honestly super trite, but I thought it was cute.
This chapter is almost 3,000 words. Hopefully that makes up for the several days of not updating. Fun trivia fact about this series that I just decided right now, Ginny's head is now half-shaved. Yeah, apparently poorly transfigured pygmy puffs get really aggressive once the charms start to wear off, and Arnold took a good chunk out of Ginny's scalp. She's forgiven him, the resulting buzz cut and scar look sick as hell.
The owl came on Thursday afternoon. It was a small one, who seemed well-fed but scrawny. Harry took the time to pet her, for a little bit. She wasn't a snowy owl, but she certainly chirped a lot like Hedwig. Harry detached the roll from her leg before giving her a generous helping of owl treats (he took them from Ron's bedside table, to which Ron simply grunted) and sending her on her way.
"I couldn't--"
"The fact remains," Draco pressed, "that until you barged in on me in the bathroom I was fully intent on fixing that cabinet and killing Dumbledore. It's strange. If my wand wasn't so far away, I would've hexed you and we'd duel and I'd probably never change."
Double potions with Slytherin, and of course Harry is paired with Draco to brew a love potion.
"Yes, yes," Malfoy scowled. "Absolutely disgusting. How did you manage to get your hands on it, Harry?"
Harry shrugged. "Sure." He took a bite of roast beef and immediately felt sick. "Probably going to bed soon."
"Of course they did," Malfoy said, and even though he tried to hide it Harry could still sense the bit of malice in his voice. Pansy coughed uncomfortably as they passed the castle gates.
This was his home. It had always been his home, and regardless of what the Sorting Hat said to him, it wouldn't change his Hogwarts House. And that realization almost made Harry feel-- sad. It wasn't that he didn't love Gryffindor, it was just that this familiar dorm room was strangely quiet, cold, sad. Dean and Seamus were often snogging in a broom closet somewhere, Neville was too busy staring vacantly out windows to talk much, and Ron's energy was either hostile or indifferent.
"Should we go to dinner, then?" Pansy asked. "I heard it's shepherd's pie tonight."
As Harry continued to stand, flanked by Ron and an assortment of Weasleys, he felt his stomach sink. People were looking at him, whispering. "Potter!" someone called, "Harry Potter! Blimey! Harry!" The whispers picked up, and a curious crowd began to gather.
"You're both being stupid," Hermione said, her voice raising an octave. "Why don't you--" she blinked, as though overtaken by some mysterious force, and smiled. "Fine. I'll see what I can grab."
** -- You need blood/hair to seal Amortentia to someone, and I didn't mention this because I decided that a love potion will be 'activated' when you add that blood/hair. Will it make an appearance in the story later? Mayhaps!
"I don't want to hear it anymore, Harry." Ron's voice was flat but dangerous. "Just leave me alone." He threw on his pajama top and climbed into his bed, turning away. Within just a minute, he was already loudly fake snoring.
Pansy laughed as she came out from behind the curtain, a towel wrapped around her. "Well, I'm going to take a shower, then," she said, subtly nodding towards the tent door. "You should too."
"Yeah."
Luna put a hand on Harry's forearm. "The Headmistress is looking," she whispered, "you should go back to your table. Nice talking to you, Harry."
"I don't either," Harry admitted, leaning in, "although I'm willing to get in as much practice with you as you would like."
Harry nodded, swallowed thickly, and cast a quick glance up and down the corridor. Pansy and Malfoy were just a bit too big to both fit comfortably over the cloak, but their feet were almost obscured in the shadow cast by the torchlight. Providing that Mrs. Norris didn't come snooping-- and, according to Harry's map, she was in the dungeons with Filch-- the two would remain undetected.
should get going Draco."
"Bloody hell, Harry," Ron said, skidding away, catching a slipping, tattered trunk with a scuffed shoe. The winning of the war didn't exactly boost the Weasley family's salaries, and despite Harry's constant pestering, they refused to accept even a cent of his fortune. At least, Molly and Arthur did. Ron and Ginny always pursed their lips whenever their parents refused, casting pointed glances down to their hand-me-down robes.
When the time on Harry's clock struck 11:30, Harry carefully stood up from bed. He hadn't considered that Ron would come back in, and had lie very still, hoping that if his dormmate returned he would charitably assume Harry had gotten back from an exhausting excursion with Dumbledore. Harry was surprised, pleasantly, that Ron hadn't returned quite yet, and his other mates hadn't given him a second thought.
"Right," Harry nodded awkwardly. "I'll see you around, then." He turned to leave, face burning, when a heavy hand slapped down onto his shoulder.
Harry fumbled for the wand in his pocket, pulling it out with shaky hands. "Back off, Ron," he warned, but the redhead didn't move.
"Brilliant," Harry repeated, his voice sounding dull and echoey, fake even to himself. Ron raised a ginger eyebrow at him. "Spent it at the Burrow," Harry elaborated, "without Ron-- the Weasleys--" he sputtered over his words, face growing red as the carriage stared at him expectantly.
Pansy ducked behind a curtain to change. "Honestly," she said, throwing her sweaty robes in a heap on the ground, "I don't like playing in front of crowds. I get anxious."
Hermione clicked her tongue, rocking back and forth on her heels awkwardly. "Ah-- well, he said that he didn't particularly want to see you today. But!" Hermione put a hand on Harry's shoulder, "Double Potions will certainly bring you closer together. You can make fun of Sna--" Hermione dropped her hand. "Slughorn… you can make fun of Slughorn."
he thought as he stepped into the familiar room.
This chapter has a bit more snarky/self-referential wit in it? I don't know, the last chapter was pretty sad and I decided that it may be cool to lighten things up a bit.
"No need for formalities," she smiled, sliding down the stands. She sat next to Harry, glancing over the Quidditch pitch with a slight scowl.
Harry looked down and bit his lip to stop himself from cursing. Sure enough, just the tip of his scuffed shoe was peeking out from under the cloak-- of course, Malfoy would notice it, Harry hadn't had a new pair of shoes since the end of the fifth year. He had considered asking the Weasleys for new ones, as he had far outgrown the raggedy shoes and they were starting to hurt his feet, but he didn't want to be even more of a burden on them than he already was.
"Why?" Harry asked, and then immediately doubled back. "I mean-- just-- you've never wanted to--"
He thought, for a moment, that a look of hurt crossed Malfoy's face, but it was so fleeting he could have sworn it was just the flicker of the torch. "Right," Malfoy said, turning on the heel of his squeaky-clean shoes. "Best of luck, Potter."
The Sorting Hat, which looked, surprisingly, a bit cleaner than in past years, perked up a bit at this, and Harry shut his ears closed. He didn't want to hear the names of his dead classmates. He almost wished that McGonagal had stuck with the familiar Sorting song, then, perhaps, he could pretend that the war never happened, and for just a moment it was a regular year at Hogwarts.
With a bit of effort, Harry pulled himself from the tight tunnel and landed on the floor, soaked with sweat and covered in dirt. Draco, looking clean and haughty as ever, sized him up warily.
Thanks so much for reading!
Hermione laughed. "For you. I have History of Magic with Ravenclaw. Although--" she shuddered a bit, "I don't particularly fancy the idea of being with a ghost for a while. Don't want to be reminded of death." She blinked and put on a happy face again. "But at least you'll have Ron!" Her voice cracked on the end of that sentence, and Harry became astutely aware of what was happening.
Malfoy confirmed this when his eyes widened and he quickly dropped his hand away, tucking it into his robe pockets. "Uh. Seeker's game Friday, then?"
"Really?" Harry asked, but when Hermione ignored him, he decided to stop pestering her.
"No," Harry insisted, turning to lock eyes with Pansy. She didn't look as empty as Malfoy, but her face still held a few telltale signs of torturous time with the Dementors. Dark circles under her eyes, a pasty sheen to her skin, rippled fingernails, and a hunched, defensive posture. "You didn't deserve Azkaban."
Ron's shoulders tensed up, and Hermione let out a little click of exasperation-- at Luna, maybe, but more likely at herself. "How about you, Neville?" She asked, whipping her head so fast that her bushy hair hit Harry squarely in the face, nearly knocking off his glasses.
Pansy nodded. "None of us did, really," she said, leaning back, lounging over the bleacher, laying her head back on the row above them. "We were all just accessories to our parents' little war."
"Harry?"
Pansy stuffed the Dungbombs back into her pocket. She looked rather disappointed that they would not be getting used. "Blimey, Harry, how'd you know all of that?"
"We didn't have to save him," Ron muttered, kicking at some unseen thing on the ground. Harry and Hermione shared a tense glance. Ron had not grown fonder of Malfoy in the past few months, despite Harry and Hermione's constant insistence that he wasn't a bad man, that he deserved to be saved, and that despite everything he belonged at Hogwarts.
"I know you're in here, Potter," Malfoy finally stated, refusing to take his gaze off of the rolling hills as they sped by. "Your shoe is sticking out."
"Why didn't you?" Malfoy retorted, a tiny grin at the corner of his mouth. "Are you alright, Potter?" He asked, somewhat genuinely. "You look like a mess."
"Hermione!" He barked, and Hermione jumped, quickly stepping away from Harry's cloaked form.
Harry watched, completely silent under his cloak, as Malfoy swept the interior door over the glass, giving himself some privacy. He lounged, thankfully, on the seat across from Harry, and didn't even jump when the train lurched forward.
It was like Aberforth said, all those years--
"Oh, shut up, Ron," Hermione said, the grin still not leaving her face as she climbed off of Harry's lap, sitting across from him and next to Ron. "Anyway, Harry, I saw Draco leaving the compartment. He's not supposed to be--"
"Oh, god, no!" Pansy said, and Harry couldn't help but feel just a little bit hurt at the tone of Pansy's voice. Pansy immediately launched into retelling the victorious story of her Quidditch win, recounting, in detail, how she had nearly knocked Harry off of his broom when she rolled over him and caught the snitch.
"You know what the dementors are like, Potter," Malfoy said, his voice wavering a little, growing quieter. Harry could see now, more clearly, the darkened circles under Malfoy's eyes, the slightly cloudy look behind his pupils.
"Now, first-years, it is time for the Sorting. In lieu of the Sorting Hat song, I have requested that it list out the name and house of every fallen Hogwarts Student who lost their lives fighting last year. I hope that with these names in your minds, you will bring glory to your house."
"No, you chose not to be--"
So Harry and Malfoy don't interact in this chapter, because I felt like indulging myself in the delicious angst of friends arguing.
"Hey," Malfoy said, and Harry turned around, shocked. Pansy's eyes darted between the both of them, obviously very uncomfortable, and it suddenly occurred to Harry that touching may be a violation of Malfoy's parole.
"I know, Potter," Draco snapped without malice. "I just… I want to forget about it for a while. Clear my head before I go talk to Dumbledore and beg him for his help." Draco's head drooped. "I just want my parents to be safe."
There was almost a minute of silence, before Ron cleared his throat, shifting awkwardly, glancing down at the floor. "I should--" he made a vague gesture towards the hall that Hermione had walked to. "Yeah."
Harry leaned in again, but Draco leaned back.
Ron did not see Harry at lunch.
"Come on, Hermione," Harry pleaded, casting a wary glance down the hall behind him. "I don't want to have to see him."
"Hello, Malfoy," Pansy said from outside, and Harry threw on his robes, practically falling out of the tent. He skidded to a stop in front of Pansy and a very bewildered Malfoy.
Harry pulled on a jumper and draped his invisibility cloak around him, carefully navigating out of the dorm room, nearly tripping over Dean's shoe. He creaked down the stairs, delighted to see that the corridors were mostly empty.
"If it were up to me," Ron continued, slamming his hand onto the table, "he'd be in Azkaban forever, along with the rest of that sorry family."
"I think you already know what's on my wrist," Draco said, and Harry snapped out of his memories to meet Draco's eyes. They were glued to a spot to the side, a deep flush crawling up his neck.
Harry nodded back, curtly, lips pursed. "I will. You'd better leave me before you get in trouble."
"Wonderfully!" Hermione grinned, a fake smile plastered across her face, and Harry could tell that she was lying. Her eyes were dull and underlined with dark circles, and she was a bit more jittery than usual, hands shaking as she held her books.
There, nestled between a globe and a stack of Transfiguration books, was the Sorting Hat, looking astonishingly crumpled and defeated. Harry was tall enough, now, to reach it without difficulty, and he placed it over his head without allowing himself a second to doubt.
"Good morning, Harry!" she said, practically knocking him over as he walked down the stairs to the Common Room. "Sleep well?"
"Yeah," Draco said, leaning back against Harry's shoulder. "Potter--" he paused. "In the interest of transparency, I have to admit something to you."
"Ron," Harry replied, sounding much colder than he meant to. "Um, hello."
For a split second, Harry worried that the hat wouldn't speak. And then, it did, in that same deep, raspy, not-quite-there voice that had announced him a Gryffindor so long ago.
The wizard gave Ginny a rather rotten look, but retracted his hands, promising to write Harry loads of letters about his cousin's Puffskein fighting ring in France. Ginny, noticeably shaken by this, dove a hand into her jumper, where Arnold was curled up next to her chest.
"He wants me to kill Dumbledore," Draco said bluntly, voice coming out in little jumps, cut off by hiccups. "And if I don't, he'll kill me."
Harry ran, out of the Great Hall, down a staircase that had moved sometime over the summer, tripping over the rubble that they hadn't yet managed to fix. He swept his way into the dungeons, running and his eyes were blurry, unsure of where he was going, he ran and ran until he reached a dead end, and then he sunk into the corner and let the tears fall.
"Harry," Draco muttered, pulling away, "why do you have feelings for me? I've been nothing but a dick to you for years."
"So," she said, drumming her fingers on the table, "have anything to say to each other?"
Pansy laughed, and it seemed more genuine, barking and loud, echoing against the other Quidditch stands. "I guess I've just changed a bit, Harry," she laughed. "And I don't think you're as different from me as both of us would like to think."
Harry swallowed, hard, and shook his head a little, willing the thoughts to go away. They didn't-- instead, they grew stronger, pulsating in his mind, growing louder and louder until finally, he thought he couldn't take it anymore. The specifics of the names were lost in his mind, but the imprint still landed-- each person, each child, had died so that he may live.
"He was forced to be," Harry introjected, and Ron looked at him with surprise. It wasn't often that Harry contradicted his best friend. "I mean," Harry said, "he didn't kill Dumbledore. He wasn't a bad man."
"Potter," Draco muttered, his voice shaking with fear, "please." He paused for a second. "You're scaring me, Harry."
," Pansy giggled. "It was
The hat paused for a moment, as if expecting Harry to rip it off. "
"Why didn't you join the Quidditch team?" Harry asked, later in the changing room, absolutely drenched with sweat. Pansy was unlike Malfoy, she didn't play dirty. She played
(See the end of the chapter for
"You were quite the prick," Harry laughed, kissing Draco on the nose and making the pale boy flush almost crimson. "But I always thought you were kind of cute. Rather funny, too, in your own strange way."
"Yeah. Take a couple of Nosebleed Nougat, though, and some Puking Pastilles." He produced a few half-melted, multi-colored, brightly wrapped candies from his pocket and pushed them towards Harry. "Hang on, I think I have a chunk of Fever Fudge in here--" he dug in his pocket for a moment, and the clock rang.
"He's been so distant lately," Harry muttered through a bite of Pumpkin Pasty. It was a bit dry in his mouth, and the Gillywater washed it down his throat in sticky chunks.
Ron shot her a look. "This doesn't concern you, Hermione."
"I'm sorry," Harry said. "I don't know what came over me."
He untied the scroll. A single word, written in Pansy's signature pink-ink cursive, signed with a tiny flower in the corner. Severus.
"I--" Hermione began again in a false chipper tone.
"Still have some pieces of it in my hand," Harry quipped, and
"Hello, Malfoy," Harry said, pulling off his invisibility cloak and stuffing it into his pocket. There was an awkward beat of silence between them. Malfoy lazily turned his gaze away from the window to look Harry up and down, and suddenly Harry felt self-conscious. He hadn't changed much, either-- still had the same messy hair, broken glasses, and crooked teeth still had the same gangly, malnourished body he'd been cursed with since he was a child.
I can't believe I managed to split one day into five chapters. Anyway, not a lot happens in this one, hope you appreciate it anyway.
"I was in Azkaban," Malfoy deadpanned, returning his eyes to meet Harry's. "You?"
* -- I realized that Arnold is actually a pygmy puff, not a puffskein. This may seem like a trivial point, but I decided that hey, maybe there could be some subplot later?
Hermione-- who had managed to get a Ministry internship, and was forced to drop it after receiving the letter-- was somewhat annoyed but seemed generally enthused at the prospect of returning to Hogwarts one final time.
"Sorry, mate," Ron said lamely, and Harry wasn't sure exactly what he was apologizing for.
-- a few wary side-eyes from Slytherin eighth-years who apparently hadn't escaped McGonagall's 'request' to return to Hogwarts.
The next morning, Hermione was somewhat more chipper than usual.
"No," Harry said bluntly, ignoring how harsh it sounded. "I'll get us a compartment, Ron."
"What are you hiding, Malfoy?" Harry circled his thumb on the delicate flesh of Draco's wrist.
"We could ask it," Pansy suggested one evening after Harry shared his concerns. Her, Malfoy, and Harry were all on their way back to the castle after a three-seeker game-- Pansy had won by a landslide, even after Malfoy and Harry teamed up-- and twilight was just beginning to sparkle over the horizon.
Harry ignored him, pushing the sleeve up a little more. In another second, the black ink of the Mark would peek out from Draco's sleeve.
Malfoy's eyes darkened at the idea. "No," he said, with perhaps more finality than was necessary. "I just didn't want to go to the Sorting."
"I'll see if I can find that password," Pansy said, finally breaking the silence as they reached the staircase split. "I'll send you an owl."
It was all his fault. Fred. Lavender. Collin. That second-year. Tonks. Lupin. They had all died, all died for him. They believed that he could defeat Voldemort, that by sacrificing themselves Harry would change the world. And he had done nothing with that,
Each event of the day felt as though it was already so far away, and yet still happening, crashing into him like ocean waves. There were too many things Harry had to worry about-- Malfoy's evaluation, the nasty way everyone looked at him in Potions, his fight with Ron and Hermione-- and he couldn't bring himself to pick through even one of them.
Harry blinked. "Uh. I did. Thanks, Cho."
Potter, with his vault of wealth and his dashing good looks! Poor Potter, who everybody loves! Poor, famous Potter, who could live with any old family, or buy his own damn apartment, but would rather mooch off of my parents!"
The redhead cast a lazy glance up, not even bothering to dart his eyes towards Harry. "Hullo," he said through a mouthful of egg.
"Were you hiding from us, mate?" Ron asked, helpfully shoving Hermione's trunk in the shelves above. Crookshanks, looking a little older and a bit shabbier, curled up in a basket near Hermione's feet, snoring. She leaned down to give him a little pet between his ears. Interestingly enough, it was Malfoy who had found Crookshanks, who had escaped the Burrow following the Death Eater's attack on Bill and Fleur's wedding and had traveled nearly a hundred miles to the Manor, where he just missed Hermione's escape to the Cottage. Malfoy, perhaps having some form of care for the cat, had kept him safe within the Manor, returning him to Hermione after the war was over and before he was taken to Azkaban. As such, Hermione's warmth towards him had grown considerably, and she kept Crookshanks much closer to her than she ever had.
'At least the book can't sing,' the other Weasley twin then said, followed by the grinning of the other Weasley children and a glare from Molly.
Even Fleur declared that she had been asked by the captain of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team; a certain Roger Davies. Draco slowly started to feel tempted to accept Orlin's offer and go to the Yule Ball with him instead if Harry wasn't going to ask him any time soon.
, actually? You haven't told me yet."
, if you so desperately have to be the hero again.' Harry grinned, his laugh echoing into the nook of Draco's collarbone. 'But if there's anything I must do, anything at all to defeat that monster—'
Draco was afraid, he couldn't deny. Afraid of what was about to come. Afraid of the people he might lose. Afraid of the castle getting destroyed with a single flick of Voldemort's wand. He was afraid Harry would surrender himself anyway. But he didn't have time to be afraid, and therefore he had set foot after foot to help Harry in his search.
Harry lifted his head and Draco gave him a look. '
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Somewhere, Harry expects Malfoy to say something like 'welcome to my Slytherin cave', but the blond keeps his mouth in a tight line, almost as if he’s ashamed of showing Harry his room — though there’s not a single thing to be ashamed of.
' the locket's voice now said —
‘Sounds like I look good,' Harry said with a content smile.
Not having felt anything for weeks makes this small thing something big to Draco; he can at least feel the touch of someone else with his black arm. Afraid he never would be able to feel anything anymore besides from the slight pressure whenever he touched something, is a happy relief. It even makes the tiniest of smile appear on his face.
A deep sigh followed, and as Harry lifted his head again, Draco saw he was crying as well. It was rare to see Harry cry, and he felt the importance of every tear like a stab through his heart. 'I did this to you, I — I casted a spell I didn't know anything about. I thought you — I thought you killed Dumbledore.'
A shake of his head and the tiniest of smirks agreed to his words. 'I'm expected to be elsewhere.'
Fleur nodded and at that moment the teachers fell silent. Draco turned around to face them again and saw Dumbledore's hand on Harry's shoulder. 'I am afraid, my boy, that there is no way back. The Goblet has chosen you as a Champion and therefore you are expected to compete as well,' he told him.
And he did it. The boy from the tales, the boy with the beautiful green eyes fought against a dragon by flying! It had shocked the entire crowd and as Harry held up his Golden Egg above his head, the loudest applause of the day broke free. Students jumped up from their seats and called Harry's name as if he had been their favorite all along. Draco stood up as well, more in a moderate way and clapped his hands slowly while keeping his eyes on the green-eyed boy. Harry noticed Draco's stare right away and returned it with a smile. Draco himself couldn't help but smile back and clapped his hands a little faster, smile growing with every clap. The boy had done it; he had succeeded thanks to
'And he will do what exactly, Dolores? I believe Fudge is currently too occupied with something of a greater matter,' Dumbledore replied to her words.
'I—' Draco started, eyes still in Harry's. 'I can't be sure.' The boy blinked, and a tear escaped his eye — but he didn't even seem to notice anymore. There was also a strange look in Draco's eyes which Harry had never seen before, and it made a shiver run down his spine. The blond's face seemed blank, expressionless and emotionless — yet that single tear showed there was something going on in Draco's very soul at the same time.
'Is that what they're called? The objects that have something to do with You-Know-Who?' Harry nodded. 'And we must destroy them?' Another nod.
Arms wrapped around Harry's waist with dear life, Draco closed his eyes and buried his face in the boy's Quidditch uniform. He didn't want to open them and see just how high they were already. Butterflies he could normally only feel when his eyes were cast upon Harry now fluttered inside his stomach and Draco tightened his grip around the boy even more. Harry winced because of it but chuckled as well. The feeling of the wind as it blew through his hair felt quite pleasant but still Draco could hear a little voice say that he would fall, fall,

Everyone frowned their eyebrows and leaned a bit closer to Molly, trying to get a better look on what she got. 'What is it mum?' One of the Weasley twins asked with a curious glance at the book.
They finally reached the edge; hunched down behind the first house they saw. With their backs against a cold, stone wall; they held their heads together to plan what to do next. The Marauder's map laid open on the ground, in the middle of their little circle. 'We can try to go through Honeydukes secret entrance,' Harry suggested, pointing at the narrow, underground way depicted on the map.
'That's because I hide well,' Draco said with a grin. 'Now, what is your patronus?'
Harry's words hit Draco hard. He had always hated his father's dark past. How his mother had tried to hide it, how they had to flee to a whole different country to hide from it. But there was no hiding; and it had all been his father's fault. How would he ever idolize a man that had doomed his own family's future? 'I would never want to be him,' he said to Harry, tears suddenly welling up in his eyes. 'I want to be on the
A side-glance of silver eyes, a grin upon his lips. They were indeed walking towards the Quidditch pitch, and that meant that Draco's theory had been right all along. A crescent-shaped tribune was positioned in front of hedges as tall as a house, hiding something behind it. House flags colored the different sections and Gryffindors cheered the loudest of all when Harry arrived. A few students from each school had gathered around at the front of the tribune and were banging drums, blowing trumpets and just enjoying themselves. Professors were chatting while waiting for the task to begin, expressions more serious than usual upon their faces; it was and always had been a Tournament between schools in the first place.
'I believe it's the goblet, not the snake,' Harry declared, pointing at the golden goblet with an engraving of a badger.
. Have they always been so white? The faint lemony scent hanging around the blond makes his head spin a little and confused. Why is he noticing all these things?
It worried Draco that the pink woman he had seen at the Manor last summer was now Harry's teacher; there was something demon-like radiating from her. He had sensed it the moment she had set foot on the Manor's tiled floors; evil had entered the building. Curious he had sneaked upon his father and this woman in the drawing room, had overheard their conversation and informed Harry. But now he had no idea what she was planning to do; she was too far away for him to reach.
They landed with a loud splash, sinking towards the bottom for a few seconds before swimming upwards towards the sky — following the tiny bubbles, his eyes now opened wide. Draco took a deep breath as he reached the surface, his frozen limbs slightly warmer because of the movement but cold by the lake's water at the same time. The others were panting as well, already swimming towards the nearby shore. 'Come on,' Harry encouraged, swimming alongside him with the sword of Gryffindor still clenched in his hand.
The boys sat in silence for another few minutes before getting out of the bath and dressing themselves again. Fully clothed and hair tucked away beneath his hat, Draco suddenly felt more awkward than he had half-naked. Harry seemed to feel the same way as he couldn’t stop looking at his feet, eyes a bit wider than usual as if he was lost in his thoughts.
Voldemort's followers got summoned, his precious Death Eaters, and Harry watched how they arrived like smoke, clouds of black drifting in every direction. As they stood in a perfect circle around their returned master, Harry noticed the empty gaps between a few of them; not everyone had shown up apparently. It was a small victory in his head but a great disappointment in that of Voldemort. Furious he pulled off the masks of his followers and revealed their faces one by one, calling out their names in fury. Harry heard names he recognized and names he had never heard of before; noting them down in his mind just like their faces.
' A third and last book was added to the pile. '
Malfoy has never called him Harry before and is also the kind of person that never, in his entire life, would've had the intention in doing so. Yet, he just did. How desperate must a man be to cross a boundary he had set for himself at the age of 11? They had always been Malfoy and Potter. Not
,' he told the old Wizard.
The snake-like Wizard had doomed up in front of his eyes, pale as the moonlight and as monstrous as Harry had imagined him to be. Harry hadn't been able to do anything but try to remain calm; something he had never been very good at. He tried to figure out a plan, tried to figure out a way to escape from Voldemort and the graveyard all together; but fear and panic were taking over his brain and made him unable to think.
, you know. "Alright,' Harry started, doing his best not to sigh once more, 'I apologize for calling you a heavy figure…' Dudley curtly nodded his chubby head, eyebrows frown. '… I now realize I just should've called you
Harry smiled at him. 'I know. That's why I want to teach it to you.'
A pout. A turn with his back towards Harry. The man rolled his eyes; he was just playing his ‘annoyed’ game again — the one he played whenever Harry was’t obeying his words.
Not to mention the fact that he never really liked owls. Probably because the Eagle owl he had during his time at Hogwarts wasn't very friendly to him; he used to bite his fingers a lot and often return with wrinkled or nearly destroyed letters.
His vision became blurry, and made him stumble over something on his way. He hit the ground face first, and head quickened footsteps hurry themselves over grass behind his back. Harry’s footsteps neared as he crawled to his feet again as fast as he could, unwilling to let the boy see him cry. But the boy was faster and took ahold of his arm. ‘Draco,’ he started, but Draco roughly pulled his arm away.
. For
At those words, the heart of the raven-haired boy started beating faster. His parents were up there, living where Draco came from — where Draco often visited! A sudden excitement overwhelmed him and the boy sat up straight in bed, startling Draco a tiny bit. "You must've talked to them, no? You must've seen them, at least?" He pushed, his eyes as big as fishbowls.
(See the end of the chapter for
looked away for only a second and off I went; up way too high in the sky. She tried to stop the broom by shooting spells but hit me instead, threw me off in a matter of seconds. She was utterly shocked by it and as I fell down she became incapable of protecting me, afraid she would mess up again.’ Draco took a break there and moved his hands through the water, fingers widely spread. ‘I was lucky there were a lot of trees to catch my fall, but I was badly injured. Broke a lot of bones and somehow got this butterfly-shaped scar.
, Draco thought. Hadn't he read about it somewhere in a history book? Beauxbatons didn't have something like houses; they were only divided into boys and girls but an unity otherwise. Of course there were conflicts sometimes but they were usually quickly resolved, knowing that they were all too
'Of course I will. Even if she doesn't I'll inform you with whatever nonsense I've come up with in the meantime. I won't give up on you so easily, Draco,' he replies with a small smile.
His complaints about Hedwig weren't the only reason he had upset him so greatly; the tearing of Draco's letter, the mocking about Cedric's death — it had all been too much for Harry to handle in this extreme heat — but then it suddenly turned cold. Too cold. A cold he could feel to his bones and darkened the sky. The bright sun had faded away, was replaced by clouds of blue and grey. It looked as if it was about to rain, a million teardrops would fall down upon Magnolia Crescent's park. A wind blew past them and made the swings squeak in a macabre way.
'To come find me again?' Draco's eyes were set worried, the specks of blue they held more vibrant than Harry had ever seen them appear. He took a step forward to place a hand on Harry's cheek, as soft and loving gesture.
February the 24th; the day of the second task. Red and gold ran through hallways, over fields and made an appearance even between bookshelves. Harry had been looking for Draco all morning, but still hadn't found him yet. The blond had disappeared after dinner the previous day, missing their planned meeting at the library afterwards. Harry had waiting for hours but Draco hadn't shown up. A bit disappointed Harry had gone to bed, thinking that the French had simply forgotten.
'Nothing.'
know he's suffering from a certain curse. And isn't that also the reason why Harry's here in the first place?
Before Draco could answer, Arthur opened his mouth again. ‘That doesn’t explain why he’s here; he’s not a member of the Order.’
Potter. But I think I'll manage.' With only a snap of his fingers, Draco's dressing gown and pajamas were completely dry again. The art of wandless magic; what a treasure it was.
of it. When Fleur opened her Golden Egg, I heard the same screeching sounds and immediately knew it was Mermish. It took me only a few minutes to figure out the message would be clear underwater.
He soon found out as he got back to the carriage's common room after the second task. Harry had been dragged along by a bunch of Gryffindors with the promise of a party at their common room. Draco had stayed behind with Hermione by his side, inviting him to come as well and Draco had accepted the offer before even realizing it. Curiosity of knowing what the Gryffindor common room and dormitory looked like had taken over. But he had demanded that he first wanted to change into something else; the jumper could stay but his slightly damp school robes had to come off. Not to mention that his hair desperately needed to be combed after its adventure down the Lake.
‘Can you please tell me what we're doing outside the Prefect's bathroom?’ Harry's head asked.
'What do you want?' Lucius Malfoy spat at the man beside Harry.
a voice in his head added to it.
Harry swallowed and glanced at Ron, whom was also awaiting his answer with a frown. His brains were working on full speed, trying to make up a more suitable lie; one they would more easily believe — but he just couldn't think of anything. His eyes then found Draco who was seated at the Ravenclaw table as usual. He was for once wearing a color different than blue; a jumper in a golden tone. The little fibers of it seemed to glitter in the Great Hall's light and it enchanted Harry's eyes in an instant. With the blond's hair tucked away underneath one of his many berets Harry couldn't wait to just toss it away again and feel the soft, silkiness of his beautiful locks slide through his fingers.
‘I can see it!’ A finger pointing at a pile of items — a blue sapphire gleaming from afar like an eye winking at its lover.
Then came Little Whinging's local church; a huge white building with a tower-like structure at the front, stained-glass windows all around and a life-sized Nativity scene next to it to celebrate upcoming Christmas. Somehow Harry couldn't help but always bow his head when he passed the building — though the boy didn't quite know why exactly he did that, as he wasn't that religious nor had even set
"This year at Hogwarts, I hope our veterans of war can find some semblance of comfort in the familiar halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and that our younger students may find a source of inspiration with the bravery, loyalty, strength, and wisdom of these heroes." Professor McGonagall raised her arms to the Great Hall's ceiling, casting sorrowful eyes on the floating candles. "Today we mourn those who could not sit here with us, tomorrow we ensure their sacrifices are not in vain." She lowered her arms.
"Not tonight. I have…" he trailed off, searching for an excuse, and his eyes landed on Dumbledore, who was having a hushed conversation with Professor Snape. "Another meeting with Dumbledore."
Harry nodded, pulling his Invisibility Cloak from his pocket and tossing it over him. The fabric had barely settled before Ron stomped around the corner, smoke nearly coming out of his ears.
"Thanks, Harry. I told him he could,
Draco laughed a little, just as Harry mashed their lips together. The kiss was warm-- surprising, Harry thought, for such a cold boy, and even though it was imperfect and had just a bit too much saliva to be enjoyable, Harry had to log it into his catalog of absolute favorite memories.
Harry stood, overwhelmed, and ignored the stares that pierced through his robes, silently judging him. The names kept coming. There were only fifty students, right? Only fifty had died, why was this taking so long, how many were there really, had he been lied to, people are looking at him and all Harry can do is run.
"Draco used to ride this junk," Pansy said, handing Harry a splintered Comet 360. "He refuses to get rid of it. Sentimental value." She pulled her own Firebolt from the broom cupboard, toppling over a few broken broom pieces.
"It's alright," Harry said, not breaking eye contact with Malfoy. "I'm not sure I wanted to hear what it had to say, really."
Harry considered, sitting up to look at the distant Forbidden Forest.
"Hermione," Harry said, "Are you still concerned about them? They're happy!"
"Do you think they sat here?" Harry asked, without really thinking. Malfoy looked up, startled. "The students who died?"
"He may as well have!" Ron slammed both fists down again and stood up. "Forget it, Harry! After everything we've done for you, you still--" he stopped himself, shaking his head. "Nevermind," he snapped, yanking the door open, nearly knocking the Trolley Lady over as he stormed away, slamming the door behind him. A couple of Ravenclaws leaned out of their carriage, whispering, casting concerned glances.
Pansy grinned. "I have an extra Comet 360 in the Slytherin changing room. A seeker's game?"
" the Sorting Hat lamented, "
"Nevermind that," Draco grinned. "And since you'll probably ask--" he leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Harry's closed lips-- "I've always thought you were pretty. Before I even knew what liking boys was."
"But that's enough about us," Pansy said, clapping a hand on Malfoy's shoulder and bringing Harry back to earth. "Malfoy, how did your meeting go?"
Comments, kudos, anything is so appreciated. I hope you like this story!
"Still sore from the game last night, Potter?" Malfoy grinned. For the first time, he had won the Seeker's game, although in both Harry and Pansy's defense he had played incredibly dirty, nearly landing all three of them in the Hospital Wing with a well-placed
Harry skipped Charms that day, deciding instead to go to the Quidditch Pitch. He didn't have any broom to play with, so he sat in the stands, watching the clouds and thinking.
Draco shook his head. "It's obvious, isn't it?" He laughed a little, sitting shakily down on the bed. Harry sat next to him, far enough away to give Draco space but close enough that if Draco leaned to the right his head would almost immediately rest on Harry's shoulder. "I don't want to work for him anymore. I'm tired. There's a Vanishing Cabinet," he explained, not able to stop himself as the story came tumbling out, "in the Room of Requirement. They want me to bring Death Eaters through. I have to make it work. But everything I put in it dies." Draco lets out a sob, but it's dry this time. "And it's a silly thing to be so upset about, but I put a bird in there. I knew what was going to happen. I killed her."
I am so sorry for the cliffhanger! ***
"They stood up," Harry said numbly. "They chose to fight."
"I'm fine. I'll see Hermione and you later." He grabbed his trunk, which was incredibly light-- he didn't have much to pack, after all-- and hoisted it onto the train, leaving nothing but an empty trolley and a rather befuddled looking Ron in his wake.
Harry remained silent, not bothering to see if Ron's facial expressions indicated a strong desire to flip the table. Judging from Hermione's small sigh of exasperation, they did.
Malfoy's eyes widened a little, but he didn't comment, keeping his cool, even tone as he said, "Goodnight, Potter." Pansy nodded, her pink clip nearly slipping out of her thin hair. She reached up, reclipped it, and patted Harry on the arm before walking away, Malfoy in tow.
"Well, you always intended to be rude, but I found it endearing. Not to mention I always felt like you were a good person, deep down. And I'm honored I get to see that person."
Pansy won the Seeker's game.
Harry exited the shower, drying off on one of the red and gold towels that had been collecting dust on the shelf. He smelled like the ever-replenishing shampoos stocked in the showers, and he had to admit that it was comforting. Familiar.
For the first time in his Hogwarts life, Harry felt like he was alone. The Gryffindor common room didn't welcome him anymore. Whenever he left his bed, he got judgemental glances, whispers, and once or twice an overzealous fan who would harass him for his autograph (which didn't improve Harry's reputation with the rest of the Gryffindors). Even though Harry didn't consider himself particularly loyal, smart, or cunning, he certainly didn't feel brave.
"Excellent," Malfoy suddenly broke out into a smile, and a strange feeling hit Harry. Just a little tug, somewhere in his chest, and he realized that he was
A tiny smile crossed Ron's face. "Fine. Maybe I will." He stepped forward, and Harry was suddenly reminded of just how tall Ron was. He towered over Harry, and despite his thin physique practically drowning in his robes, the formidable hand clenched tightly around his wand was enough to quicken Harry's heart rate and make him take a step back. Ron seemed to delight in this, smiling wider.
The younger kids erupted in cheers, and the older ones sat in silence. Every eighth year, seventh year, and a few sixth years hung their heads. One or two had tears in the corners of their eyes. Harry ignored the cheering, picking at a splinter on the wooden table.
"Likewise, Luna," Harry said, standing up. His legs felt numb, and his brain was spinning. It felt as though had Cho had stripped down every layer of his flesh, examined them, and then put them back together. Almost like she had read his mind.
"Forget it," Ron waved his hand, brushing the topic away. "So how about Malfoy, huh? The git's finally gotten out of Azkaban."
Draco nodded, even though he couldn't believe it. "I just feel so useless," he admitted. "I'm a traitor to Hogwarts--"
Malfoy laughed, but it was empty of any joy. He stood up, grabbing his trunk from where he had shoved it in the shelves above the seats. "Partially," he said, rolling the inner door back. "And it's also a personal philosophy I have adopted. See you around, Potter."
Hermione walked away, her shoes snapping pointedly against the stone as she strode. Right before she rounded the corner, she glanced quickly at Harry. It was hard to read her look, but Harry could tell that she wasn't very happy with him.
"Hello, Harry," Cho said, and Harry's face instinctually curled up, as though he had smelled something nasty.
"Yeah," Ron snorted, "maybe Harry's hiding somewhere around here, sniffing around like a little rat." He ran a hand through his sweaty hair, dropped it to his side, and sighed, defeated. "I just wish he could take the hint. He's been nothing but a burden on my family for the summer, and now he expects me to pander to his emotions?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Later, in the dormitory, Harry stared at the ceiling, willing for something interesting to happen. Anything, really, to take his mind off of the events of the evening. The other boys still hadn't come back yet, and he had already retired to his bed, hoping that maybe they would respect his 'sleep'.
Harry couldn't speak. His arms were shaky as they held him up, still half-reclined on his bed, stunned. "Ron--" he began again, but it came out squeaky, pillowed by the creeping feeling in his throat. "Ron, I'm--"
," Hermione spat, "need to give Harry a bloody break, you gormless, knobheaded…" Hermione sputtered indignantly, searching for a proper word. "
"Alright then, boys," Arthur said, clapping Ron and Harry on the back. "Nobody's looking."
Harry stepped further down the corridor, keeping his wand raised, until he was about ten feet away from Ron, positioned for battle. Ron shifted his position the same way. They both waited, the tension thick in the air, waiting for someone to make the first move. Just as Harry had decided it was up to him to do something, Hermione stepped in between them, her face bright pink. "That is
With that, he wrenched his shoulder from Harry's grasp and stomped away.
"Malfoy," Ron's voice said from outside his compartment. Harry snapped his attention to the closed glass door, where Ron was talking to a very familiar silver-haired boy.
"What?"
"I remember
Harry gave her a tiny smile, and Hermione's eyes lit up. It seemed, from her letters over the summer and from their interactions at Hogwarts, that Hermione wanted to fix Harry, to fix everyone. That's who she thought of herself as, the fix-it witch, the Mind Healer, the person who had recovered and had it all figured out. As long as Harry could reassure her that she was doing a good job, he figured that she would be happy enough to work through her own problems.
No Draco in this one boys, he's busy trying to not get sent to Azkaban while Harry gets absolutely bullied.
Neville's round face was dark, and the lantern light made him look ghostly. "I buried my parents," he said, his voice empty, "In Godric's Hallow. They're by yours, Harry," he said, glancing up. Harry shifted uncomfortably at the haunted look in Neville's eyes, averting his gaze and looking towards the moon. Neville looked back down, withdrawing back into himself.
