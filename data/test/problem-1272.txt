Everyone stared at Draco, who went pink but sat up straight.
“Should be over there, we can cut through the line,” Draco said, and proceeded to do just that. Harry followed him in time to see Draco collide with a photographer who was focused on Lockhart.
,” he hissed.
“I'm not quite sure why, Mother explained it to me once but I was quite young and didn't really understand,” he admitted.
“What? No, I won't let you,” Daphne pouted at him.
Harry jerked his hand back as if he'd been burnt. “Sorry, sir,” he said, blushing when he saw Theo staring at him. He picked up his knife, but it was no use. He was acutely aware of Draco's presence next to him, even though they hadn't spoken all lesson. For the first time, Harry left Potions class feeling certain he'd failed to brew something correctly.
“Stay there, Mr Weasley, I'll get rid of it,” Snape said idly. It was clear he was enjoying the look on Ron's face as he stared at the snake.
“You speak Parseltongue too?” Blaise asked.
Draco rolled his eyes and took a seat behind the white pieces. “You're forgetting that I managed to beat McGonagall's chessmen. That should count for something.”
Harry couldn't help the goofy smile that spread over his face as he read the note. He put it down to open the small parcel it was attached to. It turned out to be a beautiful silver cloak pin, fashioned into the shape of a loosely curled serpent with tiny emeralds for eyes.
“Pure-bloods who associate with Muggle-borns.”
“You got your trophy,” Harry replied.
Lockhart looked at the others, then back at Harry. “There's no one here... Well, look at the time! I've kept you too long, you're tired I expect. Fame does have its drawbacks, you know. Off to bed with you, then.”
“Hagrid –”
Narcissa shook it and smiled. “As am I. I've heard so much about you.”
Greg and Vince both decided to go with Snape.
“Are you particularly interested in serpents, Harry?” he asked.
“Why did you do it? Because of you, both of my best friends nearly died!” Draco shouted.
Harry nodded. “Ollie's mostly interested in gossip though.”
“You guys didn't hear anything?” Harry asked quietly.
“I'll admit no such thing.”
“So what was that all about?” Harry finally asked.
Draco snorted. “No, he still doesn't like her. I haven't mentioned her to him at all this summer after what he said the first time I did so.”
“What do you think?”
By this stage, every eye in the room was fixed on her. Harry and the Dursleys were openly gaping at her, but Draco was grinning broadly.
Harry shook his head, but Draco nodded. “The Dark Mark,” he whispered. “I've seen my father's.”
“All right then,” Draco nodded.
Harry stifled a yawn, making Gemma giggle. He glared at her over his tea. “How are you always this cheery?”
“Silence, Peeves!” McGonagall snapped, and the poltergeist flew away backwards, sticking his tongue out at Harry.
“Sure,” Harry said gratefully and moved over in his bed. “Want some pie?”
“Sorry. But I can make it up to you,” Draco offered.
“Can I get someone for you? Your Head of House, maybe?” Harry tried again.
“I'm sorry, but that won't be possible this summer,” Narcissa said apologetically. “In light of your father's trial, I've decided that we need to spend some time together as a family.”
“Yes there bloody well is,” Millicent growled as she got up.
“What was what?” Hermione asked.
“Writing a letter to Hermione, actually. Just sent off Thoth now.”
“All right,” Hermione sighed again. “Bear in mind that I haven't actually spoken to Draco about any of this, so I could be wrong.”
They obediently let her continue filling in Hermione and Neville. Blaise was telling Harry all about the latest girl he'd been seeing, when he heard someone clearing their throat behind him. He looked up to see Justin Finch-Fletchley standing there.
“Lockhart, of course!” Daphne exclaimed.
Miles spotted them. “Hey, there they are! Anything you want to tell us?”
“How come?”
With two cracks, Dobby Disapparated from in front of Mr Malfoy, to pop back next to Draco. Mr Malfoy's cane swished through empty air, and he glared at Draco.
Draco stared at him. “They're a what from where?”
Harry bristled with annoyance as Mr Weasley came over. “Boys! Ginny! What are you doing? It's mad in here, let's go outside.”
“Good luck with that,” snorted Draco.
Flint nodded. “Or if it's both of you.”
Made of grey stone, the house that loomed at the end of the drive was the largest Harry had ever seen. The double-storeyed front doors opened by themselves to show a large marble foyer. Harry didn't have a chance to have a look as Draco was impatiently pulling him up the wide staircase. He dragged Harry down a dimly lit hallway. Its walls were lined with portraits of pale faced blondes who murmured as the two boys rushed past. Finally Draco slowed to a stop.
‘What is your relationship with Cécile Rutledge exactly?’ Ron asked.
‘In one of my flats in central London.’ Malfoy grabbed a piece of paper and wrote the address down. Harry reached out his hand and noticed that Malfoy looked at it in hesitation, as if he did not want to touch it, but he eventually handed the parchment over. ‘He doesn’t like to stay in one place for too long, but that’s where he stays when he’s in London. Anything else?’
“I got caught with Aragog. They thought he killed that girl in the bathroom. I was just a lad so they expelled me instead of sendin' me to Azkaban.”
“But he's the one who let the pixies loose and then left it up to us to catch them again!” Draco sulked.
He found Draco sitting there, clearly bored as he watched Vince and Greg shovelling pudding into their mouths. “God, can we go? These two haven't said a word for ten minutes.”
“So what's wrong?” Harry asked.
Mrs Malfoy walked in and took the seat opposite them. “Have you two had a good afternoon?”
. That Creevey kid was taking photos of him when he got injured at Quidditch. The next day, he's Petrified.”
“Did Draco send you here?”
Both boys stared after her as she ran off.
“What? Of course I do! I have to go to school. And it's more of a home than this place could ever be,” Harry said, bewildered.
Draco handed Harry a toffee. “Sorry,” he muttered.
Snape glanced down at him. “It's just a snakeskin.”
“Yes, though not to the same extent as you or – or your father,”Snape replied. “That's ground finely enough. Add it to the cauldron and stir thrice clock-wise before setting it to simmer.”
“Potter! We've got Quidditch try outs tomorrow evening at seven, and I want you there. We need to replace Higgs and Shabes, so let your friends know we're looking for a Chaser and a Beater.”
“If the two of you are ready, I shall take you down to the feast,” Snape said finally.
Hermione finally smiled. “That's a great idea, thanks, Harry. I'll see you later!”
“Piss off!”
Harry gave him a small smile. “I'm fine now, though.” When Draco still looked upset, he tried a joke. “My handwriting's never been neater.”
Draco shook his head and grinned. “I think I'll pay proper attention now.”
********
, Potter!” Draco called impatiently.
“I'll do it,” Harry said immediately, avoiding Draco's eyes.
Snape's face was grim as he addressed his students. “There has been another attack. As such, new security measures are to be put in place for your safety. All students are to be in the common room by no later than six o'clock every evening, and you are not to leave under any circumstances until breakfast. If for any reason you require the assistance of a staff member during curfew, find a Prefect; they will know how to contact me. Students will be escorted to every class by a member of staff. All extra-curricular activities are cancelled until further notice, and you are not to go anywhere by yourself.”
“Yes sir. Er, Happy Christmas,” Harry said awkwardly before he headed back to the Slytherin table.
“It doesn't change things,” Draco added. “Either way, we ended up stumbling across a Petrified cat before being found by the entire school.”
“Draco, shut up. Colin, the answer's no,” Harry said firmly.
“How?”
And so began one the most boring evenings of Harry's life. He ignored Lockhart's pronouncements about fame as best he could, thinking longingly of the detention he and Draco had had with Snape last year when they cleaned cauldrons. As he watched the clock tick forward far too slowly, he even began to think that he'd rather be in the Forbidden Forest facing Voldemort again.
Ollie flicked his tongue out interestedly. “
” The snake slowly dropped its head to the floor, and Harry could have sworn it was sulking. “
“Ah, you three look like you know what you're doing. Just pop them back in the cage, then,” he said, and closed the door behind him.
They only had History of Magic that morning. Knowing that Binns wouldn't notice their absence, Harry picked up another slice of toast and joined Draco.
Pansy grinned as she leant forward to fill Neville in on what he'd missed. She'd just reached the part about Hermione figuring out that the monster was a basilisk, when Hermione herself came running up towards them.
“Did you know your mum was sending me something?” Harry asked Draco.
Blaise grinned. “That's so cool.”
“The diary. Tom's draining my energy somehow.”
They looked up in surprise, having forgotten where they were sitting. A group of older Gryffindors were glaring at them.
Harry looked between the two men who were glaring daggers at each other, then turned to Draco and gave him a questioning look. Draco frowned slightly and shook his head as his father pulled an old schoolbook out of the Weasley girl's cauldron.
Harry sighed and told her the whole story. When he finished Hermione was frowning into the distance.
be Harry Potter?”
“Anyone else get the feeling there's some bad news in today's paper?” Tracey asked.
Dumbledore gazed at him, giving him the impression he was being X-rayed. “Yes, that's all.”
“I like the photo.”
“You wish!”
Theo shook his head and moved over to talk last minute strategy with Gemma.
“Don't worry about it,” Harry said evasively. “Just give me the phial, and I'll take care of it. And then we're even.”
Harry read the letter and gulped. It was from the Improper Use of Magic Office at the Ministry, and clearly stated underage wizards shouldn't do magic outside of school. Shit.
Harry made to follow the class inside, but Lockhart stopped him.
Harry let out a shaky breath as he got to his feet. This was not good, not good at all. He looked around him, but there was no one in the corridor. He could hear the muffled sounds of nearby classes, but he was alone in the corridor. He could run and deny ever being here – but he should get help. Or would that still make him seem guilty? He stood there trying not to panic, when Peeves burst out of a classroom next to him.
“Those two need to just shag already,” grumbled Miles.
“Because I needed to borrow some hairpins off Daphne. If that's okay with you?” Harry asked sarcastically.
“What happened to this one? Towler, right?” Harry asked.
********
Draco nodded. “I know, which is why we're putting the cage in his office.”
“But it's a hell of a lot more innocent than what Blaise wanted to do,” Harry replied, causing them all to laugh.
As the Prefects made their way over, Snape looked down at Harry. “Mr Potter, I will see you in your dorm momentarily.”
Theo arrived next to Harry in time to repel the Bludger on its return. “Did you put some sort of Summoning Charm on this, Harry?” he yelled.
Harry looked at the ingredients. “Er... The salamander scales and peppercorn together can melt weaker metal at high temperatures?”
“At what age?”
“You can come back now,” Harry said as he climbed awkwardly back into bed.
Harry shook his head.
Tom held up a wand, which Harry recognised with a jolt as his own. Tom wrote the words
“How?” Snape asked urgently.
” Draco cried. “Please, please tell me that he was destroyed when you got caught with him!”
Harry stepped forward warily. “
Harry looked up from the jeans he was folding. “What? No, they're a grunge band from Seattle.”
Harry went into the kitchen, carefully not watching Draco until he could sense the other boy behind him. He opened the fridge, the cabinet, the pantry, setting things out one by one.
“Thanks,” Harry said, wondering suddenly if there was a television anywhere in the house. “I’ll come over for the Cannons game tomorrow?”
editions, which are always a bit incomprehensible. Funeral listings on the back. I included a special edition about the rebuilding of Hogwarts, although I’m sure you’re up to date.”
“Yeah,” he agreed, although a part of him was starting to become attached to the Manor, in some perverse way. With his hangover looming a few hours away, he was almost looking forward to returning to its luxuriant, empty silence.
“I’m worried about you,” Hermione argued from the fireplace, as she spelled a basket of laundry into neat folded piles. “You should be alright now, just try to come out. It would do you some good. I’m sure the Ministry could sort you back out, if anything happens.”
“So you don’t want me to leave, but you expect me to? Even though I’m saying I won’t. “ Harry didn’t try to hide his frustration from Draco. He’d hidden it from the Aurors, tried to control it in front of his friends. With Draco, he finally felt like he could roll his eyes. “Since when did you even want me to stay?”
“It’s getting quite late,” she said, peering solemnly around at everyone. “Shall we have a toast for Dean and Ginny?”
“Send an Owl,” Draco advised. “Or, I don’t know, a koi. Or one of my peacocks.”
Harry’s throat burned as the sweet taste of lemons turned back into firewhiskey in his mouth. He didn’t know what had made him say it, except that in the grand scheme of things, Draco had been as young as them. It just didn’t seem right not to acknowledge someone who had disappeared right under everyone’s nose and gone forever unburied.
“He wasn't a real Death Eater, he was a minor,” Ron added, looking as surprised as Pansy beside him that he’d spoken up. There was a small couch in the corner, and Ron and Pansy were squashed uncomfortably together, clearly trying not to touch.
“I’m terrified,” Draco repeated, swinging his head up to look Harry in the eye. It was hard to hold his gaze. He looked like a wild animal, like the frenzied dragon that Harry had faced down in Fourth Year, wanting to defend something it didn’t understand. “To go out there? How can I even prove myself when there’s nothing good to prove about me? I was supposed to be a villain for the rest of my life, and now… but I have to do
“Right as usual,” he muttered, making a mental note to tell Hermione. Later. He wasn’t about to interrupt again.
Harry cast a wandless warming spell on the wood floor, then shuffled over barefoot to inspect the wall. He knocked where Hermione had, and was entirely ignored.
okay. You’re the ones forcing me out of my comfort zone, so I’ll thank you not to show up and insult it, like I should just- just throw it away! I’m not going to let.” And he stopped.
Harry bumped up against Draco again, distracted, and reached out to palm the softness of his hair. Draco took a break from his Snitch scanning to glance at him, then took him in properly. “Alright, Potter?”
“I’m the coolest,” Pansy informed him. “Ron may be a blithering Gryffindor, but he was right — he actually may be smarter without you.”
It was beautiful, though. Without the people and the spells and the violence that had filled it, it was almost just… a house. A huge house, that was more like wandering alone through a closed-down museum, but it had been a home once, too. Harry tried to imagine a young Draco Malfoy running through the gardens, and was surprised to realize that he could picture it easily. Some tiny, imperious little boy, demanding the world without any idea that he’d barely live to see it.
Williamson nodded, but Savage frowned. “If? We’re expecting you on the team. You’re not going back to Hogwarts, are you?”
They must have slipped into sleep.
They climbed up on the enormous sofa between some sleeping Gryffindors to watch an old Monty Python film, Ron falling asleep the second he hit a pillow. Hannah stayed up for another half-hour, yawning through Camelot and the quest for the Holy Grail, finally falling asleep at the Trojan Rabbit.
“You were in the
Newspapers.
Draco paused for a second, but didn’t laugh. “I was at Hogwarts last year.”
“Yeah, about that.” Ron stopped scratching his jaw, and Harry noticed the red-brown stubble that had started to shade it. It made him feel odd, suddenly, a sudden stinging reminder that Ron was already in the early stages of aging into a confident, competent Auror (possibly even one with a full beard), while Harry had no idea what his — or Draco’s — future was shaped like. “They were pretty pissed off that you didn’t show up with me this morning. They’re breathing down my neck about it, to be honest, and it got my back up a bit.”
“MALFOY!”
“Look around, it’s really not,” Dean laughed. “Go go Gryffindor.”
“It’s only right,” Ginny agreed, detaching herself from Dean’s arm to come in and hug Hermione properly. She hugged Ron next, accepting the kiss he dropped onto her head, and then she hugged Harry. The quick scent he caught of her hair was shockingly familiar, but she just squeezed him and let go. “Time to de-Slytherin this house for good.”
“My father was so stupid,” he whispered. When Harry waited, he cleared his throat and kept talking. “I knew he was unkind. I knew he was vain. I knew he was… I knew him. But I never thought that he was stupid. I just thought he was doing the wrong things. Even when it was follow or die, when following was killing me… I thought he believed in what he was doing.”
It didn’t feel like enough to be the remains of a whole person. Especially one who, for better or for worse, had loomed so large in Harry’s life.
“Are you okay? I’m so sorry.” Harry rubbed his eyes and turned to face him. In the dark, Draco’s face looked pinched and pale.
Harry smiled, despite himself. “Alright then. Come by, we’ll visit Molly together.”
In the meantime he was alone, and Malfoy had never been found. Wizarding law usually wouldn’t presume him dead for a year and a day, but the Manor was deemed a safety risk, standing unclaimed. Harry had seen Malfoy’s face top the Prophet over and over, as the Ministry called emergency meetings, sent out Aurors, and overall did little to squash the rampant speculation. Gringotts claimed no one had been to the family vaults, but many thought Malfoy had fucked off with a fortune anyway. More thought he was dead. And now the Ministry had decided that, something having to be done, they’d declare Malfoy missing.
“It’s not my bird,” Harry said automatically, more sourly than he’d intended, and Draco looked surprised, hurt. Harry wondered if Draco had stood up to reach for him, if he was now ruining everything. His mouth ran on without him. “You’re getting your house back now, right? So you won’t need me here soon.”
“McGonagall wasn’t sure where to put returning students. You don’t know this?” Ron was grinning still. “Plan A was to stick them in with the seventh years.”
“She said she’d be a character reference,” Harry says shortly, not wanting to talk about a trial too much. “And they know about us too.”
“I have everything I need,” he said muzzily. Her hair smelled amazing, like clementines and shea butter. She pinched him.
Ron frowned at Harry. “Don’t make rude noises to my girlfriend.”
Dean, to his credit or perhaps as a measure of Harry’s immateriality, didn’t react. He just whistled, following in  Hermione’s circular rotation. “Damn, this is a big house.”
The two of them were crammed into the Transfigured greenhouse room that made up half of Neville’s small flat (located, exactly halfway, between St Mungo’s and his grandmother’s). Neville’s hair had gotten even longer, and hers had seen a trim, so they both sported identical ponytails when he arrived. Somehow Neville had crammed a chef’s dream garden beside a bed of Herbology saplings beside a small grow op and what looked like a still for beer, all packed into what was ostensibly a one-bedroom. The expansion charm was a bit buggy, turning walls invisible at random, but Harry politely pretended not to notice how Neville’s bedroom suddenly resembled a couple’s room, with Luna’s hats scattered across every surface.
Luna set her beer down on the counter and tilted her head to pay attention to Neville, and Harry crossed his arms tightly. Ron and Hermione had kicked up a fuss about Draco, but they had been worried about Harry mostly, and were already — as always — on his side. He didn’t think he could expect such grace from his other friends, let alone the rest of the wizarding world, and Neville’s answer seemed significant.
“Language, Ronald,” Molly said, but slipped out of the door when Ron turned his glare to her.
Later they packed Ron’s things so he could go to the Burrow for a couple of days, and they dropped him off so Harry could hug a silent Molly. George had told the doctors at St. Mungo’s that he was only testing new joke potions, but he’d finished a dozen bottles and they’d found him in Fred’s sweater, and Arthur had called all the kids home to support him.
“Muggles aren’t dangerous!” Harry threw his hands up, confusion warring with the sweet spark that the word
“It really looks like you live here,” Ginny was saying now, pushing leftovers around on shelves. “More than Grimmauld did, even.”
Hairy tidied up in slow motion, afraid of what he was going to face now that they were left alone. If it were anyone but Draco, he would anticipate them leaving the house entirely, but there was nowhere Draco would go but further in. He undid the wards on the stairs and braced himself before climbing them, a thousand excuses and apologies running through his mind, though none of them seemed like a good enough place to start.
Struck by some weird inspiration, Harry turned back to the pantry and began stacking baking supplies on the counter: flour, sugar, baking soda. The ingredients covered the tiles, until he was placing things right beside Draco’s lean thigh. Eggs. Sea salt. Jam, mixed-berry.
“No, not that. That’s the only good lie I told. But about being scared. About not wanting to do it. We all had to pretend that it was such an honor, following his commands, and maybe if I had… had told them…”
Ron, on the other hand, brightened. “Can we trash the Malfoy place?”
He ripped the next tapestry down, losing concern for the house. He tapped the walls all the way through the first floor, lighting up dark corners and pulling book after book down from the shelves in the library. Surely one of them would open some hatch, or at least trigger a haunting.
“We didn’t get all of our clothes off,” Harry said mildly, and Draco snorted.
“Harry,” Harry said automatically. His glasses were chipped from the desk he’d blown up, his jaw sore from grinding his teeth. “We’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Why can’t he come now? We’ve told your mum he’s coming!” Harry rolled his eyes, letting them squabble. Ron was pretty good at derailing Hermione when she got too pushy. He’d agree to next week, and they’d go, and Harry would feel guilty but at least Ron wouldn’t give him shit, they just had to talk for another moment and then —
“Shut up, the only thing you know about in this place can’t be
Harry stared at the ceiling. He’d gone back to the Florentine guest room, and its gilded canopy twinkled gaudily at him in the light of the morning. A fat angel painted onto the crown moulding was peeking in at him: he rolled over. Now he could see the door, dust motes floating in the sunlight between. How could it be, that past that door, was the sum of his summer? A patched-up mansion, a former enemy? Not Auror training, not Hogwarts classes, not the friends or family that had seem him to his eighteenth summer. Everyone who had been at his birthday party had barely mattered since.
“Not tonight,” Harry bit off. “Have fun.”
“Since I—” Draco’s ghost narrowed his eyes at Harry in a way that was so
A few days later was his birthday. Harry had stocked Grimmauld proper with Carlsberg and Ogden’s, invited everyone he knew. Luna showed up three hours early to help set up without being asked, and Harry didn’t notice until later that she’d put out a lopsided cake with a lightning bolt iced onto it. Dean and Ginny came together, Dean a little abashed but Ginny stopping by to give Harry a kiss on the cheek before running to save Dean from Ron. The Patil twins came, Parvati clutching Lavender’s hand. Lavender was newly scarred, but she wasn’t the only one who’d changed in appearance. They all had some new scars, and Padma had shaved her head, and Lee Jordan showed up with golden tattoos that covered him from wrist to throat.
Ron nodded and let them go. “I’ll heat some up for you.” He left them for the fridge, sorting through piles of homemade leftovers for Molly’s latest. Hermione tilted her head, inviting Harry into the hall.
“Try.”
“For Merlin’s sake, I’m not going to be an Auror.” Harry wondered at his day. So far he’d had three versions of the same conversation, each one going worse than the last. “Didn’t you hear me telling them off?”
have to get me a medal,” Ron said easily, and Harry meant it when he swore he would.
“I love you, too,” she said, because it was obvious. “I just worry about sending you back to rattle around in that place alone. Good thing it’s only a few more days.”
Everyone trooped into the bedrooms eventually — Neville and Luna, Parvati and Lav, Seamus and MacMillan and Finch-Fletchly. The rules had relaxed a bit, Harry thought, watching people disappear to sleep and love each other in twos and threes. It was nice, everyone having someone. Maybe it was a little sad to be the only one alone, but he had his friends, and they had each other.
“Merlin,” Ron muttered, just as Harry said “
He fell asleep in front of the screen again, waking to dimmed lights and low voices.
“You know what I mean.” Harry started chopping while he got them out. “Would you mind heating some butter?”
The house went crazy.
“I have my own sins,” Draco admitted, cautious now but seemingly intrigued. “Could I apologize for those?”
“Can you teach me?”
“It’s been good for me,” Harry said politely, meaning it with his entire heart. “You’ll hear from me soon.”
They set it out at the kitchen table. Draco took his side, the lighter pieces, and Harry lined up the dark ones for a pre-game pep talk.
He had the nightmare that night.
“Okay,” she said, reluctant, and gave him another hug. “Okay, bye then. If this is about having pets, Harry, you can always bring the birds to the garden at Grimmauld, you know.”
When the credits rolled, the other people in the theater left, one by one abandoning Harry and Draco to a silent darkness. It felt like Harry held his breath until Draco let go of his hand. He sighed, a long and ragged breath that matched the way Harry was feeling — no film needed.
“Christ,” Harry said softly, squeezing Ron a little tighter.
“If it’s ether or this headache, I’ll risk it,” Draco said carelessly, waving one hand.
They swept over the gardens, and the small pond that the koi had come from, and a hedge that seemed to be hiding the concrete remains of an enormous wizard’s chess set.
Harry frowned and quickened his pace, walking too fast now to appreciate the verdant grounds. A few lamps were definitely on upstairs — unless it was a trick of the light. He didn’t know the house well enough to swear either way.
And then there was nothing for it but to walk the entire home, tapping walls with his wand along the way. He considered calling Ron over, but he couldn’t be sure that he’d really seen anything. “Revelio,” he called, over and over. “Aparecium. Finite incantatem.”
Williamson cleared his throat. “Well, Potter, we had an alert go off at this residence. One Mr. Malfoy’s wand being used? Now, he’s presumed dead, so we just have to check in. Standard stuff.”
When he woke up again, both wands were missing.
“We both were.” Draco lifted the botte and his chin as one, gesturing toward the front door. When he started walking, Harry followed, telling himself it was because of the bottle. “Come on then.”
He thought he woke up, at one point, but couldn’t be sure — the room was true dark, and he had a strange feeling like music was playing.
“Now that you know I’m here,” Draco said after a very hungover breakfast toast-and-tea, which Harry had assembled, groaning, as Draco watched from the counter again, silent and grey-faced, “we need to make some changes.”
Fucking Malfoy. “I think you’re strong,” Harry told him, still not sure if he was speaking. He wanted to kiss Draco’s squinting smile, suddenly, and he did, natural as anything. It made sense the way spinning in nothingness made sense - after all, they were magic, him and Draco and the huge home that encircled them in its arms. “You’ve survived so much.”
“No,” Harry said firmly, relieved. “All right?” They nodded at each other.
Harry frowned. “How did you know? Did you hear something?”
“Yeah, hopefully I’m done with all of that. As long I don’t, I don’t know, wind up in Voldie’s secret New York apartment,” she laughed.
“We’d better!” Another joke from Savage, this one more desperately airy. Harry didn’t like him or his tan. He smiled and nodded, though, and they turned to go. It took everything he had to smile and wave at the door instead of slamming it at their backs.
sorry.”
was ineffable.”
“Especially knowing - knowing, mind you, because of Fred - what it would do to Molly,” She shook her curls: they sprang back into indignant coils.
haven’t seen enough,” Harry hinted at length, nodding down at the shirt Draco hadn’t even unbuttoned. “Go on, kit off.”
“It’s been a rough day,” she grumbled, but then grinned and elbowed him, and he tickled her, and then he nearly burnt her with the cigarette, and then the phone nearly slid out the window, and they both ended up slightly jostled but a little more pleased.
, I want
“Salazar, no.” Draco’s nose wrinkled, and something satisfying spiked in Harry’s belly. “Their names are Valkoinen, Garuda, and Spalva. What on earth is a Betty White?”
The blue of a dream washed over him, the warmth of the blankets mingling with the yawning, ancient air between the lines of the floor and the arcs of the beams. Harry was hot, cold, floating, spinning.
?” Hermione had gone pale. He didn’t blame her. Hearing a scream here didn’t do much to support his “it’s not evil” theory.
“That was amazing,” Harry offered, instead of saying any of his thoughts out loud, and he was delighted to see Draco blush again, extra delighted to see him cover for it with a mean little sniff.
“What, so I could kill Dumbledore in peace?” Draco shook his head, the motion rustling Harry’s hair, and Harry sighed, took his glasses off, set them on the rim of the tub.
“I think he did,” Harry said, not sure why it felt like assurance.
, he almost laughed. “I’m not dead, you
“Next time,” he promised. Lied. It was strange, how he kind of felt like Grimmauld was Ron and Hermione’s house now. How the Manor was his. He didn’t want to leave, not even for that night, really. As they stood ready to go, cloaks in their hands, he realized how much he would lose if the Manor didn’t re-admit him. Would the house crumble completely? Who would feed the peacocks? The koi? Who
“We were kids.”
“Hermione?” It could be nothing. But it could be anything. A curse. Some uncaptured Death Eater… apart from the one he’d left at home. “Ron?”
Pansy and Savage looked furious. Williamson and Shacklebolt looked calm, as always, with Robards’ face utterly uneasy in contrast. Ron looked grateful to see them.
“Too right,” Shacklebolt agreed, and reached over to press Harry’s wrist. “Just give us a few minutes, son. You may find I‘m in a position to help.”
“You should see how muggles open wine,” Harry said wistfully, laying back on the tiles with his plate on his chest. The sun was creeping down slowly, transforming the sky around it into orange and purple bruises. “It’s barbaric.”
Twenty minutes later saw them in Sainsbury’s.
“Is it Ginny?” Ron gave him a hard look. “Is it because she’s leaving next week?”
Harry didn’t join in when they laughed.
, with birds and fish and bowtruckles that looked to him for scraps; lights in the windows; a person inside. A person he loved so much it scared him, his love a deep well that had been undiscovered for years, only recently uncovered, just barely explored.
Harry sipped at his pint, but couldn’t taste it. Draco Malfoy couldn’t be dead. Harry would
Draco shrugged: in the dark, Harry could only tell from the shifting of the coverlet. “She said it’s okay to hide sometimes.”
He hadn’t realized, until now, living with Draco as though they’d intended it, how much he longed to care for somebody who would stay. He had spent so many years caring so much about winning and running and dying that he’d never realized that cooking for someone could be an act of love instead of obedience. He hadn’t realized, until now, how his brain had started using the word
“It would have been too crowded, though, and the stonework wasn’t taking well to expansion charms what with the extensive rebuilding. It was hard enough re-establishing all the perimeter fortifications.” Ron had sliced two scones into halves and stacked them into a wobbling clotted-cream tower. Now it was too big to fit into his mouth, and he was trying to mash the mess down with a jam knife.
“Do you have any of those little ceramic baking things?” Harry asked, sniffing the sage before laying it next to the thyme on the cutting board.
Draco settled, acting reluctant, but the wiggle that he made to align their bodies better gave him away. They fit together like a quill and its inkwell, and Harry ran his hand up and down Draco’s arm, again and again until Draco was relaxed against him.
that swallowed him alive, and only his fear of scaring Draco away held him back.
Hermione brought out two mugs: they were from Grimmauld Place, he noticed, and he found it absurdly comforting that she was treating this place like an extension of Grimmauld, rather than a totally new chapter of life without it. He liked to think of Ron and Hermione being at Grimmauld, with or without him. Hermione glanced at him now, taking in his face, and went back into the cupboard for some biscuits. She came to sit, the kettle screaming as soon as she was halfway over the couch, and Harry stood to grab the packet from her so she could turn back around.
Draco didn’t ask what had brought Harry back in a bad mood, and Harry didn’t ask what potions Draco had taken. They just began to play.
I'm so sorry that this chapter isn't fun! I wanted to show how Harry isn't the only one dealing with tragedy and loss, and the different ways people are reacting and how that shapes them in the months after the war. It's my way of indicating why and how Harry is able to disappear right now: everyone else is putting themselves back together, as well, and not always successfully.
I go where I please
“So you wouldn’t say you were born to quibble?” he asked, and Neville laughed, but Luna cocked her head to the side.
He got the broom in place and leapt.
“Came to get my nose fixed so I wouldn’t Eloise Midgen myself,” he suggested, and then hissed when Hermione’s
Draco’s shoulders shot up to his ears, but then he relaxed, recognizing the joke. “They’re a strange breed.”
“Oi, yeah!” Ron poked his head into the hall. “Get back in here, weirdos. Let me tell you what she said.”
“You want me to stay,” Harry confirmed, finally prepared to believe it this time. “Here. With you.”
Draco, to his credit, wasn’t being scared away. Even pressed into the sheets he had a commanding way of kissing that left Harry drowning and dizzy. And so Harry escalated a little, and then a little more, until he was pressing against Draco so hard he though they’d catch on fire, his hips snapping up and pushing back, the hard stripe of Draco’s dick below him a beacon. And all the time their mouths clinging like each was the other’s oxygen.
Ron plopped down onto the ancient ottoman and patted the spot next to it. Harry dropped into the space under Ron’s shoulder, leaning back and shutting his eyes so he could think in the framework of Ron’s long arm. The cushion compressed, Hermione crowding in next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Maybe you
“You were.. In the walls?”
. He’d had a cruel closet and some scraps. A temporary school where he fought and fought and died. A best mate’s place where he barely fit at the table, an inherited heap that hated him, nothing like
Harry shot up to his feet, startled as a dozen windows banged open, slamming against the walls and shattering glass. The phonograph in the other room came on, blaring the Vivaldi Harry had been listening to last night. He took a jogging step toward the noise, then remembered the wand, slicing it frantically to stop the sound. It stilled at once, the windows waggling almost apologetically back into place. Another slash of the wand through the air fixed all the windows. It was working
“Wait, you’re moving to Hogsmeade? What about Grimmauld Place?” Harry brushed his hands off in his lap. Since when did his best friends plan their lives without him?
“Won’t you?” Draco lit the sconces by his bed with another little spell, illuminating his scowl in low light. “Surely any day now you’ll rethink the Aurors, and you’ll miss living with your Gryffindor friends, and you’ll wonder what you were doing here with me. Other than looking for a fuck, apparently—”
“It has to be,” he said, laughing a little. “Otherwise I really am losing it.”
The proprietor nodded, looking a little sad. Harry drew himself up and tried to look like someone who hadn’t buried their head out of trauma. But the man said nothing, only fetching down more and more papers out of little cubbies, flipping one out of each and tying them together in mid-air with a ribbon that grew to fit the stack.
. He felt, somehow, that he would know. Someone would have told him. Or something would have shifted in the universe, some final veil unlifting like it had when Voldemort had died. Not like Malfoy was anything like Voldemort.
Harry could smell the bait, but he took it. “No one’s said. Probably fucked off to France or something, I should ask Kingsley if they’ve got him.”
“I just feel like I’ve abandoned both of them lately. I’ve been lying to them ever since I knew you were here, and they’re both going through a lot. Her parents, and now his brothers.”
, she mouthed, and drew a line across her throat.
“I know.” Draco brushed a hand through his hair, found the leaves, and scowled at him. Harry pressed his lips together to keep from laughing. “Now who’s the fucker?”
“What did you think?” Harry asked finally. He was afraid to voice the question, but he kept worrying the unfinished sentence in his mind like a toothache.
Malfoy, who was immovable and implacable and utterly lost to him.
They tipped out five shots — two couples and Harry — and tipped them back. Then they got ready.
“...tradition,” one was saying, which seemed right for a Malfoy portrait.
“You’ll leave when this is all over, then?” Draco’s voice was calm, but he’d straightened his back until he looked a bit like Lucius, in the dark.
“Promises,” the blond sniffed. “Well, I suppose the word of the future Head Auror is worth more than last season’s cast-offs. Or it will have to be.”
“It’s not the muggles,” Draco admitted. Harry stepped up onto the bridge with him, and Draco took a step back to keep their distance. “It’s just too careless. You brought me to your house, where people who could recognize me live. Why? Do you want us out of the manor so badly? Do you hate being trapped with me? Because you can leave anytime.” Harry cursed himself internally. He just hadn’t thought about it. He’d wanted to share something of himself with Draco, the way Draco had reluctantly ended up opening his home to him.
“I do,” Harry said immediately, and for a moment it felt like the room had stopped repressurising. He ran his hands through his hair, surely messing it up beyond any approximatoin of sex-tousled and well into something tangled and chaotic. “I do want you to be free. But you said you wanted to be safe.”
“You don’t know that,” Harry insisted, although he had the annoying feeling he did.
Draco bit his lip and looked down, and Harry closed the step between them before he could think better of it. He reached out, sliding his hand over Draco’s jaw, and as Draco looked back up Harry kissed him again. This kiss was slower and less frantic, a determined sort of statement that Harry tried to put everything into.
“What happened, Ron?” Harry asked quietly, and Rob leaned back in his chair, putting his feet up by Harry’s thigh.
“You have no idea what I want.” Draco’s expression was sad.
“Did you get any gifts, Harry?” Hannah asked, blowing on her tea and looking at him. He never would have predicted that a Hufflepuff would hold her liquor so well, but then, she had fought fiercely with Dumbledore’s Army after her mother’s death. Maybe he didn’t know her as well as he’d thought. Maybe everyone else had been busy growing up while he’d been camping and bargaining his soul.
“Maybe,” she said, and paused for a sip of her tea. “Maybe not.”
“I’m getting paranoid,” he mumbled to himself, rubbing his eyes. Draco’s room was last, and he sat on the bed to let his heart calm down. It was comfortable, almost warm in this tomb of a place. He was tempted to lay down and fall asleep right there… and because he was exhausted, and because it was his house, he did.
“This place knows me,” Harry said again, wearily. “The Manor doesn’t.” He’d barely been able to get through the front door, even after the bloodletting and the wand ceremony and a hundred more signatures. Its magic buffeted him gently back, not attacking, but not submitting either. Hermione and Zara had both, separately, recommend he spend more time there. But no one had thought he’d make a go of living in the abandoned Malfoy Manor.
, and come out with more empathy towards them.
” and he almost thought their pairing had been a punishment.
“Did you jump?” Harry was getting excited in that way that only flying opened up in his chest. Anticipation, adrenaline, that pure childhood joy of discovering another dimension. Draco drew backwards in the air, showing off while giving him room.
They walked away from the grand fireplace, down a rich wood hallway filled with sleeping portraits. The house was huge and still around them. Everything looked expensive, from the rugs to the doorknobs to the stained glass windows, which showed warped views of the grounds through panels of green and blue. Harry jumped when he saw something go past the window — an albino peacock, plump and lush and utterly unconcerned that its owners were dead or missing.
“I liked that one more than the others,” Draco said finally, as the lights came back on around them.
This time Draco helped him lay out ingredients and fetch out bowls, though he still wasn’t making eye contact and he’d taken a handful of potions into the bathroom with him before coming down. Harry had left his wand out on the counter, and Draco had wordlessly put it back in his pocket when he came back in.
He couldn’t stand to sit still with his thoughts. He showered and dressed as quickly as possible before pausing by the stretch of wall in the bedroom where Draco seemed to appear and disappear the most.
“That’s a big risk to take,” Harry pointed out. He was pacing, unwilling to sit down when he’d been called away from the garden. There was a koi pond he’d become fascinated with, going back every day to trim away more of the long grasses that had nearly hidden it. The koi were enormous and fat, silver and vibrant oranges, slippery blacks and shining scales. He thought they were hundreds of years old, maybe, and almost certainly magic. The pond seemed small for them, so he’d been rooting around looking for a shovel or some helpful spellbook in the gardening shed. Of course, this being the Malfoy Manor, the shed was more of an enormous converted stables. He’d only emerged from it, dusty and spiderweb-covered, when Hermione had sent her Patronus through the Floo. “I’m fine.”
The house liked it. As the energy between them sat humming somewhere between fever-lust and the crackle of bone-deep magic, as Harry seized the sharp curve of Draco’s shoulder and backed him down into the cushions, the manor made its approval known. Later Draco could explain the merging of its dual owners’ magic, but now he just gasped quietly as Harry sank down his body and the candelabras all burst into flame.
“So, as you can imagine, we’ll have to take a drop of your blood and perform a standard inspection of your wand.”
sorry, you know,” he told the wall, his cheek on his forearm as he faced the fresh stretch of paneling. “I shouldn’t have had a party. I shouldn’t have disappeared all weekend. I shouldn’t have forced you to go to London if you didn’t want to, and I shouldn’t have brought you where Hermione could see you. Maybe I shouldn’t have moved into your house and stayed.” He rolled onto his back. The ceiling was light, warm wood, with celestial lights embedded into it that seemed to shift with the seasons. He got lost in watching them, tracing constellations that he couldn’t name, even after months sleeping under the sky.
“Don’t do anything crazy,” Hermione said into his ear. Her bristly hair tickled. Ron wrapped his long arms around them both.
— but then Draco was digging his elbow into Harry’s ribs and they were trying to shove each other off the roof and then they had to rescue the wine bottle from sliding off the side and things calmed back down.
He yanked his trousers and boxers down as one, half-tripping over them as he stumbled forward a little, reaching for his shirt even as he caught himself. He yanked that off next, pulling his glasses off his face with the violent motion. They hit the floor somewhere in front of him, but he could hear better than see where. “Fuck,” he said, kicking blindly, somehow more irritated than before now. “Fuck!” He dropped down to hunt for the glasses, searching and naked and entirely furious.
Harry waited a long minute, but Draco didn’t speak again. Even from a metre away, his eyelids looked translucent, the bags under them as deep as the manor’s shadows.
“Your bird will get in,” Draco said, mirroring Harry’s thoughts, though his eyes were unreadable.
“Me? Oh.” Harry frowned at his own expression. “I suppose.” He cast a vision spell and plucked off his glasses, dropping them on the console table. Now Draco was the one looking too long, and Harry flushed. He knew most people didn’t see him without his glasses, and it wasn’t that he felt he looked bad without them, it was just a little like losing a security blanket. “How’s that?”
“Where do they come from?”
“Hey,” Harry said softly, turning his chin so he was peering right into Draco’s face, their mouths so close that he had to ignore the pointed perfection of Draco’s teeth. Draco licked his lips, as if he saw where Harry’s eyes were drifting, as if he was anticipating something — a kiss, a telling-off for their shared space. “Wasn’t it your birthday before I got here?”
“That’s comforting, thanks. You’re just a generic asshole, not a prejudiced one.”
, I  want you to
know what he wanted. Who he wanted. And he had thought that Draco knew it, too.
“And you’re a homewrecking room stealer. Literally a homewrecker. The wood from those floors you Vanished came from an extinct forest, you know.”
“Just what I said.” Harry bristled. He was dying for her to leave already, to get out and leave Draco just to him again, for however long they had before his trap was unsprung. “Look, it’s a good thing that I found him and got my friends involved, okay? Ron said you would be cool—”
Williamson stepped forward. “Sir, we don’t have anything to accuse anyone of. From all we know, no crimes have been committed. Mr. Malfoy has never been charged with anything, and he only came up in our records because he’s legally dead.”
Everyone stared, for a beat. And then Ron shrugged. “You heard the birthday boy; Malfoy!”
What did that mean, had the Aurors been to the manor again? Had they come to look for Harry again and found him gone, too busy eating biscuits to protect Draco from the thing that he was most afraid of? “Harry, I have to change.”
MALFOY HEIR MISSING, the Prophet said, above a pixelated photo of Draco, his face cropped out from some gala shot with his father. Lucius’ shoulder still remained half in-frame, looming up and over to the side, casting a shadow on Draco’s elegant, blinking face. Elegant? Pointy, he meant.
No sooner did the thought of how nice and cool it looked cross Harry’s mind before Draco was slipping his shoes off, hopping from one foot to another to unearth his shockingly pale feet. He stuffed his socks into the shoes before leaning down, cuffing his pants in a few practiced motions. “Fancy a dip?”
Draco kissed him. Harry’s breath was whiskey-stale and Draco was practically vibrating with anxiety, pressing his lips to Harry’s like he was determining the right way to do it. His fingers flitted up to Harry’s cheek, pressing in to hold him in place, as though there was anywhere in the world that Harry would rather be.
“I’m pretty sure my parents would have been fighting next to me if they were still around. But I don’t know if I could have walked into the woods if they had been back at the castle. I guess we’ll never know.”
Suddenly it wasn’t funny anymore. Harry could feel his body beginning to react to Draco, the dreams he’d tamped down suddenly faced with the physical reality of Draco’s breath on his arm.
“Well, we wish you would go on a date or something. Hannah was asking about you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m asking you to stay,” Draco confirmed. He reached up, grasping Harry’s wrists in return. Their hands squeezed, pulled apart, palms sliding and fingers tangling. “And  I— I also…”
They hit a set of stairs, and Harry let Draco lead the way back up to the street. He hesitated, then went right, and Harry followed without complaint.
“Books are a good idea,” Draco said, missing Harry’s tone of voice. “Are those hobknobs?”
She seemed to find that funny. “Why, everything he does. It's a lot like you.”
The morning of the meeting with Pansy came too soon, in Harry’s opinion. Draco spent the time fretting and then denying that he was fretting, acting like a cat with its back up whenever Harry tried to bring up the topic. Instead he let Draco and Hermione whisper at each other through the Floo, escaped to the living room or Grimmauld to watch telly with Ron, and only talked to Draco about dinner or Betty White or the wonky portrait on the second floor that had been hiccuping for a week.
“You need money?” Harry was confused. “Don’t you have money?”
I walk through walls
“You’re faffing about,” she countered, gesturing at him with her wand. He had to stop himself from jumping back, out of sheer instinct. “You’ve muck on your nose, your hair looks a mess—”
“Draco?”
Hermione slipped into the hug, and Harry’s cheek smooshed into hers as Ron adjusted his grip. Hermione laughed, her breath skirting across his face in a wash of maple.
“Thanks,” Harry said, picking up the stack and wishing he felt like reading them. “And the coverage about the Malfoys?”
“It’s not up to you what’s “just” anything.” Draco’s fear was back, recognizable even through the brown of his transfigured eyes. “I’m not ready. We haven’t even talked about it. She doesn’t even know, right? You’ve been hiding me from everyone, that has to be for a reason.”
Draco settled into Harry’s lap like a warm, perfect weight, and then his movement reminded Harry of everything else there was to do in a bath, besides compare their scars. He skimmed his hands down Draco’s long, jutting spine, back up his stark ribs and down again to the soft skin of his arse, which luckily was still plump and soft, though perhaps smaller than usual. “I’m going to fatten you back up,” Harry murmured, gripping the area in question, and Draco laughed while squirming.
, again, about Draco Malfoy.
“So what happened?” Hermione tucked her wand back into her pocket and touched his nose with concern. “Want a fix?”
“Helps you commune with the house’s magic? Makes perfect sense, Harry, I was just proving a point. Anyway, about her ideas—”
“Because you’re very stupid,” Draco said pleasantly, and kissed him.
“Come here,” Harry whispered, and Draco came to the side of the tub, letting Harry run his hands up and down his torso, tugging down to rid him of his pants. “Let me see.”
He waited on Ron’s desk, playing with a small figure of the Chudley Cannons beater that wanted to attack his fingers and the quills on the desk. A desk over, Pansy was reluctantly collaborating with Hermione on their report, both girls nodding and pointing in turn.
“And I’d keep your relationship out of it until after the trial, if you could,” she was saying, when the Floo flared again and Ron and Pansy entered.
Ron and Harry glanced at each other. Hermione supported Harry’s going to the Manor, but she sure as hell wasn’t going with him. Not with MUDBLOOD carved in silver on her skin.
He put it down to opportunity: he knew from years of hassling Ron in the dorms that Draco was at the perfect stage for truth-telling. Harry pushed his advantage. “Do you like cooking?”
“If you’d married Ginny, we’d be playing quidditch right now,” he sighed. He looked right in the Auror chair, the robes clashing with his hair in a way that seemed utterly Ron. He looked every inch the up-and-coming Auror, when once he had been a little boy, explaining to Harry that he had gotten presents. Harry remembered Ron’s push to steal the flying car, his insistence on sacrificing himself in high-stakes chess, his busting Harry free from another abusive summer. He’d be a good Auror, maybe the best, and Harry had never been more grateful that he’d come to share Harry’s train car on the Hogwarts Express.
It was quiet in here too, but there were some signs that Draco had been in the room before Harry invaded his space again. There was a glass of wine on the desk, unempty, and a blanket nest askew on the bed. The closet door was missing, a blank expanse on the wall where it once had been.
“Timing is going to be everything,” he said at last, lowering the book and looking to Hermione.
Draco seemed to press a smile away with his lips. “Why? Fancy getting beat at Quidditch?”
“I’m as happy as I can be right now, I think,” he assured her, knowing she’d understand that a hundred percent was still impossible. “But I love you for asking.”
It was wide as a bed and unbelievably comfortable, blankets and pillows crushed and tangled beneath their knees as they faced each other. The journey from the front door hadn’t been a long one, but Harry had lost some of his nerve at the hallway’s rich wooden threshold.
Draco’s hands on him tightened, and Harry felt the power shifting and crackling between them as Draco leaned in to bite his collarbone, his grip on Harry becoming insistent. A blush was climbing up Harry’s throat alongside the press of Draco’s mouth: he had never been grabbed and pushed and ground on this way, and it did something satisfying to him that he would never have predicted.
Harry emerged from his drunkenness slowly, nodding quietly through hours of conversation about everyone’s exciting new life plans, eventually accepting a cup of tea that Luna appeared with at some point. She had a whole teapot hovering behind her with a little army of cups, actually, and he was fairly sure that none of them were from the manor.
Rothschild.”
“Of course. Of course, Ron, I’m sorry that I won’t be beside you.” Harry shuffled forward, and Ron closed their distance with a bear-sized hug. Harry’s next words were lost in Ron’s Cannons sweater. “You’re going to do great, though. Everyone will see that.”
“He’s the Minister for Magic, Potter,” he explained, his voice cool but quiet. “You can’t do your boy wonder bit here.”
Ron gripped the back of his neck with a hand like a pincher. “Come on mate, lunch. I’ll cook if you show me around the kitchen. Oh! Or do you still have mum’s chicken and dumplings? George came by and ate all of our leftovers the other day, I mean, I’m glad he’s got his appetite back, but Merlin, at what cost?”
Harry made the walk back to Grimmauld with a busted nose and a stranger’s face.
“Mmm.” Harry’s blood chilled when he remembered Malfoy. Fuck, it had been hours and hours, and he’d gotten entirely distracted. Malfoy probably thought that Harry had abandoned him again, and wandless once more. He had to get back. But… “I should stay with you tonight, though.”
“No,” Harry groused, at the same time Draco said “As I’ll ever be.” They glanced at each other, but Harry could only shrug, and then Draco and Hermione were going over their plan one more time.
“I was getting to it,” Draco huffed, but now he was pink too.
disappeared at some point. She had been drinking wine. And she had been here before, as family and as a prisoner and as Harry’s guest. “She saw you? What did she say?”
“As if you even could,” Harry shot back, truly indignant.
George showed up, towed by an over-enthusiastic Lee, who kept a sharp eye on him and didn’t accept any drinks. Harry and Ron swept him up at once, making safe conversation about Quidditch, and by the time he felt comforted by the rusty return of George’s laughter, a dozen more of Ginny’s friends had arrived.
The fire had died down, and the projector was sending white light out onto the wall before them, no movies playing through the night now that Draco was watching with him. They’d entered into a secret friendship, a strange intimacy that only now was Harry assessing with wide-open eyes. It must have been that shared link that tangled itself up in Harry’s brain and sent him confusing signals. It couldn’t mean anything.
“That’s it, everyone out.” The Minister pointed to the door. “Weasley, Parkinson, write a report. Miss Granger, you may go with them. Savage and Williamson, you get out too. Make damn sure there’s a charge you can lay on the boy, as you should have done before hauling him in.”
Back with Draco, in their own little world.
“Would you say that about Weasley? Would she keep a secret from him? They’ll just assume I brainwashed you over the summer. They might even think they’re helping you by turning me in.” Draco shook his head. “I have to go back.”
Within minutes they had gained an insistence that felt impossible to recover from — like stopping now, or ever, would be the most devastating thing Harry could ever experience. He’d kissed some boys and submitted to Ginny’s athletic approaches to copulation, but now he felt a drive to
Near the fire as they were, Harry was over-hot on one side, almost cold on the other. Draco’s hands on, under, exploring and stretching him sent a new alertness through his body from teeth  to toes, the buzz of frightful newness working to fight the tired slide of the food and weed and drink of the day in his belly. Hot, cold, tired, trembling, he felt a million conflicting things the moment he wriggled
Harry found wine and a carved wooden tray in the pantry and brought them up to the guest bathroom, which was a stodgy marble affair, all gilded faucets and permanently-blooming orchids. A stained glass wall was charmed to overlook the grounds, where late afternoon light was leeching in. By now Hermione would be at Hogwarts, but for once Harry felt okay about being holed up in the manor instead.
“And there are no returning Gryffindor girls.” Ron’s wolfish expression made sense now.
“Just around here, actually.” Harry gestured at the sign above the street they were approaching. “Two blocks down on the left. Want to see it?”
“I do,”  Draco said, still in that soft voice. “Is that —you think I won’t be safe? And so you’re worried and being weird?”
They made it back to the waterway and down into the canal. Once they were alone again, surrounded by cool cement walls and quiet water, Draco spun around. “We have to go back.”
“I’m still a Malfoy. You can’t have forgotten.” Draco glared at him, his eyes alive with a healthy fury that made Harry oddly proud of him, even as he took two steps back, away from the warmth of the  fire. Draco’s voice got lower, quieter. “You said you wanted me to be free.”
“What can
The warmth behind their bickering dissipated in an instant. Draco swung his head up to stare into Harry’s face, his eyes huge. “Did you—”
Harry spent the rest of the afternoon working on the pond, but he barely deepened it, with no wand to focus his magical effort, and he gave up in a fit of annoyance a few hours later. He stormed back into the house, annoyed at the pond and the weird way the magic here only half-accepted him, the way he was being forced into things by his friends and the weird feeling of not
And they drank.
“But I could sense the spell. They can’t sense it?” Draco was looking over every stranger that streamed past. An old woman whose bag was bursting with herbs. Two businessmen, hurrying back from lunch with flushed cheeks. A baby in the arms of its mother, just scrunching its face up to cry. None of them gave the two boys on the bench a second glance.
It was nice. He didn’t feel that weird loneliness he had on his birthday, seeing evidence of his friends moving in and moving on. It only made him miss Draco, which irritated him, since he’d just seen the fucker, and he redoubled his efforts in following the conversation. They’d moved to the kitchen counter, which was just as packed, and just as  homey.
“Fuck, Malfoy….” Harry sat back up. Draco looked at him, and his face had set back into a mask of cool air. Harry had mourned his parents for years without even knowing them - it had to be infinitely harder and more complicated for Draco. Harry wanted to say that he’d owed Narcissa his life. That he didn’t blame Draco anymore for what he’d done as a kid. That he was sorry he’d said anything. Instead he passed the shopping bag over and asked, “Did you eat dinner?”
“They got over that, you’re dead now,” Harry assured him, and had a crumpled paper tossed at him in response.
“I just don’t like this feeling that it’s a given that I have to do or be a certain thing, when I’ve never tried anything else, you know?” He shrugged.
Could it be a Death-”
They’d fought before, with wands and fists and feet, and it felt right to do it again. When Draco managed to shove him over, Harry stuck an elbow in his face. Draco yanked on his hair, then yowled when Harry went for his.
beautiful, he could admit that his brain was right about that, at least. In his sleep he looked peaceful and perfect, nothing like the difficult and infuriating person he would become again in the morning. The spoilt and vicious Draco who got under Harry’s skin, who understood Harry’s darker impulses, who missed his mother. It was too much to process, and that was without considering the black Dark Mark that was etched on his outstretched arm.
It was worth it. In place of the monogrammed, contained shrubbery he’d planted flowers. Lilies on one side. Narcissus on the other.
“I don’t want to be an Auror,” Harry said automatically, before parsing the rest of Draco’s statement. “Wait, that almost sounded like a compliment.”
The master bedroom was rich and red, draperies dripping in black and gold. It was almost Gryffindor-like, save for the extravagance and malicious aura. Lucius’ snake cane was propped up in a corner, and seeing it, Harry’s throat felt like it was closing. He opened Narcissa’s cupboard on a whim: beautiful robes and woven gowns crowded against one another. Harry touched one, suddenly sad. He wouldn’t miss Narcissa, exactly, but the war had taken as many of the wrong people as it had taken the right ones.
“Hmm.” Hermione looked at him again, sideways. “And that’s what you want? To wait and see what happens?”
“Don’t you dare,” Harry ground out, swatting Draco’s hand away. “You can’t come until I fuck you.”
to Confound the cinema guard and then when I tried to escape I ran into your Weasley—”
Was he ruining everything? Or was it far too late already?
he was presumed dead,” Savage corrected, his good looks twisted with an unpleasant excitement. “This may well be the last great Death Eater capture, and I won’t have that treated lightly.”
“I think being born to be a certain way is overrated,” she answered seriously.
It turned out that Draco, though a solid player, was nowhere near as adept as Ron at the game. For once, Harry stood a chance, and echoes of a familiar rivalry sprung up between them as they played. Harry even kept his face stony and began to cheat, setting up a two-dimensional feint as good as any Wronksi. It took Draco the loss of two pawns and a knight to catch on, and the dawning indignance on his face was worth every bit of effort.
Draco looked around, and Harry watched his eyes move from person to car to streetlight. “You know those things we watched?”
When they went back inside, Harry found that he was drunker than anticipated. He tripped over the windowsill coming in, and had to catch himself against the wall. “Fuck.”
Draco picked up his broom again and turned away from Harry. His shoulders were stiff, but he continued buffing out a grass stain without saying anything else, so Harry took that as his invitation to continue.
“Did you have pancakes?” Harry asked, intrigued.
“You’re the one being difficult,” Harry said at last from his lap, although it wasn’t not true. His scalp hurt when Draco released him.
“Harry knows all about that,” Luna said, elbowing Harry, who bore it good-naturedly. “I do, too. I always thought
“How is Luna?” Draco made eye contact, and that time it stuck. Harry relaxed into Draco’s lap a bit, a little worried that he was too heavy or distributed in too ungainly a way but mostly uncaring in the face of being allowed this, the comfort of keeping Draco settled underneath him.
“Glad you could join us,” he finally heard Draco say, furious, from their — Draco’s — bedroom.
Where Draco before had hung weightless in a swallowing water, he now drifted free from gravity. Harry fell and fell into his chest and was held aloft, feet in the air but safe in the space of the walls that wrapped around them. It felt right, natural, rotating and colliding gently like new planets in a house-shaped universe.
“No one said that,” Draco said cagily, looking behind him as though Harry was talking to some other blond git. “I was merely suggesting, since you’re so determined not to leave my home, that you could get us something to fix this buggering headache before the peacocks start going off.”
Dean gave Harry a hug and let Ginny go next, and Harry squeezed her hard. “I  get it now,” he whispered to her, on a whim that made Hannah glance at them before exiting. “What you meant. Good luck in New York.”
“We had to protect our knowledge, because without tradition, there would be no magical way of education, of life. Extinction, they called it. And it scared me so much as a kid, these muggles with blood that may as well be dead without magic, that killed my grandmother’s grandmother. But then in school Granger was better than me. And you were...you were you. That was the first time I wondered if he was wrong.”
They found a safe patch of dirt to sit in and got comfortable, passing the bottle back and forth as they let the bowtruckles run across their hands. Harry had a pretty good game going with his original one and a couple more who had showed up: he’d skim his lit wand across the ground, and they’d race after it, climbing over each other and criss-crossing the wand.
“Yeah, mate, war’s over. You’re off the clock. Sleep, go ‘round mine, I won’t even be around to get all weird about you and Gin.” Ron clapped him on the back in an encouraging sort of way.
“He was wrong. He was stupid. I thought he was acting on something real, but he didn’t know anything. Look at them.” Harry looked. A teenager across the street was trying to light a cigarette while being dragged by his dog, a phone pressed to his ear as he struggled. Two little girls were being chased by their harried father. Over and over again the scene in front of them was resetting and emptying and refilling itself with humanity. But Harry liked his neighborhood for its busyness, the way there was always a pub open or a takeaway to try. He felt anonymous there, tucked in unnoticed like a human version of Grimmauld Place.
Another thump sounded, and Harry whirled on it. It sounded like something in the wall, and he relaxed slightly, letting his shoulders down a bit and breathing out. It was probably just vermin, sneaking in through the worn-down maintenance spells from the home’s months of sitting empty. There had been mice sometimes, in his cupboard growing up. A place like this probably had hundreds.
