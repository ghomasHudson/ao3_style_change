“You’re early,” he croaked. Harry could see the faint glisten of tears in his deep grey eyes. A wave of concern washed over him.
So far it seemed that Malfoy did not have any malicious intent in asking Harry for help. It had been about a month. Even Ron had accepted that he wasn’t up to anything, though he still expressed his disapproval about the situation.
Both Harry and Hermione had been staying at the Weasley’s house ever since the battle, which Harry was tremendously grateful for. He didn’t know what he would have done without Ron and Hermione these past few weeks. Harry quietly got out of bed, trying not to disturb Ron. He tiptoed to his trunk in the corner of his room to grab a Quidditch book. He turned back around, only to find Ron sitting up, staring at him with a dazed expression on his face. Harry jumped, startled. He then scowled.
Ron and Harry looked at each other, knowing that whenever that glint came up, she was planning something big. They would just have to wait to see what it was.
On another note, Harry had been trying to talk to Ginny again. He wasn’t sure how the ‘breakup’ had gone, but he missed her frivolous chatter and tenacious attitude. Just because he didn’t like her romantically anymore didn’t mean he liked her any less as a person. She was kind (except for when she was playing Quidditch), loyal, feisty and humorous, all the traits you would want in a good friend.
When Harry brought this up to Ron and Hermione, they had just shrugged and said that the less Malfoy opened his mouth, the better. Harry ultimately agreed with that, so he tried to put it out of his mind.
Harry woke to the sounds of birds chirping lightly outside the window. The Quidditch book lay on his face and his glasses were askew, digging into his nose. Brushing the book off and adjusting his glasses, he turned around to find that Ron’s bed was empty. Harry quickly got dressed, prepared for the morning and headed down for breakfast.
“It’s my mother,” Malfoy started, his voice cracking slightly. “Ever since my father’s arrest, she hasn’t been the same. But because I’m here, it’ll be worse. She’s all alone. I thought it would be okay but it isn’t. She hasn’t replied to my owl in weeks.” The pain on his face was unbearable; Harry had to look away.
Harry didn’t mind waiting, but he wondered how much time she would need before it went back to normal.
When Ron left to find Ginny (Mrs Weasley had sent them letters), Hermione leaned over towards Harry.
Before they knew it, the sorting was complete, introductions had been made and the feast was over. Professor McGonagall was doing a fantastic job as Headmistress, as Harry knew she would. However, she still emanated that feeling of sadness that a lot of other people carried as well.
“Bloody hell mate, you should’ve seen your face!” he choked out, making an exaggerated expression, intended to replicate Harry’s.
Many pairs of curious eyes had already found their way to Harry and Ginny. They headed towards a less crowded part of the room.
“That‘s settled then. We will get your books next week,” Mrs Weasley said brightly, though Harry swore that he could see her eyes brimming with tears.
Harry returned to the castle. Everywhere he looked he saw relieved, but mourning people. He spotted Ron, Hermione and the Weasley family almost immediately. They were all huddled closely together, many of them tear stricken. Harry felt his own eyes well up involuntarily. He ran towards them, hugging Ron and Hermione first, then the rest of the Weasleys. All of them were now sobbing silently, tears streaming down their ashy faces. They crowded together, forming a tight knit circle. They all stood like that for a while, each one of them grieving and understanding each other’s pain. Even amidst all that was going on, you could almost feel their hearts breaking. But, as they all knew, there would always be a sliver of hope. They could never be irreparably broken.
“I just think there’s no use hating him. Besides, you’re right, it’s only because I thought it was the right thing to do to help him, and also it’s good practice for myself,” Harry said.
“So, how is your mother?” Harry asked, changing the subject abruptly (heat had risen in his cheeks— it was quite embarrassing). Malfoy’s face turned sombre in an instant, making Harry immediately regret bringing it up.
Harry sighed at his own stupidity and went back to his original position. What had he expected, for Malfoy to say yes, for them to become friends? What a ridiculous thought. Yet somewhere, deep down, Harry really had expected something different from what he got.
“Would we… be able to do this again sometime?” Malfoy said timidly, a vast contrast to his usual snobbish self.
“That git,” Ron said sourly, “Of course he’s returning. Just what we needed, another year with Malfoy.”
“And what makes you think I want to hang out with you lot?” Malfoy said smoothly, looking down at his chipped nails. Harry smirked.
Harry cleared his throat then meekly said: “I would like to head back. Only if Ron and Hermione are going, of course.”
Thankfully, Ron dropped the subject for now, and the trio continued discussing their Potions essay that was due the next day.
Harry thought. He knew it was probably a bad idea; Malfoy was most likely up to something. But the image of Malfoy’s sad spell attempt came flooding in his mind and Harry couldn’t help but feel sorry for him.
One day, in Defence Against the Dark Arts, the class was practising quite a difficult shielding spell. Harry was succeeding at performing it— he was one of the only few who could. Even Hermione had not completely gotten the hang of it yet. Harry glanced around the room and spotted Malfoy. He looked as pale and tired as ever. His feeble attempt to conjure the spell filled Harry with unwanted pity.
“I don’t know, it’s just a few weeks or months ago you hated his guts, and now you’re helping him with Defence Against the Dark Arts and clearly
Harry arrived in the empty classroom for another lesson. This time he found Malfoy sitting in the corner of the room, facing the blank wall. He was clutching his knees to his chest, his head buried in his knees. He heard Harry close the door and jumped up, wiping his eyes.
This was partially a lie; Harry actually enjoyed the classes, and he was starting to appreciate Malfoy’s company. He wasn’t who Harry thought he was. Not that Ron had to know this.
Harry thought. Hogwarts was as beautiful as before, a magnificent structure with even more beauty held inside.
Harry returned to Ron and Hermione. He would tell them about Ginny later. He said goodnight to both of them, then headed upstairs, where he lay awake for hours, unable to get the thought of Malfoy or Ginny out of his mind.
“Harry, this is the 3rd time we’ve had to listen to you talk about Malfoy,” Hermione said impatiently. She was editing a scroll for Transfiguration, even though she had already revised it four times.
“Listen to Hermione, mate,” Ron cut in, “We know you hate Malfoy, we all do, but it’s not as if you expected anything different right? You were just trying to be nice, to reconcile and all that nonsense.”
“Harry, you do realise this is the person that has been racially discriminatory towards me for 7 years of my life? How could you take his side over mine? Aren’t we best friends?” Hermione said irately, though she was still trying to be fair.
“Fine,” Hermione said, “As long as you realise that he’s still rude and obnoxious and you’re only teaching him for unity’s sake.”
“I was wondering if you could… help me with Defence Against the Dark Arts. I’ve been having a little bit of trouble,” he said in a cool tone.
They ate, making light, but subdued conversation. Suddenly, a a large brown owl landed on the windowsill. Mrs Weasley opened the window to let it in. She grabbed the 4 letters that the owl carried. They all caught a glimpse of the Hogwarts crest. Mrs Weasley passed out the letters to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny. They all knew that Ginny’s would entail her Hogwarts letter for her final year, but were unsure what Harry, Ron and Hermione’s would be about.
“Oh don’t make a scene, you baby, I hear you loud and clear. I just often choose not to partake in your dramatics and instead spare myself by feigning deafness.”
“Come here you big baby! These bad boys are loaded with my sweat and I’m— oh, Draco!” She falters, stopping for a moment to address Draco.
They all freeze up in fear. That’s not a flimsy claim coming from Millie. Not the girl who shaved Pansy’s when she used the last of Millie’s shampoo during second year. She refused to grow it back until the following day, which, for Pansy, was considered utter torture.
Draco wants to scream and call for someone to rescue him, but he knows no one in their right mind would want to help him. A small part of him feels like he almost deserves this.
As soon as Coach Sylvester walks off, Draco can't hold back a laugh, which instantly recaptures the attention of the two dunderheads.
“Alright, you wimpy British geeks, listen up,” Coach Sylvester barks as she stomps up next to McGonagall. She faces them all with a fierceness that Draco feels heavily resembles Snape’s look of contempt. The thought of his late favorite professor puts a pit in his stomach.
Draco rolls his eyes out of fondness and takes a sip of the drink which is, of course, made to his liking. He glances over to the hat, debating if his fifteen year friendship with Pansy is worth humiliating himself. But then he remembers wearing it won’t make much of a difference in his social standing, and promptly places it on his head.
He trusts Hermione’s judgement, so he won’t directly intervene. However, he can’t shake the feeling that Malfoy is trying to take advantage of her. It doesn’t hurt to see what Malfoy has been up to lately. The map and invisibility cloak folded in the bottom of his trunk come to mind.
Draco shoots out of his seat, wanting to be as far away from this classroom—and Potter—as possible. As he approaches the door, eyes zeroing in on the handle, Potter walks right in front of him and blocks his sight, the inconsiderate git. Spitefully, Draco picks up his pace.
“Well, you deserved it!” He calls, casting a silent Expelliarmus before she can continue her barrage of hexes. In response, Pansy crosses her arms with a huff and glares at him. Sometimes, he finds that Pansy looks no different than she did as the spoiled, petulant child she once was. It’s both adorable and nauseating.
“No, you dolt, if you weren’t such a swot and left the dorm every once in a while, you’d know that Smith is spreading around that Draco cheated in the game. She also found out that Potter was apparently his previous target.” Blaise corrects.
Draco is impressed, although not too surprised by Longbottom’s dauntless behavior. During the final battle, Longbottom finally grew into his Gryffindor shell when he charged into the fight, battling dozens of Death Eaters before slaying Nagini. Despite still acting a bit shy at times, nothing seems to intimidate him anymore. Draco doesn’t blame him though. If he had defied the Dark Lord to his snake-like face, declaring that he would join him when hell freezes over, he too would no longer find anything else to be even remotely terrifying.
After a beat he finally glances down and opens his hand. There, sitting calmly in the center of his palm, is the shiny, circular object in question.
She stalks off, leaving him there looking stunned. The air doesn't feel quite as cold anymore. He quickly squats down and grabs the snitch, not allowing himself time to process what the Weasley girl said. He mounts his broom and casts a good sticking charm on his hat before shooting into the air. Draco heads over to his group resolutely, determined to make these the damn best seekers anyone has ever seen.
and incog for beta-ing this chapter! Also, thank you all so much for your kudos and comments, they make my day!! <3
“You didn’t expect me to be easy now did you?” Draco arches a brow. “So, I’m curious as to how you were able to intervene so soon. It’s a bit of a coincidence that you appeared quick enough to subdue him before it escalated.”
Draco enters the expansive bedroom that no longer feels like his own and fixes his sight on a section of the far wall behind the bed. He walks across the room to the unobstructed expanse beside his bed. Patterns of bright flowers spiral wildly across the bedroom wall, enchanting and vibrant. Upon closer inspection, the design is interrupted by tens of small identical lines, carved one after the other in perfect rows and columns.
Draco dodges her attack by moving off the couch, and she falls face first into the arm of the couch, her body laid across Greg’s lap. Draco laughs mockingly while Greg looks equally bewildered and amused at Pansy’s antics.
They stare at each other for a moment, and every second makes Draco gradually more uncomfortable. He simultaneously wants to step closer towards him, perhaps feel the strength in his arms once more and run as far away from him as possible—it’s a terrible dilemma. Eventually, Draco settles with shoving Potter’s shoulder lightly before storming off to his room. He can hear Potter laughing behind him, and he hates how much he likes the sound of it. That wasn’t meant to be funny, it was supposed to be threatening.
This wasn’t so bad when he was practicing on his own terms, with no pressure, but having to learn this for class has made it even more difficult. He knows that Potter is going to tease him mercilessly about his inability to cast it, and there won’t be much for Draco to counter with. Nothing that wouldn’t likely put himself in Azkaban.
They walk down to the Great Hall together in surprisingly relative silence. Draco didn't think she would be so bothered by what happened, but maybe she’s just desperate for him to stay in the game.
How Theo has managed to remain so humble and unpresuming throughout the years is unfathomable to Draco. The idea of keeping his own accomplishments to himself sounds nearly impossible. He peeks a look at Theo, and thankfully, his attention is on Pansy who is so enthralled that Draco could vanish her clothes and she would fail to notice.
Draco’s words get cut off as someone bursts in from the bathroom and barrels towards him who, to Draco’s horror, is Millie. He swiftly dives off the side of his bed, his body smacking hard against the ground. He pushes through the sharp pain in his ribs as he reaches for his hat resting on the floor. He shoves it on his head just in time as Millie shoots him with the water gun.
“You’re cute when you’re angry,” Potter laughs. “And hey, it was only fair,” he says, holding his hand out to him.
But during this class, he can't resist the urge to look. Even in such a disheveled state with his unruly hair under the pointy hat, his tie severely crooked, Potter is captivating. Draco has no idea why, and it infuriates him. He just wishes Potter would stop being so
Now, sitting visibly in the front, Theo would be unable to pull any stunts on him without being chastened by Madam Pince. Even if he did attempt anything, Draco’s consolation would be getting a show out of it.
“You don’t need to tell me that,” she says, flushing in embarrassment. Unlike the other Slytherins, Millie has never been versed at accepting compliments. On more than one occasion, Blaise has earned a punch in the face for his expressions of praise in an attempt to push her buttons—to the amusement of Draco and Pansy.
Draco remembers accepting it begrudgingly, choosing instead to curl into him, tucking his head into Theo’s neck.
Draco scoffs, choosing to ignore the slight on his magical capabilities. He’d prefer Potter to think he’s been Draco’s target since eliminating Smith, for Pansy’s sake. “Seems you have some common sense in you after all, I was starting to doubt it. Well, make sure to check beneath your bed every night, because I may pop up one night. Be scared, Potter.”
“From my blood rituals in the Forbidden Forest, of course. How else?” Draco sniffs, arching an eyebrow. The threat seems to be wearing off, as no one seems nearly as shaken as they used to. He’s both relieved and disappointed. “Who doesn’t have that, Finnigan?”
Harry looks up, finding her at the Gryffindor table looking as fiery as ever. Her sleek, red hair reaches down to her lower back now, and her smile is blinding as she laughs at someone’s joke.
“Today is not about my rivalry with Potter. If you all plan to make the team, then I suggest we get started. Get in the air while I go grab the snitch,” he instructs firmly.
“Well,” Draco sniffs. “You should be! You couldn’t out-stealth me if your life depended on it. I’ve already caught you following me. Aren’t you planning to become an Auror? You lack complete subtlety, you’re like a Hippogriff in an antique store.”
Draco has never heard of him in his life, though he hardly knows much about the American version of Quidditch, which is a poor alternative in his opinion. He’s also not quite convinced she’s telling the truth, but he doesn’t dispute her. “That’s… wonderful. How does it exactly work…?”
The other day, when he was minding his own business, he was rudely accosted by Coach Sylvester as he was exiting the library. She insisted that he assist her with the quidditch club she’s starting with the younger years. She believes it's a good way to “whip those rascals into shape to prepare for the team, if they can even make it on.”
Blaise gives him a disinterested look before turning back into the bathroom. Not a moment later, a jinx shoots straight in Draco’s direction. Draco darts out of the way in time, laughing at Blaise’s poor attempt. “I thought you had better aim than that, Blaise. Pity.”
Draco stops and slowly drops his arms beside him, gazing into the stunning, light blue eyes that just don’t seem quite right. They’re soft, comforting. Like the sky on a clear day. When the bees buzz about and children play merrily until nightfall.
Draco envisions Theo in his mind, his lips on his own. Draco’s fingers carding through his soft, sandy hair, taking in the sight of his comforting eyes. He casts, the words coming out as a whisper, and opens his eyes.
She narrows her eyes at him slightly, searching his face. If she’s suspecting something, she doesn’t mention it.
When McGonagall begins passing out the pieces of parchment, Pansy turns to Draco, bursting with excitement, “This is going to be so fun! I have an excuse to attack people!” She beams, grasping his arm.
Over the course of 42 non-consecutive days, Draco had memorized every fact about the crafting of wands. His old wand, 10" long, made of hawthorn wood, with a unicorn hair core, represented contradicting nature along with faithfulness. The new wand set with various limitations was 12 ¾ inches long, made of ebony, and had a phoenix core. Ebony’s compatibility lay within courageous, strong-minded individuals, and when mixed with the phoenix’s adamant independence and judiciousness with its chosen owner, it proves to be an exceptional match. In other words, it was, quite frankly, the worst combination for Draco to use as a tool for his magic.
“Yes, congratulations Potter, would you like a prize? I’m sure McGonagall would be willing to give you one thousand house points toward Gryffindor, perhaps even an extra five just for breathing,” Draco says, rolling his eyes.
Draco crosses his arms, frowning down at his bed. “...because he’s a bespectacled, undignified git. With a bird’s nest as hair,” he says weakly.
After the next, only 217 days will remain, although in reality, Draco knows his sentence is truly life-long. He’s aware that nothing will ever be the same again, and it may be for the better, despite it being against his self-interest. The Malfoy name has been tarnished far past the point of restoration. Even the defense of Harry Potter—the now Savior of the Wizarding World—could not manage to gain an ounce of sympathy from those his family had harmed. This was not something Draco failed to anticipate; not after the hundreds of irrevocable breaches created by the brief flashes of green light. Occurrences that never should have taken place.
“Interesting, it appears that someone else is in more dire need of Draco’s attention,” Pansy says smugly, looking at Draco pointedly.
Sue gives him a grim smile, seemingly accepting that answer, and stands from  her chair. She takes slow steps over to the window, peering out of it thoughtfully. “I appreciate that.”
Draco doesn’t return his gaze, still staring down at the unopened letter. “Yes, why? Seeking to make passionate, steamy love in the Forbidden Forest?”
“Well, that was because of the fancy brooms your Father bought the entire team, but I don't have a reason to put my faith in you,” she says, crossing her arms.
Harry hadn’t been about to apologise but he let Draco continue because two apologies in one day was something he’d never dreamed of.
He heard Draco sigh followed by a rustle of sheets. He rose from the bed and Harry made to follow him aware that something about this was wrong.
Flashes of what happened last year found their way to his present thoughts and Harry could not help the pit of fear in his stomach. It was official, Voldemort was really back and amassing followers once more. The thought of having to defeat someone so powerful, with so much more experience... he wasn't even human.
Harry took a shuddering breath and blinked back the tears. He was glad Draco chose that exact moment to speak.
Malfoy and it made him even angrier than usual. Malfoy had obviously taken something. And if Harry did not know any better he would think he was drunk. Contraband was strictly forbidden in school. Of course Malfoy would have some stashed somewhere.
Why had no one told him? If he had known… what then? It wouldn’t have changed anything except that he would have known some part of his godfather few had. Would it still have hurt as much to lose him?
It seemed to make Malfoy snap out whatever it was had taken a hold of him. Harry watched as the coldness crept back to his eyes. He slipped his hands into his pockets, his posture straightening ever so slightly. "Ten o'clock, I hope you haven't forgotten."
As he approached the back – or what he thought was the back – of the room, a large blue chest came into view. Draco felt a wave of relief flood his veins as he took in the sight of what could only be the twin Vanishing Cabinet. He'd been instructed to search for a specific inscription on the left side of the cabinet.
Harry, Ron and Hermione got up from the Gryffindor table and headed up to their dormitories. That night, Harry did not have a single nightmare. The only thoughts in his head were blissful, happy ones.
Malfoy accepted the handshake. Their gazes lingered on each other’s faces for a fraction of a moment. They hastily let go, and Harry left to go find the others. This encounter changed their perception of each other ever since. Because, how different were they really? Two flawed boys, both just looking for love and acceptance in this cruel world.
Harry demonstrated, with Malfoy closely watching and following. After many failed tries, Malfoy finally produced an acceptable protective spell. The look of delight on his face was contagious; Harry felt his own smile widen. Malfoy blushed furiously as he saw Harry smiling at him. A beat of silence.
about Malfoy. He didn’t show the same energy, he never seemed to hang around ‘friends’ anymore and his jabs at Harry, Ron and Hermione became increasingly infrequent. Perhaps he was just scared to say anything because he would be attacked for saying something negative about Harry,
However, every time he tried to make eye contact with her, she would casually look away, seemingly ignoring Harry’s existence. Harry was quite confused— after all, didn’t she want to be friends too?
“The wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry, “And quite honestly, I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.”
Harry made his way to the table, grabbing a piece of toast and sitting himself in the space between Ron and Hermione.
Harry stared at his letter for a few moments before turning around and lifting his eyes to meet Hermione’s. Ron finished reading a few seconds after Harry and all three of them looked at each other with uncertainty.
When Ron and Hermione asked how the session had gone, as they always did, Harry replied with: “Just the usual.”
“Okay sure. I can ask Professor McGonagall for an empty classroom during our free time,” Harry said.
Malfoy was a lot more 3 dimensional than Harry originally thought. Since that day, the two had become somewhat friendly, if not friends. Pain really does bring people together. However, Harry did feel like he was betraying Ron and Hermione and he felt awful about it. He wished the situation was different.
They stood there in comfortable silence, both gaining an ounce of new found respect for each other. Eventually, Harry extended a hand towards his (former) arch nemesis.
“So… did you tell Weasley and Granger?” Malfoy said, fairly nonchalantly, though he looked even more pale than usual (if that was possible). Harry knew what he was talking about right away.
“Your mother saved me, you know. We were in the Forbidden Forest and she was sent to check if I was dead. She lied. She lied to Voldemort’s face, saying that I was dead, just so she could get back to you.”
hating him. At first I thought it was just because you were noble and like helping people, not because you actually enjoyed teaching him,” Ron said.
Harry still felt awful about the whole thing, but really, there was nothing he could do. It was better than stringing her along.
Classes went by as usual and everything seemed to run smoothly. Harry was quite the celebrity; even the Slytherins treated him with a decent amount of respect. It was quite unnerving, but it was to be expected. There were still a few that looked as if they were biting back insults, but they were certainly the minority. Harry enjoyed most of his classes (though not the workload that was given), and even had a good Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, something he was extremely grateful for.
He thinks bitterly. He pushes open the door to the sitting room rubbing tiredly at his eyes. “Honestly Pansy, I appreciate the effort, but good Merlin, I didn’t realize how fucking boring muggle jobs are. Who knew handling money was every bit as boring as it sounds? Merlin, if I had known that dating was going to be this horrible, I would have just become a monk or something.” He spits sarcastically. He turns around and tosses off his waist coat on the chair sighing heavily. “I don’t know how deep you are into the wine, Pans, but pour me a glass, would you?”
He moves back to the manor after that, not wanting to inconvenience Pansy any longer, but acknowledging that he needs help. She does protest profusely.
Draco’s phone chimes and he welcomes the brief distraction. “Just a sec-,” He stalls as he pulls out his phone and tries to make the immediate text in front of him seem important. He nearly breaks his concentrated façade when he sees a picture of him standing beside Dean, clearly trying to be as tall as he can, despite being almost a full head smaller. He’s holding his arm out next to Dean’s.
In the haste of trying to get Scorpius ready and bundled up, he briefly forgets about the picture he so boldly sent Potter. It’s not until he’s walking to the park with one hand around Scorp’s that his phone chimes and he remembers. He slides it open and sees a text from Potter.
His name across the back is untidy and messy and it’s only his last name. He frowns. It couldn’t be, could it?
Harry looks up and watches Malfoy. He can see his profile, his platinum hair glowing off the sunlight, hair falling in his face… The woman in front of him says something and the blonde throws his head back and a melody of laughter hits Harry’s ears – and Merlin if it isn’t something so beautiful… “Yeah,” He answers wistfully. “Your mom
He feels Harry squeeze his hand. “Draco,” He murmurs. Their eyes lock and his throat seizes up, welling with so much emotion. Harry’s eyes are glowing in the twinkling light, reflecting beautifully off his glasses. “You – Scorpius – I-,” He looks ahead of them and flounders. “Shit!”
He runs a hand through his hair as he reads over the rest of Zabini’s report and sighs. There’s only one minor problem and that’s Zabini himself. Harry’s going to have to go to Blaise’s office with his side of the report and after learning of his… proclivities towards Malfoy…
It wasn’t until nine months later when the universe decided Draco Malfoy could use a quick slap in the face - when Astoria showed up on Pansy’s doorstep, a baby in her arm with pale skin and shocking blonde hair.
He sighs. “Darling, we have to get home and get you cleaned up first. You’re filthy! Then we’ll have dinner-,”
When he clicks on it, it downloads immediately and lights up his screen. It’s a selfie of a scowling Draco Malfoy, with his hair tied back in a knot, a deep blue jumper with a hood and strings, and a pair of casual light jeans ending in a pair of deep brown Merino wool trainers. “Jesus Christ…” He breathes.
Part of Potter’s resolve breaks and he surges forward. For a second, Draco’s positive that he’s going to kiss him, but then Harry is pulling the blonde, flush against his side and wrapping an arm around him. Draco’s head drops to Harry’s shoulder and he tenses up. Harry’s hand is running through Draco’s locks and the opposite one taking his hand in his and running his thumbs against his knuckles.
Potter grabs a small tea sandwich and gives Draco a thoughtful look. “You send Scorpius to a muggle school?”
him now.” And fuck, Draco’s stomach is filled with golden snitches that he’s pretty sure are trying to fly out of his mouth. “And I will do everything in my power to protect you guys.”
Harry stares and reads the phone number on the parchment. Draco Malfoy has a fucking cell phone. He immediately grabs his phone and shoots off a text message before heading off to the bar.
“I think he might adore you.” She leans her hip against the kitchen counter. “I mean he’s putting up with your father for Merlin’s sake.”
He shakes his head. “No, no.” He clears his throat and strides to the desk. “I’m actually looking for Blaise – ah Zabini.”
“Why are you so fucking cold?” He distantly hears his mother run to grab her wand. He uses his own wand to carefully remove the shards of glass from his hands. “Sorry, this might sting a bit.” When the glass is removed, he sanitizes the wounds and pulls bandages from his wand to wrap around his hand.
“Yes.” Lucius snaps his gaze to Harry. “I can’t – I can’t quite explain it. It’s happening so fast but I – I’m going to save him, Mr. Malfoy. You can bet your life on it.”
Hermione pulls away and adjusts his messy hair. “Oh Harry,” She sighs and she moves away, letting out a small groan as she sits back in her chair. “You shouldn’t be so oblivious. You and Malfoy have obviously had something between you all these years.”
“Harry…” She chides. “You’ve been so distant lately and you’ve missed the monthly Weasley dinner for like six months. What’s going on?”
Draco almost dies at breakfast and fights the confusing feeling of relief when Harry leaves around lunchtime and also a small pang of wishing he’d stay forever.
I won’t let anyone hurt your mom again.” His heart clenches at the thought of anyone hurting Malfoy and he holds his rival’s son harder. “I’ll protect you guys.”
The doctor waves his wand and the clipboard disappears. “Mr. Malfoy, a freezing curse placed on the heart is usually used for two reasons. One, and the most common is to freeze your own heart to find love. If someone’s affection for you is strong enough to warm your heart, the curse is broken. Two would be for someone to take their own life. They brew enough of the potion and continue drinking it until their heart freezes to a stop.” There’s a long silence and the doctor gives him a calculating look. “I’m afraid that because you’ve taken only a small amount, and your heart has not been warmed in five years – the potion is beginning to work at an accelerated rate.”
Oh he wants to play that game, does he? Draco cocks an eyebrow and sips his coffee, pulling it close to his chest. “A forgotten shirt from a
“Mom makes me wear this.” He shoves his arm closer to Harry. “It tells him when I get too far away or when I’m scared.” His eyes pool with tears. “Mr. Harry. It’s hot and it’s rumbling. He’s scared! I know ‘cause that’s what it did to my dad when grandpa’s peacock chased me. I tried to tell Miss Pansy but – but,” he lets out a choked sob. “She didn’t believe me. It’s so hot, Mr. Harry! He’s really scared!” He throws himself back in Harry’s arms and rubs his face in his chest, muffling his voice. “You promised you’d protect him, Mr. Harry. You promised you’d keep my mom safe.”
Malfoy drops his hands to his son’s shoulders. “Alright, Scorpius. Head inside. I’ll be right behind you.”
When he’s finally sitting at the stool, he’s tapping his index finger impatiently. It’s 4:28pm, they’re regular Taco Tuesday night at a wizard Cantina. Harry smiles at the laughing crowd, and the patrons on the dance floor. Merlin, he’s grateful that Diagon Alley has been so diverse recently. He’s here early, everyone else is there around five, but –
A hurt look crossed Blaise's face at that but Draco did not see it. He did however notice when Blaise raised his wand arm.
Then she shooed Draco away and he was relegated to the entrance of the Hospital Wing with nothing but questions.
Draco lay sprawled out on the sheets. His left arm lay atop Harry’s pillow and his right leg on a good portion of Harry’s side of the bed. This was the kind of spread-eagled position Harry expected he slept in when he was alone in bed.
With a jolt, he realised he was losing Malfoy. He jogged down the path and turned round the bend eyes darting around wildly. But the alley forked at that point and he could not see Malfoy in either one of them. Neither did he have any way of telling which way he'd gone. He was just about to turn around and count this as a loss when he heard someone speak from behind him.
Lysandra gave a hesitant smile and some sort of curtsy. Harry could only stare in bewilderment, he hadn’t seen anyone do this yet and was unsure how to proceed. When Lysandra straightened, the look on her face was expectant.
Harry tried to catch Draco alone the next day. Dumbledore's note still weighed on his mind but another part of him just wanted to check on Draco. No matter how accustomed his body was to whatever potions he drank, Harry knew there would still be pain, both physical and mental.
How long had it been since they’d taken him? He could feel the drowsiness pushing against him and he knew he wouldn’t be able to resist much longer.
It was the same clearing in which he’d seen Draco almost five months ago and looked unchanged except now only a few traces of grass remained.
Brief flashes of lucidity began to grow into seconds and then minutes. The pain began to ebb and he realised the shift was approaching its end. He could barely remember a thing.
“I don’t want this to drive a wedge between us,” he said choosing his words with care. “It’s just that sometimes I wonder if you… if I... would be here if it wasn’t for the bond.”
Aside from having to hide from his friends, the weekend was otherwise uneventful. Draco managed to brew another batch successfully and was pleased to discover he still had a few bottles of Firewhiskey left. Just enough to last until the next Hogsmeade weekend, if he was careful. And to top it all off, the asphodel root had been left untouched by Madam Pomfrey when he received his clothing from her.
It was certainly no secret that Malfoy was one of the most desired yet reviled people in the school. Harry had walked in on several such conversations enough times. This he’d surmised was partly because he didn't care what other people thought of him. The too long hair, constantly unbuttoned silk shirt and general non-compliance with school rules couldn’t be otherwise explained.
The car was larger on the inside than he expected. He didn’t know if that was due to his inexperience with cars or magical modification of items. He tossed his bags onto the seat opposite his and sunk low into the leather.
"What? I-" Harry turned to Ron then Hermione as he searched for something to say. "It seemed like a good idea at the time." He was still shocked that Ron had pinned the whole thing on him when they’d both agreed to it.
He wasn’t sure what to make of it but before he could properly consider it, Draco spotted something in McNair’s hands. A cup? He blinked and realised that it was full of… something. Some liquid sloshed over the sides as he hobbled over to where Draco sat.
Harry nodded and wrapped the scarf around his neck thankful for its familiar weight. The boy’s gaze flickered to his neck a second too late. The mark had faded to nothing more than a bruise now but he couldn’t very well wear it as it was. It looked more like a love bite than anything.
Narcissa surveyed the dishrag he wore over his wrinkled leathery skin. Lino was a little older than most house elves but it had not been easy to find a replacement for their last house elf and the Malfoy family had been in great need of help around the house. Narcissa could hardly be expected to cook and clean, could she?
The two boys raced up the steps to the Gryffindor common room to dump their books, change into their flying leathers and collect their brooms before they headed down to the Quidditch pitch. To their surprise the rest of the members of the team had already arrived and were listening to Ginny instruct them on what strategy they would use in the upcoming match.
Harry came to his senses at the use of Malfoy's first name and extricated his arm out of Malfoy's gasp.
Harry couldn’t see where he was looking on account of his dark glasses but he had a strong feeling this was the Bentley. He stepped forwards and waited to see if anyone would make any move to stop him.
"Gin? Ginny," Parvati was saying as she waved her hand in front of the ginger's face. "Are you even listening?"
Draco chuckled and leaned back a little, hands spread on the soft linen. He looked wonderful like that, Harry thought. Perched on the edge of the bed, socked feet barely grazing the floor, hair unbound. It stole the breath from his lungs and his thoughts flashed to the previous night.
He could either continue to lie until he fabricated something believable or he could spare himself the trouble and tell them the truth before hexes started flying. Rubbing his temples, he sat down on his bed beside Pansy with a weary sigh.
Malfoy remained ineffably calm during all this. But this was not his usual calm. It was though some potent ingredient had been added it. Harry saw it in the way Malfoy’s gaze caught his from across the Great Hall. The way it lingered and lapped up every bit of him it could settle on.
He listened to the sound of Ron padding around and a moment later the only sound in the room was that of Neville turning the pages of his book. Harry turned on his side and wished Ron would get over himself. He knew it was unlikely to happen and the thought stung but he still held it close.
They were only halfway to the seventh floor but Harry wondered if they should go to the Hospital Wing.
Harry nudged his shoulder when he didn’t say anymore but he was gone, claimed by sleep. Harry was forced to lie down beside him and hope whatever dream he had was one Draco couldn’t tease him about in the morning.
Harry laughed to hide the fact that he was glad they didn't have time. He wasn't sure he was comfortable with wearing any spell work on his face.
Harry shivered. Draco took a deep breath and then pulled back. His fingers danced down Harry’s forearm until they locked around Harry’s own.
“Armand was the heir presumptive when he was born. His father mucked about a lot, everyone knew that. But he had the sense to do it with purebloods, or so Abraxas said. Anyway, nobody liked that a bastard might inherit the family fortune, pureblood or no. You can imagine the jealousy they felt, repressed as they were. But it had to be done. Someone had to carry the legacy.
Quidditch practice had continued as normal despite his soured relationship with Ron who was the only one of the team members whose anger or surprise refused to be cured by hard practice. So Harry had treated him like he did every other team member. There had been no jesting, no strategy breaks and no light comments about Demelza’s backward swerves which were enough to know anyone to the ground in a heartbeat.
Just imagining how much gloating the Slytherins would subject him – and the rest of Hogwarts – to if he lost was motivation enough. The single thought was what made Harry vow to train even harder today evening because through some miracle he was choosing not to question, Ginny has managed to get them the pitch for practice.
Pansy had certainly brought enough liquor to inebriate the entire student body for three consecutive nights.
"You were found unconscious in the Forbidden Forest, having sustained heavy blood loss and various other injuries. Now, do care to explain exactly what you were doing in the Forbidden Forest during the start of term feast?" asked Severus his tone sharp.
He swallowed and turned to hide the tears, to hide the sting of being wrong in one of the only situations he’d ever needed to be right.
The team grumbled their assent and trundled off the pitch lead by Ginny who Harry promised himself to seek out and apologise to.
Draco didn't need the play-by-play. He could see them just fine on his own though his vision grew hazy every few seconds.They rushed past in a blur of dust and Draco had to shut his eyes – which had begun to water – until the sound of galloping became distant once more.
Draco would have heard that. And with no small amount of surprise, Harry realised Draco was waiting for it. He was going to let Harry do it, on his terms.
“Well, it’s nice to see we’re all having fun here,” Draco said materialising beside him with a huff of breath.
“Just shut up both of you,” Haneul said, shaking his head. “No wonder you’ve made no progress at all.”
Draco didn't say anything. The rest of the team were still a little shocked at Stone's decision to reinstate him as seeker. It had been inevitable, only Nott seemed to realise that. But Draco was looking to burn some energy and he was not in the mood to talk so he got on his broom.
He’d wanted to interject several times and almost had. But Draco had clamped a cool hand over his under the table. When Harry had turned his own hand up so their palms met, he’d felt the cool sweat on Draco’s hand. The skin contact had soothed him. Enough that he retained a level head all through Lucius’s presumptions of knowing the kind of man he was.
Draco spun round to meet the face of his godfather, wand pointed directly at them. His clothing was dusted and torn in different areas and his dark hair was streaked with dust where it wasn’t slick with sweat.
He still didn’t know what protections this house had and if it turned out that it had none, doing magic would only land them in a myriad of problems. Besides, Kreacher would only be too glad to have them gone as soon as possible.
Hermione didn’t look convinced but she fell into stride and they both made their way to the door just as it swung open to reveal McGonagall.
The dark-haired boy looked up in surprise. Draco thought the same expression must be mirrored on his face because he could not for the love of Merlin think what had made him do what he just did.
About half an hour later when the smell of Mrs Weasley’s cooking begun to waft from the kitchen, Dumbledore got to his feet. “I would like to speak to Mister Malfoy if it’s not too much trouble.”
"There was never any rule against that," said Harry tearing his gaze away from the side of Malfoy's face when the blond turned to look at him.
"I don't know how I'll be after," he said. "And I'm new to this. Things might not exactly go according to plan."
Harry didn’t wait long enough to hear what he needed to do. He raced up the remaining flights of stairs and forced open the washroom doors.
“No, Harry. Maybe if you woke up you would see the world as it really is. Why do you think Dumbledore left it to me to tell you this?”
So Hermione had noticed it too. Malfoy was not as vile or boastful as he had been in the past, almost like he'd matured over the summer.
“Which is what we’re supposed to speak to you about,” Armand said collapsing into the chaise lounge at the foot of the bed.
he still ached from their time in the sheets. The thought made him shudder and he nearly bumped into Draco before he realised he’d stopped moving.
Cygnus Black III did not wait for Draco to reach for his hand as Abraxas Malfoy had. He held it out with all the importance of a king demanding subjugation from his subjects. Harry half expected Draco to refuse. He wanted him to even though he knew he couldn’t. Draco took the wrinkled hand in his own and kissed the signet ring that sat on the man’s left little finger.
Ron narrowed his eyes at him and because he didn't want him thinking he was picking sides he said, "Remember what happened in first year?"
With a hand of the dial and an ear in the stories, outrageous stories soon become outlandish, watered down by too many re-tellings. Draco had been playing this game far longer than anyone at Hogwarts and it showed.
he thought. Draco doubted Snape had read about it all. His godfather appeared for all intents and purposes to have a traditional view on magical creatures. Draco would assume him a purist until any facts to the contrary arose.
Draco brushed back the strands of hair that hid his scar. Harry didn’t know when he’d removed their masks or where they were but he didn’t care.
Order business was hardly safe but he wondered how many times Lupin came back to Grimmauld Place like this – or worse. He knew he could take care of himself but sometimes you just needed… someone.
But he just sat in stunned silence like the rest of the Great Hall, watching as Malfoy fled the scene.
Harry sighed and threw the sheets off his body, or he tried to. Draco watched in exasperation as he made a second attempt to get up.
McNair grinned as he pressed down on his left shoulder. Draco swore as pain exploded in his body. Where had that come from? Had he gotten hurt without realising it. He was panting by the time Blaise eased McNair’s grip with a sharp kick.
Draco would probably have handled the situation better but he wasn’t Draco and their friends were very different. Ron and Hermione wouldn’t let him slip out of this so easily and he hated that most.
Before he could say anything, Harry placed his palm on his right side. His body was warm beneath the light t-shirt he had on.
His station had been in direct line of sight the common room door. The very place where Harry had been when Malfoy… did the deed.
He heard shuffling in the room and assumed that the rest were already up and preparing for the Hogsmeade trip. Squeals of excitement that made his head throb wafted from downstairs, no doubt a product of the third years' belief of everything they'd heard from older students. He hoped they would leave soon so that he would have the entire dormitory to himself, catch a few hours of sleep then laze around wondering whether he should get something to eat from the kitchens or continue to lay in bed the whole day.
Quidditch practice was a wet and soggy affair and if there was anyone who despised being wet and soggy, it was Draco Malfoy. But the rains had come a month early and nothing could be done about it. In the spirit of creating interhouse spirit, Dumbledore had apparently informed the school that he would be instituting friendlies in this year’s Quidditch matches.
“You know,” Draco starts, smirking, “I’ve already chosen the memory that would consistently conjure a patronus. I simply have to imagine you’ve finally unburdened me with your presence and fucked off to the middle of the ocean where you’re never to be seen again.”
He takes a reluctant step inside, sending her a hopefully convincing smile as he passes her when she beckons him in. He goes straight for the chair he sat in last time and waits as she walks to her kitchenette, putting the kettle on. He can’t help but wonder why she doesn’t heat it with magic, but wisely chooses not to mention it.
Draco can’t help but find that fact quite amusing. “Interesting, that’ll be useful information to know. Please tell me more, does he snore in his sleep as well? Any guilty pleasures?”
“If you’re insinuating that I talk like that, Potter, then you’re more ridiculous than I thought. That sounded nothing like my voice,” Draco scoffs.
“I honestly can't wait to get out of here. As soon as I complete my NEWTs I’m moving to France,” Theo says.
After sipping his coffee in bed for a few minutes, listening to Greg’s soft snores from his bed nearby, Draco makes his way to the bathroom to proceed with his morning routine consisting of skin care and combing his hair. If he’s going to be wearing this hideous accessory all day, then he’s going to at least make sure he looks presentable.
“YOU CAN’T WALK IN FRONT OF ME THINKING YOU’LL GET AWAY WITH IT, TREETOP! I’LL MAKE YOU WISH YOU WERE NEVER BORN!”
Suddenly a large stag erupts from Potter’s wand, the classroom completely engulfed by the bright blue light of the patronus. It prances elegantly around the room, and Draco can’t look away. He freezes as it starts to approach him, but before it can reach him the patronus dissolves into nothing, leaving Draco with an indescribable void in his chest. Draco scowls at the fading light, feeling inexplicably bitter, before moving his attention back to the front where Potter is standing. He startles when he meets Potter’s eyes, already locked onto his own. Potter looks away quickly, clenching his jaw tightly as he swallows. Draco’s eyes follow the movement of his Adam’s apple unknowingly, and upon the realization of his actions he curses silently.
At everyone’s nods and agreements, Mcgonagall picks up the hat from the table and small pieces of parchment beside it. “I need all of you to grab a quill, because you will each write your names on a piece of parchment and place it into the bag. Then, I’ll walk back around and ask you all to take a name. The person you choose will be your target, and you cannot switch targets with another person. The magic involved will not allow it,” She instructs. McGonagall approaches each student one by one, and they each grab a small piece of parchment from her, and Draco reaches into his bag for a quill.
“Well, you are risking your last remaining brain cell, Weasley, be careful, otherwise there will be none left for Potter to use,” Draco sneers, watching victoriously as Potter’s face turns indignant, “As for my hair, at least it’s in impeccable condition, unlike your bird’s nest, Potter. And Weaselby, your ginger hair clashes harshly with the four house colors. You look like a christmas tree gone wrong.”
“I dunno, I’ve been thinking. If Potter was able to take down the Dark Lord as a Half-blood, what if it doesn’t... matter?” Greg shifts around on his bed nervously.
Draco almost frowns, confused as to when Potter even left the table. He was just here eating a minute ago. How did he manage to do that so quickly and without notice?
Draco nods to her again in affirmation and follows her out into the hall, his feet hesitating as he steps out of the room. His mind whirls as he tries to imagine what she has for him since their world has shrunken down to this confinement for 147 days. By now, he has explored every room, some even more than once. It was the only way to keep his mind occupied, to give himself a purpose. The first 12 days he spent either underneath the comforter or in the dining room with his mother.
Pansy chats Draco’s ear off furiously about frivolous matters ranging from the new designer heels she just ordered to describing in disturbing detail why and how—if drunk enough—she wouldn’t mind having a one night stand with Flitwick; The latter of which startled Draco into alertness, and he suspects that perhaps it was her intent.
Draco sits on the floor beside her feet, placing his hand on her leg and looking up at her with a fond smile. “I’d love to.”
Before Weasley can respond, Draco continues, “Now, since I actually study and complete my own homework without leeching off my more intelligent best friend, I am moving to the library, far from you numskulls.”
They eventually reach the doors leading into his father’s study, the ones left unopened since their arrival 147 days prior. Draco does not include this as a room in the Manor under his mental categorizations. This space holds only a moment in time, which Draco, despite his minor inclinations into insanity, refused to relive as he began his venture through the building on the 12th day. Looking past the crack of the doorway is enough to resurrect the sound of his own screams, as if they’re being pulled out of his body even in that moment. He freezes, unable to pass through, all his muscles tensing. His mother turns to him with a look of understanding, and continues into the room.
Hi, I’m back! It’s been a while, but I’ve still been spending a lot of time on this, and there’s a much more content that will be posted soon! A huge thank you to my beta
“Oh yes it was your choice!” Ginny insists. “You could've let Lockhart handle it, as the famous dueller and hero. Everyone would have been so jealous of me if that were the case. Imagine being saved by
Draco’s bravado falters slightly at the dig, but he maintains his composure. “Ah, so you’re here to take over. Well, not everything has your name on it, so how about you run back to your pet Gryffindors and leave me alone. I am coaching just fine.”
His eyes follow the curved lines of stems expanding and weaving across the expanse of the wall. In this moment, the pervasive wallpaper, flowers growing upon flowers, appears to have more freedom than Draco ever did—unbeknownst to him until the moment he reentered his old home, realizing it felt no more suffocating than before.
Draco blinks, unsure of how to respond to that. He simply nods, which seems to satisfy her, because she walks off without another word. Once Coach Sylvester is out of sight, Draco turns to Pansy who is trembling slightly, eyes glued to the floor in shock.
Draco returns downstairs, and finishes the game with Greg without making a single glance towards Potter’s table. Well, only once, but that was a complete accident.
“Yeah, he was being a pain in my ass, trying to tell me how to run my own Club. He can go eat a dirty sock. Sore losers don’t get anything,” she says, walking over with the tea cups, handing one over to Draco.
“I was able to stalk you without you noticing wasn’t I?” Potter says, his eyebrow raised with a challenging look.
Blaise is already standing in front of the mirror when he walks in. He’s fresh out of the shower, only a bath towel shielding his modesty. Draco doesn't even blink as he walks in, rolling his eyes as Blaise sends him a charming grin.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “Yes, but personally I think it’s unwise of them to offer him a job without proving he has the official qualifications. It’s not fair, firstly, and he’ll be behind all the other Aurors who have been properly educated. I know defeating Voldemort sounds impressive, but I don’t think that alone means he’ll be a competent Auror. There are rules and skills involved that he definitely didn’t know during the war.”
"Then for Merlin's sake, Potter, be clear," he said and although Malfoy had not moved an inch it suddenly felt like he was miles away from Harry in that moment.
The look on his face was vicious and Draco delivered blow after blow to his face until his knuckled were bloody and a blow to his back sent him sprawling to the ground. Crabbe moaned but Draco was already rolling off him.
Draco waited until they were out of sight before he got to his feet. The wind left his lungs in a silent
Harry looked up from the water he’d been swishing onto his back. He'd been in the tub long enough to drain some of it and add more to keep it hot.
Blaise frowned then shook his head abruptly. "Never mind, I'll just have to borrow your notes for Binns' class later."
They spent the rest of the day cleaning the parlour on the first floor. Scraping away all the dirt that had accumulated on the walls was difficult work and Harry broke more than one artefact in the process but he was pleased with results in the end. Everything except the tapestry gleamed and a few paces away Draco repositioned the last of the furniture.
They had to walk past the parlour as they made their way to the dining room. Harry saw faces turn in their direction through the ajar doors. His and Draco’s fingers brushed, pinkies almost entwined.
Kreacher’s eyes gleamed from an alcove a few paces away. There was an almost predatory quality to his gaze that sent shivers down Harry’s spine. He sniffed and turned away. He had no time deal with Kreacher now but maybe if he sat at the window long enough…
He shouldn't be thinking about this. Then again, he shouldn't have survived a killing curse either and he shouldn't have to battle the deadliest wizard to ever live so he supposed he should only expect his life to get more bizarre from this point on.
All eyes turned to the door where Dumbledore stood in midnight blue robes and a shocked expression on his face. Nothing else about him was out of place, his hair was combed back and even his gnarled hand looked the healthiest it had in a while.
Harry run through what Malfoy had said. Something about a masque and meeting the family and other things he couldn’t care less about.
“Because they only take their coffee there. Conversation precedes the meal or some other etiquette shite. They'll be in the dining room soon enough.”
He nodded, the hints of a grin still on his face. "Lots and lots of it." What would she care anyway? Who would she tell? Who would believe her? To the rest of the world Draco Malfoy was the prince of Slytherin, affluent, good-looking and lusted after for the first two. It was an image he had worked hard to build, one that would save him – had already saved him – during hard times.
The breeze ruffled his hair as moved to the far end of the pitch, keeping his broom low. Despite their disagreement, he watched Ron with key eyes noting that his left-hand parry was weaker than his right. He also tended to guard the right side of the hoop more.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut and his mind went back to that afternoon. He could see the look on Draco’s face when he called him by his first name for the first time. Surprise had never looked so good on someone else.
A fact he had preened over and then resented Potter for once the accusations diverted his way. It became another thing on a long list of things Potter had taken from him.
But he hadn’t lived as Draco had. He hadn’t grown up accustomed to wealth and power. He hadn’t been taught the same things Draco had in his youth. It was only natural that his mind would rebel against the very thought of selling out.
Harry heaved a sigh and forced the thoughts aside. He pulled out the last letter Draco had sent him from his pocket and by the light of the setting sun, read it.
Memories were what kept people going but nothing would ever compare to the warmth of Draco’s skin and the parchment and ink scent that clung to him wherever he went.
Harry gave a hoarse laugh and sucked at his lip. Draco realised he still hovered far to close to him for their own good.
One wrong move set usually set the whole world against Harry but if Draco came from this unscathed he would be in awe.
"You tell him, Hermione," Ron was muttering under his breath seeming to have forgotten that they were not speaking and she couldn’t hear him from where she sat.
. None of it mattered to him because it kept them away, kept them afraid. All except Blaise, who knew just what he was. Draco would have wondered why he kept it to himself any other time. He would have wondered why Blaise didn’t partake in the name-calling but they pushed him down the last few steps into the dungeon and instead, he wondered how he would get out of here alive and dreamt of all the ways he would make each one of them pay.
Harry balanced it on his bare thighs and looked at it for a moment. Draco felt exposed from where he lay half reclined and observing. Harry's fingers rose from the bed and traced a line from his wrist to his elbow. The motion was light and felt more like a tickle on the older scars and Draco ignored the voice telling him to pull his hand away.
And even now he didn’t know exactly what he felt for Blaise. He wanted to hit him, to ruin and destroy him but at the same time, he just wanted it to end. He wanted answers, he wanted to forget all about this and move on with his life. He didn’t want to face the emotions closing in on him, didn’t want to face the rising need in him for something to dull his pain or his mind.
“Tell me,” he said quietly, “the name of that spell you used on my head the day we were on the quidditch pitch.”
He wore a pair of denim trousers, a grey shirt with the first three buttons undone and a pair of sneakers.
There was another curse and the footsteps disappeared out of the toilet. A slow smile spread across Draco's face. He'd always known Blaise would give up one day. That it would become too much. But why did it suddenly hurt to be right? He lifted his right hand to make another gash when suddenly the door flew open and he fell backwards onto Blaise's leg.
Draco’s body began to tremble and Harry half thought something was wrong but this time all that followed was a single loud crack. Draco cried out, spine arching and reforming. His legs – the wolf’s legs – bowed and he hunched forwards.
Harry had been afraid people would see them making out, the carriage doors weren’t opaque after all. It rarely mattered that there were hardly any people moving about, there was always someone around to see when it came to him and Draco.
She sighed and perched on the arm of the chair. "Please," she whispered. "Even if it's after, the party ends at four so there'll be plenty of time."
“Edward always comes in halfway through the evening meal,” he said now. They were almost at the bottom of the stairs and Harry could already smell the food. “I don’t know he gets his timings right. My parents tried moving the time around, it didn't work. He has an informer. Lino, I suspect.”
A line had been crossed but Harry could not tell what it was and he was far too angry with Malfoy to stop. He had endured years of humiliation and insults, so many times he had wanted to hurt Malfoy back, to make him feel what it felt like...
version of brewing is preferred because it has fewer side effects," she said in a rush looking flustered.
He heard Draco swear thought gritted teeth and a scuffle to his right distracted him. Zabini had somehow wiggled free of his bods and was crawling towards Draco. Harry started towards him but before he’d covered half the distance a large crack filled the air. He saw Zabini’s eyes widen first before he turned to see the splintering Cabinet.
There was a moment of silence in which Harry couldn’t comprehend the words. He opened his mouth to say something but there were no words. He tried again but even his legs felt weak and only the counter behind him kept him upright.
Harry reached for a raisin and when his fingers brushed against Draco’s, there was no smirk in his gaze.
Harry clenched his fists. All he wanted to do was make it to the bloody Quidditch pitch undisturbed, was that too much to ask?
He met his gaze and in that single, drawn-out moment, the silence nearly pierced Draco’s facade of calm. His fingers trembled around his wand as he considered whether he could do this and how far he would go if Nott struck out.
He had known the second Malfoy walked into the Slytherin common room. Tonight had been the shift. He couldn’t explain how he knew it. The same way he knew all this had something to do with the shift. Malfoy had never acted like this about him. And he had never done anything to suggest that he wanted to do something more about this bond.
Harry shifted again. This time because Draco swung a leg over and moved from his laps to the cool leather. It surprised Harry to find he’d become accustomed to the weight of Draco above him. Even though he liked to see him beneath him. He couldn't get the image of Draco coming undone out of his mind.
The words sounded as final here on the quidditch pitch as they had in Draco's room almost three weeks ago.
But Draco was also a good flyer and there was something about the way Potter looked at him on the field. The way he flew against him…
He heard Nott’s hesitation in the rhythm of his heart and seconds later footsteps approached the stall door.
Malfoy's face changed at that. "You think you can fix it? Why, because you're the Chosen One? Because it's your job to
"Yeah. Stuff about his past and all." It didn't seem like it would be all that useful but Harry was willing to learn anything he could about Voldemort.
. Draco hoped so but this wasn’t the time to show uncertainty. They would deal with whatever came when it did.
Harry smiled and repeated the hand motion. He pressed down with his palm and massaged for a moment. Then his fingertips pressed his fingers into his skin and flicked his wrist, once, twice. Draco exhaled and twisted his body again. Harry groaned when he brushed against his crotch.
Harry stopped a foot away from him. Rays of light bounced off his skin intensifying its honey colour and his green eyes glowed like freshly mown grass. The sight took Draco’s breath away and for a moment all he could do was stare.
“I’m not going to say anything to anyone, okay?” he said looking up. “But not for the reason you think.”
But he was still embarrassed about what happened the last time they met and he had resolutely been avoiding Malfoy's gaze the entire week because he couldn't get it out of his head how Malfoy had stepped back when he realised what Harry had been about to do.
More afraid of being trampled by a herd of centaurs than one centaur discovering his secret, Draco motioned for him to come into the clearing.
"Of course you have to take every bloody moment to lord it over us how intelligent you are," said Ron now brandishing his fork in the air. "I grew up with magic remember?"
Draco only followed. Harry so rarely tried to get away from him that when he did, he couldn't bear to ignore the instinct to chase.
He drew his wand back to shut the doors but Draco was faster. Severus flew back in the air and crashed into a pillar. He sank to the ground with a groan but was on his feet a moment later.
Malfoy pushed Zabini away and stepped up to Harry. With no preamble whatsoever, he pressed his lips onto his in a searing kiss. Harry stood frozen in shock and before he could think to do anything Malfoy had pulled away.
Severus and Dumbledore were audible from the dining room even though he knew Harry wouldn’t be able to make out their words. Despite what Harry believed, Draco suspected the two weren’t here on a house call.
It was easier to adjust to dark than it was to light because werewolves were night creatures but Blaise shining light in his eyes was cruel, almost expectedly so. Was he so paranoid as to believe Draco would attack him with a dislocated shoulder, bruised ribs, and a sprained wrist?
Harry felt the desire thrum in his body just as it did in his own but he knew what happened in the barn would only happen again. Merlin, Draco’s shift had to be soon, Harry already recognised the signs.
"You only want to drink from this," he explained tapping the tank with its bubbling blue liquid. "Everything else is probably spritzed."
Harry’s eyes moved to Neville’s bed ready to find him snoring. Harry couldn’t hide his surprise at the fact that he was wide awake. In fact, he had a book on fungi propped on his laps. Harry couldn’t make out any more of the title from the low light in the room.
Draco snorts. “Nope. I will take one of your beers though.” He throws himself into the couch sighing heavily. Harry hands him one and they sit in amicable silence while a slightly creepy Claymation movie takes place. He takes a swig and feels his stress melt and a warmth settling in his gut. “How was Scorpius tonight?” He smiles into his lap. “I bet he was absolutely thrilled to see you.”
Dean and Seamus share a look before the Irishman takes a deep breath. “We’re together. Like together together. Boyfriends. Dating. Um. Gay. We’re gay boyfriends.”
“I wanna talk to him! I wanna talk to him!” Draco scoops up Scorpius and places him on his hip continuing to walk down the park and towards the nearest floo.
“Draco!” His mother surges forward and he drops the shards of glass to the floor. He’s gasping for breath, that feeling of drowning in freezing cold water again…
Draco genuinely loves his job as a mail order potion apothecary, but he finds himself a little stir crazy. He’d love to have a job as an actual Potions Master at Hogwarts, or even just a potions expert at the ministry or in Diagon Alley, but-
And it’s only when Draco is nearly finished with his burger, that Harry ruins their pleasant evening.
“Or something.” She mutters. “What do you want? Other than taking my darling best friend Draco Malfoy from behind-,”
Harry sighs. “Scorpius,” And fuck, he hates to admit this. “He might just be having a good time, kiddo.”
Ron frowns. “I’m not letting this slide, we’re gonna circle back to this.” He nods behind him. “I was trying to get your attention cause Seamus and Dean say they need to tell us something.”
He showed up on Pansy Parkinson’s doorstep, a single duffle bag in his hand and without missing a beat, she invited him in. Slowly his friends filtered back into his life and Pansy helped him piece himself back together. It was three months into living with Pansy that he saw Astoria Greengrass. She was beautiful – long legs, dark hair, tanned skin. She looked immaculate sitting with a delicate drink in her hand on Pansy’s couch.
Harry sighs heavily as he slumps in the chair across from Hermione’s desk. He tilts his head back and his eyes flutter closed. “Merlin, do I love half day at the Ministry.”
There’s a deep, rough sleep-worn laugh. “Because your mom likes them in his waffles.” There’s some movement. “Can you hold my wand, and move it in a circle to stir the batter, Scorp?”
There’s a long silence and he can hear Scorpius moving about his room, more than likely making his bed. “Why can’t you tell me the truth?”
Draco scrambles off Harry and helps the man to his feet. “Nothing, I just fell.” They dust themselves off. “Um – shall we go?”
Lucius’ voice calls out as he returns from the kitchen, a tray of sandwiches in hand. “That would be my doing.” He sets the tray down and sits down gracefully in a black leather chair. “Scorp was getting bullied at that muggle Kindergarten for not having a mom, so I simply provided him a solution.”
Ron shrugs. “With the look he was giving you through the celly, mate… I think it’s safe to say that he definitely doesn’t hate you too.”
Teddy is standing beside them, a look of worry on his face. “Miss Cissy said she’ll be right in. um – can I – can I help?” He eyes Draco’s wound warily.
Harry’s checks his reflection several times. He’s kept his look casual – Hermione always reminds him that it suits him best. He’s wearing a black Hogwarts Alumni shirt with a small crest sitting over his heart and the back reads Gryffindor in maroon. He’s layered it with a navy and gray checkered flannel and a zip up hoodie thrown over that. He’s got on light denim jeans with a few sporadic holes in them, finishing off his look with a pair of navy slip on Vans. He tosses back his hair – it might be time to get a haircut – and adjust his square rimmed glasses. He’s been wearing the pair for the past few years, but he can’t help but miss the round frames… just slightly.
He shakes his head. “It’s nothing, Hermione – I’m just – looking for a change I guess is all. I’m just tired.” He amends. He slides his chair back and rises to his feet. “I really should get going anyway.”
A lull of quiet passes between the two of them and Potter gives him a small smile. “It seems like you’re doing well.”
She concedes. “Fair point. Lucius is quite the snob. Wand some outfits then. Let me see them.” He goes through a few before she finally settles on a charcoal gray Henley that accents his physique and a pair of black fitted jeans. She has him find his best and cleanest pair of trainers, that have just a pop of red in them. “What about your hair, Potter? As a stylist – I have to be honest, it drives me absolutely mad. Run a brush through it or something.”
At first, despite not protesting against it, Hermione found this new policy to be a bit insensitive, as she knows it’s important to work through your emotions in order to move on from them. But eventually, after too many late nights of crying and arguing over those who had died and what they should have done differently, she realized Ginny had been right; their discussions weren’t helpful, they merely reopened fresh wounds, pouring salt on them the longer the conversation went on.
Draco’s inner mantra is broken as Ravenclaw Patil barrels past him, moving so fast she knocks a book off Granger’s table, slamming to the floor with a loud
. Draco stumbles backwards, catching his balance, and then he peeks out and sees that Finnigan is close behind, chasing Patil down with his water gun out in front of him. The ringing from the bell on his hat announces his presence as the two weave through the tables with Padma attempting to outrun Finnigan.
“Well, you’re no fun. And don’t try to tell me the sound isn’t scary. How is this a game meant for children?”
“Ah yes, I know. My hair is looking extra voluminous today. I spent more time combing it in honor of the weekend. Now, carry on, nothing else to see here,” Draco says, embodying his haughty, Pureblood persona.
“Don’t know, mate. I think he was just born that way. I bet when he came out of his mum, he sneered at the healer who delivered him,” Ron jeers.
“As you should be, I don’t spend 40 minutes getting ready in the morning for nothing,” Blaise grins, sliding his hands carefully over his hair.
She walks right up to Longbottom, his eyes widening slightly, looking more frightened by her than by the Dark Lord in the flesh. “You hear me Bucky Beaver? Because no one is gonna go easy on you just because you look helpless.”
“Now that we’ve reviewed the material from the previous school year, we’re going to start practicing the Patronus charm,” He announces. “I am aware that this is not normally taught at NEWT level, however I believe it to be an imperative skill for each of you to know. By the end of this term, if not, the end of the year, all of you will be able to successfully cast one.”
McGonagall sends him a glare that in all the years he’s been at this school, has never failed to frighten him into obedience. Without hesitation, Draco immediately fixes his features into a neutral expression and faces her attentively.
Draco only barely keeps his jaw from dropping onto the table from that information. That potion is almost impossible to acquire as there are only a few competent Potions masters in Wizarding Britain, and it’s extremely difficult to brew; the slightest deviation from the instructions will ruin it completely. This is a bit of a stretch even for him.
Draco awakes to the aroma of coffee, which he discovers to be coming from a steaming cup on his nightstand. He notices a note placed next to it and reaches for it.
“Now, this year our goal is to promote inter-house unity in order to create a more positive and inclusive environment for the students at Hogwarts. Over the years, we have failed to recognize the vast division between the different houses, and I am here to reestablish friendly competition among all the students. As the oldest at the school, you are all expected to participate in this campaign, both in and out of the classroom. If, for example, you’re a Ravenclaw and see that a younger Slytherin classmate has dropped all their books, I expect you to lend them your help.”
Draco promptly starts on his toast, shoving the thought of Potter out of his mind. He takes his Transfiguration book out to distract himself, because there’s no such thing as studying too much.
Harry looks down at his plate, pushing the food around with his fork distractedly. “I was just interested in seeing how Coach Sylvester was going to run the club, that’s all. I’m glad she’s doing it though, it’ll give the Muggleborns a chance to practice before having to try out.”
“Stop complaining, Ronald! This game will be good for all of us to bond! I don’t think Millie will be that bad.”
“In front of everyone. In the Great Hall. On top of the eighth year table,” Potter adds with a vicious smirk.
“So, Malfoy, I just got Anthony out,” Potter says, that obnoxious grin spread across his face, making his eyes glow. Draco has to force himself to look away before anyone notices him staring. “I caught him right outside the Great Hall.”
At some point during the party, Draco had placed himself on Theo’s lap, attempting to make out with him. Theo, being the gentleman he is, gently pushed him away, saying “Trust me, I’d love to, but not while you’re in this state. It wouldn’t be right.”
“And may I ask, who ended up being right about that?” Harry challenges, regretting the words as they left his mouth.
Today’s package includes a Lonicera periclymenum, which has always been Draco’s favorite. As a child, he would pick these from the garden and suck the sweet nectar out of them when his parents weren’t looking. Pansy taught him this, of course. He would never think to play in dirt on his own.
Draco flashes her a disgruntled look. “Yes, it’s going about as good as a Giant trying to break into Gringotts.”
“I get he killed the Dark Lord, who seemed alright, but that was a while ago. Why do people still talk about him? They always stare at him and try to do things for him. But it’s not like Potter wanted to kill him, right?”
“Do you have a moment?” Her soft tone reverberating through the unmoving room, calmness laced through her words.
Hermione snickers into her hand, muffling the sound to avoid getting reprimanded by Madam Pince. Draco smiles, feeling accomplished he made Hermione laugh.
“Fine,” she says with a loud sigh. “Well… he’s been needing help conjuring a patronus, and after I told him you taught all the members of the DA how to cast one, he said that would be his favor. I say that’s a much better prize than yours.”
Potter chuckles, his laugh warm, and does as Draco says. Once Draco’s feet meet the floor, he immediately straightens himself and steps away from Potter.
As he anticipated, her face tightens into a vicious look and her cheeks turn a dark red. “I’ve told you to
Draco scoffs, looking out the nearby window for a distraction. He can’t stand Hermione’s earnest gaze. “Potter doesn’t believe that.”
“Welcome Draco, take a seat in any of my lovely furniture. Tea? I know how much you Brits like that,” she offers, heading into her kitchenette.
Blaise ignores him as he continues, “A few minutes ago, Finnigan eliminated Fletchley from the game.”
Draco looks up, scowling at her as she tucks the book into her bag. “Pansy, class is not for reviewing the previous course material, it involves learning something new, which then adds to my revision pile. Do not derail me.”
The thought makes him want to laugh; never in a million years did Draco ever imagine he would seek to defy everything that his family and the generations of his ancestors stood for. However, he cares more about keeping his family intact than allowing a megalomaniac to seize reign over the world.
Draco looks at her, completely lost at her meaning. “Hermione, I understood none of what you just said.”
“Mr. Potter, I have heard from many others about your proclivity for this particular charm, would you mind coming up here to demonstrate for the class?”
Theo breaks his gaze away, resuming his nonchalant demeanor, “Not necessarily upset, but a bit bitter, yes. I don't think she realized she wasn't wearing the hat until after I shot her.” He shrugs.
“Nice try Pans, now get off Greg. He did nothing to deserve such a brutal attack. So, how about you apologize while I go grab some parchment and a quill. Then we can start planning Smith’s demise,” Draco offers.
Draco blinks at her, still struggling to wrap his head around this information. “Allow me to clarify. You’re telling me that Leader of the Dunderheads Potter, who can’t even bother to somewhat fix his hair, somehow got a hold of a decent batch of Felix Felicis? Melin, save us all. If you try to convince me he brewed it himself, I’ll think you’ve gone absolutely mad and I’ll have to stage an intervention.”
For now, Draco thinks a bath in the prefect's bathroom will be sufficient respite. Thanks to Blaise, he knows the password despite no longer being a prefect. As much as Blaise drives him crazy, he’ll admit his connections have been quite useful to Draco.
Draco could easily fall for Theo if he allowed himself to, because honestly, who wouldn't? Theo is wealthy and bright, with a witty and charming personality. He’s tall, with broad shoulders and soft, sandy hair with curls that fall over his forehead. Theo is everything a person could want in a boyfriend. His smile fills Draco with butterflies, swarming through his entire stomach. His touch sends shivers down his spine. And his voice is like warm honey sliding down Draco’s throat.
Finally, without moving his eyes away from Draco’s, Potter frees his wrist. His stare is boring into him, searching. For what, Draco couldn’t guess.
“Good. So, here are your weapons and your—you call these hats Minerva?—hats. And if I see any of you sissies wearing those godawful things and cause my eyes to bleed, I won’t hesitate to make fun of you. I might even throw pumpkin juice in your face. Who knows. Depends on if one of my first years falls off their broom that day,” She says, walking back to grab her bags in front of the fireplace.
He shrugs. “I like it. I also like that he calls you mom. It’s sort of cute.” Draco looks down to hide his blush. “Anyway, you need any help?”
Two wizards come at him, wands raised – eyes blazing and Draco is so shocked, he does nothing to stop them. His last thought is that he deserves this… but Scorpius doesn’t.
Draco sits back and furrows his brow. “Of course.” Scorpius casts a furtive glance at Harry before jumping off the couch and out the side door.
Malfoy flushes and turns away. “I just – I just mean you helped me back today, that can’t be easy.” He clears his throat. “Yes, well – about that. Thank you… for earlier.” He runs a hand through his blonde locks and Harry tracks the movement – remembering how the strands felt on his fingertips as he held back Malfoy’s hair.
Harry looks slightly surprised before flashing him a confident smile. “Well, now is as good a time as any to learn. Come on, lace up!”
“Of course.” Malfoy flashes him a quick smile before turning back to Scorpius. “Go with grandma and grandpa, darling. It’ll only take a second.” Scorpius looks hesitant and he gives him a little tap on the nose. “Go on.”
The door swings open and a plump nurse, vaguely reminding him of Mrs. Weasley, enters the room. “Oh hello dear! You’re awake. Let me grab the doctor.” As she leaves, Scorpius ducks from around the nurse, Lucius trailing behind him.
Teddy smirks. “Didn’t I tell ya, Scorp? Pretty wicked, right? Have you ever been ice skating before?”
“Yes sir!” He says dutifully. There’s some more movement which must be Harry searching for something through his cupboards before Socrpius speaks again. “Mr. Harry?”
Harry smiles gently. “Had some emergency with Goyle.” He shrugs. “If I’m honest, I was afraid to ask, plus – I’m happy to hang out with Scorp.”
Draco snaps his gaze forward and oh for fuck’s sake, they’re gonna hit the back wall. Draco closes his eyes tightly and suddenly he’s wrapped in Harry’s arms and spun around colliding with Harry’s chest as the Gryffindor’s back thuds against the wall and he lets out a sharp grunt. Draco looks up and Harry winces slightly. “Oh dammit, Potter are you okay?” The blonde starts to pull away and slips causing Harry to pull him close again.
Pansy’s face appears, hair disheveled, eyelashes askew and eye makeup smeared across her cheek. “What the fuck could you possibly want at 8AM on a Sunday morning Potter!”
Draco swallows nervously and Harry presses his shoulder against him comfortingly. “Thank you, Aunt Andromeda.”
Draco bites his lip to keep from smiling. Pansy clears her throat, and he clutches the parchment in his hand, jumping at the sound. Pansy sets the tray down and gives him a knowing smirk. “And who, pray tell, is that letter from. I
Draco passes his fingers through Scorp’s hair. “I kind of have to be with him in my life, you know?”
The food comes trough the floo ten minutes later, and really Draco is extremely impressed about the simple muggle concepts that Hermoine has managed to bring to the wizarding world, and he figures he’ll show his support by tearing ungracefully into this burger. Harry lets out a laugh, mouth full of food. “Fuck, someone was hungry.”
“Merlin, I looked like a bloody moron.” He bemoans and rolls his eyes. “Must all the Malfoys play stupid mind games.”
Harry lets out a small growl before pressing against Draco, hands flying off the counter and clutching the hem of his shirt at his back. Their noses brush and Draco holds his breath. “I can fix it.”
Theo takes a generous sip of his coffee. “Do you think he still refuses to date anyone but purebloods?”
There’s a long tense silence and Blaise shifts uncomfortably across from him. “Dray, it’s different now.” He murmurs. “I realize how stupid I’ve been-,”
He huffs, too nervous to be embarrassed. “I don’t know what to wear to a Malfoy brunch.” He waves a hand in front of the camera, briefly concerned it froze.
Draco gives the young which behind the counter a light smile. “Thank you… and-,” He taps his index finger on the reception desk twice before continuing. “Do you happen to know the curse breaker I’ll be seeing?”
Knocking back a few more drinks, laughing with his friends, bumping into Astoria in the hallway, pressing her against the wall – warm hands on him… it felt
Merlin, why does he care what Malfoy thinks…? He groans and swipes his hands across his face, patting his cheeks a few times. “Okay, okay. We can do this. Let’s go.” He checks all his pockets – wand, wallet, keys, muggle money, wizard money… okay.
“Aye, Blaise.” A stocky tanned wizard leans against the doorframe, his arms bursting against his suitcoat. “I got that report you were looking for.” He waves it in the air and nods at Harry before placing it on the desk.
Draco thinks this might be the cutest fucking thing he’s ever seen. Harry ruffles his hair and sets him on the floor so he can stick a chubby hand out to Andromeda. “Hello. My name is Scorpius. It’s nice to meet you ma’am.”
She blinks a few times and lets out a loud laugh. “Are you bloody kidding me? You’re concerned about what to wear to the Malfoys?”
She frowns. “It’s good to see you too Draco, but – tell my why Blaise was pitching a fit in my living room on Saturday night.” She huffs impatiently. “Scoot back, I’m coming through.” He sighs and throws himself in an arm chair casting a wordless warming charm. Pansy appears a moment later in an immaculate cream turtle neck dress stopping just above her knees. She’s got high boots on over a pair of patterned tights. She throws herself in the chair beside him and tucks back a chunk of her short black hair. “So spill, Draco honey. What happened?”
“Draco. I’m going to find out either way. I’m head of the Curse Breaker office. They send me a report of all cases. I’m the only one who can determine the severity. You might as well tell me yourself.”
He frowns as he stirs the concoction in front of him. He’s already made the mistake of trying to live a normal life walking through Diagon Alley, only to get his arse beaten within an inch of his life. Thank Merlin he didn’t’ have Scorpius with him.
Draco frowns. “I missed him too.” He feels a twinge of guilt about leaving Scorpius for the evening and selfishly trying to find love. His frown deepens, well if he’s honest he’s technically
But an hour later when they’re curled up on a couch by a warm fire place in the coffee shop next door, Draco can’t bring himself to care. It’s near Scorp’s bed time and he’s curled in Harry’s lap, head resting on  his chest, his eyes drooping slightly and Teddy has taken splendidly to Draco, sitting beside him, resting his head on his shoulder discussing potions - and fuck does it twist in a wonderful way in the pit of Draco’s stomach.
The blonde eases back on his bench and watches Teddy guide his son out on the ice. Scorpius fumbles for a second and places one hand against the wall and the other has a death grip in one of Teddy’s hands. Harry sits down beside him and holds out a pair of sleek black ice skates. “So? What do you say?”
” He sees a look of shock cross Potter’s face but doesn’t have time to elaborate any further before the side door opens and a small blur comes rushing towards him.
“I – uh –,” He sees Harry’s confidence slip for a second and he finds himself answering with an abrupt, “Yes.”
Harry swallows thickly. “Right. I’m – uh, I’m sorry, that sucks.” He readjusts the items in his hand and tucks them to his side. “About what happened earlier in Diagon…?”
“Ah…” Harry smirks and stares at the empty bottle. “Back to Potter, are we?” He mumbles. He shakes his head and turns his gaze, fully to Draco. “It’s alright. You don’t have to tell me right now.” He smiles, and Draco is briefly blindsided by it. “But you will eventually. I know it.” Draco opens his mouth to speak and Harry just shakes his head, still smiling. “Right now, let’s forget about it. I know it’s bothering you – trust me I know what it looks like when someone feels helpless, like the weight of the world sits heavy on your shoulders – so for right now – whatever it is, Draco…” His voice drops to a whisper and he reaches out tugging Draco closer to him. “-right now, forget about it. And let me comfort you.”
Sunday afternoon, Harry’s dusting himself off outside of Andromeda’s fireplace. “Andy!” He calls. “Andy! I’m here!”
“Hey Scorpius,” He looks up at Harry with watery eyes. “I’d love to go to the bookstore with you guys.” He glances at his watch. “I really should be going. Can you owl me the details, Malfoy?”
Harry kneels, eye level with Scorpius and pulls him into his chest, running a hand over his hair. “Shh, shhh, Scorp, calm down, darling.” He coos. “Take a deep breath for me.” He feels the small child’s shuddering breath and he rubs his back soothingly before pulling away and looking Scorpius in the eye. “Tell me what’s going on.”
– you look nice.” He glances at Draco before flicking his eyes back to the screen. “How was your date?”
“Do you even know-,” Potter gives him a pointed look and he snaps his mouth shut. “Oh, right. Of course.” He murmurs. “Look, I don’t-,” He glances at his watch knowing it’s close to 1:30 and he’s already later than he’s promised Scorp. He pushes at his magic and it feebly responds. He meets Potter’s eyes. “Thank you.”
– he’s in the kitchen in the manor cooking Scorpius breakfast when his vision blacks and he faints, body hitting the floor. He distantly hears Scorpius call his name, his mother scream and he feels… numb.
His face screws up and he hunches forward, crumpling in Harry’s embrace because what the actual fuck is happening right now? He feels tears pool at the corners of his eyes and let’s out a small sob. In an instant, Harry has him turned around and removes the mug and spoon from his hands and wraps him in an even tighter frontal hug. “Harry. I-I don’t know what’s come over me – I – I’m sorry. I can’t stop crying.”
Harry waves a plate of food in front of Teddy. “And what’s wrong with being chipper in the morning?” Teddy watches through suspicious eyes as Harry takes a seat across from him with his own plate and frowns at Teddy’s inscrutable gaze. “What?” He asks through a mouthful of egg.
Lucius cocks an eyebrow. “Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter having lunch?” He lets out a thoughtful hum. “Hell must be freezing over.” He follows Harry to the door, grabbing his coat off the rack. “Perfect for me. I prefer the cold.”
Draco’s heart thuds anxiously. “Make sure to check that it’s Harry, Scorpius!” He thinks about the last time a deranged ministry employee abused his power and flooed into Draco’s flat trying to kill him. He thanks every higher power that Scorpius was at the Manor. He freezes the hand that’s combing through his hair as the reality settles in. He’ll always be seen as a death eater. He’ll always be a social outcast and he hates how much it affects Scorpius’ life. He always knew he’d be alone, but fuck for Scorpius –
to try and explain. He pulls out his small journal – one that a mind healer had recommended to him after the war to jot down his thoughts when they become overwhelming.
“Nonsense.” She gently loops her arm through his guiding him to the couch before placing him down. “You look a bit peckish, dear. Long day at the ministry?” She stands up. “Let me have the house elves prepare some tea sandwiches.” She walks away and the tray floats to the coffee table, dropping carefully on the wooden surface.
Draco swallows. “What’s that?” His voice cracks but he doesn’t bother to clear his throat because he’s not sure what’s going on and he’s not sure whether he loves it or hates it.
as possible, but he’s heard he’s got cousins – Scorpius and Draco you know…” His heart flutters at the mention of Draco’s name. “Teddy would like to meet them, and I – I’d like to reconnect with Cissy. I know it’s a lot to ask Harry but-,”
He’s released from St. Mungo’s on a cold day mid-November. He’s sitting in a chair in his room, he can hear his mother singing a lullaby to Scorpius in the other room and he’s grateful for her. The reality of his break up settles in his chest.
“Stop it, Blaise.” He turns his nose up. “I’m not asking for help. I’ll be fine figuring this out on my own.”
Theo drops his forehead to the table and groans. “The problem with Draco is that he’s so fucking stubborn. He’d probably fall in love and not even know or acknowledge it.”
“Father…” Draco stands slowly and holds out a hand and places himself between Lucius and Potter. He gives Lucius a knowing look and the older wizard slumps in defeat.
The door to his office opens and he hastily stuffs the letter beneath a few parchments on his desk as Ron enters the room. “Hey mate, you ready to grab lunch?”
Teddy and Scorpius rush through the door. “Are you?” Teddy looks hopeful. “Thank Merlin, Harry can’t cook.”
Draco shifts uncomfortably. “Yes, well the first five years were a little…” He clears his throat. “Anyway, I work primarily from home and in a private…
Draco nods and a moment later he feels the same pull at his navel, spiraling until a second later his feet hit the doorstep outside the manor. He pulls out of Potter’s grasp and smooths out his clothes. “Thank you, Potter.”
“Wh-What happened?” His voice is hoarse and he swallows thickly. His mother, bless her, conjures a glass of water which he guzzles gratefully. He hears a small beep and he realizes he’s in St. Mungo’s.
“I don’t want you to put your own happiness aside to try and help me.” He reaches out and rubs away a small spot of dry batter off Harry’s cheek. “You’ve had enough of that to last a lifetime.”
how long it’s been since he’s been on a fucking date. He checks his reflection one more time – simple white button up, steel gray waist coat and a pair of form fitting black pants. He shifts on his feet, frowning slightly.
Harry groans and shifts his body, pushing Draco forward. The blonde catches himself on one hand by Harry’s head, his face hovering inches above his. “I’m fine.” Harry mumbles. He reaches out and tucks a loose strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “Are you okay?”
They spend the next hour mixing ingredients and monitoring the oven. Harry’s placing his finished muffins in a container, and setting the scones in a separate one. The kitchen is a bit messier than Draco had planned because Potter cooks as he lives – chaotically.
He’s going to absolutely kill Pansy. Tax accountants are every bit as boring as Draco feared. He quietly unlocks the door to his small two story brownstone flat. He flicks his gaze up to the too loud ticking clock and frowns. Merlin, you know it’s a bad date when you’re home by ten. He quietly toes off his shoes, and hangs up his thick coat.
Even after the war, he hasn’t had a whole lot of success. His sentence is reduced to five years in Azkazban thanks to the testimony of one Harry Potter – of
He nods. “Yeah, it’s close to the bookstore and to Scorp’s muggle school.” He shrugs and readjusts the small child. “And we can always use the floo network to get to and from Diagon, the daycare and the manor.”
He opens his mouth and his expression shifts into concern. “Draco, are you alright? You look – freezing? Your lips are blue.” Scorpius squirms out of Harry’s grasp and runs to Draco, giving his legs a tight squeeze.
Scorpius nods and looks at Malfoy who’s currently talking to an older woman behind the counter. “Yes, he’s very pretty. Mr. McLaggen thinks so.”
Potter chuckles lightly. “Merlin Malfoy, you wouldn’t be you without being a posh arse!” He gets a good look at Potter and tries not to stare. He’s filled out this past decade, his skin tan – a stark contrast to the white snow on the streets and buildings behind him, his hair as untidy as ever… He’s wearing a maroon jumper and a pair of dark fitted jeans and sneakers.
to freeze his fucking heart. Just fucking fantastic. He runs a hand through his dirty hair. His mother is definitely not gonna take this well. And Scorpius – he feels a pang in his chest. He drops his face in his hands. He knows his mom and dad would never let anything bad happen to Scorp, but… he thinks about ten years ago.
“Yes. I think it’s important to bury the hatchet, so to speak, with the Malfoys. In fact I-,” He hesitates slightly. “I had tea wit the Malfoys the other day.”
, you are. Go ahead, Blaise’s office is at the end of the hall.” He nods in the direction and winks. “Have fun.”
Draco nods against his neck and gathers himself together because he probably only has a moment to piece it together before Scorpius returns. Harry pulls him away to look at him and runs his thumbs across Draco’s cheeks, wiping the remainder of his tears. “I want you to tell me when you’re ready.” He pauses, hands grasping Draco’s shoulders. “Can I ask why you won’t?”
to find love for Scorpius really. Merlin, what is he gonna do? If he’s gone, Scorpius will be all alone and he can’t ask his parents to raise his son. It’s selfish, it’s inconsiderate, it’s –
God, this was so fucked up. But damn was Draco so happy. “Me and Scorp will be there. I’ll call my mum to iron out the details.” A thought strikes him and he boldly asks, “Do you want to come over beforehand? So um – so Scorp and Teddy can hang out for a bit, and we can just go to the Manor together?”
Draco shifts his weight, gripping his arm tightly. “Err -,” Why is talking about this with Harry so difficult? It’s not like they’re –
“Why hello, Mr. Scorpius!” She greets back bopping his nose. “Have you met my mom’s friend Mr. Potter?”
He’ll be quick. Drop the folder on his desk, sneeze on something and leave. And if Blaise is there – well even better, he’ll just sneeze on Blaise.
And for the first time in his life, Draco Malfoy’s heart broke. With five years in Azkaban, he had plenty of time to think about what a horrible father he had. He grew angry at his father for treating him so poorly. Bitter at his mother for letting it happen. So, when the three of them were released, he didn’t return to the manor.
He’s checking himself in the mirror and can’t help but agree. He’s wearing an emerald green sweater with a Slytherin house symbol on the front that’s slightly too big and has him rolling up the sleeves at the wrists. Merlin, he drowns in everything he puts on. He’s got a pair of gray heathered chinos and a black pair of snow boots. There’s a chime at the floo and Scorpius lets out an excited squeal.
“Yes, he is.” He glances down at his watch. “I should probably get him home.” He grunts as he stands, pushing in his chair with one hand.
He looks away. He thinks about the way Draco looks at Scorpius, about his hair haloed against the afternoon light from the window in the bookstore. He thinks about pink dusting his cheeks when he’s embarrassed, thinks about the silver gray eyes swarming with emotion…
.” Harry gets up and starts to shoulder on his coat. “Hey – uh Ron,” He shuts the office door behind them. “Do you happen to know what Cormac McLaggen has been up to lately?”
Potter smiles fondly at Scorpius and it makes something flip in the pit of Draco’s stomach. “He’s an amazing kid, Malfoy.”
Draco smooths out his crisp shirt, the warm air from the fire place warming his skin. “Yes well – probably a good call, Potter.” He grimaces. “I’ve known Goyle a long time. A Goyle emergency could be anything from spelling something for him to some weird sexual act.”
“Mr. Malfoy, did you drink a potion to freeze your heart?” His face is blank as he asks and Draco flushes, turning away.
He snaps his eyes open meeting a strong chiseled chest beneath a maroon jumper. He slowly lifts his gaze up and meets the eyes of a familiar pair of shockingly green eyes and a pair of black square rimmed glasses. His first thought is a faint feeling of disappointment at the loss of round metal glasses. “P-Potter?”
He takes his seat in the uncomfortable waiting chair. He picks up a Witch Weekly, flipping through the pages disinterestedly. He really should have brought a book.
“Shhh…” Harry holds his head to his neck and runs his fingers through his hair. “It’s okay. Draco, I promise it’s okay.”
It’s during Scorpius’ first birthday – a small affair involving his parents and his friends - that his mother intervenes.
In a moment there’s a crack in the air, and a sudden wave of magic nearly punches the breath out of Draco.
Harry takes them through a back entry and exit to and from the Ministry, made specifically for Harry to inconspicuously come and go as he pleases. Once they leave, he apparates them to a safe point and makes his way to a muggle Italian restaurant. Lucius looks mildly uncomfortable and is content to let Harry take the lead. When they’re finally seated, waters in front of them Harry clasps his hands and leans on the table.
Draco falls asleep to the rise and fall of Harry’s chest and the calloused fingers running through his scalp.
Malfoy stands up straight and clears his throat. “Right then. I’ll be done at twelve. Scorp wanted to show you around for a bit and then we’ll grab lunch. Sound good?”
Potter swallows a bite of his sandwich. “No, no. I’m not trying to insult you, I’m just shocked is all.”
He shakes his head a bit. “Hey I’m not a posh arse I-,” He feels another sharp pain in his chest and he clutches at his V neck sweater, hunching over.
He turns to Hermione and opens his mouth before she cuts him off. “I’ve got it. I’ll owl Ron and Pansy.”
“Scorpius!” And Draco nearly jumps to hear the admonishing tone in Harry’s voice. “Absolutely not. Who told you that?”
want to.” He hesitates. “Hermione I – I know it sounds crazy, but I – I think I might be falling in love with him.” He can’t look at her, so he settles for looking at the rings on his hands. “I know it’s crazy. Who falls in love in two weeks? I – It’s not love, right? I must be mad. Malfoy and I – Draco and I hardly know each other.”
Draco takes a bite and moans. “Oh my Merlin, Potter this burger…” He groans. “I would commit crime for this burger.” He takes another bite and notes that Harry is oddly quiet. His eyes flick up and Harry’s staring at him, his own burger suspended in front of his mouth. Draco swallows the bite in his mouth and Harry tracks the movement. He’s staring at Draco, a hungry look in his eyes that has the blonde baffled. If he’s so hungry, why is he just holding his burger? It’s not like he can eat, Draco –
Harry has probably literally never cared about his appearance so much in his life then he has over the past two weeks. He’s not entirely sure what constitutes as proper brunch wear, but he finds himself video calling the last person he ever thought he would on a Sunday morning at 8AM.
He takes a deep bracing breath as he enters the Curse Breaking Department at the Ministry. He scans the room and notices that thankfully no one is in the waiting room. The same witch from yesterday is sitting behind a desk and a stocky tanned, bloke with – yup that is quite literally bulging muscles – is leaning over it saying something flirty by the looks of it.
He takes off the oven mitts and pulls the blueberry muffins out and begins fanning them off before grabbing the second tray and sliding them in the oven. He hears Scorpius direct Harry to the kitchen. Potter comes into the door just as Draco slides the tray in and straightens up his stance. “Harry.”
Teddy stands up in his skates and helps Scorpius to his feet. “You bet! Started skating when I was your age! Ready to get on the ice, bud?”
Draco throws his head back. “Honestly, father. I can’t believe you convinced him to call me that.” Draco opens his arms. “Come here, Scorp.” Lucius lifts the five year old and places him carefully in Draco’s lap. He grunts as his son throws his arms around his neck.
As Harry shifts on the doorstep he can’t help but feel like this is top three of the weirdest days of his life. In fact, fighting Voldemort was definitely more normal than this. At least that had been predetermined before his birth, but having tea and sandwiches with the Malfoys on a Friday afternoon…
Scorpius pouts, his bottom lip quivering. “But-,” And Jesus Christ, there’s no way Harry’s gonna say no to that adorable little face.
“Mr. Harry!” The small blonde crumples and rushes forward, wrapping his body around Harry and breaking out into an immediate sob. He’s babbling incoherently and gasping for air.
Teddy grabs Scorp’s hand. “Excellent! Then when you two have finished snogging, Scorpius and I would like some hot cocoa.”
“So… there’s nothing?” Draco can hear the clock loudly ticking on the wall behind the desk. “You guys can’t do anything for me.”
Draco looks over and cocks an eyebrow at him. “Cooking is like potions and I’ve seen your mediocre potion performance.”
“It was nothing. Plus,” He shrugs and holds up the plant and the sandwiches. “I got food and a plant. I think we’re even.” They share a light laugh, and Merlin does Harry want to hear Malfoy’s breathy laugh again. He hesitates, but he’s curious by nature and a deep pit in his stomach just
He wonders if it had been better to force things to work with Eric. He should have stayed with him. Gone home with him. Introduced him Scorpius.
“No.” His resolute tone has Harry snapping his mouth shut. Scorpius holds up his wrist revealing a metal cuff. “I did somefing I’m not supposed to. I switched them.”
Potter gives Scorpius a bright smile. “Well, hello Scorpius. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Harry.” He looks around before leaning forward. “I’ll let you in on a little secret,” Scorpius leans forward slightly to hear him. “I’m a little shy too.”
Draco sits on the couch across from him, smirking. “Mother’s a doterr. She’s not going to let you leave until she’s positive you’ve had enough to eat and enough tea to fight the cold.”
” He shrugs and sits up straight opening his eyes and letting his chair drop. “I just feel like with Teddy starting at Hogwarts next year, and me being so slammed at work that maybe… maybe I just need to step back a bit.”
He scowls down at his phone. What the fuck is a tax accountant? He shrugs to himself and shoves it back in his pocket.
Harry’s blood runs cold and he barely registers that they’re moving to a booth for Seamus’ safety according to Dean.
Draco blushes. “I think it tastes better that way. Besides, if Scorpius brings a muggle friend over from school, I have to make sure I don’t get caught doing wizard things.”
All too soon, Scorpius is fidgeting in his clothes wearing a pair of black jeans and a pair of black snow boots. Much to Draco’s dismay, Scorp is heavily into cats and Christmas and he’s excitedly donning a deep forest green sweater with a cat on it that says ‘Meowy Christmas’. There are white snowflakes dotted all over the sweater. He hangs up Scorpius’ winter coat by the door. “Alright Scorpius, I’m going to get ready.”
“Hey!” Harry admonishes. “Shut up and go play.” Scorpius squeals and Teddy chuckles as they rush out of the room and up a flight of stairs. Draco chuckles and turns back to the counter to begin working on his scones. Harry pushes up off the wall and stands beside him. “What are you making?” He reaches out to poke at one of the fresh warm muffles, and Draco swiftly swats his hand away. “Ow! Why?”
“I’d give it one month before your heart stops.” The Doctor mutters a spell to his wand. “I’m recommending you to see a curse breaker at the ministry. I’ll set you an appointment for tomorrow morning.” He rises to his feet.
