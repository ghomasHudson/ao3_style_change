Opening his dinner jacket, Mr Malfoy withdrew a black book from the inner pocket. He waved it as he spoke. “
Well I didn’t make my self-assigned deadline, but that’s all right. I was really having a rough go of it, trying to balance Snape being a good teacher while keeping him in character, so I spent a bit longer than I’d originally wanted ironing out the issues. I hope it’s worth the wait; I’m much happier with it now.
And they did. But each time they snuck into Mr Malfoy’s office, the compartment was still empty. Eventually, even that disappeared, leaving only the flat top of the desk, so they turned their attention to the rest of the manor. As they searched, Draco and his mother went over the Diagon Alley trip in great detail.
“You are to accompany me there, regardless,” said Mr Malfoy, his hands tightening on his cane. “Do not forget your cloak. Knockturn Alley is the last place to attract attention, better to wear something dark there.”
Mrs Malfoy was reading when he entered the room. Despite being propped up in bed by several pillows, her posture was impeccable. Her eyes tightened in the corners when she saw he was alone. “Thank you, dear. This was unexpected,” she said and set her novel aside.
distressed. Sometimes he dreaded coming down to Professor Snape’s office, which then made him feel insurmountably guilty, because Professor Snape was only trying to help him. He was doing his best to make sure Draco was comfortable, too, even as they expanded that definition of comfort…
Draco pressed the side of his face more firmly into his pillow. “I don’t know what you mean. If I’m to become Harry Potter, it’s in body only— I haven’t gotten access to your thoughts. Though if I had, I bet they’d be really mundane — you aren’t very interesting, you know — so maybe I’m better off…”
Harry woke up in another person’s body. Frankly, aside from a couple of new things — longer limbs and fingers, blonder hair, eyes that worked on their own — he didn’t really feel much different. Of course, being in a taller person’s body meant that his pyjamas didn’t quite fit him the way they normally did. There was now a significant gap between where the striped fabric ended and his wrists and ankles began.
“I wonder what would happen if I were to…target memories, rather than letting them surface on their own,” he said one night. On the shelf behind him, the Pensieve rippled wildly; this was nothing new, nor was the silvery light it gave off, but that night, both seemed almost threatening. “There have been several instances where you have spoken aloud, or moved slightly, to protect yourself from my attacks, but these have been irregular and completely external. Perhaps raising the proverbial stakes will get us the results we’re looking for: an
“I’m sorry, Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione said as the matron opened her mouth to protest, “but usually the doors are open by now. I had to know if Harry was okay.” She leaned around Madam Pomfrey, and looked briefly between the two boys before her gaze landed on Harry. “Are you?”
“I think,” Mr Malfoy said quietly, “that may very well be the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Not selling books until a certain time — and they aren’t new, either — utter tosh. I’ll have another word with that shopkeeper, then, after I’ve found—” he looked more closely at the parchment— “
of it, and definitely not the bits at the—” Draco shut his mouth. Even referencing the end of the fantasy was too much for him. He was grateful for the perpetual chill of the dungeons; he felt his face was nearly on fire for the intensity of his blush.
Madam Pomfrey’s eyebrows came together and she lowered her wand. “Neither has Potter. Have either of you eaten anything?”
Auxerre’s cobbled streets were overrun by Muggles as well, with their swerving “cars” “honking,” their wildly unfashionable clothing choices, and their immobile shop displays. While Draco was not completely unfamiliar with their lifestyle, he couldn’t help wondering if Potter had felt this out of place when he had stepped into Diagon Alley, or if he felt that way every day, sharing a house with three Muggles who despised anything magical. In any case, Draco was glad when they left the city three days later.
“It did,” said Mrs Malfoy, frowning. “Curious… This book appears not to have any magical properties— at least, none that I can detect.”
Harry did a little mock bow, circling his wrist as he bent forward. He put on a very high voice as he said, “I should hope so,
“There could be a million reasons he wouldn’t want to,” Draco said, pulling a frantic hand through his hair. True to form, the black strands immediately sprung back onto his forehead.
Over at the Slytherin table, Pansy was torturing Harry. “Come on,” she said under her breath, “Draco loves veal. It'll be suspicious if you don't eat it.”
Madam Pomfrey’s nostrils widened to twice their usual size. “Very well. Is there any residual pain?”
“It’s possible,” Mrs Malfoy conceded, but she didn’t look convinced either. “We’ll have to keep checking.”
Every time he glanced at his school books, he felt a pang of remembrance that Potter had no access whatsoever to his own. Every time he climbed onto his broomstick to practice for the Slytherin Quidditch team tryouts, he recalled that Potter’s was locked away. Every time he smelled the rich, decadent food Dobby always prepared, it turned his stomach to imagine the scraps Potter was eating, or to wonder if he had been allowed to eat at all that day. Because Potter could starve and no one would know, apart from Draco, Dobby, the Dursleys, and probably the Ministry.
His mother was right, setting a monster loose in Hogwarts would have catastrophic results. True, Draco might have liked to go to a Muggle-born-free school, but that was mainly because Granger was, impossibly, top of their class. His jealousy, he knew, was not a good enough reason to get rid of anyone, no matter the purity of their blood, and certainly murder was not the answer.
Draco was ushered into the drawing room. His mother scanned the entryway before closing the door and pulling him to the far corner.
“Pitiful,” one of the twins commented, saying exactly what Draco had been thinking. There were far more reliable tactics for de-gnoming a garden. “I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.”
“Point proven,” said Harry, eyeing Malfoy’s mussed hair with delight. Malfoy didn’t seem to understand that the action would never bother Harry the way it bothered him.
Potter didn’t let go of Draco’s hand until they reached the doors, which Draco didn’t mind at all. He was glad the invisibility cloak hid the expression on his face, because if it hadn’t, Blaise and Pansy
Pansy’s eyes grew large, but not like she was shocked, more…proud that she had finally gotten Draco to say something she’d known all along. “Who said anything about you
“Really.” There was a dangerous gleam in Pansy’s eye now. “Even before we met Potter, you were already talking about him — what he might look like, what you were going to say when you met him, what House he would end up in, whether he knew anything about the Wizarding world, whether he would be good at Quidditch — and after you officially met him, you only got worse! You bring him up constantly,” she said, reaching for her tea again. “
Draco went down the entire length of the Hogwarts Express, receiving some scornful looks as he peered into every single compartment. He didn’t care about the others, really. It wasn’t as if they ever looked at him any differently, and anyway, they didn’t matter. There was only one face Draco wanted to see, and he had a horrible feeling he wasn’t about to find it.
Draco was silent for a moment as he processed that. Then he felt a tap on his shoulder. He flinched as he turned to see Weasley’s sister standing there.
“Yeah? And how do you suggest we do that?” Potter said hoarsely. “Turn on the light and hold hands?”
January turned into February with little progress. It didn’t help that Draco kept getting distracted by the many other things going on in his life— it was very hard to focus his mind, even with Professor Snape’s guidance. Still, they continued to practice much in the same way…
In two quick motions, Professor Snape pulled his sleeves up to his forearms. He pointed his wand at Draco. “Let’s begin.”
up to me, Father. You know full well she’s only top of the class because all the professors love her.” He set down the salad fork with a heavy clang. He was no longer hungry. “If they graded fairly, I’d be top of the class. I’m much smarter than she is.”
by him.” He scoffed. “It’s not worth it. Potter isn’t what people believe him to be. He’s not special.”
What was worse, he couldn’t stop staring at Potter, which he knew might draw unnecessary attention to them both. So he tried all manner of things to keep himself otherwise occupied — mapping the grain of the wooden table, drinking a ridiculous amount of water, forming a face in his scrambled eggs with his fork, talking with Granger about Transfiguration — but still, he found his eyes veering toward Potter, who, by some miracle, never seemed to be looking back at him.
As he moved down the hall to his parents’ bedroom, he heard faint notes of music coming from behind the double doors. His mother was humming. Draco closed his eyes and leaned his head against the wood, listening despite the tea tray steadily growing heavier in his arms. Something about the tune was familiar, but he couldn’t quite place it. Balancing the tray on one knee, he raised a fist to knock.
If he was honest, Draco felt the same way. He was terrified of the potential abomination he might see if they had not fully transformed yet. He couldn’t tell which parts of his body had changed and which had not — pain has a nasty way of clouding memory — and he was also afraid to look down at his own body, even in the darkness, even with his now-limited sight. But instead of relating any of this to Potter, he said, “How long has it been since the last change?”
“Harry Potter is determined to return, sir,” Dobby squeaked, before quickly adding, “but Dobby cast a Hover Charm. Harry Potter will be expelled! He will have no choice but to stay with his family, where he will be safe.”
“It has to have been a Slytherin, right? I doubt Potter’s friends would have done something like this. Has anyone come forward?”
. Before Draco could figure out which, the train pulled out of King’s Cross and he lost sight of them altogether.
Pansy pulled herself up onto the counter and dangled her pale legs over the side. She smoothed down her skirt. “You've got to whine a bit more when you speak. Draco never would have told you that himself, seeing as he always complains when I tell him he whines. Doesn’t stop it from being true.”
“Oh good,” he said, focussing once more on the parchment in front of him. He began scribbling on it. “Come to change back, Draco?”
“Okay,” Potter said. Then, to approximately where Draco was standing, he added, “Keep the cloak on, I think I hear Nott getting up,” and left the bathroom after Pansy.
His fingers were stiff and shaky; the resulting notes were slow and heavy. Draco knew he should have warmed up first, done some scales, but he didn’t want to spare the time. Playing had always helped him work through things, and he really just wanted to play. He paused, pressing the pedal to hold the notes as he took a calming breath. When he was ready to start again, his touch was lighter and the music flowed more gracefully from him. Eight years of practice could not be undone in one.
“When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography — which I will now be happy to present him now, free of charge—” he paused for more applause— “he had
“Let’s try again,” he said, pushing his black hair out of his eyes, “but first, go back through the memories you prepared. Do not use the one with you, Crabbe, and Goyle flying— that wasn’t long enough, nor did it keep you focussed. Find something completely separate from Potter.”
“I know that,” said Potter, leaning his elbows on the mattress. “But this isn’t Polyjuice, is it? We’ve established that. There’s so much we don’t know about what’s happening. Aren’t you the least bit curious?”
“I’m offended you’d think otherwise,” said Blaise. “Don’t forget, I was here when you first started changing into Potter.”
Dobby opened his mouth in protest, but Draco spoke faster: “Get rid of it and fix this mess,” he said, and stormed out.
appeared on the parchment.) He shared some of the blame, after all. If Draco hadn’t written his father so many times last year about everything Hogwarts had done wrong, his father might not have taken action to “improve” the school. Maybe if he knew more about the Chamber, he could keep it from opening and Potter would be safe— Draco would get to see him again, see him happy…
Potter turned in his chair to face Draco. “So could this one,” he said, his grey eyes sparking with delight. “I wonder what the Slytherins would think if Draco Malfoy suddenly fancied Harry Potter?”
Right as the clock struck eleven, the train lurched forward. Draco shook his head, hardly daring to blink as the station slid away. A flurry of movement outside the window made Draco press himself against it, then turn his neck so far it was almost backward on his shoulders. The adult Weasleys had started bolting for the gateway, looking very like they had misplaced something…
“It’s…” She looked at the ceiling, seeming to steel herself. “I had a thought while you and your father were out… What if the book we found doesn’t need words to do its job? What if simply having it on your person is enough to open the Chamber of Secrets?”
“This looks right,” he said, finally. The tiredness that had left his face crept over it again. “All of this looks right.”
“You did,” Potter said, and tugged him down for a kiss that was far, far better than their first one, and not only because they were in the proper bodies this time. Potter’s lips were soft and warm and open slightly; his hands were insistent on messing up Draco’s hair, and the one thought Draco kept coming back to, besides
“Is it really.” Draco peered at him. “Very well. Though I really shouldn't be seen calling you Harry or Potter, since we've switched.”
“Your fantasy— Seeing how much time you devote to watching Potter, I’m surprised it wasn’t more accurate… Though perhaps you do more watching than you do listening?”
A couple minutes later, the door carved itself into the wall and swung open, revealing a very tired, very confused Pansy. “Draco,” she said, “what are you doing here?”
Draco had always liked the disorder, but today he loved it; it reminded him of Hogwarts. He already missed the old castle. Malfoy Manor wasn’t nearly as large, but it had only four residents: Draco, his parents, and their house-elf, Dobby. Hogwarts was as crowded with people as this greenhouse was with plants. If Draco closed his eyes, he could almost mistake the fluttering of butterflies, the buzz of the beehive ginger, and the snaps of the Venomous Tentacula for the shouts and laughter of his peers. Amidst the tangled noise of the greenhouse, it was impossible to feel alone, or lonely.
“—you here to discuss a new Act in the works at the Ministry,” came his father’s voice. “If it passes, that means they will be making house calls. Be certain that will include anyone with ties to the Dark Lord. They will scour our homes for anything that, should they at some point fall into non-magical hands, would cause harm.”
She had never once, as far as Draco could remember, woken him up. His parents had always expected him to do that himself.
After one last look at the cabinet, Draco reluctantly followed his father out of Borgin and Burkes. The pair travelled up the dusty path, passing shops selling dark books, unstable and unorthodox potions ingredients, poisonous candles, and one that looked full of illegal creatures. The couple from earlier were nowhere to be seen, and Draco didn’t know how to feel about that.
can’t do it,” Pansy said quietly, “I haven’t been coming in as often as I usually do, Potter isn’t used to that.”
“You’re welcome, Mother,” said Draco. She gestured for him to sit in her desk chair, which he pulled beside the bed. He poured tea into the teacups, adding liberal amounts of honey to both and stirring so it would dissolve. Feverfew, though excellent for curing migraines, was very bitter.
“Hmph. Well,” Draco said, ankling up to him, “lucky for you, once was enough.” He grabbed the front of Potter’s robes with both hands. “Come here.”
“It’s a lot nicer than I r- than I thought it would be,” said Harry, deciding not to let on that he’d been there before.
“Excellent,” said Blaise. He set his homework aside so he could bend his knees, then laced his hands behind his head. “Let the show begin!”
I said about that, Potter?” Draco asked Tuesday morning, when Potter came back from a shower with impossibly dishevelled hair.
“I’d like to see them Mudbloods gone for good,” said Crabbe, and Goyle nodded eagerly. “Shouldn’t never have allowed them in in the first place, y’ask me.”
“Of course you don’t. That’s why it’s more important than ever for us to find that diary. And we will,” Mrs Malfoy added, putting a soothing hand on Draco’s. “There are only so many places it can be. We’ll find it, don’t worry.”
Life as Harry Potter proved far more difficult than Draco thought it would be. Everywhere he went, people stared at him, or got in his way, or in the case of that little Creevey boy, took pictures of him at inopportune moments. And Potter’s friends were, impossibly, more annoying than they seemed on the surface level. The worst offence was that they never really listened to him when he complained about Potter. Even when Pansy was tired of hearing about him, Draco always had Crabbe and Goyle.
It was the third week of June, which meant the students of Hogwarts were en route to King’s Cross Station. Most talked excitedly about the events leading up to their final exams (“I wish I’d gotten to see McGonagall’s giant chess set!”) or their plans for summer break (“Australia, would you believe?”), but Draco Malfoy was not most students. His eyes were closed, and his head, which rested against the back of his seat, rocked as the train chugged steadily on. Though to Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle, he may have looked asleep, Draco was thinking about his enemy: Harry Potter.
The man seemed shocked that she had addressed him. He struggled for a moment, clearly deciding whether or not he was going to respond, before saying, “In a manner of speaking.” He then turned to Potter and spat, “Hurry up, boy. We haven’t got all day.”
“Why do you think I didn’t—” Draco ripped a large piece from his breadstick and started dunking it violently into his soup. A few droplets landed on the tablecloth, vanishing as soon as they touched the fabric. “You should know better than to bring Blaise up to me, Father. We are no longer friends.”
Lockhart waved jovially, winking at the camera. Draco shook his head. He didn’t believe a word of the stories Lockhart told about himself. The man below him did not seem capable of fending off a gust of air, let alone a pack of hungry griffins, among the other things he claimed to have done. And besides, he wasn’t even very good-looking. Those people were fawning over a mediocre man and substandard wizard. Draco couldn’t believe that imbecile was going to be their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher come September.
The curtains twitched. Draco moved to get a better glimpse, but the man with the drill shifted, as if to block him. Draco’s shock evaporated. “Oi!” he shouted into the noise of the drill. “You TWISTED BASTARD! HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHO’S IN THAT ROOM?”
“That’s okay,” said Pansy. She laid down beside him. “You don’t have to tell me. We can just lie here if you like, we don’t have to talk.”
Pansy nodded, humour plain in her brown eyes. “I see,” she said, turning her head away dramatically. “Then I’ll be on my way.”
It was early enough in the morning that it was unlikely for anyone to be awake, but still they were careful. The air felt thick as Draco and Pansy pushed their way upstairs and then into the dark, but empty, corridor leading to the boys’ dormitories. Their luck expired soon enough, though: when Pansy swung open the door to Draco’s dorm, there was a wand light coming from deep within the room, tinged green by the curtains drawn around the person’s bed. At the sound of the door creaking open, the curtains were thrust aside, revealing a worried, then nonplussed, Blaise.
, the same way he didn’t belong to the Dursleys or to the Wizarding world. Draco couldn’t go around deciding things for him. The decision had to be Potter’s. Draco needed to give him the facts.
“Mm-hm. And it doesn’t matter that it looks deliberate, because it is. I should know, I’ve seen him practice.”
The pair approached the counter and Mr Malfoy dinged another bell. There was a thump from the back room.
But… If he couldn’t prevent Potter from going back to Hogwarts, Draco would have to learn everything he could about the Chamber of Secrets. (
There was more applause from the crowd as Potter was given what looked like a very heavy, very cumbersome stack of books. Draco took this as his chance to start making his way downstairs. Potter would probably want to escape the spotlight after that horrible encounter, it was the perfect time to run “accidentally” into him. Draco pushed past the many people who had squeezed themselves onto the balcony, holding his breath so he could make himself that much smaller…
Out in the hall, Draco faltered. Lining the walls of the entire ground floor were countless shifting portraits of his relatives, and Draco usually ignored them, but tonight he was all too aware of their curious and judgemental gazes. Draco bowed his head for fear of what his expression alone might reveal. If asked, each and every single one of them would agree with his father— that Hogwarts would be better off if only purebloods were allowed to go.
Draco touched the ruffled petals of the closest bundle. He knew strong emotion could sometimes bring out incredible magic, but why now? And why flowers of all things? Why
“No, our dear Minister has thus far been oblivious to our…shall we say, more discreet activities,” Mr Malfoy continued, “but we must take steps to ensure he
“Of course,” Draco said, bowing his head. He didn’t ask what the Dark Lord had seen, he knew exactly what he’d shown the man: only the things that would corroborate his family’s memories of the events. Draco also didn’t ask what would come of their letting Potter go; Draco was sure to find out eventually, and didn’t dare bring punishment on himself early.
He made it down the stairs in time to see Potter tip the stack into Ginny Weasley’s cauldron. Enraged that she would, yet again, make it impossible to talk to Potter alone, Draco almost didn’t notice how both of them were covered in a fine layer of soot, or that Potter looked both taller and skinnier than he had done last June.
“I suppose,” he said, somewhat put out. He watched Potter grow smaller and less distinct as he walked away. If that ginger-haired she-devil hadn’t interfered…
Thankfully, Granger intervened. She reached for Draco’s plate and held it toward Weasley. “Will you finish this? I don’t know where Harry’s mind is tonight, but he certainly won't be eating it.”
Ron smiled. “Come on, then, we’d better be going,” he said, reaching an arm across Malfoy’s shoulders. He winked at Harry before they and Hermione continued on their way.
Mr Malfoy’s nostrils widened as he took in what appeared to be a calming breath, and Draco thought he was likely remembering a similar conversation from the meeting Draco had overheard.
“I was wondering if you’d let me stay and watch next time. Since you two clearly didn’t do the deed.”
“Okay, but Draco, you bullied him nonstop all last year. Do you really think you’re any better? If so, you really do have a warped impression of him, and of what you think he deserves.” She set down her tea. “Why do you care, anyway? I thought you hated him.”
when I think I have everything under control, Weasley ruins it for me! I suppose he’d think it funny, if he knew…”
sort of rugged. Potter's shoulder-length hair, the dark stubble covering his jaw, and the way his tan skin had smoothed again were definitely doing things for Draco…
He needed to get rid of this one. It was ginormous, and its roots had thoroughly destroyed the floor— about half the wooden panels had been completely jackknifed, creating a wide, jagged circle around the tree. There was no way he would be able to dispose of it neatly with his hands, and he wasn’t yet skilled enough with magic to simply vanish it.
Draco’s scowl deepened when he caught sight of Weasley smirking. “Think this is funny, do you, Weasley? I’d curb that amusement if I were you. If I’m right, your best mate’s about to turn into me, for who knows how long.”
“How can I not, when you refuse to acknowledge the dangers you’ll be sending him into? And, might I remind you, you brought this up over dinner! What did you expect, to laugh together over drinks while we decided the fate of innocent children?”
“Good job it’s a weekend, then,” Harry said brightly. “And besides, depending on when Madam Pomfrey lets us go and when we get sorted, you might not ever have to put on Gryffindor robes. I can see it pains you to have even touched them at all.”
“Draco,” came a voice from over his shoulder. It was his mother, standing tall in fashionable teal robes. Her white-blonde hair was the same shade as Draco’s, but hers was much longer. Today, it was arranged in a loose bun right above her neck. “Are you ready?”
Then his ribs decided to unfurl. He let out a ragged scream as he felt them scrape menacingly against the inside of his skin.
The flashes stopped, and Potter clearly thought that would be the end of it, starting back toward the Weasleys, but Lockhart reeled Potter back in, throwing an arm around his shoulders and trapping him in place. Draco angrily gripped the balcony railing.
“Not going to do it here, obviously,” said Draco thinly, moving to Potter’s bed. Gently, he opened the curtains.
The hospital wing was dark, save for a lonely light over a single bed. The occupant was shrouded by two figures that Draco could not make out, even when squinting. They turned at the sound of someone entering the room. Madam Pomfrey and Weasley’s faces took shape as Draco approached, but they were still somewhat out of focus. On his way to the hospital wing, Draco’s other eye had become as blurry as the left. Though he didn’t have a mirror, Draco figured they were both green now.
“I suppose,” said Draco thoughtfully. He admired his — Potter’s — long, callused fingers and decided he didn’t want to risk either outcome. He and Potter both had nice hands.
There was that word again. “Love.” In the letters Draco sent to his friends, he always ended with his name. Just his name. Anything more, anything that signified affection, felt wrong. And Draco didn’t blame himself for that. How could he? Allies were hard to come by when you were associated with the Dark Lord, and it was even more perilous to turn your back on those allies, so he put up with Pansy’s teasing, Crabbe and Goyle’s stupidity, and Blaise’s tendency to be several steps beyond offensive.
“Pansy,” Draco complained as she closed the closet doors and sorted through his dresser. He stood by, watching as she held up a pair of his underpants with a smirk, not inclined to interfere yet. When she went for his desk, however, he threw himself in front of her. “Stop, I haven’t got anything for you!”
Draco turned down what he hoped would be a less crowded corridor, and was happy to note that there were only a couple students there. He began walking backward so he could watch Potter’s face as he said, “What are you suggesting we do, eh,
from the music desk, where it swayed back and forth as it fell. He didn’t care to find a piece of music that matched his burgeoning mess of emotion, he just wanted to play.
Pansy went straight to the summer garden and plopped down underneath Draco’s favourite oak tree. She launched into a discussion of the recent dragon scandal in Brazil (“I mean,
Draco lowered his wand hand, releasing the grasshopper. It vaulted away— large, brown, and conspicuous against the green of the grass. “Why all the sudden interest in my thoughts?”
Draco blinked. There was something on the ceiling, but…wait, that wasn’t right. He swivelled on the bench until he was facing the other direction. He didn’t know how he could have missed it, but while he’d been playing, a tree had grown behind him— a large, but delicate thing with silvery leaves and long branches weighed down by strings of golden flowers. Yellow acacia.
Startled at the proximity of the girl’s voice, (she was standing in front of the next column!) Draco tripped over his things. Talos, his eagle owl, awoke and nipped angrily at the bars of his cage.
“I understand, sir,” said Mr Borgin, who was turning like he wanted to go into the back room, “of course, let me see…”
The photographer hastened to the front of the crowd, pushing people out of the way to get another shot of Lockhart. He aimed his camera at the man, but before he could snap another picture, Lockhart stood abruptly, shouting, “It
“Of course it was,” Draco said, “you’ve seen how he’s treated at school. It’s the same everywhere he goes— everywhere but at home.”
On the fourth day, Draco and Dobby found the Dursleys’ house much worse for wear. It looked as though it had gotten into a fight and earned a black eye for it: Potter’s bedroom window, and really, most of the siding surrounding it, had been completely torn away, leaving a great hole on the second floor.
Draco nudged Potter’s neck back around. “One atrocity at a time,” he said, and was pleased to note that, even though his face felt warm, no colour was visible in the mirror. “Your normal bird’s nest might suit
Draco quite agreed. Especially now that it was even clearer he had no hope of talking to Potter whatsoever. Not with so many Weasleys there to block him. But Draco held his ground, waiting for the Weasleys to make the first move toward the door. They should be the ones to leave, no matter how much he wanted to.
Mr Malfoy’s study was a large room on the ground floor. Its walls were an expansive indigo that, in the night, melded with the dark wooden flooring. Standing in the entryway, the room looked to be a great hole in the manor, with strange shapes jutting out to form Mr Malfoy’s desk, bookshelf, filing cabinets, and end tables.
Breakfast lasted a fair bit longer than Draco wanted it to. He knew Potter was hardly going to make his decision in such a short amount of time — it was a big thing Draco was asking of him — and he was even
He turned to his mother, who had watched with growing concern as he riffled through the book. “There’s got to be a spell of some sort, right?” he said earnestly. “To make words appear?”
“Quiet, Draco,” Professor Snape said. His voice became monotone and almost lazy when he spoke again: “Envision all your thoughts and feelings as a tree, the oldest you can think of. Draw your attention to the roots— see how they tangle together and grow from each other, how they sit weightily in the grass. Follow the roots that extend beneath the soil
“Yeah, why is that?” Harry crossed back to the doorway. “He’s hardly ever alone. If he’s not with Crabbe and Goyle, he's with you, or all three of you.”
Draco’s eyes bulged. “WHAT?” He threw off the covers and leapt to his feet. He spun into his dressing gown, skated into his slippers. “Take me there. Now.”
Mr Malfoy looked down at his watch. “12:00 P.M. precisely. It seems,” he squinted at the bookshop, “that the masses have yet to arrive. Excellent. No need to rub elbows with our inferiors any more than is strictly necessary.”
Draco crossed to his desk and picked up Potter’s letters. He still wanted Potter to have them. “Take these. Tell him this was all
“Oh no,” said Draco, wiping a hand over his face. He and Potter flew in completely different ways; that wasn’t something Draco could replicate. And he’d be a truly, truly awful coach, especially for Gryffindor. “I can’t do that.”
But maybe Draco was looking at things wrong. Potter was kind and warm and caring, all despite his awful upbringing. And he was brave and determined, or he would have died the previous year, protecting the Sorcerer’s Stone. Potter tended to do well in perilous situations. If Granger had been right — if the Dark Lord was indeed alive — then Potter was a symbol of hope, not someone in need of protection. Maybe he could handle this too.
Potter locked the door— a sound that thundered against the stone walls. Draco’s heart echoed in his chest at what seemed like the same level as he realised: Potter was staring at him for the first time that morning.
“Well how was I to know that the curse — or spell, whatever this is — would transform you completely?” Ron countered. “There are a couple curses that involve switching eyes, or feet, or something, usually between enemies or people who don’t get along.”
idea to send Potter any acknowledgement of the occasion, however anonymous he was able to make the card.
half-bloods, too. Don’t tell me you’d be fine with dying.” Facing Draco, she added, “It won’t kill Crabbe and Goyle, will it? Can the monster tell what someone’s blood status is?”
She shook her head. “I said nothing when you were working for the Dark Lord, nothing when I saw the things you did to please him, but I will
When Draco and his father got home, Mrs Malfoy was waiting in the entryway for them. “Draco,” she said, “a moment?”
Draco scowled. Ginny Weasley, now staring brazenly at Potter, had made herself an enemy. She was lucky they were in a Muggle train station, or she might have been jinxed.
to look forward to. The Weasleys must have treated Potter much better than the Dursleys had, and he was sure to look healthier… If he did, that would mean Draco’s efforts over the summer hadn’t been a complete disaster.
“My—?” Potter sat up and started rubbing his eyes. Even in the dim light of Blaise’s wand, Draco could see distinct red lines crisscrossing the right side of Potter’s face, left over from where his pillow had creased. It stretched up to his forehead, mimicking Potter’s lightning bolt scar.
He played the next melody with ferocity, trying not to over-pedal to keep the treble texture distinct. (
Mrs Malfoy shook her head. “That’s the thing. The compartment in your father’s desk was empty when I looked. And I asked Dobby, he said Lucius took it with him today.”
After a time, Draco let out a final shaky sob and wiped his eyes. He was being ridiculous. Potter wasn’t his to protect. Potter wasn’t
My schedule is very strange atm, so I'm not sure yet what day of the week I'll be able to publish new chapters. I will say that these nine chapters are completely finished, I just want to make sure I'm at least 95% happy with them when it's their time to go out into the world. Posting on a week-by-week basis gives Inspiration that much more time to gift me with rewrites for stuff I think could be improved. Because I'm a perfectionist who goes back and edits the hell out of everything I write, even after posting. Thankfully, y'all don't get updated every time I go back in ;)
“Here,” said Hermione, holding Harry’s robes out to him. Then she seemed to think better of it. “Actually, I guess they’re for Malfoy now? Since they’ll fit?” She handed them to the other boy.
Draco pursed his lips and tried not to get defensive. Pansy was sure to comment on that, too, and he didn’t want to get into it. Not with her, not after Blaise… “It’s possible to hate your enemy and pity them at the same time, you know,” he said, as calmly as he could manage.
“Perceptive of you, Potter,” said Malfoy, smiling maliciously. He swung his legs theatrically over the side of his bed. “Maybe you’ll learn something from this whole mess.”
But now really wasn’t the time to wax poetic about how pretty Potter was. The icy hand was in this memory, too…
“Today I will begin by targeting a specific memory,” Professor Snape said, when their meeting began. “Sometime over the holidays, your mother spoke to you about getting Occlumency lessons from me, am I correct?”
Minor warning bc there’s a short, relatively vague (but still spicy) Drarry scene later on in this chapter. I didn’t think it was enough to change the rating to teen though.
The keys slid beneath Draco’s fingers as he finished the piece on the tonic of D sharp minor. The notes charged off into the air. Everything about his life had been upended when he had foolishly decided to ruin Potter’s.
Draco braced himself against the column and glared out from behind it. ‘Ginny’ was obviously a Weasley— if her bright red hair and oversized, dirt-covered boots weren’t indication enough, Ronald ‘right sort’ Weasley tugging his friends over only confirmed it.
Draco found the catchflies mere minutes before his parents were due back from their morning walk. Upon seeing the star-shaped flowers, Draco shouted, grabbed them by their stems, and ripped them from the floor, burning them as he had done the gillyflowers. He then jammed Weasley’s letter, unopened, into his suitcase.
“If you’re not back to normal when you’re discharged,” Hermione said cautiously, “that could come in handy. Unless we want to confuse the whole school, it would be smart to figure out how to act like each other.”
“Do I have to worry about him?” said Harry, flipping a page in his book without having read anything inside.
Some time later, Dobby found Draco and told him Pansy was calling for him. Draco rushed up to his bedroom and sat on the floor between the couch and marble fireplace. An approximation of Pansy’s face flickered in the orange flames.
Unfortunately, the secret was kept for all of one day. Or rather, part of it was. Once the other students noticed Draco and Potter were absent from classes that Monday, the natural assumption was that they had tried to finish each other off for good, and had ended up in the hospital wing. People started pouring in, complaining about fake injuries or illnesses to try and catch a glimpse of the two— though it was clear they mostly came to get a look at Potter.
“No, but you did something very interesting at the end there, that’s why I pulled you out. You altered the memory. Do you remember doing so?”
“No,” said Draco, closing his book. “Today you’re going to learn how to do my hair yourself.” He pulled Potter into a standing position and marched him across the room. “I won’t be there to fix it when we leave the hospital wing, and who knows if Pansy would offer to do it for you? She’s the only other person who knows how to do it right; she helped me for weeks after that hippogriff broke my arm.”
“Hm?” Draco said, drawn back to himself by the urgency of Potter’s voice. His grey eyes were intense when Draco met them.
“Draw your attention back to the full tree. Imagine that tree aging backward through time: height shrinking, bark smoothing, limbs drawing back into the trunk. Hold the seed in your palm as the roots contract and grow thinner and whiter until they are nearly translucent. Imagine the tree now as a sapling, which bows its head as it joins the root in the seed. Then close the seed and seal it; bury it in the dirt.”
Madam Pomfrey, to her credit, saw through the lies and relocated Draco and Potter to a different, more private room at the back of the hospital wing. Draco was sure it hadn’t existed before then, but he wasn’t about to complain. The only attention he wanted was from Potter, and a space meant for the two of them was the perfect opportunity to get that.
“I would never dream of it!” But something about the way her mouth was twitching made Draco think she was hiding something.
I feel it's important to say that Draco Malfoy is a flawed, and at times, incredibly problematic, character. In this chapter, he doesn't acknowledge or have any real reaction to Dobby's injuries, which is unfortunately true to his canonic depiction. I don't think Draco would have any reason to think Dobby's treatment (which is horrible and completely inhumane) was something to take note of. Certainly, I don't see Draco finding any reason to change the Malfoys' behaviour toward Dobby, either. Draco's lived his whole life with both parents abusing Dobby to the point where it's a totally normal thing, and it's even something Draco does too, in this chapter. Despite this, I do think that hearing how poorly Harry's treated by the Dursleys might eventually help Draco make the connection to the Malfoys' ill treatment of Dobby...but I'm still not really sure about that. The Wizarding World doesn't treat house-elves like humans, so Draco may never make that connection. Still, I don't see Draco having a ton of sympathy for Dobby at this stage in his life. And I know this is a lot, but I did feel it important to talk about. This fic is from his perspective, after all. I don't want his views to be mistaken for mine.
Draco stared at the stone floor. He opened his mouth, but found the words had dissolved before they reached his tongue.
“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids. I have a few — ah — items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call…” said Mr Malfoy, unfurling a piece of parchment with a list of those items for Mr Borgin to see.
This, too, upset Draco. He pulled on his sheets so that Potter’s elbows skidded out from underneath himself. “I guess we’ll have to wait until tomorrow, then,” he said nastily.
At this, Draco snarled. Dobby was nowhere near as cross as he should have been. He shook the elf loose and ran forward, only managing several steps before Dobby lunged forward and grabbed his ankles.
“I never fake anything.” Draco dragged the desk chair in front of their floor-length mirror. “Sit,” he said, pushing Potter onto it and standing behind him. “Look at yourself.”
“Who do you think would keep the lost fingers, though?” said Weasley, who was trying to snip the leaves off one vine without getting snipped himself. “You know, once you’re back to normal? You or Harry?”
Mr Malfoy whirled around and raised his walking cane. The silver snake on top caught the light as he gestured with it, saying, “Watch your tongue. I
Wordlessly, Potter held them out. Draco snatched them up, unfolded them, and held them up in the light, peering warily through the glass.
But it was more complicated than that. It had always been more complicated than that. Even before reading those letters, Draco had felt…connected to Potter, somehow. He couldn’t explain why, but the connection had been there, regardless. His hatred for Potter had never been as straightforward as he liked to say.
The last day of Draco’s holiday break found him and his mother in the drawing room, curled into opposite sides of a very large, very plush, very purple couch. At a glance, they might have appeared comfortable: tucked under blankets and silhouetted against the tall windows, which showcased the soft white landscape outside. Upon further scrutiny, however, one might notice that their teacups were left untouched on the table on front of them, that Draco’s spine was suspiciously straight for someone who had their knees tucked up onto the couch like that, or that there was a murkiness to the room beyond that which the clouds created.
Someone was shaking Draco, muttering something he couldn’t make out for his sleepiness. Slowly, he opened his eyes, and was puzzled to see his mother, framed by darkness, sitting on the edge of his bed.
At the desk, Draco flipped through countless stacks of parchment, looked under a planner, and rifled through his father’s in-tray, again with no luck. The drawers, which did not seem to have false bottoms, contained only inkwells, quills, old calendars, and other useless junk.
“Who says I am?” Malfoy reached up and tousled his own hair, making it even larger and fluffier than normal. He then crossed his arms and looked defiantly up at Harry, who was now standing two feet away.
“Thank you, Draco,” said the Dark Lord in his cold voice. The force of it stirred the back of Draco’s hair weakly. “This has been highly instructive.”
Draco snuck one last look at Granger and Weasley, who glanced back at Potter as they talked with their own families. They clearly cared for him a great deal. Were he anyone else, the scene might have made Draco wonder if he was missing out on Potter’s friendship. But he was Draco Malfoy, thus above such ideas. He took his mother’s hand and they left the station.
“I thought I recognised the green eyes. Was it not obvious when your vision became much clearer? Or when your irises turned grey?”
“Maybe,” she said, brown eyes glinting mischievously. “You know Draco likes to have company, it wouldn't be out of the question.”
Draco toed off his damp slippers and cast a Cleaning Charm on them. Tomorrow, when he went back to Potter’s, he would bring different shoes.
Mr Malfoy, looking thunderous, wrested himself from Hagrid’s grip. “Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you,” he said, depositing it in Ginny’s cauldron. He motioned jerkily for Draco to follow him from the shop.
“Yes,” he said, feeling rather guilty. He should have thought of reaching out to his mother for help, rather than waiting for her to say something. She had already proven, many times over, that she was on his side. “We should do that. How long have you been looking for it?”
After staring into the drawer for what felt like ten whole minutes, Pansy slowly reached in and picked up the photograph. She held it gently in both hands, not saying anything and not turning around. Then she noticed the crease in the picture. She carefully unfolded the right half and, when she uncovered Granger and Weasley, made a small noise in the back of her throat.
Regardless, Draco slowed the motion of the comb through the other boy’s hair. He could allow himself that much. “If you say so, Potter,” he said quietly.
“Yeah,” Potter said softly. When next he spoke, he did so to Draco’s left arm. “I don’t think I can do this now.”
knew that, so why didn’t his father? Draco couldn’t believe the man was willing to risk his own son’s life just to make good on an eleven-year-old promise to the Dark Lord who, his mother had helpfully reminded, was gone. (Although, if Granger had been telling the truth in her letters, the Dark Lord was
For the rest of the day and well into the next, they continued training to be each other— with some degree of success. It was difficult, thinking up all your mannerisms and trying to replicate them when you weren’t in your own body. What was more, the pair oscillated between friendliness and hostility, which was its own mess. But if they had thought it hard to absorb a list of behaviours in the relative safety of their shared room, it was far more difficult to pretend once they’d been released from the hospital wing.
The door of the cabinet opened slightly, as if nudged accidentally from someone inside. There was only one conclusion: someone, or something, was hiding in there. But that didn’t mean it had to be Potter. Draco stepped closer, moving as fast as he dared, pretending to examine various objects as he did so. He smirked as he discreetly reached for his wand; he knew some unpleasant spells, spells for dirty eavesdroppers…
Draco went silent as he did as Professor Snape had asked. His heart was thumping erratically. He understood why this was necessary, but he wished it wasn’t. Really, he wished he could suddenly perform this small bit of magic without having to practice at all— that would make the whole process a lot less distressing. Because Draco
“True. The risk is great,” Professor Snape said solemnly. “It’s up to you, I can’t force you. Though perhaps…” He straightened. Started pacing back and forth in front of his desk. “Instead of my choosing something at random, what if you described something to me beforehand— something you yourself chose? You would have more control over what I see, and the memory would surface on its own, having been pulled forward by your explaining it…
“Okay,” said Potter. He shut the book. “Thank you for being honest with me. It makes for a nice change.”
“High-maintenance prat,” said Potter. He leaned back further into Draco’s touch, eyelids closing halfway.
It seemed to take ages for Potter to find the right page. His hands were shaking somewhat, and Draco wasn’t sure whether to interpret that as nervousness or reluctance to find the words that confirmed what Draco had told him. It took even longer for Potter to skim the passage, and when he finished, he frowned even harder at the bottom of the page.
Draco crossed his ankles under the chair and took a deep breath. “Okay. Okay, I’ll find something else…”
The problem lingered through Herbology— at Draco’s peril. That day, they were dealing with Venomous Tentacula, and thankfully Granger had been watching, or Draco would have lost a few fingers to the grabby plant.
Professor Snape ignored him. “I am more concerned that you let me see so much of the fantasy before trying to break away.”
“I know, I know,” Potter replied, smirking in a way that looked like he was trying to fight it. He sat on the edge of Draco’s bed. “You going to help me fix it, or what?”
“Have you never taken Polyjuice Potion before?” said Draco, feigning boredom to keep the anxiety at bay. “It’d be suspicious to turn into someone else in every way but their voice.”
When Longbottom chuckled into his peas, Draco smirked. So he could get away with mild teasing. Excellent. He filed that knowledge away for later.
“The Ministry wouldn't dare set foot in my house,” said a third, very gravelly voice. “Nor, I’d think, would they in yours.”
Later, when he was safely back in his bedroom, Draco pulled out the newspaper and cut out the whole article. Then he separated Potter’s picture, fully intending to drop it in his bin, but
“Oh, I will,” Potter said, and then he smiled; Draco could have sworn the train station grew brighter for it— one big flash of light that hit Draco like he’d been Stunned. Trust precious
Draco mumbled something incoherently as he stared at the windows of the building. He hadn’t quite heard his father— he was busy looking for Potter, hoping that he hadn’t bought his books already.
“Malfoy,” he heard, and it wasn’t his own voice coming from the other boy anymore. It was Potter’s: gentle and steady and slightly reedy. He withdrew, but Draco could still feel the heat of his body, inches away. “I’d like my glasses back, if you don't mind.”
Little dots of colour appeared along the edges of Draco’s window, slowly expanding until they bloomed, in a squared arch, into close-set bundles of violet flowers— Peruvian heliotrope. Devotion. Draco leaned forward to smell them, getting a vague, though pleasant, vanilla scent. Today, he didn’t mind the flowers. Worrying about the near future made this newest bout of wandless magic seem almost tame.
Reaching into a small drawer in his desk, Draco pulled out the picture of Potter he had taken from the
And thus a competition ensued. The yard was soon filled with the shrill screams of the gnomes as they were lobbed away from the house. The boys goaded each other, laughing and throwing the gnomes further and further with each attempt.
There was an unfamiliar name printed on the first page — T. M. Riddle — but there was nothing else written inside. Not one tiny scribble. Draco flipped through page after page, with each turn growing more reckless, hoping for some sign that someone had at some point used the diary, but the parchment was blank.
But if Draco did that, he would be just as bad as his father— and that was it, wasn’t it? His father
The Malfoys were one of the first families to arrive at King’s Cross. Mrs Malfoy pulled Draco in for a tight hug and kissed the top of his head.
“No?” She looked excited. “Then why are you trying to stop me getting to your desk? Seems my present is in there. If this,” she gestured to his position, “is because you haven’t wrapped it, I don’t mind.”
“You should have seen her, Father. She couldn’t have been more obvious. Practically leaping at him the whole time he was talking with her mother. It’s absurd. I don’t know
The man blinked. “I see. Well. Do your best to avoid Potter during your break. Try not to think about him, too.”
for them to reach the safety of the Gryffindor common room before talking about it; it would have been nice for one of them to commiserate with him. “What are you insinuating, Ron?”
There was a great roar and Ginny’s cauldron hit the floor with a loud clang. Mr Weasley had charged Mr Malfoy, propelling them backward into a shelf; there were more screams as the men fought, Mr Malfoy using the book he had taken from Ginny Weasley first as a shield, then a weapon; other books flew and hit several of the surrounding people; the harried shopkeeper pleaded for the men to stop, to no avail: “Gentlemen, please— please!”
The diary had an unassuming black leather cover, plain but for the year 1943 printed on it in faded golden ink. Draco held it in one hand, testing its weight. It was reasonably light. He turned it over; the back cover had the location from which it had been purchased. Vauxhall Road in London…he didn’t recognise the street name… Maybe it was a Muggle shop. Odd, considering its purpose, its link to Salazar Slytherin, who loathed Muggles…
Professor Snape spoke in his familiar monotone: “Conjure an image of a very tall, very mature tree…”
Crabbe frowned in confusion, and his eyebrows lowered so that they were visible beneath his horrendous bowl haircut. “But…if you don’t want them dead, what do you want?”
Draco made to pick it up, but his mother threw out a hand to stop him. “Wait,” she said, “let me check for curses.” She pointed her wand into the box and made a twisting motion with it. Then, looking satisfied, she spoke again: “It seems safe to handle. Go ahead.”
He started crying again. No matter how many people he fooled into believing otherwise, he could never convince himself, or his magic, that he truly hated Harry Potter. The proof towered over him, signalling its meaning like a flashing beacon. Worst of all, it was nothing new. Draco had tried so hard to pretend he didn’t like Potter — come up with all sorts of small, meaningless reasons to dismiss him — but what had that cost? A wasted year, a wasted summer. Tears. Distrust toward his father. More tears. Magic he couldn’t begin to understand.
. On the parchment, Potter mouthed a couple words before smiling and gesturing to the Dursleys, who were out of frame.
Dobby looked to the floor as if hoping it would inspire the correct phrasing. He fiddled with the sponge. “Dobby had not thought about it, sir.”
Supper at Malfoy Manor took place promptly at seven o’clock after the clang of a bell, which was magically magnified to reach every corner of the grounds, and that evening began no differently. Mr Malfoy discussed his day at the Ministry of Magic, Draco and his mother listened patiently, they ate a three-course meal prepared by Dobby.
, when he had even more on his mind — he went to their library, a gigantic room that rivalled the one at Hogwarts.
Then, on the other, equally unpleasant side, Draco could hardly force Potter to stay home with the Dursleys— not after everything he had learned about them… So what could he do? Or should he do nothing at all?
The shelves and jars and dimness of Professor Snape’s office took shape again. “Did you notice anything that seemed…out of place while you were under the spell?” he asked Draco.
But in the meantime, it was quite fun, pretending to be Malfoy. Pansy had assured Harry that he wouldn’t have to go round insulting everyone all the time, which he had been dreading. No, the only person he had to focus on was Malfoy, and it was all too easy to get him angry.
The force of Pansy’s howling made her lean over; she clutched at the bathroom counter to keep from falling off. “Keep- keep going.”
Hey everyone! This chapter got kinda long, so I've decided to split it into two. Look out for the wrap up about a week from now :)
“Yes, all right.” Harry got up and stood in front of Malfoy, crossing his arms as well. “But you’ve got to turn your back.”
“Why were you thinking about your detention in the Forbidden Forest?” Professor Snape asked, folding his hands.
Professor Snape returned the smile, though it was a more reserved version. It was perhaps the most pleased Draco had ever seen him. “I think you’re ready to move on to what is, possibly, the most important tool of Occlumency: protecting yourself against mental intruders. This also happens to be the most
Pansy scrunched her face and said, “All right, you’re doing it again. You must pay attention when people are talking to you.” She waved a hand dismissively. “Or, at least, pay special attention when
was satisfying. Draco watched with glee as Ginny’s face reddened and Potter turned away, uncomfortable at the prospect of being connected with her.
Draco swallowed dryly. He had a nasty feeling he knew what Professor Snape was suggesting. “What do you mean?” he asked anyway.
“Of course, dear,” said Mrs Malfoy, who was doing the same on her own plate. “How early were you thinking?”
“I don't remember there being a section on the transformations being painful… Of course, I never got many details from that night. Blaise only remembered you leaving, and Potter didn’t want to talk about it… Ah, here we are,” said Pansy, finally landing on the right page.
There was a sort of pressure on the back of Draco’s neck— it was cold, exactly like what Professor Snape had described years ago, back in his office…
It was the first time Draco had seen Potter up close in months— really, truly seen him. Granger’s Stinging Hex had worn off, and it caught Draco off guard because Potter looked rugged, yes, but not the
He hated Potter. He hated him, of course he did. Draco had decided so, and that, he supposed, made it real enough.
Mr Malfoy sniffed loftily. “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam.”
Draco tugged Dobby forward to get a better look, but even on his toes he couldn’t see into Potter’s room. “Take me up there,” he said.
Draco sighed shakily. Perhaps it was no mere eyelash, but a scratch to the cornea. That might better explain why exposing his eye to the air made it worse.
Dobby lowered his head. “Sir, Mistress had Dobby try the same thing many times— it has not worked any time Dobby has tried.”
“You may not like it, sir,” said Dobby, startling Draco, who had quite forgotten he was there, “but Harry Potter will do better here. They is not the Dursleys.”
The “Trip Jix, Potter!” quote comes from book 5, pp. 609 (chapter 27, “The Centaur and the Sneak”); the Witch Weekly excerpt is from book 4, pp. 511-512 (chapter 27, “Padfoot Returns”); the McGonagall quote from the Yule Ball is from book 4, pp. 413 (chapter 23, “The Yule Ball”); the dementors quote is from book 3, pp. 159 (chapter 8, “Flight of the Fat Lady”); and the quotes from the final section are from book 7, pp. 458-459 and 474 (chapter 23, “Malfoy Manor”).
“No,” Draco replied, blinking as he refocussed, “but it was different… I was definitely more aware of the textures of things this time, so that must be good, right?”
Draco turned to look at her. Pansy’s hand was beneath her head and her straight-across bangs had fallen to one side; her brown eyes were kind, but Draco couldn’t find the words to tell her anything. He rolled his head so he was facing the ceiling. In the corner of his vision, he saw Pansy do the same.
don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home,” Potter continued in a low voice, gesturing at the Muggles behind him, “I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer.”
. His skin was very wrinkly even though he was fairly young, and he stood only about two feet tall, which made his overly large eyes and ears even more prominent. He was, as usual, dressed in a dingy pillowcase.
He swiped his fingers into the clear blue liquid, rubbed them against his opposite hand in a circular motion, and pulled the product a couple times through Potter’s blonde hair, making sure to spread it evenly. “See? It’s already starting to look better. All that’s left is to comb it out, and that part’s easy. The potion and my haircut will do most of the work, so luckily for you, you don’t have to be very creative.”
“Well come on, then.” Pansy seized his arm and dragged him through the manor. Outside, they navigated the maze of low hedges separating the back gardens, passing the large peafowl aviary, which was empty. Dobby had released them all earlier that morning and they now roamed the gardens, the white of their feathers brilliant against the colourful blooms.
“And I would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of Harry Potter,” continued Mr Malfoy, “not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear— ah, Mr Borgin.”
Dobby reached forward as if to touch Draco’s hands, but then remembered his place. “As…unpleasant as it is to leave Harry Potter there, we must. It is for his own good.”
It terrified Draco that he knew so little of his father’s plan. His parents had been fighting over the Chamber of Secrets since the thirty-first of July, and Draco hadn’t felt comfortable voicing his own opinions— he feared his father might set the monster on him, too, for being…insubordinate. It certainly didn’t feel too out of character these days.
“Yes,” Draco said, feeling very drained. He ducked his head; the desktop shook beneath his forming tears. He didn’t want to cry; he didn't want to look weak.
look skinnier. Draco recoiled when he saw it. Everything about Potter was sharp. Too in focus, too…there. His edges punctured the space around him. Draco was going to murder those Dursleys, he really was.
There will sometimes be dialogue taken directly from the books, like in this chapter, so where relevant, see the end notes for my shitty citations
It seemed to take forever for her to do something, like she was moving through water. Draco’s heart thumped quickly. He couldn’t decide whether he wanted his eyes to be open or closed when Pansy saw who was in the picture.
The next morning, Draco woke with his hand shut in a particularly heavy book and his head resting on a surprisingly soft one. He opened the one with his hand in, suspecting that that page might be important, and shook out his arm to get some of the feeling back. Last night, he had spent more time finding information than sorting through it, and now had a massive collection of books and newspapers in front of him, so large that it took several tables to support their weight. Thinking about going through them all was impossibly daunting, but it was much less so now that he had narrowed it down to those stacks.
“Not much,” Draco admitted, “Everything I’ve found is mostly speculation. No one seems to agree on what the creature is, if the chamber exists, where it might be, how to open it— the only thing most writers can agree on is that we know too little about the Chamber itself.”
“It was of a different quality than the others, did you notice? Fantasies make a point to set themselves apart; in your case, they appear brighter. Almost…shiny, and especially where Potter is standing. You’ve put him in an almost saintly light—”
“That’s going to be difficult, sir. Potter and I hate each other,” Draco said, “so it’ll be very hard to think of something like that. We both spend a lot of time thinking about each other.”
With an effortless sweeping arpeggio, Draco quickened his pace, and the ballade turned loud and rich and anxious— a byproduct of shifting to D sharp minor. The parchment dutifully recorded the rapidly-descending notes, ink flying neatly from an old pot to form the notation of the music.
When Pansy shook her head, Crabbe said, “Millicent? Er…Daphne. No, Professor Sprout. Celestina Warbeck!”
“On the contrary.” Professor Snape sat on his desk, knees about a foot from Draco’s. His usually-severe face softened a tick. “Occlumency is not only about preventing others from entering your mind, it is more often about protecting things you do not wish them to see. I did not pry very deeply into your memories, yet nothing incriminating pushed itself to the surface. I would call that successful, and besides, are we not here to practice?”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered. Pansy said nothing in response, but when Draco reached for her hand, she gave it a reassuring squeeze.
But was he ready to go back in yet? The memory of last time was very fresh… Draco swayed where he stood in the entry, and braced a hand against the doorframe. Tears threatened behind his blinking eyes.
“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” Draco replied nastily. “I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for that lot.”
So it was. There were suddenly students in the corridor, and through the window steam billowed, obscuring everything but the slightest hint of brick. After what had seemed like mere minutes to Draco, they had arrived at platform nine and three-quarters.
It soon became clear that Harry Potter was not worshipped at home as he was by his friends and the Wizarding world. According to Dobby, Potter’s books and school things had been locked away in a cupboard, so he couldn’t do his homework or ride his broom; his owl, Hedwig, had been shut in her small cage, unable to exercise; Potter had hours worth of chores to do every day, while his cousin Dudley wasted his in front of what Dobby had called a “hellovision;” and Dudley beat Potter regularly, too, something the Dursleys never commented on or stopped. The discovery was—
What was that supposed to mean? Had they guessed Draco was behind the stolen letters? Had Dobby said something he shouldn’t have?
Draco’s eyes dropped. His head jerked up and down. His chest suddenly felt too small for his beating heart, and his lungs too small for the air he wanted to pull into them; he pushed back from Professor Snape, who was standing too close, and his breaths came shallower and quicker…
“There’s something else I’d like, actually,” said Draco. “The diary Father was hiding all summer— I’d like to know if it’s on the train. Summon it for me, won’t you?”
Crabbe blinked back at him, then did something completely unexpected: he pulled out his wand, cleared his throat, and said, “
Potter’s mouth, which was a great deal redder than it had been before, dropped open. “Right. That’s smart. Erm, but…what’ll we tell Madam Pomfrey about how we changed back?”
“Make sure to grab it before we leave. You and I will be stopping by Borgin and Burkes today. I have some items I should like to be rid of,” said Mr Malfoy with a pointed look toward the drawing room, “and we have not given Borgin our business in several months.”
Weasley bent forward, putting his hands on his knees. “Don’t you get it?” he said quietly. “He’s doing what you do to
But Draco never got his chance to say it. Potter had barely crossed into the train station when, before Draco could open his mouth, a young girl’s voice stole through the noise.
She hit him waggishly. “No, you weren’t supposed to say that. You were supposed to say—” she put on a high, squeaky voice— “
“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr Borgin as he hobbled over. “Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.”
Draco stuck a hand out to push Potter’s arm, but at the last second decided against it. “Er, actually… Blaise? I think you’d better do this.”
“Are you saying that, for my mind to be fully protected, I have to drop all my instincts to protect them?”
hadn’t been a part of the rumours going around during end of term, only that Potter had ended up in the Hospital Wing after his adventure in the third-floor corridor. Draco hoped Potter had fainted, or tripped, or done something equally as embarrassing.
The Ministry of Magic definitely, Definitely know about Harry's mistreatment. If they know which bedroom he sleeps in, they know more about his situation, yet they do nothing to help him. Probably because Dumbledore warned them off doing so, but still. This is nothing super new; we all know the Ministry is incompetent. Draco doesn't, though; he has no reason to mistrust them.
themselves. It was entirely possible he and Malfoy were some amalgamation of each other, rather than what they appeared to be.
Unfortunately for both of them, things didn’t happen quite like Draco had been expecting. Rather than falling to the floor, Potter fell to his knees. In the process, their bare forearms touched and the scraping sensation immediately dulled to mild discomfort. Their ribs started meshing back together, and within a matter of seconds, the rest of their bodies decided to start changing as well.
Thankfully, none of the portraits said anything as he made his stuttering walk past, but regardless, Draco waited until he was on the second floor to start running, and didn’t stop until he reached his bedroom on the third.
The morning of the thirty-first of July, Draco woke with the knowledge that it was Harry Potter’s birthday. He lay in bed a good long while, staring at the constellations on his ceiling, trying to convince himself it was an absolutely
But that was starting to sound a bit too much like obsession. Draco decided to stop thinking now, or he would sit there for hours trying to puzzle it out. Potter was Daedalus, constructing an inescapable labyrinth that continued to grow and twist beyond his knowledge, trapping Draco — the Minotaur, too beastly to work through the cycles of illogic — at the centre.
“Hmph,” Draco said, not wanting to admit Potter was right. “Regardless, if you’d given me more warning, I could have used this again—” he took Potter’s invisibility cloak out and gestured with it— “which might have avoided the whole issue. I assume this is what you were really asking for?”
Draco stood. “Okay, sir,” he said, and for the first time since their meetings had begun, left Professor Snape’s office feeling confident in his abilities.
There was someone else there in the memory now, Draco could feel it. But it wasn’t like they had appeared from out of nowhere, more like they had always been there, and Draco was only now able to detect them…
“Don’t,” said Draco, tiredness washing over him. He had regretted the words as soon as he’d spoken them. “I’ve changed my mind, I need— Potter needs to know. About the Chamber. About what’s coming. He needs to be given the choice. I don’t think Hogwarts would be safe for him either, but I can’t force him to stay home, I don’t have that kind of power…” Draco squared his shoulders. “Go to him, tell him what you’ve told me. Try and convince him to stay home, for what little good that might do.”
Or something to that effect. I’ll just leave, shall I, and we’ll try this again.” She stepped backward. “All right. Close the door.”
As if he needed another reminder of what was coming. Of his failures. Draco had only wanted to leave early so he could see Potter arrive at the station— so there’d be something
Granger and Weasley’s smiles were tight as they waved him off. They were probably sad they couldn’t see him every day over the break, like they had at Hogwarts. So needy.
“Quickest way to make this less confusing is to get it over with,” said Draco, trying not to sound excited at what Potter had confirmed. “Psychological implications aside.”
When the front door opened, he hid behind some hedges and tried to peer through them. The leaves were too crowded for that though, and Draco decided to at least move closer, even if he couldn’t find a clear patch.
“Draco likes an audience. I suppose he feels lonely when we’re not around. Mind you, he hasn't ever said so, that's me speculating.”
This lack of control was terrifying. What if he grew flowers that told his parents exactly how he felt about Potter? Or what if Potter saw them? What if there was another tree? Flowers he could hide, but a tree?
“Right!” Draco said, jerking backward. “Merlin, Potter, you need to work on your framing— that’s not nothing! How am I going to—?” He cursed and wiped a hand over his face.
“Is it?” said Malfoy. He threw his sheets aside and stepped out of bed. He crossed his arms and stared expectantly at Harry. “Up.”
“Do not think that you can rely on reputation alone to spare you, Avery,” said Mr Malfoy cooly, “the Ministry have proven to be as persistent as they are meddlesome, and it would be wise not to take any risks, not now… You will recall the information I disclosed at our last meeting…”
It was only then that Draco finally let himself ask a very important question: what use could a blank diary be in opening the Chamber of Secrets?
“Excellent. Listen very carefully. You are to Apparate to his home every day when the post is delivered. Collect anything he might get, whether they’re parcels or letters, and give them to
But then the optic nerve found its tether. The pain vanished. Draco could open his eye. The sight he was met with in the mirror made him dizzily grab the sink. His left iris was now a brilliant green, and half of his vision was incredibly poor.
“Oh,” Draco said. “Yes, I am. Er… Good night, then, Professor.” He stood slowly, and shoved his wand into his pocket.
, you know. And I figured it out on my own. Thanks, by the way,” she said to Granger and Weasley. “But that’s not the point. I came over to tell you: Quidditch tryouts start this weekend, traditionally, and as Harry’s the captain—”
“Salazar,” Draco muttered to himself, wiping a hand across his forehead. He couldn’t afford to have another dream like that. It made him think things, things he desperately hoped were wrong.
Draco swallowed around what felt like a giant bat in the back of his throat. “There’s been a change of plan,” he said, surprised when his voice came out sounding steady and strong. “I want Potter to be able to make the decision whether or not to go back to Hogwarts. I want him to be informed. Merlin, I must be out of my mind, I know what he’s going to choose… Has Father told you about the Chamber of Secrets yet?”
“He sways his hips a bit when he walks. Slower, Potter,” Pansy commented, watching Harry as he shuffled awkwardly across the stone floor. “Try it again, but focus on where you’re putting your weight. Here.”
Each morning for the next three days, Dobby took Draco to Potter’s house. Each morning, without fail, Draco would stand on the Dursley’s neatly trimmed front lawn, hoping to catch a glimpse of Potter. But he was always disappointed. Potter never once came to the window. And it was difficult, being so close to Potter without Draco feeling like he could do anything to help. Draco hoped the Ministry would handle it the way he thought they would; surely they must know what was going on.
“I’d rather not say,” said Draco, watching her cut off another leaf to keep his gaze from wandering to Potter again.
“Suspicions confirmed. Honestly, Potter, a little hair potion, like this one” — Draco grabbed a jar off the desk — “could tame even Granger’s tangle. But you don’t want to use too much. Only two fingers’ worth of product, or it’ll look greasy.”
“Yes, but—” Still, Draco did not look at Professor Snape; his breathing continued to quicken, and now his head was feeling light… “I tried so hard to- to hide it.”
“Well, well, well,” said Mr Malfoy, coming from nowhere and putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Arthur Weasley.”
going to have to get comfortable screaming across courtyards, draping yourself dramatically over things, and being both self-absorbed and completely taken in by everything Draco does.”
There were several other similar attempts with similar results before Professor Snape insisted that Draco let him poke around in his mind, choose different memories than the ones Draco had been showing him. Draco didn’t think he could say no anymore, not if they were really going to make progress. At the rate they were going, Professor Snape would probably see entire years of Draco’s life before Draco managed to produce a good defense.
Harry continued to saunter toward him. “You need a good example of what to do— I could help you, you know. If you were interested.”
He rushed to the adjoining bathroom and squinted in the light, waiting in greater and greater agony as he slowly got used to the brightness. But even as the light became less harsh, Draco found he could not open his left eye completely. He bent forward, pulling his eyelashes upward to inspect for one that had fallen in, but the pain seared hotter every time he attempted it.
“Comes with the territory,” said Harry gesturing to his body. “If you hadn’t noticed, Malfoy’s very dramatic.”
The morning of the Malfoys’ trip to Diagon Alley dawned slowly. Draco, having long decided that sleep was going to elude him once again, had spent most of the night stretched out on his window seat, pouring over more books. As the sun started to peek over the tall hedges surrounding the back gardens, Draco stopped reading, fixing his gaze on the brightening sky to see if that alone could make morning come quicker.
Mr Malfoy wrinkled his nose. “In that case, perhaps we can return to my list. I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today…”
Professor Snape nodded sagely. “Your protective instincts are strong, as we have established. And you’ve already understood how to distract from memories you do not wish intruders to see— despite what you may believe, that is a fairly advanced skill. With a little more grace, you will have mastered that one aspect of Occlumency. So what we must do is give those distractions more…purpose, more conscious thought.”
“Oh…” Draco’s heart thudded heavily. “Maybe he’s putting it back now,” he said, not really believing it.
Draco’s green eyes found the ceiling. “Of course I do. I’m sure I speak for the both of us when I say I’m very eager to get back into my own body, but short of repeating myself again, I’ll just ask: are you, or are you not, ready to turn back into yourself?”
Shaking his head, Draco pulled up the gillyflowers by their roots, choosing to ignore the warped wood of his desk. He burnt the flowers to ashes with a flick of his wand and a hissed “
you control your friends, Potter?” Malfoy interjected. “They’re bickering like they've been married for years.”
,” said Pansy, poking Harry’s chest with a finger. “Draco’s always going on and on about Harry Potter. ‘Can you believe what
“Blast it.” Draco ran a hand over his forehead, pushing back hair of unfamiliar thickness and colour. It sprang back into his eyes for the millionth time that night.
would benefit from running around, fearing for his life as his peers are hunted for- for sport, then on that I have to disagree. Nothing, not even the promise of achieving a higher purpose, excuses the immorality of the acts that get you there.”
“I think that’s enough for the night,” said Professor Snape. He set his wand down on his desk. “Take a week off; practice clearing your mind. You were thinking of other things when you came here tonight, and now you know the danger that presents. When you have mastered Occlumency, those changes in mood will be less of a problem, but in the early stages, they interrupt your focus.
“So…” Pansy nudged Draco’s shoulder with her own. The devilish smile she gave him made him worry what she was going to say next. “Does that mean you’re hoping to…
“I have no doubt,” said Professor Snape, eyes briefly landing on the ceiling. “So then you must settle for a moment in your life from before you met Potter. You were, what, eleven, when you first met him? That’s most of your life, you should be able to find
I've got a headcanon where Pansy is Draco's best friend, but Harry & Co. don't see much of that relationship; they only really notice Crabbe and Goyle because they're big and threatening and Always There. But who says you've only got to be friends with your goons?
“He’s always angry about something or another,” Mrs Malfoy said, leaning back into her side of the couch. “And I think it would be a rather large oversight to leave your mind open, to let the Dark Lord see what you think about… Or
“No.” She glanced backward into the common room. “Come in, everyone else is—” she yawned— “asleep. Where is this coming from? You seem really desperate all of a sudden.”
“Not really. I just happen to be very gifted at logic.” Granger gave him a small smile. She turned back to the plant between them and flawlessly cut off one of the leaves. Scooping it into their container, she said, “Now that you know what to do, what are you waiting for?”
Granger blinked. “Of course. Erm, why don’t you let me read it, and I’ll tell you if I think it’s missing anything.” In a lower voice, she added, “I do that all the time for Harry.”
As always, I claim no ownership of these characters. If y’all want to translate this, you’re welcome to it! I just ask that you let me know and credit me as the original writer. Fanart is also appreciated if anyone's feeling creative.
Ron bent close. “Blimey, you look just like him,” he said, looking at Harry like he was something he had stepped in.
“I would like to try again, if you’re comfortable. I want to see if the same happens this time, applying the same pressure as before.”
Last chapter for this section, y'all! Not sure when I'll be happy with the next one, but I've only written about half the next chapter so far, so we'll see. Also not sure if the next time I post something will be when I've finished rewriting the rest of the book. Depends on whether I feel there's a natural break in my writing.
Obviously. Potter wasn’t a complete nitwit, however good his impression of one was. Why Weasley had even bothered to keep those useless words in his letter escaped Draco.
“Right,” said Draco, feeling a lot better now that things seemed more normal between them. “We have to find the diary — someone at school will have it, I’m sure — and then we’ve got to destroy it.”
“He does,” said Pansy, turning to examine herself in the mirror. She ruffled her dark bangs and then spread them more evenly across her forehead.
Unaware that red catchflies had begun sneaking up through the floorboards behind him, Draco pulled out the picture of Potter he had taken from the
She took off her black shoes and turned so Harry was looking at her from the side. “Wait longer than you think you need to bring your feet down,” she said, lowering her right heel on an angle to the floor. Then she repeated the action with her other foot, keeping a wide stance. “That’ll lengthen your stride and make it look more like you’re gliding.”
It was nice, being that much taller than Malfoy for a change. Granted, it was only about a two-inch height difference, but that, combined with Pansy’s Draco Malfoy lessons, gave Harry a strange sort of confidence. It made him less concerned about the stares he and Malfoy were getting from this exchange.
“I think I want to leave for King’s Cross early today, if that’s all right,” said Draco on the first of September. He was in the process of melting a pat of butter into his waffles.
“Tut tut. I never said anything about betraying him, darling, only that Draco’s a little… Let’s say…blind sometimes, especially when it comes to his personality. I can be a bit more objective. If, of course, you’re at all interested in portraying him accurately. We can’t have another veal incident; Nott was definitely suspicious.”
“What,” Draco wheezed around a perceivable lump in his voice box, “were you thinking?” He pushed Potter off of him.
“Focus, Draco,” said Professor Snape, backing away further, his arms raised as if to steady Draco even across that distance.
“Break it up there, gents, break it up—” came a new voice. Plowing through the crowd came Hagrid, who pulled the two men apart as easily as if they were children.
save the picture after all, if only to remind himself exactly how much he despised the Gryffindor git.
Draco lowered his voice. “In the— Well, I guess not really in the flesh, but yes. Get up, I have something to tell you.”
“All Dobby knows is that horrible, terrible things are going to happen at Hogwarts next year, and if Dobby gets an opinion, sir, he doesn’t think…some students — important students — should go there, not if the Chamber of Secrets is going to reopen…”
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips. “Hmm. Well, we’ll do another examination, make sure nothing’s wrong with your insides.”
Draco’s eyes fell shut. He relaxed his wrists as he slowed the tempo. Some ascending octave fingering brought the piece to a warmer, higher place as he transitioned from G minor to A major.
Draco thought about this for a moment. “Touch,” he said, recalling Professor Snape’s description of his signal.
“I thought so,” said Professor Snape. He folded his hands behind his back. “I did not experience any pushback on your part. But no matter, this was only our first attempt. Let’s try again. This time, I want you to concentrate on only one of your senses and we’ll see where that leads. I’ll let you pick.”
Draco didn’t know if he had the strength to open one more of those letters. He knew what they were going to say. He had always thought Potter chose his friends because they worshipped him like everyone else did, but after reading their letters, Draco knew that wasn’t true. Yes, maybe they were desperate for Potter to respond, but that didn’t come from a place of inferiority— rather, it was from concern, something Draco now shared.
The boy sighed and then dramatically flung his sheets aside. “Both of you, utterly useless. What would you have done if I hadn’t been awake?”
Draco shut his eyes. He swatted at Potter, wordlessly trying to get the boy to go back to his own bed before the same thing happened to him, too. He knew that he wouldn’t want to feel his ribs rearrange themselves while he was left stranded on the cold stone floor.
Before Draco could say anything in his defence, Madam Pomfrey said, “I’ll ask you not to assume anything about my patients, Weasley. Malfoy and Potter are both suffering, and I kindly ask you to leave so that I may deal with them.” She started moving toward him, flapping her hands to shoo him from the bed. “Goodness knows I’ve let you stay much longer than I’d have liked already. Good night.” With that, she ushered him the last couple steps toward the corridor.
Draco scowled at the short letter and slapped it on top of Granger’s, which he'd left on the far corner of his desk. Forget what he had thought before, if he was going to learn anything useful about Potter, he needed to go directly to the source. He could easily make Dobby do it, since the elf was already Apparating back and forth to steal Potter’s post…so why not also have him also report what Potter was up to? What harm could possibly come of that?
Potter blinked in confusion, but did as she said. He started flattening his blonde hair, which had gotten somewhat wavy as he’d slept. Draco took a moment to appreciate the action, which seemed to be automatic. “Where are we going?” Potter said.
All the same, he was having a hard time figuring out which monster would be released on his classmates next September. He read countless anthologies and made a list of the most dangerous magical creatures, but without more information — more evidence — the monster could be anything on his list, or even none at all. It was possible that whatever lurked in the Chamber of Secrets was something no one had studied before. The monster was likely very old, as well — it was placed in the Chamber in the tenth century —  but then what had it been eating? Or did it not have to eat? Did it hibernate until it was called? Could it, perhaps, reproduce on its own, or did it live with other monsters, creating offspring through some means? Was it possible there were thousands of monsters in the Chamber?
“Oh, I didn’t.” Blaise glanced up again, touching the tip of his quill to his lips. “But ‘you’ came back from the hospital wing as a different person, and ‘Potter’ was acting suspiciously a lot like you; it wasn’t terribly difficult to figure out.”
And because I stole some direct dialogue in the Forbidden Forest from the books, see pp. 248-259 in Sorcerer’s Stone. Or, if your book is different from mine, the end of chapter 15, “The Forbidden Forest.”
“Okay,” Draco heard himself say, somewhat distantly. He was disappointed, yes, but not surprised. Potter hadn’t exactly been enthusiastic at the news. “I wasn’t really expecting… Of course. We should both take some time and um, think it over…”
bad. However much he wanted to believe in the virtue of his father’s plan, Draco knew it was wrong. If Draco said nothing, did nothing, he would be bad too.
Malfoy, who was already sitting up in bed, also seemed to have noticed the issue. He waved an overlong green sleeve at Harry, saying, “Take off your clothes.”
Draco allowed the fantasy for a few blissful moments before the tension came back with full force. D sharp minor. Draco slammed his hands down, the music swelling in time with the pain in his heart. This was a fantasy for a reason, he could never tell Potter any of that. Potter could never know how Draco felt, or what he’d done, or why.
“Largely, you did: you managed to produce two good distractions at the end there before they led back to Potter. That might have been the most I could ask of you tonight, considering our conversations have, as you said, revolved around him quite a bit. Regardless, I would say that was a decent effort on your part,” said Professor Snape.
true, anyway, which made his hands feel heavier, his mind work slower. As Draco fought against his listless body, words pulsed over and over through his head like a heartbeat:
Potter must have finally stepped off the train. Draco twisted to get a glimpse of him, but there was too much steam and the guard was waving him through the gateway, so he was forced to walk forward. In the train station, he leapt behind a nearby column and started planning what he was going to say to Potter. Something snide, with a bit of bite. Something that would make Potter think about him all through the summer.
Goyle slapped his knees. “Okay. We can do that.” He glanced between Draco and Pansy. “How do we do that?”
“It’s difficult, sir,” Draco replied. He pushed his blonde bangs to the side again, off his forehead.
So they did. But several meetings passed without much headway. Professor Snape was determined it was his fault— that his teaching methods were the reason Draco hadn’t been successful yet.
“Fine.” Professor Snape rolled his shoulders and pointed his wand at Draco once more. “Let’s try again. Keep a lookout for anything that seems out of place…”
oblivious. These searches will be conducted in homes whose owners are, or have been, suspicious. As one or both of those apply to our majority, I would advise extreme caution, and either concealing very well your illicit items or getting rid of them entirely.”
“Don’t panic! Give me two seconds,” said Potter, and he brushed past Draco to go into the dormitory, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts. He had been stupid not to consider how long their conversation might take. Yes, it had been very early when he left Gryffindor Tower, but it was rapidly becoming not-early, and there could be any number of people downstairs.
“I don’t know what that means,” Draco said sharply, but still, he situated the frames on his nose. He could now see perfectly, save for a blurry halo where the glass stopped.
Dobby nodded and opened his mouth to talk, but Draco made a silencing gesture. “Do not, under any circumstances, tell him anything. If he sees you, make him believe that you were just a figment of his imagination. And if you’re called by my parents while you’re away, only come back
Sensing that the rabbit hole was not very far ahead of him, Draco tried to push thoughts of Potter deep, deep down. He had a whole metaphorical tree set aside for Potter, and it was tremendous; it took a great deal more energy to imagine forcing
“Then we will use that for future practice. You’ve done well. As we move forward, keep this…shadow in mind. Try to look for it, and recognise it for what it represents— someone that does not belong.”
“No, sir,” said Dobby, and with a loud snap, all traces of flora were gone. The floorboards had righted themselves, too. “Dobby will tell no one, if that is what you wish.”
“Draco,” his mother called. She stood in front of the desk, tired but grinning, and motioned for Draco to join her. “There’s something here.”
“No, and I’d argue I don’t ‘deserve’ anything. I won, fair and square. Unless,” Potter said, “there’s something you’d like to tell me?”
She stamped on his foot. “Do It,” she said, then smiled thinly at Theodore Nott, who had glanced over.
“I’d call that mildly successful,” Draco said cheerfully, to no one in particular. Next to him, Pansy giggled.
—?” He withdrew, crowding himself against the window. The English countryside blurred as they whipped past it.
“Yes,” Professor Snape said, seeming to retreat into himself somewhat. He spoke carefully; Draco could see him choosing each word. “As you’ve said, you are still unaware that someone is in your mind with you. I have been wondering if this is because you have not been sufficiently motivated. To do that, there are threads I could pull— things that you have cloaked in shame, things you have not yet shown me.”
Draco ignored them and drew the invisibility cloak over the rest of himself, hiding his body entirely from view. He could still see his knees and legs and arms under the fabric, which was a relief, as he wasn’t sure how he’d be able to navigate quietly if he didn’t know where his body ended. Potter was right though, his shoes and ankles were visible where they peeked out from under the cloak.
have no say in how they behave — they can’t help it, it’s in their blood — but for a pureblooded wizard to act like that…what shame he brings upon the Wizarding world. On us, even.”
in Potter the reason you haven’t been able to get him expelled? Were you actually trying, or were you putting on a show?”
Draco couldn’t explain his fascination with Potter. And it was, he decided, a fascination, and nothing else. “Fascination” had none of the romance that “interest” or “appeal” or “obsession” did. “Fascination” simply was. As in, it was fascinating that Potter had so quickly grown attached to Weasley on this very train; that Potter could be so bad at Potions when his mother’s talent had been equal to Snape’s; that he was so skilled at flying when he couldn’t have had any practice. As in, it was fascinating how much time Draco could waste thinking about how fascinating Potter was.
“You two shouldn’t be in here,” Madam Pomfrey scolded, and tried to shoo the pair out. “The privacy of my patients—”
Just like that, Draco forgot his anger. His hand loosened on his spoon. “Did you get snapdragons? Tell me you got snapdragons.”
The Forbidden Forest memory bits came from a different work I decided not to complete a while back— it’s from Draco’s perspective, exploring what might’ve happened if he stayed with Harry when Quirrelmort rushed them, with some Drarry stuff. If anyone’s interested in reading that, I can polish it up and post it— it’ll repeat lines from the books (more than this one does) and have a couple of the same scenes I put in here. Let me know if that’s something y’all would enjoy reading.
“I guess,” he said finally, even though he didn’t like this any more now than he had in the past. There was a difference between what Professor Snape had already seen and that which Draco hadn’t allowed him to. A very big, very troubling difference.
“Yes, my birthday!” Pansy’s arms uncrossed so quickly that they made a slapping sound as they connected with her knees. “How lovely that you finally remembered. An entire day late.”
Draco’s heart stopped. Was it possible Pansy knew something of what happened? She had a strange expression on her face… But how could she possibly know anything? They hadn’t spoken in weeks.
“Yes. We’ll see if it stops there. Your glasses?" Draco demanded, holding out a hand for them. “I refuse to spend another moment squinting. It’s undignified.”
“When you are successful, and it seems we are getting much closer to that, you will no longer have to share these thoughts with anyone else,” Professor Snape assured him. He knelt before Draco. “They will be yours alone.”
Mrs Malfoy’s blue eyes were calm. “I think the Dark Lord is very hard to please, and Harry Potter is a stubborn boy. It will be very difficult to get what He wants from Potter.”
“Not,” said Mr Malfoy, “when it serves to be a distraction and general annoyance to those of us trying to hold a conversation.”
“Master Draco,” said Dobby. Draco glanced up to see him gesturing at the door, which hung crookedly on its hinges. Draco stepped closer. Someone had carved a square hole into the wood, and installed a cat flap over it. The Dursleys didn't have a cat. They didn't like animals. There was also a lock affixed to the wrong side of the door, and by the handle, the wood had warped in several places, like it had been shouldered open. It was impossible to tell if those were the marks of the Dursleys trying to keep Potter from escaping, or someone breaking Potter out. Either way, Potter had been trapped in here, and now he was gone.
Tonight was not one of those nights. Tonight, Draco took no comfort in the painted constellations. Tonight, he only saw them as a reminder of the pressures of his future. Someday, he would have to marry a pureblooded woman— a match determined (or approved) by their parents. He could change this no more than he could the path of the stars or turn of the earth. Already, the Malfoys were looking at candidates. A current favourite was Astoria Greengrass, who was about a year younger than Draco and starting Hogwarts in September— something Mr Malfoy had brought up to him. He had encouraged Draco to “Get to know her. Well.” At the time, it had seemed less like a threat. Now, after his latest dream, Draco was sure it had been one.
“Hmm?” Dobby was gesturing to several clusters of black petunias that had sprouted without Draco’s notice. “Good heavens,” said Draco. “Yes, you’d better. Er…you haven’t told anyone about these little…episodes, have you?”
“I DON’T WANT TO FOCUS!” Draco said, standing. He swayed on his feet, then bent over, taking in one great, shuddering breath.
“Stop,” Harry said, cutting him off. “I know what you’re doing, and just…stop it. I’m already uncomfortable enough as it is, I don’t need you trying to make me feel worse.”
“Well, I could hardly do it myself.” Draco sniffed, then scowled at how pathetic it made him sound. “How d’you suppose that would go? He hates me, thinks I hate him. He wouldn’t take me seriously, he’d go back to spite me… The Dursleys are by no means a fair trade-off, but if it’s to avoid being killed?”
Dobby nodded. After a whirl of disorientation, they were standing in Potter’s empty bedroom. The novelty of the idea was lost on Draco, though. He was more concerned by the sheer mess of the tiny room. The bed was unmade, sheets rumpled and touching the floor; an empty inkwell lay cracked on the carpet; and the calendar fixed to the wall was crooked. The clothes were gone from the closet, Potter’s pillow was missing, and several of the drawers Draco opened were empty. Whatever had happened, Potter had left in a hurry. But had he gone willingly?
Draco grabbed Potter’s arm and strode over to the far side of the bathroom. This, strangely, made Potter laugh even harder— No, now it was more like he was giggling…
She smiled warmly at him. “You’re a good son. But don’t worry about me. There is nothing in my mind the Dark Lord would be interested in, and nothing would hurt me or your father more than the Dark Lord targeting you, should He be provoked.”
“Sure,” Potter allowed, “but everyone’ll suspect something’s wrong when they see me like that.” He nodded at Draco’s reflection, whose hair had been styled into an ‘artfully messy’ look rather than a plain ‘messy’ one. Draco had been rather pleased with it up until that point.
“I was also,” his father added, “planning to go to Quality Quidditch Supplies. You’ll remember that second years are allowed to try out for their House’s Quidditch team…”
“Why? Are you scared, Malfoy?” Potter’s words were mocking, but his voice was thinner than usual. Higher.
“And, I might add, you have no right to tell me how to insult you. You’re even worse at that than you are at flying.”
“Shall we get started, then?” said Lockhart, to the sound of cheers and applause. He chuckled. “All right.”
She raced to the desk and Draco chased her, reaching from behind to close every drawer she opened, hoping against hope she wouldn’t find the—
“You see, Draco, the things blood traitors resort to so that they can alleviate their tempers…” said Mr Malfoy as he stalked toward the Leaky Cauldron. To keep up with him, Draco followed at a near run.
“…and of course,” Pansy was saying, “I know you didn’t mean to ignore me the whole time, but conversation doesn’t flow as easily with Crabbe and Goyle when you don’t say anything. I don’t know how you talk to them, the thick sods…” to which Draco nodded absently.
Mr Malfoy cleared his throat. “I have asked Dobby to prepare a three-course meal from the country to which we will be travelling on holiday. If said country is not already obvious, it will be by course number two. Eat,” he said, gesturing stiffly to their plates.
“I love you too, Mother,” Draco said, squeezing her hands before heading for the train. He didn’t look at his father.
Draco whirled around to see Potter some ways back, pushing his way through the mob of students. After motioning to Weasley to continue on without him, Draco yelled back, “What is it
Draco ran to his desk and tore through the top drawer. He pulled out Potter’s letters and started rifling through them madly. When he found the one he wanted, he ripped it open and skimmed, his finger trailing along after his eyes. “‘Also, I’m considering kidnapping you. Just so you aren’t surprised if I show up.'
Draco faltered, and the distance between his feet and his father’s grew. “But if there are bad purebloods, doesn’t that mean there can be good Mudbloods?”
“A wise choice.” Professor Snape lifted his wand. When he spoke again, he used his familiar monotone voice, the one he put on to help Draco focus. “Close your eyes and imagine your tree, stretching upward and outward in a beautiful mass of branches and limbs. Place your hand on its wide trunk; feel the roughness of the bark, the small ridges and lines that age the surface; find the gnarls and lumps under your fingertips. Press your weight further against the trunk and take note of its sturdiness, the way it pushes back against you.
“Mr Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said Mr Borgin, whose tone implied anything but. “Delighted — and young Master Malfoy, too — charmed. How may I be of assistance?” He started to reach below the counter. “I must show you, just in today, very reasonably priced—”
Eons later, Dobby returned. Energy exploded inside Draco and he raced over to the elf, grabbing his tiny shoulders perhaps too harshly, but he didn’t care because he needed to know “What happened? How did it go? What did Potter say?”
Mr Malfoy smiled encouragingly at his son, no doubt expecting him to be overjoyed at the prospect. All Draco could manage was a weak return of his father’s expression.
“Yeah,” Ginny said slowly, sounding more like she was talking to a child than to someone with more authority.
“I don’t—” Draco began, then realised he didn’t know how to end the sentence. “Can you — get rid of it?”
“Any more recent changes? (“No.”) Temperature fluctuations? (“No.”) Dizziness? (“No.”) Do you think you’ve fully transformed? I see you’ve switched clothes.”
Oops, this fic ended up being longer than I planned. This whole thing was supposed to be one chapter, maybe 4,000 words, tops. Next chapter will probably be long too, double oops. I can’t write short stuff to save my life; hopefully y’all are into that
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear. All those raids…I hope they’re paying you overtime?” He thrust the bag of books he had just purchased into Draco’s arms, stepped forward, and took a very old one from Ginny’s cauldron, tutting as he inspected it. “Obviously not. Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?”
,” said Draco. He and Pansy crossed to Blaise’s bed so they could talk more quietly. Thankfully, Crabbe, Goyle, and Nott were heavy sleepers, but Potter was an unknown. For all Draco knew, he’d scream and wake the rest of the Slytherins.

When he realised, Draco drew on past moments of boredom: he never thought he’d be glad to revisit the time when his mother spent six long hours at a garden centre, nor learning Muggle American history in primary school, but if they protected him from the Dark Lord, they were worth reliving.
that had compelled him to separate the article from the rest of the newspaper— no clear motivation, only want.
“Good,” said Professor Snape. “I do not know the precise content of that conversation, yet I am aware of it. That makes it dangerous. If we, for a moment, pretend I am the Dark Lord, testing your mind for disloyalty, that memory will likely surface on its own. You must do your best to distract me from it. Now.” Professor Snape took his wand from his black robes. “Have you done as I asked?”
“Is that how you intend to go out today, Draco?” he asked, fastening the last button of his forest-green coat.
“Hm. Maybe you’ve got some Slytherin in you, after all. Manipulation won’t work on me, though. Guess you’ll have to suffer.” She patted his cheek. “We have to fix your Draco voice. You still don’t really sound like him.”
From the presentation — hard-boiled eggs, tuna, tomatoes, olives, and baby potatoes, all resting on a bed of lettuce — the dish’s name was clear: salade niçoise, a salad distinctive to the French city of Nice. This particular salad had always been a favourite of Draco’s, as the ingredients were arranged separately rather than mixed together like typical salads. Pretentious, yet artful and delicious.
After that first truly successful attempt at ejecting Professor Snape from his mind, Draco found the results much easier to replicate. Soon, he was ready to move on to other things…
After a long while, Draco said, “I’m ready.” And he was. The memories he’d chosen might not work the way Professor Snape had intended, but he felt much better about starting there, and then moving into more dangerous territory if it was necessary. Merlin, but he hoped it wouldn’t be.
After slipping into a new set of trousers, Draco sat on the edge of his bed, his mind moving too quickly to lie back down. Merlin, but he felt there was something off about the dream. But was that because he had almost kissed
“Dobby was ordered to, sir,” Dobby said quickly, his gaze darting around the room before landing on Draco’s shoes. He fiddled with the pillowcase he wore. “And he was strictly forbidden to let anything slip before Master told you himself.”
“Now, I want you to promise to visit me,” Pansy was saying as she smoothed the wrinkles of her skirt, “I don’t want us to grow apart because you grew tired of seeing me every day at school.”
Pansy leaned against the doorframe and crossed her arms. “Just girly things, you wouldn’t understand.”
“I command you to stop laughing— Well, it’s screeching, isn’t it? At this point?” He put the voice back on: “Stop
Madam Pomfrey ignored that. “Is there anything else you can tell me about the whole process? How long did the transformations last?”
Raziel sprung up onto the arm of Draco’s chair, turned, and settled heavily across Draco’s lap. He pushed his long, naturally-serious face into Draco’s hand. Absent-mindedly, Draco scratched under the cat’s chin.
With Dobby gone, Draco set about getting rid of the marigolds. Unfortunately, no matter how many he plucked from between the stones of the balcony, or burned, or soaked in herbicide, more round blooms sprouted up, quickly spreading so far into his bedroom that it looked as if he had amber carpeting.
“Try not to look so excited,” Professor Snape said. “Remember the reason your mother asked me to teach you.”
scowling at you again,” said Weasley at the Gryffindor table. He looked thrilled that Potter was doing such a good impression.
One morning, on their way to Defense Against the Dark Arts, Pansy threaded her arm through Harry’s and said, “Look there, Draco.” She pointed down the corridor a ways, where Malfoy, Ron, and Hermione were dodging through the crowd of students, heading toward the same destination.
“Transcribe the following,” he said to the piano. A modest stack of blank manuscript paper flew to the music desk, poised to comply.
“Bluebells…” Professor Snape said thoughtfully. “Constancy. What were you thinking about during that time? I only got flashes— you were frightened…by what?”
“He’s making it very difficult to exist in public,” Draco said one night, after being accosted by Potter outside the toilet.
“Not really,” Harry replied, making sure to smirk the way he and Pansy had practiced, “it’s more the fact that you’re
As Draco walked the dark corridors, he felt a dull weight settle onto his limbs and chest and eyelids, growing heavier the longer he kept moving. His meetings with Professor Snape always drained him a great deal, not only because he was practicing throwing someone from his mind— something he didn’t yet fully understand how to do. No, he was also worried about what, exactly, Professor Snape could see, had seen, or might see, as he dug around in Draco’s mind. Because, as Professor Snape had astutely pointed out, there were many incriminating things to uncover.
