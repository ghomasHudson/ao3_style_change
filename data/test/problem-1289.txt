"I have failed Draco for years. Harry Potter gave me another chance to become the father my son deserves. For that alone, I will be forever in his debt. Rite and charm or not." Looking at the file he had placed on the table, the man pondered, "I want him safe, and Mrs Granger-Weasley had me convinced that this was the right way." Looking up Lucius implored, "These wizards are dangerous, Severus. Their organisation might not be as numerous as ours has been, but they are by no means harmless. They don't have one madman at the top but several cells working together for a common goal; as equals. That keeper wanna-be Wanesworth, Evergreen, the ever-trying upstarted and that snotty nosed Tatings, our head boy, the amount of power they can amass through their rituals is breath-taking. Alone, Harry stands no chance against them. They nearly killed him and Longbottom once. Our Department works on making their organisation illegal, so the Aurors get the chance to pick them up and lock them away on sight."
Snape! Harry was still too out of it to do anything but obey, when his professor used that tone. "Sir," he acknowledged his professor, watching him leave the field to get his two best friends. He downed the steaming potion Hermione pushed into his stiff fingers, as soon as he had landed; gratefully trading his broom for the warmed blanket Ron wrapped around his shoulders.
With a content smile, Harry turned towards the door.
With a gentle smile, Emilia pushed back her chair and encouraged, "In that case, let us go and make sure that he reaches that point again. It will be hard work, but I am sure with your and Harry's help, we will be able to get him back to his cauldrons."
Draco had then left for the Weasley-Granger home, gratefully accepting a cup of English Breakfast, while feeding Inari. As soon as the little fox was settled, he had returned to Grimmauld Place. The afternoon had been an exercise in futility, since studying his godfather's notes and being actually able to brew the poison-extracting-potion were two completely different things.
"Do we have an expert on Unicorns?" Harry wanted to know, weaving his wand over the mess he had made and cleaned up his desk at the same time.
Casting a half-hearted refreshing charm on himself, the young wizard called out, "Emerald?"
Raising his eyebrows, Draco shrugged, "We are not stupid, you know. Mother, father and I know that we have nothing if we fall out with you. Whatever you expect from us, we will provide it!"
"Of course," James had replied, "Albus told us about it, as soon as Sybill Trelawney had signed her contract. We planned on starting to move, a week into the New Year. This Christmas … we wanted to celebrate with my parents and then relocate and protect our location with a Fidelius. But apparently, that did not work."
"Are you ready? This is going to be dangerous."
"I do not care!" Snape roared, prompting Harry to tumble back as if the man had hit him.
"One."
"Somehow, I doubt that," the Lady mumbled, but before her husband could inquire further, Draco picked up the bottle and topped off all of their glasses. "I think it goes lovely with the meat," he said, mirroring Harry's raised glass.
Harry accepting that he had to die to save them all had finally opened Severus' eyes to the man he had become. The fact that the Marauders had offered sincere apologies for all the wrongs they had heaped upon him during their time at Hogwarts, might have played a part as well. What had finally helped Severus to swallow his pride, had been James Potter's honest appeal, "Please, don't punish my son for sins I have committed. We have watched and listened, and ever since the final battle, he has tried to make up for wrongs he has never caused. Don't hurt him by throwing that back into his face. He doesn't deserve that."
"There are no black fruits, and the blazing white ones are … ahm …" Charles nibbled on the biscuit.
"That we could make it work. That we could put time and effort into creating the life we had always wanted. And then we decided that it was not what we wanted any longer. She's happy as a chaser, and now she is even happier with Justin. Her life is so much better than it could have ever been with me and that's okay. I want her to be happy more than I want her by my side."
"A combination of both of our ideas. Since there's this huge dungeon floor, I start to wonder if we could move the lab from the attic to the cellar. Ventilation wasn't a problem at Hogwarts, right? There is more than enough room for your lab, a study and a slightly bigger, second lab, for Severus."
Harry Potter's eyes flickered, "Very well," entering, he placed himself in front of Draco, looking him straight in the eyes. "Draco Malfoy, did you brew a poison to kill Lord Alexio Rosier?"
They had returned, with a vengeance, after he had brushed down the last of the walls, exchanged the last of the drapes and dusted off the last of the furniture. Harry had fallen into a hole, swallowed by his own memories of torture and death. Sleeping had become a distant memory and eating a once-in-a-day occurrence. He had cared for his live-in house guest better than himself, and the man had been in a coma since the day of the Battle at Hogwarts.
For a few moments, the two stared at each other, before the Head Auror accioed his quills and reclaimed his seat. Leaning back, he folded his arms and demanded, “Explain.”
"You thought what?"
Chewing at his bottom lip, the blond merely shared, "Severus wants to see you."
The voice the pureblood identified as that of the oldest wizard, cautioned, "Are you sure we can trust him?"
Putting his teacup down with unnecessary force, Draco snapped, "Because I seem to be unable to achieve anything useful with magic these days!"
"Perfect conditions for a successful marriage, I would say."
"Then, what is?"
"No," Lucius shook his head, "as far as I know, her girlfriend served as her chambermaid. Her skill in healing magic and discretion are the only reasons she was able to stay at the Rosier house for so long, and that Astoria is still alive. All in all, I would consider it a quite advantageous arrangement. No matter the children, we will never have to worry about a Malfoy heir not being of Malfoy blood."
"The Triwizard's Tournament …" their team-leader nodded. "The spell was readily available. You just put it to a different use."
"Well," Harry grinned. "Last night, we … darn." Aware that he could not disclose anything without Snape' permission, he deflated.
Shocked, Harry startled, staring at the boy, who wouldn't meet his eyes. Behind him, Draco went very still.
"For me?"
Doubtful, Pince considered, "An abducted witch, two thirds through her pregnancy, and you expect her to do enough magic for you to locate her?"
"So …?"
Folding his arms, the brown−haired wizard demanded, "Care to share your plans with the class?"
happy, instead of carrying Albion's weight on his shoulders."
do paperwork!"
After a heartbeat, the Lady nodded, "That might be a good idea. Why don't you join us tomorrow? I think we could do with some fresh eyes."
, not the person they believed he was.
Tears were rolling down Astoria's face, when she sobbed, "He said, since I am unable to conceive anyway, there is no need for him to be careful or limit himself."
"You are not going to let me live that down."
"Of course," Harry jumped at the chance to do something. He wanted to help Astoria so badly but knew that his hands were tied as long as the young Lady offered no official complaint. "Biscuits?" He inquired, before vanishing through the door, as soon as the young witch agreed.
"I already said that I was sorry," Lucius offered weakly. He was aware that he had shown an appalling amount of bad judgement, and a hideous lack of self-restraint. But, … "What more can I do?"
"Excuse me?"
"Yes, my lie…" with a weak smile, Lucius corrected himself. "Yes, Harry." Once the kitchen-door had closed behind him, he heard the young man reclaim his seat. "It seems, as of now, we are operating on a deadline."
"What you asked me to do: showing you what I am making." After he was sky-clad, he entered the circle. Carefully, to keep the item surrounded by moonlight, he carried it over. "The priests who taught me this kind of magic insisted that no 'outside influence' is allowed to enter the ritual-space. I don't know if that's really true or if they were just all secret exhibitionists. They did not wear a lot of clothing in their everyday life either. Usually, I make these artefacts during the warmer months. But, for yours, I did not want to wait." He shivered slightly.
"But O.W.L.s are not for another three months!"
Watching the pureblood share such uncharacteristically emotional details, it was hard for Harry to hold his tongue. But he knew that not all secrets of this house were his to share. After a while, he asked quietly, "If you could see Professor Snape one last time. What would you say to him?"
Evading the concerned hands of her husband and child, Narcissa stepped into the doorframe and shared in a calm tone. “I should certainly hope so, I spent the entire afternoon polishing it.”
"We must have done something wrong." Harry despaired, running his hands through his hair, over and over. "We must have hurt him somehow. Have you heard him? He was …"
Shoving back from the desk, Draco shot to his feet and spat angrily. "If you don't want me to be … stay here, just say so! I might as well leave!"
Sighing, the blond looked at his comatose godfather, before he whispered, "Dolohov admitted to having worked the system to get out on probation. Father hinted that he enjoyed participating in the raids against muggles … that he actually liked hurting them. If me being threatened is the last straw for him to be locked up for good, with the key thrown away … it was worth it."
Crawling over the make−shift bed, the blond helped to cover them against the early morning chill, before patting around for a free pillow. The blond did not particularly like to lie flat, yet he could not find one that was not already in use. He hesitated when Harry stretched out his arm beckoned him closer. It reminded Draco very much of last night, where he had become aware of the raven-haired's arms around him before the other wizard had screamed his head off. Lying embraced by Harry Potter seemed … awkward, like taking advantage of someone who had already done so much for him.
Unblinking the elf looked up at her. Well, strictly speaking, she had not asked a question or issued an order. "What other things in the house aren't working properly for your master?"
"I thought you were …" Draco whispered quietly, more to himself, as he was ashamed of his unfounded jealousy. It was not as if he had any right. He and Potter were not in a relationship. No matter what they tried to make The Prophet believe.
As soon as Mrs Nightingale would come in tomorrow, he would ask her to help him leave his room. He had idled long enough!
In a heartbeat, Harry decided and nudged quietly, "Go, change," while weaving his wand over the armchair, that stood beside the bed. He did not register Draco's smile, when the pureblood realised, that - while the cushiony chair had expanded into a large chaise - it would still be a tight fit with both on it. Still, he did not protest when he returned, clad in dark-green silk-pyjamas. The raven-haired had already claimed a place on their make-shift bed and wordlessly pulled Draco into his arms. It was not luxurious or even overly comfortable, but it was the best sleep they had gotten in a very long time. Neither noticed the sparks that drifted into the room, despite the closed window, settling over their precious patient. Nor were they aware of their quilt, travelling upwards, to cover their shivering forms, after it had slipped down mid-morning.
When Harry took a bite, the meal was - of course - the perfect temperature.
Frowning, the raven-haired crossed his arms, "And did they get anything useful out of her, yet?"
"Well, I did not make it easy for him to change his mind about me. Yet, he was, …" trying to think back, the young wizard attempted to come up with an explanation this mirror-image of his parents could understand. These were not the souls who had stood by his side during the hardest moments of his life. Maybe they were even younger than him in that picture. Yet, Harry did not want to miss his 'real' parents. The images in this portrait really were the next best thing, after all. "He was demeaning, but consistent. He didn't treat me worse when I was 'Undesirable No. 1' nor better when I was the 'Boy Who Lived': he was just a bastard either way. But these days … Severus kind of lives with me. He insists on paying rent; calls me an idiot on occasion. But … but he listens when I have to talk. Even offers advice and while it is rarely what I want to hear, most of the time it's valid."
The elf's eyes glazed over for a moment but became impossibly large when they re-focused. "Kreacher does not now," he admitted hoarsely. Then he let out a wail and started banging his head against the table. "Kreacher does not know where Master Draco and Master Lucius are. Bad elf.
Narcissa's distress was eased by Neville, who gently patted her arm. "Don't worry, she does that every time they come. They are her friends."
"Who else knows?"
Flabbergast, Harry stated, "Are you telling me, that Lucius Malfoy is my own, personal mood-ring?"
"A man."
Harry had a 'saving people' thing, hence he invited Snape as a patient into his own home. How little he cared for him at that point, can be seen by him traipsing all over the world, leaving the Potion Master alone with but a nurse-made and an house-elf to care for him.
"But how …" After all this time, seeing something so sensitive untouched by everything that had happened, took Harry's breath away. "This is the same one you brought to Hogwarts in your fifth year?" He had to make sure.
Have a great weekend.
The room around them started trembling, while the 'Saviour' stood in the middle, head bowed, fists clenched.
Teddy was sniffling in Harry's arms a while later, protesting weakly. "But I don't want another tree. This one is perfect. All special and ex..., extra…, extraordinary!"
Gazing at the horizon, the young woman replied, lost in thought, "The herd has been uneasy these last few days. But I think white and black will go along quite well. I'm concerned about Teddy."
Trading a concerned glance with his family, Lucius offered, “If you wish, I could return to the Manor alone and leave you to your work.”
Not looking up, the young man whispered hoarsely, "I thought that I had gotten him out."
At least as frustrating as hearing, "Sorry, I can't tell you."
When even Hermione started to look sceptical, with Ron downright glaring daggers at Draco, the blond injected somewhat hesitant. "Maybe that is not the best way to begin this conversation."
"Draco …"
"Nothing, of course!" The pureblood seemed appalled by the very idea.
The former Lord would have loved to point out that that did not make him feel particularly safe and was reluctant to admit that he had no clue of how to end the spell.
"Why?" Lucius wanted to know because at the end that was all that mattered.
"Two of whom are the Lady Longbottom and Hermione Granger."
"No?" Harry gazed at his vassal, his face a picture of innocence. "Well, in that case, you better keep up!" Tossing the platinum-haired the Nimbus 2000, he summoned again, "Accio Firebolt!"
--O-O--
"That's the problem," Draco admitted. "We can't. At least not right now."
Black dragon-leather unfolded from the oversized package, Molly placed on her daughter's lap. Trousers, a vest and bracers and a helm spilt from the box. Amazed, Ginny shook out the gear. "Wow, that's incredibly strong."
"Oh," the Minister of Magic smiled ever so slightly. "The boys."
"You know what, Draco. My house, my rules. Now say the name!"
"Ten seconds later than the last time you have asked. Honestly, Draco, you need to calm down. You are getting splotchy." Harry replied exasperated.
--O-O--
"I did," Harry relaxed, leaning back into the chair, comforted by the memory. Sometimes he was not even sure if it had not been all but a dream. In other moments, he knew his meeting with Death to be true, like he knew that the sun rose in the East. "It was Dumbledore who greeted me and gave me a choice: to either go back or to go on. I … I wanted to see you and Sirius and Remus so badly. At the same time, I knew you would not want to see me so soon. You would have wanted me to have a long and happy life. That's why I went back, leaving the Horcrux behind. In the end, I managed to defeat Voldemort with the Elder Wand. But the next day …"
Chris Draca (2nd Librarian British Library): Actually Christopher Pendragon, Librarian of the Arthurian Library. (Blond & carefree with too little regard for the rules (What Archetype might he be?))
"Three," Ron finished, then yelled, "Bombarda Maxima!"
Gapping, the former Black martriarch demanded to know, "You can not honestly be on his side. His mother was a mudblood and his father the reason my own son turned his back on his family!"
"It's love, Lucius. The love of my mother saved me from the killing curse. My love for my friends made me come back when I had every right to go on. Narcissa's love for Draco saved me in the woods when she lied for me, so I had a chance to defeat Tom. And your love for your family made you turn your back on the dark
"Of course, I am," Harry contradicted, neither understanding the situation, nor the distress it obviously caused their patient. He was entirely taken aback when the Potion Master shouted, "I do not need you to be … my caretaker!"
"You don't?"
determined not to take advantage of her."
'Oh,' Harry thought, detached, as their spell encompassed the entire British Library. 'There are even more floors below this one. Am I in the middle of the entire structure? That would be good. Wouldn't it? Our spell was meant to spread out from the bottom to the top. Will this work? I should talk to Bill. But now does not seem to be a good time. I am not sure if anybody has mentioned that this would hurt so much. I hope this works. I want to find Madame Pince …"
"Not necessarily, no."
often! Nor was it
As Ron and Harry hugged briefly, Astoria did the same to Draco. Kissing his cheek, she whispered something in his ear that made him smile ever so cautiously. Before the blond had a chance to reply, she apparated away.
Doing as he was told, Harry discovered a relief of a beautiful woman, petting a bull. It was barely larger than the palm of his hand. He wanted to reach for it, yet somehow it felt wrong to touch. "I did not know."
−−O−O−−
After a few minutes, where they had lain in silence, the witch whispered, "I know Harry will come for us, but …" Brushing over her pregnant belly, she admitted. "I am still terrified. What if something happens to Hugo and nobody is there to protect him?"
Turning the stone in his hand, Harry closed his eyes and blindly reached out for George's hand to cover his own. He did not want to see his family again, scared to succumb to the allure of the dead. They were all waiting for him, patient and proud; it was enough to know that. Clearing his mind again, he opened his eyes, catching a glimpse of a pale figure before looking at his friend. Calmly, Harry told him, "I can't give you your brother back. No magic on earth is capable of that, believe me, I've looked. But what I can give you, is a chance to say goodbye."
Since all members of their group were engaged in battle with two, if not thee wizards, all they could do was stare at the green light, that raced towards Draco. A desperate attempt of a desperate man. Severus Snape was the only close enough, aware enough to do something and the witches and wizards around them had to watch in horror as he pulled his godson close and switched their places. A green shield flared up, swallowing the killing curse and the baffled look of the leader gave the Lady Malfoy an opening to step forward and scream, "Not my child! Avada …"
Since the first excitement of being back with her wizard seemed to have abated, and the little fox had set out to explore her new habitat. Therefore, the blond languidly walked over to join them and inquired, "Do you think it is big enough? We can cast warming charms around it, but I was concerned that she might be too hot, with her winter pelt and her usually living outdoors and all that."
He wouldn't … couldn't allow that. With Lucius Malfoy prancing around Grimmauld Place, he had to get better and fast. Because, every day he was not able to keep an eye on that foolish boy, was one where his fellow Death Eater could sink his claws further into Harry. The young Auror was in danger and not even willing to acknowledge it. True, the pureblood was bound to him. Severus had to give it to Hermione Granger to find the most efficient solution to that particular problem. But being physically not able to attack his liege certainly had not rendered Lucius Malfoy harmless. Far from it!
Yes, Severus Snape told himself. He could do this. For the sake of Lily's son!
"Apparently so," the Potion Master mumbled, before lifting one leg after the other into the tub. In obvious disdain, he looked at the mountains of rainbow-coloured bubbles that rose out of the water. Still, he reminded himself to be grateful, so he did not comment. Choosing the moment when Harry turned away to reach for some towels, Severus hastily pulled off his night-gown and slid into the water. He could not withhold a groan of pure bills when the hot water lapped at his skin. He had a hard time remembering when he had last taken a bath, but after a moment decided not to bother and to just enjoy the fragranced water. When Harry turned back around, Severus felt the impulse to cover himself but noticed that there was no need, since the bubbles preserved his dignity sufficiently. Clever boy.
Smiling relieved, because finally, his friends looked more curious than irritated, the raven-haired revealed, "By eliminating the need for it."
"Mars is bright tonight," the young wizard whispered to himself, closing his eyes against the rising memories of a night, long ago, before turning around. "Hello, Firenze. Good to see you."
The relief was palpable when the man rose and bowed. "Yes, my liege. Mrs Granger-Weasley, Mr Weasley, thank you for your hospitality."
After a whispered exchange between the older Mdm Pince and the Arthurian Librarian, Pendragon suggested, "Why don't you return with the Lady Malfoy tomorrow at noon and allow me to invite her to lunch?"
Would it have made a difference had his parents stayed at an estate? Would ancient wards have protected them all? At least then nobody would have been able to rat them out. A Fidelius could be applied to anything. "It did not do them any good in the end …" Harry resigned, tousling his hair. "They all died because the protection was not good enough."
"As his friends," Hermione interrupted gently. "It is our duty to support him to the best of our abilities. But we can't educate him on things he does not want to learn."
"In this time, when it is darkest,
"For a Weasley?" Harry challenged.
"I will do everything in my power to make that happen," the girl promised. "But from a certain point on, it will be up to you." Studying the coin she had kept on her person at all times, Luna mumbled, "Stonehenge. Not much time left now. Please, excuse me, Augusta, I have a message to deliver."
The need for popcorn had increased significantly, or so Irma Pince had told Harry, when he had accompanied her back to Hogwarts. There was even a betting pool between the other librarians if they would rather kiss or hex each other into oblivion.
A slow tilt of the head.
--O-O--
--O-O--
"If you can answer that question … Harry … you have made a good start." Severus spoke gentler now, but with no less intensity.
--O-O--
"You know he doesn't like anybody up here?"
“So mote it be,” Harry accepted the binding vow, putting a hand on the platinum blond’s neck.
"Would he even have had a chance?" Harry inquired quietly. "I mean he was a half-blood, and quite poor on top of that. I admit that I do not know much about the inner workings of Slytherin, but it seems to me that a boy of his standing had it difficult either way."
Harry cautiously approached his trembling vassal who was whispering to himself under his breath. "They'll be back soon. I can't let them take away memories of Draco or Narcissa. They are the only happy ones I have." Then, completely unrelated, "That cursed book! He deserved it being destroyed! Bringing an abomination like that into my home!" Another violent shiver. "Draco … my precious little boy …" Lucius flinched violently when Harry touched his shoulder. He curled tighter into himself, shielding his head.
With the barest tilt of her head, she greeted her ancestor.
Eyes flickering towards the door of the Minister's office, the redhead coughed, "I was … ahm … at home. Sick, you understand."
, but yes, such a lack of care
Coming to a full stop, prompting the taller Auror to run into him, toppling them both over, Harry looked up, an evil grin spreading over his features. "You know what, Neville. You are a genius."
When Draco handed them over a minute later, Severus threw them into the antidote and gave three last stirs clockwise with the glass ladle, then five counter-clockwise before reducing the flames to mere flickers that lapped over the bottom of the cauldron. Looking at his fidgeting godson, he demanded to know, "What is it?"
"Did you know that I would be in the garden … this afternoon?"
And despite obviously knowing that what he did was wrong, Lucius Malfoy folded like a house of cards. Carrying an - obviously illegally acquired file - he stepped around the desk and approached the fireplace. "Alright, I …"
Raising his eyebrows, the wizard challenged. "Considering that my potions have a far smaller chance of blowing up or colouring the brewer red and gold with their vapours, it is safe to say that I can brew in your kitchen!"
Rolling his eyes, Harry set down his drink, with a little more force than necessary. "Neither have I been, nor will I be fired over this!" He insisted. "Yes, the Head Auror is pissed, and yes he forced a weeklong vacation on me. But even he knows that what I did was right!"
"No!" Draco interrupted him decisively, stepping even closer until the holly-wand touched his throat. "You lost the right to keep me away the moment you gave me his journals."
On Wednesday, not long after breakfast, there was scratching on Severus door. As he opened it, a shaggy looking snow-fox sat in the corridor, looking up pitifully. When the wizard crouched down to scratch her ears, she allowed it for a few moments before bounding towards the stairs, yipping excitedly. Following, he opened the backdoor, before looking around the kitchen.
"Isn't what? Explain yourself!" She demanded, growing tired of their back and forth.
Sighing, James shrugged, "Because I am a painting, Harry. Peter is one of my best friends. I can't feel that betrayal that hurts you so much, because for me it hasn't happened. I am sorry, son."
Forcing himself not to chuckle at the absurdity of the situation, Severus had merely taken another sip and decided, "I am quite content. Thank you."
"I know what I have said, Draco," the raven-haired sighed, touching the bridge of his nose as if praying for patience. "But now I am telling you to bloody shut up and eat. Things won't progress any faster if you topple over from exhaustion!"
The soft light that fell through the half-closed curtains illuminated Harry's slow rouse from sleep, drinking in the sight of the woman by his side. With a choked sob, he pulled himself close, and she wrapped her arms around him, calming him. "It's all right. You're safe. We all are."
"You might be too, one day," Hermione replied.
"Kreacher!"
"He has been mine to treat for more than ten years, I have you know." Poppy stated, glancing at the woman who stood in the door of Snape's room.
The first time, Harry had been at Longbottom Manor, he had been baffled by the sheer size of it. Of course, he had known that Neville's family had been well off. But nothing about his friend had ever indicated the grandeur his family lived in. It might only be a fraction of Malfoy Manor, but every stone and drape and furniture was of outstanding quality, albeit old. Where the Malfoys had put their wealth and breeding on display, Neville had ignored his. Meeting Augusta Longbottom in person had been quiet … unsettling.
Smiling crookedly, the young man assured her, “I think I will be able to find it, don’t worry. Harry will help you with your husband, and I will bring the leaves momentarily.”
more important than his own. Even Draco - who had been subjugated more than most others - showed more sense of self-worth than the 'Boy Who Lived'. A worrisome tendency, if what the boy's parents and the other Marauders had told him was true.
"Exactly," Severus confirmed, then he lifted his fingers, one after the other while counting, "Voldemort clung onto the last part of his soul. The rest was split between Nagini, Ravenclaw's Diadem, Hufflepuff's cup, Slytherin's Locket, the Gaunt Ring, …"
Shaking his head, rubbing at his tired eyes, Ron repeated a little more quietly, "Yes, it was, and that's the worst part. A Horcrux doesn't conjure feelings. It can only amplify what is already there."
Indicating a bow, the elf plopped away.
As soon as they hit the ground, Teddy tried to wind out of their hold, but Lucius held on. "Edward?"
"Voldemort," the blond whispered.
Looking over, starring at a man who hadn't moved in five years, Harry slipped from the window−sill and approached the bed. Carefully, he pulled up the blanket and then gently brushed a strand of dark hair out of the comatose patient's face. "I'll talk to you tomorrow. Good night, Sir."
"Narcissa?"
In the end, Draco, was better off without him, since every single decision he had made for their family had ended in disaster. Therefore, it did not alarm the former Lord, that his liege led him back to the Auror Department. There was no safer place to lock him up before they got the chance to send him back to prison. He was, however, surprised when Potter entered the Head Auror’s office with the words, “Accio pencil-cup.”
"Breakfast?" Harry asked, looking at his friends.
"You were not supposed to," Neville shrugged.
"Through the door and the second to the right," Harry replied with a grin. Her greeting might be harsh, but her host-gift was more than generous. Having been educated in the art of tea by Andromeda, Harry was aware that the tin-can Pansy had offered was around three galleons. An outrageous price for a pound of tea-leaves, but entirely worth it. At least in Andromeda's opinion.
"Priori Incantato." She cast before dictated. "Please note that the spells that had set off the alarms were cast with the wand of Mr Harry Potter, 11" of holly with a phoenix feather at its core?" When the owner of the wand confirmed that, she gave it back and continued, "Since no violation of the terms of the Malfoys' house arrest has occurred, we can close this investigation. A report will be filed, and two copies will be sent to your department, Mr Potter. One for you and one for the Malfoys' gamekeeper."
Chuckling, the raven-haired looked down. "Not very suitable in the long run. But what about …" Pondering, he searched for inspiration, before smiling at the bundle in his hands. Carefully he brushed a tuft of white hair out of her face, deciding, "I will call her Emerald. Because she is just tiny and precious and beautiful." When the baby gurgled, he kissed her forehead and whispered, "Hello, Emerald, welcome to the family."
“And what would you need to be able to determine whether he is innocent or guilty?”
Then, the magic overloaded his system and with a scream of anguish Harry's world turned black.
Watching the other Auror from behind his lashes, Draco trembled when the door fell shut. "I won't have to return to the Manor," he breathed, and Harry confirmed that readily, to ease him. "No, you won't, you'll stay with me."
“Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Could you please repeat yourself?” Head Auror Roberts stated calmly. Meaning, he gave Harry the chance to change his mind about what he had just said and offer a different opinion. Usually, Harry jumped at this chance readily, adapting his stories so they would cause the least inconvenience for his superior. He respected the man who, despite recruiting him the moment he had set foot on British soil after his gap year, had always offered an open ear and an unbiased opinion when Harry had asked his help.
Claiming the armchair beside the bed, he inquired, "How was your day with Emilia?"
After a few moments of quiet contemplation, Astoria nodded, and the young Auror called out evenly, "Kreacher. Emerald."
Nodding, the raven-haired Auror searched for his partner's eyes and then began casting in parsel tongue.
"Sure, mate," Ron mumbled, "Where to?"
Walburga's chuckle captured their attention, but only Snape drew the right conclusions. "The Lord Black who acquired this place was a parselmouth. Hence, the excessive use of snakes as decorations."
Glancing at the younger wizard, the man nodded and closed the door behind himself.
Flinching, Draco asked, "What letter?"
Lucius paled when his son stumbled into the dining-room, at his master's call, looking angry. Draco wore unusually old and torn clothes, and his arms and face were scratched. Only at Harry's exasperated remark to at least wash his hands, he sullenly cleaned himself up in the kitchen sink. However, despite having promised Lucius that he would call Potter out if the other wizard ever went too far, no further conversation happened between the two. Draco merely joined them at the dinner table, shovelling the peasant's dish into his mouth, before the Lord of the House could even take a bite.
"Are you …" It was hard. Severus had never been a very compassionate man. But even as an Auror, Kingsley Shacklebolt had always done right by him, among the Order members. Neither thrown accusations at him as many others nor met his spy-duties with open mistrust like Moody. Still, the Potion Master felt uncomfortable when inquiring about the Minister's health. Fortunately, the other man understood and eased his concerns.
"Do you think it will ever get any easier?" Harry asked after a while.
Relieved, Harry stepped aside. "Breakfast will be served momentarily."
"I know," the ginger relented. "I just … why can't he choose knitting as a profession? Much safer."
"More or less," was the quiet answer that left the pureblood dumbfounded.
--O-O--
--O-O--
"They do," Severus confirmed, making his godson relax noticeably.
asked for help!
Betareader still sorely needed.
"You can turn around now," the young witch informed them, wrapping Harry's satin nightgown around herself. She nodded her thanks when Draco offered a soft blanket in addition. Hesitating for a moment, as if unsure if she wanted to share this information, the young witch revealed, "When you treat your servants kindly, they become very loyal. Even if you are new to the house. Whereas, when you only offer insults and abuse, they do as you order, but don't necessarily follow your intentions."
Harry was appalled about the way these purebloods talked about such, traumatic events. "Listen, Astoria, we don't have to talk about this now. We can go and see a doctor. I know a few trustworthy healers and medi-witches. This does not …"
−−O−O−−
"But I couldn't even brew any of them." The other man mumbled. "I would need a proper laboratory, and … a wand." He added quietly.
--O-O--
"Then how could you possibly …"
The two women steamrolled the man, entering Harry's hospital room, arms entwined. As soon as the door fell shut behind them, Molly drew back and smiled when Narcissa tilted her head gratefully.
The present was soft, and immediately, Draco knew what it contained.
"Hey, girl, you're hungry?"
Content that his tactic had worked, Severus tilted his head. "Bring me your yellow book, and I will think about it."
His year-mates nodded reluctantly. Only the headmistress seemed exceedingly calm. "In that case, I suggest you make sure that you don't, gentlemen. "
Dejected, the little guy replied, "Kreacher has no choice but to, Master."
"No," his partner corrected, "I mean, did you actually
Accepting the piece of clothing, though it seemed barely warm enough to ward off the February chill, Narcissa froze when her body vanished. Not even a vague shimmer could be seen, as was common with such enchantments. Admiring the artefact, she followed Harry to the garden. "The Misters Weasley have improved their spell work considerably."
--O-O--
"No, but I think we might be able to find one rotten fruit or the other under the surrounding bushes or foliage. Then we floo Longbottom to learn about the best way to extract the seeds, and then we plant every last one of them. At least a few are bound to sprout."
−−O−O−−
,” he gestured dismissive towards Lucius, “out of your sight for even a heartbeat, I’ll fire you faster than you can say Expelliarmus. Are we clear?”
During the last Quidditch -match of the season, happening during a thunderstorm, the beaters of the Slytherin-team had been hit by a storm-wave and had collided mid-air. The two players had been knocked unconscious, tumbling to their deaths. Only the closest players had even been able to spot the disaster through the heavy rain. The three Ravenclaw-chasers had thought incredibly fast on their feet and conjured a blanket between them, catching their unconscious opponents. They had lost the Quaffle. And the Slytherin-seeker had caught the Snitch, oblivious to the crisis. The game had been called to an end the moment the chasers had touched down on the pitch with their precious cargo. A rematch had been discussed, but even the Ravenclaw captain had to acknowledge that his chasers had forfeited their game and that it had been the right decision. So Slytherin had won the Quidditch cup of 2001.
Bowing, indicating a kiss, the future Lord Malfoy looked into the sky-blue eyes of his potential spouse and squeezed her fingers gently. "Thank you, Astoria. I do appreciate the offer."
The stern voice of the residing Potion Master made the boy flinch at his lookout. Still, he replied honestly, "Eyedropping."
But what tricks about climbing roses Luna Lovegood had shared with her fiancé would remain a mystery, since Neville froze on the doorstep, tools and bucket sliding out of his unresponsive fingers, clattering noisily all over the terrace. The stop was so unexpected that Harry ran right into him, nearly toppling them over.
"Everything is fine," Neville assured Harry. "I'm here on personal business." Looking at the Malfoys, the pureblood inquired, "Since Luna and I helped you at the Manor last week, I wanted to ask if you were amenable to return the favour?"
Chuckling, his friend replied, "First, I never said that you couldn't, just that you do not think about books in your day to day life. And second, what the hell, Harry, you need to get out more! You start to sound like your little Malfoy."
No matter how good Ron had become at brewing, Draco was still better, understanding potions on a level far surpassing the redhead. Therefore, Ron had no qualms doing the 'menial' tasks of cutting, dicing and grinding. In the beginning, the blond had been surprised, but his inquiry was met with but a shrug. "We all have a vested interest for this to work. You are our best chance, so I'll do whatever I can to support you. Just like I do with George."
Whipping around, wand still in hand, Harry ignored the Lady Malfoy’s flinch when he accused, “You had no right! I made it this way on purpose. She banished Sirus from the family tree, so I thrashed her favourite room. I was about to give it back the moment her son is returned to the family!"
"Thank you." Reaching for the wrap, Draco spread it over the raven-haired, rescuing the potions' journal from its folds.
"You know what that does, just from looking at it?" The Auror asked, surprised.
At George's inquiring gaze, the raven-haired's brain finally caught up with his mouth, and his cheeks burned up a flaming red. "I mean … I … we're not …" Harry stammered, but the redhead only slapped his back.
Narrowing his eyes, Robarts guessed, "You want your house-elf to ask the questions, right?"
When Harry wanted to protest, that right now
--O-O--
"Of course, I will." An earnest reply. "After I have talked to Harry."
Despite her parents being convicted Death Eaters, Daphne had put a lot of work into earning her place in the Inquisition Squad, and while Harry did not necessarily like her, he respected her devotion and never-ending effort to find the truth.
Sharing a look, the two youngest Aurors stated as one, "House-elf!"
"And Fred's last," George pointed out.
Taking in the young woman's pale but determined face, the blond wanted to know, "How do you propose this partnership to work?"
Nodding, she confirmed, "Very well then. That point is up for discussion." After a heartbeat, she inquired, "Are you saying 'yes' then?"
witch happy. I think I ought to talk to the goblins before we finalise any plans. Most master builders named in this chronic came from Gringotts. I see no reason to break with that tradition. If we want the best, I will have to pay for it."
"What?"
In the shower, the pain had elevated slightly, when the cold water had streamed down his back. Afterwards, he had taken his time, oiling his body, applying his make-up until every line was crisp and clean. His hair surrounded his head like a golden halo and under different circumstances, he would have preened. However, as things were, he had only felt slightly sick when he had judged his dolled-up appearance. However, since he had not eaten in nearly twenty-four hours, he had not been overly concerned about something coming up. Instead, he had chosen his outfit with great care, noticing only at the end, that the dress-shirt did not come with buttons at the lapels. Glancing towards the corner of the room, where he had hidden the cufflinks, he had wondered if he should dare to use them. Yet, in the end, he had chosen to search the drawers for another pair. What if Mis… Lady Blackwood did not enjoy the emeralds, despite her apparent preference for the colour green? She could vanquish them with but a flicker of her wand to Merlin knew where. No, Draco had not been willing not risk that! Better to find an alternative!
The young man's increasingly heated speech was met by a meek, "Yes, Sir."
Trading a smirk with Pansy, Hermione revealed, "Harry never gives his true likings in these articles. Since he always hands all gifts to charity, he never tells the truth, because he 'can't bear to give away treacle tarts'."
It was rare for them to be on first-name-basis. Still, it had the desired effect of the young wizard finally meeting her eyes. "I was wondering … you said that Professor Snape's research is available, but I wondered who … what became of his rooms." Oh, this was so hard, because no matter the reply, Harry knew that he would instantly dislike the person who had invaded the sanctuary of a 'dead' man. No matter how much right he or she had to live comfortably in the dungeons.
But the raven-haired paid his fellow Auror no mind. "I can do it!" He hissed.
"And why is that?"
"Wow," the witch blinked. "I certainly did not see that one coming. But we should not be overly surprised, I guess. About a third of Regulus' old books were on potions."
"I killed Albus …"
"Then don't," Harry shrugged easily. "There are enough rooms around to change one into a nursery, and your room can be expanded to fit a couple. A handful of extension charms and voilà. Ron would help. He's good with those."
"We can't. Not until she's ready."
"Has my godson had breakfast?"
"Are you willing to testify to that under Veritaserum?"
With an indulgent smile, the witch revealed, "Harry gave the patient, someone he has cared for the last five years, something you brewed without even testing it before. I think you are the best there is."
"I didn't think," Harry admitted.
It took their colleagues still more than an hour to get them out. Thankfully, when Harry and Neville both drooped from magical exhaustion, their cavern remained stable. Once they had been pulled out and were fixed on stretchers, Harry managed to rasp out, "Kreacher …" before he lost consciousness.
"What?" Harry's head whipped up, starring at the headmistress in wonder.
Now it was Harry's breathless, "How?" That was predominated by the Potion Master's demand, "I want to see your notes!"
After Hogwarts and magic and Horcrux versus Hallows, Harry had troubles reconciling everything that had happened with the picture of an arbitrary god, that guided everyone's fate. Also, it was easier not to believe in an almighty, divine power that allowed a baby to lose his parents and then be abused, in what was supposed to be his home for ten consecutive years.
"If you two are finished discussing my personal affairs with the entire Auror department, I would greatly appreciate it, if someone would try and explain why we try to track an entire library." Kingsley demanded sternly. "It's not as if the British Library will stand up and leave London."
Massaging the bridge of his nose, Harry guided the man into his living-room. "Do I have a say in that matter?"
"He moved!" Draco whipped around. "His fingers, when they touched my face! He must recognise me."
Narcissa added, "While Lucius is in a distressing condition, Mrs Granger Weasley is quite well. She is a very strong woman. While the abduction put a strain on her mind, her body has been taken care off quite well. All her nutritional needs were met sufficiently."
But the young man shook his head and replied quietly, "I don't know."
"Sweet!" Draco noticed, licking whipped cream from his lips.
"Voldemort," Harry and Ron stated in one voice, ignoring the flinches from the others, with Neville as the only exception.
"Let me guess," Daphne smiled sharply while sipping the tea Sero had finally dared to serve. "It's not as much without a magic section as the public is led to believe."
"Exasperation," the two wizards corrected perplexed.
But the house−elf merely looked at him, his big eyes full of concern. That was the moment, Harry heard it: a suppressed sob, intermingled with quiet whimpers. Slowly he let go of Kreacher and turned towards the noise, understanding dawning. "He told you not to tell anybody."
Briefly pressing her lips together, Narcissa put down the letters. "He can't do that! His social standing will suffer if he continues to neglect these duties."
Ron's incredulous words cut through the silence of the attic, not long after sundown. Though he had planned to follow his wife before dinner, being so close to finally succeeding had kept him at Grimmauld Place and the blond's side, who now stood frozen beside him, staring at the steaming cauldron.
When they were back at the Ministry, after having given their reports, Neville reached for his spray-bottle and approached the overgrown wall that dominated their office. Harry could not even name all the different greens and tiny pedalled flowers, that created the serene picture his partner had planted. Still, he was glad to have something in the room that made Neville so obviously happy. Maybe it would gain him a prolonged reprieve. His hope, however, turned out to be in vain when said partner sighed and stated quietly. “You think I don’t get it, but I do!”
"Oh," scratching the back of his head, the raven-haired admitted. "Maybe there was a little more to my trip than merely visiting the vaults. Have you any idea how to integrate a family portrait into a house's wards?"
Smiling once again at the memory, Lucius revealed, "Sunshine Yellow. He even bribed one of the older students to turn all of my robes a blazing white. I looked like an upside-down dandelion for a week."
"Anyone you want."
"We will," the former Death Eater promised with conviction. "We're not alone anymore. I swear, Narcissa, we will do everything in our power to save your family."
Disoriented and aching all over, Hermione stumbled as she was roughly shoved into a dark room. Fortunately, strong arms caught her and gently lowered her to the floor, as if the person knew about her head spinning and her stomach heaving. She could hear an unfamiliar voice, leer, "Don't worry, witch. You'll get out safe and sound after the next eclipse. You're just here because you couldn't keep your nose out of other people's business. But I'm sure your Death Eater whore will make your stay here as comfortable as possible." Then the door slammed shut and was locked audibly.
"K'," Harry mumbled, not even looking not even looking up from his coffee.
Magic filled the room. Not much, but enough to be noticeable. Hermione looked at the ceiling, where a tiny coil of smoke was escaping through a crack. "I know you're looking for me, Harry. I just need you to be clever about it."
Seven hours later, the two enjoyed a light snack in Severus' room. The Potion Master had been ensnared, enchanted and appalled in equal parts when he had gone over the research Draco and Harry had brought back from the Manor. Most days, he was so lost in it, that he forgot all about meals, and only ate and drank when Emerald pushed a freshly brewed cup into his hands and forced a sandwich or biscuit into his palm.
"Of course not!" Draco snapped appalled. "It's much too soon for that. However, there are magical creatures, whose core are quite similar to ours, albeit weaker. If we could get our hands-on … let's say a niffler and provide only non-magical treasures, we could monitor changes in his core easily. With their natural displacement abilities, we can be sure that no artefacts or other natural skills would influence our readings. Also, we could ask Lovegood. She's well versed in magical zoology. Maybe she even has better ideas on what to use."
Ah … blessed silence.
"You don't have to be to deserve this, little brother. I don't need you to be Fred, Ron, just be yourself." Hugging Ron tightly, George let him ride out the waves of anguish, not bothered by his shirt getting wet. When Ron finally pulled back, sniffing embarrassed, the twin grinned, "Besides, it's a Christmas present. So, you can't
"I would like to talk to my account manager," the Potion Master held out his key.
"And not really treat them with the care they deserve," Charlie continued.
To discuss conception and childbirth amongst the witches only, would be the socially acceptable thing to do. Yet Astoria shook her head. Rising, she approached one of the tall windows, staring into the wild garden, with unfocused eyes.
"Third door on the right. I'll be with you in a minute. I'll go and… put this somewhere safe."
"Harry." She confirmed, gently reaching for his hand, squeezing it comfortingly.
"Calm down, James. Clearly, we don't know the whole story."
Rubbing his face, the young wizard complained. "Why does everything have to be so bloody complicated?"
"Not really," the raven-haired replied absent-mindedly before he paused and looked up. Cautiously he wanted to know, "Why?"
Tilting her head, Hermione all but grinned. "You did not know that."
"Neville," the boy exclaimed, instantly wide awake. "I saw a flower yesterday. All white and pretty, like Luna's earrings."
"Draco," the fellow Slytherin turned away from his creations and instructed calmly, "Undress!"
"No," he whispered to himself. "Harry Potter is a good Master. Would not hurt baby." Looking up for the first time, he inquired hopefully. "Will Master claim her, so she can become useful and strong?"
Harry, who had been brought up with the concept of praying together and that 'good people' attended church, was utterly confused. "What use is a religion you can't share with your family and friends? There is no unity."
Well, Harry guessed if the expected punishment for even the smallest infraction was a Cruciatus, doing menial tasks all day long was nothing. Also, the Auror suspected that all the liberties Narcissa was granted, because of the couple's 'good behaviour' made it all worth it for Lucius. Apart from working with the librarians, she had managed to pull some strings, with her sister's help and had inspired a magical equivalent of a kindergarten. At first the witches had been quite distrustful of the idea, but since Andromeda still was well respected in some circles, around half a dozen children were brought in every day. The fact that Rose Granger-Weasley had been the first girl to attend had certainly helped a lot. As did the fact that an old Black-property was used. Everyone still remembered that the Blacks had always been excellent with wards.
"That's not how it works," the former head of the Malfoy' family stated quietly, approaching the open window. "That's not even what he was about." After a heartbeat, he added. "At least not at the beginning."
Last Saturday I made the last step towards the 'new me' and went to the hairdresser. I've always had long or semi-long hair. With 140 kg, nothing else was suitable. But now that I'm not overweight, I cut my hair short, and I mean short! My longest strand is 7 cm tops and I love, love, love it every time I look into the mirror.
After Mdm Pince, Miss Belfast and Harry had sorted out provisions and - with the help of the Malfoy elves - guestrooms for all librarians, there was a knock at the front door. When Harry opened, he wondered for a moment if someone had transported
The blond would have been surprised by the tender tone, so unusual for the battle-hardened Auror, had he not heard it countless times these last few weeks whenever Harry was talking to Emerald. Since the raven-haired seemed determined to put on a show, he lowered his eyes and whispered softly, "Yes, my Lord." He could not help but feel comforted by the small kiss the raven-haired pressed on his forehead, before turning towards the former Death Eater with a predatory smile. "In fact, it was Draco who offered. And while we were not exactly friends at school, he has yet to disappoint me. I would even go so far and say that he has risen to any challenge I have presented him with." Scrutinizing the two wizards before him, the 'saviour' casually pointed his wand at his vassal, noting how Dolohov instantly reached for his sleeve. "Lucius has not made me regret my leniency either. He has certainly put his skills to good use, and I must admit that both he and Narcissa satisfy. Not that I expected anything less of pure-bloods of their upbringing, and with their … talents."
Twisting around, hitting his friend with his elbow involuntarily, Harry managed to dig his keys out of his trousers pockets. During the last fair he had visited with Victoire and Teddy, the girl had won him a tiny flashlight, covered in violets. It was barely big enough to hold its battery, but until they decided to let off their shields, this would have to do.
Thanks to my new betareader DarthKrande, who offers not only correction but inspiration as well, this is the best version of this story we can come up with. I hope you all will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed working on it.
Looking down and then at the door, she nodded. "I understand."
Undoubtedly familiar with the supply of food − or lack thereof − available in the house, Narcissa wanted to know. "How …?"
"Yes, … No, …" At the other's confused look, Draco advised weakly. "Please, just talk to him."
Harry was woken from a light doze by Foxglove, who had claimed a place on the back of the chaise and started grooming the raven-haired. "What do you think I should do?" The young man looked up, but lowered his head again, when his owl hooted in irritation. "Who would even listen to me?" At another soft noise from Fox, a realisation hit. Everybody listened! Every bloody witch and wizard in Britain devoured, dissected, and repeated everything he said and did. Maybe Narcissa was right. Perhaps he could change their ways, keep the people safe, not only by catching dark wizards but by making people learn from their mistakes. Children were left alone until they started Hogwarts, but what would have happened if Dumbledore had taken Tom Riddle with him after the boy's magic had been revealed? What decisions would have Severus Snape made, had he not alienated his best friend with a horrible insult he had learned on his grandfather's knees? And how would Draco's life have turned out, had his parents encouraged friendship with people like Hermione instead of setting them up as competitors?
"Thank you, Luna … and Neville. This is perfect." Harry smiled, hugging both of his friends. Scratching his head, he then admitted. "Actually, I too might have something for you."
"A tea," Draco drawled, "Miss Granger has apparently handpicked in China, considering that she needed nearly twenty minutes to prepare it."
Relieved that they had come this far, Hermione had not been sure that the archaic rite, she had dug up, would even be recognised, she nodded encouragingly, and Harry stepped forth. “Right here, Sir.”
"Greengrass."
"Expecting seems to agree with me."
With a small tilt of his head, Severus confirmed Neville's suspicion. Yes, he had known that during their last year at Hogwarts, every other student of sixth and seventh year had carried around a bottle of the healing drops, hidden away from the Death Eaters that had roamed the castle. They had healed Cutting Curse wounds before they could scar, eased nerve-damage from over-exposure to the Cruciatus, though the potion was not inheritadly meant for that. Yet with the few ressources the students had been able to acquire, they had done their best. As residential Potion Master, he had brewed cauldron after cauldron for the infirmary, never allowing himself to think about sending more vials up, than Poppy had ever received.
In one voice the Mdm Pinces chided, "Language, Alexander!"
Kindly, Harry spoke up at his back. "Molly did not want you to feel obligated to wear something, not to your liking. It is not as fine as your mother's, but she tried to make one you would enjoy."
"I'm aware."
Hesitant, the other wizard shook his head. "Better not," but Harry merely shifted the boy's weight and gestured. "Come on. It will be all right, I promise."
"Are you sure this is what you want?" Molly Weasley inquired, shifting Rose on her arm. "I mean with Hermione and Angelina pregnant … and she and George have just come back from India …"
See you around Christmas :).
Once the food was gone, Harry picked up the tray with the dishes and nudged Draco. "Come on, I have one last Christmas present to share with you."
"Harry, are you there?"
−−O−O−−
Eying Pendragon, who stood at the side, the young Auror sighed, when the librarian merely grinned. "You thought this was a good idea, now deal with it." And without a by-your-leave, he retreated to the dining-room.
Folding his arms before his chest, the blond turned to look away resentfully but nodded anyway.
"We did … maybe he does still. I don't know. But … in that shack, after Nagini's bite, he gave me some memories. One of them was really important … as in … important for me to know so we had even the faintest hope of winning. Others … I don't know if he offered them on purpose, or if they were just emotionally linked to the scene in Dumbledore's office he needed me to see."
One by one the other participants of the ritual filtered into the kitchen, and it was a relaxed breakfast until the icy voice of Narcissa Malfoy cut through the serene atmosphere. "Harry James Potter, what happened to you?"
"Draco," Harry mumbled, stepping up to his friend, pulling him close.
−−O−O−−
consider most important could be of no interest to you. As I said, look him up and try to find out if there is something about him that speaks to you."
"Great," Neville confirmed, clapping him on the back, before dragging Harry towards the en-suite. "Now, let's take care of your hair, so gran can show you off to all the young women she had invited."
"Again?"
Relieved, the two wizards exchanged a quick glance, before Draco offered his arm. "My mother has tea prepared in the blue salon. Would you allow me?"
As soon as the door was closed, the blond rushed to the sink, drowned one of the wet cloths before lathering it with the readily available lavender soap and started to scrub his face and neck, drenching the upper half of his clothes in suds.
"Because apart from his parents, Ron had five brothers and one sister," the raven-haired answered instead. "And
Both Draco and Harry looked at Severus who still held the blond protectively in his arms. But his stony face as he released Draco told them that he would not cast a counter-curse, as he released Draco. Obviously, he shared Narcissa's opinion on the man's deserved fate.
Chuckling despite himself, the pureblood eased her. "Don't worry, Narcissa was the same during her pregnancies. I got used to being either shouted at or cried upon."
"You can't come back from the dead! There is no magic on this planet to allow that."
When he returned to his office, something blocked the door. Something other than Kreacher, who lingered at the side. Nodding towards the elf who then vanished again, Neville closed it, finding Severus and Narcissa in a tight embrace, the Lady was trembling all over. "If something happened to them, Severus, I don't know what I would do. I can't … not after You- … Voldemort. We have to find them!"
With Lucius and the Department of Law, things were different. Since the beginning of the week, the former Lord had become quiet and withdrawn during their shared lunches. Yet, whenever Harry asked about what was bothering him, the wizard merely replied, "Everything is fine, my Lord."
Have a great weekend and a good start of school/college/uni/work :).
"I spelled yellow flowers on the tin." Sliding over a list of colour options, the wizard elaborated, "Yellow is for Earl Grey. Red is for English Breakfast. The iridescent flower is on the tin with the unflavoured leaves - tell her you want rainbow-flower tea if you intend to go for that one. Pink is for the fruit-tea while green is for peppermint. Camomile tea is, of course, still white."
Misguided as he had been, Narcissa had never blamed him for choosing Dark over Light. She too had been seduced by Tom Riddle's promises of greatness for all purebloods. The return to the old ways and a revival of nearly forgotten traditions that had once been the base of their culture … of their magic. The charismatic man had promised them wealth, influence and power and she - like so many other Lords and Ladies - had believed him. They had all been wrong in the end. Yet, thanks to one fearless wizard, they had not paid with their lives for that mistake. Hence, there was only one advice she could offer, having gained some perspective, after having worked as Harry's 'private' secretary for the last few months. Reaching out, she gently touched her husband's clammy hands and offered, "Lucius, Harry does not need you to say sorry. He just needs you to be. Our 'Saviour' has all but the best of intentions, and I think it is time that you understand that, instead of painting the shadow of Voldemort on his shoulder at any given moment."
Another nod.
"Teddy," Harry drew the little boy's attention from skipping over the pavement while holding their hands. It was barely a twenty minute walk to the garden, so they had decided to just bundle up in some warm clothes. Draco had eyed Harry's offerings with distaste, but more because he didn't like pullovers that said 'Polyacrylics' on the label. "When did Andromeda tell you that growling and biting is acceptable?"
Closing his eyes against the rising hope that this would not become yet another useless attempt to make things right, Harry nodded decisively before looking at his friend. "If we succeed, it will be worth it a hundred times over."
"What do you mean?"
Fourth … no.
"I, … well, … you know, it
"Stop being so Slytherin, with your accusations and your wounded pride!" The Gryffindor exploded. It was entirely possible that he was not as calm as he had thought. But Malfoy always could push his buttons like nobody else. Looking back, the two of them had always enjoyed their little squabbles. Still, seeing the other wizard curl into himself instinctively, reminded Harry that they were not on equal footing any longer. Wrestling back his temper, he continued in a more reasonable tone. "Listen, Draco, I want you here. But not as a slave or a boy−toy or a punching bag. You made a request and offered payment. I fulfilled the request and accepted the payment," albeit not magically binding, "because I thought you would be better off here than in a house where Tom tortured and killed people. You did your fair share of evil in school. Mostly because you had no choice, but partially because you were a spoiled brat."
"Harry?"
After repairing the hourglasses, McGonagall had called for a staff meeting, where they had decided to separate the Quidditch cup from the House cup. The student body, the Slytherins especially, had been more than pleased.
"She insisted on a relocation?"
Chuckling, Ron bowed down to kiss his wife's head, "Whoever did she get that from, I wonder."
Both Aurors could hear the effort Robarts put into maintaining his calm. Harry could have done without the accusing look Pince was giving him, but in the end, he knew he deserved it. However, "With all due respect, Sir, the Lady Malfoy was never a Death Eater."
"It is," the blond confirmed, squeezing the boy's hand. "And while I hope that neither growling nor biting nor getting scared will occur, I will gladly accept your offer." After a confirming nod towards Harry, they were out of the door.
"If you really think so, Christopher Pendragon, you are an even greater fool than Harry and Draco made you out to be."
After a while, the witch brought up what they were both thinking, ever since exiting the vault. "Are you sure it was the right choice to leave Harry alone?"
--O-O--
"And Lucius is quite fit himself. A little bird told me that Lord Potter has banished him back to the Manor, mere two weeks into their … arrangement."
Looking up, he reached out with his left hand, Ron seemed determined to keep the other, to caress Ginny's tear-stained face. "It's alright, Ginny. Please, don't cry."
With a low chuckle, Narcissa pinched him. "What do you think?"
Approaching her baby-sister Daphne took her hand, "Astoria, this is going to be dangerous. 'Risking life and limb'-level dangerous. I can't allow you to throw away your future like that; not now that you finally have one."
"But," gesturing half-heartedly at the potion's equipment, he pointed out, "what's the point of all of this, if not to help him?"
happen if something went wrong with the librarians.
"But that's not …," Harry defended himself helplessly. "I just want everybody to be safe!"
And I am nearly finished with this story. Well, not really finished, but I am about to reach a point where I feel that we can end the first part. I have tons of ideas left, but they would only blow up this story, not really going with the storyline. I will - most likely - add one-shots in the future. I've just cooked up a nice idea with my beta DarthKrande. Also, if anyone out there wants to play in my sandbox, feel free to do so. I hope that you can have as much fun with these characters as I do.
"Not …"
“Damn, Harry!” His boss threw his cup of quills against the wall and shouted, “Why, by Merlin and Morgana, would you do something like that? To get Death Eaters behind bars is your bloody job description!”
Pressing his lips together, Harry shook his head "He is acting all deferential and submissive. Trying his best not to jump to conclusions."
The next year, Harry had returned from his gap-year just in time for Halloween. Being a mother and freshly appointed barrister at the Ministry had taken its toll on Hermione. Therefore, she had been the one to break down. In the year 2000, Harry had just lost a young muggleborn witch to a vicious Death Eater attack. Somehow, the world was not becoming a better place. It was still full of people that considered their blood-status more important than anything else. Humans and witches and wizards alike had that overwhelming ability for cruelty, viciousness, and pride and that tore Harry to pieces.
Later that night, or early in the morning, depending on the point of view, Draco found Harry in the back garden, where the raven-haired nursed a big glass of water, watching their little fox, who seemed lost in quite happy dreams.
Looking stubbornly at his parchment, Harry did not reply.
--O-O--
"Oh, cub," Harry sighed, opening his arms to the child that scrambled out of his high−chair, faster than Draco could assist, flying into his arms. Hugging him tightly, his godfather mumbled into Teddy's hair, "No matter what you say, no matter what you do, I could never hate you. Never ever!"
When he received no immediate reply, Lucius prompted again, "So?"
With a tilt of her head, Narcissa gestured towards her new guests, "Thomas Manson, Cynthia Belfast, Chris Drake … And you are certainly familiar with Irma Pince. Michael Welsh is currently studying in the library of the Manor. 'Fascinating new resources', he called the Malfoy Collection, so, I assume it might take a while for him to join us again, to be properly introduced."
"Half a year ago, in fact," Draco added.
"Where did you go?" Draco wanted to know.
Barely keeping himself from face-palming, Draco replied with a forced calm, "It is certainly more complex than that. If you are stressed or worried for an extended amount of time, Father feels a minor reflection of these emotions. Just enough to let him know that intervention is needed."
Looking at each other, the librarians traded casual shrugs. "If we connect my floo to the Manor, that poses no problem." Christopher Pendragon stated.
This past week had been, … well, not good in Lucius' opinion, but at least bearable. That new colleague of Mrs Granger-Weasley had traded his vindictive remarks for vicious glares, and though Lucius had been mostly wrapped up in researching these 'Children of Hecate' and their various affiliations, Mr Sandorn seemed to have been just around the corner to sneer at him, every hour of every day. It was tiresome, really. At least the librarians who had overrun the Manor showed him some common courtesy. At least when they acknowledged his presence. Most of the time, however, they did not; too wrapped up in their research, noses buried in one book or the other, even when walking down the corridors. One time, Lucius had even been run over by that quirky curator, who had balanced a dozen books in her arms, levitating several more. She had apologised, of course. Profound, even. But he was not sure if the collision had even registered in her mind enough to remember it after she had rounded the next corner. Being single-minded, blocking out all outside influence, seemed like an occupational hazard for these people.
Reaching for Draco's throat, allowing his fingertips to travel the expanse of the creamy skin, Dolohov mocked, "Did you have to offer your heir for Potter to take the deal?"
At Harry's slightly disgusted look, Ron sighed, clapping his shoulder, "Yep, the time has come again. Best not to look. At least it's not chocolate this time around."
--O-O--
Trailing the edges of his glass, Harry mumbled, "It was all politics and power-play and taking advantage. It was … I know that the purebloods work that way, but I thought …"
Pondering the statement, little Rose Granger-Weasley stated after a minute, "They get more expensive!"
With a content smile, Luna nodded to herself. "Of course, they are not broken in. But that does not mean that they won't tolerate a rider. I've ridden them since I was four." And then, she let go of Neville and approached the oncoming herd.
"How come that your divorce rate is close to nil?"
"Stop it!" The man ordered from behind clenched teeth.
"Your point, Potter!"
"Of course, she does. Don't let her demeanour fool you, Harry. All purebloods cherish children above all else. Even if they rarely act like it in public. No matter the circumstances of Draco and Astoria's children's conception, they will be loved. Never doubt that."
"With all due respect, Sir, but what do you expect to find here?" Harry inquired, following Alexander Pince and Charles Leewood into the entrance hall of the British Library.
A knock on the door surprised him since his friends were all accounted for and nobody else should know the address. Harry had never bothered to end the Fidelius on the Order's Headquarters, he had merely allowed it to wear off since it kept the harassment from the reporters to a minimum. Therefore, he was astounded to find Daphne Greengrass standing in the doorway.
Whipping around, the pureblood approached the floo. "Astoria, please, enter." Chivalrously, Draco held out his hand.
"Of course, he's in our family tree after all."
A very Slytherin approach, but Harry could not deny that the chances of success were quite good. "Anything else?"
After blinking owlishly for a moment, the young wizard shrugged, "Fine, let me get my pillow."
−−O−O−−
"Oh, sweetheart." Lily sighed, while Sirius tried to explain, "Death has a way of putting things into perspective, and eternity is a very long time to hold a grudge."
"Pettigrew was a sniffling, worthless, little rodent!" The Potion Master shook his head. "Still, it was my responsibility.
" Where to?"
Pulling the attire back in place, after Harry had waved his wand over it, the blond studied their reflections for a moment. Then he opened the first two buttons of his robe and the first one of the dress-shirt underneath.
3. thought, meaning, sentence/period
"Lumos."
Still laughing, Harry sat Ginny down and approached the Hufflepuff he had once protected from Draco's conjured snake. "Good to see you, Justin. Welcome to the family." Holding out his hand, the latest arrival mirrored his easy smile and shook it. Then, as etiquette demanded, he turned towards their hostess. "Mrs Weasley, thank you for inviting me. Mother sends her best and had me bring some meat-pie. With your permission, I would like to put it into the kitchen for now."
With a war-cry that called for sugar, the children stormed the kitchen. A heartbeat later an exasperated roar sounded through the house, "Harry!"
Hesitating briefly from buckling up his dragon-hide, Harry sighed. "I went to Gringotts to visit the Potter vaults."
"I will return it, come morning."
Shrugging, Harry stated, "Well, I thought that maybe the last year before the battle, you might not have had time to keep up with the latest developments of your trade. A few editions are missing, mainly spring of 1998 because the publisher's headquarters were destroyed. The first edition after the battle contains an obituary for you, detailing all of your achievements. That was not long after you had received the Order of Merlin 2
"I do paperwork on occasion," the Auror defended himself, slightly hurt. It was not as if he
"Agreed!" Harry hastened to reply, shaking the man's hand, before he could second-guess his decision.
--O-O--
When the floo sprang to life, Draco threw Harry a vial of a purple concoction. "I'll get them into the dining room."
--O-O--
Shaking his head, his father explained, "It is not as easy as hanging us up on a random wall. We would have to be integrated into the wards. Do you know someone who can do that? My relations to the Black family are two generations back through Grandma Dorea."
Sipping bitter tea and grimacing at the taste of it, Harry wanted to know, "What makes you say that?"
Draco stood frozen, going over the conversation that had just happened. He had never gotten to know this part of Harry. The part where his 'master' threw angry words at him and made empty threats. Of course, the threat had been empty, Draco tried to reassure himself. Harry would never take Inari from him. She was his familiar.
"Sorry," the ability of this man to make him feel like an unruly child was amazing. Still, Harry could not fight the feeling entirely. "I'm just worried, I guess. Pendragon purged the dining room, but Malfoy Manor and Voldemort are linked in the peoples' minds. What if they succeed in jump-starting a Squibs core, but the public won't accept it, because of where the research was done? Or because Narcissa was involved? I know she wants to help, but what if the witches and wizards of Albion can't accept her involvement?"
Now that his worst hunger was curbed, the Auror went into more detail. "The librarians have some kind of 'group research' going on and think that your mother can help them. But since working at the … where they were before, would be too much of a hassle - Narcissa would need a Ministry entourage every time she went there - they relocated to the Manor."
Harry added with a defeated shrug, "He is not talking. Not eating. Barely sleeping. As far as we can tell. We tried everything except 'pick me up' potions, because Emilia said that their backlash is hard to cope with, even for a healthy person, let alone someone in Snape's position."
be a good cause to help squibs gain full access to their magic."
"How?" Pince wanted to know.
"Well," the witch replied. "After our overwhelming success, I think you should be given a chance to celebrate with your family. Whatever you wish for, Kreacher will be able to provide it. Also, I don't know how long Harry will be caught up at work, and I think it would be best for you and your wife to spend your time somewhere where the magic of the house−elf is not restricted. In case of emergency."
Soothingly, Emerald patted the tiny elf's head, "Emerald will not take Master-Draco-Sir, promise!"
After a deep breath, the young Auror admitted, "Yes, but that's not what I'm most afraid of."
"Now listen, Leewood," Harry growled, "I sat on all N.E.W.T.s required for being an Auror. I'm as qualified as any other Auror!"
"Could've fooled me," Harry mumbled, but gestured apologetically for her to continue.
Making a gesture that was neither here nor there, the witch revealed, "Don't get me wrong, meals without preservatives and the chemical enhanced flavours muggles seem so fond off, the lack of electricity and the need to rely on mechanical instead of radiation … ahm … fuelled energy creation, and last but not least our potions, that can nip mental and physiological problems in the bud before they become chronical … we may not be as forward-looking as the muggles, but in my opinion, we are better off the way we are."
"Fuck," Harry whispered, and instead of reprimanding him, the Lady merely nodded gravely, "Indeed."
"Potter!"
Sniffing a little, she pulled back and brushed over her eyes. "Sorry, stupid hormones."
When Draco woke the next morning, he could not remember what had happened. Everything seemed to be a combination of dreams and memories, with no way for him to decide what had happened and what had been in his head. And while the comforter on the other side of the bed was churned, nothing else indicated that someone had slept there. Also, he had sworn Kreacher to secrecy, when the elf had come to his aid when the first nightmare had hit. There was nothing to worry about.
“Indeed.”
With a soft smile, the older wizard shared, "Your barriers are much impro… better. But to read you … I only need to look at your face."
The journey to the bathroom was the next logical step. Yet, all of a sudden, Severus had to suppress the trembling of his limbs. This was the first time, he was about to walk in five … nearly six years. Potter's charm should hold, but what if his legs would not? What if he remained bound to his bed for the rest of his life? However, before his anxiety could increase to panic, Severus felt a warm hand reaching for his arm, strong and steady. Looking up, he found Harry's warm, green eyes gazing down at him and the young wizard promised solemnly, "Don't worry, I will not let you fall."
Staring at the pillows, the young man shook his head, seemingly lost in thought. "We did, but … somehow it felt like we would have to construct a shared future out of it. It was not … it did not feel natural." After another heartbeat, Harry looked up and offered an honest smile. "But that does not matter any longer. Ginny is engaged. She has a promising Quidditch career and a man who adores and grounds her. Justin is
"Harry, you won't receive any help from the general public, if you don't learn to ask for it. I know your family is very supportive, but you will need many more on your side if you want to have any hope of succeeding."
The goblin started coughing, "Per square-foot."
"You better keep that safe," Flickwick spoke up from beside the Weasleys.
Draco picked up a green one. As soon as the small treats were consumed, it became apparent, that the frosting indicated the colour the consumer was about to change in. After watching their skin turn blue and green respectively, Draco served tea.
"… corrupts absolutely. I know. I've seen it."
Pondering the offer, Astoria shook her head. "He knows that he was … quite rough tonight. He might get suspicious if I don't have a mark on my body come morning. I only came here because … because it hurt," she whispered after a second.
Once the offenders were dealt with, the Head Auror Robarts approached the cut-off area where the Dementor was hovering. It was not a 'cage'. The wizarding world had learned from their past mistakes. Abused creatures were just too easy convinced by honeyed words and empty promises. Though the Dementors were no longer confined to Azkaban, they were still available for administering the Kiss to irredeemable criminals. Currently one of the hooded figures floated over a wide area that was bordered by a huge, prowling wolf and - strangely enough - a blazing white duck that flew in circles around it. Holding out his hand, the wolf approached his wizard and Robards reminded the dark creature, "Dolohov and only him. Like we agreed upon."
Then he left through the living-room floo.
"No … Harry?" The other started with a frown. "Harry?" He slowly opened his eyes. "What's going on?" Draco stood and noticed his reflection, the partially made up eyes; the styled hair; the tinted cheeks and lips. His face bloomed a flaming red, but Harry could not tell if it was the humiliation or impotent rage.
Shrugging, Harry offered a cup with but one sugar. "I think she likes this one best because there are flowers on the tin."
"No, just, … if you could give me some time, that would be appreciated." Turning towards the younger wizard, the former professor requested, "You are well aware that I do want to talk to your mother. It's just …"
"Certainly," taking a composed sip of tea, the young witch started to lay out her thoughts. "Tough you are quite … tied up at the moment, you are still next in line to the Malfoy Lordship. Your name carries weight in our world. Maybe not so much at the moment, but you and your father have aligned yourselves with the Potter-Black Family. Since I do not see that changing any time soon, you will regain a part of the power and influence your father has amassed before the war."
Shrugging, the young man admitted, "It's not as if it wasn't predictable that he would do all that. After the battle … everyone was clamouring for my attention, even a few goblins because of the Black and Potter vaults. But every time Griphook and I crossed paths, he just … he insulted and belittled me even for my lack of economic and financial understanding. So, I thought … well, at least with him I know where I stand. He of all people would be honest with me."
There was a long moment of silence before George spoke up. "There were once three brothers, who were travelling on a lonely road at midnight. They came to a dangerous river and cheated Death of their lives by conjuring a bridge. Death was angry but cunning, so he offered them gifts as a reward for having beaten him. The oldest brother demanded a wand, powerful enough to defeat all others. The second brother longed for a girl, taken before her time, so he wanted a stone to bring back the dead. The third brother was the smartest and asked for a cloak to hide him from Death."
Harry was reaching for his wand but abandoned the gesture when he noticed that both Fleur and Bill were already casting warming-charms on the kids. "Good to see you," he entered the room, inevitably prompting Draco to follow.
Getting up post haste, the undersecretary promised, "I'll get Professor Snape for you, and then I'll prepare a nice cup of camomile tea for my boss."
"I have no need to cheat, never had. Either I succeed on my own devices, or I fail." Looking the other man in the eye, Neville stated coldly, "You of all people should know that. You have set me up for failure long before any war was even on the horizon."
"Of course."
"Potter, you have a very disturbed mind."
offered a compliment if a member of his team had performed outstandingly!
"Harry."
When he turned, Severus' voice held him back, "Potter?"
"How do you …" the other asked baffled. Until now, Draco had been convinced that nobody knew of his extracurricular activities. Except for Emilia, of course, but the medi-witch approved, and he had asked her to keep it to herself. Clearly, he had been wrong.
"Yes, father?" The boy replied eagerly. "What do you need?"
"Most likely saved her sight." Snape confirmed. "You would have left scars but … it should have worked."
Another nod.
“Where … where are we going?”
However, after a moment, the Potion Master shook his head and gestured towards the leather armchair. "Sit," he commanded, before floating over a book. "Read!"
Looking at his friend, Ron wondered, "When have you become so wise?"
A vigorous nod confirmed his suspicions.
"You're beyond hilarious, Leewood," the raven-haired deadpanned.
Shaking his head, Neville continued in a solemn tone. "Katy, … Kathrine Bartmond … she was three years my senior, and … well, long story short, her family was attacked. They survived by the skin of their teeth, but she decided that she wanted to do something. To make a change. We tried to brew the Draught of the Living Dead, after hours, but she was careless, let three poppy seeds slip in instead of one."
She too sounded close to tears, and somehow Draco felt like he was invading a private moment. Slipping out quietly, he sank to the floor on top of the stairs. Of course, he had been aware that a man with Potter's life suffered from nightmares. After all, that had brought their unusual sleeping arrangement to his attention in the first place. Yet he had never thought about it in depth. Harry Potter was the saviour of the wizarding world, the saviour of his family. And while serving the Dark Lord came with its own set of nightmares, so did fighting a war, watching people die for a cause Harry had figure headed. Draco had never looked beyond the grief his immediate family had suffered. But Harry had had the weight of their world placed on his shoulders. It was not surprising that he felt responsible for every life lost, worst of all Fred Weasley, a member of a family that had adopted Harry as one of their own. Also, his cousin Sirius, the last connection the young man had had to his parents. Now his regular visits to the joke-shop and his obsession with the trice-damned carpet downstairs made so much more sense.
"Don't get snappy with my sister," Ron berated, relief still palpable in his tone.
She hissed and pulled back her hand from the fifth, as it had given her a nasty shock. Seeing the blisters on the tips of her fingers, Harry reached for her hand.
"Excuse me?"
"He will find them!" Narcissa stated with conviction.
Peeking into the cauldron, that seemed to be covered in some kind of grey sludge, Ron banished the entire thing.
"Gentlemen," the witch in the middle of the Auror-circle drew their attention. "Stand down and let us explain." She then walked over to … herself and inquired. "How long?"
Revising the information, Harry beamed after a moment. "That's the chicken in wine−sauce with the little potatoes. I love that!"
Laughing, Harry put down his half-empty cup. "A collection of self-reading children's books, that must have belonged to Sirius or Regulus once upon a time."
--O-O--
Shrugging, Harry thought about that. "That she does not tarnish the family name?"
"So, we have no chance of protecting him," Lucius concluded.
He shivered on his way upstairs. It had been months … alright, weeks, since he had dreamed of the locket strangling him and drowning in that cursed pool. Had Ron not been there he would have died, in the middle of nowhere, while reaching for an enchanted sword. Pulling the comforter tighter around himself, Harry shivered when he made his way over to the second bedroom. He still knocked, despite knowing that he would never get an answer. Slipping in, he whispered, “I’m sorry, Sir. But I can’t be alone right now.”
"Indeed, Lord Malfoy," she smiled, then curtsied. "Have a good day," before vanishing into the floo.
"Turning water into wine?"
"And I told you to shut up! Honestly, Potter, you and your damn martyr-complex …"
go. Just keep in mind that we are out of dragons, Mr Potter."
--O-O--
"For Merlin's sake." The blond grumbled. ">From this day forth, Sirius Black shall be part of the family again. So we say. So mote it be.< That's all there is to the spell. Can you remember that?"
After a while, the brunet Auror inquired, "Harry, did you see Lucius casting a spell?"
Of course not. Never! It would be like losing them all over again. Not something Harry was willing to suffer. But parselmagic … it was different. The Maya Priests did not think in terms of spell-magic as British Wizards, descendants of Celtic Mages and Druids did. They called upon the god most suitable for the task and their belief simply bent their magic to the purpose. Preferably with colourful symbols and at the right time of the year for the god in question. Of course, there had been spells that had been cast all year around … or more prayers uttered, but even those were stronger when spoken at the right time. "Alright, let's, …" looking around, he gestured towards a display cabinet that had held Walburga's most valued plates before. Green carpet, black cabinet, … should work. "Let's put it right there."
"And … ahm … what time is it now?"
--O-O--
"Harry!" His best friends snapped.
Harry was just leaving the second bedroom, a vial full of dark-red liquid in his trembling fingers. His wand was out, pointing at Draco's chest faster than one could say 'Expelliarmus'. "You are not allowed …"
“And yet, here you are.” Harry smiled. It was not meant as a reprimand. Lucius Malfoy had shown outstanding redeeming qualities. He deserved a second chance. Westron Lostrife, however, had used his Dark Mark as an excuse to torment muggles and muggleborn, even after the war. Only because of the stupid prejudice that blood was in any way significant.
"That's … to be expected," Severus decided before gazing into the antidote. Just a few more minutes. The potion was already a milky yellowish colour. Once it was a saturated yellow, it would be ready for consumption.
Then Neville turned on the light to reveal their evidence board. Instantly all guests started to talk on top of each other and for once neither Neville nor Harry interrupted them. When Neville spotted Pince, the older Auror merely gestured for them to continue their discussion. Yet he did not leave, when the brunet nudged his colleague. As Harry approached him, and opened his mouth, likely to defend his decision to bring in his friends, Prince spoke up, "I apologize, Potter." When his Auror merely gapped at him, he continued, "I forgot who you were for a minute."
Seeing his son pale, with sunken in eyes, sleeping fitfully on the couch, Lucius froze, once again mortified by the visible evidence of his mistakes. All he had ever wanted was to help the Malfoy name to greatness, as his father had brought him up to do. How could he have gone so wrong about that?
"I think there are a few photo albums in there as well."
With a non-committal gesture, Narcissa wanted to know, "That depends, are you willing to listen if I share my point of view?"
Unimpressed, Severus looked the taller redhead up and down, before gazing back at Harry, who sheepishly avoided eye-contact.
"You have grown to love him," Emilia pondered, and Harry could only shrug. "He was the closest thing to a father I ever had, protecting me to the best of his abilities, no matter how much he despised me. Snape always treated me like any other student, without any special privileges. He never fawned over me, when I was everybody's darling, but he also never treated me any worse, even when the entire world seemed to turn against me because I said something they did not want to hear. That Tom was back, for example. Professor Snape was… I don't know… dependable. I needed that more than I was aware at the time."
Pressing his lips together, closing his eyes, Harry shook his head. "I don't understand, why you are telling me this? I will never absolve any of the Death Eaters; no matter how good their intentions thirty years ago."
"Yes, she is Poppy's cousin and specialised in the care of wizards like him."
Snorting, Harry scoffed, "Because the last cult we've fought, was entirely reasonable, and wasn't following the convictions of a megalomaniac manic, was entirely reasonable!"
Evidently, this display of meekness satisfied the attending wizards, because after giving Harry a brief overview over his rights and responsibilities, which were limitless short of killing his vassal on a whim, they left the courtroom. Once the last member had gone, Neville peeked through the door. Watching the former Lord struggle to his feet, he approached his friends and asked, “So, what happened?”
"Even behind Astoria's back?"
Once the two witches had vanished, Ron croaked, "Does anybody else have the feeling that our lives might be in danger if we mess this up?"
Instantly, Lucius pulled the pregnant witch even closer, shielding her with his own body from whatever intruder had entered their cell. A sub-vocal growl emerged from his chest as he tried to pull the mountain of covers aside that had been heaped upon them, to see the potential threat.
"I will not … live off his charity … either."
"Stop changing the subject, … Potter!"
--O-O--
Jumping to his feet, Harry beamed at the older witch. "I … thank you, professor. And thanks for the tea."
Harry had had faint smear of blood on his face when he had returned. But no apparent injury to go with it. Draco had rubbed his chest during their story, gingerly, as if it pained him. Yet, right now, the two boys lay wrapped around each other, completely at ease, despite … or maybe because of their proximity.
Christmas dinner was exactly as one would expect from the Weasley family: loud, boisterous, exuberant and happy. George had managed to hide a few products among the dishes, and soon people were squeaking, mewing, quaking or shifting through all the colours of the rainbow. Ron retaliated by serving his brother a special pudding that gave him a trunk. George, however, did not seem overly bothered by that. Instead, he trumpeted happily and used his new appendage to steal candy from the top of the Christmas tree.
"… that there is a potion that could concentrate a wizard's magic in his core. Therefore, the chances are good that amplifying and enhancing them with crystals might be possible."
