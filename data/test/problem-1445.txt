Another of those not-very-nice smiles that Malfoy seemed to have cornered the market in. “How very, I must say - prepared - of you, Potter. I’m delighted to see you’re no longer as completely useless as you were at school. Having said that, I’m sure you won’t mind if I just check it’s all there, just to be on the safe side?”
The atmosphere, thick enough now to cut with a knife, took Harry straight back to when they used to face each other on the quidditch pitch; red and gold versus green and silver. “I’ve come to collect what’s owed me.” Malfoy’s voice, deeper than Harry remembered yet still as drawling, was deliberately bland but Harry wasn't fooled for a second; he knew Malfoy must be relishing his new found position of power over his childhood rival.
“Well, good for you. Which direction are you heading in?”
“Jesus. What the fuck are you doing loitering in the shadows like a low life criminal. You almost gave me a heart attack.”
Flashing Malfoy a triumphant look, Harry didn’t bother to wait for a reply, instead selecting a heavy high-backed leather chair to drag from across the other side of the room, enjoying the wince Malfoy made with every screech of the wheels. They dug a satisfyingly deep groove into the parquet flooring. Quid pro quo.
“Fuck” he curses, stubbing the cigarette out before sucking on the skin like a blood starved vampire in a vain attempt to sooth the burn. Potter’s standing by the French doors, a funny look on his face, clutching what look like champagne glasses. Fantastic. Just when his night couldn’t get any worse.
Although perhaps ‘help’ was not quite the most appropriate adjective to apply to his line of enquiry.
Harry looked askance at his drink. He had to drink that.
Turning back to peruse the menu, Draco dithered over whether he was in the mood for champagne or sharp citrus. An over-the-top throat clearing rudely intruded into his musings but when Draco looked up with a glare it was to the sight of a pair of the deepest blue eyes he’d ever seen fixed on him and a dazzling smile showing off to fine advantage teeth that even Hermione’s parents would approve of.
“Well, this is a lovely surprise, we go years without seeing each other and then it’s what, twice in as many months. Shall we do shots?” She asks this as if it’s perfectly normal for the three of them to be hanging out with Harry bleedin’ Potter. Draco shoots her a look that implies she’ll not be living to see out a clear pair of knickers if she pursues this line of enquiry.
“Does he make you scream? Enquiring mind would like to know.”
Malfoy nodded, disappearing off into a side room and in doing so providing Harry with an all-too-brief glimpse of a very pert arse. Who knew pinstripes could be so flattering? He returned a few minutes later carrying an exquisite cut glass decanter and matching glasses on a silver tray. Harry watched with misgivings as two healthy measures of what looked like extremely expensive brandy were poured, unsure that mixing Malfoy and alcohol was the wisest course of action.
Draco wonders if he could get away with beating Potter to death with one of his antique atlases.
Potter and Weasley had been surprisingly good company but Draco would only admit to it if under threat of torture. It was bad enough having to endure the triumphant smile playing on Potter’s lips when they’d bid each other good night; it took Draco straight back to the quidditch field.
Harry hummed tunelessly and ostentatiously examined his nails as Malfoy continued to glower darkly until seemingly realising that it was a waste of energy and instead forced a thin smile onto his face that didn’t warm his eyes. “Forgive me, where are my manners. Perhaps I might offer you a drink while you wait?”
“Well his hair
What with all the flustering and flirting, it was only when Draco re-joined the rest of his group that he noticed Will had scrawled his number on one of the paper coasters along with a ‘call me, hotshot’ and a winky face. He was still staring at it, shocked, when Harry cleared his throat, making Draco look up.
Draco swears. If one more owl turns up, he’s going to buy a water gun.
Malfoy pulled away a little to study Harry, his pupils blown wide with only the thinnest rim of silver showing, gaze hot and steady. Harry made a small protesting noise in his throat at the loss of contact and Malfoy's responding smile was a sharp and lovely thing.
“Will you call that idiot?”
“But Harry, I don’t quite understand why you care that Draco’s trying to shut you out of his life. Hermione said the other night you were just doing this to get under his skin but it sounds to me as if…”
“Smoking’s bad for you.” Potter’s surprisingly coherent given there’s a vomit trail running the length of his chin. Draco takes a moment to be piously appalled before flicking half a cigarette’s worth of ash into Potter’s gaping mouth.
Pansy preens, the shameless hussy. “Why thank you Potter.” She gives him a twirl and Draco prays to the gods above that she chose to wear knickers else he and Potter risk being damaged for life. “I confess I didn’t have you down as a follower of fashion.” (She’s not the only one, Draco thinks sourly. His eyes have only just stopped watering after the atrocity he saw fit to wear to the Christmas Gala, involving far too much orange trim.) “Madame Coccinelle really surpassed herself if I say so myself.” One crimson-nailed finger trails a path from her throat down to where her decolletage begins, before tugging her neckline lower still; Potter makes a choking noise low in his throat and Pansy raises one perfectly sculpted eyebrow.
Harry was terse. “Don’t play dumb with me, Draco, and don’t treat me like an fool, I think I deserve at least that. Are you going to call him?”
He knows he’s being a bit short with his friends and that they’re only looking out for him but he’s had too much to drink and he’s so tired. Blaise lifts his glass in apology. “Consider my wrists slapped, Draco. My lips are sealed forthwith.”
Draco settles on the rare positives about this unwelcome turn of events. At least in clothing that tight there’s no fear of Alfonzo suddenly making an appearance.
He was panting a little, chest heaving, with the exertion of trying to keep his temper in check. It was rather distracting.
Tonight as they left the bar Draco’s stomach was churning after Harry’s silent treatment over the course of the evening, during which they had both carefully occupied the time normally spent in horseplay and joking around with consuming the drinks that Will had very generously kept sending over to the table (‘on the house, lover boy’), that had seen Harry’s face become increasingly hard and angry.
Harry had point blank refused to listen whenever anyone (well, mainly Hermione) tried to raise it with him, refused steadfastly to believe the swirling rumours that Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater turned property tycoon, had recently bought out all the shops along this particular mews off Ladbroke Grove, including his own 'Bark of the Tree’. In fact, he'd been enjoying his state of deep denial right up to the moment the distinct sound of a man’s dress shoes clicking their way across the lovingly polished oak floorboards at five minutes to six on a January evening just as he was about to close up for the weekend shattered his determined optimism into a thousand dagger-sharp shards.
Even taking into account Potter’s proclivity for eccentricity, this is unusual behaviour that behoves Draco to tread carefully. He dithers for a moment because surely Potter, hopeless as he is, would be able to spot that he had a reptile digging into his skull. Those claws look unpleasantly sharp.
It seems nothing more is to be said on the matter of French fashion as Potter chooses to ignore Draco’s witticisms in favour of shoving his hands in his pockets and executing what can only be described as a not very subtle escape plan. Pansy coughs a cough that means business and Potter, showing some sort of instinct for self-preservation, comes to a reluctant halt within spitting distance of his escape hatch.
And then - oh no -it felt as if he’d been doused in ice-cold water. Harry wasn’t jealous of Draco. Of course he wouldn’t be jealous of someone like Draco. No. It was because he liked – what was his name again? Will. Yes Will. Well if that wasn’t just the story of Draco’s life, that Harry would like someone fit and toned and brash and dark and everything Draco wasn’t.
However, watching Malfoy desperately trying to keep his rage under wraps made all the hard work of counting out those knuts and the schlep out here to the arse end of nowhere feel like time well spent. Malfoy was clearly seething and doing a very bad job of hiding it, but then he always had been a terrible actor.
Harry thought how smiling suited Malfoy, the way it made his eyes shine. It lit him up from inside, turning him into a completely different person.
(Everything. He’s in Slytherin green for a start. And then there’s that mouth-watering triangle of smooth chest. Not to mention firm buttocks and thick thighs.)
“I’m not sure I’d call it romantic as such,” Pansy said, raising one perfectly sculpted brow. “But he is most definitely, deliciously hot.” Hermione whooped and high fived her before leaning back against Ron who was still alternating between scowling darkly at his pink raspberry cosmopolitan as if it had personally offended him, and prodding at the ice with grave suspicion.
Draco spins round. He opens his mouth, then closes it again. This happens several times before he’s able to speak. “Potter! Did nobody tell you that listening in on other people’s conversations is rude?”
“Again with the swearing.” Potter’s tone is mild but his eyes are dancing with amusement and – something else Draco can’t’ quite parse. “Good to know.”
“And what is that supposed to mean?” Draco snapped.
Grinning as he and the chair came to a halt in front of him, Harry felt Malfoy tear his eyes away from the hole he was boring into the side of Harry’s head to glare instead at the money bags. Harry thought he could see him counting to five (slowly) under his breath. And then counting all over again.
Not for the first time in his life, Harry thought how lucky he was to have such good friends because the last thing he needed right now was facing an inquisition. And coming a close second was going home to Grimmauld Place and facing an evening spent absolutely not reliving how it felt to have Malfoy’s solid and warm body pressed up against him.
“No,” Draco says sharply, just as Potter replies with a ‘yes please, Agatha, milk and two sugars.’
“Pansy, I think we’ve had enough drama for one evening. Come back to mine for a nightcap and I can change out of these filthy clothes.”
He looked at his friends, all loose-limbed and giggly and a wave of fondness filled his throat for a moment, making it hard to swallow. Pansy holding court and dressed tonight in a barely-there red silk slip dress always swore by a mojito, heavy on the rum, light on the soda water; Luna, the group’s self-crowned captain of chaos, loved anything sickly sweet and the pinker the better. Greg always chose a pina colada for reasons best known to himself. And Harry’s favourite was a negroni.
“Sorry,” he replies, crumbs spattering everywhere. Blaise carefully draws away and ostentatiously brushes an elegant hand down his trouser leg.
“I broke up with Ginny because of you,” Harry finally muttered. When he flicked his eyes up to settle on Draco’s, there was an angry flush from his cheeks down to the bit of skin where his shirt had come undone.
Draco licked his lips because he loved the hollow of Harry’s throat, so soft and kissable, and then the words registered with him. “What?” he yelped, incredulity flooding his voice. “What did you just say?”
Harry noted that while Malfoy was able to - just - keep his emotions in check, he seemed completely unaware of the way in which his eyes flicked from Harry’s face to the hollow of his throat where, in the right light, you could still see the faint bruising left there by sharp teeth, and then back up again. Harry’s skin prickled under the scrutiny. He felt he was being physically taken apart, piece by piece, and was disturbed at how good that made him feel.
“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he blurted out, and with that pronouncement, gone was the raised eyebrow, to be replaced with a tiny furrowing of a perplexed brow. Harry was just beginning to congratulate himself on a hard-won victory and had half come up with a joke about how frowning like that was a fast-track to wrinkles and crow's feet, when he caught the tail end of a blink-and-you-miss-it uptick of Malfoy’s mouth.
“Oh, I assure you it was no bother at all.” And there went that muscle in his cheek again.
“There’s nothing to discuss, Potter. It’s all in your head.” They glare at each other. “And for the love of all that’s holy, can you please keep your voice down. This is my place of work and a respectable establishment.”
Malfoy steadied him, gripping his bicep. "Weasley," he hissed under his breath and for a man who just a moment ago had been tugging Harry’s hair and whispering profanities against his ear, his reaction was impressively seeker-fast. One minute he was making Harry both melt and be harder than a man in his late twenties should be in his place of work, the next he was gathering up and shrinking down the money bags, cool as a cucumber. Finishing up, he scribbled out a hasty invoice, and then turned to Harry, face an inscrutable mask, breathing impressively back under control, hair in place, coat buttons magically and strategically fastened to conceal his groin from prying eyes.
Draco places the blame for how he’s feeling this evening squarely with Pansy and Blaise. He’d have been perfectly happy at home tucked up on the sofa nibbling on the batch of freshly baked focaccia and enjoying a glass of crisp sauvignon blanc. Instead, alas, the three of them have been drinking solidly for the last four hours in a club slash bar in Dover Street because Pansy has become increasingly vocal in her view that Draco (a) needs to get laid and (b) has got to stop talking about obsessively about Harry Potter before he drives her up the wall.
Pansy snorted inelegantly while watching Hermione who had clearly given up on trying to cheer Ron up in favour of rummaging through her capacious handbag. “Male model more like. Life model. I bet he’s very well endowed.” She ignored Draco’s squawk of horror, turning her dark-eyed gaze on him, pinning him to the spot. “Did you manage to catch his name or were you too busy eye-fucking each other?” The words sounded even more obscene when said with Pansy’s crisp enunciation and Draco couldn’t help but notice out of the corner of his eye how Harry had stilled at Pansy’s words.
“What?” Harry said, frowning, and seeker-fast snatched the coaster from Pansy, ignoring her ‘oi, give it back right now’. He stared at the number for a beat too long and then huffed out a laugh. “What sort of sleazy guy does that?”
“Be my guest.”
Luna takes a bite of her homemade marmalade and gherkin sandwich. Harry tries not to wince. “Do you want some advice?” He sighs. Luna’s advice can be a bit hit and miss but at this point he’s willing to give it a go. What does he have to lose? He can’t exactly go to Hermione, who’s taken to dramatic eye rolling every time Harry tries to raise the subject of his Bothering Draco campaign with her.
He began to think that perhaps Hermione’s intel, usually so accurate but on this occasion extracted after relentless badgering from Harry over a few beers and an ill-judged second bottle of wine around the same time the landlord rumours started, that Malfoy’s dating history was akin to that of a hermit was not entirely accurate if this cross-examination was anything to go by. Harry reckoned the average hermit shouldn’t be this familiar with bdsm practice.
“Well my darling, if you insist. I think it rather suits him to wear it tied back. It frames his face, showcases those cheekbones which are to die for.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes so hard it was a miracle they stayed in their sockets. “I see. How very - inconvenient for you.” Harry was pleased to see his sarcasm making an appearance bang on cue. Excellent. He offered Malfoy a bland smile as a reward.
On lifting it, he’s just in time to catch the way Pansy’s eyeing up Potter, like he's a morsel of foie gras on a piece of melba toast. “You’re single aren’t you, Harry?” she enquires, and in one fell swoop the pleased look is wiped off Potter’s face. Ha! See how you like being grilled by Pansy, Draco thinks with grim satisfaction. Pansy’s laser sharp stare is locked onto Potter now and Potter shifts in his seat, looking wide-eyed at Weasley, silently begging for an intervention, but his freckled friend has his head buried in a pint glass and fails to provide Potter with the support he’s so blatantly desperate for. “Well, then that’s all settled,” Pansy continues, not bothering to wait for a formal confirmation. “So now we’re all friends you won’t mind me asking about that article last year in the Prophet that said you had come out as bisexual after you split up with whatshername – Pippa? Penny?” God, she’s evil.
Fortunately, after what feels like several life times later, Potter finally stops torturing Draco and lets the robes drop to the floor in a soft puddle of fabric. Underneath he’s wearing what looks like a half decent pair of extremely snug fitting dark woollen trousers and a green dress shirt that fits just so. Draco makes a Herculean effort to drag his eyes away from Potter’s torso. He tuts and then worries he sounds like a prissy maiden aunt rather than a man in the prime of his life. “You can’t just leave your clothes lying there like that, Potter. I dread to think what your bedroom floor looks like if that’s how you treat your robes. Although it does help to explain why you always look so...” He flaps a hand in Potter's face.
“Morning, Malfoy,” Potter says cheerfully, and Draco looks up from his inventory before taking a sharp step backwards. There appears, unless he is very much mistaken, to be a – gecko – tangled in Potter’s more atrocious than usual (if such a thing was physically possible) hair.
Malfoy sighed. “You really are a complete arse, but then I expect you already know that.”
The growl Malfoy made deep in his throat cheered Harry up enormously.
Running a finger along his collection of luxury teas, purchased on a recent trip to Paris, he spontaneously selects the Lapsang Souchong Russian Caravan. It’s rich and smoky and makes Draco dream of decadent nights out in St Petersburg drinking vodka and eating caviar. Potter on the other hand likes treacle tart and cottage pie and builder’s tea with full fat milk and umpteen spoonfuls of sugar. He can’t help smiling. Potter will loathe it.
“Oh right. I thought after the other night that you were – I hadn’t realised that – well, yes, of course you don’t want to – uh – I wouldn’t want to keep you from – er.” Potter’s fumbling over his words and being very weird about a cat. After all he’s got an animal of his own, even if Alfonzo is a bit more scaly than your average pet, so he should know they shouldn’t be left alone for too long.
vocal views on the subject, he is entirely justified in complaining about Potter’s inexplicable and intolerable behaviour because Potter has clearly gone round the bend and is more than a tiny bit insane.
He lingers with Agatha, in no rush to face the wintry cold, running over for the last time what she needs to do when she opens up in the morning and then she bobs away into the evening crowd, turquoise beret helping her stand out until she turns the corner out of sight.
Draco’s warm-huffed laugh lifted a strand of hair that had worked its way loose from Harry’s bun.
“What would your boyfriend think of you getting up close and personal with your arch nemesis, hmm? Do you think Justin might want to duel me at dawn for daring to steal Harry Potter from underneath his very nose?”
“Nah uh,” Malfoy admonished, all hot breath whispering against Harry’s skin. “I do hope you’re not thinking of biting me, Potter?” Harry gave a minute shake of his head which was all the green light Malfoy needed to kiss his way open-mouthed along Harry’s jaw, and then into his mouth, easing it open and licking into it.
“No, I must insist. I do believe I’ve at least two bottles of brandy somewhere, a gift from Blaise last Christmas, so probably half decent although you don't strike me as a...But perhaps you'd prefer a soft drink. Soda water, a coke? Apple juice. No perhaps that's a bit - " He pulled a face. "Water. Still or sparkling? Or…”
Draco intervenes before they get an eyeful of Pansy’s brassiere. “Cat got your tongue Potter?” Potter splutters some more. It seems the Head Auror is a bit of a prude. “What a shame. Pansy here is I am sure positively agog to hear your further thoughts on the forthcoming Paris Spring collection.”
Was he having a heart attack? Draco wiggled a bit more, biting hard on his lip. Harry’s eyes dropped for a second and then flicked away. “I think it’s romantic too,” Draco said finally, taking a cautious sip of his drink, his eyes focused on the table. Christ, whatever was in this was strong and he took a moment to savour the burn of neat alcohol making its way down his throat while puzzling over why Harry’s gaze was burning a hole through his head.
“What the—?” Draco is inordinately pleased with the amount of spluttering. “You arse.”
“No need to sound so surprised, Pansy,” Draco muttered. “I’m not that much of a dating disaster.” He took care to not look at Harry as he spoke. Being horribly in love with Harry Potter since he was fifteen (um, maybe closer to thirteen) had been his best kept secret that not even his closest friend knew about, and Draco very much intended to keep it that way for the rest of his natural life.
Draco smirks. “Care for a biscuit?” Potter flinches as the snake’s tongue tickles him.
“Agatha? She was in Ravenclaw, several years below us. Whip smart, I suspect she’d even give your Granger a run for her money.”
Now it’s Draco’s turn to blink. “Not that it’s any of your business but Wilbur’s my fucking cat, you idiot.”
He could have happily have spent hours, days, forever just exchanging languid kisses but but there were silk shirts to untuck, and form-fitting trousers to unfasten, so soon his questing fingers were occupied with undoing a thousand tiny shiny buttons (‘seriously Draco’) and (‘careful, this is from Savile Row you heathen’), and wrangling leather belts from silver buckles in order to chase down warm skin he needed to have beneath his hands. Draco’s hands came to settle gently on Harry’s waist.
“To get away from you, yes, I am.”
“We’re helping Draco get over his broken heart,” Pansy says, eyes dancing and Draco wants to drown himself in the nearest beer barrel or if such a thing is too down market for a place like this, then a handily placed vat of gin will suffice. “He’s been awfully downhearted ever since Richard ditched him.” Draco’s pleading with her silently to just
Hadrian lost his blank look for one of fear. Closing the lid, Hadrian crawled back until his back hit the farthest wall from the boy.
, four servings, 35 minutes.
Placing a heavy hand on Harry's shoulder, and most likely ignoring his pained whine, the half-giant (there's no way that thing could be anything else!) "gently" pushed Harry out the door and away from Draco.
"Well, that seemed painful to say."
~~~~~fuckimadeHarryacompleteDOUCHEBAG~~~~~~
Dumbledore?
Anyway, ever since Harry's been getting these strange urges, that's seemed almost natural, if not a little underused. It hadn't really been that bad, so he saw no need to worry anyone. Then, over the summer, a voice came out of no one, speaking of memories and people that Harry had no business of knowing. Slowly, the voice beating getting louder and stronger until on the train to Hogwarts, during his nap, he was pulled into a sort of trancelike sleep and he finally met who the voice belonged to.
~Shhh, my little hatching, I'm here. I won't let them hurt you.~
Unluckily, it was Sunday, and so he had to prepare Sunday breakfast before they had to go to church, which was a whole different problem in itself.
Of course, to the outside world, he didn't look awake. Hadrian had had many years to learn to wake silently. It was only a matter of keeping his breathing slow and deep, emulating an unconscious person.
Draco Malfoy stood there in all his pure-blood glory, managing to glare while keeping his indifferent pure-blood mask. Behind him, were two very large boys, and their faces were replaced with flashes of Dudley's as he played with things (ohgodsburnspainnastysmell) he didn't understand.
And Harry quickly left, in search of It, and ignoring the feeling he had that he had just left It behind. Crying in the cold, dark dungeons.

Still wheezing, Hadrian looked up through watery eyes and saw Ron cornering Draco against the windows, and two older student with their wands pointed at the unconscious forms of the two boys who were protecting Draco.
Actually, Hadrian doesn't eat candy (other than liquorice wands, Hadrian will dual anybody for those), so he mostly gave it to Draco and Persephone to eat. Which is really strange once your think about since Persephone is a snake—
Aunt yelled up to him.
"Hadrian." she smiled softly and started walking forward.
He walked towards the door, and opened it.
As soon as they were out of her line of sight, they were gone.

But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him.
Turning swiftly, Hadrian practically slings Persephone out the open office door, ignoring her hiss of pain and anger.

The caption above the picture read something equally, if not more, shocking.
"Yeah."
The boy's face turned red (harry flitched, redredbloodohmygodstoomuch), and he spun around to face three boys.
"That's Hagrid." Harry snuck a glance at where Hagrid was trying to sneak some of his ice cream, and dropped his voice to a whisper, "I don't like him. He's loud and he trusts this Dumbledore person too much. It doesn't feel right, he kept saying Slytherins are evil, but when I looked up the houses it said Slytherins were ambitious and cunning. He doesn't trust you either, but I know you, or, at least your father. Can you help me?"
Running. He had to keep running. Harry didn't bother to look back, he knew Vernon wasn't chasing after him, he just had to make sure he didn't come back. He. Couldn't. Come. Back. No matter what Dumbledore said.
Doing the math in his head, Freak internally grinned when he realized he’d have time to spare after he was done cooking before Uncle and Dudley woke. All the dishes were relatively easy and fancy enough that Freak could pretend he was some famous chef about to serve his world-famous food to his rich clients.
He swore he could even hear someone shouting, begging in his head.

"OBLIVIATE!"
Hadrian smiled warmly.
Becuase Hadrian IS back. And he's never EVER leaving again.
Hagrid gave Draco a long considering look, then grinned and turned back to Harry, while Draco stared in shock. Did that giant oaf just try to scare him out of being Harry's friend…? Probably. Did it work…? No.
No...
Hadrian pushed himself up on weak limbs and heaved air into his aching chest.
"NOOOOOOOO—"
*Second Year*
Harry saw Malfoy try and fail to get angry, and in the end, tears started welling up in his eyes.
"Hogwarts too?"
~~~~~ohwowimsorryDraco~~~~
The small group was walking through the Hogwarts halls, letting Persephone's hissed commentary and instructions fill the silence and help them avoid anyone.
"Of… of course Headmaster. I will do it as soon as the dear boy wakes up and not a second sooner."
Hadrian remembered one of the Gryff's (Hadrian refused to accept that thing as something he had been. That thing had been created and temporary. Hadrian was here to stay) memories of waking up in the hospital wing with Dumbledore eating HIS candy.
*Third Year*
'Draco…. Persephone…. Dear merlin, what have I done?'
"Just a little blood? JUST A LITTLE BLOOD?! Hadrian Orion Potter, 'just a little blood' is when you prick yourself with a needle. 'Just a little blood' is when you scrape your knee. THIS ISN'T JUST A LITTLE BLOOD!" Draco fumed, worried about his new friend.
Harry's face twisted into a sneer, "Watch where you're going, Malfoy. Some of us don't want to sully our body with your filth. What? Got something to say, daddies boy? Or are you just 'going to tell you father' and hope he actually give a crap about you to do something about it?"
~Perse…. Persephone….~
"Talking"
Satisfied, Freak goes to ask Aunt if he can eat, when he remembers that on the first Sunday of every month, the kids of town get together to talk about the bible and what they could do to not sin (aka, not have parental guidance for two hours) and it was Dudley’s turn to bring snacks for everyone.
Let's see what makes Hadrian tic, shall we?

Freak got four plum tomatoes from the fridge, made sure they had some sourdough bread in the breadbox, grabbed an avocado and a lemon. He also swiped a handful of baby rocket leaves, just to be fancy.
"That will do."
A large man came to the door and screamed out Harry's name and he flinched.
Dumbledore shook his head, disappointment radiating from him.
Hadrian woke up in the hospital wing.
Without looking back again, Harry left, fighting back tears when he realized there was yet another person scaring away any potential friends.
And that was the moment ancient magic latched to his magical core and Harry Potter screamed.
Green eyes met silver.
Now, with Draco soon to be on his way, all Hadrian had to do was wait.
There was a pause of silence, as if the other person was fighting everything in her power to say something that at least resembles being respectful.
Watery green, meets washed out grey.
Harry doesn't know how long he is sitting there before he hears a whine above him.
They all just sat there, basking in each other's presence.
"But how?" Hadrian had been led to believe that the only people who could speak parseltongue was The Dark Lord, and, himself. That it was some big, bad curse that meant you were the darkest of wizards.
"Mama Pomfrey. It's nice to see you again. It's been a while." his voice was just as soft as his smile.
He scoffed, "That's what I thought."

With the hissed words, and gentle flicks of Persephone's tongue, breathing became easier, and sounds started becoming clearer.
"'Arry, what er you doi- oh. Er, hullo, little Malfoy. Yer, father ain't 'round, is he?"

"Nothing but a setback, my dear Nurse in Shining Armor, now, if you could be so kind as to call for Draco that would be lovely. Oh, and tell him to bring our mutual friend."
"Excellent!" Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. "Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real -"
(Potter, Freak, and Harry say hello)
“I find baking relaxing and, well it’s not that different to potions so long as you follow the instructions carefully.” Draco takes a neat bite and wonders if the raspberry is a little too tart. Next sugar next time, he thinks.
“Oh, come on.” Potter puts on a wheedling tone that might work with lions and badgers but certainly not snakes. “Surely you’ve got time for a quick drink.”
Surely Michael can’t be that thick-skinned?
"Well, seeing how well 'call my bluff' worked out, for next month's rent day I was thinking we could try strip poker.”
He swallowed hard. And then, demonstrating what Hermione liked to not-so-fondly call his lack of impulse control, without ever taking his eyes off his prey Harry gave in to whatever the hell was happening and moved predatorily around the counter, never once removing his gaze from Malfoy. Malfoy, like all bullies, immediately dropped his confident demeanour in favour of one resembling deep alarm, a look that only grew with every step that Harry took towards him. He started to protest, "Potter, what the hell do you think you’re –?" but Harry was on him before he could get to the end of the sentence, growling, “don’t even think about it, Malfoy, don’t even think about running away,” and grasping both of Malfoy’s slender wrists in one hand. There was a short and unseemly skirmish, involving quite a lot of pushing and shoving and cursing before Malfoy twisted free and in one fluid movement somehow had Harry pinioned against the desk, his wet mouth pressing against the pulse fluttering in Harry’s throat.
Green eyes blink in confusion. “Then who’s Wilbur?”
“Well I’m off in the opposite direction so I’ll bid you a good evening.”
But it didn’t mean that these nights out together weren’t some sort of exquisite torture, with the best saved for the last part of the evening, which was when - as part of an unspoken agreement between them - they took it in turns to escort one another home, shoulders brushing against each other, buzzing with alcohol, sometimes chatty, sometimes in comfortable silence; the silence of two people who had known each other more than half their lives.
“He’s – what? Potter, my boyfriend…Oh for the love of – he’s not – I don’t…as if I’d date someone who – “ Draco flails around under the scrutiny of two pairs of eyes, one bright green, the other sky blue. “You’re sacked,” he says wildly, wagging a finger in Agatha’s face, before flouncing away.
“What. The. Everlasting. Fuck. Are. You. Talking. About?” Draco’s voice had gone high and posh. “Do you mean to tell me-?”
Harry held his gaze as he took a long drink from his glass. He thought he might quite like to find out exactly what Malfoy was threatening to do to him. Especially if it involved spanking. And maybe handcuffs.
Draco is starting to suspect that appearances are deceptive and that beer is a lot stronger than it seems. The table is littered with empty glasses, and there’s a plate shining with grease and smears of what Potter tells him is tomato ketchup. His head feels like it’s filled with a swarm of angry bees.
The man, however, seemed pleased to have rendered Draco completely speechless. He shot Draco another of those grins that should come with a health warning, eyes twinkling as he leaned over the bar to murmur in a conspiratorial way, “I don’t think I’ve seen you here before. I’m sure I’d remember someone who looks the way you do.”
“Can’t you chew with your mouth closed?” Pansy crosses one long silk-stockinged leg over the other.
Well that, or he's fucked. Well and truly fucked. And not in a good way.
“Draco was livid.”
“But I digress.” (He ignored Malfoy muttering ‘now he uses long words’ under his breath.) “There I was thinking you’d grown up and become a better person than you were at school, but sadly, it turns out you’ve not changed one bit. You’re the same now as when you were pretending to be a dementor, or running to your father. Pathetic and a coward through and through.”
“Malfoy, Jesus. Don't make me break down this door.” Another thud makes the hinges grind ominously but they're holding firm. Draco is pleased to see that his new Potter-proof wards are so far standing up well to the barrage of heavy-duty door kicking.
Draco scowls. “Bloody Pansy and her constant matchmaking. I told her. I mean, she knows I - ” He stops himself just in time. Potter’s studying him closely.
He shot Harry a tiny smirk while mouthing ‘Keep your hair on’ but Harry didn’t smile. In fact, if anything, the expression on his face hardened.
Shooting Pansy a quelling glare, Draco turns to Potter, who sits there looking extremely smug. Assuming his best hoity toity voice, Draco moves to put Potter firmly back in his box. “I'm sorry to disappoint you, Potter, but we are absolutely not doing shots this evening. We’re having a private conversation here about things that are not for sharing so – can you please just buzz off and annoy somebody else.”
Draco deduced from the steady flow of complaints being muttered against a background of vigorous cocktail shaking about what a bloody disgrace it was that there was no beer on tap, and what the bloody hell was aromatic gin when it was at home, that Ron, for one, was determined to hate it with every bone of his body.
Harry carefully memorised the way Draco looked because he was never going to want to forget the results that judicious application of praise and tongue could achieve. The way Draco was hungrily running his eyes up and down Harry’s body made Harry suspect he might look equally as wrecked, only wearing slightly fewer clothes. Out of the corner of one eye he could see his boxers dangling from what he thought was possibly a floor lamp. The fact that an addition of a pair of pants improved its look spoke volumes for how ugly it was.
“Get out.”
Draco is going to fall out with Agatha before too much longer if she carries on like this. Potter’s call of “sounds delicious, make it two slices,” doesn’t make him feel any better.
Harry’s smile is blinding. “It would be rude to say ‘no’” and pressed a quick kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth. There was a tiny pause. “I’m very much hoping that Sex on the Beach might still be on the cards.”
There’s a moment or two of silence. “Quite the eventful night,” Pansy says, voice deliberately cool. Draco knows she’s holding back on his account. “Are you alright, darling?”
Draco watches the bubbles effervesce as Blaise pours. “Seen anyone you like this evening, Draco, someone who tickles your fancy?” Blaise lounges back in his seat, torso lean, skin glowing and attracting almost as much attention as Pansy tonight.
It was enough, it really was.
Draco still sometimes found it hard to reconcile Hermione Weasley Granger the legal hotshot with the Hermione Granger who had bonded with Pansy over their joint fixation with salacious celebrity gossip. His teenaged self would be pinching himself if he could have known how his adult self would be – of his own volition – friends with the Golden Trio and assorted disreputable hangers-on (Seamus, Dean and George Weasley to name but three off the top of head).
“You’re such an arse,” he says, but there’s no bite to it.
Thankfully unaware of Harry’s musings on the correlation between Malfoy insulting him in another language and how hard it made his cock, Malfoy continued to ruthlessly pursue his line of enquiry, seemingly using Harry as a dry run for if he ever decided to quit being an evil landlord in favour of joining the DMLE as their top interrogator.
Wilbur buts his head against Draco’s chin, as he lies on an overstuffed sofa listening to the sound of raindrop pattering against the window, trying to read but the words dance in front of his eyes.
“Excuse me a moment.” Draco stalks dramatically into the galley kitchen. Agatha, blithely oblivious to her impending doom, is neatly folding a chiffon scarf and humming cheerfully to herself. “What on earth do you think you’re playing at?” he hisses, careful to keep his voice low to avoid being overheard – he wouldn’t put it beyond Potter to be listening in. “Potter’s a menace and we should be discouraging him from turning up here uninvited.”
Draco’s finally taken a stand against Potter because it’s not doing his heart and nerves any good having Potter popping up unannounced all over the place, looking all – dark and brooding and a bit mean and moody. Which helps to explain the current thumping and banging that began just after nine o’clock this morning, accompanied by a string of really quite imaginative swearing. Draco’s charmed the sign so he knows it now says ‘If you can’t read this, a book shop is not for you. Try the toy store down the road.’
Malfoy’s face was alight with malicious glee. “As eloquent as ever, Potter. Good to know you’re still more than capable of mangling the English language. Plus ça change, plus la même chose.”
“Why on earth would Potter be asking after my cat?”
“I wasn’t bothering Agatha.”
Pansy, having faced Agatha’s wrath on more than one occasion, shudders and Draco smirks into his glass. For a tiny slip of a girl, Agatha can terrify even the bravest souls. Only yesterday she’d brandished (not without significant effort) a copy of ‘Mr Philpot’s Guide to Monster Hunting’ when Potter had breathed too heavily on one of the glass display cabinets. Draco had watched him dodge her aim with grim satisfaction.
Three hours later and Draco tumbles on top of crisp Egyptian cotton, head buzzing, the taste of brandy in his mouth. He absolutely does not dream of green eyes.
Bullseye.
Potter’s thoughtful look Draco’s way does something unpleasantly wobbly to his insides and he gives in to the urge and drops his head to the table for a moment while he rebuilds the spine he needs to get through the rest of this evening.
Potter looks pleased. “That way.” He points towards the Flask.
“What?” Harry, unable to keep up with Malfoy’s constant shifts in tone, was unhappy at how his voice wavered for a moment. “What the actual - ?”
The little girl dressed in yellow snaps her head up.
"Oh poor little Heaven, had no friends, so you had to turn to Looney of all people. We could have been your friend… we would have had fun together."
He casually looked at his nails again (Salazar what had Gryff done to his hand!) and drawled, ~Well, it'd be nice if I could have my snake back Dray.~
~I'm alright, Persephone. It's just a little blood.~
Since his head was still bowed, Harry didn't see Draco's large disbelieving eyes, nor did he see the suspicion at what he almost said.
"Then it looks like we're going," he growled.
But now he was out. Ha! Dumbledore thought he could break him?! Thought he could be there to pick up the pieces? HA!
Freak wakes up to the sound of Aunt banging on the door, snapping at him to hurry up.
Freak can afford to make rash decisions. He’s always three steps ahead with at least 2 alternate plans of something goes wrong.
His first enemy: Dumbledore.
, which he should be done with just as Uncle and Dudley wake.
They passed an empty classroom and heard voices inside. At first, they were going to keep walking, but then they heard what was being said.
Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out -
~~~~~imhurtingmyownsoulrightnow~~~~~~
Lee: You heard it here folks, the dark lord is in fact a butthead.
"Madam Pomfrey."
"It's a family gift. And I can understand any language, no matter how 'unique'. But, I can't speak them naturally. I have the ability to learn them, though."
A good thing too.
"Yeah," Hadrian whispers. "I'm back. And I am never leaving again."
Trying not to panic, Freak decides to make
~Come…come to me…Let me rip you…Let me tear you…Let me kill you…~
Tic toc, Dumbledore.
"Please! Please don't make me go in there! I- i'll do anything! Just PLEASE! DON'T MAKE ME GO IN THERE!"
He decided to start on the toast and muffins first, as those were for Aunt, who was awake watching some drama on the telly.
“Cheeky fucking bastard,” Harry muttered but not quite under his breath because Malfoy stiffened at the words.
Potter pouts and it’s not in the slightest bit endearing. “What? Oh, come on, Malfoy, it’s not late. Surely you’ve time for one more for the road.”
She hums, reaching for a rosemary and sesame crispbread.
“You’re on. Give me five minutes to lock up. See you there, yeah? And mine’s a Guinness if you’re buying.”
Draco edges even closer to the door. “It’s taking longer than expected. Come back again next year.”
There’s a look on Potter’s face Draco can’t quite parse. He raises his eyebrows, mouth stupidly smirking. “Bit presumptuous of you, Malfoy, seeing as how you haven’t even asked me out to dinner yet but good to know the rumours were true about Slytherins being easy.”
Hadrian smirked and studied his nails, at first, only to get a reason to look away from Mama's probing eyes, then he noticed the stress bitten nails and nail beds and he scowled before continuing with what he was going to say.
Looking back, Harry mouthed, 'I'll look for you on the train, last car.'
~NO! He will never forgive you if you do! Just go back to the girl's bathroom! I'll bring you some mice, and my Hatchlings friend will bring you something bigger!~
"You can't keep me here! I will get out!"
And think about Draco did. Draco may only be 11, but he wasn't oblivious to the scowls, hisses, and growls of 'filthy Death Eater Spawn', or worse, from men and women three times his age and size. But he was a Malfoy, and Father said Malfoy's don't get scared in public.
His first pet: a snake, Persephone.
He smiled just as softly and replied accordingly.
~~~~~~ohno!ibrokethepage!~~~~~~~~
~Please. You'd like my Hatchling! He's the kindest, more caring wizard ever. He would keep you locked up in the dark, nor would he treat you like an object. You'd be his family.~
"Nice to meet you."
“And bathe too! Don’t want you to disgrace us with your filthiness in the Lords house!”
Freak however.
Freak finished the buns with moments to spare. Just as he was taking the buns out of the oven, he heard Uncle coming down the stairs. Hurried, Freak set the sweets down then grabbed Uncle’s food from the toaster oven, carefully taking the food to wear Uncle sat.
It wasn't long.
~HATCHING!~
He looked at more pictures, desperate.
Well, dear readers, I'm wondering the exact same fucking thing. The reason it took me so long to get his chapter out was because I had no idea what to write after all that, so, I taking it back now Y'ALL
Freak hated the Lord’s house, or church, as most called it, for a lot of reasons.
'...Padfoot?'
For three long years, Hadrian's life was ripped from his control and he was locked in his own mind. He had come so close to breaking out before the start of the third year, but the emotional stress Sirius had experienced in his mind has loosened Hadrian's grip on the door to the point to where he fell back into his personal prison.
Hello! I told mother and father about how I met you, and they said I can invite you to stay with us for a while, maybe until a week before we leave for Hogwarts! What do you think?
~~~~~~~thinkHarry'llbemadatme?~~~~~~~~~~~
"Talking"
A little time later and the motherly women had breathed a frustrated sigh. Hadrian chose that moment to make his wakefulness known.
Tim: IT'S TOM RIDDLE, ALSO IT'S NOT TOM RIDDLE, IT'S VOLDEMORT!
Dark spells
Comparing Aunt’s demeaner to a snake, Freak mused, was entirely rude and unfair to the elegant creatures.
It took a few moments for him to answer.
Ripper found him.
There was a moment when Draco and Persephone froze, so still they could be compared to a statue. Then Draco flung himself onto the hospital bed next to him and clung to him, Persephone now long enough to wrap around the both of them.
You may have read this chapter and gone "What the fuck???? What about B E N"
, sweetie.
"Oh. Do you want me to teach you?"
"Cool, I'm Draco Malfoy, and you are?'
She hesitated, and then, rubbing her nose on Hadrian's tear trail, she shot across the car and wrapped her body around Draco's, hissing and snapping her jaws at Ron.
"What do you want Potter?"
When they pulled back enough, Persephone nosed their tear trails and hissed comforting words.
*First Year*
With a wave of his hand, Dumbledore open a door. A door Hadrian had sealed with most of his power, and his in a deep, dark corner.
Dumbledore smiled.
Ron attacking him on the train. Hermione calling him ignorant and arrogant. Dumbledore stalking him. Watching, always watching. Jinxes and hexes coming from unidentified sources. Howlers screaming of his shame. A family of red hair and face screaming at each other, on opposite sides on a personal war. Dumbledore obliviating him. The snake he's seen comforting a downcast Draco. All the hateful words he's spewed at Draco and his other Slytherin friends. Him ignoring ben, and looking down on Heaven.
And Harry did. And the dog dove into his memories, abet a bit roughly.
Sirius Black tore himself from Harry's mind and ran.
Relieved, Freak continued cooking, letting himself rely on muscle memory.
Not as confident without the back up of older students and with a very angry snake hissing at him, Ron run as well.
Hadiran hesitated in his struggles.
"Well, Potter?"
, 2 servings, 30 minutes.
"YOU FILTHY SNAKE! I BET YOU WONT BE SO TOUGH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVINE!"
Then Madam Pomfrey walked in grim faced. Her face said what she didn't want to.
Took a LOOOOOOOOOONG time to get this chapter out, I literally have no excuse other than I had no inspiration for this fic. Also, SORRY NOT SORRY
Freak knows there’s something wrong with him, the words sociopath often echoes in his brain. But no, that’s not what he is. He’s something
Draco had gotten taller, and had stopped slicking back his hair, thank Merlin. He filled out a bit more, and from looking through Gryff's memories, Draco had joined the Quidditch team as a Chaser and reserve Beater. All in all, he looked good.
Harry quickly looked down again, his voice small.
Because Freak
But worse than the last time Hadrian saw him. It didn't seem like he smiled a lot, he was paler than normal, and he had a rumpled look to him.
Draco puffed out his chest in pride.
At his thought, every thought that consisted of the man came to rest in front of the "fugitive".
"Of course I can!"
Ignoring his snarling stomach, Freak gave one sharp nod, then about-faced before marching upstairs.
Lee: So, here on Potterwatch, we managed to get an exclusive interview with the Dark Lord himself!
It all started last year after Harry met that dog (who turned out to be his escaped convict godfather who turned out to be innocent) and he passed out not far enough from Uncles house.
Just as soon as the damage from the memories were finished, they fled behind a door, which locked and the key landed in a wrinkled old hand.
At least he would have if he hadn’t already been awake for two hours 46 minutes and 16 seconds.
, four servings, 40 minutes.
Hadrian's small frame started shaking and his mouth opened and closed, desperately wanting to start apologizing, but not knowing what for. And if he didn't respond Vernon would get Red and angry and it meant painpainpainithurtspleasestophurtshurts-
"I said this is where Death Eaters and Slimy Slytherins sit. Why. Are. You. Here."
~~~~page break~~~~~~
"NO! I will not get re sorted into Gryffindor! I will not befriend Weasley and Granger! I will not get rid Persephone! And I will not let you ruin my life any longer!"
"Madam Pomfrey," ugh, merlin, you could hear the twinkle in his voice, "If you could be a dear and alert me to when Harry wakes up, that would be greatly appreciated."
The dog lets out a soft bark and nudges Harry's closed eyes with his snout.
Himself. At that point, Harry was terrified something like what happened to Ginny second year and as soon as he woke up he told Ron and Hermione. They had shared a look and told him to go to Dumbledore as soon as he could.
"Would you?"
, six servings, 30 minutes.
~GET TO DRACO. PROTECT HIM. TELL HIM TO FORGET ME AND I'M SORRY!~
"I apologize, my boy. I didn't want to do this, but…."
His first—
With the creaking of the unused door, came the screams of pain, angry bellows, falsely accusing whines, and the sounds of pans hitting skin. The Dursleys.
"Of course."
Freak knew what was happening wasn’t okay in the slightest. He wasn’t stupid. With no friends, all Freak had was books. He knew it wasn’t his fault and he knew it shouldn’t be happening. He knew an adult should help him.
Just as he thought that, another door appeared. This one was a soothing green and silver, a cool contrast to the glaring red and gold that was attacking Sirius' senses.
Fred (on helium): Thank you Lee, may I say, for the record, I am a massive butthead.
Pain sprung up behind his eyes, as if someone was pounding on his head.
I suck at updating and I always have new story Ideas...some I can't stop myself from writing. Speaking of! I am planning on writing a trilogy of self inserts, each book will be a different Anime and until I finish those, all my other works will be on a Hiatus! Sorry everyone.
~Pro-~ another horrible coughing fit. ~Protect… Draco. Please.~
Draco lifted his nose in the air, "Are you with muggles? Has my father met your muggle father?"
So, my characters are different. The Malfoys are nicer and actually act like Slytherins. Even though this is a Dark slytherin Harry, doesnt mean that he's gonna be buddy buddy with Tim Riddle.
Lee: Voldy, I gotta say, it's an honor.
Harry doesn't quite have Multiple Personality Disorder, it's more like his way of coping with what's happening to him. But it may become that later on.
Harry ran down the halls, trying to see where the voices were talking for two reasons. One, somebody was trying to kill someone. And two, the second voice… the female one sounded familiar. So familiar and safe and so warm he ached for it.
"The real question is… what are you doing here, weasel...y"
"Dumbledore's coming."
Freak shook himself, stopping that line of thought before even an inkling of it could escape.
Mama scowled and huffed before going to her office to do just as he asked, but not without muttering complaints of: "insolent brat… lucky… better be glad I love him…."
The sudden words made Draco jump. He had forgotten about the snake wrapping around him.
"The Hogwarts champion," he called, "is Cedric Diggory!"
She jumped and had her wand pointed at the boy in an instant, before calmly putting it away and running her hands down the front of her robes in a nervous gesture.
Heeeeeeeeeeeeee's Baaaaaaaaaaaaack
Draco's eyes widened in fear. "WHAT IS THAT!?"
"You see, Harry. I just don't believe that. I wish I could, I really do, but I learned my lesson long ago." his eyes hardened, hate springing up behind his normal twinkle, "Never. Trust. A. Slytherin. Goodbye, Harry."
"YOU UNGRATEFUL FREAK!"
In all honesty, his headaches were probably from the little person in his head.
Hadrian scowled, his eyes deep and enraged.
Sirius Black stood in the middle of a room, covered in Dumbledore and Ron and Hermione and Gryffindor. Nothing looked out of place, but it felt wrong. From the look of his godson from the outside world, this room should be chaos. This didn't seem like his prongslet.
Hadrian looked up from his work with a frown.
~~~~page break~~~~~~
'Thinking'
Automatically, Freak went into Attention. Uncle had sent him to a military camp last summer to get him out of the house and he was told to behave like he was still there. His feet were should length apart, his hands clasped in the middle of the back directly above the tailbone. His head was straight ahead, staring at a fixed point in front of him. He was completely still.
~parseltongue~
"Mr. Potter."
Images attacked him everytime he blinked. Getting sorted into Slytherin. Draco getting chased around the yard by peacocks when he interrupted the birds' time with harry. Narcissa petting down his hair after a particularly bad night terror. Lucius letting Hadrian "read" greek mythology to him while he worked when his anxiety kept him from sleeping. His first christmas with the Malfoys. Blaise confiding to Hadrian about how vampires live and shamelessly flirting with him. Pansy always playing with his hair. His hufflepuff, Heaven, sitting eating with him the kitchens when the noise was too much. Ben always complaining about why their animal is a eagle when they are Ravenclaws. The twins snuggling with him when Hadrian didn't, couldn't get out of bed.
The first picture shocked him. It was of eleven-year-old Harry, and another boy. A blonde-haired, grey-eyed boy. They were standing in a shop, getting fitted and talking. It seemed normal until Malfoy Jr. glanced over Harry's shoulder with an expression of fear. Soon Hagrid was in the picture, looking bigger and more intimidating than ever. And that's when Sirius saw something that really shocked him. Hagrid was imposing on purpose!
"Padfoot?" Harry rasped out.
"Draco… are. Are you okay?"
, and that’s destroying him.
I'm so sorry
Maybe he does think he’s helping, Freak muses. The human mind is absolutely fascinating. One thing Freak loves to do is pick people part little by little, learning how they tic and how to stop them from doing so.
It's forth year and becuase of a stupid senile old artifact, Hadrian is stuck in the Triwizard Tournament. But, its not all bad news.....
“Well, seeing as how you and Potter are engaged in a strange sort of battle of wills that seems to have reached an impasse for the time being because you are both actual children, I’ve got someone to introduce you to. He’s a chap Millie thought you might like, one of her buyers and she tells me he’s a real high flier, very ambitious and terribly good looking if you like your men tall and dark.” She shoots Draco a look daring him to deny it. His jaw snaps shut.
Draco shoots him a glare. “Of course he’s bothering me, Blaise. I don’t want him constantly in my shop, people will start to think I’m up to no good, and he’s also – distracting in that uniform looking all…” He breaks off, unsure how to finish that sentence.
Pansy meanwhile is looking delighted at Potter gatecrashing their get-together, the cow. She runs her eyes up and down his torso. “Nice shirt. Draco, don’t you agree?” He’s going to fucking kill her and chop her body up into tiny pieces and leave them out for the crows.
Harry stared down at his shoes, a frown on his face. They were brown (ye gods), scuffed beyond repair and had clearly never seen the bristles of a polishing brush so Draco could well understand why he might be a bit ashamed at the state of them.
Draco chooses to ignore him in favour of turning to shoot daggers at Pansy, who’s looking like all her Christmases have come at once. Luckily for her (short-term) survival the waiter returns bearing a tray filled with bottles and glasses. He’s greeted with whoops and cheers. Even Weasley seems to have perked up at the sight of neat alcohol.
Draco wets his lips, eyes flicking from Harry’s throat down to his shoes and back. Potter tracks the movement and Draco's careful to avoid eye contact when he next speaks. “Nothing at all, if you were five beers to the good in the Leaky and thought that silage was a good look on anyone under the age of ninety.”
“You might still be a child, Potter, but some of us have long since left the playground behind.” Draco picks up speed in an effort to shake off his shadow but Potter drops in to easily match Draco’s stride.
Draco’s not really paying close attention to Agatha as she chatters on about Potter’s weird obsession with his cat, and bites down on a lemon crisp. Next time, he thinks, a little more zest and five minutes longer in the oven.
Harry dragged his focus back to Malfoy who to his regret was demonstrating a real talent for blathering on.
“Interesting,” he says eventually.
Young people today have no respect for their elders. “You’re being ridiculous, Draco, and behaving like a sulky teenager instead of a grown man. You can’t keep yourself barricaded in here, it’s stupid, and not conducive to making any money.” She makes a shooing gesture.
She offers him one of her rare genuine smiles. “Well, it would be rude to say no. I could call Blaise and see if he’s free to join us.”
“That, as it happens, cost more than your entire vault.”
“Weasley,” Blaise booms. “Just the chap. Grab a pew.”
“Harry.” Potter leans in as though Draco is hard of hearing. “Harry. I want you to call me Harry. If Pansy Parkinson, who sold me out to Voldemort, can do it, I’m pretty sure you can.”
In actual fact, Draco
Draco blushed some more.
“That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever Potter. Harry. But if you insist.”
Harry helpfully gestured at the painting, spilling half his brandy on the desk, not sad to see it go to waste. Malfoy’s look hardened as he followed the direction Harry was pointing in before fishing out his wand. A brusque ‘tergeo’ and the spillage was siphoned back into Harry’s glass.
Draco wiped the slightly soppy look he knew was on his face and stirred his drink, careful to not make eye contact with Harry, whose eyes, he could feel, were still boring into him, hot and angry which was doing something uncomfortably deep in his belly. Like coils of molten steel.
“Are you quite done there, Malfoy? You might be a sad lonely git but some of us have lives to be getting on with.”
The tone of his voice made Draco’s jaw clench.
The smile was more leer than cute now. Draco cursed his Malfoy genes as another wave of heat flushed over him.
Potter shoots him a pouty grin before poking at the biscuit selection with a calloused forefinger and selecting a particularly coconutty one. “Mmph,” he says around a mouthful, a small scattering of crumbs missing the plate and landing heaven only knows where. Draco shudders. “This is – er…” Potter catches Draco’s eye and tries to drag an adjective from what pretends to be his brain “Delicious. Really delicious. Are these from that new bakery in Diagon Alley, what’s it called?” He mulls it over for a second. “Ciel Et Terre?”
Potter is momentarily distracted, busy as he is hissing softly at his cup. “Stop that right now,” Draco demands, and he jumps guiltily. “Can you please desist in harassing my tea service.”
Harry said nothing for a long moment, face inscrutable and Draco’s euphoria is replaced with panic, fearful that he’d read this all wrong.
“Yes. Well. He’s an excellent kisser, for one,” Harry heard himself saying. Out loud. For the love of Merlin, why? He was about to bang his head hard and repeatedly on the counter when he noticed Malfoy’s hands, hovering over another moneybag, abruptly still. “Really, really excellent,” Harry said, keeping a close eye on Malfoy, watching carefully for any further signs of discomfort. Sadly though, Malfoy seemed to have got his emotions back under control and instead of backing down as Harry’d hoped, he chose to lean right in, eyes diamond bright. Harry could smell expensive cologne. It made him feel breathless and had to close his eyes for a moment.
When Harry, fully sated and more than little sticky, was finally able to lift his head from Draco's shoulder, shining grey eyes met green. Draco looked thoroughly debauched, his fair hair dishevelled and sticking up all the place, a once pristine thousand galleon shirt hanging open to show off a smooth but mottled chest covered in already blooming bruises, trousers bunched around his ankles, lips swollen and plump.
“I heard that.”
“Alright there gorgeous? Need some help in deciding? The voice matched the appearance perfectly, smooth and sultry but Draco was still trying to absorb the fact a complete stranger had described him as ‘gorgeous’.
