Draco rushed over and snatched his journal from his desk, throwing it in the general direction of his bedroom "Excuse you, that's private" he hissed.
Harry stepped into the moonlight and smiled sheepishly "Sorry to disturb you" he said hiding something behind his back.
Draco couldn't help but burst into laughter "I did warn you" he said, taking another sip from his glass.
Draco put his now empty glass on the table and crossed his arms "You're full of it, it's not polite to joke about such things" he said.
He groaned and ran his hands through his hair, he had to know him. He had to at least be friends. Yeah that was good, friends. That had to be good enough, he'd get Harry to be his friend. Even though that didn't work out well the first time, they we're adults now and Harry didn't seem to hate Draco anymore. Draco decided that he was worth any risk. He had waited 15 years for even a splinter of a chance and he wasn't about to let Harry escape from him now. He had to know his options.
Harry looked around frowning at the dishevelled and just woken Draco "You... You didn't hear that?" he asked, confused.
"Draco!?" he asked worriedly, when there was no answer Harry stepped back "Alohomora" he cast and opened the door "Draco are you okay!?" he asked looking around and finding Draco looking at the half naked Harry standing in the doorway.
Harry frowned at the remark before making his way back to his rooms. He bit his lip and paused outside of his door. He was still fired up from being angry at Draco. He decided he was going go and get some frustration out by flying for a bit. He made his way in and changed out of his nice robes and into something more suitable for flying. As he left he asked a house elf to fetch his broom for when he got to the fields.
"Of course he's always been devastatingly gorgeous, but in that moment he was glowing. He looked like an angel" he said, Harry didn't really care about being embarrassed anymore. It felt good to finally tell the truth about how he felt. To Luna and to himself. "If I'm being honest, I've always been attracted to him. Of course I never acted on it before as he was an insufferable git but now? He's different. Or maybe he's not, maybe this is the Draco Malfoy I could never see but was always there beneath the prejudice and fear" he theorised.
After a few minutes Harry transfigured something into a chair and sat in front of Draco. Not that he was paying attention.
Harry nodded "I was trying to pretend it didn't happen but he was acting so strange and I couldn't keep from worrying. When he didn't show up for dinner I asked around the house elves. I learned something that... Honestly scared me by how much it made me fall for him" Harry admitted.
Luna hummed melodically and swung their hands together as they walked down the halls "You know, no matter what happens here, Hogwarts will still be beautiful. It just had this warm, gentle energy that welcomes you" she said distantly before pausing "Like gravy" she added.
Draco seemed to struggle before nodding "Yes well I'm glad, it looked like it's been a rough day" he said.
"Don't believe everything you read Malfoy" Harry said coldly before walking past him and into the school. He had no intention of dragging up the past and could certainly work alongside Malfoy with ease. But that didn't mean he wanted to speak to him any longer than necessary nor did he want to talk to him about his decisions.
Luna hummed, focusing on the card, her lips began to move wordlessly and the entire room got a little blurry. As if Harry and Luna were now in a separate state. Finally Luna looked back up, light dancing behind her eyes in amusement. "I knew it" she said, almost giggling as she did.
Harry enjoyed seeing Draco's jaw clench at the use of their usual greeting. Harry nodded and put his hand on Luna's a few times and kissing her cheek every now and then as they talked and ate breakfast enjoying the small reactions from Draco. After Minerva dismissed us when we gave her our lesson plans Draco quickly and swiftly left the Grand Hall and Harry smirked triumphantly. Serves you right, prick.
Harry smiled a little, if he didn't know any better he'd think that Mr Malfoy was jealous. Of course that was impossible, but the thought was too tantalising to ignore. Harry nodded and leaned against the wall "I did thank you, she's quite marvellous company. I was helping Luna look for her shoes and we had a nice conversation about Hogwarts" he said watching Draco's expression sour.
Harry cursed himself when Malfoy heard him close the map, damn man has hearing like a bat. And when he sat beside him he couldn't help but watch Draco. His white hair silver in the moonlight, and porcelain skin practically glowing. He hadn't felt anything like this in years. He almost held his hand.
Harry flinched ever so slightly "Yes" he admitted, voice tight "I did actually want to kiss you. Did you? Both then and a few minutes ago" he returned.
He heard Harry take a few more steps before stopping in front of him "May I join you? Nowhere else catches the moonlight softly like the courtyard" he asked in a small voice. It wasn't a voice Draco would have imagined coming from the legendary Harry Potter but it oddly suited him quite well. It was a nice reminder that Harry is still a regular wizard with limitations.
Merlin he looked good, his hair was just a tad messier than normal, he wore a light robe open to show a deep green button up shirt, black waistcoat and black suit trousers. Harry shook his head and regained his composure just before the blonde looked over at him.
When Scorpius turned ten, he sat down with his son and told him the same story that his mother had told him. Draco warned him to guard his heart, to be careful. He explained that while he had found happiness with Astoria, he was actually gay and so while he loved Astoria, he had never been
He looked back at Harry once more, seeing that the love had eased, his smile a little sad around the edges before Harry turned to move back into the woods, leading them back to the manor for lunch.
"It happens occasionally, particularly with rituals, we get one every couple of years where two wizards end up having a baby together. I'll get some of the literature together for you and owl it over." She smiled, reaching out to shake their hands in stunned silence.
“How can you be so sure?! The curse took Astoria when it shouldn’t have. How can you be sure that you are safe?! I can’t find you dead Harry. I won't survive you dying. Don’t make me watch you die!” Draco’s breath caught, a sob choking him.
"Was broken." Harry finished. "The curse was broken, and magic blessed us with a child to seal the breaking."
Rhododendron for faith, innocence, and purity. Faith that they could defeat the curse, the innocence and purity of the children. He hoped to maintain that for them, to help his children go forth without the burden he bore.
Draco soon found himself apparating Harry home, the pair sinking onto the couch in the sitting room and staring into space as they tried to process this new development. Draco struggled to suppress the instinctual terror that curled through him at the thought of Harry being pregnant. The curse had already taken Astoria when it shouldn’t have. What was to say that it still wasn’t in effect, that it wouldn’t claim Harry. He loved Harry with everything he had, their children filling their lives with joy and wonder. The thought of having to go through life without Harry at his side, their child in his place was an unendurable agony.
“I heard you call, so I came. Hallet was finishing up the ritual when I arrived. You and the children were all out of it. So he and I took Scorp and Cassie back up to the house and put them to bed. James, Albus and Lily are all up there, waiting for them to wake.” Harry paused, flushing before continuing in a rush. “Hallet suggested that a good way to finish off the ritual would be for us to remain here, to… well… consummate things as the final banishment of the curse. I’ve been waiting for you to wake.”
Draco had been inducted into the art of sex and skating by one of the senior skaters, Philippe, once he turned 16. The man had been thorough in his education of Draco, though the marks of his affection left scars on Draco’s heart that he refused to acknowledge. Since being with the man, Draco had never bottomed again. He was an exclusive top, as his father had clearly told him that even if he was a faggot, he at least shouldn't take it up the arse like some pansy. It had been devastating at the time to have his father speak like that to him, but over the years, Draco had become numb to it too.
James was seated to the right with Albus and Scorpius next to him, Cassie and Lily were on his side of the table. It was already heavily laden with the makings of a full continental breakfast. Harry flipped one last pancake, depositing it on a towering stack before moving the whole lot to the table. Draco hurried over, settling in the indicated spot.
The years slipped by and he found happiness. Draco had everything he could hope for and more. He had gained a best friend and a life partner. Scorpius was perfect, in the absolutely imperfect way that children were. He and Astoria both took lovers on the side occasionally, but their friendship remained a solid base for their lives. When their lovers grew frustrated over their unwillingness to leave a sexless marriage for the sake of their son, the lovers would leave. It didn’t bother them over much, it worked for both Draco and Astoria, and Scorpius didn’t know any different, not that either ever allowed any of their lovers to interact with their son.
He felt a mild flutter of alarm in third year when they had a class on hippogriffs, somehow, when Hagrid had hoisted Potter onto the beast, he had ended up backwards, flying around the school. Draco reminded himself that Potter didn’t fit the rest of the criteria, so dismissed the worry, accidentally getting himself hurt in the process.
"There was an unforeseen side effect to the ritual you went under to break the curse." Harry sighed again, a smile curling his lips. "Magic has blessed me with another child. I am pregnant."
They made sure to write into their marriage contract that once an heir had been produced, fidelity was not required. When Astoria fell pregnant two years after their wedding, they both breathed a sigh of relief.
“She’s dead isn’t she?” He was surprised at how calm he sounded. Coldness spread out from his heart, numbing his hands.
Flowering red currant for the life and nourishment it represented. It was a hardy plant, strong enough to resist the curse. It offered a food source for spring fauna, allowing new life to spring forth.
Harry blinked in shock, settling back on his heels, a furrow forming in his brow. “Actually, I have had some success. I spoke with Bill the other week, he specialises in Egyptian curses so couldn’t help, but referred me to someone else he knew through Gringotts that specialises in personal curses. I was in the process of getting the confidentiality agreement set up for you. I have the standard one from Gringotts if you would like to look at it?”
Draco had been skating for his entire life, he had been born into it with his prima ballerina mother and figure skating father. His first memories were of being on the ice, his father relentlessly pushing him to do more, to be better, to go again. He had been shaped, over years, into a sculpture, the Prince of the Ice.
WARNING: there is discussion of abortions in this. One does not happen, not are they described, but there is a strong theme running through the chapter. If you don't want to read that, I recommend imagining your own fluffly ending instead.
They had been a few years apart at Hogwarts. Daphne, the eldest and heir to the family had been in his year. He had helped Astoria over the years as a prefect and with her homework as a fellow Slytherin. They had gotten along relatively well, as well as he did with anyone else from his house.
His eyes stopped on Harry, who was lingering by the gap where they had entered the glade, his expression filled with love and affection. Draco was unable to resist the blush that crept up his cheeks. His heart yearned to take the other man in his arms, to profess his love, but fear kept him back. Fear that the curse would take something this precious from him when he was so close to having it. Fear that he would take James and Albus and Lily’s father away from them.
Lucius had told her the old story after they had wed and were trying for a child. He had thought it an amusing anecdote, but Narcissa was a Black, and Black’s knew the power of scorned women, knew the power of blood. So, she searched through the Malfoy family histories and found an alarming truth. One of every generation was cursed, irrespective of gender, their partner would die after producing an heir.
Slipping out of his chair, he knelt in front of Harry, who was crouched on the ground, and threw his arms around the other man. A sob wracked his body as Harry held him tightly, stroking his hair and murmuring sweet nothings into his ear.
"I count 16 glasses, I don't know how he is still standing…" Draco murmured in reply, watching worriedly as Potter chugged one more glass of champagne before setting it roughly down on the table and turning.
“They don’t hate us, sweetheart. We just make them a little nervous.” She paused, looking out of the window of Draco’s playroom. “It began with your ancestor, Maria. She fell in love with a muggle, and when she was found out by the local villagers to be an unwed, pregnant witch, she was banished to a lonely island off the coast of France.”
Afternoon tea had been served and everyone settled in the loungeroom to catch up for a little while.
“Thank you, Minerva.” He looked down, seeing Albus hovering uncertainly at the edge of their little huddle. “Al, will you help Scorp? Minerva, lead the way.”
Hallet had owled him and asked if there were many trees on the property, that he was hoping there might be a glade they could use. He had provided a list of nine woods that would be needed for the sacred fire and asked if Draco had them.
“Yes please.” There was no accusation in Harry’s voice, just patience for which he was eternally grateful.
Draco couldn't wait to see how they would all react when they discovered that their family was whole. He didn't want to think too hard about what Scorp and Al were going to get up to.
With a shaking hand, Draco lifted his hand to card his fingers through the unruly locks. Harry jerked up at his touch, expression a mix of relief and fear.
It was the middle of November during Draco’s first year. He had been settling in well with his house mates and classes, the only sore spot was his continued animosity with Potter. He had only ever wanted to be the other boy’s friend, had been looking forward to meeting him for so long. But then Weasley had gotten in the way and everything had been ruined. He couldn’t help but try and gain his attention any way he could, even if it was negative, it was better than nothing.
Draco nodded and smiled at the empty praise, keeping his expression vacant and pleasant. He accepted his Grand Prix Final gold medal for France with the grace that was expected. It was so easy to go through the motions, his mind no longer needed to participate. He was a slate and the only writing on him was from his father and mother. Draco didn’t even know what he would write, even if he had the freedom to do so.
Draco then smirked, is Harry trying to make him jealous? Merlin that would be the dream. It wasn't the case however, Harry was straight and as far as Draco was concerned and was in no hurry to be interested in anyone. Draco sighed and looked up at the sky, he frowned seeing a flash of black zoom across his peripheral vision. He stood up and tried to get a better look at the flying object.
Harry shook his head and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck "Just give me this one evening, just one night where I don't have to be Harry Potter - the boy who lived. I just want to be Harry. Just one night" he almost begged. He finally had something worth hanging on to, even for only a night.
Harry sat in the shower, hot water pelting down on him like searing knives. What the hell had he done? Did that really happen last night? Harry felt disgusted, he had practically forced himself on Draco. It started out as a joke, it really had, it was fun to watch Draco squirm. However nothing he said was anything he hadn't thought about before, and the more Harry looked into his piercing eyes... The way Draco looked back at him... he shuddered and hugged his knees tighter to his chest.
Draco's eyes burned as tears filled them "Promises of a better life, a life I've always wanted but could never have, it's cruel and painful" he said, so quietly that Harry probably wouldn't have heard him if he weren't so close.
Surprisingly the Gryffindor reacted immediately, putting his hand on Draco's cheek and kissing him back. It felt amazing, soft and slow and sweet. Exactly what Draco always wanted but could never have.
Draco shook his head "Because you have to be, Harry Potter - The pride of Gryffindor - could never be interested in Draco Malfoy, not even in a parallel universe" he said, as if stating a fact.
Draco smirked a little "What's that look for?" He asked curiously as he handed one of the mugs to Harry.
Finally when he looked as if nothing at all happened yesterday, Harry had decided on his game plan. He's going to act as if nothing did happen yesterday. If Draco didn't bring it up that meant either he'd been too drunk to remember or he didn't want to acknowledge it, both worked for Harry.
Draco groaned internally, why did he have to be so cute? So wonderful? So perfect? Draco shook the thoughts from his mind and nodded "Yes well I'm glad, it looked like it's been a rough day" he said. He needed more of his drink to deal with all these thoughts and emotions but he also didn't trust what he might say without any inhibitions.
Draco felt his face heat up, no doubt he was blushing, and shook his head "You're drunk" he said, pushing away the fluttering in his chest.
Draco's heart fluttered "Try not to sound so surprised Potty, I'm not completely useless" he said teasingly.
Harry softened and nodded, the air of razor sharp broken glass around him turned to his regular sad emotional wall. "It's fine, I should deal with my PTSD better" he said quietly.
Luna shook her head "You definitely aren't going to like it. Though he told me to draw the next card before I tell you" she said before pouring the last two shots.
A light knocking roused Draco from his slumber. He groaned as he slowly sat up, climbing out of bed. He rubbed his eyes and shuffled over to the door, opening it to see a disheveled Harry looking back at him.
"There's nothing to be sorry for. I won't leave you again" Draco promised. Harry nodded and held tightly onto the man who clearly cared a great deal about him.
Draco smiled a little and nodded "I guess you're right, this drink however is more of a gift than anything else. I don't often share things so dear to me" he said turning the running water off and stirring the now dissolved sugar into the diluted drinks. Once he was satisfied he handed one of the glasses to Harry "You're going to want to sip this Potty" he said affectionately. Harry tentatively took the glass but scoffed and took a big swig. Draco cringed "First of all that was terribly uncouth, secondly you're going to regret that" he said taking a small sip from his own glass. It was as delightful as he'd remembered.
Draco shook his head "I'm serious Harry, what is this?" He asked, using his hand to gesture to the two of them.
"So all that unspoken tension between us as teens, never kept you up at night? Wondering why we affected each other so much?" He continued to press the subject.
Harry held in a whine that was building up in his throat and leaned even closer "So all that unspoken tension between us as teens, never kept you up at night? Wondering why we affected each other so much?" He continued to press the subject. Come on, admit it.
Harry shook his head and waved his hand dismissively "No need, I'm of perfectly sound mind" He said, sounding completely serious.
Neville smiled warmly at him and absently played with Hannah's hand "Morning Harry" he greeted in his regular cheery demeanor.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and looked down. Draco smiled at him, Harry was cute when he was being bashful, it almost made up for his arrogance. He would never have told anyone however but safely in his mind he could admit that there was a lot to admire about Harry.
The night followed on just like that, pleasant conversation between coworkers and a few chuckles and smiles from Harry that made Draco almost giddy to see. After they had made their way through just over half of the bottle Draco bid Harry a goodnight and made his way back to his rooms.
Harry began to calm down and nodded, letting Luna help him up. They made their way out of the astronomy tower and back to Harry's rooms.
Malfoy nodded and smiled his usual charming smirk "Of course Minerva, I think it's safe to say petty childhood squabbles were left behind after... After the war" he said the last part rather uncomfortably, Harry could understand that, it wasn't a fond memory for anyone.
Harry shook his head and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck "Just give me this one evening, just one night where I don't have to be Harry Potter - the boy who lived. I just want to be Harry. Just one night" he almost begged.
Harry relaxed into the Slytherin and kissed him back. Nothing else happened that night, just kind kisses and two men holding each other together. It was nice, terrifying and dangerous but nice.
Harry took a step away and shook his head "Merlin you lost your father because of me, how can you even look at me after that?" he asked voice cracking.
Draco smiled a little, well he wasn't avoiding him clearly so that at least meant they were still talking. "Is everything alright?" He asked softly, running a hand through his hair in attempt to make it look less messy.
Draco nodded without hesitation "Both times, yes" he confirmed. Harry visibly relaxed a little "So everything you said last night was real?" he asked.
Luna smiled at him and nodded "Thank you Harry" she said and kissed Harry's cheek again as she often did with many of her friends. It was normal to Harry now, he couldn't help but notice Draco stiffen and look away when Luna did so.
They decided rather than let this ruin their marriage they'd work through it together and fill their want of children by working at Hogwarts and eventually maybe adoption. It was obvious to everyone how much they loved each other and made each other better, Harry both envied and respected that.
Harry smiled back, still studying the blond's features "I'm sure we can, you're not nearly as insufferable as I thought you were" he said before chuckling "you know, in another life we could have been best friends from the start" he admitted.
Draco shook his head, he wasn't. He was raw and unpredictable. Draco sighed and conjured a bottle from his room. If Harry needed to drink right now he wasn't going to do it alone and if Draco was to join him then they were going to do it in style. He transfigured one of Harry's giant books into the proper diluting apparatus.
Draco looked up at him and instantly wished he didn't, Merlin those eyes. Harry was looking at him as if looking at someone you cared about, suffering. Of course that was all in Draco's head.
Draco shook his head and closed the gap between them, hugging Harry tightly "Because I've been infatuated with you since the day we met Harry. I never hated you, I may have been a dumb kid and acted like a stubborn spoiled brat but I have always cared for you. Our rivalry was the only way I knew that I could keep you in my life" he said hugging him tighter when Harry tried to pull away.
Harry sighed and walked straight over to the large couch, flopping face down into the cushions "What am I going to do?" He mumbled into the upholstery.
Draco jumped a little when he felt Harry's hand on his shoulder, it was very comforting "You're not evil Draco, you have great potential and a kind heart" he said softly making Draco open his eyes and look at Harry in surprise "You were just a right git through school because of your father's twisted political views" he said shrugging and pulling his hand away.
Draco choked then, on air apparently, he sputtered and struggled for words "Y-you're crazy" he stuttered, taking an uncharacteristically large swig of his absinthe, draining the rest of his glass.
Draco held in a whine, self control wasn't always his strength when it came to something he wanted and boy did he want Harry. Focus, control. He took a deep breath and leaned back a little, trying to put some space between him and the Gryffindor.
Draco took a deep breath and leaned back, putting distance between the two of them "You're intoxicated and not in control of what you're saying. I doubt you'll even remember this in the morning" he said.
Luna smiled fondly at him "How was his reaction when you told him I was spoken for?" She asked curiously.
Snape looked pleased "Finally you've learned some manners, there may be hope for you yet Potter" he said, uncharacteristically warm. Harry smiled at him and Snape once again caught himself and rolled his eyes "Go on then! Scamper off and get the plan I want to make sure you're not teaching them dribble" he snapped.
Harry scoffed again and looked at the glass in his hand, sure it was delicious but it just tasted like a flat fizzy drink "You're kidding right? What is it even supposed to do? Other than taste like liquorice candy" He asked before looking up, his head lolled a bit and his pupils dilated. Oh this was alcohol. "Oh.." he trailed off.
Harry chuckled and shook his head "Right away professor" he said out of habit, even though it hadn't been a habit in many years.
Harry whined then, that's it, he was done playing "Shut up and kiss me Malfoy" he said before finally closing the space between them and pressing his lips against Draco's.
Draco sighed, Harry must have charmed the door with an identification spell "Harry please let me in" he said, meaning it literally and figuratively.
Draco nodded and mumbled something about being somewhere else before walking away. Harry smiled and tried his best not to start laughing again before he made his way into his rooms to get started on his lesson plan.
"Draco Malfoy you are strong, and good and determined. You can have whatever life you want. Fight for it, fight for what you deserve" Harry said, voice calm and gentle and genuine.
"Good morning everyone, today's topic of training is N.E.W.T.S and O.W.L.S. Training will start at 2pm sharp right here, in the mean time you are free to get reacquainted with the castle and start on this terms lesson plans" Minerva said. After she dismissed everyone Luna took Harry's hand and lead him out of the hall to begin looking for her shoes. Harry snickered seeing Draco react the same way when he saw Luna hold Harry's hand.
Draco bit his lip, he didn't have the strength to deny him. He nodded and pulled Harry in for another kiss, this one was softer. Kind and slow. If Harry needed a break then he was going to be shown how wonderful it could be. If only he was really here, if only Draco was sure he really wanted this.
Harry whined then, Merlin the sound was delicious "Shut up and kiss me Malfoy" he said before finally closing the space between them and pressing his lips against Draco's.
Harry grumbled in disdain but slowly sat up so he could drink the tea anyway. Luna added a sugar cube to the cup before handing it over to the still scowling Gryffindor.
Draco froze remembering the trials. He was so certain he was going to Azkaban, he stumbled into the courtroom in loose fitting prisoners clothes and stood before the members of the ministry. He looked worse than he ever had before, he was skinny and pale with paper white skin that looked just as thin and fragile. He didn't bother looking up as the members began speaking, it was only when they asked for Harry's statement that he looked up and locked eyes with the saviour himself. His green eyes filled with so much sadness and hurt, he shook his head "Draco Malfoy and his mother Narcissa Malfoy are both innocent. Their crimes against the wizarding world in the war were those of wizards trying to stay alive under the thumb of Voldemort" he said and stood "Draco Malfoy saved my life when he was asked to identify me when snatchers caught Ron, Hermione and I. Draco recognised me and risked his own life to save mine. Narcissa also saw that I was still alive after Voldemort cursed me, she lied to him and saved us all" he said before looking directly into Draco's eyes "Without him and his mother a lot of us wouldn't be here today" he said.
Harry's cheeks flushed and he bit his lip, looking back at the glass in his hand. That was stupid and impulsive, Harry definitely did not need to be drunk in front of Draco "Yes perhaps you were right" he said, placing the glass down on the table. He wasn't very intoxicated so now was probably a good stopping point.
Luna smiled and shook her head fondly as she took his hand and stood up "All is fair in love and war" she said before walking away.
Harry was so exhausted, he'd been dodging reporters all week. Thankfully the train to Hogwarts was so quiet it was blissful. Everyone wanted the scoop on why Harry Potter quit the most promising job in the wizarding world, for some lowly teaching job.
He felt Luna's hand on his then "It's not your fault you have scars Harry, you've made such amazing progress with your PTSD and you are doing so well" she said softly, giving his hand a supportive squeeze.
Harry opened his eyes and smiled fondly at his friend "Thank you" He said before continuing "Draco, reasonably, was quite irritated at the sudden intrusion and rude awakening so he reacted as snide and harshly as he used to... Using the two words that cut deeper than any other" he said tightly. Saviour and hero. He hated those words. Harry took a deep breath and shook his head "I was still angry the next day so after breakfast I went out to the fields to do some flying. When I was finally beginning to feel a little less wound up I flew back to the ground only to find Draco walking towards me. Even after my best 'you're dead to me glare' he still grabbed my arm until I stopped to listen to him..." Harry smiled to himself, pulling his knees up to his chest. It was a comfort position he rarely let anyone see but Luna was his best friend and had seen him at much worse.
Draco froze for a second before kissing him back, placing one of his hands on Harry's cheek. This was wrong, Harry didn't know what he was doing, he's tired, he's been drinking. But Draco was only human, he wanted this more than he could express. Harry smiled against Draco's lips and moved to sit in his lap.
Harry shook his head "Don't try and change the subject, Draco" he almost purred. Flustering this man was far more fun than anything he'd done in a long time.
"Over the last few years he's been buying house elves out of abusive families and promptly setting them free of servitude, no one knows how many he's freed but it's a lot. There's one that still serves him. Poldey, she was the first he liberated. I got to talk to her, she works to transition the elves into their new life of freedom, as well as serving Draco when he needs it but he makes her call herself his best friend rather than his servant" he explained giddily "He even have her a bracelet to signify their friendship!" He exclaimed.
Within a few moments Harry was fast asleep, Draco scooped him into his arms and carried the slumbering Gryffindor into his bedroom "You can have my bed tonight, darling" he whispered. He gently laid Harry down, covering him with the blanket and tucked him in.
Draco smiled at him "For you, I will try to be" he said, before pressing a loving kiss on his forehead.
Snape's mouth twitched, the corners turning up in a small smile. He quickly corrected himself and shrugged "I suppose that's good, I will be observing all your lessons from now on" he said.
Draco barked one short laugh "Please! You and Luna were all over each other at breakfast, it was highly inappropriate" he said sharply.
Draco smiled fondly at the Gryffindor curling up on his couch as he began making their tea. He really was quite adorable when he was tired, his emotional walls were a little less concrete and you could glimpse the real Harry underneath. Warm, kind, vulnerable. Everything that drew Draco in.
Harry had wanted him. Harry really wanted Draco. Dangerous. Scary. Terrible. Wonderful. Addictive. Harry sobbed, he still wanted him. Draco made him feel so safe, loved, normal. Draco was also drunk. If Harry was extremely lucky, Draco wouldn't remember what had happened, or at least would be so disgusted by it that he'd ignore it or push Harry away.
It was a nice feeling, Harry's hand on Draco's shoulder. Physical comfort wasn't something Draco was accustomed to but very much craved. Draco just simply nodded and drank some more of his whiskey, downing the glass and pouring himself another. Many emotions swirled through his mind, he'd hoped some things wouldn't return but they had. He pushed them away and tried to enjoy his evening.
Draco bit his lip, Merlin that was tempting. "Not even once" he said. That was a lie, Harry knew it was.
Harry finished cleaning himself and climbed out of the shower, after breakfast he'd have to get a start on his lesson plans before training later that day. He got dressed in his teaching robes, he'd taken a little more pride in his appearance since his time at the ministry, they provided very nice robes for their employees and Harry had become comfortable with the more expensive and formal attire. He still enjoyed wearing his muggle clothes, just not as often. He fixed his hair so it wasn't so messy and made his way out of his rooms, towards the Grand Hall for breakfast with the rest of the staff. Harry was one of the last to join them and took great pride in seeing Malfoy... No Draco's reaction to his well dressed manor, man he'd have to get used to calling Draco by his first name. It was very fun however to keep catching the man off guard, breaking through the Malfoy facade just for a moment. He fought back a confident smirk and sat down next to Neville who turned from his conversation with his wife to greet Harry.
Harry was wan and pasty looking, utterly pathetic as he accepted the glass so he could rinse and spit.
He watched as the months trickled by and Harry grew. Summer faded into Autumn and all of a sudden, they were picking the children up from Kings Cross for Christmas. Their laughter and joy filled the cold halls of the manor, easing the ache that resided so deep in his chest, Draco was not convinced it would go away.
“Yes, but Minerva will understand if I have to pull them out for a day or two. They aren’t in their OWL’s or NEWT’s years, so it should impact their grades overly much.” Draco rushed out, elated that a solution was at hand. “When can we do it?”
“Thank you, I appreciate the work you are doing. I will owl you with what stocks my green houses have, if I can get away with it, I will plant anything we are missing. In the new year, I will organise with my kids to collect them the day before so we can all be waiting for you when you arrive.”
“I know. You should have believed.” Draco replied, missing Snape’s wide eyed stare as he also sat in his chair.
The next minute, Yuri was stalking off and they watched, amused and horrified as Yuri plugged his own phone into the sound system and turned on… hip hop? Yuri knew nothing about hip hop. The brat threw a hissy fit whenever he had to go to ballet, let alone any other style of dance.
Harry gives her a fond smile. "When did you get so wise love?" He asked and Lily smiled, flushing a little at the praise.
“Please fetch a healer from St Mungo’s and have one of the other elves watch over Cassie, she doesn’t need to see this.”
Draco woke to the sound of dry heaving the morning they were due to pick the kids up from Kings Cross. In the almost two months since the ritual to lift the curse, Harry had moved into the manor, setting the kids up with their own rooms in the family wing.
Reluctantly, Draco lent forwards to peer into the baby's face. His breath caught when he looked into her blue eyes for the first time. Reaching out one trembling finger, he brushed over her soft cheek and the world stopped.
Hallet ran his fingers through the air around them, a grin splitting his face. “Perfect! Absolutely perfect! So you will each need to use your silver knife to each cut nine daffodils, six primrose, three each for the white and pink magnolia and one rhododendron.
“We have extensive greenhouses, I can check but I wouldn’t be surprised if we had them all, or at least most of them.” Draco replied.
"We can go this afternoon after we pick up the kids. James can look after them while I take you to St Mungo's." Draco pushed the sweaty hair plastered to Harry's forehead back.
“Take your branches and lay them in your third of the circle, the edges should overlap, connecting all together, maintain the alternating pattern.” He finished off with another short latin chant and little markers appeared, showing the three separate sections, one for Draco, one for Scorpius and one for Cassiopeia. The three of them complied, taking their bundles and laying the branches out so that the ends would overlap well, ensuring that everything was connected and that the pattern was maintained.
The man hummed and assured him he would do everything he could. Hallet instructed Draco to sit quietly and try not to move too much while he cast a series of diagnostics. He tried, desperately to relax, to allow the magic to wash over and through him.
He was approached about two years after the war by Lord Greengrass. The man expressed an interest in creating a union of their families, to strengthen the business ties they already had. His youngest daughter, Astoria, was willing to marry.
Draco hated how much Harry glowed with his pregnancy, hated how in love with their unborn baby he was. It felt like Harry was willingly walking to his death, walking away from everything they had built together. He found himself unable to touch the swell of Harry’s stomach, leaving the room when Harry spoke gently to the babe. Harry noticed; of course, how could he miss the anguish that Draco was suffering under? But beyond calm reassurances that everything would be ok, Harry only watched him with patient eyes.
He survived the final battle and the trials that followed. He managed to come through with his fortune mostly intact, and began working tirelessly to repair his damaged reputation.
Everything passed in a blur after that. The numbness invading his chest once move as he watched the healer cast diagnostics, confirming that the cause of death was an accidental fall from the top of the stairs resulting in blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Once Astoria had been cleaned up and moved, by the house elves, to the private mourning room in the manor, Draco went to Cassie who was still playing happily under the watchful eye of Dippy.
Harry was staring at him in horror, leaning away. “We broke the curse Draco, that is how we have the baby. I am not getting rid of it. We have been blessed by magic itself and you will not take this child from me.”
“Her as her bitterness grew, the spell turned into a curse, a curse on any who dared to love a Malfoy. It is believed that only romantic love would be counted. You know I loved your mother very much, but I was never in love with her. I thought she was safe. I am so sorry Cassie, your mother passed away this morning.” He felt tears slip down his cheeks, unable to look his daughter in the eye, guilt overwhelming him.
Draco could only shake his head, fear still coiling through him. He had lived for so long with knowledge of the curse, had lost his mother and his wife to it. He couldn’t bear the thought of losing Harry too.
He desperately wanted Scorpius to have, to take what was right there. Albus and Scorpius deserved to be happy together, to have their chance. Draco’s grey eyes flicked back to Harry to see that same look on his face. Their fingers brushed together, sending sparks rippling up his arm.
Draco was astonished to hear the level of surety in his voice. No worry, no concern, no hesitation at all.
“Good, that helps. I’ll paint some runes onto your skin with the juice of the red currant. Then I’ll have you all link hands while lying and carry out a Latin chant over you all. The ritual itself should be harmless, and your children shouldn’t feel anything as the curse hasn’t taken hold of them as yet. I cannot guarantee that you won’t feel any pain as the curse has already claim your wife.” Hallet gave him an apologetic smile.
The children as a whole are stunned, trading glances between Draco and Harry. Draco knew that his fear and worry were leaking out, carving into his face, while Harry was calm and quiet.
Draco and Harry could only laugh at their antics shuffling the kids along to the floo so they could all disappear through with their luggage. Draco went first, ensuring that no one got lost on the way, though he felt uncomfortable leaving Harry on the platform to disapparate on his own, waiting anxiously for the wards to twinge and let him through after James tumbled out of the fireplace.
Exasperated, Harry yanked the shirt off, leaving a wide blue smear on his abdomen. Draco felt lightheaded and swore to himself that he needed to stop being surprised every time this happened. Harry was magnificent, well sculpted muscles wrapped his frame, highlighted by scars that littered his golden skin. There was a tangle of scar tissue in the middle of his chest, but Draco’s eyes were caught on Harry’s left pectoral. A tattoo. A tattoo of the Draco constellation. Above Harry’s heart. Unaware he had moved, Draco realised he was tracing the lines with his fingertips. Harry was still and quiet under him, but he could feel the other mans thudding heartbeat, breath puffing in Draco’s ear.
Draco couldn’t help but respect the man. He had faced the whole debacle with grace while Ginevra had thrown public tantrums and aired their dirty laundry for the world to see. Once Potter had gone through the purging process for removing the effect of long term exposure of Amortentia, he came out as publicly gay.
Draco smiled to himself as he watched the small light of Harry's wand disappear "Dear oh dear, Harry you're not making anything easy" he said softly, rubbing his forehead with his hands.
Draco's face softened and he instinctively reached out to him. Harry flinched away from his hand, fear colouring his face "Don't touch me" he spat.
Harry opened his eyes and was about to ask why when he remembered what she had said yesterday "I have to be the one to discover it" He quoted.
His mood was somewhat diminished when he saw a relatively unwelcome and familiar face as he approached the gates of Hogwarts.
He took a deep, painful breath and continued walking towards his rooms. Draco opened his front door and walked in. He didn't want to feel like this anymore, all this hope and pain and longing. Harry would never feel the same way, no matter what it might look like, Draco knew it just wouldn't happen.
He mentally slapped himself and looked at his hands "I gotta go" he muttered before quickly walking away, towards the fields. He needed air.
He didn't look back to see Malfoy's reaction as he made his way to the Grand Hall to be welcomed by headmistress Minerva McGonagall. She was to give everyone their schedules for the week before school started as well as introduce everyone to new coworkers.
Harry hummed "Fight harder" he said simply before pulling away and grabbing the fork from the tray "Now, you have to eat" he said sternly.
Harry hesitated before sitting down next to Draco "That's a lot to ask y'know" he said, pulling his glasses out of his pocket and putting them on. His eyes looked a little brighter now.
Harry looked at him then, really looked at him. Green eyes boring into his soul "It was a mistake because I don't care about you! I don't like you! I don't love you! I don't want to touch you ever again!" he yelled, beginning to sound hysterical.
Harry looked over, a little surprised and smiled a soft, almost apologetic smile "No Draco, you were never a death eater. Nor were you a bad person really. It's a lot to ask because you're a human. Humans are unpredictable and unstable. Trust isn't a natural instinct for a reason" he explained.
He looked back up at Draco and smiled, he really was very attractive. And kind, much more thoughtful than Harry had even believed he could be. Draco cleared his throat and looked away, taking another sip of his drink, Harry took a breath and tried to control his thoughts.
Harry was still really pissed at Draco. He only wanted to help and he had to go and act like a git as usual, on the brightside Harry's budding feelings for Draco were gone.
Once he was in the clear open ground he paused and enjoyed the wind washing over him before taking a deep breath and kicking off the ground.
He leaned closer once more, he was now only a few inches from Draco's face "You see, I'm having a little trouble believing that" he almost whispered. His voice was low and a little gravely. It was painfully apparent that he was... Excited.
Draco pulled away only slightly, eyes still closed "What if the life I want isn't mine to fight for?" He asked hesitantly, slowly opening his eyes.
Draco chuckled and shook his head "This is absinthe, it'll help, trust me" He said, pouring some bright green liquid into the two glasses. He then placed each of them under a spout on the silver contraption, put a spoon looking thing atop the glasses and placed a sugar cube atop that. Finally he turned the spout and watched the water begin dripping over the sugar cubes.
"He apologised to me. Not just a half arsed one either, he made it very clear that he was sorry and made sure I didn't take any of the blame" Harry said resting his head on his knees "That's what happened just before you found me in the tower and did my reading" he said looking back up at his friend.
When Harry was young - just a first year - he'd heard many of his classmates say how frightening Hogwarts was, however while at first intimidating Hogwarts quickly became a warm and welcoming home for the famous wizard. It was the one place besides the Burrow that actually felt like home. Despite its troubling history with Potter and the awful things he experienced there, it was still a fond home to him and he was elated to be returning.
Draco shook his head, it was so strange. He was sleeping soundly and then there was banging on his door. He ignored it before hearing Harry unlock his door and call for him again. He climbed out of bed and found a panicked topless Harry standing in his front room.
"Oh sorry Mal- er Draco. I wasn't paying attention" Harry said quickly correcting himself and taking a step back.
Luna giggled softly and shook her head "Oh Harry, don't you think messing with Mr Malfoy like this is a little childish?" she asked.
Draco shook his head "That's bollocks Harry! Tell me why" he demanded again taking another step into his front room and closing the door behind him "I'm not leaving till I get the answers I deserve" he said.
Harry landed in the astronomy tower and fell to his knees hyperventilating and feeling a panic attack coming on. He closed his eyes and held his chest tightly trying to take deep breaths and calm down. His lungs were burning and he couldn't catch his breath. What the hell?! What triggered this?!
Harry shook his head "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just" he began before giggling a little more and taking a deep breath "Luna is engaged! She's like a sister to me" he finished before laughing more, wiping away a tear and holding his stomach. He hadn't laughed that hard in a long time.
Harry nodded and smiled the same smile he wore last night "What brings you out here at this time of night?" he asked slowly, taking a few steps further into the courtyard.
Harry then turned to look at him for the first time since he opened the door and smiled a little "It's been quite a day, a glass of fire whiskey and light conversation sounds pleasant" he said softly.
Harry stirred a little and began mumbling in his sleep "Are you an angel?" He slurred, still unconscious.
Harry walked back into the room and raised his eyebrows in surprise "We'll need some glasses and sugar cubes" Draco simply stated, sitting down on the loveseat and setting everything up.
Satisfied with his decision he stood up, walked out of his front door and knocked on Harry's "Go away Draco!" Harry yelled.
Draco shook his head quickly and stepped forward a little more "No no absolutely not your reaction was completely understandable, I should have been more considerate" he said. He wouldn't let Harry take the blame for any of it. He'd only tried to protect him, Draco was the one in the wrong and he knew it.
After what felt like an hour, Harry was beginning to calm down when he heard footsteps approaching. Oh god. Someone was here, he wasn't recovered enough to fight, he was vulnerable to attacks. Harry couldn't take this. Just as he began to get up and run he locked eyes with Luna.
Draco felt anger twinge in his stomach "Because they are! All empty promises and hollow longing, it's not fair!" He said, voice raising slightly.
Harry looked at her feigning innocence "I don't know what you're talking about" he said standing up and offering Luna his hand.
To say that Draco's first day back at Hogwarts was strange was a very large understatement. First of all seeing Potter making his way over to the gates of Hogwarts was enough to make him do a double take. He hadn't seen Potter since the trials and he looked very different from then. Now he was cold and distant, he had a hard expression and a sad empty air around him. It almost made Draco pity him, if it weren't for the act of pity being a great insult to a Malfoy he probably would have.
He and Ginny never had such a connection, he had thought he loved her but he'd been lying to himself, he just wanted to keep one person who loved him. He knew it was selfish and even potentially dangerous so he let her go before they got married. Harry did envy those in love but never wanted to be that vulnerable again.
Harry shook his head and made his way back to his rooms so he could start his lesson plans before he had to go back to the Grand Hall for training. He turned the corner with his smile still playing on his lips and almost run into Malfoy.
Draco focused from Harry's face to what was in his hands, it was a tray of food - Draco's favourite in fact. How did he know? Draco's stomach twisted as did his heart, he didn't want to fall in love with this man. This is why he started drinking in the first place. Draco shook his head and stepped away from the door, only slightly swaying.
Draco choked then, he sputtered and struggled for words "Y-you're crazy" he stuttered, taking a large swig of his drink, draining the rest of his glass.
When they finished, Hallet walked around the circle, checking to make sure everything was laid out properly before clapping loudly three times. The magic that had been swirling and thickening through the glade stilled, almost as if it was holding its breath.
something was very wrong. He flashed back to that quiet conversation he had had with his mother a little more than a year ago. It had been such an odd conversation, so very out of the blue that he had never been able to forget it.
Draco could feel the tension leaving Harry’s body, arms tightening around him as Harry exhaled heavily. “Six months isn’t so long.” Harry commented lightly.
Harry took great delight in breaking the news that their little family had moved permanently into the manor. Al and Scorp shared a quiet look, their knees pressed together on the love seat they had settled in. Cass and Lily both squealed in delight and Draco shared a mildly perturbed look with Harry.
Every time the were together, Draco could feel his hurts healing. There was something about being in Harry’s company that made him better. He began sleeping again. The kids even noticed that he was eating more, was present more often, the weight of grief and self-recrimination lightening. Lily and Cassie became inseparable, a scarily intelligent duo that he knew would take Hogwarts by storm once the summer was over.
The girls nodded, gathering their things together and heading up the stairs, leaving Draco and Harry, who was glaring at his shirt. “I’ll never get this out. And I liked this shirt too!”
“If there is anything you need, let me know. Our boys are friends, and while we might not have been when we were kids, we are adults now and I am willing to put all of our history aside.”
“Of course mère.” He stood, working to maintain the regal bearing his father had been teaching him. He settled himself down primly next to her, taking in her sad smile as she brushed the hair from his face.
and attractive bottom. Within the hour, they had retreated to Chris' hotel room; Draco’s father would be furious if he was
and the music started. Stumbling out of his pants, shoes and socks, Potter stepped up to the pole and Draco’s mouth went dry. His thighs were thick and strong, lines perfect and clean with pointed toes the entire time. The man oozed around the pole as the heavy beat kicked in. His arse was immaculate and Draco felt the insane urge to bite it to see if the muscle was as firm as it looked.
The manor felt more alive than it ever had when Harry was there. The man was full of life and energy, breathing it into the walls and the earth. They spent hours going through the three greenhouses on the property, tracking down the different flowers that they would need and working to ensure there would be enough of everything.
Draco looked up at his mother from where he was playing quietly with a toy wand. He was ten years old.
Harry barked a surprised laugh, grinning. “Yeah, she is a bit. Thankfully I never have to see her again. Because I was under the influence of Amortentia for our entire relationship, she lost all legal rights to everything. The kids, my money, everything she got when we were together immediately reverted to me. I asked the kids if they wanted to see her, but unfortunately, they hate her. She wasn’t the most loving mother and when they found out how she betrayed me, they all turned on her.”
Draco believed for the first time that the curse had truly been broken and that their daughter was a gift from Magic. Life from death as Lily had said so many months ago.
The day passed slowly with Harry gaining a little colour and energy as the hours slipped by. Soon enough they were appearing with a crack at King's Cross, just in time to see the Hogwarts Express come into view. Harry curled into his side, ignoring the other parents as they watched the red engine pull into the station. In no time at all, their children were tumbling out, crowding around the pair and demanding their attention and affection as if it had been years rather than two months since seeing each other.
“Come in Draco, take a seat, I am just finishing fixing breakfast.” Harry gestured to a spot to the left of the head of the table.
He dragged himself out of bed, dressing as best he could and going with Cassie to Kings Cross. They waited on the platform, Cassie chattering away as he stared into the distance. As the train pulled up, he felt a presence beside him and turned to see none other than Harry Potter standing my his side.
The branches in the channel burst into flame when he returned to stand by Draco’s feet. A paintbrush in one hand and the bowl of crushed berries in the other, Hallet bent to paint runes on Draco’s feet, his hands, heart and forehead under the crown. He moved next to Scorpius, repeating the process before moving to Cassiopeia.
Lurching out of bed at the sound of throwing up once more, Draco darted into the bathroom to find Harry on his knees by the toilet, head half in the bowl.
He had to know this man, had to know the story of this broken angel. He was compelled to know what pain was hidden behind those emerald green eyes. He was contemplating how to insinuate himself into the other man’s life when he felt a body collide with his own. Looking down, he soon lost himself in shimmering green eyes and wild inky hair. He surrendered to the desire to run his fingers through the mess, knowing that Potter was probably too drunk to care and almost moaned at how thick and silky it was.
Cass and Lily were both starting their second year, determined to bring Hogwarts to her knees with their combined mischief. The pair would rival the Weasley twins in no time at all.
In the months that followed, as he went from the Grand Prix Final to the World Figure Skating Championship, Draco slowly forgot about Potter. The man was like a dream, drifting away with the morning mist. He didn’t see the young man again, and after a while, he stopped looking for those green eyes or that wild hair. He won gold medals for France at every championship; the Ice Prince of France with his silver eyes, white-blonde hair, and lines that flowed like water.
“Six months.” He eventually murmured. “He wants to do the ritual to remove the curse on May first, so there is another six months of waiting. I have a list of plants I need to have at the manor for the ritual.”
Draco trailed off, taking in the worried expression on Harry’s face. “I’m not explaining myself very well am I?”
Draco frowned but conceded the point, instead of arguing further - he had won the important point finally anyway - Draco helped Harry into the shower so he could start the slow process of getting ready.
“Hey!” He shouted. “James! Albus! I have told you before, no roughhousing in the house. Outside! No dessert tonight either!” The boys pouted but left.
“Excellent, I will bring the robes, you will need proper ritual robes and the goblins make the best.” Hallet commented before showing him out.
Thankfully, Chris rescued him from the little twit, dragging him over to the bar so that they could drink and gossip. Chris, as usual, refrained from leaning on him until after his parents departed the banquet, his mother citing a headache with a subtle wink that his father missed.
They named her Solaris Marigold Potter-Malfoy. She had strawberry blonde hair and silver-green eyes. Where she went, the blessing of magic fell from her fingertips and her lips. Life and warmth flowed from her, filling their lives with love and joy.
The remainder of the school year slipped by in a haze as he grappled with his grief and tried to care for Cassie on his own. He had no real family left, and the few friends he had had moved overseas following the war. He felt so very alone but was determined to do his best for his kids.
It was bliss, perfection, unlike anything Draco had ever felt before. Harry was wearing the same robes that he was, which made it easy to slip his hand up Harry’s thigh to grip his bare hip. Harry moaned, rocking into him and causing their thickening cocks to brush together.
“Yes, I am so sorry Draco, it is all my fault.” Lucius collapsed into the chair usually reserved for students while Draco stood rigidly by Snape’s desk.
Harry waved away his concern. "It has been passing after an hour or so. We have time and as long as we apparate, I should be ok."
"There was a curse on my family. On May first, a cursebreaker helped end the curse. Harry arrived at the end of the ritual and helped… finalise the breaking." Draco offered after a few beats.
White magnolia for the moon, for the tides, for change. Pink magnolia for the feminine, friends and love, for the hope that they could grow beyond the bindings of the curse.
He stepped out onto the little porch and found Harry, on his knees, digging weeds out of the dirt. He was filthy, the tendrils of the rose bush he was currently battling stroking his hair and tangling in his clothes. But Harry was unfazed, humming happily to himself as he batted away the seeking vines.
Next came Al and Scorp, standing so close together their arms touched from shoulder to where their pinkies tangled. Neither were comfortable as yet showing affection publicly, but it would come with time.
“I have to ask…” Draco trailed off after breaking the silence, his eyes tracking over Harry’s changed face.
Draco shared an incredulous look with Chris when Yuri and Potter started having a dance-off, Potter pulling out flashy trick after flashy trick. He was completely floored at how confident and coordinated Potter was when he had consumed so much champagne. It was like looking at a wholly different man. Potter moved with grace and conviction, no longer weighed down by whatever was bothering him during the free skate.
“Each of you cut smallish branches from the trees, you will need three each from the nine trees. Draco, you must allow them to cut the branches themselves, no matter how they struggle. Allow your magic to flow through the blade and focus on your desire to find and keep love, on banishing heart ache from you.”
