morning. Um, out of the blue, as it were. I mean, I’d rather thought the ‘observing Malfoy’ phase was well over with?” She raised a brow at him and waved her second slice of toast. As it was Hermione, no jam was lost. “You know, now that he’s been exonerated?”
“Uh-huh,” Pansy nodded back, eagerly. “Raise you ten, and when, Theo? Bet? As
“No! Be quiet, Potter! All that time away from me--from
"Yes?" Draco employed an inquisitive eyebrow; Merlin forgive him if he wasn't quite buying into this all-out attack Harry was laying on his sensibilities There had to be some ulterior motive; Potter wanted something of him. "I'm perfectly well, Potter—perfectly! And not tense at all, damn your eyes! There's no need to butter me up, arse—"
"Duplam penetrationem anal?" he breathed. "
“Fuck! Luna!” he shouted, looking forward to the back of his friend, steadily maintaining position at the apex of their triangle. “She's in trouble! Assist?”
"Still, no." Draco turned on his heel and stomped off, muttering darkly. "Stupid House."
“Uh-huh,” Harry nodded eagerly, happy to agree. “We did indeed and I recall it quite well; I was the one who cast it. But he wasn’t in the room till after that point, it seems. Snuck himself in behind us in all the commotion and ducked behind that racketty old metal cabinet Professor Snarlph and his minions used for storage. Did a DisIllusionment.”
"What?" Draco asked again, his mind skipping from here to there and everywhere, and none of the stops made sense. "Why?" he demanded, his stomach twisting suddenly, sending the chocolate from the Frogs they'd eaten into unpleasant roils.
"Ron and Hermione? Oh, they're fine. Glad to see me, of course, and busy as anything--of course. Never a dull moment between them, I suppose."
“Ack, Mills! Stop already, will you?” Harry fell back against the posh leather tufts of his posh office chair and snorted himself into a giggle of his own, flapping his free hand at her. “He’s bloody ninety if he’s a day, alright? And I think already taken, even if I did prefer older men. Which I don’t, ta ever so. Not that it even matters, right?”
"Oi!" Harry scowled. "Uncalled for!"
a sodding Gryffindor and they did that—and then!
Instead of responding, Malfoy glanced over at Hermione, who'd given up on her search for the requested notes and was in the midst of hastily gathering all her various things together, tossing them into her bag willy-nilly. Excepting the tartan, of course. Because Harry was still planted upon it.
Draco had spelled both the rings invisible before they'd joined up with Weasley and Granger, out of simple Slytherin caution, and wishing, too, to keep the meal as pleasant as possible all around. Harry had said he'd wanted an enjoyable day, and Draco would do his utmost to make it so, Weaselbee notwithstanding. He would exercise great control; as it turned out, he needed every ounce of it.
“You know, Hermione, I’ve never made the connection before…” Harry trailed off, staring into space, his pumpkin juice suspended a bare inch from his bemused face. “But…”
“Need to spread you open; get into you. That place that makes you whimper—I want to touch it. Again and again and again, battering away and you’ll clamp those legs around me and we’ll—“
!" Draco barked. He was mortified. All this effort and Harry was not even minding the most crucial event of them all—a Real Honest-to-Merlin Proposal, from a genuine Pureblood. A
“Yeah, rather.”
"Oh? Do you now?" Draco could barely think about his thinned-out, sorely tested 'patience'; with the shirt gone by the wayside, Harry was concentrating on the removal of Draco's loose drawstring trousers. They were tugged sharply down his hips and thighs and the cooler air caused his cock to jerk beneath the confines of his drawers. "Ah! Pot—"
"Oh! Oi!" Harry yelped as his chair tilted dangerously back, teetering on just two legs. "Oh, bloody—hell, Draco—that smarts!" he complained his lover seized his upper arms in a hard grip and wrestled him directly onto the polished surface of the walnut work table. "Wanker—you're pinching me! Impatient much?"
“Fine!”
. That was
"That's not a yes, Harry," Draco chided him. He was jiggled again; his cock twitched limply in trained response. "Give me a yes, git. Now, please."
“Nope, nope, no sir! Not a thing, mate. Go on with you,” Nott nodded. “Celebrate Potter’s marvellous victory. You know you want to.”
"On the thirty-second tier, Mr. Malfoy, I was envisioning a recreation of Mr. Potter's TriWizard Tournament bout with the Horned—Horned—"
did?” Draco countered quick as lightning, his casual survey turned vastly more fierce in intent. “Right, then. What for, Potter?” he demanded, shifting his arse about in his seat as if he were making ready to jump up, stride 'round, and conduct his own very thorough examination of Harry’s person. But he caught himself up instead, settling for scowling like a thundercloud and jabbing his quill point at Harry accusingly.  “I see no new scars, no bandages, no blood on your robes--nothing! What in Merlin's name happened to you? You were supposed to be not even a minute behind me, Apparating out! How could you possibly manage to injure yourself in that short a time?”
“We know that, believe me, it’s why we’re sharing the flat in the first place! My problem is Potter’s just done a complete about-face on me--he wants these things, he’s just said so! A month spent away from both our homes, having to get a flat as bloody bolt-hole, and it’s gone completely topsy-turvey between us! He's lost his mind, that what's happened. He's gone and given in to all this magical fuss our houses are putting up, caved under pressure or something. What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?”
"Harry," he said again, having fortunately cornered his prey at the back entrance to the Leaky a few frustrating hours after the massive flat clean-up. 'Harry', he' d said, any number of times in the last few, all to no avail. Harry was a stubborn cuss, and Draco liked it. But he didn't like it so much now, directed at him. "Harry,
“Tempus!” Harry gasped out, fumbling for his wand in desperation. “Merlin, surely it’s been--”
It was funny, he thought. It was funny how the only humour he could appreciate these days was always black. Somebody died, Granger said? Yes, certainly, somebody had died…him. Along the way, left lonely and abandoned on the wayside by the one person Draco had counted on never to leave him lonely. Yeah, he supposed that might amuse somebody, somewhere, him being discarded.  Becoming the rubbish some people had always thought he was anyway.
"No, please, no." Draco's voice cracked on them, all the 'pleases' he must say till Harry consented to finally hear him; he shook it off where once it would've galled him, the begging. Begging didn't matter squat, in the end. It was only results that mattered. "
"Sod off," Weasley said casually. "Just so you know, Pansy's coming over to retrieve you if she feels she must. She fancies this plan, Malfoy, so you've only yourself to blame."
“Arse. Don’t start again, if you know what’s good for you.”
Time, like Ancient Runes, was Mystery with many possible interpretations. Or so Harry had concluded, possibly whilst he was in Norway or maybe it was the second time he found himself staring at the same very large red rock and explaining patiently to the pushy gentleman who'd accompanied him there that these were not technically 'runes' so much as they were the art and history and sacred property of the natives and that the pushy gentleman and his equally pushy government owed the natives a massive apology--plus the promise to fuck right off and not bother DoM or the natives ever again.
—Uhmm Regulus is coming — he gave as an excuse.
The door was opened so Tom could see Harry from outside. Sitting on the floor with His back turned towards the door, he seemed at ease with contemplating nothing.
— And…You are not one of those girls, right?...that thinks boys and girls can´t be friends and worry about every single female around their boyfriends?
He frowned at hearing the name, nobody had call him that In two years.
Harry was a little taken aback by the dismissal, but he supposed maybe Ron didn´t want to talk about it.
—Oh fuck it — Malfoy said standing up and walking up to him.
He sighed and looked at Tom, who was hiding his own boredom behind a glass of wine, holding in front of his lips but not drinking anything.
—Morfin, it wasn’t an accident, you know that— she repeated louder this time, making a few people on the coffee shop turn to look at them.
“Oh, pfft. Piss off, will you?” Harry snorted, reaching out to drag Draco’s hand away and peering at him. Draco snatched it back, flipping it at the sconces to lower them to a more reasonable level. “That’s a load of hippogriff shite. Trust me, I think you’ve made it crystal you’re still ticked off.”
"Farther back. Come
“Mmm, no, not that I’m aware of. But it’s only been a few weeks, you know?” Draco replied easily enough after a moment, idly picking at the ghastly pattern on the Cannons rug with one hand and toying with the telly remote with the other. “Give it time. I do believe the Manor’s a bit ecstatic to have them housed there; likely pulling out all the stops. Certainly it seems to be easing up on me personally, and that’s all to the good in my book." He shuddered dramatically. "Spider-decked mobiles and dizzy ducklings are
The git's question had to be rhetorical; Harry waited patiently, ignoring the bait.
“Suppose so, yes. Time flies, doesn’t it. When we're not having fun.” Draco snorted, chuckling softly; it was hilarious, the utter irony of it--of them.  Given why they were flatting together at all. “Truly pot, kettle, aren't we, Potty? Both of us fretting over each other, and for the same reason. No wonder the Manor went round the bend, wanting me to procreate. I would too, if faced with a sorry case such as me, nearly reverted to virginity. Not much hope for siring a gaggle of children, is there?”
“Obsessed with Malfoy’s hair, Harry,” Ron shook his head ever so slowly. “That’s sad.”
Draco plopped himself on their carefully chosen divan—the one that matched both Harry's furniture and Draco's antiques—and snatched up the novel he'd been attempting to peruse three hours before—when the bastarding, cheating, oblivious git had been due to arrive home!
“.…Malfoy is, erm, ‘silvery’? And you’ve just noticed this? Just this morning?” she probed, curiosity rampant in her bright eyes. “That’s…well, Ron is actually correct, in this instance. It
"Do the expecto, Harry, before you pass out."
“Alright, alright!” Harry cringed back in his seat and threw up his hands, feebly attempting to ward off his determined partner. He definitely didn’t care for the ‘I mean fucking business, Potter’ glint in the git’s eye. “I’ll tell you--I will! All the bloody details. Just give me a half of a moment--”
He slung a butter-stained paper bakery sack on the countertop, slammed open the coolbox to fling a carton of table cream into it, slammed it shut again and then finally spun 'round to lean his back up against the countertop and face Draco full on.
He was not a coward; he was only cautious. A very Slytherin trait, that.
Ever since the English Wizards had once again felt free to move about the larger world--or, to put it bluntly, once Harry had ended Voldemort’s reign of horror--the DoM Wizarding staff who concentrated on Runes in particular had re-expanded their knowledge of foreign Runes by veritable leaps and bounds of a Giant’s Boots. Even during the years Harry had been attending uni a global network of sorts had been sprung up amongst all the many Wizarding folk who were drawn to the understanding and use of the magical signs, sigils and glyphs left by their own local Elders. It was, naturally enough, not a new idea, but rather a reinstatement of an absolutely ancient practise that had been largely suppressed by the likes of the Death Eaters and their following. The Head of DoM, a Witch by name of Alys Gaenor, decreed that the Runes Journeymenship would also immediately be restored.
"That's not all I am, Harry." Draco butted his forehead up against Harry's, not minding the metal of the old familiar frames, not minding at all that his nose tip bent. Not minding that people weren't supposed to be able to do this, physically. That he couldn't possibly force sense into Harry's head, literally. He wanted to, though, and there were ways—and there were
Of his parents. Hagrid. Professor McGonigal. Uni days, after, and new friendships forged, new horizons opened, his old ones graciously expanded.
make a house party of it, later on. Bring along your bashingly barmy House mates, p’raps even, for your celebration….Harry?”
"Fated?" he gargled, paling instantly to replace the fiery crimson colour he'd just sported. "Y-You think so?"
"They w-won't cancel out?" Harry grasped Draco's nipples and twisted, fretting. He worried his lower lip. "You're certain?"
Draco aimed for a casual chuckle to go along with his one-shoulder shrug. It seemed as though he succeeded, too, as Potter's expression immediately lightened. Diversion, that was the key. Potter's posh office was not the appropriate place to discuss such trivial, personal, unbearably
"No, clearly not," Harry snapped, shifting from one foot to another and glaring. "Should've, obviously." He waggled his fingers, brushing it all off as if it were nothing, his lack of foresight in the matter of the wards. "Right. My mistake. But thanks for the reminder, Malfoy. I'll alter them as soon as you're out. Now, if you'll please to be on your way? Door's that way."
"NEVER!"
"Sod off, Hermione!"
“Okay, Harry,” Hermione gulped and then nodded tentatively at her best male friend. “If you say it is, then I suppose…maybe…so. Er, Lake water like.”
"Oh! I was forgetting. With Harry home again, you shan't want to be gallivanting abroad, will you? Silly me."
"Now is good, Harry. Stay awake, mate."
romantic, Mister Malfoy! Perfect place to browse for odorous items for two young Wizards in love! She carries all manner of oils and lotions, as well, I do recall. Ah! Would you…would you perhaps wish her direction, Mister Malfoy? As a courtesy for such an excellent order?"
Draco whimpered inaudibly, clinging to Harry, the both of them falling back as the hallway telescoped all at once upon itself and they suddenly found themselves confronting nose-to-wooden panel an improbably imposing gilt-and white painted double door.
—Hey! — she said smiling and hugging his arm.
—Interesting— he barely managed leaving the mocking out of his voice —. you think all parents feel burdened by their children?
But he turned on the other direction, and yes, that was also very easy.
—I’m not taking part in this — Harry annouced. He was ready to bail when he saw someone outside on the terrace —. You invited Neville? — he asked Blaise.
—Really? — the man spoke slowly, as if taking in the information —.  And how do you think they communicate with each other?
—Uhmm Who? — he said distractedly, taking his phone out of this pocket.
—They are paying for everything and is really a good opportunity for me, I’ll be away from their grasps
—I didn’t know you guys were friends—Blaise was Malfoy´s best friend and ran in a totally different circle than Neville, everyone did really, Neville was quiet, shy and seemed perfectly happy with ignoring them.
Harry froze for a second realizing what he had just said,
—And the Notts just allow it? — he heard Regulus voice, asking from the other side of the call.
—You look a lot like your father when you are annoyed— she commented.
Remus pursed his lips but complied going to get the money, at some other part of the store he supposed.
—Why don´t you go onto the dining room, we are setting everything up for breakfast, come —she signaled for him to follow.
—…To see if I can stay at the Malfoy´s …—he tried, thinking he was pointing at the obvious.
—Your father is at his office, I though you could speak to him now— she suggested.
Blaise came in the room throwing his school bag away with no care of where it landed. Neville a quiet presence behind him.
—Really? — Regulus thought about it for a second —. That’s a lot, what are they asking for in return?
—Thank you Ms Malfoy, but I was hoping once Bellatrix is better maybe I can go back home…maybe visit her at the hospital.
Narcissa entered the house, earpods on while her phone was dialing. She took the mail on the entrance table and struggled to take off her coat all at the same time.
Harry was looking at himself in the mirror, trying out his new jacket when a pair of hands fell heavily on his shoulder, startling him.
. Maybe…Puddlemere. They did send agents out, looking for recruits.
“Ow! Alright, I am actually awake; that does smart. Fine, then. Potter, did I just hear you say
“Bye, Luna. Piss off, Bulstrode.” Harry frowned meaningfully. “Your happy home life is waiting on you, doubtless. Bring me back a curry, please? For the love of Merlin.”  He indicated his belly beneath the folds of his work robes, which obligingly rumbled. “Eel tartlets this morning, you know? I’m famished.”
“Ahem,” Draco cleared his throat, which was tight for some reason. Yes, alright; Potter would win. Fact of life—but he still didn’t want to miss this. Too exciting—too educational, damn it! “You two, shut it. And Potter—come
That earned him a nasty gtare. "Don't joke, Draco," Harry snapped. "This is no laughing matter. We'll likely have the rest of the year in detention for this. S'not funny!"
Only his own Mum could expect to take such liberties with Draco's private affairs, he supposed. He sniffed, a flick of his wand refilling his cup; truly, it was not at all unexpected, his Mum's taking an interest. For it wasn't as though Draco descended upon her private parlour and demanded of her meaningful Malfoy heirlooms every single day, was it?
"But they'll still know it's true—that we're lovers."
“Oh…ah? Really?” The runty, green-eyed git took an abrupt pace back, rocking precariously on the rundown heels of his ancient, duct-taped trainers for a space of seven seconds. He seemed as if vastly startled by Draco’s outburst, almost to the point of scrambling off into the throng of students outside the classroom, moving purposefully down the hallways to their lectures. But then Potter grinned tentatively at Draco.  Which was unexpectedly…quite pleasant. “Um. Thanks. Thanks for that. Malfoy. I’ll, er, I’ll try to remember.”
“Here!” he exclaimed, his gaze instantly fixed back on that slender speeding form. “You see that? That’s what I meant when I said a natural! He is, you know. Filthy bugger.”
And then Draco had started with this rapid mumble-whisper drone, his voice barely audible. Harry had only caught bits-and-pieces and all throughout his strange little fit Draco only seemed more and more wild and odd. Mad, maybe. Possessed b y that mysterious box he kept turning over and over in his hands.
“But you wanted me to, my lovely little Harrykins…didn’t you?” Malfoy put a hand to his cheek, aping shock. “Wasn’t that exactly what you requested of me, just now? ‘Get on with it’, you said, and I have, and now you’re not happy. Do make up your mind, alright? I know you kids can’t manage to pay attention to anything for more than minute these days, but, well—really! It’s too much, this. Tries my patience.”
said he was.
manage to screw this up and get us found out now, mere days before we’re out of here, Malfoy, you will never, ever see my pretty arse again, got it? I won’t go near you with a ten foot bargepole, no matter how desperate I am!”
Who was down again, the confusing bastard, and in the midst of the full-out battle of the ages going on amongst the other players—and ducking the Quaffle and zinging Bludgers like a bloody pro!
by now. At the very least, mate; it's been a month already, you know," he chided, wrinkling his faded scar in disapprobation. "Exactly how bad is this 'trouble', really? Are you in any real danger?”
Weasley spluttered. "I'm not taking it up the arse again, Malfoy, if that's what you're thinking!"
I do now?"
"Hmm. Cheers, you two."
, his brand-new invisible friend purred contentedly from inside his mind
"Let go of me, please." Harry raised his wand despite the clamp of silk-shirted forearms closing in around his upper body vice-like, gathered himself together—Destination, Determination-despite the insistent press of six foot of increasingly desperate Wizard shoving forward. "Stand back, Malfoy," he ordered shortly. "Get out of my way. I'm going back home and you're not invited."
She shrugged again, having collected a pile of apple slices. “Ignore him, too, Harry. Rise above; that’s what I do.”
"Gefizit!"
did this! For
It meant a lot; it meant nothing. Like a tree falling in a an empty forest, the sound was unheeded. The recipient didn’t—couldn’t—hear.
“Boys!” Hermione sniffed grimly. “Why do I bother?”
"Yes! Now stop fucking about and do it, Harry," Draco gritted. Ground his teeth and swayed forward, a little off balance, as he held Harry harder, tighter, nearer, till he and the wall and Harry were nearly a blend, an inextricable mix of young man and old dust and fresh paint, fumed with all sorts of desperation. His throat was so dry he croaked. "Do it. Now. See what's there for you, Harry. What's inside me. What's always been. I want you to."
"Erm, I think I can," Potter said, finally. "Yes."
go. Now, I mean."
. That, there—the quilt-hogging and the shoulder-turning, the
There. That was better. That was demanding—insistent. Not to be ignored, even by a wanker with a stupid complex. Harry kept his eyes trained on his barely-there view of Draco's mouth: his lips thin, pink, dried out from snogging; as expected, they parted, as if to speak. He waited for ever so long—ten seconds, maybe more; it was endless, really--but there was no verbal response nor even the slightest bob of sharp chin in acknowledgement. Only a darting red tongue tip soothing over a chapped, bowed upper lip—the same lip he'd been nibbling on none too gently until Draco pulled his most recent strop.
The Great Hall at Hogwarts had never looked like this! Draped in bunting, flowers and streamers; scented with roses and the rare Siberian orchids, and filled with the strains of a hundred stringed instruments and one Magicked Muggle tuba (Mother's idea, for emphasis, she'd claimed, as was the brass section and the lone French cornet), it was a fairytale setting for a Betrothal Ceremony like none had ever witnessed. Father would be proud of him, Draco was certain, as he settled his lapels and took up his place just outside the doors. Harry would be simply bowled over.
Was likely only exhilaration. He always felt the exact same way when he caught the Snitch.
“No, really. Watch yourself, Potter!” Draco snapped, lurching away. “And the fuck I do. You’re the one who wants to talk about your work and you’re the one who bloody well can’t. Well, make  yourself accustomed to that fact of life right smart, will you? All closed up like a bloody fucking clamshell and by your own choice, Potter. Maybe even have a little think about whether that’s why you’ve not had a single meaningful relationship since you started at DoM!”
A radius of Magic spread like the inexorable tide for well over a hundred miles all the way round the three of them, drenching the Flower, the Monkey, the Dog, the Tree, the Phytomorphs and all the rest, even unto the Cat and the Paracas Candelabra. It settled slowly down across the greater coastal landscape, a fine particulate rain of Binds, Bonds, and Restoratives, a bracing tonic for the signs, marks and messages left behind by those who had come before.
A fool. A fool in love. By himself, in love.
? You jest, Son—you dare
"Idiot boy! You don't know that for sure, do you? Have you even asked him?"
"You. You don't trust me," Harry informed him gently, deceptively so. "You never did." The fury of angry voices was vanished; somehow this hushed conversation was just so much worse. "I don't think you even have it in you, honestly."
." Draco shook his head slightly, waiting for his hearing to settle. It was all buzzy in his head and he knew for a fact Harry had never ever looked at him that way. Not even at Hogwarts, not even in the lav there. He couldn't—it left Draco angry. Very angry, and very abruptly so. He wans't taking this lying down. It took two to sodding well tango! "No, you listen to me, alright.
“And Grimmauld Place!” Ruefully, Harry joined him in the laugh. “It’s silly to be so shocked, I guess, but I’d never even seen that part of the house before now; never knew it existed. Imagine my surprise, when all this time I’ve had to bed poor Ted down in Sirius’s old room. Well, before I had to leave, I mean. When he was a little baby. Never even had a single clue there was a nursery in Grimmauld.”
Smiling thanks at his friendly jeweler, Harry pocketed his two new acquisitions and meandered his slow way back to the confines of the Peruvian School of Magic, yawning. There was yet time for a little lie down and he rather was in need of one, the effects of his coffee haviing worn off some hours previous. It would soon enough be time for dinner, Luna would hopefully be recovered and there might already be a reply from Meneer De Oude as to the recent reports of troubles in the Maastricht tunnels.
Malfoy and Potter, for instance, were always set up to be opposites, rivals and/or teammates. This extended to appearance. Harry, having discovered that a sea change to his wardrobe and a permanent surcease to death threats resulted in highly increased amorous notice from those few Witches and Wizards he'd gained the time to fancy, now only ever wore black. It highlighted his eyes, lent a burnished gleam to his skin and resulted in his newly shorn mop looking quite stylish, even mussed. Black jeans, T-shirt and trainers were his new classic garb.
This wasn't something Draco could stand seeing in his head or for real, no. It had taken hours upon hours of Point Me and scouring the streets for stray gossip just to track Harry down to the
"Hmm. Knew you'd see it my way, Harry."
, the voice pondered hesitantly after a long silence.
And, yes, he still reigned supreme as the consummate Slytherin.
“Hard work!” Harry interjected, laughing. "So much hard work, is what it is." He directed his broom farther off to the side and allowed his position to drift back, leaving Luna at the forefront of the trio. “Trust me, you’ll not be wanting to do it again too soon, Ichika-san. Right, are you ready, Luna?”
"If he is, he's working," Draco frowned dourly, crossing his arms tightly over his chest. "And thus unavailable."
"Where's your Wonder Witch, Granger? Go and roust her out, Harry. Say we've had a little…a little accident, er—with a Potion, that's it. The one for Slug, alright? She'll buy that, I'm sure. She can help us."
It is in need of Conserving, of course.
Draco smiled, the tense set of his shoulders evaporating.
, Harry, nothing more. Because that's what Blaise does for fun, alright? What
"Oof! Uhhhng! Ha-Harry!"
Draco blushed scarlet with pleasure; this lube incantation was unlike any they'd ever used before—tasted eons better (
As a group, they'd done all the usual board games and card games, stripping and snogging games, dares and 'Spins the's' and charades. They'd hosted a dance marathon, staged both a burlesque and a talent show; had tried choral singing and even karaoke. Four of them had been rock stars and the rest groupies; they'd their own Quidditch team. Acres of butterbeer empties and killed-dead-in-the-water Firewhisky bottles had littered the Common Room floor during the preparations, activities, and aftermaths of these activities, and every single one of them had by now managed to shag every other one, including the antipathetic youths Weasley and Malfoy, much to their mutual discomfort. The Eights were—in two short words—terminally bored. With lessons, the threat of NEWTS, career choices, the Hogwart's dining room menu, boarding school life in general—and even each other. Which is not to say some odd pairings hadn't shown up over the months of enforced closeness, rising like scum to the surface of the mutual pool.
"Eewww!"
"Harry?" Draco blinked at him, grey eyes wide in the reflected starlight coming off the lake water.
Potter, outdoing himself and perhaps hyped up by the roar from the stands, flew at superhuman speed upside down and in reverse ‘round the entire Pitch—twice! The Snitch danced over his twisting wrist all the while, teasing, its short-lived freedom clearly doomed. The entire stands, excepting two chilled, querulous Senior Year Slytherins, was upon its collective feet and howling in excirtment.  All for Potter, of course.
“It’s just like Lake water.”
the damned Librarian!"
“Er?’
Startled, Draco hurriedly matched his mate's retreat.
"Draco…come, do. And stop baiting them."
"Fine, fine—whatever, Ron," Harry waved him off. "Later." He shifted a bit, side to side in his trainers, and focused his gaze carefully off into the distance. "Look, er. Why don't you and Hermione go on ahead and we'll catch up at Madame Rosmerta's or something? Have a little breather, yeah?" He sent a hopeful grimace towards Granger, who was obviously the most sensible of the three of them, to Draco's mind, and she returned it with a small off-center smile of her own.
“Harry? It’s not Teddy, is it?” Draco demanded impatiently, casting about mentally for any other instance that might send the wind up Harry's fine arse. "Oh! Do stop fooling with that thing. Put it down and bloody answer me, will you?" He jabbed out a finger, shaking it at the irksome git. “Yes, I know, I'm remiss. I should've asked after him sooner, absolutely. I saw him myself, even, not even a few weeks ago, and he was fine. I mean, it's just that I’ve been a little reclusive lately, I admit that, truly I do, but I've also been run ragged with work and Mum’s said not a word and Auntie hasn’t either! Teddy
“Of course; I’ve done it already,” Millie smirked sharply, “for Wednesday next, eight sharp. Lovegood, you’ve had your Owl?”
“Whooo-
Harry!
"If you say so." Harry sounded quite doubtful about that, but it may've been the shortness of breath caused by the fierce rush up the staircase. "Still not--"
! Shit-fuck-Hades, that smarts! My bollocks'll
“Uh...um. Work?” He shifted his trembling forefinger to point out the report form Draco had been contemplating so thoughtfully when he entered the office. "That there?" It was nearly finished, from what he could discern. Just a few more moments, perhaps, and then he’d be free to scarper. “We should finish that.”
"Nope. I shan't."
Harry threw himself in the joy of anticipation—all of him, flinging legs and arms and thumping down like a sumo wrestler…and was caught with a startled ‘Oof!’ on Draco’s part—neatly, securely;  in a flurry of lifted eyelids and full-out happy- smirks, really pleased ones, and flying, tangled, water-pure lashes and uncombed come-glued hairs.
Who was to be found quietly ensconced on the sofa, cupping his favourite mug in one hand and paging slowly through one of the books Draco had brought back with him from Manor’s extensive library. His sharp eyes scanned the pages rapidly, and Draco arched a curious eyebrow at the sight of Harry engrossed in a text on Wizarding apiary. HIs old friend was interested in all manner of varying topics--or certainly had been at Flamel--but Draco had no idea this was one of them.
is my Prime Source, you know, and I can't exactly be asking...so I've muddled along as best as I can. And it's in parts, because I'm a ruddy tease and I'm trying to decide whether the boys will shag or whether they won't yet...[grins at you all, with shiny Tiger teeth, snarkily.]
“Inconvenient?” Draco scoffed, folding his arms across his chest and radiating a species of low-key fury. “It’s bloody dangerous, is what it is! What if you weren’t here, in the office, Potter? What if you skived off to the pub or something--not that
'FATHER' ME, YOU LITTLE UNGRATEFUL WHELP!" He gestured widely and Draco thanked Merlin silently and profusely his evil Magick stick had never been repaired after the ex-Dark Lord snapped it. "And I
"Yes, I am, so shut up about it," Draco nodded. "Throw that, will you? Growing cobwebs, here."
Nazca was a source of constant headache to the informal association of Mages worldwide whose business it was as Conservators, Protectors and Creators of Runes, Sigils, Glyphs, Ikons, Graphs, Etcetera to do precisely those tasks: conserve and protect the remnants of the elders. Create new ones, too, as needed, although Nazca was not lacking. It was more the straying or careless Muggles, or the ones with no respect or understanding, than any Magical threat which concerned Harry and Luna this fine day.
"Bosh! And of course I have!" Potter remonstrated, keen eyes telling over every part of Draco's person intently, from polished boot tips to buttoned-up collar. "Ah, you look the same, bloody wanker. Natty as ever and still smirking. Fuck, but's a treat to have you here. Tea, was it? Or do you need something stronger? You're a bit ghoulish, for all your smart robes. Are you sleeping? Oh, hang on.”
! Potter! Pot-
Er, right, then. Draco gathered his thoughts and returned to his military-style stratagems with gusto. He's a lot to accomplish and no time to do it in, really. Harry had better be stunned by his superiour quick thinking under pressure, as well as the sheer grandeur of the Ceremony Draco had in mind.
"Draco, I do
"Okay," Harry pulled the small gaily festooned box toward himself across the table, deftly avoiding the sticky spots and the places where the cream from Draco's whip had dripped. "If…if you open mine."
“Well, when I first returned and was given the Department to run, I was rarely at Grimmauld,  right?”
was exquisite and Harry couldn’t help but be fascinated; he’d never in his life seen something—someone—so beautiful.
"Huh," Harry blinked. "Carryaway, was it. And I bet the flat's fair rubbish now."
"Hmm…Love you lots, Malfoy."
Potter, like Draco, had chosen to play Seeker this one final year of schooling. He, like Draco, alternated games with the Seventh Year Seeker, and, as an added bonus, Headmistress McGonagall had elected to increase the number of matches by half again. Plenty of time to observe Potter, then, and make certain he wasn’t rising too far ahead of his main competition, Draco Malfoy.
Contrarily, he'd be ecstatic if Malfoy was amused by him, actually. It would mean the git had noticed him at last—at all. Harry was damned tired of having those grey eyes skate over his person, never really landing. It was as though Harry were wearing his cloak all the damned time, for Malfoy at least. Couldn't be seen; wasn't an entity.
. You're not like this, Harry. You-just tell me, alright? Will you just say it? What can I do to…how can I ever…ever? Because this can't go on, not like this. I can't go on. I'm lost without you, Harry. I'm…lost. Fucking well
"Yeah?"
Floribunda's hair bloomed with sudden displays of the tiny white flowers known as Baby's Breath, she was so brilliantly ecstatic. Draco kept himself from sneering at this fancy only by dint of huge stretch-lipped faux smiling. Definitely a Hufflepuff—he shivered, as he 'd just given over the most important day in his life thus far into the guiding hands of the hideously soppy.
, Room—sod it, I
“If you're sure, Potter. I just--I mean, my little problem can wait, I suppose, and it rather looks to me you’re in a more dire situation?”
"Not quite." Draco smirked. And didn't budge.
"Sorry, sorry," Hermione murmured as she dug through her bottomless bookbag, but clearly she wasn't at all 'sorry'. Harry scowled, going up on an elbow, and quite carefully not staring at Malfoy. It was enough that he could smell him; he didn't need to add to his misery by considering just how close Malfoy was to him at the moment.
“Luna likes spiders. And, I must say, it was a pretty brilliant idea, you letting your house out to them, specifically,” Harry cackled. “Sometimes it just takes a fine mind, with a keen eye to detail, to come up with that perfect match, that match made in Avalon, blessed by Merlin him--”
pull his chain, rattle his cage like the dickens.
"Oh, Dad. Really, now."
With a sniff, she sank her chin down upon her chest, intent on the text.
, they murmured.
"Hmm, yeah. Reassigned to Town, too, on a much more permanent basis, and a full month sooner than I thought I'd be, too. Bit brilliant, I think."
pretty swell! Draco admitted, with a silly grin plastered all over his face. He’d have to remember to try that last amazing move, too, for next Slytherin practice. Fucking impressive! Science! The prat sure knew his shite!
"You're an unmitigated arse," Draco alternatively groaned and snogged and talked with alacrity, never ceasing the flow of any. "You have not a bloody clue—no sense at all," he informed his captive. "To even think! I'm ashamed of you, I am—you stupid, speccy git! Don't you ever use that shaggy head of yours for anything other than yapping nonsense?"
Before First. Madam Malkin’s Robes Shop; that was when Draco had first noticed the glare. It had set his teeth on edge then. Now…now, it was rather…exciting. Potter came alive when he glared, really. Bloody radiated power like a sodding magical sieve, the prat.
“Draco! Oh!” he exclaimed. He twitched visibly under the concentrated stare Draco had perfected many years previous. “Didn’t even see you there. Oi, when did you get home?”
And the older ladies blushed as red as Harry's nape and the younger ladies eyed them maybe a bit enviously. And the few men-folk amongst smiled softly behind their cup brims.
“Oh, no,” Luna shook her head, apparently giving up on the concept of eating any of the delicious food in front of her. She gently shoved her plate offsides, then idly resettled her unused cutlery into its proper setting. “No. Not a bit of it. Good idea, Harry. We should Owl ahead, though. Or floo. Meneer De Oude will be expecting us.”
! Show some spine, Malfoy, or Ron here will be happy to pound you a new one out."
"—Seymour—" Harry muttered, as he tossed the powder. "Our flat!"
planning on joining the unfortunate Ravenclaws on the shameful side of defeat! He was still the House Quidditch Captain, bugger it—Senior Captain and expected to set an example—and he’d a few tricks of his own, yet!
“A year,” Draco stated firmly, having thought it through thoroughly, well before his happy shaggers had even taken up residence. “Not less than, surely. That’s quite powerful Magic affecting mine, and it needs be appeased by some quite heavy-duty acts of fertility. If we're not there to do it, then it’s still got to be accomplished in some fashion, and regularly."
"Why should I?" It was a dark growl, flung over his collar carelessly, and blond locks flopped restlessly when Draco asked it. "Why should I even bother, Potter?"
if she doesn't come. This was all your idea, Draco, the Hippogriff position—and why is always
"Hah!" Draco snorted, waving that off. "A pox on your constant threats of violence to mine person, Master Archmage. Note how I am still actively breathing despite all your many threats to off me, over all these many years. Not scared, Potty. Not a bit of it. You've not killed me yet. Nor I you."
"Tell me all, then."
"Well, then. I guess we can shag in the Trophy Room instead of Hogsmeade then, if you wish—duing detention. Makes no never mind to me, Harry. 'Course, I'll miss those quick nips in to the Burgh, but—"
. Fucking guffawed right in his face, as though Draco were joking. Acting, even. Playacting.
He scowled at the warbling duo across from them. The Weaselbee just couldn't seem to shut up—the Know-It-All was worse, what with her excitable giggling.
“I want to come in you; want to fill you up. Want to claim you; want you to scream and shout. Wake Ron and Nev and shock Seamus and writhe when I pound you and beg for mercy when I lick you and—“
The recently resettled Gryffs began to turn heads and gawk. Harry blushed red as the jam Hermione had spread on her toast.
, ostensibly.
Unbudged.
The cock within him pumped a few times, shimmying; throbbing and bucking finally as it thrust against the sudden constriction of Draco's internal organs; Draco felt every inch of it, imbedded deep in him, and was gladder than he'd ever been of anything, including the death of Voldemort.
"Three," Draco breathed, and the wisp of his breath crossed the table somehow, cinnamon-scented, and Harry inhaled shakily.
"Certainly," his Mum replied staunchly. "Stands to reason, Draco." Her tea was partaken of once more; she nibbled a Hobnob and cast upon him an inquisitive stare. "So, my darling dear, what exactly has occured that has caused you both to admit your mutual attraction?" His Mum, who was not by any stretch of the imagination ever particularly given to bonhomie, much less chattiness over personal details, beamed at Draco, her lazer sharp eyes twinkling. "And do tell, Draco—have you kissed him yet, your darling little Potter? Or have events moved well beyond that stage? I would hope so, actually—you are a Slytherin, Draco. Slytherins do not waste their time waffling about."
“Oh fuck--oh Merlin--you can’t-what the-fuck, Potter! Are you mad? You must be mad, you must be!”
"Really?"
, he'd likely think.
"Um, Harry…" he muttered, craning his neck just enough to glance fleetingly up into his lover's intent visage, "...come to think, I dunno about thi—
Meanings – Communication, spiritual growth, signals or prophecies from the universe or an ancestral god (occasionally Odin)"
"Next year," Draco murmured as they turned to go, low and intimate, and meant only for Harry's ears. "Next year, Harry, it's the rings in the window. Did you see?"
"Babe," Harry leant over and captured Draco's smirking mouth for a quick hard kiss, fingertips wrenching his chin 'round upon his willowy neck to do so. "Don't stir things up, alright? We've a job to—"
—no, he was in
Harry grinned madly—a great barmy beam of delight—and snuck sideways glances as best as he could upon Draco's intent face as
Draco gestured 'round, indicating the scattering of expensive artistic porcelain doodads, preserved floral arrangements, assorted artwork displayed on the pale damask walls and the gleaming furniture, all dark cherry wood and carven runic symbols, which called out the intricately lush carpet under their feet rather beautifully. It framed Potter too, and seemed to somehow suit him.
"No," Draco stated, rather more firmly. He—they—couldn't risk it. "I can't. Doesn't matter, Potter. Drop it, do."
“I do!” Ichika-san exclaimed excitedly. “I shall be honoured. I have studied it many times and cast it in Praxis, but never in the field. This is so much--”
"Oh, but."
"Breath in, then, Potter—and
Harry smiled quickly, but it was a poor effort and he knew it. “Of course I’m alright. Just a bit wrecked by that last. You know the feeling?”
Still and all, Draco couldn't help but be secretly pleased by his lover's mate's reactions. It was his arse on show, and it was Potter who was shagging it. Could've been a bit humiliating if it weren't that Harry's mates were so clearly bowled over. By which he meant impressed. As they were, absolutely.
"Might it work?"
"Why should I? So you can talk me into coming back to the flat and then make me feel like shite again at your leisure? I don't think so, Malfoy. I'm happy where I am, back at Grimmauld. It's very comfortable there, these days. So, er.
"Of course I am," Harry protested. "Head of this department; rather have to be."
, arse,” Harry growled under his breath, as Ron peered past him to meet Hermiones’ eyes. “Touch your nose with my fist, rather. And I hate sitting in the middle, guys. Remember that.”
! Happy now, Potter?" Draco snarled, all hope of convincing Harry to stay at home disappearing. The heroic git would no doubt make good on his promise to that bitch Brown!
"Oh, Hades!" Weasley exclaimed, attention caught by mention of his bratty younger sister. "She's always looking! And finding, too! What about that ickle Sixth Year—what was her name again? Murgatroyd, maybe?"
"You look quite--quite--" He shrugged helplessly, peering at Potter, who was apparently unfazed by the state of his workplace.
"I wasn't."
Cackling gleefully, Malfoy closed the small distance between them, leaning down and right into Harry, effectively smashing his captive into the stained work surface of the table they both stood at. Snape’s perpetual detentions had one very bright facet, though: appointed daily shagging, eight to ten, every evening, in an almost always deserted Potions Lab. Ex-Headmaster Snape, once again Potions Master Snape, as he now had a life, was off elsewhere, likely in the Staff Room or perhaps even Hogsmeade, having himself one. Often Harry thought he just issued these detentions out of ingrained habit, as there seemed not much real rancor involved. Either that or he needed help cleaning up the laboratory.
Oh, and
"Oh—o—ohhh!
"—take care of you, alright? Like you should've been, idiot, all this time. You know, if I'd any idea,
Weaslebee clearly wasn't satisfied to let the matter rest and the darkling glare he sent Draco's way caused the hairs on the back of his neck to rise. Doubtless, there'd be some sort of retribution coming and Draco would do well to watch his back in the near future—there'd be hexes sent first opportunity when they returned tonight, no doubt.
Promptly at seven, Draco stepped through the floo into Harry’s familiar drawing room at Grimmauld.
Harry snorted. “I can’t believe you want to be an Auror, too, Ron. It’s all about stealth and subtlety, mate; Kings was telling me. Right, Hermione?”
“Just,” Harry sighed. “Why does this always happen with you? You know I can’t say anything about my job and still you egg me on unmercifully!”
He hoped to Merlin Harry hadn't considered that aspect of the matter when they'd, er…hooked up. He hoped desperately Harry wasn't actually thinking about what went on between them—only feeling, as he was. Thinking on Harry's part would really just bollix the situation up completely.
“Ronald! Really!”
There seemed to be no arguing that statement; Harry felt horrid, knowing he'd willfully argued himself into a blind corner. One even Hermione admitted existed.
Draco bit his lower lip, catching it between his teeth as he considered.
It sent him into a full-out panic, that. He struggled and squirmed backwards, frantically seeking space before he leapt all over Malfoy anyway and clung like the slaggiest of slags, but Malfoy didn't allow him much freedom, if any, snaking a quick deft hand 'round the back of Harry's neck and stilling him carelessly with that single, brilliant touch.
"You've noticed them, Malfoy? Harry's little mishaps?" Hermione stopped in her absorbing task of excavation long enough to ask of Malfoy, eyes on him like ravens on a fresh carcass. "Hmmm. That's…interesting."
"Oy! Why don't you trust him, Malfoy?" Weasley wanted to know. Unnoticed, he'd plopped his arse down on the couch next to the blond boy. "Harry's decent enough."
"Hmmm," Malfoy drawled, "essence of Potter. How...sweet. My choice of descriptors was more than accurate—mmm. Hot, too. You do know you're hot, Harry?"
"No. No! NO!"
Narcissa acknowledged that with another beam of white teeth. She fondled the small jeweler's case Twimbly had brought her, her eyes soft. Draco watched her intently, reassured by the way his Mum's well kept hands folded over the hinge and the tattered velvet with care.
Some might say it was really a pity they were both so primed and impressionable, Draco and Harry. Some might hazard a guess that the Old Magic was a
Harry's chin wibbled; his eyelids drooped. He, too, was worn to a nub. Bad idea or not—Draco's ideas were often not so hot—the Hippogriff had been undeniably both hazardous and incredible. He felt like he'd been squashed flat, all the cum extracted from him.
will make your life miserable.
Pansy, who’d been chatting away with Nott over Longbottom’s latest foul-up in Advanced Potions and laying odds, too, on the calibre and duration of the next one, stopped her high-pitched, highly annoying chit-chat abruptly and went still as a tomb. Gasped softly as thistle wafting and gaped a bit, too—as did Nott, plumped next to her on the other side of the Slytherin senior’s bench. At Draco, her ex-boyfriend.
"I'm sure," Draco said blankly, nodding politely. "As you say."
"I do," Potter replied, eyes glittering. "Well. Shall we?"
, Draco's internal monologue chanted, over and over in an off-key litany, enough (between the short deep jabs that rocked him on his bearings, the lips that slid continuously over ear and hair and cheek and eyebrow) enough to send Harry flying high—
It was rather nice, being tucked so firmly under Malfoy’s expensively capacious wing. Rather fitting, too, considering how difficult a time he’d been dished out, all those many years prior, taunted ruthlessly for all the things he knew not. Malfoy was definitely making up for it now.
The ground beneath his feet is nearly expired, only the faintest trace of magic still clings to the particles of rough soil and gravelled rock. What grows is stunted, what lives feeds off the remains of the ancient dead.
are you whispering at me? Is something wrong, Draco? Are you
"Harry," he muttered helplessly, when the git opened wide and swallowed him down. "Harry…" he whispered, and nearly cried from the sheer beauty of this moment, with Harry here, on his knees, like a bloody worshipper at the altar of Draco.
Harry turned to the Wizard eagerly, as far as Draco's arms allowed it. Draco kept his eyes lowered for another second or two, blinking faster than usual, perhaps. The poor excuse for a decent shop was terribly, terribly dusty inside. Obviously lacked decent house elves to clean it.
Hah! Which Harry would never be, not even if the sun exploded right this instant! Oh, yes—Harry was a keeper—but he was
Harry was practically shaking him by the shoulders, trying to get his attention.
"You're a bloody fraud. You only ever wanted me for all the trappings," he went on, nodding as if Draco should know all this, as if Draco was the one who should understand, how it was to be in his shoes. "All the stupid fame and the press. And for my arse—you seem to like
“I’m sure he is, rather,” Pansy said grimly. “You ran off, Draco, and just left him. Now, listen to me.”
“I know you do,” Draco replied, one eyebrow arching up in query. “That I know. But asking you to say what you don’t want to say when you’re caught by a Truth spell is pretty fucking unethical. I gave you the possible options to consider; I’m not asking for more. Not for another two minutes, at least.”
"Darling, perhaps it's best—" his Mum began but Lucius overwhelmed her, too.
"There, there, Harry," Malfoy patted him on the shoulder blade a little while after, as they slowly slid into a heap of jumbled elbows and knees on Hermione's Transfigured handkerchief, the last swells of their entangled magics ebbing to a peaceful lull. "You'll grow used to it, I'm sure, and I'll take good care of you."
Draco sighed, lounging fully back and propping his long legs up upon the coffee table.
chattering about the shining qualities of Malfoy’s bleeding hair. That was uncalled for, Harry. He’s always had bloody hair, has Malfoy. Be bald as a coot, otherwise. And it’s always been that weird washed-out colour, too. Don’t see what the fuss is over it, all the sudden.”
"I did!" Draco protested from above him. "I did so, Harry. You're my mate, remember? Of course it would work out—that was just a small blip in communications, easily handled."
“Ron?” Hermione’s eyebrows joined Harry’s in their climb upwards.
“Is it--is it that I can’t really talk about it? My work.” Harry tilted his chin, curiosity evident. “I can't, of course. It’s awkward as fuck, you know? Other chaps can natter on and on about what they do all day but I'm not able to. Literally can not.”
Or mayhap he was in the mood, and it was entirely inappropriate and it was all very awkward, even if Potter clearly hadn't noticed the degree of awkward.
it. No.
“Flies well, the git,” Draco mused, his eyes fixed relentlessly upon the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain Emeritus.
“Oh, come on, Hermione, give the fuck over,” Harry replied, coming to Draco’s defense instantly. His green eyes flared with anger behind the frame of his specs. “Stars or no stars, he’s got a life already. A perfectly nice one, thanks. He doesn't require children to be happy. Nor do I, and it’s a bit harsh of you to imply it.”  He made a vaguely disappointed face at Hermione, who countered it with a completely deadpan stare. “Not everyone needs or wants what you have, alright? Nice as it is.”
Hermione had the gall to giggle. The little bi-bitch!
so well, mate, given it's yours now--and has been, really, for ages."
"Oh—owwww!" Harry groaned woefully. "Fuck—ing—hurt—my—poor—arse—Draaa—cooo!
"No, it isn't, Harry," Draco huffed. "It'll be just like all the other times. Poor sap'll end up with another one-off and then he'll moon around like an abandoned Kneazle, and either you or I'll have to ward our bed hangings like bloody fortresses for days on end. Not doing that again, thank you."
"And—and the spell? The duplum?"
"Huh," Harry crinkled his scarred brow thoughtfully, his chair legs half lifted off the flagstones. "Alright. But, you know, I'm not truly convinced she's really gone off. I tell you, she's a menace. She lurks. Just like Filch."
"Ready?" Harry asked breathlessly. He ignored the comment; nothing he could say wouldn't incriminate him. His hands cupped his gift instead, caressing.
"The Shack?" Draco shrieked, his voice rising. "The Shrieking Shack? I'm not setting foot in that horrible place, Potter! You must be off your fucking nut!"
"Mmmph." He considered Apparation as a way of returning. Draco, of course, could simply fly.
No tea had been offered. Draco wished he had allowed his manners to overthrow his affronted dignity. His throat was drier than a desert. He swallowed down the very small amount of saliva his mouth was producing and darted his gaze to the door, hopeful that a hint was being telegraphed. Eyebrows were only so useful and the Granger-Weasley contingent well inured.
of note, pretty Pottyhead, so that’s hardly to the point. Camping like a bloody plebe all across the boring countryside doesn’t count. Thing is, we can go, soon as you’re old enough to apply for the International Apparation license. Got mine, naturally, days ago now. Came in the Owls. But…oh! You’ll be needing to obtain your passport first. Visa, too, I’d think. Gah! More sodding paperwork!”
"Shut up!"
"Right, first thing," Draco remarked airily, ignoring Harry's question entirely and busily gathering the rest of their scattered notes into a semi-neat stack. "Here we are, then, all on our own. In the Library." He casually unbuttoned his robes and collar buttons with one elegant hand. "The deserted Library. With a clean worktable available and lots of nice thick carpeting to muffle all sound. No Librarian about to consult with, no other students to pop over and gawp at us and—secondly—note the time. Well past curfew, isn't it? Hmm," he purred, and somehow—impossibly, it seemed—eased his length to slink alongside Harry's rapt but puzzled person. "And—thirdly
that piddling D.A. of Potter's besides should Dumbledore allow it—anything to keep that expression stuck on Potter's dumb scrunched-up-with-smiles face. It was an utterly brilliant look on him; Draco had never seen the like.
“...No,” he returned at long last, lowering his chin and staring miserably down at his stupid quill again for fear of meeting his partner’s eyes. “I don’t, really.”
He smiled craftily behind the cover of his wine glass, glancing between his two friends. Hermione seemed full of calm purpose and Harry was not shouting objections. In fact, he looked far more at peace and thoughtful. Which meant he'd ultimately agree, the silly bugger. Then Draco would have his comfortable old roomie back and perhaps some actual companionship in his evenings as opposed to the host of painted whingy Malfoy ancestors he had now.
He rose up, heedless of the grumbled murmurs of the lower Years behind him as he blocked their view of the match. First years were meant to be thwarted; he did so proudly, as a Senior.
he should be, and that this cave with its Paleolithic symbols and glorious art spoke directly both to his magic and to his heart. No amount of missing Malfoy could change that.
"No, please," Draco went on—at last, at last, and sincerely-and maybe there was a bit of sob underlying his words now, as they poured out. His fingernails were back to digging into the upholstery and quite possibly puncturing holes right through the cream brocade. "I can't do this any longer, coming home to the flat without you in it. I'm not eating, not sleeping, not fucking caring—barely going to work, alright? For gods sake, I'm bloody well
Flailing, scrabbling to manage a better grip, to lay himself wide, he sought only to imprint himself permanently on those especial bones, that specific skin, that extraordinarily private blend of lingering lime-sandalwood scent. He'd strive to become a part of it—he'd be stuck to Draco Malfoy on a forever basis.
—Oh you respond to text now? what’s next, picking up the phone? — Harry joked.
—Uhmm— Hermione hesitated.
—Way better too
—Are you serious? — Draco asked frowning, finding the idea a bit absurd—. What do you think he is going to do? snitch on our party habits?
Lucius took a deep breath before approaching him.
—I will put all of this into bags — Madame Malkin continued, addressing them both —. And Darling, over there are the scarves, hat, gloves etc, take your pick and I’ll be back in a few minutes— she said before walking out, leaving them standing awkwardly.
—And you normally
—You were always on the short side, but that is normal, omegas grow late —Harry looked at Sirius, he was looking at some documents on his laps, still he didn’t feel safe enough to speak freely.
— The running away, the drugs…— Tom said bluntly.
—Is a new one — he explained.
—Come on… you know the last tantrum she threw at my house? —Harry pursed his lips.
—With his mothers’ family— he lied—. Small town life…It was difficult for him to transition
—She didn’t go through with it
Blaise looked at Harry questioning. “Is Regulus” he mouthed.
Harry sank on his chair, embarrassed. He sounded like such a brat if you put it like that.
—Really? —Draco said frowning and walking up to them—. That is rather…ominous
Harry tried to hold his laugh. It actually was comforting in a way.
—…The family got sick… in more the one way
—They don´t know about him?
—He did? —
—That´s  ok, we will find you
—Do you need more money? — he offered, bracing himself to another allowance financing his cousin’s defiance.
Ron came in walking behind her making an apologetic face, he probably felt Harry aura spiking for a brief second there.
—Lavender what the fuck do you think you’re doing— she asked pointedly. There was more than enough space for them not to collide with each other.
—…like a picture in my head … whenever I thought of coming back …the life I imagined, he was part of it and now I realize all this time he was gone…
—I wouldn’t presumed as much but its challenging for everyone, even for those who choose parenthood willingly
Harry didn´t recognized him so thought he probably was one of the transferred students he had heard about.
—We don´t talk about that on this house —Vernon voice rumbled.
—But the school was notified, right?...that I would be away
—You know I don´t want to
—uhjj I don’t know,   look why don´t you email him or something if you are worried, he probably just wanted to know how you were …uh?
—Oh you have to be kidding me —she muttered.
—Milo—Tom started but stopped himself when a maid entered the room—. What? — he asked annoyed.
She lost it completely after the baby, full on rage, and erratic behavior, she was convinced she had been poisoned and people were after her
—Well whatever it is, I’m sure any type of baby is hard enough.
Narcissa got out of the car and hurried her feet on the steps to enter the house. There, close to the hallway was Draco fidgeting with his phone.
—What happened?
—Yeah? Did you see any snakes?
—Yes, he is a little on the light side on his weight — Tom lied.
—You think so? — Narcissa feared she was letting on too much, so she took a sip of tea, hiding herself behind the cup.
—I think so
— You can´t do that anymore, we can get sued — His aunt pleaded.
—Then you can call me Harry —he said with a fake smile and saw how Draco face scrunched in disgust.
Not since he was adopted.
—oh!  Is Narcisa also nearby? — Regulus answered enthusiastically. Draco could not match the mood, his father very rarely engaged in small talk, so he was probably in some kind of trouble.
“What did?”
“Yes, well.” Draco coughed, bobbing his chin sharply. “You've seen it, we've cast Finite. So. I think we should, ah, perhaps now be--”
And Harry—
Bit of a headcase, his mirror, but as Draco hadn’t attempted to speak to Potter for ages without the intention of either humiliating him or setting his beefy minions upon him to exact a little vengeance by blood he’d take all the positive propping he could lay hands on. Well…that wasn’t quite true. He’d made sure to thank Potty, after the battle was over. He’d thanked him again, after the Trials. And he’d muttered ‘good morning’, ‘nice work’ or ‘Hullo, Potter’, now and again, in passing. Pleasantly, as befitted a proper gentleman.
"I mean, you're such a sucker if you think someone admires you, Draco—so easily persuaded, so flattered. Your ego's got to be size of Greater London, you know? So we fucked, alright—we fucked and got the Merlin-damned flat just make it easier to fuck. And…and that's it—that's all it ever was. Convenience. And now it's over; I'm done." Harry tapped a toe silently on the plush pile. "It's
"Harry." It was breathless whisper in return; Malfoy turned to Harry's throat, lipping over Adam's apple and the straining cords of tendon by his pumping carotids, nipping until he reached Harry's sensitive earlobe. "Ready for me, now?" Malfoy asked, his voice a mere reedy thread, and Harry nearly broke his neck, nodding. "We'll go slow, I promise. Pretty Harry."
“Coming!”
"You have something to say, Weasley?"
"Ta, mate." Not waiting for a definitive 'yes', Harry slipped off his glasses and cast them floating towards the general direction of the night stand.  He gave Draco a friendly little pat on the back, brow creased in concern. "Alright there?"
But they not only merely amused, Malfoy's expressive eyes; there was a flare of something deep and heated in the cool depths. A fiery lick of…of desire? Maybe? Could possibly be?
"No, you're correct—of course I wouldn't want that, Mum." Either wrinkles or the wind changing; the wind had been rather uncommonly friendly with Draco lately.
"What," he gulped, because this was the sticking point, the only reason he was grateful they'd come, these two. "What do you suggest I do? Now? Because it's hopeless. He's left me, he hates me. He'll never come back. He's said."
"I-I, er, won't, Draco," Harry replied hastily, blinking rapidly and with some bewilderment. He peered at Draco as if Draco were some stray nutter, come to call: gingerly and with caution. "I mean of course I wouldn't forget, you git! You've made it very clear—um, singularly clear, really, that I'm not to. But, er, Draco? What exactly is it I'm not s'posed to be forgetting? Because you haven't said—that. Yet, really. Exactly. Um…could you, maybe, perhaps…clarify?"
—Ah…—Tom said leaning on his chair, as if understanding something —. Bellatrix got to you
—Fine — he conceded in a pressed tone—.And i´ll just got to the Malfoy´s
—Just beast parents dealing with their teenage sons, I’m sure you will get to know the struggle one day— He taunted, pretending not to notice how sensitive the subject was, given that Karkaroff as many other old snakes, had not been able to have children.
It had been discussed how the whole situation was strange, it felt like too much and now with this hot shot lawyer getting involved, it was adding up.
—She is human anyway — Ron said tiredly —. Are you even allowed?
—Did she say anything else?
—You got to push through it mate, enjoy the party — Ron said, trying to calm him.
—We met when buying the uniforms— Hermione said simply.
— Can of worms
Snape finished was he was writing and extended the note to him
—We don´t know that, she could very well be having a dog
—Like special school kind of special? —
Pansy turned around to see what she was talking about. There on the door was a familiar boy,  she wasn’t quite sure if she recognized him at first but then Blaize was waving at him, confirming her suspicion
—You don´t seem…very used to this
—We both agreed to not talk about it and I’m happy with that
—Mom is not their fault, you know they were after us, they are just snatching this change like the leeches they are—Bill spoke up.
—Is he no there with you?...oh right… I saw in the news you were out of the country
— Your mental problems are showing Bella — he said uninspiredly.
—You’re trying to tell me you didn’t know?
—What I mean is, his mother was a unknow human woman, while I am of House Black, you can´t say that doesn’t matter for something
—Will I have to repeat a year? — he tried again.
—Wonder what?
—What …—he was starting to ask when he felt a strong presence behind him. Then two hands were softly covering his ears.
—Perfectly, thank you — the girl smiled—. How much do I own you?
—Well you heard him, he doesn’t want to be on camera, but this shoulder you guys see on the screen is him beside me, I hope that’s enough
Harry felt properly reprimanded and the superior way in which he said it irked him. He felt himself getting irritated.
—This way we at least can give you a bit of a choice— another voice said.
Harry was honestly hurt at the suggestion for a second, before remembering that Tom didn’t really know what he was talking about, as he had never been able to openly say how adverse he was at the idea of going there.
Harry understood the need of going…the plan was to introduce him to other snakes, learn from them, and to finally reveal he was an omega… it was supposed to be important, but he was mostly just excited about not spending the summer at the Dursley´s.
Harry tried to keep listening, but even his sneak hearing could only take him so far. He walked away from the door to sit on his bed.
—I doesn’t matter, he is dating now, first love and all that — he said, almost rolling his eyes in annoyance.
—He is at the front — another voice suddenly told them.
—No…all human, me being half was part of the problem
The whole area had been remodeled a year ago or so. A project started by Bellatrix but soon after abandoned. The result was mostly white walls and furniture that looked like it had never been used before, it was cold and impersonal.
—Fleur, one would think that after leaving so many missed calls you would deign to answer your phone. Send a text at least, don´t leave me hanging, I’m curious
—You are still on that? — he asked, annoyed at his cousin recent interest on his best friend.
—It does, you don´t realize how much influence you have
—No I’m saying like full on rage, and erratic behavior, she was convinced she had been poisoned and people were after her… — Draco explained
—How is the study going? I’ve seen your grades have gone up
—I need
—Ah… — he said as if he was just remembering—. Well that´s already over, so no judging on this side
—Say my hellos to Regulus — Lucius offered smiling. Draco still a little wary started talking on the phone again.
—Yes— she said signing —. It means you really believed your son was alright, and it was only one isolated event that triggered him… so now that he is saying he wasn’t in fact alright, how does that make you feel?
—O no,  imagine… — she scoffed —.  Walburga would die
Tom stopped when they reached the old family room area. He turned to the maid.
—Dude i go there all the time, as far as she knows at least
—So that’s It ? you can´t be bothered to deal with me, Much less with the new baby — he accused
—Anything interesting happened there?
Harry shrugged
—She is pregnant, don´t be an ass
study? — Snape looked  bit perplexed.
—Is this uncle also beast blooded? —
—Yes, he said this Riddle guy insisted he should stay here — his aunt was saying, right in front of him at the dinner table.
—Lie, be brief, play dumb
—Morfin?
Draco was left speechless. Harry…after almost two years, he couldn’t believe it.
—Like that new boy — Lavender screeched excitedly —. The Norwegian one, he is a snake too, I think he has like a real strong sense of smell, I thought that was more of a dog thing, do you have that also?
Somehow Harry had expected that the fight would bring Tom all the way over to Surrey, if even just to get him a new phone, but the next few days passed as nothing and he was more disconnected than before
—What? — and then everything became chaotic.
—I resemble my mother…—he responded automatically —. Or so I’ve been told
Draco was taken aback
At hearing this Harry´s head turn so quickly that his neck hurt a little.
—No— Tom chuckled—. You know there aren’t many of us
—And you mother believes it? You never stayed at my house
Harry rolled his eyes.
—What? — he asked a little chocked.
—Say Neville…How are you and Theo getting along? —Draco started
Harry turned to Ron, questioning.
—Yes, They say to pay attention to his diet, he is a little on the light side on his weight — Tom lied.
—No no no, look ahm...— she stopped him —. I´m sorry, that was uncalled for, you were just trying to be nice,  I just…I just moved here and I’m starting a new school and… is a lot of stress
He had played it off early with Harry, but truth was they were in deep trouble, and at this point the twins’ expulsion was the least of their problems.
—Since he arrived, he seems very upset and would not take any offer of food nor suggestions to go anywhere else, we weren´t sure if he just needed space or if something was wrong…
—Does Mclaggen´s tongue know that? — he asked teasingly.
—I´m a bit busy right now Milo, is it important?
—Random, i said i was at your house
is having the first baby of the world, ever
— I was not
—I’m mad at you —
— I don´t know her, must be knew— he answered making a mental note to ask Pansy.
—Resentment is a strong word
—But — Tom continued, giving him a look for interrupting —. Your registration in an educational facility is among the conditions for being released into my custody.
—We saw a lot of different animals —he reluctantly answered.
—I thought his mother hated him… wasn’t he disowned?
Hermione turned towards him on her desk.
—You know it wasn’t an accident — she said, her tone clipped. And she voiced it as a statement, it took him a little bit to understand he was supposed to respond.
—…I think I can understand that— he nodded along.
—Forever you mean— Draco continued, smiling satisfied.
—He is neither one thing nor the other, what are we going to do if this thing of his becomes noticeable
so many times in the past had not feed him as punishment.
—I thought that was the whole point
—Ooookey— he accepted starting to turn, thinking it would be better go take a look at the scarves like Madame Malkin said.
—…You´re kidding…
It was a shit show, every summer, with him not saying he didn’t want to go and his relatives trying to look good, and not at all like they were relieved to have gotten rid of him. At least, since he had been recognized as a Gaunt, the treatment he got there wasn’t so bad anymore, they probably feared being sued.
—How am I behaving exactly that you think you deserve so much better? — he dared her.
—I…no, I’m new in town, i haven’t really been out much yet
Harry had never been particularly on board with this in the first place, back when Tom first got married, but he always took it as something that didn´t concern him, now however he was completely opposed to the idea.
This will be the last chapter to be a flashback, from next chapter we will be on the present and moving forward
—Why would he?  If he wasn’t planning to keep him—Harry told himself that was not true, that beast law was different…it still hurt—. Boy! You look scrawny, don´t they feed you in that house? Isn’t that guy rich? — What he  thought was rich was his uncle asking this, when
—You are among the top students at Hogwarts, meanwhile maintaining a healthy social life and exceling at sports, you must have balance in life, not everything is studying
—Like I call your forgot to make, or a paperwork you haven’t done
—Well yes of course, but you know…we figured we might be expecting him at Durmstrang
—Well yeah…
—He says you are terribly excited about this trip and he could not bear to disappoint you— At that Harry frowned, the notion was just absurd, he could hardly imagined Tom ever being worried about disappointing anybody for that matter, and
—You are not eating —Tom said suddenly, getting his attention.
Ron turned his head quickly to find his mother standing at the door leading to the living room. She looked exhausted
—So, Harry…—the man pronounced his name as if it was a bother —. Here I have your father listed as a James Potter right? —
— …like a picture in my head … whenever I thought of coming back …the life I imagined, he was part of it and now I realize all this time he was gone…
i've had this idea for a while so finally decided to just post it and see how goes
Draco took out his phone to check on the time and found himself looking towards the entrance.
Harry took a deep breath and climbed in the car.
—It wasn’t my intention, it just got confirmed last minute and… well I guess part of me expected him not to come, it puts me in an uncomfortable position in a way
—…I don’t even have grades to apply …
—But you said to be the best, and that the—
—Hmm — Bellatrix took her time sipping her coffee —. Was he too upset?
—Warm enough? —Tom asked, finding his eyes on the reflection.
It wasn’t exactly against Beast etiquette, but they usually were a bit more selective on the touching, saving it for a close circle, it was a territorial thing.
—Hey Mate — Ron reached to give him a half short hug/pat on the shoulder.
It was so…schoolly and childish, not at compliment that was exchanged where he was before and definitely not something he would like to be called.
—Of course, it was made very clear but…the support of the Norwegian den was given to you under one condition
—As you should, a glamorous sprinter like you, to stay in London would be a crime
Harry tried to zone out, he hated when it got like this, he ought to know by now, not to mention Ron, as he had inadvertently started a debate about lineage, beast families and ranks
—Just…taking some fresh air
—You took him without my permission
—And what would we know about how a crazy person looks honestly — Draco said.
—What do you mean?
—Does Milo respond to your texts? Maybe he can get some sense into Rony´s head
—Karkaroff— he greeted back, in a much more serious manner—. Well yes, I wanted him to enjoy his summer as much as he could, but Hogwarts start the 1
—What other things you hear your parents talking about? —Back at the Dursley he used to hear a lot of conversation by accident, he wished he didn’t, as it was always hurtful, since then he learned to keep to himself.
—Milo…—he started exasperated —. Having one son is a lot of work and you are making it worst by the minute subjecting me to his conversation… I thought I wasn’t capable of having children so you will have to excuse me if I do not have this baby yet in my calendar, surely it can wait for his time until he is born
—What?
—Sixth…so, we can keep each other company then, so it isn’t so
—Well then, go on and tell them if you want, let’s see how it plays out
—Doctor? — Bellatrix asked.
—The drugs aren´t here yet — He excused, rubbing his hands anxiously.
Tom crossed one leg over the other, pretending to accommodate his position on the couch, all just to contain himself from rolling his eyes at hearing that. The woman always used that word, “interesting”.
—She didn´t like him? — Draco asked, and it wasn’t his intention, but it somehow came out mockingly disingenuous.
—That’s fair — Pansy offered.
Tom waited for him to be out of earshot before fully adressing Bellatrix. She continued drinking her coffee, pretending everything was fine, he wasn't buying it.
—You have to come, is the first one with you and Regulus back and I’ll be nice to have someone there with me
—Why? — he asked finding the idea absurd.
—So how do you two know each other? — Lavender asked, pointing between him and Hermione.
—Tom cares more about his legacy, and this baby has not proven to be part of it yet
Home…he thought, he was back home, so how was it that he felt so out of place? He hadn’t been able to bear it up on that empty room, new bedding, vacant drawers, and not even a phone to distract himself with…isolated, alone…and unlike the garden, it had felt familiar in a very uncomfortable way.
—Mr. Cuthbert, he is like one of those professors you read about on dark academia novels
—I think is him — Sirius ensured. He gave him a long look before adding —…your parent can’t know yet
Ron scoffed.
—Yes, his grandmother passed recently, right? — Tom answered, looking uninterested as he finally took a sip of his wine.
—Your aunt told us you were speaking to one
—That’s two years from now and I don´t trust you to not get disowned before that — they both laughed at the idea.
—I wasn’t with them when I left…— he admitted  —. I ran from my uncle´s house, so unless you plan on sending me there again, I don’t see any danger
—What would you have me do uh? When Karkaroff calls me to ask me things…you know he is going to ask
—Come on, the Blacks are famous for it and don´t make me start with the Gaunts, there is a reason why his daddy dearest got some random girl preggy— she explained petulanty.
—It was only one time— he muttered remembering, he had wanted to learn how to swim and woke up on a hospital bed.
—But surely that doesn’t mean you have to quit — Lucius said, looking genuinely upset.
Harry and Hermione exchanged looks and he saw her turning slightly, trying to hide her smile.
—Use it every time you feel cold, doesn’t matter if you are in-doors — he frowned, annoyed at Tom —. Don’t give me that look, is better if people think you are coming down with the flue, we don´t want to repeat the pool incident
Harry took out his phone to star typing.  Something in his demeanor must have given away he was nervous, because the next thing Remus said was.
the far more sophisticated Sixth Form, who sneered—at least in Slytherin—over such childish pleasures.) But it might not be possible or even advisable, given Potter's circumstances, though surely, if they were in company—Mudblood and Weaselbee would there, he was certain, and likely to ruin it just with their presence—surely it wasn't too much to ask?
“Scared, Potter? Well...alright,” Draco replied, shaken both by the intensity of Harry’s appeal and his fervent nod of assent. "Of course."
He'd thought better of it, now that it was time and he'd Potter's full attention. It wouldn't play out well—look at them, sneaking about like common garden thieves already. They were no longer mere schoolboys, free to flirt a bit and snog in dark corners and go out on such useless, frippery things as 'dates'. Why make their difficult and uncertain lives yet more complicated? Just because all the young people of Draco's acquaintance followed a proper course of action when pursuing their objet d'amours didn't mean he was free to do so with Potter.
Interpretations – Eihwaz does not mean literal death, but is more of a metaphor indicating transitions, renewals and fresh starts."
Yuck-blech-
F’r'nstance, Harry had never known before he found ‘angular’ attractive. That ‘git’ could be ‘fit’; that sharp-slicing glances and double-entendres could Summon his poor innocent blood into galloping wild-Beast through his body. That the bland colourless-colour of grey could make his cock stand up so bloody fast his flies literally hurt him, binding his ciculation. Against his will, sometimes, that happened—like in Potions or DADA. But mostly not.
Draco approved.
"Is this all for Beltane, d'you think, Draco?" Harry, the speccy idiot, wasn't looking. "Wow! Headmistress has outdone herself!"
“Wha!? What the everliving fu--Potter?!”
"Harry."
“Hmm?” Harry slowed down and half turned about, not wanting to lose sight of that Lake water hair, courageously forging ahead through the crowd before them. He glanced back at Ron, who was simply planted stock-still in the busy corridor, surrounded by giggling Firsties on their way to Charms, totally blocking the corridor. “What are you on about, Ron? Hurry up—we’ll be late!”

Bad enough Potter had the habit of pulling his soul out through his cock, sometimes—or it felt that way, to Draco. Like being wanked by a sodding Dementor, but in a very good way, and Draco would hand over that particular piece of his psychic anatomy any day in exchange for Potter to be there always, so he could practice that particular Dark Art of his on Draco on a steady basis. And it had to be Dark because it felt so fucking brilliant; there was no comparison.
They hadn't been shed of the pair of them for the remainder of the day, and it was only Potter's direct command that sent a red-facing and puffing Weasel and his slap-happy girlfriend on their way. Then they'd raced again, hell bent for leather, and fetched up at the last place Draco could imagine shagging.
"Now? Gods yes—now! Now, Draco!" Harry commanded, spitting out a few stray wafts of down. "Don't wait, git. Do it now!"
He allowed himself a quiet sigh, making sure to bump knuckles with his beau. For the moment there was peace, at least. The day was still bright before them.
"Po—Hah! Har-
Another semi-planned rendezvous in the shadow of the Hump-Backed Witch before dinner, another opportunity for some snogging and maybe a mutual wank, if they were fast enough and lucky. It was par for Draco's new life, post Myrtle's lav. He didn't mind it, not so much.
when that great drink of wet Longbottom had come crying to Harry over the Weasel female and
"Heh," Draco chuckled. "I'm only being repetitive so I'll be sure you'll understand; you know how woozy you are when you are when you're fagged."
you still? Because I’m not, obviously. Not really. Overtired, more like. You're perfectly right; I don't care to blub. Much.”
Harry sighed heavily, turning to Draco again, green eyes weary and dark behind the natty spectacles frames.
Harry caught his breath sharply; a panging thrill ran straight from brain stem to cock. His bollocks gathered tight, suddenly full and ripe in Pavlovian response to the word 'lube'.
"No!" Harry shot back, indignantly. "You've enough books—and bloody kits!"
His mother wasn’t helping much, either, insisting he contact Harry. Draco was not accustomed to dumping his own personal issues into the unsuspecting laps of his good friends. Not even as dear a friend as Harry was. Had been. Was still, hopefully.
“Don’t go.”
, Potter, you laggard! Grab it, why don’t you? It’s right under your bleeding nose!”
But Harry had never teased—Harry never would. Harry was so brutally honest, even when he was lying. Draco could read him; Draco knew him because he needed to, he must, to make sense of his world and his place in it.
Draco was already on his feet and walking towards their kitchen, a well appointed room Harry tended to avoid like the plague. He glanced back over his shoulder.
he should be, at the
"We're both in this, right?" he'd whispered furiously in Potter's ear after he'd drawn him privately aside in the Kinkleshaft's shop, resisting somehow the overwhelming urge to lick it. "
“And what about me, guys?” he demanded. “I’m bloody wearing my breakfast, thanks to him!’
“No, I know,” Harry sighed, glancing about him. Chaz, the prior Head, had seriously warned him the Jera would be strenuous and time-consuming, but Harry still had not quite absorbed the full measure of what awaited him as the newest Runes Archmage. “Thanks for giving it a good go, though. You know I’ll do the same for you when it’s your turn.”
fit. Our bits."
Harry didn't love him. No, Harry didn't. It had all been but a mad dream and a silly lovestruck idiot's fancy.
, he was going to suggest. Thankfully, he was cut off by his father's roar before he could complete that thought aloud—or Lucius may well have choked him to eternal silence.
"That's what
A second stretched endlessly. Then another. Harry scowled, every muscle tensed to peel out and over if necessary. But...
He scowled; proper Courtships when rushed could be so damnably confusing.
Not that every Runestone absolutely had to be made of stone; far from it! Journeymen Mages from the Isles had the long-standing habit of creating their own very special collection of stones, gems, pottery bits, wooden items and woven-works, and then magically inscribing them with their own especial markings. It was a quite elderly tradition and Flamel’s instructors had been enthusiastic about students continuing on with it. But with a bit of a twist in recent years.
He’d risen awfully early to Floo the Ministry Directory because Harry had always, always spent ghastly long hours of his time buried in his miniscule cubby of a work-space deep in the bowels of the Unspeakable section. Or rather, he had, for the all-too-brief span after they'd matriculated and before he'd faffed off to parts unknown. Had practically lived there, and if Draco had any chance of actually finding Harry Potter again back on English soil, it was best to begin his search at the Ministry.
“Finally!” Pansy sighed.
“Mmm,” Harry hummed, blinking at Draco, his vision blurring momentarily. “True, true,” he burbled, nodding and gesturing to the poor unfortunate quill. “That. Gurgh.”
"It shouldn't, alright? Really. Not."
Hermione hummed. Harry pulled a long face, grimacing.
"You sure?"
“Yes! Alright?
There was nothing he could do, either, to make Harry feel for him what he felt for Harry: no Love Spell that would last long enough, no Potion would be strong enough. He could but retreat, then. Find a nearby bolthole; sort through his stratagems; regroup. Do no more harm to what he held most dear.
"Not yet, certainly," Potter was blabbing on, "but later, maybe, if I…if I make it."
“Yes, immediately,” Harry agreed, sliding his arm about Draco’s waist and taking a good firm grip of it. “Do the honours?”
Draco had no real voice at all; nothing left but the one from his mind and that roared at Harry.
“G'night."
There were times when Harry was immeasurably glad he was the most powerful Wizard living; it helped him keep up with his mile-a-friggin'-minute boyfriend, at least. Kept Harry well clear of St. Mungo's 'Spells Encompassing Xystarchian-Related Damage' Department, too, on more than one occasion. Really—his power was a blessing, in disguise.
Yes, he could. And it would pass, he was sure of it. This swimmy-headed sensation, which was so very unlike him. It would pass.
"Any why ever not, Granger?" Draco demanded. "He's a right to see anyone he chooses, as do I—"
Lagging heels behind a bloody bodaciously built boo-hooing ex-Gryff female in Harry's affections—or
"Draco..." Potter replied evenly enough, though a subtle note of warning infused his voice. "You're not making sense. Come on."
“You wound me, Harry,” he remarked, blandly regaining his seat—and more sausage—after the damage was done. “Yo have no faith in my observational powers, Harry, and they’re already highly honed, mate. I mean, Malfoy! Malfoy’s hair! Fancy!”
"Really, Ron?" Harry sniggered. "May I watch, please?"
But it must've worked. He must've been convincing, because Harry was back, back with him again, just like that. In a blink and a sigh. A rush forward and Draco had a loving armful, a solace and his joy.
"Humph! Of course you do, you sugar addict," he responded. "Very well, but Tomes & Scholls first. I've a book I've ordered in to retrieve."
require a Calming Draught, either, Narcissa! Or a Cheering one, Salazar Forbid! I require only that you control that—that
That is, the newly refitted, absolutely darling Nursery suite, which sported both the lovely old heirloom Malfoy cradle and a spanking brand-new Muggle-adapted Spello-O-Mind baby monitor, and abounded with a symbolic yet soothing updated décor of great fecundity, all comprised of various flora and fauna, Magical and Muggle, gaily frolicking and disporting, sprouting and blooming and fucking bounteously fruitful.
"Ohhh…Harry."
Draco wouldn't have thought it was all that, what he was,
"I—I—you!" A particularly deep gouge of cock had him arching up in his trembling knees; Malfoy was so strong within him and his poor tortured bollocks were so very tight they'd bust soon, and why, oh why hadn't Malfoy touched him there yet? It was horrid! It was just like—what an evil git Malfoy was, even if a gorgeous one—
Potter snorted, bursting out in a peal of laughter. He ran a fast palm through that hair, ruffling it into a state of charming abomination.
He planted his palms flat on the rough brick face, one on either side of his hopefully not already ex-beloved's head. This was one he couldn't let ever get away—no, not Harry. Please not Harry. Not him.
“Malfoy…!” Harry growled. “Malfoy, you’re pushing me, way too damned far, git. I’ll be eighteen before you know it and then we’ll see—not that I can’t make your life miserable right now, if I want!”
Pans were staring aghast at Draco now, their assorted eyebrows well nigh invisible, they’d climbed so high upon befuddled foreheads.
Summary: Draco's Veela heritage impels him to make permanent his relationship with Harry Potter. He needs a certain special family heirloom to make that happen. Potter's cooperation would be useful, too.
“Ah…yes? I suppose,” he allowed warily after a long moment, even as the sensations of the fading Veritas Charm snaked through his intestines and straight up his gullet, pushing and shoving. "Umph!"
? Hermione? That's—look, Draco, I can't ask poor Hermione to come her and deal with our—our—"
Potter had been absolutely correct: his House indeed suffered from a 'Condition'.
"YES, I CAN! AND—AND I
Damn twat
"Yes, love. Whatever you say." Harry nuzzled him, cuddling into Draco's taller form like a puppy, his gorgeous green eyes closing in delight. "'Cause you're mine, right? Very much mine, aren't you, Draco? All mine."
"Hate you!" he hissed, wincing in pleasure. "Merlin, Potter."
. K-Y. Love Juice; that slippery, sometimes edible goo Muggles used for their sex acts—or so the references said. The ones to be found in the Muggle adult shops, that was. The same ones he and Draco frequented ever more often when they had a free weekend and the opportunity to pop over to Edinburgh and browse the city for fun. Draco, as it had turned out, was an adventurous git; that old French chevalier blood in his veins must've contained some lowbrow brigand stock as well, as he was damned nigh irrepressible over certain things. Like sex. And Muggle sex shops were just the tip of the exploratory sexual iceberg. Draco had also dragged Harry off to view various homosexual pornos, all of them shown at dark little hole-in-the-wall back alley theatres, just perfect for a spot of one-off fun.
—What is he aiming for? — She asked herself.
They had thought at first that it was just another one of his brothers’ messes, and maybe they had gotten too used to it, but the thing is nobody expected the issue to escalate this much. Just two teenage boys drunkenly entering an abandoned theater, the police found them, they paid for the few broken windows, done deal…right? Not this time around.
— You stay there until you learn some respect! —
—What?
—That i was at Blaize´s — he said shrugging. Tom never asked anything if Blaize was mentioned.
—Fine but then…are you just never going to do anything…ever?
—Isn’t he? because you were supposed to present him to the den two years ago, instead we never heard from him again, it makes you wonder
—Just because you are despicable doesn’t mean we all are — he spat —. I wouldn’t have done that to Morfin, I’m not like you.
—Hello? — he answered the call, tediousness clear on this voice.
—Lavender hi — he said hunching a little a from her, trying to dislodge his arm without being rude about it.
—How is it weird? is all the same, I imagine it be boring if anything, underwhelming
—She is being the most annoying, isn’t she?
Harry frowned at that and turned to look at Tom intrigued, hadn’t he told her?
—Sure thing — Frank said smiling widely. He opened the gym bag for Remus to inspection
— You can’t try a little out if you want — Frank offered
—alright…—she accepted the vague explanation —. I´m Hermione
—I remember, you wanted Connections to English families, and we delivered, right? We even sent a family member to that school
—Well…not really, I used to do little runs, like in party clubs you know — He said without looking up —. This big of a pickup is much more stressful, there I sent the text
Harry pondered on that little piece of information, did that mean Bellatrix wasn’t living here anymore? With that in mind he made himself comfortable, and just then Tom, as if summoned, appeared.
Harry raised his eyebrows, also surprised at the question, thinking Tom could shove it if he ever thought he could allow or not allow something like that, but looking at Lavender he considered it was a good excuse.
—Of course, I heard about you—
—I thought I had a brother— Harry spoke in almost a whisper.
—It can be hard to build the emotional bond a parent should have with a child after being absent from his life for so long
—But not snakes a bet —
—Have you spoken to Tom about this?— he asked unsure.
Harry bit his tongue obfuscated. They had conversations like this many times before, with Tom demanding while giving minimal information, and it was pissing him off.
Draco shook his head resigned.
Ron saw something moving out of the corner of his eye and turned to find Ginny sitting on the stairs, doing the same as him, trying to listen in their parent conversation. He sighed shaking his head, this was the reason he had chosen going to school no matter what, otherwise he would be driving himself crazy like Ginny.
—Other places then…for younger criminals — he heard the woman sign.
Regulus kept going around his room setting his belongings, using earpods instead of speaker just so his family wouldn’t listen in on his conversation…not all of it at least.
—Yes of course—she corrected herself—. I guess you are right — she said laughing lightly, pretending to be silly.
Harry tried turning on his back, he was confused, so confused.
—…So he is going to Hogwarts again? —
—Here you go, a hot latte— Bellatrix announced reaching the table and putting the paper cup in front of him.
Harry took the phone quickly to type it out. He imagined it didn´t make much sense for his cousin not to have his number
Tom didn’t say anything for a while, letting the uncomfortable silence stretch on the office. On the side Harry saw the assistant stir in his spot.
—I…I’m not…that is not what I’m saying, I haven’t been to a school in two years…this starts in two weeks
Tom didn’t answer immediately, but Harry could hear him taking a deep breath as he regarded him. For a moment Harry thought he was going to hit him, Tom had never hit him, but the nstinct of feeling like prey was hard to forget.
—Look…I have to go…— he said, deciding to hang up.
—Come on Neville, I’ll show you    —  he said starting to walk out the room. Harry didn’t have much choice but to follow along.
He heard a colective hummed of agreement.
—Try this tea, it will calm your nerves— she offered her sister.
—I did study for this test —he defended sounding defeated, it wasn’t as if he didn´t put any effort.
to calm down.
—Is alright honey, your mother already paid before she left
—Did you know she was back in London? — Draco asked.
—Lets just not make rushed decisions — he said grabbing him by the shoulders —. We´ll go to buy new gear this week, what do you think?
—You assure me there is nothing going on with the English families then?
—Sure, I’m not from London and I had to move here and start at Hogwarts once too , even now is the same all over again, I’ve been away for a while. What year are you in?
Hermione seemed even more lost at that.
—You got to start calling me by my name, wouldn’t want our parents to wonder…— Malfoy comented.
—Mister Gaunt, normally i would be perfectly at ease with this progress but, as I’m sure you are aware, your father asked for my help specially with your case, he is determined that you should do well in this school
—Have they reached any conclusions? — he asked tiredly.
Ron grabbed her by the shoulder and subtly moved her away from him.
—What? —she asked faking surprise —.Isn’t he exited to be a big brother?
—You made it so — he said right back, getting angry himself.
—Ok, like before
—Hooow you been? — the tried asking.
—Ignore them — Tom told him in a way that seemed light, but Harry knew it was the end of that conversation—. Eat the meat at least, the doctor said it would help.
—Yes, a year in a comfortable house, elite school and complete freedom, what a terrible punishment— Tom said more sternily this time.
—Riddle — The voice greeted him cheerfully. Tom was not fooled by it —. I just heard the most wonderful thing, your son is back in London?
—Are you in a public place? — Tom asked instead of answering the question.
—Im sorry, sorry sorry sorry — Frank came in with hurried steps, carrying a gym bag that he threw on the table in front of them —. I ran into a police car, got paranoid, drove around a little etc — he stopped to get a bit of air —.So, do you have the money?
—I just don´t want you to get your hopes up, Tom is even taking Milo to Norway this summer, you know is so he can make connections, he wouldn’t introduce him to that community if he was even considering not to make him his heir
Narcissa gave her best fake smile as Bellatrix went on complaining about the pregnancy. Her parlor room at Malfoy manor had never seen so much negative energy.
—Hello
Narcissa clicked her tongue and willed herself to have patience. He caught herself mid eye roll.
—Smaller
Ron walked up to his sister and sat beside her on the stairs.
—Well, at least he has mine— he muttered pursing his lips.
Harry laid on the bed, cellphone agaisnt his shoulder, listening to Draco going on about how the last day of school had gone. He was not his preferred source of neither information nor entertainment, but Ron… he could never be trusted to answer his messages, let alone a phone call.
—ah! — he let out in surprise
—What are you doing here? —she asked in a clipped tone that had them all go quiet for a second.
Draco and Regulus stayed silent for a second, surprise visible on their faces.
—I´m back in England now
—Don´t you want to be here? She has asked about this multiple times
—What are you talking about?
Tom was already bored even with the short interaction. He clicked his tongue an took a deep breath to muster patience.
—And have they decided on the name?
Harry pocketed the phone again and focused on Hermione, she was gushing.
Bellatrix grabbed her purse taking a Ziploc bag out of it. She then reached for the abandoned coffee cup on the other side of the table and took off the lid to put it inside of the plastic bag.
—Legally I have no ground to refuse them from taking you, unless you have something else to tell me… — She gave him a pointed look, waiting for him to say something.
—Call it what you want, I don´t want you near my son
—I assumed so, but I don´t know, my Mom doesn’t talk about it
Harry moved around the food on his plate and regreted having said anything. Dinner today included Sirius and Bella, and they always managed to somehow move the conversation in a direction that made him uncomfortable.
He finished closing his backpack and raised his head to see Draco already crossing the door.
—I’m very sorry about Morfin — he said anyway, because it was true. Whether Bellatrix was or not deserving of any feelings on his parts, he was sad about Morfin, and that sentiment extended to her even if only by association —.   I just heard and…I don’t know, i thought he was back here, doing well
want to drag us deeper into the community, that they probably don´t like pure Lyons breeding with humans and here you have seven looking to do exactly that
—O darling! —A maid came out with a pack of cigarettes, probably looking to have a smoke in peace —. You gave me such a fright, what are you doing out here in the cold morning?
—She lost it completely after the baby— Draco stated bluntly.
Ron frowned.
—Mom you need to calm down
—Shit I got to find the birthday candle, I lost it somewhere here — he said looking around —. Tell me if you find a wax 14 laying around
Draco frowned confused
—Milo is only thirteen— Was Tom short answer
She turned over and opened it.
Tom scoffed at hearing that
—. I have you listed as missing but …you don’t seem very lost to me…you seem more like a runaway, and there is always a reason for those, I wouldn’t want to relocate you in a dangerous environment, so if there anything we can do to avoid that…
Harry shook his head, not believing she had even uttered such a poor justification.
—We have the beginning of the year party coming up so they are probably going to be messaging like crazy, but is not always like that, I promise
—I don´t know, we heard screams, they had to take aunt Bella to the hospital — Draco said rushing his words nervously in a manner that Narcissa could barely understand him.
Regulus started laughing.
—. I Heard you went to the zoo recently — one said, taking a plate nearby to offer him biscuit. Harry took it perking up.
—I´ll take it from here — The maid looked at him startled for a second before nodding a short curtsy.
—…Then why did you have me? — He knew, really, that he was just an accident. A one-night stand that no one thought was viable and had miraculously been born… at the cost of his mother’s life… All that was something he would not dare to bring up —. I can die by catching a mere draft— he said instead.
—Umhh I don´t know… my relatives here are taking a trip to Greece… —
Harry drummed his finger on the table considering her.
—I should have negotiated lunch at least —he muttered quietly to himself.
My mother always says it, Sirius biggest accomplishment was convincing everyone he is harmless
—Alright…how much longer do you think it will take? — Remus asked
They talked for a bit longer about other things before hanging up and Narcissa sat to consider.
—Dad said
—You don´t need to expose all my personal life like that
—And you though you were on the clear? After what you were caught doing — Tom said giving him a pointed stare.
—What did your parents say exactly?
—We could press the issue — Tom continued—. But Sirius will be taking care of your record being erased, and for that to work we should not put any more attention to it
—Oh I thought…your cousins name …—Victor started unsure.
Harry was so dumfounded by the observation that he bursted out laughing. It had been ages since this had come up.
—Uhmm Thank you — he said slowly, clearly not meaning it —. Cute?…that’s…never heard that one before
He was so stunt, processing everything that was being said, that It took him a bit to really understand the last part.
—What?...Why?
—A year?!
—Whatever you mean by that? Milo
—Some…
—Hello
—Uhmm yeah, I didn´t mention it? — He tried to remember but he probably didn´t, it wasn’t a piece of information he offered on introduction.
It was outrageous to him how she was giving up all blame. Him winning? when? Winning what?
—Oh my, Regulus hot as always, but who is the friend?
—Really? — Lavender asked surprised, not getting the tone —. But you so are, I’ll introduced you
—Bella had it painted again, She wanted green, but it turned out too dark — he said searching for a place to put his gift.
—There is another snake at the school?
—What?
He glanced at the woman and considered she could be of at least some use after all.
—Hello there Malfoy, happy birthday — he said deadpan, understanding Ron message.
—it would bring her peace of mind if we stay
—What has you so impatient? is the same as every year—Pansy asked him.
—He is not hiding — he said with a fake light laugh.
—How did the shopping go? — Harry lazily took the bag from under the table to show him.
—What could possibly be wrong with him, and then you withdraw your ambassador from our school, one can only imagine what is going on over there
"The one book calls it 'Sea of Lube,' Harry. Just think what that might mean to us, okay?" He bobbed his chin, indicating the nearly clear surface of the table before them. "Work table. No people—not even a house elf about, cluttering up the scenery. Brand new Sex Magic lube spell, guaranteed to slick us up like never before. What say you?"
The Seek spell returned but a faint eerie glow, settling about the forms of both boys. A little like a halo, quaerat aliquis simply advised each young Wizard the other was actively present, by limning the taller one's fair hair to a shade warmer than white-platinum and lending an inviting gleam to the green eyes blinking steadily behind their lenses. And by chiming, ever so faintly, like fairy wings jingling. A pretty little charm, it was one of Flit's current favourites.
to be together, Harry. We
"NEVER! Arsehole!" The epithets came through in spotty blips, thank the Three, sounding more like an obscure dialect than anything. Perhaps Orkney. "Pipsqueak! Interfering! Do-gooder!
person we'd expect to see you going about with. To Hogsmeade, I mean." She shrugged but not terribly apologetically. "It's only natural, Harry. Really."
"No problem," he replied, equably. It wasn't, really. He'd expected worse, but evidently Potter had anticipated a fracas-in-the-making and had averted the coming and inevitable run-in between the other two-thirds of the Trio and Draco for the nonce. "Shall we get a move on, then? Time wastes, Potter."
"Mmmm, " Harry groaned, of the opinion there was no finer taste to be had in the world but this one he was tasting. "Mmmm…"
"Father—" Draco tried. "Father, just stop."
Harry was both vaguely taken with the idea and utterly appalled.
, Hermione. He's looking at girls—females. I should just give up on him."
Harry glanced out the glass patio doors and took in the sight of his other best mate, wholeheartedly engaged in playing some sort of very messy game involving paint and Charmed bubbles and miniature catapults with his very small daughter, and laughed and laughed. Draco joined in, fondly.
"R-Really?"
“Absolutely this evening; count on it!" Harry interrupted as Draco eased gingerly back into the hearth, raising his hand preparatory to casting down the floo powder. "No take-backs, mate. I'll poke my head through yours 'round five, too. To remind you. I know how you get when you're all in, Malfoy, don't forget. A dungbomb could go off and you'd never notice. Sooner than that, if I can wade my through this Merlin-cursed mess on my desk. Same old Floo connection, I'm assuming? Brilliant! ‘Bye for now, Draco!"
“NO!”
"Yes." He blinked up at Draco from behind the thin shield of his spec lenses, exuding earnest intent. “
“Then cease ogling
Valuable, that. Draco knew for certain, for he'd insisted on his right to purchase Potter's matching one, despite the prat's useless protesting.
, as the Mu…ggleborns said!
Perchance it was the abrupt change made to the supper menu, which had veered wildly away from the lighter Continental fare Draco favoured to a diet mostly featuring oysters, steak, salmon, walnuts, red wine and cress.
Right, so….returning to point:
"Ummm…Wow."
Waiting for Harry to come to his senses; that was it. Waiting for Harry to graduate Hogwarts and go out in the world and realize there were far better catches to be had than a relatively disgraced Malfoy Junior.
a great
“In the rear, by the section on Cryptozoology and don’t make me wait, Potter. I’ve rounds after; I’m Prefect. Did you know?”
“Lovely,” Draco commented, coming back into the room, a tray with the dinner accoutrements floating behind, two beers in hand, glasses floating along behind. “Ta. Here.”
Ron, on his other side, gagged dramatically and finally spat out the remainder of his half-chewed mouthful of whatever, square upon the trailing robe sleeve of an unwary Seamus. He’d done it purely for effect, Harry was convinced, the rude tosser—looking for attention, as always, needy git—but Ron must’ve been a little over-enthusiastic in his theatrics, as he suddenly descended into a full-fledged choking fit. Another one, rather.
He was…unmanageable, sometimes-Draco. Harry's lover. Especially for a man far more used to being managed than managing. Harry had to rely on blind instinct and blind instinct clearly demanded he yank the git back 'round to face the music and thus allow Harry to irritate him further; really,
"Ngh? Gah?" he replied, or tried to. That wasn't expected! "Malf-"
"Tell me about it, Malfoy," Harry sneered. He shrugged. "One little word in your ear, mate: Zabini. Besides, I said I was really sorry, Draco," Harry shrugged again and his face fell, losing its sneer for a look of abject misery—and bewilderment, "and I've stopped all that, alright? Not that I ever did understand that whole thing with her, anyway—Sixth Year. I'd've thought she'd give up on her own. Cho did. Patil did."
He’d been eagerly awaiting their dinner date all the remainder of the day, having restored his spirits with a power nap taken on the tatty old settee he kept in his Observatory, and not even the Manor’s latest ploy--all corridors in the entire leading to the Nursery, every single fecking one, and pureed
"Shut up." Draco's words, when they started up again, were razor-sharp and cutting. "You git."
Harry? Some gobbledygoop your friends fed you? Pop Muggle pyschobabble? What about
git! And then bloody Mills, Harry's annoying mate who was a positive vampire for gossip.)
Harry did, with much fumbling and Draco helping him by getting in the way with fingers, pointy nose and curious lips as he struggled to release the staying charm that had held the fiercely bobbing little snitch at bay in its box.
He absently patted the flat of his palm against his full belly, enjoying the motion and the warmth of Harry next to him. Harry, who’d snuck his legs under the hideous rug when Draco wasn't noticing.
Draco glared with one eye only, the other on Potter.
For it shocked him. Truly. How could he have not have sorted this long ago? He was Slytherin—he was one of the brainy sorts, like the Mu-Granger! Why had it taken the sprouting of great fidgety wings and the appearance of a beloved bloody face crammed full of boils in his very own parlour to awaken him to the state of his own heart?
said.
“No, not hardly. But, of course—I forgot, Harry. You don’t know these things, being so very young in years and a Muggleborn, besides. I’ll have to guide you through.”
Draco's lips remained parted; he licked them again, blinking rapidly and turning abruptly away to stare at the faint outline of ambient light wreathing the sole window. Harry hastened to wedge that assumption into the ever-widening abyss he'd just dug, gathering himself up in a coil and falling into a loosely held-together set of fears by Draco's side. The mattress gave slightly as he settled, hands on lap, a tense bundle of over-exposed bits.
“No, no. S’nothing, really. I've been glad of the opportunity to know him better than I did at uni.” Draco smiled carefully, striving for just that proper note of careless graciousness. "Teddy's a joy. A terror, but also a joy."
"Yes! Now help me think, stupid. We need a plan. The fallout's likely to be fucking monstrous."
"Mmmm…mmm." Harry had no energy spare to care. He was a dishrag, and well-used one, wrung dry.
"Get off." Harry twisted his head about to scowl, shifting awkwardly beneath the weight of Malfoy at his back. “Or get in, rather, and stop teasing me. And look, just because you’ve reached the grand old age of eighteen—“
Ron nodded, his blue eyes narrow vivid slits in the watery dim.
Was it Harry's imagination or was Draco's finger shaking? He seemed pale, even for his snowy-skinned standard. And he wouldn't look Harry in the face again, the prat. Kept his eyes on the little box before him, and seemed content to watch his own digit, dancing in the whisper of air layered above the wrapping and riband.
, at least, was safely married off to that naturalist bloke), but. Well, moving on. So, and in a kind, thoughtful, highly personally unusual response to Harry's peculiarities over his sodding Gryffindorks (Draco was first to admit he was selfish, damn it!), Draco had never placed himself in the midst of an in-House imbroglio of this stature before now, nor ever hampered Harry's pressing need to fix things that weren't meant to be fiddled with—
"You're—you're serious, mate?" Weaselbee faltered, his pleading gaze refocussed abruptly and latching onto Potter, as a drowning man would upon a floating spar. Actually, he looked more like a Crup pup who'd been kicked in passing would: wounded, vastly betrayed and likely more than ready to yelp and whinge about it. "'Cause please don't, mate, if you are. We'll take your word for it, right? No more—no need. Ah!
“Oh! Of course!” Harry leapt to his feet at the audible snap of Draco's teeth, grabbing up his wand and tossing his outer robes pell-mell over one shoulder, already moving towards his agitated friend. "Wait! One tick; let me send Millie a quick Patronus, let her know I’m out for the day.” He faffed his wand about and the famous Potter stag coalesced in a winking, already pawing the expensive carpet it floated over and snorting inaudibly. “Wait--I am, aren’t I? Draco? Out for the day?”
It had to be that: one word, two syllables, a name. An unusual one, by Muggle standards. The only one in the world like it, just as the git was the only git in the world who could do this to Harry. That is—make his eyes wet in public; send his mates into a gnashing-teeth, silently overbearing sort of fury on his behalf—render an entire restaurant full of fiendishly curious diners hushed and hungry as jackals for the next unfurling step of this melodrama they'd embarked upon together—he and Draco.
