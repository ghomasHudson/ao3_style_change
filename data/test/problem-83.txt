“I…” beside him Harry glances over at Hermione, looking worried, before he nods, “Yeah, I’d imagine. I think cousins?”
“I bet he’ll be something like a… fox! Tricky little bastards and they can puff up when they get upset!” Pansy says, far too excited.
“Dobby does not know, Young Master.”
Draco ignores them, instead keeping his focus on the Boy-Who-Lived.
“I just think you’re thinking too hard on this! This guy sounds like he doesn’t actually enjoy all the attention. And if I’m able to gather that from your clearly biased stories, well…” Max leaves the rest unsaid, but Draco gets the picture.
His father immediately looks furious while his mother just looks sad.
Was this all just residual damage from the past? Or more recent?
“Deal!”
Usually, Draco would have left the moment Longbottom appeared, but today… well, Draco needed to rant to someone who knew the whole situation, which Max could not be, and wouldn’t snark Draco’s head off, which Eve would do.
So the world knew about Voldemort. They knew Harry and Dumbledore had been telling the truth and that a great evil was now bearing down on them all. Which lead to the question likely every single one of them was asking.
It was as he was getting up to head back inside that he spotted Rex across the street, watching like he always did. Draco arched a brow at the mean-looking dog before scowling over at it.
Tuesday.”
Unfortunately, not everyone is as excited as Draco would like as Graham Montague, the new Quidditch captain, steps forward with a shake to his head. “This is fine and good what you’re doing, Malfoy, but do us all a favor and keep your extracurricular interests to quidditch. Nobody really needs this stuff.”
“It’s still shitty,” Draco admits with a shrug, glancing down at the vinyls in front of Potter with a cursory look. “I won’t say it’s not. It’s just necessary. Everything’s gone to hell in a hand basket and they have to be incredibly careful with everything they say or do.”
“Why would I need to do that when you have managed to do so well sabotaging yourselves?” Draco purrs, leaning forward and smirking darkly up at the ginger. There is very little humor in his actions.
“What’s wrong with glasses?” the Gryffindor demands, frowning.
Draco, very abruptly, wants to vanish from this conversation and maybe also existence.
He picks out the school books on his list quickly, plus two more books of spells for grades 2 and 3, and every title McGonagall suggested for him. He also grabs a book called
“Yes mother,” he lowers his head in mounting shame. He was a fool to have listened to Max so readily. What did some… annoying, magicless Muggle know anyway? They’d only been talking for two months. Draco should have known better.
“I’m sure it does, but I have Harry to think about now. I have to make sure everything is done properly so I can get him out of that horrible place as soon as possible.”
he wishes he could do more.
“That’s brilliant!” Potter takes the camera to look at it, searching for some kind of sign that it is magically altered, but finding none. “You three invented this?”
“We’re likely running straight towards a bunch of Deatheaters. Sorry, Draco, but that likely means your father,” Eve says bluntly and Draco flinches, looking away. He can feel the cold anger beginning to mount in his chest at the realization and he grinds his teeth to keep from saying anything. They needed to focus and a temper tantrum wouldn’t help them.
“Hardly seems fair,” Draco grumbles. Behind him the rest of the class is slowly moving out of the classroom and making their way past for the Great Hall and lunch. Again, Harry shrugs. He doesn’t have any kind of response that will please Draco and they both know it. Maybe, if they were lucky, Lily would cool off after a few classes? That would be nice.
“That would be a highly inappropriate thing for a Hogwarts professor to insinuate to one of his students,” Snape had replied coolly, hardly even looking up.
“Exactl-- I’m sorry, they believed
Potter stiffens, like he’s suddenly very frightened by what Draco has asked, and he still isn’t looking at the blonde. Feeling bold, Draco’s loose fingers shift to instead hold and squeeze Potter’s hand, running his thumb over the knuckles.
“I’m sorry, what? You ride a motorcycle?!” he demands, ignoring Harry’s snicker to his side.
“These people are out to get us!”
“She’ll be fine,” Pomfrey assures, with a small smile and nod. “She’s been taken to St. Mungo's, but she’ll be back in perfect health, I am certain of it.”
~ ~ ~
He doesn’t know who starts moving first, if he’s being honest, but one second he and Potter are flying in weird formations around each other and the next they’re both bolting after a flash of gold in the sky. Draco blinked and he was moving, that was all there was to it, and he doesn’t hesitate to knock roughly into Potter’s side.
“He vanished your potion this morning…”
“So…” Harry begins, tapping his fingers on his knees, “Are we…” Harry pauses, reevaluating whatever he’d been about to say, and Draco waits for him to sort it out. “What should I tell Ron and Hermione we are?”
Max had told Draco of stories where the villain was an evil witch and Draco had secretly rolled his eyes at the absurdity. Now… now he could see it.
“And besides,” Draco shrugs, looking back at the reporter, “You don’t have much of a choice, now do you?” he reminds her and her scowl is something to behold. That’s right, she was still under his thumb and he intended to keep it that way for as long as he could. “We’re graciously giving you all these great ideas, too, do you really have room to complain?”
Maybe he was being paranoid…
“Dumbledore has other things to worry about than me. He’s made that very clear,” Potter hisses, sounding resentful and hurt, and Draco wants to hit him for being so stupid. Yet, at the same time, Draco feels like he can understand.
“Someone,” Draco starts, but his voice breaks on the whisper and he has to start again. “Someone is out there, right this instant, plotting something terrible against you, and tonight, when you would most likely be out, alone, I see
He had ideas from years of conversations with Max, but Max was a very unique, and very American, individual. There was no telling how much of it was actually considered fun by the masses. Eve, who had agreed to join in after a single message from Draco, had a few ideas such as the mall or a spa, but while those interested Draco, he wasn’t sure if they would interest Potter.
Draco didn’t even mind Max’s or Max’s father’s rambling. They’d ended up in a new room, this one outlining the specific branches of each major power’s armies. They’d already gone through the Allied Forces and were now on the Axis Powers.
“A marvelous first step in magic development,” Flitwick says, applauding Draco and making him blush again. He then turns to the page on Lumos and pulls out his own wand. Draco mimics him a second later. “Now, this one already exists, and I can show you it,” Flitwick says, handing Draco back his notebook on the page that reads “Colorful Lumos?”
Okay, think. Draco had to think. It made sense, then, that the Weasleys would have left if the victim were their father, and Longbottom had said this all began because of a dreadful nightmare Potter had… A nightmare likely linked to Voldemort, which meant…
The motion is slow but with a purpose, Harry’s lips soft and gentle against Draco’s, not demanding anything but begging Draco.
Draco cannot ask many questions in his household. “Why?” is the most heinous of questions, he has learned, and he is very careful when he asks it.
Eventually, the sound of fighting picks back up again, distantly, and Draco puts a bit more hustle in his steps. He twists around fallen shelves and, when the debris becomes too thick, he leaps gracefully up toppled metal and stone.
“I’m over here!” Ginny’s bright, cheerful voice calls from across the room and Draco lifts his head to see she is sitting with her foot up on a stool. She’s grinning, seemingly in great spirits, and a little bit more of the tightness in Draco’s chest eases. “Totally fine and on my way to a full recovery.”
“Lovely! But you haven’t been told off by me, yet, so buckle up.”
The buzz of the clippers cuts off any question or demand Draco might have for them, Eve yelling over the noise, “No more talking! Only shaving!”
“Probably,” Draco agrees, not in the mood to even think about the implications of his sexuality. He takes a deep breath, releases it slowly, then turns sharply and begins marching down the halls. “Astronomy Tower. Come on,” he orders, but Potter is already walking beside him, keeping up the suddenly urgent pace. “I am surprised Filch has not made himself known,” he says, not really caring, but it fills the suddenly tense silence.
They stand side-by-side in the circular chamber, the walls beginning to move and spin and shift around them, doors being lost in the motion. Draco can see why this would be disorienting to an intruder, but he hardly gets confused. He isn’t paying close enough attention for the shifting walls to throw him off. He knows from all the files he’d read that it won’t do him any good.
Here is Years Two and Three! Wow, this got a lot longer than I expected. I originally planned to have years 2, 3, and 4 in chapter two, then 5, 6, and 7 in chapter three, but that isn't gonna work out, so this'll be a four chapter long story instead.
“Yeah, except he’s probably going to kill
“Hello,” he says in a distant, haunting voice and Draco inwardly groans. He had been really hoping Tracey received her strange behavior from her mother, but no luck. They would just have to deal with this now.
The book club had quickly morphed into a study group, Draco, Eve, and Hermione going over texts and notes constantly. It was nice, having Eve there. While it didn’t take away the stress, she could at least give them a breakdown of how the exams were structured, allowing for them to pinpoint more specific subjects to study.
How could one man function with so much hate? It was a mystery not even Max or Max’s parents had a ready answer for.
“You’re very fluffy,” Eve observes, crouching down beside Draco and reaching out to run a hand through the fur on his back. It feels heavenly, but she doesn’t do it for long. “Snow leopards are meant to be spectacular jumpers and climbers. Want to give it a shot?”
“How legal is this?” Potter demands, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees.
At the moment.
“Yeah, Evangeline, you broke my heart,” Draco smirks, enjoying the tables turning as Eve slowly turns a blue glare on him. Although, as fun as this was, it was nice to see Eve’s mother hadn’t disowned her daughter like she’d feared. Draco hadn’t even known Eve had finally come out to her mother.
“No room,” Draco immediately says, almost on instinct, and Potter rolls his eyes and shoves his way in anyway.
“I apologize for not bringing you with me,” Draco suddenly says, looking to Harry’s face, too tired to make the proper expression but hoping his voice expresses his unhappiness. “But you must understand why you couldn’t come…”
Alright guys, school's getting hectic so it may be a bit longer before the next chapter comes out, but I really hope you enjoy! The start of fifth year, here we come!
He was impressed. Ginny was an observant, clever girl. It made perfect sense that Harry would miss his godfather, miss any form of trusted adult, after everything. Harry wanted guidance and help, but not the kind his friends could give.
“Perhaps now you will stop complaining about Mr. Potter for a few days and focus on your new position,” Lucius says flippantly, making Draco snicker in embarrassment. He didn’t complain about Potter
“You don’t talk much, do you?” Draco questions Vincent rather bluntly, making the shorter one look at him with a startled expression. The expression then turns panicked and he looks to Greg as if to ask him something. What, did he need the taller one’s permission?
“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” Millicent coo’s, hands coming up to her cheeks mockingly.
“Wait…” he says slowly, eyes widening, “Wasn’t Quirrel sitting in front of Sinistra?” he questions, “How could he have known she was casting anything?”
~ ~ ~
“I will remind you,” Tracey promises, as if this were a normal conversation. Maybe, for her, it was…
” he says clearly, like he’s done every morning and evening since the full moon nearly an entire month ago. So much for storm season, since it took the weather this long to get to this point…
“Of course,” McGonagall says with a nod, face forward as she walks but obviously still paying attention to Draco. “You should note, however, that your supply list says you may not own your own broom as a first year.” Draco doesn’t care, he doesn’t care at all, so long as one day he’ll be allowed to try out flying. He loves being up high, has a habit of climbing every tree or climb-able surface he can come across, much to his foster family and Hermione’s dismay.
(See the end of the chapter for
“’Very painful death,’ he says. He really IS crazy,” Draco mumbles just as Dumbledore is continuing.
“We could have planned this better,” Harry whispers, voice high, and Ron audibly gulps.
McGonagall is smiling faintly at him when he looks up at her, his jaw hanging open, eyes wide in amazement. “Magic,” he breathes, blown away by it all.
~ ~ ~
Potter jumps a little, leaning away and looking back at Draco with wide eyes, before glancing back behind him towards Hagrid’s hut. There is movement inside and Draco can occasionally see the half giant walking around inside.
They both grin at Madam Pomfrey when they walk into the hospital wing together.
They’re all exhausted from the night prior, for while they weren’t running after Umbridge like Draco had been, they’d still been up late, worried and anxious, with the rest of the DA.
No luck, however. Not for this game, anyway. She had said ordering a broom would probably be the best option at this point, but he shouldn’t worry too much since Sinistra’s Turbo XX was in such good shape.
I think this is the longest chapter yet? Hope everyone enjoys it! I certainly enjoyed writing it!
The song plays a lot of instruments Draco doesn’t know, with a violin mixed in somewhere, with a high pitched singer he thinks might be a woman, but he honestly isn’t sure, and he looks back at their selection again. “Night Fever” (1977) by The Bee Gees.
“Did… did she…?” he asks weakly. Had what just happened to him been foul play? Had Vivian done it and Harry stopped her? But the older girl hardly seemed the type to attack anyone unprovoked. Or try to kill someone at all, for that matter.
The whole room rattles with aftershocks from the explosion, cracks scaling up the walls and ceiling, but just as Draco is resigning himself to his fate of being crushed by falling stones, they stop. He looks up, laying on the outskirts of the flat, central section of the room. The witches and wizards who aren’t bound struggle to their feet, Lupin is clutching his head and the girl is looking around, baffled.
“We got the information. What more do you want?” Draco growls.
It had been mortifying to stand there, in Snape’s office, slowly realizing exactly what he knew. Draco had probably glowed red from the embarrassment, remembering Snape’s almost casually comment of, “I feel the need to remind you that every Potions textbook has a variety of reliable poisons to choose from.”
“I apologize for my mother,” Eve says, lowering her book to look at Draco.
He blinks and he’s up in his room, throwing up his very soul and weeping, his mother trying to calm him down as best she can.
No, instead she had finally excused the rest of her Inquisitorial Squad, save for Draco. This was because she wanted to drag him down to speak with his godfather, likely thinking Draco’s presence would somehow put Snape in a better mood.
“That is quite proactive of them,” Draco finally replies, picking up his Wicca book and smiling faintly at the radio. “What other services have you attended?”
“It wasn’t your fault, Harry,” Granger whispers, running her hand up and down Harry’s bicep in a soothing gesture.
Draco waits, quietly, eying his radio with wide eyes to see if Max has anything else to add. When he is certain they must be done, he says hesitantly, “When I was little, I wanted to be a dragon when I grew up.”
.oOo.
But then Potter deflates with a deep sigh and he looks a touch sad. “You have to stop doing that, you know.”
“I feel more relieved knowing what’s going on than when we were in the dark,” Harry mumbles, takes a shuddering breath, and looks up. Granger offers him a sad smile and Weasley reaches over to pat his shoulder. When Harry looks back to Draco, he’s smiling a little. “Thank you for figuring all this out.”
The Ministry was arrogant when it came to break-ins. Draco realized that long before he’d ever become acquainted with the Golden Trio and had noted a severe lack in magical defenses when visiting his father’s office.
Draco really doesn’t care about the rest of the sorting anymore, all the people he’d cared to see sorted are already at their tables, so he looks at Harry properly. The boy is still pale, his eyes wide behind his glasses as he stares down at the smooth wood of the table. He has his hands clasped tightly together and squeezed between his knees like he’s trying to keep from fidgeting, and he looks like he is about to implode.
“A transfigured ferret? So this could very well be a really pissed off teapot?” Potter snarks and Draco turns to offer a hiss. “Oi! Watch it or you’re back to pouring earl grey, mister,” Potter snaps back with just as much attitude as Draco’s hiss had contained.
“I think Harry just thought… better of you.”
They all certainly have “creepy stare” mastered. Maybe next they drag in Luna.
“THE Draco Malfoy?”
Lupin appeared to be responding well to it, however.
Draco wishes he
When Thursday finally came Draco couldn’t stop fidgeting and somehow he’d been pulled over to the Gryffindor table for breakfast with Harry without noticing. In a surprising twist of fate Sophie and Daphne also ended up joining them, also looking anxious. Draco supposed fear over something could bring the most unlikely people together… Sophie had her hair styled like it was already being blown back by the wind and her face was down as she shoveled food into her mouth, while Daphne looked particularly green despite her best efforts to look proper as she asked Hermione questions about her Quidditch books.
Now they just needed to start planning “Operation Scare the Crap Out of a Murderer with a Moving Corpse.” This should be fun…
“What’s so special about your camera…?”
“I’ll say,” Draco agrees. “How many volumes are there?”
“And this… Griffin-door-handle,” Draco snorts at the name, “Totally juked you at the last second?”
Draco takes ahold of the door handle and pulls, the heavy door opening for him easily, despite the weight.
He still manages to get up in the morning, somehow, in an attempt to go back to his normal school schedule. It should be easy. The DA is safe. Dumbledore is still in charge. Umbridge has nothing. Edgecombe has been dealt with. Sure, the wandless lessons were probably going to be cancelled, but everything had played out the way Draco wanted it to.
“Has girl talk begun?” Draco questions, crossing his arms and leaning against the doorframe. Eve smirks at him and Granger must hear his voice because she looks over.
~ ~ ~
His mother didn’t mind unless he spoke on it too long, so most of the time Draco’s excited talk about playing hero fell either on the house elves or Max.
“No kidding…”
“Quite.”
A goblin that looks decidedly older than many of the others is sitting there, writing on some parchment with a quill of all things, and it takes everything in Draco not to question if they have ever heard of a pen. The goblin completely ignores them as they finally stop in front of him.
“I’ve heard of some terrible injuries occurring while on a broom,” the girl says, twisting a strand of hair between her fingers. “Did you know there was a man in Belgium who crashed his broom and his arm turned inside out?”
Instead, now Draco just felt hurt.
The second time was in Draco’s bed in the Slytherin dorms, right after Draco had returned from interviewing Huang-Jun and had desperately needed a shower and rest. He doesn’t much count that one either, since it had been only a nap and, afterwards, Draco had been panicking too much over his housemates to really appreciate it for what it was.
“But that would mean I could get it, right?” Harry questions, hands moving to grip his own knees now that he doesn’t have the file to hold. His expression is intense, a far cry from the giddy, happy smile he’d been wearing a few minutes ago.
“Dunno. We’re all Slytherins, though. Resourceful! Can’t you come up with something?”
“Well,” the blonde says after a beat, grudgingly grinding his teeth, “You thought right. I have no earthly idea where I am.”
“Professor M-Moody did,” Longbottom says, which makes Draco rather confused. Why would Moody be handing out Herbology books? Yes, everyone knew that Longbottom adored the subject, but why
~ ~ ~
“We need practical teaching for our O.W.L.s, though!” Granger says sharply, looking horrified, before she very suddenly sobers and eyes Draco meaningfully. “That’s not what she’s worried about, though.”
“They have ghosts in them. I wanted to free them,” Tracey says back at Harry.
“I don’t care what you think,” Draco snarls, out of breath, but so, so close to his destination.
It leaves Draco confident for the exams. Still stressed, and his stomach still twists with anxiety as he heads for the first of many OWLs to come, but confident. Definitely confident.
The Dark Room, which seems self-explanatory to Draco, where the study of dark magic takes place and the only way to access it is through the Blood Quarters.
“But we’re not with you?” Harry demands. He’d managed to step completely up to Draco’s side by then, wand loose but clearly a threat if Duke tried anything funny. The giant wizard looks at the wand, then up at Harry’s face, his attention shifted to the Boy-Who-Lived.
~ ~ ~
He can’t seem to jimmy them open, either, and he’d hardly know what spell to use to fix something like this.
“So much for our rescue mission,” Blaise whispers, seemingly picking up the same feeling Draco was in, and his head sags. “Now we’re the ones who need rescuing.”
All the doors look the same but Draco prays it is the one that leads to the Locked Room. Things were going bad and they needed to regroup. Everything was a mess, but it could be so much worse, and Draco suspected the ball had yet to truly drop.
“Me and… Voldemort?” Finally, Harry tears his eyes away from the file, looking up at Draco, searching for answers.
“They’re there now! We—” Edgecombe opens her mouth to reply, but Draco is suddenly cutting her off.
“I do not have an idea…”
“I suppose it could be a powerful charm the family put on it, but, no, I’ve never heard of this happening,” Draco replies with a shake of his head. This all seemed rather bizarre, and interesting, but not worth the investigation it was receiving. Leandra’s parents could have easily put a charm on the Geoscript so that only their daughter could view it to ensure it wasn’t shared with anyone else. Leandra was a very trusting girl. Of course they would want to take precautions.
” he says and the cloak begins to expand until it should be large enough to cover the entire group of them. Theodore immediately gets himself under one corner of the enlarged cloak, Tracey burrowing in after him, but Draco quickly sees an issue.
mean,” the blond deadpans.
“Fear, perhaps. Old standing pureblood beliefs, I always suspected, however…” McGonagall holds up a hand before Draco can interrupt her with more comments, her eyes demanding his attention. “They proved they were not like You-Know-Who. They proved that when they had you and fled. The way I understood it was that they wanted to get you, Draco Malfoy, away from that evil man,” she shakes her head and releases another, heavy sigh, now looking out the window to the backyard. “But he caught up to them.”
“We can look her over in the Locked Room,” Eve says roughly before moving forward quickly. Without a word, she and Tracey begin helping Longbottom heft the unconscious girl onto his back.
“Y-yes!” Draco says far too loudly, then cringes and looks away. “I’m fine, Longbottom, I was just on my way out.”
“It’s a Suicide Curse?!” Potter nearly jumps up, looking horrified, but Draco just keeps giggling. It seems to be just enough to keep the boy from storming off and telling a professor that Draco has lost his mind.
“But you’ll ruin that woman’s life,” Potter argues, looking a little panicked, but Draco shrugs.
And he doubted they’d be able to calm down until they had the Galleon sitting in their palms, but at least they had a place to start.
He was still young for any promises to any families to be made, but it wouldn’t hurt to start looking and making connections. His mother had suggested he start looking at Hogwarts, hoping he would be excited to have some say in the matter rather than leave it all to her and Lucius.
For a while after the train had started moving Draco had been listening to the CD player. It seemed the CD he’d first tried out was full of earworms, songs that immediately wanted to get stuck in Draco’s head, so he didn’t much mind when Vincent and Greg asked if they could see the Muggle device. Hermione set her book down long enough to help guide them through the buttons, explaining their purposes and how the CD player worked. The two wizards seemed awed as they took turns wearing the headphones.
His terrified yelping and squeaking bounce off the stone walls, Mrs. Norris’s hisses and yowls not far behind, and he has to weave and duck out of the cat’s claws every few meters.
The club falls and clonks loudly over the troll’s head, making it waver and sway, eyes going cross-eyed. Then it begins to tilt backwards.
“And I told you I still don’t believe you.”
Potter stares up at him, breathing deeply, his arms tightening across his chest before he throws his head back and exclaims, “Again?!”
“You all are traitors! Blood traitors!” Millicent roars and… Draco doubletakes. It looks like there’s actual tears in the girl’s eyes. It isn’t an attractive sight, but it’s mostly baffling. Was she actually upset over this? Had she really thought that, after the DA, everyone would get onboard with her and her crazy train? “Blood traitors and a fucking mudblood!”
When he finally makes it to Moody’s office the sun has begun to set and, thankfully, the castle has finally begun to properly vacate for the third task of the Triwizard Tournament.
Friday morning arrives in spectacular fashion.
Draco gulps, looking back at Max with wide-eyes. “Why…” Draco pauses to swallow, “Why did they do this?”
Now Potter looks up, frustrated, and begins to snap, “Back off, Mal--” Draco steps forward quickly, however, shoving the other boy into the wall behind him. When Potter moves his hands to brace himself, Draco takes the opportunity to yank his left hand forward by the forearm. He doesn’t think he’s all that much stronger than Potter, but maybe his Animagus form has added some power to his human body, too, or maybe Potter’s more exhausted than he’d realized, because even when Potter struggles to pull away, Draco is able to keep ahold of his arm.
The only concerning aspect seems to be Edgecombe, but that’s almost natural by now. She seems jumpier upon returning from Christmas Break, which doesn’t surprise Draco too much. She had gone home to her family, last he heard, and would have likely seen all the things that have been concerning her this entire year. Her family’s reputation was on the line, after all, and she’d likely been reminded of that over her vacation.
She nods her permission for him to continue, despite looking confused, and Draco reaches closer and takes the chain around her neck between his fingers. He slips the Time-Turner off her head, the sands almost done falling in the little, imbedded hourglass. Granger looks somewhat sheepish now.
“Harmony and entropy, you mean,” Eve says, but then her brows furrow, “I don’t actually know what entropy is, though.”
He smashes down on the thought, crushing it beneath his mental heel, and forces himself to focus on the here and now, in his bed, with his boyfriend beside him. It’s a much nicer thing to focus on.
Draco shifts through the crowd as the twins continue to cause havoc, keeping Umbridge and her Squad as busy as possible. The blond makes a show of “fighting back” against some of the DA members trying to make things difficult, but he’s having a hard time keeping his grin down.
“Is that that girl’s name?” Harry asks, motioning with his head towards the closed compartment door and Draco nods at him.
The little dragon takes a deep breath and then lets it out. He shifts, moving from Weasley’s shoulders to curling up in the ginger’s lap. “I recall my ceremony for receiving my Pearl. Mine was made of opal… And now it is gone.”
“Malfoy, you’re talking very fast,” Potter says, eying Draco nervously as the blonde begins to pace about the tower.
He and Granger exchange a look, somehow communicating the exact same thought without words.
“Good night, Eric. And good night, Max.”
Mr. Davis does not answer immediately, instead finishing up the file he’s on like he had before. When he looks up at Draco he looks as distant as he always does.
Mr Nubble had made everyone pancakes, a rare treat, and the kids had dug into them the second they had set the table and everyone had been given a plate. Despite Frederick being the favorite, most well-behaved child, it was Draco who had the best table manners. Ada had said he looked posh, so Draco had said she looked barbaric.
Much to his gratitude, Eve does return a little while later, carrying his satchel, and he digs out some Muggle candy for all of them to feast on. Weasley digs into his PopRocks as soon as they’re handed over, Hermione accepting a pack of Skittles in gratitude, while Draco and Harry share a box of Junior Mints.
Oh well, it wasn’t like he intended to interact with them much beyond the initial mission into the Ministry’s Records Department.
“But the difference between you failing and me failing, you see, is if you fail you’ll just lose a game of Quidditch, but if I fail I could completely destroy the feeble foundation keeping the Order afloat and put everyone involved at risk, including you and your friends,” Draco snarls viciously, eyes narrowed, and Weasley glares right back. “Your rigorous desire to be someone ‘important’ is pathetic and insulting.”
“But you’re a Slytherin,” Longbottom blurts, then clamps his mouth shut as he realizes what he’s said. He looks terrified, eyes darting down to where Draco hides his wand, but Draco makes no move for it.
“Traps! They rigged the surrounding corridors with traps!” yells Montague, just before he trips over some kind of sensor and another, brightly colored explosion is set off.
he’s a human, and he’s laid out… He takes a moment to twist his head back and forth… He’s laid out in the Hogwarts infirmary.
“That’s a compliment,” Potter smirks weakly, looking up at Draco through his hair, and for a second Draco feels the air in his lungs catch and hold.
“Lovely, so that was all for nothing,” Draco growls, fists clenching around his mug in frustration. A moment passes and then a hesitant hand is sliding over his own fingers, easing up the tension, and Draco looks up at a weakly smiling Harry.
“Aren’t dose… REALLY benemous?” Longbottom questions, also looking a little spooked.
do not need to do anything. I will go to speak to the Headmaster, if it will calm you down, but you need to focus on your final task.”
“Yeah, that’s what I said.”
“Go away!” he yells, arm shaking like a leaf as he snaps a picture, the flash startling the creature enough that it momentarily reels back. Draco grabs Potter’s wrist in the meantime and yanks him back. “Run, Potter, you moron!”
“If you were at home, Max,” Draco begins, radio in hand as he walks down the sidewalk of a cookie-cutter neighborhood, eying the plain-looking Muggle homes all around him with a disgusted scowl. “What kind of person would you least like to see knocking at your door?”
“It’s the humerus bone,” Draco says, squeezing at his own bicep to indicate which one that is, and Eve gives him a strange look. He shrugs and offers no further explanation.
A little while later, their food finished, Draco convinces Harry to let him teach him how to dance to “Thriller” when it comes on. It’s a mess, everyone laughing hysterically, but Draco doesn’t care. He’s happy and content.
This lock does not open as easily, but it does not require a Shockwave Spell to burst it open, either. This time, Draco’s small Reductor Curse is enough to make the lock spring open and the lid to snap up.
“He woke up screamin’ bloody murder,” Weasley says and Potter cringes, ducking his head even further.
“I am glad you are enjoying yourself,” McGonagall cuts into his thoughts and he looks to her and she’s smiling kindly at him, “But we cannot stay for long. You are more than welcome to explore on another day. For now, collect some of the coins so we may be off.” Draco nods, feeling a new, eager energy in his veins as he turns around and begins scooping gold, silver, and bronze coins into his backpack, careful not to damage Mrs. Nubble’s phone.
Behind him Eve whistles, impressed.
“Stop smirking.”
“I still don’t like it,” Sirius snarls.
Hate hate hate. That was all Lucius spewed. Even when Draco would bend over backwards for his father he still grew tired of it all quickly.
“Just like that, yes. And before you ask, yes, I got Dumbledore’s permission,” Draco rolls his eyes. “He wasn’t so sure at first, kept spouting shit about safety, but after plenty of assurances about sticking to Muggle London, arguing that you would surely need some time away from all the stress, and showing him my new camera, he grudgingly agreed.”
” mixed in with, “They were just- just- just BABIES! They didn’t KNOW!”
“Say ‘please.’”
“My Prince Charming,” Potter sniffles, the shake in his voice sounding like he’d been going for a light and airy tone but failed. Still, Draco goes along with it.
“What are the houses?” Draco asks, brows furrowing in thought. He remembers McGonagall saying his parents had been very proud of their house down at the Malfoy Vault, and he remembered her mentioning if she thought he’d be sorted into something called Ravenclaw. Were these the same things?
Air catches in Draco’s throat and he stops, their dance over, but still clinging to each other, like somehow if they look at each other that will ruin everything.
“I’m from America. Playing tourist with my parents and my stupid older brother.” The kid turns to motion towards what must be the rest of their family. The father is making a fool of himself, his oversized glasses slipping down his nose as he excitedly examines every single plaque, sign, and exhibit. The mother is smiling at her husband, her features round but elegant, which surprises Draco. Muggles aren’t meant to be elegant. The apparent brother is standing even farther away with weird earmuffs on that have a string attaching them to a little, black device.
“To my knowledge, no. Much of the potion-making process has been to do with light, or lack of. My assumption is it must bask in the light of the lightning strike,” Draco looks up at the dark clouds above. He spies a few flickers of light within the clouds, plus the rumble of thunder, but no strikes.
“Or it could be useless,” Draco suggests casually, allowing the words to sink in as the Gryffindors turn back to him. “It’s just a theory… but what if Voldemort only
~ ~ ~
Once the radio goes silent, Draco shrinks it down and stashes it back in the hidden pockets of his bag. Then, he’s sagging back against the brick wall behind him, taking a deep breath of the fresh air. The Astronomy Tower wasn’t exactly comfortable, but it was familiar in a way Draco loved. He’d really missed getting to sneak up here these past few months.
“The Love Chamber is locked to all but a select few officials due to its dangerous, unpredictable nature. The Locked Room, however, locked itself so long ago that no one knows what is inside anymore,” Tracey says, swaying back and forth where she stands as they work around her.
A muffled, gleeful, “Oh damn,” can be heard from the other side of Flitwick’s door.
“Well, there’s Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin,” the boy says, one of his hands counting up to four with his fingers.
“Well…” Draco pauses to think of his answer, turning back to Lucky in front of him. It seemed completely content to stay there so long as it was getting affection and attention. Like some kind of giant, skeletal puppy. “This one is certainly friendly,” he offers, glancing at Umbridge. “But that’s just animals, isn’t it? Some are friendly, some aren’t. Kind of like people.”
Thankfully, he doesn’t have to wait long until the girl is hurrying back out of her dorm, a bag under one arm, and a fistful of Jelly Slugs with one already dangling from her mouth. It takes her a second of finagling - with no help from Draco - to shut the door behind her then turn towards him.
He stiffens, and then his growl is getting even louder.
if anyone is interested! I'd love to chat or answer questions!
“Hey, man, if Harry says he’s cool than let’s give him a chance.”
“Luna!” Tracey’s voice calls out as the invisibility cloak is pulled up enough to show everyone piled underneath. Weasley has been moved to drape over Blaise’s back, who looks especially displeased about it, and Tracey, with a blank face, waves at Luna frantically.
“We’re doing better,” Harry offers, finally sitting up straight to look back at the girls. “Are you guys okay? We heard what you did.”
The massive room feels pleasantly familiar as Draco steps inside. The filing cabinets are still as tall as the ceiling, the far side of the room is still too far away to see, and right in the middle sits a desk where the form of Terence Davis sits.
A while back, sounding like his father would have been a highlight to Draco’s day. Now though… Now he didn’t really want to know…
“Did you speak to Ginny?” Draco asks and immediately Potter’s gaze is back on him.
~ ~ ~
Lucius is sure to have a better hold in the Ministry soon.
So, all in all, a mess.
“People are staring,” Eve hums to him, winking over at some Beauxbaton student when she catches her eye.
It could be so easy for them to fix their own problems, but Draco knows that nothing like that will be happening anytime soon. The Ministry intends to scapegoat the hell out of anyone that dares disagree with their presentation of a safe, perfect world where no harm could ever come to any witch or wizard.
Draco, Harry, and Hermione share a strange, confused look, however. Okay… Weird…
Granger has pinched her lips into a thin line, clearly displeased, but staying strong. Weasley nods, not having too much issue with this. And Potter… well, the glare is gone, but now he just looks hurt and unhappy.
“Anguis!” Theodore calls as they get near enough to their common room, but then he runs smack into the unchanged brick wall and falls backwards onto his rear, clutching his nose.
Except Harry is making motions with his fingers, familiar and sure, similar to what Longbottom is doing, and spells are still flying from him.
Then they see Hogwarts.
“I will survive,” Draco eventually sighs. Theodore grunts in agreement, knowing intimately what having unstable family was like. After all, after his mother’s death, Theodore’s father had never been quite right again.
With Educational Decree #26 in effect it left students and teachers unable to speak outside of accepted material from their classes. It was a nightmare, especially right after the Azkaban break out, and it had left many of the teachers clearly furious.
Despite looking out of place, however, he is still perhaps the most welcome sight Draco’s had in a while, and the blonde smiles and moves towards his bed. Harry looks up as he arrives but doesn’t even get a word out before Draco is flopping down, face first, on top of the covers.
“Hey, Draco!” Sophie appears at Draco’s side, leaning over the armrest of his chair, and making the blonde look up at her. Her hair has been transfigured into a long mohawk that hangs to one side. “Good, you’re working on homework. Help me with my Transfiguration! I got the match to turn into a needle, but now I can’t go back.” It’s a demand, not a request, and the girl only seems to pause to reach out and pat Muddy’s head. “Hi, Muddy.”
“No, I do not!” Max continues, seeming to not even notice Draco anymore as their rant goes on. “I will figure out what I want to do when I actually get to that point! God!”
“No, but I’d rather not climb up there,” he replies.
“Don’t tell Daphne that. She’s going to want a far more romantic story,” Eve smirks over her book. She and Granger both have matching
“I call it my trump card,” Draco says, just as Eve shuts her book and smacks both Weasley and Potter’s knees with it, glowering at them to shut up already.
Narcissa Malfoy wasn’t full of hate. She may express displeasure, or frustration in some rare cases, but she was mostly a private woman who focused more on herself and her son. She wasn’t hateful, but rather indifferent.
“So, our studying abilities will change based on how we learn?” Draco had surmised. He’d never heard of these learning styles before, but then again, Max’s mother was a neuroscientist. She knew a lot of how the brain worked.
“So what? Traditions suck anyway.”
Potter smells like cheap cologne, which he probably got for the dance, sweat, and a back drop of chocolate. Probably all the chocolate he’s stolen from Draco, actually…
“So… because he hates me he’s no longer a suspect?” Potter questions, not looking like he fully believed Draco.
“I regret to inform you that I have no intention of dying anytime soon,” Draco says, attempting to be light, but Potter just whimpers.
“What is it?” Sophie asks, everyone glancing nervously at Pansy like she might strike out. Which, considering her track record, wasn’t a baseless fear. “Did you buy the wrong shade of lipstick for the season?” Sophie seems to be the only one not afraid to sass the other girl while she’s in this mood, but given she’s four seats down and on the other side of the table… Well, it might explain things.
Narcissa looks over at her husband, something going unsaid between them, and Lucius turns to step out of the room. Draco watches him go, his shoulders sagging, but then Narcissa is crouching before him and setting a manicured hand against his cheek.
“Do you believe in fate?” Draco asks conversationally, smiling too sweetly as Longbottom’s brows furrow in first confusion, then consideration. “I was just considering it the other day, wondering if we’re all here because something else preordained it.” He makes a show of moving his hands with the words, like he’s telling some great story, and he almost hears the scrape of Harry’s eyeroll.
“Would we be bothering them at this hour?” Draco questions. Fang has managed to lay across his feet by then, the huge, cowardly dog much more familiar with the blonde after he had requested to take so many pictures of him in the past.
“So… what do you say, Nev?” Eric says brightly, a sharp noise coming through the radio that sounds like hands clapping. “You wanna try and approach those horses?”
He was also confident in calling Trelawney a seer, not just because of the file on Harry’s prophecy, but also because of something Harry had told them earlier.
“I don’t live in the swamp! I live… near a swamp.”
In the end Max buys a “yoyo” and Draco a “slinky.” He can’t bring himself to even look at the WW2 themed toys. And besides, Draco thinks, as strange as his slinky might be, he probably got the superior toy because, whatever a yoyo is supposed to do, all Max manages to do is tangle their own feet up trying to play with it and trip onto their face.
“What of Peter Pettigrew? You know he’s still alive! You have proof!” Sirius argues at one point, and suddenly Fudge’s attention shifts towards Draco, his eyes narrowed.
“I’ve never had a day out before,” he admits quietly, staring into his cup of tea with a distant look in his eyes. Draco and Eve glance at each other worriedly, before focusing back on Potter.
The muggle religion Draco likely knew the most about was Wicca, only because of the book he currently had been skimming through, and even then his knowledge was bare. Despite Max mentioning going to church before, or going to Sunday school, or going to Catholic school, they just didn’t talk much about the religion they had been raised in.
“Tootsie?” Harry and James both say at once, both tilting their heads, but Lily’s eyes, so much like her son’s, brighten immediately.
Draco, afterwards, made sure to do the same for Max whenever he could.
“I… don’t think that’s it…”
“Then she will be fixed with gold and be more beautiful for it,” Tracey says when she shifts upwards again, staring at Draco with her blank eyes, a dollop of mud rolling down her hair.
“As do I,” Draco agrees, reaching to grip the wrist of the hand Potter was flexing, but freezes in his movements when Potter flinches back. Draco’s brows furrow, confused, and he glances down at where Potter was attempting to discreetly hide his hand away. “What is it? Have I managed to piss you off again without doing anything?”
“Oh, that’s… thank you,” Harry blinks, stepping into the office.
“Did-- Where-- You… Were they on your head?!” Harry demands but Max only laughs brighter, not seeming to realize how much they’ve ruffled the Boy-Who-Lived.
“The lying was unexpected, granted, but I
“Yeah… they are…”
The bell at the front door jingles again and the witch looks up. She pats Draco’s arm and smiles. “I’ll be right back. Don’t move, please,” she says then hurries off. It takes Draco a moment to realize that her measuring tape is still flying about him, taking measurements in seemingly random places. He wasn’t sure why it was important to measure the circumference of his ankle for robes, but the measuring tape apparently thought it necessary.
“I-I’m not sure! This is… What if I regret this later?” Draco splutters, hands shaking where he holds the potion, the suddenness of it all sending him for a loop. He thought he’d be ready. This was supposed to help, be his trump card, but was it really worth it?
The actual act of convincing Umbridge, however, is a lot more difficult than he’d hoped for.

The light casts long, brilliant rays and shadows amongst the trees, standing out like a beacon in a storm, so soft and elegant in its safe glow.
“Well, sure, but not how your name suggests… It always reminded me of something, too, and after third year it didn’t feel right anymore.”
“That’s right,” Granger adds brightly, being shaken out of her own surprise as she also hurries forward. “All of the Unforgiveables require a clear path from caster to target.”
“You didn’t miss much,” Ginny shrugs, acting as if it’s nothing, likely because she knows it will drive her brother up the wall. Draco really likes this girl. Why hadn’t they sat down and talked before?
“Man, why you gotta call me that?” Max whines.
“We shall not miss his complaining, however. We are happy to see such a curse on this land leave our midst.”
“No way! It was way too loud for that.”
“We will deal with the wand last,” McGonagall decides with a nod, “The rest of your supplies can be retrieved at once save for the cauldron and your robes.” The elder witch pauses to look at Draco thoughtfully. “You are also allowed a familiar.”
“I think it shimmied a little, but that might just be the wind,” Potter grumbles, then looks over at him. “You?”
But Harry’s expression of surprise and concern seemed legitimate, much to Draco’s own surprise. “Well… I just thought…” the boy trails off and looks positively miserable, now. It was so pathetic Draco wondered if it could even work on McGonagall.
“You are very devoted to my recovery…” Draco says, baffled by the change in Max’s behavior.
“I wouldn’t finish that, Mr. Malfoy,” says a rough voice and Draco looks back sharply at the person he’d run into, the blood quickly rushing out of his face and, if it could, fleeing his body.
it wouldn’t.
“How?”
The two boys don’t waste a second, hurrying over and slipping into the vacated office just as the door is swinging back closed. They don’t even say anything, focus set, as they hurry to the fireplace. Draco pulls out a vial, filled with a portion of the special floo powder, and uncorks it. He pours half into Weasley’s palm.
~ ~ ~
“It’s a Remembrall,” he explains, looking sheepish, “Everyone in my family knows I forget stuff a lot. This was probably Gran’s idea, actually… This tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten. Watch, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red- oh…” Neville’s face falls as the smoke in his Remembrall turns scarlet, “You’ve forgotten something…”
“Let me guess. The Order is staying quiet?” Draco had asked, certain no one could hear him. They’d begun layering silencing charms and disillusionment charms around their table. Their friendship needed to remain unnoticed by Umbridge, after all. They were certain none of the Gryffindors would ever rat them out, Slytherins didn’t betray their own, usually, and Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws likely didn’t notice nor care, so they mainly needed to remain hidden while out in public.
He had met Hermione Granger many years ago entirely by chance. They did not live in the same neighborhood, but they did live close enough. Close enough that on a walk home from school Draco had been surprised when a shoe fell squarely on his head.
“Higgs is a menace,” Draco growls as he jabs his fork into his lambchop, “He won’t leave Harry alone because he, and I quote, ‘Stole my rightful spot as Seeker, the half-breed cretin.’ Who says cretin anymore? I mean, really!”
“Malfoy danced with every girl he could get his hands on,” Potter adds, kicking at Draco’s shoulder and smiling when the blonde turns to glare at him.
“Not that, you dolt!” he near screams and Longbottom’s eyes widen. “The radio! Don’t… you can’t tell anyone. No one can know! They’ll take it away and I’ll have
“Hello, cutie-pie,” Skeeter speaks up, leaning against the desk and smiling at the man. He blinks slowly at her and has absolutely no reaction beyond that. “We’re here to look into a few persons of interest, if you don’t mind. I’m sure you heard we were coming.”
“Other than train? Apparently me and Harry--”
“That’s it! Sorry you gotta deal with that toad…” the Muggle trails off momentarily, before coming back with, “Hey, do’ya think she’d turn back into a prince if a princess kissed her?”
“Thus,” Draco nods, “rather than a memory of your happiest time, you must think of a time when you felt strong.” He pauses, making sure that everyone is listening properly, and then begins to recite everything Professor Sinistra told him. He goes over the specifics of how the spell works and which memories work best. He explains that everyone’s survival instinct is unique, thus their memory must mirror that. He goes over the incantation and wand movement - or finger movements in Longbottom’s case, courtesy of Sinistra.
On Monday he woke up earlier than anyone else and rushed out to the front garden, weeding it and tending to the plants while talking quickly to the snakes. He had all three of their attentions today, which he thought was nice, with Shadow staring at him, Snowflake slithering around his trainers, and Muddy demanding head scratches.
have become an animagus,” Draco hears Harry growl to himself as they begin to move, but he’s ignored.
This meeting is special because they are finally starting full lessons on the Militus Charm.
“We will speak when we return home. Your father should also be a part of this.”
“I do not know,” Dumbledore says honestly, smiling sadly. “I certainly hope not, and myself and the rest of the staff here at Hogwarts will do everything we can to keep you all safe, but these are dark, confusing times, Mr. Malfoy. It is best we are all prepared for the worst.”
“What is it?” Sirius asks urgently the moment he spots Draco’s expression, his hands coming up to grab the boy’s upper arms and steady him with a firm hold.
Podmore was, apparently, a member of the Order of the Phoenix that had been missing a few weeks back on the day of the Hogwarts Express’s departure. It made no sense for him to be doing what he was doing, breaking into the Ministry, but they had next to no information on where he was even attempting to get to, and thus did not know where to begin assuming his motives.
After a truly impressive struggle on their end, Draco winds up having to accept his fate as Max recounts some of his more expressive stories about Potter. Clearly plenty of terms have been Muggle-fied, but Potter seems to catch on quick enough, and grins brightly at the radio in his hands, occasionally encouraging Max on.
” Then, she taps the tip of her wand to her own cheek and abruptly her face is lighting up with specks of light. They twinkle across the bridge of her nose, and the skin around them takes on a bluish-black hue.
Bell and Johnson end up low to the ground as well, flying after him, and a quick glance up tells Draco that Flint is being covered by Spinnet. That makes things easy, Draco thinks, as he hurls the Quaffle to Pucey with no hindrance. The momentum almost gets thrown off again by the Bludger, however, but one of their own Beaters, Tina Kite, smashes the half-sentient ball out of the way.
sensationalized enough, while not being fearmongering,” Draco assures and, blessedly, Dumbledore gives it some thought. He goes back to stroking his beard, humming and thinking, before turning sparkling, blue eyes back to Draco.
“Then the killer may start panicking,” Eve says and the blonde nods.
“Tell me about it. She yelled at me the other day for not making my bed! Like… I’m going to get in it again tonight. Why make it all over again? Are we having guests? What guests are you bringing into my room, woman?!”
of all people? He had no reason to be nice to Longbottom. It wasn’t like he was doing well in his class.
Finally, after many minutes of silence, Sinistra patiently watching, Draco sucks in a sharp breath. It had been a passing thought, but abruptly his head was being flooded by very particular memories.
It didn’t help, either, that so many of them had been so vocally supportive of the Ministry while it tried to cover up Voldemort’s return. Draco didn’t like those particular people, hated them with a passion even, but not even he was interested in the cruel remarks some of the other students were throwing at them.
“Are you surprised?” Weasley says, “That man has a wand so far up his own ass he’s probably ONLY capable of spitting curses.”
Draco had no idea if he was any good at taking pictures, but he had his disposable camera on him at all times while at Hogwarts. He had to be sneaky about it, snapping pictures without the flash when no one was paying attention, getting candid shots of the Slytherin common room, Crabbe and Goyle rushing ahead of him to class, the castle grounds, the Gryffindor table during breakfast.
“As I said, once we have sufficient information, print whatever you please. In addition… any further stories you may have, every possible article you want to print, you will run it by me first.”
“Salazar, really?!” Pansy looks over, grinning in glee.
Potter is giving him a strange look, like he doesn’t believe Draco, but also like he’s a little relieved. Draco hates it. Potter being relieved by something Draco says doesn’t sound right. “So, then, do you have an idea who it might be?”
The tapping sounds again and Draco realizes it isn’t from the direction of any of the dorm rooms, but rather from the windows. The windows that look out into the lake. The windows where a large merman currently floats.
” Max cackles and Draco pouts at the radio in frustration. “I can
What was wrong with Muggles?!
Fudge straightens up at that, seeming to preen under the praise of a thirteen-year-old, but Snape isn’t falling for it.
But, Merlin, Harry looked like he was drowning in the stuff and it made Draco’s brain go funny. He must have been making a face, too, because Harry looked far too smug as he returned and plopped back down into Draco’s bed. It didn’t help that the blond couldn’t find the right way to move and was just frozen there, like an idiot.
“Were you scared?” Max asks brightly. Draco had just returned from a Halloween Ball a family friend had held for the pureblood community and he was positively exhausted. Despite that, he had still called up Max, wanting to talk to the young Muggle to help Draco relax.
That last one was pure wishful thinking and Draco falls back onto all four paws.
“Humans or wizards?” Draco asks absently, still looking into the water. A few fish swim by, but nothing bigger.
“Be that as it may,” McGonagall waves off the surprised look on Draco’s face. Had she seriously just agreed with that? “We are not here to gossip.”
“You didn’t
~ ~ ~
“I’d rather have a few wounds here and there, which will all heal, than a dead boyfriend,” he says simply, reaching out with his right hand to circle Harry’s wrist. The boy’s heartbeat isn’t too fast, it seems quite calm actually, so Draco is relieved about that. Harry wasn’t working himself up into some panic or rage over this.
Harry shrugs, helpless. “I worried you may just see me as some guy following around The-Boy-Who-Lived. A shadow, or a fan…”
“’Insulting?’ How the hell is—”
“Best option is to put a physical barrier between yourself and the caster,” Draco says firmly, taking a step forward, hands folded behind his back. Tracey and Luna’s matching, dreamy stares flick to him.
“Better?” Granger smiles pleasantly up at him and he sighs, trying to calm himself.
“It just seemed strange, that’s all,” Potter shrugs again.
“Hello class,” the witch begins, stepping to the center of the circular space. There is no obvious front, nor desk in sight, but everyone still turns to her and offers their full attention. She looks over them all, eyes calculating but devoid of any major emotion. She seems to be looking at every single person, looking them over, and her eyes linger momentarily on Draco. He stiffens, expecting a new surge of pain, but when nothing happens and she moves on he is left confused, but relieved.
“Again,” James smirks.
Potter stares at Draco with an open expression, yet Draco cannot place exactly what that expression might be for. Then Potter is smiling and ducking his head. “Thank you,” he says quietly, and Draco immediately turns red.
“Had to pick somethin’ up fer Dumbledore, ye see,” the giant man nods, sounding proud of himself, and Harry jumps in.
“You would know,” Granger grumbles and Draco rolls his eyes skyward. He really wanted this table, damn it. It was perfectly hidden away from everyone else and got the best light.
But then Mrs Nubble was standing, silencing him before he could make any rude comments, and swiftly walked towards the office. A moment later and she was back, hardly gone for long, and handing over a folded sheet of paper to McGonagall. “He arrived on our doorstep the 23rd of June, 1980 with only that note. This is all we know,” she said, a tightness to her voice she always got when talking about these things.
~ ~ ~
“We’ll get him out,” Weasley mumbles as they hurry through the Ministry. “One day, we will.”
“Only when I’m with you,” he says, then flees before either girl can retort.
“There’s nothing wrong with Slytherin,” the blonde says sharply. It was only the second day and he was already having to defend his house’s honor. This felt near comical if it wasn’t so serious.
The shape then begins to
“First time seeing Hagrid, huh?” Ron questions and Draco has no idea what a Hagrid is.
“Plus me!” Vivian cuts in, poking her head into Draco’s view and grinning. “If Professor Sinistra tries any funny business I’ll throw down, no questions asked!”
“Yeah, the bloody moron did,” Montague shoots a displeased glance back at Crabbe, who looks like he doesn’t want to be there anymore, then faces Gryffindor again. “Pity your own Beaters are shit, though. Game over or not, shouldn’t they have been watching Potter’s back? Or were they too busy babysitting little brother Ronnie?”
“Nah,” Ginny says, then looks up and grins at him. He hates her a little bit.
It takes him a longer time to figure out why he can see them, but his mind soon supplies that fateful night atop the Astronomy Tower when he’d seen Barty Crouch Jr. murder his own father.
His eyes also linger on the three Gryffindors at the front of the congregation, but he does his best to ignore them. It had only been two days since their argument, but since then they’d hardly even spoken or looked in each other’s direction. He’d seen Granger and Eve speaking together a few times, but otherwise Draco was left out.
“I had no idea,” Harry whispers, staring at the ground and allowing Draco to pull him around the castle. “I had
fit in with these red and gold losers.”
Just then the bathroom door opens and Blaise reenters. All three boys look over at him in alarm, and he looks back. He catches sight of the little, brown snake curling around Draco’s hand, stares at it for a very long time, then looks at Draco with an arched brow. “You really were meant for Slytherin, weren’t you?” he questions, the first thing Draco has heard him say yet, then he shakes his head and turns to his bed, mumbling, “Pet snakes… jeez.”
“There might be beasts in here that no one has ever heard of before!”
“Voldemort, you mean?” Draco says blandly and both boys flinch like they’d been startled. They probably had. “I was just an infant, I haven’t the slightest,” he continues, forcing his voice to be calm and conversational. “But he’s dead and gone now, so who really cares, right?”
“Blindfolds? Is that why they’ve always been such awful players?” Potter questions with fake innocence and Draco shoots him a glare, before sighing deeply.
“I have decided to sponsor your Quidditch team,” Lucius says in way of greeting and Draco’s brows rise. He looks over to Flint who has a self-satisfied smirk on his face. The captain nods at him.
“I’m afraid so. Wizards like my father and the Death Eaters and Voldemort… They have manipulated society to believe something else… and at one point I believed it too,” Draco sighs deeply. “Leandra
“Potter,” Lucius says abruptly, like he’s in a business meeting, and Draco’s ears flatten back. He doesn’t know if he’s frightened or angry anymore. His emotions are tumbling and twisting in his chest and he needs to get ahold of himself. They’re still in danger, they can’t give up yet, but they can’t make any sudden moves without being struck first.
Draco arches a brow at him, before smirking and leaning forward towards the three. “Over the break, Eve mentioned magical beings known as Lung Dragons…”
“Because that is what you did,” McGonagall replies, fully facing him now, her hands clasped in front of her. She was thankfully taking this very seriously. “After You-Know-Who fell, you seemingly disappeared. No one knew where you had gone. We only rediscovered you three years ago.”
“Blimey…” Weasley looks between the two boys, his eyes wide and his eyebrows so far up they nearly disappear in his fringe. “You told me about his help last year, but to actually see it… I feel like I’ve fallen into the wrong timeline.”
~ ~ ~
“My family’s a bit much,” Ron says with a sigh, looking over at the crowd of gingers. He makes a pinched, confused face before looking around, mumbling something about a “Fred and George” and wondering where they went.
“Ron and Hermione were upset, too,” Potter says with just the faintest of smiles.
“Here,” Leandra cuts in, then hurries over to the stone wall Daphne had created at the beginning of class. She steps behind it, waits a moment, then pokes her head out again.
“Rest. I know we both need more,” he advises and Harry hums in agreement, before raising a hand to card through Draco’s hair.
“I dunno. We’ve done pretty well so far!” George laughs, winking at Draco when the blonde looks at him in confusion.
Dobby had even brought him one of the most hideous pairs of brown mittens he’s ever seen, but the house elf had been grinning so wide Draco could only offer a tight smile and nod back.
Like after she had, for the first time, pushed Draco to consider his future betrothed.
“I had this spell for detecting lifeforms, right?” Weasley continues, clueless to Harry and Draco’s conversation. “But it was limited and I got bored and I started messing around…”
“Alright, what’s wrong now?” Draco asks blandly, ignoring Potter’s concerned looks. Potter didn’t know, yet, that Max could be just as dramatic as Draco. Neither knew who had rubbed off on whom, but it was there, now.
“Okay, okay, so… basically your school has four dorm buildings, but they organize you all based on…” Max pauses, trying to formulate the right wording, “How you act?”
Then they get to Cho Chang.
“We need back up from the community,” Granger agrees with a sigh. “I understand that patience is key here… but even I am growing tired of all of this.”
The skeletal horse beasts look to be gathered around the corpse of an animal, too torn up and half-eaten to be properly identified save for tufts of fur. The bloody, meaty scent is disturbingly appealing to Draco in this form and, feeling disgusted by that, he swiftly shifts back into a man.
“I could sleep in those jack-o-lanterns,” Tracey comments at breakfast, staring at the carved pumpkins in the corners of the Great Hall, her eyes sparkling behind her curtain of hair. Draco eyes her nervously but says nothing. He’d learned that was usually the best way to deal with the strange girl.
“It is a versatile opportunity,” Narcissa had cooly replied, Bellatrix clearly not caring about the lack of emotional glee in her sister’s response.
“Professor Lupin, now…” Okay, Draco needed to be careful here. Lupin had been his favorite professor, but the Ministry officials on Fudge’s side all seemed set to crucify him for being a werewolf. Umbridge was likely the same… “His actual teaching methods were quite successful - I retained much from his lessons - but to find out he was a werewolf…” He leaves the rest unsaid, allowing Umbridge to fill in the gaps the way she wanted. The way that would win Draco her favor.
Potter, surprisingly, actually looks a little worried by this as he says quickly, “I like your Animagus form, though.”
He hurries to snatch Harry’s wand, then pulls out his own to point it at the Boy-Who-Lived as Umbridge surges forward and grabs his messy hair. With a vicious yank the woman pulls Harry out of the fireplace, sneering down at his wide eyes, and Draco feels a furious, protective snarl wanting to build in his chest. He stamps it down as Umbridge begins to speak.
Fuck!
They were both eleven, Draco packing up nearly three weeks in advance for his trip to King’s Station and, thus, the Hogwarts Express. He’d been struggling with his cases for a while and had decided to take a break, slipping into his en suite and sitting in his tub with radio in hand.
“Probably,” Potter sighs, sagging.
“What are ye’ three doin’ here?” the giant man says, baffled, and Potter and Granger begin to scramble together some kind of excuse, but Draco is in no mood to wait.
First, Granger would pose the idea to Umbridge, and when Umbridge was sure to deny her Draco would “coincidentally” walk in for tea with his favorite teacher. Granger would leave, Draco would ask what all that was about, and would then proceed to convince Umbridge of its validity.
What DID he want to do with his life?
At least they’d fooled Umbridge…
The blond finally moves forward to help her when it is clear she’s making no progress, and as he opens the door and smiles down at her he coos, “Milady.”
“Why didn’t anyone come to me sooner, then?” he demands, voice beginning to heighten.
“What the hell is a ‘shit-monkey’?”
“You expect us to believe you’re just making the potion to see if you can?” Pansy questions, her arms crossing and hip jutting out as she gives Draco a very unimpressed look.
Draco stares for a long time up at the excited man, not really sure if he believes what he is hearing. “A… toaster… You mean the device used to cook bread into toast?”
that actually feels like
“Regret what?”
“We’ll consider it,” Granger finally decides for her friends.
“Longbottom won’t give me back my radio,” Draco whines miserably, curling up a little bit more, and he feels Harry pat his back apologetically.
“What’s wrong with that?” Harry’s tone has shifted, now. He sounds cold, like he’s somehow separating from the conversation mentally, and Draco can’t blame him. This was quickly taking a turn he had not been expecting and certainly didn’t like.
Muggle thoughts? What does that even mean? And why would it…?
Then he raises his own wand. “And most important, remember that this is no dark art. Fighting to keep yourself and your loved ones alive is not something to be ashamed of, even when it changes us. No one is exactly the same person when they are fighting for their lives, and sometimes that is scary, but it is not dark,” he says, then waves his wand.
“Family emergency. I knew it,” Max says sagely, then adds with a more somber tone, “I’m sorry about Mr. Weasley, though. I hope he’s okay?”
He didn’t even kick Dobby away when he’d sprung forward to wrap Draco’s shins up in a hug. Granger claims his eyes even got a little wet, but beyond that she refrained from teasing. Even Potter and Weasley hadn’t commented after Granger had gone to fetch them.
In the end the only non-Slytherins left are Hermione and Ron. They both look especially startled and lean away when Vivian returns, grinning, red hair wild. “Lemme borrow your CD player for my study session tomorrow and we’re even, Malf-y,” she says simply.
Draco tilts his head just enough to press his lips to the crown of Harry’s head, lingering there as he curls his right arm around Harry’s shoulders to squeeze him as best he can. Harry cries, quiet and heart wrenching, into Draco’s shoulder, his whole body shaking with the shocks of his agony. Draco knows there is nothing he can say to help, all he can do is hold on as tight as he can and be here for this boy.
.oOo.
“Pressured. Not forced,” Eve waves her comb at Pansy for emphasis, which Draco can see out of the corner of his eye.
“There’s a new student in my class this year!” Max shrieks, unperturbed by Draco’s agitation, and sounding giddier and giddier with every word, like they might roll into yet another squeal at any moment.
Slytherin has two, new Beaters in the forms of Crabbe and Goyle. They’re dreadful fliers, but their brute strength makes up for it in their positions. And, with Beater bat still raised, Draco spots Crabbe floating some ways away.

“Harry,” Luna says, twisting away from Theodore and Weasley and allowing Tracey to step into her place. “After your distraction, what happened to the prophecy? Did you get it?”
“The moon,” Tracey says calmly.
“I tell you what, I am happy to be going home,” Hermione sags into her seat beside Eve, also removing a copy of
by William Golding.
“What are you doing with that, then?” Draco stands on his toes and points at the device in Eric’s hand.
Mrs Nubble’s gentle expression drops, however, and Draco quickly sees his mistake. She turns her sharp eyes to Frederick, her favorite, and says, “Take out the trash. I will have no one rummaging through filth against my orders.” Frederick gets up immediately to do as he’s told, ever the obedient child. “Draco. Ada,” both children stiffen and Mrs Nubble takes a deep breath, “Get to your chores.”
Draco smiles, despite the twisting in his stomach at those words, then looks to his mother. Narcissa has been watching the interaction, not eating, but occasionally sipping at her wine. When she looks back at her son, she offers him an elegant, but real, smile. “My son. I will always be proud of him,” she says meaningfully, and it takes everything in Draco not to choke up.
“Thank you. That’s the point,” Draco smirks back at him, then arches a brow and gives the man’s wardrobe a onceover. He was wearing thick robes for the weather that were lined with remarkably thick, grey fur. It made him look like he’d finally gained some weight. “Warm in there?”
“And thanks for the help… uh… strange guy I don’t know?” Max says and Longbottom glances at the radio.
“It’ll be okay…” Neville mumbles, obviously not okay, but trying to put on some kind of brave face. Draco can respect that. He may not see the purpose of a toad as a pet, but he supposes it really isn’t his opinion that matters here.
“It was right funny, though, you know,” Weasley says after swallowing his candy. On instinct he pours a bit more out for himself and Granger, offers it to Potter, and Potter smiles and shakes his head ‘no.’ They’ve begun walking again, weaving slowly through the crowds. “When Sirius first came to the Burrow he nearly gave mum a heart attack!”
“What does that troll have to do with this?” Ginny huffs, clearly not pleased by the name.
In the meantime, though, Draco can easily take over the situation and play it out the way he wants.
They go over the potions they’ll be brewing over the year, most of them sounding very serious and familiar from their potions books, but every other Monday Lily has decided they’ll learn a more fun, playful potion as a way to break up the monotony and just enjoy themselves.
“Right, of course, how silly of me,” Harry sasses, not looking too impressed, but allowing Draco to continue.
“Longbottom better repay me,” he grumbles to himself as he finishes.
When Draco’s undercut begins to grow out in fourth year, he goes searching for Eve without thought. The haircut had been her present and she’d been the one to cut it and style it, so it made sense to ask for her to fix it up again.
“Yeah, didn’t… didn’t have the heart, I guess.”
It was a little freeing to just allow things to be.
mudbloods dangerous? Draco had been repeating what his parents and tutors all said, because they knew what they were talking about, but he couldn’t recall ever being told the reasoning behind it all.
“Yeah. Mom’s excited for me and she wanted me to send dad the news myself,” Harry’s bright smile flickers for just a split second, but Draco spots it, “He’s going to be so proud! Seeker! At first year!”
Sophie, Hermione, and Weasley were awake, much to everyone’s relief. Sophie kept nodding off, but Pomfrey had assured them it was just an aftereffect of the curse she’d been put under. Hermione was going over the potions she’d be needing to take to recover, and Weasley was getting a step-by-step from his sister of all the stupid stuff he’d done.
The smell was dreadful, yet a deep, animalistic part of Draco was making his mouth water at the meat. He stamped down the feeling just as McGonagall had taught him to, but his eyes still occasionally lingered.
“Well then, logistics of that notwithstanding… what did you discover over the break, Malfoy?” Granger sighs, pulling her jacket tighter around herself. Maybe Draco should have brought a blanket to sit on… but then again, he hadn’t thought they’d end up sitting on the ground.
“For expressing an interest in my schooling and childhood outside of your country. It was nice to have a walk down memory lane,” Sinistra says, every word just as blank as the one before, and she bows her head slightly. That was how she was when she was being nostalgic? What did excited look like, Draco wondered?
“Whatever you’re about to say… don’t. I don’t…” Draco takes a shaking breath and runs a hand through his hair. “I don’t think I could handle it right now.”
Draco blinks open his eyes to look over at the redhead in surprise, and Ron is grinning like a maniac, his wand pointed straight at him. “Gotcha!” he laughs, already sounding less crazed than when the troll was moving around.
Merlin’s beard, how had that happened?
In addition, he has her first assignment.
“And he killed them,” Draco finishes for her, seeing where this was going, and he feels Mr Nubble’s hand on his shoulder again. “Didn’t he?”
Ron immediately holds out the card he’s been waving around for a while, grin in place. “Do you have Furmage? I’ll trade you her,” he says eagerly.
“Sirius Black is innocent,” she says immediately, voice frantic, “Peter Pettigrew is alive and the real criminal. Pettigrew got away and Sirius was captured. We have no proof to say that Sirius is innocent, and they don’t intend to give him a trial--”
They all turn, then flinch backwards towards the bare wall when they realize the figures have moved. They still stand exactly as they were, but now their heads have angled so they can stare at them with unblinking, vacant stares.
“Can you hear me?” he says into the radio, a smile growing bigger and bigger on his face.
Red hair and green eyes pop up in his wobbly vision a second later and he glares up at Vivian as she cackles at him, the Turbo XX in her hand, unharmed. “Nice tuck and roll, Dray-meister!”
“And you think this thing could fight off a dragon, do you?”
“That’d be pretty handy,” Fred says with a nod. “A classic.”
Lastly, and most unfortunately, was Harry Potter. Draco didn’t know if it was his disdain for the blonde or if he was just that clueless, but he very often would ignore Draco and go about whatever he was doing. It was also possible, having grown up with Muggles, he was desensitized to cameras, but Draco couldn’t be certain. Whatever the reason, Potter was an easy person to get photos of, and he was always
Moody. Draco needed to find Moody and have him turn him back. He needed to be a human again so he could go searching for Potter and tell him, or a professor, what he had seen. He probably should have told Moody, actually, but he’d been so certain the man wouldn’t help before.
Unless… they didn’t want to destroy it. The prophecy appeared to be the only thing Voldemort was interested in right then. With it sitting here, in the basement of the Ministry of Magic, Voldemort would run quite the risk of outing himself to the public if he showed up here.
“Salazar’s wand, no!” Draco turns to look at Potter in disbelief, “Not unless your Militus is a dragon itself, which it probably isn’t! I am suggesting it be used to distract the dragon, give it something else to fight with for a bit. Whatever you need to do, at least you’ll have some time with this.”
He sees out of the corner of his eye Blaise and Eve emerging from one of the side corridors. The two look confused at all the noise, first, but once they take in the situation they’re moving over to join the Slytherin DA members. Blaise hovers on Theodore’s opposite side as Eve comes to stand on Draco’s.
“I’m glad you didn’t get into trouble,” Hermione sighs gratefully, slouching slightly in her chair. “Don’t ever do that again. You could have been expelled!”
The silence doesn’t do much to calm the very swiftly growing heat in Draco’s gut. It isn’t a pleasant heat, either. It burns with rage and shock, disbelief attempting to block it all off but doing a poor job of it. “He… what…?” Draco whispers, voice nearly cracking, and Max sighs miserably.
“Yes. And it would give you, Headmaster, plenty of incentive in the eyes of the school to set a curfew or safety precautions without appearing like you know the murder took place on the castle grounds.”
“What do you mean?”
“I require a word with you, Black,” Draco begins, cutting to the chase.
Except the Swedish meanings and the magical meanings apparently meant different things entirely. So, dodged a bullet on that one, at least…
Max lets out a long, motorboating sound in clear frustration, not liking the situation either despite not being a part of it.
“Hermione… Are any of the Gryffindors being cruel to you?” he asks carefully and finally his friend looks up at him with wide eyes.
Confused, but not thinking much of it, Draco follows, too. He ends up with a sting ray plush, Eve with a penguin plush, and Potter grabs the largest shark plush he can carry. They’ll have to sneak it past the Dursleys, but if they get back late enough they’re usually asleep anyway.
They’d all boarded the train at separate times but had managed to find each other quickly.
“She doesn’t
“Malfoy, do us all a favor and catch that bloody Snitch already so we can be done with this,” Flint tells Draco on their way back onto the field. Draco says nothing, but he nods. He was doing his best, but even a professional Seeker would have issues in this weather.
“Nahhhh,” Max replies, “You still got that record player, anyway! We’ll keep sending you vinyls and stuff!”
He curses, snarls, pulls at his hair, then finally marches towards Harry’s bed, hopping in.
Eve lives on the fifth floor of an apartment building in the heart of London. Draco isn’t sure what her mother does for a living, but clearly it leaves them pretty well off considering the location.
He pulls back, but keeps his hands on Harry’s arms, holding him as he demands, “What the hell were you morons doing?!”
And that tree over there looks mighty tempting.
“Why do all wizarding words sound made up?” Eve groans to the heavens, leaning back in her chair, then tilts her head. “Also, weirdly sexual…”
More, long windows look out into the lake along the wall, and a circular alcove, much too small for a person, is dug out to the far right with what looks like a circular tunnel leading up and out of the room. Feathers lay at the base of the alcove and Draco realizes, after a few beats, that owls must use this tunnel to get down to them when needed.
allowing this…” the boggart looks at Professor Lupin, “disgusting wretch to instruct you, failing at
“I am not complaining!” Draco complains, glaring at the side of Potter’s head. “This is just stupid! We could have gotten dinner by now if we’d wanted.”
The talk about dark wizards and their parents ends there and Draco goes to finally prepare for bed, feeling confused but, strangely enough, slightly liberated.
“So…” Draco begins, glancing down at Harry beside him. “Do you think that thing was guarding something?”
“The Gameskeeper…” Draco’s voice begins confidently, but then abruptly fades into embarrassment, “Uh… caught me taking photographs of his dog…”
Outside of their study sessions at the library table, Hogwarts was still a mess, but they could hide away in their notes for as long as they needed. Even though they hated studying, Harry and Weasley were far more eager to sit down with the books than sneak around the Inquisitorial Squad patrols.
When the interview is finished nearly two hours later, Skeeter occasionally have to quickly shift into a beetle whenever students walked by, they say their good-byes to Agi and Draco takes up beetle-Skeeter. Next up they’d be meeting Granger in the kitchens to interview the house elves. Then, after that, Potter had offered to help sneak Skeeter back out to Hogsmeade where Sirius would be waiting.
“Indeed. So not only is Pettigrew an unregistered Animagus, but he fled the scene. If he is truly as innocent as you wish to believe, why is he not here? Explaining the situation to us in full?”
“She sounds like she smells like mothballs.”
“I won’t. I’m the last person to judge somebody for a panic attack,” the Gryffindor says, but that just manages to make Draco scowl and, in a sudden bout of fury, he pulls out his wand and points it at Longbottom’s chest.
It is only fuel to the fire when the twins agree with him.
“They’re like acromantulas had a baby with a wasp in the middle of a volcano and covered it with armor,” Potter says, having to maneuver around a stinger that strikes too close for comfort.
“So, Finnigan is your friend again?” Draco asks the twins as he watches Finnigan pale and Tracey continue to stare at him through her curtain of hair.
Dumbledore had filled Harry in on a lot the night prior. The prophecy that Trelawney had told him - although Harry hadn’t wanted to talk about the specifics of that prophecy just yet - that Kreacher had lied to Harry when he floo’d 12 Grimmauld Place due to orders from Bellatrix, and that Dumbledore had been keeping his distance in an attempt to protect Harry.
Theodore raises his hands placatingly, clearly not taking him too seriously but admitting temporary defeat as he turns back into the bathroom to spit out his toothpaste.
Potter hesitates, glancing at the compartment door nervously, until Draco snaps in his face. “Today, Potter, I really am pressed for time.”
Lucius yells, his wand flying away with the attack, but then his furious, grey eyes are back on Draco. He sneers, cold and awful, and lashes out with his cane at the snow leopard’s head. It collides with a crack, dazing Draco for a moment, and Lucius lurches to recollect his wand before Draco can recover.
“Uh, Ron,” George begins, finally trying to step in, but now it is Harry who cuts in.
Maybe it was because of his trip as a ferret, but it doesn’t take him too long to begin reassembling his mind into his new body, at least becoming conscious enough to look up at a wide-eyed Eve. She’s taller than him now, but not as drastic as when he’d been a ferret. He feels big and powerful, but compact.
McGonagall decided the owl could wait until later, which Draco supposed he could understand. They still had plenty to do and having a live animal with them could impede their progress.
“Hypothetically, Fred,” George says, also giving a short nod, fake sympathy in his expression.
“I didn’t mention this before…” Draco mumbles, barely over a whisper, and he looks away. “But during the Welcoming Feast I made eye contact with Sinistra and…” Draco reaches up to grip his shirt, right over his scar. “Suddenly my scar started to hurt like it never had before. Then, just a moment ago, after you ran them off, my scar started to hurt again.”
“Sweet Merlin,” Weasley croaks and Draco can’t help but agree with the sentiment.
“Honestly, why won’t you see it? You’ve liked her since fourth year, and she finally shows signs of liking you back and you won’t accept it,” Granger huffs and Draco suspects she’d put her hands on her hips if she weren’t currently cradling Draco’s dark arts books in her arms.
In fact, it seems to intrigue them more than anything, curious over Draco’s thought process and some of the girls even calling him a “bad boy” while fluttering their lashes.
“No, no, it’s great! Just… y’know. Wondering if anything happened?” Max says with such a swagger to their words Draco is sure they’re teasing him.
“Nope!” Draco says with far more cheer than necessary, and Potter’s expression turns to confusion. “In fact, I am here because
“Each room studies a unique or complex aspect of the magical world,” Tracey says, standing beside where Draco sits. She makes no move to assist in working through the doors.
He would be even more curious if he wasn’t dealing with these dreadful Blast-Ended Skrewts!
“I have it,” Tracey says as she slips out from under her cloak, hurrying forward and throwing her hands onto the brain attacking Weasley. There’s a moment where nothing happens, but then Weasley’s screeching abruptly stops and the tentacles are releasing him and going limp.
Feeling a grin pull at his face Draco looks back at McGonagall. This had to be his wand! He didn’t know what else it could be. The witch has a smile on her face and offers a few, congratulatory claps.
“If we all work together we’ll be okay, but maybe it won’t ever come to that. This is just a contingency plan for Hagrid,” Granger reasons, finally close enough to lay a hand on Draco’s upper arm. She squeezes, urging away the tension, and grudgingly Draco relaxes.
Somehow that manages to startle a chuckle out of the man and he gives Draco a wry smirk. “That’s the worst part, I suppose. Werewolf fleas are particularly persistent,” he jokes. At least, Draco thinks he’s joking.
The first time Draco actively invites such action is on that day, after Draco and Weasley’s trip to the Unhideable Hall. When he gets out of the shower and slips back into his dorm, dressed for bed despite it being midafternoon, Harry is already back and waiting for him. He looks out of place surrounded by all the Slytherin green and silver and black, his eyes glued to the windows that look out into the lake.
The other boy’s smirk shifts into something softer and he steps forward. “I always am,” he says lowly, before reaching out and touching Draco’s brow. The blonde flinches away, hissing, only then remembering the cut he’d sustained from that bloody owl as a ferret. “You should get that fixed up.”
“I don’t play, but I can juggle a ball alright,” Draco shrugs. Until now he had hardly been a sporty guy himself. He wasn’t strong or fast, so most all Muggle sports were out of the question for him. “I don’t follow the League as much as my foster dad, but, by association to him, our household tends to lean more towards Man United.”
Draco arches a brow at her and crosses his arms. If he were to begin becoming an Animagus at this time of the year, without prior advisement from the school or the Ministry, he would end up as an unregistered Animagus, and they both knew that. And if Draco were an unregistered Animagus, too, he would no longer have any leverage against Skeeter.
“I am certain…” Draco begins, struggling to come up with a logical reason for such an action, “Max was merely attempting to test the limits of the human psyche… A science project! They are quite privy to such things, after all.”
Oh, fuck him…
“And this is how you knew where I was…”
“Hate that cat…” says the other person, but Draco is too dizzy to properly notice who they might be. He’s just trying to control his stomach and keep his head from swimming as the boy holds him more steadily.
If his parents were right…
Harry gets escorted back to Hogwarts directly by Sirius Black. Draco knows this because he and Eve end up sitting with Granger, Weasley, and Ginny on the Hogwarts Express and they explain that Harry had gotten into some serious trouble for his fleeing stunt. He had hardly been left out of anyone’s sight the entire remainder of the break and he’d had to be escorted just about everywhere.
She would have been privy to the Quidditch World Cup, but that would be a truly stupid thing to kidnap someone over. So why?
Potter grumbles some more nonsensical nonsense, before finally untangling himself from Draco and the covers. “Gotta piss anyway,” he mumbles to himself, nearly falling out of his bed when he rolls over, then trudging towards the connecting bathroom.
Draco really wasn’t sure he’d even do anything with any of this knowledge, but it wouldn’t hurt to do some research, would it? After all, the Animagus Potion was a third-year subject and was referenced within both Transfiguration and Potions texts.
“You look great, Eve,” Potter squeaks, clearly still recovering over whatever Draco had upset him with, and Eve curtsies to him gratefully.
“I’m afraid that will probably happen often,” she warns. Right, Draco was famous, she’d said. He just hadn’t realized what, exactly, that would entail.
“We never speak of this,” Weasley eventually mumbles, breaking the silence, his expression grim.
“Nothing you don’t already know,” Draco shrugs, “As I said before. You will reap the benefits working for me. I do, however, require you to begin looking into Barty Crouch and where he might be. My beetle on the wall.”
“I think he wants you to pet him,” Luna says without looking over and Draco shoots her a glare, but then reaches out a hand to run his palm down the hard, skeletal snout. He’d run his hand over the flank and neck of the thestrals that pulled the wagons before, but that had been it. He’d never had the chance to just stand and pet one.
It doesn’t take Sophie long at all to trim then shave Draco’s hair into something acceptable, but she does take her time styling and lecturing on how to manage the strands. Draco has no choice but to listen along to the crazy girl with the multiple sharp implements at his back, but he doesn’t really mind. It’s nice getting to know someone he was already familiar with.
Chapter Song:
They make their way downwards, into the depths of the castle, and Draco pulls his robes a bit tighter as a chill sets in. Right, the Slytherin dorms were in the dungeons. Figures they would be cold. It was probably a good thing he preferred the cold, then. He always preferred bundling up in warm, thick clothes and curling up somewhere. You couldn’t do that in the heat.
“I never actually said that was what I wanted,” he says carefully, “Just that it sounded fitting.” He ducks his head, thinking not for the first time which house sounded best to him. Slytherin did sound like him, but if Hermione got her wish would that mean they would be in different houses? Plus… this was the house Voldemort had been in. Sure, so had Merlin, but part of Draco felt rather uncomfortable imagining being in the same house as the man who had killed his parents.
Everyone else does relatively well, especially with Lily’s constant assistance, save for Tracey Davis who makes straight acid that she smiles at as it eats through her table. It’s a tad bit concerning…
Eve got most of his letters, the girl getting quite a few carefully worded rants from Draco on a pretty regular basis. Pansy and Blaise, who knew even less about the situation, still wanted to chat about his summer and the rumors he was shadowing an Auror. Tracey Davis even sent a letter to Draco saying her father was back at the Records Department and Draco should drop by for tea some time. Her actual wording was weird… but the thought was nice.
“You only started summer break five days ago,” Eric is saying, sounding impressed.
The easiest solution Draco could think of, thus, was dragging Longbottom out to deal with one of his safer fears, which lead to Longbottom’s panicked stuttering, which lead to Draco growing irritated, which lead to him shoving Longbottom none-too-kindly into the clearing housing the thestral herd.
“Snow leopard,” Eve nods, her glare back on Draco, “Like he needed anything else to stroke his ego.”
Potter snorts and mumbles something about Draco really being a housecat, to which, while still purring, Draco plops a massive paw over his face to shut him up.
“ME?!” Weasley yelps, clearly startled to have been picked. Everyone knew the ginger was Draco’s least favorite of the Golden Trio, but he’d thought about this in detail. He knew he’d end up having to take one of these heroes to keep them happy, so he had to consider which would be best.
“Lay off, Malfoy. It’s not that big a deal,” Weasley says, giving Draco a side-eye and Draco snarls.
They end up in an empty room and the truth quickly tumbles out.
Then, like a bucket of cold water, the Death Eaters arrive and Draco is out and running without a second thought. He momentarily feels bad for the Muggle family being tossed through the air and tormented, but then Draco is reminded that these are
“Why would we lie about that?” Draco narrows his eyes. He had had a feeling he was going to eventually get this talk from Harry’s friends, but that didn’t mean he was just going to bend over backwards and take it.
The sound of hissing behind Draco has him coming to a halt in the middle of the corridor. That… was not a good sign. In fact, that was a bad sign even when Draco is human, but as a tiny, defenseless ferret… no, that may just be the worst sign of the evening.
The Golden Trio notes his worry first, but they glance away, and Draco just feels worse. When he glances around the room, finally, the twins offer a blunt explanation.
“Nothing smart to say to that, ferretface?” Weasley snaps, crossing his arms over his chest, and Draco snarls at him. This was a terrible idea, both the argument in the middle of the hall and bringing Weasley along. Draco should have stuck with Granger.
Favorite season: Potter’s is autumn and Draco’s is winter.
Granger is raising her voice at Weasley over something he’s said and having no tact at all, while Potter looks like he wants to be anywhere else but there right now.
“Hyperopia?” Potter suggests evenly.
“Fuck you, Eve.”
“Instead of you?” Draco questions, tone and face relaxed. Potter hesitates, but nods. “Funny, I always thought Thomas was a better choice. Nonetheless, it is a foolish choice to give it to Weasley.”
“Wait!” Leandra suddenly yells, slamming the Geoscript onto the table, then immediately flinching and patting down the book as if she were apologizing to it. “I think I’ve heard of something like this,” she says after she’s assured she didn’t damage the book.
“I cannot see thestrals, but I like to help Luna feed them and watch the meat disappear,” Tracey says, then her eyes turn in the direction of the herd. Her eyes focus on the corpse, but seem to pass straight through the thestrals, unseeing. “I guess we know why they are not in the Forbidden Forest,” she observes, watching as the corpse is ripped apart by, to her, invisible forces.
“Go away Nott. Bulstrode,” Harry snaps, not in the mood to play this game, his hands balled into fists at his side. From the corner of his eye Draco spots Ron and Hermione finally slip out of the classroom and cautiously move towards the commotion. Theodore and Millicent also seem to see the pair and they sneer.
“Yeah, if you were to out stage anyone it would be me,” he says. Harry had told him before his father was a Chaser. It had helped when they practiced alone, Harry familiar with the position more than expected.
“I must say…” Draco continues, making a point of glancing back in Potter’s direction, looking uncertain and suspicious, “I am concerned. There will certainly be people who take into this paranoia. Maybe a search party, something minor, would be advisable to help appease the masses that will not listen to your words?”
They don’t get a moment to finish that statement, because right then they find themselves beside the elevators, a congregation of officials just stepping out, and leaving it barren. They rush to slip in, pulling the gate closed as quietly as they possibly can and setting the elevator for the basement.
“She’s the only one that knows about these meet ups, and she would be familiar with her own Turbo XX, making jinxing it easier, I’d assume,” Draco would admit, he wasn’t so familiar with jinxes or hexes save for the basics, but it made logical sense. He simply needed to start researching this to get a better picture. Until then, though, he only had his theories. “Plus, she’s the only witch or wizard I know of that can use magic without a wand.”
“What about the others?” he demands, strength slowly returning to his voice. Madam Pomfrey’s lips thin a bit, but then she’s stepping away from the bed. Draco wants to demand she come back, but almost immediately new faces are taking her place.
“Leave this to the big kids, alright? We got this!” Fred winks.
But no one outside of Slytherin or the DA really understood just how much things had been changing.
Draco’s grip on his wand tightens and for a moment he is hyperaware of his housemates behind him, waiting for their turn.
“And doesn’t like you.”
He explains the incident quickly, but in detail. Hermione eats it up, eyes wide in clear interest, but also a little panicked. It is clear she sees the danger of what Harry had done, and she’d likely have given him a lecture right there on the spot if not for how dreadful Harry looked trying to hide between Draco and Ginny.
Remarkably words begin to appear on the paper, spreading like ink in water but taking clear forms.
“When I travel back, I’ll hide the Time-Turner behind the jars on Pomfrey’s third shelf beside her desk,” Draco decides, “You can grab it as soon as you return in…” he looks at the sands in the hourglass, “Just about now, actually. You’re running out of time.”
Although, when he thinks about it as he gets up and heads out, somehow knowing that Dumbledore is aware of the DA and hasn’t done anything with that knowledge… somehow that is far more infuriating to Draco than it is reassuring.
“My apologies for causing a scene, Granger,” he says, bowing his head a little, and then they are both turning back towards the castle, walking side-by-side.
He and his parents had made a trip to Diagon Alley and he had wandered off. He does not remember why. It was simply one of those moments in our earliest youth where we act on an impulse we have yet to even feel. A blink and you are somewhere else, with no memory in your mind but a memory in your limbs of the move.
Draco tries to open his mouth and say something else, but Potter has already turned away and is hurrying off, his shoulders up to his ears as he slouches in on himself.
“Oi, just because I’m Asian doesn’t mean I’m some expert on this shit. Fuck you,” she snaps and they back off in apology. “We could probably test it, though. Somebody yell something at them.”
“At the beginni-- were you not watching?!”
He shrinks and shrinks and shrinks until, still proportionately the same, he can fit into Draco’s lap. Both Draco and Weasley fall silent, before erupting with questions over what powers a Lung Dragon might possess. Huang-Jun, amused by their reactions, kindly offers to demonstrate as many of his powers as possible.
“Yeah, well, you don’t have any room to talk about ‘staying in the present,’ Malfoy,” Weasley snaps back as they head for the Department of Mysteries’ Entrance Chamber. Draco keeps his eyes peeled for any Unspeakable that might be wandering about. They’d be lucky not to get caught with how recklessly Weasley was moving.
(warning: flashing lights)
Draco, for the time being, watched from a distance as Harry grew more and more flustered. They would need to head for the locker room soon to get changed, but for now Draco could wait and enjoy the show.
The glamour wavers, then melts away, and Sophie Roper stands there glaring down at Millicent like she’s the scum on her shoe. “You can’t, can you?” Sophie hisses, furious, “Because you know it’s wrong. He was a kid just like the rest of us, and now he’s dead. But HEY! At least Bulstrode doesn’t care. Give a round of applause to Bulstrode, everybody! She’s better than the murder of an innocent boy because it makes her feel better.” Sophie gives two, loud, slow claps, before spitting at Millicent, and, like a lightning storm, stomping away.
“Doing what’s right? How is going against your families right? How is spitting on everything they’ve done for you okay?” Joshua, because apparently that’s his name, fires back and Draco snarls.
Every single word that follows, every single interruption or demand for clarification or pompous tone out of Umbridge’s mouth, has Draco grinding his teeth. He’s carefully silent, focusing on the thestral with the scarred brow that was quickly becoming his only tether to sanity.
A bump to Draco’s shoulder has him glancing over to his left, eyes still wide from the sight of the giant man, and finds Harry smiling in greeting, Ron just behind him. The redhead looks like he’s trying not to laugh.
“I found the slinky your father bought me when we first met,” Draco says one winter when he is ten, sitting in his tub, radio in his lap, slinky in both of his hands.
Umbridge pauses to look down on the fallen boy, then glances over at Ginny. “This will certainly be a Weasley-free school, soon. No respectable witch or wizard will accept you into proper society now,” she pauses to snort, clearly entertained with herself, “Of course, they already shouldn’t have with filthy blood-traitors like yourself.”
“Yeah…” Greg says slowly and Draco looks up. Vincent is staring at his food now, poking at the plate heaped with meat. “Vince lives with me and my grandparents.” Draco doesn’t outwardly respond and, when he simply nods, Greg and Vincent both seem to sag in relief.
And Sirius, the man hovering near Harry, both of them firing spell after spell at Bellatrix and a man beside her. Sirius is grinning, too, laughing like he’s having the time of his life, and Draco thinks Black blood might make people just a little bit crazy…
“What are you doing?”
The secrets were frustrating, but necessary, and hardly bothered Draco like they did Potter. He wasn’t directly affected by them, after all, and it wasn’t his own best friends who were having to keep silent. In addition, Draco had the benefit of a mission to keep him occupied, he didn’t have all summer to just sit around in a trash Muggle neighborhood with nothing to do but think.
Can we just enjoy the music, now?”
“You never told us about any of this!” Granger is suddenly standing, looking insulted and incensed.
“Gryffindors okay?” Eve asks.
“He was acting really weird the moment we started talking about that break-in,” Harry says, looking concerned and suspicious, glancing back towards the hut like Hagrid might be listening in somehow.
trilogy he’d managed to get with Tana’s help – and now he’d handed out his gifts to the Slytherin girls while he’d been in their room.
“Harry and I are dating, now,” Draco announces proudly.
“But I should have done
Draco needed proof. He needed to know whether his suspicions were true or not. Was Moody just some grouchy guy in the wrong place at the wrong time? Or was he a murderer?
“Depends what kind of snake you are,” Harry hums, playing along, and Draco smiles at him.
Millicent’s eyes have stretched to the size of saucers and she’s tensed up as “Cedric Diggory” begins to walk towards her, across the common room, no one saying a word as they watch.
“Yeah, and took Plunkett,” Ron argues right back, waving the card he has in his hand at Harry’s face.
Draco panics, desperately trying to figure out what’s wrong while knowing exactly what it must be. It wasn’t working. It was reacting to the magic in the air and was breaking apart right in Draco’s hands.
Max points a finger straight at Draco, making the blonde scowl at how rude it was, and says, “I don’t think Draco believes in the moon landing…”
“Y’all English folk are crazy, you know that?” Max comments dryly. “Hey! Let’s have a big contest but not tell anybody about what they have to do until later!”
“You sound like royalty. Are you secretly royalty?” Max asks suspiciously.
“Why does everyone keep putting ‘Stayin’ Alive’ in my head!? Why that song? I have no affiliation to it, damn it!” He proceeds to go on a tangent about Muggle music and how he doesn’t even care if he hears any other song, he just assumes they all sound like the Bee Gee’s now and he absolutely hates it.
While they talk, eating as they do, Gemma walks by and claps a hand against both boys’ shoulders, saying how happy she is to see them there, before heading over to sit with some of her friends. A few other Slytherins give them dirty or searching looks, but they are mostly left alone. Even Theodore and Millicent keep away, which Draco considers a victory, and they eat their dinner in peace.
It made Draco snarl and storm off into the bathroom to change into his sleep clothes as well.
“Except… she just said there was nothing inside it,” Draco speaks up because, as sappy as he might get with Harry sometimes, he always did enjoy ruining a moment.
“Hey!” both Eve and Draco say at once, offended, but Granger waves them off.
“Invisibility cloaks are fragile,” Eve says, watching how the air seems to warp around the “invisible” parts of Theodore and Tracey’s bodies. “Expanding it like we did likely strains the magic.”
“A nightmare…” Draco says quietly, brows furrowing in thought. It would surely sound strange to anyone else, to just pack up and leave after a nasty nightmare, but they’d suspected for some time now that Potter had a connection with Voldemort that he experienced through his dreams. It wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibilities if something far bigger happened within those dreams than what it seemed.
They’d awkwardly exchanged names - hers was Eve Hushburn - shaken hands, then sat in silence to read until they reached Hogwarts.
“Sirius,” the man corrects, smirking, then throws an arm around Draco’s shoulders and drags him over. His other arm goes around his godson, who is clearly snickering at Draco’s uncomfortable expression. “Walk with us.”
“You, Potter,” Draco sighs, then reaches into his jeans pockets and pulls out two radios that fit in the palm of his hand. They’re so tiny and dinky compared to Draco’s satellite radio, but they’ll do their job. “Will be in the Atrium. I need you walking around, in disguise, and taking note if anyone familiar might walk through and where they are going. I will give you a list of specific individuals to keep an eye out for, but anyone you may know, as well, should be taken note.”
.oOo.
His radio is in his hands before he knows it and he goes through the usual greetings automatically, voice thick, until he’s speaking to who he needs.
Draco sighs overdramatically, rolling his eyes skyward and leaning back in the tub. “Something like that…” he concedes, even though it is nothing like that. A wand isn’t a toy, it is the ultimate tool for any witch or wizard. Max couldn’t know that, though.
“No! Jeez, you’re a worry wart, did you know that? No, I meant… I really don’t want to sound rude here, I’m just confused.”
“Well I’ll be…” someone says off to Draco’s left and he glances over, wondering what could possibly have caught a wizard’s attention, but then he is staring straight into the eyes of one of the patrons, an elder man in sapphire robes. “You’re… Can’t be… But that hair. And you’re so pale…” He seemed to be talking half to himself but it was drawing other patrons’ attentions. “You’re Draco Malfoy, aren’t you?”
Terry, despite the frightening appearance, is grinning and excited to show Draco and Potter around. “Why not start simple with some T-shirts?  Any bands you like?”
“We will be using spells we already know… and Harry Potter and his lackies will surely be there if this was Granger’s idea,” Draco says, like it’s a secret. “I will admit, I am interested in this new method as well… but while I am attending the lessons, I can just as easily observe and catalogue the spells Potter and all his followers know. Any that stand out… well, I’ll report them all to you.”
Granger makes a sharp, offended noise and Draco rolls his eyes at her. “You hang out with these two. You’re an honorary buffoon, Granger.”
Okay, okay, an actual song. I've been listening to this artist a lot, lately!
“Yeah,” Draco rolls his eyes, “Just trouble in paradise.” The blonde is momentarily distracted as he observes the breakfast options. The tables were covered in food similar in style to the feast from last night, but not as bounteous. Still, Draco piles his plate with eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast with jam. “He’s worried his friend won’t like him anymore because he’s Slytherin now.”
That last one was pretty shocking. Of all the Gryffindor boys of this year, Ronald Weasley seemed the second least qualified to be made prefect, Longbottom being dead last. Most qualified, from Draco’s very logical and unbiased perspective, would probably have been Dean Thomas, who was levelheaded and generally pleasant to be around, so long as he didn’t try to approach Draco, and would hardly have as much on his mind as any of the Golden Trio.
Draco wasn’t a fan of Graham Montague at all. He was like a more sinister Flint, also willing to do anything to win but somehow even
“That is correct,” McGonagall nods, glancing around the street. It was mid-day by now and it was getting more and more crowded by the minute. “We should also get something to eat. It is nearly lunchtime.”
“I’m sure lions could eat snakes if they needed to,” Draco shrugs innocently and Hermione’s glare hardens.
“No, they aren’t,” Draco replies, “The creator of the system, from my understanding, thought ‘Potter’ was too much of a Muggle name and thought Muggle interaction had already ‘tainted’ the family line.”
Potter has gotten a good way ahead of them, the boy much faster than Draco ever would have anticipated, but they do eventually catch up to him.
The silence that settles is suffocating, Draco’s eyes are so wide with terror as he finally looks at Potter, and the other boy is looking back at him with a lost expression, mouth opening and closing uselessly.
“Worrywart,” Potter stage whispers from across the room, and smiles innocently when Draco glares over at him.
Draco and Potter share a smirk, just a small, tired exchange, before Draco ushers them both out into the hall. “Go to your tower, princess,” he says lowly, hand on Potter’s back as he pushes them along. “Tell Granger and Weasley what happened, too. No avoiding them.”
“It, uh, kinda knocked Neville on his arse,” Weasley admits with an attempt at nonchalance.
“I just don’t see why we should be afraid of a name… It’s just that, right? A name,” Potter shrugs, which seems to encourage Eve.
“Harry’s fine,” Draco tries, head tilting as he watches his best friend in partial concern. She seemed a bit too flippant about all this. He hoped she wasn’t upset.
“I was stabbed,” Draco attempts to say but Max is already cutting him off.
“In addition, if Sirius Black were truly such a devoted member of You-Know-Who’s army… where is his dark mark?” Draco turns towards the door and calls, “Cousin Sirius, do you have a dark mark you aren’t telling us about?”
He spends the rest of the evening in the library with Hermione, who is thankfully talking to him again, but his heart isn’t in the research. He’s managed to turn his Wand-Lighting charms all the colors Professor Flitwick listed for him by then, but holding them for very long was less successful. He tries to sort out where he is falling short but can hardly scrounge up the inspiration.
“Don’t you have to head down to the pitch soon?” Draco questions one Thursday afternoon in late May. He and Potter sit in the Astronomy Tower, back to back on the floor, some homework spread out around them, and the radio sitting on the floor beside them.
“Do I have slut energy?” Draco asks the moment he’s passed through the protective wards in the library. The table is already filled by the Golden Trio and Ginny, but Draco pulls up a chair to sit at the end between Harry and Weasley.
“Thestrals?!” Parvati Patil exclaims, standing with Lavender Brown, both of them looking like they’ve suddenly found themselves in a horror story. “Those things are meant to bring all kinds of misfortunes to—”
“Oh! Well, as you must know we share Potions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,” she begins, forced cheer in her voice as she begins to recount her schedule. Tentatively Ron joins in, asking Harry why they have to wait until Friday for that, and Harry tells Ron the same thing he told Draco.
“Oh, not this again,” Weasley groans while Potter cracks a thin smile and chuckles.
“Where did you get a Muggle camera?” Snape demands, but Draco will have none of it, shaking his head.
He’s furious, positively livid, but he makes sure to clap when she is announced as well as when she finishes her dreadful, boring speech. Eve, knowing about Draco’s visits to the Ministry and his attempts to win their favor, joins him with clapping. It would help if his friend appeared to agree with him, after all, and he’s immensely grateful for the action.
And just as many spells as the Inquisitorial Squad threw out, the DA threw them back. No more points could be taken, so most did end up with detention, but the sheer number of them meant other teachers beside Umbridge dealt with their punishments.
He blamed Potter. Everything was easier when he blamed Potter.
“Even Sirius,” Harry continues, both his bare hands finding Draco’s, clearly attempting to warm themselves up. “He’s free, but with all the attention from the Ministry he’s had to be really careful what he goes outside of his home. It’s almost like he’s on house arrest, and he acts like it too.”
Draco paces the Astronomy Tower, his Care of Magical Creatures textbook sitting on the floor a few paces away, a deep rumble emitting from the surely evil thing.
” he questions, still quite breathless and weak-kneed.
And that’s that.
~ ~ ~
Abruptly, Harry pauses to glance at Draco, hesitating, and the blonde doesn’t know what he’s about to say that could warrant such a look. “And… also begin thinking up any memories of when you felt powerful. The happiest and the most powerful memories. Alright, that’s it for today.”
~ ~ ~
The windows around Gryffindor Tower are shut when they fly up and the first two Draco checks are locked tight. The third, to their great luck, opens without a problem and they both immediately tumble in, scrambling to keep from making a ruckus. Harry quickly shuts the window behind them, and they sit heavily on the floor, breathing deeply.
“Yes,” Vivian smirks immediately, “But that’s beside the point. Those are the best questions you can ask yourself when developing something new. Who is the spell for? You or someone else? What is it supposed to do? When and where would it be used? Why are you making it? And, most importantly, how will you develop it?”
“So…” Draco begins slowly after the silence stretches on for too long. “You guys wanna go say hello to Hagrid?”
“No, no way, you can’t go back right now,” Vivian says sharply with a shake of her head. She scrambles, unsteady on her feet, to her bag and begins digging around in it. “She knows you’re out and might be waiting. No, definitely not tonight.”
“It shouldn’t be that color,” Hermione whispers, looking into her cauldron, her hair messily braided back. Pansy looks at her with an unimpressed, half-lidded look.
“Let’s just say… you have been a lot more successful making friends than I have,” Hermione sighs.
As he approaches the trunk he holds the sensor out to it and almost immediately it begins to buzz. Something was concealed here, then, that much was clear.
In the end it could have been worse. They still passed their tests, but just about everything else suffered. All their projects fell apart and their grades dipped. Not to a failing level, but certainly noticeable. In addition, once Max had rested and gathered themself again, they had found complete disinterest to outright hatred for all the research subjects they’d previously been interested in.
“Quick, take this before Papa sees,” Max whispers urgently, holding a familiar-looking device in their hands. They shove it at Draco, who cradles the large thing in his arms, surprised and uncertain what to do.
“Okaasan,” Eve hisses, glaring at her mother, who hushes her sharply, gives her a kiss on the cheek, then ushers her off to the train.
Could Barty Crouch Jr. still be alive?
,” he says firmly, tapping the lock, and he hears a click from within as it unlocks under his magic.
“Do you need me to phone you a cab?” Mr. Nubble asks, glancing out the open front door and seeing no waiting vehicle, but McGonagall is already shaking her head.
“Life’s not fair, Weasley,” Draco shrugs, loving watching the ginger’s face turn red with anger.
He cries. He cries for his cousin, he cries for his friends, he cries for his family, he cries for himself. He cries.
know it, since he was part of the very issue Draco’s father currently faced.
Draco exchanges a confused glance with Granger, whom he’d rejoined, before they hurry towards the crowd to see what’s going on. There is a new Militus there, a shadowy, snorting warthog, and Draco looks to see who cast it.
They were an unstoppable, studying machine! And while they were still stressed, it was clear their study group was relieving some of their worries.
“Three,” Krum holds up three fingers as he says it, “Ve use the first two for most schooling. Third is advanced.”
“You’re a genius though, mother. Were they truly so awful?” Draco had asked at the end of his summer break.
“Here’s the thing, though…” Eve starts, her glare fading and instead looking thoughtful. “We had been expecting something small to assist you in breaking into Moody’s office. This isn’t very small.”
“It’s
“Lupin’s a werewolf?!” he hisses harshly, but Potter shoves him again.
Draco’s boggart was himself.
Fudge was a fool. That much was painfully clear the more Draco sat in the hospital wing watching the proceedings.
“Considering Dumbledore’s favoritism, I wouldn’t be surprised,” Draco rolls his eyes, but shrieks in affronted shock when Potter smacks his arm sharply, looking distinctly unhappy at any kind of ridicule directed at their Headmaster.
“Oh, good, I was getting worried you were growing roots there, for a second,” Potter shoots back and grins as Draco glares. Halfway there Draco realizes Potter still has his arm hostage, but makes no immediate move to free it.
“Deal!” Ron exclaims and Theodore’s smirk only worsens, making Draco glare even harder.
“Excuse you,” he snaps, deciding to glare at Potter since he’s their leader, “but we finally got rid of Crabbe and Goyle. We do not require any more bumbling buffoons.”
“Oh, Draco,” Granger suddenly says, pulling out a sheet of parchment from her bag and setting it down on the table, “You never signed the list for the DA.”
Draco doesn’t respond, but he knows he will be completely on board with whatever will need to be done when the time comes to act.
Draco had looked at the ticket many times since he had gotten it, trying to sort out where such a platform could be, and couldn’t come up with a proper answer. He figured, however, once he got to the station, he would be able to sort it out on his own, confident in his skills of observation.
“A Wiccan?”
“You’re the tallest of all of us and can manage the cloak better because of it. Lucky for us you’re hurt, but not debilitated,” Blaise explains his reasoning and, yet again, Draco can’t think of a decent argument. With so many injured, they need all the advantages they can get.
“It’s exactly what you’re saying! How can you not see that? How can you not look at the world outside of yourself and not realize how selfish you are? I’m fine when you’re a jerk. You’re always a bit of a jerk. But I can’t talk to you when you’re being such a… such a…” Max growls, frustrated, “Such a
For a moment Hagrid attempts to ask about Potions, but it becomes quickly clear Harry doesn’t much want to talk about that, so Draco gives a quick rundown on the lesson itself before urging them on to another subject. For a while they are distracted by talk of flying, everyone eager to start lessons, but Draco has very little frame of reference here and ends up looking around. He spots what looks like a newspaper, but with moving pictures and a wide assortment of fonts that makes his head hurt. On the front, however, is the headline
Draco nods – after the trio had learned of Slytherin’s escape plans they had all worked together to plot out viable options for all the houses – then turns away to the swiftly gathering Ravenclaws. He tries not to look at Chang, knowing it is her best friend who betrayed them, and instead addresses the group as a whole. “You all know the drill. I’ll head ahead. You don’t follow until I say so,” he orders and turns towards the doors.
Again, Harry and Ron keep Draco updated as the tryouts continue. Ron doesn’t know all the names of every student this time, but he can point out some of the returning players. The same thing happens for Ravenclaw when it is their turn next. By this time the Weasley twins have showered and joined them to “Check out the competition.”
Draco remembered that one, probably because it was so much more recent than the others.
They, thankfully, fall back to work after that, argument forgotten. Most of their homework is mostly done and they are instead focusing on extracurricular research. With proper theory and practice now under his belt Draco had begun researching how spells were developed. He specifically wanted to find if there was a general consensus on any aspect of the process; an idea considered the norm that wasn’t questioned, because Draco
“Harry, there you are!” a woman suddenly calls and Lily Potter, Harry’s mother, seems to materialize at her son’s side. Draco wonders if that’s where Harry got his sneaking powers from. “I thought you had gotten everything onto the train already? Did you forget something?”
“Never again,” Draco groans, shutting his eyes and trying to bury his face in the pillow, ignoring Harry’s laughter.
“Even me?” Draco bats his lashes.
“I think it’s a ferret,” says the other person, “Not sure why it’s here in Hogwarts.” Draco looks over, curious who Krum must have been having a conversation with on his walk back to bed, and nearly tumbles off his perch in surprise when he sees Potter.
The woman seems unaware of Draco’s short circuit, however, as she continues in a very commanding voice that would put Mrs Nubble to shame. “My name is Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress at Hogwarts under Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. It has come to our attention the Muggles you live with have questions that need addressing concerning Hogwarts.” The gentle smile returns but Draco is in too much of a shock to properly appreciate it. “I must offer my apologies for not reaching out sooner. It is common for us to offer assistance to muggleborn students, but I am afraid your situation is quite unique.”
“I’ve never been on this side of one of those before,” Longbottom mumbles and Draco raises his sleeve to scrub furiously at his face.
“Oh gross! Why’s this here? This is supposed to be a war museum, jeez!” the kid has their tongue sticking out, brown hair a mess, and is eying the picture like it’s hippogriff dung.
“Yes,” Eve says without missing a beat, plopping down on Draco’s bed, stretching her legs out comfortably.
Professor Lupin had been fired. Rumors had spread of his true nature, most certainly stemming from Draco’s own godfather, which meant this would be the last chance Draco had to speak to the man.
“Back off!” Harry yells, hurrying back in the direction they’d just come from, wanting to help his godfather no matter what. He ignores the cries from both his friends and the Order to stop, that he should just run, but they’re too far to stop him.
“I had to sit in with Umbridge and listen to her talk bad about centaurs today. I had to get away,” he continues. The thestral that had sniffed him is stepping a big closer, its heavy breaths ruffling Draco’s hair.
“IM?” Potter repeats, arching a brow and clearly attempting not to laugh as he hands back the camera. Draco narrows his eyes and snatches the camera out of his outstretched hand.
“Ron and Hermione think you’re the Heir of Slytherin,” Potter, thankfully, cuts to the chase. It eases some of Draco’s nerves, but the subject being presented ramp them right back up again.
“How is this not a big deal? That map was a marvel, an asset, a boon, and you just…
“George and Fred got mad and pushed Graham into a cabinet or wardrobe,” Tracey had said, face and voice blank despite the hustle her little body was putting out. “I do not know what it did, but it really hurt him.”
It had been weeks since Umbridge had broken up the DA and, as expected, things just kept getting worse and worse. The rules were out of control, no one could do anything, the other teachers were furious, and if Draco had thought the Inquisitorial Squad’s initial power trip had been bad, this one reached new levels of absurdity.
“It was a boost of morale to all of humankind,” Max’s father says gently, then points to the model of “Apollo 11,” which seemed like an ironic name since it was apparently supposed to go to the moon, not the sun. “Humans used centuries of knowledge and pride to build this, not just Americans. Up in space there are no nations, only the vast openness of the cosmos.”
Sagging slightly he steps back, hands falling uselessly to his sides as he stares out into the water. Had that really happened? Had he really managed to communicate with one of the merpeople? Despite the emptiness still in his chest from the nightmare, Draco begins to feel elated. Except… will it happen again? He’d hardly count that as a proper conversation. He’d very much like to speak with Augi many, many more times. Or any merperson.
“They’re very sweet,” Hermione allows, shoulders sagging, “But we don’t interact like everyone else. We’ve studied together, and I’ve helped with some of their work when they struggle--”
“Have a good summer, Mr. Malfoy,” Lupin laughs and then he is disappearing down the hallway, never to return to Hogwarts as the best Defense Against the Dark Arts professor it has ever seen.
Except it seemed he just wasn’t going to get very lucky today because Theodore begins to smirk, vicious and cruel, and takes a single step forward to a lower stand. “I will. What do I have to worry about? You’ll only just end up running away in the end and I can go back to bed.”
“I’m not avoiding anything,” Harry says, looking away and scowling.
She was altogether a mystery in Draco’s book, but hardly seemed threatening based on everything he’d heard.
Draco is waiting in the Room of Requirement after he is finished making his rounds at Hogsmeade. He’d spotted Harry and Weasley laughing excitedly with Sirius, clearly surprised to see the man but happy nonetheless. He’d gone to the Three Broomsticks and had a butterbeer with his friends. He’d dropped by Honeydukes and grabbed a couple sugar quills.
~ ~ ~
“Everyone is keeping secrets this year,” Potter spits, suddenly vicious, but Draco suspects it isn’t directed at him this time.
