As the trio walked to take one of the few tables left available, Harry took in as much as he could. There was a line at the front, where a glass case filled to the brim with all sorts of cakes and cookies were, then the movement through the opening into the kitchen caught his eye, then there were the waiters who seemed to actually enjoy themselves here. There was something about this place that spoke to him.
And just like that, Harry’s body collapses. All the tension, all the tight muscles, the stress and strain, just left. His body slumped into the chair, and he hung his head in shame.
He started to laugh maniacally, feeling himself edge towards insanity. The first picture frame he came across in his own house had reduced him into a right mess. He just keeps underestimating just how much he’s lost.
“-don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m drowning. I’m worried sick. I’m trying to hide it so he doesn’t worry. There’s already enough on his plate, but I’m so worn out. I don’t know what to do. What if he doesn’t like me anymore? What if he remembers but realises he doesn’t love me anymore?”
“The pancakes will be ready soon, just…” Malfoy waved his hand, like he was shooing Harry away. “Do something.”
The knowledge that Harry Potter had lost his memory was still kept under wraps, known only by Tina, Ron, Hermione, and presumably Malfoy. ‘The Boy Who Lived Once Again: Immortal?’ was one of the worst articles he’d ever read.
The most interesting part was that each witness, every connection that Lia had with any other person seemed to describe different people. Her best friend seemed to suggest that the disappearance was planned, while another said she was kidnapped.
In frustration and a pang of jealousy, he turned fast. Which, of course, resulted in him crashing into another person. The room’s floor was covered in newspapers. Once he got his bearings, he helped the person pick them up.
Once Isolt gathers her balance, and the beats of her wings aren’t booming in his ears, Malfoy’s laughter rings through. Harry just stares at him.
Hace looked up, and stared at him like he was a stranger. It made Harry want to vomit, but he continued to approach them. Harry bowed his head, as low as he could, and hoped that Hace would accept him, the him now.
It was carelessly thrown glasses on the desk as he looked up at the ceiling, wondering why he had to go through this too,
Once seated in his office, the window opened to let the air in, he started reading. The diaries were marked with dates of interviews, meetings, and speeches like he expected. But as he flipped through, those started to occur less and less. In their place were things like ‘Meet up with Neville about plant,’ and ‘Grab Draco’s suit.’
Harry nodded, feeling confused and a sinking of his heart. Why was it that when he thinks about going back to the field, part of his body fights it? Has he become scared of the work now?
“Yeah, I have. Everyone’s being so nice.” Harry wasn’t lying, they really were. The problem was him. “I’ve been seeing Hermione and Ron, and yesterday I went to Hogwarts.”
It’s been about a week since the celebration at the Burrow. Despite feeling a lot better, he knew he wouldn’t be a good guest. So when he heard Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love and Ron’s absolute outcry, he knew Malfoy was finally within reach. Harry kept to his promise with Malfoy and sought him out after hugging Teddy in the kitchen.
That’s gone now, though. Harry lost hope every passing second. Nothing had come yet, no memories of passing smiles or bouts of laughter. No beach parties or wedding celebrations. Nothing.
When he walked into the store again, Pansy and Blaise were there behind the counter while Malfoy was talking to another customer about the prices of calming draught compared to sleeping draught.
Throughout their visit, Harry wondered if Malfoy was going to come in at some point, but as time went on, he never reappeared. Harry wondered aloud why Malfoy was in the room, a few hours later. He noted the grim faces on Ron and Hermione’s faces as they tried to change the subject.
How is it that I, somehow your boyfriend, lost memories of our entire relationship and you can just carry on like normal? I fall through the floo, and you’re treating me like nothing’s happened.” Harry’s voice was trembling, a mix of anger hiding the sadness.
Neville’s smile never left his face. “Thank you. It’s old news, about 2 years, but I’ll never get sick of telling people. I’m glad I got to tell you again.”
Harry tried not to be shocked at his own words. The voice that came out of him couldn’t have been his. There was concern woven into the words, but a stray piece of affection had found its way too. The affection was so noticeable on his ears, and Harry didn’t think it should’ve been there at all.
Minerva stopped walking at the top of a hill. The wind was blowing, giving kisses of cold air onto their heated foreheads. Harry stopped beside her, and took in the sight.
Malfoy laughed softly at Harry, shaking his head. He continued walking. “You can be so daft sometimes.”
The office was incredible. This is the one place, the first place, that really felt like him. Even if it wasn’t the same Harry that left this room, the Harry now that entered it felt right at home.
Harry smiled, and quickly wrote back a reply saying that it was okay. Just as he tied the letter back on the owl’s leg, Malfoy came back with an owl treat. The owl took it gratefully, and continued resting for a short while next to Isolt in her cage.
His shout echoed and slightly shifted through the wards. Harry waited, halfway out a window on the second floor. There were no flaps of wings or hoots he could hear yet. He tried again.
Truthfully, Harry had a feeling it was about that. Deep down somewhere in his heart he knew the answer, even if his mind had no idea. Maybe that’s why it didn’t feel like a revelation.
Nott’s words were starting to slow the tiniest bit. Of course, enough firewhiskey and they’d be knocked out drunk. To be honest, Nott and Neville were holding themselves incredibly well with how many firewhiskeys they’ve had.
It wasn’t a lie, Harry decided. But he wasn’t ready to come to that truth yet, not like this, not while he’s still like this. He isn’t the Harry Malfoy loves yet, he can’t do this. At least, not yet.
She must’ve been new because he has never seen her before in St Mungo’s. Merlin knows how many times he’s been here since the auror job.
“Well, sometimes I postpone meetings to spend time with him.” Hermione smiled. “It was hard at first. I have a lot of things to do, from meetings to interviews, from speeches to discussions with other wizarding ministries. But we make time, and it’s always worth it.”
“Not another word out of your mouth about that,” Molly adamanted. “Out of all the things to talk about, it had to be that moment.” She shook her head and starting walking back to the kitchen.
Harry didn’t remember thinking about it at all actually. Things were still way too new, and he was still getting used to this Malfoy as his friend as opposed to the Malfoy from Hogwarts that was his rival.
Once Ginny finished laughing, she went straight back to it. “Oh man, but you’d think that was it, right? Ron got the easy part, he just had to lip sing.”
He went back downstairs, and unpacked the new picture frames he bought. There weren’t many, but 5 seemed to be a good amount. They all ranged from small photo sizes to large ones. A small part of Harry wanted to frame new memories, ones that had him now in it.
Harry’s quill was scribbling all over his notes. Letters upon letters of the people he reached out to for a chat about Lia had to be postponed or cancelled because they were all out of the country.
So Harry wanted a while, hidden. It wasn’t until it was his usual lunch break that he walked into the store, the familiar bell ringing.
“If I could be the other Harry, if I could relive his life then maybe…” Harry was struggling so much.
Harry turned to look at Goyle, whose hands were in his pockets and seemed to shift his weight from one foot to the other. He was probably as uncomfortable as Harry felt, but he stuck his hand out for Goyle to shake, and put on a welcoming smile.
Teddy was running around, snitch plushie in hand, like nothing meant more than that toy and his speed. Harry wanted to hug him tightly, let him know he missed him and that things would be okay as soon as he remembered. But Harry didn’t want to bring that smile away from his face, so with a will stronger than he thought he had, he continued to look around.
Harry let that sink in. A lot of the time in his Hogwarts days, he’d admired Ravenclaws and their easy intelligence. But after getting to know more about them through Cho and Luna, he knew that stereotype had no evidence. The house of Ravenclaw was not just easy intelligence or naturally gifted individuals, they were more than that.
Whoever the guests were, hopefully they didn’t mind Harry just casually on the floor with bloody trousers and blood dripping from his mouth.
After Malfoy took a plateful, Harry got his food as well. When he ate one bite, he hummed happily. It was nice, and let Malfoy know it.
A few hours later, both of them were pleasantly surprised when Harry discovered he didn’t actually mind it anymore.
It was probably midnight, or even early morning, so Harry tiptoed quietly out of the floo. Malfoy would definitely already be upstairs sleeping, exhausted by the work day despite his day off tomorrow. Despite this, Harry was definitely surprised by what he saw.
He bought whatever he could, wanting to buy some for Pansy and Blaise too while they talked in the backroom. He decided to cringe over the price later. After all, he needed this right now. It was well deserved, if he says so himself.
“Because,” Ron’s voice cracked. “Because it was my fault. If I had just gotten there quicker, if I had just told him to wait, then…”
Neville watched as Harry called out his house and threw the powder to the ground. Dark green flames swirled over Harry’s vision until it became one he was more familiar with.
He stepped back, away from Kingsley’s desk and simply asked with betrayal laced in one syllable, “Why?”
“Fighting is all I know, it’s what I’m good at.” Harry countered. “I want to be able to use my experiences for good.”
Malfoy gestured for Harry to eat. Harry picked up one of the disposable bowls and a plastic spork and started grabbing a bit of each food. The smell of each dish was amazing alone, but together it was intoxicating.
“Yeah, he told me about it. That’s why Malfoy’s been a lot more run down whenever he gets home these days.” Harry replied, distance and coldness in his voice.
They stopped in front of a desk near the back, out of the eyes of many people. Harry was going to mention just how far from the door it was, but when he looked back, the door looked like it hadn’t moved at all.
“Sorry,” His voice was hoarse. Clearing his throat, he tried again. “Sorry, I was distracted.” Slightly better. “What were you asking?” He turned to face the healer.
This conversation was odd. They weren’t looking at each, but their hearts were slowly making themselves known.
Harry didn’t know how to proceed. There were too many unknowns in how things are in this world he woke up to. Kingsley and Malfoy were on good terms, maybe even good friends. He realised, as if his mind couldn’t help but betray him, that not only has he lost memories of his own friendships, but also the friendship of his friends.
The way he said it, the way friend’s tease each other, joke around, playing fun. It was weird for Harry. There was no bridge between the last time Harry saw Malfoy in 8th year to now. It was too sudden. He swallowed the uncomfortable lump in his throat.
Malfoy nodded a response, still smiling. It wasn’t just tikka masala though, it seemed to be different cuisine takeouts, from the tikka masala to honey chicken to pork in a lovely sweet sauce.
“Of course!” Harry quickly jumped at making amends. “I just meant, it was a work incident, case files, the whole thingy, y’know?”
It was coming from the living room. Intrigued, he moved to the living room, trying to flatten his shirt in case some guests had arrived. But when he got there, Malfoy was just putting takeout on the table and sitting on one of the chairs surrounding it.
Quick footsteps, border on running, resounded out the door until Malfoy appeared. Harry looked at him and then rubbed his face in exasperation. Malfoy looked normal, casual with a touch of not trying too hard. It was slightly infuriating.
Maybe it wasn’t such a surprise after all. That scared him the most. That felt the most real, like somehow that just merged the old Harry and the new.
Harry finally looked up, amazed at the obvious friendly teasing in Malfoy’s tone. Harry commanded his eyes to focus on the man in front of him. His friend. His apparent partner.
When he finished, it was silent. Malfoy hadn’t said a word, nor had he moved. Harry started picking at the carpet underneath him, leaning against the couch. He didn’t look at Malfoy at all.
The 3 days passed like everything else. Only difference was the way his mind wandered to Malfoy a lot more than usual, and how his sleep no longer consisted of hands to hold. But it wasn’t like he needed it anymore. The pain has gotten a lot better.
“It’s almost time for our lunch break,” Lavender told him. She got up and transfigured the seat back into an inkwell. “Come on, let’s go.”
A wave of students entered, walking past him in bouts of laughter that reminded him of his friendship group in their Hogwarts years. Nostalgia settled in his chest as he shook himself out of the trance.
They continued on like that, talking about Draco Malfoy slowly turning into talking about things they missed at the celebration in the Burrow.
“The sand was the worst part, somehow it never left.” Andromeda sighed at the memory. “No matter how many cleaning charms I used, or muggle washings, the sand just never disappeared.”
Neville and Goyle looked at Nott sitting between them, tongue slightly poking out as he continued to write quickly, as if the words were on a time limit. Harry felt like he was intruding, feeling the love and affection the three of them had for each other, so deep and true.
There were 3 days left until Harry would be able to leave. The bed has become suffocating, the white walls seemed to chip away at his sanity, and the people coming in and out of that door were all the same. The only ones he was able to distinguish were the 3 he ever talked to properly.
Harry got up, unsure about leaving the papers on the floor but trusting Malfoy’s decision. “But I’m a mess right now, give me a few minutes.”
Harry twisted his head to face the person behind him. Lavender looked at him with a mixture of concern and pity. He hated it.
Thankfully, he had all the time in the world. Kingsley was very understanding, giving Harry time off to heal from his ‘extensive injuries,’ as Tina had told him. Harry wondered if Kingsley knew of his absent memories, knowing Ron’s files would recount it all, but if Kingsley knew, he didn’t let on.
They got their food and Malfoy paid, with muggle money no less, and a complete understanding of its workings. He even went as far as participating in small talk with the cashier before they started walking back home.
“Harry!” Pansy roared. Harry’s head snapped back to Pansy. Her composure was neat and calm, like that shout couldn’t have possibly come from her. “What you’re doing,” Her voice was like a whisper. “It’s stupid, and insulting.”
Teddy was still holding the golden snitch plushie from before. Andromeda was cooking away in the kitchen, singing the Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love with obvious disdain.
It might have been harsher than he intended, but he made no move to apologise. He well and truly did not enjoy it here at all. ‘New perspective,’ Kingsley said. How on earth was he gonna find that if everything had already been fucking perspectived. He hated it here.
A few minutes, one steaming cup of earl grey tea, and a soothed mind later, he walked over to the boxes of picture frames. Fear and anticipation filled his entire body. There would be a lot to go through in there, a lot to handle, and Harry knew it would be too much.
He put down the journal he was reading, doggy tagging where he was up to, and walked to the open window. The sky was dark and the twinkling of stars greeted him. Harry looked around, trying to find Isolt somewhere in the air, but it was too dark.
Harry closed his eyes and begged his heart to stop aching. His heart was crying, he could feel it, and his mind had stopped moving completely. Something was wrong, the words he was saying felt like cotton stuffed into his mouth. It felt like soap bubbles filling up his throat.
No, they would make Harry truly regret it. They’d find a way, and Harry knew this threat was up with the very few threats that ever meant anything to him.
“Besides,” Hermione had said just before the two left. “If we were there, you might hide behind us. How can people have a serious talk when one hides?”
Harry was dragged across what felt like the entire department floor, but one he’d never seen before. There were rooms for almost anything you could think of when it came to investigation.
“Of course.” Malfoy, swift and elegant, moved away from the tense situation without having said a single word to either of the three. If Harry could strangle him, he would.
Harry thought of all the spells used against a person. All the protective charms and shields he could create. He almost told her that he could handle it, until his mind told him otherwise. Pansy and Blaise, they don’t work like that.
He’d never seen Malfoy laugh like this, ever, not even in school. This was new, and sudden, and very intimate, and for a serious second Harry wanted to know more. Harry needed to calm down, his heart had skipped several beats, and the air in his lungs felt much thinner than before.
Harry knows he’s closing himself off from everyone. Talking to Ron and Hermione with quick sharp responses and too many one-word answers. But he’s jealous, and he can’t help it.
Even the pretending with Pansy and Blaise had become almost numbing. There was no more satisfaction, and if there was, it was fleeting. It felt like it was too easy.
“Their magic is weird, don’t you think? The way the muggles think magic works.” Teddy said as he laid down on the couch, arms behind his head.
Harry looked over at Blaise still standing in front of the door. He looked like a security guard, ready to deny access to anyone wanting to enter, or in this case, anyone wanting to leave.
Malfoy stayed on the kitchen floor on all fours. He was shaking now, trembling. Harry coughed up a bit of blood. Wiping his hands on his trousers, he tried to calm down his breathing.
The students cheered. A Gryffindor from the back spoke up in a voice that reminded Harry of Ludo Bagman. “Who’ll win next time on Longbottom versus Potter!”
good. It was perfect, and brilliant, and everything was looking up. He was great. And now…” Harry trailed off, wiping his cheeks.
Harry nodded and let himself think. On one hand, he knew it wasn’t his fault for not knowing. On the other hand, he felt like a right git never asking about Malfoy’s life, too busy groaning over his own.
Harry helped Hagrid take care of the rest of the animals that accepted their help, and they talked briefly about new things. As they talked, he learnt that Hagrid had started teaching Care of Magical Creatures alongside Professor Grubbly-Plank, who co-taught the subject as Hagrid’s roles in the school became too much. With being gamekeeper, professor, and caretaker of the new endangered animals field, it was no question.
Harry gulped and finally looked at Malfoy and was surprised by his reaction. It was a soft sad smile, and tears were brimming at his eyes.
Just as he returned back in the kitchen, Malfoy whispered with a smile on his face, “I still know you.”
Harry flopped on his chair and put his head on the table. He sighed deeply and closed his eyes, trying to understand this whole new thing. He groaned in anguish.
He talked about how he needed to do something. How through this, at least he was moving. At least he was doing something productive. Forcing the memories was better than just waiting.
Harry was silent. His anger was bubbling. He didn’t know if he was angry at Malfoy for making sense, or himself for wanting to ignore it. “No, I didn’t know.” He finally said through gritted teeth.
“Actually, don’t tell me. It’ll just make me more angry at you.” Her voice started to decrease in volume and power. Harry took a breather while bracing himself for the next wave. “None of your memories have actually come back, have they?”
“Is there a particular reason you’re trying so hard in potions when your other classes are doing so well?” Harry asked carefully.
She nodded in reply as she looked over them with pride. “I do,” She said. “In fact, I’m head of the Investigatives.”
Looking around, he realised a lot of the people he was most anxious to meet weren’t there. Theodore Nott and Gregory Goyle were nowhere to be found. Pansy Parkinson was talking to a very intrigued Hermione. Harry heard from Arthur that Blaise Zabini would be coming late due to some happenings at work. Neville Longbottom was there, talking to Ron about Hogwarts.
“There’s a picture frame on my desk,” He said slowly, avoiding Malfoy’s eyes. “It’s got everyone in it, you, Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna, Ginny, even some of the other Slytherins from school.”
But it worked out, Charlie had sorted it all out, and Hagrid had an international portkey ready for Romania as soon as the Christmas holidays began. He was ecstatic, and Harry was extremely happy for him.
In Harry’s blurry vision, he watched as the man’s head shot up. The slightly fuzzy light blond hair and slim figure seemed very familiar to him. Harry tried not to scream when he realised it was Draco Malfoy. Out of everyone to be by his bedside, he didn’t quite expect him.
Harry gathered Malfoy was trying to keep himself together. But when tears started falling onto the table, just behind the unfinished plate of food, Harry stopped breathing all together.
Harry closed the door behind him, and walked out of those Ministry doors in no better state than when he entered.
Hermione and Ron stayed in silence. Even when Malfoy came through, giving everyone their respective teas, no words of thanks were given.
It couldn’t have lasted longer than half a second, and it didn’t take Harry any longer to have his foot through the floo.
Harry sipped the water slowly, trying out his voice in between. The silence from his mouth turned into a whisper, and that turned into a croak, which turned into his voice with a considerably large amount of cracks. He wondered how long he was out for if his throat was that bad.
Harry looked at Minerva, who had gone back into a conversation with Flitwick and Slughorn, and marvelled at her. The house unity she tried so hard to achieve had not only come to reality, but it was even beyond what he thought was possible.
When he looked into the spare bedroom to find it empty, his heart fell. Harry peeked into his bedroom, and came up with nothing there either. Malfoy's office was shut tight, with Isolt and Malfoy inside. Harry didn’t need a big ‘No Entry’ sign to know he wasn’t welcome.
“You’re right.” The girl spoke with such fever and determination it cut through his thoughts yet again. “Thank you, Mr Potter.”
Her job was fashion designer. Her eye for the next trend, for things that could be altered slightly into a completely new thing, was impeccable. Harry discovered that once Pansy started talking about her job, the conversation would last significantly longer.
Before Harry could realise something had gone terribly wrong, Malfoy had grabbed his plate and left, disappearing upstairs. Even Isolt seemed to give him a stink eye as he stayed loyally on Malfoy’s shoulder.
The waitress, Lara, laughed wistfully. “Yeah, it really blew up. Despite it being busier, I’m enjoying it a lot more.”
Malfoy pointed to the shelves behind them with his thumb. “All those books on the shelves are mine, but it wasn’t always like that. You had your own books there too. Believe me, I was surprised when I found out you actually read but you filled up a lot of space.”
Harry discovered that Blaise Zabini worked in modelling and photography. He had started out as a model for wizarding fashion lines until he branched out into muggle territory. No matter what he did or how he posed, people ate it up like they hadn’t eaten in days.
Harry didn’t think about that. From what he could remember from working in the aurors, he never gave a thought as to where the evidence goes. Whether it be a body part of a pillowcase, all of it ended up in something like that until the case was closed.
Harry continued to eat his dinner without conversation with anyone. He must’ve given off the vibe that he didn’t want to be spoken to, because Neville didn’t talk to him again after the school was dismissed and the food disappeared.
So he spent a while looking at the shelves. Thoughts and ideas of how to rearrange them came and went. There was a certain order that he couldn’t make out, but he felt like he knew it deep down. He trusted his body and its memory. Understood when a book looked right, and took it back when it didn’t.
“Oh,” Harry said. He scratched the back of his neck. “Well, I noticed you always ask that whenever someone apologises to you, even if the reason might be a little obvious.”
It had to be true. Because how could he love the person in front of him? The man from his childhood? The man who took so many good memories from his grasp? It just had to be true. So why did his body scream out ‘LIAR!’ His heart yearned to be closer, to take the words back from the air before they reached Malfoy’s ears.
Ron cast a patronus, and told it to find healer Tina and to come to Autumn Avenue quickly. The russell-terrier bounded through the air and through the window, startling a very quiet and watchful Isolt.
“And once that dessert table was open, Ron practically sprinted to it.” Ginny kept talking, not responding to anyone, but she did give them time to respond.
Harry begrudgingly complied. He moved with the energy of a snail, the livelihood of a cucumber. Lavender had to drag him by the hand towards the elevator.
“You better win the next time you’re in the duelling club, I have 2 galleons on you,” The student who spoke up said.
With haste, Harry walked over to Neville. Neville was one of the many who had changed a lot throughout the past 5 years. He wanted to know his development too.
He hadn’t expected Goyle, out of all of them, to ask. But Neville and Nott were talking about leaves used as notepaper. Goyle looked at Harry with concern, but quickly tried to hide it with a sip of his mead.
“He loves his work.” Neville’s voice had admiration laced into every letter, each syllable was dripping with amazement.
Malfoy was the first to move. Like the world decided to put them out of their misery and press the play button. He turned around, back facing Harry.
Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes underneath his glasses. Lavender was right, he needed a break from all of this. He didn’t get any of it, why he was here, what he was meant to figure out. It was eating away at his soul.
Harry said goodbye to Tatus, telling him he’d see them again. As he walked away, Harry looked back and watched as Tatus moved over to the group of hippogriffs near the water, and stayed next to Hace.
Harry wanted to hold his breath and stop time so he could think. So that he could have a proper reply to the way Malfoy was looking at him. Despite the sunken eyes, messy hair, and exhausted body, he looked at Harry like he was everything. There was too much love in it. Too much affection. It was too much.
Hermione sat on the seat beside his bed as Ron threw up a Muffliato. Harry’s eyebrow raised, but he didn’t ask any questions. The couple gave each other an encouraging nod before turning back to Harry.
Ron nodded. “Yeah, and sometimes lookouts take days until we get the information we need. There’s no consistency and it’s hard to plan, but I send my patronus to her, telling her I love her and all. Other times, when I get home we plan an instant date.”
Silence took over the room again. Malfoy didn’t seem to have eaten even half of his plate yet. Despite that, he looked much for sure of himself than Harry could muster right now.
Teddy nodded, then tilted his head. "You forgot the past 5 years and now you’re trying to get it back. That’s what Andromeda told me.”
None seemed to jump out for his attention as he walked towards the hippogriffs. His eyes landed on one that seemed to have a glint in its eyes. The hippogriff’s feathers were dark grey, slowly blending and changing into pure white as it moved up from the wings to the head.
“The vials are the same throughout all the rooms, but each needs a case ID and assigned member ID to access. So many memories, so many important details of a case waiting to be found.”
Soon enough, Malfoy swept through with a stack of pancakes. The ones on the top looked glorious, but the ones at the bottom looked ridiculous. He told Malfoy this, hoping to release whatever tension was still there.
“So that you wouldn’t worry. Didn’t matter. They didn’t tell you about me ‘til a few days ago, remember?” Malfoy’s hands were fidgeting, rolling his wand back and forth across the table. He was still incredibly calm despite the sharpness in his words.
He took out his wand and tried a few cleaning charms. The ink was stubborn and unrelenting, but he managed to clean it decently.
“Don’t do that, Harry. Don’t lie. You don’t need to, and you don’t have to.” Pansy finished, the final wave reeling back into the ocean.
Malfoy’s days off were not on a preplanned day, instead it was chosen in line with his levels of stress. “I can’t afford a day off in the week,” He told Harry one day. “So I’ll choose the day myself, for when I really need it.”
Harry recounted everything he could without giving too much away. He spoke of the Burrow to seeing Teddy, from going to the muggle restaurant with his friends to seeing everyone at Hogwarts. There were no lies, but he avoided talking about the crying.
Harry’s eyes searched Malfoy as he was waking up. His light blonde hair was ruffled on the side he slept on, poking all sorts of directions. His face was sunken in, and there dark eyebags. But what caught his attention was his clothes.
Harry closed his eyes to think. It was just blurry colours and noise, layers of shouts and then blackness. Before that was lunch with Ron and Hermione to celebrate Hermione being Minister for Magic so quickly. He told healer Tina about it.
He kept his eye contact, and bowed as low as he could. Trying his hardest to remember how it was all that time ago in his own third year Care of Magical Creatures class. But when the majestic creature bowed its head down to Harry, he couldn’t help but celebrate in his mind.
Sometimes, things will get worse before they get better. Harry knows this. He's lived it and lost it.
“Harry, don’ worry about it, okay?” Hagrid looked at the castle. “I gotta go and meet Grubbly-Plank abou’ the class today. I’ll see ye ‘round.”
“Mate, you got there before, you can do it again. Besides, does it look like you’re gonna do this alone?” Ron gestured to the room.
Anger started flowing through his veins. The frustration weaved through every nerve ending like a pinball machine. Every single thought was painted red. His fists clenched so tightly he didn’t realise the nails digging into his palm. The unfairness of it all hit him square in the chest.
He stood there, wand still pointed at Malfoy. The feeling of his mind falling to pieces, his thoughts all messed up and plans in ruins, he breathed it in. Then let it go.
Harry gave them to her. He didn’t have the heart to just leave her, so he asked, “Are you okay, by the way?”
“Yeah, right. He did all these amazing things at Hogwarts, was still in the aurors, and had all these great friendships.”
Even now in sleep, pj’s messy, and hair poking out like Harry’s, he was just as beautiful as he was when he got ready for a day outside. Even now with a blank sleepy face, all Harry could see was the way he smiled and laughed, the way he did with his entire being, walls down but carefree and content.
Harry thought to himself. And just this once, he let himself bask in that thought as he fell through the floo through to Scotland.
Just before sleep could take over, Harry’s eyes shot open. His hands covered his mouth, and his mind felt like there was an intense alarm wee-wooing in his head.
The handwriting, thankfully, was familiar. It was Neville’s handwriting. But how on earth Neville had gotten an eagle owl was beyond him.
They continued walking, and Hagrid’s hut stepped into view. Harry’s heart ached. He hasn’t seen Hagrid in ages. The man who had cared so much for him, brought him to the Dursley’s in hopes that they’d meet again, who had made a cake and wished Harry a happy 11th birthday before even telling him why he was there. Harry knew he had to see him today.
“Harry, please come to my office. We must discuss your work as an auror.” The lynx disappeared into the air, taking Kingsley Shacklebolt’s voice with it.
Still, he followed on, trying to quell the hint of uncertainty and frustration bubbling slowly in his chest.
It was genuine, Harry knew. The support was such a reflection of everyone else he’s met. All his friends and family, even the waitress Lara who didn’t know any of it, were so supportive.
Harry pulled at his hair, then repeatedly took off and on his glasses. Like somehow the movement would do something different. Like maybe if he tried hard enough, he’d remember something. Something new. Something of unknown Harry.
The notes were filled with drawings of potions ingredients, even cauldrons themselves. Labels pointing to specific structures, lines of notes and warnings all around each paragraph. It was so much like the notes Malfoy had across his own books.
You can’t look at a case for too long or it becomes mush. Anyway, I do have a life outside of work, don’t you?”
A person zoomed by in his peripherals, and with a pounding heart, he realised it was Teddy. Blue haired tiny kid with a snitch plushie in his hand. Andromeda was there too, and she smiled softly at Harry and waved. Harry kinda maybe wanted to cry.
Pretty much everyone groaned at that. Harry was pretty sure he heard Ron say, “And that’s why I wanted whiskey.”
He really needed a break from that desk, from that case, from his work. He was neck deep in 3 cases, 2 murders and the one and only Lia Adwin missing file. None of which had any new details in the past few years.
He could imagine Hedwig looking down, perched on the shoulder of ones of his passed mates. Maybe even his mum or dad. Despite the forest where she’d have a multitude of friends, Hedwig would still go to one of his friends or family, and just watch as Harry moved along life.
Harry heard voices from the living room, and then the swooshes of the floo. Suddenly remembering the food, he cast a wandless stasis charm on it.
Harry smiled, and his heart felt like it was going to burst. Harry didn’t know what it felt like to have a mother, but he had a feeling that Minerva was the closest he would have. Afterall, she had given so much of herself to ensuring Harry grew up to become a great person.
Malfoy looked at Harry, and smiled at him. He even gave a small wave just before another customer dragged him to the cauldrons. Harry didn’t know he was smiling until his cheeks hurt.
The four tables, one for each house, were no longer that. A mix of greens and yellows, blues and reds had taken over. What had been Gryffindor's table was now filled with a variety of colours, the same was with all the other tables. Yet, the laughter and conversations held no distance.
He didn’t realise it was late until Isolt landed on top of the other case folders on his desk. Isolt had to peck and prod at Harry until he finally tore his eyes away from the papers.
“The first pancake is always the worst one, didn’t you know?” Malfoy said, putting a pancake on his plate.
Neville looked at him with an immense amount of pity that Harry wanted to scream into an abyss. “Don’t. Don’t do whatever it is you’re doing. It’ll only make things worse, and you know it.”
Kiana thanked Harry numerously, but genuinely. And he told her he’d see her one day as a great potioneer. They parted ways when they reached the castle, Harry walking to the Great Hall for dinner, and Kiana dropping by her house dormitory.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. The office made sense, but did he really have uncontrollable magic back then? The him from before that was so perfect?
His hands started to shake as he picked it up. It felt like he was holding the world in his hands. The picture restarted, but the feeling of pure happiness never left each of their faces.
“Your office was a mess when you got back. Everything was thrown all over the place. Every night, without fail, I could hear you getting angry and throwing your papers around. Sometimes, you’d get so stressed that you’d have bouts of uncontrollable magic. That’s why the wards on the house are mine. We changed them a few months ago.”
Harry fought to go right back to the store and buy some other food that he’d cook. Hell, he’d even take two minute cup noodles. But Malfoy just laughed and reminded Harry he didn’t have money.
When Andromeda started on her chores, leaving Harry to watch over Teddy, he couldn’t help but celebrate for a moment. He’d done it, he’d pretended again and it was completely successful. He could have that life back, the one that still seems so out of reach for who he is now. He could take it back, even if it isn’t real, he could pretend it was. At least for a second.
It was too much. There was too much here. Why did Harry think it was a good idea to come here knowing how much there was? How many memories did he forget? How could they possibly talk things over when it held so much emotion?
There were designated areas that held a constant sanitary charm on them. Each one held specific contents of evidence for all the cases put on their desks. The evidence was either carefully wrapped in plastics or under a stasis charm.
Harry chuckled in response, and began to move through the other archway leading to the dining table. It was a modest table, it wasn’t grand or overbearing like he feared it would be. There were scratch marks on it. His fingers traced over them, and he smiled. This table was well loved, it made Harry almost tear up.
Feeling them both slowly get up, release the Muffliato charm, and walk out the door was hard. But nothing hurt more than when he stopped his breathing to hear whisper-shouts out the door and realising with a cold, empty feeling that Malfoy was outside, crying in the arms of his -no,
Harry got as far as passing the wards before he realised he didn’t know where they were going. He turned back and waited for Malfoy who was, for some reason, locking the door with an actual key.
Harry moved his head slightly, and saw unknown Malfoy again. This new Draco Malfoy, boyfriend to unknown Harry, friends to unknown people. Harry watched as Malfoy moved above him, carefully checking him.
“Go and see Draco, Harry. Go and have a break.” Lavender smiled before she stepped onto the elevator.
Harry didn’t even need to tell Malfoy he wanted to leave. He tapped his shoulder, and Malfoy instantly knew. 5 minutes later they were in the floo, having said brief goodbyes to everyone. Harry walked straight to the bedroom, and flopped onto the bed.
He spent hours reading through them, There weren’t that many, even for 5 years. It seemed he’d fall off and forget about the books for weeks, even months, until he started writing in them again. He understood, life seemed to be busy all the time.
I wrote too much for this chapter so I'm splitting it into two parts. They're both under the same name and for good reason. I hope you enjoy the L E N G T H. (This had little to no editing btw)
This man worked as an apprentice under a famous potioneer for 4 years before opening his own potions shop. He still keeps in touch with his teacher, who had retired a few months back. Malfoy’s love for potions stemmed from a very young age, and his skills were genuine. Despite Snape showing favouritism, Harry knew that Malfoy did deserve every good grade he got in that class.
Harry felt like a right idiot. Of course they’d been sleeping in the same room since they moved in together. Harry felt so stupid. Feeling slightly embarrassed he slapped a palm to his face.
“Something grand must’ve happened for me to ever date you.” Harry said, venom laced into his words. “With our history, different sides of the war. The things you family did against mine. I didn’t think I’d ever forgive that, even if I did speak at your trial.”
Harry laughed softly and crouched down to eye level with Malfoy. He didn’t realise how close they were until Harry could count the lightest freckles on his cheeks. Harry moved back a bit, but he was already enamored.
They talked as much as they could about her notes until the sun was too low to read. Harry didn’t really understand potions still, and Kiana had to explain some basic things, but they worked with what they had.
He’s learning more about this unknown Harry. It helps with his performances, but other than that it feels like weight pulling down on his chest. Unknown Harry was so optimistic, so care free and lively, now it’s just holding a soul of sadness and envy.
Harry just smiled brighter, his cheeks starting to ache. It was amazing, the unity, the freedom. It all felt like he imagined high school would be when he was younger.
They stood there for a while. The sun hitting their skin, the wind still blowing, and the animals moving along without a care. Harry just kept watching it, feeling amazed. He didn’t remember any of it, the campaigns or the fundraisers, but he did remember the feel of Buckbeak’s feathers under his hand, and the rush of adrenaline from flying on his back.
Harry stood up and while Isolt flew for a second, she only landed on top of his head once more. He put his arm in front of him for Isolt to land on, but she stayed perched on his head. He tried to look up at Isolt, and Isolt was only looking back down at him and tilted her head.
Harry didn’t realise how much had changed in the Headmaster’s office. Dumbledore’s portrait was still there, just behind the desk as it was 5 years ago. But Phineas and all the others had moved to different walls. The pensieve cabinet was nowhere to be seen. Even the desk itself seemed to be a different one, a darker more sophisticated wood.
Then it changed. Malfoy’s face completely changed. He was now angry, and incredibly so. The air around him seemed to spark, and Malfoy’s eyes held a raging fire in them.
Andromeda hadn’t aged a day. Her face was still shone with youth just as it had done all those years ago. Her smiles were bright, and her eyes had a sense of peace in them. He held back all the tears that threatened to take over. He told himself he wouldn’t break down again, not like yesterday.
Harry’s had a lot of hit or miss experiences when it came to change. Finding out you’re a wizard? Definite hit. Waking up to find your entire 5 years of life memories are gone? Definite miss. Killing Voldemort? Hit. Losing so many in the process? Miss.
“I didn’t know how to, and then it got so big I was afraid to.” Harry answered, then he gripped his hair and pulled on it in intervals. “The memories… They’re not coming back. I think,” He cleared his throat. “I think I’ve lost them. That life.”
“W-well,” He cleared his throat to give himself a bit more time. “Work has taken over, so we aren’t seeing each other much. But… He cooks for me.”
Draco froze for a second before looking at Harry again with a mix of amazement and confusion. “How did you know what I was going to ask?”
It’s almost lunchtime, but he isn’t hungry. He decides to skip this meal too. The office hasn’t really changed much since he first came into it. The mess was just cleared up, but he kept almost everything where it was before.
She nodded, her smile gone. “I never paid much attention to it, just did what needed to be done. I thought it was an easy O since I passed my OWLs. But, it isn’t. It’s so much more intricate and complicated than I could have ever imagined.”
That made Harry drop one of his cards. He looked up at Teddy, who was looking at him with an intensity a child shouldn’t have.
He must’ve stared at it for too long, willing any memory to come back to his brain so that he could go back to the aurors instead of his crappy desk job. By the time he thought about going downstairs, he was running late.
What came back first was Harry’s consciousness. For a split second, he thought that maybe he was dead. What proved him wrong, however, was the tingling sensation throughout his body. Death didn’t feel like that the first time. On the other hand, time also felt just as odd then as it did now.
Harry smiled, knowing how good of an idea it was. But Pansy and Blaise weren’t smiling at all. In fact, his suggestion seemed to have the exact opposite reaction than what he aimed for.
Malfoy’s shoulders were shaking as he laughed, his head was tilted back as a heavenly smile broke out over his face. He laughed with his entire body. All Harry could do was watch.
It wasn’t completely over, but it was a start. Harry felt his soul breathe just a little bit better.
Luna told him all about her life in the past 5 years. They moved around a bit until they sat on the couch, Luna still recalling important parts of her life to things that were more of a flavour text of sorts.
He turned his head and looked at Malfoy who was eyeing all of the guests. For a heartbreaking second, Harry thought Malfoy was on bad terms with everyone. Then he realised that he was reminding them of something. Harry looked back around at how nonchalant everyone was acting.
With every smiling face he sees, or with every date he reads, it gets harder. His life seemed to be at its peak. He had a job he adored, friends and family he would see often, a house filled with things he remembered, and a boyfriend that he loved. Now he’s gone and messed up a single raid, just one mistake, and that life has fallen right through his hands.
With an ache in his heart, he realised that Malfoy probably hadn’t seen his owl in a while. There was a possibility the owl may have passed, but… Harry didn’t want to think of that.
She sounded absolutely scandalised, leaning back with a hand over her heart. Harry looked at her wide eyed and shocked at the outburst and reaction. It was so wild. Nothing was making sense, but it felt easy.
“You’re a good friend that is loyal and trustworthy. You’ve stared death in the eye and walked back. You’re brave and kind. You love with all your heart. You’re great at Quidditch, played seeker on the Gryffindor team in Hogwarts. You were there at Ginny and Luna’s wedding. You were there at every birthday party held for your friends.”
Things are difficult for Harry. Words slowly disappear, and the journey for memories is covered in shards of glass. Harry's in this situation because of one bad move, so how long does it take until he realises he's made another? Here's part 1 of the second chapter.
Harry looked around at the room. He noticed Malfoy looked up, and smiled at Harry before going back to his conversation with Zabini.
As Minerva and he continued to walk through the grounds, he noticed all the students. Well, more so, how all the students were acting around each other. Ravenclaws play fighting with Gryffindors, Slytherins playing exploding snap with the Hufflepuffs. Almost every single friend group has a mix of more than 2 coloured robes.
“It’s better if we apparate, there’s a point not too far from here.” Hermione said, opening the door.
“Apparently I’m not 20 years old, and the lunch we had to celebrate Hermione’s rise to Minister of Magic wasn’t yesterday.”
He shivered past the wards, the feeling of Malfoy’s magic showering over him. Without a moment to spare, he walked straight to the apparition point. The feeling of his body swirling into itself as he spun on the spot, thinking of the Ministry entrance.
Harry answered honestly, as he’s been talking and seeing him very often. Still, he saw the way Teddy looked at him when Harry tripped over saying ‘Draco.’ Harry had to get used to calling him that if he was going to continue this.
Opening the window was the first step. A gust of wind pushed through, and the smell of dust that Harry didn’t even notice was there, slowly began to disappear. The view from his window was beautiful. He could see the side of the neighbour’s house, the street below and the way it curved. He saw the front yard, eyes landing on the mix of flowers from lilies to daffodils. If he looked hard even, he could make out the shine of the wards. With wide eyes, he realised that this house was in a muggle neighbourhood.
Someone grabbed his hand, held it tightly, like a lifeline. He tried to grip it back, but nothing was responding. His eyes wouldn’t even open. The pain was taking over, he could feel it. Everything started to get a bit lighter.
Ever since then, he has been working in both modelling and photography. Blaise was happy with where he was, with how he got there.
The other Harry would have seen this change slowly over time. Every check in for work to check in as friends. Maybe he even suggested the picture frames and wider window, thinner curtains, and decluttered corners.
Halfway into breakfast, a silver-blue wispy lynx burst into the room, scaring the heart out of everyone in the room, including Isolt. When they regained their composure, Harry knew his day off would not be that at all.
Harry breathed in a sigh of relief. The plan was working quite successfully, and Andromeda couldn’t tell anything was wrong. This could work.
Did he have a lover? How many did he have in that time? Is he in a relationship now? And the question started swirling in his mind, his body sinking into his chest like his heart had stronger gravity. Hermione’s words went through one ear and out the other as he started to descend into disaster.
He packed up the old picture frames away. He wouldn’t throw them, not like that. These were still precious memories, and they weren’t just for him. They were for Malfoy too.
Ron and Malfoy were crying outside, comforting each other. There were many moments when Harry realised that this entire situation was real, that everything he’d missed out on was real and not some sick joke. This might’ve been the most intense one yet.
“AND THEN THEY MADE ME SING WITH THEM!” Ron yelled, then immediately covered his mouth, shocked at his outburst.
Ron and Hermione shared a look before pushing open the doors to a beautiful and busy environment. Harry heard the dinging bell, orders being yelled over the counter, and the sound of people’s conversations overlapping each other.
Harry just nodded. Malfoy set down the big bowl of pasta in the middle of the table. It looked amazing, and his wonder for how Malfoy cooked just increased.
He chased him as Teddy ran around with the energy of a thousand suns. Teddy only stopped when Andromeda brought out the sandwiches she was making for lunch. Ham and cheese, the pure delicacy it was.
He stood up, grabbed his stuff and walked out that door. Looking back once, and only once, he saw Lavender cast the last needed cleaning charms on his desk. He made note to thank her for that tomorrow.
Harry’s eyebrows raised into his hairline. He opened his mouth to respond, but found his throat was incredibly dry.
Harry looked towards the kitchen, Malfoy’s head poking out. He remembered the way it did the first day he came here. How far the both of them had come, how far they had yet to go.
Now it was the 6th day. Her case file still in his hands, and stress emanating off of him so strongly that no one even dared to look his way.
He stepped to the middle of the room and took one full turn. “Okay, Harry James Potter, time to find out who you were.”
He tries to keep holding on to Hermione’s words. But it’s getting harder and harder with every waking hour.
With the same hatred from school? Would you really have stayed here this long if I did? You’d run right back to St Mungo’s at the sight of me.”
Harry laughed at that. A long time ago, he would’ve hated it, but Malfoy’s been lighter on the jokes. In fact, he was genuinely funny and had a good sense of humour once you figured it out.
Under a shimmering stasis charm, a box of owl treats sat untouched. He took one and gave it to Isolt who ate it happily from his hand. His heart hurt as memories of Hedwig came through. But when Isolt rubbed her head against Harry’s hand, and looked up at him with big eyes, he felt that it would be okay.
Hagrid pointed to the hippogriff with white and golden feathers. It had caught Harry’s eyes, but he didn’t feel any type of connection from before. Harry tried so hard to make himself remember something about Hace, trying to remember the feel of their feathers under the palm of his hand. But nothing came.
So that’s what this is about. Harry spent enough time as an auror, even without his memories, to know when someone is trying to get a gauge on your mental health. He’d done it many times before, and even did it for his own gain.
Despite seeing Malfoy everyday, Harry noticed how little they actually talked. With his new job, and with how busy the apothecary was, they didn’t hold much conversation during Harry’s lunch break, and by the time dinner was over, they were too tired to do anything else.
Malfoy looked at Harry, scanning for anything that would hint of a lie. But nothing did. “Okay. Okay, fine. But Harry, you have to promise me that the moment it becomes overwhelming for you, you find me, okay?”
It was hard though. The candle was too far to the left, or the stack of folders wasn’t in a good reaching place from his desk. He never changed it though. Harry kept it as a reminder for how different he is from the Harry before. When he gets his memories back, he’ll be okay with the layout of the office. It’ll be fine.
They waved each other goodbye, even though they’d see each other again in a few hours. Then both took a deep breath in, readying themselves for work.
Goyle apparated them to Nott’s apartment as it was obvious the alcohol was making itself more present in Nott’s system. He started singing a Celestina Warbeck song Harry didn’t know, but came to the conclusion he never wanted to listen to it ever.
Even Harry saw Blaise stand a little straighter in his peripheral at that question. “That person you befriended isn’t me anymore.” Harry stated.
Lavender smiled another sun filled smile, and began walking. “Come on, let me show you to your desk.”
Harry just kept looking at him, and only then did he realise how tired Ron was. He hid it well, but his freckles stood out just a little more, his eyebrows creased a little too tightly. Harry never would’ve realised if he didn’t know he was looking for it.
And his mind descended into a spiral. He wasn’t sure if he was even breathing anymore. Was there still blood in his veins? Beating of his heart?
It was refreshing. The Malfoy in charge of the apothecary was different from the Malfoy at home. This one was more of how he was in school. The flattery, the coolness, even to the point he would deal with rude customers with a subtle harshness and authority.
His grip tightened in the picture frame. How could he not realise? But by god, 5 years feel like an eternity when it comes to the growth of a kid. He was just a baby last time he remembered, but here he was, smiling and jumping and walking like a kid.
The hope in Harry started to grow. Memories! He might be able to remember something. He could take anything. Hell, he’d take a bad pun from Ron if that’s all his mind would give him. At least it would be something.
Harry laughed and patted his shoulder. “No, that’s good. Means I’ll try even harder to beat you in the next duel.”
Harry felt heat rushing to his neck. Oh Merlin, how’d he forget Isolt was up there. Truthfully, she hadn’t moved at all, and then he was distracted by the food, and then Malfoy was being actually pretty okay. It’s been a busy hour, okay?
“He’s doing very well, considering how long he was asleep,” Tina said, flipping her notes. “I was most concerned when he got hit in the abdomen during the duel, but he took it as well as a healthy patient normally would.”
Finally, Malfoy moved away, Isolt perched happily on his arm. The way Malfoy looked at Isolt was heartwarming. He was so careful and gentle with her. Harry didn’t realise he hadn’t seen them interact before, but the way they were right now showed there wasn’t a single doubt that Malfoy deeply cared for and loved Isolt.
He watched from the desk. The soft warm brown of Isolt’s wings next to the slowly darkening sky. The sky now filled with a mix of a red orange slowly being overrun by dark blues, and the cotton candy clouds. It was beautiful.
Out of all the stories, he didn’t expect Beauty and the Beast. Even so, it was a good story. So he opened the book, and read it to Teddy.
“I must go. I’m meeting some students soon,” Minerva smiled and waved. “It’s so good to see you’re okay.”
Harry dodged, just barely. The quick movement brought a sharp pain just above his stomach. He was still healing, and this duel was a stupid idea. Yet, he continued on.
Now cut to Harry, near to tears, huddling and hiding in the shadows of his boyfriend’s store. Pathetic.
“It’s not your fault. It’s no one’s fault.” Malfoy’s voice was back to the calmness it was before. “Bad situations seem to have a thing for us, don’t they?”
He retreated his hand from Hermione and moved his legs away from Ron. It was so snake-like, coiling into himself. Hugging himself like the scared kid he was in the cupboard all those years ago.
This time it would be important. This time he didn’t have to remember that he’s at a desk job he hated, or that he’d forgotten some of the best times of his life. He didn’t need to be the Harry he was now, he could be the Harry of back then who had friends like these two with no worries.
Harry was ready to leave, knowing that it was a bad idea to have visited him when his store was so busy. But he looked over to Malfoy again, and found he was free.
Each got their fair share of cakes and cookies. They sat down and relaxed into the seats Malfoy had transfigured for them a few days ago. The seats were super comfortable and had a faint feel of his magic if he focused hard enough on it.
That was the first of many moments Harry realised Lavender Brown was completely and utterly in love with her job.
After the apothecary visit, the Daily Prophet had a field day. Throwing out conspiracy theories as to why ‘The Boy Who Lived to Hide.’ Harry didn’t even get through half of the article before he
With one startling moment, Harry realised that Malfoy must know at least a little bit of his traumatic childhood. He wasn’t sure how to handle that information. Thankful that he didn’t need to tell Malfoy, but also uncomfortable he knew something he kept deep down.
He walked up to the teachers table, where Neville had left a seat beside him. All the professors were talking amongst each other, Flitwick, Minerva, and Slughorn seemed to be in a heated conversation, Neville, Hagrid, and Grubbly-Plank were joking around, even the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, an ex-auror who lost her leg during the battle of Hogwarts and who looked like she could kick your arse while preparing the best tea, was laughing with Trelawney.
Ginny looked excited to recount that day, and Luna just rolled her eyes affectionately while looking at her wife. Harry swallowed the lump that formed at his throat at the pure adoration they had for each other, and nodded.
Harry woke up the next day feeling a million times better than he had when he fell asleep. Eyes blinking awake, he patted at the table next to him for his glasses. Finding them, he yawned, and put them on.
“Yeah?” Harry wasn’t sure he was comfortable with Malfoy calling him by his first name just yet. Even though they’ve been dating for a while, it still shocked him a bit.
Before he could even turn his body to get out of the kitchen, Teddy leaped in, snitch plushie still in hand. Teddy took one look at Harry, and tilted his head.
Harry and Malfoy were still swamped and tired from work. Malfoy began leaving before Harry even woke up to ensure all the potions brewing in the side of his shop were of the best quality. Harry didn’t mind, head filled the thoughts of his own job.
Harry wasn’t sure if he would have, to be honest. But one thing he was sure of was that their guard was up. Both of them were extremely cautious, just like in Hogwarts. Zabini and his watchful eye, and Parkinson with her defensive questions.
It was difficult though, as people were still mean, taking one look at the half-giant and coming to a conclusion that he was ‘unsafe’ for travel. The fact he was expelled didn’t help his case much either. Yet they tried, and quietly too, not asking for Harry’s help even though he told Hagrid he would do anything to help.
Harry ducked his head, hoping no one would recognise him. Neville and Goyle immediately noticed his reaction, and said it would be best if we left now.
He talked to Andromeda for a bit. Harry found out that Andromeda wasn’t working anymore, her vaults being generous enough anyway. He hugged her tightly, and didn’t quite want to let go just yet. But he did, and he just smiled and thanked her for taking care of Teddy.
There’s just something about him that Harry wasn’t ready to confront yet. He knew he would have to eventually, but it’s too fast. Too much too quickly. So he kept filing, clearing the piles of folders in his head, assigning them elsewhere.
The sound of a kettle boiling, and clinks of mugs hit their ears as they waited for healer Tina to come back. Harry wanted to talk to Ron and Hermione, but he didn’t know where to begin. Honestly, he just wanted to sleep.
Everyone was the same, yet different. A sense of familiarity was the only thing he gained from going through the pictures. His mind couldn’t place it, the reasons or the logic as to why everyone was moving so well together, but he just knew they would.
He decided to tackle the desk first. Moving around to sit down, he took note of just how messy it was. Broken quills and dried out ink pots littered one of the corners. He moved to grab one of the pens, and tested it on a random piece of paper. Out of the 3 pens on the table, only one of them could actually be used.
“No need to thank me. I have been your main healer for the past 4 years.” She smiled, a hint of sadness in there.
Lavender, how long it’s been since he even last thought of her. He felt terrible, knowing he hadn’t seen her since graduation. But even as the scars on her face only seemed to have darkened, her smile seemed a lot more confident.
“I’ll leave you to it. Shout if you need me.” And with that, Malfoy was gone, shutting the door behind him.
Malfoy was nowhere to be found. Harry looked at the kitchen counter, and of course, there was a note.
Harry noticed that Molly, Arthur, Andromeda and Teddy were going to the backyard. Teddy was jumping up, as if he was practicing catching a real snitch. It made his heart bloom.
Malfoy’s head turned so fast, Harry thought it might end up on the floor. Before he could even laugh at the thought, he was engulfed in a tight embrace. Harry, mind racing and still very confused by all the information he was given, patted Malfoy’s back three times and pulled away.
Hagrid looked at him with a sadness in his eyes. “I know I shouldn’t tell ye’ this, but it don’ matter. Yer still ‘ere, alive an’ all. It don’t matter tha’ ye chose a diff’rent hippogriff or-”
He swore he heard Hermione and Ron whispering with Malfoy as well, but he was too thick with sleep at that point to properly register it.
Malfoy visibly relaxed and took his hand off Harry's shoulder. Harry felt the difference. He decided to put that thought in for later. Thoughts for later seemed to pile up.
Harry got ready for work. A new clean button up shirt, and his Ministry working robes. His auror robes were still folded cleanly in his drawers. He often tried not to look at it, but today it grabbed his attention.
Teddy sat up at that, and looked Harry in the eyes. Under his gaze, Harry felt vulnerable. He was amazed that Teddy could do that, but still, he gulped like he did something wrong.
He leant against the tree trunk, feeling like he was back in 8th year, needing to get away from everyone and everything. Harry smiled as he remembered how much this place meant to him, how somehow no one seemed to find him here. As if the tree casted more than its shadow, that it was more than its leaves.
After a long talk with Ron and Tina, Harry decided to try getting the memories himself. Apparently, the clash of spells that hit him during his apparent last auror raid was Obliviate, Confundus, and Stupefy. The shield that he threw up wasn’t strong enough. So, added onto the onslaught of spells, he flew back and hit his head hard against the brick wall.
It wasn’t what was really on his mind, but it did make him feel better. Who cares if everyone’s love life was secure and Harry felt insecure and jealous? It’s fine because they’re all still together, still friends.
Blaise finally spoke up. “Wouldn’t you prefer friends telling you the sad truth, rather than lying?”
Neville, the absolute madman, left Harry and ran to them and hugged them tightly. Harry watched their greeting, soft kisses and gentle touches of hands. And for some reason, Malfoy came into his mind.
There were so many things he didn’t think about, like how many fights did he have with his friends? What else did he give up without trying? That life was becoming less perfect, and more real.
Harry just kept on writing. It might have been nonsense, or a beautifully written poem. He didn’t get to find out either way because his inkwell exploded.
Since then, everything started to look up. Even though opening the shop was so hard, everyone glaring and wary of the ‘Death Eater,’ his teacher never gave up on him
“Yeah, okay,” Harry laughed bitterly. “Let’s think about that later,” Harry whispered into the emptiness of his room.
Lara practically squealed. She smiled and put her chin on her hands while her elbows were on the table. Her eyes were now looking up, expectant for more.
“Oh, I did? So you’ve heard about,” Harry looked around at the portraits, making sure no gossiping ears were in on the conversation. He still lowered his voice. “My memories?”
The third box and final box to be opened contained ones that seemed to make Harry want to cry, vomit and scream at the same time. Each and every single one were just him and one other person. Most of them were Malfoy and Harry, but there were others. Harry and Ron, Harry and Hermione, even ones with an unknown Parkinson and Zabini.
Malfoy just blinked in response. Harry wasn’t quite ready to hear Malfoy tell him about everything, but he knew that he probably never would be. It wasn’t fair to learn about this man’s past just by bits and pieces he’s picked up. Malfoy deserved to give his view on his life.
So she went to the muggle world, and found how different it was. How better. How accepting. Harry marvelled at this part, how her views had changed so quickly in the right direction with a little help.
“Oh, yeah. He said something about additional suppliers. He’s been really stressed lately, I’m worried.”
Once the window opened, Harry expected Isolt to go flying. Yet, she didn’t. She kept staring at Harry, head tilted, as if she knew this Harry was different. Owls were incredibly smart. As the staring continued, he felt like he was being tested. Finally, Isolt hooted softly, and moved to rub her head against Harry’s jaw.
It was subtle and if Harry didn’t know to look for it, he wouldn’t have seen it. But he saw them both, their walls slowly crumbling.
Harry didn’t realise just how hungry he was. He was so busy with his office and the picture frames that hunger didn’t seem important. Now it was the only thing on his mind.
Malfoy took it, and didn’t let go even after he got up. One part of Harry was screaming at him to let go, the other was telling him to hold on even tighter. Harry ignored both of them with a fierce determination.
“I thought you were the chef in the relationship,” She smirked. “He’s taking over, and you’re letting him!”
As Harry walked through the floo and into the Burrow, Harry realised he fucked up. Did they know his memory was gone? Would they still be expecting the Harry they’d gotten used to, and not the one with memory loss?
“You’ve put a lot of hard work into these notes,” Harry gently spoke. “Are they not helping at all?”
Hermione hid her exhaustion well too. Her dark skin looked a tinge more grey, than the full of life he was used to. Her jaw line jutted out, making it slightly more pronounced, and her smile didn’t reach her eyes.
Harry gulped, trying not to choke in his cookie. “Your friends said that? Maybe you should get new ones.”
He put the takeaway containers on the countertop, and pushed one to Malfoy. Over time, Harry noticed that Malfoy enjoyed the mac and cheese a lot more than other selections from the cafeteria, so he got him that today too.
Now here was Isolt, content and perched on Harry’s arm as he rubbed her neck softly. Her feathers were soft and well taken care of. Isolt, with her range of browns all over her body, was incredibly different from Hedwig's snow white. Even so, Harry could imagine himself loving Isolt just as much.
“Not strange, it’s just enchanted to make the room seem more manageable. It helps people concentrate. If the room expanded to it’s full size…”
He has completely fallen into the idea. A part of him knows it’s a bad one, so very bad with consequences, but it had worked with Lara. Who else could it work on? Harry started walking to the apparition point they had arrived at.
Finally, there was space for his new books on the shelves. Malfoy’s books now reordered in a completely new way that still, somehow, felt like him.
Harry quickly took his hand away, and stood up. “Yeah, I’m fine.” He ignored the way his hand tingled, or the fast beating of his heart, or the way his chest leaped. “Why were you sleeping here?”
“By the way,” Hagrid started. “I know yer memory is gone an’ all, but being with the hippogriffs didn’t help or nothin’?”
“We probably won’t tell him, as long as you’ve learnt your lesson. Remember, Harry. You will regret it.” Pansy reiterated.
Harry, mouth filled with as much as he could fit in it, finally looked over at the students in the Great Hall. The difference couldn’t have been avoided even if he wanted to ignore it. But it was there.
Aside from the evidence areas, there were small rooms spaced out amongst the place. Each room held a single pensieve and what seemed to be a vast collection of memories held in glass vials.
Malfoy’s hair was just as soft as he expected it to be. Harry’s fingers carded gently through Malfoy’s hair, he watched as each hair fell gently, as if each strand was afraid it would make a sound.
He braced himself for Andromeda to immediately catch on to what Harry was planning, but all she did was laugh.
Parkinson and Zabini looked at each other, a silent conversation between them. Harry looked out the doorway and into the shop. Malfoy was there, dealing with customers professionally.
Lavender shook her head. “Nope, and I don’t really need to know either. Kingsley made it seem important, but confidential. I understand. Took them long enough to give you a break though.”
“No! No,” Harry pleaded. “Bring them there. It’ll be better to get it over with, and it’s a controlled environment anyway, right? I can just floo home if I’m overwhelmed.”
Pansy’s anger came in waves. She pushed and pulled the conversation, one moment she seemed to hold composure, the next it was crashing.
Harry stared at him, eyebrows furrowed in anger, but eyes blinking away tears. All the emotions, every single one, that was bubbling and boiling over, ready to explode, started to dissipate. The tension left his body, and his shoulder sagged, arms swinging limblessly at his side.
As if Harry’s heart couldn’t be any more happier, his mind was still unsure and uncertain. “Oh, thank you, that’s really kind.”
over the room. He thought that maybe he should run before he finds out what’s going on. But when his eyes landed on Pansy again, he was frozen with the ice she held in her gaze.
Teddy crossed his arms, and continued to analyse Harry like a professional auror would. “You said that, so why were you pretending to be the other Harry when you talked to Andromeda before?”
Harry breathed in deeply at the vision, and held his breath. He put all his feelings into a tight ball in his chest. His love, regret, sadness, pain, admiration, all of it. Then he breathed back out slowly turning all of it into forgiveness for himself. It was okay. It was okay to have another pet. It was okay to have Isolt.
Ron stifled a laugh. “Yeah, the pap absolutely ran you through when you went to Draco’s shop, didn’t they?”
Hermione grabs a glass of water and gives it to him as he tries to hold back his tears. He holds it, but doesn’t drink. He just looks into it. His shaking hands distort his reflection, making him look slightly different, warped, but still recognisable in a weird way. He blinks away his tears and looks up at Hermione.
Malfoy started shuffling even faster. There were only so many combinations in which the papers could be rearranged. Surely Malfoy had created each one at least twice.
Feeling his eyes were still puffy and his hands still had a slight shake, he stayed in the room, not going downstairs just yet. He’d forgotten to ask Malfoy about the missing pictures in the house, but with how intensely he reacted to the one on his desk, he was thankful he did.
Harry took another bite from his sandwich, something light for lunch. “It doesn’t hurt anymore, Tina. I don’t know what happened, but I feel like I’m supposed to.”
Harry moved to get the dishes and put them in the kitchen when he heard Malfoy. “Just leave them, I’m not done. I’ll finish after I show you your office.”
When he finally stopped crying, his breathing now normal and glasses put on, he reached over for the stack of journals and began reading.
He glazed over the details. Name: Lia Adwin. Would be age 22 now, disappeared 5 years ago, short punk styled hair, tan skin, and short. Has a scar on her lip that goes down to her chin.
Harry kept silent, knowing that Malfoy wasn’t finished yet. In fact, Harry himself was trying to sort out his feelings with this new information. There was so much he didn’t know, so much that couldn’t be seen in a photo or read in a journal.
Malfoy held up a hand to stop the beginning of Harry’s word vomit. “A few years ago, you wanted to teach me. So you did.”
“Merlin, Harry. You scared me half to death!” Malfoy said, still shakey and not putting his wand down.
This laugh was different from before. Very different from the laugh Malfoy had when Isolt stayed perched on his head, and more so different from The Burrow party when Ron stole Ginny’s storytelling spotlight.
Harry, finally sitting at the table, instantly dug into his food. Malfoy, he noted, ate slowly. There were no words shared between them.
Three neatly stacked boxes shimmered into view. Harry gasped and stood up, walking to them quickly. Malfoy followed. Before Harry could open the box to look inside, Malfoy’s hand landed on the top.
Ron’s eyes widen at Harry’s definite tone. “Hey, mate it’s okay. That’s fine, but why? We can tell you’re being annoyed with the memories thing…”
By the time Harry heard the spare bedroom’s door open and the sun knock gently on his curtains, he was already changed and ready for Hogwarts at least 2 hours too early. He yawned, already exhausted, and started heading down to meet Malfoy for breakfast.
He was prepared for all questions and statements, ready for his whole life to be told to him piece by piece by someone he’s never met. They ask about Voldemort, or about the scar, most times about the war. The amount of times he’s had to recall it was astronomical.
Throughout those days, he had made no progress on the Lia Adwin case. He even began to look into the other case files on his desk, but none interested him as much as Adwin’s file. Sometimes it felt like he was just reading the same things over and over again from every angle but the right one.
“Childhood muggle stories, even some wizarding ones. Then one day, you gave them away to anyone who would take it. Aunt Andromeda took in some of them, Teddy probably doesn’t realise many of his books used to be yours. No matter how many times I asked you why you did it, you never told me.”
Malfoy stopped short of the last room which Harry concluded was his own office. “Harry, you don’t remember anything from the past 5 years. You don’t remember… us. So, until you get your memories back, we’ll be sleeping in different rooms.”
Malfoy faltered slightly. “Harry, I know you don’t remember them, so if I told them they couldn’t go they would understand. If you don’t want them there then-”
“You think I don’t know that? Merlin, for once in my life I try to do the right thing, and you come and fuck it all up. How else should I have acted,
“You kept all of this… Why didn’t you tell anyone? Ron and Hermione?” Malfoy asked quietly after processing all the knowledge.
do that.” That word was a hammer and nail to his skull. His spine thrummed with magic, and his brain broke.
Harry’s office now looked a lot better. Folders all stacked neatly on top of each other, books sitting tightly together. Amidst all the mess going on in Harry’s life, at least this one place, this one single place that was purely his, was organised.
Harry didn’t expect to hug her again so soon, but he couldn’t help it. Minerva hadn’t changed, she was just as she was, and it meant everything to Harry right now.
The following days were around the same. Terribly stagnant, no change except for the conversations held on the days. There was no change in the case, nor the visits to Malfoy, and his friends.
“So putting me on a desk job will do the trick?” A bitter laugh escaped him, one rumbling with the depths of his belly, filled with disbelief and anger. “I can’t do anything if I’m not moving, Kingsley! My entire life has been moving, always doing something.”
The same was with the small amount of evidence. A ring that was found in her front yard, and a wand.
“Not so fast, Harry. I just showed you the desk, there’s a lot more to being in the investigatives.”
One time he asked a coworker beside him in the coffee room how long she’d been working on her case. Harry grimaced and wanted to cry when she said, “About two months.”
Harry looked at the third year students in front of him. So many with blank faces, others holding back a starstruck expression. Harry waved confidently, receiving a few halfhearted waves back.
“And I’ve missed you too! You can’t go disappearing again for so long,” She huffed. “Anyway, where’s Draco? He’s at work?”
“Oh I bet,” Harry continued, wondering if this was still pushing his luck. “Draco complained about the sand for weeks afterwards. Add that onto his sunburn, and it was quite intense.”
It was small things like that that dug slowly but deeply into Harry's skin. Small things about the Harry from before, details that wouldn’t be in the journal or the books. They were small things, but they just kept piling on, and it screamed out to Harry how different he really was.
Too riled up to pack the pictures back in their boxes, he near-sprinted upstairs to the table. He needed to get his memories back, no matter what. For Teddy, for Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Malfoy… But most of all for himself. There was too much tightness, too much tension in every movement, every word he’s said since he woke up.
His eyes travelled over each page. Remnants of his anger made him have to reread sentences. He finally got halfway through a journal, which he found was just filled with dates for interviews, meetings, and speeches, and decided it was time for a break.
As he did, he looked over the eagle owl. There was a small hint of worry growing in his chest. A lot of higher ups owned eagle owls, so maybe it was Kingsley, or maybe someone from the Daily Prophet saw him with his friends.
All too suddenly, a tear rolled down his cheek. It stopped and kissed at the scars he didn’t remember getting. He gently wiped it away.
It started out normally. Ginny recalling the moments of the actual wedding. Ginny’s best man was Neville, apparently. While Luna’s best man was Malfoy. They recalled how asking them had been a mix of horror and awe. Both of them were excited to be it, while intensely stressing about what it meant. On the day, both Neville and Malfoy did their jobs wonderfully.
But the silence fell, and the only sound was the water. Harry looked away, coming to the conclusion that, yeah, it was kinda weird to look so he stared at the lake.
Harry said his goodbye’s to Goyle and Nott, and thanked them for letting him join them on what he realised was a date night. Goyle just said it was fine while Nott, slightly slurred words and a lot more confidence than Nott could ever need, told him not to do it again since this was a freebie and ‘you lost the memories of us, how dare you?’
Harry debated on just leaving him there, since he was sound asleep. But one look at his position, and Harry knew Malfoy would wake up with several neck and back pains. Slowly, he shook Malfoy’s shoulder.
“Not everyone is here, but we’re all here with you every step of the way. We’re here to help. It’s a shitty situation but, y’know, we can handle it.” Ron smiled and jokingly punched Harry’s arm.
It was like her look was a hand around his neck, squeezing and strangling until his one thought was survival. But he didn’t want to give in. They haven’t accused him of anything yet, they don’t know.
She stopped in front of the 4 of them. 3 sipping tea, and a man with blood on him on the floor. Tina rubbed her temple and sighed.
The bubble of magic around him disappeared, but he kept staring at his friend and school rival in shock. He didn’t even hear the questions his healer asked as he just kept staring at the three in confusion.
Malfoy was laying on the couch in front of the floo, asleep in what looked to be silk pyjamas. Harry, stifling a scared scream, stared at him. What on earth was Malfoy doing, sleeping on the couch when there was a perfectly fine bed upstairs?
“So, Harry. How have you been lately?” Parkinson asked, her eyebrow raised at the mac and cheese for Malfoy.
This is an environment that both of them knew very well. Harry wanted to go back into work, wanted to be back on the field, regardless of what that small voice in his head was saying.
“Oh, that. Well, we do a lot of demonstrations for the duelling club,” Neville said nonchalantly. “The students love it, and it really helps.”
“I’m home!” Malfoy called out, putting his coat over the chair and setting his bag down on top of the mantle.
Nott held out his hand for a handshake. Harry looked at it, unsure of what to do. But when Nott’s hand started to fall, Harry grabbed it and smiled.
When Harry said goodbye a few hours later, he hugged Teddy just a little bit tighter and kissed the top of his head. He thanked Andromeda for letting him in on such short notice.
He expected a grand welcoming one way or another, but it didn’t happen. The group just nodded, some saying hi, others nodding hello. They were all surrounding the table filled to the brim with food. Malfoy wasn’t kidding when he told Harry not to eat too much leading up to the dinner.
“Malfoy, I need to know,” Harry cut him off before he could forget to ask. “Where are the rest of the picture frames? There’s no way I would only have one in the house.”
Malfoy looked… confused, hopeful, unsure and scared all at the same time. They stared at each other for what felt like years. All of Harry’s thoughts about work seeped out of his mind. All he thought of now was what he was doing, and what he had done.
Ron's face was still in his hands, but he was shaking his head now, mumbling words like, “Oh Merlin,” and “My eyes.”
Harry wanted to drink his, but he didn’t fancy the taste of blood mixed in. It smelt divine though. It helped distract him from the growing pain right above his stomach. It wasn’t a sharp pain anymore, it was a distant ache. He no longer wanted to cough, but once Harry opened his mouth to say anything, Hermione, Ron and even Malfoy shot him a look that said, “Nope. Shut up.”
Perspective? Harry wanted to vomit. How could everyone else not see that all Harry did was for everyone else? All his life, he’s been looking at other people’s side of views, how society perceived him, his friends too. It’s all he’s known, how was it not enough?
They appeared in a place Harry didn’t recognise. It wasn’t Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade, nor was it any of the wizarding places he knew.
He held out a small tinge of hope that he’d find something new. Especially with his idea of reaching out to the connections themselves. His auror observations skills would be incredibly useful, even if it wasn’t an interrogation. He’d find something. Hopefully.
At that moment, Minerva stood up and addressed the students. The announcements were over within seconds, and soon everyone had food appear in front of them.
Harry didn’t know what he was apologising for, but he felt the need to. Even as Malfoy got up, and moved towards the living room, Harry reached for him.
“I know, isn’t it great? I’ll finally be out of here.” He smiled a little too much to be considered genuine.
“Am I?” Malfoy put down the spoon, the food long forgotten. “I’ve had weeks of knowing your memory is gone. Since the first day, I knew you’d forgotten,” His voice cracked. “Us.... Every day we’ve spent together as friends and more just gone because one single raid had gone wrong. I spent days crying. Hermione and Ron had to come over and make sure I ate every day, did you know?”
“Read this to me. It’ll be like the first time again.” Teddy’s smile shone so brightly, Harry couldn’t possibly refuse.
A wave of doubt and hesitance washed over him. He knew it would be difficult to change his mindset so suddenly, but he didn’t expect to fight himself this hard.
They stayed like that for a moment, like a movie paused at the worst and weirdest time. But just as suddenly, they burst out laughing.
“Sorry, you two just-” Another burst of laughter that Malfoy tried so hard to contain. “Were so shocked, and then the wings-”
He looked back at the archway to the kitchen, and there it was. A beautiful brown owl, staring up at him with the widest eyes he’s ever seen. It hooted again softly, and tilted its head as Harry walked closer.
Harry looked around. The restaurant was quieter now, but it kept that environment that he loved dearly. Tables were emptying, customers were leaving, and the bells slowly stopped ringing. But the love that was overflowing in this place was incredible.
Somehow, Harry had woken up in a bed when he distinctly remembered he fell asleep on the floor. He sat up, and looked around. This must’ve been the bedroom unknown Malfoy and unknown Harry had shared. Laundry basket in the corner, drawers and closets pushed against the wall.
Dinner was about the same as it always had been though. Malfoy still didn’t let Harry help with cooking, but they would go out and shop for ingredients together if they had extra energy to spare. Even if the conversation was shallow, they still made time to talk.
Tina led him to her office to where the floo was. No one thought he was ready to apparate just yet. With one hand grabbing a handful of floo powder, and the other taking the piece of paper with his address on it, he sighed. Tina waved goodbye as Harry spoke.
Harry realised the hands that held his while he slept was Malfoy’s. Harry quickly put that thought away for later. There was another pressing matter at hand.
Harry knew that wasn’t all. He watched as the man beside him continued to poke and prod his food, not going to eat anymore. Harry did forget about the eagle owl of the Hogwarts days, swarming over the Slytherin table carrying gifts of expensive chocolates and other wonders.
Harry walked back into the shop to talk to Malfoy before going back to that damn desk. The shop was quieter now, less crowded, and no broken things in sight.
“Yeah, I know. But thank you either way.” Harry held out his hand, for some reason wanting to reach out to him. “C’mon, you should sleep in a real bed.”
Harry wanted to run, to back away and shake his head and put all those thoughts back in the ‘for later’ pile that has grown so tall. He didn’t even realise his heart was booming through his chest until it was the only thing he could hear. Like it was an earthquake, shaking the very core of his soul, towers swaying back and forth, breaking and falling and losing structure. He couldn’t move. He tried to force his fingertips to twitch, or his eyes to blink or look away, but nothing was working.
“You didn’t miss much, Pans. We did make fun of Ron with Celestina.” Blaise told her, a distant smile. As if the memory of that night was too good to be true,
Harry didn’t notice Nev and Nott’s conversation had quieted down. Neville was quiet, giving space and time for Harry to get used to Goyle and Nott. While it was nice and caring, he was actually feeling like he was suffocating.
Harry was thankful, though a little annoyed at the slight jab. But Malfoy just smiled back at him, and started walking towards the group of people.
Despite her words, Harry’s jealousy just grew. It was frustrating how Harry could have almost everything, everything that current Harry could never believe would even be possible for him, and it all just fell through his hands.
It was a picture frame. A moving picture frame. A group of people laughing and smiling, arms over shoulders and a flash of the camera. A moment of camaraderie held within a simple frame.
He grabbed a handful of powder and stepped in. “The Burrow!” Malfoy watched as Harry was engulfed by the green flames.
Everyone was chatting amongst each other, everyone at peace. It seemed, for a moment, that everything was normal. That this was familiar, but it was just a feeling, not a memory. He couldn’t recall a single time something like this would have happened, but it was okay. It was okay. It
“Let’s go, chosen boy.” Parkinson said as she squeezed through the doorway that Harry was half-blocking.
A flutter of wings and a soft hoot brought him back to the real world. Isolt perched on the window sill, a letter tied to her foot. Harry walked over, and pet her gently. In time he knew he’d get used to having an owl again, and that somewhere deeply hidden in his mind was a reason he bought another.
so brightly and so beautifully, Harry for a moment didn’t think he was meant to see it, like it was too private for him to even have a glimpse of.
Hermione pulled away, and gestured for Harry to drink the water. He did, and felt a million times better.
It’s times like this that Harry wishes out of all the memories he had, he could forget overhearing Malfoy’s breakdown at The Burrow. Harry never talked it out with him, and to be honest, he didn’t think he ever could. Those words weren’t meant for Harry’s ears, even if they had fallen on them by accident.
“You’re early. I wasn’t expecting you for at least another hour.” It was Malfoy’s voice. Slightly deeper than in his memory. A lot more calm than from when he woke up. “Couldn’t wait to get out of there, could you, you impatient git.”
He threw away all his old and broken things. He cleared out his drawers, the folders, the shelves. Case folders that must’ve been missing from the aurors, he packed, ready to return to Kingsley tomorrow when he gets to work.
He felt himself sway as he stepped away from the door. He wants to run, or cry, or both. The gift from the heavens she is, Hermione appeared beside him on his way to the kitchen. She held his hand as she led the way.
Where? Harry didn’t know. From what? He didn't know that either. But the adrenaline shot through his veins. Even with energy bursting in his body, he stayed still and staring.
What really happened was pretty much the opposite. He stood up faster than humanly possible and had already had such a burst of magic that the room rumbled, shaking the frames on the walls. It all happened in less than a second, but it was enough time for Harry’s mind to catch up and realise what he’d done.
“I chose a different hippogriff?” Harry’s heart started to race. Did he lose the trust of one of the magnificent creatures? Had he made a terrible mistake by not knowing?
But he kept his voice calm, lacing it delicately with his emotions. “I do. None of my memories are coming back, Malfoy.”
Ron and Hermione rushed in almost immediately after Harry heard Tina’s heels echo down the hallway. Ron with red-rimmed eyes, and Hermione a face that changed emotions every second.
Amazed at how low Malfoy’s walls were around Harry, he grabbed the plates, cutlery, and glasses, and brought them to the table. He laid them all neatly, well as neat as they could be, and sat down to wait.
His emotions were all over the place, as he sat down on the chair in front of Kingsley’s desk. Familiar bubbles of jealousy, hope being strangled by desperation. Nothing makes sense.
As he stepped into the floo, he thought about what Teddy had said. The strong, “Don’t do it.” started to echo in his mind. But Harry didn’t think he could. He was still jealous and scared and frustrated at his lack of memories.
Goyle himself was suppressing laughter, letting out a snicker every now and then. Harry laughed with them, feeling guilt but also a sense of freedom that only the Harry from before could have.
Hermione answered first. “We’ve been busy, some stuff happened. How’ve you been, Lara? That place looks more lively than before.”
Harry continued eating a lot slower than when he started. He watched Malfoy, still trying to get a gauge on who unknown Malfoy was.
The insult was laced with layers of affection. Harry wanted to run. It was all too fast, too weird, too uncomfortable, too… much.
“So, Harry, how are you and the pretentious blonde prat?” Lara joked as she leaned forward in excitement.
The floor stopped shaking, and the books stopped falling out of the shelves. But no one moved. Not Malfoy. Not Harry.
Harry nodded and followed him through to the training rooms for new aurors.Past the swimming pools and training dummies, classrooms and blackboards. He remembered training vigorously for a year with Ron struggling beside him, jokes and laughter while puffing exhaustedly.
“I thought if I could just…” Harry struggled to form the word. Afraid that the moment he says it, everything would fall apart. “Pretend.”
“Hey, Harry. Have you seen Ron? Ginny’s looking for him. She’s gonna play Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love, but he needs to be in the room when she plays it.” She picked up one of the chocolate brownies from the table.
Ron was head auror, and rightfully so. Through training, Ron developed his strategic mind, one Harry knew he had from the beginning with Wizard’s Chess. Ron was careful, and logical, and moved without recklessness compared to Harry’s instincts of ‘now or never.’ Harry couldn’t imagine anyone else being head auror. He knew Ron doubted his qualifications for the role, but Ron was brave, noble and respectful. He was perfect for the position.
Harry was touched that Teddy would go that far for him. “Just because it’s my favourite, doesn’t mean it has to be yours.”
Charlie Weasley and Hagrid kept in touch after the war, Harry knew. Sending notes even more often than during his Hogwarts years. However, as they continued talking about dragons and their immense love of the creatures, they both kept trying very hard for Hagrid to go over to Romania and help with the dragon care over there.
Malfoy still had a smile on his face, remnants of the laughter from earlier. But that wasn’t just it. The laughter was definitely sorely needed on Malfoy’s part because his eyes seemed to be a bit more lively, and his skin a little more healthier.
What came back next was the pain. Excruciating pain. He felt like there were ants trapped in the middles of his bones, his skin felt like each crevice contained a pool of molten lava, and the hair on his skin felt like wasp stings.
After finishing his food, and relaxing his muscles for a bit, Harry and Kingsley walked back to his office.
Oh, Merlin. The familiar surge of heat, acid filled envy and bile of jealousy fizzled in his chest. He’d forgotten just how much he’d lost from that accident. If he remembered something,
