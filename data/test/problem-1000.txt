Harry walked to his uncle and aunt’s room, opening the door slightly.  The room was bare, just like Dudley’s.  It appeared that all the work had been done in the living room.  Sighing, he quietly closed the door and walked toward his own bedroom.  The Ministry had sent an official in the middle of the week, asking him questions about the Dursleys and their contacts.  His information didn’t seem to be a lot though, judging by the frustrated look in the official’s eyes.  Before she had left, she had asked which room was his so that it wouldn’t be touched while the house was cleaned up.
"And how exactly," the vampire said in a low-pitched voice heard by everyone, "did you come to that conclusion?"
Was this a new trick? In all the other duels Lest had never once insulted any of the contestants. Even when he used his mocking tone of voice he was still just giving them assistance.
“At the moment, it’s not certain if the attack is related with Voldemort or not, or if it was even a magical attack,” Dumbledore said quietly, his blue eyes looking somberly at him.  Fear and worry left him for a moment and Harry looked confusedly at the Headmaster.
,’ he thought shakily, thankfully, his eyesight blurring and stinging and those were tears, those were tears in his eyes as his hand clamped down on Harry’s arm, lying asleep and silent in his mind and he still couldn’t help but reach out like he used to and probe, almost desperately, for thoughts that weren’t his own.  He took in a shuddering breath and scrubbed his free arm across his eyes when he felt nothing, a trace of disappointment and emptiness that he shoved far down to think on later.
Harry seemed to be in a state of stasis, almost coma-like. Qye winced as he found Harry to still have a high fever, radiating exhaustion that only an extremely ill person had. Calling his name repeatedly seemed to have no effect and Qye sighed, crossing his legs and propping his elbows on his knees, resting his head on his hands.
“Stupid Lest,” she muttered, reopening her eyes to look at the unread essays.  “Stupid, foolish, reckless little brother…” She shook her head.
Harry froze, staring at Madam Pomfrey, as the words meaning hit him.  “But…but it was a different color then it was supposed to be,” he said, shocked.  “It had to be wrong.”
The edgy tension of the students clung to the whole of the school, followed them through the corridors to the classrooms, even the Great Hall where everyone was cramming last minute studying in between distracted bites.  The professors were on edge, seen quietly talking with the official proctors who seemed particularly interested with Professor Opacre, the only teacher whose students had been taught under someone without magic and whose smiles seemed a little more forced nowadays.  He saw the way Lest had pulled aside the proctors, questioning them while they tried to hide their nervousness behind their official titles and searches for cheating.
“I’ve asked.”  If by asked, he actually meant more like threatened and came away with a few mutual scorch marks.  “Something happened at the dance but beyond that, I’ve got no clue.  He just mutters something about Harry wanting space and - ” He paused, remembering Malfoy’s warning to not leave Harry alone with Opacre at all.
“As long as you need to,” Wainscott said.  She shook her head at Harry’s resulting grimace.  “This is a unique situation, Harry.  We cannot predict what may happen further down the road unless we document what we observe and begin to establish baselines for the both of you.  We cannot afford to be careless, moreso if you wish to continue to live as autonomously as possible.”
“Keep to your magic, wizard, and let me do my work,” she said stiffly and stalked out of the room before he could say anything else.
“Harry,” Hermione said slowly, like a parent explaining something difficult to a child, “you just blanked out for three minutes, not responding to us even though we were practically shouting your name!”  The bushy-haired girl frowned deeply, her brown eyes looking anxiously at him.  “There might something wrong with you, you should really - ”
“Is there a reason you’re sitting in my seat, brother dearest?” the female vampire asked serenely as she crossed the room over to her desk, dropping the bundle of papers gently onto the cherry wood. She more carefully placed the bag with the vials - potions? - in the middle of the desk, on top of a book. She then tilted her head calmly at the unruffled figure of her brother.
“Just surrender, Harry!” squeaked the man as he stumbled and fumbled with his wand.  “Make this easier for yourself!”
“No,” Black cut back, back straight and certainty solidifying in his eyes, staring down the face of the vampire’s anger. “I’m listening to them.  Maybe you should give it a try.”
"No, no," Professor Opacre replied reassuringly. As the class started to relax, she grinned and continued. "Only
Marylin chuckled as she closed another trunk.  “When does anyone care how they may present themselves?”  She looked around, decided to leave everything for later, and turned to face her bemused brother.  She winked and mouthed something as she walked closer.
Hermione cut in before Harry could reply. “We tried to make him go in the morning but you know how he is, he’s so stubborn. But as soon as he finishes dinner, we’ll make sure he goes straight up there.”
“There was no need to be violent,” he said, a touch of irritation in his voice.  She saw him glance back into the crowd and his jaw clench.
Memories began to flood him.  A cold voice, a cold smile, a cold threat.  A boy – no, a teenager – who had held them against the walls of his bedroom.  Cold blue eyes that had pinned him.  Eyes that blazed with an icy fire.  Dark blue eyes that stared at him whenever he raised a hand towards the boy.
’  For some reason, he felt as if they weren’t but he didn’t know why.  He continued to look at her, studying at her.  ‘
Jonas made it to the side of the chair before he saw the tension in the adolescent’s shoulders, the way they quivered beneath the standard issued pajamas Poppy briskly changed them into each day.
Swallowing, he concentrated on the room before he lost his control.  Marylin was chattering on about something – he couldn’t focus enough to know what she was saying – and he swallowed again, desperately hoping she didn’t notice him being so uncontrolled.  As she paused for breath, he hastily murmured something about seeing how much progress there was.  At least, that’s what he hoped he managed to say.
Sirius shifted into his dog form the moment it was all packed, out the door while Remus fumbled with his cloak, intent on getting to Hogwarts and seeing his godson.
"Anyway," she continued, smiling, "I'm sure you've all noticed my darling baby brother standing behind me giving me looks of death. He'll actually be helping us with said one-of-a-kind event."
“I’ll check into it, then,” she said.  He nodded slowly and she touched his hand, watching his eyes focus as he blinked at her.  “In the mean time, is there anything else we can do?  Anything you want to tell us?”
“Ron!” Hermione said reprovingly even though she obviously didn’t like the idea any more than him.  “Don’t make comments like that!  Dumbledore is just trying to get us to work together and not be as biased as we are.  He just wants to help, that’s all.”
“They are fine,” Smethwyck explained as he turned back to the adults, folding his arms.  He hesitated and then sighed.  “The fluctuations we had seen from before are completely gone now.  What you are seeing is Mr. Potter’s magical field adjusting and I am merely providing some guidance to lessen any discomfort or inconvenience.”  He took a long pause and then continued carefully, “I can’t be completely certain without running a few more tests but I suspect that what is happening is that the magic is settling in to its new parameters.”
They collapsed, one barely catching itself on its hands and knees with the other down on the ground, still without a sound.
“Harry’s too good of a child,” she sniffed. “Draco might be telling him things but I doubt he’ll be set against you by his words alone. From what I’ve seen, Harry doesn’t care much for rumors or reputations.” She was silent and then continued in a quiet voice. “I never wondered why. Suppose it kind of makes sense now…”
Harry stared for a long while at his hand on the doorknob, at the possibilities that awaited beyond it.
“It’s just three more,” Ron coughed, straightening up and continuing to shift his tired feet.  “Three more and then we’ll have the professors - ”
Harry blinked and inhaled sharply as he realized exactly how close the other teenager was.  He fought the urge to take several steps back and raised his eyes, only to feel his face heat as he noticed Draco taking similar notice of his own outfit.
This was a chapter that was originally titled "New Normal" and then decided to be two chapters.  So you'll get another update on Friday. :) Feel free to check out my writing twitter @greensaysk where I scream into the ether about the struggles of trying to get this story to obey my careful outline.
“I’m up,” growled Harry as he stood up from his bed.  Ron watched as the smaller boy walked to his trunk and pulled out the Gryffindor Quidditch robes.
He had arrived a few minutes before four, thinking he would apologize again for his strange request, agree to whatever she provided first and make any necessary modifications later on his own.
Jordan raised a hand to his mouth, trying to stifle a yawn as his fraternal twin, Jacob Taine, grumbled, “The least our cousins can do is supply us with
Then he scowled as he once again remembered how the situation came to be. Dark blue eyes followed his hand as he slowly raised it off the other’s shoulder, brow furrowing as fingers bent…
“Sirius is Harry’s godfather, Lest,” Dumbledore spoke carefully and from the corner of his eye Remus saw him move to the doorway behind his armchair and beckon them with one hand.  “He has every right to see.”
Harry tried to reconcile the vampire professor who had a smile for everyone, patted his head and teased him, helped him with his outfit with a strange joy with the war-motivated picture Draco was giving him and couldn’t grasp it.
“Oh,” Alicia said, blinking, her hurt fading away in her surprise.  Her eyes widened even more and she nervously glanced over at the exit Lest had left through.  “Oh!  I didn’t offend him, did I?  I mean, I didn’t know, are they - ”
“What the hell did you need that blasted stuff for?” Lest asked, warily eyeing the items in her hands.
“We all know who’s the rodent here, Ferret,” Hermione snapped, holding onto Ron’s other arm.  Malfoy’s smirk faded from his face, replaced by a dark look.  Fortunately – or unfortunately, considering – the door to the Potions classroom opened.  Malfoy threw them a scowl before he swept into the Potions lab with his fellow Slytherins.
His heart stuttered in his chest and instinct drove him as he barged in, his wand in his hand, not knowing which spell to cast first, a patronous to summon help, a shield to protect, something to cure whatever misfortune had fallen upon –
A punch flew back at Draco and the Slytherin narrowly avoided it, his feet moving quickly to the other side as he sent back a blasting spell.  Lest stumbled as Draco dove forward, his wand slashing towards him.  It hit him in the shoulder, leaving a slight tear in the fabric as Lest danced back, baring his teeth again.
:: he said, still wondering about the vampire question.  Then he scowled slightly as another piece of his memory came to him, banishing away his curiosity.  ::
He looked up from staring at his hands, where he idly traced the barely there Quidditch calluses.  He scarcely remembered the last time he rode his broomstick.  Ron had to have been there.  They hadn’t made it to the Quidditch final this year but Ron had scolded him when the Bludger almost clipped him, throwing an arm around his shoulders and vigorously rubbing his knuckles atop his head.
Harry could feel the struggle and he shuddered because it was so much worse now, knowing that feeling was just a small part of him locked away and –
"Boys, I'm going to throw each of you in a corner if you don't behave," Professor Opacre muttered, sending her brother and Draco a stern look each. They glared but thankfully stayed silent. She sighed and turned back to the alarmed class, raising her hands in a placating manner.
She pulled the one on the left to her, studied it as she anticipated what would happen if she were to turn this one in.  And then she pulled the one on the right to her.
Then there was Lest and Professor Opacre, darting and lunging, kicking and throwing swift punches with a man who dodged them seemingly effortlessly.  Lest kept flicking his hands out and Professor Opacre held her hand out between them every time the man swept towards them, making him dance back.  They were silent and quick but their faces were tight and focused on something beyond their physical attacks.
“He’s a fucking vampire,” Sirius muttered into his glass, grimly looking into the fireplace as he slouched on the floor with his back to the couch.  “And he’s shown how damn capable he is with messing with people’s heads, how do we know who he’s messed with?”
"Bullshit," Lest said flatly, cutting Qye off, staring at him in disbelief.  "Say what you like, you can't say that.  You can't hide from fact and try to dismiss the knowledge that you are - ”
His hands interlocked and his eyes closed, reliving the way they had slid in so comfortably with Draco’s long and welcoming fingers.
Chuckling quietly, Malfoy dropped his knee and moved closer.  “Yeah, it’s the last thing and then we can leave.”  He pushed forward another scrap of parchment.  “I’ve outlined what should be in your conclusion.  All you have to do is find the words for everything I’ve written.”
“Oh, I’ll get you there in time,” she said cheerfully, dropping a hand on his shoulder and trying to guide him to the chair at her desk.  “Now that I have a definite color scheme, it’s all a matter of application and - ”
“Are you okay, Harry?” he asked worriedly and was unprepared for Qye’s eyes to snap up and angrily stare at him.
“Right,” Seamus said and Harry was glad that he broke the stifling silence.  “Anyway, that doesn’t mean they don’t drink human blood.  I bet it tastes better to them anyway.  What’s to stop her from putting us in detention and sucking our blood to her little fangs’ content?”  Dean snorted.
Sighing, he turned and walked towards the front door, ready to tell his escort that he was ready to leave.  Then he stopped.
After asking his question, Professor Opacre had immediately run off to fetch the Nurse and what proceeded had to be the most confusing two hours of his life.
“I’m fine,” Qye snapped irritably, finally sitting up and swinging around to drop his feet on the ground while the blood in his head rushed back down.  He kept his narrowed glare on the man until he dropped his wand and took a step back again.  “I did your stupid stretches and holds like you told me to, I told you I’m fine.  It’s not me you should be - ”  He snapped his mouth shut, glancing over to the other bed where Harry had his eyes closed again.  When he looked back at the Healer, his irritation spiked as he saw the man giving him a sympathetic look.
"He'd better be okay or Mother will cry when she's seen what I've done to you," a feminine voice hissed a little further off. His head buzzed and he looked over his shoulder.
Breakfast passed in relative normalcy if you could call Seamus winking at Harry every five minutes normal.  The poor Gryffindor boy had to refrain from beating his head against the table out of frustration because neither Seamus nor Dean were explaining what they were talking about.  Of course, the desire to knock himself unconscious also could have been because Qye had flipped through his memories and found a particular tune that annoyed Harry to no end.
“I checked you that day, Mr. Potter,” Pomfrey frowned. “It was odd because it had seemed like you had fully recovered.” She gave a disapproving look and he looked back defensively. Hey, he couldn’t be blamed for something he didn’t remember! “I told you to stay in the Infirmary because I was worried about a relapse – which I turned out to be correct in – but you left either way.” She furrowed her eyebrows. “I do remember you acting a little odd. If you’re right about the fever making you delirious enough so you couldn’t remember, then it most likely also affected your personality. But if your fever had been that strong then it should have shown up on my spell.”
“What about legibility?” she questioned as she opened the folder.  “I had to have Abbie tell me you actually wrote ‘help me’ and not go to hell or something.  Honestly, I’ve seen first years with better handwriting.”
,’ she thought absently.  Then she frowned.  Harry was in Gryffindor.  And although he was apt at spells, he was in no ways at all like his studious friend.  She sighed and placed her elbows on her desk, rubbing her temples.
you?” Draco snarled, eyes flashing at the vampire.  Lest took a step towards him and Harry fired off another jet of green sparks at them.
She crossed her arms and looked patiently at her class.  For a few minutes, the students just looked at each other in confusion and she saw that some were once again eyeing her warily.  She sighed mentally.
By the time we reached the chamber, Lucius And Draco were locked in a wizard's dual, trading spells, Draco didn't care how much Lucius hurt him, all he cared about was protecting You.
Maybe this was some kinda sick dark twisted nightmare? Maybe he fell asleep waiting for his detention. Maybe just a dream playing tricks on him.
"That's not All Harry, I found out last week she's pregnant with my child, you're getting another cousin." He revealed with a grin.
"This meatloaf is amazing!" He exclaimed. "even the food at our school feasts can't compare to this." He added.
Now he'd never get to see Ron or Hermione ever again. And now he'll never get the chance to get up the courage to tell Draco how he really secretly felt. Would never get the chance to ask him out.
When he found none. Draco poured a bigger drizzle over Harry's chest. Then bending over Draco runs the tip of his tongue slowly, over the gravy trail as his hand drizzles more gravy, as the tip of his tongue follows the trail.
Lucius used a key to pull Harry  free of the chains, and pulls Harry from the room by the hair to another room.
Hermione was once again pregnant as she was walking with her daughter to Ollivanders, Borgin and Burks, Madam Malkins  and all.
"So, Neville wanna play wizard's chess?" Hermione suggested pointing towards a table where a chess board sat onna table.
Going home he lays down and tries to sleep needing to rest his sore muscles, but the cold empty space beside him keeps him wide awake, missing the feel of having Harry there.
He sits in a chair beside the bed touching Draco's arm whispering in his ears, begging him to wake up every now and then. Kissing his forehead as he sat there.
The name Celina was a latin name meaning strong warrior and they felt that their little girl really was a warrior cause of her fighting spirit.
"I know the way i treat you it probably seems like it don't it..but the truth...I'm just frustrated cause I can't tell you what I really wish I could."
Harry pulls Draco into the pet store, and together they play with all the baby animals. But Harry noticed Draco playing exclusively with the puppy in the display area.
Harry lay in his bed thinking over the events of the day, the graduation, the knowledge that September 1st would no longer be an important date for him, and the marriage.
“Sit Harry, can I offer you a drink, we got you tea, coffee, pumpkin juice, water, we also keep the cellar stocked with Butterbeer if you prefer that.”
Draco goes to library and hust as suspected their both elbows deep in a mountain of books as Hermione kept adding more to the mountain.
By now someone had to notice he was gone. Were they looking for him? Would anyone find him? He thought about Draco and wondered if Draco really cared. Was he trying to find him?
Ronald nods and disappeared into the kitchen with the items before coming back with a plate of toast with cheese whiz and caviar and handing it to his wife.
The two sit down at the table and play a couple rounds. She noticed Neville getting tired and felt nerves in her stomach.
Looking in the display Draco sees enchanted Gingerbread men that blinked, danced and walked around the display case waiting to be sold, peppermint flutes that had holes in it and whistled its enchanted notes. There was different spiked Eggnogs with a touch of Butterbeer added to some, firewhisky to others, and rum to the rest.
"Instead of code words cause of the gag, just hit the bell with your chin if this gets to be to much for you." Draco instructed Harry.
Draco stood and starts following Harry around trying to get Harry to tell him what was going on, but Harry continues to give him the silent treatment, as Harry collects all the babies laundry and places them in the hamper, cleans the toys off the living room floor and finally does the dishes.
Harry bites back any response trying his best not to display any emotion no matter how bad it burned.
Harry buys different pastas, and beans and vegetables with a few veggies getting vetoed by Harry when Draco suggests them.
"The reason Neville I've been nervous to try anything with you is I am into some kinky stuff that you might not be able to handle." Hermione explains.
Draco looks into his daughter's eyes, and could clearly see why Harry chose Narcissa for this one. She had his mother’s eyes.
Trying not to think about how nice that hand on his butt felt he very carefully moved the hand before getting out of bed to go find some breakfast. Finding the kitchen still bare he wakes Draco.
Both of them were happy, and in love. And they think over how different their lives could have been if the Goblet had chosen totally different partners for each of them. If that had happened they wouldn’t have fallen so hard in love with each other, and they wouldn’t have their four kids, nor would they have had the baby that was on the way now.
Draco takes a bite of the meat loaf and closes his eyes as his mouth is filled with the beautiful savory bliss of explosion in his mouth.
"So why aren't you at the dance with your friends? Surely you didn't just leave your girlfriend to dance alone?"
"you better come back to me Mr. Malfoy, you can't leave me now, we have so much left to do in our relationship you know.  Need a couple little Malfoys running around."
Harry nods "I didnt realize i was into you into last year when Barty crouch jr turned you into a ferret. "
Ice cold fear laced his heart, no how did he get back in here? His uncle suddenly was hitting him, as Harry whimpered out.
Together the two of them went into the hospital to see about getting a document from them saying that they were medically unable to have a child.
Harry flipped to the page and found thst the potion was in fact made for gay males and was irreversible. It gave men the inner parts needed to create a baby, including a womb and a bity canal that would allow a man to birth babies
Harry wondered where he went just as he heard the sound of a whistle, and a sharp terrible pain as the whip dug into his back.
At times Harry grew somewhat resentful of Draco having the apprenticeship, although Harry knew Draco believed they needed the money to care for four children, Harry hated that he was having to juggle parenting essentially on his own.
“Well carrying four means I’ll soon be forced to be on bed rest until they come, so I think we should start planning their nursery this month before I get to big to hold a brush or put cribs together, good thing our house has a lot of bedrooms.” Harry quipped.
Over the next few months Draco settled into a role of taking care of Harry, and the more he grew bigger, Draco started making sure Harry didn’t carry anything heavy, and took over putting together the  nursery room. Harry had picked out the cribs, but Draco was the one the painted the walls after having Harry choose from a set of swatches, and put the crib together.
Draco watched quietly for a while as Harry, fixed the green beans, pulled out the rolls and meatloaf, and set food filled plates on the table.
She loved her daughter so much, and having watched her fight so hard, Hermione was having a hard time accepting that she was actually fine, and was growing and thriving despite her premature start. She only slept when Neville would agree to take over watching over the baby in her place.
"Grimwauld? I think if that's an excellent idea, it would give us both privacy, and will keep any old death eaters who still Believe You Know Who's ways from trying to harm you."
Celina had grown into a beautiful dark brown haired, green eyed dare devil of a woman. She was always doing crazy stunts, nothing about Celina was lady like no matter how much Hermione would try to teach her.
"How about we head up to bed, Snape would love to take points from you or give you detention." Draco suggested.
She starts kissing his neck, biting him as her body orgasmed, even after her orgasm she continues to move, increasing speed, letting wave after wave of orgasm hit her.
Hermione climbed onto his lap taking his cock in her hands she rubs his head against her clit, before finally sliding down burying him deep down inside her slick heat.
But after Snape had gotten bit by Nagini at Voldemort's Command, Harry had used everything he'd learned from Slughorn to force a snake bite cure down his throat. And rushed him to the hospital wing for further care from Pomfrey.
"Harry you have no family here that care much, mine are dicks...but we love each other. Run away with me. Lets leave England behind. I heard of a place where you who know who has no reach..and where together we can make a life for our child. Theres a wizarding school that we can transfer to in America." Draco tells Harry.
Scared that Draco might never wake. What if his heart just stopped? And never wakes up? Harry thought.
The station was packed, with the new law the number of kids going to Hogwarts this year were several times higher then in other years. Even some of the older witches and wizards had contributed to the numbers.
"What would be the fun in that? You boy, have been a thorn in my side since the day you were born, so I'm going to make your life a living hell before that little heart stops beating."
Harry goes and rents a room for the night. But sleep did not come easily as he tossed and turning replaying Dumbledore's words in his mind like a radio.
In another corner there was a small counter where a rosey cheeked pudgy old lady was selling baked  treats and Delicious smelling beverages where even from the door way Draco could smell incense of Nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger.
Harry kept his mouth shut even though he wanted so badly to scream. He felt blood running down his back as the cuts continued.
“I’d love that Harry, and you can be like another uncle to my kids, even though they already have real uncles and an Aunt.”
Harry, look's to Draco before saying. "You know this isn't so bad really. Being married to you. So far it's been nice actually."
He heard her gasp in pain as he broke through her hymn. He stills, to let her adjust to his girth. kissing her gently.
The babies were growing like weeds, and with each passing week the babies started looking more handsome and beautiful.  Now that Draco was helping Harry, their relationship was back to flourishing like it always had.
Hermione perused the daily prophet, going through the employment ads looking for something that would take her qualifications.
The blonde laughs "It'll take more than that to get rid of a Malfoy. You couldn't if you tried. My place is to be here with you."
He slips to sleep as Draco holds him close. The boy's arms seemingly warding off the nightmares that threatened Harry's sleep.
Inside there was enough room for 2000 passengers, each room was build with huge Master bedrooms with hot tubs in every room.
Harry paused concerned. They were Prefects had they ratted him out? Where they going to take points from Harry on Christmas?
When a Witch or Wizard reaches seventeen, By Law on their graduation day, All Wizards and Witches Must then become Married. Once Married you are required to produce at least 1 child, your marriage will be arranged by this goblet of fire. Each student will write their names on a slip of paper and submit them into the goblet. The Goblet will spit out a paper with both names matched together. This goblet had the ability to tell if a witch or wizard is gay or straight and will match you with someone that matches your sexuality. Once your name is called you will be expected to sign a marriage certificate, to legalize your marriage no vowels needed. I wish you all luck, please submit your names into the goblet now, we will start matching you when the names of all students have been submitted. Anyone who refuses to follow this law will be thrown to azkaban."
After days of attempting the spell Hermione succeeded in doing it first. Draco had to struggle not to laugh. But standing where Hermione had just been standing was now a fluffy brown Squirrel.
Harry felt his vision start to go in and out, as Lucius started stabbing the knife into Harry's body instead of cutting.
Harry felt his heart start pounding in his chest. Where was he? Where was Draco? Harry instantly starts to suspect Draco.
Harry enjoyed the sights but ihis heart was heavy, his heart weighed down but what he'd just given up.
But when the game was done they retired to a bed they'd share, but instead of  trying anything he went to sleep.
He watched Harry's back jerk at the sting, then hears a gasp of pleasure leave Harry's throat a sure sign Harry was fine.
“There you are Celine, your such a strong little girl.” Neville breathed looking over Hermione’s shoulder.
Harry's eyes finally adjust to the bright room and noticed everyone in the room had tears on their faces except Snape who looked worried but was not one to normally show displays of emotion.
"You stupid boy, do you really think I'm going to sit idley by and watch my son be forced to marry the likes of you? No see now the law is binding but now if you were to die, my son would then be free to marry another match. My son will never produce children with the filthy mudblood lover that killed my master." Lucius growled.
I'm going to stay in here with you, so go ahead and go back to sleep. I got your back Harry." He assured him.
Harry looks and their friends awkwardly, he wanted to take Draco home..but didn't wanna be rude to his friends either.
"I've known since 1st year I've wanted to be with you..and every year that passed I only found myself falling more for you."
Harry was almost screaming into Draco's shoulder as they continued to move until they both stiffen up.
In one corner there was beaitiful real pine Christmas trees, with oodles and ooddles of ornaments and other Christmas gadgets, and gizmos.
Draco was trying his best to stay positive through everything to keep Harry stress free and comfortable. At the same time he couldn’t wait for these babies to be born. He couldn’t wait to meet them. He couldn’t stop himself from wondering if they’d have a boy or a girl.
He couldn’t figure out why Harry was acting this way towards him, and often the blonde would find himself crying in frustration while at work cause he worried that his marriage was slowly starting to fall apart into shambles.
Time passes as Draco and Harry adjust to Draco’s new apprenticeship, leaving Harry to juggle four babies by himself. Some days Harry handled it with ease and even had dinner on the stove by the time Draco would come home, but some times taking care of four would cause Harry to have a full blown meltdown, on these days Molly would come over and give Harry a hand.
"I say just be yourself, and be honest and go for it. You're a good, guy and I'm sure she'll see that."
Instead of moving him she pulls a clean blanket and drapes it over the boy and wanders back to her duties.
Harry lay there quietly setting his teeth as the whip continued to hit him over and over again, blood falling more rapidly as the whip tore holes into his back.
"Not yet, do not come until I say you can." Hermione reminds him as they continue to thrust against each other.
They had sent Severus an owl awhile ago to tell him the news, and now that Severus was Harry’s uncle he had been placed on Harry’s emergency contact information. So while Draco had been pacing the mediwitch had paged Snape to let him know Harry was there.
"Nothing, I just love how happy this job seems to have made you, the way you talk about it is just amazing." Harry responds as he's feeding Sevy.
Draco sent the owl to Ollivander apologizing for the inconvenience, but taking care of his family had to  come first, and would no longer be able to continue to apprenticeship.
Neville was out in the greenhouse he had built in the backyard, weeding the herbal plants when Hermione walked in.
Ron grinned happily "I like that idea. Good you can start your training tomorrow if you would like."
Lucius finally flings a badly hurt Draco against the wall and was starting to form one of the unforgettable curses.
Draco watched the blurred figures exchange spells, still unable to give his body permission to pass out, every fiber in his being still set on protecting what was his.
Now that he knew what Dumbledore felt about him. He'd be Bloody well damn of he allowed himself to be a pawn any longer.
“I think I’m going to be just fine, I just did a pregnancy spell on my self, and my wand is showing that it’s positive. Draco, we are going to have a baby.” Harry grinned.
Still tossing and turning his thoughts turning into  nightmares all night of being found and sacrificed. Being led like animal to slaughter. He woke feeling gritty and tired as someone taps on his door.
Draco would have smiled. These guys sure loved Harry..and he felt it was awesome how they'd drop everything to go on a manhunt to find him. But he was too scared for any smile to appear.
After a few months everyone had slowly gotten used to their lives as married couples, and Harry and Draco had made a huge u-turn on their relationship since the night Harry had been kidnapped. One night Draco woke to the sound of Harry throwing up in the middle of the night in the bathroom.
"Yes im sure, i need to do this for me. I spent so long putting others first i need to step back and put myself first."
Draco smiled knowing Granger the library is where she would be. Possibly looking for some spell that would help them find Potter.
Draco was always thinking about what would have happened if he hadn’t of gotten to Harry in time, when Lucius had kidnapped Harry. What would have happened if Draco’s father had killed him?
And now he points his wand at Draco, using the cruciatus curse over and over listing to Draco scream.
Ron had been planning to ask Luna to marry him at the end of the graduation even before knowing about the goblet.
Dobby really confused puts the ball and gag in Harrys mouth uncovers Harry with a hand over his eyes. Then with a poof was gone.
Draco with one magic word made the hand cuffs fall off as the two of them move together as one, pounding against each other fast hard.
" Draco, please I really dont feel like..fighting with you right now..I was just heading back to my common room." He whispered.
He stole the death eaters owl, wrote a quick note and then grabbed the hands of his companions, they popped out of the cabin and to the outskirts of Malfoy Manor.
Harry grinned “Actually I have another idea in mind. I was planning on asking you to be my kids’ Godfather, and I’m going to ask Hermione to be their Godmother, I want my children to have both.”
He listens to her before adding a second finger shoving them both to the third knuckles, thrusting them in and out hard in fast.
Upon popping themselves to the field, they paid the muggles for the use of the campsite before setting up their tent in a chosen spot.
Harry rides slowly at first then curiously tries increasing the speed a bit and gives a louder cry as he feels the pleasure increase.
She took a leave from her job, to take good care of herself and allowed Neville to become the family supporter. Neville loved the smile that now had a place on his wife’s face, and he loved the idea of becoming a father.
“Draco he’s tough, he’s going to be just fine, if he can survive your father he can get through this.” Severus tries to reassure him.
I have decided it is finally time to hang up my hat, and retire, And I have spoken with The Minister Of Magic, I would like to offer you a Job as the new Hogwarts Headmaster.
Upon perusing the fridge and cabinets they found it basically almost bare bones. Some of which were in need of the trash.
“I actually came here today because I wanted my friends to be the first to know that I was two months pregnant with quadruplets.” Harry reveals.
"That's awesome Harry, we will happily help you with the baby when it arrives." The both say together.
Within hours the news was on every wizarding radio, sent to every household by daily prophet, even blasted on the muggle tvs.
Draco nods kisses Harry on the lips then turns Harry on his side best he could..then smacks Harry over the Buttocks with the flogger.
Would Draco come to him like Harry asked? Would Draco be turned off by Harry's crazy dark kink? Was Draco even serious about what had been said?
Harry was constantly having dreams about having the quads. Sometimes he’d see four boys running around the house, sometimes there were three boys being terrorized by their sister, once he saw two of each together. But in every dream Harry was imagining there to be boys in the mix.
"Harry wait please, I'm not laughing At you, I was laughing because we have the same exact problem. I too am Gay, I didn't even attend the dance cause I couldn't stomach the idea of dancing with someone that wasn't a guy. Instead I told everyone else the dance was lame and that I'd rather go to bed early. But honestly i got so bored and lonely, when I seen my best friends Crabbe and Goyle having fun and I had nobody special to share the night with, so i was just out there wandering to try and keep mind off things and I ended up running into you of all people "
Harry wakes up and finds himself back in his old room at Pivate drive, his uncle was in his room leering at him.
"I dont wanna live in fear of deatheaters killing our child or killing the nan that im in love with..as for me..my family is a bunch of assholes."
Draco had to agree though, he was a chubby little boy with plump cheeks and little tufts of that Weasley red hair.
Harry returns his attention to Draco's length licking and sucking him again until he's once again putty under him.
Hermione speaks first.. "my parents are muggles, and supportive..of my decisions, if you are willing to accept company Id love to go with you."
Harry felt his mind racing trying to figure out how to approach this. If he went in there and told him now he might think he was making fun of him.
They started going longer in between sexual acts and stopped testing. Hermione had cried when she had decided to stop trying.
Tanner was a wild red headed child, he loved to pull pranks and was always getting into some kind of trouble, but was Ron and Luna’s only child.
Harry nervously wondered where they were being taken, as the goblet continued to send out matches one by one.
Draco was careful as he continues to hit Harry with the whip that it only grazed his butt, to make sure he didn't accidentally hurt the child Harry carried inside him. Their child.
Draco used his love for Harry to stay strong, and remembered what Snape taught him, he closed his mouth and sent a nonverbal spell instead.
None too soon the door opens and the nurse walks in with Snape and Harry's friends Ron and Hermione.
"Good evening to All, you have been summoned for an announcement.  Tonight for the first time, we will be allowing interested Students to stay up till midnight if they so choose to, in order to celebrate the coming of the new year.
"That worthless excuse of a mother of yours, choose to help the other side instead of standing with me to help our master..she had to die for that betrayal." Lucius responded.
Neville though, lay awake even though he pretended to sleep. He felt an uncomfortable tightness in his pajamas, he'd never told anyone before that he'd always had hidden  feelings for Hermione. Always desired her. Had always wanted to ask her out while at school but had been too scared to try. And now having her laying so close beside him, legally his...his body ached to hold her, to touch her and claim her as his own.
A large owl with a letter flies in with a letter for Harry. Harry picks it up, opening the letter he reads.
To find out where heccxwent Draco knew he would need to investigate why Harry left in the first place.
Of the good food There was a slab of frozen ground beef,  a few cans of beans, and vegetables, tomato sauce and ketchup, flour, breadcrumbs and an onion.
Ron wakes before she does, leaves her a note on the pillow and appearated to Diagon Alley to start searching for him a new job.
He would hold her when ever she was worried or nervous and tell her everything was going to be okay, and that their daughter was strong and would flourish now, that there was nothing to worry about now, that it was okay for her to rest while he watched.
The old man’s white mustache swung as he read. After a moment, he put his elbows on his desk and stared at Draco. The blond kept a neutral face.
Draco took a seat in front of him, looking for his eyes. But the brunet was looking everywhere but him. In the middle of a cold silence, Draco prepared two cups of coffee. He put one cup next to Harry, and they drank without talking. Trying to act normal, he took a parchment and a quill from his briefcase and started to write. Harry did the same.
Draco didn’t get it. How could Potter be so willing to go? To DIE? He had risked his own life so Potter could keep his. So many people had done the same, so the stupid gryffindor could live. And, in spite of it, Harry still was willing to go.
“I can’t believe he lost it! We worked on it all week.” Harry’s voice showed how annoyed he was, Draco didn’t blame him. “Thanks, anyways.”
“Who was the one talking about getting caught out of guard and saving himself?” Draco flushed, smiling kind of silly. For some reason, Harry had a weird look in his eyes. “Really, do you know how to use it? It’s muggle.”
“I didn’t plan on doing it, all I knew was that I didn’t want you to leave. I was desperate to make you stay, but you were so willing to go. It seemed to me that, if I didn’t do it then, then I might never get the chance. Nobody knew anything of you for so long, Harry, and every day I wondered if you were alive or if something had gone wrong.” His voice was shacking, and his eyes were filled with water. It was the first time he told anyone about it. “And then I finally saw you, you were alive! But you were leaving again.” he paused for a moment, steading his voice. “I know I was a prat and I treated you like shit, but… something changed. I don’t know when or how. Maybe it always was like that, and I didn’t see it until it punched me in the face.” Harry was incredibly close at that point, he could
But after thinking over what happened. He'd come to the conclusion he had no reason to be scared of Draco. If Draco would risk his life for him then he'd never hurt him. The months he'd bathed and cared for him Harry had found the love he'd felt for his husband since childhood fill him up.
What a kiss. Harry smiled, the kiss had been nice and had felt pretty good. He hoped Draco would kiss him again in the future. Maybe it would help make them more comfortable. He knew they only had a limited amount of time to try and get comfortable with things. And hoped that eventually he'd be able to grow to trust Draco and care for him the way a husband should.
He then licks and kisses over Harry's belly. His tongue soon finds Harry's dick..and his tongue teases at the bow before using his hands to spread Harry's ass cheeks.
Harry starts to wish the wizard would just make this quick and just kill him. Anything to make the pain stop.
Harry winced a bit before kissing Draco deeply. Going still, taking the time to kiss and touch the rest of Draco's body.
After years of the abuse at home, after the battle the truth about Vernon had finally come out. He was not a muggle, like everyone believed but a loyal Voldemort supporter that had been manipulating Petunia for years with the Imperious curse. The Ministry had caught him and sent him to Azkaban when they'd been escorted to the safe house, and another wizard had recognized him for what he was.
And now that he knew these things Staying at Hogwarts would be Folly. As Albus would force him to do things  anyway.
The happiness they had now would never have happened. Draco shivered and held his husband close to him, content to have this wonderful wizard go from being the young boy he was trained to hate, to being the man he would love and protect with his last breath.
Finally everyone was seated and waiting with baited breath. As the minister stood and approached the Goblet, where the first slip of paper was waiting to name the first arranged marriage.
Hermione was both offended and relieved. Thinking maybe he had no attraction to her, not enough to attempt it, but yet relieved cause she didn't feel she was ready for that step yet either. They had six months. Why rush it. It would happen when they were both ready to try. She fell asleep quietly.
Harry Curled up as the unshed tears unleashed and he cries into his pillow.he had loved Hogwarts, had loved his friends loved Albus but it had been an act. He was just a pawn playing a game  that was unaware the game was being played.
Where they stumble into bed and clothes fly to the floor and Draco pounds him into the mattress before they cuddle up in each other's arms and succumb to sleep.
Draco greatly enjoyed himself as Ollivander guided Draco’s hands a few times in the process so that Draco could learn how to do it by doing it with his own hands.
They worked together to pick out leashes, and collars for their new puppies along with the food, and toys they'd need.
He swallows as he watched the death eater wander over towards the wall where dozens of ugly looking tools hung menacingly.
"Well after Draco noticed you were missing, he came and got us asking us for our help. And we searched for you for days, Draco interrogated every death eater he knew looking for you. When he found out his father had you. He turned a shade of white that I've never seen any person wear before.
“I bet Nathan will the smartiest wizard at school, just like you were the smartest witch.” Neville would beam.
It seemed like a perfectly ordinary day..as Harry wanders the hall after a particularly nasty day in potions.
Draco laid down the whip and picks up the lube off the rock, taking some in his hand he gently inserts a finger inside Harry's ass, and gently strokes him listening to the delightful sound of him.
Harry hurried up to his room and pocketed his wand, his cloak. Only taking the items he could carry or couldn't part with. Harry left a note telling Ron he could have the rest. That he'd write to him but only once settled.
Another time she climbed all the way up to the top of the playground’s slide, and jumped from there to the ground. And was unscathed upon landing.
"I did i finally got it. Now im pretty sure you can do it too. Its not that hard. You have to focus you can't let anything distract you."
Harry nods as the mediwitch goes over the do’s and don’ts of taking care of himself. When the words the witch used suddenly registered in Draco’s mind.
"Lucius, your father has him...I know cause I helped him carry him to his dungeon." Atticus responded.
Harry nodded thinking about the baby and the likly hood of Voldemort getting to it. The Dursleys would never accept the baby, and Lucius would train the child to be a death eater and Voldemort follower. Harry knew Draco was right.
“Of course Harry, if that ever happened, I know I for one will personally take care of them for you.” Hermione agreed.
Tonight though Draco leaned over and gently captured Harry's lips with his own. Harry leaned into it kissing back.
The boys come together in one breath. With what strength he had Harry used magic to redress them both. And laid down beside Draco grinning stupidly as he holds him sleepily.
Hermione showed surprise. That actually didn't sound bad at all. A herbalist sounded like it would be up his alley, and would pay decently.
He smirked at Draco, then picks his wand from his pocket, he flicked his wand silently once before laying it down.
To Harry’s surprise he sees Dudley entering the platform, behind him trailed a young woman and three little boys.
Nurse turns to them and ssys "well it appears Mr. Malfoy is fully recovered and fine to go home but let us know if you find any complications."
The duo nods "and even if you decide to marry him..we will support you every step of the way. And if he hurts you we'll both kick his ass."
Harry sighed as Ana was having a tantrum in her high chair while her twin brother Alex ran around the living room naked evading Harry's many attemots to get pants on him.
He wanders into the nursery, and feeds, burps, and changes each of them before putting them back down to sleep.
Harry slid out of bed and got dressed. The two of them ate a quick breakfast of eggs and sausage before shouldering the tent and sleeping bags before heading out.
Marylin narrowed her eyes at him, blue eyes looking searchingly at his averted eyes. “And what reasons are those, exactly, Lest?”
“Fell out of bed,” he said weakly as he gingerly stood up in his over sized blue-striped hand-me-down pajamas. Harry forced a sheepish smile at them as he dropped his hand.
The Dark Lord smiled as the vampires and wizards shifted on their feet.  “Lord Voldemort always delivers.”
“Them,” he heard Libby muse and take another sip.  He dropped his hand from his eyes and blinked to bring the brunette into focus.  She had the file open again and he saw that she had conjured a new section, a quill in hand already swirling across the paper.
Harry tried, his hands gripping his arms tight as he listened to the broken breaths in between the heavy silence of the other boy.
In the fireplace, the embers struggled against the growing coldness.  But just before they were swallowed up, they gave one last, large burst of heat and a new flame was born to replace it.
There was a silence as he warily studied the Mind-Healer, reassessing his opinion that her connection with Smethwyck instead of her competence brought her to them.  He fought again the urge to reach out to Harry to get his opinion of her.
“Damn it, Potter,” Malfoy growled, his pale eyes darkening with frustration, “I don’t think I deserve this.  Yes, I was a jerk to your friends but you know as well as I that they started it and I could give a hippogriff’s arse if that made me sound childish.  I don’t like being blamed for something that wasn’t entirely my fault.”
Dean looked uncomfortable but Seamus had no problems speaking up.  “That’s the point, mate,” he said quickly, once again glancing at the DADA teacher.  “She’s a
He could feel the gentle pressure of Draco’s lips against his, his breath against his mouth as they hesitantly moved against each other.  The heat of his body burned, the fingers grasping his hip, his palm flush against his back.  The feel of his chest pressed against his as Draco moved closer to dip his head, tracing the edges of his mouth tenderly, moving to his jaw as the pressure alternated while Harry panted softly.  His breath quickened as Draco dove again, straight for his lips, and he couldn’t help but arch his back, his own fingers tangling in Draco’s hair, come undone and brushing against his face.  Merlin only knew what his own hair looked like.
She grinned and picked up a mirror to hold in front of him.  “In the meantime, let’s see what tonight brings, huh?”
“Um…yeah,” the smaller boy mumbled, casting his green eyes down.  “I guess a dream must have woken me up.”  Inside his head, he was mentally snarling at a smirking Qye.
He struggled to find an answer, something other than the fact that the vampire was in fact a liar and a bastard to do this to someone he cared about.
“And how well that worked for you,” Lord Voldemort smiled mockingly as he sat at the head of the table.  One of the vampires bared his fangs but quickly bowed his head when another raised her hand.
His ring lay forgotten on the table as he quickly left for the teacher’s lounge, hand tight on the letter and thoughts of a silent green-eyed teenager on his mind.
He heard the woman mumble something under her breath and his ears perked up as he caught a word of Swedish.  Often times, he heard her speaking to herself but could never place the language but that was clearly Swedish.
, Lest!  And in the space of ten minutes, you’ve probably ruined all my work and caused enduring all those weeks of being glared at, whispered against, and generally living in the most unsociable place in the world for me pointless!”  Letting out a frustrated shout, she collapsed into the nearest armchair and scowled heavily at him.  “I think I earned the right to hit you.”
“Not at all, Harry!” Professor Opacre said cheerfully, patting him on the back before clasping her hands behind her.  “Like I said, I already have some ideas.  Just make sure to be here early tomorrow, say around four?”
"Ha, right," she replied sarcastically, straightening the battered wizarding chess piece. "And be known as the professor that brought down Hogwarts by letting you two have a petty fight? Don't think so." She shuddered as she imagined the chaos that would've happened.
“That’s not - ” Hermione stopped and took a deep breath. “We worry about you, Harry.” Her soft brown eyes looked gently into his. “We’re always here for you, Harry, when you want to talk, about anything. You don’t have to keep anything from us.”
“I think cousin Jacob needs to learn to hold his tongue more,” a new, cold voice came from the doorway of the room.
“It’s true,” Jacob piped up and Jordan groaned, wanting to hit his idiot twin.  Jacob didn’t seem to notice his warning look and continued, grinning slightly.  “Those Dazains are good and whipped, cousin.  No sweat.”
The wind came in from the window next to her desk and the letter shifted slightly, revealing the words.
“It’s alright, Soror,” her brother said quietly, smiling mirthlessly.  “I would have said the same thing in her place.  Still…don’t forget yourself as well, Saira.  I won’t go easy on you if I have to remind you why I’m in charge.”  He stared at her with his winter-like eyes until she looked down.
“With all due respect,” Harry said, voice stiff, “I don’t think it’s any of your business.  Excuse me.”  He tried to move past the vampire and gave a sharp look when Lest took a step in front of him.
“It doesn’t really matter,” interrupted Lest flatly, his eyes narrowed and unwavering. “We’re bonded, there’s nothing to be done there.  They have no say.”
In a blink, Harry felt his air cut off and pain in his back as he was shoved unmercifully against the tree.
“Ignore him,” he muttered to his struggling friend.  “We’ll just lose points and that’ll just make him ecstatic.”
Neville looked helplessly around him and finally, after Hermione patted him on the shoulder with a smile on her face, swallowed and continued. "But he said Hermione was going to use a Tickling Charm and she didn't even say anything and he didn't even
He raised his hand and idly rubbed the wrist Malfoy had grabbed.  It still felt slightly warm from the touch.  ‘
“Bet they taste sweet,” murmured a female vampire, flicking her hand and making the woman wince.  “How about we leave you last so we can tell you?”
He had a moment’s thought as he had watched the tiny owl streak away if he should have sent something to Sirius as well.  But he remembered McGonagall saying the Headmaster would be contacting the families, pale and stiff and avoiding their eyes as she hurried them all to the train station, distractedly fending off their questions and demands to find Harry.
“Well?” he asked wearily as the vampire woman straightened up, twirling her pencil and looking at him contemplatively.  Merlin, he hoped that didn’t mean another outfit change.
Lest met his gaze coolly and Sirius wished once again that Dumbledore had not disarmed him while he stood in shock at the sight of two young men lying unconscious where there should only be his godson, that he had not bound Sirius in magic and refused to let go until he agreed to listen after the vampire bluntly stated their bond as soon as Sirius stumbled back into the sitting room.
As he rubbed the back of his head and glared at her, she half-shouted, “Hélène, you sound like a child instead of the adult you’re supposed to be, Lest!
Sighing, he ran a hand through his hair as he walked over to the loose floorboard.  Kneeling down, he lifted it up and looked down into it.  Like he had guessed, he didn’t leave anything behind.  Frowning, he replaced the floorboard.  Why had he come back if he hadn’t left anything?  Letting out a frustrated breath, he turned and quickly left the room without a backwards glance.
Harry added in seven forget-me-nots and slowly stirred clockwise, frowning as the golden color deepened to a dark violet.
“Custom and protocol dictate that if a minor is elected to be a Carus Noctivagus, said minor's parents or guardians must give consent so that the vampire’s family can make legal arrangements for their well-being,” Marylin explained carefully.  She gestured to the papers on the table, carefully arranged as if ready for debate.  “Since his parents were dead and the Dursleys didn’t seem to care, Lest didn't consider them real guardians and, well…we worked around that.  To make sure no one could question that Lest had rights to protecting and providing for him.”
Hermione nodded, pausing in the middle of the room. Lest had already moved to stand on the right side of the classroom, lounging against the pushed back desks. When Professor Opacre beckoned him, he straightened up and moved to the middle, stopping a fair distance away from Hermione. He quirked an eyebrow down at her and Harry couldn't help but feel a tinge of pride when she defiantly raised her chin at him. It might've looked ridiculous to the others, Hermione's small form against Lest's tall stature, but to him, it looked like a rather even fight.
The class scrambled for the ingredients, looking up at the instructions on the board constantly.  As Harry chopped up his spider legs, he wondered about the potion.
Before she could hurry her brother away, Lavendar Brown, Parvati and Padma Patil and Alicia Spinnet popped in front of them.
Inside his head, Jonas was quietly making his apologies to all the patients he had put on hold and the Healers he had transferred some to so that he could take on the case.  He had a feeling he wasn’t returning to St. Mungo’s for the foreseeable future.
It was a little comment.  But it was enough to break his temper.  He immediately rounded on her, his green eyes flashing with anger.
The man turned to look at him and the moonlight from the windows shone enough for Vernon to see his cruel, mocking smile.
“You scared us all so much, Harry,” Hermione whispered, her slightly smaller hand tightening around his own. She blinked and his eyes widened slightly as he caught a trace of glimmer in them. “You were out of it for an entire day and then Pomfrey said we couldn’t see you and the way you just
“Really, I’m fine,” Harry said, catching the redhead’s headshake.  Ron looked him in the eye and he blinked.  Something seemed to have flashed in Harry’s eyes, something that looked to be behind the emotions, both fake and real.  Something that didn’t seem to belong to Harry.  He frowned.
The green-eyed boy jumped at the Slytherin’s sudden hiss and watched wide-eyed as the blonde extinguished the flames and hastily added the ice water to the frothing potion. Harry winced as he saw his potion turn to a dirty brown instead of the suave maroon it was supposed to be.
“…safe enough to move from the Infirmary to a private room because of the stabilization in the magical field,” Smethwyck was saying and Sirius had no idea what he meant, if the man even knew what he was saying.  Even in the wizarding world, Sirius had never heard of anything that split a person in two without repercussions.
