"You're lying," Harry deduced. "What happened?"
"What was she like?" Ron asked, looking over his shoulder at Draco and his mother. "Like, weird?"
Harry felt a horrible blush rise in his cheeks as he heard the snickers from his peers, especially Draco behind him.
He had received a note from McGonagall at breakfast that he was to attend the first of his tutorials with Malfoy that afternoon. He was still not permitted to leave the Hospital Wing until further notice so all rendezvous with the Slytherin had to be performed under the watch of Madame Pomfrey, who Harry is sure, would not be happy with this arrangement.
"It'll be weird having a normal year, won't it Harry," Ron addressed him, probably just to make his friend feel a little less left out.
"Oh, I have the Weasleys," Harry forced a smile as he straightened his collar. "They'll always be looking out for me."
He reentered the room shortly and stopped a few steps from the doorway, just staring at Harry.
"It looks cute on you," Harry smiled.
Hermione laughed. "Well, whose fault is that?"
Hagrid explained how he had been living in the Forbidden Forrest with his half-brother, Grawp, for most of the year after the Carrow's kicked him out of his hut just after Halloween. He said he had been doing what he could for the students but of course, found it hard to leave the grounds where he could do anything really useful.
"And another ten points to Hufflepuff from Smith!" Parker Williams shouted through the megaphone. Harry was beginning to become anxious. Hufflepuff was in the lead by fifty points and the Gryffindors were losing morale fast.
"I've tried, sure" Draco shrugged, leaning against the brick wall that his bed sat against. "I guess I don't have any truly happy memories."
"Sorry about that Harry, wasn't looking where I was going." Harry's gut turned and he looked up to see the one face in the Weasley family he felt the most guilty about. George Weasley used his wand to collect the contents of the box and lift it back up into his arms. Harry could see him open his mouth to say something but he dashed past him before he could say anything.
"Then maybe we should go to bed," Harry suggested.
"I'll miss you Hagrid," Harry smiled.
Harry knew the eyes of everyone were upon him, but he didn't care. He was furious at the insolence of Malfoy. No matter what he did, all that blonde git wanted to do was push him away.
When Harry caught up to his boyfriend, Draco reached out his hand and locked together only their little fingers, letting the momentum of walking swig their arms between them.
Harry saw something he never thought he'd see in Draco Malfoy's eyes. Tears, threatening to spill over but the blonde haired boy refused to let the weakness show.
Harry said nothing as Ron and Neville both ordered a mountain of food enthusiastically. Hermione left for the main crowd of students, almost regretting her offer.
"Are you okay, Potter?" Draco asked without looking up from the textbook.
Harry shot off to the centre of the pitch and did a loop, just to show off. He wasn't sure why, it just felt good to out-do Malfoy.
They trekked back up to the castle and after a quick shower, had gotten dressed in casual clothes to laze around the common room for the rest of the day.
Neither of them said anything. Harry avoided her gaze and looked out the large window. He realised that from the tower he could see the Quidditch pitch in the distance.
"Shove it, Potter," Draco ripped it off his head, his blonde hair sticking up at random, giving the effect of a rather grumpy, blonde hedgehog. "Granger practically forced it onto my head"
"I told you he's changed," Harry reminded him.
An image worthy of a feature role in one of Harry's nightmares. Draco Malfoy's perfectly sculpted face with bloodshot eyes and tear marks on his cheeks.
"Well then, what would be a fitting end to the Chosen One then?" Harry joked as he interlocked his fingers with Draco's. Draco looked around the room quickly, earning a laugh from Harry. "Everyone's outside, enjoying the weather. Well? I'm waiting."
"We were kids, Malfoy. Maybe it didn't feel like it for us, but we were."
"Great," McGonagall smiled, flicking her wand so a piece of paper on her desk folds neatly and slides into an envelope.
He glanced down the row to see Ron and Ginny arguing quietly over something at one end, and at the other Hermione waiting patiently for the ceremony to start.
"After dinner in the common room," Malfoy shook his head with a smile still lingering on his lips. "If you're late I'll hex all your socks to bite you."
"This is pitch is reserved for the Gryffindor team this afternoon!" Ron yelled. "So pack your stuff up and leave!"
"Well he shouldn't," Draco scoffed. "He's got that obnoxiously happy family. Getting along and caring for one another."
As they made there way up the first few stone steps of the castle, Draco made sure to take a peek at his reflection in the large windows, tossing his hair a little more.
"I can't wait for Christmas," Ron groaned. "Just so I don't have to think about conjuring spells or healing potions or sleeping curses for even just a little while."
"Oh," Ron laughed nervously.
"So you're on his side now?" Ron cried.
Harry nodded. But it wasn't long before he was thinking with his gut rather than his brain. When you live with your peers, there is not much opportunity for privacy and all Harry wanted to do was kiss Malfoy.
"Thank you for showing up Mr Potter," the Professor smiled at him as he took his seat next to Ron. "I'm sure Miss Granger will update you on what you've missed."
It seemed all too soon that a frantic Ernie Macmillan was running around telling everyone that they had to get ready or they'd be late, thankfully his boyfriend threw a pillow at him. However the damage had been done and Draco rubbed his eyes before sitting up off Harry, his hair messed up on the side he had been laying on.
"You kept it?"
The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way towards the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Regulus' voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamour, his sons had resumed the argument they had started n the car.
"I'm fine," Harry cut her off in a calm voice. He wasn't crazy. He knew that if nothing else. Madame Pomfrey didn't attempt to press the issue any further. Harry watched her as she made her way to the bad to his left, curtains drawn around it so visitors, and Harry, could not pry at the student inside.
Harry began his assent, the Firebolt catching up to the Nimbus 2001 soon enough. Park had her eyes fixed on the snitch which didn't seem to want to change directions anytime soon.
"- then Slytherin house will have gained an excellent student, won't it?. It doesn't matter to us, Reg. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose whatever house you want over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
"Then why are you coming to me?" Ron chuckled. "I don't know what I'm doing? Wait, have you got your eyes on someone?"
Harry could no longer recall what had happened from that point, he simply rolled onto his side and stared at the wall beyond Malfoy's still empty bed.
Harry refocused himself on labelling the parts of a Venomous Tentacula but his mind kept returning to Draco as well as Hermione's words at dinner. He didn't know what he and Draco were and he wasn't sure what he wanted them to be.
“Oh right, yes.” What was it, Harry wondered as he turned off the TV, that stopped him from being ‘Harry’ to Draco? He thought back to how Draco behaved in the kitchen. He would glance at Harry to check he was stirring right, then act triumphant every time he mastered a new skill. It felt like such a balancing act between tight nerves and a looser, more joyous version of Draco. He looked over at Draco, and saw someone too scared to call him by his name. It was like being in the presence of a skittish animal, always unsure of where danger lay.
“I can’t quite believe that you two haven’t come to blows yet.”
“Oh fuck,” she said, leaning forward. She ran her hand, cigarette dangling, down the side of Draco’s face. “It’s more than shagging, isn’t it?”
“But we normally go together.”
Judging by the way the tips of Malfoy’s ears went pink, Hermione had guessed correctly.
Draco stared at Harry’s hand, warm and brown. He couldn’t move.
She was silent for a while. “Sorry,” she said in the end. “I know you do.”
“Yeah, about that,” Ron said, shifting slightly. His eyes wouldn’t quite meet Harry’s. “You’ve got a lot of space here now, haven’t you?”
“I never thought you’d be the one correcting me.”
She shook her head. “No, that’s not what I mean. You can’t live there,” she said softly.
“I didn’t know that Ha– Potter was working on my case, too?”
"How did you know that? And what have you done to yourself?" Hermione asked, getting up to have a better look. "Harry!" she said once her diagnostic dot of green light had travelled up his body, darkening to a murky olive-green over his recently-healed collar bone. "You broke your clavicle today." She sounded shocked, but Harry didn't know why: he did have a habit of injuring himself.
"I don't see what's so special about it," he said, puzzled as to exactly why Malfoy felt he could advise Harry on his living arrangements, yet intrigued that Malfoy had been thinking about his home in this way.
“Er, yes?”
Before they could say anything else, the sofa shook as Anthony came to sit with them, while Ernie plonked himself onto one of the other sofas.
“Another experiment gone wrong?” Ron asked.
“A kitten?” Ron said. “Seriously?”
Sitting in one of the armchairs by the common room window, he watched Draco shuffling through a stack of cards, his lips moving as he read their contents aloud. He could think about other uses for that mouth, and shifted in his chair. They might not have the Room to use in the same way anymore - they kept finding Professors in it, who only wanted to ask them questions about their magic and how they’d repaired the room - but there were other options. His lips curled into a private smile at the thought of their plans for later. They never had been back to the Prefects’ bathroom, although he had returned to it in his imagination, many times. Even if Myrtle turned up, Harry didn’t think it would stop him.
"For Merlin's sake, Pansy, just leave it alone!"
Harry, taking his cue from Malfoy, ran and jumped into the bath. Heat enveloped him, a warmth that seemed to penetrate skin and muscle so that when Harry swam to join Malfoy, it was as though he’d left the strangeness of the moment out by the side of the bath.
“How about you? Did you make that teapot you were talking about?”
Draco could imagine Harry living in a tree. Although perhaps sleeping on the ground suited him better.
. You’re a working on new wizarding legislation.”
Harry nodded, not trusting himself to talk as well as move them around the ballroom. Draco stroked the back of Harry’s hand with his thumb, and instantly Harry’s legs began to wobble.
“If you’re free.”
“Harry!” Ron came bounding in, not bothering to knock. They might not be sharing a room any more, but he still treated the tiny space as if they were. He sat in Harry’s chair – the only one in the room – spinning it slightly from side to side as he talked. “You’d never guess who my mentor is. It’s only Savage. Kevin Savage! Isn’t that great?”
Draco stared at the apron. “I don’t…” The butterflies of unease turned lead in his stomach.
Draco was surprised that Potter had trusted him enough to make him copies. He almost said something, but he remained silent and nodded instead. Potter began to move towards the door, and Draco realised that he was leaving.
“Prettily?”
“That too,” Hermione said. “But mostly it’s about making lots of money.
"Don't move," Malfoy said, his voice quiet but with a slight wobble, a rising quiver which made Harry want to reach out and reassure him. Except everything hurt: his head throbbed and his limbs ached from the impact of the fall, but his eyes watered most from the waves of pain from his shoulder.
“You don’t need to worry about me.” Harry felt it was important to reassure Malfoy on this point. “I’m not going to try to do anything to you in the middle of the night.”
“Draco, I know you’re in there.”
“And I think you must be the only student who doesn’t.”
Harry stepped closer to him, his hand still wrapped around Malfoy’s arm. “I don’t care if it’s impossible. I like you.”
“I know.” George sighed. “Sometimes, though, it’s simply nice not to be lonely.” He stared down at his plate, then glanced over at the empty chair next to him.
Altheda didn’t fly up to his shoulder as she usually did, so Harry was forced to stand on his tip toes to pet her where she was perched, on top of the wardrobe. He’d ignored the rest of Draco’s owl names, but this one had stuck.
, to hexed brooms, to good old-fashioned cheating by pushing or shoving. The Chudley Cannons, Wimbourne Wasps, and Tutshill Tornadoes had managed the dubious of honour of being both winners and losers of a suspect match.
He had finally found his home, and it wasn’t the four walls of Grimmauld Place or even Draco sitting beside him. It was this new family that had grown up around him; it was all his friends, together.
At the end of the tour, the group following Draco dispersed, but not before there had been some hearty handshakes and one particularly vigorous back-pat. They left, smiling and laughing.
Harry just stared at her. He really didn’t remember her from school. Her scowl deepened. As he led his way to the Auror office, Harry sighed, thinking that at this point, his morning cup of coffee would have been most welcome.
“That sounds like a start. And I’ll talk to my mother about the portraits and see if there are any leads there.”
“I wanted to see what it was like. I wanted… not to think it was me, always holding myself back. And…”
As he left the room he heard Malfoy groan slightly, and the thud of Felix jumping down to the floor. Maybe Malfoy had got too hot, sitting there with a sleeping cat on his lap; he had started to look rather flushed towards the end of that little exchange.
Barnaby looked slightly mollified. “After that we lock them up again. The next time we open the box is at the beginning of the match.”
“Draco, I want to marry you because I want this ring-“ they both chuckled, “to mean that I won’t ever leave you. I promise you, you don’t have to let your father’s mistakes decide your life. And I know you’re scared but I’m here too and you don’t- Draco, you don’t have to go through it alone, I want to be there with you, and not just for now. Forever. Please. Marry me.”
“What are you hiding, Potter?”
It took Harry two days to answer Hermione’s letter, yet he still hadn’t been able to relax. Draco seemed to notice because he had been taking the kids more often and distracting them from bothering Harry too much. While Harry appreciated it, he knew he had to get over himself and get back to life.
“I will, dad.” James gave them a smile before pulling Lily upstairs.
to be Malfoy.
“You utter sap.” Draco smiled and held out a hand. A house-elf popped in to place something there before popping back out. Before Harry could question what it was, Draco stepped back and got down on one knee, opening the ring box between them. “I’ll say yes if you do.”
Draco narrowed his eyes, which only made Harry’s grin wider. “Oh, that’s
The sound of his truck coming up the drive and the kids’ welcoming voices pulled Harry from his half panic. Draco and Lily’s voices soon joined in and he stood, folding the letter and stuffing it back into the envelope. He had to tell Draco, but how? He had... he couldn’t...
“What? Oh! The kids must have hidden it again...” Harry spun in a circle before figuring that Albus and his pile of pillows could miss one for now. “I’ll just grab another one, hold on.”
“I’m here with my godson,” Potter said as soon as Draco had himself under control. “He was being raised by his grandmother, but she passed a few years ago, so he came to me.”
Harry let the last of his children leave the room while he continued to stare at an old stain on the table. Was James right? Could he possibly get Draco back? Harry glanced behind him to a picture of Draco surrounded by the kids in the living room. He had taken the picture late one night after Draco attempted to watch a movie with them -- they had all passed out halfway through. Draco’s face was peaceful, a slight smile on his face as Lily curled up on his chest. Albus and James were on either side of Draco, their heads on his shoulders.
Go get him. Harry wasn’t sure just
“Draco.” Narcissa stood, moving forward as her son’s head snapped up. She ran her fingers through his hair. “You didn’t tell me where you were going. I was worried.”
“Yes, and it’s going to work.” Draco crooked his finger at her. “Come on, give me the memory. I know you’re dying to.”
“Hachure,” Draco corrected.
“Who are you?” Draco asked, leaning away.
Perhaps now, he had a reason to stay.
“Gave myself a half day.” Harry stood, hands resting against the edge of the desk. “Wanted some alone time with you.”
. I just want to drive to the store, pick up the milk for Lily’s breakfast in the morning, and come home. By myself.”
Draco pulled back with a small frown. “Harry?”
Narcissa put her cup down before reaching across the table and taking Harry’s hand. “My deepest apologies,” she said, voice barely a whisper in the room. “Draco left shortly before you arrived and I’m not sure when he will choose to return.”
Harry couldn’t help the smile that crossed his face. “Okay, Draco, we’ll get a lemon cake.”
Harry could never see himself touching Draco Malfoy, so it wasn’t that hard to agree to that one. “Not until you remember.” He squeezed Draco’s hand softly before standing. “I’ll go fill out the release paperwork and then we can go home.”
“Can you fix it?”
“You said he was a wizard?” James asked. “Will he be upset that I’m...”
“I can imagine he wouldn’t like his son acting like someone so common,” Potter said, voice teasing as his soft finger slid ever-so-gently against Draco’s palm. “Draco Malfoy, furniture maker. Do you like it?”
place he expected to meet  the blond wizard. The two men stared at each other for a long moment before Draco just burst out into laughter, holding his side as if it hurt.
“Wait.”
Not long after he finished the paperwork, a doctor approached with a hand out and an easy smile. “Mister Potter, thank you for coming.”
“You do that.”
“A while. Why?”
Draco blinked at Harry, startled. “I had a fight with my own child?”
“No, I get it. When we do finally get back to that, it should be special.” Draco slid his hand up and into Harry’s hair. “I don’t know if you were my first before, but if you’re going to be my first this time...”
“Maybe,” Harry agreed, rubbing Draco’s back. “How about this. Albus is at a friend’s, so James can keep an eye on Lily. We’ll go to the store together this time just so I can be there in case anything goes wrong. Please?”
“I don’t want Teddy to come and watch you make the bed.”
“A what?”
“I know because I sent you the article.” Pansy laced her fingers with his. “Don’t focus on the differences, Draco. That’s what killed my marriage and I’m not going to let it stall your love life before it even starts.”

“Of course, he was a right ass.” Harry grabbed a beer and handed it to Drew before taking one for himself. “All but stalked me through school, blaming me for this and that. Serves him right for getting in this situation.”
“How about I drive us? There’s some things I need to grab.”
be kissing Draco Malfoy, and he
the band to be something Draco spent hours looking at before deciding it was perfect. He wanted...
Draco didn’t really know, but he wasn’t about to admit that. He just shrugged. “It’s okay, that’s what the design process is for.”
Before Harry could decide whether or not he was actually going to walk up to the front door, it opened to reveal the regal Narcissa Malfoy. The last time Harry had really seen her, she had been lying to the Dark Lord to save Draco’s life. Harry swallowed his fear and forced himself to walk forward. The bushes did prick him on his way past.
? And I willingly married you? I want a divorce.”
A thousand greetings ran through Draco’s mind and while he wanted to settle on something nice or sweet, what came out of his mouth instead was, “Hey, Scarhead.”
when Draco closed it. He felt his heart beat faster in his chest as he turned to look down the stairs. He hoped that he would see something other than the ugly disappointment that now sat upon Draco’s face. Harry couldn’t move and it seemed as though Draco knew that because he started up toward him instead.
“I’m going, I’m going.” Harry took a seat by the glass and dug into the eggs.
“I know, Jamie.” Harry shut the fridge. “I’ll talk to her tonight. Maybe we can just start her off in my room.”
“Same direction of the wheel.”
Harry looked up and smiled at his eldest son, James. He looked just like Harry had at eleven, right down to the unkempt hair and bright green eyes. “Hey, I didn’t realize you were up already.”
Pansy huffed and stood. “We’re not done talking about this. Let me go get my Pensieve.”
“Daddy?”
Draco slowly stepped back out of the room, eyes narrowed. “That is the biggest load of trash I’ve heard since you came to tell me we were married.”
“I really don’t care about your excuse, Potter.” He wrinkled his nose. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m not going to report you. Your kids need you and I won’t screw up their lives because you’re a major asshole. But if you
“Will do, thanks!”
“We’re making a treasure map!” Lily leaned forward, pointing at the paper in front of Draco. “This is our house!”
, though, and now Harry knew what it was. The new scent was recent, and now he knew it was definitely Draco’s. A musk that was park woods and part potions.
“We’ve been busy,” Harry said, crossing his arms. “Weekends are our big cleaning days, so don’t worry too much.”
“Please what, Potter?” Draco pressed closer, sliding a knee between Potter’s legs. The hitch in his breath was enough to make Draco smirk and he pressed further against the growing hardness he found. “Are you begging me?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Draco said, shoulders slumping. “He already left.”
Next to him, James burst out into laughter. Harry groaned and let his head fall onto the steering wheel, cursing himself through this lifetime and the next. Maybe he could just drop Draco back off at the hospital, admit what he did, and then disappear with the kids? It’s not like the muggle authorities could find him if Harry tried hard enough to hide.
“As much as I’d like to pretend we’re still teenagers, I suppose you’re right.” Draco rested a hand on Harry’s chest. “Harry?”
“Hermione works with Pansy and helped her find the place.” Potter shifted on his feet, looking uncomfortable. Draco suddenly feared how this conversation was going to go. “May I come in so we can talk?”
“They don’t
“I’ll chance it.”
“Can I tell you a secret?” Draco leaned closer. “They confuse the utter piss out of me, too. If mum didn’t make me memorize them, I wouldn’t have bothered.”
“Babe, we’re home!”
Harry ignored his inner voice and shook his head, holding the door for Draco. “I need to get dinner started.”
“A while. Pansy wants her entire apartment done with original furniture and she’s paying me a nice sum to be the one to do it,” Draco said, not caring he may have been bragging just a bit. “I learned from an old man who hired me on and taught me all he knew. Apparently I’m a natural at it.”
“Take me to bed.”
Nurse Annie took the paper and nodded at the picture. “That sure looks like him. I’ll have the doctor take you back, but he might have more questions. Could I get his name for our records?”
“His godson, Teddy.” Draco rolled up the parchment with the examples before putting them off to the side to send later. “If I can get Potter as a customer, just imagine what it would do for my reputation.”
He felt like the asshole, now.
There were only two people at the bar already, watching the television as they ate the locally-famous eggs and bacon breakfast Drew’s wife Ashley made. The smell of the lightly-peppered bacon made Harry hungry; he still had to replace more things in the fridge.
Draco turned away from the pictures. “How long have we been married?”
Watching his children and Draco made Harry fall in love with the blond a little more every day. It scared him, and he knew it wasn’t right. He had to tell Draco the truth and before anybody else got hurt. Before
“Only that you’re lying.” Draco continued his movements until Potter was up against the counter, hands gripping the edge. “If you still hate me that much, why commission me?”
“I can assure you that he is my husband.” Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out the only picture of himself and Draco. The Prophet had taken it shortly after the war and Harry froze it in place at the moment they smiled at another. “This is from the paper when we got married years ago. We were seventeen and more than a little stupid, but...”
The end of the letter caught his attention more so than the rest. Draco’s disappearance finally came to the light as his boss hadn’t heard from him since he had arrived in America. They weren’t sure where he started since he was apparently allowed to map out the region as he saw fit, so they weren’t sure where to begin. The Ministry had contacted American authorities, though, so it would only be a matter of time before they found out what happened to him.
Drew came in just as Harry finished his plate. The stockier man gave him a wide smile before sliding into the stool next to him. “Good morning, you.”
Harry let himself indulge as Draco curled up next to him, head pillowed on Harry’s chest. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could have this, so he would take what he could get.
The front door opened again. Harry almost wished it had slammed instead of the soft
She frowned, fingers twisting in her dress. “Did he not like us?”
“Potter.” Draco leaned closer. “I just want to make your godson a bed. That’s all.”
“Of course. I can make something for him when I’m not making Pansy’s ridiculous requests.”
“I don’t hate you,” Potter said, voice barely a breath. “Malfoy, please...”
Harry looked down at his hands, focusing on the empty space on his left. Since Draco was still silent, he took a deep breath before deciding to just keep on going. What could it hurt at this point?
to you.”
Malfoy -- no,
She shook her head. “Uncle Drew is nicer than Aunt Ashley. She makes me eat my peas. Uncle Drew lets me color on him.”
“Where is my mother?”
A disgusted snort came from the blond before he stepped into the house. He kept his arms wrapped firmly around himself as he looked around, eyes darting from the pile of mail Harry had yet to read to the trash that James had ignored that morning. Seeing it from fresh eyes, Harry knew it looked a little worse for wear, but he pushed down the nerves.
“Lily ended up in my bed again, so I didn’t sleep that much anyway.” James sat down at the small kitchen table. “This is the third time this week, you know.”
“Oh, fuck off.” Harry turned to continue walking, but a hand on his arm stopped him. “Remove your hand, Malfoy.”
-- in his arms where he wanted the boy since fifth year.

“You fear that what you’ve done has ruined things.”
From his spot behind the counter, the local newspaper in hand, Howard gave Harry his usual wide smile. The older man lowered the paper and plucked the glasses off his nose to give Harry his full attention. “Nice to see you, Mr. Potter. Can I help you find something?”
“It’s obvious you really like him. We do, too.”
lunch at school.” Harry stood before reaching over to pick Lily up in his arms. “I’ve decided that I’ve made you guys eat enough of my cooking for once.”
“What are you
Decision made, Draco finished the last bit of his sandwich before tossing the paper in a nearby bin. Brushing any wayward crumbs off his vest, he slowly approached the bench, more sure of who the man was with each step.
“I’m not sure that’s a smart idea,” Harry admitted. “Do you even remember how to drive?”
Draco leaned over to kiss him. “Good night, Harry.”
As with all of her letters, she asked if he planned on moving back to England before Albus started his schooling. His fame had lessened some, but Harry already knew his answer to that. His children deserved to grow up without expectations of their names. And while he probably could have done better on their first names, their last name alone would have made it difficult. He refused to put them through what he had gone through.
Draco seemed to be relaxing into this life with every moment that passed, too. They rarely brought up his lack of memory anymore but when they did, Draco was confident that he would remember soon. The thought terrified Harry and while he knew he should just tell someone, he could never bring himself to. So he waited, biting his tongue more often than not, and desperately wished Draco would never remember.
remember a thing, so Harry let out a wistful sigh and leaned against the steering wheel. “You’re the one who picked it out, love. Told me it had a certain rustic charm.”
He rounded the corner and the park came into view. It didn’t take long to spot them and Draco smiled as he saw Potter holding a small boy, hair just as wild and unkempt as anything. Though he knew the boy wasn’t Potter’s, it was hard to see any differences between them. Same green eyes, same type of hair.
James tossed the clothes at Albus before running to his own dresser. Harry just smiled and headed back toward the kitchen. He had just enough cash in his pocket to let the kids eat at school, but it would be tight in replacing what he lost in the fridge. He would make it work, though, that’s what he did.
“Yay!” She wiggled her way out of his arms and ran to her room.
Draco hadn’t been able to sleep the night before, too caught in his own thoughts about Potter. Not that it helped his sleeplessness, but he put himself to work on Teddy’s bed, figuring he could use the insomnia for something useful. So when Pansy came into the spare bedroom-turned-Draco’s office with a coffee in hand, the hour surprised him. Pansy thankfully hadn’t said anything other than a goodbye before leaving Draco alone in the middle of his woodwork.
Draco eyed Harry’s hand for a long moment before letting out a long sigh. “Am I allowed to leave here without this so-called husband?” he asked the nurse. When the woman shook his head, Draco wrinkled his nose and reached out to take Harry’s hand. “But you don’t
Draco’s eyes widened slightly before he got control over himself, but it was too late. Fear had been in those grey depths and Harry felt like an asshole for even suggesting Draco had been running. After all, he and Ginny had run themselves.
“Anytime, Harry. You’re my best friend.”
bed. Harry was no longer sure he was okay with the situation, but he also didn’t have an excuse as to why Draco wouldn’t be sleeping there. Draco’s hand was already on the knob, turning it to push the door open.
Draco’s nose wrinkled -- Harry would never admit how adorable it actually was. “The younger boy... Allen?”
“Hm.” Draco pulled his hand back and turned to look out the window. “Just get me out of here.”
One of Draco’s eyebrows twitched and Harry couldn’t help but find it somewhat adorable. “I would know if I had
Draco relaxed against him, hands sliding into Harry’s back pockets. “Fine. But while we’re at the store, I want a cake.”
Images of Harry doing exactly that came to mind. Slowly stripping Draco’s clothes from his body, pressing him down on the sheets. Biting down on his shoulder.
“Familiar places, yes? What could be more familiar than my dreams?”
Draco’s hand smoothed across the wood, a smile blooming on his face. In all his years of the craft, he never once made something for himself. The desk in front of him now reminded him of his father’s with its many drawers and hidden caches, but it was much better decorated. Instead of the standard winding designs, Draco tailored it to

Potter glanced back toward Teddy. “I don’t know...”
“I can--”
“What?” Yes, a little. “No, of course not. As I said, I saw you on my way back to Pansy’s apartment. Or I would have if you didn’t interrupt me.”
“Do you want a nap or not, dear?”

That was the crux of the matter: what
Harry found Ashley plating a round of bacon and eggs. Before he could even greet her a hello, she turned and pushed the plate toward him. “Eat,” she said, “you look like a twig.”
“You wouldn’t know it, sorry. He came in last night not knowing who he was.” Harry tried to look upset, fingers tapping on the counter as he hid his nerves. Would they know he was lying? Should he be lying? This had been Drew’s dumbest idea so far and standing here now, Harry wondered why he decided to go through with it.
But Draco
Harry wanted to run, he really did, but instead he gathered his courage, squared his shoulders, and turned to face Malfoy. “Is there something you needed?”
“As much as I’m sorry about what happened, I’m also really happy. Not because I hurt you, but because I got to be with you. I got to
“You wish to court my son?”
“Hey, Dray,” he said, voice soft. “What did I tell you about wandering around at night?”
“Shut up, Harry.” Draco looked both ways down the road before pulling out, the truck only jerking a few times as he got up to speed. “Forty-five, right?”
“I thought you were lost over Gin, but Harry... you got it
be returning these rags you dare to call clothes. I’ll be burning them.”
By the third day, Harry wasn’t sure why he hadn’t Owled anyone in England about Draco. He had no reason not to, but every time he thought to do so, something held him back. Draco kept to the house while Harry went to work, though he didn’t seem to do much there. But then Harry noticed little things -- the laundry had been folded on the beds, or the living room tidied and organized. And on that third day, once the kids ran into the house after school and went upstairs to do their homework, Harry found Draco in the backyard.
Harry took off out of the room, Draco hot on his heels. They both knew the outcome would be Draco pressing Harry against the mattress as they both cried out, but the chase was part of their fun. They had both been seekers, after all. And as Draco followed Harry up the stairs to their bedroom, he knew this was a chase he was glad to have for the rest of his life.
“No...”
Harry left Draco in the living room and took the stairs two at a time. Sure enough, Albus had at least a dozen pillows scattered across his bed. Harry grabbed the thickest one before heading back downstairs where Draco was slowly moving around, staring at the picture frames.
,” James said, pulling Harry out of his plans. “So he really doesn’t remember
“Mister Potter,” she said once he got close enough. There wasn’t a scowl on her face, but neither was her expression welcoming. “Come in, I’ll get some tea ready.”
-----
“Hey Howard, I know you said I could just grab whatever to cover me helping, so I...”
Draco’s eyes darted between the two children before turning to Harry. “These aren’t my kids.”
Potter’s head whipped around, his green eyes wide as he took in Draco. For his part, Draco stood as casually as he could muster, one hand in the pocket of his crisp trousers and the other still holding onto his half-full tea. When Potter didn’t say anything immediately, Draco raised the paper cup and took a sip, trying to hide just how nervous he was.
“You are ridiculous.” Harry patted Drew’s hand before standing. “Thanks, though. I appreciate it.”
Draco shook his head, stepping away from both Harry and the two kids. “I don’t...”
“You’ve gone five miles an hour in the yard.”
“I never said you
“Children that I don’t
Anger soon spread over Draco’s face. “I am not--”
“Morning, Howard,” Harry said as he entered the small hardware store. Once the kids had gone to school, he had emptied out the fridge and found the broken piece -- easily repaired and thankfully not something that would cost a lot of money.
Draco waved Potter off. “Dragons, you said? You really want dragons?”
“I didn’t--”
“Your husband’s name?” she asked, fingers hovering over the telephone beside her.
Harry pulled the blond up to kiss him, more than ready to start their new life together. This time, without the lies and manipulations.
It was another week before Draco saw him again. Despite his better judgement, he went past the park nearly every day since, yet Potter hadn’t returned until the same day the following week. Holding back the giddy feeling in his chest, Draco doubled back to get a second tea before all but jogging to the park. Potter sat on the same bench, relaxed back with a smile as he watched the children play around. Draco felt his heart jump in his throat at the sight.
“Mmhm. The best husband.” Draco leaned in, giving Harry a soft kiss. The bit of affection had been happening more often lately, but it still gave Harry the feeling of butterflies every time. “Keys?”
“Oh, I know, I just--”
James sighed but shuffled off to his shared bedroom, Harry following behind. The two boys bunked together while his baby girl got her own room -- that was probably a big reason for her hiding in James’ bed. Lily Luna Potter was a surprise for Harry and Ginny as they hadn’t planned on having a third child. Now Harry was glad she came -- she looked so much like Ginny, even in the way she was sleeping with the covers all over her
After a long day of hashing out design details and ridiculous amounts of gossip, Draco decided to take the next day for himself and roam around the area near the apartment. Most of it was surprisingly Muggle, but it just gave him an opportunity to see parts of London he hadn’t before. Boston had a good mix of both worlds so he was used to it there; it was time he got to see London’s Muggle side as he never had the opportunity as a child.
Potter’s letter came two days later and it took Draco hours before he gained the courage to even open it. In the end, it took Pansy finding it and teasing him before he took the letter to his room and read through it. Not that he should have anything to be worried about -- Potter had been just as professional in his response, requesting for them to meet up the next day at the park to discuss things further.
He had been smelling it since Draco got here and hadn’t even noticed until now. Harry would slide in bed and bury his face in that scent, letting it relax him into sleep. And it was
. “You two had a fight yesterday. You went out for your walk before I could ask you about it, and he isn’t telling me either.”
“Maybe next time, then.” Draco paused in the open doorway before looking back at Harry, determination on his features. “We’re married, yes?”
Draco’s first introduction to the children could have gone better, but Harry was just glad it hadn’t gone worse. After arriving home, the four Potters found Draco standing in front of the stove, confusion covering his face. Lily jumped into the part Harry asked them to play and ran to the blond, wrapping her arms around his waist with a loud, “Papa!” Draco stared down at her before looking back up at Harry, confusion now mixed with fear. Albus had frowned at the scene before stomping upstairs, the bedroom door slamming soon after.
“Scary? I know. It was for me, too.” Harry eased Draco’s hand off of the wheel and put it on the shifter. “Thankfully, this is an automatic. That means you don’t have to manually shift between the gears. It’s harder to do that.”
Harry quickly left, walking faster as soon as the door shut behind him. Out of all the people in the world to meet in the middle of some small town while he was looking like a dirty, drowned rat, it
Ashley looked between them before giving Draco a soft smile. “That sounds great. We can discuss it next time Harry’s at the bar.”
Harry didn’t look up from the pasta boiling away on the stove. “Yes, Lily?”
He thanked the vendor as he paid for the food and went on his way, strolling along the road. At the heart of it, London wasn’t all that different from Boston. People still lived their lives, still argued in traffic, and sometimes even still slept on the streets. Draco used to give money to those he saw, but it never seemed to do anything. Begrudgingly ignoring the bum he passed, he turned to cross the street to see what the local park had to offer.
“Got some more fish for today. Richard called to say he got lucky this morning,” Drew replied.
Draco shrugged. “I do like to surprise. Which one is yours?”
“Why haven’t you kissed me?”
don’t want to have alone time with me, I could just... have
“This is
“Draco...” Harry stepped into the room, kneeling so he could look at the work. “Thank you.”
“I don’t think anyone ever expected you to greet one properly, let alone live near them.”
That actually got Potter to laugh and Draco counted it as a win. “I wouldn’t have even asked, but I appreciate it.”
“What are you even doing here?”
“Are you going to stand there or are you going to sit?” Potter asked, tilting his head back to give Draco an amused look. “Is one of those for me?”
What the hell was he
Joking around like this was something Draco used to do with Blaise, yet here he sat, on a warm Tuesday, having the conversation with Harry Potter. He couldn’t help the laugh which escaped him, reaching a hand up to cover his mouth in a bad attempt to hold it in. Of all the things he planned to do today, this was nowhere near the top of his list.
“Were you always such a meddler?”
“Mail’s here!” James called, jumping on the couch to reach the owl perch just out of his reach. “Dad, you got a letter!”
Draco blinked and looked between the kids before turning his attention on Harry. “Potter?”
“We’ll drop off Draco’s bread in the morning, then.”
Jules blew Harry a kiss before taking a sip of her coffee. Harry just laughed before heading to the back where he was sure to find either Drew or his wife. The easy banter he had with the townsfolk was nice and made everything more comfortable for him and his family. He wasn’t sure how he would explain Albus and Lily going off to a boarding school while James didn’t, but that wouldn’t be for another few years.
Still, life had been happy. Molly Weasley sent them gifts constantly while Hermione made sure they kept up to date with how their donations were helping. And when Ginny died, there had been more than enough people offering to stay behind in Elk Cove until Harry got back on his feet again. In all honesty, he didn’t think he would ever be quite ready to completely get back on his feet, so he had sent them away..
"It doesn't scare me, if that's what you think. You know, you're nothing like Voldemort was, so don't think that you can possibly remind me of him," said Malfoy with some amusement. His smile was self-deprecating as he met Harry's gaze. "I promise you, when you're hissing away like a snake, he's the last thing I think of."
“What just hap—”
Yes, it was a good length, and not too thin. The shape was straight enough, but also you could see the living curve of it; it reminded him of the staff Harry had made him all those weeks before.
Henry sat back and smiled.
"I’m not getting it out for you," Potter said. He was close enough that Draco could feel the heat of his embarrassed cheeks. With considerable difficulty, Draco managed to pee while still being held upright by Potter. The entire time Potter turned his head in the other direction, but it was still a terrible experience.
Harry rolled his eyes, but it felt like a small victory, somehow.
“Are you ready?” Harry asked, disguised once more as Henry. Draco found it strange to see him as Henry again. Despite all the moping after Henry he’d done, the more time he spent with Harry the more apparent it became that at some level he must have known who Henry really was all along.
“Oh!” Pansy’s cheeks pinked up and her lips parted as she inhaled. “Oh, I see.” Draco could hear the interest in her voice. Dammit, why did she have to be so obsessed with sex?
“And pick and prepare the reeds to make them. I’ve got a store of reeds and rushes from last summer, but I think it’s important for you to understand the material you’re working with.”
"Yes," gasped Harry.
“Actually, it's closer to half past,” Hermione said, still looking down at her watch. “Sorry, I got distracted by that book.”
Kreacher didn’t say anything, but Harry knew he was listening. Kreacher listened to every word Harry said, remembered every detail of his day. Harry found it exhausting, this level of attention. As Harry sat and scraped his chair closer to the table, Kreacher sent a coffee pot floating over to fill his cup, completing the same morning ritual he and Harry had been in since Harry moved in after the war.
Harry felt a bit lost. Ron was miles ahead of him on this. Sighing, he took one more look at the spell book lying on the floor and closed his eyes again. This time, Harry only managed to conjure a vaguely Harry-like outline, and he was grateful for the way it disappeared instantly.
Draco thought about it. "Yes, I do!"
“You get used to it,” Harry said. “And yes, I pretty sure we are.”
The thing about Greg was, he might have turned his back on Draco for a while, but he actually did so much good for the Slytherins by being… well,
“Welcome to the shittest job, ever,” said Amy.
“Today.”
When Harry got home, Draco was not back yet. He went straight to the Pensieve. The thought of seeing the next memory, more than anything, had been what had kept Harry going through the day. He liked it, this feeling of being connected to Draco. Like a secret shared between only the two of them.
"A union between an heir from elsewhere along the family tree, and the person attempting to claim the house," Severus said.
They mounted their brooms and kicked off, Draco following Henry in a lazy swoop up high. Henry rode his broom well, and something about the way he gripped the shaft looked familiar. Thoughts of others hunched over their brooms, Quidditch robes flapping behind them rose to mind. As they rose higher and the wind began to whistle through Draco’s hair he pushed harder, Henry matching his pace.
"Something seems to be... unleashing the wild magic," said Sarah. She was about ten years older than Harry, and a good Auror. "We've just got back from Yorkshire, and there were Dark magic residues alongside the wild magic. We couldn't tell though, if it was from a spell, ritual, or object." Harry liked Sarah: she had been an Auror for years, and he trusted her opinion. He turned to Nina to see if she knew anything else.
“Sometimes there are things even we can’t fix with magic wands,” said Harry.
“It’s not what you want.”
cursed, correct?”
“Yes.” A weariness lay heavily on Harry at the thought of explaining how Grimmauld Place had come into his possession. He glanced up at the blank patch of wall, now neatly re-plastered, where Walburga Black’s portrait had once sat. “Let me give you a tour. You can leave your trunk here, if you want.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes. “Fine. But let me go find Ron and explain this to him.”
Draco found it hard to focus on Weasley’s words, but Harry managed a response. “I thought the balls were switched?”
Draco as a sherbet lemon, wrapped in a twist of paper. The thought made Harry smile, and he was finally able to drift off to sleep.
“I wish they weren’t arguing.”
Draco staggered back. As soon as his hand pulled away from the cup, all the images and half-memories faded.
“Bagman senior was paying him off to obfuscate the investigation.” Weasley stopped when he saw Draco’s expression. “What? I know long words. I couldn’t have a conversation with my wife otherwise. Speaking of which,” Weasley added, looking at Harry, “she wants you to come over to dinner tomorrow.” He paused, then sighed. “You can bring a guest if you want to.”
“I wanted—”
A swish of dark hair caught his attention.
Harry didn’t know how to feel about any of this. There were so many rules, they’d already become tangled up in his mind: don’t borrow the cat… or step on people’s belongings. He sighed, guessing that he’d soon find out what the important ones were. Harry was a great believer in learning by doing, after all.
George looked at the door, a wistful expression on his face, but then he shook his head. “Thank you, but no.” He held up his bag, and Harry realised it clinked; he had his own drinks. “I’ve actually got someone coming over in a bit - never you mind who - so I’ll be fine.”
“We are cooking together, right now.”
"Or maybe I’m the one getting the ‘special’ treatment? It wasn’t easy getting the paperwork through to leave Britain, and I can only take pre-booked official Portkeys. You know what they say: once a Death Eater, always a—"
Harry returned, a few minutes later, with shorts and a t-shirt on. His hair was still damp, but Malfoy didn’t comment on it.
Quickly – before he could change his mind – Draco penned a reply and sent it off with the small spotted owl. Then, zingy or not, Draco followed his usual morning routine. Kettle on to boil, tea carefully measured out into his diffuser, an apple and a knife ready for his breakfast. While he waited for the kettle to boil, Draco went to get dressed. His mother would shudder at his close-fitting Muggle t-shirt and trousers – “Why, they don’t even have a
"I don't think it's a good idea." Malfoy said. He sighed, and the eyes that met Harry's were filled with regret. "It's been... intense, the past week or two, and you've only just been joined to the Black family and this house. Get used to it before rushing into anything you might regret. I'm afraid that you might just want... this... because of some after-effect of all this magic." Whatever his words though, Malfoy's hands were still holding Harry's, and he looked down, surprised, at their joined hands, before springing back and letting go.
“As we’re always either having a cooking lesson, or you’re making the things you’ve already learnt, which are basically all the things I make anyway…”
“Tell me you didn’t destroy it.”
With a sigh, Ron looked Harry straight in the eye. “You don’t ever talk about going out, or going on dates, or even about being interested in anyone. Especially not at work. People see you, and they just think of Harry Potter, tea-drinker, Voldemort’s Vanquisher, committed Auror: whatever. Not Harry Potter, available single wizard, gay or not.”
“It was nice to take the Tube,” Hermione said. “It’s been ages since I’ve done that.”
“Andromeda,” Malfoy said, holding out his hand. Harry could see the effort it took to do so. Malfoy’s hand, Harry would warrant, would be cold and shivery however mild the day.
“I don’t really know the particulars,” Harry said, still aware of the strong possibility that Malfoy and Blaise were sitting in their rooms listening to every word they were saying. “Why don’t you come into the living room?”
“No, I guess not.” Draco sighed.
A thin, tall wizard, who looked familiar – it was Ogilvy – stood alongside the hulking presence of Dunbar Scunthorpe, and the overly genial smile of Ludo Bagman. The bride’s face was partially obscured by a veil, but she looked very much like Liz from the Wasps. There were a few more men in the picture, but it wasn’t clear which one was the groom.
“It wasn’t an offer to personally warm them.”
“When everything else is such a mess, at least this doesn’t have to be,” Malfoy said quietly. “I feel calmer when I see it like this.” He touched each item, one by one, in order.
“I had noticed that you had overcome your differences,” McGonagall said. “But this is quite a claim to be making.”
like him. The prick.
"Oh, about five years now," said Harry.
Malfoy yawned, then sighed. The two of them lay side by side, not speaking, as the rain fell outside. Harry was beginning to get sleepy again, lulled by the soft tattoo, when Malfoy sat up, and swung his legs out of bed and padded off to the bathroom.
“I was thinking, I don’t have anything else to do tomorrow. I could get us a tree.”
remembered noticing Malfoy, hiding around corners and telling himself he had to do it, he had to check on Malfoy constantly. He had told himself that Malfoy was up to no good, and it had been true, but there was something else beneath it all, something about the way the light had always caught on that hair, the way Harry had always known which way to look to catch sight of it and the pointy face below. Swallowing helped push down the feeling, but standing so close in a quiet room Harry could feel it nonetheless: a low, fluttering sensation, threatening to rise up through his body. He swallowed again, suddenly painfully aware of how long he’d felt this strange pull towards Malfoy. Ever since their first year, really.
“How was your trip?”
“You’re not getting any sympathy from me.” Ron leant back in his chair. “Some of us are sensible enough to Floo in, without bothering to walk through thunder and lightning to get here.”
"Now why don't Aurors always wear their robes like that?" said Malfoy, as he looked Harry up and down. They had pulled down and kicked off everything below the waist: Harry had to admit that Malfoy, mostly buttoned up but penis hanging out of his robes, was a sight he wasn't going to forget in a hurry. He didn't know whether to laugh or reach for him, when he noticed something that made him smile.
, that was what Harry always said. Why not act like a Gryffindor, for once?
"You’ll survive this bit, too," Potter said, still sounding amused. He splashed out at Draco, who hissed when the cold water hit his chest.
“Oh, it’s just that… well, Harry doesn’t tend to play for anyone. I, er, I haven’t heard him play for years.”
The cool water was a welcome distraction. He faced the sink, rinsing his glass out slowly when he had finished. Standing at the sink, he tried to calm himself with some long, slow breaths.
Still, when he stepped into the still-empty Atrium, Harry was thankful for his early start. He made it as far as the kitchen – tea was a necessity – before he saw anyone. Or rather before someone barrelled into the kitchen without looking, managing to scald Harry’s hand in the process.
Potter grinned, his mouth lopsided. “And what do I have to do to earn the honour, then?”
“What do you care, Potter? And why should I have to answer to you? I could just as well ask you, although it’s already clear what you’re doing here. You were spying on me, weren’t you?”
Hanging on the wall was a tall mirror, its frame a riot of intertwining oak leaves carved in a dark wood.
she said.
Draco groaned, and then Harry pulled a couple of blankets and pillows from his bag, and they made themselves comfortable for the night. Above them the trees held black skies that twinkled with stars, and Draco was lulled to sleep by insects, a soft breeze, and the reassuring presence of Harry beside him.
"I think I’ll wait outside," Draco said, feeling trapped all of a sudden.
“What does it matter to you?” Harry finally turned to face Malfoy. “You might be the teacher’s pet, but that doesn’t mean you need to be bothered with how other people are doing. Why should you care about what happens to me, when you obviously don’t care about anyone else?” Harry again saw the faces of the dead, the same faces he saw at night in his dreams. “I’m sorry if I don’t live up to your image of the great Harry Potter.”  Harry felt his anger build again, and he laughed. “You’ve been playing us all. I see your plan now: get on the good side of Harry Potter. Good for your future career as the star of the Auror department. Well, sorry to have disappointed you on that one.”
“Wonderful,” Draco muttered as his mother stood and gestured for Draco to do the same. “Just wonderful.”
It was strange, hearing Malfoy talk about the room almost as though it were a person. That was normally Harry’s thing. It was rather as though Malfoy had stepped into his head.
A single green feather sat in the palm of his hand, sticking slightly to his clammy skin. Their eyes met, and for a second Harry saw again laughter and flowers, and the flight of a flock of green parakeets.
“Greggy’s the only pussy cat, here,” said Luna. She gave him a fond pat on the leg. “He purrs so beautifully.”
“Come on!” Harry called, and Draco realised that he had fallen behind again. There was, thankfully, a place to get changed, and Harry threw a small bag at Draco. It contained a range of swimwear, and Draco chose something at random. He cast a charm he had learned at school, but not from any professor. With any luck, the charm should hide any unforeseen… activity within the confines of the swimming trunks.
“Fine,” Draco said after a moment. “I’ll go make us a cup of tea. Just– be careful, those are a part of me, okay?”
to Malfoy he was nervous about his friends finding out about.
“I keep seeing… things. Glimpses, of I don’t know, the future I think.”
“Brilliant!” Potter beamed. “I was hoping you’d say that. I don’t have to be at Montrose for an hour or two, and I’d like it if you could be there, too. Do you mind if I watch? It’s fascinating, watching you work.”
quiet. This is not how she expected them to behave, and nor is it how their peers act with one another. She tells them to head back to camp, and to enjoy their free time before the others return. They look at her blankly, but pack up neatly and head back together.
Harry shook his head. "You assume too much about me," he said. "Really. I'm not clever like you are—"
"Right." Draco pointed the wand, rather indelicately, at himself, and muttered the words. A loose, liquid sensation spread through his arse. "Done." He dropped his wand. "I’m ready for your wood."
George started purring, and stretched out and yawned, showing his tiny pink tongue and sharp teeth.
“True.”
Harry considered pushing again, seeing what he could get out of Malfoy. It had been satisfying, that brief bump, but he turned away. He didn’t want any of it: the confusion; the heat which built in him with the memory of being pinned; the shame; or the anger. He began to walk away.
A gasp-like sigh escaped Draco, and he opened his eyes, and looked at the door. The way the paint clung to the grain of the wood was familiar, yet he’d never felt anything from it before. He kept his hand there, feeling the wood singing through the years, his heart aching with the loss of no longer being in a forest.
Neville puffed his chest out and deepened his voice. “There is dark, there is light. We stand between the two, casting long shadows—”
“That’s what I said!” Celeste smiled. “So tell me, what do you think about lasers?”
Harry huffed out a surprised laugh. His heart was still pounding, though. “I thought owls were supposed to swoop, soft and silent. There’s no way you can catch a mouse if you’re making that much noise.”
“Wait,” Sarah said. “What exactly are you doing here?”
The copies were ones he had Conjured, opting for this rather than Transfiguring stones. Harry had felt proud of himself for that, and he had to admit it had helped him hone his Conjuring skills to be more precise.
Harry left him, pale and pinched, in his bedroom.
“Always so gracious in your welcome.”
Hermione was standing still in the centre of the Room, craning her head to look up at the ceiling. “It’s not the same room,” she said. “I’ve never seen it like this.”
“Yes, well, it would be nice to know how you’re doing, anyway.” Hermione sounded put out, but she smiled, and Harry knew she didn’t really mind. Although she did send him long owls, which he had to admit he did skim through – there was only so much about wizarding law he wanted to know in one go – he couldn’t find anything he particularly wanted to write about to her. He didn’t want to have to think about it any more than he had to.
“I’m still here!” The words came out a little shrill, but they both turned back to him. Draco ran a hand through his hair. “And I don’t have the hots for Potter. It’s just… complicated. By the visions. And he charms everyone, doesn’t he? I’m always seeing witches fall at his feet. I wouldn’t be human if I didn’t feel the odd flicker of interest when he looks at me.”
Walking had been helping, so maybe that’s what he needed to do now. Walk away from having to think about cupboards and childhoods. He could focus instead on the feeling of moving, his feet hitting the pavement, and the sights and smells of the town.
Severus Snape had retired from teaching and moved to a little house in the country, with a garden in which he grew herbs and plants for the potions that he sold. Harry had never seem him actually at work in his garden, but couldn't imagine that he'd let anyone else tend it. He probably had a ward letting him know when anyone approached, Harry realised, and he had a sudden mental image of Severus rushing inside before he was caught toiling in the great outdoors.
Harry turned away, feeling it better to leave Ron and Hermione to their little chat. Hermione was also rather pink now, and he remembered enough of his time with Ginny to guess what they were talking about.
Malfoy was stood by the sink, his lips a thin angry line, his face tight. Blaise looked up when Harry came in, nursing a coffee from his perch at the breakfast bar. Harry was thankful to see a full cafetière beside him, and amended his plan: pee, get a glass of water and a coffee, escape as soon as possible.
With precise words, nothing wasted, Malfoy sketched out how he needed her to help. He and Parkinson spoke in a kind of shorthand, sentences short and often finished for each other, like an old married couple. Harry began, rather glumly, to revise his assumptions about Malfoy's sexuality.
“Poor Seamus, he never had much luck with Potions.”
“Shut up.”
“I’ll see if I can find out which curse it was,” she said to Draco in a low voice.
Harry gave him an apologetic smile. “Er, I’m staying with Luna for a bit.”
“Don’t be an arse about it. I want to stay.” Harry’s eyes met Malfoy’s. He tried to smile, to lighten the mood. “And why would I move out before you’ve mastered bread-making?”
Harry was entirely still, entirely focused on what Draco was saying.
“You came,” Malfoy said. “I know we hadn’t arranged anything, but I…”
He took a deep breath.
“Would you have been?”
“They left.”
"How on earth do you afford it?"
“Um. It’s very… it’s got all the necessary things.”
Andromeda put her hand on Harry’s arm before he left. “You are always welcome here, Harry. And… so is Draco. He isn’t responsible for his grandparents’ or mother’s behaviour.”
“The window, Draco.”
“A party?” Harry frowned. “I– I remember talking to you. But that was, what, a year ago? You apologised, we cleared the air.”
Harry’s skin felt tight, and his mouth was dry. There was not enough air in the room. Under Malfoy’s direct gaze, Harry felt… naked.
“I didn’t get to decorate a tree when I was five. You know that. In fact, you’ve been there almost every year that I have had a tree of my own. Just because you grew up in that huge mansion with a six-foot tree every year—”
“Why did you come back, if you didn’t want to see reminders?”
Harry was aware that this was borderline begging, but he had missed Malfoy’s presence, and maybe Malfoy would drink some wine after his cup of tea and do some more of that brilliant laughing, the kind where he threw his head back and all those little worries seemed to fall away. Maybe he’d be OK with the Floo connection, after all.
“What an interesting name! Now, Henry here never introduces me to his… friends, so you’re going to tell me all his secrets.”
“Can you imagine 11-year-old me doing any of this?” Malfoy said, holding up his own blistered hands.
“And Kreacher?”
The minstrel glanced at Lucius’ wrist, and swallowed before speaking. He slipped his wand free from his sleeve and cast a spell on himself: presumably a sobering one, as he stood a little straighter and his eyes focused. “I’m not sure what I’ve walked into, and I know that a magical oath must be obeyed. But,” he swallowed, “marriage?”
“I– I didn't mean for this to happen again—” Even as he spoke the words, Harry wasn't sure how true they were.
“As Mr Goldstein has pointed out,” McGonagall continued, “there may be times when a quick Protean Charm is needed.” She smiled at him, taking the sting out of her next words a little. “However,”—her voice took on a colder edge—“for the purposes of your NEWTs, I want every graduate of this school to be able to perform a perfect Protean Charm. Although a temporary version is possible, it is still important to understand that it is a charm that may fail. It would not do for you to be let down in the future by incomplete knowledge.”
“Then what is it?”
"I'd say... about five hours," answered Harry. The most he'd been able to manage before was four hours, but for some reason he felt the need to impress Malfoy. Which was ridiculous, considering that Malfoy didn't even recognise the spell.
"Potter–" said Malfoy, and Harry could see his pale eyelashes descend with each slow blink of his eyelids. Malfoy's lips parted with a slow, ragged intake of breath, and Harry closed the remaining distance between them and brought his mouth to Malfoy's. He gently sucked on the top lip before settling into the kiss which had been building in him since he'd first seen Malfoy, leant against the railings outside.
When they got inside though, Harry clanged around getting Draco a cup of coffee, and didn’t say a word until they were sitting down together. Not close like Draco had been with Luna, but on opposite sides of the table, Harry with his arms folded.
A bloom of annoyance sprang up, at how close Potter was standing and how he was practically holding his hand, and then he had the gall to
“But I’m a believer in making my own mind up about people, and so far I haven’t seen you sneer once.”
"It..." Harry was confused for a second. What had the snake been saying? He didn't want to talk about the snake. He wanted to know what would happen if he reached over and touched Malfoy again. What would happen if he brushed his fingertips along Malfoy's arm, or across his cheek? What if he leant forward and just touched his lips to that stretch of skin—

“You nagged instead,” Harry said, unable to help the smile on his face. “You’re absolutely disgusting. Go take a shower.”
Harry had explained that James was a squib and so they didn’t use magic around the house. Draco had understood, but small comments like that had popped out still. Thankfully never around James, but it reminded Harry’s dirty mind that Draco wasn’t someone he wanted around in the long term, no matter how much his heart skipped at his smile.
, but he swore as it finally clicked. Curious, he found the remote and turned the volume up.
“Teddy’s up for a new bed soon if you have any extra time. I wouldn’t mind seeing some examples.” Potter’s eyes widened as if he hadn’t meant to say that, then his cheeks flushed slightly pink. “If that isn’t too forward of me...”
“Need something, Dad?”
A thousand excuses flew through Harry’s mind and none of them were a good idea. “The, ah... the doctor...”
society, even if you were in a repair shop,” Malfoy drawled. Harry tensed as the other wizard continued. “They always claimed you were one of the bravest Gryffindors. Nobody believed me when I said you were just a coward, but I suppose I have proof now.”
“I didn’t realize wizards still made furniture,” Potter said, frowning. “I’ve seen plenty just conjure up whatever they need.”
Harry glanced toward the nurse, who simply shrugged. He turned back to Draco and held out a hand toward him. “Just give us a chance, honey.  Come home.“
“Yeah, I’ve got a great alidade in my bag. I tried to look for it this morning, but I wasn’t sure where I left it. Probably with my theodolite, though I left that...”
“The other mums?”
“You aren’t a burden,” he said, leaning his hip against the table. “What you do for this family is amazing, so whatever made you think that...”
“As far as I see things, you
It might be easier to just return to Elk Cove and pretend Draco had never been around. It wasn’t as if his life would be more miserable than it had been before; he would just be grieving for two instead of one. Ginny would be ashamed of him.
. He half dragged Draco back down the stairs and into the living room. Once they were there, he smiled at Draco and pulled the quilt from the back of the couch. A gift from Molly, but it would work for now.
“More that you know that phrase than you aren’t dead. I always figured you weren’t. When did you get into Muggle things?”
“It’s just... I know him. We went to school together.”
got hurt. Because every time Draco looked at him with his soft smile, Harry came one step closer to never letting him go.
Teddy hesitated, then shook his head. “No, it was just an example.”
“I’m fine. I just... I’m glad he’s not making a scene. Just watch them please?”
Harry filed away the new information before looking to Albus, his youngest son scowling with his arms crossed. “What about you?”
“It’s okay, Pa.” James pulled Lily closer. “We have homework to do.”
“I want you to leave.”
Draco scoffed, though he did as he was told. “We should get an actual driveway.”
Harry’s eyes widened. “Draco...”
Harry expected a question like that from Lily, but not from Albus. He looked over at his youngest son, not sure how to answer. He wanted more than anything to go after Draco, to apologize, but he also didn’t want to put his children in danger. He doubted Draco would actually do anything to hurt them, but he might hurt Harry.
Drew popped his own top with a grin. “Well, there’s this myth surrounding Elk Cove that has a lot to do with asshole amnesiacs...”
Narcissa led Harry into a parlor room, motioning him to a couch before taking a seat herself. The room, decorated in what Harry remembered the Slytherin common room looking like, was oddly welcoming. A fireplace crackled next to them, though it wasn’t overly warm either. A house-elf popped in to put the tea and scones on the table between them; Harry’s manners kicked in enough that he leaned forward to pour them each a cup. Narcissa may be hosting, but she was his elder and a regal-like woman. Besides that, Harry had deeply wronged her son and he wasn’t about to dig himself further down by having her serve him.
For the next half hour, Draco forgot about everything but the little boy in front of him. The kid had a great imagination -- wilder than Draco remembered his own being. He jumped from magical creature to Muggle so fast it almost made his head spin, though eventually they settled on a headboard with Hogwarts in the background and the forest taking up most of the width. Draco would then charm it so the occasional creature would dart through the trees, including the four Marauders “Uncle Harry” told Teddy so much about.
“I’ll get dinner started,” Harry said, squeezing James’ shoulder before brushing past Draco. “Remember what I told you two, okay? Papa just needs to be reminded.”
“Let me finish.” Draco crossed his arms, but not before Harry noticed that his hands were shaking slightly. “I don’t need to adopt because we already
That gave Potter pause and he shifted on the bench. “Actually, I don’t know...”
kissing him.
“Why didn’t you say something earlier? You know Ash would have brought something by.” Drew frowned before taking out his phone. “I’ll drop off some of our extras tonight. Just gotta make a note of it.”
“Are you coming?”
Harry feel? “I’m not sure how to answer if I am  honest. I don’t dislike him, and I think there’s been something more than friendship. But...”
Draco’s lips quirked. “Only if you promise.”
Harry shook his head. “No, I--”
“Hm.” Drew rested his chin on his hand, a slow smirk coming to his face. “You ever want to get back at him?”
Upon arrival, Draco accepted the offer to stay with her while he made the furniture pieces as it would save him from having to rent a room somewhere. Thrilled, she used the opportunity outside of design planning to catch him up in what was happening within the wizarding world - things unsaid in their usual letters. Their world seemed to be changing for the better and while it almost hurt to think about it, Draco had to admit the Golden Trio were doing a great job.
“Yes, I’ve seen you drive.” Draco cleared his throat, fingers curling around the shifter. “So I just...”
Having a home with nothing
Ashley waved him silent before opening the oven. “I’ll keep an eye on this, love. It’s getting late.”
Harry sat down on the bed and ran his hand through the auburn hair poking out from the comforter. “Lily, sweetheart, it’s time to get up.” There was shifting under the covers and Harry smiled. “Lily, come on. If you don’t get up, I’ll have to convince you.”
he was going to get Draco, but the first place he thought to look was the old Malfoy Manor. While they still had wards to keep people from just showing up on their doorstep, Harry recalled where the one spot was located to which he could Apparate safely. The Ministry had forced all magical residences to have an apparition point available for their officials; Hermione had talked about it enough in her letters. Ron had even complained that the Malfoys made theirs near some overgrown rose bushes so anyone coming in uninvited would eventually get pricked.
“We’ll see. I’m still deciding what else to put on it.” Draco pointed to the leg closest to himself. “Dragons for me, of course, but they’re Hungarian Horntails.”
“Influences like myself and Parkinson,” Draco repeated, leaning back in his chair. “And just what kind of ‘influences’ are those?”
Before moving out to Elk Cove, Harry and Ginny had put most of Harry’s vaults towards repairs for Hogwarts and other charities -- it was his compromise for not actually helping with the work himself. Harry had never needed much to live on and Ginny always insisted that money didn’t  matter -- she had continued to prove that until the day she died and it was one of Harry’s favorite things about her. That did mean that they had moved with the bare minimum; having three children on top of that hadn’t helped and both ended up having to work to cover the bills.
“Sorry, can’t hear your bullshit,” Drew said with a smile. “Come on, Harry. I’ve been telling you for years that we help each other in this town and you’re family here.”
“Young?” Harry snorted and put the coffee back once he had poured both refills. “I’m about to start coloring my grey hairs. I’m not that young.”
“Of course.” Draco eased back again. “Now, I promise not to charge you more just because of our past. Nor am I going to give you a discount because you saved the world.”
“I should remember you.” He looked toward the nurse, eyes wide. “Should I remember him?”
Harry shook his head. “Darling, I won’t leave without you. I told you when we got married that I was here to stay and I meant it.”
Draco quickly handed the cup over to Potter before taking a seat next to him. “Sorry, I saw you on my way and--”
after all. The urge to pick a fight with Malfoy was high, but Ginny’s voice in his mind stopped him.
“You’re changing the subject on purpose,” Pansy said, her tone accusatory.
“Yeah, yeah.” Harry ran a hand through his hair, trying not to feel as if he was being a burden just because his fridge had decided to flake out on him. Ginny would know what to say if she were here, that much he knew. “Thank you.”
Returning to England hadn’t been Draco’s idea and, if he had his way, he would have never come back. However, when Pansy sent a letter splotched with tear stains about her dick of a husband getting almost everything in their divorce, he felt he had to. As her best friend, he owed it to her to do something since he all but ran away eight years ago. With a letter covered in pleas and requests for help in setting the new tone of her life, Draco found himself finishing up his current workload and returning to his erstwhile home.
you for who you are, and not just a face that bullied me through school.”
“I understand.” Draco waved him off. “Go on, I should get back as well. It was nice to see you again, Potter.”
Harry shook his head and looked to Albus’ side of the room, watching as James pulled out some clean clothes for the nine-year-old. “Get ready quickly. Breakfast is at school today,” he told them.
James shook his head and gently pulled Lily off of Draco. “Sorry, Pa. She means that she’s Lily, and I’m James. The dark cloud stomping upstairs is Albus.”
