“Not a scratch.” Harry said without a hint of pride. He was actually at war with how he felt about that. On the one hand, it was a little disgraceful that Ron had done so poorly. He didn’t stand a chance against a Death Eater, and he would have to make sure he got some practice. He decided he would talk to the twins before he left. On the other hand, he had been practicing dueling and spells seriously since his fourth year, he would expect that he would do much better. In fact, he had barely used an ounce of his true potential. That was a good thing, considering he would probably have to fight a Death Eater at some point or another.
He knew, in a way, what it was like to lose a mother, and he never wanted anyone to experience it, least of all Draco. He knew that Draco and his mother weren’t exactly close, they had a lot of issues between them, but she was his mother. Draco would do anything for her. He loved her.
“Why do you just want Harry to join?” Ron interrupted, and Harry was disheartened to see he was jealous.
“Oh. Well that’s good news.” She gave him a strange look, fluttering her eyelashes rapidly.
“No, you shouldn’t’ve. Look, this year is my turn to woo you, you can have next year and make it up to me, alright?”
“I’m sorry. I just wasn’t sure how you’d react.”
“Wait—” Harry jogged a couple paces to keep up with her, “What did Mr. Weasley leave out? Is there some reason besides him being Voldemort’s right-hand-man that he’s after me?”
Harry ended up not meeting Draco that night, but he managed to get the message across to Draco in the Hall at dinner.
When Harry had saved Pettigrew from Sirius and Remus killing him two years ago, Dumbledore said they created a life debt. Harry wondered if he had unknowingly called it in when he yelled at Pettigrew to tell the truth. He hoped that even if he had, there wasn’t some obscure law saying that it made Pettigrew’s testimony moot.
“What do you mean?”
“Sirius Black. I should have known you’d get into trouble the second you were out of it.” The door had opened without them noticing and there stood Mary MacDonald. She was shaking her head, arms crossed across her chest, still wearing her grey robes.
In this case, the spell hit a floating, unconscious Draco.
Ron asked twice more, but after Harry waved him off, he stopped asking, merely glaring at the letters. When Hermione made it out of the Hospital Wing, she joined in on the inquiry. When her questions went unanswered, her suspicious look never went away. One day, she and Ron pulled him into an empty classroom and stared him down, their arms crossed.
Harry didn’t stay long with Draco. He wanted to, but it was getting close to curfew, and he wanted to talk to Ron and Hermione. That ended up not happening as there was a gigantic party in his honor being held in the Common Room. He was given a seat of honor, a butterbeer, a party hat, and a giant Gryffindor banner as he was entertained by various Gryffindors. He didn’t see Hermione at all that night, but he did shake the hand of what felt like every Gryffindor. He would have enjoyed himself thoroughly if anyone had been willing to listen to him when he said he hadn’t entered himself in the tournament.
Harry had really been looking forward to this match. He had a very strange feeling that he was lucky to be playing in it.
Harry nodded, not wanting to make a big deal out of it, but Draco still pointed his wand at Harry’s wrist, and a bandage wrapped itself around it. Draco raised it to his lips and pressed a gentle kiss against the bandages. Harry’s face melted into a smile.
“I don’t know, but you’d be miserable and alone,” he teased. Draco chuckled, then leaned forward to kiss Harry lightly.
"What was it about?" He coaxed.
"Settle down, settle down..."
"I miss him though." I saw dada nod.
"M-My left arm... The Mark, Harry... It hurts s-so much..."
"Harry, are you alright?"
"You don't have to be sorry about that either. I'm here by choice, and I was there by choice. I want to help you and I'm willing to deal with things." He said.
I squinted. "Uhm... He hasn't, but I think he'll talk about it at supper. How about we find something to play with?"
"...Draco... your mother?"
"I don't break promises Luca, you know that." I said, trying to keep things lighthearted.
"It... it started hurting again."
His features were relaxed, it seemed he was still sleeping. I repositioned myself to be able to sweep his hair away from his eyes, and my hand ended resting on the side of his head. However I noticed his eyes move below his eyelids when I brushed his hair out of the way. I smirked, getting an idea.
"Yes. In fact, I'm sure I'm better than Ron."
"Hermione and Ron are here- what's wrong?" He asked, furrowing his brows in concern. I swallowed, trying to ignore the squeeze in my chest.
"It could have happened to anyone," I began, letting his words sink in. "What happened, it's beyond normal. I'm sure that whoever did it has probably done it to other people too, she probably probes people's lives like that for a living. Don't let it destroy you, please. It's not worth breaking down over." I said, attempting to ease his thoughts.
"And you cleaned the mess, too?"
"I'm good. How about you all? Hello Ginny, Ron. Well, we should get going now. right?" He asked, getting straight to the point.
"Mother," she arched her eyebrow in gesture to continue, "where's father?"
"Draco-"
say it weird." He argued matter-of-factly.
"The third time's a charm, isn't it?"
"Yes." He hissed. "Now if you will stop asking about it, that would be great." He said coldly. "Honestly, it's just a small pain." He grumbled. I leaned back, slightly offended by his sharp turn in mood.
Harry nodded. “Of course. Do you have that list for me? Anything else you need?”
Draco stayed silent until they were inside. It looked exactly as it had the year previously. “I don’t have my robe.” Draco said distractedly.
“Er—I lived with my Aunt and Uncle for a while, then my godfather, Sirius.”
“Because it’s interesting.” Ginny claimed with a winning smile.
“Oh,” Draco repeated. He appeared to not know what to say. “I’m sorry, Sweetheart.”
“Why didn’t you tell us?” Harry sighed. He was tired of this fight.
“What are you going to do?” Harry asked.
When he told Draco, he didn’t react well. They had tentatively, at least to Harry, scheduled another date for that day. Draco called Harry several names and stormed off, leaving Harry alone.
“Finally, a son who will do as asked the first time. Why didn’t I do this years ago?” Lucius Malfoy muttered, not that anyone could take in what he was saying. “Good night, son,” he said more loudly. “Enjoy your last night of freedom.” He laughed as he left.
“Why would I mind?” Ok, now Harry had a clue that they might be having two conversations. “Oh, Harry, I don’t have time to tell you all about it, but it’s really, really important that you come, alright? I’ve got to send a letter! See you later!” With that, she was off. What was it with women and running away from him?
“I wasn’t!” Ron blushed, avoiding her eyes. “You just don’t understand Hermione, it’s a pureblood thing—” That was Harry’s cue to leave as they were off arguing.
Malfoy was standing just inside the double doors, staring further down the Gryffindor table where she had noticed Harry was sitting by himself. Looking down at him herself, she observed that he hadn’t noticed him yet. It took only seconds, however, before Harry realized something was amiss.
To his utter surprise, there was Draco, leaning against a tree. “Hadn’t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?” Ron and Hermione glared. Harry, who was a little behind them, sent a relieved smile in his direction at him being safe. Draco did not return it, with Ron and Hermione looking at him, but adjusted his stance leaning up against the tree to hide his slight nod.
Harry gulped, a hand covering his neck, as he hurried up the stairs, groaning when he saw his reflection in the mirror in the loo. He was covered in hickeys from the chin down to his shirt.
“I knew it!” Hermione burst out. Harry chuckled at her. Always the know-it-all, and he said that lovingly.
Sirius laughed. “For me, it was the same. I was a bit of a free spirit as a teenager, didn’t stay with anyone for too long. Except…” He shook his head. “Anyway, if you’ve been together a year and you’re still happy, you’re doing something right. If either of you feel like you need to talk to someone other than each other, feel free to write to me. I know how complicated relationships can get, and it can’t be easy having a secret one. How does that work anyway?”
“I guess earlier this year I knew for sure. Draco got me this book that explained the different sexualities, and I figured that was it ‘cause I’ve had crushes on both boys and girls before. I just didn’t know it was normal.”
Draco looked like he was about to cry, and Harry wasn’t that far from it. “Oh, Sweetheart,” Draco whispered. “It’s so hard on me too. I want to walk you to class, and eat meals together, and see the looks on our friends’ faces when they hear about all the poetry I wax about how much I love about you. I hate all the fighting, I absolutely hate it. I’m just, I’m just so scared…” He lost the grip on his emotions and was crying, hard as his voice broke on the final sentence.
“You’ve been lying to us
.” No one had ever understood anyone as well as Draco understood Harry. Except, maybe how well Harry understood Draco.
“No one.” Harry answered, a little thrown off and too quickly.
It was hard to believe it was Christmas.
“That’s good, that will make this easier. You probably won’t need the disease potion or spells, if you and your partner both are clean, but I have to recommend it, just in case, there are other ways of getting those without sex. With gay sex, anal sex, I should say, there’s always the chance of infection, so cleaning spells should be used every time. If you’re ever with a woman—I know, you’re with Draco now, but do you really want to have this conversation again?” Harry shook his head, blushing lightly. “I thought not, if you’re with a woman, it’s a whole different set of spells, so make sure you go over that if the opportunity presents itself. Pregnancy scares are one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me, and I lived through a war.” He nodded at Harry’s shocked look.
“Always like you, Malfoy, to manipulate the rules to your liking, so that they only apply to me. You’re special, you don’t need to follow any rules.”
Harry escorted Draco to the Slytherin Common Room before heading up to his. That night, he dreamed of Draco. Then, just as things were getting really good, the dream changed. He was a snake, slithering on the floor. He attacked someone! When he awoke, he realized it had been Mr. Weasley who was laying on the ground somewhere with poisoned bites.
“Hello, Mr. Malfoy,” The high pitched, cold voice said, and Voldemort turned. It took everything Draco had not to scream, not to run away, not to react in any way that would be deemed unfit. Harry’s description didn’t do him justice.
Newton had no idea of magic, but it still applied.
“Sure. But I’m not gay, I’m bi.”
“Sorry, yes, I’m fine, thank you.” He said in a rush before she could say anything.
“You feel relaxed,” Draco mumbled. “I like that. You’ve been so tense lately.” He freed one arm and rubbed it up and down Harry’s and let out a breath. Harry let out a moan accidentally. The massage felt very nice and safe. He was nice and safe and warm in this little cocoon of cushion and Draco.
When he told Draco, he didn’t react well. They had tentatively, at least to Harry, scheduled another date for that day. Draco called Harry several names and stormed off, leaving Harry wondering about them.
“Sleekeazy’s.” Harry said, happening to find a bottle of one and holding it up.
He looked out over the lake. It was one of the most beautiful days he had ever seen. The sky had never been bluer, not a cloud in the sky, the sun gleaming and casting rays over the still water. It was as if the world was celebrating Dumbledore’s life, and Harry thought it couldn’t be more fitting for Albus Dumbledore.
The things I need to do before I can make sure everyone no longer has a problem because of me:
This went on for a small bit until I was able to match his breathing and relax, leaning sideways into him.
I sighed and positioned myself to be seated more comfortably before grabbing the plate of food and resting it on my lap. I took the two pills with water before taking a small bite of breakfast.
"So," began Draco, "What did they say again?"
I told myself.
"I know. I remember. It's okay now though."
"Oh." He said simply. My gaze was cast towards the sheets, soft, inviting. I sighed, feeling the weight of the past month bear down on me.
"It's my longest streak ever, Miss," he mumbled, keeping his head down. I brought my fingers to his chin, keeping his head up.
"Avada Kedavra!" The words were deafening, and sent me into a daze. I stumbled, watching as the other woman- Rita Skeeter- fell limp, her face still. A tremor shook through me. It had all been so fast. I was suddenly failing to keep my wand steady as memories of the war taunted the back of my mind. Euphemia whipped over to me, a wild look of determination in her eyes.
I groaned in annoyance, frustration, and confusion, beginning to feel dizzy. My heart pulsed, giving me an uncomfortable jolt across my chest. I clenched my hands tightly, feeling my nails dig harshly into my palms. Realizing what was happening to me, I took in a forced breath- one that was too weak. Everything was twisting and turning, my head was spinning, and I was losing my grip on reality.
I stopped, knowing he was right. He was truly stuck in the middle- part of a generation of kids he can't spend so much time with.
"I'm here to help you, and I'm telling you there's no need to apologize, so stop it." I remarked, making it clear in my tone that I was entirely serious. "Now, let's try to start eating. This is very simple food. Your body shouldn't have an averse reaction to it."
. "Did he do something that you didn't like? Say something?"
"Oh, shut it." I punched his arm jokingly. We both laughed quietly.
"Yeah. Two weeks ago I saw my mum though!" I gave him a look of confusion. "I saw where they're keeping her. I gave her flowers." He continued. It took a second for me to realize he visited the cemetery. I nodded in understanding.
"Harry. I don't know if you genuinely believe that, or if you're just trying to get out of taking medicine, but I won't believe it for a second. Every time you forget to take it for a day or two, you start to shut down on everyone. You didn't even want to get up today." He replied. I stared into his eyes, thinking deeply about what he'd just said. I felt that heaviness again, and realized that my small moment of laughter was just that. A small moment.
"He's my only friend. I don't talk to Rose anyway, even though she's cool too." He smiled at me.
Enjoy!
I felt a figure touch me. And I flinched away.
But... At that moment, I looked at Victorie flying above me. There was just something about her hair flowing in the wind that just called me to fly closer, despite everything in my body telling me to stop.
"We haven't really hugged in a long time." I mumbled. "I miss you." I heard him sigh, bringing his arms down to hold me. The feeling was warm and inviting.
"Harry's right, Scor. You're always my number one." He said, tickling my side for half a second. "Also, Scor, all those things you said, about Maria, and your Mum... what I told you was true.
"You don't understand." I said, feeling rather ashamed as I shifted on my feet, fiddling with the fraying sleeves on my shirt and looking down shamefully. "She hates me... you weren't there to hear the conversation, Ron... and what she said was right." I took a shuddering breath, kneeling down by the fireplace. "I'm sorry, Ron. I-I just can't." I swallowed nervously, looking at Ron's face in the green, glowing flames.
"Yes. And it wasn't as pleasant as I wish it were. Not that I was expecting much." His gaze was cast towards the floor, and he didn't move for a bit. Then, as though snapping out of it, he shook his head and blinked, turning around and reaching down to the cage on the floor. Out came a small white cat with bright blue eyes. The thing was so small I was sure I could hold it in one hand. Draco sighed.
I gave out a small chuckle, and a side-ways smile. "That's good to hear." Through my periphery, I noticed Ron and Hermione exit the room.
Victorie and I waved goodbye. I turned my attention to my very good and special friends, who I began to chase down the corridor. But through it all, I couldn't help the grin on my face, and the tips of my hair turning into a light pink.
"It's perfectly understandable. You're tired, you're overwhelmed,
"And how soon after the incident did he stop speaking?"
I gently moved away from him. "It's fine. I'll just... I don't know. I don't want to deal with... with..."
It was only after two bites that I realized it was time to go to class. Students began to file out of the Great Hall.
"And you don't reckon it was anyone we might have known?" Asked Ron quietly. He was still half asleep.
"Right down the hall..." I said, still thinking about his first question. He stood from the table and put his dishes in the kitchen sink before turning towards the bathroom. I stopped myself from asking if he needed the toilet specifically. I had to trust him at least slightly with private affairs, but I felt uneasy. My hand subconsciously went towards my chin as that same same question lingered in my mind
"I like dad's better," He remarked. "It's bigger."
"Scorpius came into my room telling me he couldn't find you. I got worried." He said simply. I looked over his shoulder to find Scorpius standing at the door with flushed cheeks, and watery eyes.
We got ready and ate in silence.
"Maria is blasting the music in her backyard and I can't focus on my book! What does she need music
"...What was it?" Scorpius asked. I blinked, surprised that Scorpius had spoken.
"Dada can I sleep with you tonight?" Asked Scorpius.
I swallowed, turning over to find Harry shifting within his own not-so-deep sleep. I sighed.
"So he wanted to do a scavenger hunt. You know, you could have woken me." I told him with an entertained smile.
He hiccupped, before another strong bout of tears shook him. I simply held him close, pressing another kiss to the top of his head, shushing him softly. Every cry broke off a little piece of my heart, made me want to hold him tighter and closer, just like when he was a baby, when he cried for the simplest things, like a dirty nappy or feeding time. Even those cries would hurt me. Even the infantile cries that woke me each night, even his cries the moment he was born. Because my Scorpius shouldn't need to cry, he doesn't deserve to have such horrible emotions, such pain. No... he deserves happiness, and love, and care, and support...
"We need to-" I hissed in pain "-to warn- we need-"
I gasped, turning around with such force it hurt.
"Talk to me. Tell me what's wrong, my love."
"Your birthday was yesterday."
Hours had passed. I didn't eat dinner because I still felt sick. Draco had already tucked Scorpius into bed and had given him another dreamless sleep potion. Now, I was sitting on the bed fiddling with my sleeves, which were falling over my hands. I felt the bed shift as Draco sat down in the bed with me. I didn't dare speak- I couldn't. I haven't really spoken at all since what happened.  I just didn't want to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.
Nothing like a good ol' fashioned Weasley family Christmas dinner!
doing good. It was with shock and panic that I realized I was shaking and
"Well he says only sometimes. But yeah."
I felt the warmth as he hugged me close,  and it felt like a suffocating grip around my throat. I pushed him away, shivering violently.
"Okay, but I didn't know that when I read them. I didn't know anything." He defended, facing his girlfriend, before turning back to face me. "I'd felt bad..."
"Harry." I looked up to see Ginny. Things were quiet, and still.
"Well I think it's safe to say this is the same defense mechanism you use when you stop speaking. You did mention in the past that you didn't get much... attention, as a child."
Scorpius' impeccable hearing apparently only ever works when he hears something he wants, it seems. He sprinted down the stairs three at a time, panting and with a smile taking over his features.
"What
Ron scoffed. "Tell me about it." Then, his expression softened, and he sat down at the table with me. "He's a bit too stressed, I've seen. I mean, with his age and all that. It's a wonder why he hasn't retired."
"T-take then both. To your house. Don't let them know anything is happening." I felt a shiver go down my spine. I already know this isn't going to be much of a better day than yesterday. And it's my fault.
"Exactly." Luca crossed his arms. Victorie, still looking at him intently, squinted her eyes in perplexion at him. She eventually scoffed and looked away, placing her hands on her lap. I pursed my lips, unsure of what to do when literally stuck in the middle between these two.
"Well maybe if you weren't such a fucking prick, I wouldn't have to leave the house!" I roared, making my way down the hall of the first floor, the black front door in the distance.
"It means Malfoy has nothing to do with this." I said with a face. I was truly upset. I stared her down with a glare. I also knew deep down that he was slightly involved in this. Maybe if he hadn't showed up I'd just continue downhill steadily like I had been. But maybe I wouldn't be having these conflicting feelings about him either.
"Seven months. And I was cleared already by my healer. He's not due until September, supposedly."
"Do you think you could... go? So that I can get to the dormitory without any odd looks?" At first I didn't move, but after a moment of thinking, I did, knowing more than enough what it's like to receive unwanted attention. I felt a little sad letting go of his pinky- almost like I was abandoning him.
"Happy Christmas." He whispered.
"You really mean that?" He asked, sniffling and with a smile.
"Malfoy isn't part of this conversation. Ok? As far as you know, you called him once... and he was there once. It wasn't until yesterday when something happened again. As far as you know." I muttered that last part.
Nothing. Dada didn't stop by.
"But I'm not finished."
"I know." he said. Backing away and making himself smaller.
"I want to get to know my cousin, dada!"
them... that's... he said it was because if he fights back they'll say he tried to kill them... a kid shouldn't have to think like that. Someone his age shouldn't even have to deal with that."
“Me neither”, Hermione agrees “But it doesn’t have to be a bad thing you know.  Sometimes a little change is good.” Harry shrugs. Maybe Hermione is right but right now he lacks the necessary enthusiasm to agree. “I think I’m going to set up my room and say hello to my new roommates. I also promised Ron that I’d write him when I’m here”, she says and excuses herself.
On the other side of the wall Hermione is up and reading because when she falls asleep she sees the dead bodies of Ron and Harry.
You probably also noticed that our eighth years do not sit at their usual house table. We thought it best to put them into a new group of their own.”
Harry doesn’t know exactly what he was expecting when entering the room but a light streamed and homey feeling common room wasn’t it. The floor is almost all covered by a large dark purple carpet. Big windows on the opposite wall of the door look out over the lake and the forest and flank a fireplace that’s in the middle of the wall. On both the left and the right hand wall of the room staircases lead to a lower level. Signs above the staircases label them “Men’s dormitories” and “Women’s dormitories”. There are tables for studying and couches as well as armchairs in front of the fire place. There are no predominant house colors but more like a purple theme decorated with little specks of colors. A bookshelf that Harry can see over stands behind the couches and divides the room.
The students around them begin to explore the common room and Hermione and Harry step closer to the wall to speak in private.
Harry sighs. It could’ve been worse. He could’ve been paired with Malfoy. But still. Sharing with Zabini does not sound like fun. Hermione grabs his Elbow and squeezes it reassuringly. He gives her a small smile he hopes looks more convincing than he feels.
Even though Harry knows that he shouldn’t be that surprised, it still stings when instead of his fully corporal stag only grayish smoke emerges from his wand. “Expecto Partonum”, he shouts again but the result stays the same. He is standing in the little garden that borders on Grimmauld Place and the opaque hedges that surround it give him privacy from prying eyes. Frustrated Harry pockets his wand and leaves the garden to make himself some tea in the kitchen. He's been having problems with his Patronus ever since the battle at Hogwarts ended. Maybe even before that, but this was when he first noticed. The peaceful and happy state of mind he used to be able to easily access when conjuring a Patronus seemed to be blocked.
He doesn’t sleep well that night. But this comes as no surprise since his dreams have been plagued be nightmares for a long time now.  He dreams of dying and cupboards and cold dark places. Occasionally the face of a lost loved one makes an appearance.  Two rooms down from his Malfoy dreams of fires and Voldemort torturing his parents.
After the clapping stops Professor McGonagall steps up to the Podium again.
This is how on 31th of August Hermione and Harry stand with their bags packed on Platform 9 ¾ waiting for the train to Hogwarts.
Standing in the kitchen Harry feels almost deafened by the silence in the house. After the war Hermione Ron and him moved into Grimmauld Place together. But Ron and Hermione moved out last month to a lovely little flat near Daigon Alley where Ron worked with George in the Joke Shop. Harry had been happy for them of course but he would be lying if he said that he didn’t miss them here. The house just felt to big now, to silent.
Half an hour later they arrive in Hogsmeade. As every year the first years were picked up by Hagrid. It was a bigger group than normal, because a lot of muggleborn students weren’t able to attend in the prior year. The group passes them and they give a lazy wave to Hagrid who was leading the students to the boats. Harry and the others make their way to the carriages. When Harry hears the whispers coming from the other student he initially thinks it’s because they spotted him. It takes him a little longer to understand that they are talking about the Thestrals. Of course, he thinks. They can see them now too. With that depressing thought he climbs into the next carriage and they get pulled towards the castle.
Harry picked him up and carried him over to the bed, setting him down gently. Harry hugged him close to his chest, kissing the top of his head as Draco settled into him. “Can we take a nap?” Draco mumbled, already sounding half way to dreamland.
Harry was still panting, still quite a bit out of it, as he was pushed into a chair. He had just witnessed Voldemort return. He had seen Voldemort come back to life. Voldemort had just risen from a cauldron, alive, and Harry had been there.
Harry was confused now, what did it matter if it did if he didn’t consent to it? He didn’t know much about the law in the magical world, nor the muggle world, but he did know from Draco that magical contracts needed to have the consent of the participants or the magic wouldn’t work. As he stared at Dumbledore, he realized that might not be the case here.
“I am going to miss you as soon as I leave the room.” Draco chuckled. “Are you sure I can’t tempt you into staying with me and Sirius?” He was only partially joking.
A look of determination swept over Draco’s features and Harry sighed. The empty cart came back, and Draco marched to his seat, nose in the air. Harry shook his head. He couldn’t see Draco, but he knew all he needed to from Draco’s clenched hand. The ride attendant waved at them as their cart rushed off. He could head Draco making various noises and he couldn’t help but notice it was similar to the noises Draco made when they were alone together. He shook his head to clear it and focused on the ride. They went up a steep incline before suddenly dropping. Draco was screaming and squeezing Harry’s hand painfully. He hoped Draco would be alright enough to not want to leave.
It was even possible he was deciding. He had said he needed to think, right after they had gotten into a fight. Draco had been really upset, even after Harry had apologized. He might’ve realized just how different they were, that they wouldn’t work, even as friends.
Other times, when Dumbledore wasn’t there, it resembled more of a party. Occasionally they would all sit together in the circle of chairs and talk about their week, or their fears. Sometimes Mandy would have a prompt, other times they just talked about whatever they wanted.  Every now and then it would break off and they would all have separate conversations about anything in small groups, socializing. Harry preferred the big group, so it wasn’t unusual if he stared at Draco, should he talk.
“You need water.” Harry said quietly as he fought with the hangings still blinded. Draco mumbled incoherently, neither agreeing nor disagreeing. Harry stumbled around with his arms outreached in front of him. It took him much, much longer to find water than it should have, but once he had drained the glass, he felt better enough to realize he could have used magic to get it and not gotten up.
Draco shrugged. “It’s not snowing this time.”
They were pretty quiet for a bit, Hermione making small talk about how lovely the pasta was. It got into content he didn’t want to talk about, like how he had gotten so good at cooking, so there was silence again.
“It’s quite alright, Mr. Malfoy. Considering the present circumstances, I expect no less from you.” Dumbledore slipped a little further down the wall, and Draco came forward even more, eyes fixated on the two brooms Harry and Dumbledore had abandoned.
Draco eventually quietened completely, but he stayed in Harry’s arms for a long time. Harry held him, willing to sit there as long as he needed to.
“Oh?” He asked, trying to sound disinterested. Harry looked between them, not sure he should ask.
Harry leaned over to kiss him on the cheek and neck a couple times, but Draco didn’t get involved, too entranced by the movie happening to focus on Harry. He chuckled lightly and tried to focus on the movie, but Draco was so distracting. He kept gasping, jumping, cooing, squeezing Harry’s hand, patting him on the arm to make sure he was paying attention, muttering to himself, screaming and cheering.
“We would like dinner for two, as well as a dessert. Chocolate covered strawberries if they’re available, as well.” Kreature bowed low again, muttering about how wonderful it was to serve a proper pureblood, then popped out of existence. Harry took a seat on the couch as Draco retrieved the red blanket from the bed, wrapping it around both of them as he took his own seat.
Just as he was starting to drift off, thoughts of Draco’s platinum hair and silver eyes dancing in his head, he heard the door to the dorm open. Thinking it was one of his dormmates, he didn’t move, unconcerned, and was very surprised when the bed hangings were ripped open.
He continued reading aloud to Draco as the author described more of Ethan’s childhood and day leading up to meeting Noah. He had to admit, the writer was very talented, and it made the story enchanting, despite its name.
“No,” Harry said desperately. “I don’t want to choose anyone.”
For once, the ride to Hogwarts was pretty interesting. The ministry was still trying to suck up to Sirius, so he was able to get some ministry cars. There were a lot of people as the Order had plenty of people volunteer to escort Harry to the platform. Sirius kept Harry entertained the whole trip by messing with the driver, pointing out scenery, and telling Harry stories from his youth. Harry enjoyed hearing about his parents, even if the novelty had somewhat worn off from the summer.
When a piece of parchment fluttered out, the Hall as one took a gasping breath and held it. Dumbledore stared at the note for several moments and the tension was thicker than it had been before any of the other names had been called. After several long seconds, Dumbledore’s eyes moved upwards and to the Gryffindor table, landing on Harry, and Harry felt his stomach drop, knowing exactly what Dumbledore was going to say.
“I love you.” Her face swirled into a cloud of smoke, “No matter what else I have done, I hope you remember that.” Then she disappeared.
Florence fell over to the floor and had just moments to register the sound of the door opening before his eyes were completely overcome with darkness.
He was beginning to wonder if he had gotten the wrong place after all when the door finally opened, letting in Draco. “Sorry,” he said, “Greg and Vince were harder to get rid of than I expected.” Harry wondered for a moment about whom he was referring before remembering Crabbe and Goyle’s first names. They had always seemed more like bodyguards than friends but perhaps he had gotten that wrong.
“No!” Harry said quickly, and a bit more loudly than he intended. “I’m just worried about you. I know how dangerous it is for you to be around me. What if we’re caught? I don’t want to risk your safety.”
He entered the door all the other Champions had and couldn’t answer their questions. He was too shocked, he was still coming to terms with what had happened in the Hall.
“I don’t want to go without her,” the brunette said. The blonde smiled and kissed her cheek. They smiled at each other and Harry felt a smile on his own face.
“Yes. Yes, it was.” Draco agreed, pulling Harry up under his arm. They remained quiet, just enjoying the gentle music and lights.
He heard his name, and that partially jogged him out of his stupor. Draco was pacing in the storefront, when no one was nearby he would whisper Harry’s name. “I’m here,” he said in a clear voice.
“What’s that?” Harry blinked, then wondered if that was something that wizards even do, he couldn’t remember many, there was Grubbly-Plank, and Finch-Fletchley, but they very well could both be muggle names.
He couldn’t really blame them.
I’m sorry Harry, I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve got to go!” She smiled and raced off. Harry called after her, finally realizing he had just landed himself in a heap of trouble.
“I might be sick remember?” Draco said at Harry’s hurt look.
“Nice try, Mr. Potter.” Lupin was definitely amused. He did allow Harry out of the alcove, and Harry hoped Draco would use the opportunity to go back to his Common Room. “I will make a deal with you. I’ll forget that I saw you, and won’t ask what you were doing, if you promise me you won’t sneak out after curfew again. Sirius Black has infiltrated the castle twice, and it is not wise to go wandering around alone or distracted. Should I catch you again, your punishment will be much more severe. Do I make myself clear?” He said it calmly, but Harry could detect disappointment and slight anger under his voice.
“That’s Slytherin, Sweetie. We take care of our own.” Harry’s face became even more contorted in his anger. “I know, they jinxed me, but it was just one person. If more than one person had done it, I would be worried. Their silence spoke volumes in that no one truly took a side. If they had sided with my attacker, they would have told me to get bent. But no one did. That’s a good sign.”
Draco shook his head. “No.” It was a near lie, and Harry didn’t like it.
he thought sadly.
Closing his eyes, he repeated the phase over and over as he fell asleep picturing Draco’s face.
Harry was faster and got to Honeydukes with the secret passage before the collective group got there. He didn’t slow down in the secret passage but decided to leave his invisibility cloak and map in there and strolled casually out. He made his way to the Gryffindor common room and managed to change into clean clothes before sitting in front of the fire. There were plenty of people in the common room and he figured it wouldn’t be a bad thing to establish an alibi.
After consultation with several more books, she found potions and spells to save Harry. The only problem was she wasn’t sure which one would work. The Purgatio potion was a general cleansing potion, used to banish any minor spells or potions in one’s system. It was extremely difficult to make but might be worth it if it was a minor enchantment. She doubted it was but felt that she should try it first.
Draco glanced over before answering. “Mother kept her fine jewels in a hidden vault behind a painting. I’m just checking.” He said with a touch of melancholy. Harry bit his lip. Draco was still mourning his mother, as Harry had thought he would. If he was honest, he still mourned his own parents.
Hermione looked thoughtful. Ron and Ginny started to lose their blush, Harry wondered why Ginny was upset.
“You know,” Sirius said quietly, leaning close to Harry, “I’m pretty sure it’s dead.”
No matter what happened, he had a plan, and a way to execute it, and Harry. He had Harry. As long as he had Harry, he was alright. Of course, he didn’t have enough of him. He wanted more, and this plan was a way to get more. Nothing would stop him, he would succeed or die trying.
Draco had just kissed him. Draco had kissed his forehead. His heart felt like it would pound right out of his chest. Draco kissed him.
He wanted to die. He truly wanted an end to it, an end for everything. It didn’t matter that he would never live again, he had to die. It was the only way to stop the pain. It didn’t matter that he would never see anyone again. He would never see Sirius, or his friends, or Draco. Draco.
“You’re not ready to come out yet.”
wonderful people. And maybe some of that is because they died. They became legends, and sometimes legends are exaggerated. I know the stories I’ve heard about you were. But, Harry, I know you. You have no reason to be as wonderful as you are, no reason except for your parents."
Harry had no desire to get up, so he and Draco cuddled, quietly talking until Harry felt like getting up. Draco seemed alright with his plan. Sirius was reading the newspaper in the sitting room when they faced the morning. He placed it on the coffee table and smiled widely at Harry.
Christmas day dawned brightly, sun casting rays over the snow, gleaming reflections back. Draco didn’t see it, however, as he stayed in bed. He knew that when he got out of his bed, he would be really and truly alone. In his bed, he could pretend that his year mates were in the room, still sleeping, or moving about quietly, or waiting for him in the Common Room. He could pretend that the castle was full, bustling with students everywhere, and that Harry was somewhere amongst them. He could pretend that he didn’t have anything to do on the threat of his and other’s lives. He could pretend that he was at home, in the manor, and he was young, and when he went downstairs there would be hundreds of presents under the tree, with his mother and father sipping tea in their silk pajamas. It was the only time they ever let their hair down.
“When the dementors were around me, I heard the truth that my parents don’t like me the way parents are supposed to like their child. I didn’t really accept it, I just pushed the idea in the back of my head, but I’ve been thinking about it, especially lately…and, I just… I’m not even sure, Harry.”
He sighed happily. “So beautiful.” He said; Harry squirmed, feeling on display. Draco smacked a cheek lightly. “Stop squirming,” he added. He squeezed some lube onto his finger and started spreading it onto the outer muscles of Harry’s ring. Harry clenched against the pressure automatically, and Draco slipped his finger inside Harry.
“He told me a little about this “Order of the Phoenix? Know anything about that?” He gave Harry a knowing look and Harry grinned sheepishly. Draco shook his head. “Said he has a spy deep within Voldemort’s inner circle but didn’t want to tell me who it was.”
“Where are we?” He was so busy looking around he didn’t realize they hadn’t answered. Harry looked at his companions, who were looking at him with sympathy and sadness. “What?” He was starting to get a bad feeling.
Sirius smirked and ruffled his hair. “No, smart mouth. I got a court date!” Harry gasped and hugged him. This was great news for Sirius winning his freedom.
Draco was ready to strangle Harry when he realized that Diggory didn’t spend nearly as much time as he should have at the pond. The idiot needed to undo the work he did so the obstacles would trip up the other contestants.
Draco raised an eyebrow and laughed at him quietly. Harry blushed. “You really haven’t been to a lot of restaurants, have you?”
“Draco, Draco, Draco,” he finished and collapsed back in Draco’s chair. He was exhausted. Draco leaned back and grinned at him, never looking prouder of himself. “Come here,” he groaned, as he held out his arms.
It turned out he wasn’t that great at Occlumency, at least according to Snape. His method was completely different from how the books said to do things. Harry complained about that to anyone who would listen. Draco was the most sympathetic, since he knew how hard Occlumency was. He had no way of being tested, but Harry thought Draco was doing much better than he was.
Just then, as Hermione was opening her mouth, the game began, and Harry was quickly and violently thrown back into the game. He noticed Hermione throwing speculative glances throughout the game and later back at the campsite when the match ended. He really wasn’t sure which option he would prefer she assume applied to him.
Harry set him down next to the bed, and the two met gazes, panting heavily. Harry had to admit, now that the ceremony part was done, he was very nervous about what happened next. He wanted it so badly, but the longer he stood there, the more fear started to flood him.
They traded triumphant looks. “Then why did you go?” Hermione asked, eyes narrowed.
“Not quite,” Draco shook his head. “I just mean…I couldn’t see myself as undeserving of their treatment. It took knowing through you that no one deserves to be treated like that, that I realized I didn’t deserve it either.” There was silence for a long moment as Harry digested that. He opened his mouth, but Draco continued.
“Then trust me enough to let me make this decision about my life. Believe me, if I thought I was in enough danger and I thought it would help, I would dump your sweet arse in a second. But I don’t believe that. I think that you will protect me against anything, and the safest place I will ever be is by your side. I think that you and I together is a winning match. I think that you need me to defeat Voldemort. I think that you will need me to take care of you. I think I love you more than anything in the world. I think that together, we can take on anything.”
“Dumbledore thinks having Pettigrew might be enough for my freedom.” Sirius began, in a low voice to cover the silence. “He says not to get my hopes up, especially considering Crouch Jr. got kissed this afternoon. Luckily McGonagall was able to prevent Pettigrew from the same fate, or we’d be having a different conversation. Understandably, Dumbledore has a lot to deal with, Voldemort’s return and all that. He says he might be able to get me a court date soon.”
Sirius chuckled at them both over their left-overs from the night before as they ate. Harry and Draco were both sporting grins and trying to hide them from each other. They weren’t very good at it.
Out in the distance, he heard Fawkes’ song, and sobbed again, he had found the soundtrack to his pain.
One good thing the article did was dissuade girls from talking to him. He had noticed that beginning this year, there were girls giggling everywhere. When the Yule Ball was announced, the number seemed to double. He on-impulse said no to the first several that asked him to go with them. The problem was, there was only one person he would want to go with, and it was the one person he couldn’t. At their first opportunity, they agreed to just find platonic dates and do something special afterwards.
Harry walked to him as if attracted like a magnet. “I forgot about the Auror, he must be confused. Hopefully he didn’t hear me tell them I was going to Gringotts.” Draco snorted and gave him a small squeeze before letting go.
Sirius waved his hand dismissively. “You’ll see what I mean.” He took a bite of toast. “Good as ever, Harry.”
“This is incredible,” Draco commented. “Fantastic bit of magic.”
This is the shortest chapter so far, read the end notes if you want to know why.
“I wonder if I can come join you.” Draco sat up a little so he could see Harry.
When their breathing calmed, Harry felt like it wouldn’t be blasphemous to talk. “What time is it?”
“Yup,” Harry agreed quietly, “you’re mine, and I’m yours.”
Draco’s foot moved from under him, and he fell against the cushions, swearing but still laughing. Harry landed next to him, massaging his ankle, some of the mirth gone from his eyes, but not completely since Draco was still in a good mood.
Harry could see the amusement dancing in Draco’s eyes and he agreed. They could do this.
“Why yes, Draco, I did. It was my son that convinced me how lucrative the endeavor would be,” Malfoy added to the Minister. “He’s becoming quite the entrepreneur.” Draco smirked at Harry, who glared back.
“No! I mean, he’s not evil, Professor. I think he might be in trouble, and I don’t know what else to do.” He had said that last bit way too desperately, but it at least appeared to sway her.
His bracelet heated slightly, notifying him that Draco had sent him a message.
For the rest of the night, Harry was worried. There was a party in the common room that started as soon as the rest of the fifth years got back that breached for dinner before resuming after. Harry didn’t make it, as he had a date with Draco.
Harry could admit to himself he was a bit worried, but Draco had mentioned on their bracelets that he had some sort of meeting to attend, he just wasn’t sure who it could possibly be with.
“Kreacher knew Masters don’t want anyone knowing about Master Draco,” Kreacher croaked. “Kreacher protected Masters. Kreacher protected family secrets. And Kreacher thought hospital would be unsafe for bloodtraitor.”
“Good. You’re ok?” Harry blushed at the reminder that he was a freak who would sometimes panic at affection. He was on edge, he could feel that any minute he could easily start panicking and his heart would start racing, but at this moment, yes, he was ok and enjoying what was happening to him.
Draco clucked his tongue at him. “Because you love me more than anything, and I know how much you’re torturing yourself over this. Harry, this isn’t your fault.” He reached for Harry’s hand. Harry was about to open his mouth, but Draco went on. “I know it’s not, I don’t blame you. And if you need to hear it, then here it is: I forgive you.”
“It’s not like that,” Harry said heatedly. “It’s not that I didn’t want to see you, if there was a way for all of us to be together, then great, but we still don’t want people knowing we’re friends. I’m telling you two because he’s going to be coming on the horcrux hunt with us, but I don’t want anyone else finding out.”
Sirius held his hand up. “It’s alright. It’s as safe a place as any, just don’t use the front door. Apparate in and out directly. I’ve been meaning to set up a new wards, and I think we need to go ahead and appoint a new secret keeper.” They were all quiet for a moment, knowing what that meant. “I’ll be by in a couple days. I’ve got to go to work tomorrow, it’s going to be hell.” He suddenly looked very tired.
Draco had frozen again, only his eyes going back and forth between the group of Death Eaters and Dumbledore. Harry strained against the invisible bonds, wanting to fight. With him, Draco and Dumbledore, they could take the four Death Eaters. If he could only break free, he could get to Dumbledore’s wand, return it to him, still invisible, and take out one before the others would know what was happening.
Close to dinner time, the group that left for the trial came back. It had gotten worse after Harry left. Mr. Morgan had tried to get all of the witnesses stricken from the testimony, and Fudge had finally caught on to what he was doing. He had also called two acquaintances of Pettigrew’s from back in the day, who testified Peter was an upstanding citizen, working against Voldemort, not for him. That had hurt a bit, as had Morgan bringing up the fact that Sirius wasn’t there, but the general consensus was the day had gone about as good as they were expecting. Harry was a little hurt at that, were they expecting him to fail?
“Speaking of which, you lied to us about that too.”
He looked up when he heard Harry, tear running down his cheek and trying to hide the letter behind his back. “What’s wrong,” Harry asked, shutting the door behind him and setting the tray on his bedside cabinet. He took a seat next to Draco, wrapping his arms around him, ignoring the letter for now.
My heart was beating slowly and prominently. It was uncomfortable. I moved, scooting up to hug him properly. I was laying on top of him, and both my arms were on either of his sides, creating as much of a hug as I could. He moved me over, so we could be on our sides, facing each other, and I gave him my tightest one-armed hug, intertwining our legs.
"So," I asked loudly yet hesitantly, "how're things in band?"
I thought to myself.
I shifted in my spot, turning over and offering him a gentle good-morning peck on the lips. "How'd you sleep?" He whispered with a smile.
I sucked in a breath, before handing back the clipboard.
I think that was the first time we kissed in at least three days. He was very soft with it, though, as if it was only meant to feel. And perhaps it was. He began mumbling in between our slow and gentle kisses.
Just then I was tapped on the shoulder by Maria.
"What? That's not fair, you can't make your dad home base!" Teddy rounded the corner, panting slightly. Scorpius just hugged me tight, hiding behind me.
Enjoy!
"I'm quitting."
"Please. Go talk to Ginny about this."
"Draco?" My hand reached over to nudge him softly. He stirred slightly.
"Harry, we... I'm not here for you to apologize to me... I wanted to apologize to you... I-I was just... scared, and I missed you. I should have taken into account that things were so much more different for you than they were for me. I never meant what I said that day." It had never seemed so apparent the great divide between us. I felt as though it was unreachable, as though the last decade of ignorance on my part had driven a wedge between us that could not be mended.
I flinched at the feeling of something over my shoulders. Glancing, I huffed, noticing Draco bringing my coat around me, before resting on the column beside me, closing his eyes with a sigh.
"I read the Prophet, Draco and I both know." I told him, coming towards him and placing a hand on his shoulder.
"Learning before you're ready isn't fun..." I thought about Professor Quirrel trying to kill me, seeing Voldemort's face for the first time- being who had enough reason to kill me just for being born. Me in an adrenaline rush, knowing I had to survive, because everyone said I had to. Dumbledore taking me under his watchful eye, just because I was destined to save the world, all because my parents died. Him knowing I had to die, and not telling me.
"You deserved to know. I can't expect you to tell me everything about yourself while I remain a complete mystery."
I looked at him bewildered.
"I made myself some eggs," he replied simply. I stayed looking at him as he continued down the stairs, observing how much he'd grown. I remembered first meeting him, how he even needed help to use the restroom, and now he's making himself breakfast...
"But that's boring!"
"It's a fancy type of party, don't you believe?" Asked Harry. I turned to him, a wild look across my face.
As soon as I got inside, I felt warm air everywhere, bringing feeling to my numb face and hands. I closed the door, turned on the light, and took off my coat, looking around. The basement looked like a miniature inn room. There was, as Hermione had said, a small bathroom with a shower, a sink, and a toilet. As well as a dresser, and two beds. I had no extra clothes, but I couldn't stand being in what I was wearing any longer. I stripped down to nothing and took a hot shower, then just put on my underwear, and got under the covers.
"Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy." He replied with a proud smile.
"Hey, Ted... you alright?" Luca said, taking his arm away from my shoulders and looking at me directly. He wasn't making any expression, he was just... looking, and I got to see his features again.
"Don't tell me you haven't taught Scorpius about his high status in this world-"
McGonagall's office was almost as imposing as she was. The towering shelves of books lining the walls seemed to stare at me just as my fellow students did before in the Potions classroom. I looked to the floor with that thought still in my head. "I've dropped Mr. Lupin off, Headmistress. With your permission, I'll resume my activities in my classroom. Hopefully the children haven't made an awful mess." I turned around and faced Slughorn, who waited for McGonagall to speak. A nimble, yet direct and booming voice traveled from the desk in the back of the room to the door. "You may go."
"Look, everyone! Look! Harry Potter! He hasn't been seen since his marriage!" Swarms of people came towards us.
She looked at me with an expression I couldn't understand. She stayed silent for a moment before saying "He's in the guest room."
All awareness crashed back into me at the feeling of Draco's hand on my shoulder. I flinched, looking at him and forcing myself to calm down.
"Sam, you're red."
"As in suicide?" He asked, presumably for clarification. I gave a short nod, once again avoiding eye contact, finding the grey carpet on the floor more welcoming than the current situation.
"Things really are a disaster. I created it too."
"Don't think that way... it will only make you feel worse," he told me. "He's going to come around. I promise you. Now let's try and get back to sleep. Tomorrow is our last day with him."
"Harry, you being alive is... the best thing." There was a silence. He was avoiding my eyes again. "Harry, please," I stroked his cheek, slowly lifting his chin.
"So Potter, living with muggles most of your life, what was it like? How were things, you know, controlling your young magic? How did they come about teaching you about Hogwarts?"
He wouldn't turn around just like that. Especially because that happened at Rose's house, in front of other people. He's not really the type to do that, as far as I can tell. I rarely see him upset at all. Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Granger had seen him like that... Rose had seen him like that.
"What's that supposed to mean?!"
—Draco POV—
"Malfoy is right." Added Hermione.
I felt my weak self land on a bed without a pillow, then, my feet were being lifted.
Let me know what y'all think, and as always...
"I couldn't quite say no," he replied with resignation.
"What?" The girl exclaimed. I whipped around.
"Thank you." He took a sip. "Not bad, not bad at all."
"No. He hasn't. I just like to know what all the possibilities are. I like to be ready, know what to look for. It keeps me sane." He explained simply. "It helps me know if he's
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a son to care for."
"I missed you, please don't make me stay here another day, Draco. Please, it's depressing and bland and I hate it here, please." I worked us out of the hug, much to his reluctance, and I wiped his tears with my thumb, looking into his bright green eyes.
"Dada!" I saw Scorpius bolting towards me and I crouched down, taking him into my arms.
"Come on, you can tell me. You know I won't tell anybody. I'm not quite the gossip-monger you are," I joked, lightly bumping my shoulder with his.
I leaned into this person, not bothering to open my eyes and confirm that it was who I thought it was. He's shivering, just like I am. I felt a tickle at my ear as his warm breath gave me the smallest bit of relief.
"Your dad is right, but, just because actions have consequences, doesn't mean we have to deal with all of them on our own." I gave him a smile, and moved to let him finish the wiping.
"Stupid boy. His legacy continues. We're already finishing what the Dark Lord wanted," she hissed.
"Was I... not meant to ask-"
"Like what?" He asked. I responded by giving him a light kiss on the neck, before letting go of the hug.
"Where's Harry and Teddy?" I asked curiously, not seeing another person out for miles.
"...'m sorry." he mumbled after a long moment.
"Yes! Exactly." He said with a smile. I returned it.
I... I hope so, Scorpius." At this, Hermione burst into tears, easing herself up from the seat she was in as quickly as she could considering her state.
"Scor, you know that you'll always be mine, right? And that I'll always be there for you?" He nodded.
"Maybe it was your ability to make me doubt every single authority figure I'd ever met. Or your ability to make me feel like dying in the war wouldn't be so bad." My breathing became heavy, but I was barely focused on it. Everything was silent, and everyone was staring, wondering what would come next.
"We're staying at a Muggle resort. We're doing this whole thing as Muggles. We report back to Kingsley every evening just so he knows we're fine, and we put our findings in a report That we have to give him by the second week of August."
Enjoy!
I squeezed his hand tighter and opened my eyes. My breath was visible against the cold, crisp air, and Ron and Hermione's brown wooden front door greatly contrasted the white scenery surrounding us.
"W-well, what if- I-I... Draco, you can just- a-apparate us over and go right back home-"
I thought to myself.
"I thought of it... after you said you understood what it was like feeling trapped. I figured it had to do with that... I'm sorry if that was wr-"
"But Draco, he's fine." I said with a caring voice. "It was a harmless accident, there's no need to think about if it were otherwise." I put a hand on his shoulder.
"Boy... What came over you? No, what came over the both of you? You, so mild mannered in my class, and Mrs. Loughty, my star student..." His walk went from a brisk pace to a slightly slower one. "And to think a student who gets such excellent marks and earns so many House points could spew such vile words like a basilisk's venom." He paused, and I looked up to see his eyes widening slightly, but he continued on shortly after. "Well, I should not not be naïve. Anyone can be anything these days." Slughorn guffawed for a brief moment. "...We're here."
"Fine... fine. Whatever."
"Ah, wait." I turned to Luca and stepped away from Gabriel.
"Happy Christmas boy." He grumbled passively, turning to take a seat at the table. I swallowed hard, taking a shaky breath, and I felt as Draco attempted to secretly take my hand.
I turned my eyes away from the ceiling to look at him. I didn't ask him anything, but he seemed to know what I wanted to say. "Yeah. It's true. Plus, that bean soup wouldn't have turned out as good as it did if you didn't come to the rescue." Harry looked at me, his smile a little bigger than before, and I couldn't help myself from giving him a small smile in return. He tried and failed to put a hand on my shoulder.
My breath hitched when the door creaked open, revealing Dudley's face.
"You do?" I asked.
"Dada is really good at teaching me stuff. We read and write and do maths almost every day. I'm also learning about The Tales of Beedle and Bard. Dada let me read the same one that he read when he was my age. It's old and it has his name on it in big letters." I smiled at my son's words, taking in his innocent and childlike expression as he spoke to his mother's headstone.
"Cast a tempus charm, please?"
. I felt a tumbling feeling from my chest to my legs. But no words tumbled out of my mouth.
"I'm here for school, silly." She tilted her head to the side to wave at Teddy and his friends, who started to walk in the other direction. I heard a booming, grisly voice calling for first years. Rose gestured in that direction, so I nodded and followed along.
"Not about this."
It was a picture of a stick person with Harry's name written over it's head and a sad face, then the same stick-person with a happy face, and a rectangle on its hand, with the word 'applesauce' written in big letters. Off to the side was written
"But all of my magic happens by accident."
His eyes squinted for a moment, and his hand squeezed mine. He inched closer to me. I heard his quiet steps of his heels as if they were the only sound around. Faster than I thought possible, my body lunged forward and I embraced Draco in a tight hug, holding on as if my life depended on it. I sighed as I felt Draco trace patterns along my back with his hands. I buried my head in the crook of his neck as much as I could, taking in his warmth and giving a few deep breaths. He soon let go of me, still keeping his hands on my upper arms for a few seconds, then letting go completely.
"I'm not mad... sorry. I'm just, really curious. I mean, I would never have expected it. You of all people, living here?" I explained softly.
"What?" He said, probably slightly annoyed, and definitely confused by my actions.
"And you are recovering from your own things..." she swallowed thickly. "I won't let you take any larger of a role than you need to. You can be there, I'm not leaving you out. I could never... but you are not taking the role of a parent again. Not right now. Besides, you really don't need to."
"My holiday was great, thank you for asking. I took my husband, daughter and son to a ski resort in the states. It was quite cold over there." Dr. Gilroy chuckled. "How was your Christmas?"
"That doesn't make it any better or worse..." I replied. "That doesn't make it any more or less likely..."
My sleeves were now rolled up.
ANNOUNCEMENT 2) Please comment on this chapter notifying me if you, amazing readers, would like me to include an organized full timeline of the events of this book to keep you on track for the next book. The timeline would be released as an extra chapter (Chapter 62)
—Draco POV—
"It'll be fine. I'll be with you. We can just think of this as a... family affair." I shrugged. I noticed his hand had stopped moving. "Don't stop, I like that." I mumbled.
"They had a personal vendetta. It doesn't excuse their actions but murder happens all the time, Harry. People get involved in mucky business and get killed," He explained. My eyes were stinging and his calm voice only bothered me more.
My vision became blurred, and I was as becoming increasingly confused by my surroundings. It took a mere few seconds to realize I might faint. After all, it was far from the first time it happened.
I slowly crouched up. I saw the quaffle, suspended in midair, with a gloved arm extended to catch it. And belonging to that arm was Bonnie's face, a little less than a metre away.
? Why did she say it like
"You feel it too, don't you." I breathed.
"I saw the Weasley's for the first time in a while- all of them, without any sort of problem hanging over us... at first it was... scary, almost. I was worried about how they would treat me given that I had been avoiding them for so long before, considering that it was the first time in over a decade that I'd bothered to show up..."
"Alright now; let me help you use the toilet, Scorpius."
He ended up wanting to stay, so I told him I would pick him up no later than 9:30. Right now, it's 4:00, and I can do something nice for Harry.
"You tell no one of this. Understood?" I whispered fiercely. The man nodded quickly. I Gave him a nod in confirmation.
Everything that has happened up until now, even the very start, before Harry appeared, I feel like Dada has always left some things out. I don't think he's telling me everything about what happened with Maria, or why we had to move. I don't think he has told me everything about Mum... and I definitely don't think he's being honest about him and Harry. If Dada wasn't telling me all he knew, Harry was even more of a mystery.
"What?" I asked, completely unaware of what he was talking about.
"Luca." I said sternly. He looked down, and took a step forward.
"I'm siding with Scorpius on this one." I claimed, pointing at him with the same hand that held my momentarily forgotten letter.
Everything was spinning, and as I ran I turned on every light switch that I passed.
"And then after we can dance together?" Scorpius gets the ability to express himself through faces from his mother. Because he is just so easy to read. But maybe it's the fact that everything he does is similar to what would do. the excitement and anticipation in his voice made me draw in a breath. I don't quite fancy dancing. I glanced around, looking for other possibilities.
"I know; the name's ridiculous, but he was adamant about it. Said it suits her." I turned to look at Draco. His eyes were trained on the cat, and there was a faint smile playing at his lips. It seemed for a split second he was back to the Draco I'd gotten to know.
"Remember, you can cry with me."  I heard him say into my ear, still holding me tightly. I shook my head. "It's not good to keep it in. You'll feel worse." He said.
Suddenly, Victorie straightened up. She looked at me, then at Gabriel. In the middle of everyone's cheering, where she could barely be heard, she whispered wistfully.
"We have children." I paused to think. "We have lives to get on with."
"Harry?" I was brought into focus of the conversation when Draco called my name.
"I understand." I replied, giving a small peck on the cheek.
"Okay dada." I gave him a great big hug and offered a smile.
"I don't know... But look, Victorie's over there, and she's flying way higher than you. Might want to catch up," he said with a smirk, but I can see a slight bit of hesitance in his eyes.
I put the mayonnaise coated knife down, resting the heels of both of my palms on the kitchen counter.
"Rose? What are you doing here?" I asked, inadvertently fumbling over my words.
"Mira, look. A few weeks ago, en casa de mi hermano [at my brothers house], my nephew asked me to see a new movie that was going to come out today. Y claro que I said yes. [of course I said yes.] You know how it is, I love my nephew. Of course I will sit down and watch fairy tales with him." She began, I nodded my head as to tell her to continue, now also crossing my arms.

Scorpius glanced away for a moment, then looked at me again with pursed lips. "Hardships?"
I teased him about how silly he must've sounded, asking about how to watch the films, then, after being guided to the DVD players at the store, asking how they worked, and how to put the disc into the device. He laughed it off, because apparently he admits that day to have been the most embarrassing of his life.
Eventually, Draco's birthday reared forth, and things were generally calm that day. Nobody came over except Maria, who insisted that he try the rice pudding she made for him, before going back to her house as if she didn't just leave us an entire pot full of the sweet.
"I promise."
"I'm getting rid of it, no questions." He interrupted, going past me. I followed him again.
And they were gone before I could realize and think
"Make me forget."
"The Silver Arrows' Chaser is back up again, and the play continues!
"Well I was married to her," I bit harshly, before calming down, keeping an intense stare. "We divorced. It was mutual. But that's not why I'm here, I-"
"He's had 10 years for that though. Most of us have, at least for the most part, gotten past the war... I mean, I understand, he was in the center of it all, but Merlin, I don't know..."
"No Quidditch?!" Wendy shrieked. "Why?!"
"Well you seem like a smart little fellow, who're you?" Draco nearly glared at Dudley, but I stopped him by placing my hand over his underneath the table.
"Oh, you mean this?" I proceeded to bring my hips forward again, this time going slower when I came in contact with him. He shivered, closing his eyes and keeping himself closer to me by wrapping his arms tight around my back.
He seemed to realize that I was calmed down, too. Because he was caressing my back and at one point the tension just... gave out. I wanted to rest.
"Of course."
"Draco... you had me worried sick." The words were spat with a venom I didn't mean to inject into them. "I thought something had happened." My eyes narrowed, and although they were stinging and watery, I didn't let my expression falter.
I gave him a great big hug, not wanting to let go. He returned it, and spoke into my ear.
"Your comfort zone doesn't mean shit to the real world Harry! Please." He said. Suddenly his tone and expression was exhausted and desperate. I realized I'd had a fit that was completely uncalled for. He spoke again, softly.
"It's a kind suggestion. Thank you," I told her, taking over for Harry, who cast a thankful glance towards me.
"Sorry, I haven't really used a record player in ages, but the hotel provided us with one, so why not use it?"
"I'm going to take out my wand so we can apparate."
"Good morning, we're going to go eat with Teddy, how does that sound?"
I fluttered my eyes, trying to blink away any sleep I might've had left in me, sitting up. My hand dragged itself up and down the sheets as I stared at it. The empty spot where he should be sleeping.
"...no? Why?"
"Because," He let out a sigh. "Everything. And on top of that, Hermione makes me think."
"Get away. Get away!" I screamed, backing away, and holding out a defensive arm.
"Draco Malfoy. Harry and I knew each other in school." He said, holding out a firm hand to shake. Dudley complied, and I'd just realized I haven't spoken at all.
"I think we should call a state of emergency... for precaution."
I got up and left P-Harry in the room, and made sure Scorpius was in his room. Then, I went to the living room waiting for either floo, apparition, or a knock at the door. Soon enough, my fireplace roared to life, revealing a worried Ginny Weasley.
"Can I ask you something?"
"Do you need any help?" He raised an eyebrow, glancing at the other things I had laid out in front of me. I gave a shy smile and shook my head.
"Go and be the father you are." He said with a smile. I smiled back, before the low rumble of his stomach broke our peaceful silence.
"Nothing," he said, a little less quiet. I followed his gaze, trying to see what about his arm was so noteworthy in the moment, what had changed, showed up, or disappeared.
"Glad my pain gives you great relief, Weasley." I grumbled.
And with that, she disappeared.
"Yes? What's wrong?" He was sitting up in his bed, propped up against his headboard with a pillow behind him. He was holding a book, and he seemed close to finishing it, briefly adjusting what I had once heard Maria say were
"What
"Hi Ginny."
about how he says it tells you he's not going to say it again. And that's exactly why Scorpius got up and began walking with us without another complaint.
"Thanks for telling me... I know it was difficult." I murmured into his ear, tightening the hug. He tightened it as well.
"Draco... in the time we were together, you never once questioned your sexuality? Not even back then, before we were together? How did you-" he held back another snicker. "How did you manage that?" He said, now fully sat up. "I'm sorry, You're right; this isn't funny, I just..." he settled down. "You never liked another guy? Ever? Never questioned what it would be like to... kiss one? Be with one?"
"I'm good, happy to be out of there, with all of you," Draco's hand moved under the table to mine, which was still on his knee, and squeezed it reassuringly.
"And they understand. And they aren't mad at you. They want you to just be okay. We all do." I said, looking at him tenderly.
I was cutting tomatoes to help Draco cook breakfast, when I was startled by the sound of the fireplace roaring to life. I jumped in the direction of the sound, drawing my wand, before noticing Hermione, covered in floo powder.
"I can't believe those nosy bloody pricks at the prophet were there last night. So what? I'm walking around London. I've lived here all my life." He grumbled, walking with us. He exhaled, which was visible in this cold weather. Then, Ron replied harshly.
"I mean, not really, but so what?"
—Harry POV—
I looked back towards the hallway. Harry turned off the sink and grabbed a towel hanging from the wall to dry his face. I walked over to him, and quietly, gently, spoke:
Molly and Arthur did show up around twenty minutes after, congratulating Hermione and explaining that Ron was going to be fine, that he was extremely lucky, and that he should be able to make it here within the next hour, she ate dinner, provided to her by the hospital, and the seven of us made small talk throughout, Draco reminiscing over Scorpius' birth, and Molly and Arthur over the first time they had gone and had Bill. It made me a bit remorseful that I had missed Teddy's birth simply over being in the middle of nowhere on the world's worst camping trip with Ron and Hermione.
I kept telling myself.
I couldn't wait any longer to kiss him. I nearly bolted up to meet his lips and wrapped my hand around his neck. He kissed me back with double the force and passion, eventually turning to be on top of me on the bed, never breaking the kiss. I held as close to him as I could, feeling the sensation of him- us, together- fearing that he'll be gone forever if I let go, that I'll be alone again. He gently laid himself on top of my body, briefly breaking the kiss.
of all people. You need to be able to speak with your wife."
"Okay, Gull. I'm sure this band is every bit as talented as you say. Anyway..." John huffed. "I was just going to... Be with Bonnie and you and Gabriel. I do intend to put Madam Hooch's dance lessons to good use," Wendy said while crossing his arms.
[Of course]," he said decisively, finishing his food.
"Can I... can I see it?" He asked, mumbling, whispering. I shifted, raising my left arm and carefully folding the sleeve up. Slowly, my scars became exposed to the cold air conditioning of the hotel room, giving me goosebumps.
"I can't stop thinking about him..."
"I guess you're right." He said, looking down. Then, he let out a sort of half-hearted chuckle. "And to think: I moved here to hide from the Wizarding World." I laughed too, giving him a hug.
"I guess there's one thing we don't agree on, then."
"Yeah..."
"Are we okay?" I asked tentatively. He nodded.
"I'm Luca. What about you?" He asked. I swallowed.
"No," I said with a chuckle. "We just spent the day at the pool."
I almost wanted to let everyone move on, so Scorpius and I could ride the simulator again without holding them up, and I could see his smile light up the world with endless optimism. I could distract myself from the coming exploration of fake-Hogsmeade.
"Harry?" I gasped in a breath, looking up at the closed door. Draco's voice was muffled and distant. Of course, I'm on the fourth floor. He isn't looking in the right place, why would he? I'm never up here. I haven't been able to come up to the fourth floor in years, and I was never able to visit Sirius' room. "Harry, where are you?"
"The first book came out after he was defeated." The three of us said it in unison.
"What?"
"I was just sick for a little while. Don't worry Teddy. I'm okay now." I told him, though I wasn't entirely confident at the last sentence .
"Harry," he rested his forehead lightly against my temple. "Harry, you matter so much to me. I could never let you go. I can't let you run off into certain death. Harry, you deserve all of the happiness in the world. And I care about you, and those friends of yours, Ron and Hermione, they would do nearly anything for you. Do you understand?"
"I felt like I needed to escape."
I sighed. He was right. Luca's my best friend and I haven't spent time with him at all.
"I think I'm going to uh, take a shower, Scor. It'll be quick, though. Don't worry." I said, knowing he'd protest to the idea of being apart from me. "It's not like I'm going to vanish from the bathroom, Scorpius." I reassured, holding back another sigh. My movements were sluggish. I'm losing strength.
His expression was hard-set, and for a second I didn't recognize the Draco I knew. His eyes were red-rimmed, and his posture slumped uncharacteristically on itself.  He looked as though he'd just come back from a horrible place.
"You're tired?" He asked, I nodded, followed by a short inhale and a sharp exhale.
"It's nothing." He repeated. I took a nervous breath.
"I know, Scor. It was very wrong and ignorant of me-"
"It's alright, I understand. How are you enjoying the book so far?" My smile came back, and I rolled my eyes with a chuckle.
"No Hermi, we need to teach her that this isn't a toilet- stop laughing."
"Harry," she turned off the light and closed the door, coming over to me. "How are you?" I walked towards her as well, not wanting her to walk the extra steps. She really does look like the baby is coming any day now. We hugged briefly.
the Muggle way is significantly easier than
After a few moments of thought, I answered him. "I don't know. I don't think so though. Because Andromeda said you
We got in a fight that night. I slept in my room alone, well, more like laid in my room alone. Draco slept with Scorpius.
There was a long silence, only accompanied by Luca's breathing, and the occasional drip of the leaky bathroom sinks. Then, Luca spoke again.
"You take up so much space," he remarked.
"Nope, just sitting under the covers... talking." The room went silent once more, with only the sound of Scorpius' paused game in the background.
"I don't want to be away from you..."
"How do you know that?" He asked, looking me in the eyes and stepping back. "How do you know they aren't spies, or, or-"
"What about it?" I continued, eyebrow arched and smile wide.
today?"
"What? Oh, yes, I'm alright, thank you. Just a bit nervous about the first day is all," Rose replied.
you are strong." He stared at me before talking in a thin and sweet voice like candy floss. "But you don't need to hide anything from me. Much less something that isn't your fault." Dada took my hands. He looked at me with the softest smile. It really made me want to fall asleep in his arms right there.
"Slughorn was furious," Luca chuckled.
Hermione and Ron said that they would watch him, that it was okay, but he
I squeezed three more times.
talk.
I don't know what the Sphinx posed to them as a riddle. But I knew that if she had come so far...
"I forgot to bring flowers... Is it okay that I create some?" I was, unsurprisingly, met with silence. I took my wand out, and created a quaint bouquet of flowers. With the ghost of a smile softly forming, I placed the flowers down into the vase by their grave, another tear sliding mindlessly down my cheek.
"He didn't start it, it was given to him by his grandfather!"
I opened the door, feeling the cool breeze of the snowy day touch my face. Scorpius, however, did not show the same wish to bask in the cold weather; he ran straight ahead and started playing with the snow. I heard Harry chuckle in earnest, a warm smile painted on his features. I smiled back, loving when he looks happy. My thoughts, however, were rudely interrupted by a snowball that hit me in the gut. I looked towards the direction it came from, finding Scorpius clutched over in uncontrollable laughter, before landing face first in the snow, still giggling madly.
"You've been with me through all of it. Thank you," he said as he looked away, a tinge of pink on the back of his hair.
I was quite taken aback by that question. It was just so off topic.
"Yes. But we didn't live together or anything...she was older than me." I settled on that as my poor excuse for allowing my parents to hate her simply because she loved a warewolf....and was in the order.....and did not follow the dark-
"Then enjoy the couch, because nobody is sleeping in
"When you get to Hogwarts, we'll stick together." I gave him a playful punch and a crooked smile. He laughed, punching me back.
"Um." He started, but he couldn't continue. His sniffles had turned into full on crying, a bit of snot falling from his nose. I opened my arms to give him a hug, but stopped, unsure of how he would react. Luca opened his eyes for a second, but didn't react. I took it as a sign, and hugged him tightly, wishing my crushing hug would crush all of his sadness in one go.
I turned around, taking my wand out offensively and getting in his face.
"Oh and let him walk around with a lions mane like you did?" He chuckled, and I did too.
By the time he'd loosened his hold on me, my eyes were dry and irritated from the tears, and my throat felt like it'd been marred to shreds. He looked at me softly, and I could feel the concern just oozing out. He placed a kiss on my forehead, before whispering softly.
"Hey, Ted..." She started.
Another day, I hadn't been feeling bad at all, but Scorpius wanted to practice flying on his broom. Draco was there to teach Scorpius fun moves. The three of us flew around under a disillusionment charm.
"Hey... "
"Okay, we'll do red."
I took a quick breath. "There was a war. There were two wars, actually... but all the first war did was start the second one, really. Harry's parents were actually-" I reconsidered my words. I turned my head for a second, seeing if Harry reacted in any way, facing Scorpius again seeing that he hadn't. I decided to abandon that topic for now. "But that doesn't matter. You'll learn about that part in school."
"Ginny and Harry. Just like the book." I heard him mumble under his breath with a chuckle while getting papers organized. He then turned to us. "I understand the two of you are here today for a reason, so let's get right to it. What seems to be concerning you?"
I was pulled from my thoughts at the feeling of Draco bringing an arm around me.
"How did you manage..." my voice trailed, awe-struck by the effort he put into tonight, and his nonchalant tone towards its end result.
She's absolutely correct. I know I can't justify my actions and I know I'm really just not fit to be a normally functioning adult. Ginny really doesn't deserve what I've done to her. I have her practically walking on eggshells all the time, and I'm too stubborn to open up to her about my problems.
"No," I immediately defended. "I moved here 6 years ago to raise him," I replied gesturing towards Scorpius, who no longer stood behind me, but rather next to me, holding my arm tightly.
—Draco POV—
"Well she didn't," I hissed.
He let out a huff of air and stood up grabbing empty plates from the table. I reached for the further ones as to help. He grabbed them and put them in the sink and began washing. I stood up and noticed he had his wand in his pocket.
"Harry... have you... has your... scar, been hurting?" He leaned forward, brows furrowed by worry. I shook my head quickly.
"He won't mind his food touching. Thank you for the thought though."
"Don't hide your face from me," I exclaimed playfully. I kept his chin up.
At that moment I saw her swish her wand in a familiar form, as a yellow light emerged from the tip.
"It is easier to say it that way isn't it." I felt his face heat up and I knew it was because he was holding back tears.
"No, he doesn't. He could never." Harry's voice was soft, and smooth like honey. I curled up against him, letting him envelop me into his arms.
—Draco POV—
I hope you enjoy this final chapter!!!!
Scorpius closed his palms, balling his hands into fists and turning them over, laying them on his lap. He stared with glassy eyes.
I sat back in my chair, feeling at a bit of a loss, feeling odd, like the world had somehow been misplaced, and was functioning sideways, or upside down, maybe. There was a hollow thud inside my chest, and a dull static running through my bones.
"Me too, actually. Let's go make something, yeah?"
I felt she was uneasy upon hearing me say that, because now she knew I wasn't wearing them for Georgia's breezy fall weather. She handed me a shirt with a small smile. I returned it, and drew in a small breath before speaking:
A groan forced itself past my throat. "But I was ready to push it away and have a day with you."
"You tosser! are you using legilimens on me?!"
—Draco POV—
"Draco, why did you so deeply integrate yourself into the Muggle world?" I looked at him, and he stared back at me, grey eyes with hidden emotion, an expression that begged for understanding was held within those eyes, but the rest of his face showed no such appearance. I almost didn't realize that we had stayed silent for a minute. It was Scorpius who brought us out of each other's gaze.
After a few moments, we let go of each other, and I wiped his tears.
—Draco POV—
I stiffly guided the group down the hallway, towards the dining room, where Draco and I had previously set up a small turkey, mashed potatoes, spring vegetables, and pudding for lunch.
"Oh it will go away- you will be able to control it again one day- I promise. It will just take A little bit of time." I let go of the hug, letting him sit in front of me. I wiped the tears from his pink face.
"What if... we play outside with sidewalk chalk? Do you like that idea?"
"Go away, Hermione." He said softly, it sounded like he didn't mean it, or just wasn't bothered enough to care.
"Better... I'm sorry for... freaking out. There was no need." He shook his head lightly.
"Do you think we could just... stay up? And turn on the lamp, and the diffuser? And just... lay there, I guess." I closed my eyes. "God. I know, it's stupid. You have Scorpius, Teddy is here. W-we can't-"
His head turned down to his lap. Soon enough, he stormed from the table and up the stairs, I assumed he was going to his room. Now, I was alone with the two kids. The first one to ask a question was Teddy.
"Dad-"
She flashed me a kind smile, and as she walked out of the room, I could feel the light dissipating. My only escape. It wasn't there anymore.
I shrieked when two arms came around my waist, hoisting me up from the water, and throwing me back into the pool.  I was clearing my mop of hair away from my eyes, spitting out water. Draco emerged laughing. I crossed my arms, huffing.
"I love you dad."
"The Ministry of Magic." We glanced around, making sure there were no passerby's before I took out my wand and took Draco's hand in my own.
P.S: I just got back from Universal studios and took a selfie with a death eater it was cool. :)
"Hey. Whatever happens, if you do... you know... do it the right way. Don't hurt Ginny more than she already will be. Okay?"
"Yeah, you can." He muttered.
"Your face looks funny." He said with a small smile.
"Harry never has a proper night's rest, Weasley. I'd assume you knew that since you slept in the same room for nothing short of seven years-"
"Sorry Dada." He said, moving to hug him. "Why were you gone for so long?" He asked. I heard Draco sigh deeply.
"I'm cold too, but it's worth it if I get to cuddle with you."
We eventually stalked our way down the stairs and into the room where Hermione and Ron were waiting. Hermione, I noticed, had an increasingly flustered expression on her face. As soon as she laid eyes on us, she shoved her Muggle phone into both our faces.
"How are the kids?" I prompted. "I don't think I ever properly met them." I added.
"You're very warm." I muttered, not moving from my position, unsure of what else to say.
"Draco Malfoy. I've actually just met your son. I came here with Harry." I didn't notice Draco was once again by my side until I felt the warmth of his presence. Soon enough, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both standing in front of me. My breath was caught in my throat.
I was thinking a lot, about who I am and what I've done, and I... who would want such a cruel man as a father? So I... arranged, for him to possibly just, be raised by Maria. She was so kind, and at the time Scorpius could have very well been a squib. He- the healers said it was possible, because of Astoria's illness."
I didn't resist when Harry turned himself over in bed, hugging me.
"Why the fuck not, Draco?"
"Please, you have nothing to apologize for." I said.
He gave a single nod, and I mirrored the gesture in return. We looked each other in the eyes, and a silent agreement came across us: We don't need to be best friends, but we observe each other enough to look out for what the other cares about. For that, I was happy.
"Absolutely marvelous! Number 15 gets back on the field!
But at least I never acted on it, so that has to count for something.
I would be lying if I didn't say that I felt at least a dash of pride knowing that Teddy trusted me more than anyone else, except maybe Scorpius. I honestly don't know how it happened, especially when I was so ignorant of his needs when I had him. But, I was proud and grateful, and I wanted to be there for him now in any way that I could, without pushing myself too far again.
"I don't think you would be taking anything away from anyone. It seems Scorpius is open to trusting you and interacting with you more, and as far as I've heard, Draco has never reacted poorly to you being with Scorpius, has he?"
"I guess so."
"It's okay..." I told him.
"I bet you haven't."
"I'm not like I was in sixth year-" He tried to pull away and I stopped him.
It's not that I never noticed, it's that I ignored it. I figured it would give him peace of mind. But now, spending what felt like an eternity memorizing the way his skin would raise and stretch into the small bumps, how the lines were just ever so slightly darker than the rest of his pale skin, I found myself wanting to ask.
, among other things.
"As in,
"Yeah, well, I don't really know either."
"Scor, just drop it for now," urged Teddy quietly. "He'll probably tell you later anyway."
"Do I?" I put my forehead against his.
I brought my hand out to cup his face, bringing myself closer. "Have I told you how outstanding you are? As a father and with me?" I whispered. He chuckled.
I blinked, hitting the door to the cupboard again. Nothing was helping and I'm
"Sorry, he just... looked like such a disaster when he visited."
"But she's gone forever..." He said in disbelief, chest slightly heaving from his crying, throat sourcing scratchy.
—Teddy POV—
"When you become depressed or grief-stricken It gets difficult for your metamorphagus ability to show." He explained. I nodded in understanding.
"Go on, you can sit right by her." I told Scorpius, gesturing towards her gravestone. This is the first time I visit her since she's passed, and I'm glad to be able to do it with Scorpius. I sat down next to him, in front of her. With a swift movement of my wand I cleaned it up, and then I conjured her some flowers, placing them next to some others she had there- probably from her sister, but I wouldn't know.
Ron nodded, slowly, feigning understanding. "Ravenclaw? How did you figure that out?"
"I was at my mothers, okay?!"
"She writes too, doesn't she?" I asked.
"Right here." I said. After an awkward heave and me almost burning myself, the pig was resting on the table, and the two men were unclamping the top rack that had held the pig in place. Everyone around us cheered in that way that you do when somebody accomplished something stupid that shouldn't have been a challenge, but everyone was happy they did it anyways.
I walked over to Bonnie and Wendy, who were sitting on a couch in the corner, and sat next to Bonnie.
"That was a fault on the part of the Ministry and the American MACUSA. Evidence shows that Draco Malfoy is innocent, and there was no reasonable cause to enact the arrest. Next person, please." The noise erupted again, many Wizards and Witches holding up their notepads, shouting my name- 'Mrs. Granger, Mrs. Granger'- until I chose somebody else, near the back of the swarm of reporters.
"I don't want to face them just yet," he admitted, leaning into my side. Without another word, I took hold of my wand from within my pocket, and apparated us to a certain quiet and secluded area surrounded by trees. A beautiful and relaxing place, where no one ever goes.
"But they say he's turned-"
I blankly stared at the piano in the distance as I hugged Scorpius, the hug itself keeping him secure, safe, and sure of himself. And while my physical actions were purely for Scorpius, tender and loving as I guaranteed to him that nothing life had thrown at him ever has been, or will be, his fault, my mind was frozen as one question pressed itself to the front of my brain, making me dizzy, and almost completely throwing me for a loop. Big, red, ugly, bold letters against my mind, screaming:
I got up and took my shirt off, changing it for another. "It's only to pick him up, and I'll be right there with you the whole time anyway." I said matter of factly, and with little emotion. "Okay.." I heard him reply warily.
Just then, I saw Ginny leave our room.
—Harry POV—
I grew tired of the feeling of uneasy arms holding me up, so I allowed my elbows to fold in on each other, laying down on the now-cold pillow, closing my eyes with a deep, drawn out exhale.
"Oh he is diagnosed, doctor. He takes medicine for anxiety and depression."
"Draco I think we need to slow down a bit. It's okay. I mean, he's a kid... he's dealing with it his own way," Harry tried to reason.
My eyes snapped open at the feeling of needles crawling slowly up my veins.
"I've been good, really. Things are getting a little bit better." I told him. But I wasn't sure if it was entirely true or if I was just avoiding myself.
"Guys really please stop... Malfoy looks like he's having one of those fits Harry used to get-" I tried explaining, while glancing towards Malfoy.
Gabriel and I headed in front of the inner wall of the courtyard, overlooking the large sycamore tree in the center. Students were chattering and the clicks of their heels could merge together to make one thunderous boom.
There was only silence in return.
"I'm sorry, Ginny." I said, and like that, Draco, Scorpius, Teddy, and I apparated home. To my home.
So, this chapter begins into the night of the first day, because these people don't know what a proper sleep schedule is, but who does? Harry is going to be explaining several important things to both Hermione and Teddy, and we get to watch Harry bond with Scorpius a little bit too!
"How do you feel? Your first Therapist visit, was it okay? We learned some things." He suggested gently. I sighed in annoyance.
At some point while lost in the endless floating scenery, I felt Draco's presence behind me. He sat next to me without a word, and put his arm around me. We leaned in to each other.
"He doesn't forgive me..." Harry sucked in another breath, before letting it shudder itself away. "I'm just as foul as Voldemort was... I killed. I killed him." At this he let out a cry, curling up even more. His head rested by my collarbone as he stared into the distance. I saw the tears well up in his eyes and softly run down his flushed face. This was obviously not the first time he'd cried in the last twenty four hours- nor the second, nor the third. It showed on the weariness of his cheeks. The irritation of improperly wiped skin, the sunken darkness below his eyes, the bright pink rim on his eyes and the chapped lips from dehydration. He was a mess. I imagined that his throat must've been irritated as well.
"Fine, fine. I admit. That means I have to join you now, right?"
