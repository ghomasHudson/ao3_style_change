“You know,” Molly began slowly, carefully choosing her words. “Teddy’s quite fond of you, and Grimuald Place is awfully big… it can get quite lonely there sometimes.”
Draco needed space. He felt trapped in Hogwarts' dungeons, surrounded by moldy brick walls older than time itself.
“Who are you? My mum?” Draco snapped. As soon as the words were out of his mouth he felt awful about them. His expression softened and he sighed deeply. “I’m sorry, mate. I’m just a little on edge. I’m fine, I promise.”
"I'll see you there around ten," Harry winked. The bell rang throughout the castle and he sighed. "I'm late for Transfiguration. McGonagall is going to kill me. I'll see you Saturday."
“Let’s meet back here in an hour, yeah?” he moved his lips to hover them over Draco’s. “Then we can work on your homework and I can show you how much I missed you.”
"You start every single one of our - you know what?" Harry stood up, shaking his head. "I'm done here."
"The picture is incredible," Harry murmured against his lips. "It's like you were meant to paint me... like you were meant for me."
“I know,” Draco reached up to put his hands on Harry’s chest, gripping onto the fabric of his robes. “I’m so sorry.”
“Come here, kiddo,” he reached out his arms and pressed the child close to his chest. He balanced him easily on his hip.
The rest of the feast went by in a lazy haze. Draco fought to keep himself from staring at Harry, so he stared everywhere else. Hogwarts had been completely rebuilt from the ground up after the Battle. McGonagall sat at the table flanked on either side by Slughorn, Sprout, Hagrid, and a few other old staff members. Some were new, like the DADA professor.
Draco pulled back, his eyes wide. But, he didn't point his wand, and he didn't shove Harry away. His eyes were curious and guarded, sizing up Harry and his intentions.
Harry had Draco sign the card and then hand it back to him. He put the card back into the deck and shuffled before sticking them in his pocket. He turned and began to walk back down the hall.
The thought hit Harry like a train. He still would have gone out. Looking at Draco in the moonlight was
It was disgusting, the way that the school held Harry up on a pedestal. Draco practically growled at the thought, having to resist the urge to grab the candy bowl from the coffee table and chuck it into the rolling flames. They didn't see Harry the way that he did - or the way that he wanted to. To the Muggle world, Harry was just another boy. Nameless, wandering aimlessly through streets that didn't take the chance to notice how special he was. To the Wizarding world, he was King - an idol that was worshiped. People practically kneeled before Harry when he acknowledged them, and made way wherever he walked.
magic, of course - but the Muggle kind. Card tricks, pulling coins out from behind people’s ears, magicians pretending to saw people in half. He loved it.
“Will everyone stop being so ridiculous?” Harry stood up, and looked at everyone in the hall. Professor McGonagall was seated at the headmistress’ seat, calmly eating her pudding and watching. His heart fell. “I didn’t use you guys for anything. I don’t use people. I... I just... how am I supposed to love someone who caused the deaths of so many people? How can I hold him at night when I know that people like Fred and Collin died because of him?”
“Get behind me,” Harry ordered, whipping around. A hooded figure appeared in the doorway, framed by smoke and ash. It was becoming difficult to breathe; Draco’s head was beginning to spin.
He made his way up to Harry's chest, slowly rising out of the chair. Harry kept his hand on Draco's cheek guiding him upwards. They quickly became level with each other, their lips inches apart. They stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity, neither of them blinking.
“I wouldn’t want to spend our nights any other way,” Draco replied, pulling Teddy close to him in a tight hug. The child sighed happily, moving his arms to wrap them around Draco’s neck. Together, Draco, Hermione, the Weasleys, Hagrid, Minerva McGonagall, Neville Longbottom, and a number of other students whose names escaped Draco, left the cemetery. He glanced back over his shoulder at the newest gravestone, a few feet to the left of Lily and James Potter. His heart swelled.
“I missed you too,” Draco breathed out. He felt as if he was choking on air. His eyes burned with held back tears and his lungs wanted to burst from behind his ribs. He could feel himself coming undone in Harry’s embrace. It was too much for him to handle. “I missed you so fucking much.”
“Bloody hell,” he mumbled to himself, staring down at his bare feet. He was going to freeze at that rate.
"You did," The corner's of Draco's mouth tilted up at the corners. "And I must say I disagree. You're the one who's stunning."
"How in Merlin’s name do you think it’s okay to say something like that?” Draco’s bottom lip was quivering. “Honestly. I don’t understand it. It’s... it’s like you don’t even know me! Or care about me!”
“She’s right, mate,” Neville spoke up. He reached out his hand and high fived Blaise. “We could have been bad asses, mate.”
"You always look good too," Harry finally broke the silence. "No matter what kind of day you're having."
Draco turned to his most recent and pulled out a quill from his satchel, picking up where he left off. He stuck his tongue out in concentration as he focused on properly drawing Harry's jawline. No matter how many times he practiced, no matter how hard he tried, he could never get it just right. It was beginning to eat away at him.
The funeral was held three days later. It was a small service, with only close friends and colleagues in attendance. Hermione didn’t stop crying once; Ron sent more than a few blaming looks in Draco’s direction. George and Ginny were the only two who didn’t seem to completely blame him for Harry’s death. Arthur blamed the Ministry for only sending two fairly knew aurors to handle such a mission, and Molly blamed herself.
Harry sat in the Great Hall, staring down at his breakfast. French toast, sunny side up eggs, and pumpkin juice. His chin rested in the palm of his hand, and his glasses were balancing precariously on the tip of his nose.
Draco woke with the sense that he'd had one of the craziest dreams. His heart beat quickly in his chest, but for once it wasn't out of stress. He wanted to jump back into the dream, to feel what he had been feeling only moments before.
“You have no idea,” Harry sighed. Draco patted him on the shoulder, and the sudden feeling of Draco’s hand on him.
“I know what will cheer you up,” Ron pointed his fork at Harry. “Why don’t we go play some quidditch? I heard Slytherin was having an extra practice this afternoon, but as long as we’re off the pitch before it starts, Malfoy shouldn’t have a problem with it.”
Draco felt like doing a million back flips while simultaneously drowning himself in the Black Lake. Surely Potter was joking... right? The idea of him willingly doing anything for Draco was impossible. He couldn't even laugh at the idea it was so ludicrous.
Ron was embraced in Hermione’s much smaller arms on the plush crimson sofa in front of the fire, her petite front melding into the much taller wizard’s back.  The witch’s chin was hooked on Ron’s broad shoulder as the two lovers slept peacefully.  Harry’s fingers itched to comb back Hermione’s halo of brown curls but he didn’t want to disturb their slumber.  They deserved their rest.  The guilt was trying to crawl back into his system as Harry grabbed a nearby cream afghan and draped it over the two before he left for the kitchens as quiet as a whisper.
Sorry for the delay on this chapter. I'm going to be honest, my work life balance has been in shambles the past year. I've also been in a writing rut for a long time. There have been so many times where I wanted to delete this chapter and start over, but then I felt like I was too far in to do so and it just sat collecting dust while I scrambled to find any way to save it. This was a fucking monster to write and I still don't quite know how to feel about it overall but we're going to keep on truckin'. I know I promised this next chapter was going to introduce the champions but overall I feel like instead of taking another year to update and having an 11k+ chapter, I chose the lesser of two evils and chose to divide the next part into two, so thanks for sticking around this hot mess express.
Tuft barged in to the conversation, his face growing ruddy with frustration. “To be frank Headmistress, you and the former Headmaster know more than anyone, that this is fairer. The results won’t be tampered with.”
Tulips returned with a frenzied pop.  A silver tray containing a matching silver kettle and, a standard issue white cup and saucer, a silver teaspoon, and a small porcelain bowl of crystalized ginger was placed before him. She began wringing her hands. “Tulip couldn’t find ginger tea bags and had to improvise. Tulip hopes Harry finds her substitute adequate.”
Minerva huffed.  Kingsley could sense the tension radiating off of the witch.  “Would you like me to put on the kettle?” He got up to search through a cabinet off to the side of the headmistress’ desk.  “I can brew some of that stress relief tea Poppy made for you if you’d like.”
He took a moment to think.  Harry worried his lip as he risked at glance at a too quiet Ron.  Unease settled in his gut.  The freckled wizard’s lips formed a tight frown, his jaw tense.  His blue eyes stormed with tired anger, but Harry knew him long enough to know that beneath the thin layer of anger was pain.  The pain of watching his best friend waste away and resist help because he was too stubborn and self-sacrificing.  He powered through as his throat tightened with emotion and rasped out a whispered, “yes.”
Ron exhaled a long relieved breath which turned into a soft whispered, “Good man.” The ginger wizard tapped on his chin in thought. “Make it three.” He deserved it after all the shite Harry had been putting them through.
Minerva tried not to wince at the strength of the witch’s comforting squeeze against her hands. “As do I.” She breathed a sigh of relief as Olympe turned her attention to Radomir.  “And you must be Headmaster Nikiforov.”
“I’m sorry Headmistress, our hands are tied.”  Percy Weasley tangled his fingers anxiously in his lap.  It took all his courage to maintain eye contact with the steely glare of his former Head of House. “The Department of Magical Games only recently came forward with the plans The Department of International Magical Cooperation have been working on in secret for the past year.”
The weather outside mirrored Minerva’s insides as a violent gust of wind rattled the wrought iron window frame.  Flecks of sleet snapped incessantly against the frosting window glass.  Minerva rose to check the progress of the storm outside, a concerned frown forming at the corners of her lips.  The soft grey of late afternoon sky was turning a threatening dark indigo.
If only for her own sanity, Minerva urged to speak with them in private away from the prying eyes of the Ministry before they descended onto property and destroyed the year of normalcy she promised her older students. There was an uncomfortable twinge in her belly when she reminded herself that some of them were more than just students.  Many had fought alongside her on the front lines at the Battle of Hogwarts.  Some were allies, some foes; all of them soldiers too young for their own good.  Finding out you were magical was supposed to be euphoric but as she grew older, she wondered at what cost.
Harry shifted on his feet with discomfort as he took in the elf’s wide star struck eyes. “…Just Harry is fine.”
The rest of breakfast was a mechanical affair.  Harry counted his bites of toast and his sips of juice. Anything to avoid the suspicious stares from Ron and the worried glances from Hermione.
Harry wanted to chase the vanishing heat as Ron and Neville untangled his thin shaky frame from their arms.  He stumbled over to his bed and flopped onto the downy comforter.  It took his remaining energy to lift his head and throw his glasses onto his side table.  For a brief moment, he made eye contact again with Ron.  His stomach clenched with guilt as he took in the dark circles tattooed beneath his eyes.  He parted his chapped lips to speak. “Ron, I’m—“
Harry’s stomach fluttered as more students and professors filled the hall.  He was giddy.  So much blood, sweat, and tears had gone into rebuilding.  To see the shock and awe in the eyes of the students made it all worth it.  It was a fresh start for everyone, a new era.
The older students began to file into the Great Hall.  Harry tilted his head to look at the cosmic ceiling adorned with floating candles.  After all these years, it still left him in awe.
The headmistress huffed before taking her glasses off and folding the delicate golden wire frames and placing them on the edge of her desk.  “Very well.” A humorless chuckle left her lips.  “Then I guess my hands are tied also.”
“Eh, I try.” Radomir winked at both witches before dropping Olympe’s hand and lifting his head in a hearty laugh.
“No thank you, I’m--” Harry paused. One of the major Weasley love languages was food. It in no way would make up for months of him being an insufferable arsehole but he had to start somewhere.  “Actually, Tulip, would you be able to send some pastries and a pot of tea to the Gryffindor commons room?”
Olympe nodded. She then tapped her manicured fingers to her scarlet lips thoughtfully.  “Mr. Dujardin… how do I say this?  He was a competent student, very much an idealist, but was very poor on the follow through. He’d have grandiose plans but no realistic way to accomplish them.  And, Merlin, his parents. The boy himself was fine, but I’ve never received more howlers from a parent than I did in the seven years he was at Beauxbatons.” The witch shuddered at the memory.
Olympe stood in a white fur traveling cloak with a pillbox hat to match. “Minerva, darling!” She took the shorter witch’s hands in her silk gloved ones. “It’s so nice to see you again, though I wish the circumstances were different.”
Harry missed the alarmed gazes shared between Ron, Hermione, and Ginny as McGonagall dismissed them from the hall.
An elbow gently pressed against Minerva’s arm as Radomir murmured, “So that’s what it’s called in English, eh?”  It took all of Minerva’s self-restraint to not combust as Radomir wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
“Y-yeah. Just tired.”  Harry ignored Ron’s penetrating gaze and the guilt forming in his belly. He looked shamefully down at the table and reluctantly grabbed a piece of toast.
Worried cerulean eyes searched his face as they sat on opposite sides of the Gryffindor table.  “You alright, Harry?”
Soon the trio sat in tense silence.  The only sound in the chamber was the gentle hiss of water boiling.  Percy jumped up from his seat as soon as the kettle wailed.  He summoned three cups and saucers with his wand and began to serve the tea.
With each step the familiar chaotic rhythm of the kitchens drummed louder.  Harry reached for the old painted red door gingerly with his fingers, cautious of the purring coming from his feet.  He inched towards a younger house elf who’d been hired at the start of term.  His voice was raspy from lack of use. “E-excuse me?”
The greying witch stood at the podium in deep emerald robes.  She adjusted her spectacles before grasping the edge of the ancient cherry wood with long elegant fingers.  Suspicion tingled at Harry’s spine as he noticed the minute tension of her grip.  He forced himself to shake the feeling away.
As the tournament drew closer, sleep was merely a concept.  Harry survived the days with fitful naps that barely lasted a couple of hours in between the nightmares and the heavy load of coursework and the always constant attention of being the Saviour of the Wizarding World.  He was running on fumes that were quickly evaporating.  Ron and Hermione began to watch him in shifts, their own sleep and coursework put aside.  The guilt and self-loathing of not being able to take care himself hung around him like a toxic vapour.  He felt the need to push them away for their own sake, to put on a brave face he’d been conditioned for his entire life even though he was still cognizant enough to know that he was crumbling.  Had he been sleeping, Harry would be very much be aware that it was a lost cause.  Only Ron and Hermione knew him as well as he knew himself, sometimes more.
“Of course,” Radomir’s fork chimed on his empty plate as he placed it on the table, “it’s to be expected.”
“Harry?” Hermione rushed around the table in a panic. She hooked her trembling arms underneath Harry’s arms in a desperate attempt to get his heavier frame up from the table. “C’mon, we need to get you to Madam Pomfrey.”
The walk back to the dorms was hazy. Harry didn’t know how or when he made it to the dorm he shared with Neville and Ron as he stared at the mottled red velvet of his bed curtains.  He took off his glasses and rolled onto his side and forced himself into a fitful sleep.
Percy looked to Minister Shacklebolt in panic.  This was escalating quickly.  The dark skinned man signaled his secretary with a reassuring hand.  He’d strategized and fought alongside the witch in the Order of the Phoenix.  She could handle herself just fine.
Radomir turned towards the frosted edge of the Great Lake and sighed fondly. “Besides, it reminds me of home.”
Minerva stared at the grinning man blankly for a moment as she tried to regain composure. “Ah, fair enough.”
So I'm still figuring out how I should warn and tag as I go and I just want to throw it out there that this chapter deals with dissociation and panic attacks if that isn't your thing.
“Of course! Tulip would be honoured!” Harry yelped as the much tinier elf yanked him towards an empty counter. “Harry must sit while Tulip fetches his tea!” He opened his mouth to protest but the determined look on her face had him quickly closing it.  He instead reached for a step stool and took a seat.
The bastard had some nerve.  Minerva brought the forgotten tea to her lips so she wouldn’t be tempted to chuck the porcelain at the infuriating man’s head.  “You think me for a fool if I’m going to be swayed by glory and riches Mr. Tuft.”
“Why are you being so stubborn, darling the best way to get over a bad relationship is to have a good hard fuck, trust me.” She smiled her lightly glossed lips glinting delicately in the romantic lighting. She had changed over the years, soften her look. She was deceptively approachable with her expertly cut hair, feminine light pink robes and soft make up. Deep down Pansy was a vicious and jaded viper who protected her friends fiercely, her hatred for Harry more intense than ever. It had taken Draco nearly a year to mend the bridge that had been destroyed between them when he had started dating Harry. She hated the man on principal and refused to relent, but she had missed him as much as he had missed her and eventually she had come around as she always did. However, whenever Harry had been around her eyes sharped and her demeanor changed, while she had wanted to keep her friendship with Draco, Pansy had refused to accept the Boy Who Lived and with good reasons she was fond of reminding Draco every chance she got.
Across the garden form the gazebo Narcissa and Hermione sipped their tea and watched Draco blowing bubbles for the little girl as she ran around popping them.
“That’s right little one, I had to go away for a while but I’m back and I am going to spend as much time as I can with both you and Teddy” Draco promised as he pressed a kiss to the top of Aurora’s head. They stayed in that position for a few quiet minutes just enjoying being in each other’s company once again. Then in the usual four-year-old fashion Aurora jumped out of Draco’s arms and started running circles around him and begging him to do the fun bubble charm with his wand.
“Come on mate, lets celebrate.” Blaise said tugging at Draco’s sleeve to get his attention. “Don’t try anything stupid like chasing after him you can very easily lose visitations with your daughter.” Blaise whispered close enough that no one else could hear him.
“Any messages? Non case related of course.” Draco asked avoiding the elephant in the room, even if he was reinstated he wasn’t sure he wanted to continue working at the Ministry. It would be too hard as a prosecutor he would be in constant contact with the Auror department and being so close to Harry and loving him from afar was a torture he was not keen to repeat.
“Why do you do that to yourself?” Blaise’s concern voice broke though Draco’s dark thought and the blonde looked up at his childhood friend with red rimmed eyes and despair clear.
“Merlin’s bear! Harry what the hell? You just apparated right through the wards!” Ron snapped, holding his chest trying to calm down his heart. When he saw Harry’s face he quickly walked to his friend and put a hand on his shoulder. “What’s happened?”
“And you don’ think I’m going to get custody, I already know that Blaise. I might be her father but he gave birth to her, he’s the Savior, and the golden boy while I’m just a lowly ex Death Eater that tricked the Boy Who Lived.” Draco said his voice devoid of emotions. His mother had tried to hide the newspapers and shield him from the cruel gossip and speculations of the Prophet but he had seen some of the stories of how he had cursed Harry Potter into falling for him. In a way the stories had more truth to them than even the clueless Rita Seeker could ever know, the only thing no one wanted to acknowledge was that Draco had been cursed as well. That in reality he was the real victim and Potter nothing more than a casualty of a twisted revenge.
“Yes well now I have another reason to cross paths with Malfoy.” The universe was conspiring against him. Draco Malfoy was Snape’s only living heir.
“Alright Mr. Malfoy, lets just get down to business so we can all moved on with our day.” Wheeler summoned parchment and a self writing quill ready to jot down their every word. “Can you please state your full name and occupation for the record.”
Harry still remembered sitting at his desk at the Auror bullpen, typing up back up reports because his magic had beed too unstable to do any filed work. The boredom he felt at the time had been worth it, Draco’s reaction at his gift had been more than Harry had ever hoped for. The ex Slytherine had tear up! The last time Draco had cried in front of anyone had been the night Aurora had been born. He had been tempted to drag his deliciously ruffled body back to bed and ride him for all he was worth, but he knew Draco had an important appointment that morning and he had to be the mature one, gods knew Draco wouldn’t be. That did not stop Harry however from fantasying about all the naughty things he would do to the icy blond that weekend, Draco had planned it so they would be away in a place he said no one would disturb them for three whole days. Harry was nearly giddy from the anticipation, he couldn’t remember the last time he and Draco had had an entire weekend to themselves or had gone away on holiday for that matter and the cunning Slytherine would not tell him where they were going. It was part of his anniversary gift Draco had said.
The doors of the Great Hall swept open with a loud clang. Both men whipped their head towards the noise of Hermione’s brisk steps thundering through the hall.
Ginny’s voice was raspy as she coughed out, “Merlin’s saggy ballsack, Ron!” The witch paused to wipe stray droplets of pumpkin juice from her mouth. “Warn a girl before you start talking about your sex life at breakfast!”
“It’s already as worse as it can get Blaise, I haven’t seen my daughter in almost six weeks, I’m under investigation by the ministry and I just had an owl deliver divorce papers.” Actually the owl had been what prompted Draco to relieve the last morning of happiness he had had six weeks earlier, the morning Harry had given him the ring and he had helped Aurora prepare for her weekend with her grand-mere. How he missed the little imp with her bright green eyes and silvery blonde curls. Draco could feel tears rolling down his face again and he tried to control himself, how Lucius must be rolling in his grave right at that moment.
"The Unspeakable said that the love spell had been mild and only lasted three days. Everything after that had been my own actions." Harry said out loud to no one in particular. Three days, that was all, and his feelings had been overwhelming for the entirety of the relationship. Once he had stopped being snappy with Draco he had started to flirt with the blonde, started joking with him and actively seeking him out. Harry remembered volunteering to run down to Draco's office to drop off case files, bringing coffee with him and staying longer than necessary just talking to him, staring at his beautiful mouth and wanting to kiss the blonde with every breath he took. It hit him then that he didn't kiss Draco until after the spell had faded. For those three days all he did was follow his former nemesis around the ministry He didn't kiss him until nearly two weeks later and asked him on a date later still.
Harry carefully caressed the slight muscles of Draco's exposed back and placed gentle kisses along the curves of his spine. Draco shuddered as Harry slowly kissed him lower and lower, eventually spreading Draco's perfectly tight round ass and looking longingly at the puckered pink ring. Harry licked and kissed and made love to Draco's ass with his tongue, lips, and mouth savoring every moment and every moan that escaped Draco's mouth until he couldn't take it anymore.
“Papa, can I ask you a question?” Rory finally asked tentatively as Draco guided the four year old to sit in her favorite spot under the large willow tree next to the pond in the back gardens of Malfoy Manor. Hermione had brought Aurora to the manor after breakfast for their first supervised visitation, after the first ten minutes of hugs and kisses from both Draco and Narcissa they had moved outside to the garden for tea and biscuits where the little girl had excitedly explained all she had been doing for the past several months, the little one was so animated that the warming charms Draco cast over her seemed pointless. The moment was extremely bittersweet for Draco. While he was bursting with happiness at being able to see and touch Aurora for the first time in months, listening to the little imp made him realized how much he had missed.
“I think we have enough of what we need for the investigation, please sign and date your written statement.” He then turned to the meek looking Healer and signaled her. “Thank very much for your cooperation Mr. Malfoy, Healer Lovell will be removing the memories that pertain to this case only.” It all sounded great in the surface but Draco’s legal Slytherin mind demanded to know more.
“The entire world thinks I’ve cursed Harry Potter, Pansy. The only thing they want from me is my head on a platter.”
“Why are you here?” Draco asked, wiping his roughened hands down his face and getting up from the hard floor. He knew he was pathetic and didn’t need Blaise to point it out for him. But how could they expect him to snap out of it, when he had had everything he had dreamt of since laying eyes on the scrawny eleven year old Potter. And now it had been cruelly snatched away and left him to die of heartbreak.
“Harry,” Hermione said quietly as she entered the small guest room, she had intended to say goodnight to her forlorn friend and leave him be. Ron had warned her that meddling at a time like this would be a horrible idea but her resolve quickly evaporated as she saw her friend, gently caressing Aurora’s blonde hair with tears freely streaming down his face. He didn’t seem to notice anything but the sweet little girl who slumbered peacefully on the center of the full sized bed. “Harry.” Hermione said again with a little more force, this time getting his attention. He quickly dried his tears with his free hand and straighten to look at her, what she saw in his eyes nearly brought her to tears on the spot. He was the definition of despair as he sat next to his daughter face contorted in pain.
All those memories had been clear with no distortions at all. He had seen himself lust openly over the former Slytherin and face the public about his sexuality and choice of partner. He had been himself when he had faced down the Weasleys' about his intentions to date Draco. He had willingly ended friendships and severed relations to be with Draco. The consuming passion and encompassing love came solely from him not from a spell or potion, not from a curse.
Harry slumped on top of the blonde nearly crushing him as they both laid perfectly still unable to move as they tried to catch their breath, panting and exhausted with the after shock of their orgasms still lingering. Once he was able to move again Harry kissed Draco’s neck lovingly where his teeth had left small bruises, but no mark. He wanted to mark Draco when they were both conscious of their actions and not seduced by the pleasures of their bodies or the allure of Draco’s Veela seeking out its mate.
“What are you talking about?” Draco said not really paying much attention as he poured himself a steaming mug of tea, he knew he shouldn't have listen to Blaise. Now he was suffering from a hangover and feeling completely ridiculous for having imbibed so much the night before, even if it was a celebratory dinner. He could practically hear Lucius’s disapproving tone, ‘Malfoy’s do not become intoxicated in public’
“‘I hope you will always know the meaning of true love.’” Harry read the note out loud a small smile forming on his face, it wasn’t signed but Harry recognized the elegant handwriting and knew right away that it was from his husband. Ron made a gagging sound good naturelly and leaned forward a little closer to Harry’s desk curios about the small parcel.
“Fuck, Fuck, Fuck…I need you inside me right now, Harry please I need you to fuck me right now.” Draco begged and demanded all at once, Harry knew exactly what the blonde liked and he used all that knowledge as he seduced his lover back into his arms once again. Harry positioned himself at Draco’s entrance and pushed in slowly, mindful of how tight Draco felt after weeks of celibacy, he was too tight and Harry had to bite down hard on his bottom lip so he wouldn’t come prematurely.  Draco’s heat was pure heaven, the tightness welcoming as he dived a little deeper giving Draco some time to adjust to the invasion. “You need to fucking move!”
“How are you Madge,” He said sitting behind his desk and rubbing his temple trying to alleviate some of the throbbing.
“My point is that you have no sex life Draco, you’re young, successful, and sexy as hell now that you don’t glue your hair to you’re scalp. Oh and don’t forget fabulously rich, there are so many wizards and witches just dying for their shot at you.” Draco rolled his eyes at her again, if all the hate mail and howlers he had received since the Prophet’s piece on how he cursed the Boy Who Lived where anything to go by those shots she spoke of would most likely be fatal.
Draco and Harry had started dating when Teddy was nearly five years old and the little boy had been a staple in Draco’s life ever since. He had grown to love impish child as if he were Teddy’s father as well, not being able to see him was another harsh blow dealt by Harry. Draco looked back towards Harry’s table, silently watching as Harry’s lawyer leaned down and whispered something to him. Harry nodded stiffly and pinched the bridge of his nose, something Draco knew he did when highly agitated.
“Draco, you can’t just sit in this big house and waste away. Getting back to work will be a good thing for you, besides you are a brilliant solicitor and honestly you were just wasting your talents working for the ministry.” Blaise continued. Draco turned to look at his friend for the first time since his school days and wished he had fallen the devilishly handsome wizard in front f him instead of pinning for the impossibility of Harry Potter’s love. Had he taken Blaise up on his offer of love and companionship during their eighth year at Hogwarts, things would have turned out different for him, Goyle would have had to find a different way to enact his revenge.
“Yes.” Harry answered, holding back the trembling of his voice. There was no use in crying anymore, he was in the wrong and he would fix it somehow. He had to because with Draco Harry had found the happiness and family life he had craved since he was a lonely miserable child with the Dursley’s.
Harry looked around the library at Spinner’s End where most of the dark artifacts in the home were located. He and Ron had performed a diagnostic spell to match the list of dangerous artifacts and nothing came up missing yet the place had been ransacked, chairs and tables turned over, most of the books were thrown across the library floor along with parchments and other nicknacks that had once belonged to Professor Snape. Obviously the intruder had been searching for something specific and had trashed the entire house in the pursuit.  Nothing seemed to have been taken but Harry knew it would take weeks to sort everything out.
“Well you still have your license and and you know the doors are always opened for you at Malfoy, MacDougal and Burke. It still belongs to your family.” Draco knew he sounded bitter, but the truth of the matter was that he was bitter and angry and falling apart. He lost the love of his life, his beautiful daughter and a job he had worked so hard to earned with the ministry prosecution. Blaise was right he needed to do something to distract himself.
Harry couldn't take it anymore and pulled his head out of the pensive, his own eyes moist with unshed tears. Draco didn't do it. He had been telling the truth the whole time and Harry had pushed him away, accusing him of lying and being low and conniving. He felt his heart break a little as he thought back at everything he had said and done to Draco for the past two months.
“I don’t know if you can or not, but you may ask anything sweetheart” said Draco. Rory rolled her eyes at him and giggled, visibly relaxing a little as she continued head on just like her daddy would. Draco looked at her adorable little face and his heart constricted with love for his daughter.
“Just answer me one question Hermione, why? Why did he do this?” He said voice raspy from crying and disuse, the first two weeks he had locked himself in the tiny room and refused to see anyone. Not even little Aurora who had been sent to spend that time with Molly and Arthur, shielded from the reality of what was happening to her parents.
“Harry, some one dropped this off for you downstairs.” Ron said through a huge bite of his sandwich as he dropped a small parcel wrapped in brown paper on Harry’s desk. “Who’s it from?” Harry picked it up cautiously and ran a few tests on the package making sure it wasn’t dangerous. When he was satisfied he looked at the delicate pink card attached to it.
Harry decide to ignore the pointy git and his blatant flirting with Nott, what Draco Malfoy did these days was absolutely none of Harry’s business. That was the beauty of breaking up, Harry no longer cared what Draco did or in this instance whom he did. That’s what he told himself as he tore his gaze from the Slytherin table and tried to focus on what Hermione was saying in regards to their potions class. The class he had spend staring a hole into the back of Malfoy’s head and praying he would look back and make eye contact with him, of course Draco ignored him as if he was invisible and worked diligently with his new potions partner, Theodore Fucking Nott.
“My apologies mother, I should to go floo Blaise about this, see if we can get the Prophet off my back and then I’m off to the ministry for my interview with the Aurors.” Draco sighed as he kissed the back of his mother’s hand and left the kitchen holding his tea in one hand and the paper in the other. The day promised to be a miserable one and he wanted to make sure he was prepared for all possible outcomes. All Draco could hope for was that this new development did not make things with Harry worse than they already were, if that was even possible
“I tripped on the way out of the restaurant Blaise was just helping me up, there was no kiss. No inappropriate behavior whatsoever.” Draco reassured her as his heart sank, the last thing he needed at the moment was the Prophet’s brand of garbage circulating in the Wizarding world, his reputation already in tatters Rita Seeker’s slander would only make things more difficult for him. “Besides Harry made it rather clear to me that he no longer wants anything to do with me. He won’t care if I’m off shagging every warm body in London.”
“I don’t know Harry, I’m baffled by what is happening. I truly believed he loved you.” Hermione said holding back her own tears, it was true. She had seen them together and believed that for Draco the sun risen and set with Harry, then to find out that their lives together had been nothing more than a cruel trick, a curse it just didn’t make any sense.
Draco was in a different world, enjoying every last one of Harry's touches and responding with enthusiasm. He was ready. So was Harry. He positioned himself behind Draco and pulled down his pants and underwear in one swift motion. Harry murmured the necessary spell and his fingers slicked with lube, he had preferred the real thing but there was no time for that now. His slicked his cock, at the same time as he lightly slapped Draco’s ass with his free hand. Watching the blooming rose spread on the tender skin.
“Harry no, not right now. ‘Mione brought Rory to the manor. He hasn’t seen his daughter in a long time. Let them have this moment before you go after him.” Ron said a serious look on his face. His best friend had matured so much after the birth of his daughter, Harry wished he could say the same of himself. They both turned to the pecking of an owl at the large living room window. Ron held his hand up and let the bird in, taking the package from the elegant bird and offering it a treat. Once the bird flew away, Ron walked back to his spot on the living room and presented Harry with the post.  “It’s for you.”
Harry grew impatient but was also amused at seeing Draco grasping for control and being unable to regain it.
“It was all a lie and then he waited for the opportune time to snatch it all away. And tomorrow I take control of my life again, the divorce papers should be in Malfoy Manor by now and if I have my way he will never see Aurora ever again. You know how important heirs are to Malfoys’” Hermione gasped, appalled at his words.
Draco looked surprised his grey eyes widening slightly before he schooled his features back in to that damn Malfoy mask, Harry thought he was done with that look. It had taken him nearly six months after they had started having clandestine meetings to thaw the ice Malfoy mask. As soon as he entered the room and locked the door behind himself Harry felt it once again. Draco’s magic humming around him calling to Harry, making his blood boil with need.
“Good, good. Lets skip the useless questions and get to the point, did you create the curse Auror Potter was under until recently?” Draco thought about the question he was just asked carefully as he bit down on the urge to answer truthfully right away. After Harry had been taken to St. Mungo’s and Draco had been informed of what had happened he knew right away what the red stone had been, he had cursed the object nearly ten years earlier during his torturous sixth year at Hogwarts. Begrudgingly his lips opened and the answer was ripped from him against his will.
“You know Rita Seeker prints nothing but rubbish, just focus on what you want to do next. No matter what don’t make it worse.”
“Alright Mr. Malfoy just have a seat and relax.” Auror Wheeler a tall man with tousled black hair and kind blue eyes motioned Draco towards the plain table in the corner of the interrogation room. Draco did as he was asked anxious to finally get his side of the story out, even if at this point it didn’t fix his problems with Harry it would help clear the cloud of suspicion that followed him wherever he went. “We apologize that it has taken so long to have this interview but as you know Auror Potter’s magic, until recently was too unstable for these proceedings.”
Harry got up and used his fingers to spread Draco's already wet and loosened entrance, as much as he wanted to keep making Draco quiver with his tongue, hearing Draco call out his name in the throws of passion once again nearly brought Harry to his knees. Draco spread his legs further apart in anticipation, trust and willingness clear in his movements. Harry loved seeing Draco like this, bent over a desk in an empty classroom, naked and longing for Harry’s dick in his ass. Harry put two fingers in Draco's hole, gently at first and then scissoring and spreading it apart, getting it ready for his bulging cock. He knew he should slow down and prepare Draco properly but he couldn’t take the sweet torture much longer.
“Harry, Harry are you listening to me?” Hermione asked waving her hand in his face distracting him from the torture chamber his mind had created for him the past two weeks. “Honestly you two, how on earth do you plan to pass Potions when neither of you can pay attention for longer than three minutes.” She huffed in frustration and both he and Ron bowed their heads in shame, she was just trying to help them. Harry vowed that he would focus on Hermione and only Hermione for the duration of dinner, he was doing great too until he heard that sexy low chuckle once again and did what was now an automatic action, turned to stare at Draco.
“I just don’t know why he did it? What was the point?” Harry said to Hermione breaking free of the haunting memories.
Hey guys sorry it took me so long to get this up, I do have this story on a different website but I'm rewriting a lot of it so its a bit different.
Draco made a mewling sound in protest pressing his body closer to Harry's. With the little bit of sanity, he had left Harry pulled Draco's pants down and sank to his knees in front of the blonde wanting nothing more but to taste him. The sight of Draco half naked and looking thoroughly debauched was glorious, Draco’s long cock was beautiful, pink, thinly veined and weeping from need. It had been too long for Harry and he hoped for Draco also.
So sorry this is taking so long, I am buried under school work. In fact i'm supposed to be doing homework but the story took over. next chapter already finished just need to edit!!
He could almost picture the blonde rushing about the bedroom, because he had overslept or because instead of getting ready he had pulled Harry into bed with him and performed every wicked act his dirty mind could come up with. Harry sobbed, crushed under everything he had lost by his own doing. He had to speak to Draco, to try and put the pieces of their lives back together but he was too ashamed to face his ex husband. Another loud sob escaped his lips at the realization that Draco no longer belonged to him, that he had tossed him out of his life and tried to take their daughter from him. How could he ever ask Draco to forgive him when he had done the unforgivable, had the tables been turn Harry had no idea how he would survive without his daughter? Without Teddy? Harry cried himself to sleep in the bed he once shared with the man he still loved, he would fix things between them, he had to for Aurora’s sake but also for his own. Without Draco he hadn’t been living, just coasting through the days trying to convince himself he would be all right again, when all he wanted was to have his family together again. The family he had single handedly destroyed by jumping to conclusion and believing Draco to be false, gods how that had hurt, it had sliced through his heart mercilessly. The idea that it all been a lie, that Draco didn’t truly love him that it just been some twisted sick trick, a curse. He had to fix everything, put the broken pieces of his life back together he just had no idea how to begin or if the jagged edges that were left would fit back into their proper place.
“I did, whole heartedly, but this incident made me realize that it wasn’t just his friends that mistrusted Draco but Harry himself.”
“Just a few personal letters that I was going to forward today.” She said leaving the office. She came back shortly with a strong cup of coffee and a stack of letters, he gave her a grateful smile and took a much needed sip of the rich hot liquid. Once he was alone Draco looked through his pile of letters, nothing too interesting. A few invitations to dinners, an angry letter from Pansy and a blank envelope. He put Pansy’s letter aside for later not really in the mood for her hysterics and opened the envelope inside there was a short note written in block letters, just one sentence yet it made Draco shiver with foreboding.
Draco stubbornly remained silent and his eyebrows knitted together in anger. A little thrill coursed though his body, he loved that Draco would not give in without a fight.
“I promise. I love you, sweetheart. Be a good girl for your daddy and I’ll see you soon.” He watched Aurora hug her grandmother and waved as she and Hermione got into the floo, and then she was gone in a flush of green smoke leaving him feeling empty inside.
Harry decided to floo to the flat they shared until recently. The cozy cramped space looked bleak in the dark, dust settled on every surface, the silence giving it a haunted appearance. It was the first time he stepped foot in his home in two months and the memories assailed him immediately leaving Harry overwhelmed with emotion, memories of Draco trying to figure out how to make tea, of both of them trying to fit all of Draco’s things into the small space, memories of the happiness they shared, the sex in practically every room in the place, discovering they were pregnant. With a wave of his wand, the lights in the flat switch on, illuminating the cozy flat.
“So what you are saying is that you are responsible for creating the cursed object but not for casting the actual curse?” The Auror asked somewhat skeptically, Draco didn’t blame the man for doubting his story. After all Love Curses could only be cast with strong passion.
“You expecting someone else?” Harry’s anger predictably raising to the bait. The blonde just stared for a moment, quietly calling to Harry with his eyes. Harry remembered the moments when he had known of Draco’s need from a mere look. Those moments were long gone, it seemed but here and now there was a look that left no room for confusion. It lasted only a split second but it was enough for Harry to know that Draco wanted him as much as Harry wanted Draco.
“Bye Papa,” Aurora said with tears in her eyes, the two hour visit had come to an end and Hermione had gathered the little girl.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, Ministry of Magic Prosecutor.” The quill scribbled furiously making small scratching noises against the parchment.
Malfoy quickly composed his face back into the cold stare he had taken to giving Harry lately but it was too late. Harry had seen that Draco wanted him. He saw his opportunity and knew he had an advantage. He didn't hesitate to press it. Harry looked at Malfoy intently and made his way over to the desk where he sat, his look frozen in his face as Harry came closer. It wasn't often that Draco relinquished control of their private moments but Harry had had enough of being rebuffed and ignored, their relationship treated as if it had been a figment of Harry’s imagination. Draco’s blatant flirting and using his allure on others, enough was enough.
“Ok now you are over estimating that Bitch Seeker’s reach and credibility, besides now that you’re a dark wizard again you are even sexier.” She persisted, Draco knew she would continue to push him towards dating and sex even if it killed her.
“You would know.” Blaise laughed as he took a bite of his creme brûlée, his eyes half closing as the sugary confections invaded his taste buds.
Draco couldn’t help the unnatural need to speak, to spill all his deep dark secrets to the people in the room and his inner Slytherin rebelled against it. He could feel a few beads of sweat tickling down his forehead and his heart beating erratically, it was the first time he had been hit with such a strong dose of veritaserum. The healer checked his vitals and declared him ready to be interviewed.
“We might be able to get you visitation rights depending on who’s hearing the case, but Draco you must be prepared for the worst. I’m truly sorry.” Once again Draco could hear the sincerity in his friends voice, Blaise and Pansy were the only ones that truly knew the depth of his pain, they were the only ones that knew the whole truth behind the wizarding world’s latests scandal.
"Tell me." Harry said again, unclasping Draco's robes behind his neck and kissing the soft flesh that appeared. "Tell me..." Harry whispered, nibbling and circling with his tongue the spot on Draco’s neck that would forever carry Harry’s mark after tonight. Draco shuddered under Harry's touch and his lips parted slightly as his breath started to become shallow and labored with want. Harry pulled his lips away from Draco's skin for a moment, unwilling to continue unless he heard what he wanted to hear. It was a battle of wills but Harry's had always been stronger.
“What was the purpose of said curse?” Draco nearly rolled his eyes at the question, everyone knew the purpose of the curse it had been in the papers within seconds of the Unspeakables testing the stone.
“Of course. Tell me, Hermione, are you strictly following court orders or do you believe my son deserves to see his daughter? He is innocent of all charges he’s been accused of as of late.” Narcissa put down her tea cup carefully keeping her eyes on Hermione the entire time. Hermione tried not to squirm under the stare, she was a grown woman and would not be intimidated for Merlin’s sake.
“I never saw the stone again after I cursed it, not until it was send to Harry nearly two months ago.”
Harry watched as Theo leaned in to Draco and whispered something in the blonde’s ear, his lips nearly touching Draco’s earlobe as his hand touched Draco’s shoulder and rubbed slow lazy circles. Harry noted the pretty blush that crept up Draco’s neck at whatever the dark haired wizard had said, Draco nodded his head and smiled seductively at Theo. Harry’s cup filled with pumpkin juice shattered in his hand drawing the attention of those sitting close to him.
“A little over ten years ago, I was sixteen and a student at Hogwarts.” Draco said answering more than he had been asked, and all he wanted was to ripped his own tongue out.
"That's correct, the only thing we can tie Mr. Malfoy to is of creating the curse. He doesn't see the stone again after that night. The last time he remembers it, is while he put it in a small vault in his room. After that his memories are of the war, of fearing that you had been hurt, and of lying to Death Eaters about your identity..."
“How is that even possible?” Ron asked forgetting Harry’s problem for a moment. The fact that someone could break in to Spinner’s End which had been sealed off and reinforced by the ministry until the estate could be settled in private. Whoever broke into Spinner’s End had to have been an uncommonly powerful witch or wizard.
"Look at me." Harry barely recognized the voice escaping from his lips. It was deeper and more magnified, mixed with the passionate power that coursed through his body. Draco looked up at Harry, seemingly in spite of himself and his piercing grey eyes read nervousness, and desire, but also stubbornness and anger. Harry held Draco's face in his hands, determined to pause a moment to try and rectify the pain they had inflicted on each other, but he felt the familiar pull of Draco's charm begin to work on him.
“I could never be angry with you mon petit ange.” He reassured her, soothing her fears and cursing himself and Harry for causing their daughter anxiety. She was just four years old and the whole nasty manner should had never reached her, he had swore he would be a different father to his children than his own had been to him, yet here was his little girl suffering because if his actions. His heart harden a little towards Harry, how could they both had allowed this mess to touch their children.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Draco sneered quickly recovering from his shock. Hearing the harsh words coming from Draco’s lips hurt like hell, so he was Potter once again.
“I told Teddy he was wrong, I told him you were not mad at us you just had to go away for a little bit right, Papa?” He could see her spirit lift slightly as she hugged him back resting her messy blond curls on his chest, over his breaking heart.
Harry pick up the package, weariness written in his face as he ran diagnostic spells in the post making sure nothing dangerous had been delivered. He saw the package came from the office of Solicitor Blaise Zabini, the name bringing a frown to Harry’s face. Harry opened the package to find the divorce papers neatly stacked. A quick glanced showed that Draco had signed in all the appropriate places. Harry’s heart beat faster as an ensuing panic gripped him. It was there in black and white in front of him. It was his freedom, what he had asked for, and all Harry wanted to do was tear the dam papers to shreds. With the papers was a small envelope with his name on it. Fingers shaking, he opened it and saw a small note in Draco’s elegant script.
“See you in an hour Princess.” Draco huffed with indignation, how dare they suggest he took long to ready himself. After he started dating Harry, Draco had cut back on pampering considerably since the man had been unbelievably impatient.
“In that case M’Lords, Auror Potter requests that the supervision be done by someone of his choosing.”
At the end of the note there was a skeleton key attached with a mild sticky charm. He was a complete arsehole and he only hoped it wasn’t too late to fix things with Draco.
Draco caught Harry’s death glare as he and his solicitor quickly left the courtroom. Draco allowed himself to be dragged out of the courtroom through opposite exit. How he wanted to chase after Harry and make him listen, but he knew it would be useless. Harry Potter was the most stubborn person he had ever met and until he was ready to talk Draco knew there was no getting through to his soon to be ex husband. The pathetic truth was that Draco was willing to wait for Harry for as long as it took. He would do anything to get Harry back, his pride be damned.
“Alright, Ron.” Harry chuckled and ripped the brown paper to find a blood red stone encased in a glass box. Harry looked at it confused, he had no idea what he was looking at. He opened the glass and the moment he touched the stone it began to glow and burn his hand. Harry could feel a surge of dark magic coursed through his body, blood rushed to his head making his ears ring painfully and spread to his body. Harry lead out a hoarse cry and doubled over as his body boiled from the inside out, for a moment he thought he would die from the blinding pain. Then it was gone as quickly as it had started and it left behind the worse emotional that Harry had ever felt in his life.
Draco just stared, not sure what to do. Throughout their relationship there had never been a time when he wasn't in total control. Since the first kiss, his Veela had manipulated the Gryffindor. Maneuvered and lured the shorter boy into doing exactly what Draco wanted without any resistance from Harry. However, tonight was different. He needed to claim Draco and the only way he would do that was to show the Veela that he was just as powerful and commanding as the blonde.
“I do not know.” Wheeler knitted his brows and the corners of his full lips turned down slightly in a confused frown.
“Please call me Narcissa, how many years now have we been interacting in the same circles?” Narcissa turned to watch the young woman carefully, her blue gaze intense all softness gone from her face.
“Are you angry with me Papa?” Her big green eyes looked vulnerable as she stared up at him determined to know the truth no matter what that would be. A future Gryffindor, perhaps, she was brash and brave already. Her words hurt him beyond belief and he crushed the little girl in a too-tight hug, to reassure them both that was all as it should be.
“Maybe so, but can you explain this photograph? Draco what if Harry sees this?” Narcissa said her tone concerned as she slipped her slim hand into Draco’s larger one.
"Auror Potter, as you can see the summation of my investigation is that Solicitor Malfoy, while he broke the law by creating the cursed object, did not in fact curse you." Auror Wheeler informed Harry as he too removed his head from the pensive. The Auror had shown Harry professional curtesy and allowed him to see his findings before anyone else. "However, there is no doubt in the mind of the Unspeakable that tested you after you were admitted into St. Mungo's that early on in your courtship of Mr. Malfoy that you were indeed under the influence of a love spell." Wheeler informed him, like Harry needed reminding of the embarrassing fact that he had allowed a mild gag of a spell to take hold on him. "Now of course the questions are, who and for what purpose."
“Yes, I created the curse, however, I never cast it on Harry or anyone else. I put the cursed stone in the small personal vault I kept in my dorm at the time.” Draco said willing Harry to believe him with his eyes, he shook his head clearing it slightly. Something was wrong his mind felt wrong, it kept confusing Wheeler with Harry.
“Good, in that case I demand that you take me to an obnoxiously expensive dinner to celebrate this monumental win.” Blaise smiled and Draco couldn’t help but smile back and follow his friend out of the Ministry. Once the investigation in to the curse was concluded and exonerated him Harry would have to listen to him, let him explain his side of the story
After about five seconds of nearly hyperventilating and firmly putting his wand away Harry swung the classroom door opened and was surprised to find Draco sitting at a desk carefully placing parchment and quill in front of him.
“No. Please do not lie. You Gryffindors are terrible at it. None of you can shake the image of his youthful self and indiscretions. I just wished all of you to consider the fact that as a child he didn’t have a chance to develop his own personality. Lucius was a harsh man who ruled with an iron fist and until his death neither Draco nor I had the freedom to just be ourselves and not the versions we had developed to please him.” Narcissa let go of Hermione’s hand and turned back to watch her son and granddaughter, having apparently had her say. The conversation left Hermione feeling lost and uncomfortable yet she had to admit that to some extent Narcissa had been right.
“Let’s just drop it, we have a new case.” Harry said pointing at the files he had unceremoniously dropped on their joined desks. “There was a break in at Spinner’s End. Robards wants us to go check it out.”
The place looked exactly as it had that morning when he kissed Draco goodbye, the air around them filled with promise, Aurora’s toys piled to the side of their shabby couch, one of her socks tucked in the middle cushion. Draco’s black scarf and umbrella, still on the coat rack, a white mug on the coffee table. Harry looked at the pictures on the fireplace mantle, a mix of muggle and wizard photographs. In all they looked so happy, always smiling, touching or kissing. Harry walked around the flat picking up tea cups, toys and discarded things, setting their too small home to rights, something he had done a million times over the years. Once he had cleaned up and dusted the flat, Harry laid his head down on Draco’s favorite down pillow it still smelled of his expensive shampoo even though the scent had quite faded with time.
“Your mother called me, she’s scared that you might try to harm yourself.” Blaise said with rare honesty, sitting on one of the plush library chairs by the roaring fire in the room. Of course his mother had called reinforcements, lately all she did was lay eyes on him and burst into tears herself. He couldn’t blame her, like him she had lost a great deal and was afraid of losing the only thing she had left.
“I...” Ron started a deep flush on his face, but Harry put his hand up and silenced his best friend, what was the point of continuing on that conversation. Everyone seemed so willing to give Draco the benefit of the doubt, even Ron but the only reason they were so opened minded was because they had not been the one lied to, manipulated and cursed! They had not been the one who loved the man with a desperate passion that wouldn’t go away, and that was the crux of the matter, Harry couldn’t stop loving Malfoy. He tried very hard to hate him, but he just missed Draco, he missed him with every fiber of his being. He missed waking up next to him in their cramped flat, Rory and Teddy barging in to their bedroom in the mornings. He missed the chaotic family life they had shared, sitting down by the fire at night after the kids were in bed and just being held by Draco. Harry missed being loved by his husband and it was killing him to know it had all been a lie. Draco never really loved him, their entire relationship had been a magical curse.
Harry released a blissful sigh as he relieved himself.  He leaned against the cold bathroom title mainly out of necessity since he didn’t trust his balance but he couldn’t deny the brief adrenaline rush from the temperature change was the exact thing he needed to regain the rest of his consciousness.
Soon after, the school heads said their goodbyes. Olympe gathered her things and left with a joyous “ta ta.” Minerva and Radomir were alone together once more.
“Please,” he stood on tiptoe to get a better grip on the witch’s hand, “call me Radomir.”  He lifted Olympe’s hand to his lips. “May I?”
Neville was talking to himself. “Alright, three for Ron, two for me, one for Hermione or Harry, just in case.”  He carefully wrapped the food up before putting it in his bag.  He went to grab Harry’s right shoulder. “Ready.”
“Good,” Ron said with an affirmative nod of his head.  He looked up at Neville. “You heard the man. Ready when you are, Nev.”
The guest quarters had been Filius’ idea. In between classes and the duties of being headmistress, all Minerva had done was stew over the ink drying on Ministry contract after contract of this bone-headed endeavor.  Working alongside the charms professor in her element was the distraction she needed.
They ate quietly and soon Minerva was absentmindedly swirling her spoon in her abandoned cup of tea as she tried to find her words. A frustrated sigh left her mouth.  It would better to just rip off the bandage quickly.  She gently cleared her throat to get the attention of her two companions. “I must thank you for meeting with me on such short notice. It’s been a struggle since the tournament’s announcement so I really appreciate it."
Percy cleared his throat nervously.  "Of course."  He cast a quick Tempus and sighed.  “I must get going.”
The headmistress exhaled out of her nose like a dragon as she tried to remain composed.  “Then what was the point of rebuilding the bloody castle and allowing the students back if I’m just going to throw them to the wolves, Kingsley? What was this all for?”  Angry tears pricked at her vision.
Harry jolted up from his bed.  He gripped his bed covers with white knuckle force as he gasped for air.  Sweat and tears blended together on his flushed cheeks.  Trembling fingers combed wildly through his damp matted hair as he regained his bearings.  He pushed off the covers and shakily maneuvered himself into a sitting position, his legs securely crossed beneath him.  His clammy hands hugged his ankles as he began to rock back and forth.  He took deep breaths to try to re-center himself.
It almost felt as if the war hadn’t happened at all, like it was just a nightmare Harry had woken up from.  He couldn’t decide if it was a good thing or not.  So many people had lost their lives, had lost a part of themselves or their family.  To have the wizarding world recover so quickly made him feel slightly hollow.
The quiet authoritative clearing of Professor McGonagall’s throat rattled violently like thunder in Harry’s head.  The remaining crust fell from Harry’s trembling hand as he waited to be lead to slaughter.
“The one and only.” She gave him a playful wink.  One arm was on her hip while the other was relaxed against her side, her hand clinging loosely to her brown leather sandals.  She gestured to the empty spot on Harry’s left.  “May I?”
The broth had been a final promise to Hermione and he betrayed that promise with a tantrum like a fucking toddler.  Harry was disgusted with himself but he didn’t even have the energy to wallow.  So many people tried to help but one by one he denied them with a polite smile feigning normalcy until there was only Ron, Hermione, and sometimes Neville, Luna, and Ginny to deal with him. To deal with the truth that he was a shell of the man that returned to Hogwarts full of cautious hope.  Even then, he continued to deny and deflect because he was supposedly stronger than this, he needed to be.
Kingsley Shacklebolt leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.  He released an exhausted sigh. “I’m so sorry Minerva.  I’ve tried everything but they’ve got the Wizengamot wrapped around their finger. They’ve overruled me every time I’ve objected and requested a re-vote. I’m afraid we’ve ran out of options.”
Despite the wooziness still camping out in his body, he forced himself into clean sweat pants and one of his many trusted oversized hoodies.  He was not one for dramatics, but Harry had an inkling that the only way to remove the stink from the pile of clothes wadded up on the floor was to burn them.  He scratched at his stubbled chin and bent down to grab a fresh pair of socks from his cedar foot chest as well as the plush marigold coloured lion head slippers Luna had given him for his birthday that year.  He slapped a hand against his chest when one of his feet roared.  His heart raced as he clutched his bedframe while he recovered from the scare. Another dizzy spell from his sleep-drunk state chose to sweep through him simultaneously. Harry took a moment to regain himself and grabbed his glasses from his bed side.
Tense fingers pinched at the bridge of Minerva’s spectacles. “So the benefit of wizarding society at large will once again fall on the shoulders of this generation?”
Harry’s shoulders tensed as each step caused a rumbling roar to echo through the empty halls, a trail of angry mutterings from the portraits stirred by the noise left in his wake.  Once he was in a better state of mind, he’d have to ask Luna how to turn off that feature.
The former colleagues were interrupted as the fireplace came to life with a flash of green flame.  Percy stepped out onto the hearth, his hands wringing erratically.  He cleared his throat.  “I regret to inform you that our… guests are running behind and will be here shortly.”
“Harry?” Hermione’s hand traveled across the table and she softly brushed her fingers across his own in concern.  “Is everything alright?”
While much was the same as the previous tournament, the heads of the guest schools staying with their students on the outskirts of the grounds or anchored on the lake, her and Professor Flitwick had merged some of the abandoned classrooms on the first floor into personal quarters for the visiting headmasters.  Overall, they were quite modest so their guests could personalize their space if they so wished.  They each had a small living space as well as an office with connection to the floo network for the day to day tasks of a school head.  The only difference was the colour palate. Radomir’s quarters were adorned with the rich greys and maroons of Durmstrang while Olympe’s was a vision of the Beauxbatons powdered blue and bright pearly whites the Madame adored.
Harry felt like he was floating.  Most of his weight was supported by Ron and Neville, and for that he was grateful.  His legs felt like jelly and his head limply swayed side to side like a pendulum as he was dragged up the stairs to their dorm.
It had a taken a year for the trials and rebuilding to take place.  McGonagall had sent a letter to those who would have completed their Hogwarts education the previous spring to notify them they could return for an “eighth” year and finish properly with N.E.W.T.s in tow.  She had also stated in her letter that eighth year students were allowed to enter the grounds prior to the day of the opening ceremony.  She reasoned that they were all adults and could be trusted to make it back to school as they saw fit.
Minerva followed Radomir’s gaze across the lake.  Bittersweet comfort swept over her as she focused on the snowcapped tree line on the small island of Dumbledore’s tomb.  For all his faults and the choices she vehemently disagreed with over the years, he was still her mentor.
With a grimace, he slid his legs from the heat of his bed to the chilled stone floor.  It felt like he was swimming through treacle as he pushed himself up and stumbled towards the loo.
Harry’s body continued to convulse in despair.  They had almost lost each other so many times along the way, yet there was no guarantee that still couldn’t happen.  Anxiety, sorrow, and rage wove together in his body.  He hugged Hermione even tighter and felt the shorter witch’s muscles flex as she tried not to buckle beneath his weight. She matched his anguished cries with subtle painful sobs of her own.
The world around them faded as the trio stayed nestled together, mourning the loss of a carefree final year.
Harry stretched out his legs and wiggled them to get the blood flowing again before he answered.  “Yeah.”
The headmistress hummed in response.  She folded her hands in her lap as she tried to maintain her composure. “Did it, perhaps, occur to Minister Shacklebolt to deny the proposition regardless?”
Harry’s brain was obviously screaming no, but using a house elf as a stand-in therapist felt wrong.  “Just tired.”
“Harry, do think you can get into bed on your own?”  The soothing timbre of Neville’s voice was just as warm and comforting as the solid weight of his arm holding him upright.
Harry watched as streaks of pale gold began to disperse in the steaming water, much like the guilt streaking through his thoughts.  He brought his hand to his chin and stared deeply into the whirlpool in his tea cup.  The Greek chorus of advice and comfort he’d ignored from the past few months continued to sing sharply in his head:
Soft, muddled dawn light peaked through the foggy windows of the kitchen as Harry sunk further down on the counter. He startled at the feeling of a gentle tug at his knee.  Tulip’s deep onyx eyes bore up at him, her brow furrowed with concern. “Is Harry alright?”
Dujardin was a tall lanky man with strawberry blond hair and hazel eyes.  He appeared to be in his mid to late twenties.  He looked like he was teetering on the edge between man and boy, the sparse wisp of a moustache above his lip only emphasizing that fact.  He stood in indigo robes just a hair too large for his lithe frame.  He looked more like an actor playing the role of a politician rather than the actual politician he supposedly was.
The ginger man shrugged his shoulders. “Well, on the bright side I can test out the guest quarters you and that Flitwick fellow have been working on.”
Not much was known about the new Durmstrang headmaster on this side of the pond.  Radomir Nikiforov’s background seemed to be enveloped in mystery as was his promotion after the murder of Igor Karkaroff towards the start of the war.
It would be naïve to think that from now on Hogwarts would be danger-free, but for the first time since Harry first walked through the mystifying doors at eleven, he felt safe.  There was no dark lord, no prophecy.  It was as freeing as it was intimidating.  He’d been conditioned all his life to brace himself for the next challenge.  Adrenalin and gut instincts were what kept him alive for so long.  To ignore the tingling in his veins at sudden movement, the tensing of his shoulders at the faintest sound, the intense need to check every dark corner twice felt unnatural. Years of battle at such a young age had left their scars on his mind and body, but Harry truly felt like a blank slate. He could finally look towards the future without the incessant need to attach an asterisk of “if.”
The polite smile on his face vanished as Tulip returned to her work. With a soft huff, Harry spooned enough ginger into his cup and poured the boiling water on top. Hermione’s voice began to echo in his head while he stirred his drink.
Minerva and Kingsley shared a silent look. The witch’s body thrummed with anger as she gingerly placed her cup on her desk.  She slid her wire glasses back in place before folding her hands on the desk.  “As you must know, I fought in the war as a member of the Order of the Phoenix.  I refuse to be intimidated, Mr. Tuft.  My decision stands firm.”  She cast a wandless Tempus charm and gave the group of men in her office a pointed look.  Her tone was terse and straightforward. “Now if you excuse me, gentlemen, I have lessons to prepare for.  Good day.”
Harry bit his lip and sighed before nodding yes. Ron returned the nod. His brows slightly furrowed.  The ginger wizard gently leaned across the table and offered, “if it gets to be too much, you can come to me y’know?”
Harry swallowed thickly.  Ron and Hermione had proven themselves to be loyal loving friends ever since he’d met the two at eleven.  Hell, they were family.  He knew he could confide in them about anything and everything yet somehow there was always a guilt when he was completely honest with them.  They all had their own traumas, many of which overlapped with one another’s but he still had this constant nagging thought that he shouldn’t burden them with his problems.
Harry dug the toe of his trainer into the gravel still wrapped up in his thoughts.  Perhaps, it wasn’t a bad thing. Grieving forever was impossible, perhaps even irresponsible.  Maybe it was a sign of strength to press forward in spite of those lost, like the plots of all those Great War documentaries Harry had been forced to watch with the Dursleys.
Harry couldn’t fight the bright smile that stretched across his face as the first years filed in for the Sorting Hat ceremony.  He whooped and cheered for every house, even Slytherin which had a surprisingly large amount of new students all things considered.  After the past few years, house rivalries could wait for quidditch season.  Professor McGonagall had emphasized the importance of unity in her welcoming speech and he was all for it.
There was a sturdy weight pressing into Harry’s side as Ron stretched his freckled scarred arms to envelope the two.  The taller wizard’s modest sniffles were muffled by Harry’s black curls.
The slack in his fatigued body swiftly dissipated at the mention of the Healer.  He began to wrestle out of Hermione’s hold. “No! It’s fine! I’m fine, I just…” Weeks of insomnia and lack of appetite caught up to Harry. He was getting winded and began to slur his words. “Just need to sleep. M’ fine ‘Mione. Really.”
Minerva felt the crack in her stony façade. None of this was fair, none of this was right. “The Ministry has taken it upon themselves to make sure that cannot happen again.”  Bile flirted at the edge of her esophagus while her soft blue eyes watered with unshed tears.  She couldn’t ignore the crack in her voice as she hammered in the final nail of the coffin.  “Much to my deep gnawing regret, they have ruled that entry for all students seventeen and above is mandatory.” It felt like barbwire was strangling Minerva’s heart as her foundation finally crumbled at the horrified gasp of her students. It was a death rattle to her ears. Tears burned down her cheeks as she finished in a broken whisper.  “I’m sorry that I’ve failed you.”
The witch hummed indifferently.  She brought her fingers up to her temples and began to massage them.  What she could really use was a stiff drink, perhaps several, but she still had classes to teach afterwards.
A gentle nudge against his foot forced him out of his thoughts.  He stared at the navy toenails blankly for a moment. “Ginny?”  He unfolded his arms and looked up at the smirking redhead.
“Yes.”  Percy sighed.  “He’s been fighting with the Wizengamot almost daily. However, both Headmaster Nikiforov and Headmistress Maxime have already stated their approval. And now, with the public response, it will be detrimental for him and his policies to reject it.”
“—Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah… I know, you prick.” Ron pinched the bridge of his nose and huffed, his other hand tiredly sliding down the door frame with a pitiful squeak as Neville looked between the two with worried eyes. “Look, Harry—just… Just try to get some sleep and apologize to us later. Yeah?”
McGonagall’s words faded away while Harry’s suspicion only grew deeper as he noticed the tightness at the corner of her lips and small furrow of her brow. He swallowed uncomfortably.
She cleared her throat once more.  “As you know, all throughout the history of the Triwizard Tournament, a witch or wizard’s participation has been voluntary…” Dread seeped into Minerva’s veins as she searched the crowd of students once more.  “That was, however, until last tournament where there was outside interference with the Goblet of Fire.”  Each world felt poisonous on her tongue.
His tears trickled hotly down to his temples as the door closed with a gentle click.  Harry wiped his eyes and maneuvered to his side.  His regret and fatigue merged into quiet sobbing as he curled into fetal position and eventually cried himself into dreamless slumber.
Percy placed his tea on the edge of the desk with faintly trembling fingers.   He cleared his throat nervously.  “Headmistress, this is Rémy Dujardin, Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, and Mortymer Tuft, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.”
Harry slumped against the table in shame while the sounds of Hermione’s footsteps drew further and further away.  He felt the warmth of Neville’s large palm between his shoulder blades. “Alright, Harry?” He could only grumble in response.  The idea of forming words at that point was exhausting.
When that didn't work, he crawled to the side of his bed and pushed away his bed curtains so he could stare out the window.  Harry sighed. Dawn was quickly approaching. The faint light gave hint that the rich green of summer was slowly exchanging hands with autumn as trees became mottled with red, orange, and yellow.  In any other year, the changing of seasons would have brought him a sense of delight.  Even in his darkest times, where the threat of danger loomed, he could find a sense of celebration since there were feasts and holidays to look forward to.  However, as September shifted to early October, Harry could only feel dread.  Each day was just another day counting down towards the hellish circus of the Triwizard Tournament.  Each night was a promise that his nightmares would become more descriptive and violent, more real.  It made him ill just thinking about it.
Ron’s eyes widened in horror.  His face immediately turned into a red gradient as if an artist had dipped their brush into watercolour and swiped it across paper.  He spluttered in embarrassment. “That’s not… I didn’t m—I mean… Well… it’s not like that
“I wanted to thank you Mrs. Granger-Weasley for bringing my granddaughter for this visit.” The older woman said as she held her dainty tea cup delicately in her slim hands. The years had been kind to Narcissa who looked as if time did not dare mar her beauty. With the slight breeze blowing through her blonde hair and her face relaxed in a sweet smile as she watched her son and granddaughter Narcissa was possibly one of the most beautiful women Hermione had ever seen. Yet she still felt slightly uncomfortable around the older witch, never really able to relax and enjoy the other’s company. Perhaps it was the setting or the fact that no matter how valiantly they all tried to forget the past certain things just lingered bitterly in the fringes of the mind.
“What about dinner, Harry you barely touched anything.” She asked concerned, unlike Ron she had noticed his moody withdrawal for the past fortnight and had been watching him nearly as closely as he had been watching Draco.
Headmistress Minerva McGonagall sat rigid in her chair. Rage simmered inside her.  “With all due respect, Mr. Weasley, haven’t these students been through enough?”
Harry’s footsteps were violently percussive against the ancient stone tile.  He ran like he was being hunted.  He needed to hide. He needed to escape.  Wind and static howled in his ears as he forced the front doors open with all his might.  His limbs ached and his lungs burned but he continued to run on the dew slicked grass to wherever safety lied.
Tuft took a deep breath which allowed the blotchy pink to leave his cheeks.  A shark like glimmer flashed in his beady eyes.  “Forgive me for my outburst, Headmistress.  I just feel so passionately about this event.  It has the chance to bring unity to the whole of Wizarding Europe.  Imagine that.  You could go into the history books for this, luv.  Perhaps the Ministry might even be able to contribute more funds to maintain the illustrious reputation of this school from the capital this tournament will bring.”
“That Tuft’s a stubborn bastard.” Radomir crossed his arms across his chest, his thick brows furrowed in indignation. “I even asked if you would prefer to have it at Durmstrang, all things considered, but he wouldn’t have it. He wouldn’t shut up about the rebirth and the glory of Wizarding England like it hasn’t been the top power for centuries!”  His face was mottled red in anger. He huffed and tried to calm himself with a deep breath.  “At least that Rémy fellow
Ginny gently tossed her sandals in the grass before sitting cross-legged beside her ex-boyfriend. They made it work for a while after the war.  They were the Daily Prophet’s golden couple.  “The shining light of young love giving Wizarding England hope for the future,” Rita Skeeter had written.  If you had asked Harry, that would have been better fitted for Ron and Hermione or Seamus and Dean.
The petite elf turned with a gasp, her periwinkle dress made from what appeared to be an upcycled bed sheet fluttering around her plump frame. “Master Potter!”
Dujardin flashed Minerva a toothy grin and had the nerve to take her free hand in his.  “Madame, or should I say mademoiselle?”
Ginny bit her lip and sighed.  “Harry?” She turned to face the bespectacled man and laid a gentle hand on his denim clad knee. “Are we good?”
Sensing the growing tension, Dujardin stepped in to continue the conversation.  “We’ve corresponded about housing for the upcoming year as well as the outline for the semi-finalized tasks,” his eyes darted between Tuft and Minerva, “what are some of your concerns?”
I don't quite know how I feel about this chapter to be honest (Harry sweetie, I'm so sorry) but I'm going to keep on truckin' because things are going to pick up soon, I promise.
Minerva gave her former student a silent nod of her head and watched as the ginger man walked towards the door of her office.  Apprehensive fingers drummed against the rich mahogany as he paused and tentatively turned back around.  “Headmistress?”
“However, I must ask you to notify the Ministry on my behalf that this will be the last Triwizard Tournament Hogwarts will participate in for as long as I am headmistress.”
Harry swirled abstract patterns on the back of Ginny’s hand with his finger.  “Of course. Why wouldn’t we be?"
“Have you now?” Minerva made the mistake of looking back towards Olympe.  The witch’s arched eyebrow was raised in coy investigation, her scarlet lips forming a mischievous smirk.
Ron reached for Harry’s left. “Just so you know—ready, one two three lift—if I weren’t with Hermione, I’d be tempted to kiss you right now, Nev. I can’t believe I slept through lunch. Again.”
There had been two wars within the past twenty years.  Children had been murdered while others had died from magical accidents within her own halls. You were forced to mature so quickly or you risked your life.  What a cruel irony that magical peoples’ lifespans were often longer than muggles when so many witches and wizards were lucky to reach forty.
Well, that was rough to write.  The title of the chapter comes from the song "Not" by Big Thief because it's been harder for me to write Harry but something about that song finally clicked and I had a soundtrack for Harry's angst lol.  I know this chapter is not a fun one but next one should have a little bit more lightness to it since we're finally getting to the introduction of our champions.
Minerva’s veins trickled with ice cold rage.  “I’m well aware, but this is barbaric and I can’t with a good conscious stand by and simply allow the lives of my students to be used as a pawn for political gain.  They’ve been through enough and I stand firmly by that.” The man’s beard shook violently as he spluttered in outrage.
Minerva’s fingers gripped tightly on her spoon as the fireplace came to life once more.  Her nostrils flared as the thorns in her side appeared in the flesh.
the time!” The violent slam of a book against the table had the wizard’s body going rigid.  “Christ, Ronald!” Hermione’s face mimicked the shade of Ron’s face as she looked at her boyfriend in outrage.
I give the biggest shoutout to MiladyMorningstar for giving me the beautiful gift of short king Radomir Nikiforov who is a delight to write.  I owe her my life for this precious gem.
Harry finally collapsed on the bank of the Great Lake.  The cold wet of the sand against his denim clad knees did nothing to alleviate the fire coursing in his veins.  He was on all fours desperately ignoring the desire to retch into the gravel below. His throat stung from the contrast between the crisp morning air and his own body heat as he caught his breath and pushed himself upright. His pulse throbbed in head as his thoughts whirled distortedly around him.  The soft thump of familiar footsteps behind him was barely cognizant while he tried to stay in his own body.
She folded her hands in her lap.  “Though I must say, I’m surprised I didn’t see you cast a warming charm.”
“I don’t know.” Her other hand tapped against the sand. “It’s just… Being back here is weird and I wanted to make sure before things get hectic.”
The Hogwarts headmistress refused to rise to her colleague’s insinuating bait despite the delicate flush brushing across her cheeks.  “Of course.  While I detest the circumstances, I would be remiss if I did not try to be a good host regardless."
The shorter bundle of fur and wool to her right shook as the man’s chuckle rumbled like distant thunder.  His voice dripped thick like molasses with his strong Russian accent. “With all due respect Headmistress, you are a powerful witch but you can’t control the weather.”
“Thank you Blaise, thank you for always being there for me even when I’m a total prick which is more often than I care to admit.” Dark eyes bore into him and Draco looked away at what he saw in them, he couldn’t deal with anything more than he had on his plate at the moment. If only he could rip Harry out of his heart, but he couldn’t. Draco knew that for as long as he lived he would only love Harry James Potter, even as Harry pulverized his heart and rejected his love time and time again.
“Harry are you all right!! We’ve called Mungo’s someone form spell damage is on their way here.” Ron screamed in Harry’s ear trying to get his friend’s attention to make sure Harry was going to be ok. Harry began to shake, his bones rattle as the weight of the knowledge the stone had given him sunk on. Images of a younger Draco cursing the stone, chanting the necessary spells, dropping a piece of Harry’s hair on the stone mixed in with his own silvery strands.Draco had cursed him, his Draco, his husband and lover for the past five years of his life had cursed him. Harry doubled over and vomited all over the floor by his desk and felt his body releasing raw magic around him, he heard a few terrified screams as he closed his eyes and concentrated on the treacherous face of the bastard that had lied and made a fool of him for the past five years of his life. After that he remembered nothing of the confrontation that he apparently had in front of half the wizarding world with Draco Malfoy. All he remembered was waking up in St. Mungo’s and the healers explaining the kind of curse he had been under and the effects that he would feel from using magic while his magical core had been so unstable.
“I am thinking of her, making sure she is as far away from his influence as possible. She’s still very young she will forget. Good night Hermione I’m very tired.” Harry dismissed his best friend laying down next to his little girl and closing his eyes. He heard Hermione sobbing quietly as she closed the door on her way out. He knew he was doing the right thing and he would not let anyone convince him otherwise. It didn’t matter why Malfoy had cursed him, ruined all the plans Harry had once had for his future. What mattered now was that Harry had finally opened his eyes and was ready to break free from his past, ready to truly start his life and find real happiness, find someone that truly loved him. No curses, spells or magic, real tangible freewill type of love.
Draco pulled his head out the pensive, tears running down his face. It was his favorite form of torture, to relive the memories of the one time in his life when he had been truly happy. He slumped to the floor the pain in his heart so piercing he could hardly breath and deep down he wished, he prayed to finally stop breathing for good, that his heart would stop beating and the total nothingness that death offered would envelop him for all eternity.
“It was an accident; you couldn’t control your magic at the time. Malfoy knows that.” Ron tried to console his friend but Harry couldn’t justify in his mind all he had done.
“I’m referring to this!” Narcissa exclaimed as she slammed a news paper he had not noticed she had been holding on the plain oak table, her blue eyes accusing. He walked towards her and pick up the paper, right on the front page was a photo of him draped indecently over Blaise and leaning in as if to kiss the dark wizard as they were leaving the restaurant
“Whatever gave you that idea?” Harry snapped, sitting down behind his desk and trying to reel in his anger. Nothing seemed to be going his way. First his lawyer informed him that it would be impossible to have a quick divorce without having to cross paths with his soon to be ex husband and now Draco got supervised visitations with Aurora when all Harry wanted was to break free from the man and start his life fresh, because picking up the pieces of his heart was decidedly harder with the man who had used him so dastardly a constant presence in his life. “The Wizengamot allowed Draco supervised visitations twice a week.”
Draco desperately grabbed Harry's head and ran his fingers through the brunet’s messy hair, as though afraid he might stop but Harry was beyond that at this point. He pulled Draco's beautiful cock in between his lips and sucked it into his mouth.  The taste of his lover burst in his mouth, delicious and tangy making Harry desperate for more. Harry lapped at Draco’s erect cock, tonging the small slit and ripping deliciously sexy moans from the stoic blonde, bringing Draco to a frenzied needy state was definitely his favorite past time. Draco whimpered and his knees buckled weak  from Harry’s eager ministrations, but Harry held him up and put each of Draco's knees on  his shoulders as he tasted what had been deprived of him far too long supporting the blonde with his strength.
Draco tried again to use his charm but Harry was ready for it and he flicked it away with the small amount of occlumency he was starting to learn. He knew Draco well by now and understood his charm in such a way that he knew how to deflect it with only some effort, he was going to be in control as he made Draco his. As the influence left him, though he felt it enter Draco's body instead and Draco suddenly couldn't control himself.
“And yet…” Harry said looking down at Draco’s straining erection, the blonde quickly diverted his gaze a pink flush creeping up his pale neck. His anger and resistance plain as day, a firm wall between them. However he was unable to deny his body’s need to be near Harry anymore than he could deny that grass was green.
That had been his new routine, staring at Draco move on with his life while perfectly ignoring Harry’s existence. Two weeks, it had been two weeks since the argument that finally broke the tenuous string that had held them together. At first Harry had said good riddance, Draco was too high maintenance anyway, it was difficult keeping the moody git happy and Harry was perfectly ok with no longer having to so. That attitude had lasted a whole six hours before he started missing the Slytherin Prince, wanting to have that grey gaze upon him intense and full of promise. He missed meeting in secret alcoves to snog each other silly in between classes, Harry missed sitting in the Astronomy Tower late at night and talking about things that he didn’t dare share even with his best friends. Harry missed sinking his hard cock into Draco’s eager and welcoming heat, having mind blowing sex and then cuddling together in the afterglow. Gods he missed the cuddling, Draco always accused him of being clingy and Harry guessed he had been right.
“While he can’t see it now, I do believe that the end of his marriage to Harry is the best thing that has happened to Draco in a long time. He now has the chance of finding someone who will love him like he deserves, for exactly who he is including his faults.”
“You are mine, and I’m not keen on sharing Draco.” Harry said firmly trying to hold a grip on the white hot jealous rage that engulfed him anytime he imagined Draco with anyone other than him.
“Ugh. I hate my life. At least we only have to account for the dark artifacts, then we turn this mess over to the solicitors involved in the estate.”
“I wont, Salazar knows I want to but I wont. There is still Aurora.” Draco said with a heavy sigh and walked towards the enormous library windows, he looked out into the darkened back gardens and could almost hear his little girl laughing and running out there being chased by her daddy.
“Oh but I beg to differ, you see the only thing my son is guilty of is his unhealthy obsession with Mr.Potter. For nearly his entire life Draco has been in love with Harry Potter and it is now as I had feared going to lead to nothing but harm.” Suddenly Narcissa took Hermione’s hand in her own small ones, her gaze changing to one of pure fear and concern. “I want to believe with all of my heart that Harry is what Draco needs, but these past five years while he has been deliriously happy the people around him still treat him with hesitation and distrust. Including Harry himself.” Hermione wanted to argue that she was wrong, that they all had been accepting of Draco and treated him as an equal part of their group yet something in her inexplicably lodged the words in her throat.
“That’s a bit of pot kettle, darling. Since you’re the only whore at this table.” Blaise shrugged his shoulders in agreement, a sly look on his face causing the other two to barely contain their laughter.  “And now I think it’s Draco’s turn to whore around a bit. Honestly darling besides that dimwitted creature you married how many sex partners have you had?” The question brought Blaise to attention as well, both his friends looked at Draco intensely as the waited for him to answer. Draco knew that they both thought he had only ever slept with Harry, which of course wasn’t true but he would never admit his lack of experience and the fact that there had only been a short lived relationship with a wizard who had also had messy black hair and green eyes. Facts which Draco was not prepared to explore too deeply, he already knew he was pathetic.
“And that is why we are here today,” Wheeler stated as he sat across form Draco, all business even though they had work together several times in the past. Draco felt completely alienated from the people he called colleagues. “As you know a healer will administer the strong dose of veritaserum and after a brief interview where we establish that you are fully under the influence of the potion, we will proceed to remove the necessary memories for review with your previous written statement.” Once Draco acknowledged that he understood the process, Wheeler nodded towards the two way mirror and within seconds a middle aged woman whom Draco knew to be a ministry appointed healer walked in to the small room. Draco drank the potion and went through the motions as he was asked mundane questions such as his middle name, where he was born and so on until the auror and healer were satisfied that the potion had taken hold.
"I take it things didn’t go your way?” Ron asked as Harry slammed a couple of files on his desk with enough force to send a few loose papers tumbling down to the floor.
Tulip’s olive skin gained a peachy hue as she blushed from the over abundance of praise.  She gave Harry a wordless curtsey and went to work.
Percy flicked his eyes back up to meet Minerva’s, his voice solemn and apologetic.  “Thank you Headmistress.”
Harry closed the curtains with a bitter huff and laid back down on the bed. He folded his arms behind his head and stared at the sea of velvet crimson above him. A gentle puff of air escaped his lips as he counted the rhythm of his breath in his head.  He closed his eyes with trepidation and forced himself to try to go back to sleep.
Ginny dug her toes into the sand and twirled at a blade of grass with her fingers. “Are Ron and Hermione still in Hogsmeade?”
Hermione bit her lip with regret at the sharpness of her demand. Her next plea was softer, a broken hitch to her tone, “Harry, I know it’s hard but can you just try? Please?”
The wind heard her invitation as another freezing gust blew by, threatening to rip Minerva’s wool witch hat from her head.
As he trudged back to his room, it became harder and harder to ignore the neglect from weeks—no, probably months worth of insomnia and the anxiety and depression that tagged along for the ride.
He finished and went to the sink to wash his hands.  Harry grimaced again as he became aware of the dry sandy desert that was his mouth.  He bent down towards the basin and splashed cool water against his flushed face before cupping his hands and drinking deeply.
Supper flew by quickly.  Harry hummed in delight and closed his eyes gently as the sweet caramelized taste of treacle tart hit his tongue.  He’d dreamed of this moment since walking through the damaged corridors with the volunteers to meet in the solemn quiet of the Great Hall on the first day of rebuilding.  The war had wounded everyone to some degree. Some days were a struggle to get by. Meals were simple and efficient due to exhaustion for both volunteers and the house elves manning the kitchens. The grandeur of the Welcoming Feast was one more symbol of victory, one more symbol of survival and perseverance.
“Yeah.” Harry stopped his fingers and blanketed the tan freckled hand with his own scarred brown one.  “Don’t worry Gin, we’re good.”
