"Not if you don't want to, Ron," Hermione added.
The voice seemed to sigh. “I created this ritual thousands of years ago so that true believers might face their truths and become holy followers and priests for me. I did not create it so that witches could make it into death long after I parted with mortal earth.”
The group began moving through the tables and giving a piece of parchment and an inked quill-pen to each student.
Harry followed after Ron, into the house, while Hermione walked Viktor out to the Apparation point.
Augusta would excuse herself to her rooms for lunch and Harry would join Neville in the dining room for what was, frequently, a long and formal lunchtime.
“Now, Mr. Lupin, please tell us of your trip to the states and what you were doing on-leave in Japan for the past few days?” Augusta said.
Hermione stepped in front of Ginny. "Ronald, Ginny can be friends with whoever she likes and it's not up to you. Not all Slytherins are evil, you know. Pretending as though they are, or believing that they might be is part of the problem."
Al and Scorpius left the living room, with Al nodding solemnly to Harry and Scorpius giving him a smile.
There were about twenty questions, almost all of which asked for introspection and the evaluation of self. Some of them asked about his hobbies, and a couple of the questions were about being given choices between two things and which path would he take.
After hearing the whole of the tale from Severus and Hikaru, with parts from Evelyn and Charlie and Luna, Harry went outside, into the backyard, in search of his friends.
“Did you block out everyone, then?”
“Theodore’s alright, Harry. He’s not like his father.”
The house was quieter than it usually was, so Harry headed up to his room. He put his things away and then went to look for his friends.
“I remember. Zacharius’s parents and Agnes Rivermoore and Henrik Peverell,” Harry said.
“Small miracles, then,” Harry said quietly.
“Good, good.” She pointed her wand swiftly at his trunk and shrunk it. She handed him a small key. “Focus on that. Get the feel for it, feel its magick, and think of my grandson. Then apparate. It’ll get you where you need to go.”
“You can always restock at the first Hogsmeade weekend,” Ginny commented.
Draco was about to knock on the front door when it opened.
with him. There was a lot that they knew about each other that they hadn't known as kids and it'd helped to mend things between them. Harry had been pretty obsessed with Draco throughout school (he could admit it now) and he'd kept tabs on him after their 8th Year and during Draco's four years at University. He'd lost track of him after that, for a while, but they'd gotten to know each other again just after Draco had married Astoria.
Neville rushed in a few minutes later. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here. Here, help me move him into his room -- we’ll get him well again.”
Draco smiled. “There’s an unidentified powder that I need you to figure out. Tell us what it is, what it’s used for, that kind of thing.”
“But it said…” Draco trailed off, confused.
Augusta tapped her cane hard on the ground for a moment and Harry felt a rush of magic wash over him. She then led Harry up the steps and into the house.
“Yes. I can’t tell you where I am. I’m sorry,” Draco said softly.
When Neville stepped up to take a slip of parchment from Nott, Harry’s jaw nearly dropped open.
Harry pulled himself back to Privet Drive, to where Augusta was wandering his now-empty home.
“I have everything we need for the tracking spells, at my home. We can get a lot of them and set it up here, but it’ll take time -- and we both know we’re very nearly out of time to catch this person,” said Draco. “The spells won’t work for eternity or anything, you know.”
Friedrich tapped his fingers on the sides of his cup. “And if I can’t?”
“But...you’ll be next, right?” Harry asked over his shoulder as he stepped forward.
Harry ended up bunked in a section with Neville, Blaise and Charles. Harry took the bottom bunk under Charles, leaving Blaise and Neville to bunk together. As far as he could tell, they knew each other and were fairly friendly. Which, given Neville’s friendship with Ginny, made sense.
Harry went pale and froze on the step. “Cloe...Cloestra?”
They were in the Japanese countryside in a home that had a much more English style. The house wasn’t large, but it was homey and lovely. She didn’t know if Severus owned it or if he was renting it just to take care of her, but she was grateful either way.
“But why couldn’t one of you have just told me what was going on? I would have understood!” Harry yelled.
“Come on, mate,” the reflection said. “It’s our turn.”
“Yes, of course it’s me. Luna and Neville had me come over last night -- I’d been so worried.”
“Not me,” Neville said. “I’ve been already and I have some business to attend to in Lancashire.”
"That's a major subject changer," Hermione commented wryly.
"Ron! If you're so scared, why don't you just stay home and take your NEWTS when the war is over!" Harry yelled. They were in Ron's room, looking through their new school books. Hermione was sitting at Ron's desk, but Harry had been sitting on the floor, leaning against Ron's bed.
Harry laughed. "By the gods, no," he replied. "While it was tough to get divorced, to choose divorce as our option because of the kids, it's what was best for us -- absolutely. I don't have any regrets over it and I'm happy for her - I'm glad she's happy. It's nothing like that."
Early the next morning, after loo visits and showers and dressing, the students were escorted to the Great Hall and told to sit at the tables.
That first week was spent doing chores, back-breaking manual labour and cooking all the meals. Harry was lucky if he got a little toast and egg each day to sustain himself.
Harry frowned. Unsure of her meaning, he shrugged and said, “Yeah, I guess.”
"Draco and I have been having little fights, spats, I guess," Harry offered. He looked up at the backs of Ron's parents and dropped his head. He really hoped they hadn't heard him.
As Harry walked into the second classroom on the left, on the fourth floor, he felt the absence of Draco most keenly. As if he’d conjured him, Draco appeared next to him.
It had been years since Harry had been with anyone -- he hadn't dated since he and Ginny had split. He didn't regret the spilt nor the self-imposed celibate nature of his life. He really wasn't into casual flings or relationships that felt temporary and he and Ginny had tried, and struggled, for years to make it work when it had never really been what either of them had wanted. It hadn't taken long to discover his attraction to Draco and, subsequently, to other men but it had taken a long time for Harry to come to terms with it.
He knew he was perilously close and the third week hadn’t even started yet; and there was far too much still to do.
“I appreciate everything that was done to find me and rescue me. I appreciate all that you and the others and your friend are doing now. But someone needs to tell Harry what happened, and soon,” Ru said before she turned her attention to the meal in front of her.
Harry nodded. “Sounds good. You could meet us in Diagon tomorrow, if you want.”
"You don't want me there either!" Ron accused.
“Has Augusta arrived?” Luna asked.
Evelyn sat down on the bed next to him and put her arms around him. “I’m so sorry, Harry.”
Classroom B was a large room that was set up a lot like a classroom but with adult-sized desks and evidence-gathering and briefing materials. There were other rooms like it on other floors of the Law Enforcement Department (which was a building separate from the Ministry building), but this one was specific to Harry and Draco's team. They used it during every case.
“I haven’t done it on purpose,” Ru said in between bites.
Harry dropped the evidence bag lightly on Draco’s desk and then sat down next to it, on top of the desk.
“Hermione’s in Neptune. Padma’s in Hecate. Ernie’s got Merlin.”
Neville smiled. “Luna’s in Isis.” He bowed his head slightly. “I noticed Ron wasn’t at breakfast.”
Harry sighed and got up from the sofa. He'd been sitting in his home-office for the last few hours, just thinking about everything and remembering his and Draco's long history. Now, though, he needed to get ready for work. According to the missive he'd received, Chief Rabastan had a new case for them.
**********
“Raven Steele is Isis and Fergus Ivor is Coeus,” Neville replied. “I had that bit of news from Ernie.”
“I…” Harry began gently. “I should have let the Sorting Hat put me in Slytherin. I won’t deny that. It’s part of who I am and part of my history -- the choices that I made. It would have been hard and different and I wasn’t ready. I wanted Ron to like me. I didn’t...I didn’t want to be like Dudley. I didn’t want to be like...like Draco, at the time, either.”
Harry and Ginny talk.
“Goddess, your ritual kills people,” Harry whispered.
“Has anyone?”
wixen:  a gender neutral term for witches and wizards, also a plural term instead of having to say witches and wizards.
His mirror image blinked back at him before pinning him with a cold stare.
Considering it was the renovated and remodeled home in Godric's Hollow, the one he'd lived in as an infant, Harry was really proud of the home he'd created here and he was even fairly impressed with the amount of space they'd been able to carve out. The contractors had outdone themselves -- especially considering Harry hadn't wanted to use any wizard-space (though, of course, he'd been fine using magic).
“Who are the other two?” Harry asked.
“Tonks. Can you believe it? An Order member and everything,” Neville said excitedly.
“Yes, and I think Evelyn will be here later. I’m so sorry we’ve put you in the dark, Harry. We love you a great deal and didn’t mean to abandon you, I swear,” Cloestra said.
“He will, surely,” Cloestra replied.
Andromeda laughed. “Be gone, Harry. We don’t need you around tonight. Have fun with Draco.”
I meant to have this chapter up days ago, but then I got sick (a cold) and it has really been kicking my ass. Like, I keep feeling better one day only to feel worse the next. I don't think it's COVID though, because it's just standard cold symptoms. Anyways, here it [the chapter] is now. This fic keeps evolving on me, which is both annoying (cuz I wanted it to be short) and awesome (because now it'll be longer and more detailed).
"As always." Ginny laughed and then sipped her cooling tea. "Now, tell me about the case. Let's get all of that on the table too. I'm a retired Quidditch star, not an Auror so I'm safe to talk to and you know I won't leak it to the press. Come on, time to talk about it. What's going on with the case? Is the Mirror Murderer back?"
In the basement of his home on the outskirts of London, Draco smashed the small potions bottle against the mirror.
When Harry just nodded, Neville continued.
“Don’t yell at me, Harry Potter,” Cloestra said firmly. “I’m telling you now.”
"Harry, he won't hate you. He might not return your feelings, true, and he might not understand why you like him and he might reject you, but....he won't deliberately hurt you over it and he won't be mean. You know him better than I do, obviously, but even I can see how much you mean to him."
Harry wrote letters to his friends and his cluster, but he only sent off the few messages to his friends. He felt confused and lost over the lack of his cluster -- only Luna was checking in regularly.
She didn’t walk often, as she was mostly confined to her magickal wheelchair now, but he knew she liked to walk a little everyday.
“One of the old, established families from some amount of wealth and status, yes,” Remus confirmed.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t know and I really doubt we’ll ever find out.”
AT THE WEASLEYS'
“Okay, good.” He checked the time. “Scorpius is asleep and he doesn’t have school tomorrow, but I should be back in only a few hours. If you need me, use your patronus. It...you’re still able to cast that one, right?”
Harry sighed and then rolled his eyes. “I’m not going over there for fun, ‘Meda. It’s spell-work for a case. We’re going to do some weird tracking spell and maybe even catch the criminal this time around.”
“Harry!” Cloestra cried as she appeared on the stairs as he was going down them.
“The one I met at dinner?” At Neville’s nod, Harry continued. “Is that why your grandmother wanted me to meet her?”
Neville shook his head. “I don’t know, exactly. Nott said that they are all Lords or Ladies -- the Head of their family, and each with powerful magick. Three of them are descendants from the Founders.”
Scorpius is 7 (B: June 10th 2006)
He liked his job. He felt useful and knowledgeable and he was still very dedicated to the work -- though he worked less often than he once had. He wasn't sure he wanted to give up the actual work to aid in overseeing a department -- which would be the next rung in the ladder, if he decided to go for it. Currently, he and Draco reported directly to Assistant Chief Nexwell, but they also ran a team of Aurors to help them in case-solving. Any unsolved cases moved to the Cold Case Department and they would, occasionally, be consulted.
Hikaru stepped further into the room.
"There have been three bodies that we know about and they have all had a rune carved into their sides and a mirror left on the body. There's very little forensics and what there is has been confusing..." Harry began.
"Now, Ron," Arthur interjected as he stopped in front of Flourish and Blotts. "I've only just overheard Hermione, but your friend has a point. We should all be more willing to open our minds to each other. Not all Slytherins go dark, and if you don't believe me, just look at our family. Your grandfather, my father, Septimus was a Slytherin and he was the nicest man you could meet."
There was a gasp from behind him and Harry resisted the urge to run his hands over his face.
They walked into the circle. Draco closed it, with a chalk line, a scatter of herbs and a few words, behind them.
"Okay, out with it, Potter," Draco said -- not unkindly.
Harry relied on Draco for adult conversation, funny stories, working on cases, companionship and overall friendship. They had a really good working relationship and, at this point, a really good friendship. Al and Scorpius were good friends and looked forward to going to Hogwarts together. Draco and Scorpius were even coming for Christmas and Boxing Day later this month. He didn't want to ruin things with his feelings -- feelings he wasn't sure that Draco returned.
“And before that?” Harry asked, already feeling worried about Draco’s phrasing.
Harry could tell there was something that Draco was leaving out and realized he was going to have to press him about it. “What aren’t you saying?”
“Wait, it’s what?” Harry asked again.
“I don’t know where everyone ended up, Harry. You know I’m not friends with as many people as you are. Emma’s in Neptune, though.”
She recorded the fever, malnutrition and slight infection on a piece of parchment and, using her Patronus, sent the results to both Neville and Madam Pomfrey. When Madam Pomfey’s Patronus came back with hers, Hermione knew she’d made the right choice to tell her.
"I don't want to jeopardize the friendships involved -- mine and Draco's, Al's and Scorpius. I don't want to mess anything up. I can't have him hating me while we work together and I don't want either of us to have to transfer," Harry explained.
“Well, now, and I thought they’d never leave,” said Augusta Longbottom as she stepped over the threshold and into the house.
"I don't have less to worry about, Ron," Harry replied darkly.
“What for?”
Headmistress McGonagall sat down in her chair and the podium moved itself away, against the back wall.
Harry shifted uncomfortably on the chair. "I really don't..."
“Sounds good,” said Draco. He sipped his tea while he waited for Friedrich to return.
It was fifteen years after the war and even though Harry was only thirty-three, he already felt as though he'd lived two lives, maybe three. He didn't know how to start over now, or if he even wanted to.  His children were still pretty young and even though he and Ginny had been divorced for three full years, he didn't want to shake up their lives anymore than necessary.
"For Merlin's sake, Ronald," Hermione interrupted. "No, he's not saying that. He's saying that you have the choice. You could not go. It would be okay. Harry doesn't have the luxury of choosing to stay home. But, you do. So, if you're worried and scared and if you feel like you can't make it through the year, then stay home!"
Soon enough, it was Harry’s birthday. The day passed quietly, with Neville occupied in one of the greenhouses and Harry holed up in his room -- completing holiday work, resting and practicing magick.
"I honestly don't care one way or the other, Ron, but I want you to make up your mind and stop complaining about it," said Hermione.
The infection was cured by a combination of spell and potion, and Harry got much-needed rest and food over the next few days.
“No, I haven’t.”
Andromeda lived with Harry full-time. Teddy lived there when he wasn't at Hogwarts. They'd (Harry, Andromeda, Teddy, Ron, Hermione) all lived in Grimmauld Place after the war on and off, but he, Andromeda and Teddy had moved into Godric's Hollow after his separation from Ginny. He knew Andromeda hadn't wanted to be alone, after her husband's death, and that she'd wanted Harry to be a big part of Teddy's life so it'd been an easy fix for all of them to live at Grimmauld until Harry had married Ginny. For years, after the marriage, Andromeda and Teddy had joined Harry and Ginny at the house Harry'd had built just outside of Ottery St Catchpole and down the street from the Burrow. Ginny'd gotten the house in the divorce -- he hadn't wanted to uproot her (and the kids) and he'd had other options.
“Which is?”
Harry sighed. “He decided not to come back. He’ll take his NEWTS during the summer, but...he decided not to come back to Hogwarts.”
Draco frowned. “Uh, no. It mirrors you. Shows you into yourself and you have to be willing to be honest and face yourself. It’s why it can kill -- and be used to kill, depending, but I think we’ll discover all of that once we catch the perpetrator. I think it’ll come up, during trial, what he was after and how he used this to kill people.”
“Of course, love,” said Evelyn.
Harry filled it out as quickly and completely as he could before turning it in. He really didn’t think any good could come of someone having these sorts of answers from him, but he did want to attend his last year of school. He was willing to put up with this sort of intrusion in order to accomplish graduating.
“I haven’t seen Charlie in a long time, now,” Cloestra replied evasively.
“Ron and I are complicated. I know that. I accept it. He shows up for family things, but he’s still angry with me about the divorce. I know we’re not as close, but he’s not...he’s not, like, dead weight or anything, you know. I love him -- like a brother. He’s disappointed in me. I have to hope, I have to, that when I tell him I’m gay, he’ll accept it and understand. I stayed with Gin, and she with me, for as long as we both could.”
Harry laughed and hugged his son. “Son, son, son, son!” It was a sort of ritual they did, whenever he was leaving the house -- since James had been three.
Severus followed after her and said nothing until she’d sat down and served herself some food and tea.
Astoria sat down on the sofa. She waved her wand, a little lazily, and her patronus appeared. Her butterfly patronus flew around the room for a few seconds before vanishing.
first chapter of the new fic.
"Alright, everybody, gather around. The Chief has been very clear on what he wants to do, in regards to current cases and this new one," Assistant Chief Nexwell addressed Harry and Draco's team.
********************
Harry glared at her. He didn’t care if it made him seem childish. None of this was fair. Why had he been cut off while everyone else saw each other?
“You’re a goddess,” Draco replied. “I always show respect to my betters.”
“Neville said you’d been ill when you first arrived. Everything okay?”
Friedrich led Draco into the parlour.
Friedrich nodded and turned, towards the kitchen. “I’ll be back in a moment and you can tell me what this is about. As long as it doesn’t require me to come to London, I’m sure I can help.”
Ron nodded, but Harry could tell that Ron either didn't believe him or didn't care. "If you're scared and this worried, you could just take the year, Ron."
Harry enjoyed the day -- but he was keenly aware of the people that were missing. He missed his cluster.
The mirror absorbed the potion and the glass turned into a swirling, purple vortex. He was about to step through when Astoria walked carefully into the room.
Augusta gave a thin smile. “I have less faith than Dumbledore had in the boy’s abilities. I’d like the people that I trust to be held in reserve for the battlefield, rather than in the day-to-day activities of a school boy. As much as I like you, Mr. Potter, I find that I cannot quite understand Dumbledore’s faith. More information and time is needed, in my opinion.” She thumped her hand on the table again, as though it were a gavel.
Delphinium laughed. “It’s not a rude question, Gusta. I think it’s valid that he asked it, and I’m happy to answer.”
Hermione rubbed Harry's back soothingly. "I'm sorry he won't be in school and that you two are having a rough time of it."
“Great. Is everyone going?”
“My family and the Greengrasses have been long-time friends and in some cases business partners. I have known Delphi, and her siblings, since they were in their infancy. My connections, Mr. Potter, could greatly aid you in the war,” Lady Longbottom said.
Harry nodded, albeit a bit glumly. “I don’t know how to be one of them though -- one of the elite, you mean?”
Draco sighed and fidgeted with the vial. “He’s not a friend, exactly. But, I’ve known him a long time -- most of my life. I think he’ll be able to help because he’s a world-renowned Potions Master, a trained Medi-wizard, as well as he holds degrees in muggle sciences. He also practices the Old Religion. I trust him to be discreet and I think he’ll know things to test for, and ways to test, that our Squints don’t.”
From Harry’s view, its faded red brick, dozens of windows and large, white columns looked like something out of a different century.
Harry nodded and looked around more carefully. “So, what were you doing alone in what appears to be Neville’s room?”
Remus’s eyes cut to Harry’s for a split second before he spoke. “I find it difficult to understand how you might know about that, but I was helping a friend with a...custody issue.”
“This will be how our relationship ends, you know that, right?” Harry asked miserably.
“I’m in love with you, Draco. I think I have been since our sixth year, but I didn’t like it or didn’t know how to face it. I’m in love with you. And I’m telling you, without expectation. It’s good that you know, now is all,” Harry said calmly.
Harry rushed to reassure Draco. "No, no nothing like that! The kids are fine and as far as I know the Weasleys are all well too. Ginny's good -- happy, I think, with Blaise. I think they'll probably get engaged soon, actually."
“He’s not kidding, mate,” Ron said as he flew to the ground and hopped off his broom. “Come on, everyone, we’re done here. Not enough people for a proper game anyway.”
“The killer moved her dead body to London? That seems significant,” Draco commented.
“You need to tell him you’re in love with him. You need to just say it, to get it all out in the open and put it on the table, as the muggles say. It’s doing you more harm than good to keep it inside and to pretend you aren’t madly in love with your best friend.”
“Don’t be rude at my dinner table, young man,” Lady Longbottom said as she thumped a hand on the table.
Hermione watched as Harry slipped into sleep right in front of her and then she got to work. Diagnostic spells worked best when the patient was awake, but they still worked -- regardless.
“Okay,” Harry replied.
. He needs rest and food -- start with a good, strong broth. If he’s holding that down well, a light, well-rounded meal would be fine.”
“Nev? When did you get here?” Harry asked.
Friedrich sighed. “I am still sorry that there’s not more that I can do.” He looked up, his dark eyes sympathetic. “I’ll analyze the powder, of course.”
"Harry, just tell him you're in love with him, for Merlin's sake. You'll feel a lot better once it's out in the open and you don't have to brood about it anymore."
“I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t. You know I don’t like dragging you into things like this.”
Hermione smacked him lightly on the arm. “I’ve already invited him, Harry.”
“Uh, not really. I knew they had money. I understand his grandmother’s connections, but, no, I had no idea the house was this big. I can understand why Neville’s always been so lonely, though, until he and Luna got close.”
"Of course I am, but I'm not going to go around moaning and complaining about it."
“Tab-brio-lyte-lex,” Draco pronounced.
Harry shrugged and went to find his dorm.
“Oh, Ru,” Harry said. “You didn’t. I know you needed help. I would have helped you if I could. It’s just been such a lonely couple of months.”
Draco gave a genuine smile. “No. He’s a valuable member of the Masters League. He’s a Potions Master, but that isn't all he is. All the judge will need, all the Head will need for that matter, is the report. They’ll run with whatever he’s said in the report, trust me.”
Draco and Harry discuss the case, then Draco goes to see an old friend.
“Have you been to see Harry yet? Explained?” Ru asked as she walked into the kitchen.
“Potter, I’ve asked you, repeatedly, not to sit on my desk,” Draco drawled.
“This is the new sorting exam. The parchment is charmed and you will have the inability to lie or cheat. Answer the questions and return your exam to the box on top of the head table. You will then sit back down. A member of the extended staff will let you know what House you’ve sorted into and will provide more instructions. Your things will be brought to your dormitory before the end of the day. Classes start tomorrow, and you will be given your class schedule in the morning, at breakfast.”
“How’ve you been, Harry?” he asked softly.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, but that’s not as much fun.”
“You’ve got this covered, ‘Meda?” Harry asked.
"You've seemed off all day. Don't get me wrong, you've been there and it was a really fun party. Lily had such a good time. But something's been off, Harry," Ginny said.
"The kids are all asleep upstairs?" Harry asked.
Draco shook his head. “I’ll remove half of it to a new vial, with a new evidence label. I’ll clear it with the lab and I’ll file an amended log. I think that leaving the rest here is a good idea -- it’s one of our only pieces of evidence.”
“They seem very couple-y,” Hermione replied. She inspected him closely for a moment before dropping into the chair next to him. “Are you alright, Harry? Everyone’s been so worried. No one’s heard from you in weeks.”
“Oh,” said Harry. “So, this is very, very helpful. It’ll basically crack the case.”
Harry barely resisted the urge to clap his hands over his mouth in awe.
“If anyone could figure out what the powder is,” Harry picked up. “Then your friend could.”
Harry starts his 7th Year at Hogwarts.
Draco nodded and brushed a hand over the small satchel that he wore in a cross-body position. “I think he can help with the case. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a few years since the last time I saw him. Will you be okay, you and Scorpius, while I’m gone?”
"Love, we're magical. We, as a whole community of witches and wizards, have a very open minded view on same-sex relationships and things -- even in Pureblood circles. Because we have magic. I mean, you've seen Neville and George and you've been with them out and about....you know they're accepted, as are their kids. This isn't quite the crisis situation you've made it up to be in your head. I promise, it'll be fine -- on that score. Sure, he might be a little freaked out and he may not return your feelings but.....everyone likes knowing they're loved, Harry," Ginny said.
Ron took a great big breath and then sighed. He nodded. "I...I feel like I should be there, to help."
Tate is Hannah and Wayne's youngest kid (they run the Leaky Cauldron and live above it).
Draco stepped towards the mirror and the wind picked back up.
Draco pushed Harry forward. “Remember, you have to face it. Whatever it is. If you don’t, the price is very high -- magically.”
“I am very tired,” the voice said as the mist swirled. “I will help you find who you are after, so that my ritual may no longer be perverted in this way. He’s been using it to murder innocent people for years.”
Assistant Chief Nexwell was a tall, severely thin woman, with very long, black hair that she kept in a series of braids wound around her head. Harry had always been strongly reminded of Headmistress McGonagall by her and when he'd said the same to Draco and he'd agreed, they'd shared some memories and laughter about it -- it had been a decent bonding situation in their first year as partners.
“I know,” Draco said sadly. “What about the victim? Are we any further in discovering who the victim was?”
The house was in a Tudor-style and the garden around it was lush and green and full of blooms and plants and herbs. Behind the house was a beautiful, bright green pasture; although it was hidden by the large house.
There was no sorting before dinner. After dinner all of the students were directed to a swath of previously unused rooms on the first floor; the rooms had been filled with bunk-beds and little tables and the ceilings lighted with candelabras.
and, more importantly, he was safe there.
"Is that what it is? Are you regretting your divorce or wishing she hadn't moved on so quickly??" Draco asked.
“We will participate in the ritual. Which means we have to trust each other and be willing to be open about our thoughts and feelings in regards to ourselves,” Draco said.
Harry threw a pillow at him and then nodded at Severus. “Well, go on.”
The group hurried to buy their supplies and then left the shop and joined Molly and Arthur. Harry was very concerned about what Draco had said, but it wasn't like her could ask him about it -- Draco had gone so suddenly, Harry barely believed he'd even been there.
Cloestra, Evelyn, Luna and Ru began talking all at once.
Draco had changed a lot, during their 8th year at Hogwarts, but Astoria had really turned the tide in terms of policy that Draco supported (with his Wizengamot votes) and in terms of how much more open Draco was as a person. They still lived together and had initially divorced out of Astoria's concern for the well-being of both Draco and their son. Now, it was pretty clear that Astoria was living out the last years of her life and that she wanted Draco to move on with his life so that he wouldn't be devastated at the eventual loss.
“We’re not what I would call friends, but...I’ve known him most of my life. He’ll be able to figure this out and we both know how important that could be,” Draco responded.
Neville laughed. “Considering that’s Riddle, no.”
Could he really start a relationship with Draco? Not the logistics of it, but the emotional and physical commitments. He and Ginny had never really seen eye-to-eye and their sex life had been sporadic, at best. During the divorce things had been said that had implied that Harry wasn't that good at it and he certainly wasn't that good at communication or emotional openness.
"Don't play games with me, Mr. Potter," Ginny said fiercely. "You've been in love with him for years and preoccupied with him for years before that. I know it and you know it and even Hermione knows it. So just...tell me what's going on. Why haven't you told him?"
“Any news?” Ru asked, hopeful.
Harry gets rescued.
Neville sat down next to him. “I guess we get Theodore, as our Head Student.”
“Nott was never a Death Eater.”
"That git," grumbled Ron. "I wouldn't be surprised if he'd killed the Headmaster."
“Goddess of Reflection, at your service young man,” Opishanata replied.
She slipped into the en-suite washroom, with its bath and shower connected by a different door, to get ready for the day. When she was bathed, brushed and dressed she headed downstairs.
Harry stepped away from his body, in the sensate-style of a kind of astral projection. He appeared at Luna’s side.
“It’s okay, Harry. I miss it too. I wish I could be there,” Draco said quietly.
“Did you always want to play?” Harry asked, directing his question to Neville and completely avoiding what Ron had asked.
"I'm not ready to talk about it. When I can, I will. For now, I promise my head will be in the game, on the case -- I won't put anyone in jeopardy. I promise," said Harry.
“I love you, as well. Tell Friedrich I said hello. Thank him for me, too, will you? The potions he leaves every month have been very helpful,” Astoria says.
"Well, everything's tidied up out there,"" Ginny said as she came into the kitchen.
The reflection faded and the mirror went back to swirling. The wind died down.
Harry nodded. “Did the bullies, at least, wind up away from Luna?”
As he locked up the house he made a mental note to write Teddy back, at Hogwarts, but he pushed those thoughts away and headed to the apparation spot. He had a staff meeting to get to and a new case to start. His feelings, and what he wanted to do about them, could wait.
“And your friends?” said his reflection. “Let’s please talk about your choices there. They take hideous advantage of you and always have.”
Harry nodded. “At least you’re here now.”
Harry pulled Neville aside. “Where did Luna end up?”
“Well, no. Severus and I spoke at length multiple times, and Evelyn and I had some arguments. I saw Draco, in person, for a couple of weeks too. And Luna never really leaves any of us alone, does she?”
James jumped up from his spot on the floor. “Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!”
Over his shoulder, Draco muttered in his ear. “Get going. You’re not as safe as you think.”
“So, why did the Head of House positions get taken from Sprout and Flitwick?”
“Yeah, got my license a few weeks ago. If you can shrink my trunk for me, I can apparate to whenever you say,” Harry replied.
Neville frowned. “That seems out of character.”
"Oh Harry, no. There's nothing to forgive. You can't help how you feel. And....it isn't selfish to tell him. If he's indifferent to you, then you can begin to move on. Besides....you don't tell him like you expect anything back. You tell him it's a gift and that you have no expectations but that you thought he should know. You tell him in a way that is gentle and kind and not as if he owes you anything," Ginny said.
“If you lot will stop talking, please,” a man at the front of the room said, addressing the room and not just Harry and Neville.
So, if he and Draco were going to continue to work together and be close friends, Harry was going to have to do better at locking his feelings up -- around Draco and those closest to the both of them. It was time to stop living in his head about it and time to start trying to live with it.
Harry turned around. “I think you’re up next, but, before it is your turn...let me say that no, I’m not in love with Ron.”
Remus pulled Harry aside just as they were about to enter the dining room.
Luna was in Neville’s room, cuddled up together on the sofa by the window. She looked up in surprise when Harry appeared.
Harry nodded. “I trust you.”
Ru nodded. “For me, too. Though Severus has been wonderful these past few weeks.”
Draco gave Friedrich a slow smile. “I thought I’d stay around for a few hours, visit with you, maybe see the horses. Is that okay?”
“I needed to refill some of my ingredients -- ones not on the school list, you see,” she said for the second time. “But there’s so little here that isn’t the school requirements!”
“I don’t think we really understood how lost and abandoned you felt, even though Luna tried to tell us,” Draco said.
Harry hated to admit it, but he was really struggling. The first three weeks of the summer holidays spent with the Dursleys were just brutal.
Harry tumbled out of the floo. It was a little while after lunch on the 3rd of August and he’d only just gotten to the Burrow.
Harry frowned. “That doesn’t bode well.”
There was no access to the lake, nor to the Quidditch Pitch that Harry could see.
Harry stared at the wide, grand staircase. The steps were huge and they seemed to go up for a very long time before he could see a landing. He took a deep breath and headed up the stairs.
“We’re here, Harry,” Luna said and sat down on his other side to offer what comfort she could.
“I’m sure you’ll be on the team next year, and we can have some pick-up games this year,” Harry replied.
"Better that he's not, really," Ginny said. She dropped her voice to a whisper. "Blaise will be there, but he's pretty worried."
Unfortunately, he’d have to wait until he was back at the Weasleys' for the answers.
“Okay.” He walked across the room and sat down in one of the armchairs by the unlit fireplace.
"So, it wouldn't matter if I wasn't there, this year?"
“Put it down, boy,” Lady Longbottom said, rather gruffly.
Harry nodded in agreement and then changed the subject. "I'm sorry we weren't able to get everyone together on her actual birthday," he said softly.
James, Lily and Albus were here on weekends, holidays, and all school breaks, but during the week they lived with their mother and Harry knew it was hard for them, that he and Ginny didn't live together anymore. How would they feel, he wondered, if things managed to work out with Draco? If he even got up the courage to just tell Draco how he felt and things worked out between them? How would it affect their kids?
Neville waved a hand. “I’d hope you’d help Harry anyway, Grandmother,” he said quietly.
***************
Lily waited until Harry was at the front door before she came running for hugs and to chatter at him.
"What are you going to do about it?" asked Ginny.
She gave a slightly awkward curtsey. “Thanks,” she said.
“Is there breakfast?” Ru asked softly.
Once done with breakfast, the students began leaving the tables to find the classroom they’d been instructed to go to.
“Busy doing what?” Ron asked, eyebrows raised.
“And the new transfiguration professor? Do we know…?” Harry trailed off.
Petunia was determined to be moved out of 4 Privet Drive by the third week, and she’d set upon Harry the task of helping her pack up the whole house and secure the furniture.
“Lenora is here and Padrick will be here tonight. She has an appointment later, so they had to switch. I really just came down to see you off,” Astoria said.
“Harry, you must understand. You were at your relatives, where it isn’t safe to do magick, let alone be part of our cluster. We were trying to keep you safe. It’s not as though Luna didn’t keep us aware of what was going on,” Cloestra tried to explain.
He found Hermione, Ron, Ginny, and Neville playing Quidditch with Viktor.
Master Peverell nodded at Theodore before disappearing through a door at the right side of the room.
Severus nodded and walked away, back to the window he’d been staring out of only a few minutes before. He had a lot to think about, and a great deal to figure out.
“Well, you could have just asked me,” said Harry. “I’ll do just about anything to catch this guy. He’ll go to ground soon and we’ll have to wait another two years!”
“Well, Neville’s out on some sort of errand and Luna’s gone to Romania for some reason? I guess to see Charlie? He is part of your cluster, right?” Hermione replied.
“Thank you.” Draco removed the bagged vial from his bag and placed it on the table. Next to it he placed the report that the lab team had compiled. “There’s everything they tested it for and their process, if it’ll help.”
“So, what you’re saying is that...we’ll do the whole ritual with a few minor changes which will lead us to the culprit?” Harry asked, confused.
The Headmistress nodded at a small group of students standing off to the side, each holding a stack of parchment. Harry noticed right away that Hermione, Theodore Nott, Ernie Macmillan and Padma Patil were among its members. There were two other faces as well that Harry recognized, but he didn’t know their names.
"Are you saying you don't want me there, this year?" asked Ron.
“I didn’t know he was lonely. How long have he and Luna been a couple?”
Harry went around their outer-office (much like a muggle police office) checking on the wards and ward-objects. Some wards could be put up in a more permanent fashion but others, like eavesdropping wards, had to be secured to an object and would, over time, wear thin and need to be renewed.
There were other students he recognized, of course, and other friends of his as well. Hannah Abbott, Brogan Crowley, Tracey Davis, Seamus Finnigan, Daphne Greengrass, Sally-Anne Perks, and Genevieve Parkinson. Fay, Ginny and Felix were all Odins too.
“Alright,” Harry said. “How...what do we need to do first?”
“We all are,” Luna said softly.
Opishanata laughed. “You are not a true believer. There’s no need for such respectfulness.”
TWO WEEKS AT NEVILLE’S (22th July to 3rd August)
He hadn't meant to fall in love with Draco Malfoy, of all people. But, he had. And now that it was real to him, real for him, he didn't know what to do about it.
(2nd August)
Friedrich put the report he’d compiled on the table in the basement of Draco and Astoria’s home, alongside her treatment and set a sealed envelope alongside that was simply addressed:
“Neither would I -- fit in, I mean,” mumbled Harry.
"I...are you telling me you're not scared?" Ron asked.
Lady Longbottom made a gesture of acquiescence and sat back.
Harry’s eyes widened. Japan? Did Remus have news of Hikaru? It was only his training with his cluster that kept him from blurting it out.
1st SEPTEMBER
"I'm worried." Ron said. He jumped off of his bed and began shouting. "I have a younger sister, I have parents, I want to have a life! I don't want to die young and I certainly don't want to go to school for a year, looking over my shoulder every minute!" He stomped his feet. "You've got less to worry about! And you've got stronger magick!"
Neville glanced over at the corner of his room where Luna was staring. “Is Harry here?”
Draco swallowed hard and then averted his eyes. His next words sounded as though they were painful to say. “Friedrich Reeves was one of the people who...who trained Severus. Severus was his Apprentice in Potions and Medi-wizardry. Friedrich trained Severus, Harry. If anyone…”
“They can’t figure out what it is,” Harry said simply. “It’s one of our only pieces of evidence and they have no idea what it is.”
Luna sighed. “It’s fine.” She looked back at Harry. “Just go with her. She’ll bring you here. It’s okay, Harry, promise.”
Draco kissed her on the cheek and then cupped her face in his hands. “I love you,” he whispered.
Draco frowned. He shoved Harry off of his desk and grabbed the bag. He turned the vial this way and that, underneath a brightly lit desk-lamp.
Draco stepped forward. "I'm going to go over what we know so far and what we expect of our team for right now. Then, we'll talk about the different scenarios and after that we'll talk about how the foreseeable future might go. Once the rest of our team is done with their burglary case, they'll join us and it'll be up to the three of you to get them up to speed."
“It’ll help,” Friedrich said shortly. “Are you leaving right away?”
Harry shook his head. “She was dead before she wound up in Knockturn and, according to the coroner, she thinks that Hertha was dead before she arrived in London.”
They were distracted then by being asked to sit and once they’d taken their places, two empty seats apart, the first course was served.
Harry raced to the mirror. A grey and pearly white mist swirled in the reflection. When the mirror began to vibrate, they heard a voice.
“I’m learning to play Quidditch, for reasons that escape me,” Hermione replied as she flew down to hover near him.
“What in the name of Merlin are you lot doing?” Harry said, using the sonorus charm to amplify his voice.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, but I don’t think the Dursleys or the Potters or anyone else blood-related to me is really why we’re here. Come on, let’s get on with it.”
Harry resisted the urge to laugh. She really had a way of getting her own way, he thought. He looked back at Remus. Why was Remus helping Severus in Japan? Had they found Ru? What was going on?
Harry finished showering and dressing and then put on his gear -- the Elder wand in a holster on his right hip, his normal wand (the holly and phoenix feather) in a holster on his wand arm, his invisibility cloak was in a a pouch on his left hip, and he wore a magic-proof vest under his shirt and his Captain's badge was secured on his breast-pocket.
Draco went inside, followed closely by the cat, who ran off into another room as soon as the door was closed behind them. The house was dim, cool and neat as a pin.
Harry was relieved by the room-assignments. He’d been worried that the rooms would be markedly different from previous years, but he was wrong. It was just the same as Gryffindor -- the 7th Year boys, minus Neville, would all share a room. The 7th year girls, minus Sally-Anne, would also all room together.
“Waiting for you, of course. Neville knew you’d be directed here and so he asked me to wait. He needed to do something and I guess it was rather urgent?”
"That's a lot of people to be so tuned into how I feel about him," Harry said after a few tense moments.
And so on and so forth.
"Who?" Ron asked suspiciously. "You're not still friends with that Slytherin, are you?"
Harry took a deep, long breath and then sat back down. "Yeah. You're right. Of course."
When Hermione put an exam and pen in front of him, she leaned forward. “I was chosen over the summer and couldn’t tell anyone. We’re the Head Squad. We’ve each been chosen to carry out certain duties, as Head Students. We’ve been vetted and given parameters and we’re also in charge of the Prefects. It’s all a little wild. I’ve got to go, I’ll tell you more later,” she said in a rush as she moved to put exams in front of other students.
Harry looked down at the test and picked up the pen.
He felt so, so grateful that Neville had been excited to take Hedwig with him, when they’d gotten to Kings Cross, for the summer; he felt absolutely sure that if she’d been with him, she would have starved to death by now.
“What on Earth is there to look forward to in this dismal year without Quidditch?” Ginny asked.
“I...I have a colleague that I think could tell us what it is,” Draco said as he sat down in the chair right next to Harry’s desk. The chair was pushed up against the desk so that it was facing Harry.
“No, no news,” Severus answered.
“Yeah, thankfully. Tallie, Camilla and Rupert all wound up separated across the other houses. Luna was very quick to gleefully tell me that,” came Neville’s reply.
The mirror swirled with their images, back and forth and back and forth until, finally, it settled on Harry.
“That sounds vague.”
Harry watched them go, through the living room window. His things were packed up as well; his trunk and knapsack waited in the hallway.
Neville shook his head. “Merlin, no. I’m utterly hopeless at Quidditch.”
Harry told her as much as he could, offered his own opinions, and took her advice where applicable.
Al is 7 (B: May 22nd 2006).
“Sure. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?” Harry asked.
2013.
Harry sighed. "I didn't realize it was that obvious."
*****************
Following the Wiki as closely as I can, but I did make up the birthdays myself.
“I think you’ll find that you’ll fit in fine, Harry. You were one of them from birth, after all -- even if you weren’t raised that way.”
The castle was different now. It was larger, with more towers, but also, somehow smaller -- more contained.
“We’ll miss you, Nev,” Ginny responded.
**************
********************
Augusta nodded. “We’d better get going then. Can you apparate?”
Draco gave a smug smile. “It’s a rare, magickal gem, Harry. It can be ground down into a fine powder and while it’s usually used in potions, it’s also used in a bizarre, highly dangerous ritual.”
“You’ll need to go to the fourth floor, second classroom on the left-hand side, after breakfast. Okay?”
After breakfast, Harry would do homework and some studying.
“But you already have everything?”
He stepped back through the portal and hoped that the work he’d done, and what he’d discovered, would help Harry and Draco to track down the culprit.
“We all needed a good break and a decent party, Harry. And we’re happy to celebrate your birthday,” Neville said. “So go on and enjoy. There’ll be cake and presents later.”
“Okay. I hope so. I don’t want catching this killer to get fouled up by something as simple as getting someone’s statement -- on the record,” Harry explained.
“You’re in love with Weasley!?” Draco asked. “That’s just disgusting!”
Severus cleared his throat and then turned the desk chair so it faced the bed. As he sat down in it he said, “Get comfortable, everyone. This is somewhat of a long story. Hikaru, you may chime in at any time, obviously.”
Several moments later, Hermione tapped him on the shoulder.
“Pretty safe bet there won’t be a Slytherin descendant,” Harry said.
They stopped in front of a blank section of wall and she touched the corner lightly with her hand. The panels on the wall pulled back to reveal a caged-lift entrance.
She waved that away. "It's probably not. I mean, I see it and so does Hermione, maybe Neville. Possibly Luna. But I'm 99% certain no one else knows or sees."
“Yes, thank Merlin,” Harry said. “Hertha Isolde Merryweather was a teacher with the Promissory School over in Leeds. As far as we can tell, there was no reason, whatsoever, for her to be in London. She did have tickets to the symphony, but that isn’t until next week and she wasn’t on vacation.”
The Goddess sighed. “It’s not supposed to. You are supposed to accept your truths and admit to your lies. You are supposed to leave lighter of heart and with a willingness to embrace me and those who come to you for help. He has done something horrible and twisted it to his will. Because you are honest, I will help you to find him.”
On the other side of the hill stood a house and a few outbuildings. The outbuildings comprised a shed, a chicken coop, a small paddock and a tiny horse stable.
“That’s good -- about her not living here. We don’t need her watching your every move, do we?”
"Listen to your father, Ronald," Molly added. "Now, let's finish up the shopping and go home. There's still some nice summer holiday time left. We shouldn't spend it all at Diagon." She laughed and led them inside.
“It’s just Zach’s mother. According to Zach, his father had other business. Daphne's aunt is one of the Heads too.”
“Little Ru found out the hard way. Her father overreacted about the cluster and had her locked up in some sort of Asylum,” Cloestra explained. “I know we’ve left you out of it, but it wasn’t just you, I promise. We left Draco out as well. And we would have left Luna out of things too, if we could have -- but her connection with Ru, and her gift, well...these things wouldn’t let us.”
“I imagine not, but, still, you have. As has Charlie and everyone else. Luna talks to him a lot, but she hasn’t told him what’s going on and I know...I can feel….he is confused and sad and hurt and angry that we’ve abandoned him. It is not without grief of my own that I have left him alone these past weeks.”
Harry nodded. “Next time you make arrangements for me, Luna, you should tell me.”
Harry grinned, but then shook his head and pointed at the bag. Inside was a vial of shiny, silvery-white powder.
The mirror, which stood against the wall, was old, gold and a family heirloom. It had been enchanted, long ago, by one of his mother’s clan (of Veela).
“I’ve been in the States,” Remus said. “I gather that we’ll discuss it over dinner, for I’m certain it’s part of the reason Augusta invited me. I don’t typically fit in with her lot, as you might guess.”
************
As he left, it occurred to him that Scorpius really fit right in with his family. He wished Draco would too, but he knew it was a waste of a wish.
As soon as the ward-checking was done and it seemed like their teams had split off into their separate groups, Draco pulled Harry into their shared, private office.
Harry nodded. “I have no doubt of that, Ma’am,” he replied respectfully.
Harry loved Draco. He'd loved him for a long time, but it was only the last few weeks that he'd realized he was
Delphinium took a sip of wine before she answered. “Yes. I was also a Slytherin, if that matters.”
When he stepped out of the portal, he was greeted by a cat. The cat was striped orange and white and had very pointy ears and a very bushy tail.
“Yeah, just the usual. I’m fine, Moony,” Harry replied and then he changed the subject. “Where have you been? I haven’t seen you since...since...uh, since you took Hermione to school last year.”
She nodded. “A bit cross that I didn’t tell him.”
As he wondered where to go once he got to the landing, a door to the right of the long hallway swung open and a House Elf wandered out.
"I dunno," said Harry. "It's hard, not being able to see him. It's harder, knowing that most people think we're on different sides of the war."
Ron grumbled and mumbled for the rest of the day, whenever they spoke about school or Harry's other friends, or about the war. By the end, Harry'd had enough.
“Your family. That’s an entire other kettle of sour fish, isn’t it?” Reflection-Harry asked.
“It won’t get fouled up, I promise,” Draco said and then he changed the subject. “So, you’ll need to come to my house...I can’t tonight, but...tomorrow?”
I have also made up some details about Aurors, considering there's very little info in the Wiki.
In a show of support, Andromeda’s face took on a serious expression. “You’ll find the criminal, Harry. You and Draco have the highest clearance or solve rate in the department.”
“I could not be here,” Ru said solemnly. “It was not entirely my fault, but I am sorry that it was as if I had taken a lot away from you.”
“Today, we will be sorting you into your houses,” she said. “There are new Hogwarts Houses and Slytherin House no longer exists. Every single student will be re-sorted. If you choose not to re-sort, you will be asked to leave. Additionally, for the remainder of the year, each and every one of you will be randomly tested for the Dark Mark. If, at any point, you refuse to be tested for Riddle’s Mark, you will be asked to leave. If, at any point, you become Marked, you will be arrested.”
“Yes, of course. And then we’ll get to ask the ritual, itself, about our case and set the tracking spell. But you must face your reflection, Harry -- as will I, when the time comes!” Draco explained against the rising wind.
“Oh Harry, I’m so glad you’re alright!” Hermione said, rather loudly, as she hugged him.
HARRY’S BIRTHDAY (31st July)
Draco had been his partner in the Auror Department for the last three years. Harry wasn't a regular Auror anymore but, more, the equivalent to a muggle superintendent in the British police. He'd worked his way up in the department and was on track to become the Head of the Auror Core in the next two or three years. Even though he was proud of himself for all of that work and achievement, he wasn't sure, anymore, that it was what he wanted. As a Senior Auror, with the title of Captain, Harry still investigated cases, searched for information, put together clues and presented his findings to the Assistant Chief before filing arrest paperwork. He didn't do stake-outs anymore or patrols or responding to complaints; instead, he and Draco were assigned a case by Chief Leopold Rabastan and allowed to work it through, aside from any grunt-work.
Harry and Draco start a new case that isn't so new.
It was a small classroom. The blackboard had the words Team Odin written in a loopy hand across it.
“You may call me Master Peverell. Our house is named after the Norse god Odin. My office hours are posted on the notice board in this classroom, as are the rules and expectations. You will report to this classroom after breakfast each morning, except for weekends. Please follow me up to the dormitory. Prefects will hand out further instructions when we get there.”
(3rd August to 31st August)
He went up the stairs to the ground-floor and into the kitchen for a cup of coffee before he needed to shower and change into his Auror gear. He picked up a few stray toys in the living room and deposited them in the correct bins in the playroom before heading up the stairs. On the top floor, he turned into his bedroom, with its en-suite bath and walk-in closet. Andromeda's rooms were across from his. The floor below him was where the bedrooms for his kids and Teddy were -- James and Albus shared a Jack-and-Jill style bathroom, but Lily had a bathroom of her own. Teddy also had a bathroom of his own.
Harry starts the rest of his summer.
Harry stayed on at Neville’s, but he’d join Hermione at the Weasleys', in the room he had there, in a couple of weeks.
“Mr. Potter,” Severus said sharply as he appeared near the closed door. “We could never really abandon you, and you must learn to believe that. We are always with you, even if you cannot see or interact with us. I promise, I meant you no harm.”
She gave a slight smile. “Caution is always better. Neville sent me. That girl he’s seeing, and thinks I don’t know about her, told him you needed help and that one of us should be here today to help you. Seeing as you’re the Chosen One and she’s a Daughter of Spækona, I decided to heed her warning.”
“Pretty much,” said Ron.
"But there are some pieces of evidence, one witness, and a very key factor -- the calling card of the murderer was left on the body, like the two times before. This third body showing up changes the game. This is now a case to catch a serial murderer," Draco explained. "So let's get to work. The case details and evidence that we have so far..."
“You look a little peaked, Harry,” Hermione said and not without some slight admonishment.
Harry nodded. The hat thing was one truth he could handle -- he’d thought about it often over the years. The things about his friends, though, wow. Not so easy to take, that.
Harry, Neville and the rest of the Odin House followed Master Peverell up to the seventh floor and off to the left, through a set of double doors, and into a large common room.
“Will your friend testify?” Harry asked, suddenly anxious.
Harry took the lead.
Draco and Harry have been Captains (a Senior Auror rank) and partners for the last three years.
"What if he hates me? What if he's disgusted and freaked out that...that I've loved him for years? What if he doesn't want to be work partners anymore? What if...?" Harry trailed off and Ginny could clearly see the tears in his eyes.
Harry drew his wand just as the door opened.
"This is going to be a long case. It's going to be hard and there'll be days where we don't know what we're doing or when we go over everything we've gathered again and again. Emilia and Caio, the two of you were here the last time we dealt with a case like this and I am sorry to say that it's happening again. Captain Duncan and his team thought they were dealing with a singular murder and when they realized its connection to the murders from 2009 and 2011, she notified the Chief and he reassigned it to us. We're the specialists, especially here. Not catching the killer two years ago, or in 2009 was on us. We've been given another chance, as horrible as it is. We need to solve it this time," Harry explained.
**Some Epilogue details have been used.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry stepped back and leaned against the wall as Draco took the spotlight and couldn't help but stare, with his peripheral vision, at his partner. Draco was best in front of their team, way better at communicating and directing than Harry -- though Harry was excellent at demonstration as he had been since his 5th year at Hogwarts. It was thrilling to see Draco in action -- either in front of their team or in the field. It was definitely one of the things that had opened Harry's eyes to how attracted to Draco he was, though, of course, not the only thing.
“There’s no Quidditch!” she exclaimed. “I only just heard about it from Nott.”
He’d stay until it was time to go back to Hogwarts and he was looking forward to it. Here, he’d get to hang out with Ron, Hermione, Ginny and any other Weasleys who happened by. He’d get to eat Molly’s marvelous cooking (though the Longbottom House Elves had been amazing too) and chat with Arthur.
“Did you work things out with Evelyn?” Harry asked.
***********
"Okay, tell me about it," Ginny said as she got up to refresh the teapot. "You wouldn't talk about it last time and I know part of that was because, at the time, we were estranged. But...we're better now, fixed I'd say, so....tell me. I can help you with your perspective."
Neville shook his head. “No idea. I think...since the Headmistress mentioned there’d been a lot of changes and new courses…. I think it has to do with that.”
"Yeah. Lily was so happy that her birthday party turned into a sleepover -- I love how close she is with Alice and Tate. Al seemed pretty happy about it too -- he and Scorpius have such a good friendship, though I really wish Ron would stop all that nonsense about the boy, for Rose's sake. I know it's hard for Al and Rose to be such good friends when Rose isn't comfortable with Draco's son," Ginny said before taking a slice of cake.
"Lieutenants Dune, Emil and Fitzpatrick," Draco said. "We'll meet you in Classroom B for the briefing. Lieutenants Kerr, Pye and Andrews, you've got your orders. When your case is finished, Captain Potter and I would very much like you to join in with the rest of the team and we'll brief you at that time."
"Aren't you, though? I mean, kind of, at least?" Ron asked. "He's a Death Eater, Harry. He's on the run from whatever happened with Dumbledore."
Harry flopped down on his bed. There were tears pressing against his eyes, but there was no way he was going to give in to them.
The next morning, Ron, Ginny, Harry, Hermione, Molly and Arthur, went to Diagon Alley. They weren’t so late as to be in crowds and crowds of people, but they were late enough that Hermione complained about the lack of variety in supplies.
“How does that help us?”
“Neither were you.”
*****************
“I wanted my priests and anyone who worked in my temples to be holy and reverent, honest and good. People who would counsel those among them with only light and truth in their hearts. It’s what my ritual is for,” Opishanata explained.
Before Draco could respond, the mirror went bright with white light and then Draco’s image appeared in it.
That evening, Petunia, Vernon and Dudley loaded up their car and the small trailer that was attached with everything the movers hadn’t taken.
Harry put the dollar-sized trunk into his pocket and slipped on his backpack. He grasped the small key in his hands and did as he had been instructed.
Astoria waved that away. “Are you going to see Friedrich?”
"I know I can trust you, Potter. I'm here, if you need me. As always," Draco replied and then they left their office and went into Classroom B.
Draco sighed. “No. He’s a bit of a recluse and he doesn’t know you. Regardless of you being...you know, who you are...he spooks easily.”
“Well?” Friedrich asked.
*****************
“No Quidditch,” Ginny said sadly as she walked away.
Vernon had shoved Harry, snarled at him not to do any damage to what had once been their home and told him he better defeat that man.
“Well, you could have told me that on the train, Neville,” Ginny admonished.
“I have missed you. I’m sorry I wasn’t around this summer, but I’m back now!” she exclaimed.
It was these dynamics that kept Harry from flat out saying, "Draco, I'm in love with you." He knew, without even a shadow of doubt, that Draco loved Astoria and they were divorced due to her circumstances (blood curse, magick curse) and not because they'd never worked or fallen out of love. Harry valued their friendship and his friendship with Astoria and Al's friendship with Scorpius too much to risk them. And although he often felt consumed with his love for Draco, he wouldn't damage what they had to confess it.
Harry sighed. He knew they’d get to it eventually. Resigned, he nodded. “Yeah. Let’s talk about it.”
“I’m staying in a room down the hall. I had no idea that Neville’s family were this well-off or that they had a home this huge. Did you know?” Hermione asked in her usual firing-questions way.
"The worst thing that could happen, Harry, is that he simply doesn't return your feelings. Do you really think anything else -- anything else bad -- would come of telling him how you feel?"
Suddenly, the whole rest of his cluster, except for Severus, were in the room with him.
The movers arrived the last morning and took away every single stitch of furniture, as well as all the heavier boxes.
“Viktor, good to see you,” Harry said casually. He couldn’t figure out why Viktor was there, but he hadn’t lied -- it was good to see him.
Harry walked to his own desk and sat down in his desk chair. He waited for Draco to speak; he recognized the look on his face -- and so he should, after these last few years of working together. The expression meant that Draco had an idea and that he would, when given a little time, tell Harry what it was.
Harry winced. "I really wish people wouldn't call them that. It's a horrible moniker, but, also, giving these people these glorified Serial Killer Names makes everything far too attractive to people who want to seek the lime-light."
Before lunch, Harry would find himself in the family parlour. He’d sit with Neville’s grandmother and talk. They’d talk for an hour, sometimes more.
“Why didn’t you just say that? Why go on about a tracking spell?” Harry’s voice was exasperated, but not angry.
“What do you mean what are we doing?” Ginny yelled back. “What does it look like we’re doing?”
“That sounds like a bunch of handy excuses. There was no reason that you and Evelyn and Charlie couldn’t be with me. And, Cloestra, we’re your family too.”
