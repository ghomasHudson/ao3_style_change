Draco continued to hold him back though, forestalling Harry’s attempt to bury his face back between his mate’s legs, this time with the goal of licking into his cunt and making him come from his clit.
Draco tried not to let the crushing weight of expectation dampen his determination, especially when Neville looked at him like that, with a shimmery mist of hopeful tears in his eyes.
Malfoy groaned, but managed to pull his hand away from between his legs, and glared up at Harry through heavy lids, cheeks flush and chest positively heaving.
“You taste so fuckin’ good, baby.” Potter slurred, tongue thick in his mouth. “I love your sweet little cock. Gunna make you come again.”
All those traits were just icing on the cake, as his friend knew that Harry had preferences, but the
He cursed, feeling all of his muscles tense up, immediately on edge. His green eyes widened, fixed and staring like he was watching a trainwreck, unable to look away.
Thankfully, he had some leftover cornish pasties that Molly had sent him home with after Bill’s birthday on Wednesday, so he switched out the milk for the container of those, bringing it over to the kitchen table. He hunched over and began to eat, enjoying the homemade treats, but mostly just trying to fill his growling stomach after the long run home from the Ministry to his secluded little cottage in the countryside.
He was naked, unbound, covered in a blanket, and almost completely wrapped up in a stifling embrace.
Potter gave him a winning smile. “This might just be the best day of my life, Malfoy. Now let me celebrate by eating your arse until we both pass out.”
Draco nearly rolled his eyes, and turned back to wave at the man with a smile. “Merci pour l'avertissement.”
“Congratulations, Harry.” Hermione said, her own eyes filled with warmth and love. “You and Draco have two, healthy babies. A boy and a girl.”
‘You will need to expel the inert eggs that have been ‘drained’ until only the viable ones remain, as they will grow in size the stronger they get. Their gestation period is fairly short, only around 3 months or so. But honestly, I don’t know exactly how you will progress, being fully human. I’ll need to keep up the weekly visits, and I’ll likely be able to tell closer to the time of - “ she paused, searching for a word. “delivery.”
Draco wanted to cover himself up, suddenly, wrap himself in the limited protection of his shirt again, but suddenly Potter’s hands were there, hot and demanding, one cupping the slight dip of his waist, the other fully cupping one of his pecks, his thick thumbs finding the lines of two of his largest scars, tracing them reverently.
Draco had fled with his Mother to France after he War, and so, he had had time to acclimate and learn about his Inheritance in relative privacy, and had been lucky enough to have easy access to specialized suppressant potions, that allowed him to live a relatively normal, unremarkable life.
“Much.” Draco replied, bringing his own hand down to rest over Harry’s, staring down at himself, and then back up at Harry. “Right, so. What the
“I - I thought you liked it. Was it not okay?” Harry asked, panic running through him. “I asked for your consent, and you said you wanted it, oh
“Well, I'm sure some aspects of the curse have been pretty obvious to you, so far. He doesn’t remember you, does he?” At Draco’s negative shake of the head, she continued.
He wished now he had thought to bring along some toys, a thick dildo, a plug or two, and his favourite; anal beads. He loved stuffing his arse full, and the thought of being able to stuff himself even more completely, cunt
had been bringing it up constantly, so he settled back in his own chair, arms crossed over his chest, and sulked.
He sent out a quick Patronus to his future mother-in-law (what a thought), and settled in beside Ron, listening to Rosie as she peppered him with questions about the birthing process.
everything was; the light of the full moon shimmered down through the surface of the sea, scattering little glimmers of silver against the waves, trailing down in beams through the shimmering water below.
Draco said this with a sneer in his voice and on his lips, and Harry looked at him, confused, and felt his hackles rise when Ron responded.
Subsequently, Rosie had been hanging off of Draco almost all night, and it was driving Harry mental.
After they had made a verbal compact, shaking hands in front of Beckett to seal the deal, Harry had carefully wrapped an arm around Draco's waist, hand dragging proprietarily over the silk of his corset, turning him and settling a big hand at the small of his back as they walked towards the breeding bench that Draco had noted during his earlier tour of the club.
They were barely waiting more than a few more minutes before the Healer was back, her expression a mix between bemused, and amused.
Draco threw his head back with a cry as Potter began torturing his cockhead, tonguing under his foreskin until it was completely exposed, and then pressing it harshly against his slit, tonguing in again and again, as though trying to fuck his cock with the tapered tip of the wet muscle.
“Need you to push for me, baby.” Harry coached softly, pulling his lips wider, exposing him more, tugging the rim open. “Let’s see if you’re greedy pussy will let it come out easily, or if you’ll need to work for it.”
“So good for me.” Harry continued, fist jerking along his thickening flesh, moving a bare inch up and down, thumb grinding down against his slit. “Gunna get more come out of this gorgeous little prick.”
“But you look so pretty, baby. Stretched so wide around my egg, so sweet and red and good for me.” Harry praised, pulling just a bit more, working the egg through the tight space until finally,
Draco was so full; stuffed and plugged with Harry’s clutch tucked up safe inside of him. The smaller man was so round and full of eggs that he looked to be well into his second trimester, and Harry moaned at the thought of how Draco would only grow more swollen and round as his clutch quickened.
‘Then this afternoon he texted me.” Beckett stopped to laugh, pulling his phone out of the pocket of his jeans. “‘
The distraction lasted only a moment, before Potter pulled back, eyes lit with even more determination as he looked at the rest of Draco’s clothing. Suddenly, he went to his knees before Draco, who’s cock immediately twitched and leaked, eager at the sight.
Draco’s cries were sharper now, the edge of pain and desperation mingling with his pleasure as he came, his cock shooting out burst after burst of pearly cum into the water as Harry jerked him, his cunt throbbing and squeezing as his clit continued to be teased.
Hermione beamed at him, patting his leg. “Happy to help a friend. Now, let's see about getting this all unpacked.”
“I’ll have to look into some research, but...” She was already waving her wand over Draco, casting spell after spell, eyes narrowed in concentration. “I’ll need to take some blood samples as well.”
Malfoy shivered, and his scent heightened, thick on Harry’s tongue. “I’d certainly welcome you to try.”
What followed during Harry’s year of Auror training was a series of relationship disasters, one after another, until Harry had nearly gone mad from it.
The ropey muscles of his forearms were covered in a bright splash of tattoos, swathes of colour and black lines, runes and protective warding circles sharing space with gorgeous renditions of a stag, a doe, a black dog, a wolf, a phoenix, all swirling around his tanned skin up to his thick biceps, up under the sleeve of his tee.
The sun was well risen, high in the sky. Its bright rays filtered easily into his little seaside home. He had bought this house specifically, with his new friend Hermione’s help, because he had fallen in love with the massive windows that covered most of the walls.
“None of that, sweetheart.” Harry reprimanded, taking a firm hold of Draco’s hips and carefully turning his mate over to his hands and knees, making sure he was settled as comfortably as possible in the nest. “You know we need to make more room for the rest of the clutch as they keep growing. You’ll feel better once we get the next one out.
“Let me make you happy here! We can get Hermione to bring you your things, we can buy anything you need to make you comfortable here -”
“We -” Draco started, biting his lip. “We might need to speed this up a bit then. We’ll need to deal with that, before Granger gets here.”
Draco was well beyond all of Harry’s wildest dreams. His work in potions had cured many people, he was a fantastic cook, he was wicked smart, and he knew how to enjoy the quiet things in life.
.” Draco breathed, teary and sobbing. “Of course I’ll marry you. I - I feel like I’ve been in love with you forever. I love you
Shuddering as he forcibly swallowed the seaweed-like mouthful down, Draco immediately felt his stomach clenching, a burning running up through his body.
Harry had grabbed the man and pulled him away, pressing his wand subtly but threateningly into the man’s gut as he snarled into his face. “Don’t. Touch. Him.”
“... the breeding bench.” The blond whispered, clearly trying for nonchalance, but failing quite spectacularly as he nearly squirmed in his seat.
He wanted Potter to look at him with forgiveness in those discerning green eyes. He wanted Potter to accept him for who he had become. He wanted Potter to acknowledge how far Draco had come, and how much he was doing for the integration between Muggle and Wizarding society now.
“Hullo Harry.” Arthur said, patting his sore shoulder consolingly. “Congratulations, and all that. It’s quite good to see you again, my boy. We missed you dearly. I hope everything is alright?”
“We- “ He choked on a breath as Potter stood back up, maneuvering him to wet his hair, before rubbing at his scalp with strong fingers, making Draco moan. “We’ll aim for a late Summer wedding. Before I start showing. But need enough - enough time for Mother and I to start planning. Ngh. P-pastel colour theme.”
All thoughts and concerns left his head as another finger, Potter’s pinky, wormed its way inside, and Potter began thrusting, in, in,
Slipping a hand into his pocket, Harry took a deep breath, leaving the tea service on the table, and swiveled on his knee until he was looking up into the gorgeous face of his mate.
Immediately the hole winked open, fluttering around the bulge of the egg lodged up against Draco’s rim.
Draco snorted, allowing himself to go boneless, thoroughly done with the situation. “Of course not, Potter. Though, perhaps we ought to have expected a physical impossibility from you, of all people.”
He screamed as his neck began to throb with a searing pain, his hands becoming sharp claws as he clutched at his throat.
Draco looked nervous for the first time as they approached the water, a little jar of gillyweed clutched in his hand.
.” Harry breathed, and felt like he was going to likely end up being the one to come in his pants. “Okay, sweetheart. I’m going to make it so good for you. So fucking good.”
Harry ducked his head at that, understanding the sentiment, and watched as the man cast a Patronus charm, his wand tip emitting a silvery mist that coalesced into the shape of a shimmering white peacock.
And so, increasingly desperate, Draco had finally ventured out into Muggle London, trying to find something to tide his lusts over.
A spot that made Draco fairly squirm with embarrassment, and a spot that he could only just barely reach with his favourite toy.
Harry felt the flood of his mate’s cum against his tongue even as Draco’s hips began to stutter, losing all semblance of rhythm as he worked himself against Harry’s face, his cock buried deep in Harry’s mouth.
Draco was completely flush with embarrassment as Harry pressed him down into the nest of the floor of the grotto, so shy with it that he even looked away as Harry hooked his hands under Draco’s knees, spreading him wide.
“Indeed.” The Healer agreed, staring at him, trying to give him time to draw the conclusion on his own.
“She is already beside herself that I’ve been so sparse with details in my letters.” Draco had said. “I can’t just
Malfoy, still flushed a pretty pink and an inch from losing control, looked to think for a moment, but didn’t seem to recall, so shook his head, loosened tendrils of blond hair falling into his eyes.
The Healer nodded, flipping through a few additional spells, all of them incomprehensible to Draco. “It is very viable so far, but you must know that male veela pregnancies are challenging, and require a great deal of care, as well as magical intervention from the father. Should you want to keep it, that is.”
I had the next and final chapter ready to go as a nice wrap up of the plot and ‘what happens next,’ but I’d skipped over some plans for further sex scenes as I was writing it.
Harry had just gotten back from a long run along the beach when he heard Draco yelling. He sprinted into the house, his magic crackling around him, only to find the man smiling in delight, holding aloft a faint lavender potion, already bottled and sealed, with a handful of others on his bench.
Draco had laid out on the sandy incline just where the water crested, and let Harry kiss and lick at his body, his clawed hands careful over Draco’s belly, worshipful and in awe of his mate and his clutch.
He sighed, and then slowly began the process of redressing himself, having to stop to demand that Potter use his apparently unlimited wandless magical skill to fix the buttons on his shirt, and to transfigure it into something less scintillatingly see-through.
Harry let out a soft hum of a laugh, “As if that would matter, Malfoy. I can still breed that sweet little hole of yours, if that’s what you want?”
“Yes, Harry, this is Neville Longbottom, an old friend from your house in Gryffindor at Hogwarts. You’ve known him since you were 11, and have been good friends the whole time since. And stop glowering at him, because if it wasn’t for Neville here, I wouldn’t have taken the gillyweed, and you could never have knocked me up. And he
Harry. You’ve been under a curse, that much is obvious, and Hermione had alluded to it, but is it... broken now? You’re human again, but - was that the cure for it? You just needed to... to breed me?”
Harry’s mate was absolutely perfect for him in every way; Draco’s body so ready for his touch. He couldn’t wait to see if Draco could match Harry’s ultra-high libido; to see how often he could make his mate come over the course of a single day.
Harry feels unaccountably nervous in her presence. He knows he’s met her before, but can’t remember much. Apparently there had been some bad blood there, during a war or some such, though he couldn’t recall much of what Draco had told him.
“I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean.” He shot back, spreading his legs wider, drawing Malfoy’s eyes back down. “You’ll have to be more clear; there are a lot of rumours.”
Harry was simultaneously focused on staring at the oncoming figure, and wondering if he could get away with apparating where he sat, and obliviating the whole club later, when it was safe to come back.
“Let’s get you settled, little one.” Harry murmured, pulling back from their kiss. “Gunna make sure you feel so good, baby, get you nice and relaxed.”
Harry kept his mouth and tongue busy as he began to work Draco through his next orgasm, even as he moved his thumbs, brushing them down and inward, until they bumped together over his mate’s sealed up cunthole.
“P-Potter!” He gasped, unable to move as the other man helped himself to his feast, sucking and biting and laving his tongue over the steadily hardening bud of his nipple. When Harry pulled away, he blew a stream of cold air at the glistening skin, making it tighten further, and Draco hissed.
Potter had enrolled in the Auror Corps straight out of school, only to go out in a fiery blaze of glory after going almost completely off regulation in nearly half of his missions, earning him so many reprimands that he ended up quitting in a spectacular row with the Head Auror that had been so well documented that it have even ended up in the French newspapers.
He was a simple man, so he wasn’t surprised when his hindbrain already had him moving to snatch up the small flip phone.
Potter stared at him, hard eyes assessing. Nearly his whole face was wet, his beard drenched, his nostrils flaring. He stared at Draco for a long, searching moment, and then looked back down at where most of his hand was buried in Draco’s arse, dripping with slick.
“You are more than forgiven, Potter.” Draco breathed, moaning as Harry licked him from base to tip, swirling his tongue around the head.
He looked like the exact type of disaster that Draco loved courting. Like the kind of man who would fuck him, no holds barred, until he was sobbing with it.
In scarcely a moment, they were ushered into a room, and told they would only need to wait a few minutes for Healer Preeti Shivpuri to arrive.
Draco had done a lot of great work in the field since he had become a full Potions Master, specifically in R&D; forcing a bit of a paradigm shift in how brewing was viewed through a more modern lens. He had studied in France, achieving his Potions Mastery as well as simultaneously completing an undergraduate degree in Muggle Pharmaceutical Sciences. His work in combining the areas of Potionry and Muggle Pharmaceuticals was truly groundbreaking.
Finally, the woman stopped, collected her samples and charts, and stepped out of the room, saying she would be back shortly with any results from the tests.
“You’ve gotten my son pregnant, out of wedlock.” She began, looking down her nose at him, despite being the shorter of the two. “You’ve kept him secreted away out here in the middle of nowhere. His friends haven’t seen him, all of the letters that he sends are empty of any real information. He has been taken away from his greatest passion; his work. He’s living
He had meant to meet with his friends for their weekly drinking night at the Dancing Dragon, but he wasn’t entirely sure he could handle another sit down in close quarters with so many people in an environment like a pub. In fact, he was strongly considering heading straight back out for another run, followed up by a long weightlifting session at the muggle gym in the next town over that he had a membership with, and just bringing home takeaway for dinner.
Saliva dripped down his crack, pooling along the leather under his lower back as Potter manhandled his arse open, angling Draco so that he could feast on his hole.
Harry kissed along the other side of Draco’s belly, his opposite cheek brushing the man’s pretty pink cock, smearing the pearly bit of fluid on the tip against his tanned skin.
He heard a wrenching noise as the other man pulled at the strings of his corset, but his protest was swallowed up as Potter kissed him again, filling his mouth again with that otherworldly taste of magic and heat, thoroughly distracting him.
A week passed quickly like this, but Draco was determined to change up the status quo of Harry’s home, as promised.
, was that after Harry’s rather unfortunate run in with Fenrir Greyback just a year ago, when he had been Turned while finally managing to kill the elusive monster, all of his senses had gone into overdrive with his new, werewolf physiology. Suddenly it wasn’t just that Malfoy
“Not right now.” The blond said, groaning at the movement and the subsequent strain on his body. Harry shifted up to help him, fawning over his mate and adjusting the pillows so that he could sit more comfortably against the headboard.
He went, easy and eager, when Potter moved him towards the bench, laying Draco out on his back against the cold length of leather.
Shivering, Draco stared down at those hands, so dark against his own pale skin, and then back up at Potter’s face, who’s expression was rapt, ravenous.
They made dinner together, and nothing had ever made Harry happier than dancing around his mate in the kitchen, learning about Draco’s extreme skill in cooking, and spending a long dinner chatting and learning about one another; about how Draco was a Potions Master, and how Harry had apparently always been dreadful at the subject in school.
“Very well.” Draco said breezily, though he was looking slightly red with embarrassment. “Thank you again for your help with this, Hermione. I really don’t know how we’d get on without your assistance. I’m very grateful.”
He took up a smaller, empty jar, and gingerly pulled a bundle of the dark green plant out, transferring it to the new vessel and attaching it to a little rope around his ankle – an emergency store in case something went wrong while he was underwater.
Draco cupped both of his hands around the slight swells, palming his tits and squeezing them, a low gasp bursting from his lips at the sweet, soft feeling of them, and how sensitive they were to his touch.
“Oh, did you think I was joking?” Draco drawled, tone still acidic, and Harry started to catch on, recognizing his mate's now-familiar sarcasm. Those patrician features remained cold and judgemental for just a moment, before melting into a mischievous grin. “Thank you both for coming.”
Every pound of that thick cock into him made Draco feel like he was coming, over and over, every thrust rocking into that waiting wall of pleasure deep inside of him, rubbing
It had taken him hours to get ready, and still he’d ended up wearing what he always did when going out; a crisp white button up, tailored dove-grey trousers, and his lucky pair of Louboutin pumps, which never failed to make him feel confident and powerful.
Lonely as Harry’s Auror work often left him feeling, especially during cases like this, it had never occurred to Draco to find what he was missing somewhere else. Nobody else could have given it to him anyway, that was the first issue; the second was that he was brutally in love with Harry and not even a year’s worth of lonely nights could have convinced him to jeapordise that.
“Yeah, we have.” Harry reached over and swept his thumb across the opposite cheek Draco had rubbed with his arm, making Draco roll his eyes again. “We’re still tracking their movements, though, before we make a bust and technically I can’t ignore a witness who says they saw something. Especially if it’s to do with the school — parents will go berserk when that gets out.”
The ash on Draco’s cigarette finally falls. He drops it on the ground after and it fizzles out in a puddle. Harry’s stomach is sour and his heart hurts and he feels paradoxically satisfied by the ugly sneer on Draco’s pretty mouth.
Malfoy looked thoughtful, pulling his knees up to his chest and wrapping his arms around them, like he was cold.
poured acid all over my shrivelfigs, Malfoy,” he snapped. Draco’s lower belly flared briefly with heat. Potter was dangerously good-looking when he got pissed.
"Enough, Greg," Malfoy said from behind his hulking form. Several people in the corridor had stopped to watch, but Goyle only had eyes for Harry. He was breathing hard, his mean eyes narrowed. "He didn't do anything."
Harry would have agreed to anything at this point but he still means it when he nods frantically, beyond caring now that he’s at a major disadvantage, that Draco has successfully taken him apart the way he’s so used to doing.
It's early December when it's ready, closing in quickly on the holidays. There's a last Hogsmeade weekend before break starts that nearly all the eighth-years elect to take advantage of in order to see the little village's decorations and buy gifts. Most importantly, though, Potter
against Draco’s pussy, Draco thought about how many times in the past few months he and Potter had volleyed back and forth between fiery, obscene loathing and a carnal, fathoms-deep attraction. It made Draco feel weary with it, exhausted, and most of all, utterly dazed. It required too much energy to keep up, to remember where they stood, what he was supposed to be feeling at any given moment. It was so much easier to stop thinking completely, to just give into the delicious friction of their bodies moving against each other, to wrap his arms around Harry’s neck, legs around his waist, and cling to him like he was the only thing keeping him alive.
“Oh.” Malfoy wrinkled his nose, and then he did something Harry couldn’t have anticipated: he moved even closer, and kissed Harry right on the mouth. “I can’t believe we fucked.”
He looked from Granger to Weasley and back again, seeing apprehension but no immediate sign they were going to do anything rash.
“You’re a troglodyte,” Draco announces with his wet, red mouth. Harry blinks at him. “Of course I love you. And fuck you for taking so fucking long to get there.”
Draco started seeing a Mind Healer. Within just a month Harry started noticing differences — mostly it was that he began letting Harry know when he wasn't feeling good, and together they were able to find things to do to help him cope. It was good for Harry, too, who was certainly still recovering mentally himself, and would be for years to come, he knew.
Lips parted, hot breath echoing off the door and back into his face, Draco allowed himself to be taken apart with the same ferocious intensity he’d seen Harry use on the guitar. Each stroke brought him back to full hardness, each stab against his prostate made his nerves sing a tormented chorus, drowning out the pain of the wooden floor against his bare knees.
to close his eyes and focus on the feeling of being stuffed full, one of his favourite feelings in the world in his own body as well. Potter's lips are suddenly on his jaw, kissing down to his neck, mouthing there wetly as he finishes burying himself in Draco's trembling body that doesn't
Draco thought about what Potter had said just that morning about Professor Boothby and how he despised being used as an example or called into the spotlight.
He holds out his wrist and lets Draco put it on manually, the Muggle way, which Harry likes. Then he does Draco’s, and he just looks at them for a while. His is pointing towards ‘HOME,’ just as it will be for the next four months. Harry’s says ‘TRAVELLING.’
In the common room, not even Hermione was awake yet. She’d still been up the night before when he’d left to meet Malfoy, buried behind so many stacks of books it looked as though she was attempting to build a city out of them. He’d learned a long time ago that nothing good ever came from lying to Hermione, and yet he’d done it again last night. It wasn’t that he thought she would be mad — on the contrary, she might have even approved of his earnest desire to help. The problem was that she would undeniably want to talk about it, the pros and the cons, the risks and the rewards, and Harry didn’t want any of that.
"If I may, Professor McGonagall." Harry's heart leapt and he looked up to find that Dumbledore's portrait was awake and looking down his long, crooked nose at them. McGonagall peered at him with a mixture of respect and ambivalence.
“Why should I?” She straightened her back and looked down her short nose at him. Draco snorted. “It’s not as though I’ll ever need a job.”
. He’d never known Malfoy could be this soft. “I had no idea — I was coming to see Sprout, you’re not …?”
“Good,” Draco says and kisses his cheek once again. His touchy-feeliness is one of Harry’s very favourite things about Draco when he smokes. It’s like he can’t help it. “I’m gonna get some lemonade actually, do you want anything, love?”
“My mother,” Draco fibbed quickly, thinking of what Potter had said when he’d explained his motivation behind speaking at Narcissa’s trial. “She helped Potter in that forest, just before … the end. I suppose appealing for her would have been useless had he allowed my father to receive the Kiss. My mother would have perished from grief not long after.”
“I’m going to tell you why I left.” Harry’s voice was saturated with candor, the look on his face so open, so vulnerable, Draco nearly had to turn away. He had the air of a man baring his soul.
Boothby was late to Defence on Wednesday that week, leaving all the eighth-year Gryffindors and Slytherins queued up outside the door to the classroom. Harry kept glancing at Malfoy, who was standing with Pansy and Blaise Zabini, and it made his chest feel warm to note that Malfoy kept looking at him, as well. He still hadn’t managed to find a time to meet with him, but Harry had slipped him a note in Potions the day before asking if he wanted to meet in the Prefects’ bath tonight. He’d gotten no note in response — merely a surreptitious nod while Slughorn was writing on the board.
, Draco,” Pansy said briskly as they left lunch in the Great Hall and headed for the common room to retrieve their things for afternoon lessons. He had jumped nearly a foot in the air when a fourth-year Slytherin girl had accidentally bumped into him on the stairs. “You
“I fucked you within an inch of your fucking life, that’s what that was. Are you about to register a formal complaint, or what?”
and he just wants to feel it, every pass of Harry's hand over the head of his cock, squeezing and smearing pre-come and then sliding back down. Harry feels hot and hard against him, bigger and thicker than Draco is, and as unbelievable as it feels he needs so much more.
engorged with blood, tight and hard and painful. He physically can’t stop himself from bucking up against Draco’s mouth.
“That kind of turns you on, doesn’t it, Malfoy?” he baited, grin crooked and provocative. The colour on Malfoy’s cheeks doubled. Harry thought he’d never seen anything so endearing. “How very typically Slytherin of you, to be turned on by the idea of power. Never thought you’d like someone
“And obviously I've decided to check if you had any first,” Theo responded smoothly. “Jumpy today, aren’t we?” His gaze swept their tabletop, moved back to Draco briefly, and then with another grin he left and disappeared into the supply cupboard. Draco looked over at Blaise, but he was back to being determinedly focused on the lacewing flies.
When they slip, there is so little time between the moment of falling and Harry grabbing onto him that Draco hardly has a chance to be afraid: by the time his brain has caught up to his body (his heart is fluttering faster than fairy wings and his limbs feel like jelly) the danger has already passed.
He rolls his hips shamelessly against Potter's working mouth, breath hitching when he stiffens his tongue and pushes it into Draco's clenching hole. One of Potter's arms snakes around to Draco's stomach and he holds him in place while he fucks him with his tongue, bringing him quickly to a place where he can feel a second orgasm beginning to build. That slick muscle burrows in and out of him relentlessly, and when he's not doing that he's lapping up his juices like a man dying of thirst, sucking at his swollen lips and sensitive clit and then returning his tongue to its work. Draco rides his face without shame, but too soon, and with a last broad stroke over the whole of Draco's cunt, he sits up again and grins down at him, his chin and cheeks wet.
good. He wants to touch himself, to get a hand around his straining cock, but there's not enough blood or oxygen in his sluggish brain to accomplish that simple movement. He's utterly at Potter's mercy right now, from the hand on his windpipe to the cock driving into him and shaking the bed frame. Amazingly, he's never felt so at peace before.
She marched them both from the Great Hall with fire in her eyes and lips as thin and white as Harry had ever seen them. A silence that quickly broke out into hissing whispers was left in their wake, and Harry saw Slughorn speaking quietly to Malfoy as he led him from the hall as well.
He slid his middle finger in all the way to the knuckle and Draco dropped to his elbows, pressing his forehead against the desk. It was completely obscene for this to be happening
When Potter looked back at him, Draco saw that he had an inkling as to what was on Draco’s mind. He raised an eyebrow, deepening the color on Draco’s cheeks.
"You said you were restless," said Malfoy. "Something to do, isn’t it? I hardly think you feel like fighting, although I s'pose if you wanted to hit me you'd be entitled. Bear in mind Weasley already did that."
“That didn’t sound like a ‘please’,” Harry said lightly, and for good measure rocked his hips, knowing by the way Malfoy shuddered that his cock had passed across his prostate. “Come on, kitten … it’s not hard. Just say it, and I’ll fuck you stupid.”
— that he decided he was simply going to shove his chair backwards, Harry’s arms snaked beneath his legs and spread him wider, holding him securely in place. It took every ounce of strength Draco possessed not to throw his head back and emit a loud, helpless moan. Instead he bent his head forward again, dropped his eyes shut, and took in a deep, steadying breath even as Harry’s mouth moved to his clit and sucked it between his lips.
“No,” Draco said immediately. Some part of him certainly would have liked to agree and get out of there. Another part of him, however, was so desperately curious that it overwhelmed the fear. That, and he wasn’t about to back down in front of Potter. Besides, there was no Dark Lord anymore, right? And the Basilisk, thanks to Potter, was dead. “I want to see it. How do we get down?”
At that moment the portrait hole opened — they could hear Sir Cadogan yelling something that sounded a lot like a challenge to a sword fight — and Goyle walked in. He made a beeline for the dormitories after scanning the common room and, presumably, seeing that Malfoy was absent.
a person can be so disruptive,” said Draco when the greenhouse was cleared out and Harry stepped inside.
it. Maybe he could have made it on his own, muddled his way through all of this by himself and still come out on the other side.
go down there, it’ll make it worse.” She paused, and then said, “I know Harry. Stay here. I’ll handle it.”
'More frequent exams' turned out to mean bi-weekly trips to the hospital wing, and 'more thorough' wound up meaning two hours of tests each visit, so that by the time the last weekend of January rolled around, Draco felt thoroughly poked and prodded and experimented on. Furthermore, Gryffindor was playing Slytherin in the upcoming match next Saturday, which meant Harry had returned his team to daily practices. It might have meant not seeing one another during the week at all, except that Harry had taken it upon himself to start sleeping in Draco’s room almost every night.
“Blimey,” Ron was saying, shaking his head after Hermione had planted a soft kiss on his cheek and told him she’d meet up with them in the common room later. “It’s like we never left, innit? She’s right back at it; next thing you know she’ll have colour-coded schedules for us again, eh, Harry?”
I'll still want to be dating you when we leave Hogwarts. You know, you still haven't told me what your immediate plan is, by the way."
He could have brought this up to Hermione, but he’d been resisting it for reasons he both didn’t understand and didn’t want to analyse. Not to mention the fact that it was so difficult to put into words. He could have talked to Ginny, too, but the thought of it didn’t feel right either.
immature to be thinking about how good it would feel to have his cock buried in Malfoy’s perfect arse when he
“I’m not hitting you, Malfoy,” Harry said softly, reaching for his Moonraker and giving Malfoy a long, searching look. He’d always hated it when Cho had cried. That was something he’d always loved so much about Ginny, that she

“Was that okay?” Potter whispered eventually, and something in his voice sounded just this side of unsure. It was so typical Potter that Draco could do nothing but laugh weakly.
,” Potter said even more softly. “The fact that you don’t feel you deserve it makes me sure that you do. Did you know that remorse can heal a soul?”
, though — it had been Emily, the cute little blonde-haired witch he’d been dating a year now, who had turned out to be less cute and little than she was needy and suffocating. This disaster was the proof, if he’d needed it.
To his surprise, Ginny lifted a hand and cupped his cheek for a brief few seconds; there was a pain in her eyes that he wished immediately he could forget, and suddenly he regretted this conversation. How could he have been so stupid to talk about this with
“I should find Ron and Hermione.” The numbness was back, a feeling like time had stagnated and reality was so thin he could tear a hole in it. “What are you doing?”
.” She paused, lifting her eyebrows. “But realising you’ve fallen in love with Malfoy and want to see him back in his real body?
Harry tried to think, looking at him, if there had ever been a time before when he’d felt a sexual attraction to Malfoy. He wondered whether other blokes could make him this hard, or if perhaps it was a Malfoy thing, if there had simply been so much volatile emotion simmering at the surface of their hatred for one another, for so

perfect; and Tonks’s werewolf, before Remus had married her. He wondered with a sudden ferocity what Malfoy’s Patronus would be.
— and he tipped his head forward against the back of Draco’s neck and dug his nails into his stomach and clenched his teeth and felt the body under him tense and gasp and —
“I want to,” Draco countered. He met Potter’s eyes defiantly. “You didn’t have to save my father from the Kiss in the first place, and … and I can’t imagine it was easy to explain to the people in your life. And …” Letting the word linger, he reached for Potter’s hand, thrilling at the contact, and pressed the palm over his chest, just above the small bump that indicated the little Snitch. It didn’t respond to Potter’s touch, didn’t become warm like it did for Draco’s hand, but Potter seemed to know what it was anyway because he smiled all the way to his eyes.
many mixed messages in your life, my angel … you’ve been forced to live through things no boy your age should ever have had to live through, and now, on the other side of the worst of it,
“Sorry, were you reading that?” a voice said spitefully, and Draco looked up to find a rather burly boy standing before him, a scarlet-and-gold tie telling him this was a Gryffindor. Not from his year, but surely no younger than seventeen, either.
"I don't have an angle," Harry went on, since Goyle was looking at him again and clearly less interested in either Ron's or Hermione's intentions. "I'm trying to get to know him."
what?” His voice broke on this last word; tears swelled in his eyes and dripped out of the corners. “Then I have his fucking kid and turn back into myself just for him to realise he doesn’t fucking
Since the day Potter had eaten him out, the most they did was steal quick kisses when they got the chance, and on Wednesday nights spent long hours snogging one another breathless in the empty classroom. Potter was being unbearably gentlemanly about the whole thing, never pushing for more, always letting Draco lead the pace.
Draco was having mood swings and craving French Onion soup, which Kreacher made for him gladly every time.
“Harry,” Draco gasped, hands curling around the edge of the desk as Harry pistoned into him, throwing him against the hard wood and creating what would surely be bruises on his thigh later. “I’m gonna — I’m sorry, I can’t —”
been, and if distancing themselves from Draco and his Dark Mark made them more comfortable, well ... they only had three more months left until none of them would ever have to see each other again if they didn't want to.
“Don’t be an idiot, Theo,” Draco said brusquely, the words having touched a nerve which had been causing him great mental anguish the last three months he’d been in this body. “You do realise that in my ancestors’ eyes, both the Black
Harry very deliberately met Draco’s eyes. There was something significant in that terribly expressive gaze, something which made Draco’s heart take a flying leap up into his throat.
“Yeah,” he nodded, fingers twisting in the front of Harry’s robes even as his smiled waned. Harry picked up on it immediately:
"I think Harry's right. If you don't mind my saying, you have always had a way with words, Professor." McGonagall's lips pursed, but Harry saw a pink tinge come over her face. "I think you should be able to remind them all quite effectively that the use of Dark Magic or indeed any spell meant to harm others will not be tolerated without mentioning Mr Malfoy by name."
"A break wouldn't be the worst thing in the world," Draco admitted, lifting his arms above his head and yawning on cue. "He's bloody exhausting."
When Harry finally moved to pull Draco’s knickers off altogether, Draco could think of nothing to do besides help. Because nothing could be better than this —
The shock (and was that embarrassment?) in Malfoy’s eyes set Harry’s blood on fire. Again he felt the urge to kiss him, to taste humiliation on that sharp tongue, and fought it.
“Yes and no,” Potter said finally. Draco’s stomach dropped — some part of him had never believed it.
, Potter,” Draco bit out, “is me trying to hammer it into your woefully dense Gryffindor brain that just because you saved me from burning to death alongside Vince in that Fiendfyre
“Hermione,” Harry said urgently, stepping forward and taking her elbow, only to have her shake it off. Beside Draco, Weasley had just sprung to action and was racing down the steps. Draco blinked several times and felt his heart climb up into his throat, where it seemed to have lodged itself for good.
, Father,” Draco said, voice shaking badly but no less resolute because of it. The words stung, but they weren’t surprising — not if he looked deep inside himself. “This hex wasn’t the only thing I came here to tell you about.”
,” he said, slipping his hands down to Draco’s waist, where they circled its small circumference easily. “I swear to you, it isn’t this body I’m in love with, it’s
Everyone was on their feet, for one thing. Hermione and Daphne were back a few yards from Draco, who stood motionless behind Goyle. Goyle had his wand on someone, who had their wand on him in return. Harry dropped the bottles and immediately reached for his own; peripherally, he saw Ron do the same.
"Go on, Draco," she said, her voice soft but carrying that note of parental authority he was used to from his childhood. "We won't be long."
Potter only stares at him. He's still frowning. Draco thinks for a second he might not even answer, but eventually he does.
“I’m sorry for what I said.” Harry shakes his head and rubs his palm over his cheek, rough with almost a week’s worth of stubble. “I just … I shouldn’t have said any of it. I’ve been stressed with this case they’ve been having us help out with in training, they’re so fucking – there’s just all this protocol, all this extra shit we have to do especially because we’re trainees and I — the point is, it started irritating me having to recount it again for you every time I came over, and it made me feel … weird, you know, having you be worried about me, and I just …” He sighs. His hand goes to Draco’s leg, which he doesn’t move. Harry smiles a little. “It was really selfish to have yelled at you about it. I know you’re going fucking crazy in here not being able to leave or send owls or anything, I could’ve been a bit more compassionate. I’m really sorry, Draco.”
“Did you really die?” Draco asks bluntly. He wants to see shock on Potter’s face, wants to know he’s taken him off guard, made him uncomfortable, so he can feel even a fraction of the turmoil Draco is going through.
“Harry!” Her cheeks were flushed red and she looked to be fighting to remain stern, but the sparkle in her eyes gave her away. “Of course I’m not going to repri
“What d’you like about him? I mean, I could give you a dozen and a half reasons I like Hermione right off the top of my head, y’know? Do you … I mean, do you
ed his wand, spelled them both clean, and then pulled the covers up. Draco turned in towards him immediately and raised an eyebrow.
thought he would admit it, but I had an inkling he was already enamored. Of course he asked you to stay.”
Tucking himself clumsily back into his pants but not bothering to zip back up, he reached down and grabbed Draco’s hand, pulling him to his feet and standing as well. His mouth was on Draco’s in a matter of seconds, and Draco moaned into it, imagining Potter tasting himself on his tongue.
The reference to something Granger had once said to him was not lost on Draco — those words, so humiliating, had lodged themselves in Draco’s brain forever, it seemed. Potter, he had learned in the last couple months, was really quite dry and sarcastic, and his teasing — at least when it was directed at Draco — was often merciless. This was nothing terribly new, of course: Potter had always gotten under his skin. The difference was that Draco had never before experienced it in a way that made his blood boil with lust instead of rage.
“Do you mind if Harry and I talk alone?” he interrupted her. It was not facetious, nor was it polite. He said it in a monotone, stopping any conversation before it could get started.
Hermione reached across her books and covered Harry’s hands with one of her own. He became aware of his picking and stopped. She had been trying to break him of this painful habit since they’d returned to school.
"Let's stay here tonight," Draco said suddenly, without lifting his head. "Just this once, it's already late anyhow. Theo and Blaise'll just think I went down to breakfast early when they wake up."
powerful enough in this case, though,” he answered smoothly. Draco felt his heart skip and wondered vaguely when the fuck Potter had turned into Prince bloody Charming.
It was not the man Draco had always known staring back at him. It was even worse than it had been last time. There were deep, dark circles beneath his dull grey eyes and his hair was thin and dirty, hanging limply in front of his face. There was a sneer twisting his mouth, but it lacked all the lustre Draco remembered.
Draco tilted his head back so his eyes could meet Potter’s. They were sparkling with mirth and something else, something
"Maybe not, but you're certainly putting a lot more weight on the bad things than the good ones. I understand that it frightens you." He drops his hand and takes off his glasses again, wiping them on his shirt instead of spelling them clean. "You have a rough history together. And if you truly did fight as often as you say then perhaps it
For the first time since the day Pansy had lent him a bra and shown him how to use it, Draco managed to put the damned thing on without fumbling once. A shadow of a satisfied smile came onto his face before he realised what he was smiling about. That was quick to remove it.
Harry, who had absolutely no qualms, gave a little nod. He used his wand to snuff out the candles around the room before settling under the covers. He draped an arm over Draco's waist and found his lips in the dark.
“Mum,” he choked, trembling hands still twisted fiercely around her robes, hardly daring to believe this reaction. “You’re not angry?”
“I knew something like this was going to happen,” she snapped, gesturing around the flat which had only an hour ago looked like a nuclear test site. “It was bound to, eventually, the way you’ve been acting! Like a — a —”
Within just five minutes, Harry saw his breathing starting to even out and knew he'd fallen asleep. He wondered if it was a coincidence, or if his presence had had something to do with it. He watched him for a few minutes, taking note of the dull ache in his chest that the sight evoked. He could have left, but he found he didn't have the heart to. He'd said he would stay, and that hadn't meant just until he fell asleep. What if he woke up?
There's a cigarette between his lips and he doesn't bother answering Pansy's enquiry, making the childish decision to let her wander around looking for him in the dim light given off by dozens of candles. He prefers them to the Muggle electric lights Harry had forcibly introduced him to, which usually just serve to give him a headache.
been talking.” Harry looked across the table at Hermione meaningfully, and yet it was several more long moments before he saw comprehension begin to dawn in her eyes.
“I saw Malfoy Wednesday night,” he explained, “after the — er — incident with Helstrom.” Hermione’s lips pursed, for she had been highly disapproving of the way it had been handled, but she didn’t interrupt. “I thought he might have been angry with me —”
“I already told you I don’t hate you, Malfoy.” Harry’s voice had taken on a sharp edge, something that served as a warning against any further attempts at making up bullshit excuses. “And if you hated
Harry nodded, trying not to squeeze too hard where he was gripping Draco's thighs and bending him in half. He pulled out just a few inches and pushed in again, doing this repeatedly, moving inside him while Draco's walls contracted around his cock. Their lips moved together slowly, tasting and exploring, and at some point Draco moved his hand between them and skimmed his fingers lightly along the line of his cock, hard again finally, like he was teasing himself with the touch.
“Only if you take yours off, too,” he said, and Harry was delighted to see a little smirk on his face.
“It wasn’t my fault,” he blearily insists, sinking to the floor again a second after Potter vanishes the mess. “I had no choice.”
Draco looked at him, contemplating, and finally shrugged. "Hard to describe. Just feels really difficult to think. Sort of, like ... hard to make decisions, I guess. But not in a bad way," he added, probably seeing how much Harry didn't like the sound of that by the expression on his face. "I s'pose for someone else it might not seem comfortable, but I like it. I like not thinking, I like just ... trusting you to have control of the situation, so I don't have to. It feels good. I mean —
He swigged back the rest of his beer and banged the empty glass down on the table. Dean hollered cheerfully.
“Yeah,” he nodded, leaning back against the wall. “I haven’t had a chance to talk to him this week, Quidditch practise kept me too busy. You — er — haven’t seen him, have you?”
"I think it's more just that nobody really fancies being singled out for getting on your bad side," said Hermione knowledgeably. "That's all."
“Good,” Draco rasped, shifting his hips a bit and letting out a pitiful whimper when he felt the rigid flesh of Harry’s cock slide deeper inside. “God, so good, Potter, that feels …
In lieu of words, Draco merely nodded. He fiddled with the loose neck of Harry’s shirt and sniffled back more tears.
"When did you start smoking so often?" he asks. The question takes Draco by surprise, feeling irrationally as though Harry's accusing him of something.
Malfoy nodded. “I’ve ordered a few things, but I don’t have all that much money on me at school, and I can’t very well ask my mum to send me clothes
“You shouldn’t’ve come back, Malfoy,” the blond’s tormentor growled, and when he stabbed Malfoy in the chest with his wand, Harry’s hand tightened on his own. "You should be rotting in Azkaban next to your murderer father."
Harry pulled himself back up onto his feet, shins dripping warm water and bubbles onto the tiled marble floor, and went over to Malfoy, still mesmerised by the difference in height, and he could see something both uneasy and defiant flicker across Malfoy’s face as well when he had to look
The food disappeared from his mind, though, when suddenly, from around the corner just ahead of them, he heard screaming start. Not just regular screaming, either, but that of someone being tortured. A wave of sickening fear passed over him, bringing him sharply back to the dungeon of Malfoy Manor where he'd heard Hermione's shrieking cries coming from upstairs — back to the graveyard, where Voldemort had cast the Cruciatus curse on him not once, but twice ...
“Go on,” Draco said, maintaining his calm countenance by a thread. Theo would not look away, and neither would he. It would have been bad enough before, when there really
"We know you are, Potter," said McGonagall. "I'm very proud of you, sticking up for Mr Malfoy this way. Albus is quite right — not many possess such a capacity for growth and forgiveness."
“I know,” Harry grumbled, feeling that Malfoy’s tone couldn’t have summed up Harry’s own feelings more accurately. “A nightmare, he is. Can’t get through a lesson without bringing me into it. It’s like Lockhart all over again. I keep having to tell him I don't know what the bloody hell I'm doing.” He expected Malfoy to sneer, or at least tease him, to bring up Harry's rant from not an hour ago about his loathing for that sort of attention. To his surprise, however, Malfoy was looking at him contemplatively. “What?” he asked, a little self-conscious.
Instead of answering, Harry slides his hand over Draco’s cock, hard and leaking a wet spot against his sweats. He thumbs the head and feels Draco shudder against him, another delicate sound coming out of his throat. Harry runs his nose along the velvet, breathing hot against Draco’s skin.
“Potter,” he drawled, cutting Fowler off mid-sentence. Harry felt his hackles instantly rise. Fowler looked nonplussed, and after going back and forth a few times between the looks Harry and Malfoy were giving one another, he apparently decided scarpering was prudent. “We need to discuss —”
d curtains, Harry had realised how starved he’d been, and had taken her apart with a ferocious intensity. But when he’d rolled off of her, sleepy and sated in a way he hadn’t been in years, he’d realised something else: he wasn’t in love with Ginny anymore.
On the day of the match, there wasn’t much time to see one another. Malfoy was up to his ears with work to do and Harry was busy talking his team through their repertoire of plays one last time. However, just ten minutes before the crowds were due to be let into the stadium, Malfoy pulled him away under the guise of needing to speak with him; they went up to the top box, empty for now, and Harry wasted no time at all shoving his tongue inside that sweet-tasting mouth.
"Oh, I'm not," said Harry, still sitting on the bed, his softening cock tucked back in his trousers. "I can't stand that stuff. I mean, I think it's funny and kind of endearing or whatever when it's other people, but it's not for me."
A note had been charmed to hover above his bed, so he wouldn’t miss it. Draco plucked it right out of the air and read, in Potter’s untidy scrawl:
Draco lifted a hand and skimmed his fingers along the terrible scar on Potter’s chest, where a locket with the Dark Lord’s soul inside of it had apparently attempted to choke him to death.
. Naturally, this idea had occurred to him many times since then — didn’t he alone have some sort of firsthand experience with death? He
“We should kick everyone out after they finish these ones,” he hums into Harry’s ear. “I’m very anxious to make up for burning your poor arm.”
When they walked into the Great Hall at just past seven, the ball was already in full swing. Tables littered the perimeter while the very middle was being used as a dance floor. At the far end, a large, marble half-wall had been erected, and on it were hundreds of names — everyone, apparently, who had given their lives in the fight against the Dark Lord. Floating above it, surrounded by hovering candles, was a picture of a red-headed woman and a man beside her who looked startlingly like Potter. They were dancing in their little frame, taking part in the festivities in their own way, Draco supposed. He had grown up knowing James and Lily Potter’s names, yet he realized now he’d never actually seen a decent picture of them.
Hidden beneath the Cloak, Draco couldn’t say anything about this peculiar password. He followed Harry inside when the portrait swung open and immediately looked around; the Gryffindor common room was, in a word, cosy. It’s furniture was overstuffed and inviting, the atmosphere lighthearted, and the theme uncompromisingly red-and-gold. The tall windows afforded its residents an enviable view of the grounds, and created an illusion of airy openness that could never be achieved in the Slytherin dungeons.
What really sent Draco into a tailspin, however, was the firm press of what was undeniably the hard outline of Potter’s cock against his leg.
“I’m really sorry, Malfoy,” he says, trying to keep the laughter out of his voice only semi-successfully. Malfoy scowls, and that’s endearing too. It’s less venomous than he remembers it being in school. Plus it’s hard to take him too seriously with that bit of dirt on his face and when Harry had just witnessed him elbow-deep in soil. God, he looks
On Tuesday, as Draco was leaving Arithmancy and heading to Transfiguration, a voice stopped him in the corridor. He tensed up immediately, but not for the reason he’d become so used to doing — flinching at people harassing him, mostly — but because he recognised the voice so well.
provided him with clothing, and she’d played the part of the protective best friend flawlessly. A little
"Ooh, I'm terrified, Potter," Draco says in a childish voice, which causes Harry to snort into his tea and spray it all over his face.
“I told you how I can help,” Harry said finally, lifting one shoulder in a shrug. “I’m not fighting with you.”
He gets up and, cigarette dangling from his lips, pulls his pants on as well. He goes over to the window and blows the smoke out of it. Predictably, Harry follows him, waiting for an answer. Draco feels a very small twinge of irritation that's almost habitual in nature, as if his body had chosen to react before his mind even had a chance to process anything.
“I have another lesson to get ready for,” Draco snapped. “So if you wouldn’t mind buggering off and, I don’t know,
“I love you,” Draco said definitively. Harry felt his stomach do a spontaneous little flip. “This whole thing has been weird as fuck, Potter, but I’ll tell you one thing: I really believe everything will be okay. I know I’m not the best at, you know …
"Oh my god!" Harry yelled, shoving Malfoy so hard he fell sideways, laughing, onto the sofa. "Shut up! Shut up!"
, so guess what? If I feel like acting like a teenager, then I’m gonna act like a bloody teenager, all right?”
Even as he sank down over Potter’s thick length, it was hard for him to believe he was doing this, that he was sucking Harry Potter’s cock in a chamber just off the Great Hall, where hundreds of witches and wizards were celebrating Potter himself. He imagined the looks on their faces if they knew their Golden Boy, their Saviour, was just barely restraining himself from fucking an ex-Death Eater’s mouth.
“Yes, dear?” she said mildly, tying a scarf around her slim throat now. When he didn’t answer for a moment, she looked around at him. “Draco?”
Harry waited beneath his Cloak outside the Slytherin common room until half past one in the morning, at which point he grudgingly admitted to himself that he was wasting his time. What made it most disappointing was how utterly sure he’d been that Malfoy really had meant it when he’d said they could talk tonight, but Harry supposed it had been foolish to put any stock in anything Malfoy had to say. A tentative truce didn’t negate seven years of hatred, after all.
“No, it doesn’t,” Ginny said frankly. “Not one little bit. He’s done so many terrible things, Harry. I’m not … I’m not trying to patronise you. I
The first day back at classes after the rest of the school returned, Draco did something he never would have believed of himself: he skipped the lessons he had with Potter. And not only that, but he didn’t go down to the Great Hall for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. He asked Pansy to bring him food, but it was Theo who wound up doing it. He had a knowing look on his face when he handed Draco his plate, but he said nothing, and somehow that was even more infuriating.
“I’m not.” He rubbed his forehead and looked at her again, exasperated, defeated. “I’ve … had some sense talked into me.”
On one of the unused desks he found a scrap bit of parchment and used his wand to spell out ‘12 Grimmauld Place London,’ which he then handed to Draco.
For his part, Draco found himself more infatuated than he'd known he could be with another human. Harry was the same, and watching him interact with the baby was truly one of the most gut-wrenching things Draco had ever seen.
"Well you're getting it," said Harry. "Personally my favourite part is how twice in a row I fucked you speechless —"
"Still good?" Potter breathes against his ear. Draco nods, trying to find his voice. He feels so full he can hardly move, even just a minor shift of his hips drawing a soft moan from him.
“Harry,” Ron’s voice drifted across Harry’s consciousness as if from far away. After several more moments where Malfoy finally realised Harry was staring and they simply looked at each other, he finally tore his gaze away, something achy and longing in his chest.
"I'm sick of it!" said Goyle loudly. He shoved the Slytherin boy away from him and he toppled backwards into two seated Ravenclaws, who barely managed to catch him. Back a ways, Malfoy was staring with wide, luminous eyes, looking quite frozen. "I tell you, I'm sick of it! It's every day, Professor!"
to you,” Hermione said. She looked conflicted, and Harry thought he knew why. He felt conflicted himself for the same reason. It
and a tray of food in its hands so huge it seemed it would squash the creature beneath it in mere moments. Potter leapt off the bed so fast Draco fell sideways; he took the overlarge tray from the pitifully tiny elf and set it on Draco’s desk.
The words hit home in such an unexpectedly profound way that all Harry could do was nod and look down at his lap again, hands gripping the edges of the tub so tightly his knuckles had lost their color.
“I’m pregnant,” he said. He waited, aware of his pulse fluttering in his neck, his heart beating savagely against his rib cage, and nothing happened. Harry just stared.
“You know the answer to that,” he said evenly. “I mean, what d’you want me to say, Draco? You want me to
in return; it was just that Harry didn’t know how to go about navigating this strange, utterly unforeseen dynamic the two of them had unwittingly developed over the last month, and he very much wanted to avoid anybody getting hurt if he could help it considering the special circumstances.
“Fine, fine,” Harry droned, lifting his hands in a completely sarcastic show of acquiescence. “I have to go talk to McGonagall anyway.”
It was himself he saw in the reflection, the same one he'd gotten used to seeing for eighteen years before Conway had taken it away from him. He lifted the gown and looked at himself, dazed over it, and he ran a finger along a healing scar along the bottom of his abdomen, the one from the c-section. That, apparently, would stay, just as his
different. There are so many things we can't talk about, so many things from my past, from his past, things that are too ... too painful, too difficult."
“And what is it you’re going to do with that name should you manage to get it?” She moved away from the wall as well, looking at Harry with worry written all over her face.
It went on this way all throughout the weekend and into the following week; Harry would see him around the castle and remind himself not to stare, not to approach, and after all, this
Draco sobs. There’s thunder and he screams again. He puts everything into it: his guilt and sorrow and fear, all of his hatred, all of his anger. He thinks of the people he hurt, the people he tried to hurt, the Snatcher whose life he stole. He feels his insides squirm in revolt. There’s agony first, guilt and remorse manifesting as real physical agony that bleeds into his screaming. And then there’s something else:
He pulls Harry's glasses off and throws them aside on the bed, pushing his fringe back and drinking him in like he's seeing him for the first time in years. Harry lets him look, saying nothing, candles reflecting their flickering flames in his green eyes. His scar is beautiful and terrifying, the point of inception right at his hairline and branching out into thin, haphazard lines — like lightning — across half his forehead. He kisses it, and then the apple of Harry's cheek, and then his mouth.
that competent or perceptive, he doesn’t care what sorts of things they’re saying he did last year — but enough so that he’s confident it’ll work.
“Oh, I’ll need more than that if you wanna make up for burning me,” Harry tells him, cheeky grin back in place. Draco rolls his eyes and Harry hears both Dean and Ron making retching noises while Seamus wolf-whistles.
have to do with anything?" Draco scoffed, clearly trying for ignorance, but Harry could see that Hermione wasn't buying it, and nor were Goyle or Ron. "Potter's woefully slender grasp on the concept of romance is of no concern to me."
capable of focusing on his studies. A flush has crawled over his skin and there's a distinct warmth low in his belly.
Draco began setting empty pots around the workstations in preparation for his first class, trying his hardest to remain casual and not to let his gaze wander to Harry.
Draco felt helplessly exposed sitting naked on the bed, watching with rapt attention as Harry pulled off his shirt and his jumper in one go, then took care of his denims and pants as well. Now that he’d been introduced to them so intimately, Draco could see every scar standing out white and terrifying against Harry’s dark skin as he climbed onto the mattress.
Eventually, as it was nearing two, his eyes started itching with sleep. He put his arms on the bed next to Malfoy's slight frame and rested his head on them, meaning only to rest his eyes for a few minutes, but he too was asleep not long after.
“Don’t be daft.” Not sure why he was doing it, Draco lifted a hand to brush away the fringe of Potter’s messy hair, exposing his famous lightning-bolt scar. He dragged the pad of his thumb across it, very much aware that he’d never gotten such a close look before. Aware, too, that he, like everyone else, had attached some sort of mythic importance to it. His chest expanded with an emotion he couldn't identify. “It’s you they’re honouring, Potter. You’re the one who saved us.”
as difficult and overwhelming as the year they’d taken their O.W.L.s. Every professor seemed to have forgotten the fact that theirs was not the only class, and hour by hour the homework was building up until Harry found himself wondering whether Hermione’s colour-coded schedules might not be exactly what he’d wind up needing.
“Looks like nothing happened, doesn’t it?” Ron spoke, plucking the words directly out of Harry’s thoughts. His head was turned towards the castle, body twisted so he could get a good view out of the small carriage window, and the statement made both Ginny and Hermione look as well. Hermione appeared contemplative, while Ginny merely cuddled herself closer to Harry, who had an arm draped across her shoulders.
"That was so sweet, Harry, thank you," she says, getting up from her desk and going to take it from him. Draco keeps his gaze resolutely down on his lap.
“I suppose it doesn’t.” Theo tilted his head, eyeing Draco contemplatively. “At the end of the day, my father’s still going to have his soul sucked out through his mouth come February.”
"Only you, Potter," said Draco with another roll of his eyes, dropping back down. He looked pleased, though, which tickled Harry endlessly. He felt, if possible, even happier about the whole thing. "Well they'd have been mad not to, wouldn't they? You already passed the ultimate Auror test last year."
Malfoy merely stared at him, and after a few moments of this it was Harry who finally flew over and landed beside him in the stands, windblown and confused and more curious than he’d ever been in his whole life.
“He wasn’t insulting your family, Malfoy!” Weasley shouted, then looked around, alarmed by his own outburst. When it was clear they hadn’t been heard, he rounded on Draco again, this time in a hissing whisper. “He was
Harry pulled him in with an arm around his narrow shoulders and Draco didn't tense for a second, immediately putting his face in Harry's neck and breathing out a sigh against his skin. It was a perfect time to bring up the idea of Draco talking to someone again, but he couldn't get it out. Instead he held him and stroked a hand up and down Draco's chilly arm.
look — obsessively, even. He traces the lines of that beautiful, terrifying scar with the pads of his fingers, and commits the shapes to memory, and knows that he could draw it with his eyes closed if he wanted to.
“It’s nearly three in the morning, Potter,” he breathed, hissing when Harry nipped at the corner of his jaw.
The grass is wet from a week of constant rain; it soaks through Draco’s trousers to his knees, into his skin, cool and damp. The air is warm but a chilly breeze is blowing, bringing with it the dark, dank, earthy smell of the forest. It rustles his hair and reminds him of his mother and father, and he allows himself to cry. Not harsh sobs anymore but silent tears that roll down his cold cheeks and drip off his chin.
It's all the evidence he needs to know he's right, Harry's dating her, or at least well enough on the way.
Draco kicked at him again, but this time Harry bent his knee and blocked it, laughing. Soon, however, they found themselves kissing again, only this time it eventually tapered out as Draco began drifting off. They didn't speak: Harry watched him fall asleep, wrapped up in a Gryffindor-themed Weasley jumper, and his last thought before going under himself was that he couldn't remember the last time he'd been so comfortable.
Ron spent quite a lot of time looking constipated, and though Draco shot him one or two weird looks he didn't seem to realise anything was going on.
His hands trembled as he lifted the delicate chain over his head and tucked it beneath his shirt. It was warm against his skin, and when he touched it once more, it fluttered its wings again.
When Goyle had his extra lessons, usually in the evenings, Harry took to actually spending time with him in secluded places around the castle, and Malfoy didn't protest it. It was a little awkward at first, their conversations stilted or else nonexistent, both of them simply working on homework, but slowly, after a few days and then a week, it started feeling more normal. That was when Hermione made her first attempt to join them, and when it was successful, she brought Ron along the next day. Of course this could only happen when Goyle was otherwise occupied and they were able to sneak off, because he was still shooting Harry death-glares whenever he got the chance, but it was a start.
Harry nodded along, Draco taking a flight of stairs. “Here we are,” he said, standing in front of a dark wooden door. It was decorated with trees and a starry sky. He pushed the door open, revealing a big room with plenty of windows lighting it. It was a light blue colour with a dark blue sofa. Next to the window was an easel and a cabinet full of art supplies.
“During the wedding ceremony, there was little chance of Remus being denied the claim of Lord. However, was he for example the heir of a family, or was he lord himself, he could not claim the title of Lord Black.” She looked at him to see if he understood. “Because he had neither of those things, he was allowed to make the claim of Lord Black.” Harry nodded in understanding.
“It was his dying wish,” he said, only to realise that the women couldn’t have known he was dead. “He lies in the Shrieking Shack, we couldn’t carry him.” She nodded.
“I will take care of all that, but I do need both of you to agree with this, if one of you think it's too dangerous or that you can not omit certain truths to the order, I need to know. This is too important, and they can’t know Draco’s real mission, as they would stop him no matter that it is what is necessary.”
He’d have to deal with his erection before he left, but it looked like his evening might be shaping up.
Draco barely had time to flinch as a dark mass suddenly wrapped around him from behind. He reached for his wand on his thigh, but a hand was already there, wrapped around the handle of it, pulling it away and bringing it up to point under Draco’s chin.
“So good for me.” Potter murmured, and then began lapping up all of the come that had splashed across Draco’s torso, moaning in pleasure at the taste, and sucking yet more marks onto Draco’s pale skin in all of the gaps between the rope that criss-crossed the expanse.
Draco had proven every inch the Potion Master he had told Harry he was. His mate was hellbent on brewing his new potion meant to cure dark curses using the Mermaid Thistle that he had originally been in Harry’s territory to collect. Harry spent fascinated hours listening to his mate describe his work, his whole process, how he actually
fine.” Draco insisted, “It’s just that, with our track record, I’d rather make absolutely sure nothing
“Oh, Harry.” She said with a sigh, finishing her diagnostic spells and turning to look at him, her brown eyes full of compassion and consternation. “It’s really not... the best medical scenario I could have envisioned, but Draco appears to be fine, and your clutch as well. The gillyweed really helped a great deal, I think.”
. Circe, his beard was full and thick and Draco could practically feel what it would be like rubbing between his thighs -
The look on Malfoy’s face was entirely satisfying, his grey eyes gone wide, his high cheekbones dusted with the sweetest blush he’d ever seen.
But Harry would forever be grateful for the chance meeting despite the terrible sex, because Beckett had introduced him to a whole new world, one where Harry could fully escape the pressures of being a recognized celebrity and where every potential sexual partner might end up going to the press with stories about the Saviour’s sex life.
Draco took another deep breath, seeming to calm slightly, and went boneless, his rim giving up, his body held up only by Harry’s hold.
“Ha, ha, Malfoy.” Harry snarked back. “It’s to help bring your blood sugars back up. You’re likely dehydrated and close to a sub drop, at the moment.”
over the bud of his swollen clit, until just minutes later, Draco was shaking through his first orgasm.
They absolutely hadn’t worked out, had been basically doomed from the minute they had left the bar to try and fuck back at Beckett’s place. Sure, there had been a strong chemistry, but the minute they’d gotten down to the logistics, it had become clear that they were both too dominant, too unwilling to cede any power in their exchange, so they’d instead rutted furiously against each other in the front hallway until they both came, their kisses a violent clash, clothing torn in the scuffle.
Draco stared at his own hand as he reached out to pluck the first Thistle, eyes widening at the sight of his elongated fingernails, and the webbing now spread between his long, pale fingers.
“And only I can pick it, as the person wishing to use the Mermaid Thistle in a potion must have harvested it themselves. The Thistle will prick the hand that touches it, effectively locking onto their magical signature and rendering most of its magical properties inert to anyone else. Hence why I can’t just
He was enamoured with technology, though he hadn’t the first clue how to use it. Draco found himself often sitting, enthralled, in front of the television in their living room, or watching in amazement as someone had a conversation on a phone, or giddily getting into a cab with some friends to get around the city.
Malfoy looked amused by the observation, and moved to sit back down in his previously abandoned seat.
“Right, of course.” Draco said sarcastically. “Always human during the daytime. So you’ll be a mermaid again tonight, I expect.”
“What are your intentions with my son?” Narcissa demanded, whirling on him as soon as the door was shut behind them. Harry could see so much of Draco in her; her fire, her conviction. He hoped their children had this spark in them.
Draco had just opened his mouth to retort when Harry pulled out his wand, gathered Draco close, and apparated them both.
inside of him, and he felt himself light up with pleasure, that spot inside of him eager for that hot liquid, twitching further open to take Harry
“You look - “ Hermione’s eyes flicked from Draco’s stomach to peer at Harry, her gaze as sharp and discerning as ever. “Oh
.” Draco cried, his head tossing back and forth against the nest, his hair a mess of silvery swirls in the water around his face. “I
It takes a few days, but Hermione (and Percy Weasley of all people, who is a Goblin Liaison at the Ministry) manages to work with Gringotts to get into the Potter Vault and search for the wedding ring.
well, though he had apparently had a hard go of it over the last 6 years. Nearly every Wizarding paper in Europe had followed the Saviour’s steps since the War, meaning that Draco had been basically invited to continue his obsession with his former classmate.
and I have known each other for quite a while.” Harry conceded begrudgingly, but realizing how stupid it would be to deny it. “Though I never expected to run into him somewhere like this. I always thought you were too
Harry Potter was desperate to get his mouth on the cock of Draco Malfoy - the bane of his career at Hogwarts,
The plug that Harry had left in there had been dissolving, oh so slowly, until Harry had been sure that it was close to disappearing entirely, the jelly having degraded. Now there was only a thin film left keeping Harry’s clutch locked inside of his mate.
“Oh, I’m positively gagging for it, Malfoy. I can’t wait to get my mouth all over you. I’m going to suck your sweet little cock until you burst in my mouth, and then I’m going to eat that gorgeous arse until you’re begging me to fuck you, and then I’ll keep eating you.”
He had spent a whole year learning all about Muggle advancement in science and culture; learning about their rich history, and their staggering accomplishments, particularly in recent decades. Draco now truly understood just how
“I’ll definitely be needing a massage.” Draco groaned, leaning against the wall as Potter began soaping up his arse, fingers slipping eagerly between his cheeks, petting his still-sore hole. “And you’ll need to set up a time to meet with Pansy and Blaise later this week. I don’t trust your taste at all when it comes to rings, and I’m sorry to say it, but Granger is not much better. I can’t
His shirt was nearly as much a mess as the rest of his clothing; a Black Sabbath band tee that was so washed out that the logo was almost more of an impression, and there was a large hole at the bottom of it, so large that Draco could get a flash of Potter’s lean stomach, and the hint of his treasure trail as it disappeared into his jeans.
Draco keened, and Harry’s eyes went wide with awe as his mate’s body tensed, the rim of his cunt flexing open, the domed ridge of the egg squeezing out at the push.
Harry looked bemused, and then his eyes flicked down, likely fixing on the spot where Draco could feel a dull throb along the base of his neck.
“Draco, baby, please. You’ve been so good for me.” Harry murmured, stroking over his shivering flanks. “Tell me your colour.”
Harry patiently waited him out, eager to hear what Malfoy wanted - what was making him blush so furiously.
“You look like a good bit o’rough.” Beckett noted. “I’ve no doubt that the princess I found will be right taken with ya’. Seems to like them tall, dark, and handsome.”
Draco had landed in the quaint town of Marseillan via portkey the previous day, and after he had set up his things in the villa, he had wandered through town the day before to pick up some supplies (truly crucial ones, such as a very, very nice wine, a good wheel of brie, and an absolutely monstrous selection of fresh pastries and bread), and he had, of course, treated himself to a truly fantastic dinner of fresh seafood.
Draco was about to make a comment about Potter’s various worshipping fans, but the door suddenly opened, admitting a no-nonsense looking older witch, who immediately fixed Harry with a withering glare.
Harry was trying to pull himself together enough to aim a watery smile at the woman who had basically become his mum, who he had almost
“Afraid I couldn’t mention in my letters, Neville, but I must ask that you keep this a secret.” Draco said, face a bit pinched. “I trust you can?”
Draco arched and keened as the clasper slid into him, the long, thin appendage wrapping in a looping curl around the egg just inside, oozing out slick along its whole length, but getting a tight hold on the round shell.
‘Or perhaps you’d rather use that big cock of yours to finally shut me up?” The corners of Malfoy’s lips curled up in a devious grin. “Imagine how many of our encounters in school could have been resolved if I’d had something else to keep my mouth busy?”
They made quite good time washing each other, and Draco was happy enough with Harry’s work that he let Harry rut between his thighs, Harry’s hand wrapped around to slip between Draco’s legs, working over his clit until Draco came so hard he could barely keep standing as Harry worked himself to completion between his slick thighs.
The skin of Draco’s stomach was tight and stretched with the weight of the eggs inside of him, his pale-pink cock tucked up against it, hard and twitching, the slit of it bubbling with the slick that Harry’s clasper had just pumped inside.
” Neville looked torn between disbelieving and amused. “The gillyweed - I warned you about the side effects -”
”Look, Draco - there is a reason we, Ron and I, have worked so hard to keep Harry... secret.” She explained, looking at Draco beseechingly. “The curse - it’s effects on him impact almost everything about his life, and how he can live now. He can’t leave.”
It felt tight, encompassing, like it was holding him together, and holding him subject to Potter. It was heady.
Draco was even more enamoured with Muggle fashion, however. He spent countless hours in the fashion district, and spent countless euros on a sprawling wardrobe. Tailored suits and form fitting dresses, frock coats and cashmere jumpers, leather brogues and stiletto heels, high end makeup and personalized cologne.
“It looks to me like you’re just trying to stretch your sweet little hole open and get the egg to rub against your prostate, baby.” Harry observed, watching as Draco pushed again, the width of the egg pushing Draco’s hole just wide enough to
He hissed, his legs and abdomen flexing in waves as Potter’s hot tongue lapped at him, swirling and tracing over the tight furl of his opening. “
“You’re mine. My mate. No one else can touch you.” Harry explained, feeling frustrated. “And this is my territory. I can keep you safe here. You can’t leave.”
tell me about this curse, now that I’m officially caught up in it?” Draco asked, tone deeply annoyed.
Yet still, he had been highly unsure of his welcome back at home, where the memories of his family’s actions in the War were still fresh.
He knew Ron was mated to Hermione, and that they had a child of their own, but that only just managed to calm him.
Instead, he’d been forced to sit in his constricting Auror robes in various squashed, windowless meeting rooms full of Ministry employees.
“I’d like a partner that can finally last long enough to satisfy me. And one who can compete with some of the toys that I own in terms of size.”
He almost hexed the man’s arms off of his body as the bastard immediately rushed towards his mate, pulling Draco into a tight hug right in front of the restaurant where they had planned to meet.
Draco pursed his lips, crossing his arms and tapping his wand against his bicep as he glared up at the full moon, suddenly feeling a sense of unease about the venture for the first time.
With an annoyed motion, Harry waved his hand, and that addictively pleasant tingling feel of his potent magic washed through Draco, making his sore cock twitch, and his arse flutter.
“These are mine.” The dark haired man rumbled, the pressure of his hands growing as his fingers dug into the skin, making the scars whiten further, stark against his already pale skin.
.” Harry crooned, bringing his hands up to cup around the meat of Draco’s thighs where they met the swells of his arse.
Harry looked around his home as Ron and Hermione left after dinner, the sun blazing red behind the cloudy night sky.
When he sat down beside Pansy, she gave him a simpering smile and Blaise merely nodded his acknowledgment before returning his attention to his essay.
Ron seemed stunned by this, but for a long minute he didn’t say anything. Then: “How do you know that?”
Harry chased his mouth when he pulled away and Draco breathed out a laugh, holding him at bay with a hand on his chest.
you. Not just now,” he added quickly, “but, I mean, since the beginning of the year, even. I could say something if you want. You know, to McGonagall, ask her to enforce a —”
Draco looks over at Hermione, whom he'd momentarily forgotten was present. She looks extremely uncomfortable and he even manages to feel bad she's been caught in the middle of this. He's at war with himself, part of him desperately wishing he could Apparate away from this situation even as another part of him wants nothing more than to go out there and fight with Harry, because at least it'll be
the point. To be so deluded you let yourself pretend like you’re flying, not falling, until reality catches up and it’s over and you die.”
It was not a corporeal Patronus, but it was definitely more than a wisp of smoke — a bright flash of light erupted from the end of his wand, filling the small room briefly before disappearing again. Chest heaving, eyes round with shock, he looked over at Harry, who couldn’t help smiling.
Potter grabbed his bag and Draco lifted his own over his shoulder, annoyed with himself for wondering already the next time they’d see each other, and if he’d have to wait until Wednesday.
Draco studies him for a few moments and Harry burns with curiosity over what he’s thinking. Then he says, “Okay,” and he turns around.
It was stupid and reckless and arrogant and surreal and faultlessly brave. And so Draco hadn’t forgotten that.
"You look terrible, Draco," he says. Draco laughs, harsh and bitter. He leans back against the wall and crosses his arms, letting his eyes stray elsewhere.
to have a plan," he said, looking at Harry again only briefly. Harry's stomach clenched with pity. "Now I ... I have to make a new one, I suppose." He pushed himself up to a sitting position, the blanket pooling in his lap. His ribs stood out through his skin, making it look paper-thin. "I'm scared," he said baldly. Harry, taken aback, sat up as well. "It won't be easy getting a job with my name. With ..." He held up his left arm.
“Get out of my way,” Harry said, and his tone brooked no argument. He had eyes only for Kenny, who appeared both shocked and a little bit fearful.
“So was this some sort of rebellious act, then?” Malfoy asked. There was something unreadable in his eyes when he said it. “Bringing me back to your flat and fucking me?”
Draco kept his hands securely around him and a soft smile came over his face when Teddy put a thumb in his mouth and rested his head against Draco's shoulder.
“I don’t think anyone ever really gave you a chance,” says Potter simply. Draco stares at him, and he shivers, and he feels more goosebumps make all the skin on his arms feel tight. When he can’t take it anymore, he looks away.
Draco’s eyebrows drew together. “What about you?” he asked, and it was hardly more than a whisper of breath.
“I can play all right,” he said vaguely, and took a swig of his drink. It did make some sort of sense, now Draco thought about it – the tips of Harry’s fingers were far,
He thought for a second Draco wouldn’t do it, but then he did. He lowered himself to the hard, tiled classroom floor and parted his legs when Harry crawled between them on his knees. He wanted to see his face, that was the thing — he wanted to watch, wanted to
“I’m just really bloody happy is all.” He kissed the corner of Draco’s mouth, weakening his knees and sending his heart into a frenzy. “And I know you’re gonna look so fucking good when you start showing.” His nails scraped delicately across Draco’s skin, something unfathomably deep sparkling in his eyes. “Tell me you love me again. Tell me you want this baby with me.”
He met Harry's gaze, and it didn't matter that he didn't say thank you. His eyes said it well enough.
Now, seeing Potter up in the air, completely unaware he was being watched, Draco realized something was happening again. Potter had always looked at home on a broomstick, yet there was something enticing about the way his new muscles looked as they shifted beneath the skin every time he moved. Something about the way his stupid, messy hair looked when it was blown back by the wind.
Any reservations Harry might've had were rendered insignificant in the face of Draco's panic; he started up his rhythm again, battering his prostate while Draco jerked and gasped and kept squeezing his cock. Harry, at the very end of his own self-control, knew it was a matter of seconds now before he tipped over that edge himself. Another shudder wracked Draco's body, his mouth open and eyes closed, like an afterthought of his last orgasm had just caught up to him even though nothing came out. Harry finally spilled over, fucking his orgasm into Draco's trembling form, his sweaty hands slipping on Draco's waist.
the other day? Nott’s dad was sentenced to the Kiss. Bet you anything Malfoy’s thinking about dear old Lucius’s narrow escape.”
“Maybe you should work on that then.” His voice sounded unsteady, and he could feel Harry grinning against him between sucking kisses. They trailed leisurely down to his tits, where he used one hand to squeeze the right one and scraped his teeth over a hardened nipple. “Shit … Potter, it’s
“I think I haven’t seen you looking this happy in a very long time, and that’s enough proof for me. Is it, er — I mean, do you want to talk about … you know, your attraction to the idea of Malfoy as a male again? How are you feeling about that?”
Draco moans. He squeezes around Potter's cock filling him up so thoroughly, helpless not to meet that burning gaze.
"Not as well as we thought, clearly," says Draco bitterly. He thinks this must be it, the proof they needed that it was stupid to have even tried. To keep pretending they can make this work when
“I don’t need you to be proud of me, Potter,” he said, and then spit the toothpaste out into the sink. He met Harry’s eyes through the mirror. “I did it because your golden friends are beginning to bore me. Pansy’s served her time.”
“I’m wearing socks!” Harry argues, still grinning. He can’t remember how many times they’ve had this fight -- during a time when Draco had been over at his flat more often than not, he’d taken to berating Harry for being apparently unable to keep his feet off of surfaces that weren’t made for them.
“I don’t hate you, Malfoy.” Feeling suddenly sick to his stomach, Draco dropped his eyes to the stone floor of the tower. He could still feel Potter’s burning gaze on him. “I saved you because you didn’t deserve to die. I kept you out of Azkaban because you didn’t deserve that either, and I kept your mother out because she helped me when I was in that forest.” Heart in his throat, Draco looked up again in astonishment. He hadn’t heard that story. His mother's trial had been highly confidential. “I know how much your father means to you. But Lucius … Azkaban is exactly what he deserves.”
Draco, pressing his lips together to stifle every sound that was trying to wrench itself right out of his gut every time Potter’s fingers pressed up a little harder, merely shook his head.
“All right.” He gave her a wan smile, his body feeling suddenly rubbery and his muscles loose. There was a horrible, aching sadness in his gut that had everything to do with his father, but more than anything else at the moment he felt utterly exhausted with relief. His mother knew now — that was over. And more than that, she knew about
Harry moves his fingers in a slow rhythm, pressing in deep on every inward stroke, his other hand a steadying weight on Draco's hip, their mouths sliding wetly and purposefully together. Harry's tongue tastes like whisky, as if he'd taken a shot or two before coming here, and to know that Harry — strong, resilient, bullheaded, outrageously brave — had needed that liquid help to be able to do this makes him a little more human.
"Hey," Harry said, and smiled when Draco jumped so badly the book fell to the floor. He was up out of the chair instantly and at Harry's side, looking like he wanted to touch but was afraid to do so. "How long have I been out?"
"You're right," she said again. There were tears misting up her eyes now. "I'm sorry, Draco. I should have talked to you about it. I was confused, I didn't know how to approach you, I just —"
And then something insane occurred to him, and he looked at Malfoy with a sense of dawning wonder and incredulity.
"The game," Draco reminds himself, blinking owlishly. He's still a bit dazed, not to mention turned on and desperate for more of Harry's attention. Ravenous, even. Harry may have been having sex, but Draco hadn't.
He groans in frustration when Draco pulls off again but then he’s sliding Harry’s cock back into his arse, and not just the head this time. He sinks all the way down, enveloping Harry in all that throbbing, gorgeous heat, and he squeezes so perfectly around him, and Harry cries out and lifts his hips and tries to fight his restraints.
, of course; all anyone had to do was walk in front of the desk and they’d see his legs spread wide right through Harry’s invisible back. Just as bad, should they walk
He did indeed look uncomfortable, rather like a wild animal who'd been cornered. Harry couldn't tell whether that had more to do with the simple fact of being addressed up here in the common room where he was usually ignored, or if it was fear owing to Goyle's temporary absence. He surely couldn't have thought Hermione would try to harm him in any way, although in all fairness she
“Stay still,” he breathed, his tone toeing the line of request and demand, but Draco had never been so happy to oblige Potter before. He kept his throat open and let Potter cradle the back of his head, his hips starting off slow as he pushed his cock into Draco's mouth and pulled it back out again, a filthy mockery of what Draco would have given anything for Potter to be doing to his arse.
Draco’s eyebrows came together, confused. The past two days had been a blur. Having been the weekend, Draco had spent most of the time in his room, buried under his covers, hidden away from the world and all its terrible truths. He hadn’t even known Potter had been gone. Nor did he care.
“You stay the fuck away from Draco,” Harry growled, pointing his wand at Theo again. “And if I ever hear you talking about Ginny again, I’ll knock your goddamn teeth out, Nott.”
He hops down himself and grabs his pack of cigarettes, something that's becoming dangerously habitual. He can hear their voices as he heads to his bedroom and stops to listen, hidden by a wall.
Draco scoffs. He takes Potter’s wrists and pins them above his head, and suddenly Potter’s laughing and Draco is completely mesmerised by the way his Adam’s apple moves in his throat.
Tongue in his cheek, Harry let his hand drift under the shirt entirely, the calloused pads of his fingers scratching lightly across Malfoy’s smooth stomach, loving the way he could feel the skin twitching beneath his touch. Malfoy appeared to be as ambivalent as he was turned on, the evidence of which could be seen in the way his pupils had begun dilating the closer Harry got to his bra. With their eyes locked, Harry moved his hand to cup one small breast, feeling a hard nipple underneath the thin material poking into his palm. Malfoy started to let out a breathy moan but it was muffled by Harry’s mouth. Harry, for his part, was already half-hard inside his denims.
"Come on, Malfoy," he said, voice lowered. Those unfeeling grey eyes gave up no emotion where they rested on Harry. For just a second he could feel the cold floor of Malfoy Manor on his knees again, could smell the potent blend of fear and hatred and insanity coming off the Death Eaters all around him, especially Malfoy, who for that moment had held Harry's life in his hands. "Call him off, I wanna talk to you."
They wanted what Kenny Helstrom had wanted. To hurt him, especially now that he was in this much smaller, more helpless body.
Ron's face had sobered. Hermione was gazing down at her hands in her lap, and Harry thought it was probable she was fighting back tears. Not just for Luna, but for the things they themselves had endured in that manor.
Goyle looked at Draco, who Harry realised was wearing a strange, unreadable expression. It didn't matter what any of them said — Draco's word was the final one as far as Gregory Goyle was concerned. And Draco knew that.
Granger appeared to think for a moment, and when she finally spoke, it was with a clear tentativeness in her voice.
!” Draco squeaked again, hands going to the edge of the table and gripping hard when he felt that wild hair brushing the insides of his thighs ... and a second after that, the damp heat of breath ghosting across his knickers. “Harry, seriously, you need to get
"You've been unfocused," says Mr Pratchett, casual, like he's just making an observation. He glances at Draco from over the top of his square spectacles, grins, and then looks back down at the order form he's going over. "Anything you'd like to talk about?"
“That’s fine. I just wanna say something, though. And then we can drop it. We can drop the whole conversation. I didn’t mean for this to turn into a rehash of the past.”
“What?” Harry said stupidly, shaking his head like he was trying to clear it. His heart was no longer frozen but racing now, racing like it had been
Potter. It was an instinctively disturbing thought, until he reminded himself, over and over again, where this surge of lust was coming from. Namely, the fact that the one orgasm Draco had experienced within the last three months had been Potter’s doing, and that had been close to three weeks ago. Furthermore, Potter was always
The only time Malfoy could be found without Goyle, Harry had discovered, was in Potions and immediately after. Goyle actually walked Malfoy to classes they didn't have together, but because of whichever lesson he had at the same time he was usually not there yet right when they got out. The next day, Harry used this to his advantage.
“We should go.” Draco bent and picked up the broom from the stone floor, feeling the weight of it, the texture of it, before handing it to Potter. “I … thank you for bringing me down here. It's ... my house's history."
“Draco,” Harry’s voice broke him out of his thoughts. Draco found his eyes and then looked down, heart climbing into this throat when he caught sight of Harry’s thick, straining cock, bobbing in midair with a bead of pre-come leaking out of the slit. The head was an angry red, and for all the sarcasm that had been in Draco’s voice when he’d ribbed Harry about thinking himself too big, Draco was reminded now that the size of his cock was, indeed, quite impressive. Nothing impossible, of course, but … really rather large. His hole clenched in anticipation of the stretch. “Tell me one more time. Tell me you’re sure.”
attracted to you when you change back, but it's not the body I'm in love with, Draco. It's you. I don't know how else to explain that to you." Draco couldn't find his words suddenly and he stayed quiet, looking back and forth between Harry's eyes for something, he didn't know what. Harry went on, "Someone could take your brain out of your head and put it in a jar, Draco, and as long as you could talk I would
"Oh ... good. Well. Erm — yeah, I ... I got you a ring. I wasn't ... you know, I wasn't planning on asking you
For having chucked a glass candle-holder across his flat that morning, he was remarkably pleased to be seeing Malfoy now. And perhaps he
“I kissed him,” he nodded, and although he felt his cheeks blooming with heat, he didn’t let himself look away. He might have been nervous about Hermione’s reaction to this, but he was
He pulled back, stomach rolling anxiously. Over his shoulder, he saw that the Auror, Dawlish, was tucked in a corner across the room where he couldn’t overhear them, looking politely away.
One thing, however, which was becoming increasingly unavoidable, was the size of his tits. He was wearing a bra he’d ordered only a few weeks after first being hit with the hex, and not only had he been forced to adjust its tightness, but his tits themselves were starting to spill out of the cups.
"You realise," said Draco slowly, "that living together is hugely different than sharing a common room."
jumpy today. I think the lack of Quidditch is catching up to you finally — you always had a way of letting out energy when you had practise.”
Theo looked ready to lunge, so Draco grabbed the Cloak from the floor and pulled Harry back out of the common room, tugging it over them before Theo could come out and follow. He could both feel and hear Harry’s angry, panting breaths as they ascended into the entrance hall, but before they could climb the marble staircase, two people came out of the Great Hall and one of them gasped.
Potter’s eyebrows drew together. “Of course it isn’t,” he said a tad sharply. The metaphysical distance between the two of them — a distance they’d so recently begun to bridge — was momentarily thrown into sharp relief. Dark and Light. Good and Evil. Everything Potter stood for versus everything Draco had been coerced into
want to ask you, though …” She trailed off, a decidedly coy smile growing on her face. “Ron said you weren’t in Divination yesterday.”
For now, he presses a delicate kiss just above it on the side of Draco’s neck and feels him shiver. The dangling spider earring caresses his cheek with its tiny metallic legs.
"I'm not fighting with you anymore," says Harry, pulling back. His arms are still around Draco, hands pressed into the dip of his back, keeping them close. "Not over stupid shit like this, at least. I mean, I know we're bound to fight, but ... not like this, not anymore. I'm sorry too, I get caught up."
was the wrong pronoun, that was the first problem — despite the short hair that resembled Draco Malfoy’s identically, and despite the pointy features and grey eyes and the ghost of a familiar sneer on a mouth whose lips were just a little bit fuller than Harry remembered Malfoy’s being, it simply
Harry pulled out slowly and then rammed back inside, wrenching a gut-twistingly erotic gasp out of the slim blond beneath him.
“Right, well … you can get more pads from Madam Pomfrey. The potion, as well. I don’t know what’s going on with you and Pansy, but if you have any more questions, let me know.”
"Yeah," Draco agreed. "She is. Or ... she will be, at least. I'm just processing, I s'pose. That's all." He went over to Harry and kissed him, then ran a few fingers through Teddy's hair. "It's because of you she wasn't in there longer. She knows that. She'll thank you, when she's ready."
Draco held his gaze a moment, and finally, with a terse nod of acquiescence, turned on his heel and set off for Transfiguration with Theo behind him, keeping a distance.
"Well everything else is the same anyway," said Ron with a shake of his head. "Exactly the pointy ferret I remember."
And then, quite unexpectedly, the tip of Potter’s tongue probed gently at Draco’s hole, and Draco’s head fell back, a guttural moan coming out of his mouth unbidden. There was a part of him which was terrified of acknowledging that small, secret place inside his body that not even he had explored, but that hesitance and anxiety was overpowered so thoroughly by this awakened hunger inside of himself that all he could do was give into Potter’s ministrations, to the hands gripping his thighs, to the unbearable pleasure reaching from the roots of his hair to the tips of his toes. He was hyperaware of the way his breasts moved with each shallow breath, even more aware of the way his nipples had become sensitive, and he could feel them rubbing against the inside of his bra.
. And I don’t just mean when you dressed up like a bloody Dementor to try and get me to fall off my broom.”
,” he whined, practically shivering in Harry’s lap when that hot mouth switched to his other breast and began to work on the nipple, leaving the first one wet and stiff and sensitive.
Sweating, panting, half-delirious, Harry gripped Draco’s thigh, shifted his angle, and let go of the last of his resolve. Draco cried out and clenched around him, nails digging into his back, and it took five hard thrusts for Harry to tilt himself over the edge. The orgasm washed over him like a warm, tingling wave, tensing his muscles and then turning them to liquid as he spilled endlessly inside Draco’s arse. Draco squeezed his hand and came only seconds later, turning his face away and straining under Harry’s body. Harry forced his useless muscles to move so he could grip Draco’s chin and turn his head and kiss him again, sloppy and wet and uncomfortably poignant.
“A big step,” Ron said rather croakily, speaking for the first time in a while. Harry nodded, smiling a little. It felt good —
"Probably, yeah," said Harry, meeting Ron's sarcastic tone with a completely serious one. And, echoing Narcissa's sentiment, "I guess I'm gonna have a lot of time to get to know her. More than enough to start trying to piece together why she did the things she did, and to be able to tell if she really is sorry. I've been thinking a lot about Luna," he admitted, "how much time she spent in that dungeon. How anyone else —
It was Wednesday night before they had a chance to spend any real time together again, and by then, Harry felt quite as though he would go mad.
“Lift your leg,” Harry said, tapping his thigh, and with a tiny whimper Draco did as he was asked, bracing his knee on the desk next to his arm, spread out so obscenely for Harry in his own Hogwarts office that his cheeks stung with the delicious humiliation of it.
That it was Malfoy factored into it in a way Harry felt incapable of understanding at the moment. He was too tired, too empty, too starved for touch and for mindless release to bother deciphering his emotions.
love him, that's not the problem. Even after their short talk earlier and that rather emotional sex, he still feels scared to say it, to mend the bridge and give himself over to the unknown, follow his heart instead of his head for once in his life.
one,” Draco said through a beautiful, teasing grin. “Just trust me, all right? I’m really quite intelligent, if you hadn’t noticed. With my brains and your penchant for surviving impossible odds, we’ll be fine. You know … in the end. And your parents?” He nodded towards the large headstone, where Lily’s and James’s names glittered prettily in the afternoon sunlight. “Wherever they are, whatever sort of afterlife they’re in, if there’s any at all — they’re proud of you, Harry.”
Malfoy’s jaw hung open and there was a suspicious look in his eyes that couldn’t entirely hide the burgeoning hopefulness Harry saw underneath. It made him feel warm all over and he had to use a massive amount of willpower to stop from kissing him again.
“Will you lock the door?” he said, breaking the silence. He wasn’t sure what to expect, but after a moment Harry grinned, waved a hand at the door, and Draco heard it lock. He sat up, and before he could ask Harry had taken out his wand this time and made Draco’s clothes reappear. “Harry,” he said, shifting a little, meeting his eyes with some difficulty, “I’m sorry for being a brat. For ignoring you all week. I didn’t — I’d never want you to feel like … like you have to worry about losing me. I really am utterly yours. You know that.”
Draco only shrugs. His stomach is in knots and all he wants to do is go home and light a cigarette and cry.
gently, and he felt Malfoy start panting and squirming beneath him. And then he said it again, his name, but this time it was louder and less controlled, as if he hadn't even meant to do it. "
delivered when Ron and Hermione showed up, sitting on either side of him. It amused him that they still did this from time to time, nor did it appear to be conscious on their part.
Harry — sweat starting to drip down his temples and his back — wrapped his hand around Draco's straining cock. Draco arched again and made a broken noise. Harry stroked him with quick movements, pulling him relentlessly into another orgasm that shook his body. He only took his hand off when he felt Draco go boneless beneath him, but Draco's hand replaced it almost immediately. He kept stroking himself, twitching with overstimulation and milking out a few more dribbles of come. The sight of it sent Harry into a frenzy — he pressed down on Draco's legs and fucked into him with his control abandoned, and he didn't even need Draco whispering "Come in me" to push him over the edge, nor to do so — the idea of pulling out didn't even occur to him. He came spectacularly, spilling himself into Draco's body with stuttering hips and his fingers making bruises in Draco's skin.
Harry’s eyes widened and the colour in his cheeks returned. He saw Malfoy smile at this reaction, but the smile disappeared as quickly as it had come.
There's a knock on the door, and Draco had been so lost in Harry that the sharp sound makes him jump, heart kicking into overdrive.
It never makes him feel anything but hollow. He tells himself he only needs to try harder. Dig deeper. Gouge himself of his sins.
Malfoy looked up at him through slitted eyes, like he was contemplating the legitimacy of everything Harry had just said.
Maybe something so pure, so inherently good, was not meant to be produced by someone who was so tainted by evil.
“I get why you won’t take my word for it,” he said quietly, “or Harry’s, for that matter. You’re right, I mean, you don’t know until you
“Where the fuck did you even come from!” Theo demanded loudly, clutching at his neck as though Harry had strangled him. “Get the hell out of our common room, Potter, you bloody maniac!”
. Draco tried to hit him, but his wrist was caught in a tight grip before he’d moved it more than a couple inches.
“I’m in the middle of something,” Draco drawled without looking up from his notes. “And unless I dreamt it, I thought I told you to bugger off just a few hours ago.”
to be made out of me and Malfoy snogging, believe me. I don't need sense, I just need help figuring out what to do so nobody gets hurt."
between his legs. His heart launched itself up into his throat and he shifted subtly in his chair, panicking when he felt what he knew instinctively and without a doubt to be blood.
Harry sat up on his knees, aware of the way Malfoy lifted himself onto his elbows to watch as Harry pulled his shirt off over his head. Those grey eyes were everywhere, he could practically feel them on his skin like a physical touch, and it made his blood boil with desire. When he’d thrown it off the bed, he carefully helped Malfoy out of his own shirt. His eyes raked over Malfoy’s exposed chest in the dim lighting, wishing more than anything that sodding bra wasn’t in the way.
“I’m cold, Potter!” he said as he was dragged to Harry’s bedroom. Harry pulled a jumper out of his dresser and tossed it to him. “What is this?” Malfoy asked, and Harry looked over his shoulder to see him sneering at the Nirvana logo on the front.
The knock on his door throws Draco off his counting and he drops the bitter root petal onto the table with a frustrated sigh. Fucking Pansy. He's planning the names he'll call her when he opens the door and sees not Pansy but a soaking wet Harry Potter standing there. He stares at him speechlessly a moment and then begins furiously repressing everything he's feeling.
Draco stayed where he'd been standing for several minutes after Potter left, some part of him certain that nosy, idiot Gryffindor would come stumbling back in with another proposition, another made-up excuse to stick around just so he could ogle Draco's misfortune.
"No," Draco shook his head. He smiled a little. "I probably would have kicked you out, to be honest."
“Just twenty minutes ago,” Draco told her quietly. He had allowed Harry to tell them about the letter. Truthfully, he had dug around inside himself and found not one iota of loathing for either Granger
“Do you know, Potter,” he said softly, smiling at the eye-roll he received for the use of Harry’s last name, “I think you might be the best thing that could have happened to me in all of this.”
"Please, Draco," Harry said weakly. He was glad Harry's face was still in his neck, because he didn't think he could bear to see whatever expression was there.
His mother reached out and pinched his chin, her smile one of great fondness. “I’ll look forward to an owl. Goodbye, then, darling. The school house-elves will deliver your clothes, look for them tonight.”
Draco's heart swells. He rolls his eyes because he doesn't want Potter to see the emotion on his face, but he's pretty sure he sees it anyway.
"Did you even hear what you just said?" Harry bites out. Draco feels his jaw clench. "It's the first time he's played this season. I'd be jittery too, maybe Buckley ought to let him have a go more often."
"Well," she says with some finality, "I'm seeing Blaise and Theo for dinner tomorrow, let me know if you have any interest in joining us, I s'pose."
Draco whipped his head around and Harry laughed, glad to see it had worked so well as a topic-shifter.
“Potter, you’re a cretin,” Malfoy snipped, turning his face away and staring up at the ceiling, as though
“You think that’s funny, do you, Malfoy?” And then Potter was standing up, and Draco felt panic begin clawing at his brain. Without giving himself time to overthink it, he got up from the bench as well and grabbed the sleeve of Potter’s jumper. Potter turned, but where Draco had gotten so used to seeing an annoyingly charming grin was now a cold, unamused line.
It’s a transfigured step in an arbitrary staircase that first time. Draco, watching discreetly from the landing above, anticipating the satisfaction of watching the idiot put his foot through what appears to be a regular step but is actually wet cement, frowns when Potter does a clear double-take and pauses two steps down from it. Impossibly, he takes out his wand, mutters something, and Draco’s eyes go wide as he watches his own handiwork expose itself. Potter then says something to Weasley that Draco can’t hear, skips the step, and continues on his way up.
Harry shook his head. His expression was difficult to read, brow creased like he was thinking hard while he studied Draco’s face. “I thought
As soon as the door closed, Potter pulled off his Cloak, sporting a grin that was far too smug to be allowed.
"Nothing bad is gonna happen, Draco," said Harry, and Draco broke out of his daze to look at him, his earnest face and kind eyes.
“Are you?” Potter pressed. His voice had dropped to a lower register, and when his hands landed on Draco’s waist, his pulse jumped. He let Potter back him up to the wall and went into a kiss willingly, his fingers hesitant where they skimmed along Potter’s stubbled jaw. Potter was far more certain in his movements, his grip firm on Draco’s hips, eyes blazing when he pulled away, leaving Draco winded. “Tell me …” he breathed, and began mouthing his way back to Draco’s ear, “are you wet right now?”
