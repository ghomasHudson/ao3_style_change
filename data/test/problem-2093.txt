"Yes." She pursed her lips. "The head elf has reported that there's to be one extra Gryffindor for lunch and dinner today. Do you have any idea what that is about?"
His sister joined him soon after. “Atara!!”
“I tried to wake him…” Draco whined. “I’m just too impatient. I want to know.”
Harry nodded with great satisfaction to silently confirm Ernie’s realization. “Whether it happened to my cousin or someone else, it was a terrible thing to do.”
Harry nodded. “Just don’t wake him, please. In fact if you’d like to take a nap with him, that’s fine. I haven’t forgotten that you’re pregnant too.”
“Really?” Draco asked softly.
“The members of the Wizengamot have no interest in destroying good relationships. They are offering these consultations as an evaluation of the damage done by the law they’d created nearly three years ago.” Starla explained. “I’ve been assured by the minister that my recommendations will be taken into account in all cases and negative reports will be investigated further.”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief along with Harry upon seeing that the castle wasn't completely destroyed. As the young lord took stock of the castle, Draco did as well.
Luna gave birth to Lawrence Raymond Zabini – or her little Moonbeam – exactly one month following the birth of Harry and Draco’s twins. She claimed that her mother was in the birthing room with her, dressed in white with white feathery wings fluttering in a breeze. When asked, Blaise simply said, “She’s just as sane as we are, Draco.” Having heard this conversation between his husband and their friend, Harry had been shocked speechless.
Harry looked at Dudley and began to laugh because his cousin’s expression was one of absolute bewilderment.
"Oh, no. I- I'm not married." Draco snorted lightly. "Not for a while. Divorced."
When Harry landed, Draco rushed over to fuss. He scooped the baby out of Harry’s harness and cuddled him close. “I can’t believe you were going so fast, Harry! He’s just a baby! He shouldn’t be on a broom yet!” He kissed the strawberry blond hair on his squirming son’s head and whispered unnecessarily soothing words.
The light kiss upon the leftover love bite brought a shiver down the blond’s spine and he whimpered in want.
Draco sighed and settled for placing his hand on Harry's arm. "Alright, Harry. Let's go to our suite."
Harry's laugh echoed through the house. "I'll have Ziva spread the collection out. I promise."
Narcissa's eyes lit up. "Perfect!"
Harry’s appetite almost spoiled when they mentioned snail slime and animal blood so he politely asked them to avoid shop talk at the table.
Sirius stared at him. "That's something to get a handle on then."
Soon Narcissa stood and walked over to her husband – it was the first real affection between them that Harry was witness to. Lucius’ arms went around her waist and the two of them held each other.
Altaira nodded. “In our time it had no true name until someone a year or so after my death gave it a scientific term that I cannot recall.”
Draco looked angelic as he lay there, on the white-cushioned chaise. His hair was fanned out and he had his hands on his belly, as if to protect the twins from anyone who might come barging in. A short note on the coffee table told him that Narcissa and Lucius had left a short while ago and that Draco seemed very tired.
“Well then let me brag for you. I’m very proud of the accomplishments you’ve made.” Harry grinned at the blond.
“Oh, kiddo!” He sighed softly. “I’m sorry. I went from thinking of you as a baby to thinking of you like a teenager! Like I was. You just let me know if you want to talk or if you need anything and one of us will help you out alright?”
Harry’s smirk widened and he winked at him as they passed through. “I think he’s missed you, Dray.”
Draco blushed and looked down. “I never thought to hear any of that from you, Harry...but then, I never thought I’d want to.”
"I'm still getting used to life without a psycho trying to kill me." Harry confessed. "I've barely even registered being gay and suddenly I'm in a relationship - not just any relationship but one with you."
He talked about how he’d felt to see Sirius at the end of his fourth year after coming back from the graveyard incident and then with a sad smile he recounted the day that he’d been taken to Grimmauld Place and how Molly and Sirius had almost gone to blows over him. With tears in his eyes, Harry confessed that he still couldn’t believe that he’d forgotten the mirror Sirius had given him on his way to school before fifth year. If he’d only remembered it Sirius might still be here!
The whole scene confused Andromeda as she watched. This was not the way she’d imagined the Malfoys would treat young Harry. She’d thought the meal would be riddled with tension and hostility. Instead, there was mischief and playfulness. She began to relax until Lucius, once again, took to his feet.
Harry’s teeth instantly became set on edge. As if the ring didn’t already lay a claim to the blond, Viktor had to speak the words? “Yes. I’ve already gotten the day off. I’m looking forward to it.”
“Narcissa, if you wouldn’t mind calling the healer so she can tell us which potions he needs to brew.” Harry suggested softly while banishing the contents of the basin.
"I'm sorry I left you behind." Harry told her. "It wasn't planned and I have your cage. We have many properties for you to explore now. This perch is yours too, Hedwig, and I'll put one in every bedroom I stay in. I promise!"
Harry looked divine in his new black dress robes as he came in and took his place in the opposite vestibule. The shirt he wore under the robes was white and his tie was emerald green.
"Well, not quite." Sirius chuckled. "The names had to come from somewhere..."
"For Godric's sake, Padfoot!" Harry chuckled at the nickname. "Please don't call me that while we're there?"
He bit his lip. People had been hexed for it.  “I’m sorry, sweetie. I really am.”
"Some shopping to start with. My trunk is falling apart, so there's that." Harry paused to let Remus write that down. "I'll need a new wardrobe - because I can't be a lord and dress like a homeless person. Dudley needs one too because he's barely brought any of his own clothes, much less brought anything that would fit into our world."
"What?" Dudley wanted to know. "What's going on?"
Remus nodded. "Don't let him send you on a mission, Sirius. We have Harry to think about and our safety keeps him safe."
When they arrived, Harry noticed a large difference in the house he'd known as the Burrow. The ground floor of the house had been widened and the resulting structure appeared much more balanced.
Harry sighed and nodded. "After that shock, I tried to chase her through the hedge but lost sight of her when..."
Harry stared at Draco a moment longer before turning to face their guests. He swept his god daughter into his arms for a quick hug before placing the little one into the warded play area with the twins. “Draco says we haven’t gotten anything from the ministry. What’s your letter about?”
His face fell. "Uhmmm, no?"
Harry’s heart fell. “I’m so sorry you felt like that. I want you to know that I don’t think you’ve failed me in any way, Dragon.”
“Did he just call her…Pans?” Blaise turned to look at Draco.
“Well, they’re trying to get one over on you, Starla.” Draco said softly. “I can show you the letters I was sent about the law.”
“It was just this strange feeling I had and I wanted Mother to cast the pregnancy detection spell.” He reached over to hold his love’s hand. “I tried to wake you but became impatient.”
The morning of Draco's birthday dawned with a delightful surprise in the form of a fluttery movement in his belly which woke him from slumber. Without thinking, he shouted his husband's name as loudly as he could while placing one hand where his daughter had just made her presence known.
"So, she's going to be living here with us until the end of the year." Harry finished, waiting for the outrage and arguments to begin.
"She's going to sing?" Harry mused.
Harry's arrival caused much excitement in the Weasley household. The twins were the first to approach and Harry watched them come closer in horror as he realized he'd forgotten to speak with Korlag about the investment in the twins joke shop. "Mates, I'm so sorry! We were so busy with legal issues and I forgot to ask Korlag to draw something up for us!"
Harry thought for a moment. "Wiltshire, London, and Loch Ness."
Sirius and Remus joined them at the table and Harry told them about the founders' rooms and the things he'd found there. He filled them in on his plans for the new Founders Library and the plants from Hufflepuff's quarters. He even told them about the basilisk corpse that was well preserved enough to be harvested.
Harry smiled to let the blond know it was alright with him.
Harry looked into the shimmering silver eyes of his lover and began to pump the blond’s cock furiously. “I want to see you come... I want to see how I make you feel...Come for me.”
Draco’s come shot into his wife’s womb as Harry came onto his slave’s chest.
“Anyway…” Harry was interrupted by the whistle of the kettle so he stood and walked to the stove. He moved the kettle to a cold burner and hovered there.
"Do you have any port-keys?" Remus asked. "If not, may I make one?"
A pang of heartache hit the brunette as he realized how much he’d miss Teddy and the twins while they were away. “I suppose we can ask them to bring Teddy, Lyra and Caelum to visit a couple of times.”
Harry nodded. “Exactly. We were constantly told not to worry our pretty little heads and let the adults handle things.”
“Draco is asleep. We ate breakfast here because he wasn’t fit company for anyone this morning. Do you know why he was indisposed?” Harry asked quietly. “He woke up as an insufferable brat because he didn’t get enough sleep, Lucius. Why didn’t you support my suggestion, last night? The chess match would’ve been over seconds after I suggested that he go to sleep if you’d just made the move that would’ve given you the win. You wouldn’t have been seen as publicly supporting me and Draco would’ve gone to bed at a decent time, but you didn’t take it.”
The snake bit Harry's wrist and changed color with a sudden wave of magic. Instead of the brownish metal, he now appeared to be a bright and shiny silver.
When they'd left everyone's earshot, Draco whispered to the brunette. "You've a suite and an office?"
“Why does Pansy get to accompany you?” Draco pouted.
Harry grinned to himself. He loved getting his beautiful husband to make noises like that one. Seeing Draco lose control of his emotions was such a rush. Lifting his head once more, Harry placed Draco's hands on his nipples. "Tease them for me, Dragon. I'm a little busy." Then, he called for the jar of lube and opened it before coating one finger in the goo.
“Harry!” Draco cried. “I’m so sorry!”
She nodded as she pulled out the chain around her neck to display a small wand. "In Africa, Gunnora had witnessed Edith's reaction to holding a branch of zebrawood and sent samples back to be studied by Edith's other grandparents who were, of course, the wandmakers of the time while her father was still an apprentice. When they realized the potential, they gathered the supportive people who helped set up this school, while keeping her father in the dark due to his previous reluctance to accommodate Edith's needs."
Korlag picked it up. "Well, Mr. Dursley, you are indeed a squib of the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw line. As such, you're entitled to a small vault left in trust by your and Harry's great great grandmother. Harry, your mother never looked that deeply into her ancestry so she wasn't able to take possession of the significantly larger vault left in trust for a magical descendant. It therefore goes to you."
"How so?" Draco questioned.
The whole family seemed to sigh in relief before happily going back to their meals and soon enough the days went back into a somewhat simple routine.
“You’re welcome.” He grinned as Draco turned to him with a smile and tears shimmering in his silver eyes.
A genuine smile lit up Lucius’ face as he simply wiped the mess off with a napkin and looked at the small children arrayed around him. “No, I daresay they won’t.”
Harry bit his lip. "I kind of like that one, Dray…but I've been thinking of flower names too and I'm fond of Dahlia and Hyacinthe."
“Dinki is being needed?” She asked.
"Several bedrooms?" Harry asked in a low murmur. "Interesting..."
“I’ll open the Firewhiskey then.” Harry said wondering why whiskey sounded funny to him.
"He dances well – I don't know when he learned or who taught him, but you must've seen him dancing with me at the ball…" He spoke softly. "During the last few lust filled days and nights he's been so understanding and I don't want to be crass but we are quite intense in the bedroom."
Ron followed suit. "Old unusable weapons."
"It was determined that the potions and spells affected everything from his mental capacity to his growth and muscle formation. It even affected his eyesight and ability to absorb nutrients as well as information." Sirius cut in, staring at the potion master. "From what I've been told, he was kept far away from the magical world until his Hogwarts letter arrived."
“Hard to say really…” Harry huffed as he handed over the newspaper. “It could be my failure as a husband …or maybe my failure as a father…”
Harry frowned but waited to see what was going on.
Harry tried to hide a chuckle but was unsuccessful so Draco glared at him.
Next Draco gave him a book about wizarding traditions with marks on the pages that described the ones the Malfoys subscribed to.
"Harry?!" Ron exclaimed as he burst into the compartment.
“Well, maybe girls just know this instinctively but it really didn’t occur to me until now.” Harry bit his lip as he tried to explain.
Draco and Harry cleaned the children up and then brought them into the dining room. They placed the twins into their highchairs and sat in their own chairs. Throughout the meal, neither of Draco’s parents asked about the days they’d spent alone, although they did tell them about the childrens’ adventures.
Draco nodded slowly. “I really hope it’s a boy.”
The Slytherin nodded silently as he savored the moist cake and, after the meal, Draco excused himself to visit his dorm for a little while before their date to Hogsmeade.
The man was attractive and seemed to be around Remus' age. His hair was an even mixture of dark grey and black with a spray of white above his right eye where his cowlick sat.
Harry was trembling with shock as he shot up into a sitting position in his bed. He hurried into the secret study not certain what he was looking for but he couldn’t just stand by and let this happen. Hogwarts was his home. It was where all his bloodlines converged. Hogwarts couldn’t be destined for such a disastrous end. He had to figure out how to prevent it. He’d had the dream more than once. It had to mean something...didn’t it?
Harry stared at her as she made a fist and placed it over his heart. His mind froze as he recalled Sirius saying almost those exact words and he curled one hand around her fist with a tearful nod.
She shivered delicately. “I was told there would be tea. Am I welcome or not?”
Mac met them at the door as the group finished securing the vessel and Harry was glad to see him but he wanted to see if the man's curiosity outdid his discretion.
“Do you know what they are, Professor?” Harry asked, allowing her to see that he was curious but cautious.
Once safely in his room, Harry called out softly for his godfather and was rewarded with the man's face anxiously looking him over.
“That’s true.” Harry nodded. “Now, where are you taking me?”
“Like you did this summer.” Sirius laughed. “Nice one!”
Draco’s face flushed with his embarrassment and his hair fell around his face. On holidays, the blond didn’t always want to tame his pale locks.
Harry smiled at him. "Wherever you are comfortable."
“Come, Papa.” Lyra blinked up at Harry.
Harry did as Draco asked. “Ok, let’s close our eyes and take each other’s rose. Then, we’ll turn around and look.” Neither man wanted to see something less than what they felt.
"The house is different, Harry, not the gardens or grounds," Lucius informed them as they turned a corner.
"I'll be right there." Harry replied as he straightened his notes and set the quill aside.
Draco gritted his teeth and did as he’d been told. As soon as he’d done so, Harry pulled out to that point also before pushing all the way back in. That one motion had Draco balls deep inside his wife again as well and set them into the harrowing pace which Harry wanted. It wasn’t long until Harry heard Draco begin to sob his pleas.
Draco stared at the other boy for a moment. What he saw scared him. Harry seemed more vulnerable than Draco had ever seen him. He could sense a point of no return that hinged on his imminent response and knew he’d better mean what he said right now or Harry would be very upset. Suddenly, he realized that the thought of disappointing the boy in front of him in any way made him feel sad and almost desperate to find the right words. “Yes, Harry, I will.”
Lucius met them at the door and nodded formally to Harry’s guest. “Good evening, Minister.”
“Could you fetch our cloaks, please, Dinki?” Harry asked. “Scarves and gloves would be helpful also.”
Draco felt something in his pocket become warm and realized this meant Harry was calling him. He jumped up from his place at Marcus and Pansy’s small table and pulled the coin out to look at it. Looking back at his friends he knew they saw the worry in his eyes. “Harry needed time to himself. I told you that. He’s just let me know he’s on his way back.”
Draco smiled at his husband and shook his head. “They can call you Papa when we teach them how to talk, but I want to be called Daddy and Dad when they get older.”
"Harry!" Someone called.
"Mmm?" Luna blinked up at him. "What is?"
“Yeah. It wasn’t meant for his enjoyment alone. Let’s have some fun.” Harry didn’t wait for an answer, just nudged his broom up again. He scanned the sky and then began to skim the height of the stands. Bored with this tactic, Harry decided another feint was in order - just to see if Draco was still on his toes. He sped off to his right this time. Rising and falling in a bouncing pattern before going straight up. He felt more than saw Draco follow him.
“Lockets were the epitome of pureblood culture at the time.” Draco told him, squinting to see it better. “Depending on the details during the forging, it can show anything from a simple respect for tradition to possibly being a token of affection.”
Draco smiled at his boyfriend and nodded. “I think I’d like that.”
Hermione stared at him. Her eyebrows furrowed and her mouth looked pinched. “Ronald Weasley, that was such an insensitive thing to say! I can’t believe you! We just got married and you’re considering a gay affair!”
“Really?” Draco asked. “What are muggle sweets like?”
"Good night, Mother, Father...Thanks for telling us about this and getting the potion." Draco couldn't help sounding scared. He'd always been a bit of a baby when it came to pain. Maybe Harry would be able to make it better afterward. He really hoped so.
“I made fun of Luna for her insane cravings. I will not give in to mine.” Draco’s stomach rumbled even as he denied himself.
“Andromeda’s healer floo-called your address just a little while ago. She was here for an appointment and the healer thinks she’s at risk for a stroke.” Narcissa told them solemnly as they walked down the hallway. “The healer also said that someone needed to come take her home. So I left the twins with Dinki and sent you the note before coming through.”
Teddy squealed with laughter.
Draco stood and took his mother’s hand as they hurried away.
“Well, that’s not a problem… He’ll be the dominant one, of course.” Lucius decided.
Draco nodded slowly as his aunt left them to enjoy some time for herself.
“Yes.” Draco said softly as he rubbed his head. “I have you. I’ll be with friends. I’ll be fine…once this headache goes away.”
Draco was offended that Harry didn’t believe him, “Of course!”
The young men exchanged rings and were declared husbands. Their celebratory kiss was sweet and chaste but not without passion. The guests applauded them and the reporters present had their cameras flashing away.
“Dark hair…silver eyes…” Draco was stunned as he gave a chuckle. “What a striking combination…”
The more time he had to think about the idea the more he became a fan of it. The two boys would look striking together - one with black hair and olive skin, one with pale blond hair and skin like porcelain.
“Or...” Severus interrupted. “Correct me if I’m mistaken, but this particular tiara was called Ravenclaw’s diadem and was enchanted to enhance the wearer's intelligence. A diadem was used to denote authority - was it not? It could’ve been worn by one who oversaw an oath."
Harry gritted his teeth as he watched her put it on. "Will you try to get along with the Weasleys?"
Harry whispered as he closed the flap. He turned back and cast the shrinking charm. As he slid the trunk into his pocket, Harry lifted his wand and pointed to the street. A few steps forward and he heard it - the sound of the Knight Bus as it rattled to a stop.
Narcissa and Pansy giggled and, although the older man tried to hide it, Harry could see Lucius was also quite amused.
"What's happened, my boy?" He asked intently.
"Did you...in the dreams, were you...?" Lucius hesitated.
Harry came and slapped him on the back a few times to help before sitting again once Draco was alright.
The elder Malfoys looked at the boys from a couple of large armchairs that didn’t look like they belonged in a classroom.
"Maddy is being skeptical of this one. How do we be trusting so quickly?"
This made Harry look at him. "It doesn't look like any keyhole I've ever seen. Maybe the 'key' isn't an actual key. Maybe it's an object. What do we have around that's small and oval shaped?"
"Quite mysteriously they both calmed as soon as they heard the noises coming from your room." George snickered.
The sounds Draco made had both Harry and Astoria falling over the edge of oblivion and as soon as he felt Harry relax his hold, Draco allowed himself to fall after them. His arms tightened around his wife’s body as he cried out Harry’s title.
Harry smiled at Molly and promised to be there as soon as possible. Snuffles pressed against Harry's leg. Remus and Dudley also stayed with him as the elder Smith declined the invitation but Zacharias joined the rest for their portkey to Ottery St. Catchpole.
"What did you want to see us about, Harry?" McGonagall prodded the conversation forward.
On the other hand, an example of someone who wasn't making things easy on him was Madam Amelia Bones. She hadn't gotten back to Percy, so Harry decided to try writing to her in person.
A few days later, Harry escorted Draco and the twins by special Portkey to the cemetery at Godric’s Hollow. After thorough discussion, they’d made it tradition each year to visit the sight and summarize the previous year’s important events. Last December he’d introduced the twins and this time he told his parents, Sirius and Remus all about the new baby. As part of the tradition; at the end of each visit, Draco volunteered to conjure an arrangement of flowers with narcissus, zinnia, lilies and roses. This time however – the flowers disappeared and a small jewelry box appeared. Inside laid a necklace with a silver pendant in the shape of a flower. Neither man needed to ask what it meant and Harry was once again assured that his loved ones were content with how his life was going. Upon their return to the Manor, Draco became nauseous but was still able to help Harry tell the elder Malfoys what had happened.
"Now, the Dark Lord is back. Somehow his mind has begun to return to him and my father and godfather are telling me that the Flint family has separated from us, along with a couple of the others." Draco admitted as he turned around to face the young lord. "They were always among the more extreme followers and now that Uncle Tom isn't quite of the same mind, I'm free to be more... myself."
“We’re both only-children, Harry...” Draco said clearing his throat. “I don’t know about you, but I’d like a bigger family then that...”
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Harry nodded a polite farewell to his new in-laws and began to cross the room.
“Well, it’s not what the blood test the goblins at Gringotts performed says.” Harry growled at her. “Our ancestors on my mother’s side were none other than..."
“I guess Gryffindors don’t talk openly about sex?” Marcus smirked at the younger men but Pansy giggled outright before asking for the way to the bathroom.
“Can’t you apparate more quietly? You woke me up!” The blond was standing next to the bed and shouting.
“It hurts, Harry...” He winced.
Draco met them at the door. “Harry, take me back to our room? I’m still a bit tired...”
“Because Pansy wants to talk to Assistant-Professor Flint and I need to carry Tanis. Sorry, love, but that leaves you to play messenger,” Harry grinned.
Kreacher was mostly in charge of the cooking and cleaning the basement and first floor, so it was he that made their breakfast and served it to his Masters. Dinki was in charge of watching the babies and cleaning the second and third floors. They would cooperate to provide most of the feast for the party but Molly had insisted on making a few of her specialties as well as the cake.
Draco’s face flushed a deep rose as he nodded and said, “Please do it, Master? I want to be a good slave… I want to be your slut… your whore.”
“Well…that was rather anticlimactic.” Harry shrugged. “I thought he’d be happy.”
Harry woke up with a gasp. Breathing hard, he sat straight up with a hand on his head.
Harry waited for his husband to find the words.
Harry had simply nodded and called Kreacher for the floo powder. True to her word, the Healer had floo-called every morning and it took almost a week before Harry could inform her that Draco had begun to feel contractions. The Healer and her assistant arrived within minutes and quickly set up the tools of their trade.
Startled that he was so abruptly being smothered and awakened at the same time, Harry blinked rapidly and quickly recognized the scent. “T-Treacle? Dragon, what’s going on?”
“Tell Daddy more of the words we learned today.” Harry prompted them, vowing to teach them more of their ‘R’ sounds soon.
“Alright.” Harry approved the idea.
Draco opened his eyes but the fog was so dense that he could barely see anything until, suddenly, Harry Potter appeared a few yards away from him. He tried to speak but no sound came.
Harry turned the knob and suddenly they were overrun with Weasleys and Draco’s other friends while Pansy was fussing over Caelum and Ron over Lyra.
“Oh?” Harry looked up at his children while wrapping his arms around Draco. “What did they want?”
"See?" Harry smirked. "No insults."
The brunette nodded. “I did a little research into the meaning of the orchid and after discovering that it symbolizes love, fertility, luxury, beauty, wisdom, and thoughtfulness…it turns out that there’s an actual version of the orchid flower that is named silvana.”
Almost a month went by after Draco’s first lesson and one day, Master Loveday brought a bubbling cauldron with him.
"What do you know in regards to Davies, Malfoy?" Harry asked as he began making his way toward the great hall. "How do you know it?"
"On the night of the full moon!" Severus shouted.
Harry’s eyes twinkled as he patted Draco’s hand comfortingly. “It’ll be ok, Dray. The elf will bring you back a whole gallon and keep it in the kitchen just for you. You can have it whenever you want.” He looked at the elf who was staring at the teary-eyed blond wizard. “You heard Draco; we’d like a whole gallon of Tin-roof sundae ice cream from Fortescue’s. With all the soon-to-be pregnant witches and wizards you might want to stock up on all sorts of flavors.”
Sirius watched Harry's expression as he was speaking. He knew he could tease his godson but it might undo the trust he'd earned over the last couple of hours. "Don't forget the mirrors, pup. You can get in touch whenever you need us."
As he moved his eyes strategically around the room, Draco listened to Harry converse with his friends. The Gryffindor Golden Boy seemed to be holding his own with both Blaise and Pansy. Draco had no idea what to make of it but, since his new goal was to protect Harry and his elemental powers from being used for nefarious purposes, two allies would be appreciated. Pansy said something that made Harry smirk at Draco but, before the blond could reply, the doors of the great hall swung open to reveal that Professor Snape had returned from London.
“It did indeed, my darling Dragon.” Harry’s eyes were soft and misted as he held his beloved husband tightly to his side and drifted off to sleep.
“Don’t forget the things from that book Hermione gave us, Harry,” Draco shook his head with an expression of amusement but held Harry’s hand tightly as they walked down the staircase to meet Al.
“Not if you owl it to Smith. You could be keeping him informed of Dudley’s health as he’s a mutual relation.” Draco argued, pleasantly bumping their shoulders.
"Do you want to marry me?" Draco looked at the other boy carefully. "Or do you think that, because you're my mate, it's going to happen eventually anyway so 'why not'?"
Harry's eyes closed as he realized he had an audience. Sighing, he turned to look at his guests. "I suppose that's not too much to ask." He smirked as he held out his hand while trying to hide his embarrassment.
“Think about it, Zack.” Harry laughed, more amused with every passing moment. “He has always been competitive with me and now that we’re dating, I doubt that will change beyond the spirit of the competition. In this case, he has the distinct advantage of living in the house I’ll be searching. At lunch, he was quiet and seemed to be disappointed about something until I gave him something else to think about. I’m sure that’s it.”
"The dreams, Siri." Harry reminded him. "I've confided to Draco and his father about the dreams and the conclusions I've come to about them. My instincts tell me to trust the Malfoys and Tom said he'd swear an oath to my safety as soon as I arrive."
"You boasted of your knowledge of the wizarding world and the school we would both soon attend - including the house you were certain you'd be sorted into." Harry told him regretfully. "I spent the next few hours being told that the very house you aspired to join was the one all the dark wizards came from and that the one who killed my parents was the most recent dark wizard to emerge from it."
Harry felt a tingle down his spine. “That’s the Slytherin puzzle piece.”
“And if I don’t own the elf I want to call?” Harry asked carefully.
Pansy giggled. "I'm sure there was more going on in your head than just four words, Draco."
“Draco needed me…or I would’ve come to speak with you earlier.” Harry said as quietly as possible. He related the events from the early evening and asked what they made of it.
“Don’t you see? I was moving on instinct, Draco. I didn’t even realize until you stopped me what I was doing.” Harry suppressed tears. “I don’t want to hurt you or even just remind you of him.”
/*/*/*/*/*
“Are you sure you wouldn’t mind me staying here?” Draco whispered, glancing behind him as Harry moved in closer.
“Maddie! Draco is a very good friend of Pansy’s and mine. Do be nice.” Marcus came forward to hug his sister while scolding her mildly. “Draco, you and Harry will be the first to know when the baby gets here. Go home and have your dinner. Get some sleep if we don’t contact you by nightfall.”
Petunia sat on the couch and began to cry.
Harry watched as Lucius placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I’m unsure of how to ascertain the truth of the matter without divulging the events of this discussion. He is a master Occlumens and so, is immune to the family’s ability.”
Draco’s blush deepened as he tipped his head back and once again welcomed Harry into his life.
“I know, and our first anniversary is a very special occasion…” Harry grinned as they mounted the stairs. “Don’t worry, I have something planned. I have a few things planned, actually.” When they arrived at the childrens’ room, Harry had Dinki send the confirmation notes about Draco’s official graduation party which was planned for the next day. Then, he watched Draco cuddle their daughter and son.
Viktor swooped past Harry always opposite him. If Harry went clockwise, Viktor flew counter-clockwise. If the brunette looked down, the older man looked up.
She smirked briefly. “Well enough…for the moment.”
"Goodnight, Draco, my love." Harry whispered with a mysterious smile on his lips.
Harry nodded absently to accept the information until he realized that he hadn't asked her to accompany him yet. His eyes refocused on her face just as she winked at him and giggled.
“He apologizes...” Draco whispered tucking his hair behind one ear.
“Still the blushing bride, eh?” Marcus winked before turning to head up some stairs. “I was surprised to learn which position you took.”

Ignoring him, Teddy squirmed in Harry’s embrace. “Gramma said you’d be happy, Ry. Why you sad?”
"What about constellation names?" Lucius asked softly as he joined them. "Or simply names of stars…"
“Barb?” Draco latched onto the strange word. “I thought you said she was joking.”
Harry nodded slowly. “I know...and I’m trying.”
“I would love some pizza, Aunt Andy!” Draco bit his lip.
“By the way, I got one of those dildos for you, Draco…the ones that can be connected by a spell to someone’s cock? This one is connected to your cock instead of mine.” Harry removed the cat tail and rubbed some more lube onto Draco’s hole before pushing the toy inside his body. “You’re about to fuck yourself while you suck me off.”
Draco’s breath caught. “Harry, it feels like...”
Harry kept himself still for another few seconds before pushing further and further in.
Draco blinked at the abrupt disruption of the bliss he’d just been immersed in. “You can’t just say something like that, Harry! You’ve got me thinking the worst now. Tell me what the problem is and then we’ll bring my parents in later if we can’t solve it ourselves.”
Harry took a step out the door to the private room and sighed. He'd considered telling Remus about the snake in his rucksack but decided against it. He didn't know why but it seemed like a bad idea. He hurried over to the stairs and then up to the next floor. He knocked to let the snake hide if she wanted to, and then he used the key and went inside.
"If it can be used effectively by us for the war effort, it could be just as effective against us." Remus pointed out grimly.
"We're cousins?" Ron's face lit up. "Distant cousins but still!"
Lucius nodded at him as they passed.
"I can't wait!" Dudley replied with a wide grin. "I'll pay really close attention!"
Draco saw it instantly. “Her eyes! Harry, Silvana’s eyes match mine!”
“I won’t flip out, if that’s what you mean.” The blond was beginning to get discouraged. “You conjure one, too. That way we won’t be able to lie to each other.”
Blaise let Draco hand Mina back into his arms. “It was really good to see you guys. Thanks for coming.”
Harry frowned at the older woman and he could see Narcissa sit more stiffly than she had been. “What do you mean, Andy?”
Nodding, Harry asked urgently. "Can we go early?"
Draco opened his mouth to allow Harry entrance and moaned at the taste of Harry’s cock. He licked and suckled as he moved his lips over his husband’s veined organ. He whimpered as Harry’s fingers tangled in his hair to pull him away.
“Don’t go far, Harry.” Sirius said quietly.
Harry nodded. "I'll have that oath before the explanation... and in return, they may forgo the title."
Dinki nodded, picked up the baby and his things, and then popped out just in time as Draco stood and approached the brunette with no small amount of emotion.
The elves could only nod.
"I heard what you said to Smith." Ron mumbled when he figured Harry was close enough. "I saw it get tense and didn't want anything to get out of hand."
“Withhold an orgasm? Spank you?” Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “You hate being spanked and I love seeing you climax …Are you sure this potion…?”
Draco had searched the tomes in any library he could find to see if there was a law or spell or potion that could get him out of his father’s – and Astoria’s – reach. It had been inside a text from deep in the Malfoy library that he’d found the ‘Power of Love’ ritual. Though it relegated the target to a life of submission, it also produced the effect that the young blond had wanted. He’d given the book to Harry and convinced his lover to cast the ritual with him.
Draco noticed his godfather's attention was elsewhere and looked up as well. "Uncle!"
“Your room guardian is familiar to you both, I’m certain.” She gestured toward the frame. “The setting is customized for both his comfort and your convenience.”
"Did you tell Ernie about my intentions?" The young lord asked.
"I'll bet you think it'll be me...but Seamus is actually the submissive in our marriage." Neville smirked.
"I agree." Harry acknowledged this with a nod. "Neither side should be forced to conform to the other, but we must gain understanding of both in order to protect them from each other."
Al applied the potion the same way as the first time. The spine glowed and then the pages. When the glow didn’t fade right away, they opened the book. Each picture was glowing individually and only when all the pictures were glowing did the glow begin to fade.
“We’ll find out what’s really going on with Tom.” Harry sighed as he gave up trying to convince them. Sooner or later his powers would be needed and then they would see and believe.
“The tulips.” Draco smirked. “The yellow and orange ones.”
Harry winced and hurried to reassure the other man. "I didn't mean it like that. I was trying for light teasing and kind of hoping I could tempt you into a date...?"
Harry listened with eagerness as she told them all the animals she’d seen. Horses, sheep and goats as well as many rodents like lemmings had come to meet her but only the great eagle owl had come close enough for her to touch.
"No...l meant..." Harry faltered with a grimace and sighed. "I might end up needing help with it."
******** ******** Chapter 32 ******** ********
“Of course, Viktor.” Draco seemed nervous but kept his own eyes firmly focused on his fiancé.
“So good, Harry…” Draco whispered in a needy tone.
"How will we get the others?" Harry wanted to know.
Draco had a small smile as they laid back, allowing Dinki to collect the left-overs. “I like that. It’s a good philosophy…”
Draco's nod of understanding stopped him. "Him being where he was saved me from another difficult set of circumstances, Harry. I was his heir. He had plans for me... my role whether I liked it or not was to marry and continue the Malfoy family legacy. The fact that I'm bisexual had him believing he would have my cooperation but I want love not alliances. I want passion not a business deal with the addition of sex. With Father in prison, I was in charge of my life. Mother tried to guide me to the options he would approve of until he died. Then...after the funeral ceremonies were over she sat me down and asked one simple question. What would make me happy?"
"Your mother likes yellow jewels." Lucius reminded him innocently.
“What’s the difference?” Pansy asked in confusion.
“Dinner…” He whispered back despairingly. “We’ll be late...”
"It does." Draco confided. "I'm also happy to report that he seems to be quite serious about us being more than mere flirtation."
Draco nodded with jerky movements. “It also seemed to get worse when Harry entered the picture.”
Draco nodded grimly. "I'll floo over now. You get what you need and grab Sirius."
"Yeah, we're doing great and Teddy will soon have friends to play with." Harry squeezed Draco's hand.
Harry smiled and patted Draco’s ass. “As my kitten your job is to humor my every whim. If I tell you that my kitten should play with a ball of string, and give you that ball of string…”
Dinki sniffled at the sentiment and popped away to resume her duties.
Harry kissed the side of Draco’s neck, where he liked to sometimes leave a light mark, “After that, I’ll have my favorite meal.”
Harry hesitated but then pushed through the feeling. "Dobby?" He called.
“What are you saying, Draco?” Harry asked as he cupped his husband’s face.
"HARRY!" Neville called, excitedly as he ran over from the Gryffindor table. "Is it true? Professor Sprout told me you specifically requested for me to be on the team!"
“Still…I was svelte and limber and it wasn’t tiring at all until I got pregnant.” Draco sighed patting his wet tummy. “I want to lose this pouch, Harry. I may have carried twins but I shouldn’t look like it.”
Draco followed at a slow crawl with a strange sense of foreboding but kept silent.
“This is your first time, Draco...Our first time together. I want you to enjoy it. I don’t want to hurt you or order you around like some kind of barbaric slave-master.” Harry explained as he stroked the other man’s arms. “I also don’t want this whole consummation thing to just be ‘sex for the legal end of things’. I’m not going to force anything...” He pulled the blond closer. “What I’m going to do is make love to you...”
“Yes. I decided to have the unlivable remains of the house torn down so we could build the amazing home you and the architect came up with,” Harry nodded thoughtfully, allowing his lips to begin to curve.
Draco sighed, “Alright, Harry. I just want to encourage her – them to talk.”
Feeling along the wall he came to a doorknob and turned it. He glanced back to see if anyone was around to notice the fabric move but he was alone so he pushed the long forgotten door and felt it give way.
Harry summoned the parchment and two quills and they both began to write.
The snake moved to attack, but Harry stopped her with a harsh hiss allowing Draco to run for the porch.
"George found it." Ron said, pulling his brother along as they passed the others and gave the password to the Fat Lady.
This sparked a reaction for Pansy. "Draco, what can you possibly want that these guys haven't given you? The French guy last summer was hot and you said you liked him but it didn't 'feel' right. You said Thomas' kisses were delightful! The sex with Richard was sweet and sensual."
He felt the salt as Draco sprinkled it over the moist skin and gave him the lime to hold.
A wave of his wand started the bath in the master suite. Another flick added the lavender scented bubbles that Ginny had always recommended for its soothing properties. Then he stripped. It was his favorite thing about September. The kids were gone and he could walk around in whatever state of dress he liked. With Ginny gone as well, he wouldn’t even need to consider any protests about modesty. He threw the clothing into the laundry chute before turning to go upstairs. He stopped at the linen closet for a large towel but soon he was slipping into the steaming hot tub.
Draco backed away but Harry was too quick.
"Moony, I want to talk to you both but I feel like you still have some kind of attachment to Dumbledore." Harry began. "I should've thought of it before. Would you both go to Gringotts and get tested for spells and potions that may be affecting you?"
"That's great, Dudley." Harry grinned, truly pleased that his cousin was becoming more and more interested and passionate about the magical world and his place in it. "I want us to talk about dreams and prophecies and all that when I'm home for the holidays."
“We’ll tell Lucius at breakfast.” She nodded and hurried away to floo-call the Healer.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “Public knowledge only!”
Harry nodded, “I meant every word. Now, we should step it up because your parents are still out there.”
Draco's eyes closed as he admitted it with a nod. "I was drifting in and out... and I decided to thank you for being so nice as to bring me home and take care of me. I meant to kiss your cheek."
"I want that too, Harry. But first..." Draco asked softly. "Let me suck you? I really want to taste you…"
"I promised Pansy we'd visit her mother's grave on the 28th… Uhmmm…" Draco frowned and glanced at his friend. "Oh, the New Years Ball! My parents will hold a ball on New Years Eve in the ballroom – it may turn out to be just a small party this year – but other than that…we can do whatever we want."
“Lucius, you are interfering in my relationship with your son, once again, instead of being there for us…like you said you would.” Harry commented casually. “You may be his father, but I’m his Dominant husband. I decide what’s best for him…not you. You need to accept my control of him or this whole thing will be quite messy.”
Harry shook his head with wide eyes. "They aren't stolen! Hidden is a better word. They never left your house. I promise! I put them in my duffel bag and asked Twinky to hide it for a few days. They would've reappeared tomorrow if you didn't bring it up tonight."
A small smile curved Draco’s lips. “Arranged marriages are not uncommon in my family, Starla. Harry offered a good life with the possibility of love. At the time, I didn’t know about his wealth but I respected his power – still do – and his actions during the war proved to me that I could trust him in other ways. Trust and respect are important in any marriage but the fact that he could possibly grow to love me was – I think – what really made me say yes. I mean he was going into this marriage wanting it to become love. In my mind that meant I could count on being treated with some dignity and respect despite what my father thought was likely and any children we raised would be loved.”
“It’s not that I care who she married, Ginny. I told you how she spoke to Draco that time and you all know that she wanted to hand me over to Voldemort at the final battle. I have no good feelings toward the girl at all, but she was a friend of Draco’s for a long time before the war.” Harry said sitting on Draco’s chaise. “She’s also a friend of Blaise and Luna’s. Why don’t you tell them what happened last evening, Blaise?”
“What?” Lucius frowned.
“We approve.” Lucius said as quietly as one can with the Sonorus charm on him. “Harry has many things we’ve always wanted for our son; magical power, political connections, wealth, maturity, integrity… a modicum of common sense.” He paused as the crowd chuckled. “He is a powerful young wizard who has had an amazing impact on today’s wizarding society. He will likely be a political force in the future and his children will very likely shape that future. Our family will be involved by virtue of their being Draco’s as well. The only thing left that we can ask for is that he do all he can to keep Draco happy.”
He wasn’t the man everyone thought he was and the wizarding world needed to be told. The general public knew him as an oddly sweet, doddering old man who'd once been a brave champion that fought a terrible dark wizard for the best interests of all magical folk everywhere, earning a variety of honors including the Order of Merlin, first class. To them he was the smart and talented wizard who discovered twelve uses of dragon’s blood and then teamed up with a notable alchemist to create the philosopher's stone, and he was that man...
Teddy sat nodding for a moment before bringing his gaze back up to focus on Harry’s face. “So Gramma’s in Heaven and you’re taking care of me.”
“Oh, Cissy! They remind me of me and my Ted,” Andromeda sniffed.
When Draco got up the courage, he pushed slightly at Harry’s chest and they exited the small room hand in hand only to find Lucius and Narcissa as well as Molly and Arthur waiting for them.
“Hot. Yeah…I love when you come up with fun ideas for us to try.” Harry’s eyes sparkled as a smile tugged his lips. He quickly banished the rope from Draco’s wrists and closed his trousers. “I also love when you let me indulge my fetish.”
"Just a cool-" Fred and George held up their right hands and promised. "Set of rooms with-"
"Why not floo-call in the morning?" The old man attempted. "I'm sure he'll be feeling much better by then. If he isn't, I'll go to St. Mungo's myself."
“Yes.” Draco smiled. “Love is enduring where Romance comes and goes. We have cared for each other through sickness and drunken- ness. You've not given up on me...on us... even through my temper and my original hesitation to become a couple... not to mention the lack of sexual progression between us."
Draco just grinned and sighed, savoring his food. He knew the tender chicken was really made in the kitchen by the house elves, but he pretended they were in France, looking over the Seine with the Eiffel Tower in the distance. Dinki came and got the empty dishes just before Harry and Draco exited the room to remake it into the beach.
"So that's why you continue to suspect Severus." Lucius murmured.
“Miscarriage has always been a deeply rooted fear for me, Kingsley.” Draco whispered still trembling.
As he finished the last bit of his treacle tart, Harry saw Fred and George get up and leave. He and Ron left as soon as he promised to have Dobby bring a bowl of popcorn to the meeting. Luna and Ginny caught up with them in the hallway and soon enough they were back at the suite waiting for Zack, who burst into the apartment after the popcorn had been delivered.
Dooley popped up next to his newest Master and instantly fixed Harry up by banishing the soot from his clothing. He then bowed low. “Master Rax be telling Dooley that Master Harry be arriving soon. Master Harry’s suite is ready but Master Rax asks that Master Harry proceed to the portrait gallery at his earliest convenience. Refreshments be offered in one hour.”
"Look something's going on with Hermione. I haven't heard from her in weeks and then I wrote her about our tiff and all her reply said was that Dumbledore had told her it was best for us all to remain inky muni cado - or something like that - during this summer and I was not allowed to write to either of you." Ron ranted in a low tone. "I dunno what to make of it. Even Ginny's been turned away."
“You need sleep not more reading…” Draco paused trying not to discourage Harry while also trying to make the other man understand there was still plenty of time. “I’ve only finished the first six and a half levels of my training. I’m not going into business tomorrow, you know. I might have more children…I might not understand something and have to start a level over someplace down the line.”
She pursed her lips and sniffed as they moved behind Korlag's desk. Harry sat and was handed a sheaf of paper. "Sign here, here, and there." She pointed to a line on the second page with an x then turned to the third and fifth pages in rapid succession.
Narcissa stood, “Caelum Orion Malfoy-Potter is the first male born from the union of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.”
Harry chuckled. “Yes, I’m sure I passed but I’m also sure I didn’t end up with an ‘O’.”
“It’s alright, Nev. I haven’t taken the sleep spell off of Ali yet.” Seamus was smiling.
Draco sipped his tea slowly in an effort to figure out what to say. He couldn’t talk about Harry’s powers but only Blaise and Pansy had sworn secrecy about the secret rooms that belonged to Salazar Slytherin. “I’d prefer my father to be here when I speak about the secret quarters of the founders... but we could talk about my classes.”
Pansy held her breath. This would tell them just how much influence Harry had with the older man.
"Or feeding you sweets that change you into an animal for a minute or two and then change you back." Fred said as he joined the group. "You alright, Nev?"
“Gamma?” Lyra’s excited little voice chimed in.
“Yes,” Harry answered softly glancing at a blushing Draco. “I wish I could do this right. I wish it could be less business and more emotion.”
Draco suggested that Pansy and Lavender would like a perfume from the next store they went to. It sold many accessories and scents as well as books and other trivialities. Harry knew Blaise liked to watch Quidditch as much as Ron and the others so he’d already sent away for tickets to the opening game of the season between the Chudley Cannons and Puddlemere United and he was giving them to his whole group of friends.
Draco gasped. "Pans!"
Draco frowned at Harry as they walked down the street and into a muggle pub. “Why now? Did she say?”
"Cedric is meeting us in the corridor outside Hufflepuff's entrance." Zack told him.
“I dunno, Uncle Harry.” Teddy shook his head with a very serious expression. “Maybe I should think about it.”
"Will you dance with me?" Draco asked, almost shy.
"Well, you set him straight, right?" Hermione questioned him with a sharp look.
Harry reached out with one hand and took Andromeda's before she could panic. "Narcissa… I'm sure you know who this is…"
“Are you saying that your mother and I didn’t give you enough confidence in yourself?” Lucius glared at his son. “We gave you everything you could ever want!”
As soon as the baby latched onto it, Dinki nodded her approval and seeing that the new addition to the family was in good hands, the rest of the Malfoy elves bowed and curtsied on their way back to their own duties.
Harry frowned, thinking hard. "Is it because the property is unplottable?"
The Malfoy-Potters greeted their friend but got right to the point because of the time constraints.
"Yes, anyway, he's trying to reclaim the objects because they are...what?" Draco frowned as Harry stood and began to pace.
Harry stood up behind him and they didn't look at each other as they exited the train but when Draco turned away to look for his mother, Harry held fast to his hand and pulled him back.
As he was leaving the apartment, Fred and George walked up. "So, we came up with something to punish Luna's bullies but Gin has another idea and we kind of like it."
“Oh, that’s right! Well, I’m glad that’s done with!” Ron grinned at her.
******** ******** Chapter 39 ******** ********
The elf soon rejoined the group and handed over a lovely silver plate that was curved to wrap partially around the hair and had leather strips hanging from either side before popping back to her previous duties.
“Peas come, Daddy?” Caelum asked as he reached out a hand in Draco’s direction.
“Yes, Mr. Potter, but there will be many brokenhearted young ladies out there also.” The Headmistress smiled uncertainly. “May I ask why you’d like to choose Mr. Malfoy?”
The older blond man nodded curtly and followed the boys into the shop. “If only to be sure my son gets a ring that is worthy of him...”
“The cottage is someplace neither of us has ever lived or had any kind of experiences before,” the blond sighed happily. “It’s a new start for both of us.”
Draco picked up a peanut-butter and grape jelly sandwich from the nearest plate and began to eat it as if he hadn’t eaten anything for several weeks. “I wonder what he wants.”
“WOOF, WOOF!” The toy barked loudly.
"Her socks..." Zack cringed. "I like to take a walk before breakfast while the weather allows, and I happened to see her wading in the lakeside. A friend had accompanied me, bringing along his friend from Ravenclaw house. They thought it would be funny..."
Draco’s eyes glittered in the sunlight as his hand slipped from the crook of Harry’s elbow into the other man’s hand. “C’mon, Harry!” The blond led him through a maze of hallways and staircases before they reached a set of double doors. Draco faced his husband. “I haven’t been in this suite in years, Harry, but… out of all the rooms I call mine…this one was always my favorite. Now I get to share it with you…”
"If Harry goes, so do I." Dudley said quietly.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ll say...”
“Give me a minute before you apply the potion, please.” Harry’s voice was hard and grim as he took the book from Draco’s instructor.
Dudley nodded. "Ready when you are, Harry."
Draco whimpered at the thought of Harry’s mouth surrounding his cock.
"My room is fine, Sirius." Dudley was saying.
Once all bellies had been filled, Harry found a path to Draco’s side. He whispered into the blond’s ear. “Molly has asked if we’ll stay the night but I’d really like to get you alone.”
“If it would make you feel better...” Sirius could tell that Harry was really bothered by this situation. “I can poke around as a dog tomorrow, pup.”
“At least Lyra had the good sense to inherit the Malfoy blond,” Draco smirked as he picked her up, “Although she does have your thick, unruly mess. It’s truly a good thing you learned how to braid, Harry.”
Prompt  #5 - coffee shop
Harry lifted the sword and then touched the brim of the hat just in time to feel something inside of it. “Shall we say Sunday night, Headmaster?”
“We’ve all missed you, Harry!” One of Draco’s great-great aunts called out flirtatiously.
“I’m going to ask you not to wank, Draco...not anymore...not unless I tell you to.” Harry imposed this as his first request made of his submissive spouse. “If you want sex, you can always come to me...I’ll only turn you down if one of us is sick or injured, my dragon. Will you obey?”
This gave Draco a mission and, when Harry got him back to the Manor, he insisted on a visit to the family tree tapestry in the library. After escorting Draco to his intended destination and calling Dinki to attend him, Harry went looking for his in-laws. He found Lucius reading in his office and, after knocking on the door, he walked woodenly to the sofa across from the desk.
“I’m sorry for fibbing and almost being late for the holiday dinner, Father,” Draco said just as softly, before sitting in the chair Harry held out for him.
“You always seem to be able to know what I’d like so I hope my intuition measures up.” Draco smiled and summoned a gift from the pile. “This one isn’t bought; it’s from my vault and I had it altered a bit.”
Finally the cloud settled on a lavender color.
"I believe there are introductions to be made..." Draco smirked as their fingers touched. "As you're both lords, I think the etiquette is that the guest is presented to the host or the lower level to the higher... but since there are multiple layers to the proceedings I'd like to present my suitor to my father."
“I am…please; Harry?” Draco responded softly.
Andy’s eyes widened. “Oh, what a lovely Gyrfalcon!”
"I'm glad you feel that way, Lord Potter." She grinned. "I was just thinking that several students could be of use and his name was at the top of the list."
"I've thought about a lot of things this summer, Malfoy." Harry replied honestly. "You see, fate had a birthday gift for me this year - a new path for my life."
January came and the childrens’ magic settled down. The twins seemed to enjoy changing the color of their clothes but it wasn’t something they did on a regular basis. Toys would occasionally fly across the room or just float above the crib of whichever child was performing the magic. Harry and Draco would fuss and praise them but soon they knew they’d have to correct this behavior because the secrecy of the magical world would eventually demand that the children perform no magic before they got to Hogwarts.
Draco informed his friend of what had happened and their plans for the puppy on the way back to the nearest floo. They arrived at the Weasley residence in a quick and orderly fashion and Harry did all the talking while his pregnant companions sat for a refreshing glass of water. Molly and Arthur understood Harry’s interpretation of the incident’s implications and agreed at once to watch the pup.
The brunette blushed at the affection in the older man’s question. “Before I married Draco it was Hermione or Molly and then…well, my Dragon seemed to take pleasure in it so I let him.”
Remus sat back in his chair with a hand on his head. "Dementors in Little Whinging? And they attacked? On your private property?"
"She said partners had to be from opposite houses, Ron. They wouldn't have put us together anyway." Harry reasoned.
"Ginny, you’re closer." Harry knew this would be easily confirmed but he wasn’t sure what to do if it was a lie. “Please call the Burrow for me.” He watched Percy as she threw the powder into the grate.
“I need to see this first-hand.” Lucius insisted. “It is family custom for the father to witness consummations of marriage. My father watched mine and I was cheated for the last six months.”
"One of the boys at the orphanage attempted to bully me so I showed him my power and it scared him. I rather enjoyed the feeling of revenge, but I was visited by Dumbledore who reprimanded me." Tom grinned. "A passive power like talking to snakes was fun but fairly innocent, so he said I shouldn't use anything beyond that skill while away from school. After a while, resentment built up toward the other children in the orphanage because they didn't have to hide."
"I'll call him now and let you know what he says." Harry hurried down to his room, leaving Zack to stare after him.
Soon they passed the portrait of the Quidditch boy that guarded the Flint apartment and Harry sighed as he realized who inhabited the frame attached to their rooms.
Draco's face paled.
Draco opened his eyes and smirked. “You are mine...No threesomes – ever.”
Dudley went next and Harry followed them.
Starla bit her lip. “Didn’t you want control? I was under the impression that the law was meant to liberate you from your oppressive positions under your parents’ control.”
Draco looked startled. "Really?"
Harry held his arm out with a smirk and Draco clasped his hand around Harry’s elbow to be escorted into the inner office.
“Yes, Harry, why is Malfoy standing next to you like that?” Hermione asked incredulously.
Harry sent Ziva to get Sirius and rushed into the floo room just in time to see Draco appear in the fireplace. "I missed you this morning."
Harry walked over to each in turn and gripped their arms. Remus opened his eyes and scrambled to his feet, breathing fast. Sirius woke next but remained on his back for a moment while Harry moved on to the goblin director who gave Harry a nod of thanks and turned to help his grandmother while Remus woke Korlag and the assistant.
Sigmund answered.
“Me too…and for longer than just today.” Draco told him softly.
“Tell us about that, if you don’t mind.” Astoria’s mouth widened into a smirk.
“Meet us out here after the meal. You don’t want to stand between a pregnant person and their food, Zabini… Trust me.” Harry smirked.
Minerva Mcgonagall looked at her student and lifted one eyebrow. "Were you flirting, Potter?"
“They are discussing it as we speak, my dear.” Narcissa smiled softly as she left the room to call Dippy the elf.
"From here on out, your age only matters to the outside world, Draco." Narcissa told him quietly. "Legally, your father and I must conduct the family business until you turn seventeen, but you now have a say."
Harry’s eyes sparkled as he and Draco hurried to their suite. “Wow, Draco. I really thought your dad would say no!”
Draco fell gracefully to his knees and looked up at Harry.
“Well, of course it wouldn’t do to simply end the program.” Hermione nodded solemnly.
“Yes, he’s quite the romantic – this one.” Draco smiled softly as the reporters went on.
“Sure.” Seamus carefully handed his two and a half week old daughter to Lolli when she appeared. “I’ll have to feed her in around an hour though.”
“I’m sure he will.” Draco smiled a little through his tears. “She raised him for most of his life so far and he loves her…”
"Let's go to yours." Harry suggested. "That way you can kick me out if I do something you don't like."
Harry swallowed and climbed up to the place beside his panting husband. “That was just for starters, Dragon…We have lots of time before the world will expect us to turn out more Malfoy-Potter babies and you’d still have to take the potion before it could happen. You’ll get lots more of this and even fit your training in there somewhere before that happens.”
"Let's see what's going on with Hermione, girl. I haven’t heard from her since school." Harry said, stroking the owl's chest. "I've asked her to visit for my birthday and told her there were some things I want to talk to her about. It should be a quick trip. Wait a bit to see if she has a reply, won't you?"
"Think its him?" Michelle asked in a low voice.
"Excellent!" Harry grinned at his friends. "I'll speak to Korlag on my birthday. He's my estate manager."
"It's just how I remember it from second year, Draco." Harry murmured with a mischievous smirk as he sat on the sofa in exactly the spot he'd occupied on his previous visit.
As soon as Harry saw the arrogant arse disappear through the floo, he went to greet Molly and Arthur. He thanked them for the gathering before moving on to speak with Ron.
Harry took instant offense. “First of all, we were in the middle of something if you don’t mind. Second, if you’d read the letters we sent...”
"Heya, Zack." Cedric grinned before turning his eyes toward Harry. "Hi! Erm, I don't know how you want me to address you...Potter? Lord Potter?"
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
“She could maybe stay with us…but I don’t know if I can handle two pregnant women at once.” He looked almost afraid.
Draco nodded to encourage his boyfriend to elaborate. "Did you say yes?"
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Silverling's eyebrow rose slightly. "I see. We shall toss her entire interview but there's still the issue of Dudley Dursley's kidnapping."
"Hey, Gred." Harry said to them while keeping his eyes on Zack. "I think you're a little too amused by Luna's suffering. Her 'nargle pranks' are more than likely just bullies picking on her because she's different." He waited for Zack to say he was wrong but the words didn't come. "Well, I won't stand for it."
Rax nodded at her comment. “You see?”
They headed out toward the nearest apparition point with Harry's hand at the small of Draco's back. He turned into Harry's embrace and let his boyfriend take him to their destination which turned out to be a little Italian restaurant overlooking the Thames from the Isle of Dogs. They enjoyed a leisurely meal which included dessert and went home.
perfect body...” He joked, winking at his fiancé as everyone except Harry and Draco enjoyed a chuckle. “No, truly, I’m a very lucky man...vith a terrible sense of humor. Thank you for accepting my troth, Draco… Also, thank you all for celebrating vith us. Enjoy the moussaka!”
Draco fumed internally as he reread the letter he'd just received.
“I know some. There wasn’t much else to do during my summers at the Dursleys so I sometimes read my cousin’s old school books,” Harry smirked.
“Oh, is that all?” Ron smirked. “It’s just legally sanctioned dating, Harry. You have dates and you learn about each other. Gifts are usually given every month, but this is a shortened courting so maybe one per week would be better.”
"Draco, is there something you're not telling us?" Narcissa asked, slightly alarmed.
Harry let the blond sit on the sofa and then perched next to his husband to dry his tears. “It’ll be fine, Dragon. We’ve been through this before.” Harry reminded his husband as they stared at their Christmas tree. “Lyra and Caelum need time away from us as much as we need time alone. They have to learn to trust other people besides us. They have Dinki and your parents just now and they’ll be fine.”
Draco used a levitation spell to fetch the bottle from it’s spot while Harry cast a cleaning charm on the glasses...or tried. “C’mon, Harry. It’s all going the same place.”
“They are called incubi and succubi and they're essentially the same creature." Draco began. "It’s just that one is dominant and one is submissive.”
Draco blushed but nodded as their hands touched. He felt like they held hands more than most couples he’d ever seen.
Harry nodded. "So we pulled it up onto the dock we'd jumped off of and opened it up. Inside was a book which turned out to contain an explanation of how Lady Ravenclaw had heard of the sightings of Nessie and came searching for whatever the creature was. She found the place - the cove and it's island. She found evidence of Vikings having lived or at least sheltered there and then she found Nessie who was living in an underwater cave below the water level. To protect the cove and Nessie, she cast spells to make it unplottable and added layered illusion spells."
"Oh? What's that?" Draco frowned as he began steering his father toward Harry's suite.
Two days passed and the specialists finally owled. They would be able to visit that evening.
Draco sighed. "I don't know."
Harry rolled the words over in his mind. He'd heard from many people that Dumbledore had been a very amiable person in his youth. He'd been friendly and outgoing - charming and sociable but he was still all of those things so what exactly was this nutter saying?
“You want an appointment with Madam Bones?"  Percy sounded appalled. "The head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement?”
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
"Draco, I thought you remembered what Madam Pomphrey said. No heavy lifting because of the pressure it can create on your stomach. The baby would qualify and I don't want you hurt." Harry reminded him gently. "You can hold him when you're sitting or lying down."
“You will... but not today.” Draco took Harry’s hand and brought his eyes up to meet his boyfriend’s. “Harry, you called me pretty and promised to take me to a karaoke bar and asked me if I could love you. This is my way of answering that question...”
“I suppose it’s possible.” Zack frowned. “But he could’ve just been disappointed in the lunch menu.”
“Well, now you do.” Draco nodded regally.
By mid-March, Draco had reached the third level of his training but the children had yet to speak. One day as Harry was finishing Draco’s braid, he heard a shocked squeak from Dinki.
“Yes, actually, I’ve nothing booked on the 27th.” He said.
Narcissa grinned widely and winked. “Exactly.”
A throat cleared. It was Ron. “Mione has been looking for you two...Seems the Malfoys have ministry contacts and one of them told Draco’s parents about the arrest. They’re on their way to Robards’ office.”
“And you’ll call after you’ve handled the business end of things?” Teddy prodded his uncle with the toe of his foot.
Harry gaped. This was definitely not what he’d expected her to say. He bit his lip and took a breath to try and respond but she beat him to it.
Fred swooned and George caught him. "Of course!"
“We’ve talked things over thoroughly and come to common ground, Susan.” Harry said gently. “He’s had reasons for his past behavior. We’re going to date for the foreseeable future.”
Draco placed his hands on the keys and did a passable job of producing something that resembled music but Harry could tell Viktor wasn’t happy with the attempt. Ron noticed Harry’s agitation and challenged Viktor to a chess match while Hermione sat on a couch and spoke softly with Pansy. Draco – no longer on display – got up and magically activated a music crystal before walking over to the couch where Harry was sitting. He sat next to Harry but left a good amount of space between them. They spoke about nonsensical things for a while – places they been, food they’d eaten, things they’d seen and done. Viktor barely won the chess match and quickly declared the night over. He directed Draco to see their guests to the floo and kissed Hermione’s cheek in farewell before disappearing from sight.
Harry nodded. “I know! It’s mental…right?”
"He's a Gryffindor!" Draco snapped.
“Found a gang-plank!” George shouted.
“I really meant no offense...” Harry grinned as Caelum grabbed the baby spoon that still had mushed peas clinging to it and began banging it on the tray of his highchair. This caused a small splatter of baby food to land on the older man’s cheek. “…and I don’t think your grandchildren will allow you to remain that way when they get a little older.”
Draco thanked his father and broached the next topic. "Oh, by the way, Potter thinks he's guessed our secret."
When students began trickling into the Great Hall on the morning of November first, the first thing they noticed was the new layout of the tables and seating. The house tables had shrunk to fit only the younger years and they stayed in keeping with tradition lined up near the stage-like area where the faculty table remained while two large round tables sat on either side of the doors.
“I like to be casual with the couples I council. Now then…” Starla began as she tied her golden blonde hair back into a ponytail. “I feel the need to apologize for my receptionist. When we were going over the cases I’d be seeing today, she divulged that your choice of marriage partner bothered her but I didn’t expect outright rudeness. It seems she had hoped you’d end up with your friend’s sister – a Miss Ginevra Weasley, now Thomas.”
Starla looked back and forth between them. “I’ll hear anything you’d feel comfortable telling me, Harry.”
He leaned down and kissed his son’s cheek before transforming again to fly down into the garden and land on the back of the chair beside his godson.
Harry nodded slowly as he absorbed what his friends were telling him. “What kinds of procedures?”
Harry hid a smirk while slipping Caelum’s shoes on and fastening them tightly. “Don’t whine. You’ll set a bad example for the babies.” Caelum giggled as Harry placed him into one side of a double occupant pram.
“How does that feel inside you?” Harry looked into the blond’s grey eyes and lowered himself to be closer to his submissive’s body.
Mid-September – the Malfoy-Potter twins are just about 2 months old
Harry opened his arms and leaned against the desk behind him. Draco stepped into them and pitched his head forward as Harry embraced him. Their lips met again with just as much passion as they'd shared before. This time Draco was clearly the driving force. He pulled Harry's head down toward him and kept the kiss going. The blonde didn't object when Harry pushed his hands into his hair again but when his arousal was obvious he pulled back from the brunette. "There was no reason to believe I'd go as far as full on sex for our first encounter, Harry." He said softly as he thrust his hips forward to rub against his new boyfriend. He kissed Harry again lightly and began to rub their clothed erections against each other. Harry moaned at the same time Draco did. They gripped each other tightly and began to kiss again while frotting. Suddenly Draco cried out and buried his face in Harry's neck. Harry wasn't far behind and they held each other until they calmed down.
“Oh, no... Its just six of us since Pansy will be there.” Draco started to turn away but stopped when Harry said his name.
Draco bit his lip and nodded.
I'm back! Life is still doing a number on me but I'm back in the swing of writing.
Harry sighed. At least Draco didn’t seem as depressed as he had earlier. Maybe more sex would cheer him up. He’d sneak the blond into their room after a few hours of being social and see if it helped.
Lucius grimaced and blinked rapidly as he sat up. "What was that? What's going on?"
“Thank you, Headmistress. That’s a welcome surprise.” Draco smiled. “I hope to visit with her often during our stay.”
Classes began for all students the day after Harry and Draco moved in. Flying lessons for the little firsties began that very afternoon and Harry still vividly recalled his own first lesson.
“It’s Salazar’s head.” Harry muttered to Blaise as he waited for his boyfriend’s reaction. “Draco ...are you going to say something?”
“You’re welcome.” Harry murmured. “Erm...I don’t think it’s unfounded...I mean, if you feel comfortable... You can call me Harry in private.”
“That is very likely.” Lucius’ lips curved slightly before straightening back into a thin line. “My suggestion put them in danger, and I find myself once again needing to apologize. I’m sorry for the worry I caused you and the pain I caused my son.”
“Older or not – with a muggle – not to mention being the Top – you would always have control and choice.” Starla commented, nodding with clear understanding. “So what happened there?”
“Draco, is Goyle joining us?” Harry asked his husband as he sat down next to him.
“You look amazing for having had twins a little over a month ago, and it will go away after a while, Dragon. A little exercise and a bit more flying…” Harry kissed the mark on his husband’s shoulder before beginning to rub him with his favorite bodywash. “Don’t you remember what I said last night?”
“Who’s the wolf one for, Harry?” Draco asked.
His mother gasped. “Oh Dragon, that’s perfect! I’ll invite all of your friends and we’ll have a true wedding reception for you!”
“And the basilisk is still there and well preserved?” Harry asked, shocked.
“There was an incident with him and his wife during the war. This was nothing more than his stress and frustration at his wife’s situation overwhelming him,” Harry met his father-in-law’s gaze head on. “He made a comment and I talked to him after getting Draco out of sight.”
"I'm sorry, I should've realized you wouldn't know." Draco smirked. "My godfather is Professor Snape."
“Yes, sir, Mr. Potter, sir.” She said shaking her head at Draco before snapping her fingers and popping out of sight.
Draco’s lips curved slightly and his hand brushed Harry’s as he murmured. “How romantic…”
Draco and Harry shared a look. They’d both heard the self-correction he’d made.
“Sorry, I guess at the time it didn’t really mean anything.” Harry shrugged before giving Teddy more cheerios.
"What should I do while you're at the bank?" Dudley asked as he got himself dressed and repacked his bag.
“That was something he did?” Sirius asked Korlag.
Lucius rolled his eyes discreetly but Narcissa smiled at the lack of sarcasm in her son’s comment. She’d seen Draco change during his relationship with Harry and knew it was all to the good. The boy she’d given birth to had lost his innocence a long time ago but Harry had managed to bring some of it back by loving him and protecting him.
"Well, when you rushed in and announced that the meeting had to be moved up, I knew whatever had riled you was important." She told him as they came to a stop. "Draco, to a certain extent, we've been quite strict with you but you're getting to the age where you need to have enough confidence in yourself to make choices and follow through on them."
Harry sighed. “I do need to tell you...I forgive you...for Tuesday.”
Harry carefully placed the stone puzzle piece where it belonged. It clicked into place, completing the capital letter H and Harry knew just what he needed to do.
The blond opened his eyes and pulled out the practice snitch they always used before climbing up onto his broom. “Ready?” He asked as he angled up to join Harry in the air.
“Well, it’s basically that pregnancies are very delicate and many of them don’t make it to full term. Of those that do...only sixty percent are magical children.” She explained carefully as she flipped to a particular page and pointed to a highlighted paragraph. “The magical community has decreased in numbers quite rapidly and a deliberate attack on a pregnant woman is bad enough. Causing intentional harm to a pregnant male is much worse. Men have a higher risk of miscarriage because nature didn’t intend for males to perform that particular task.”
“I’d hate it…and I’d moan and complain about it…but I’d do it. I’d take the potion.” Draco felt a tear roll down his cheek as he stood and turned around to face Harry. “I’d do it because being pregnant was an amazing experience and, even though it was just a dream last month, being separated from you and our babies isn’t something I’d risk happening… ever.”
Harry turned his attention toward his daughter and the snake before nodding. “Amice seems to have eavesdropped on the daily lessons I give the children. She appears to have understood my English and is teaching Lyra how to say the words she already knows in Parseltongue.”
Victoire Weasley was quite formidable and Teddy was a little nervous about it but he was certain he could convince her that he was right. “Now just hear me out, Vicki. Please?” He consciously made his hair change from brown to her favorite shade of lavender in an attempt to sooth her.
“Did you welcome the new law, Mr. Potter?”
At breakfast the next morning, Harry informed Draco that he and their fellow eighth year students had taken control of the Room of Requirement in order to give him a birthday party. This presented a slight dilemma as Draco didn’t know whether he should give Harry his surprise before or after the party. The decision was taken out of his hands when Harry hugged him after lunch and whisked him away to an alcove near the library.
“Dinki be thanking Master Lucius.” The elf’s eyes were wide as she bowed to him.
Sirius transformed into Snuffles and stood next to Harry while Remus and Dudley took up flanking positions a step behind them. As the group approached the door, it opened to reveal Korlag.
“Well, Viktor says that it’s healthier if I make my own lunch and bring it into the office.” Draco shrugged. “It also saves money so I usually only go out once a week and that was yesterday.”
“This would be why you missed Charms.” Blaise piped up.
Bold+italics =parseltongue
Tom snorted. “Draco calls me ‘Uncle’ but, since we are actually cousins, I suppose you might use ‘Tom’.”
They looked at each other and Harry suddenly pictured a small girl with his green eyes and wavy mess of hair but Draco’s coloring otherwise. The boy he saw in his mind would have Harry’s coloring but Draco’s features. Merlin! he thought, tenderly hugging his husband. I almost can’t wait for them to be born!
The well known pair also continued to study together and date. They got closer and closer as a result. Each Saturday became a courting gift day and Draco reciprocated every Sunday. For the second weeks’ gift, Harry gave Draco a picture and description of each house he owned and asked him to pick which one he’d like them to live in. If he wanted a house of their own instead, they could get a reliable real estate agent to help them find the right one for them. Draco’s second gift was a trip to a French designer’s studio where their wedding robes would be custom made especially for them. They each found out many new things about the other as well.
"My patronus is a white stag because my dad's animagus form was a stag." Harry explained gently. "Lily is my mother's name."
Teddy bit his lip. He knew Harry hadn’t answered his question but maybe he could talk to Uncle Draco or even Uncle Luc about it later.
“No! We just had twins, Harry! Surely we can get away with supporting it vocally instead of demonstrably.” Ginny exchanged glances with Katie.
Getting back to his feet, Harry ran a hand through his hair and smiled. This trip was already helping his state of mind by reminding him of the simpler times; when he’d just had himself and one other person to worry about. His eyes swept the room to take in every corner. They lingered on the bed and replayed some of the wonderful nights he’d shared with his Dragon in marital bliss. With a smile on his face, Harry left the room again and made his way through the maze of hallways.
Draco thought for a moment. “I’ve only just begun to, Father; but there are quite a few.”
Draco got it first. “Toads and chicken eggs... Oh Merlin! We have to get out of here!”
“Anyway, I’d like you all to give him a round of applause for his great work – not only on his grades but his future plans as well…” Harry started them off while Draco took a small bow of appreciation. “Our Draco will soon be studying Potions with Potions Master Loveday starting next week and is due to gain his own Mastery in just a few years.”
“Good.” Silverling smirked at them. “Lord Potter, life has dealt you a tragic hand. You’re doing your best to play it but, without an ace or a wild card, you’re sunk. As a former Gryffindor with a particular Hufflepuff cousin, I’m a big believer in honesty and fair play. My contacts might not be able to hand you the ace but hopefully they can slip you a wild card.” She held out her hand and waited for him to take it. “Oh, I'll also send along the appropriate paperwork that will allow Mr. Dursley to separate himself from his parents, but there are several requirements that must be fulfilled before your estate can claim him in his squib status as an acquired member."
The elder man nodded silently while his wife hugged her son before returning to her seat at his side. It was as if Lucius had something to say but didn’t think it wise to give the sentiment a voice.
2nd Pregnancy                                    May 2000 - March 7 2001                                          - Yasmin Mary
"A dangerous prank!" Harry snapped. "What if you slipped on the wet stone? What if you decided to try jumping to safety? You'd be a smear on the floor of the stairwell, Neville! A prank is mixing something in your shampoo to color it temporarily."
“Sirius?” Harry smirked.
Harry didn't like the idea of separating but he recognized the value of feeling out the opposition. "Alright, but I think we should meet back here in three hours."
The young brunette let Draco wipe his tears even as his green eyes met her blue ones. “I’ll convey your sympathies, Narcissa – thank you,” he whispered without loosening his grip on Draco who didn’t try to move from his position. He seemed to sense that Harry needed him close at hand. The longer they sat that way, the more right it felt.
“Really?” Blaise asked as he took the cup Ziva offered him as well as a sandwich.
"Yeah." Harry nodded but somehow his glare became darker. "I said yes and Ron burst out accusing me of usurping Fred's place in the family and taking advantage of their generosity."
"Thank you." Draco took a shuddering breath and tried to calm down. "He named her Suki, by the way."
"I have a month to conceive – damn it! I was hoping we would have a few weeks before I'd have to deal with things like cravings and mood swings!" Draco complained with a pouty sigh.
Narcissa glanced up from where she was watching Teddy and Caelum play.
Harry paced the floor as he waited for Draco and their daughter. His son and godson had run off with the other children as soon as they’d been set on the floor and all he wanted was the rest of his family in sight. His separation anxiety was worse than his one and a half year old childrens’. He got frustrated and forced himself to turn toward the door, but when the floo activated he completed the spin to see his lovely Dragon stepping out of the fireplace. Harry smiled until he realized that Draco had one hand over his mouth. Before the brunette could blink, he was handed his little girl and Draco was on his knees beside the nearest waste bin. Harry sighed and stood his daughter on her own two feet. Suddenly, Teddy came running up and took her hand as they both ran off at full speed leaving Harry to stare after them.
“He’s at St. Mungo’s with Penelope.” George answered grimly.
“What? No, Harry, no!” The blond protested. “I swear! I didn’t! I’ll let you see the memory to prove it, Harry... Please!”
“The children are ours, Dragon…not mine or yours individually. We will always share any knowledge we have with them. I won’t be monopolizing anything if you won’t.” Harry winked at the blond. “Well you can feel free to monopolize anything to do with Potions.”
He looked at them and smiled as he set the rucksack on the large sleigh bed. "Hello! I'm..."
"Please, call me Harry...but yes, Winky and Dobby joined my family in August." Harry nodded. "The Potter elves have welcomed them warmly along with the Ravenclaw elf, Roody."
Ron's jaw locked as Harry cast an accio for Neville's wand. When it landed in his palm, Harry gritted his teeth and handed it to his friend.
you keep making excuses for him?” Harry pulled the blond close and stroked the pale cheek that had already begun to bruise. "Forget that it’s morally wrong to abuse your spouse - it’s
"After the second dream, it was mostly structural integrity I was concerned about but I also found it strange that the stones seemed imbued with the house colors." Harry sighed. "It was disturbing to see them damaged and crumbling."
“And Moody really was our professor, right?” Draco’s eyebrow rose and he crossed his arms. “And Rita was doing her job ethically, was she? People don’t break their everyday promises?”
am in control of our relationship, Draco - make no mistake about that – and we will find what arouses you by trial and error or any other means we can… I don’t care about cost either…Am I understood?” She pinned him with a glare so intense that all he could do was nod again.
Harry’s fingertips settled on Draco’s sensitive nipples and began to pinch rhythmically.
Draco’s eyebrow rose in curiosity. “What am I right about?”
She sighed. “Alright. I really didn’t want to have another child so soon.”
He showed her his watch and told her about the matching bracelet that he’d given Victoire. “So I left...but I didn’t really.”
“Potter would never trust him.” Blaise scoffed.
"I suppose that instead of meeting here for our class assignments, we’ll need a table at the library twice a week.” Harry said, chillingly polite. “Please finish your meal and go. I seem to have lost my appetite and developed a headache, so I’ll be skipping Charms if it’s all the same to you.” The young lord felt cold and so he transferred that to his voice. “I’m sure Professor Flitwick will have spoken to Mcgonagall so the partnership should be settled. Shall we set days for our meetings when we hear about Quidditch?”
Chapter 1
Draco nodded.
“Like what?” Harry frowned in suspicion. “
"Draco led me and Ron right in." Harry nodded with a devilish grin.
His hand traveled down to check his pulse and as soon as he’d calmed a little he felt it – his pyjama bottoms were tight. He ran his hand over his cock – which he knew to be harder than granite – and moaned.
Harry frowned as his own cloak settled around him. “Like what?”
Startled, Kingsley seemed to understand that he’d unknowingly upset the young blond. “Draco, it was a particular condition that runs in her family that caused the miscarriage not anything else. Your situation is completely different.”
“Yes, sir; I promise you it is. I’ll take good care of him.” Harry patted Draco’s hand.
“So if we’d gotten back on time...” Fred began, glancing at his twin who picked the thought right up.
"It was granted and we've had quite a romantic week in Hogsmeade. We're getting along swimmingly. In fact, we are returning now with the news that my husband and I are indeed pregnant." Draco smiled.
“Definitely.” Hermione nodded decisively. “Let’s go. Ron and I will go through first.” She and Ron ducked back into the fireplace and threw the powder while speaking the address.
“Potter?” Draco called. “There’s another house symbol I think you missed.”
“I can do that level while pregnant, Harry. It’s one of the levels of my training that takes the longest and its split evenly between discussion and bookwork. Plus, I can even still brew some of the simpler potions that I’ll need to help me through the pregnancy.” Draco’s cheeks flushed with pleasure at the way Harry stared at him from the other side of the bed.
“No, it’s alright. You tell me why dreamwalking is important, first.” Harry encouraged.
Both men used their arms to hold tight to each other as the rhythm of their passion sped up. Harry soon took hold of Draco’s cock and began to stroke it.
“Silly Harry, we don’t need an elf. ” Draco reasoned eating a strawberry. “But it would be helpful anyway because we could move on with our shopping and leave the elf to wait for an item if it's not ready yet. I know that’s what Mummy and Father always do.”
“I guess that depends on where and with whom that someplace was...but I’d love to get away from the memories of his abuse.” She sighed and turned to speak with the aurors as the beginnings of a bruise blossomed on her left cheek.
The blond licked his lips before sinking back into Harry’s arms. “Good morning, love.” He whispered.
“I’ll always give you what you need,” Harry bent to gently kiss his husband’s lips. “Now let’s get dressed for a nice leisurely flight. The Seeker’s Game can wait until our brooms are broken in.”
“He was going to ask me out?” Draco whispered in shock.
They hugged a little more and then rejoined the others where Andromeda apologized for upsetting Harry. The brunette waved her off and just explained how strange it was to see his old friends in miniature right in front of him again. He went on to tell her how amazing it was that she could teach him how to use powers that she didn’t have herself.
Between the births of the children, Harry had gone through Auror training with his friend Ron Weasley and Draco gained a mastery of both Arithmancy and Potions. Astoria took her cues from Narcissa who was a bit of a social butterfly. She joined several charity committees and attended benefit galas while Ginny only joined one charity so she’d be free to take care of her own children rather than hire one of the Elf agencies to do it for her.
Harry read it to himself, “It’s from the Weasleys. They’re thanking your parents for their sentiments and congratulating them on their growing family.”
Harry nodded. “I’d like you guys to look in Gryffindor for something like that. Luna, you too in Ravenclaw."
“Apa?” said a little voice that distracted Harry from the look in Draco’s eyes.
Harry snorted. He was amused that Draco’s attitude about ‘the ferret incident’ had changed so dramatically.
"There was something I needed to attend to in my room, Mione." Harry smirked and conjured a spelled rosebud, handing it to Draco.
“If I’d gotten my wishes, Draco, then my parents and so many other people would still be here and if they were here Voldemort may never have been defeated and we’d never be having this conversation.” Harry stopped and faced him. “I may miss some important people, but I like where I am now. This outcome is the one we have and if we got caught up in wishes and dreams we wouldn’t really be living our lives.”
Draco did indeed send his dirtiest glare Harry’s way even as the snitch struggled to escape his hand. He opened his hand, one finger at a time until the tiny gold ball fluttered free. It seemed to look at each of them in turn before zipping away to begin the game.
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Harry felt his jaw clench at the mocking tone and use of air quotes.
Lucius seemed to lose some of his tension as soon as Harry finished speaking.
“Lyra, when you want me to come to you, I want you to say ‘please come, Papa’. Can you do that?” Harry asked without moving.
When it appeared that his best friend had talked herself out of things to say, Harry smiled and hugged her and promised to think things over. Then, he saw her to the door and wondered what to do with the rest of his day.
After Harry had healed his spouse's bruised nipples, the day after the party was very relaxing.
"Night, Dudley." Harry grinned. "Goodnight, Padfoot...Moony."
"It is." Draco told them grimly.
"All of those sound wonderful, Draco." She grinned. "What are you getting Blaise? There's only a couple more weeks until Christmas and I haven't a clue what he'd like."
Harry frowned. "I didn't receive a reply of any kind. I guess Dumbledore has her loyalty... at least until we can talk to her and convince her otherwise."
“Bring me the dagger I found in Gryffindor’s quarters, please.” Harry told him firmly.
There was silence for a moment as Draco decided whether to answer his husband.
“In my early school years I wouldn’t have predicted loving Draco as I do now…” Harry smiled at his friends. “The thought of having Lucius Malfoy as a close family member would’ve had me laughing myself silly and, if I’d even said something similar to Ron or Hermione, they would’ve had me committed to the Janus Thickey ward at St. Mungo’s.”
~oOo~
"This is what you and Severus settled earlier; yes?" Tom smirked.
Draco stared at Harry. “Many people through the centuries have tried and failed to guess our secret.”
"Our crups are born here and have never been introduced to muggles or wizards. They receive wonderful care and firm training from the faculty as well as the students taking the course." Vera told him matter of factly.
“Months, Headmistress…not weeks. I’ve been thinking of asking Draco out – of dating him – since the end of the war. I knew we were all coming back for this school year and I couldn’t deny that I’d have my work cut out for me if I really wanted to be with him.” Harry said just loudly enough so Draco could hear him from across the room. “I had to decide one way or the other if I’d take that chance and approach him. A week or so after my birthday, I saw several couples I know talking and laughing together…I wanted that. I also recalled those same couples crying together over loss and hardship. I remember wanting a pair of arms to hold me when I watched my friends being buried after the war. Whenever I think of that…well lately, I think of only one pair of arms… I also think of seeing certain people at other burials and wishing I could just wrap my arms around them.”
Draco gasped but obeyed the order quickly unbuttoning his pale grey shirt before moving on to his tight black trousers.
“She is well, Draco.” The older man smiled as he looked around the table. “She’s due to assist our goddaughter in the birthing room in less than two weeks.”
Lucius cleared his throat and cast Sonorus. “Mr. Potter was indisposed. He’s better now, and the wedding will go on as planned. He will be joining us in just a moment.”
“It’s yours, Master.” The blond gasped.
Draco whimpered, “Y-Yours to mark if y-you wish, Master! Please!”
“Harry, listen…I sort of forgot to say it this morning…” Ron scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “We can’t meet up tonight. Mione’s friend invited us out for dinner and…well tonight’s the only night he and his partner are free so…”
Chapter 2 will be up in a few days!
**************************************************************************
Draco gaped at his husband until the baby girl in his arms joined into the act.
“Don’t worry; she’s not here. It’s under new management.” He let Draco choose a table and went up to the counter to order. When Harry came back he was very quiet. “Do you have any specific questions? They might help me figure out where to start.”
His aunt smiled as she sat in the love seat next to his chair. "Alright, nephew…so tell me how married life has been for you?"
Harry, having only heard Draco this way a few times, quickly dropped the book he'd just taken from the library shelf and took off running.
August was filled to the brim with birthday party invitations and Draco insisted that they attend as many as possible while still leaving enough time for his studies but between August and September the blond fell behind.
The older man went into the back room and came out with three black trunks with bronze fittings. He opened one and drew his wand. "Here's a six compartment trunk. I'll charm the interior to the chosen colors now." A wave of his wand had the white interior changing colors to a pleasant blue with a yellow stripe on a diagonal.
“I see...” Harry paused to regain his train of thought. “And at that point I saw through your wards and you were sunbathing next to your pool..."
When they'd first met, Harry had been put off by Malfoy's attitude about the house system at Hogwarts. Not only had he been arrogant and condescending, but then he’d proceeded to make fun of Hagrid - the only magical person Harry had ever met - the only person in recent memory who’d ever been kind to him. Their second meeting hadn’t gone any better because Draco had offended Ron Weasley - the second friend Harry had ever had. Harry’s opinion of Malfoy had only gone downhill from there and he never thought it would rebound but due to the night of the third task of the tournament, Harry was considering clearing the slate between them.
Hearing a strange noise he looked around. From afar he spied long lush red hair and knew instantly that it was his wife, Ginny. He called out her name and rushed after her but she didn’t notice him as she dashed between the trees. Suddenly, they ran out of the trees and into a neighborhood that seemed similar to his own. Ginny was still running and she came to a house whose door was open. Without hesitation, she hurried through the door and it closed behind her.
“What?” Zack asked with a frown. “Why?”
Chapter 25
Draco had no doubt of what activity was planned to happen behind the closed doors of that suite and he couldn’t wait.
“No. Just stop in, say hi and I’ll be ready to go.” Draco kissed the brunette on the cheek and grabbed his fleecy blanket before joining Harry at the door. At Harry’s worried frown, he commented. “I was chilled sitting in their rooms last night so I’m bringing this today. Relax, I’ll be fine.”
Draco kept his head down until he bumped into Harry’s leg. Being that Harry wanted him to act the role he might as well start now, so he rubbed his head against the other man’s thigh until Harry pulled him to his feet.
Hermione gasped. “All of Hogwarts knows before Molly?”
"Father?" Draco asked, just as surprised.
"Harry." He said with a smirk. "If you're going to be my boyfriend, you'll have to call me Harry."
"Yes, but it's muggle and it's a gay bar. I didn't think that was your thing." Harry raised one eyebrow.
"Sword?" Blaise echoed, sounding mildly alarmed.
The congratulations were echoed by the others as Harry walked through the hallway towards the office where he would continue briefing them on his situation. "Draco needs to hear the rest of our conversation so give me just a second." He opened the door and wasn't surprised to see that the blond was in his chair. Harry grinned as he picked up a chair and put it beside the one Draco occupied. "I have a communication mirror and my cousin, godfather, and uncle are on the other side. I told them we're dating. Now they need to know about some of the other things that are happening."
“Did you badmouth me, Draco? Did you tell her I was being mean to you or something?” Harry asked distrustfully.
Harry fought a laugh but quickly lost.
“That was lovely, Lyra.” Smiling, Harry nodded happily as he answered her in kind before switching back to English. “This lesson is over for now. Go back to Daddy and Grandma.” She began to push herself up onto her hands and knees and when she had crawled about half the distance, Harry turned to the snake. “Draco needs something from you, Amice.”
“Yes… Good! You’re so good, Dragon!” Harry told him softly as he bent to wrap his arms around the writhing blond. “I want to hear you, love…talk to me…beg for your pleasure.”
Draco appeared again as he crumbled the red rose in his hands. “You’re a bloody disappointment as a husband, Potter.”
Harry nodded. "One of us will write you after he takes it."
"The seventh year curriculum has contained the ancestry potion since I was a student, Potter." Snape sighed. "It's a sufficiently challenging potion for a young wizard or witch who is close to their NEWT tests. The ingredients aren't expensive or difficult to find so I didn't think anything of it when my sample was stolen that year."
Speaking of crimes, his godfather had endured a great miscarriage of justice and the ministry needed to make up for the horrendous wrong they’d committed against a lord of the magical realm. He could hardly believe that Barty Crouch Sr. had thrown a Lord into Azkaban. Then he realized that at the time Sirius had only been a lord’s heir but his father’s title should’ve warranted a trial for him at least.
Draco nodded. "I've been seeing a mind healer as part of my sentence. It helps."
Harry kissed his husband thoroughly. He explored every inch of Draco’s delectable mouth several times before breaking for air and turning the blond around. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s torso and ran his fingers over the planes of this stomach before cupping the man’s pectorals.
Harry chuckled and pulled his husband toward their bedroom. "Come on, love. Come to bed with me..."
“My friends just know some brilliant charms.” Harry smirked. “Ron also gave me a few pointers for dealing with your parents. So…do you trust me?”
She snapped her fingers and suddenly he had two matching sofas in a soft champagne color. "You put in place, Dobby. Ziva will work on armchairs."
Not just corporeal, the Patronus was bright and beautiful. The Peregrine Falcon landed on the railing of the balcony and spoke with Draco’s voice. “I passed! I passed! I’m coming home now but I couldn’t wait to tell you I passed and I matched Hermione with the number of NEWTs!”
"The queue was going a bit slow. Michelle was whining and you know how she can get when deprived of caffeine." Harry lightly scrubbed his face. "I went to see what was happening and when I saw him... well, I left before he saw me. I didn't want him to think I was stalking him or playing games."
Regardless of the early hour when the lady of the house arrived, she was beautifully dressed and there was not a hair on her head that was out of place. She hurried over to her son and bent to hold a whispered conversation. “Mother? Could you cast the spell for us?”
“It’s also useful to gather ingredients from the garden, apparently.” Draco smirked.
Dobby sighed heavily upon seeing the glowing book and his former master lying on the floor. "Master Merlin, what is you doing? Dobby is now having to get Master Harry's betrothed to be helping his father!"
“What about Hufflepuff?” Draco asked.
“Look, Draco, just because I don’t flaunt it with a brand new wardrobe and flashy frivolities doesn’t mean it’s not there.” Harry explained. “I can detail things for you when we’re married or even before, if you’d like. I really can afford to provide a comfortable life for us.”
Voldemort sighed but understood. “Very well, how are things going?”
“No need.” Lucius spoke from the doorway.
"No," said Harry. "But they don't know that and it sounded less like a tryst when I said 'office'. Didn't it?"
They entered Gringotts with minimal fuss and Harry approached the nearest counter. "Hello, my name is Harry Potter. I'm looking for Korlag."
Draco's eyes widened as he watched Harry slowly approach but he said nothing as their lips locked. His eyes widened and then closed as he felt Harry's tongue rub lightly against his. He heard a moan but wasn't sure whose.
“We saw him quite a few times while visiting Pansy.” Draco shuddered delicately. “It wasn’t pretty.”
Harry’s eyes closed as he nodded and soon he felt Draco’s mouth close over his cock. He gave into the sensations and began to stroke his lover’s hair. The warmth and wetness soon became too much and Harry gripped Draco’s braid as he emptied himself into the blond’s mouth.
“Well, I just wanted to help…Even though you’re not with Ginny, you are still family, you know.” Ron said blushing.
“And I’ve heard your husband is studying to be a potions Master.” The solicitor frowned. “That’s a difficult line of study – not usually one taken by the carrying partner.”
“Being quiet and avoiding the subject is more stressful – not less. I loved Andy too, Harry.” His silver eyes were filled with unshed tears. “I miss her too. Our grief over her loss is a burden we all bear and talking about it – sharing that grief – is what lessens the burden while keeping it to ourselves only makes it heavier.”
The sweet little elf nodded once. "Ziva will be bringing milk and sugar for Mister Moony and lemon for Master and Lord Sirius. Who is being the other boy, Master Harry?"
“You have me now, Harry. Ron’s mum and dad can be your parental figures and Ron, Hermione and his siblings can be your brothers and sisters...but I’m going to be your spouse – your husband. You have me now, and I want what you spoke about that day. I want to fight the daily battles – side by side. I want to be the arms you crave for comfort as well as carnal pursuits.” Draco told him without embarrassment. “You can’t be strong all the time…and I’ll be here for you when you’re not...I promise.”
"So as toddlers, we played together." Harry said with a smirk.
The pregnant man huffed and rolled his eyes. “We’re safe from the papers because of me, Harry. We’re safe from investigation because of our honesty in speaking to the healer.”
“Wonderful! Is there anything either of you will need for the day?” She asked graciously glancing up at the bedroom area to catch a glimpse of her son.
“Draco missed the twins’ presentation to the elves entirely and…” Harry sighed heavily. “You didn’t see how deeply disappointed he was when I showed it to him in the pensieve! No! I won’t let this be taken from him again!”
“I thought you said I could tell him, Ronald!” Hermione’s lip trembled as she burst into tears.
“But didn’t you hate each other for the last several years?” Rita yelled out.
Ginny paced a few times before facing him again. “I don’t know if you’d noticed but I had a bit of a thing for you over the last few years.”
“Should I go talk to him?” Harry asked, starting to stand.
“She’s my goddaughter. I should be around to play with her more and maybe this wouldn’t have happened.” Harry sighed. “That’s the gift we’ll bring them on the day their son is born.”
"Mcgonagall wanted to ask me a few things after we got done talking about the class partnerships." Harry told him, ticking his fingers as he answered each of the questions.  "Malfoy ran because he was embarrassed about something. I'm happy because things seem to be going well."
"Actually I was thinking about the puzzle pieces and the crumbling... but, yes, I suppose that could be something to look into, Harry." Dumbledore frowned.
“Good.” Neville sighed as he turned to Harry. “It took her so long to get to sleep before that we knew we’d need the spell to take her through.”
Harry said.
Draco looked to be suppressing a chuckle as he shook his head. “Not with me, Harry.”
“Lucius and Narcissa approve of this?” Harry asked raking a hand through his already messy hair. “I mean, you’re practically…”
The stag bowed its head and ran through the wall.
"Your cock, my lovely dragon... I still want that...Your cock will be in my mouth very soon, and I won't remove it until you cum for me..." Harry whispered, kissing Draco's throat.
"What date were you thinking of, Harry? Halloween is the last day the law will allow the marriages to take place." Kingsley looked worried.
Narcissa gave him a sad smile.
Her parents had been incredibly strict this summer. When she'd asked why, they said things like 'they were worried for her safety' and 'the wizarding world is so full of danger'.
“I meant something quiet and helpful, like a kneazle or an owl,” Lucius glowered at Draco’s mother.
They all nodded and hurried back to their posts just in time for Sirius to burst into the front hall.
Just as she finished the sentence, they heard a screech from Lyra. As she’d begun running across the room, her foot got caught on a rug and she’d fallen. Harry gasped and took two steps but Draco was awake and by her side in an instant to scoop her up. “You’re alright, Lyra…shhh…just a little fall…Harry is the bruise cream nearby?”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry. It’s called accidental magic for a reason.” Draco narrowed his eyes at his husband’s teasing and tucked one stray piece behind his ear. “Nobody really knows why it happens.”
Harry’s eyes widened. “Well, I hope you told him I want to catch up with you both sometime. He was good competition in the tournament and I never held it against him that he was unable to throw off the Imperius curse.”
“What he needs…” Lucius narrowed his gaze. “Is to feel that his grandmother’s passing isn’t the end of the world as he knows it.”
“We…” Draco bit his lip as he interrupted quietly. “We don’t want to hear you talk like that.”
“That’s a bit of a story, Harry.” She said with a mysterious smile as she crooked a finger at him. “Tea is just about ready.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and began to sway back and forth. "I like this."
“Oh?” Harry frowned curiously.
Luna and Ginny were taken to Helena's suite which had two bedrooms with a shared bathroom and sitting room. Remus and Sirius were given Warin's suite. Dudley and the twins were led to guest rooms on the same floor as the others but as Harry was waiting for his turn he checked on Sigmund.
“All I told them was that you were getting a divorce, and I heard that from Teddy. I didn’t tell them to make a spectacle of it.” She had the grace to blush. “And if you were as close as Teddy said you were after seeing that kiss then I knew you’d call him and things would progress.”
They waited and watched as a wisp of cloud began to take form above the blond's belly. Harry grinned seeing the pale pink color.
“Since we’re still in school, you could have study dates.” Hermione suggested. “Obviously there are also Hogsmeade visits…and we’re in eighth year so you can do that any weekend you like.”
Lucius sighed sentimentally as it closed behind her. His wife always knew what he needed to hear and that gave him an idea to look into his own ledgers.
Sirius walked over to him and touched his shoulder lightly. "I know. I'll be back." He winked at his lover and aparated out.
Harry was pleased that Draco cared enough about the plans they made with each other to make a calendar for them. "I'm glad…" He grinned at his husband. "Is there anything else I need to know about for the week, love?"
Altaira gasped. “There! The light is in his eyes!”
Harry patted his husband’s hand. “Calm down, Dray. The elves will get it for you. Dinki, you’ll get Master Draco his apple sauce, won’t you?”
Draco nodded already thinking about the possible items Harry could make him wear.
As Potter stormed out of the great hall, Draco looked at his two closest friends whom he was currently seated between. "We need to talk."
“The wizengamut doesn’t have enough money for that!” Harry protested. “They’d have to hold fundraisers and benefits or raise taxes for that to work!”
/*/*/*/*/*
Dobby's eyes glowed with interest as he listened to Harry's concerns. "Dobby can do this, Harry Potter, sir. Dobby can keep Harry Potter's secrets and pretend he likes Headmaster Dumbles."
Harry stopped and looked around.
“Not exactly.” Lucius shrugged elegantly. “It was kept on display in a secret room which I visited every day so that when the spell activated, I would know. At that time, however, the ministry was performing raids looking for dark artifacts. At first it was enough that the room was secret, but then one of our main allies told me that the aurors had found a hidden room at their manor. I had no choice but to get rid of it.”
Harry watched his godfather approach the damaged hedge and pull the branches apart before he grinned.
Draco nodded shyly. "They're my favorite fruit ...apples."
Draco looked up at him.
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
"Another student." Harry said, keeping his cards close to his chest.
Harry grinned and nuzzled his lover's neck. "That feels good, doesn't it?" He asked softly.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Alright. Fire whiskey?"
Harry finished his water and went back in to check on his beloved. He lay down next to the blond and placed his head on Draco’s chest. He could hear his heartbeat and it made him smile.
“It wasn’t anyone’s fault, Lucius.” Harry told him softly.
"There's just the one minor concern..." Harry glanced sideways at the blond. "When you say you've kept everything up to code, I want to believe you but I've been thinking about my conversation with Scorpius and if the floor of the sitting room is actually lava..." Draco's eyes narrowed as he refocused his sharp glare at Harry who shrugged. "Well, I don't think I need to spell it out. It's a pretty serious safety violation in that case, Mr. Malfoy."
“I guess you should get over here, then, young man.” Andromeda narrowed her gaze at Harry. When he calmed down and went to stand in front of her, the older woman looked him up and down. “You be good to my nephew, Harry.”
“His name is Cormac, Harry; Cormac McLaggen.” Luna told them. “Hermione went to Professor Slughorn’s Christmas party with him the time you and I went as friends, remember?”
Remus smiled. "Yes. James never got the hang of it though she tried to teach him."
"Are you certain?" Olgok winked and ran out into the hallway, closing the door.
“Good ideas; all.” Blaise smirked. “Especially the brooms...He’ll love that when he’s allowed to fly again.”
Draco nodded sadly. "I know. That's why we both need to be on the same page."
"Anyway, next thing I knew dementors were attacking me and my cousin. I saved us from them, but then my relatives kicked me out, thinking I'd used magic on my cousin. He took offense on my behalf and asked to join me, so I took him with me to Diagon Alley and the bank." Harry went on. "The goblins told me that my magical guardian had refused to bring me in, so I told them I had no clue who this 'guardian' was but he wasn't doing a very good job. After informing me that Albus Dumbledore was the guardian in question, they performed several tests during which they found my ancestry and verified the four baronies that I was entitled to claim along with my cousin’s squib status."
“Yes, Ron. We know.” Harry chuckled as the lift stopped. “Come on, Mione will be waiting with dinner.”
“Don’t leave out the ‘L’, Sweetie.” Harry smirked and repeated the word over. “Plant. La-la-la… Plant. Ok?”
"I've included the memory from the other day, as well." Harry placed his memory into the vial and handed it to Lucius who strode out of the room.
Ron nodded slowly as he thought things over. “What’s in the highland loches?”
"Let's take this to my study." Lucius stood and led the way.
Draco was shocked to see a small camp set-up inside the dilapidated shack.
“He’s not as fond of the headmaster as you think.” Draco confided. "It seems he took Uncle Tom's words into consideration."
“You’ll do as I tell you…” Harry’s voice had deepened with his lust.
“I do love you, Draco.” Harry whispered.
Harry chuckled and motioned for Draco to get on with it.
“If you sit, I’ll let you hold one at a time,” Harry motioned with his head toward the smaller sofa. “Molly, would you tell George and Charlie to come in with their spouses? This room is big enough for all of us as long as a few keep going in and out.”
He thought over the day’s events as he pondered whether to call back or not. The girl's coy smile was cute but he hadn't felt that spark of attraction while interacting that morning. He was quite flattered to receive the note and had gotten a bit excited when Dean...
Alicia Spinnet and Ernest(Ernie) Macmillan  October 1998 - July 1 1999                              - Jane Aster
"What am I missing?" Draco asked.
Harry sighed but agreed and went out to the pitch.
"No, I want to see him." She pouted and arched her neck to see around the people in front of them. "Maybe I'll flirt with him; find out which way he swings."
"What?" Draco blinked at him.
Draco thought back to the day he’d received his letter from the Ministry. “No, Harry…” Harry frowned letting his disappointment show and began to apologize but Draco cut him off with a hand over his mouth. “I got more than I ever hoped for.”
As she took Harry’s place, Lucius handed his son-in-law the book on the running of retail businesses that he’d dropped in the library. “I know you were probably going to go back for that later, so I thought to save you the trip.”
“She was lovely. I guess Tanis has her hair. The dirty blond is just a shade off of her golden curls,” she said, looking over at the baby.
A flick of the wand shrunk their luggage again and they left the room in search of breakfast.
She waved him away while continuing to speak with the Healer, but Harry hurried to his side. The younger man was a bundle of nervous happiness as he divulged the news. “Draco’s pregnant again. Narcissa cast the spell for us at dawn.” He described the cloud of silvery pink and instant bout of sickness and went on to tell how they’d called the Healer so she could recommend any potions.
Picking up their son, Draco turned to face his husband. A slight glance at their fussing daughter brought a smile to his face. “I suppose you’re correct, love. Just remember that when you turn around.”
Harry felt his heart ache as he looked as the woman who had come to mean so much to him and his family. He would miss her very much if something happened to her. “Thank you, Andy. You’re so sweet to do that for us.”
"Then you've met him?" Dudley asked.
“Master Lucius has a silver hair tie with the Malfoy crest engraved on it. I’d like it, please. It should be in the trinket box on his dresser.” She instructed. When the elf had popped back out to retrieve the item, Narcissa explained that she’d gotten it for her husband on their first wedding anniversary. “I’ll order you one tomorrow and we’ll call it a late Christmas gift.”
"Maybe they thought we'd wait too long… Maybe they thought you'd be too scared to take the potion right away and we'd need to conceive in a hurry." Harry suggested giving his in-laws the benefit of the doubt.
Harry nodded.
Draco and Harry tried to hide their amusement but knew they were caught when Luna turned her knowing gaze upon them.
“Only one other privilege was granted,” Harry disclosed. “Ours will be the only ceremony in the whole wizarding world to take place on October thirty-first.”
Lucius agreed grudgingly and quickly moved into a portable miniature frame which Harry picked up and carried with him.
He bit his lip as he held the basin for Draco again and thought to himself. Maybe the smoothness of the pregnancy is in direct opposition to the temperament of the child? Gods, I hope so. I’ll have to ask some of the others.
Just a moment after he poured the hot chocolate into the mugs, the floo activated and Harry heard Draco's voice.
Draco sipped the hot chocolate and sighed, looking out at the pouring rain. "Ok. This isn't so bad."
“Nothing really…” He walked down the hall into the kitchen, opened a cabinet and retrieved a glass. He filled it with an Aguamenti before sitting on the nearest chair. “I just wanted to know what happened after I left earlier.”
Draco allowed himself a smile as he hugged his mother and then hesitantly faced his father. “Thank you for that, Father. It means alot... to both of us.”
Harry sighed but agreed and turned to Lucius with a searching look. He too seemed to see that Lucius was stunned by the memories. "I am happy to see that the memories have had an effect on you."
Harry accepted this and held back but he was truly chomping at the bit so he sat down and called Dobby for some tea.
Harry was already there and Draco grinned thinking of the last time they'd seen each other. The kisses they'd shared had been so sweet. The letters they'd exchanged after the kisses had been almost as sweet.
Through the rest of the meal, they tried to make him tell but he kept quiet. As he ate the roast turkey he wished it was the chicken marsala he hadn't finished earlier.
Draco nodded silently as Harry led the way to the door. There was nobody in the lobby so they ignored the secretary and made their way to the lift.
Harry laughed at the blond’s expression.
“Not at all. I’m actually impressed that you’re still so modest and shy about this.” Marcus stopped at a painting of a boy in Quidditch gear and whispered his password. “You are, after all, a Slytherin who is married to the goody-est goody-goody Gryffindork of them all.”
Harry’s smile blinded Draco. “May I kiss you?”
“There’s a lot you don’t know about me, Draco. I’d like to be romantic about this whole thing… but the Ministry was very clear.” Harry said sadly. “I’ll get my choice of spouse but no further exceptions will be made for me. I’ll have to meet the same deadlines as everyone else. My friends are lucky that they match the requirements and had such a prominent role in the war or else they’d be split up.”
Ron sighed and shrugged helplessly before following her.
Zack nodded.
Still stretched from the night before, Harry only needed a small amount of lube but he rubbed it in liberally anyway before bringing his cock to press into Draco’s opening.
"Slytherin traits...overlap with Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff." Sirius pointed out. "Determination is another way of saying tenacity. Intelligence and wit are among their values as well, and they contribute to the idea of being cunning."
Harry waited another thirty seconds before he reached out a hand toward the door and a rush of air slammed it closed.
“Shhh…” Harry whispered. “Deep breaths, Dragon; it’s okay…just relax…you’re safe. It was just a dream.”
Harry laughed but agreed and then bent to kiss his lover before going off to dress properly for meeting his boyfriend’s family.
“Viktor is a good friend of mine Harry. We lost touch for a short while during the war, but he was at Bill and Fleur’s wedding and she’s just given me his new contact information so we’ve reconnected.” Hermione told him sharply. “Now that he’s dating Malfoy, he’s decided that we should occasionally double date. Last night was lovely and Malfoy was very different…He was quiet and polite.”
“I apologise, Lady Malfoy." Harry smirked. "I should’ve recalled from previous interactions with Slytherins that the setting can have an effect on the conversing parties.”
“Did you just call her…?” Blaise gaped at Harry.
Harry’s breath hitched as he watched Draco’s cheeks slowly grow pink. He couldn’t believe Draco Malfoy had a bit of a kink for humiliation. Harry wasn’t a hypocrite, so he wouldn’t say anything against the practice. It seemed to be something they had in common.
Moments later Harry was stepping out of the floo and into his lover’s arms. “How are you, Love?”
"Five!" Draco snapped. "There's five creatures that I could possibly have the powers of because of my ancestry."
"Thanks, Kingsley." Harry beamed and said goodbye before running to meet Draco at his class.
“Haven’t you noticed the roses we’ve been wearing?” The blonde asked fingering the one on his lapel.
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Draco’s eyes found Hermione’s face and he blushed when she met his gaze. “Why don’t we just slip into our room for a quick tryst while the others are occupied? Dinki can be our eyes on the children while we’re…busy.”
“Good, then I forgive you.” The brunette whispered into Draco’s hair.
“Don’t you leave school grounds alone?” Draco countered. “Don’t you…?” He trailed off, at a loss.
“H-Harry?” Draco whimpered softly. He was getting as embarrassed as he was aroused. “We’re not alone yet, Love.”
As they ate, the matter of Draco’s situation weighed heavily on Harry’s mind. He skipped the pudding course and proceeded home to floo-call the man in question. He threw the powder and stuck his head into the fire. He was met by a house elf who rushed to find Draco.
Harry blinked. Scorpius sounded like something out of a sci-fi novel. Honestly it kind of reminded him of Sirius' family naming tradition. He checked his watch and noted that he had some time to kill so he slipped off his shoes and stepped lightly from pillow to pillow until he was sitting on the armchair next to the couch. He looked over at the blond boy for approval and received a quiet nod as he picked up his picture book and began to turn the pages.
“How is this my fault?” Draco asked; the outrage in his voice clearly audible. “All I told Mummy in the letter I wrote after breakfast was that we’d be doing some shopping this afternoon. I didn’t say anything about elves.” It was a total lie. In actuality, he’d begged his mother to send his favorite elf to help them shop. If Harry called him on it, he’d have to tell the truth. He nervously wondered how Harry would punish him for it.
"What are you smiling about?" Draco grouched at him after exiting the shower.
Astoria smirked, “Not in public though, Harry.”
Draco chuckled, “Yes, you did. I should’ve expected since the zinnia are in bloom.”
Draco spoke to them as if they were little people instead of babies. It was one of the things they’d decided on a long time ago because Harry hadn’t liked the way Professor Umbridge acted toward himself and the other students. They still used small and inexplicit words but there was no high pitched voice and no condescension even though the twins were only ten months old rather than years older.
“I don’t know. I thought you knew almost everything about me.” Harry looked at the blond for a moment before getting the kettle and filling it with water. “There was this one New Years…We celebrated at the Weasleys’ and Ginny was across the room at midnight. She jokingly said that James was to be her New Years kiss, so I – being a bit drunk – grabbed my brother-in-law Charlie and planted one on him.”
“Well, that’s easy to fix!” Lucius frowned as he turned to look at the portrait frame beside the chaise lounge. “Severus? Do join us, won’t you?”
“Yes, but his hair is as straight and coarse as mine where hers was soft and full of life. Unfortunately, he’s got my boring brown eyes instead of her pale blue ones,” Marcus sighed. “So anyway, why don’t you write down your schedules and we can figure out when you can each babysit.”
The elderly goblin only smiled in the direction of the door.
Harry dressed quickly and hurried to meet Dudley and Remus at the floo. "Ready when you are, Moony."
Draco grinned and simply reminded his husband of their trip into the city later that day. “I’m glad they’re being so affable, Harry. It’ll make life easier for all of us if our families get along.”
"Indeed we do." Draco chuckled. "Though my connection is closer than yours."
As they arrived at the coffee shop, Harry reached out and opened the door. "Let's get our drinks and sit down. Look, there's a booth open."
The other man’s rant had Draco blushing and speechless but Harry just kept going.
“What happened after that?” Blaise prompted. Now that they’d reached the point Teddy had stopped he wanted to know where they’d gone after this point.
Harry bit his lip. “I was hoping you wouldn’t ask me that…”
"Actually..." Draco hesitated. "I know better than that. Blood purity is just a rhetoric that a few of my family's more powerful allies truly believe and we have a reputation to live up to. Until I had a closer relationship with you, I was obligated to act that way."
Pansy sighed at the sentiment. "Oh, honey, you always have been a closet romantic." She reached out to hug him. "C'mon let's get to class."
His fiancé looked up at him. “That sounds ominous…what is it, Harry? Can’t I eat while you talk?”
"I'll give it a go." Harry said politely as he stepped up to the portrait. "Gwaed a hud."
To Draco, November was a blur of potions ingredient preparations and essays that explained which ingredients could be prepared in which ways and why some were of better use if prepared in one particular way compared to other ways. Now properly focused, the blond was able to catch up quickly. He passed the test for the end of the fifth level before the end of November allowing the sixth to begin at once on December first.
“Show me?” Draco murmured into his husband’s ear, his legs wrapping around Harry’s waist.
Harry lined himself up and pushed into his warm body.
Pansy gasped as the little one crawled in Harry’s direction while changing his hair and eyes to match the man who waited for him.
"As I started this, I might as well continue. We've each done crazy things...horrible things to each other..." Harry kept his eyes focused solidly on Malfoy's face as he spoke. "For my part, I want you to know that I'm incredibly sorry for most of it."
Harry snorted lightly upon seeing that the words 'no' and 'deny' were in bold – as if that would influence the letter's recipient to choose those boxes.
There will be a sequel but I'm not sure when.
They sat like that for another few minutes before Harry reminded him that they should get back to their apartment to sleep in their own bed. He gave Draco a box of Swiss chocolates before they got into bed and slept peacefully.
Harry nodded crisply and turned to leave. He was gratified to find that Draco was waiting at the doors.
Draco nodded happily, “Have you enlarged the brooms yet?”
Draco glared as he brought the glass to his lips. “Not fair!”
Draco glared and stuck out his tongue but then he sighed while putting on his own clothing. “I think I’ll read with Mother in the sitting room. You can join us for tea and hot chocolate when you’re through outside.” He picked up a novel, shrunk it and placed it in his pocket as Dinki buckled Lyra into the pram and allowed Harry to take control.
Draco sighed heavily but straightened up just in time to see Harry Potter walking in their direction. His breath caught in his throat so he took a sip of water.
“Play something for us, Draco.” The larger man commanded.
Harry's eyes widened but he didn't know what surprised him more, Dudley studying voluntarily or the twins entertaining Remus without knowing a few key details. Stepping into the kitchen, Harry cleared his throat to announce himself. "Molly?"
He ended up hopping across the lawn until he got to the steps that led into the house. Deciding he’d do better with a little bit of height, Harry hopped as high as he could, eventually reaching the top step. At that point he flapped his wings again.
"Alright, well, let's start with my secret.” Harry nodded and turned to look at Lucius. “I- I've begun to manifest some... control... over the elements." When Lucius had nothing to say, Harry explained that the candles flared or wind whipped up when he was angry, and so on. Since the older man remained silent, Harry went on to explain his thought process of the meaning of everything in the dreams as he’d talked it out with Sirius.
“The wolf is perfect for Teddy, Harry; thank you.” Andromeda smiled softly.
Eighth year - Harry hears a conversation between Draco and Pansy.
Cattermole stood slowly and let himself be escorted out of the clothing store with no further trouble.
“I was just telling Harry about Dinki’s trip to the store.” Draco grinned as he extracted himself from Harry’s embrace to lift his son and placed a quick kiss on her cheek as he passed by to change him.
"M'sorry..." Harry muttered with a goofy smile on his face. "Least Ron got me back here... carried me most of the way like I did you back in December. He's great! He's a good friend. I love Ron! You can do lots of things but I don't think you could carry me like he did."
“I still can’t believe she went from our Freddy to Zacharias Smith.” George shook his head in disgust. “And did you hear what they named their poor son? Eugene Ugolino…”
“Yes, Mistress Cissa?” Dinki popped in.
Harry agreed and soon he and his cousin were outfitted in fine fabric. Harry's black trousers and green shirt fit snugly on his now healthy body. Dudley looked smart in his tan trousers and blue shirt. Both of them also bought new coats before they left.
Arthur Weasley brought Selene over to the Manor near the end of June. It was July before they knew it, and Charlie Weasley’s husband gave birth one month to the day from Draco’s birthday. July fifth was a sunny day and the whole family gathered at St. Mungo’s for the arrival of Corvus Frederick. Harry made a quick visit but didn’t stay long as he hated to be away from Draco.
“That’s lovely! Now, why don’t you sit with Susan for a moment? Harry will be in with the healer quicker than you think.” Draco told him with a serene smile. “I’ll ask one of the elves for tea. That always calms me.”
"Will you be taking them with you or shall I arrange for shipping?" Garnett asked as he allowed them to place their seals.
Blaise was suddenly awake again. "Really?"
“Your concern is noted,” Draco gasped as Harry’s lips skimmed his collarbone. “It’s also appreciated and enjoyed…”
"They've mostly assigned me to the physical defense classes but my teachers are going to let me learn a bit about all the different techniques because I showed that I have an interest and ...how did they put it?" Dudley disappeared for a moment and rustling papers could be heard as Sirius took his place. "Hang on; I wrote it down..."
“I do have another question...but I hesitate to ask it.” Harry confessed lightly.
Harry agreed. "
Harry laughed and agreed to join him in case there were blood wards.
On his way home, he'd allowed himself to get excited about the mysterious gay friend of this sweet girl who was trying to get him laid. Now he was annoyed with Dean and still excited but the guy was Harry Potter...would Harry want him? He'd been rejected by the man before and wasn't looking forward to another embarrassing incident.
As the other man had spoken, Draco could see what Harry meant. He took pity on his sheepish husband and showing his exasperation with a roll of his eyes and dramatic sigh, Draco looked at his father with mischief. "It's true, Father. You're not the type to sprawl on the sofa... I don't recall the last time I saw you slouch and – as someone who knows you well, I can tell that sitting where you are offends your sensibilities."
“I’m in!” Ginny piped up.
Harry chuckled. “Alright, I’ll work on my penmanship for next time.”
"Blaise has always held a fascination for the lake. When we were in first year, he saw what seemed like a ruin just outside the windows of the common room." Draco told him. "The wall keeping the dorms from flooding is the easternmost wall."
Everyone agreed, so they all dug right into the food.
“I saw you speaking to Abraxas’ painting last evening, Harry...” Narcissa began. “You’ve gained his trust... his respect. That was always a difficult thing to do.”
Their families were sitting at the same table in the back garden of Nettlestone Estate for Draco’s birthday celebration.
She frowned.
"Like what?" Harry's pleasant smile encouraged him to tell all his secrets. "What's on your mind?"
Harry smiled down at his son when Dinki handed the baby over.
"Thanks, but I'm meeting a friend in the library." She answered with a bemused smile.
“Where’s Draco? Why weren’t either of you at breakfast?” Lucius questioned angrily.
“Yes! Oh, Harry...yes!” Draco cried each time Harry thrust into him and whined with every impact his husband’s cock made with his sensitive prostate.
“Did you truly think I’d deny you something I do myself?” Harry asked.
“Thanks,” Harry grinned back as he lifted Lyra up to his chest. “Your uncle Ron wants to see you, young miss,” he whispered to the infant.
Harry was startled but quickly embraced his pregnant spouse. “What’s wrong, Dragon?”
“But you’re alright. Right?” Teddy asked with wide worried eyes.
“I loved her, but I wonder if I loved her as deeply as you seem to love Draco,” Marcus smiled sadly. “I’ve seen the papers and in the photos, the two of you look so lost in each other…so firmly attached, and I don’t know if our connection was that intense.”
“What makes you think of that, Harry?” Kingsley’s expression was neutral but he sounded quite curious.
Draco was getting worried. It was late May and Harry had gone out with his friends to celebrate Seamus' birthday but it was quite dark and curfew was only moments away. He readied himself for bed hoping Harry would return soon. Just as he settled under the covers, there was a knock at the door.
“Alright.” Harry smiled softly.
L******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Draco had just decided to sleep on it and maybe call in the morning when a bright light bounded through the window and took shape. He'd seen the shining white stag before and waited breathlessly to hear what it would say.
“You took my playmate…and I got bored,” Draco smirked as he scooped up the toddler from his father’s lap and placed a noisy kiss on the baby’s cheek. “But now, I’m not. Hello, my son.” A giggling Caelum grinned at his daddy and tapped the pregnant man’s cheeks with his small palms.
Lucius glanced at his son who had taken a seat at Potter’s right. “What kind of information?”
"The explanation for that goes back to when she received her baroness title which she did by saving the life of the King of England's godson who also happened to be the Earl of Northumberland's heir. She requested land in her home territory and they gifted her with the title and the property rights to most of the east bank of Loch Ness and up into Loch Dochfour." Harry told him. "Well, several years later, Nessie died from a wound after one of the sightings when they chased her. I’d imagine the monster rumors kept the perpetrators scared to think she was still alive and wanting payback for the wound. I’d imagine it was a small form of punishment to begin with." Harry revealed softly. "Also, the rumors are good for the area's tourism and she loved her home so she would’ve tried to find a way to allow the people who lived there to thrive - like Mac’s family. Overall, I think the illusion spell - which is tied to the chest I told you about - is just to memorialize Lady Ravenclaw's friend."
The Lucky Leprechaun was run by Seamus and his wife, Hannah. “Harry! What’s going on, mate?”
"Harry, you sure do work quickly!" Kingsley joked. "In ten minutes, dance past the Headmistress' table. I won't tell you who but they'll be sitting with her."
“Not even for an infinitely closer relationship with him?” Teddy asked incredulously.
The blond grinned up at him. “Alright. I’ll be fine with the kids.”
Draco quickly slipped the list into his pocket and opened his arms just in time for Harry to walk into them.
"I'll talk to him." Harry promised her before gesturing to Ziva. "This is the head Potter elf, Ziva. She'll show you around and introduce you to the others. The five of them take care of this townhouse and a place in Wiltshire called Potter Grove."
Lyra watched silently and Harry thought he saw understanding in those green eyes so while Caelum built a snow pile, he watched her through the corner of his eye. She stayed quiet next to her brother but Harry could see those little hands molding what looked like a ball of snow.
Draco nodded with a little difficulty so instead he spoke his answer and lowered his gaze.
Draco nodded. “I understand your meaning of the word ‘sheltered’ to mean ‘protected’…and I was but not from the dangers of a normal childhood. I was taught to fly soon after I’d learned to swim. Quidditch posed minor danger as far as my parents were concerned. The bigger danger – in their minds – was the deteriorating state of the wizarding world …by which I mean the taking in of muggleborn and half blood witches and wizards and the absorption of their ways. I was almost ten before I met a halfblood…and it wasn’t until the Hogwarts Express that I met a muggleborn but my parents taught me the names of the oldest pureblood families and I was to assume that any surname I didn’t recognize belonged to one of the two. Also note that I grew up with the children of several if not all of the Death Eaters.”
Harry, Lucius, Arthur and Molly waited in the kitchen while the Healer performed a few tests. His in-laws had arrived within minutes of receiving Ron’s owl and the children had long since been put to bed by the remaining family members. Ron and Hermione had Lyra upstairs with them and their daughter Angelica. Caelum had opted to go with Charlie, Gus and Corvus rather than the ‘girls’ and Teddy was tucked into Harry’s room while Arthur and Molly kept vigil with him and the Malfoys.
Breakfast was delicious and relatively uneventful but Hermione glared at him the whole time until they left for the first class of the day. Defense Against the Dark Arts was sure to be interesting. He was curious to see what Snape would do with a lord as a student. He was also dying to know how he’d react to seeing Draco’s new relationship with Harry.
Harry read the directions and began clicking away as soon as he put the manual down. It started with stills of the flowers alone and slowly Draco came into the frame. Harry could see his boyfriend’s cheeks flush with soft color as he bent to pull a weed or smell a flower. The brunet couldn’t get enough.
