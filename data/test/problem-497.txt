Sitting on the Hogwarts express felt surreal, it almost didn't feel right. Six full years at Hogwarts and this would be the first year he wouldn't be in danger of death every five minutes.
“I know! Isn’t it great?” leaving his best friend with a million questions and a bunch of open ended answers.
“Maybe the git just hit his head too hard on his ego.” He bites out, grey eyes narrowing at Harry. McGonagall just sighs, as if she’s dealt with this one hundred different times. “Away Mr Malfoy, come see me after dinner, we are not finished with this.” Experienced hands wave him away
“What the HELL do you think you’re playing at Harry? Fraternizing with the enemy? Sleeping with Malfoy so you can get your grades up? FUCK YOU!” Ron exploded, Harry was shocked, where the hell did the idea that he was shagging his worst enemy? “Are you serious Ron? He agreed to help me with potions, not down on one knee confessing his undying love for me” Harry spat, “and why the fuck do you think i’m shagging him? I’m not gay and he’s not gay so why would I be sleeping with him?” Ron released his grip slightly, his nails leaving crescent shapes in Harry's wrist, but his face was still bright red with anger. He could hear Hermione screeching at them in the background but it was just white noise. “Well I don't know Harry? Maybe the fact you jump to his defence at any chance you get? Who knows what you two get up to in your dorm at night?” Ron sneered, Harry was raging now too, how dare Ron accuse him of that?
“Okay, okay! Never have I ever, had sex with someone in school?” Blaise giggled, his face shining from the alcohol, Pansy and Draco both drank, both laughing at the memories of their terrible relationship. Blaise shot them a surprised look, not touching his own glass. Pansy smacked her glass back down on the table, “my turn lovelys! Never have I ever kissed someone of the same gender?”
He threw Potter his cigarette case, he pulled one out with a tan finger, sticking in between his chapped lips. Draco picked his wand up, lighting the end of Potter’s cigarette, spinning his wand around his fingers then putting it down. Draco watched the contentment ease around the other boys face, he clearly had been doing this in his own time.
“I haven’t done anything to him this time Professor, but the constant look of confusion on his face makes me almost wish I did.”
He heard Hermione’s chair scraping against the floor, he winced, the sound piercing through his ears. “Let me know if you find someone.” She smiled, gathering up her stuff, she walked around the table; wrapping her arms around his neck from behind, feeling her warmth and smelling her flowery smell made him happy, but as soon as it was there it disappeared. “Have you been smoking, Harry?” Hermione recoiled, standing back from him with a revolted look on her face. Harry froze, he was unsure of what to say so he just nodded. “Seriously, do you have any idea how bad for you it is? Not only that it is disgusting!” Hermione scolded, Harry rolled his eyes. “If I wanted a lecture on smoking ‘Mione, ' I'd dig up my parents.” He said, dryly. He watched Hermione stomp out of the library, leaving only her floral smell behind.
Draco ran his fingers over the green lighter in his pocket, it had been a present from Pansy Parkinson for his eighteenth birthday. It was a proper old fashioned, flip lighter, and Draco was obsessed with it. He wasn’t even really a big smoker anymore, but he always had it on him; it was just for something to do with his hands really.
After about an hour of deafening silence, Harry might as well have been asleep, this task was tedious and mind-numbingly boring; could feel his eyes getting heavy, he was abruptly woken by a loud crash and an ear-splitting scream.
“Have a look at this.” Draco moved the screen so Potter could see it properly. It was an email they had been sent from one of their bosses, telling them the price of their sales would need to increase during the Christmas period. Potter made a face, before straightening up, taking his glasses off and running a hand down his face. “Is that normal?” Draco scoffed, the man behind him sighed and shook his head.
Draco stopped in front of their window, it was wide open, curtains around it fluttering slightly in the wind; still giving a clear view of the Quidditch pitch. Harry stood next to him, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder, both of them staring at their windowsill.
Basically him and Ginny were simply not meant to be, they'd been placed up on this pedestal as the bloody saviours of the wizarding world and it had too much pressure on them as a couple. Ginny eventually ended things, Harry wasn't surprised but he was upset. He did genuinely love her, but being the boy who lived came with a lot of baggage.
Harry broke out in the biggest smile he could muster, carefully sitting down next to McGonagall as Ron said his speech. It was very funny, causing their entire class to roll about with laughter, he even saw McGonagall let out a small laugh.
“Because of the severity of your actions, you will both be serving detention every night this week, if I hear one insult, argument or hex, it will be for the rest of the month.”
It was chipped a little, but the gold paint was still swirled on the black door, standing out like a sore thumb. Draco put his hand on the wood, pushing it open gently.
A slight buzz from his phone woke him up, Draco reached out for it, taking a quick break from thoughtlessly cutting up fruit.
Potter was leaning on the counter, a dark haired girl stood very close to him. His face was flushed and his hands were awkwardly playing with his still badly done tie. The girl was holding a bag of things from the shop, meaning she’d already paid but was lingering around Potter like a bad smell. Draco was used to this by now, the endless stream of girls coming in to buy things for the sole reason of flirting with the boy who lived.
He stared back down at the pot, the black liquid swirling about in cosmic swirls. Draco didn’t even hear the kitchen door being pushed open fully, he didn’t notice Harry was standing in the room until the other man cleared his throat. “Draco” his voice was stern, steady.
“Harry?” Draco shouted up the staircase, he could hear some shuffling about upstairs, before Harry’s face popped down over the banister; smiling brightly. “Hi!” His face was flushed, shirt unbuttoned to his collarbone, dark hair covering his face a little. Harry practically tumbled down the stairs, they were squeaking as he went, signally the age of his house. He threw himself around Draco, wrapping his legs round Draco's waist.
Harry sits cross legged on an armchair in a plush, cosy room. The walls are scarlet red, draped with charming tapestries and ornate fireplaces. And he wonders why he’s been brought here, because it may be snug and pleasant, but it’s in no way familiar.
The ginger boy gives an unconvicted chuckle, Harry leans forward on his knees, exasperated. “You think I’m crazy…” The boy sits up, a smirk appearing on the sides of his mouth.
The office was rather quaint, two desks sat opposite each other, the walls a clinical shade of white; which was a worlds away from the burgundy walls of the main shop. Draco holstled his bag onto his shoulder, fishing for the keys to his
“Never! In all my years of teaching, have I seen two students be so hurtful to each other for so long! Never!”
“They'd say a lot.” Draco said, Harry stifled a snort. “Okay, okay! I’ll move in with you on one condition.”
He spun around, leaning on the doorframe, “I have called you Harry four times today, I should be careful, it might start to stick.” Draco smiled smugly, before closing the door. Leaving Potter alone in the room.
“I said” Potter moved closer to him, leaning over Draco and closing the window. “Have you ever kissed a boy?”
“Malf-” Harry started, but Malfoy stopped him. “No potter, I'm not taking your pity, I refuse to be your charity case” he stood up, walking back to his side of the trophy room, “you should’ve left me to rot in prison like my father.”
It was innocent at first, just a few drinks in the eighth-year common room to break the ever-growing tension between them all.
Draco spluttered into his wine, shaking his head wildy. “Merlin no Potter, I was a spoiled git when we first met, and then I joined a cult, I don’t exactly think we would've been braiding each other's hair and wearing friendship bracelets.” Potter laughed, a real one, it was the first time Draco had ever heard him laugh a genuine laugh, it delighted him a little. “Plus the whole Gryffindor-Slytherin thing would’ve fucked things up a bit.” Draco added.
You could’ve heard a pin drop in the room, neither of them spoke a word to each other. The only sound that could be heard was the faint tick of the grandfather clock placed in the corner of the room. Harry glanced over to Malfoy, he was still staring intently at the floor; not a single word came from the usually very mouthy boy.
He’s learnt the short woman's name is Madam Pomfrey, and she’s brought him up to a high tower in what looks to be a castle. There’s a woman with a pointy hat and a long emerald robe sitting on the sofa opposite to him, and next to her are the two people who were sitting with him yesterday. They’re whispering about something, and Harry is pretending like he can’t hear them, but they’re awfully loud.
kissed. He couldn’t ignore how right it had felt anymore, it had been something he had been going through for a while.
The portrait hole swung violently open, Harry's head snapped up to see a fuming Malfoy storming over to him; Harry glared at him, standing up to face the boy who was most likely about to scream at him. Malfoy stopped, right in front of his face, but he didn't say a word. They both just stood there, staring each other down with nothing but pure hatred, Harry raised his hand, away to punch him right in the middle of his smug face, but Malfoy stopped his fist in his hand; holding it above his head. "You have no power over me Potter" Malfoy snarled, Harry tried to wriggle his hand free, "you sure about that?" Malfoy's face did not change, continuing to hold on to his clenched fist. "I'd be careful around me golden boy, I've been top of potions every year since first year, I know how to kill you and make it look like an accident." Harry gulped, Malfoy released his hand and stalked off to their room.
i just wanted to let you all know i'm back at in-person school now! however this does mean i can't promise exact updates all the time, but i will try my hardest to get them out on tuesdays and saturdays!
Harry faded back into his seat, his face dropping into a scowl. It wasn’t directed at Hermione but he was a little annoyed, he had no clue about any of the potions in the NEWTs potion list and couldn’t even fathom starting any of his essays, who else could help him? Ron didn’t take potions, neither did Seamus or Dean and like hell was he talking to Ginny. They hadn’t spoken since their breakup, Harry knew she was happy with Luna.
“Draco, I dare you to sort out your problem.” Pansy was smirking so hard Harry though her face was going to fall off. Harry spluttered, clearly the only one affected by this very strange dare. Draco reached for his belt buckle, moving his shirt over the front of his trousers so no one could see him fully. Harry felt like he was going to explode, but he couldn’t take his eyes off the way those delicate pianist fingers were carefully pulling down his zipper.
“I am here this year as a friend, a boyfriend, an enemy. I’m not here as a saviour, I am here as just a normal boy trying to finish his exams and get a job. I’ve had a moderately normal school year this time, and I can’t wait to spend the next few years living a quiet life. Hogwarts has always been my home, that will never change, but now I'm ready to move on.”
Hermione watched as Harry ran off to Draco up ahead, they were both laughing with each other, she could hear them even from quite a distance. She was happy for Harry, finally finding himself was something she had always wanted for him.
“Apologies Mr interior designer.” Harry retorted, crossing his arms. “Follow me, I have something to show you.”
Harry immediately kicked into gear, sprinting to Malfoy’s side of the room. He turned the corner to see that he had fallen down one of the many trap doors that led to the river underneath Hogwarts, it was a long drop and he was only holding on by his right arm, the trophies around them threatening to fall. “Fucking hell Malfoy are you okay?”
Draco crashed the last bottle down on the shelf, rather surprised it didn’t break from the force of his hand.
He notices the smell before he notices the room, it’s chemically, combing through his nose; prodding at the already searing pain in his head.
"Fuck off Malfoy, I'm not dealing with you this year" Harry grunted, stepping closer to Malfoy. "You know they're calling me a hero down there" Malfoy boasted, Harry rolled his eyes and snorted "when did
As soon as the great hall doors shut, Ron jumped at Harry, pinning him to the ground. “What the FUCK RON?!” Harry half shouted, half cried, Ron’s nails digging uncomfortably into his wrists, his head throbbing painfully from the force of hitting the stone floor.
“I’m not sure yet, we’re going to look at some flats and stuff once graduation is over, I’ll be happy anywhere as long as it’s with her.”
“These beds are fucking tiny.” Draco’s gravelly voice spoke from behind him, he wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him into his chest. Harry wiggled round so he was facing the other boy, “that just means we have to be closer.” He whispered, Draco ran a hand through his messy hair, “what are you doing when you leave school Dray?” He closed his grey eyes, sighing a little. “I’m not sure yet, probably get a flat and then get a job at the ministry.” Harry nodded, he would probably do the exact same thing.
He leaned back, taking another draw from his lit cigarette. His mind unhelpfully wandered to his earlier fight with Potter, he was still surprised they had been roomed together but Draco couldn't believe that when he saw his name wrote next to Potter's that he'd actually though they wouldn't argue this year. Not even ten minutes alone together and Draco was shoved up against a wall with Potter shouting at him. One particular phrase was on replay in his ears, "
Ron plopped down on the sofa next to him, out of breath and red faced. Harry closed his book, turning a little to face his friend. “I can’t believe we’re leaving tomorrow, it almost doesn’t feel real.” Ron was right, it didn’t feel real, even when he thought he was leaving Hogwarts, he was back again a year later. “No, it doesn’t” Harry agreed, letting his legs rest over Ron’s lap. “What are you and ‘Mione doing after school?” He asked his friend, Ron shrugged.
“They hate each other ‘Mione.” Ron sighed, Hermione paused, looking forward again. She saw Harry and Draco laughing and smiling with each other; you would never have guessed they spent seven years at each other’s throats. “No they don’t, not really.” she took Ron’s hand in hers.
“And we probably never will be friends” Draco stated, Potter faded a little, his shoulders tensing up. “What makes you say that?” he wondered, staring at Draco with question marks in his eyes.
He appeared in Harry’s living room, he wasn’t there, but Draco could hear music playing somewhere in the house. He threw his bag down on the floor, opening the door into the main stairwell.
Draco turned around to face him, their gazes meet. And for a moment, the walls drop between them, leaving them open and vulnerable to each other.
“Okay I’ve got one, never have I ever-” A knock on the door interrupted Draco, the trio glanced at each other, Pansy groaning before getting up; throwing a pillow at Blaise on her way to the door. “Draco dear, it’s for you” Pansy said, in her sing-song voice, Draco turned to who was asking for him.
The dark, worn floorboards of the store bent and cracked to Draco's footprints. He wandered aimlessly through the shop, moving around certain glass jars and placing out the new stock he made last night. It was early, no one except him was in the shop yet; he liked it that way,
Draco was waiting in the Room of Requirement, he had gotten there early to do some of his own work. He looked up to the clock, he had around five minutes until Potter made a grand entrance. He glanced around the room, it was completely different from when he was normally here obviously, the walls were a soft green and a black velvet sofa was placed in front of a marble fireplace. There was also a large desk with two chairs, which Draco was currently sitting at, as expected, the door flew open.
Harry looked around the circle, he was sat in the middle of Ron and Hermione, directly in front of them was Blaise and Pansy. Neville, Dean, Seamus and most of their other friends were decorating the circle alongside them, looking just about as bored as Harry did. Pansy put down the bottle, producing a round of shot glasses and placing them in front of everyone. “Alright ladies, rules, someone in the circle will ask a question, and if you’ve done it, you take a shot.” Pansy explained, pointing her wand at the glasses as they filled up with the rusty looking drink “The glasses are charmed so when you finish a shot, they will fill up again automatically.” Harry looked down his glass, feeling the nerves rise up in his stomach. “Let’s get started then, shall we?”
Draco's head fell back against the sofa, his eyes falling shut. He worked his hand over himself, his hips bucking up faintly. Harry felt a surge of confidence wash over him, standing up from where he was sitting, sauntering over and sliding down next to Draco. Before anyone could say anything or protest, he leaned over and whispered into the other boy’s ear.
“Could you please help me?” Harry gulped, Hermione just shook her head, “I wish I could Harry but i’m falling behind too, you could always ask someone else?”
“Okay so we’re doing this.” Draco breathed, feeling the unsettling feeling of apparition flooding through him.
“Oh Harry, why didn’t you come see me, I missed you!” Ginny kept hugging him and pulling away again, Harry felt very uncomfortable in this situation. “Ah you know, just busy”
“I don’t deserve you Harry, I can’t be your friend because I am an ex death eater who watched people kill everyone close to you.” Draco put his glass down. “I can’t be your friend because I said some horrible things to you and your friends for
He felt like he was on fire, the way Draco’s cold hands were unzipping Harry’s trousers was making him fall apart. The boy wrapped his fingers around him, pulling him out of his boxers. Draco stopped kissing Harry, sliding down his body, licking a stripe up Harry’s cock.
A pale finger trailed down his chest, stopping at the waistband of his pyjama bottoms, he started palming gently; a dribble of precome staining the light material. Draco reached a hand down, throwing his head back on his pillow at the feeling, a deep exhale slipping through his lips.
What’s your suggestion Parkinson?” Harry walked into the centre of the room, taking the bottle out of Pansy’s hands and taking a healthy swig. Pansy took his hint, giving him a smug smile. “Well Potter, I was thinking never have I ever? It's about time we get those secrets out in the open, who’s in?” There was a low murmur of approval from the common room, people moving out of their seats and sitting down into a circle. Pansy gave Harry a small nudge on the shoulder before sitting down herself.
I want to see you as soon as I can. Once the kids are ready, things have calmed down, and I can get a night away: we need to get drinks. Just drinks, promise.
“Welcome to the family, ferret.” Ron squeezed his shoulder. The words were nice but it was the smile from Hermione that settled him.
“Do you remember Wood?” Draco looked confused for only half a moment before his eyes widened but it quickly softened to sadness. “It’s apparently been happening since she joined the Prophet shortly after Lily was born. It wasn’t anything real until two years ago but she didn’t want to leave the kids.” He looked at his hand wrapped around Draco’s. He had missed this man. They hadn’t spoken since before they both had gotten married, when the thing they had finally happened.
His voice shook slightly as he explained the last weeks to them. Ron was surprised but kept quiet while listening. He watched as his very first friend’s face went through the stages of grief. He had pushed for Harry and Ginny to be together.But it was Hermione's smile and how she said that she understood.
“Yeah, daddy, do they get to stay forever?” The two fathers looked at one another and James stepped forward.
Dinner was great. The Granger-Weasley children took to Scorpius immediately as well. Harry had missed this. It was loud and chaotic but it was his family. And getting to see the two blondes fitting in so easily made it even sweeter. Harry just took in the scene in front of him and smiled as warmth filled his chest. Having spent so much of his early life alone and without a family, this is what he had craved his whole life. He’d had it with Ginny but it was always like when you think you put the right puzzle piece into a spot but it’s not actually the right piece. It fit until the rest of the puzzle was done, it was just a little off. Draco met his eyes from across the sitting room where he was talking to James and Rose, presumably about potions.
“We should have play dates too. Al and Scorpius would probably be instant friends, you know. Since it’s going to be just us a lot of the time since Ginny is gone so much for work, it would be nice to have them make more friends.” Draco smiled. It wasn’t muted in any sense, it was bright like the joy was radiating out of him.
They played the day away, coming inside only for food and other necessary things. Kreacher made lunch for everyone and they all sat together with the kids full of excitement. Harry offered to give Kreacher the rest of the day for himself but he outright refused.
“Screaming at me that you weren’t some pathetic fag and that you had been using me just for sex really did not give me that feeling, that’s for sure.” The sad chuckle that came from Harry broke Draco a bit. That afternoon started to play in his head…
“Of course, you can! Your father is dating my son and you’re moving in with them. That makes you my grandson!” Arthur turned to look at Draco before walking over with Scorpius. “I’m happy that you’re here, son. You both are always most welcome in our home. We are here for you, alright?” Arthur reached up and wiped a tear from his cheek before patting it. “Now, I do believe we need to talk about how we can help the two of you with your move into the house!” Arthur set Scorpius down as he sat down at the dining table and gestured for Draco to do the same. They started chatting about the greenhouse he was going to need. Arthur had great ideas for making one inside of the house instead of in the back garden. They talked for a bit while Harry and the kids helped Molly finish dinner.
“Thank you, Kreacher.” Draco said quietly while still staring down the man in front of him as the tea was placed on the table in front of them.
“Draco, are you alright?” He was pulled out of his memory and nodded. He tried to smile but the weight of that day was like someone was sitting on his chest, even now.
“We’re done. We both came. Let’s be on our way.” Short succinct sentences would get him through this. Potter was storming towards him as he put his shirt back on.
“Fuck, Harry!” Draco dug his fingers into the ground as he finished inside the other. They’d been full shagging the last two months but he knew this would be the last. His mother had made it clear that this needed to end and he wouldn’t disappoint her. Her language earlier that day had been much kinder than his father’s were when he visited him at Azkaban the week prior. She was kind but made sure that he knew that he would not end up with a wizard.
“Not right yet, but she will be soon.” He sat at the end of the bed and gave James’ foot a squeeze. “I’m proud of you for standing up for our family. And I promise that I’m not going anywhere. Ever.” The tiny yawn from his daughter makes him feel tired too. “How about I check to see if it’s safe then we all have a cuddle in my much bigger bed?”
The letters started flowing back and forth daily over the weeks. Mostly about mundane things and their children. There was light flirting but they weren’t doing much more than that. There was a promise of more once he was ready and it got him through the days. Harry had realized quite a bit about himself over the last few weeks. He wrote to Draco about everything that he was processing. The biggest one was about when his marriage had actually ended. While he had loved Ginny, he had fallen out of love with her a few years prior. These letters were making him think more and more about his time with Draco after the war. They had been happy those few months. It was fourteen years ago but the memories were still fresh.
“So.. Who’s next?” Pansy’s voice was wavered, she was the one who cleared her throat. Harry downed his shot, the alcohol thrumming in his veins. “Harry, truth or dare?” It was Dean this time, removing his arm from around Seamus’s shoulder. Harry exhaled; he had a feeling he was about to be tortured by his friends for the rest of the night. He took the pussy way out, “truth.”
Someone with brown hair is sitting next to him, she’s touching him on the shoulder gently. Her smile makes Harry feel better, it reminds him of something, but he’s not exactly sure what. She leans over, the soft smile masking the look of concern on her face.
The options whirl around in his mind, either he’s suffering from some extreme concussion, or he’s dreaming. He screws his eyes shut, so tight his eyes start flashing white, willing himself to wake up from this horrendous nightmare.
“No, you don’t. You are allowed your own life, you can decide what you do with it.” Harry snapped, running a hand over his face.
“I don’t think you’ve breathed in my direction in three days, is everything okay?” Harry asks, the tiniest notion of worry breaking through. Draco looked up from the pan, lips pressed in a thin line. “I’m fine Potter” He spat, turning the heat down to let the oil simmer in the pot.
Harry sits himself back down, the white ceiling is still blurred, and for a moment, he thinks that maybe he’s hit his head
The many plates of food appeared on the tables in front of him, his mouth watered at the sight of Hogwarts food again, he had missed it. Ron and Hermione were both stuffing their faces, trying to make light conversation. "Do y'know Malfoy's back this year?" Hermione mentioned, putting more food on to Harry's plate. "Surprised the prat showed his face, he so much as even breathes near you Harry I'll hex him into next week." Ron drawled, an aggressive tone lacing on his tongue, it scared him a bit. "I've actually already spoke to him" both Ron and Hermione snapped their heads up, looking at him as if he was mad. "He was just spouting this all this stuff about being called a hero" Harry pushed the food around on his plate, Ron scoffed. "He wishes, he's just a git" His friend threw his fork down, leaning forward on the bench, Harry just brushed him off.
Harry and Ron followed their lifelong Professor out into the courtyard, the rows of white seats sitting out in the sunshine. He looked around for Draco, seeing the boy sitting in the front row next to Pansy and Blaise, Hermione on Pansy’s left; he was smiling widely. Harry felt all his nerves drain away in an instant.
"If you're going to do that could you please stink up someone else's room." Harry snapped, shoving the door closed. Malfoy didn't retaliate, he just turned to look at Harry; pulling a metal container out of his pocket, "want one?" He gestured towards Harry, offering him a cigarette.
With Harry finally dressed, they were downstairs with the rest of their year. Draco was awkwardly hanging around Harry’s friends, not making any conversation but nodding occasionally. Harry and Ron had to go over to McGonagall to give her their speeches which left him with Granger.
The eighth year dormitories were astonishing, they were a stunning deep purple colour-as though not to favour any house-with floor to ceiling windows that were draped with midnight blue curtains. The walls were adorned with gold frames filled with pictures and drawings of all the students through the years, Harry looked up at the ceiling; it was charmed like the night sky, similar to the great hall. There was an ornate fireplace, comfortable leather sofas encircling it. Harry walked around the corner to the long hallway of rooms, looking for the one that had his name on it, he ran his fingers over the walls; stopping and the door where his name was delicately painted in gold paint.
“No Harry, you’re going to let me talk first.” Ron said, sitting down at his desk. Harry nodded, leaning on the wall next to him.
Harry was surprised at a Rons outburst, but most of all he was hurt, physically and mentally. Ron spitting accusations at him stuck in his mind, did he really defend Malfoy? Sitting back against the sofa Harry realised how stupid he had been. He just got beat up by his best friend for speaking to Malfoy, and then continued to still go to the room of requirement, cry his eyes out in his nemesis’s arms, then have an actual conversation with him that didn’t end in a fight, but an apology? Had the world turned upside down?
Harry sat down next to Ron, fidgeting with his hands. All of his anger was gone, it was replaced with embarrassment, how could he just let Malfoy stand in front of him and speak to him like that? And he just did nothing? Ron rubbed his back, leaning over to whisper in his ear. "Go say some horrible shit Harry, I know you want to and I won't tell 'Mione" Harry smiled smugly, and bolted up to his room.
it made him upset, what if he didn't want to forget? Knowing that he helped Potter twice in the war made him feel the smallest bit better about all the horrible things he saw and did then.
Draco had never been through so many emotions in such a short span of time, he started his eighth a snobby arsehole, the whole world seemed against him. Apparently, spending time with golden boy really does change a person. Draco had started to pull his mask down, being more open with Harry. His mind kept flashing back to when they kissed, and then when they
Harry studies the floor. He feels microscopic, like someone has just shoved him hard into the deep end of a pool, and his feet don’t touch the bottom but his head doesn’t go out over the top either. There's a burning question digging into the back of his head, he glances over at Madam Pomfrey and the other lady.
Ignoring the protests in his head, he moves to stand. The girl next to him pushes down more firmly on his shoulder, effectively shoving him back down onto the hospital bed. A taller boy comes to stand next to her, grabbing onto Harry’s other arm and helping him down too. His vision is still blurred, and Harry now assumes it’s not just from waking up, he can vaguely make out red hair, which sends a shiver down his spine.
“Well that explains a lot.” Draco breathed out, Harry stood up from the bench, moving around to lean on the sleek black piano; he crossed his arms. “Play something for me” Harry pretty much ordered, Draco smiled smugly, and began playing.
Harry leaned in, kissing Draco hard. It was quick, firm and not at all pleasurable; it was like he was kissing a mannequin. He pulled back, staring at the other boy intently. The dare was finished of course, but neither of them were backing down, they were both too proud for that. Draco grabbed the back of Harry’s neck, kissing him again.
“Tell me something.” Harry blurted, Malfoy turned his head, raising an eyebrow. “A story, a happy one.” Harry clarified.
“I want you, so much.” Harry paused at the door, his breath shallow in his throat. “You’re all I fucking think about.”
Potter was the son of two very famous London detectives, who just had to get themselves killed in an attack that only Harry survived. Which left their only child the heir to their entire agency (and fortune). They’d both ended up at the same boarding school when they were eleven, Draco’s parents had told him all about the boy who lived when he was younger, so he was desperate to make friends with the most famous boy in Britain.
i'm finally off on summer break! this means that my updates will either be really fast or super slow, i promise i will write when i can but i've been so stressed recently that honestly i just taking time to chill.
After being roomed with Harry Potter during his final year at Hogwarts, he found out that the most important thing about a home is the people inside it; which probably explained a lot about Draco’s upbringing.
he still had a good three hours until he had to meet Draco and dinner started in fifteen minutes; he wasn’t going to eat but the rumble of his stomach suggested otherwise.
“Potter?” Draco shouted, Potter’s head popped out the door frame, a look of slight annoyance threading his face. “What?” He grumbled, still doing up his tie. Draco crooned a finger at him, calling him over to the desk. Potter’s tie was still messily undone around his neck, giving up trying to it as he trudged over to Draco.
“Look he’s not interested okay? Take the hint and just sod off..” Draco trailed off, noticing the upset on the girl's face. She mumbled some sort of apology before darting out the front of the shop. He looked up at Potter, who was still clutching the back of the counter, staring intently at the floor. Draco’s eyes narrowed, a large burst of anger flew through him. He’d had the decency to stand up for his childhood enemy and the man couldn’t even spit out an a “thanks”
“He only remembers you for a reason Mr Malfoy, so either you cast this or are somehow involved as to why Mr Potter has suddenly woken up with no recollection of his life.”
"This year, we have returning students who missed out on their education due to the battle in last year. They will be know as our 'eighth years'. First off, you will not be in your house dormitories this year, there has been a special tower built where your dorms will be. Since there is not many of you will all be taking classes together, rooms are assigned in twos, if you wish to swap come to my office, your timetables will be waiting for you on your desks. Welcome back and enjoy the feast!"
The hospital smells again. It’s not hurting him anymore, it just reminds him of what he doesn’t understand. Nothing feels normal, it feels distended, isolated, divided, there’s something Harry is missing.
“Harry, is everything alright? You’re awfully quiet…” The girl asks, she sounds more worried than she looks, without knowing her, he could guess she’s either bad at covering up her anxiety or a bloody good actor. Harry feels slightly ill, but it’s not from the pain in his head or the other injuries in his body.
Harry realised that Malfoy had invited him to the room of requirement at the same time the other boy did. Harry had to sit down and process this information for a moment.
“Yes it is Harry. It’s exactly what it fucking looks like.” Ron scolded, his voice steady, his eyes were glaring at Draco, staring him down with fury in his eyes. Harry glanced over at Draco, he was expecting him to be cowering in a corner, but Draco was standing his ground; staring intently back at Ron. “Harry, what do you think you’re doing?” Ron said firmly, Harry swallowed, he opened his mouth to talk, but Draco interrupted. “I don’t think what Harry does in his private time is any of your concern, is it Weasley?” He said sweetly, batting his eyelashes.
“Look potter, even if you were in Slytherin, we probably wouldn’t be friends, we’re too different.” He turned back around to face the messy haired boy who was sprawled over the sofa, looking at him from a distance. The t-shirt he was wearing clung gloriously to his body, his arm flung around the back of the sofa, Draco caught a breath in his throat. He quickly shook it away and sat back down across from him.
“You two need to stop this childish bickering, do you either of you know what you are fighting about anymore?”
Harry’s eyes open, the bright white of the ceiling has a slight blurred haze to it. His breathing his haphazard, a sheen of sweat lines the back of his neck, making him twitch uncomfortably. His back arches as another wave of pain streaks through every nerve in his body, a strangled groan leaps out, forcing him to sit bolt upright.
It was a sluggish Tuesday; they were a month into their final year at Hogwarts, the usual hubbub of the common room was nowhere to be found. Harry, Ron and Hermione were sat around the fireplace, studying furiously, the reality of NEWTs hitting them like a train. Harry was bored, extremely bored. He'd just been watching Ron and Hermione revise while he tapped his quill off the table, doing everything other than studying.
He ran his fingers over the blade clutched between his fingers, the handle was a soft ivory, engraved with his initials, the silvery trim glinting in the sunset from outside the window. Draco saw the way it smoothly slipped in between the grooves of the red berries on the table, it kept him calm. Doing something like this over and over comforted him, almost lulling him to sleep again.
“You have an aura” she looked up at him, scooching over on her chair to make way for him. He flopped down, his head flew to her lap, letting out a mock sob; sitting up to look at her, she was stifling a laugh. “What?” he questioned, giving her a playful shove on his shoulder.
Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, sitting down on the floor, Harry joining them. “It’s about something you mentioned during our.... Well, fight?” Ron’s face dropped to the floor. “If it’s the gay thing, I didn’t mean it.”
At the end of the day, Harry knew he had to go back. People would be fawning over him every two seconds but he wasn't doing this for praise, he was doing this because he was terrified of Hermione.
Harry was moping dramatically in Ron’s room, Ron shared with a Hufflepuff that was barely in his room therefore it became the trio’s new place to spend time together; the common room was just too busy for their liking. Harry was lying face down on Ron’s bed, whining loudly about his detention.
Although old, and outdated, Grimmauld place was rather charming. Behind the peeling wallpaper and slightly strange smell, it had this comforting allure to it. Draco had always assumed it was damp and cold, but Harry had clearly made some changes since the Black family lived there. Albeit, some certainly
After that, Harry had been filled with confusion, looking too far into Malfoy's life. Why would someone who had despised him for seven years willingly help him kill the person who was meant to be his saviour? If Malfoy hadn't thrown him his wand Voldemort would still be alive and Harry would be dead. Is that not what Malfoy wanted?
“I have a problem” was all he said, Draco stood up, staring into the other boy's eyes. “Let me guess, you caused it?” Draco knew he was pushing it, but Potter was already so riled up it would be a wasted opportunity to not piss him off more. Potter shoved right into him, throwing a punch at Draco’s face, “I HATE YOU!” he roared, but tears were falling down his face, he was scratching and pulling at him but his punches were growing weaker and he was basically just pawing at Draco now.
“Dad! Mr. Arthur says I can call him grandad, can I?” Draco looked at Arthur who was smiling right at his son. Arthur poked Scorpius on the nose.
They were surprised that it had happened so quickly but not that it had started again. Harry was happy that his friends were behind him in this decision. They had been there for him when he had told them about his time with Draco all those years ago. Even then they weren’t surprised when he finally told them that he was bi and that he had fallen in love with the blonde. Ron had a lot of jokes about it, then and now, but they were just happy that he was happy.
“Harry?” he pulled his head up and made a surprised noise when he felt Draco’s lips touch his. It was gentle, no one pressing for more but not stopping either. It was several minutes later that they finally pulled apart. “I’ve wanted to do that for years.” Harry chuckled.
“I do need to tell them, all of them. But I doubt anyone will have a real problem with it. Ron, Hermione, Gin, and George know what happened between us so I doubt that it’ll be much of a shock. I think I’m more worried what Molly and Arthur will think. They’ve been the closest things I’ve had to parents, well, ever. Goodness, what will your mother think?”
“It’s a real pleasure, Miss Lily.” The boys introduced themselves and they all decided to go to the back garden, Kreacher had helped the Potter children set it up for their play date. Harry hung back with Draco, watching their kids running around the yard with Kreacher watching them closely. They went into the kitchen and Harry made some tea. They sat in the breakfast nook in relative silence for a few more minutes until Harry turned to Draco. He pushed a piece of blonde hair behind his ear before pressing a kiss to the other’s lips. “Are you sure, love? You have to be sure. I know last time was my fault but, I can’t go down this road if you’re not ready.” Harry was going to let himself have this. Draco had ended it then but he understood it all now. So he was certain that what he was about to say was the absolute truth.
“Of course you do, you mother hen, you.” They both heartily laughed at that. “I need to pick up Scorp from the Manor, can’t leave him with Mother too long or else I’ll never get him back.” They just smiled at one another for another moment before Draco stood. “I’ll owl you about the playdate. It was good to see you, Harry.” He had forgotten how much he loved hearing his first name come out of that mouth.
“Hi, Mr. Malfoy! Hi Scorpius! I’m Lily,” his daughter thrust out her hand to them and both fathers chuckled. Draco knelt down and shook her hand.
sorry it took me so long, i was finishing my novel. but we're back and i should have more regular updates from now on!
“I forgave you the moment Jamie came into this world. If we’d have stayed together, we wouldn’t have our children. We’re here now, so let’s talk about our way forward, okay?” Draco smiled and kissed Harry.
“Kreacher has readied their rooms for bed.” Harry put Scorpius down when they got to the stairs and Al immediately took his hand and they walked up together. Draco kept Lily in his arms as they walked up the stairs to the kids’ rooms. Harry had James’ hand as they all went to the bathrooms to get ready for bed. They were all moving very slowly since they were so tired but they got into bed easily. Both wizards gave each of the children hugs when asked. Harry smiled at how flustered Draco looked when Lily kissed his cheek when they tucked her in. Once they got the children into bed, Harry took Draco’s hand and led him to his, no, their room. With the door shut, Draco’s warm hands wrapped around Harry’s waist.
“I’ve missed you. I know that is the complete wrong thing to say right now but it’s there. I have missed you so very much.” Harry looked up and saw that Draco was trying to suppress his smile.
“They don’t want that right now. I’m sorry, Gin, but I’m never going to make my children do something that’s going to hurt them.” Ginny deflated even more if that’s possible. “They will see you when they’re ready.” He stepped back and looked to the stairs. “Give Wood my best. We’ll see you as soon as they’re ready.” She nodded and walked down the stairs but he waited until she was out of sight before going back in.
“I love you, Gin, but our son is right.” He stood and headed to follow his children. “You should just go. We all need some time.” He turned to face her and set his expression, “I’ll let you know when they’re ready to see you again because I won’t force them before they tell me.” He headed up the stairs and found them all snuggled together on James’ bed. His eldest was reading to his siblings. Lily was falling asleep and Al had his head on his brother’s chest. His sons rarely got along and to see James’ arm wrapped around Al, reading to him warmed his chest. His eyes met his eldest’s over the book in his lap and they both smiled.
“If you’re leaving, just go. Now. You don’t want to be here so go. We’re staying with Dad.” James stood and Harry couldn’t bring himself to stop him. “We don’t want you here.” James turned back to his siblings and dad, put his hands out, and took his siblings upstairs. Harry looked at Ginny who was quietly crying.
“I had to pick up some supplies to restock and I saw you walking with a lot of determination. I came in hoping you were still here. It looked like you could use a friend and it has been far too long.” Harry nodded in agreement they hadn’t spoken since that summer after the war. They reconnected when Harry had testified at his and his mother’s trials, which kept them out of Azkaban. Both Malfoys were grateful but Harry made sure that they knew it was because they deserved it. No matter what they had done before, he wouldn’t have survived without their help. They helped win the war at key moments that could have ended everything.
“I don’t love you. I never have. I never will. You were a warm body, someone to practice on.” His voice was stern but soft. He dared not look away from the green eyes in front of him. It was killing him to say these things but he knew he had to make Harry hate him. He took a few deep breaths but his father’s words began to play in his mind. He didn’t mean to let it get to him but it was his father. He grabbed Harry’s shirt too and shoved until he was pressed against the tree. “I am not some pathetic pansy boy. I am NOT a fag. You mean NOTHING to me!” He leaned in closer so he could whisper in Harry’s ear, “you helped my family, my fucking you was payment. But I am done pretending, run along, Potter.” They both let go and he apparated inside the manor. His mother was waiting on his bed and he collapsed onto the ground sobbing. She rushed over and pulled his head into her lap.
“Will you teach me about potions once we build the greenhouse?” He chuckled as he knelt down to be on the boy’s level.
“It was bad, Harry. The last time, it was bad.” Hermione looked over at Draco and it started to worry him. “You didn’t get out of bed for weeks. Do you even remember what it was like after he hurt you? We were still healing after the war and I had to scream at you to eat.” Her eyes started to fill with tears.
“But I don’t want to go home, I want to stay with Al!” The little blonde was so upset his face started to turn red with the tears. Harry’s heart broke a little as he scooped the boy into his arms.
“Daddy, when is Mr. Malfoy going to be here?” He poked her nose and looked at the clock on the wall.
“It’s just one of the many possibilities. I just prefer that one if I’m being completely selfish.” Harry sat back and smiled.
The first time Draco kissed him they were sitting against a tree, their tree. They had ended up at this same tree every day since they started this. They were sitting next to one another holding hands and Harry’s head on his shoulder.
It had taken almost a month and a half before things cleared out and were quiet again. They had received many owls but the wards against messages from strangers did their duty. The owls from his friends were full of kind messages but it was the owls from Molly and Draco that surprised him. Molly’s words of love and wanting to remind him that he had been her son for much longer than he and Ginny had been together was exactly what he needed to hear. She was quite upset with her daughter and supported his decision to protect the children. She wanted them with her at the Burrow as soon as they were up for it but knew they needed time.
“Yes, ‘the Saviour of the Wizarding World!’" He usually tried to keep his utter disdain for the title to himself but Draco was safe. “If only they knew the truth, right?” He finally met those grey-blue eyes and sighed. “That I didn’t do anything without the help of so many people and just dumb luck. That I’m a mess and apparently completely unlovable since Ginny is leaving me,” he blew out a shaky breath and stared down at his fingers trying to ground himself in the glass he was holding.
“Mine will sleep about an hour after the morning that they had, I’m sure Al will wake him if need be.” He nodded and thanked the elf for checking. The elf apperated away with a bow and Draco pulled Harry to him for a kiss. He didn’t intend to push it more than the press of their lips but Potter hadn’t changed in the last fourteen years. Always taking more than what he was ready for. It didn’t take long before he had a lap full of the other man. He got lost in the feel of the other’s lips and tongue. It made his toes curl and he let it go on for several minutes before the voice inside his head started screaming.
Things had quieted down after the initial shock and craziness because the Prophet had no shame in splattering it all over their pages. Harry shielded the kids from it all. They had formed a bubble in their house with Kreacher helping out more with the children than normal. He had owled everyone who needed to know but asked to give him and the children some space for a bit. He had asked them if they wanted to see anyone but they all said they just wanted to stay home with him.
Telling them that Draco and Scorpius were moving in with him went better than he imagined. Molly and Arthur’s acceptance meant everything to him but he needed his best mates to understand as well. The whole time he kept looking over at Draco as he spoke with Arthur. To see them interacting so easily, it made him long for regular dinners here again but with Draco instead of Ginny. It was all so much faster than he ever imagined but he knew that had shoved the memories down because of the pain it had caused him.
“We’ve been fucking, so what? I needed to get off and you just happened to be willing. Move on, Potter!” He started to laugh, he knew it was going to sound real because his mind couldn’t process what was happening. “I was using you. How daft are you?” He saw the pain flash behind the anger on Harry’s face. “What? Did you think we’d sail off together and live happily ever after? That’s not how this works!” Harry closed the gap between them and grabbed Draco’s shirt in  his fists. He faltered for only a moment but he was sure the other didn’t notice.
Just as he was reaching the kitchens, he bumped into the one person he wished he would never see again.
“But the truth is, we were all children thrust into a war, we didn’t know what we would become once it ended? Coming back was not easy for a lot of people sitting here, some were even scared, but being scared is good, because we don’t grow when we stay inside our comfort zone.”
“I think It's time we up the ante, truth or dare?” Pansy suggested, filling everyone's glasses again. Harry nodded, that did sound like a lot of fun. He kept drinking from his glass, as did the majority of the circle, no longer needing the excuse of never have I ever to neck back shots. “I suggested it so I will start, Hermione, truth or dare?” Hermione evaluated her options, before looking to meet Pansy’s eyes. “Truth.”
Potter wasn’t on the shop floor, probably just went downstairs to the office for a minute. Draco first flipped the open/close sign over, turning off the lamp that shone outside. Wandering over to the till to shut off the computer, before going to grab his stuff from the office.
After what might have been the worst few days of his entire life, Draco had never been more delighted to see the end of the week. He’d mostly worked in silence alongside Potter, they hadn’t had a proper conversation since Draco’s brush with death; he didn’t know how to feel about it. They seemed to have fallen into a weird habit of hating each other’s guts but not hesitating to save the other person's life,I mean he hated Ron but if the git was falling to his death he would just let him; what was the difference with Potter?
“Look at them all, your friends are all watching you fall apart.” Harry wasn’t exactly sure where all this was coming from, but Draco was whimpering into his ear. The hand that was pulling on his leaking cock was starting to tremble, signalling that he was close. “Harry, you think you can make him come just from talking?” Pansy asked him, turning her head to the rest of the circle.
Harry let out a loud groan, not only did he have to room with Malfoy, he was now spending his entire week with the boy.
The woman curtly takes the picture out of his hands, placing another one in quickly. “How about this?”
The great hall felt emptier than the years before, without Dumbledore, Lupin, Fred, Sirius.... Harry thought he would be never be back here, yet here he was, sat in his usual spot with his two best friends; It was almost like nothing had changed. Except everything had changed, he had destroyed his entire school and people had died trying to save Harry's ass. One of them being his best friends brother.
“Kreacher’s cocoa is the best there is,” Harry smiled as the elf handed each child a mug after telling them to sit up. He was surprised when he was also handed a mug. “Thank you, Kreacher.”
“We’re all going so we’d better hurry!” They all rushed inside and got in the floo. It was quick and they were in the Burrow. Draco had never been here before but it smelled like a wonderful home. Something he never had. The children were running to the kitchen with Scorp right behind them. Harry dusted his own shoulder and then Draco’s. The small moment of domesticity was everything he wanted. They followed and found Molly being introduced to Scorpius by the other children.
“She has been wonderful, actually. Nothing has leaked. She got Gin’s solicitor in line which was amazing to watch.” Harry’s smile was so genuine it settled Draco.
“She knows. When she heard about your divorce she asked me if I was going to go after you now, she said that I’d better or I wasn’t the man she raised. She’s softened since Father’s passing and Scorp’s arrival. She just wants us all to be happy.” Harry took his hand and his heart started pounding when he felt the other’s lips on his knuckles.
“Kreacher has set up a new play area for the children in the back garden.” The boys ran out and Lily gave Harry a kiss on the cheek before following.
“You could do with calling my ‘dad’ a bit more often, I quite like it.” They both laughed. “But other than that, there's nothing to repay. You are our family and this is what we do.” They looked over at the scene in front of them. Everyone was chatting easily and had taken to the newest members of the family. Harry was surprised at how quickly it had all been settled but then again, Molly had known about what happened years ago and she would never turn him away. The rest of the evening went well with everyone stuffed full of food and laughter. The kids were all yawing from running around so much and Draco raised an eyebrow at him which made him nod.
“Does Scorp get to come too?” Draco felt so much love for the boy in that moment. He wanted to make sure that his son was included.
“Thank you, Kreacher.” He pushed back the tears that started to form. “I’m really glad you’re here.” He gave the elf a light hug and stood back up.
“I am so proud of the man you grew up to be. That boy is absolutely perfect and I cannot wait to spoil you both.” She pulled back. “I know my daughter did not handle this well but we can all be happy that we’ve ended up here. You two were always going to end up here. This just means that I have two more to love!” Arthur came bounding in with the four children all shouting.
“But home IS where Al will be. You and your dad live with us now, remember?” He shook his head but started to calm down. Harry looked at the softly smiling Draco who was holding Lily in his one arm and had James’ hand wrapped around his other. Al came running to Harry to take his hand. Harry let it sink in that this was his family now and it made him feel whole in a way that he hadn’t before. He walked with the kids over to Draco and placed a soft kiss on the blonde’s lips. “Ready to go home?” The flush on Draco’s face rose quickly.
“Do you think it’s bad that I’m ready to just dive into this with you again?” Draco shook his head and rubbed his thumb over Harry’s cheek. “I know I should be,” he started to choke up and it broke the blonde’s heart, “upset with Ginny and with you.” Green eyes met grey. “But I’m not. I’m happier with her gone. I’ve been happier here with just my children and reading your owls every day than I have been in years. When you walked up to me at the Leaky it was the best thing that has happened to me since Lily was born.” He could see the pain in these admissions behind Harry’s eyes.
“Do you mean it? We get to live here instead of with Grandmother? I really like it here!” Al was nodding very enthusiastically and bouncing.
“Introduced herself and everything just like we were practicing. They were all so immediately taken with them. Al can’t share worth a damn but he wants to share a room with Scorp. The boys saw us in my office and they asked if they were going to stay. This is right for us. I know it all sounds too fast but those two blondes are what’s missing from this family.” Harry looked to Ron. “Mum is already planning their jumpers and dad walked in with Scorp in his arms telling him to call him grandad. This isn’t about what I want, it’s about we as a family need to move forward.” Harry flinched when Ron moved but he was pulled in for a hug. Hermione was next. They both smiled at him and knew that everything was going to be just fine.
He was pushed up against the wall by the door, Harry kissing him hard on the mouth, running his hands up and down Draco’s chest, tracing little circles into his hip. As much as he was enjoying this, he pulled away. “We’ll get carried away.” Draco whispered, Harry’s expression didn’t change. “Then let’s get carried away, skip graduation, run away together”
“You have me Harry.” The other boy leaned forward, their foreheads touching, the only sound heard was their breathing. “I want you to tell me every terrible thing you did and let me love you anyway Draco.” He exhaled shakely, moving to kiss Harry again.
He slid down sheepishly on the bench, Ron and Hermione side eyeing each other, Both putting down their forks and staring at him; their eyes filled with animosity. Ron cleared his throat, Harry shook out his thoughts. “Ginny.. Uh said you were looking for me?” Harry cautioned, trying really hard not to piss Ron off anymore than he already was. Ron was still glaring at Harry intently, “yes, I
It had been a pretty busy day at Lunars, and the shop had only been open a few hours. After word got out that the famous Harry Potter was working at a snug little Apothecary store in central London, it had never really been a quiet day. Draco was thankful he spent most of his time in the back of the store.
After what Harry guessed was the hardest day of his life, he couldn't wait to crawl into his bed and let sleep wash over him. He climbed up the spiral stairs to the eighth year dorms, feeling the fatigue already hitting him. He ignored Ron and Hermione's complaints as he trudged past them, going straight to his dorm.
It was familiar now, Harry’s smell, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t the thing that made Draco blush more than anything. The hints of cinnamon mixing together with the orangery scent made him flush from the bottom of his neck to the tips of his ears, it was like he had smelled it for his entire life. That was when it hit him.
Draco pushed the door open, revealing a rooftop garden, red rose bushes were blooming from colourful pots, there was an extraordinary view of the extensive grounds lying beneath them. “Woah” Harry breathed, Draco pulled at their still connected hands, showing Harry out onto the deck.
He stirred in his sheets, his cock already half hard just from thinking about last night. Draco willed himself to have self-restraint, staring directly at the ceiling, letting his hands rest on his chest to stop them from going down any further. He couldn’t do this, he knew that, although Harry kissed him first, last night was enough to send him running for the hills. But his words were playing on repeat, making his cock twitch again.
Draco and Blaise were in Pansy’s room, they were playing some kind of drinking game; similar to never have I ever, you took a shot of firewhiskey every time you did something, except their shots were laced with veritaserum. And they were having an absolute riot.
Draco followed Harry out of the room, he wandered up the stairs, pushing open a door on the second floor. Inside the room was a large, black piano, with alternating keys. draco felt his face lighting up, moving over to the instrument and sitting down, letting his hands hover over the black keys; relief washing over him. “It’s been here for years” Harry sat down next to him on the bench, “I was here with Ron and Hermione before we went horcrux hunting, ‘Mione knows how to play so she attempted to teach me and Ron since there was nothing else to do.” Harry’s face was soft, running his fingers gently over the keys.
“Well it’s actually because you scared me out of it.” Draco downed the rest of his drink, getting up to get more.
Weasley, I wouldn’t do it in a stupid game of never have I ever.” He quipped, Ron’s eyes darkened, lurching forward and necking back his shot. He watched as it filled up again, before looking up glaring at Malfoy. “Never have I ever, joined a bloody terrorist group.”
“Judging by the layer of dust over it, I'm guessing it wasn’t successful?” Draco raised an eyebrow, Harry snorted, pushing Draco's shoulder. A comfortable silence fell over both of them, he let his head rest on Harry’s shoulder, his citrus scent running through Draco’s mind.
Harry grabbed both sides of Draco’s face, connecting their lips again, Draco placed a hand on the nape of his neck; the other one pulling him in even closer, if that was possible. They kept kissing, innocently this time, surrounded by the fragrant flowers of the Malfoy’s roof garden.
He straightened himself out, “Er, I was just letting you know that it’s okay to fight with your friend sometimes.” Draco ran his hands over Potter’s. “Now let’s get those hands fixed and get this tutoring over with, I guess.”
He yanked Harry away so quickly, pulling him the long way around Hogwarts. He ran through his favourite spots, knowing that it would probably be the last time he would ever get to see them. They went up the spiral staircase to the eighth year dorms, ignoring the paintings who were telling them to get back to the party.
“You have all been mind-numbingly boring since coming back, I think it’s time we spice things up.” Pansy wiggled the bottle, a smirk appearing on her face. “What do you say?”
“Hello, Lunars Apothecary store, how may I help you?” Draco grimaced at his embarrassingly posh phone voice.
Everyone was gaping at him, they had every right to, even Harry was unsure of what had just happened. Their faces were all flushed, pupils blown wide, tugging at their clothes; the room was undeniably hot. Harry looked straight across the circle, Draco was sat back against sofa, knees pulled up to his chest, lips kiss bitten and swollen. His usually sickly pale face was crimson, a purple bruise turning up on his neck.
A knock on the open door alarmed him, Ron was leaning on the door frame, looking positively pissed off. "Oh" Ron sneered "so you're still alive" he grimaced at the sight of Malfoy for the first time in months. "Oh don't sound so disappointed Weasley, I might start to think you don't like me" The blonde boy strolled into the adjoining bathroom, Harry just mouthed at Ron to close the door and leave, giving him a look of
Draco shoved open the heavy door to the wood shed, sitting down on the small stool that was pushed unceremoniously into the corner. He reached into his pocket, pulling the metal cigarette container Blaise had given him for his seventeenth birthday. Taking one out he placed it in between his lips, lighting it with his wand. He breathed out, feeling the smoke envelope his lungs; it had started to become his only way of coping, not a day went by where Draco didn't think of his involvement in the war, it made him feel sick.
. I see you; you walk into work in the morning and your hairs all still slightly messy from sleeping, and your shirts unbuttoned to you collar, you’re mumbling stuff in French and you’re playing with that bloody lighter. Draco, I see you and my heart beats differently.”
“Potter? What’s goi-'' he didn’t need to ask, Potter started hyperventilating, his body shaking and his breaths shallow; he collapsed into Draco’s arms, looking like he was about to black out. Draco knew this was a panic attack, he had them all the time during the war but he had never seen anyone else have one. He picked Potter up, carrying him over to the sofa, he sat him down, taking both sides of his face in his hands; pulling him to look at him.
Draco stood up, moving out of the way to give Potter some privacy, ambling down the steps to the office.
Harry is surprised at his irate outburst, all of their gossiping heads snap over to him, appalled looks on their faces. He sits back against the armchair, running a bruised hand through the front of his hair. “Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on?”
“I know how bad it was, ‘Mione. You don’t have to remind me, I lived it. I loved him then. After all of those years, it made sense to happen when it did. And now?” He looked them both in the eye. “I love Ginny. I loved her for so long but it was never like this. The moment I saw him at the Leaky, it was like everything made sense. He’s helped me figure all of this mess out.” He started to think about only a few hours prior when his kids met him. “Lily walked right up to him and shook his hand, she doesn’t do that. You know how hard that is for her. She’s never done that before. Jamie kept talking his ear off about potions and I have never seen him that genuinely excited before. He doesn’t do well with adults. Then Al,” Harry chuckled, “he took to Scorpius immediately. It was like… it was,” he covered his mouth as he felt the tears start to form. “He shows up for a day and every issue I have spent so long trying to help them through is just fixed.” Both of his friends smiled.
“He came over to tell me how much he liked you. He said that you are so much more fun than me and his grandmother combined.” Draco smiled thinking about earlier in the garden when his little boy came rushing over to tell him how much he loved it here. “Maybe it’s all coming together so easily because it’s just time? We’ve waited long enough. I work at home so it’s not like I’m just leaving you with another child alone and he can still go to the manor to see Mother. How do you think the Weasleys will take it?” Draco knew how important they were to him.
That was how he found himself at the Leaky Cauldron on a late Tuesday afternoon. They had discussed what their life was going to look like now. She would be moving in with Oliver not too far from Grimmauld Place and they would share custody. She had apparently already sent  an owl to a solicitor so they could legally divorce. She didn’t want anything from him and the same for him. They decided it would be best if the children’s main residence was with Harry since Ginny travelled regularly for the Prophet. They were going to tell the children tonight and Ginny would move out at the weekend but he needed space from her for a minute or an hour three. He wasn’t angry anymore, it was starting to all make sense in his head but he was still sad.
“Molly, I’ve just heard we’ve acquired another grandson! This fine, strapping, young lad right here!” Molly laughed as her husband picked up Scorp and put him on his hip.
The conversation with the children went about exactly as Harry expected it to. Lily didn’t fully understand it but she still cried as he brought her to his lap to hold her. Al was angry, it was obvious that he had a better grasp on everything but he was still only six. He shouted through the tears that he refused to let her leave, how could she leave them? What had he done wrong? It was heartbreaking to watch. Ginny tried to calm him but he sat next to Harry and glared at his mother. The worst, however, was James. There were no tears or sounds that came from the eldest boy. He just sat there. Their exuberant, precocious boy looked utterly defeated. He too moved to sit by his father. Harry could see how hurt Ginny was by this but he couldn’t stop himself from feeling proud of his children in this moment. What he didn’t expect was what James said after a few minutes of quiet tears.
He tried to leave several times but Scorp would not hear of it, neither would Harry. After lunch all four children looked like they could use a nap so Kreacher said he would take them upstairs to sleep and that he had set up a space for Scorpius in Al’s room. They all trudged up with the elf and the fathers cleared up lunch. They worked in relative silence with smiles and glances until there was a crack and Kreacher appeared.
“I’ll see if we can go to the Burrow for dinner, invite everyone but Gin, I’ll owl her. We can tell them all at once. Then we can get you all set up here for good. Okay?” Draco nodded and he felt so nervous. “Go play with our kids, I’ll be out shortly.” They both stood and Draco headed out to the garden. His heart was so full seeing them all play together. He didn’t want Scorp to grow up alone like he had, the Potter children had welcomed him in and he wanted them to be siblings. James noticed him first and ran over almost knocking him down.
“That’s why I pulled you from the Room of Requirement, I couldn’t leave you. At the time, I thought it was because I owed you a life debt but it went a lot deeper than that.” Harry chuckled as Draco turned and placed a kiss on the other’s palm.
Thank you. I don’t really know what else to say. The kids and I have decided to wrap ourselves in a bubble for a bit. But as soon as we’re ready for visitors, you’ll be the first ones over.
“It was good to see you too, Draco.” He took another sip of his drink as he watched him leave the Cauldron. He couldn’t stop himself before chuckling because his day was all better because of Draco Malfoy still being a nosy twat.
Harry was pulled out of his memory when Lily ran into his office with a squeal. He looked at his tiny, firestorm of a child and chuckled as he picked her up and sat her on his lap.
Draco Malfoy had aged quite well over the years. His white blonde hair now much longer and usually tied in some elaborate way or in an effortlessly messy bun. He was still lean but it was muscle. Harry got lost in his grey-blue eyes for a moment and didn’t hear what Draco had said.
“Kreacher is most happy to serve, sir. Kreacher wants to know if Master Scorpius sleeps a set amount of time for his naps so that Kreacher can wake him.” Draco’s heart soared at thinking about Scorp being cared for in this home too.
“I have missed you terribly, Potter. But,” Draco’s smile turned sad and he squeezed Harry’s hand, “this isn’t the time, love. You have a lot to deal with before we can even begin to think about this again.”
“Kreacher, I promised them pizza and ice cream. Could you get that together? And we’d like you to join us tonight. We need to have the whole family together and that includes you.” The elf smiled and bowed.
“I thought about them a lot. I would’ve left two years ago if I hadn’t.” She stood and took his hand. He tried to force the tears back. “I’m not happy and I know you’re happier when I’m gone.” He took a step back and pulled his hand from hers. “We’re not kids anymore, Harry. We deserve to be happy with people we truly love."
“Uh, yes, let’s go home Potter.” They said quick goodbyes with promises to be back on Sunday for supper. They hopped into the floo and were back at Grimmauld Place in no time. Kreacher met them with a smile.
“I know all about it. My children can’t keep anything a secret for that long.” Draco couldn’t breathe as she took his hand and cupped his cheek. “You make my son happy and bring that boy round to me all of the time, understood?” Draco nodded as tears started to fill his eyes.
“We have wasted so much of our lives on what other people want. My children don’t care, they just want me to be happy and in one day with your son they have obviously chosen him as their brother. They also seem to like you, especially Jamie which is such a surprise because he’s outgoing but not with adults he doesn’t know. I adore Scorp already, granted he’s a miniature you, how could I not?” Draco chuckled.
“How does it work? You spend a few months shagging me, telling me that you love me all for laughs, and then on a random Tuesday decided to tell me the truth?” Draco tried to get away but Potter was stronger than him. “Huh?” He was shouting and shaking him now. “After everything we’ve been through, you’d think you’d’ve matured from this petty bullshit. TELL ME THE TRUTH!”
“They should be here any moment so we’d better get downstairs! You have a new friend to meet!” Her eyes lit up and she hopped down waiting for him to get up. They got to the sitting room right as the green flames lit up. Harry’s boys ran in right at that moment and he lit up when he saw the two blondes coming out of the fireplace. Lily ran right up to them and smiled.
“Oi! The fuck do you think you’re going?” Draco set his jaw and shoulders as he turned to face the other, watching stand and start dressing.
“She just walked up to him and shook his hand?” Hermione looked so surprised, as did Ron but she had been helping with Lily’s anxiety when meeting new people. Harry nodded and smiled.
“Never thought I’d live to see the day that Draco Malfoy was the missing piece of my family.” Harry turned to smile at Arthur who wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder. The feeling of insecurity hit out of nowhere and Harry just felt like he needed to hear it directed towards him from the man who had been his father for the last twenty years.
“Kreacher is happy to help Master Harry and the children in any way he can.” Lily leaned over the edge of the bed after setting her cocoa on the bedside table and kissed the elf’s head. This was a regular thing and it always flustered Kreacher but Harry knew that the elf secretly loved it.
The play date went quite well if you asked Draco Malfoy. Scorp had made new friends and they played the day away. It warmed his chest to see not only the children getting along but Scorp had instantly taken to Harry as well. He had always known that Harry would be a wonderful father. He made sure that each of the children felt included and that everyone had gotten their fair share of him and Draco. James had taken right to him and was asking him so many questions about his work as a potions master. He looked so much like a young Harry that it made him think back to their early days at Hogwarts. Al had Harry’s quieter demeanor and Lily was not only the spitting image of her mother but she had her temperament too.
“We’ll be going to the Burrow for dinner soon, Kreacher. No need to fix anything up.” Kreacher bowed and with a crack he was gone.
“Kreacher serves Master Harry but there are Blacks in the house,” the elf bowed to Draco. “Kreacher will not disappoint Master Black and his son.” Draco smiled as he watched Harry try to argue with the elf about taking time for himself. He remembered Kreacher from when he was a child and his mother had brought him here to visit her aunt until her death when he was about five. He was a fiercely loyal being and the blonde admired him. He saw how different the elf was now than how he had been those years ago. He was softer and kind. He played with the children and seemed to adore them almost as much as their fathers.
