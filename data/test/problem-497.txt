“Good. Keep looking at it.”
With Harry pressed firmly against him, Draco brought his fingers to Harry’s neck, feeling the fine hair there, thick and unexpectedly soft beneath his fingers. He ran his fingers over it and felt Harry arch back into his hand, even as his hips pressed forward.
“Those are not mutually exclusive.”
Potter’s flush has filled in nicely, but the look on his face has segued from rage to something else. He almost looks distressed. “And the stuff that isn’t on the list?”
“No one. Fortunately, as it’s the sort of item that has a way of making it into the gossip pages.”
So he found himself in the lane outside of the gates at 4pm exactly.
Unfinished business is a prime example of exactly that sort of thing. Which is why he finds himself, freezing in silk pyjamas, reading glasses still perched on his nose, trudging to the Owlery before sunrise with a letter in hand.
Draco offered a smile that he hoped looked friendly. “I was torn between the stables and the orchards. We’ll go to the left, if you don’t mind.”
Draco begins to wonder if he’s missed something. Misbuttoned his robes or got a smudge of something on his face. Checking would only make it worse, but really, this kind of examination would put anyone on edge.
Harry tried to fit the pieces together. “What are you saying?”
Potter glanced over his shoulder, then turned back, brow furrowed as if he was trying to figure out what question to ask first.
“No idea. Her granddaughter’s a third year Ravenclaw.”
Draco raises an eyebrow.
“Yes,” Draco affirmed. “I want to.”
“If you think walking around a field is going to make me discover some deep-seated fear of cigars or tunnels or the Weasleys or something, you’re barking.”
Draco’s free hand slid up Harry’s side. “Can you feel how hard I am for you?”
“Yes, Harry,” he answers, “More. Anything you…More.”
“Hey.” Harry looked almost as frozen as Draco felt, though he didn’t have the disadvantage of surprise.
The cabinet serves another purpose: the discrete storage of an array of useful magical objects. His Pensieve has pride of place among them.
Still, his voice is softer than he means it to be. “You have portraits, photographs, and tapestries to sort.”
“I’m at Malfoy’s, and I found this drawing of—they’re crime scene drawings, from the case, but Malfoy wasn’t at the scene, and—”
“Very well,” Draco answered, a bit coolly.
“Yeah,” Harry pants. “Yeah, fuck. You?”
,” Draco drawls, and if Harry makes a bit of a face…well, he’ll remember that for later.
“Of course. Wouldn’t want to run the risk of chafing.”
,” taking care not to make it so bright as to wake Malfoy, and crept towards the kitchen, trailing his fingers over the posts at the foot of the bed, and then the doorway, and then the wallpaper lining the hall.
“And yet you refuse to explain why you are unable to testify.”
“Wizards think they’re so innovative.” Draco laughed and pulled a blackberry from his top drawer. “Muggles have already got there.”
Sydney was as eager as he’d said he was and, it seemed, into hair-pulling. He hummed around Draco’s cock and went deeper.
He thought of Malfoy’s face, eyes fluttering and head thrown back in orgasm. “We have worked together as Ministry employees.”
Harry was sure he'd come to the first day, to see the innocent freed. And fo the second week, to see the guilty condemned. But these few days of ambiguous cases...what to say of Narcissa Malfoy, who had saved his life weeks after she would've trussed him up and sent him to Voldemort on a silver platter? What to say of Gregory Goyle, undoubtedly too stupid to know any better, but dangerous all the same?
Draco smiles. Harry can’t see it; one of many benefits of this arrangement. “I already have.”
“Did you miss the flush, too?”
“Thank you,” Potter repeated.
“Like that?” I barely manage it, for the sensations shooting down my shaft.
“Blaise, do you remember when Draco was fun?”
, he'd decided to just grit his teeth – into some semblance of a smile, obviously – and see this one through.
The problem was, his brain reminded him, that Harry was still, well… still Harry Potter. The letters Draco would get if he deleted the Golden Boy on air would be scathing. Howlers, probably. And Floo calls and phone calls and angry rants in the street. He couldn't go back to that, nor could he risk the ratings drop. It was a matter of simple self-preservation.
Harry nodded. “If that’s okay.”
Draco sat up a bit straighter. It wasn’t that the greeting itself was unusual—most of his fellow Ministry workers seemed to understand that openly cutting a colleague would reflect poorly on them, no matter how much they thought they ought to be able to, such that perfunctory pleasantries were common enough—but Robards sounded like he meant it. Genuine thanks had been a far less common occurrence in Draco’s professional life than “good mornings” spat through gritted teeth.
“Sirius, my godfather. He wore a ten.”
“Yes,” he answered firmly.
He checked his pocket watch instead. “It’s been over an hour.” He looked up, not trying to hide his surprise. “Well done.”
They stood there, staring each other down, until the door on the right swung open. Draco wondered whether he could possibly enjoy the smug victory to come more than his anticipation of the same.
It was, Draco thought, an interesting response from someone who’d claimed he’d be happy living as a Squib. “Would you try again, please?” At the look on his face, Draco amended, “Once more. And then I’ll join you.”
“They’re looking for kids?” On the one hand, a brilliant diversion. On the other, best not to look too pleased at the prospect of falsely accused teenagers in Potter’s vicinity.
“Oh. Right.” Potter fell silent and resumed walking effectively, Draco thought, ending the conversation.
“However,” Draco warned, “his control is still a serious issue. The outbursts have continued, and while they haven’t yet, those could also become stronger. He can’t effectively use his magic until he’s able to control it. We will need to continue working and, though I’m sorry to say it and I’m sure you’re sorry to hear it, it may take some time to resolve the issue. Control is much harder to manage than pure power, especially given Potter’s circumstances. But he certainly can’t do his job effectively until it’s addressed.”
Malfoy’s gaze travelled the length of his body, closely followed by an exploratory hand, which traced the outline of Harry’s bicep.
“Now you mention it, darling, perhaps it’s not a bad idea.”
Draco ignored them all, poured himself a cup of tea, and sat at the head of the table. “I see we’re all off to a good morning, then.”
Suddenly, he’s twenty again. Or, the version of him in the Pensieve is. Twenty and just this side of properly drunk and leaning against Harry Potter’s kitchen worktop with a pint in one hand, and laughing at some inane joke of Potter’s. He was so full of them, all the time. In those days Harry’d been so eager to laugh. To make Draco laugh. Desperate for it, almost. And he’d succeeded, time and again.
Slowly, Potter complied.
“But the freezing—”
“Need to come. Need to – so close.”
“In a heartbeat.”
“Here we are at bakeware. Please be aware that these sections are organised differently to those where we store larger items. For instance, rather than being sorted by date of arrival, as in our furniture section, bakeware is organised by intended use, then size, with a special section for those items, such as holiday baking tins, that do not fit within standard parameters. Are you aware of any such specialised items?”
“I’m going to open you up so slowly, Potter. Get you so ready for my cock.”
“Oh, of course,” Pansy gushed, with the sort of saccharine over enthusiasm that Draco had long known to take as a warning sign. “No one will give it a second thought if I, the recluse who once tried to hand Harry Potter to the Dark Lord, show up out of nowhere after a decade with enough cash to buy a few castles. And I’m sure they’ll be lining up to have me in the neighbourhood.”
Draco went on without mentioning the most recent of those incidents. “I’ve analysed those reports according to every scheme I can think of. This is the only one that accounts for everything.”
“It is, yes.”
Harry rolls his eyes, but it ends in a grin.
Draco meets his eye and startles at Harry’s intensity. He looks just as he has so many times before and…and. Draco’s body moves without his permission, the starched line of his uniform struggling to fall around the cold wood as he takes his seat.
Draco smiled his understanding and they turned back, Potter trailing half a step behind Draco again at first, though they were walking abreast by the time the stairs to the terraces came into focus.
Draco kept his voice even. “I do. Simply offering you the choice.”
He stopped when they were well clear of the stairs. “All right?” he asked Harry.
“Exactly.” Harry crossed the room and put a hand on Draco’s arm. “Draco, come on. “ When Draco didn’t turn, he continued. “Unless you’re not actually up for the challenge. In which case, I’ve brought you a present from the Muggle world.”
Blaise looks between them as though unsure of whose comment to address first. “Pans, you’re quite right. Draco, you’re quite mad.”
* * *
And there it was, the hint of pleading he’d been waiting for. Draco pressed his front into Potter’s back, the buttons of his waistcoat surely pressing into Potter’s skin. “Leave it?”
He just – unbelievable, but he always has been unbelievable, and he really did – just laughed.
He snorts, shakes his head again.
* * *
My raised eyebrow is still just as powerful as he, and he stammered when he caught his own, apparently unintentional, meaning.
The warmer weather lured his colleagues out of their offices, too. Luc took to stopping by mid-morning for Draco’s company on a walk. They traded ideas, discussed their more difficult students. Chloé brought her daughters to work, and Draco spent an afternoon showing them how different wands could produce different results, much to their delight, though Chloé wouldn’t let them try Orchideous until they were officially enrolled at Beauxbatons. And the office next to Draco’s, which had been empty when he left, had been filled by a postgraduate researcher called Julien, who delighted in yelling questions through the window at Draco, which he did not especially enjoy, and in convincing Draco to give him a tour of gay Parisian nightclubs, which he enjoyed much more.
“‘Pass the cream, please.’” She rolled her eyes at his expression. “And very little other than that, about you or anything else.”
Potter was following them as though they were passing a Quaffle back and forth.
“Are you quite well?”
“You’re telling me you have a genuine investment in his wellbeing.”
He was so close behind me that instead of air my palm pushed into soft white cotton, and he fell back with an indignant, “Hey, watch it!” He held the hem of his t-shirt away from him, examined it. The imprints of my fingers were arrayed over his chest, five distinct marks arcing across his heart.
Draco nods and lets Harry pull him to the bar.
“You were right. Your theory was right.”
“As you likely would’ve found out, yes. Hardly seems the time for holding back.”
Harry heard them drop and opened his eyes. He stared, confused. “What are those?”
She nodded.
“A phone call, then?” Draco snorted and crossed his arms. “I can’t imagine you’d know anyone I’d want to speak with.”
“Take this in…oh.” Harry grins. “What happened to working up an appetite?”
Harry’s hand laid over his own pulls him out of his thoughts. “Draco?” Harry’s brow is furrowed. He’s worried, bless him. “It’s not anything like last time. I’m really sorry.”
“Same.” The moon was just beginning to wane, and there was enough light to reflect off Draco’s champagne as he took a sip. “And you’re sure you want to make the trip tomorrow when we’ll be back for Christmas in a fortnight?”
“Right.” He nods slowly, and turns, bending over the edge of the bed, his arse open to me.
He nodded and watched her walk away before heading towards Potter’s rooms.
“Are you capable of complexity?”
Draco looked away and shook his head, and Harry felt the loss of his focus as acutely as if someone had ripped away his coat.
If he weren’t thoroughly homosexual, and she wasn’t completely preoccupied with Blaise, Draco would’ve gladly offered to sire her firstborn, complete with rights to any remaining Malfoy trusts.
As they walked, the boards faded into sand, and with a jolt Harry realised that they were stepping off the boardwalk altogether. “Is this where we watch?”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes.
She frowned. “What do you mean?”
Malfoy’s dry tone threatened to pull Harry from his reverie. Of course this was the real Malfoy; no mirror could capture that note of condescension. But it felt dissonant. He knew that voice like the back of his hand, but it was a million miles away.
"Is this a joke?" Harry asked. The hint of anger was back.
“Yes,” I affirm.
“Do you still like kippers?”
Harry turns to look then swivels back around when he realises that he won’t be able to see anything, and is probably making a bit of an arse of himself.
“My shirt?” Potter looked just a bit startled.
“Is that a request?”
“Er, I haven’t, but I haven’t actually managed to get hungry yet, after lunch.”
“Leave that to me. Our next group meeting isn’t too far off.” He frowned. “Unfortunately. Isn’t there something else you can use?”
“Yeah. Or,” Harry amends, “has been.”
“No!” Malfoy shouted, then looked sheepishly at his drink. “It’s strong.”
You’re not. You have to live to be scared, so you’re not. Can’t be. It’s impossible.
“Mine neat,” Pansy added. “Though an explanation wouldn’t go amiss.”
“Yes?” He looked up from his fork, on which he’d balance one single leaf, as if to draw out the amount of time he could spend devoting his entire attention to his meal.
Potter’s eyes lock onto him. He looks hungry and intense, halfway to combusting, and he kisses Draco with a still-unrivalled intensity that makes Draco’s—both Dracos’—knees threaten to give way. Potter nips at his bottom lip and breathes into him, and younger Draco is visibly bereft when Potter pulls away.
“What do we do with all of these?” Harry didn’t look away from the flowers.
the air, not just to a destination point. Closer to flying—you need to steer.”
be done and what
Noon arrived, and then one, and he figured it was safe to start walking to the conservatory, even if that meant, in the interest of caution, walking very slowly through the foyer and down the corridor past the music room and the morning room, and slowing down even more when the great glass doors to the conservatory came into view at the end of the hall.
“I do! Believe me, I do!”
Herm –
“He?” Lucius forced out between continuous coughs. He had nearly spit out his tea as his son had unconsciously given them too much information in his opinion. That couldn’t be! His son was the only heir of the Malfoy family! His son was of pure blood; blood so pure it could be traced back hundreds of years. His family had power and influence. His son couldn’t… no. No, this had to be a misunderstanding. There was no other option for this. He wouldn’t accept this…
“And what about Snape?” Harry exclaimed. An angry blush rose on his cheeks. “He has changed sides. Why can’t Draco do the same?”
"I'm sorry to be late, love, but I can't stay for long. I need to quickly change and set off again. I'm needed at the shop." Draco didn't even take his shoes off as he already moved past Harry, pressing a fleeting kiss onto his cheek, before he vanished into the bedroom.
wasn’t the one to be told to betray the one she loved.
They took turns to walk down corridors he believed he had never been to before. This part of the castle was the farthest away from the dungeons, yet not much warmer. Even up here, on the seventh floor, the battle had left its remnants – the outer walls had holes blasted into them, bricks and debris covering the floor. He couldn’t escape the pain out here. He needed one person for that, and he really hoped that said person still needed, or
Harry was close to losing hope. He couldn't find him. What if he had already been in his room but hadn't recognised it because the person living in it wasn't there? He had never been in Draco's rooms, he merely knew about where they were. Not even that he was one hundred percent sure of.
“See?” Harry’s voice was chipper. I scowled at him.
Draco smiled softly as he turned towards the stairs at the other side of the cozy room. Hermione had said they led to the dorm rooms. Summoning more courage than he felt at that moment, Draco started towards the left one, and climbed up the crooked staircase. He moved past the first and second year dorms before he noticed that each storey harboured one year of students.
Enjoy! :D
The population of Hogwarts was excited and it was impossible to not feel it. So, as Ginny sat in front of the burning fire in the nearly empty Common Room, she couldn’t help but smile.
” She bit her lips. “I mean… It's Draco Malfoy we’re talking about here. Can he really make a 180 degree turn so soon after rooming with Voldemort earlier this year?”
“Draco,” he lowered his eye lids, so it looked as if his eyes only contained the colour bright green. It was creepy as hell. “Did your parents ever tell you anything about possible Veela ancestors in your family lineage?”
Hermione scoffed and forced the dark-haired wizard to turn around. He looked completely lost, so unlike usual. “We’re not too late. Now listen to me, Harry. We will march in there. Well, you will. Underneath your cloak. Ron and I will create a diversion. Didn’t Draco once say that his father held peacocks? We’ll think of something. Once everyone is busy trying to figure out what’s going on, you sneak up the stairs and into Draco’s rooms. Once you’re in there, you get him out and we’ll apparate back to Grimmauld Place.”
"Oh just an inside joke. Anyway, who wants to take a ride?"
For a moment I thought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest,most sweetly girlish voice, "Come here, Mr. Potter, dear." Dean sat down, I gave him a look that said thanks for trying.
"I lost count?"
SHOCKED!
At first I thought he was talking to the blonde girl, but then two identical twins, or brothers, came running up to him. They grabbed the cookies and started eating. They also had the orange t-shirt on and I saw a beaded necklace around the neck of the taller one. I looked at them again and noticed they were all wearing them. Some had more beads than the others and they seemed to be painted.
"And he decided to blame me." He scowled.
Just then, my monster radar went off. And it went crazy. I heard footsteps outside the door and turned to my mother with horror, "Gorgons!"
"It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you..."
"There you are, Harry! Now get your ass out there onto my flying Pegasus, were about 16 hours behind schedule!"
"I don't want to bother anyone..." Before I had finished, Percy slid the door open.
"Does he think he'll go batshit crazy if he spends too much time with me?" I said loudly to Ron as Seamus' robes disappeared behind the bend of the door.
I swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the courtroom.
"Hermione Granger."
"Yeah, obviously."
I slowly took one, as Ron brought it to his moth he quietly sobbed "I'm sorry Red Vines. have betrayed you. I am unworthy of your tastiness."
"What do you want you horrid bitch!" Ron said through sobs. Surprisingly, Thalia laughed.
We all sat down to eat.
"No we're staying!" Said Harry and Hermione together, reacting like one brain.
We ended up in an alley where I saw a truck labeled Delphi Strawberry Service. Probably some kind of code name. I wondered why Dumbledore trusted this guy.
"...no"
"I mean... Cedric turned out okay and he was a Hufflepuff." I butted in.
Instead they got, "Can my family get any weirder?"
"You cast some kind of protective barrier around my mother and step-father. I don't want them to get hurt."
In the back of the last row stood a woman. I had seen her before but now I couldn't understand how I could have missed her. She had perfect blonde hair that matched her porcelain skin. Unlike the rest of the witches and wizards who donned plum colored robes, she wore a green blouse with sheer sleeves. Definitely a Slytherin in her Hogwarts years. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.
I raised a questioning eyebrow but they ignored me and instead Piper patted spot next to her, gesturing for me to sit down. Reluctantly I walked towards them and sat on the bed in between Piper and Percy.
After Dr. Thorn I stopped listening but when she said Bob, I snapped back. I could feel tears in my eyes.
"Technical-"
"Harry, he can't be one. Dumbledore trusts him. And I could see it in his eyes. As if he's looked into the depths of hell itself. That isn't something you can pretend."
"Come on let's go outside." Said Piper, "Percy's got a friend."
"How am I supposed protect Harry when I'm learning the ABC's!"
"Wow," breathed Bill, "A crazy pirate that's afraid of Diet Coke. That's something alright."
"True! I won't let you go with a Death Eater!"
I'm pretty sure I saw her in Percy's scrapbook but I can't be sure. They seemed to be talking in codes. I still remembered exactly what they said.
"Mom! We have guests!" He yelled before taking a seat and offering cookies.
Ok maybe it was.
"Without ever practicing them before?" said Parvati. "Are you telling us that the first time we'll get to do the spells will be during our exam?"
Then circled.
I put my hands on my hips, "As if you don't know! But after Dirt face everything is fine, Gleeson and Mellie had a child, Chuck. Clarisse's the godmother. Frank and Hazel went back home, Frank's working with Reyna." I sighed, "And Repair Boy's down."
The next second I heard the door open, followed by Mrs. Black's screams of HALFBREED! BLOODY DISGRACE! HALF-BREEDS AND MUD-BLOODS AND BLOOD TRAITORS ALL IN THE SAME HOUSE! MY HOUSE OF NOBLE BLACK! SHAME ON YOU SIRIUS! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO OUR BELOVED MANOR!
The courtroom fell into chaos.
"Hmm... Why not?"
Severus sighed. "I don't know Percy, alright? I didn't want to bring you into this at all. It's way too dangerous for someone who doesn't even know how to disarm their opponent to fight against someone who can kill you with one world. I told Dumbledore that you didn't deserve to be dragged into anything else again but he... He keeps..." He trailed off.
"That makes two of us," said Percy arriving at our table and squeezing onto the bench beside me. "Why do you wizards have double classes? That doesn't make any sense. Can't you stick to a simple schedule like they do in high school."
"Peculiar. A wand crafted from the wood of a laurel tree, specifically one which had been turned from the naiad Daphne by Eros. Or so the myth told." Great, just like me to get a stick with some Greek mythological meaning. "Kraken tooth mixed with siren heartstring core, straight from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. I didn't even know such a wand existed let alone in my shop." Thanks dad. "Give it a wave, Percy."
"That's her." I said smiling.
"Let me handle this." He said calmly. He uncapped the pen and it turned into a shimmering bronze sword with a double-edged blade, a leather-wrapped grip and a flat hilt riveted with gold studs.
"You wanna be our prank partner?" Asked George wiggling his eyebrows.
"What were those things?!" Asked Hermione.
"Oh no worries." said Dumbledore pleasantly. He gave his wand a little flick and a chair appeared out of thin air.
"Nothing Percy. Here," He placed a heavy purple satchet in my hands that clinked whenever it moved, "Go over to that place selling wands over there. Tell the guy you're a new student and he'll know what to do. I'm going to go look around for some potion materials, I'm running low. I'll come get you when I'm done."
His words were met with a yell of outrage from Sirius.
"Don't talk rubbish Harry! Of course we're going!" Hermione stated furiously.
Cheesy.
Hermione slapped him while I asked Dumbledore, "What's his name?"
Red always bothered me anyway.
I nodded obediently and Lupin hugged me. I could smell something that reminded me of a wild dog on him. Is this what Percy meant when he said he could smell his "kind."
"Hmmm..." Lupin seemed lost in thought for a while, then he turned towards me. He placed a hand on my shoulder, "Look after yourself Harry. Be careful."
Whisk eggs in a separate bowl. Add vanilla to eggs and stir to combine. Pour egg mixture into the Greek yogurt-flour mixture. Stir together gently. Add blue food coloring. Stir again.
Suddenly we saw two kids emerge from the back of the truck. A girl with shocking gray eyes and blonde hair in princess curls and a boy with sea green eyes and messy black hair. They were both pretty lean and muscular and had orange t-shirts that said CHB on them.
This time the wand didn't explode, instead it released a humming noise, the sound of the Sea.
"Well, Mr. Thomas?"
"Yes," I was beginning to feel desperate. "it's a stag, it's always a stag."
"Annabeth!" By the time her name had slipped from my lips it was too late. She was already inside the food truck, sitting next to one of the Stolls while the other manned the wheel.
He swiped through the connection leaving me dumbfounded. Sometimes I hated immortals. Correction, most of the time. They always dumped a bunch of information on you and then left you alone to pick up the pieces. You're immortal, it wouldn't be wasting much of your precious time if you just explained stuff to me.
"I know, just remember to IM me and stay safe."
They finished together reminding me too much of the Stolls.
We left the room, and made our way back to Ginny's and Hermione's bedroom. I was tempted to eavesdrop on Dumbledore and Percy but Hermione pulled me away.
Percy just took it without a word and stored it back in his bag.
not for my sweet mothers ears.
"Good evening Sally, my name is Albus Dumbledore and these are my students, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Harry Potter. I looked at him to see if he'd show any recognition but when he didn't I was relieved and my suspicion of him behind a Death Eater faded a little.
Out of no where, I saw two pies fly out of the back of he truck and hit the back of the brothers. "Hey!" They yelled in harmony as the boy and girl were laughing our heads off. They couldn't be Death Eaters could they? They seemed too happy. We probably were looking at the wrong guy. Voldemort grandson wouldn't look like that.
Percy punched me in the arm. "Ow."
"I demand you to stand up and start singing... hm... the duck song. And dance."
That's all I could think.
"No don't Jackson me! And Harry? I've heard how cruel you are to him! Are you just trying to protect him too?"
"The who of the what now?"
Blue cookies!
The next page was decorated with pictures of Percy and another girl. She was pretty, I'm not going to lie. She had blonde, princess curls and startling gray eyes with tanned skin.
"Ginny, you're only saying that because you think he's hot!" Accused Ron.
"More like a puppy."
"You little!"
"No, but..."
His mother finally came into the living room, "Good evening, I'm Sally Blofis. And you are?" She said while shaking hands.
"Thanks, but I'm planning to move in with my godfather, I just got him back."
"Well, seems like I got myself in some trouble. Well, to be exact I didn't get myself in trouble, more like trouble found me." I sighed. Why does this always happen?
Then he slipped, his legs giving out underneath him.
"Well," said Fred, clapping his hands together, "can't stand around chatting all day, we've got business to discuss with Lee. See you later,"and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right.
"And a sorceress turned me into a guinea pig."
"Yes, Professor Umbridge," rang through the room. Oh Merlin, we sounded like absolute zombies.
"How did you do that?" Asked the twins in union.
"Aren't those the same exact lines as last time. When I was stuck between a huge drop and fighting you?"
"I like my privacy. My mind, my rules you know? I can't imagine sharing my mind with someone. That's like sharing a toothbrush. I don't want to share my-"
"No, just go. It's fine." Ginny jumped up to hug me then ran off, not looking back.
"Nice." I said.
We boarded our magical transport, Ron with a bag after last time, and left to a magical kingdom. Or the next town over works too.
"No thanks." We said together "Im more of a redvines guy"
I was the only one left in the room.
"Well, let's go!" I said and made my way towards the house. I turned around to see everyone staring at me. What, did I have something on my face?
I saw a picture of them kissing underwater, kissing on a train, snuggling and kissing under a mistletoe. There was a lot of kissing and holding hands. A lot of the pictures were painted.
The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist length, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look. The girl gave off anaura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that she was reading a magazine upside down. Her eyes rested on me and she nodded.
I blinked at him repeatedly to get across the point that I did not, in fact, have a list. I didn't know there was a list. You'd think that since there's only one magic school in all of the UK that school supply shops would just know what you need. Since it's just one list. You know? But of course, wizards I was beginning to realize, were a little slow on the uptake.
━━━━━━━☆☆━━━━━━━
My mom opened the door and upon seeing that it was me, led me to the dinner table to have a feast in my honor. Blue food was everywhere.
"He reminds me a lot of my dog, Mrs. O'Leary. Well, she's not really my dog, she just shows up with Nico sometimes."
We were a smudge away from dying when something extraordinary happened. A billion shots fired from the sky, vaporizing the army. I knew who it was right away.
"Hmm?"
Hermione came hurrying into the room just as I was putting on my pants. Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms.
I headed up the creaky stairs and knocked on the door. From where I stood I could smell what I guessed was cinnamon buns baking in the oven. Nothing had changed, everything seemed exactly the same as I had left it six months ago. Nothing changed, except me.
She nodded and beckoned for the wizards to follow her but they wouldn't move.
Percy snorted and the girl shifted her gaze to him.
"It's my first year here at Hogwarts, I'm looking for a wand?" It felt stupid coming out of my mouth.
"Well I'm glad Harry now has someone experienced to look up to. His life has been shy of good role models."
"No, I meant..." She started but Ron cut her off.
"Thanks, my friend Racheal made it. She painted those pictures."
"Oh," I tried to hide my bitterness. "That's fine."
"Nice to meet you all. I'm here to help with this hearing." Piper said smiling.
"How about I help you prepare breakfast." I smiled, grabbing some 'ingredients' for pancakes. Surprisingly they had blue food coloring.
"Harry, no!" Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at my sleeve, but I jerked my arm out of her reach.
"Dean Thomas."
"Mom, I'll call Blackjack and his friends. Hurry!"
"I'll miss you too, WiseGirl." Said the guy and they hugged. They looked about seventeen or eighteen.
I scowled. "Perseus Jackson, you really are a wonderful person. Your camp director told me a lot of wonderful things about you." Said Dumbledore and I was not a happy camper.
I decided to play nice after accusing them of trying to murder me. Atleast I didn't uncap Riptide you know. They probably took me for a lunatic, but better a lunatic than a lunatic with a sword. That stuff could get you arrested.
Severus patted me on the back sympathetically and Dumbledore cleared his throat. "How about introductions."
"Think of it like being held back."
What he said made no sense at all. He was talking in codes again! Me, Ron and Hermione whipped out our wands but Dumbledore waved them away.
Percy either didn't think the hug was a big deal, or pretended it wasn't.
"Long Island, New York." He said after swallowing some lamb stew. "This is delicious, Mrs. Weasley."
"What about Jim?" Asked my mom, confused. Jim died in a plane crash a while back.
to worry about now that he's in charge. Death Breath and Sparky have to help their fathers with things... Owl Face went to Boston and McShizzle's with Calypso. They said something about a repair shop."
"Too much adventures for my liking." Finished Piper, laughing. "Just give me a break. Now excuse us, Harry, when you're done come up to your room. We need to talk about this Hearing."
Not a trace of red, to be seen.
"This is Perseus Jackson, he's going to be Harry's bodyguard." Said Dumbledore. This was met with yells of outrage.
"I need to go Percy, promise me you'll be alright and keep yourself out of trouble."
PERCY'S DAM BLUE, GREEK YOGURT PANCAKES.
"Come on, I need to tell mum or else she'll kill me." Said Ron.
"So, what are you here for? Can't say I've ever seen you around?"
"You're Harry Potter."
"If you want to come with us-" Percy started but I cut him off. "I'll come."
"Percy, I'd like to talk to you." He called from the other side of the door.
"Come, I'll take you to your room." Said Remus, looking at Piper weirdly. He reached for Pipers bag but I stopped his hand. "I'll take it, she probably filled it with rocks."
All the cookies.
1⁄2 teaspoon of salt. Why are monsters so salty?
"Oh, sorry about the wand. I'm sure it's not broken."
She looked me in the eyes and smiled. "You should have told me you were coming, I would have made something for you. How about you go to your room and rest while I make your favorite? All right?"
"You received a warning from the Ministry for using magic three years ago did you not?"
I faked a laugh and put Riptide back in my pocket where she belonged.
There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what I heard as I dressed at top speed, Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs with the result of hurtling them  straight into Ginny and knocking her down two flights of stairs into the hall.
"Yes, because —"
"Thank you Perseus."
I unrolled the scroll, the paper felt ancient. It had a nice smell to it, like roses in the spring. On the inside there was a hologram. It looked like an Iris message but instead of talking at the same time, it was recorded and sent.
-"He's Voldemort grandson!"
"Explain please how you're going to kill me. You had a lot of time three months ago." I said. I was trying to give the wizards time but they wouldn't move.
Percy's green tie jumped out in the army of red and yellow. Everyone went silent, after all, mingling wasn't allowed at Hogwarts.
"You cast some kind of protective barrier around my mother and step-father. I don't want them to get hurt."
"How about some help over here?" It was Mrs. Weasley.
8 ounces of Greek yogurt, best if made by Hermes himself.
"Now talk." Said Piper, "Give me all the facts, everything that happened that night."
"Not about the chapter, no," said Hermione.
Snape put us all into pairs and set us to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak like Dracula, watching us weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticising everyone. I got partnered up with some Slytherin first year who I didn't know.
When we entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, we found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher's desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head. I couldn't help but think of a large fly perched on top of an even larger toad.
I sucked in my breath. He was planning on killing someone! That's more proof he's a murderer! I knew it!
"Like real, punch and kick fighting."
There was a short pause.
At this, Morgan stood up, her hand stretching towards the dungeon ceiling.
"All okay," he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. "Don't think we were followed. . . ."
I dare you might have been the wrong choice of words seeing as how the next thing he did is kick Harry.
"Grab your bags and hold onto my arm." Said Dumbledore. I looked at him strangely but did as he said, but not before hugging my mom.
The moth-eaten velvet curtains had flown apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, I thought I was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she was being tortured — then I realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, I had ever seen in my life.
Fun! Those elves must be having the time of their lives.
And here I was, thinking they were innocent. Who's Hades! What's IMing? It's code names again. It probably meant something like, don't forget to kill the spare or the Dark Lord will find out. But why were they so cheerful then?
"Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr....?"
Immediately I reached for Riptide but didn't uncap it yet. "Who sent you?" I asked. "I know you're here to kill me, blah blah blah so get on with it, but please, before you depart for Tartarus, tell me what other great and powerful entity I have to deal with." I couldn't seem to catch a break.
"I said I had a plan Piper! Gods."
Severus started laughing which seemed to surprised everyone even more.
Jackson?" He sneered, his blonde hair longer than usual and about as messy as Percy's.
"How did you know?" They asked at the same time, more pleased than shocked.
I thought. "Yeah. Whatever."
"COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS!"
Everyone fell silent when they walked into the room.
"Tut, tut," said Professor Umbridge. Why did she say it like that? "That won't do, now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply 'Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.' One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!"
I laughed. Fred and George would really like the twins. Maybe one day when all of this was over, they could meet.
Blue cookies!
na na na na na na na na na na na na
"Well then, I'm afraid you are not qualified to decide what the 'whole point' of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —"
"Just Percy please." He said. "So, I'll go pack my stuff."
After telling Mrs. Weasley that we were going somewhere, we went into the living room where Percy and Piper were already waiting.
"Hey Beauty Queen." I said. Then I noticed she was crying. "What's the matter?"
"Jackson."
"Really? Because that's not what I was told-"
"Because, Gryffindors are dirty muggle lovers." Said Pansy.
"Oh fine!" Mrs. Weasley shouted, rolling her eyes dramatically. I started to understand where Percy got his attitude from. "But be it on your own head."
"I don't know what your problem is, but you need to get over it! I didn't even know I was a wizard until a few days ago! How could I be working with my evil grandfather if I didn't even know about him!"
Cedric's face changed shape and started to resemble something more... Weasley.
"Stop." Laughed Piper after the hundredth repeat. "You still doubt that I could convince these wizards to let Harry go?" She asked, a smirk was playing on her face.
I always loved vigilantes!
Whoever kills an innocent life may as well have killed themselves and all of humanity
"And a dude with one eye that had very ugly sheep."
"Good Morning Molly, Harry." I called as I made my way towards Mrs. Weasley. "What's cooking?"
"Very well," said Fudge. "The accused being present — finally —let us begin. Are you ready?" he called down the row.
Severus rummaged around in his bag and took a piece of parchment out.
"I DID IT BECAUSE OF THE DEMENTORS!"
The Pegasus whined something and Percy burst out laughing.
They we already in there, talking in hushed voices but when they saw me, they stopped immediately.
I nodded at Hermione and she went to drag Ron into the little kitchen/living room where the hunters were.
"I insist Harry, Molly keeps adopting more and more children and this is the least I can do for them."
"Wow!" Exclaimed Hermione, "I thought those were extinct."
"Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August," said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, "into offenses committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging,Surrey. Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic;Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Under secretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —"
"Naw," said George popping a chocolate frog into his mouth, "they have too much humor to be Death Eaters."
""Is it a good one?" Asked Piper and I turned around to stare at her.
I didn't understand why they never let me finish a single sentence. I looked up at Piper and Dumbledore but neither met my gaze.
"Like I said, my family is already messed up."
"Weasley." Finished two identical twins at the same time. I think they're twins, you never know. The Stolls aren't twins and they look identical.
I was just trying to be nice. I felt bad for him, really. I couldn't imagine what it felt like to be locked away from the outside world. But apparently kindness is something Mr. Serious couldn't appreciate.
Hermione looked deep in thought as we went down for breakfast the next day. She kept shooting glances at Piper across the table.
"How exactly are you going to help Harry?" Asked Sirius glaring at Piper.
"Oh excuse me." Lupin pointed at one of the beds, muttered some weird words that I didn't get and with a pop! another bed popped out of thin air.
"Do you have your list?"
"Harry, it's not. I had an abusive step father once too, and its not
"Thanks."
"I doubt it."
"Well he's you boyfriend and I'm guessing the old fallen ghosty kings will want the best for their sister in law."
"I'm going to miss you Seaweed Brain," Annabeth said, leaning in for a quick kiss on the cheek.
I turned to page five of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read. It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns.I felt my concentration sliding away from me and after a few minutes I realized I had read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. Paragraph after paragraph of swirling words that didn't make much sense. At least Hermione was enjoying herself, she probably had gotten through half the book already.
She stopped.
I burst out laughing. The best thing was Sirius' dancing. It was brilliant, bloody brilliant as the brits would say. He was getting down low, shaking that rear end. He was an awesome dancer I gotta admit.
I came out into the living room where my other bags were, still packed from my time at Camp Half-Blood. Ron, Hermione and Harry were talking in hushed voices but when I came in, they stopped. Probably talking about me.
We had a nice welcome party.
"Can you blame me Arthur?" Mrs. Weasley hit him on the behind with a spatula. Something I wish to erase from my memory. "Every child deserves a good family."
In case you want to try my fabulous cooking, I'll tell you my recipe. Aboard the Argo II, pancakes have become my specialty. I call them
"Yes," I was starting to get angry, "but I only used it because we were —"
-And George."
"How are you Harry?" Asked Hermione five minutes later as she caught us walking across the commons room.
Still in awe, it was Severus' cold voice that knocked me out of my trance.
Silence.
"BLOODY HELL! HARRY DID YA SEE THAT! IT WAS BLOODY MAD! BLOODY MONSTERS! DID YA PUT FIRE-WHISKEY IN MY FOOD! BLOODY HELL!"
"You killed them!" I accused.
"Gross" Nico smiled.
I burst out laughing. "Like you weren't."
"We talked with them and they told us all these stories about a summer camp they go to and all the pranks they've pulled on the other campers." Continued Fred.
I grabbed Santa's arm in one hand and my bags in the other, one second I see my mother waving then I was surrounded by light. It was a lot like shadow traveling but shocker! I wasn't surrounded by shadows. Like you couldn't have already guessed that.
"Impressive," said the witch, staring down at me, "a true Patronus at that age . . . very impressive indeed." The witches and wizards around her broke out into a chorus of voices.
"Ummm," How was I? That was a good question that I honestly didn't know the answer to. I felt almost numb, as if everything that had happened in the past week was nothing more than a dream. "I'm fine. A little nervous I guess."
"Wait you don't remember last night?" He ducked as a red light flew straight towards his face and missed him by a whisker. "WATCH IT LEE!"
Ron and Hermione looked at me like I was crazy.
Then, a big looming form emerged and charged at me.
"Sorry."
I took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not even looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the classroom door shut behind me. I was fuming.
"Chill man, happens to the best of them. I still remember when Frank was flying with me for the first time."
"So, you're supposed to help this Harry guy." Said Piper. We were out running, sitting stuck in a mansion is not good for my ADHD.
She was right. There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
"Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn't it?" stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. "The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year. You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please." I was already falling asleep.
"Oh hello!" said a voice coming from behind a stack of little boxes. I tried to find the person who it belonged to but there was no one in sight. As soon as I turned around however, a small old man with great bug pale eyes was behind me. I couldn't help but to reach for Riptide.
"What do you want now, Jackson?" He was reading some book with a skull on the front. That was all I needed to know.
Frank is turning into a crazy dolphin." Frank finally understood what was going on.
Everyone was silent, even the other portraits.
The scroll bound back together.
I climbed up the stairs, looking for my new room. During the whole debate with Sirius, Dumbledore had stayed silent. Now he was looking at me with a curious intent. He knew about Chiron and Camp Half-Blood but, how much did he know exactly?
"That was something." Said Dumbledore, I forgot he was there.
Everyone ignored her and we went to mine and Ron's room. Percy was mumbling something under his breath. I heard the words
We had finally got to the very last carriage. I turned towards Percy, "Everything is full."
"I'm Greek."
"No, no, it's not the toilet, it's the Potter boy's hearing — they've changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o'clock now and it's down in old Courtroom Ten —"
I flipped through the pages. The names would change and so would the theme.
The class was quiet as
"Ah, just a little gift I have." She smiled.
"Why would be tell you that?" Said Ron, glaring at Percy.
"I mean, it worked for the Guardian of the Galaxy." I said slowly.
"You can always come live with me." I smiled, I was already imaging Harry with the Stolls, introducing them to those Wizarding Weasley gadgets.
CRASH
"Oh you read my mind. Can you wizards read minds?"
"Apparation."
"What do you mean that monster has a grandson!" I roared, jumping to my feet.
"Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge," we chanted back at her. It was like kindergarten all over again.
The legal mumbo jumbo and exposition was over with, it was time to get some real adventure into my system. To see some magic!
I knew they were poisonous so I didn't take any when he offered all though Dumbledore did. I really don't know why he's trusting this Death Eater!
"Ya, who am I to deny a hug to someone who really need one."
"Oh Kelp Head," she sobbed, "Repair Boy's returned! We've got a message. He came back with Calypso and Festus!"
When I mean "a ride" I mean we flew about 30 seconds and Ron threw up.
"Harry, I know that you're angry..." started Dumbledore but I cut him off.
to worry about now that he's in charge. Death Breath and Sparky have to help their fathers with things... Owl Face went to Boston and McShizzle's with Calypso. They said something about a repair shop."
I don't wanna be a duck so I shake my butt.
Thankfully I had finished my breakfast and got out of there as fast as I could. I darted up the stairs and practiced what I would say to the jury with Hermione and Piper before Mr. Weasley told us it was time to go.
"Hey there, is anyone else sitting here?" He gestured to the seats across from the girl.
"I'M WAITING FOR YOU LOT!" yelled Mrs. Weasley from the kitchen. Hermione helped me quickly pack all my robes and books into a suitcase.
"What do you think! That little spawn of evil is a Death Eater!"
"See, Harry get it. If that's what it takes, we should at least try."
"I don't know, it's just what Mad-Eye says," said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch. "But if we don't leave soon we're definitely going to miss the train. . . ."
"Experience." I said simply.
I leaned against my chair to see who it had belonged to. At the end of the first row bench sat Ron's older brother, Percy. I looked at him expecting some form of recognition but none came. He stared down the piece of parchment under his nose, the quill in his right hand slightly trembling.
"You ready Percy?"
back to when I was 12." I shuddered at the memory of killing Medusa.
"Jackson, if you survive tell Jason I love him."
I started spraying at random. I'm not a child of Apollo nor a Hunter of Artemis so my accuracy wasn't the best but I managed.
The room had a gloomy feeling to it. It had a high ceiling and three twin beds. Two trunks already lay next to two of the beds, with their contents thrown all over. Drew would not approve.
Dumbledore knocked on the door and that same boy answered the door, he studied us looking bewildered. Ha! He knew why we were here!
I swallowed a lump forming in my throat. "Yes, but — "
"Sirius, you shouldn't be calling him evil because of his parentage. You're a perfect example yourself, you turned out to be the exact opposite of the Black family. I know Percy's the same." Dumbledore said calmly.
Mrs. Weasley ran over to me and took my hands in hers. "It's okay child, you can calm down. Let your guard down. No one else here blames you for being born into the wrong family." There was a kindness in her eyes and she reminded me so much of my mother. I took a deep breath and the rage dissappeared. The water pressure was back to normal. "You're just another victim of this war."
"We're eating down in the kitchen," Mrs. Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. "Dears, if you'll just tiptoe across the hall, it's through this door here —"
"No, my sword is special. It doesn't kill them, just sends them to prison. But they always come back."
"Just Percy please." I said. "So, I'll go pack my stuff."
━━━━━━━☆☆━━━━━━━
The werewolf guy ran over to Sirius. He whispered something to him but he was a lousy whisperer.
Course aims:
"No we haven't," Hermione said, "we just..."
"Look at today!" groaned Ron. "History of Magic, double Potions,Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns,Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! This is going to be the worst Monday ever!"
"Why should I believe that you're not another one sent to kill me?" I sighed, raising an eyebrow.
Ron kissed his mom goodnight on the cheek and followed Harry up the stairs to their shared room. Hermione followed not far behind.
A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform started hurrying onto the train.
Something patted me on the back. It was Mr. Weasley.
They're everywhere I see.
"Oh great, this place brings back great memories." I spit as we landed right in front of Privet Drive.
"Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!" Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from her.
"I'm a doctor." The son of Apollo replied kissing his boyfriend on the lips.
"Daughter of who?" Asked Ron with an accusing glare.
She looked surprised that I was talking to her, even a little fearful. Then I remembered about yesterday. How I made the sink explode and the Earth tremble.
Severus was an ass but at Camp Half-Blood he was at least nice ass. He really was a good guy under all his assery. But not here. His eyes were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. I realized that the man who I considered my friend had transformed into a completely different person. Severus and Snape. Was that going to happen to me if I stayed here too long?
Immediately he reached in to his pocket, he had to be taking out his wand. "Who sent you?" he asked warily. "I know you're here to kill me, blah blah blah so get on with it, but please, before you depart for Tartarus, tell me what other great and powerful entity I have to deal with."
Everyone turned to me, the staring made me uncomfortable.
Back at Nico's Dream Palace he acted, like what a hero would act. Confident, brave I guess, and your generic "Chosen One" package.
"Don't flatter yourself Kelp Head. You just ruined the moment, congrats."
"Perseus Jackson. Most people call me Percy." He handed me another stick which sent some papers on the shopkeepers desk flying.
Wait, why were the monsters waiting for the trio to leave before attacking us. We all could have been dead long ago.
"Lemme throw that son of a Minotaur out of that window one more time! Oh Uncle Hades! Here comes Vernon Dursley!"
"How did he survive tho?"
Ron groaned and Harry snarled at me, "Follow me."
Percy and Piper were telling a story to Fred, George and Ginny but the whole table was listening.
Oh the memory brought joy to my face. Macho Frank, puking off of Blackjack, then turning to a small adorable little puppy, and falling off. Oh you should have seen it. Hilarious I tell ya.
"Oh this, it's a scrapbook." He said, surprised that I was talking to him. I was surprised too but what he said before, kind of gave me a different perspective on him.
Severus started the class by taking attendance but like at the Sorting Ceremony, he skipped over my name until the end. Come on, don't tell me wizards messed up the alphabet too! J is in the middle not the end!
"We're not here to fight, we just want to talk." He said. Something about his voice was calming but I wasn't ready to take any chances. Old grandpa or not, if I found out he was part of another plot to inconvenience me orchestrated by the gods themselves, it would be on sight for ol' Gandalf here.
"During the whole time, Leo had broken everyone's bounds and supplied weapons. The pirate crew ran away in terror and seeing as he was surrounded, Golden Dude ran away and jumped into the sea where he probably drowned."
"No I'm sure. I have to call my girlfriend anyway before she gets mad." I smiled. I really couldn't wait to see Annabeth again. Even if it was just through a hologram, seeing her storm born eyes could turn any bad day around for the better. She truly was the best of me.
I capped Riptide and turned around to see the wizards looking at me from my bedroom door. Dumbledore was smiling ear to ear but the rest had their mouths hanging open.
He straightened my collar as I took a few deep breaths. "Alright — Harry and Piper in, Perseus," He pointed at an old crusty bench. "Sit."
Then things got a little crazy.
I didn't see the snow shovel until Harry was on the ground. Vernon was pulling him by his ear and yelling at his unconscious body. Too bad Vernon didn't see Riptide until she was in full form and at his neck.
"Hi, Angelina."
And guess what.
"Sorry about Sirius, he's just worried about the whole Voldemort thing and wants to blame someone." I said with fake sympathy. Mrs. Weasley made me and Ron go apologize to Percy for what Sirius said.
Santa cleared his throat, "So, we're here to take Percy to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. He needs to be kept safe now that Voldemort might try to get him."
I smirked. If I had taken the deal that the gods had offered me at the end of the Battle of Manhattan I would have for sure become the god of baking. I would use my godly powers to strike down anyone who didn't preheat their oven before putting stuff in it.
Fudge turned back around, an obvious smirk playing on his face. "As you can see, the defendant is obviously guilty. Case clo—"
"Well then,
It was like, I don't know, a barf rainbow, shooting out of Blackjacks behind.
"PERSEUS JACKSON!" She yelled. "NINE MONTHS AND ALL I HEAR IS ONE PHONE CALL THAT YOU'RE ON A QUEST IN SOME DISTANT LAND! DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED I WAS! CHIRON TOLD ME YOU WERE IN GREECE! FIGHTING DIRTFACE! ANOTHER ONE! JUST GREAT! THE TITAN WAR WAS BETTER THAN THIS! AND YOUR NOSEBLEED ALMOST CAUSED THE END OF THE WORLD! IF YOU'D BEEN CAREFUL THAT OLD PIECE OF SCHIST WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN WOKEN UP! AND THEN YOU STAY AN EXTRA MONTH!"
I stumbled on seemingly nothing. As Hermione and Ron held me steady I tried to gather my thoughts but again, everything felt fuzzy.
After the bell had rung and all the first years ran out of the dungeon, I stayed to talk to Snape.
"Actually you're right."
2.Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic can legally be used.
Percy seemed lost deep in thought for a second. "Hmm, and what happened at Privet Drive?"
"Bloody hell." Muttered Ron.
"So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he?" I asked, my voice shaking. I knew what I saw.
"Harry darling, come and sit. You're going to need a lot of energy today and I have the perfect solution for that." Her solution was a whole royal breakfast. My skinny ass could not.
━━━━━━━☆☆━━━━━━━
"Bloody hell, we were worried 'bout you mate." Ron popped a chocolate frog into his mouth.
I ran out of the room, up the stairs, and into the girls room. Ron and Hermione were talking in hushed voices.
"-we're cleaning-"
Little bit harsh, don't you think.
He had to warn Harry. If there was anyone who could stop the oncoming darkness, it was the Boy Who Lived.
"That was nice, what you did for Harry."
He shook his head. "If you're looking for Snape he told me to tell you to meet him out front."
"Okay," I said as she smiled and departed.
-"My godson will not be in the company of this spawn of evil!"
But what I said was a little true, ish. I didn't lie about the killing innocent lives and planning to take over the world part. But the police, they didn't even know about the whole fiasco in New York.
Not far behind Percy was a man. A porter's cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks. He must have been the one who took Percy.
"That's good, you should be nervous. It means your minds working like it should." He smiled and ruffled my hair and I didn't really mind. He took his hand away and shoved it into his pocket.
I'm not in first grade."
"Or maybe..." Started Ginny but she was interrupted by Fred and George apparating into the room.
The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too.
"There, now," said Professor Umbridge sweetly. "That wasn't too difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please."
A what of what to who? I looked around the room. Thankfully everyone else looked stumped so I wasn't just stupid. Morgan's hand had shot into the air.
"What is it?" She asked, something weird in her eyes.
"Now, let me make a few things quite plain." Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward us, her stubby fingered hands splayed on her desk. "You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead..."
"Nice one," I said. I suspected that her pep talks wouldn't be as long as Woods which would be a lot nicer. He seemed to write an essay before each game.
"Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?" inquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice. That fucking badger.
"This is what Nyx's palace would look like after giants made a living in it." I muttered to myself but Hermione heard and gave me a strange look.
We arrived.
"I'm not lying!" I said loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court. This was starting to become to much. My head started spinning. "There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it."
To say I was shocked was an understatement. The wizard thing seemed normal but the fact that this guy, Albus, knew Chiron came as a total surprise. Chiron wasn't the kinda guy to horse paddle all the way across the Atlantic Ocean only to befriend a hippie.
"You know there are other ways right? Ways that don't include verbal abuse? Is Voldemort so scary that only your assery can scare him off and save us?"
"So we're not supposed to be prepared for what's waiting out there?"
"Well, I don't," said Hermione bluntly. "There's nothing written up there about using defensive spells."
By hundreds of thirsty looking beasts.
At that his eyes lit up. "Of course of course, I have something here that I think would be perfect for you."
"Greek, I'm dyslexic so everything written in English is then translated to Greek." I nodded.
"Oh go play with your chemistry set Severus! By the way, Bill Nye is a way better teacher than you! He would never treat his students like this!"
I shoved my wand back inside my bag and pulled out quill, ink, and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one (just like her), and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:
Hermione finally spoke up. "He doesn't want to go with you Malfoy, just leave him alone."
-"Stop judging him so harshly!"
"Tell me about it." Said Chiron, taking a seat in his wheelchair. So, I told him about the wizards.
The black dog returned again, wagging it's tail happily. It followed the Weasley's out the door. I looked back at Grimoire Place. Can't say I would miss it. I gave one final middle finger to ol Mrs. Black and closed the door behind me.
"Well, I think it's a pity we're not trying for a bit of inter-Houseunity," said Hermione crossly.
Honestly it was hilarious, I'm sorry.
"Harry."
"Do not accuse me without facts. Just because my grandfather was evil doesn't mean I am. Did you ever think that the small little boy in front of you has seen more blood shed and war than you ever had. Don't you think that small little boy has enough of it and just wants some peace." His voice was barely a whisper.
Nico gave me the idea after he saw it on Pinterest so I went out and bought a set. Whenever Annabeth or I were thinking about each other we could send a subtle but sweet message to the other. With a tap the other bracelet would light up and vibrate. It was pretty high tech so I was praying that it wouldn't blow up when Annabeth put it on her wrist. Chiron assured me that it was safe for demigods but then again he also told me that the gods didn't have anything against me and look how that turned out. I was a veteran of two wars at 17.
Finally I couldn't take it anymore, me, Ron and Hermione started talking about this Perseus Jackson. We stopped abruptly as he stepped back into the living room.
"Shut up Jackson." She said punching me in the arm.
"Fine." I said, pulling myself together, "I'll attend this PigFarts under one condition."
"Yes, but —"
I looked down at my clothes and touched my glasses and scar tenderly. "Really? Oh my, why didn't anyone ever tell me!"
"Just because we don't know many people from other houses doesn't mean we can't make friends. Who knows, they might be nicer than we suspect."
Finally, it was about to get interesting.
"Anyway... tell me what happened yesterday."
"Just now, we walked on them fighting."
For a while everyone was silent until Mrs. Weasley spoke up.
I couldn't stay mad at him long. After all he was doing it all to protect his godson. He was stressed and had no idea who to trust. War brings out the worst in all of us.
"I'm always right, Jackson."
"Guard? We have to go to King's Cross with a guard?"
I could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose. I looked at her questioningly, but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction.
Ginny rolled her eyes and got up. "I'm telling you guys, he's not. But does anyone listen to me around here."
"Eh, I can tell your kind apart. Had some experiences with your kind, they don't like me. I've learned to watch out."
"He's fine, you'll get to as him soon. But Pipes, I need help here."
"Come on Dumbledore! Do me this one favor! I can't let the boy face this alone!" The voice belonged to Sirius, the one who looked like a hobo.
And here she was, beautiful as ever. She was sitting on her bed reading a book about norse mythology. How would I know that if I'm dyslexic you ask. It was in Greek. Now that I think about it; it kinda funny. A Norse book, in Greek. No one. Just me? Okay.
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge's three course aims she said, "Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?"
"It can't be real." Said Hermione after a moment of silence. "It just can't be, you couldn't have looked into his memory that's for sure, and he never talked about anything like that so it can't be real. You must have just seen a picture of that girl and boy somewhere which then influenced your weird dream. That's the only explanation."
Cause blue food is for the occasion,
━━━━━━━☆Percy☆━━━━━━━
Snape sneered and looked down at me. "You got lucky on that one Jackson, let's hope luck can get you through my class. Remember, you're supposed to catch up to the fifth years. I doubt you could even pass this class in your whole Hogwarts... experience." He spoke in a slow monotone voice that made me think of the British male Siri voice.
-"And your from a family of Blacks!"
"It's okay Mr. Black, I'll look after him."
"Oh good," said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, "here's Alastor with the luggage, look . . ."
"Harry! How are you?"
"Then he gasped and pointed to the spot where Frank, another friend, was hiding. "Oh, no! Frank is turning into a crazy dolphin!" When nothing happened Percy repeated, "I
"I'm simply trying to steer my dear American friend on the right path. He's obviously misguided."
She smiled, "Sure SeaweedBrain. You'll like him, he's a lot like you. What did you call for?"
"So he does this normally?!"
While he was yelling at me while I tried to wipe it off with Ron's magic scarf, Porkpie couldn't stop laughing.
Voldemort had threatened his family if he didn't do exactly what he said. Even though he knew it was wrong, he couldn't just let his family die. They were the only ones left who truly loved him. His mother at least.
When I sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked rather threateningly but did not bind me. Feeling rather sick I looked up at the people seated at the bench above, where Piper had disappeared to.
"What do you mean..." Like a dam breaking open I remembered last night and quickly turned red.
"It's fine. I guess it's just me, Ginny, and Percy then. No worries."
"Harry."
I heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls.
"No, but —"
I didn't know what doxies were but I was pretty sure they weren't cute, fuzzy little animals. Like a poodle. Or Mrs. O'Leary.
I wanted to know too. My suspicions came back. That no good Death Eater! This is proof! He killed his grandfather.
Just a day in the life of a demigod.
"It's more of a fact that he's there." He said and left. His words sending chills down my spine.
True, I didn't trust them all the way but I really wanted to know what they were doing.
"That's great!" I said. "How did you manage to find the time to come though?"
"I repeat," said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, "do you expect to be attacked during my classes?"
"Ya well last time I checked I was your protector. Tell Dumbledore that Jason Grace is a fine piece of ass. He'll understand what it means."
I could see the small light in Percy's eyes had turned into a forest fire. The ground started to rumble and the sink exploded. Percy's voice was ice cold, slicing through me.
"What'd he say, mate?" Asked Ron.
Percy choked on his cookie. "What do you mean?" He asked warily. "It's been two years since he's been finally killed."
"Yes."
"Um, sure." Said Mrs. Weasley. "If you want, just don't get lost and come back for lunch."
By adventure I of course mean my school supply shopping.
"I'M FINE HERMIONE! MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!" I snapped, yanking my arm away from her. I didn't really know why I was so mad, I just was.
"So do I, but I still couldn't tell you exactly what..."
And without looking once at me, he swept from the dungeon.
"Definitely- a- Death Eater." Huffed Ron.
"Weasley," said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air and waving it around like a maniac.
"What tells me you're not here to kill me?" He sighed, raising an eyebrow. This kid was getting on my nerves. Was he trying to act innocent, because it won't work.
Molly used some kind of spell so that after I finished baking about fifteen batches, I could stack all of them together. 80 pancakes high! That left Harry dumbfounded, as well as anyone else who just so happened to walk in.
"Oh, I forgot you were raised in a world without magic like me!" Hermione started going on a rant, explaining different methods of magical transportation. Somehow she got to the topic of Hogwarts and when she started describing the dining room, Percy put up his hand to stop her.
It was the first time Dumbledore came around since he brought me here and he said that he had something important to say. For the first time, we were supposed to attend the Order of The Phoenix meeting. And it did not go well.
I could see pain in Harry's eyes. Dam I was really making the Chosen One emotional lately.
"If you want to yell at me some more, can it wait till morning? I'm really not feeling it right now."
Piper opened her bag and after a lot of looking around, she took out a scroll. "Here, open it."
"One more question, how's Kelli? Is she back yet, I'd really like to not fight her." I said.
"It's just... Snape. He's... Just be careful okay?"
The darkness pounced and just before it devoured him, the world turned upside down.
"Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!" trilled Professor Umbridge. "Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?" she added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.
"Er, well..." Hermione and Ron exchanged weird looks.
Piper stalked up to the front but someone stopped me as I tried to follow her. They turned me around and pointed to a chair in the middle of the room. The chair was covered with chains which I had seen spring to life and bind the person sitting in it in Dumbledore's memory.
I was on my way, sulking to my bed when I heard a knock on my door.
Harry, Hermione and Ron looked at me with big eyes and then I noticed that I said something wrong. "Wait, you didn't mean my fathers side did you?" Old grandpa shook his head.
The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or me.
A shimmering image of the centaur appeared. He was having a conversation with a satyr but when he saw me he dismissed him. Poor guy, I didn't want to seem more important than him.
"Well, actually."
Something smelled fishy and it wasn't yesterday's lunch. Dumbledore seemed like the good guy, after all how evil could a grandpa in a white beard be. But what Snape had said really didn't sit well with me. I knew better than anyone that nothing was ever black and white, but I couldn't believe that Dumbledore had a mean bone in his body. No. I did believe it. It was for Harry's sake that I didn't
"Dementors in Little Whinging?" The witch said in surprise. "I don't understand —"
"I meant Annabeth, but tell Jason too, and Grover."
"Stheno, the Bargain Mart was a front! You're going native! Now, put down that ridiculous tray and help me kill this demigod." Sneered Euryale.
For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto its hind legs and placed its front paws my shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley shoved me away toward the train door hissing, "For heaven's sake act more like a dog, Sirius!"
Nonetheless, I wasn't looking for a fight. I've had enough of those.
My first lesson was with Severus. Thank the gods, someone I knew.
"I don't trust them but Percy has a weapon. We have to sneak in there."
Morgan stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but I was confident in this one. After all, I was the son of Poseidon.
"Anyway, nice talking to you Hermione. I'm going to go find out when Snape wants to take me shopping." I jumped up to my feet and dipped out of the room. When I was running down the stairs I bumped into Harry who would have gone tumbling down had I not caught him.
"You know, when I first met you, I couldn't understand what Annabeth saw in you. Now however..."
"Mrs. Weasley's patched her up," said Hermione. "But now MadEye's complaining that we can't leave unless Sturgis Podmore's here,otherwise the guard will be one short."
It was all a dream.
"What do you mean
We had almost unloaded Moody's luggage cartwhen Fred, George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin.
"Harry!"
And we were charged.
We struggled off down the corridor,peering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments we passed, which were already full. I couldn't help but notice that a lot of people stared back at me with great interest and that several of them even nudged their neighbors and pointed me out. After I had met this behavior in five consecutive carriages I remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lyingshow-off I was.
"Harry are you okay? You seem..."
"It's okay WiseGirl. Take a breath. You'll find him, and as for your uncle he's a piece of schist. When you find Magnus, do you think I could meet him?"
"Ah Harry, that goes
"Percy!" But I was already gone, and I was fuming.
going to help Harry?"
A stumpy little man ran up to Mr. Weasley. He was sweating. "Oh Arthur!" he said desperately, without looking at Harry."Thank goodness, I didn't know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not, I've just sent an owl to your home but you've obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —"
"How would you know I'd be their sister in law?"
━━━━━━━☆☆━━━━━━━
"Last time I checked he was my boyfriend not yours. I swear, Nico is straighter than you two."
"I'd forgotten Wood had left," said Hermione vaguely, sitting downbeside Ron and pulling a plate of toast toward her. "I suppose that willmake quite a difference to the team?"
Gandalf happily took one, but the three younger children didn't want any. So you're really gonna refuse my baking? I see the type of person you are.
We talked more about Percy until Mrs. Weasley called us down for dinner. As we went downstairs, I saw Mrs. Weasley, Tonks and Lupin sealing the door. The others must have just left.
"Sir, do you mind if we park here?"
"Oh thanks, his name is Siriu.... Puddle. Sir Puddles." I looked around but no one seemed to have caught my mistake.
"Do you really think the Evil Lord cares about a few Muggles? If he wanted Harry, he would even attack him in the restroom." Hermione said as she struggled to pick Ron up from the floor.
"They're not poisonous, see." He said stuffing one in my mouth. Reluctantly I took one and started nibbling at it. Eyes widening in surprise.
"The point," Hermione pressed on loudly, "is that this sort of thingis exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who'sonly been back two months, and we've started fighting among ourselves. The only way to defeat his is to stand together,be united..."
━━━━━━━☆☆━━━━━━━
"What? Oh!" I looked up from where I was washing dishes with a giant water fist.
"WHAT!" Screeched Sirius.
"Ya well, in America they're pretty common. I didn't know I was a wizard but I knew I could do magic stuff when I lost control. And somehow I learned how to talk to horses."
I went downstairs for breakfast, Harry and Molly were the only ones up.
Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She was staring at me with the most shit eating grin on her face.
I took Riptide out of my pocket, I was hoping to avoid a fight. That sort of thing would be investigated by the neighbors but alas, no!
"I believe."
"We decided this would give you a warm, welcoming feeling." Said Stheno before adding, "Have a Cheese 'n' Wiener."
Oh this was gonna be good, I could feel myself wanting to stand up and start singing but Pipers voice was directed at Sirius. Immediately he stood up. And...
I could hear them coming.
Dumbledore cleared his throat, "So, we're here to take Percy to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. He needs to be kept safe now that Voldemort might try to get him."
"Hmm, let's think . . ." I said mockingly, "maybe Lord Voldemort?"
Dean stood up and raised his hand but before Professor Umbridge even looked at him he already yelled out, "Look at him, he's not making it up!"
"So, what does the letter look like? Do you have it? Can I see?" I asked eagerly.
"Oh really? How peculiar, peculiar indeed." He started circling me like a vulture. He reminded me of that weasel guy from Frozen that tried to kill Elsa. No not Hans, the other one.
"Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!" he roared, seizing the curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned.
"Oh? I..." Now this was a pickle. "I guess I got mad and my magic made it move?" Then again I was a wizard, wasn't I supposed to do weird, unexplainable things.
-"Sirius Black."
But she was pretty.
That was his only thought. He had to get away as fast as he could.
Me and Ron jumped up.
"What is it?" Santa asked.
Mrs. Weasley looked at him sadly. "Are you sure child? We'd love to have you here."
The new girl, Piper, was pretty. I've got to admit that. The way her hair was braided with feathers and her eyes changed color. But I didn't like the way she charmed Sirius. Perseus claims he never knew about magic and here comes his friend, obviously cursing Sirius.
"Whatever you like," said Sirius indifferently.
"Come on-"
"I doubt you've never realized you were different. Is blowing up toilets just a normal thing that happens in America? No. I reckon you've been working with the Dark Lord this whole time and hide behind your "I'm only 17" mask." The faucet was now flowing.
"I brought Hedwig for you," the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage, "are you ready yet?"
"So, that means you've got to start from the basics. Can't throw you into the deep end if you don't even know what water is." Severus had a point. But I didn't like it so I decided to ignore it.
"Yeah but if standing together means getting along with Slytherin, there's a fat chance of it ever happening."
"Can Hermione and Ron come?"
-"His grandson is VOLDEMORT!"
"Calm down Harry, can't you see we're on your side." Said Ron, ears turning as red as his hair.
He couldn't help it. He started to cry.
"Ah, remember child, you don't have the Curse of Achilles anymore. It's going to be beautiful when we rip you to shreds!" Sneered Euryale. I decided not to point out that they didn't have their patron anymore.
Everyone stared at us with surprise and obvious discomfort. Harry and Ron were glaring at us but I just shrugged it off. They were probably jealous of my super awesome best friend.
"Thing is, he was crazy in the head. He claimed that he was the legendary 'Chrysaor' from Greek Mythology so I used that as an advantage. I learned a lot about Greek legends in school so I told him that our captain was Dionysus. In the myth of Chrysaor, him and his team captured the god Dionysus and tried to rob him, this ended in Dionysus turning them all into dolphins.
"Oh bullshit. You're being an ass and acting like you don't know me. Do you suffer from dementia or some other wizard crap?"
"Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen?"
"Have you ever been to Hogwarts?"
I was greeted with not many friendly faces when I turned around. Oh! I forgot about introductions.
You know, I always wished us half-bloods could use phones. It would be so much easier to just call Annabeth and leave her a message instead of making a sacrifice to the goddess of rainbows everytime I wanted to talk to my girlfriend.
Around the table sat people. Not as much people as a counselors meeting would hold in the Bog House but there were still people. Hm, wonder what's going on at camp right about now.
"Bye!" The black haired dudes yell brought me back to the ground as the truck sped off. I swear I saw a zombie driving. Oh well, I don't think I had enough sleep.
He cut me off. "Flew on what?"
"There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter."  Doubt.
"He doesn't seem like one, he seems.... kind." Said Ginny.
"See you!" I called out of the open window as the train began to move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was gone.
"Guys I'm right here." I said, startling them.
The problem was that I didn't know where my class was and no one was around to guide me. I tried to summon the spirit of Hermes to help me out but sadly it didn't work like that. Finally after much wandering around I figured out that potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons.
-"Molly Weasley."
"To get to the point, we're here to talk about your mothers side." Said Gandalf.
"It is NOT a lie!" I yelled. "I saw him, I fought him!"
"Well, I don't know what to tell you but it sounds bad for the wizards. Sure you could probably take out Voldemort quickly but I think there's a prophecy involved."
"My uncle, I think something happened to him." I couldn't explain it. Even though it had only happened yesterday, my mind seemed foggy. Almost as if a certain
"Uh! I don't understand why we have to all be separated like this. It's stupid. It's not like You-Know-Who is going to attack us in the middle of the street." Ron leaned against his cart but it slid away and he fell right on his arse.
"Whotcha mean by that?" I was starting to feel dizzy. I knew damn well what happened last night. I got into a fight with Seamus and then went to sleep. That's it. End of story.
Once the important people were seated, Sirius, Remus, Tonks and Arthur, I decided to mention Piper's visit.
"What do you mean 'what Annabeth saw in me' Hazel thought I was a Roman god in disguise." He laughed.
When we walked in, the court was alive with voices but as soon as the door swung closed behind Piper, an eerie silence fell.
In the middle of the bench sat Cornelius Fudge,  the Minister of Magic. The last time I had seen him, he was wearing a bright green bowler hat but he seemed to have disposed of it today for a wizards hat. On one side of his sat Piper, her hair in two braids she smiled warmly at me. On the other side of Fudge sat a witch but her face was covered in shadows. I gulped. She did not give me the same warm smile Piper had.
"Yoooou!" she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man. "Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!"
Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. I, however, stood up. I really should think before I act. Everyone was staring at me; Seamus looked half-scared, half-fascinated.
"Don't forget to IM me or else I will kick your sorry butt to Hades and back!" Threatened the blonde.
"We should hurry, I don't know why they're here but it can't be good." I wasn't worried, I just didn't want to answer questions.
"Young Perseus will explain, but know we should probably knock and ask to see this Perseus.
We landed.
So I told them all about the dementor attack. They listened intently and didn't interrupt. After I finished they gave each other this weird look of concern, but it vanished so quickly I didn't know if it was real.
Piper then continued the story. "While Golden Dude was trying to restore order to his crew, miraculously a dolphin jumped up onto our deck. I saw it and signaled to Percy and my friend Leo who's really good with mechanics. Percy then shouted at the pirates. "Save yourselves!" He warned. "It is too late for us!"
"Hand, Mr. Potter!" sang Professor Umbridge. I thrust my fist back in the air. Umbridge promptly turned away from me again, but now several other people had their hands up too.
I stopped. I might have gotten a little off topic.
No one stood up.
"Sorry about yesterday." I said, I wanted to have these people trust me after all.
"Well, if that doesn't happen, see you in the Underworld."
"You're taking it surprisingly well." Said the ginger, eyeing me suspiciously.
An old, plump lady hurried out into the hall. "Oh, you must be Jackson, it's wonderful to see you." She whispered.
"I'll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore," said Moody. "That's the second time he's not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as Mundungus."
"Harry! We're going to be late!"
-"CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT IS HAPPENING!"
"— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore," said a quiet voice from behind me. I whipped my head around so fast, I practically broke my spine.
"Oh, this is Piper McLean, daughter of A-" I stopped, an elbow was jammed straight into my rib cage.
na na na na na na na na na na na na
"We're not going to use magic?" Ron said loudly.
"I said shut up!" Roared Sirius but the lady wouldn't shut up.
━━━━━━━☆Harry☆━━━━━━━
"How can you tell? You were mending Harry?"
I was half right. I could feel, literally feel all the weapons in Pipers bag.
"Calm down, if I'm going to go to this hearing I need to know all the facts." He said calmly but I could see a small fire of anger in his eyes.
━━━━━━━☆Harry☆━━━━━━━
"And the ninja ladies."
I drew the Disney Channel logo and the stick flew out of my hand and stuck to the ceiling.
Percy noticed the awkward silence, "Dinner sounds nice."
And so I told her about Gandalf and the three little pigs, how they wanted me to attend their school and about what Chiron told me.
Right behind us.
"You know, the first time I saw actual monsters, I was driving to a camp. This big guy with horns, he was actually there, showed up and flipped my car."
"Who said you would be going to the hearing with my godson! You filthy Death Eater!" He roared.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, butI caught every word, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort, one Severus never possessed. At Camp he couldn't even keep the Apollo cabin quiet for more than ten minutes.
That's when Percy bust into the room, his hair ungroomed and a toothbrush between his teeth. "Hurry up, she scares me."
"They might have done something to him, Hermione."
Once inside the stationwe waited casually beside the barrier between platforms nine andten until the coast was clear, then we each leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto platform nine and three quarters,where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families. I inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . I was really going back. . . .
The next page was all about the first date. Another page had little 'open when' cards on it. I didn't look inside because I though that would be invading private property. There was a lot of sappy stories that I didn't care to look twice at.
"Well," I clasped my hand, "Should we go find a compartment?" People were starting to give us weird looks. After all, we were just standing in front of the door talking about trains.
Gandalf's face immediately light up with happiness. "Perseus Jackson, you really are a wonderful person. Your camp director told me a lot of wonderful things about you."
"So... is it like a black market? Can I buy a magical liver that could even withstand my ex-stepfathers drinking?"
"Not that, how did you make that box move."
Laughter erupted from everyone who heard him and Percy seemed more confused than when he found out he was a wizard.
There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard me talk about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died. For good reason too, it wasn't my fondest memory.
Truth be told, I didn't.
"Tonks!" cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to look behind her.
"Bye." I said sadly as I looked down at the gift wrapped in blue packaging. It even had a bow at the top.
"No, no, we're not allowed. Just the defendant and their lawyer. Good luck!"
I brought my knees up to my chest and put my head down. After a while I popped back up. "It doesn't matter now. We can't miss the train again."
We heard a deep breath, a lot of crying and finally the door closed. I could hear mumbling on the other side but I was puzzled.
"What did you do?"
"Jackson!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if i added a mixture of rhododendron, tansy, and crab blossom to an infusion of begonia?"
I looked at my mother and she gave me the you-do-what's-best-for-you mixed with the your-fault-kid look. Deep down I knew that I was loved but sometimes her facial expressions made me doubt it.
"What are you doing with these
He tried to get up but there was no point, the evil was already upon him.
"No this is Perry Johnson."
I was walking down a long winding corridor that seemed to never end. The walls were so close that I had to walk sideways.
He pushed himself, his calves burning. He could rest later, now there was no time.
"What about Jim?" Asked Sally, confused.
Said Dumbledore . "It's like teleportation."
"Detention, Mr. Potter!" said Professor Umbridge triumphantly. "Tomorrow evening. Five o'clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Pagefive, 'Basics for Beginners.' "
"Oh Iris goddess of rainbows, accept my offering." I said throwing the drachma at the wonderland of skittles, after a moment I said, "Chiron Camp-Half Blood."
"So he went to Ilvermorny?" He passed me another wand.
"Eh em." Someone cleared their throat behind me.
"Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?"asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.
"FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS!"
"Harry, you don't even know him. He might be the nicest person you've ever met." Said Lupin. "When you first met your own godfather you thought he was a killer. Why don't you give him the benefit of the doubt, it's what anyone deserves."
"How's Medusa doing? Did she come back from Tartarus?" I asked, the wizards were still not moving, my mother was trying to push the three musketeers into my room where Blackjack was waiting on the fire escape with Guido and Porkpie. Then when my mom whispered something to Dumbledore he made Ron, Harry and Hermione leave with my mother. He waited and watched.
"You're taking it surprisingly well." Said Ron.
I looked at him with big eyes until he noticed he said something wrong. "Wait, you didn't mean my fathers side did you?" Dumbledore shook his head.
"Yes, but — "
"My behavior, I shouldn't have left like that. It's bad manners after all." They didn't know I caused the little 'event.' That made things a lot simpler although I was pretty sure they suspected me.
I threw in another coin, "Oh Fleecy show me a solid. Annabeth Chase."
Immediately my heart stopped. Was something wrong? Annabeth looked sad? Should I tell Dumbledore I'm not going and check on Annabeth instead?
"No Molly!" Yelled Sirius, "Dumbledore is the ridiculous one! I will not let that evil child get near my godson!"
Percy, Fred and George were talking in hushed tones, smirking every now and then. Probably planning on pranking someone. I didn't know how the twins trusted Percy so much, they didn't see he was a Death Eater.
"Thalia!" Percy yelled. "Nice to see you, the gods really are in my favor!"
"PERCY!"
He buried his face in my shoulder. I saw Piper watching from the doorway with a sad smile.
"Oh, no." Said Bill, horrified.
"Yeah.... that's my other grandpa. He was a crazy drunk." Percy started fidgeting with the collar of his robe.
"How many times?" Asked Nico waving at Vernon groaning.
"Well, good afternoon!" she said when finally the whole class had sat down. A few people mumbled "Good afternoon," in reply. The standard.
"Parvati Patil, and isn't there a practical bit in our Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren't we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and things?"
We followed behind him, but well out of sight. He ran up the stairs so quickly we had to stop once to catch our breath.
She took a breath, "So, my uncle from my dads family just called. I hate him so much. He comes telling my dad that my aunt died two years ago and my cousin Magnus has been living on the streets ever since." She clutched her fists, I could see anger in her eyes. "I'm going to Boston to find him. I just can't believe he didn't tell anyone for two years! And Magnus has been living on the streets! How could he not tell us!"
Don't let them eat,
"Harry, you're going to need to tell me about that dementor attack."
"How do you remember stuff like that?" asked Ron, looking at herin admiration.
I choked on my cookie. Not a good way to die considering what I've been through.  "What do you mean?" I asked warily. "It's been two years since he's finally been killed."
Finally I let her go and walked away. I was halfway between my apartment and the Delphi Food Truck when I realized I was forgetting something. I stuck my hand into my bag and rummaged around for the bracelet I bought Annabeth.
I glared at him, not believing a single word.
"Let's try again. Jackson, where would you look if I told you to find me an opah fish?"
I saw it. A door. I tried to open it but it wouldn't budge no matter how hard I pulled.
"What do you think?"
"Miss Metal Detector and Fai went back to help Reyna. Koala Man has a lot of
"Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?"
"Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?" she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.
"Dementors?" Said the witch in surprise. "What do you mean, boy?"
"Hell Hermione! Now is not the time!" Yelled Harry, whipping out his wand.
We went up the long, spiraling staircase. The gray, old wood creaking beneath our feet. A smell of death in the air as we passed the severed fairy heads, they were beautiful. So gorgeous, I just love Death. Actually, Thanatos isn't that bad looking.
An awkward silence followed as Dean grappled with words to describe just how Seamus was.
I put my hand on his shoulder in a very paternal fashion. "Don't worry about me Harry, I've known Severus for some time and he wouldn't hurt me."
"How did you know?"
The funnest part about school was always picking out your supplies, and since I got expelled a lot I had lots of chances to pick out new notebooks from Walmart.
"Oh trust me," I said crushing up snake fangs like some serial killer, "I know."
"Ah, I knew you'd have some questions."
"What do you think about them? Do you think they could be death eaters?" I asked.
"Bloody hell." Muttered Ron after I finished.
"Aren't — aren't you guys coming with — ?"
Dumbledore cleared his throat, interrupting Fudge mid sentence which he did not appreciate. "Actually there was a witness, other than Dudley Dursley of course."
"Are you sure? I can always get you some more chocolate frogs if that's what you want."
"You know... after everything that happened yesterday?"
I woke up shaking. I didn't know if what he saw was real, but I gained some trust towards the grandson of Voldemort.
"She can be very convincing." I laughed, an image of Piper charm speaking Sirius into doing stupid things in my mind.
The voice softened. "Of course, of course. No need to apologize. Please, take your seats."
"I must have missed it," said Dumbledore cheerfully. "However,due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done."
"What?"
"Miss Metal Detector and Fai went back to help Reyna. Fai has a lot of
"Thanks. Come on Piper."
"What did you say your name was boy?" He asked me, handing me another, lighter stick. This one caused an explosion of lightning that seemed very dangerous.
"Yeah fine fine, now go back." I was starting to get worried, some Slytherins were starting to get up.
"That genocidal maniac is your blood! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree!"
"Percy, you're not supposed to be here." I whispered.
"Do you think I'll make it to Elysium? Like, I'm a son of Poseidon, I'm going to be judged in front of sons of Zeus. We may be related but there's some chemistry."
"Ah Percy, already calling after an hour."
"I'm going somewhere with Piper and Percy and I was wondering if you could come with me."
Suddenly Percy froze and looked at his mother in horror, "Gorgons!"
I noticed pain and fright in Mrs. Weasley's eyes. Percy must have caught it too. I'm guessing he knows about Percy Weasley because he quickly said, "Call me Perseus."
The first page had one name written on it.
"Hm... maybe I got the measurements wrong?" Said Ollivander, more to himself than to me.
The witch covered in shadows next to Fudge cut across him in a booming voice."You produced a fully fledged Patronus?"
I brushed her blonde curly hair out of her face with my hand, pretending we were in a top tier Hollywood romance movie. Like LaLaLand or something. I'll admit, I've watched it about five times with Piper and cried the first four. I'm secure enough in my own masculinity to admit that! Anyway, I pulled her in for a hug. "I'll miss you too my Wise Girl," I whispered, burying my face in the curve of her neck. Her hair smelled faintly of cinnamon apple shampoo and dusty books.
Severus muttered something under his breath and waved a stick, which I guessed to be a wand. A puff of smoke circled around us. I felt like Houdini.
"Perseus Jackson." Grimaced Dumbledore and we continued our trek up to the top of the stairs. Before we even got to our destination, we heard a lady's voice.
"About 32 times," Will answered Nico's question, walking over to us with a limping Harry.
-"Fred."
"Perseus Jackson, let us in filthy half-blood. We'll kill you sooner or later, you should know that."
He sighed and put the book down. With a flick of his wand the stone door to the potions room slammed shut and he plopped down on the desk right next to me. "No one except for the Order and Potter know why you're really here. Do you really want
"Camp Half-Blood does not count."
She carefully positioned herself along side everyone else, raised her bottle. "Squirt!"
Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever.
"Give it a little spin." He said, handing the stick to me.
Thalia stared us down "Take. One. Or. Else" She growled.
"Come in."
"Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying, you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day..."
"What language is that?" I asked pointing at the word.
They stared avidly from me to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at me without a trace of a fake smile on her face.
I was furious.
"Hmmm, do it again."
"Thalia!" I yelled. "Nice to see you, the gods really are in my favor!"
"Hey Beauty Queen." Percy said. He noticed she was crying. "What's the matter?"
Percy jumped off BlackJack with a huge lopsided smile, Piper was rolling in her seat, Hermione snorted and Ron was green.
"Grandpa's a douche, isn't he. Imagine attacking a man while he's taking a piss. Not even Kronos..."
"Go!" I yelled. "They're here for me! I'll handle this and get back to you."
"Don't you Amelia?" Fudge laughed. I wanted nothing more than to punch him in the face. "The boy is obviously lying and thought that dementors would be the perfect cover story seeing as how Muggles can't see them. Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it's just your word and no witnesses. . . ."
"That's funny coming from you! Wasn't your family working with Voldemort?" The sink exploded.
After much trouble, we finally got our luggage in and settled down. The strange girl was still staring at me.
Half the class exchanged gloomy looks and some even groaned, the order "wands away" had never been followed by an interesting lesson. Quite the opposite, frankly.
Excellent," said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out his wand, and causing his chair to vanish. "Well, I must be getting along. Good day to you all."
Then Percy emerged from the stairs, he took out his pen, the same pen he killed the gorgon things with.
was blocking out my memories."
Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that I could not see what she was writing.
"Love you too, OwlHead!" He yelled back.
"Oh lighten up," said Ron, "he hasn't seen daylight for months,poor bloke."
"It's too dangerous for you to leave and you know that. Harry will get all the support he needs from Mr. Weasley who will accompany him to the court room. Sirius, Harry needs you alive more than he needs you at a basic hearing." Percy had yet to hear Dumbledore raise his voice. Even in tough times, he was the rock that held everyone together.
I said.
"You're being ridiculous!" Shrieked Mrs. Weasley, "The poor kid might not even know he's a wizard!"
There were about fifty of them, some looking down at me with disapproving glares, others with frank curiosity. They wore plum colored robes with a silver W on the side of their chests.
"Now you won't be needing a pen here. We write with quills in the Wizarding world."
"Good," said Professor Umbridge. "I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, 'Basics for Beginners.' There will be no need to talk." Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher's desk, observing us all with those toad's eyes.
It hit Guido in the face.
Cue the gasp from Hermione.
I nodded in agreement with Ron.
"Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter."
It was much colder there than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jar sall around the walls. Why were wizards so weird? Yeah Uncle Hades might have the souls of the damned woven into his underwear but at least he didn't have a mutilated row of frogs hanging from the ceiling like some Christmas decorations.
The next page had a map of what I assumed to be New York. There was a pin stuck in the middle with a heart and words,
After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that I could not open it.
"Thank you so much sir, it's hard to find parking for Pegasi around the mortal world."
"I..."
Actually I didn't know exactly, I just guessed from the concentration on her face. Finally I broke the tension, "What was that about?"
"We're actually supposed to go to the prefect carriage... up front..." Hermione was looking at everything except me as she said it.
The guy started heading towards the building, suddenly he turns around holding two blue cookies and a huge grin on his face.
The large dungeon we had entered seemed familiar. It was the one I had seen in Dumbledore's memories, during Sirius's trial. The stone walls were dark and dimly lit by torches. In the shadows I could see the shapes of wizards and witches although I couldn't see any of their faces. The courthouse looked like a poorly built Minecraft throne room. Yes, I know what Minecraft is. I might have lived under the stairs but I'm not
"Wotcher, Harry," she said, winking. "Better hurry up, hadn't we,Molly?" she added, checking her watch.
So we ran, Mr. Weasley leading the charge. We ducked into a hallway, ran down another hallway until we got to a dead end. Only it wasn't a dead end, it was an elevator.
"He's actually a pureblood, as pure as they get. He was just raised as a Muggle because his mom was a squib."
"Sketchy, weird, mysterious, dark, evil and definitely Death Eaters." Replied Ron.
But here right now, I finally realized, this is a 15 year old kid. Yes he himself was only 17, but he had been the hero of two wars. He's seen more death than most people would in three lifetimes.
He ran to the back of the shop and reemerged with a box identical to the rest. He opened it and there lay a cool piece of wood. That's the only way I could describe it, wood.
"If you think about it, we have many friends from other houses."
Outside stood the weirdest people I've ever met, and that's saying something! A bushy man resembling Gandalf stood in the doorway. Maybe they were twins? Behind him stood three kids. One had red hair and freckles littering his face, the other, a girl, had big bushy brown hair and wide brown eyes that seemed to be observing my every move. The third, well all I can say is he looked like a mix between me and Nico, except with glasses. Mini Pernico. I think I saw a tag like that on Tumblr but I never ventured further.
"I get it, my dad wasn't there for me growing up but, he had his reasons. It sucked, I won't lie, but his absence made me the person I am today. I can't image what I'd be like if he had been there. All that's important now is that you're there for Harry in the long run, even if it means sitting out sometimes."
"Please do," Piper smirked, walking up with popcorn.
"I don't think we'll have to stay there all journey," said Hermione quickly. "Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time."
I wasn't being sarcastic when I called the upcoming day an adventure.
Next to me, Ron was absentmindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the page. Thank Merlin I wasn't the only one.
"Let us move on to the charges." said Fudge shuffling his notes, he had not been counting on Dumbledore appearing. "The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards' Statute of Secrecy."
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom."You're late."
When I ran downstairs however, there was no meeting going on. Most of the Order was sitting around a table and just, laughing. It seemed out of place almost. With the threat of Voldemort looming high, there hadn't been much time for joy. Percy was in a deep conversation with Sirius which I hadn't expected from them, but when he saw me he got up.
"Thought so." And with that he walked away, up the stairs. The trembling of the ground getting fading away until it was gone.
I looked back to see a smile tugging on Harry's lips. Score!
━━━━━━━☆☆━━━━━━━
"When I say the word, start spraying immediately," she said. "They'll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. When they're immobilized, just throw them in this bucket."
War was a scary thing, especially for someone who's never seen it before.
I didn't understand a single bit of it. When Piper and Percy went on a run, me, Ron, Hermione and Ginny went up to the girls room to talk.
Harry got quiet all of a sudden.
Defense Against the Dark Arts A Return to Basic Principles.
He stopped for a second. "You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?" Fudge said, glaring at me over the top of his parchment.
"Percy, I'm sure Dumbledore will explain more throughly but your mission is to protect Harry. I know that you just got from war but this is a piece of cake compared to Gaea and Kronos. I want you to watch over Harry. But remember, the most important thing is that you let Harry fight the final battle. He's destined to die in the end for Voldemort to vanish. There's a twist though, and you'll have to find out about that yourself." You shoulda said spoiler alert or something.
entered the room; Professor Umbridge was an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be. (Oh were we in for a surprise.)
"Have you seen that man, he's got blubber for dayssss! The walrus' called, they don't want their child back."
"Who?" I turned towards Percy. He was being weird again.
Hermione was in a calm position, her voice betraying no fear. Except once you looked into her eyes, you could see something wild, born out of fear of the unknown.
Could I say that I was very happy. This would prove my point! I knew he couldn't be trusted, he probably wanted some secret weapon or something. "What is it?" Dumbledore asked.
"You can stop pretending now." I pushed some scrolls off his desk and plopped down on top of it. He didn't even glance up.
A second later, Mr. Weasley appeared with Ron and Hermione.
She took it and shook it violently. When she let go she studied him a little longer. "You're a halfblood."
"Good evening Sally, my name is Albus Dumbledore and these are my students, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Harry Potter. The Harry kid looked at me as if I should know him but when I didn't show any recognition, he looked relieved. Maybe he was a serial killer?
"Oh Kelp Head," she sobbed, "Repair Boy's returned! We've got a message. He came back with Calypso and Festus!"
With all honesty I couldn't wait to go to Diagonal Alleyway. Then again I also love exploring Target.
Percy was there with me so it was a little weird for him to be asking. Then again, this was Percy. "Well, we flew to Privet Drive..."
"It was murder," I said. I could feel myself shaking and starting to panic for no reason. I had hardly talked to anyone about that night, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates.
Of everyday.
"And Slytherin all have broomsticks up their arses." Countered Ron.
"Ah," said Fudge, who looked about as red as a tomato. "Dumbledore. Yes. You — er — got our — er — message that the time and —er — place of the hearing had been changed, then?"
That awoke me completely.
Professor Umbridge looked up. "This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world," she said softly.  What in the dizzly fuck does that mean?
"That's a very lame joke." She pointed out, "But, you just need to gain their trust."
We entered the house and shocker again! It looked just as bad on the inside if not worse. Mold was peeling off the walls. The curtains were alive and looked as if they were trying to murder me.
It's not as if I was afraid of the gorgons too much, the worst was the fact that I had mortal guests right now.
"Now now, why can't we all just be friends?" Said Percy getting up.
━━━━━━━☆☆━━━━━━━
I heard knocking and then the unmistakable voice of Euryale.
"Not true!"
"You do the same for me."
"Gods as in multiple gods?" Asked Hermione behind us, staring at me and Piper.
"Harry you okay?" I questioned. I was actually concerned. "How about you come with me."
My mom finally came into the living room. For a moment I had thought she took the fire escape and left me to fend for myself. She wiped the floor off her hands on her apron before reaching her hand out to Gandalf, "Good evening, I'm Sally Blofis. And you are?"
"Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully," said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.
As he stepped into the shop, which read Ollivanders, a tinkling bell rang through the little building.
When me and Ron came into our room, Percy was sitting on his bed.
What everyone says.
I could see from the teachers table as Snape stared Percy down. And I could swear he facepalmed.
"You learned this at school?"
Fudge laughed, obviously not in a very believing mood. "Let's put this to a vote now shall we? All voting not guilty stand up."
More silence followed this little speech. You could see a few first years exchanged glances. The Ravenclaw, Morgan, was already on the edge of her seat, ready to prove herself.
"All I know is that I'm supposed to protect Harry from the V-dawg. And that's what I'm going to do. Why would I want to work with someone who kills for
"Fine," Cornelius Fudge laughed, he had turned around to face me. "We have one. I'm sorry to disappoint you young boy but it seems you expulsion from Hogwarts is im—"
"I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin!"
Harry was about to object when Blackjack, Guido and Porkpie scooped up the trio and flew up into the air, but for some reason they wouldn't leave, they just flew in circles above us like hungry vultures.
They looked at me strangely but then Gandalf continued, "In our world, just like in your world, there are good and bad wizards. Your father Sally, was a dark wizard. His name was Voldemort. (I laughed at this, receiving a glare from my mom) He killed lots of people until Harry here stopped him 14 years ago. He met up with another witch," he said pointing at my mother, "That was before he turned evil. Your grandmother escaped to America, where she married Jim Jackson and your mother was born as a squib, a child born to a wizarding family with no magical capabilities. Then you were born and we've seen extreme potential in you."
━━━━━━━☆Percy☆━━━━━━━
"Oh yeah?" I said. My temper, which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point. Not even Snape would act like this. I should get him a gift, maybe a bottle of shampoo with a note reading
"There were also the monkeys that stole our stuff." Said Piper
"You're gonna have it easy, Jason's a son of Zeus."
Percy spoke up, "You're both wrong, I'm actually a 3/4 blood!"
"Well, my grandfather was a pureblood so not really." That's the one thing I remembered about Voldemort other than the fact that he had no nose. He was a pureblood trying to exterminate muggles and muggle-borns.
He did something unexpected. He smiled, "That, my lady, was the perfect answer." Hermione looked at him wide eyed. "Come on in, take a seat."
How do you live with them?"
It might have been my imagination but he seemed to turn a little red.
If you noticed I tried to use code words. Home means Camp Jupiter, Dirt face means Gaea, Frank working with Reyna means Franks praetor. Repair Boy down means, Leo's dead... Piper and Jason are still looking after Nico said there was something different about it, but I lost hope.
"We really have to take you up to Madam Pomfrey."
It was funny how still, no one knew I was a demigod. They had seen so much in a span of a few days and still didn't understand.
"Down in old — but they told me — Merlin's beard —"Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his chair."Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!"
"How-how did you know it was there?" Asked Hermione.
"D'you realize how much homework we've got already?" said Ron as we climbed down the ladder from the divination classroom. After a full day of Magical History, Potions, and whatever the hell Trelawney taught us, I was ready to go back to the common room and sleep until May.
Lupin finally noticed what he did wrong and Mr and Mrs. Weasley looked at Percy gratefully.
"But that means I'll be with a bunch of first graders!"
Professor Umbridge's face was quite blank.
"Uh-um, just wondering." Said Ron, trying to act smooth.
When I looked to my right, I saw something so surprising that I almost fainted. Well maybe that was a little dramatic but you get my point, Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air.
"All our friends are Gryffindors, I doubt your inter-House unity is a good plan Hermione." Said Ron.
"They do it all the time as a safety method."
"Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than vapor or smoke?"
After several more minutes had passed, however, I was not the only one watching Hermione. The chapter we had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione's mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge's eye than to struggle on with "Basics for Beginners." It was sort of entertaining. Someone, probably a muggleborn,  started humming the Jaws theme. Uh oh.
Serious didn't laugh. His name really did fit him.
We watched the dishes in silence for another forty minutes when...
When Percy started unpacking, me and Ron backed out of the door and ran to Ginny's room.
I learned that from Leo. Just saying.
"So what you're trying to tell me is that I'm a wizard." I said and Gandalf nodded. I just sighed and turned to my mother, "Just when I thought my life was already too messed up." She laughed and the Harry kid glared at me, what was his problem? He must be going through it. I could sympathize with that. Truly. I gave the bitchest stares when I was going through a rough time too, just ask my boy Jason.
Oops. Tough luck.
"Ah, never doubt McLean, it will end with your death."
"Oh really?" He mocked. "How is being
The walk to the Platform was uneventful. Sirius chased a few cats here and there and almost got ran over, but other than that, the next twenty minutes were silent.
We went behind the house, you could hear Vernon's moaning and Petunias crying.
filling in as him. I know I'm nothing like Leo but I've tried.
A dull murmur echoed throughout the class. I was starting to wish for an extra lesson of potions and that never happened.
"It looks," I tried to find the right word but gave up and just said, "Like the room of a thousand year old vampire princess. She lived with her zombie friends, and some ghosts. Maybe we could throw in some other creature, like a dead cat."
"It's... okay..."
Like magic, one by one, the witches and wizards all around started standing up. The only one left sitting had been the Fudge.
"Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers —"
"Dumbledore told me." He explained after seeing Sirius' accusing glare.
Once again, my suspicions faded a little, he really seemed to be telling the truth. Unless he was a really good actor.
Silence fell as me and Piper heard something on the other side of the door. A thump, a shriek and a knock.
"Exactly." Hermione was more than happy to give me the whole history of Digital Alley when I asked. The way she went off topic and started explaining random things to me reminded me of Annabeth. Except instead of architecture Hermione was a fan of history.
"Thanks mom, I don't know how I could have gotten out of that without you."
"No."
Blue cookies!
I looked at him strangely but then Dumbledore continued, "In our world, just like in your world, there are good and bad wizards." Dumbledore started explaining wizards to Percy I started looking around. It seemed like a normal apartment. Nice and cozy. But I knew they had to be hiding something. Maybe I did think they were innocent but I couldn't shake that feeling that they were hiding something. And then how could I not hate him if his grandfather killed my parents. Then again it wasn't his fault but still.
Draco woke up, safe in his bed.
I don't know why, but this simple statement really seemed to annoy me. The faucet started to leak.
The next morning, Piper was coming over and we'd be talking to Harry about the hearing. But there was one problem, nobody but me and Dumbledore knew about Pipers visit. I didn't think Sirius would be too happy.
After a good nights sleep everything becomes clearer. This was especially true for the three little dumplings.
"We're here to talk about Percy's grandfather." He continued.
"That would be creep no? Imagine you're just thinking about what you're gonna eat. And suddenly, someone knows what you're gonna eat!"
We stopped in front of an old, abandoned building, the floors creaked as we walked inside. There was a couch and some chairs. A cabinet and some other things. What caught Harry's eye was the giant, decapitated head that hung from the wall. "This is our hideout." Said Thalia. She took something from a nearby cabinet. "Twizzler?" She asked, offering them to me and Ron.
Dumbledore was gliding along the floor in his long midnight blue robe. His expression was calm as usual. He never seemed to show any negative emotions.
"Don't tell me what to do
"He stumbled out of nowhere, making a big show of grabbing his throat. "Oh, no," he said, like he was reading from a teleprompter. "I am turning into a crazy dolphin.
"Coming." I mumbled through a mouthful of food.
7 tablespoons of beautiful flour, Demeter's specialty.
I followed Ron and Harry past long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which I supposed there must be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll's leg, we started up the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A closer look showed me that the heads be longed to elf-like creatures. All of them had the same rather snout like nose.
"My friend, Piper's coming. She's going to help with the hearing. She should be here any minute now." I said casually while eating my pancakes.
The hug, honestly, felt nice even though I hated to admit it. I was wrong about Percy, ya he's really weird, but not evil genius imma kill your family weird.
"Harry, Ron. Perseus will be sleeping in your room. Could you please show him the way." Said Molly, but it sounded like more of a command.
"I'm just trying to figure out if you're really okay, after yesterdays trauma and all." Something was going on but I was too out of it to place my finger on it.
"No, you're Fred." I said pointing to the one who introduced himself as George. "And you're George." I pointed at the one who introduced himself as Fred.
"Ya we're coming." Replied Piper grabbing my wrist and pulling me down the stairs of doom.
I kicked my chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher's desk. I could feel the rest of the class holding their breath. I felt so angry that I could hardly have cared what happened next. Expel me if you want, I'll live under a bridge with some trolls.
We had just taken the first batch out of the oven (lemme tell you, that smelled so good) when someone knocked on the door. Of course I couldn't even enjoy a single meal without interruptions. I didn't even want to think who it could have been, if the gods were playing another prank on me... My mom started to get up but I put up my hand. I should answer it, just in case it really was the gods playing tricks on me and sending some Gorgon's or other creepy monsters. Gorgon's would have been preferred to what I got.
"Because," Piper took a deep breath and the pink aura surrounding her intensified. No, what was I thinking. There was no aura. "I
"So, how are we going to get to this PigFarts?" I asked, casually.
"There's not much that happened. Seamus reckoned that I was lying about You-Know-Who, we got into an argument, and then I went to sleep." Why were they making such a big deal. Sure I was pissed but no one died.
"Enough, enough!" said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his face. "I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story —"
BUT FOR WIZARDS!
"That's great!" Percy said. "How did you manage to find the time to come though?"
I distinctly remember flying on something big and hairy but that was impossible. "On brooms obviously. Ron threw up off the side."
"I guess it's just me and you buddy!" He smiled a wicked smile. "Let's go find that compartment you were talking about and feast on these weird frog things!"
to die.
Harry didn't move. I continued.
"Oh, hey SeaweedBrain. I was about to call, I need to tell you something."
"Alright alright, if colors are so important to you guys I'll leave. Can't mix the red and green m&m's now can we?" He threw his arm around Blaise's shoulder and yelled, "Onward!"
was something in another language.
A slam of a door, Lupins yell, and Remus came into the kitchen followed closely by Piper.
I sat down by Harry, this was going to be awkward but no one knew fear better than me, except maybe Kronos when Luke killed him! Ruining the moment? Sorry.
"That's not what I meant..." But I was already down the stairs and leaving out the door. It was nice of Harry to try and warn me but I've known Severus since I first got to camp. He was an ass but that was about as far as it went.
The three kids immediately whipped out sticks (wow, I'm so scared!) but Gandalf's look alike waved them away.
Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry's bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape's, shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and Ginny started requesting their favorite noses.
"So what you're trying to tell me is that I'm a wizard." Asked Percy. When Dumbledore nodded he just sighed and turned to his mother, "Just when I thought my life was already too messed up." She laughed and I glared at him. My suspicion raising again.
"Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their teeth are poisonous. I've got a bottle of antidote here, but I'd rather nobody needed it."
"Be careful of him, my mom says he can be real nasty. She went to school with him so she knows."
That's when it hit me like a semi, the reason the hearing had been changed was to make sure Dumbledore didn't show up. It was rigged against me from the start. The Ministry was doing everything in its legal power to keep me out of Hogwarts. That feeling of belonging that had begun to grow in my chest disappeared without a trace. No one wanted me.
I locked my door, took out a drachma and formed a rainbow. Well I didn't literally form the rainbow, more like made the water form the rainbow but that's beyond the point.
Phones were secure. Rainbows weren't. Who's to say that Iris hasn't been spying in on every one of our conversations. I'd much rather have the FBI hear me confess my love to my Wise Girl than a hippie goddess.
“I said all right,” she hissed with narrowed eyes.
"I'll levitate you out. Once you've reached the ground, I'll follow you. We'll get you out of here safely. I promise."
He wanted to think that he was better – that he was a good person. No matter how often Harry had told him otherwise, he knew that good people didn’t do what he had done.
been an amazing night!
The door swung open silently, revealing a posh room, decorated in materials that he had never even seen before. The walls were on a dark grey colour, similar to the tone the long carpet in the hallway had. Heavy curtains covered most of the ceiling-high windows, dunking the room into an even darker light. A group of plush couches and chairs in light blue stood in one corner, the fireplace next to them was cold.
(word) tickled, (word) onwards
Draco cursed, grabbed the blanket tighter and made to run out of the room and after the dark-haired man that was rushing out of the house at this very moment and maybe even out of his life if
"Indeed, I do." He cleared his throat nervously and hesitantly sat down next to his object of desire that looked a little bit afraid as if he didn't know what to expect. If Draco was honest with himself, he didn't know that either. He hadn't even known he fancied
"You will do as I say, Draco. This betrothal got arranged before you were even born. You will be obedient and marry Astoria Greengrass. And no complaint!"
"I see," he said quietly before nodding slowly and turning around without another word. Harry heard him walk down the hallway and out of the apartment, closing the door softly behind him.
“Didn’t work about that will, did it?” Harry’s glare caused Daphne to flinch away from him.
Harry Potter had been his official enemy from that point onward, someone far more important than just a little school rivalry that centered around who caught the Snitch faster. Harry Potter had jumped up and straight into the bull’s eye, being turned into a target for thousands of
*~*HP*~*
He sniffed, pushed himself away from the wall and stood straight. He needed to keep a clear head to find out what all of this letter nonsense was about, so with this thought it was that the blond wizard walked around a corner and saw one particular Gryffindor wander through the corridor, his back turned towards him, mumbling softly but quickly to himself and Draco’s heart stopped.
"They will know. You know they will, and they will not stop until they find me. I can't make you go through that. I can't be the reason that destroys your life. I won't be."
, his inner nasty voice replied. He scowled. He couldn't control with whom he'd fall in love, now could he? His parents had organised a betrothal between himself and some other rich pureblood he had yet to meet. He didn't want to meet that person. He didn't want to marry someone he didn't love, hell, didn't even know!
"You promised to keep it safe," he said as he fought back tears. He didn't know whether they were tears of anger or sorrow, but they might have very well been both. "You know how much that watch meant to me, and you promised to keep it safe!"
“Let them.”
Enjoy reading!
Until next time - see ya :D
“No, not that I know of,” Harry snickered as he watched the furious witch march away. “Oh, no.”
“Using… What are you talking about, Weasley?”
The older Greengrass sister turned the handle slowly, desperately hoping that the door wouldn't creek. It didn't.
"It really does."
that she would someday like me. A man can have hopes.
I hope you liked it :D
“Let us go into the parlour and have some tea,” his mother said with a look towards him that clearly spoke of the tension that he felt slowly building around them. “Limpy?”
Harry had gone pale, his eyes blinking rapidly as if he was fighting away tears. “N-No, he… he wouldn’t… a-are you sure that’s what he said?” He sounded so vulnerable and hurt at that moment that Ginny cursed herself for her rash acting. She should have waited for a calm moment and not throw it at him in the middle of a random corridor.
The next bed belonged to their sought out person. Daphne put her bag she had slung over one shoulder down to the ground and started pulling things out of it, delicately placing them on Draco's nightstand.
, his inner nasty voice purred in his ear,
“Potter?”
Ron’s teeth chattered as they sat huddled behind a big tree, peeking around its trunk. Brown eyes searched the grounds, blue eyes frowned at the muddy puddle they were crouching in and green eyes were fixed on one set one dark windows. Draco’s chambers.
(See the end of the chapter for
I had to write about Draco Malfoy (a bad canon character) and the virtue of forgiveness as a Chaser 3 of Puddlemere United. This is once again for the Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition (I'm getting tired of writing the full and overly long name... from now on it's called QLFC) on FFN.
Even after all this time Harry still found old wounds that needed to be healed and as if it wasn’t anything special or anything to be thankful for, he just reached out and made sure Draco was alright.
Ginny was pretty sure her face was bright red by the time she had reached the library, but she couldn’t care less. Her jaw was hurting from her teeth grinding, her palms were sweaty in her balled fists. She was set to fight someone, preferably Malfoy, but she wouldn’t say no to Nott either. He hadn’t seemed to know that Malfoy was messing with Harry, but he didn’t really seem to care that he did either, so he was more than worthy for a few hexes.
catch up between old friends.
He watched him with a sad, emerald gaze, already knowing what would come.
She had a bone to pick with him.
Why, you ask? Well, what else could he have done, really? His whole family had the reputation of being dark, and he had been pegged as a future Death Eater from the day he was born. His parents, although not totally convinced of and passionate about the Dark Lord, had followed him and had thus taken his chance of a normal life. He had been put together with other Death Eater’s children to play, he had sat through so many parties and afternoon tea meetings with distant relatives, all bearing the Dark Mark.
An amused chuckle greeted him as the man raised his hand and pushed his hood out of his face. His greying hair was slightly rumpled, but his smile was warm, if a bit tense.
It was the night that he had always feared, the night that he had done his best to prevent, but no matter how hard he had tried, he had failed each time.
right before my very eyes and you think that I haven’t done enough for this world?”
"Don't move too much, love. You're injured," the voice said worriedly, as green eyes focused on his ruined left arm.
Draco gulped. He had figured as much since the wound had not healed fully yet, so if he was being honest with himself, he wasn’t that surprised.
“I know, I know! We messed up, okay? We’ll fix it! I know we will!”
It’s been about half an hour, maybe slightly longer, since Lucius had thrown Draco back into his room, pushing him to the ground. With a last nasty sneer, he had slammed the door shut, sealing it with multiple charms to make sure he would not get out of this posh prison. He didn’t even have his wand on him. He wouldn’t be able to leave even if he tried.
After a while, he reached the top of the stairs. A lone window overlooked the roofs of the castle that stood in stark contrast to the rising sun at the horizon.
Prompts:
He had repeated his father’s mistakes, supported and helped his insane aunt, had been the reason that the leader of the light side had fallen, and had been the cause for so many lives taken and families ripped apart. During all those years filled with nightmares and regrets, he had forced himself to continue until the bitter end.
Her broken form was surrounded by hooded figures, most of whom had their wands drawn and either pointed at the crying girl or loosely at their sides. The sight before him made him want to reach into his cloak, grab his wand, and curse every single witch and wizard in this room because he was sure that the innocent girl lying at the mercy of the Death Eaters was a Muggle.
“Draco?” Worry clouded Harry’s eyes as he started fidgeting. “Why, what’s wrong with him? Did something happen to him?”
her to believe that was the case, but there was still that small voice in the back of her head that kept telling her different. There was still suspicion and uncertainty that she wanted to get to the bottom of. She was worried, but if Hermione said that Malfoy had changed, if
"Of course, I know you’d choose differently. You’re not one of his followers. And I will always be by your side, love. No matter what you say or decide, you won't make me leave you. My life is dangerous as it is, it can't really get any worse."
"Can't do what any longer?" Draco sounded so insecure in that moment that, for a short, insane second, Harry doubted everything. Maybe he could change, after all? Had he given the blond enough time and opportunities to change? Yes. Yes, he had, but still…
Draco winced as he thought what could have happened if she had seen them both together. “Exactly,” Potter nodded as sighed, as he looked down at his hands and thus gave Draco a good opportunity to really look at him.
Hermione turned around quickly and said something to the mob of redheads, who were all glaring daggers his way, before she smiled at him, and motioned for him to lead the way out of the temporary mausoleum.
"Well, I told him I wanted to catch up with him and chat about the good old times over a butterbeer-"
Please leave a comment and tell me what you think!
Draco Malfoy
Quickly, and quietly, she jumped behind it in time for the group of Ravenclaws to move past without seeing her. Cautiously, she peeked around the shoulder of the armour, eyes trained on the pair further down the hallway, the pair that had made her freeze. Not for the first time did she wish she had Harry’s Invisibility Cloak on her...
A high female voice cleared her throat and took a deep breath. “May I welcome the persons of the night; Mr and Mrs Ronald and Hermione Granger, accompanied by non-other than Mr Harry Potter himself!”
“Rise and shine, love,” said the most loving, beautiful and at the moment most annoying and irritating voice I have ever heard in my entire life.
Draco blinked at the blushing wizard and took a deep breath. “I didn’t quite catch that,” he deadpanned and waited for Harry to get his Gryffindor courage back because that he would need if he had dared to get himself hurt and tried to wave it off as something not worth mentioning.
*~*HPDM*~*
Hermione’s gaze travelled over the surface of the Black Lake as she tried to think of an explanation for the pureblood’s weird behaviour. And however she tried to turn the events, she came to the same conclusion every time.
Harry jumped into action. Not thinking twice, he waved his wand and silently charmed his boyfriend into the air. He threw his invisibility cloak over his body and pushed him out of the ruined window. Fists banged against the door, the light of curses shining through the slid between its wood and the floor.
He had wanted to respect Draco’s wish to not come after him as he needed to do what his family asked of him. He had not been happy about it – quite the contrary in fact – but he had respected that wish. He would have wanted Draco away from the bull’s eye as well if he had had the opportunity to tell him to stay far away from the Ministry of Magic and their Department of Mysteries or whatever places where he had fought for his life. He wouldn’t want his other half in danger, and he knew that Draco found comfort in the knowledge that Harry was far away. Or so he thought....
The dungeon room was as cold as the other rooms the Slytherins called their home. The fireplace near the other end of the dormitory was cold, the flames long extinguished. A total of six beds filled the quarters, three on each side of the square room.
” It sounded more like a forced, somewhat painful question than something that’s supposed to reassure me. “You’ll see, they’ll just ask a few innocent questions.”
He rubbed his eyes tiredly as he saw a man drag his woman away from him, glancing over his shoulder as if Draco might attack them any second. He sighed and downed the rest of the whiskey in his glass. He rolled his shoulders and looked around. He had to be here
"Don't believe a single word she says, mate," Ron said seriously as he pushed the bowl with the broccoli filling into Harry's hands. "She's getting scary, honestly. Last week, she woke me up in the middle of the night saying she wanted oysters." He blinked, eyes big. "Where the
to do the right thing, so he had
*~*HPDM*~*
"Shh, I'm here," his boyfriend said calmingly and gently brushed the sweaty hair out of his thin face. "I'm gonna get you out of here, Draco. Ron and Hermione are waiting outside. We'll get you out of here."
He was shut up as Harry's lips met his.
I hope you liked it!
"Harry!" Draco gasped and crawled over to where he was lying. "Oh Merlin, are you okay?"
Blood covered most of the front of his dark robes, which made his already bloodless skin look even paler. He looked dead. The only calming thing was the shallow, huffed breaths and the moving chest, as it raised up and down slightly as it painfully took in oxygen.
A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth as he closed his eyes and enjoyed the love he felt radiating from her. "I missed you too, mother."
“The Beast Division?” I frowned.
"I don't care!" His green eyes glistened dangerously as he grabbed his shoulders and made it impossible for him to move away. "You hear me? I don't care! All I care about is you and if you go through with this, it will destroy you and I will not sit by and watch as you die on the inside."
"Yeah, I know, I know, but I need something
of all people. At the moment he still hoped this unexpected turn of…
Malfoy blinked and Harry could see a subtle tint of pink colouring his pale cheeks. "Let's take this somewhere more comfortable, shall we?" Without any further ado, he turned around and hurried through the hallway towards a slightly ajar door, his head held high and his muscles tense. Harry swallowed down the tingling feeling that threatened to wander into regions he honestly didn't want to think about right now – or didn't want to do his thinking for him, as that would be more fitting.
He glared at the girl who had been the only person dear to him who had not once turned her back on him – until now. All of those moments when she had defended him from friends or enemies were nothing against what she was asking of him now.
Harry smiled awkwardly and tried to scoot away from the overenthusiastic blond witch at his side. “Thank you,” he said into the microphone and the next ten minutes were spend with trying to convince the audience that he enjoyed the party just as much as he was supposed to, always in constant danger of getting out of reach of the microphone, as the blonde lady beside him made it a very uncomfortable habit of sticking to his body like a second skin.
Harry sighed and put his hand against his forehead dejectedly. He had just been reprimanded by his own traitorous mind. And no, he hadn’t forgotten that disaster that people, probably the same ones that were currently trying to hunt him down at this very moment, called ‘Second Anniversary of Harry Potter’s Triumph’. That evening had ended with Harry being to tipsy to apparate properly and had ended up with one foot in his toilet rather than with both feet in the entrance hall of his house.
He grinned at me, winked and left me wondering about the unfairness of social relationships.
“Draco?” He cursed himself that he sounded like he was feeling – hurt and weak.
Because some bimbo had sent him a letter he had intended to ignore only to have it ripped out of his hand by none other than Pancy Parkinson herself who immediately started gushing about how cute all of this was and teased him with having a crush with whom he’d write love letters. Pfft, as if a Malfoy would downgrade himself like that. But he had had to agree on meeting said mystery crush in order to shut her up and prove to her that he had indeed no idea who that person might be and to prove that he had no positive thoughts about this matter whatsoever. It was very twisted logic but logic one Pansy Parkinson thought to be accurate and who was he to not do anything in his power to convince her that he did not have a crush that sent him love letters?
*~*Drarry*~*
“I love you too, you git.”
, the plaque said. No names were listed below, not telling the visitor who resided in this dorm. He didn’t need the list the Slytherin plaques depicted, however, to know who was sleeping behind this wooden door – Harry, the only person who had ever trusted him fully, even though he had had more than enough reasons not to.
"Messed up!" The answer burst out of Harry like an explosion. It was as if something had broken inside of him in that moment, as every scenario washed over him again. Every moment that Draco had disappointed him, every moment Harry had relied on him only to be proven wrong, assaulted his already aching mind and heart. He couldn't do this any longer! He just couldn't!
or whatever the hell they were calling him nowadays. They had even tried to drug or hex him in order to get the most honest interview in the history of love life interviews, but thankfully Hermione had been there to keep him from any harm.
“I didn’t do anything! I swear! He just looked at me and –“

felt like Malfoy had changed, then she would find it in herself to open up and maybe even trust him in the future.
Harry turned his head on the invisible stretch to look over to his boyfriend. The blond had his eyes closed and his breaths were too quick and shallow. The improvised satin bandage around his arm was blood red. They needed to hurry.
He had always envied Harry’s, back then
Hermione nodded slowly and Ginny could practically see her brain working at high speed. After a few moments of silence, she took a deep breath. “I think he’s changed. No, I really do,” she added, eyebrows high on her forehead, as she had seen Ginny’s sceptical look. “I know it’s odd, and I know Ron has a problem accepting it, but have you really looked at Harry recently? Have you noticed how happy he is? That’s Malfoy that’s doing that, and if I’m honest, as long as Harry is that happy, I don’t care who is the reason for that.”
Just as he hushed Draco, who again wanted him to get out as quickly as possible and not to worry about him, he heard hurried footsteps outside the room. Voices that he hadn't noticed before quickly came nearer.
"Excuse me?" His delicate blond eyebrows rose higher than ever.
(word) Change, (quote) 'Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.' - Henry David Thoreau, (setting) a restaurant
"You owe me an explanation," Potter said. His green eyes were opened wide and glistened behind these stupidly adorable glasses as he watched Draco open the bottle of light blue wine and pour the exquisite liquid into two delicate looking glasses, offering one to Harry, who took a cautious sip.
He was worried that something had happened to a guy who lied, betrayed, and used him! Malfoy didn’t deserve him!
Someone, he figured it had been Hermione, had taken off his shoes, and had neatly put them next to the bed. Mud had fallen off its sides and had spread on the floor.
But Draco ignored his former best friend as he ran across the parlour into the huge hallway. He was panting. Jerking his head left and right, Harry was nowhere to be found. A bad feeling settled itself into the pit of his stomach. He hadn’t wanted this to happen! Any of it! He hadn’t wanted to ruin what could have been, no, what
“Draco isn’t a Death Eater,” Harry hissed. His eyes narrowed as he watched Hermione move nervously from one foot to the other.
. If she wouldn’t be cautiously supporting this, she’d get sick with how lovestruck they were.
There. It was out. It was said. He inhaled deeply as he forced himself to not look away. His eyes jumped from his father, who wasn’t moving, to his mother, whose face hat lightened up drastically. Her smile gave him strength to continue.
Granger and Harry exchanged one of those looks that contained a whole, complex discussion that for the life of me I couldn’t – and still can’t for that matter – manage to figure out. Granger sniffed, crossed her arms over her chest and leaned forward slightly, so that her eyes would be on the same level as mine, was I to decide to raise my head.
He'd put everything into this relationship, had given Draco everything that he'd had, and now he felt as if he didn't have anything left to give. He felt empty, helpless, desperate. He felt
Draco shook his head slowly as the antics of the man who people saw as a war hero, who was currently grinning cheekily at him.
There in the middle of his bedroom stood no other than Draco Malfoy himself, wearing what looked like a button-down shirt, inside out, a pair of chinos and no shoes or socks. His hair was dishevelled and his cheeks were slightly pink. He looked nervous as his eyes travelled over Harry’s naked chest, down over the towel around his waist, to his bare feet. Harry blushed almost immediately; his heart started beating twice its normal speed. His hand jerked towards the towel, securing it in place.
sceptically. Hadn't Malfoy said they'd go to a pub to catch up? He hadn't told him anything about going to a restaurant like a… A blush threatened to creep up his neck.
"In the bedroom," he called, not bothering to make his voice sound anything less than hurt. He didn't care that it caused the other to worry. He should have thought about that before he broke his father's watch.
“No, of course not,” I looked at him with a deep frown on my otherwise flawless and angle-like alabaster skin. “I would have told you if I did.”
He squeezed his eyes shut shortly before ruffling his hair and marching to the last door on his right. He twisted the handle, pushed against the wood and froze. There, just a few metres in front of him on the floor lay Draco Malfoy. His blond hair unkempt and loosely hanging around his pale face, one arm outstretched, the other cradled against his chest. His eyes were closed, his lips slightly apart. His alabaster cheek rested in what looked like a drying patch of blood.
“Sure thing, mate!
His pink lips stopped moving and the corners of his mouth twisted into a slight frown as he turned his head away from Harry. The black-haired wizards had to blink multiple times to get his brain to start working again. He hadn't noticed it froze around the time Malfoy had told him he wanted more than forgiveness.
his usual companion at his side. He needed the charming, handsome young wizard at his side; let himself be calmed by the soothing sound of his soft voice and the warm touches of his big hands on his shoulder, arm or back.
“So, you mean that I should just go there and let them decide my future as a half-human? Just like that?”
Harry Potter had made it his mission to follow the blond nearly everywhere. He had been there for meals, always frowning in the direction of the Slytherin table. He had been there when Draco had decided to skip yet another lesson and had walked around the castle aimlessly. He had not noticed the Gryffindor following him at first, until one evening on top of the Astronomy Tower, his voice had caught him off guard.
Just as she was about to pick the of dust smelling tome up to put it back into its shelf, she could hear hurried feet running into her direction, but before she could do more than open her mouth to chastise the person from running in the hallway, someone collided with her and send the old, fragile book flying out of her hand. It landed on the floor with a deafening thud. The thin spine immediately fell off the cover and landed on the cold stone floor.
Draco’s eyes widened as he set eyes on the Gryffindor common room for the very first time. Plush, red couches and seats littered the room, soft carpets covered the dark wooden floor, and the lighting was warm and inviting. This room was the exact opposite of the Slytherin common room, and he couldn’t help but feel the slight tinge of jealousy that shot through him.
.” Draco swallowed as he heard his own voice waver. His father had gone deathly pale, his fingers were clutching onto the thin porcelain cup, his knuckles slowly turned white.
What took them so long?
“Mr. Malfoy! Would you please stop making such a fuss?”
„You’re crazy!“
“No way,” he laughed his amazing laugh, his voice rich and low, causing warm butterflies to race through my system, landing in my groin, stomach and cheeks, warming all of these areas in both the right and very wrong way.
Harry took a deep breath and watched his boyfriend apologetically.
“So, I came to apologize to you about… everything. I’m sorry about how I acted, how Pansy acted, that Pansy was even
*~*PBHB*~*
They stayed like that for a while, just enjoying the feel of someone there. After a few, short minutes, Narcissa ran a slender hand through his hair and smiled at him. She had unshed tears in her eyes that she didn't even bother to blink away - something she would have done immediately if his father had been in the room.
Throwing a glance over his shoulder, Draco tried to push the stubborn Pansy out of the bedroom. "Just leave, damn it! Leave before Harry-"
Definitely one of my favourites and a rather new one as well.
He exhaled shakily and let his eyes travel over the interior of the
“Get out of the fucking way!” Draco’s eyes ran over the interior of the room behind her. It was empty. “I need to-“
"He has changed. He seemed as if he really wanted us to get along, now that we're out of school and the war is over." He turned around, a beige pair of trousers in his hands and sighed. "I don't want to keep on with these stupid rivalries, 'Mione. I've had enough of them during the war. Just give him a chance. As will I."
“That’s it! You’re coming with me!”
And waited.
“Then don’t act as if you’re deaf.”
On his slow and painful way there, he had to accept the fact that that was not about to happen as white spots pushed themselves into his vision, closing in on him, until he collapsed in a bloody heap on the polished mahogany floor his mother loved so much.
Draco swallowed past tears that were threatening to tumble out of his eyes.
fault that Harry would be hurt by this
Head held low, he walked through the Entrance Hall, and shuffled through people who had started on the preparation and through those, who were wandering around aimlessly, still in shock of what had happened.
"Mother," he cursed inwardly as he heard the coarse quality of his usually so smooth voice, betraying the panic he was trying to suppress. "Please. Don't make me do this."
“Well, I don’t know!” Dean answered exaggeratedly.
She stood there, trembling and breathing rapidly, staring daggers at her husband who stood in front of them, a shocked expression on his face and completely frozen. “You will accept his decision,” she said in a much quieter voice, grabbing Draco’s hand and pulling him out of the room, leaving her husband behind.
This couldn’t be. She couldn’t have… Oh Merlin, she needed to find Harry. She needed to make this right again, explain to him what an idiot she had been, and make him see that he had been right about Malfoy and she had been wrong.

Harry sighed and leaned back against Draco’s shoulder, putting his arms around said waist and feeling the blond’s arm pull him towards him even more.
Grumbling, I tried to push a lone strand of white-blond hair back, without throwing a fit of rage when it decided to jump back onto my forehead, where it tickled my temple like there was no tomorrow. I glared at the mirror.
"I promise to cherish it and keep it safe," Draco whispered before placing the hand that was wearing Harry's heirloom against his cheek, kissing him softly. "I promise. This means the world to me, love."
you to protect me. What I want and need is your trust. I need you to trust my ability to keep myself safe and I need you to put all of your energy into that trust and work together with me! I know the Death Eaters are after you. I know Voldemort is after you,” he said in a low, controlled voice and pointed at his bandaged inner arm.
I huffed, shot a last glare in the mirror’s direction and marched my way down into the kitchen where my dear darling of a boyfriend tried to get an explanation and probably an apology out of a barn owl that was staring at him with confused and slightly annoyed amber eyes.
“Zabini?” she asked faintly. It was slowly dawning on her that she had made a humongous mistake.
"Harry!" Hermione was the first one to barrel into him, almost knocking him over. "Goodness, it's been way too long since I've seen you! How are you?"
*~*HP*~*
He blinked and shook his head rapidly to get those wicked thoughts out of his mind. Where the hell did that come from?
, he thought, amused.
"I know and I'm sorry, Harry. Believe me, I truly am, but I have to go. There was some kind of emergency at the potions shop and the apprentice apparently managed to set fire to the more toxic ingredients that we keep behind the counter, so I have to sort it out. But I promise I'll come back as soon as possible."
The raven-haired wizard felt a shudder run down his spine as he moved towards the grand staircase leading to the upper floor, careful to not let the cloak ride up over his shoes. The portraits might be silent, but they still had eyes and – no doubt – strong voices.
changed.
His heart was beating too fast, and it was slowly getting difficult to get enough air into his lungs. The room was too stuffy, too hot.
Draco sniffed and laughed sadly. He knew that question would be coming. He had waited for it. “Yes,” he whispered. “Very sure.”
I hope you enjoyed reading!
hear you.”
He didn't feel the usual butterflies somersaulting in his stomach as Draco's thumb ghosted over the back of his hand, only emptiness, which increased as he saw the apologetic look in his boyfriend's eyes.
Ginny nodded, her eyes fixed on the flicking flames of the fire. “It’s still weird, though. Thinking of those two as a… well…
The only thing he could hear was his fast heartbeat, as his heart thumped against his rib cage, trying to burst out. His rapid, somewhat irregular breathing that he wasn't able to get under control made him even more nervous.
“That doesn’t mean you have to do that in public,” the rest of her retort was interrupted by a loud shrill sound, catching the attention of everyone in the ball room and the three reluctant heroes just outside the door.
Ginny turned around the next corner, still deep in her musings, as she heard a familiar voice echo through the hallway in front of her. She stopped abruptly, blinking. Behind her in the adjoining hallway, she could hear a group of students approaching, babbling loudly about Quidditch. Heart beating fast, she looked for a hiding place before she spotted a suit of armour that would do a perfect job.
Until next time - see ya :D
Harry cursed and hurried towards the door to pick up his cloak. Raising his wand, he layered charm over charm onto the old wood of the door, hoping against all hope that it would buy them time.
Silence followed afterwards, filling the medical ward completely. The only sound Draco could hear were the soft airy breaths of both men in the room, as well as his own heart beat as it continued to beat quicker than normally. He blamed the raven head, who had started to play with his fingers. It looked so innocent, but the slight smirk on his handsome face told Draco that Harry knew
A Veela? Me? No. No, that must be some kind of misunderstanding. There’s absolutely
He gulped down his third firewhiskey in one go, grimacing slightly as the liquid burned down his throat. He hastily turned around as two women, went past him, saying something about wanting a photograph with and an autograph from the hero. He gulped and raised his whiskey glass towards his lips, only to notice that it was empty. He glanced over his shoulder towards the bar, loaded with bottles of white wine, red wine, sparkling wine, whiskey, firewhiskey, butterbeer and for some odd reason bananas.
“This whole I’m-untouchable-and-emotionless-thing you have going on since I know you. Why are you doing this?”
"Ah, Draco," the voice of his father said, and he looked at the hooded figure that stood directly above the defenceless girl. "You're in time. Excellent. Our Lord will be here any minute now. He will not want to miss you joining his ranks."
But on this day, he knew that he had never had a choice; not really. Deep down he had always known that this day would come, even though he had done his best to not accept his imminent fate. He had wanted a future. He had wanted a choice. He had wanted a life, but all of this would be taken from him within the next couple of hours, he realised, as he stared into the pitch black night that enveloped everything around him.

He should be used to it by now, he told himself and sank to the ground, trying to enjoy the hot rain. He was used to everyone wanting to know what was going on in his private life, his

"Perfect!" Pansy rubbed her hands together; her eyes began to shine at the new prospect of a front page story. "How are you planning to go about this?"
But he did not move as he stared into the bloodshot eyes of their victim that were pleading him to help. They were brown. It was a beautiful brown, almost like melted chocolate.
The thin witch turned around, eyes widening when she set her eyes on the blond. “Draco?” she exclaimed, not believing what she saw.
So, in a way, this was Harry's desperate cry for… for what? What did he want?
“Kingsley is calling the Order together, but it’s difficult to get enough people to join this mission,” Remus’ voice filled the room as soon as he had stepped over the threshold. He walked over to the table and leaned against it, turning towards his surrogate godson and his friends. He had an apologetic smile on his face.
