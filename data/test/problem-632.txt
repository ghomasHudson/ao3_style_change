Harry couldn’t hold back anymore. They crashed together in a passionate kiss, tongues caressing and exploring each others’ mouths like the world was about to end. Harry’s fingers slipped under Draco’s borrowed jumper, brushing against his skin. When Draco moaned in response, Harry pulled it off entirely and kissed down to his chest, flicking his tongue over Draco’s nipples and drawing out another moan.
Draco nodded.
“Hey!”
Bolstered by newfound bravado, Harry leaned closer, face next to Malfoy’s. “Can I call you Draco?” His heart was pounding. There was a distinct possibility that this was a terrible idea. “I want to call you Draco,” he whispered. Harry hadn’t meant for that last bit to slip out, but he was going to own it.
“Well, I knew it was a possibility. I certainly wouldn’t have come to work today if I knew I was going to get quarantined with you.” Malfoy fastidiously brushed a bit of lint off his green Healer’s robes and avoided Harry’s eyes.
“Oh. Yeah.” Harry wished he felt the same way. Summoning his Gryffindor courage, he said, “I’m not… uh… straight, either.”
“Yes, that’s so good,” he cried. “More, please, Harry.”
Malfoy sighed. He did that quite often, Harry had noticed. “I found evidence of the disease on Potter,” he said reluctantly. The rest of the group drew back, distancing themselves from where Harry and Malfoy were standing.
“Why did you drop your shield charms?” Harry asked. And why am I always the one with all the questions and none of the answers? But he didn’t say that bit out loud.
Malfoy turned to him, looking miserable. “No, you’re not sick. But you have been exposed to the disease, so you might get sick, or you might get others sick if you interact with them.”
“Sorry,” Eggert responded. “I assumed you did it on purpose or something. Haven’t you noticed? Your protective charms have dropped, and as you were the one in closed proximity to Mr. Potter, we can’t take any chances on letting you out.”
“You naughty boy. You like being my plaything. You like when I manhandle you.”
Draco moaned in response, rutting faster against Harry. “Yes, yes, I’m so naughty.”
“I didn’t want to hope,” Harry admitted. “I’ve liked you for so long, I thought I might just be reading too much into the situation.”
With that, the team hurriedly traipsed out of the house without a backward glance, leaving a stunned Harry and a chagrined Malfoy alone in Grimmauld’s living room.
It was just that had been so long since Harry had been, ahem, intimate with anyone. And that he had recently accepted his bisexuality and even more recently begun to actually date men. And that Malfoy was so bloody close, talking and exhaling and looking so intent. The pounding of Harry’s heart had everything to do with proximity to another man, with the dry spell he’d been on recently, with his lack of experience with men. Nothing to do with Malfoy himself, of course. Of course.
Harry turned his head and found himself practically nose-to-nose with the other man. He was trembling all over. “God, Malfoy. Draco.” The whimper in his voice was clear. “If you only knew what you do to me.”
The two men continued rutting against each other, breathing hard. Draco reached down and grabbed both of their cocks in one hand. The sight of his own prick pressed against Draco’s was so erotic Harry almost came on the spot. “Here,” he said, grabbing his wand and casting a quick lubrication charm. Draco wanked them both while he continued to roll his hips, sliding their cocks against his hand and each other.
Harry scrambled for something to say. “Nice to meet you,” was what he came up with. “You still haven’t answered my question, though. Why are you all here?”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Malfoy shot back, that dangerous glint back in his eye. “How should I make this more entertaining for you?” His voice was suddenly sultry. Like their friendly conversations, Malfoy’s flirting was becoming more and more common, too. Harry usually found himself too flustered to flirt back, and too insecure that he’d read the situation all wrong and this was just what being friends with Malfoy was like.
“Hang on, Healer Eggert,” Malfoy interjected, addressing his boss. “Why am I being quarantined?”
This was going to be worse than Harry had anticipated. He’d thought the examination could be done magically—and it could—but it turned out he had to undress to his pants in order for the spell to work properly. Fingers trembling, praying Malfoy didn’t have to get too close, Harry stripped. When he was done, he stood, waiting for Malfoy to get started and blushing furiously. His only consolation was that Malfoy seemed to be as uncomfortable as he was. Gone was his fleeting confidence from earlier. Malfoy’s ears and face were reddened, and he’d not said a word since Harry began undressing.
Malfoy sighed. Moving closer, he waved his wand over Harry’s body, casting whatever spells he needed non-verbally. Harry gulped as Malfoy’s breath ghosted over his neck. It seemed Malfoy would need to move his wand across Harry’s entire body as well as inspect the skin manually. “Shouldn’t you tell me what you’re going to do before you do it?” Harry asked. It was an idiotic thing to say, seeing as Janice’s presence pretty much meant Harry could either be inspected or face the wrath of the DMLE, but he had to say something. Malfoy was so bloody silent, and it was driving Harry mad.
Harry murmured the lubrication charm again, slicking his finger before slowly inserting it into Draco’s arsehole. Draco panted and moaned, forgetting to wank himself and Harry.
A huff escaped Harry’s lips, and Malfoy looked up from his inspection of Harry’s waist, startled. “All right, Potter?” he murmured, and his low voice made Harry’s stomach drop.
“Let me be the one to let you know: you are definitely not reading into the situation. I like you too, Harry.” He paused, rolling his hips again. “I like this,” he murmured against Harry’s neck. “I want you, not just because we’re stuck together for two weeks. I’ve wanted you for years now, too.”
“Wait, he’s going to be in here with me? For two weeks?” Harry couldn’t believe his bad luck. It was enough to make him wish he was back in the tiny tent in Northern Ireland.
“Why are you telling me this?” Harry asked.
Draco swallowed. “Yeah, you can call me Draco,” he responded softly, the words ghosting over Harry’s face.
Harry smiled and obligingly removed the offending item. Draco ground against him and pressed their bare chests together. It felt incredible, better than anything he’d ever done in his life. Harry made a disappointed sound when Draco drew back, but was quickly even more excited. Draco reached between them and untied Harry’s joggers, and Harry did the same for him. They both stood quickly to tug off their trousers.
Harry nodded, leading them into the entryway of Grimmauld Place and feeling grateful he’d finally found a way to undo the sticking charms that had plastered the hallway with portraits of horrid Black family members.
The last two Healers finished inspecting the kitchen and entered the living room where Harry, Malfoy, Janice, and the rest of the Healers were waiting. “All finished up,” the one who seemed to be the boss of the others said. “No trace of the disease in any of the rooms.”
“Please what?” Harry demanded.
“How do you know I haven’t gotten you lot sick?” Harry asked.
That was all Malfoy needed. He moved the last inch, kissing Harry at last. Harry reacted immediately, melting into the kiss and pulling Malfoy closer. Malfoy—no, Draco, Harry had to keep reminding himself—climbed onto his lap, settling down so their pelvis fit together deliciously. Draco rolled his hips and sucked on Harry’s neck, drawing frantic moans from the other man.
“Are you kidding me?” Draco sounded breathless. “Watching you undress is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”
Harry blushed and choked, as he always did when Malfoy started speaking in innuendos, but gathered his wits to retort, “I’m sure you’ll think of something,” coyly, before changing the subject. “By the way, you can call me Harry, if you want.”
Malfoy took a deep breath. “Just about finished!” He called back. “Be out in a moment.” He looked back at Harry, climbing to his feet. “Get dressed,” he said, smirking. Stunned, mind swirling, Harry obeyed without a word. What on earth had just happened?
Malfoy let out another impressive sigh. “Yes, I suppose.” He said, his signature drawl dripping with boredom. Harry was so taken aback that Malfoy had actually agreed with him that he didn’t have a chance to respond before Malfoy launched into a description of what he would do, the spells he’d be using, and the magical theory that made the spells work, all the while waving his wand across Harry’s head, neck, arms, chest, and back. All the while leaning very close to Harry, breathing on him, raising goosebumps and heating his flesh with his very presence. Harry was struggling to listen and keep control of his body.
“I know what you meant, Potter.” Malfoy’s voiced was tinged with bitterness and his face clouded. He made himself a sandwich and sat down at the table. “Are you always this blindingly heterosexual?”
“I- I-… I just meant…” Harry stammered.
“We’re gonna be here together for a while, Malfoy. Might as well get comfortable.”
“Fuck, yes.” Draco removed his own pants as Harry wriggled out of his. Harry settled back down on the couch, suddenly feeling a bit shy. He reached for Draco and pulled him back down to straddle him.
“Look at me,” Malfoy breathed into his ear.
Someone pounded on the door, breaking the silence and the boys’ staring contest. Both Harry and Malfoy jumped, and Malfoy lowered his hand, which seemed to Harry like it might have been reaching out to touch him.
Just then, Malfoy shifted, moving his hand off his lap and onto the cushion between them. Was he making a move? Was he asking Harry to make a move? Was he just getting more comfortable? If Harry couldn’t concentrate on the film before, he certainly couldn’t now. Voldemort could burst into the room, naked and singing, and Harry wasn’t sure he’d notice. Filled with nerves, Harry swallowed. Then he moved his hand to the cushion as well. That was as far as he’d go. He’d leave the rest to Malfoy.
“Full physical examination, remember?” Malfoy said, looking a bit uncomfortable now that he was looking up at Harry from his position on the floor. His earlier confidence seemed to snap back in place, and he grinned up at Harry. “Bet you never thought I’d get on my knees for you, eh Potter?”
At least it was only sulking and not a proper fight. Harry was tired of fighting Malfoy. For whatever reason, after saving Malfoy from that fire, he just couldn’t find it in him to hate him anymore. However, they hadn’t interacted much since Harry had testified on Malfoy’s behalf after the war, so Harry had no idea if Malfoy felt the same way or not. He really didn’t know anything about what Malfoy had been up to, besides that he’d become a Healer. His lack of proximity to Malfoy had put a stop to his school-boy stalking.
“Oi, Potter.” Malfoy shook Harry out of his reverie. “Fancy a film after our dinner?”
Harry collapsed back on the couch, Draco draping himself over him. “Fuck, Draco,” he panted. Draco reached up and kissed him sweetly before cuddling into his chest. Harry’s hand lazily rubbed circled on Draco’s back.
Midway into the movie, Malfoy stood up. “I need the toilet, be right back.” Harry nodded in acknowledgement, pausing the film.
“Please put your finger in my arse. Please, I need you inside me.”
Harry sighed. “Carry on, then,” he said resignedly.
After their cup of tea, which they drank in awkward silence, Harry showed Malfoy to a guest bedroom and retired for the night, half-hoping that he’d wake in the morning to find this had all been a terrible, bizarre dream.
The next five minutes were the worst of Harry’s life. Harry occupied himself by making a list of things he’d rather be doing. Drinking bubotuber pus. Emptying the stake out latrine without magic. Walking in on Ron and Hermoine having sex.
In the afternoon, Malfoy emerged from his room again. “Can I have some food?” He asked, still a little snippy.
Harry was just about to give up hope of Malfoy doing anything when he felt a pinky brush against his. Terrified to move and break the spell, he sat as still as possible while Malfoy’s hand moved closer, until their pinky fingers were fully pressed together. Harry let out a soft breath, almost a moan, and would have been embarrassed except the sound clearly galvanized Malfoy into action. In one swift movement, Malfoy grabbed Harry’s hand and laced their fingers together. When Harry glanced over, Malfoy was looking straight ahead, but his pleased smile matched Harry’s perfectly.
Malfoy snorted. “Much to the disappointment of the Malfoy family, I am very gay.”
“Does that mean you’re not?” Harry’s heart was suddenly pounding. If he wasn’t straight, and Malfoy wasn’t either…
Now it was Malfoy’s turn to be speechless. “Uh, okay.”
“Well, it’s about to get weirder,” Malfoy said, and dropped to his knees.
“What does that mean?” Harry asked. “Am I sick?”
Draco cut him off. “It’s true. How have you not noticed that I’ve been flirting with you this entire week?”
The answer made Harry groan and thrust forcefully into Draco. “Fuck, Draco. You’re so hot. You’re gonna make me come if you keep that up.”
Harry whimpered, overcome by the eroticism of the moment. He slipped one hand into Draco’s hair, pulling it roughly. His other hand trailed down Draco’s back, sliding over his arse and between the cheeks. It was Draco’s turn to whimper as Harry’s finger ghosted over his hole.
“I will watch a film with you,” Malfoy said abruptly. “Will you tell me how it works?”
“Malfoy!” Harry squeaked, and the other man paused. Harry didn’t think it could get worse than this.
“Yes, of course I have a bloody kitchen,” Harry grumbled before leading Malfoy down the hallway.
Baneberry was in high demand as of late. The fruit was used to brew strong and undetectable poison and was a key ingredient in a potion that made trace amounts of magic visible to the drinker, making it highly useful to those engaged in illicit activities. However, these particular smugglers clearly hadn’t thought to use any Tonic for Trace Detecting, so despite the few times Harry and his fellow Aurors had accidentally let some magic escape, their stakeout only lasted a few days before they intercepted a shipment and rounded the bastards up.
“Yeah, I’d say so.
“Yes, well, no one says no to Father,” Draco muttered. “If you write Andromeda and my mother tonight, then surely we’ll be able to pick a day for the visit tomorrow.”
“Bye, Mr. Potter.”
He silently willed Harry to drive a little slower. To let him pretend a little longer.
Draco sighed, glancing at the tangled mess of yarn and needles sitting in front of him. “Well, I’m surprised my knitting didn’t burst into flames, to be quite honest.”
Harry watched as Draco hesitantly reached his arm out, softly running his fingers over the yarn.
Blaise sighed, his gaze flickering from Draco’s face to his wrist and back again. “Don’t worry, love. You’ll get your mark soon enough.”
Harry looked up only to find Draco smiling softly at him.
“I’m honestly not sure,” Harry said, sighing as he leaned into the back of the couch, “and I can’t exactly go up to him and say, ‘hey, two questions. One, are you queer? And two, want to go on a date with me?’ while he’s shopping for yarn.”
“Yeah. Well, they say you can knit anything as long as you’ve got the knit stitch and the purl stitch down,” Harry said, grinning.
“And I’m not asking you to change,” Harry said. “I’m just asking you to consider giving this—us—a chance.”
A thick silence fell over the table as they patiently waited. Harry could hear soft murmurs of discussion coming from the other side of the wall, but it was largely too quiet to make out.
“Ready?” he asked.
“Really? I had
“Hiya,” he said, setting Stockinette’s bowl down in front of her.
“Despite the fact that Malfoy is an annoying prat, I’m still your wingman,” Ron said hastily, winking before following Hermione towards the staircase.
“Oh, good! I love Cauldron Cakes!” Teddy said before turning to Draco. “Do you like Cauldron Cakes?”
“Yeah, absolutely,” Harry said.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Please, I
“I —” Harry sighed. “I don’t want to say goodbye.”
Draco could feel that he was on the cusp of an orgasm, his bollocks drawing closer to his body and the heat in his abdomen building. A few more thrusts and he would be gone.
After a minute of tense silence, Hermione rounded the corner, dressed in fitted jeans and a burnt orange jumper that Harry had knit for her a while back.
“I’d love some coffee,” Harry said.
Then, he handed Harry a much smaller present. Harry took it, feeling its surprising weight in the palm of his hand. As he unwrapped it, he racked his brain for what it could be, but it wasn’t until he pulled the amber colored glass Snitch out that he put two and two together.
,” Harry murmured. “I can do that.”
“Fine,” Hermione snapped. “This is just completely ridiculous. I’m the first one to advocate for strong relationships between departments, but a
“Hey,” Harry began, taking a seat next to Draco. “It’s going to be alright. This is a do-over, a clean slate. And if you’re going to be lurking around the shop, you might as well get to know Ron and Hermione, you know? Plus, Hermione was the one who taught me how to knit, so she might be of some use when it comes to teaching you.”
“So, I initially thought about making you a jumper,” Harry began in an attempt to fill the daunting silence, “but it’s bad luck in the knitting community to knit a jumper for a romantic partner that you’re not married to. Legend says that it will make the relationship end and, well … I know we weren’t dating when I began thinking about all of this, but I thought to myself ‘what if?’ So, I landed on a hat.”
, Potter. We’re not schoolboys anymore. Red does not inherently equal Gryffindor.”
Harry let out a bark of laughter, elbowing him in the side. “Are you going to finally admit that you need help with it?”
Draco raised his eyebrows as curiosity set in behind his eyes. “And how, pray tell, did you try to find proof?”
PS For the Draco hat that my wife and I are designing, I will be putting an update on my notes when it's finished! However, the most sure way for you to see the announcement is to follow me on Tumblr @thesleepiesthufflepuff. ALSO, I've already got plans in the works for a sequel next December, so this isn't goodbye. Not yet, anyway.
“Christ.” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose.
After Oisín cleared the table with a wave of their wand, the four of them exited the house via the back door. The rain hadn’t relented in the hour that had passed, and a crack of lightning lit up the charcoal colored sky.
Teddy immediately ran over to Harry, who stood up and enveloped him in a fierce hug, lifting him up and swinging him in a circle before setting him down. He then greeted Andromeda, giving her a tight squeeze before briefly kissing her cheek.
Harry nodded in agreement. “I was thinking the same thing. I’ve got to admit that I’m also eyeing the lemon tart.”
“Alright, salmon is done and the potatoes are now in the oven. Thank you for the wine, by the way. It smells lovely,” Andromeda said before taking a small sip. "So, how’s everything?”
“I’m sorry about Kingsley,” Harry said, frowning, “although I’m sure he’s been good for business. Is there anything I can do to help?”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “Potter, I’m trusting you. If this blows up in my face ―”
Scooping Stockinette into his arms, Harry carried her out into the living room and plopped down on the couch. She quickly wriggled her way out of his arms, making a beeline for the back of the couch. There, her lanky silver body spread out, and she silently fell asleep.
Draco leaned in, looping his arms around Harry’s waist as he pressed their noses together. “Thank you for coming, Harry ― and thank you for being mine.”
, he thought to himself before moving onto the next flavor that stood out, which was dark chocolate with ribbons of fudge and chunks of Maltesers. However, as soon as he saw the Ferrero Rocher flavor, he knew he’d made his decision.
Rolling his eyes, Harry turned back to his task at hand ― decorating the shop. He had closed up an hour ago, and while there was nowhere he’d rather be than in his bed, he needed to get the holiday decorations done.
, it took me forever to finally feel as though I was capable without Hermione’s supervision. As frustrating as it is, knitting is something that takes a lot of time and patience.”
“Alright, salmon should be done. You can tell me more about this mystery man over dinner. Now, come help me set the table, you two.”
“Yes, I
They fucked each other, and nothing more.
Harry nodded. “I did. Is it … okay?”
Harry anxiously glanced at his watch for the fifth time in three minutes, his eyes then flickering to the front door of the shop. Outside, the morning was dark, quiet, and drizzly, the only semblance of light coming from floating, dimly lit lanterns that lined the cobbled alley.
“Well, I suppose we shouldn’t get into it now, but she saved me that night in the Forbidden Forest. If not for her, I wouldn’t be alive,” Harry said.
Draco raised an eyebrow, startled. “Sure. What kind of errand?”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Look, Potter, now’s not really the time—”
“So,” Draco began, placing a soft kiss to the top of Harry’s head, “how was that?”
the needles.
“Potter, I don’t think that’s ―”
Draco turned to him, his eyes solemn, and gave him a weak smile. “Well, thankfully it’s all in the past. Now, how about we start our game?”
He looked good.
Harry sniggered. “Well, why don’t I take a look at it after dinner?”
“I visit her a lot, since Teddy is my godson. I saw them yesterday, and we got to talking about how she wants to build a relationship with you and your mum but is too afraid to go about it. I was wondering if you had any interest in doing the same,” Harry said.
“Well, this was lovely of you, Harry,” Narcissa said. “Can I get anyone tea or coffee?”
“Fuck me,” Harry muttered through soft pants as he peered down at Malfoy. “Please. I need you inside me.”
“She’s not sure, so I figured this book might be of use,” Draco said.
“You never asked,” Draco said, turning to him and shrugging.
Harry shuddered at the change of temperature as they walked into Florean Fortescue’s Ice-Cream Parlor, the warmth from the shop seeping into him. It was relatively busy, although Harry wasn’t surprised. Since Florean’s death, his daughter, Amelia, had been doing everything she could to keep the place in tip-top shape.
“Oh! Right. Well,” Harry said, pausing on the path and wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck, “I had a lovely time. Thank you for inviting me.”
Harry nodded. “That makes sense. What kind of pet is she leaning towards?”
“Me neither. I’ll do anything,” Draco said, the hint of a smile playing on his lips.
“Luck? Pans, I don’t—” Draco paused, his stomach twisting into tight knots as he looked at Pansy, his cappuccino, and back again.
Harry reached down, taking his own, heavy cock in hand and beginning to pump it up and down. Precome was leaking from his tip, and he could feel that he was growing close once again.
“In that case—” Potter pushed Draco up against the nearest wall and slotted his leg between Draco’s thighs. “—I guess you could say that the rumors are true.”
“I’m so sorry,” Harry said.
“Are you okay, Malfoy? Do you need something ―?"
Draco let out a weary sigh, and he rolled his eyes. “You’re ridiculous. Let’s get this on with.”
Draco led them to the first stall, which was only a few feet to their left. A large shimmering banner above it read
Laoise turned around, leaning against the kitchen counter. “Since he first opened The Whomping Willow Woolery. We knew Harry was going to be successful from the start. There’s just something special about him.”
After forty minutes, Harry found himself deeply immersed in coconut curry over noodles and fresh, warm naan bread. Stockinette, having grown quite curious, was sitting opposite Harry on the coffee table, her tail swishing in anticipation.
Draco shook his head. “I did as a child, but not now. It seems silly to worry over who someone’s attracted to after all that’s happened.”
From there, Harry was able to relax a little. Once everyone had been served tea and had taken a biscuit ― or four, in both Hermione and Arthur’s cases ― small conversations began to break out amongst the group. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all was the fact that Ron and Narcissa were sitting next to each other, engrossed in an intense conversation about chess. Arthur, Hermione, and Andromeda were discussing different Muggle contraptions that Arthur had been recently tinkering with, and Teddy was lolling around on the wooden floor, playing tea party with his plastic dinosaurs.
After a moment of hesitation, Draco’s hand landed on a deep mustard colored skein with flecks of white and red in the wool. Harry grinned, that particular color being one of his favorites from the collection.
“Thanks, ‘Mione.”
“And I’ve got the solution,” Pansy said, pulling out a small glass vial filled with sparkling gold liquid. She quickly uncorked the lid and poured the contents into Draco’s cappuccino. He watched, mouth slightly ajar, as the golden liquid dissolved into his coffee, leaving behind a shimmery film on the top. “Everyone needs a bit of luck now and then.”
He ate breakfast in silence, his thoughts turning to the date that was indicated on the calendar hanging on the wall.
“How did you even know about the Tower of London Ice Rink? That’s where we’re going, isn’t it ―?” Harry asked.
He pressed the pad of his index finger against the doorbell and then waited.
Harry snorted. “And how’s that going for you?”
“Thanks,” Harry murmured.
“You’re telling me,” Draco wheezed, “that eleven-year-old you was so determined to convict me that you brewed Polyjuice Potion and snuck into the common room as my bloody best friends.”
By the time the workshop ended at noon, most people had managed to make a decent amount of progress in their scarves, and Harry felt a rush of both excitement and proudness. Teaching this workshop was one of the biggest highlights of running the shop, and he always left it feeling much better than he had going in.
“Merlin,
After scrawling out a quick note saying it wasn’t an issue and that tomorrow would work perfectly fine, Harry resumed scarfing down his bowl of cereal and cup of coffee. Casting a
Harry had noticed that Draco was also alone, always skulking along the corridors. He took to staring at him during mealtimes, watching his every move just as he had during sixth year ― only this time, it was under vastly different circumstances.
Next chapter goes up: Wednesday, Dec. 2nd (how is it the last day of November???)
Harry let out a bark of laughter. “And yet I don’t see you complaining about it.”
“Well?” he asked.
And so, for the past two years, he’d been stuck living one room away from his childhood enemy who, truth be told, wasn’t quite as awful as he’d expected.
Potter let out a shuddery breath, and Draco could feel his heart hammering against his chest. “Oh God, Malfoy.
“Alright, everyone. Well, welcome to the beginners workshop! As you can see, we’ve got everything you’ll need on the table: knitting needles, yarn, stitch markers, and the list goes on. However, if you find yourself needing something else, please don’t hesitate to let me know.
“How did you manage to become the owner of a yarn shop, then?” Draco asked.
“It’s still pretty strange, to be honest. Laoise and I never imagined we’d be doing so well for ourselves
Ron and Hermione were both alarmed at the rate of Harry’s decline, upping their visits to everyday after work and training. Hermione was the only one who could coax him out of bed, whispering soft words of encouragement as she would help him down the stairs and into the living room. Then, they would spend hours sitting there, Ron and Hermione filling the air with anything they thought would cheer Harry up.
“Merlin,” Harry said, “that’s a heavy question. Well, Christmases with my aunt and uncle weren’t exactly … happy. The only presents I’d get were a few pairs of my cousin’s old socks and a ratty tee shirt if I was lucky. While my aunt, uncle, and cousin ate dinner, I was always sent to clean the kitchen. And once I was done with that, I would be told to go back to my cupboard under the stairs. When I got to Hogwarts, I realized that I didn’t have to go back for Christmas, and that was the end of that. I always either spent the Christmas holiday at school or with the Weasleys. It’s pretty much the same now. I’ll go over to The Burrow on Christmas Eve and spend the night, and then I’ll go back to my flat on the 27th. Hermione, her parents, Andromeda, and Teddy always join us, and it’s just … well, it’s really nice.”
I’ll help you decorate.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Oh, my
Wandering down the hall and to the bedroom, Harry couldn’t help but smile at the memory of seeing Draco’s progress on his scarf, it having looked so much like Harry’s very first project. The first thing he would need to go over with Draco would be the tension in his knitting. His stitches had been unfathomably tight, not uncommon for new knitters, and Harry had noticed that Draco had been having trouble slipping the stitches onto the needles because of it.
Picking his satchel up from the ground, he double-checked that he had his wand, keys, and knitting before taking a moment to simply look at Draco, who was running his slender fingers along the cubbyholes, his pale skin stark against the pops of color.
Harry nodded, his mind churning with ideas. “Okay. I’ve got the pattern for a shawl that I think would really suit her. It’ll require three skeins, and the book that has the pattern would need to be purchased.”
As they headed away from the rink and towards a deserted park, both of their trousers soggy and cold from having landed on the ice, Draco looked towards Harry, grinning. His cheeks were flushed bright pink, as were the tips of his ears, and there was something gut-wrenchingly wonderful about the fact that Harry himself had made Draco this happy.
While Draco spread out the length of the toy train on top of the knee-high shelf in the front window, assorted knitted garments levitating above it, Harry finished stringing the snowflakes, and he swiftly moved onto dragging the fake Christmas tree from the back room and propping it near the check-out counter, its white lights flickering on. No conversation flowed between the two of them, and yet the silence wasn’t uncomfortable. In fact, it was comforting, their presences being more than enough to occupy the space.
Malfoy let out an exasperated sigh. “Trust me, Potter. The feeling’s mutual.”
“And you think I’d get on with both of them?” Draco asked hesitantly.
“Fucking hell.” Draco stared at his cappuccino, his heart thudding heavily against his chest. “Fucking
Draco stumbled out after him, straightening the collar of his coat as he looked around. Ron and Hermione lived in a decently sized flat in the heart of London, the city’s bright lights shimmering against the darkness of the night through the living room window. Their walls were, with the insistence of Hermione, covered in Muggle art prints, and the flat had been brought to life with levitating houseplants hovering next to the fireplace and the couch.
Draco nodded. “Alright. When do we start?”
Taking a leap of faith, Harry reached over and took Draco’s hand in his own. “I can’t imagine how tough everything must be on you, but just know that you don’t have to deal with it alone.”
“Perks of being famous, I suppose,” Harry muttered. “I think I need some change in my life, but I’m not sure where to start.”
“Would you mind if I put some eucalyptus and baby’s breath in the bouquet? Just to break up the dahlias and zinnias,” Malfoy asked.
After a while, Harry broke the silence. “Did you ever think you would end up here?”
“Well,” Harry said, glancing down at his wristwatch, “I was planning on closing up for lunch while I grab something at Florean’s. If you want to join me, we can talk about a schedule there.”
“There’s this pond I used to go to when I’d practice flying over holidays, and I was thinking we could go there. How does that sound?” Draco asked as he began to stroke Stockinette’s back.
In all honesty, he knew knitting was to be mostly credited for his recovery. If Hermione hadn’t brought that cheap skein of yarn over that fateful night, he never would have learned how to move on from the war. It was as though each stitch had healed him in some way, scabbing over wounds that had been open for years one project at a time.
These moments were Draco’s favorites — the ones where Harry looked like
Harry nodded. “Perfect.”
Draco looked up, blinking at him. “My aunt?”
Harry raised an eyebrow.
Harry blinked, realizing that his mind had been wandering. Draco was staring at him, his eyebrows knit together in concern.
“Wait, Pans—” Draco scrambled out of his seat, but he was too late. He watched as Pansy pushed open the café door and walked outside, her belted cherry-red pantsuit looking stark against the dreary overcast morning.
“Alrighty,” Amelia said before turning to Draco, her smile tightening. “And you, sir?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Not what I meant, you git.”
Narcissa nodded. “Alright. This way, then.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “There’s nothing ‘in it’ for me, you git. I love teaching. That’s it.”
Harry waited another moment to see if Andromeda needed help. However, it was clear that she could use a minute to herself when he could hear soft sobs coming from the bedroom.
Harry shook his head, ushering her in the direction of the door. “We’ll be fine, Andy. Go drink a big glass of water.”
When Harry woke the following morning, he found his mouth full of fur. After taking a moment to gather his surroundings, he realized that Stockinette had spread out on the pillow next to him, her tail lounging across Harry’s lips. He sat up, aggressively combing his tongue with his fingers in an attempt to free it of any rogue hairs. He had little luck.
Draco finally looked up, rolling his eyes. “Oh, alright. Menu, please.”
“That’s amazing, Ted. Did you share?” Harry asked.
“Uh-huh.”
“Well,” Hermione said quietly, “yes. There’s that.”
“Harder, Draco,” Harry begged. “Harder.”
“Oh?” Harry asked cheekily, raising his eyebrows. “Please share.”
As soon as the waiter left, Draco opened the folder and absently fished out five Galleons and three Knuts out of his satchel, placing them on top of the check. Then, after closing the folder, he resumed staring at the cappuccino, his mind churning with confusion.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, everything here is. It’s really only the mass-produced yarns that aren’t hand dyed. Otherwise, you’re likely to be looking at indie dyers. No matter what brand of yarn, each batch of dyed skeins is called a dye lot. With projects that involve more than one skein of yarn, you’ll want to make sure that your skeins are from the same lot, as each one varies in color due to the hand dying aspect. Does that make sense?”
“I’m fine, Sir. Really,” Malfoy said, dusting off the seat of his pants as he shot daggers in Harry’s direction.
, Harry thought to himself.
That is, until he got to know Draco.
Pulling back just enough so that they could look at each other again, Draco reached up and gently took off Harry’s glasses, placing them on the table. “Now you can.”
Draco cautiously worked in the rest of his index finger, followed by another digit. By the time his third finger had entered Harry’s hole, Harry was writhing with want. The burning sensation had lessened, and all he could concentrate on was the steady thrust of Draco’s fingers inside of him, twisting in a way that shot sparks through Harry’s veins.
decorate using magic,” Draco said smugly.
Several minutes passed, and Harry took a look around the table. Everyone seemed to be doing alright, even the seven-year-old who was there with his grandmother. While some of the students, namely Mark, had managed to quickly pick up the flow of knitting and were flying through their rows, others were slower, going at their own pace. After having checked up on everyone, Harry finally let himself turn his attention to Draco, who was scowling at his knitting as he jammed the needles through the stitches on the first row, which everyone else had already managed to move past at this point.
Draco could feel himself growing close—could feel himself coming undone as he looked into Potter’s green eyes. He quickened his hand’s pace, and after a few more rough strokes, he was coming, ribbons of pearly semen spilling over his fist.
Draco gave a hesitant nod. “Alright.”
Teddy shook his head.
Harry could feel heat rising to his cheeks. “Because you deserve forgiveness.”
Raising his wand, Harry cast the incantation for the Disillusionment Charm. After a moment of rearranging, Draco’s face looked similar yet slightly off. His eyes were no longer a deep grey but instead a bright blue, and his now shoulder-length hair was a much darker shade of blond. His nose, which was ordinarily long and thin by all accounts, had morphed into a button shape, giving him the illusion that he was an entirely different person altogether.
When Harry woke on Christmas morning, it took him a moment to remember where he was. It wasn’t until after he blinked blearily, noticing a worn poster of The Weird Sisters hanging awkwardly off the ceiling, that he recalled the fact that he’d been assigned Ginny’s childhood room by Molly. Ginny and Luna weren’t arriving at the Burrow until around noon, as they’d spent Christmas Eve at Xenophilius’ house. Harry had been given the option of sleeping over with Ron and Hermione in Ron’s old room, but he’d quickly declined, not willing to take the chance of hearing his two best friends snogging. Plus, he’d gotten used to sleeping alone. For the most part.
knitting lessons. Second of all … we don’t have to talk about the past, you know,” Draco said quietly.
Draco blinked at him earnestly. “You mean that?”
Harry shrugged. “You’re the florist.”
“Sorry, Harry, but Ron’s got a point. You couldn’t keep your eyes off him,” Hermione said.
“Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry coughed, shoving Draco off of him. “Did you
Harry smiled warmly at him. “I look forward to it.”
“Yeah,” Harry said softly. “It’s silly, really, but I wanted Teddy to have a piece of Remus’ best friend ― well, more than best friend, I guess. I always suspected there to be something else between Remus and Sirius than just friendship. Anyway, Sirius’ Animagus was a black dog, so …”
Okay, so it's to the stage where I should probably now write the last two chapters 😂
As soon as Harry set Stockinette down on the ground, Crookshanks came lumbering out from the kitchen, his thick, weathered body truly showing his age. Stockinette began creeping towards Crookshanks, the two of them staring at each other in the process. Harry found himself holding his breath, hoping that Crookshanks would decide to be reasonably cordial. He’d brought Stockinette over to Ron and Hermione’s plenty of times, but each visit was different, depending on Crookshanks’ mood.
“Don’t worry. It won’t,” Harry said, shooting him a reassuring smile. “Well, we should probably get going. I just need to grab Stockinette.”
After ten minutes of polite chatter passed, the risotto had finished cooking, and Harry led Draco to the dining table. Stockinette decided to join them as they took their seats, circling around Draco’s chair and eventually curling up at his feet.
A deep blush crept up Draco’s neck, and he let out an embarrassed laugh. “Yeah. I could just see how much you loved it, and, well, I wanted you to have it.”
Harry stepped closer, patting her reassuringly on the back. “Why don’t I help Teddy get dressed? Go take a minute to yourself before we leave.”
Harry tentatively took Malfoy’s hand in his own. “I know so.”
“Yeah?”
Harry let out a light laugh. “Good job.”
Harry was quiet for a moment before he spoke. “Draco, are you happy?”
Harry let out a dry laugh. “Yeah, you could say that.”
Before he knew it, he had slipped into the brink of sleep, flashes of blonde hair and pale skin appearing behind his eyelids.
“Thanks, love,” Draco said, taking it. “Merlin, Harry, this is heavy. What the hell are you giving me, a box of coal?”
Luckily, they didn’t have to walk very far in order to see the sheep. As the four of them stood underneath the back porch’s awning, Harry watched as sheep grazed a few meters away. Beautiful, cream colored wool in need of shearing hung heavily off of their frames, and Harry knew that they were going to produce fantastic fiber.
Christmas without seeing you.”
Harry did just that, tucking himself under one of Molly’s various knitted blankets. “I take it no one else is awake?”
“So, you’re an Auror, then?” Draco asked, looking towards Ron.
Once Draco had fully unzipped Harry’s jeans, he glanced up. “You’re alright with me continuing?”
,” Harry said, dropping his head into his hands. “I’m fucked, aren’t I? I’m really, truly fucked.”
“What the hell, Hermione?” Harry asked, turning to her.
Ron rolled his eyes. “Merlin, ‘Mione, look at him! He’s absolutely lovesick!”
Harry let out a bark of laughter. “
for help.”
Harry’s stomach churned, and he could feel heat rising to his cheeks. He quickly glanced down at the table, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
“I was with my father at a, well,
By the time he made it back to the shop, the rain had just begun to come down, falling to the ground in heavy sheets. After casting a Hot-Air Charm, he peeled off his coat and hung it up, grateful to be back in the warmth of the shop. The radiator had been working for the past few days, which had been a miracle in itself, and Harry hoped to Merlin that his luck would last.
Harry nodded.
“Yeah, with your cock.” Harry snorted. “Dinner, then.”
As soon as it was time to close up the shop, Harry hurried to lock things up before dashing upstairs. Once he’d fed Stockinette dinner, grabbed a bottle of unopened wine from the kitchen counter, and packed his half-knitted jumper, he stepped into the fireplace and disappeared in a burst of green flames.
The next evening, an hour before closing, Harry found himself looking longingly at the door, wishing nothing more than for a particular blond to wander into the shop.
Slowly, Draco stepped forward. “I do. They were always my favorite treat on the Hogwarts Express.”
Harry took it with a burst of nervousness, wondering what Narcissa would say to the idea of meeting up with Andromeda and Teddy.
“I wouldn't miss it for the world,” Harry said politely. “It looks amazing, by the way.”
Malfoy let out a long exhale as he settled into the grass next to him. The silence that fell between them was heavy and tense, and Harry’s stomach lurched as he continued to stare out at the stream, hoping that he wasn’t about to make a further fool out of himself.
“Morning,” Harry said, approaching the couch. “Merry Christmas.”
“Well, actually …” Harry began, heat blooming across his cheeks, “we did try to find proof. We just, well, never could find any.”
The minutes passed by like ice moving along at a glacial pace. By the time 4:01 rolled around, Harry had taken to pacing across the length of his living room, occasionally mumbling to himself about how it would all be fine.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure? There’s no shame in asking for help, you know.”
With that, Draco set to work, gently pushing in and out until he’d obtained a fast, steady rhythm. Harry tipped his head back, his eyes fluttering shut as a groan escaped his mouth. His knuckles tightened around the sheets he was gripping, and he could feel his toes curling as Draco continued to pick up speed, thrusting in and out of him until the different movements blended together.
They began to run down the driveway, Harry occasionally skidding on the slick gravel. By the time they made it to the front of the house, they were both completely soaked through. As Harry led the way up to the porch and knocked, Draco cast a Drying Charm on them. A wave of relief immediately washed over Harry, and he no longer felt as though he was freezing from the inside out.
After a moment of silence, Harry had just begun to accept that he’d ruined the night by saying such a thing when Draco spoke.
After a moment of being consumed in heat, the world stopped spinning, and Harry found himself stepping into Ron and Hermione’s spacious living room. The mouth-watering smell of soy sauce and sautéed vegetables filled the air, causing Harry’s stomach to rumble.
you go for my pillow.”
McWeenie cleared his throat. “Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter!”
With one last nod of agreement, Draco swiftly pulled down Harry’s jeans and pants in one go. Harry could feel his cheeks burning red from embarrassment, and he was overtly aware that Draco wasn’t doing anything. Looking down, he frowned.
Harry let out a bark of laughter. “Uh, yeah. You could say that.”
Draco let out a heavy sigh. “Yeah, and overwhelming, I suppose. She looks much older than I remember, although she’s just as kind. And Teddy is rather amusing, isn’t he? I’d like to show him the albino peacocks when it’s not so dark out. I’m sure he’d like them.”
Harry nodded.
“Okay. Just give me a minute to adjust,” Draco said, and Potter nodded. He paused, letting himself get used to the stretch before hesitantly beginning to raise and lower himself. After a few moments, the pain began to be replaced with pleasure. Draco gripped the back of Potter’s head, pulling him into a deep kiss as he gradually quickened his pace. The sound of skin slapping skin and wet squelches from the lubrication filled the air, along with the sound of October’s first rain hitting the windows.
Just as Harry thought he’d caught a break, one of his regular customers, an older witch by the name of Mrs. Van Ness, insisted that she needed help in picking out wool that would be suitable for a baby blanket.
“I think that the past isn’t what’s important anymore. I can assure you that this git you’re talking about doesn’t look at you with contempt, or resentment, or anger. All he wants is to get to know you now, as the person you’ve become. And he’s scared too; he’s unsure of what this relationship would bring, but he’s realized today that it’s a risk he’s willing to take.”
Draco mustered up a tight-lipped smile. “So, I hear you work for the Ministry now? Which department?”
After Hermione helped him up, she escorted him to the bathroom down the hall, waiting outside while Harry relieved his bladder. Once he was done, they walked back to Sirius’ bedroom, where Harry perched on the edge of the bed and Hermione dug around in a chest drawer for a clean pair of pajamas. Eventually, she pulled out a worn Chudley Cannons t-shirt and fleece pants that had a printed Snitch pattern on them. While Hermione turned around, giving him some privacy, Harry deftly removed his pajamas and exchanged them for the new ones, the feeling of clean fabric foreign against his skin.
Harry leaned forward, their foreheads pressed together, and let out a soft breath. “May I kiss you?”
Draco nodded.
“Great choice. I love that color, although I’ve yet to use it for something,” Harry said.
“God, yeah. Just like that.”
“Is Sarah here tonight?” Harry asked, silently applauding himself for remembering the wife’s name.
“Alright.”
However, this made sleeping over at the Burrow all the more difficult. While trying to fall asleep, he’d found himself staring absently at the ceiling, longing for Draco’s gangly limbs to be sprawled across him.
After stepping through the front door and into the heavy downpour of rain, Harry hastily took out his keys and locked the door behind them. When he glanced up, Draco was giving him a funny look.
They drove until the sun came up.
Background chatter filled the air around him, people of all ages arranging themselves at the long wooden table Harry had transfigured in the middle of the shop. While he always enjoyed hosting the beginners workshop every other month, there was a small part of him that couldn’t shake the disappointment of Draco not showing up.
Draco frowned, setting his half-eaten plate on the coffee table. “I know, Potter. This wasn’t anything out of obligation.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile. “Any time, Malfoy.”
The sound of crunching kibble filled the room.
Draco briefly glanced at his shirt, snorting. “Oh
Also, still SOBBING over the love and support this has been shown so far. Thank you all so, so much for taking the time to read, comment, and leave kudos <3
, he realized he was running a little later than he’d like to and scurried to collect his things.
Looking at the clock, which read 7:15, he let out a groan.
Once Harry had tapped each item with the tip of his wand, Harry set down the menu on the coffee table before leaning back into the couch.
“So, Astoria was …” Harry began.
“Okay,” Harry said, his voice hoarse as his fists gripped the sheets.
“I guess?” Draco said. “I’ve got a career, and friends, and a nice place to live — although my flatmate can sometimes be a bit of a prat—”
That is, until he remembered that it was New Year’s Day, and New Year’s Day meant going over to the Burrow for a grand lunch that Molly had poured her blood, sweat, and tears into.
With a heavy sigh, he began to write.
“You know,” Hermione said, her voice turning serious as she put a hand on Harry’s arm, “I’m really pleased for you, Harry ― we both are. You just seem so … happy.”
“No,” Draco said, sighing. “Alright. Let’s go to Dublin, then.”
Draco wasn’t entirely sure who moved first, but suddenly their lips met, feverishly kissing as hands began to roam. Potter’s lips were chapped and tasted like black coffee. His tongue worked its way into Draco’s mouth, setting his body on fire. He was already achingly hard, and Potter’s leg rubbing against his length certainly wasn’t helping, nor was the way his hands made their way underneath Draco’s jumper, brushing his hardened nipples. Draco let out a soft gasp, which only seemed to encourage Potter further.
The tension was broken when Draco let out a light laugh, gesturing for Harry to pick up the Snitch. “Go on.”
Once they’d queued up, Harry squinted at the menu, raking his eyes over the long list of flavored hot chocolates. He’d tried the majority of them at this point, although there were still a few that he had yet to indulge in. After a moment of contemplation, he landed on the hazelnut hot chocolate.
“Have you ever wanted to learn how to knit?”
Draco slowly tore his eyes away from the risque magazine spread Potter had done for charity, only to find Pansy staring at him, eyebrows raised and mouth quirked knowingly. The cow.
They wandered to the next stall over, which was full of soaps that smelled like magical sweets. Harry watched as Draco picked up a gold colored bar and raised it to his nose.
“No,” Harry said, snorting, “I imagine not.”
“Oh,” Draco said, blushing, “no, we’re not together. We’re just friends.”
The four of them wandered over to the fireplace. Hermione was the first to pick up Floo powder and step inside, saying, “Twelve Grimmauld Place” before disappearing in a burst of green flames. Ron went next, leaving only Harry and Draco.
“So,” Harry said slowly, “what did you think of the workshop?”
Draco sighed. “My family isn’t like yours, Potter. We ordinarily don’t get to choose who we marry. My father had arranged the whole ordeal right before the battle, wanting to ensure that I would lead a good, noble life. My parents were lucky when they were engaged, as they happened to actually love one another. Astoria and I, though … we were a different story. There was a fierce friendship between us, but nothing more. Besides, she was in love with someone else.”
Before Ron could wander off, Harry beckoned for him to come closer, whispering, “what the hell was that about?”
Almost like home, but not quite.
Malfoy pulled back, and they looked at each other. There was something indescribable behind Malfoy’s eyes, like a light that Harry hadn’t noticed before, and it was enough to fill his chest with a strange, unrecognizable warmth. And, as Malfoy began to move, thrusting hard and deliberately, Harry expected the feeling in his chest to dissipate, but it didn’t. Instead, it only grew stronger with each motion.
“Nice try.”
“No, I think those years were important,” Draco murmured, looking down at their hands intertwined. “Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are.”
After removing the glimmer on his scar and changing into a hoodie and fleece pajama bottoms, Harry walked back to the kitchen, where he pulled out a menu for an Indian restaurant down the road. Ever since having discovered that wizarding restaurants did takeaway via owls, Harry had taken great advantage of the convenience, telling himself that he deserved to not cook one or two times a week.
Draco stared at the bare flesh on his inner wrist, naked and unmarked in a way that it wasn’t supposed to be. Across from him, Pansy was droning on about some witch she’d slept with last night while sipping cooly on her mojito. Blaise occasionally chimed in, as did Greg, but most of the conversation was going over Draco’s head.
McWeenie clapped his hands. “Excellent! See, there we are. Teamwork! Doesn’t it feel good? Right. Mr. Malfoy, if you would please stand in front of Mr. Potter, just like so …”
“Well?” Hermione asked, arching her eyebrows as she popped a crisp into her mouth.
Turning back around, Harry greeted Teddy with a wide grin as he approached the bed.
“Do you remember Andromeda?”
McWeenie, who had been making his rounds, eventually wandered over to their area. His face was an unattractive shade of pink and he was wearing his bright, artificial smile as he approached, causing Harry’s stomach to drop.
Looking at his watch one last time, he sighed and sat down at the head of the table.
“One last shag,” Malfoy murmured, their lips brushing. “One last fuck before we go. That’s what I want to give you.”
Silently cursing her, Harry blinked his eyes open. He hated to admit it, but the sight of Hermione immediately made him feel a little warmer. As usual, she was still in her work robes, and her corkscrew curls were pulled away from her face, sitting in a knot on top of her head.
“I’m in here! Can’t leave the risotto!” Harry shouted, his pulse racing.
“Sounds good to me. How about you, Andromeda, and Teddy come over to The Manor at around five? We can have dinner together,” Draco said.
Without pausing, Harry said, “Of course I do. Listen, you were a shithead in school, and you made some fucked up decisions, but I’ve also realized that you were a kid when the war happened, just like me. You were only doing what was asked of you by your parents and by Voldemort ―”
apologies. I wasn’t aware that this bench belonged to you.”
As Harry took in his surroundings, he couldn’t help but shake the feeling that he’d been here all too recently. Stuffing the waves of broken memories from Easter Break of ‘98 as far down as possible, he inhaled deeply.
With a heavy sigh, Harry wandered to the back room, grabbing a ladder before setting it up against the right wall of the shop and beginning to string white and red streamers across the ceiling. Once he had tacked one side up, he moved to the opposite wall, the bright colors standing out against the dark wooden beams.
It wasn’t until the Hogwarts Expresses’ horn blew clear and loud that they pulled back, looking at each other. Malfoy’s cheeks were flushed pink and his chest rapidly rising and falling, and he carefully brushed a curl away from Harry’s face.
As they wandered past a stall selling pasta art, Harry suddenly remembered the letter he had received earlier.
“Yeah. And hey, at least you know the couch is sturdy. Didn’t break!”
“So, Draco,” Oisín began, “how long have you and Harry been dating?”
“Oh, I think you’d get on like a house on fire.”
“Merlin, you’re a sight for sore eyes. We’ve missed you around here,” Andromeda said, the wrinkles around her eyes crinkling as she smiled warmly.
After walking past Eyelops Owl Emporium, briefly pausing to take a look through the frosty window, they entered Broomstix. Harry let out a sigh of relief, the warmth of the shop pricking at his half-numb extremities.
“Okay,” he said, remembering to take a breath. “What exactly is it that you’re looking for?”
“It’s not my fault that Teddy came down with the stomach bug!”
the tree in order to make it fit Kingsley’s request.”
“I … don’t know,” Draco admitted, the tips of his ears growing red.
Quietly humming to himself, he gave a sharp knock on the door before peering up at the sky. Dark clouds hung above, and there was a bite to the air. Draco felt certain that it would begin to lash any minute.
“Alright.”
“I swear to Merlin, Potter, if you try anything funny …” Malfoy muttered.
Harry swallowed hard. “I stopped hating you a long time ago, Draco.”
“Well,” Harry began, pulling a chair up next to where the two of them were seated in the middle of the store, “Andy doesn’t seem
“So, what now?” he asked.
On the table were three healthy bowls of soup, steam curling off the surface. Before the war, Molly’s chicken soup had been one of his favorite meals. Now, the sight and smell of it only made him nauseated.
Harry grinned, excitement thrumming through him as he quickly grabbed a piece of parchment and pencil. He, Ron, and Hermione hadn’t eaten dinner together in quite a while, so this was a luxury that he had sorely missed.
“Wow. I didn’t realize how new the shop is. Well, seems you’ve done pretty well for yourself,” Draco said.
“That’s quite alright, Potter,” Draco said curtly, not taking his eyes off of his knitting.
wanted to be there, the retreat organizer, Oswald McWeenie, continued to lead the pack with a nauseating level of enthusiasm as they trekked towards their campsite.
Draco shrugged. “I’m not particularly interested in ruining perfectly nice clothing for a game of Quidditch. This is just what I wear when I garden with my mother.”
By the time Draco had reached the end of his sentence, fits of giggles were escaping from his mouth, and his cheeks were a bright red. Looking at him, Harry wished he could freeze the moment in time, capturing it with a thousand photographs. There was a light to Draco’s eyes that he’d found comfort in, and seeing it now gave him a similar feeling to that of coming home after a long day.
“ … Harry?”
Harry nodded. “Ready.”
“Well …” Ron said, rosiness blooming across his freckled cheeks.
Malfoy nodded as he got up from the bed and began to put his clothes back on. “Come to the Manor on Sunday. Meet my mother. Eat dinner with us.”
“No, Potter,” Draco snapped. “I’m fine.”
Teddy turned to Harry, a slight frown on his face. “Granny said we’re going to see some family that I’ve never met before.”
After a moment of contemplation, Stockinette glared at him before swiftly heading towards the kitchen without a second glance. Harry let out a huff of amused laughter as he gathered his knitting bag and walked into the fireplace, disappearing in a bright burst of green flames.
that my best friend is in desperate need of a push. You know you won’t go to Potter on your own.”
“So,” he began. “What’ve you been up to since the war?”
“To be able to knit so
By the time they got back to Harry’s flat, they were both drenched in clammy sweat. As Harry leaned his broom against the wall of his living room, he let out an exhausted yawn.
As everyone took a seat ― some on the couch and others on the surrounding chairs ― Narcissa wandered out through the door that led to the dining room. There was a brightness in her eyes that, Harry realized, he’d never seen before, and there was a wide smile spreading across her thin face.
“Great. Now these,” Hermione said, picking up the two wooden sticks, “are called knitting needles. I’m sure you’ve seen Molly use them before. Knitting needles also come in different sizes, which are measured in millimeters. The needles are what you knit with, so don’t lose them.”
“How do you know that I’m different, Potter?” Draco spat. “You know nothing about me.”
Teddy pulled back, grinning. “I’ve got my Sirius jumper on, though!”
“What do you mean?”
Andromeda turned around, greeting Harry with a sad smile as tears leaked down her face. “Hi, Harry. As you can see, we’re running a little behind.”
“Brilliant,” Harry said, nodding as he wandered over to the wide window. “You lead the way, then.”
Oh! And a little surprise for anyone who's interested in knitting: the hat that Harry is going to knit Draco for Christmas will be coming to life! I’m designing it, and my wife Emma will be making it and then publishing the pattern on Ravelry at some point in the near-ish future!
Harry looked down, realizing what he was talking about. “Oh! That’s called ribbing, and it’s a technique that’s used for things like necklines, hat brims, and sleeve cuffs. You know how you’re making your scarf using the basic knit stitch?”
He truly was a horrible knitter.
, Pansy,” Draco ground out. “I can’t just walk into his house and expect a shag because I’m feeling lucky. And Merlin’s tits—” He glanced down at his watch, which read ten minutes to nine. “—I have to be there in ten minutes.”
Harry took a seat on the bed next to him. He smelled like berries and beach air, and it took all of Draco to not inhale deeply. Sometimes, when they were back in London living their own lives, he would try to recall the smell of Harry, but it would never come. These moments were far too short.
Harry had never been to this particular café, although it seemed relatively pleasant as he stepped inside, the warm smell of freshly baked rolls and sweet coffee filling his lungs. He scanned the crowd, searching for a particular glint of light blond hair.
“You’re on.”
They’d managed to make it to camp in decent time, arriving in the early afternoon. It was located in a clearing surrounded by trees, and in the middle of it sat a fire pit with log seats that formed a circle. The tents were located on the outskirts of camp. Harry and Hermione shared a tent on the south side and, after putting down their bags, promptly settled in for a power nap that would hopefully go unnoticed by McWeenie.
Draco looked up, blinking steadily before he offered Harry a soft smile. “Don’t worry. We can go slow.”
He and Malfoy picked a vacant space near where the cluster of tents began. As Harry watched the other groups begin their exercise, he coolly folded his arms over his chest and said, “Right, well. I don’t want to do this with you.”
Now, he was doing better than he had ever dreamed of; he not only owned his own yarn shop in Diagon Alley, but he also lived in a flat directly above it. In the year since he had opened the Whomping Willow Woolery, he had been more content than he could ever remember.
Harry wandered back into the kitchen just as his two pieces of toast popped. Grabbing a stick of butter and a pot of raspberry jam from the fridge, he went about dressing the toast appropriately. Several minutes later, he returned to the living room with two plates and took a seat next to Draco on the couch.
“You okay?” he asked.
Harry moved further up the bed, towards the pillows, beckoning for Draco to follow. So he did, settling in beside him as their mouths met again. This time it was rougher, their kisses just a little more desperate as Draco’s fingers ghosted up and down Harry’s spine. He could feel that he was becoming hard, his erection starting to strain against the zipper of his jean shorts. Harry wasn’t too far off, either, his hips pushing forward in search of friction.
He didn’t want to take things slow.
They queued up in the far left line, which was the shortest by far, and managed to board the ferry at 9:20. Harry led Draco up the stairs and onto the second level, where they looked around for seating.
“Do you know about the Christmas craft fair happening tomorrow night?” Harry asked.
Harry let out a soft laugh. “I know, Teddy. It’ll make more sense when you’re older. Now, come on. Let’s go see where Granny’s at. I think it’d be a good idea if you said sorry to her.”
. Small blue numbers appeared in the air, reading 7:05. With a great sigh, Harry flopped onto his back.
With a sigh, Harry stood up, and Draco followed.
“See how it’s soft, but it’s still a little scratchy? That’s a characteristic of wool. There’s a few different fibers that people knit with. For example, mohair is a type of fiber that comes from an Angora goat, and it’s known for being exceptionally plush. People often integrate mohair with whatever wool they’re using to make it softer. Then there’s alpaca, silk, and cotton. Does everything make sense so far?” Hermione asked.
Harry paused when he reached Malfoy’s quarters, which were located next to the Potions classroom. He raised his fist, about to knock, when the door opened. Standing in front of him was Malfoy, who looked just as sleek as he always did. His ashy blond hair was combed back neatly, although not with mountains of gel, and his pale cheeks had a pink tinge to them, as though he’d been exerting himself—packing, most likely. And, as much as Harry restrained himself from doing so, he couldn’t help but let his eyes wander over Malfoy, who was dressed in an olive-colored jumper and black trousers that fit him alarmingly well.
It wasn’t until Draco’s lungs recovered a bit that he turned to Potter and spoke. “I think we should go with a cream color for your master bathroom since it has so much natural light. We’ll get you a lovely clawfoot tub, these gorgeous tiles that I’ve been dying to use, and a walnut double-vanity to match the buffet out here and your bed frame.”
Except, he couldn’t. Ever since Potter had hired him, he’d been trying to muster up the courage to talk to Potter—to ask him out—but that clearly hadn’t turned out well.
After a moment, Malfoy gingerly pulled out of him before rolling off to his left. Their thighs were touching, and the heat radiating from Malfoy’s skin was welcoming against the frigid air. A heavy silence fell between them.
Grabbing the remote from its place on the coffee table, Harry leaned back into the couch and turned on the telly. As he flicked absently through the channels, he couldn’t help but feel disappointed that the Whomping Willow Woolery was closed, given that it was a Friday.
“What are you getting?” he asked.
that bloody big of a building. Don’t you think there’s a reason he chose you to redecorate his
“It’s fine. Really,” Draco said, letting out a huff of dry laughter. “I’m not bothered.”
“Andy,” Harry said, causing her to jump slightly, “Teddy has something he’d like to say to you.”
“There,” Draco said, pointing to a table next to a window on the left hand side of the ferry.
“Until you get the hang of things and feel comfortable on your own,” Harry said, pausing to lean down and pet Stockinette, who was sprawled across the ground. “There’s no rush, though. I mean,
Harry looked to where Draco was standing and grinned, wandering over. “Where do you want to start?”
. Please, just let me teach you how to do it. Then, after a few goes, you can decide whether you like it or not. If you hate it, I won’t push you.”
There, he set Stockinette on the counter and then dug a piece of parchment, an ink pot, and a quill out from one of the drawers.
“Potter—”
“ … Which is?” Harry asked.
were the one who offered
“Of course, Harry.
“Well, their names are Draco and Narcissa Malfoy. Narcissa is Granny’s sister, and Draco is her son. Granny hasn’t seen either of them in a very long time, so tonight’s very special,” Harry said gently.
Harry snorted. “Don’t worry,
After they ordered, Amelia having been nothing but pleasant towards a disguised Draco, they received their drinks and then headed back into the numbing afternoon. Harry wrapped his shawl tighter around his exposed neck, desperate for some semblance of warmth. Luckily, the hot chocolate was charmed to remain at the perfect temperature, warming his insides without being too hot.
“Yes!” Hermione said, her eyes lighting up at the mention of work. “I’m Head of the Muggle Liaison Department, and it’s absolutely incredible. I’m at the forefront of making magic folk more comfortable with Muggles and their ways of life, which is beyond valuable. In fact, we’ve had a severe drop in crimes against Muggles in the last three years ―”
“Makes sense,” Draco said softly.
Once everyone had gone around and introduced themselves, Harry began the lengthy process of explaining the various supplies that went into knitting, trying to channel the patience that Hermione had shown him all those years ago. And, as soon as all questions had been answered, Harry had the students each take a skein of cheap, bulky yarn and a pair of 5.0 mm needles. Draco was the last one to reach for his supplies, grabbing an obnoxiously bright orange ball with a grimace. Harry held in a snicker.
Potter shrugged. “Why not?”
He watched as Draco’s face lit up, and his smile reached his eyes.
As his stag disappeared through the wall, Harry opened Ginny’s door and made his way downstairs. Pale, pre-dawn light fell through the windows that lined the stairwell, and Harry could make out the soft shapes of snow falling against the pewter colored sky.
“Like what?”
. Listen, they’re the only family you’ve got left. Aren’t they worth it?”
“They’re …
After taking one last look at the flower between his fingers, Harry chucked it into the stream, watching it drift off as he desperately wished for this weekend to be over. He wondered if he could somehow rope Hermione into helping him feign ill, although that would involve disclosing his reason for needing to leave early, and he wasn’t quite sure if he was ready for another significant hit of embarrassment in such a short amount of time.
Ron also took a seat, pulling a chair next to where Hermione was sitting and taking her hand in his. Harry swallowed thickly, willing the tension in the room to disperse, even if only a little. He had gone into this knowing it would take some time for the three of them to get comfortable with each other, but now that they were actually in the process, Harry desperately wished they could skip this awkward beginning.
“Yeah, everything’s fine,” Harry said. “I, well … I’ve got a question.”
He turned off the car before opening his door and sliding out. With a sigh, Draco reluctantly followed. Once they were both outside, Harry made a show of easing himself onto the car’s roof; legs dangling over the side as he faced the field.
And he was ready for it all.
“Brings back memories,” Draco murmured, walking to the edge of the frosty shore.
is a pretty popular brand, so I have to collect inventory from them relatively often. I usually have it sent to the shop, but Laoise invited me to see their new merino sheep. I’ve never been, so it’ll be interesting to see what the farm looks like,” Harry said.
“Good.”
“Stockinette!” Harry hollered.
Harry closed the shop up at 3:30 before heading up to his flat with Ron and Hermione. The late afternoon was misty and cold, silver shadows falling over the city of London. From Harry’s living room window, he could see wixens milling about Diagon Alley, many of them heading in the direction of Fortescue’s. He didn’t blame them ― the cold seeping through the walls of his flat was nearly enough to send him off in search of a steaming mug of hot chocolate, but he consoled himself by saying that he would have plenty of opportunities to get something warm to drink at the craft fair.
“Oh!” Andromeda said, clasping her hands together in excitement. “Tell me all about him, then! Is he your age? What does he look like?"
,” Oisín said.
Andromeda snorted. “I see your point.”
“I’d like that,” Draco said, pressing a kiss to his temple. “Come on, follow me.”
Teddy pointed to a heap on the ground, which Harry quickly recognized as a stiff collared shirt. He didn’t blame Teddy for not wanting to wear it, although he could also understand why Andromeda wanted Teddy to look particularly nice. It was a big night, after all.
Draco nodded. “I think so. You’ve got the Portkey?”
Once Stockinette had been picked up and Harry had stuffed his wallet and keys into the back pocket of his jeans, they stepped into the fireplace and disappeared in a puff of green flames.
Harry let out a light laugh. “Yeah, I suppose you could say that. Hey, what about your love life? Weren’t you and Parkinson a thing back in school?”
“So,” Harry said, pulling out an autobiographical recounting of time travel, “what are your Christmases like?”
“I’m fond of that one,” Draco said, pointing to a cauldron that had a large dragon painted on the outside.
Draco reached out, fisting the collar of Harry’s robes in his hands and pulling him close. “You don’t know how long I’ve wanted to hear you ask me that.”
“As you can imagine, things are pretty different now. It’s just Mother and myself, so things are relatively quiet. I’ll help her cook, and then we’ll spend the evening playing chess. It’s simple enough, but I enjoy it nonetheless.
After a moment, Potter cleared his throat. “So … what’ve you been up to?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, letting out a light laugh, “he was a handful, especially at eleven. Merlin, he used to be so glued to his prejudices.”
“Potter, we’ve barely begun to get to know each other again. Why is it that you so desperately want for me to get along with them?” Draco asked.
“Hey,” Harry said softly, briefly touching Draco’s hand to get his attention. “Do you need some help?”
And so he did, his orgasm rippling through him. Once he was spent, he gingerly pulled out and collapsed beside Harry, who was still noticeably hard. He spat into the palm of his hand before wrapping it around Harry’s cock and working the length of it. Harry’s eyes fluttered closed, and it wasn’t long before he came, pearly ribbons shooting onto his stomach.
Harry nodded.
Two years later, and still nothing.
“I lived in France when I was younger, so I went to Beauxbatons. Laoise is a Squib, so she was homeschooled,” Oisín said.
Wordlessly, Draco stepped inside. For a moment, he let himself admire the entryway that bled into the living room, which he’d finished a few days ago. The walls were plastered in a cream wallpaper with thin, golden geometric shapes, and while it was certainly beautiful, the deliciously bright turquoise velvet sofa that sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by two matching chairs, was the real showrunner. Across from the sofa was a walnut buffet table, and perched on top of it was a chunky Muggle television, which Draco had hated from day one.
Harry let his eyes flutter shut, reveling in the building heat in his abdomen and the sharp tendrils of pleasure that seemed to shoot from his core outward whenever Malfoy pressed up against his prostate. His cock ached horribly, desperate for attention—which he’d resisted giving it since Malfoy had begun stretching him with his fingers. Slowly, he let his hand snake down his torso, wrapping it around his length and pumping it. He quickened his pace, timing it with Malfoy’s thrusts. He could feel his bollocks drawing close to his body, his muscles tensing, and then he came, shooting spurts of liquid onto his stomach until he was wrung dry. Still, sparks of pleasure were bursting within him as Malfoy continued to fuck him hard and fast.
As Harry resumed his fiddling with one of the paper snowflakes that Hermione had cut out for him, it swiftly levitated out of his grasp, the end of its twine attaching itself to the ceiling so that it neatly dangled. Startled, Harry looked down only to see Draco smirking at him, wand in the air.
Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Huh. That’s … not what I’d expected.”
“Merlin, I hope so,” Oisín said, gesturing for them to follow. “This way. Your boxes are in our office.”
Harry snorted.
five times. Do you want to take over stirring?”
wasn’t that bad when he first started off.
“What the bloody hell is that supposed to mean?” Harry asked, laughter escaping his lips.
Their lips met, and Draco tasted like home.
“Right. Well,
Just as Harry was about to head towards the room to the right, which appeared to be the dining room, he heard footsteps approaching against the walnut floors. His head snapping up, Harry saw Draco wandering towards him with an easy smile on his face.
“Look, Malfoy —” Harry began, but he was abruptly cut off.
Harry shrugged. “Same with you. How long have you been out?”
“While I’m in you,” Draco said, pulling all three fingers out, “I want you to touch yourself.”
As soon as Andromeda had slung her handbag full of coloring books, crayons, and odd dolls, the three of them wandered towards the fireplace. Harry hung back, expecting Andromeda and Teddy to go first, but Andromeda simply stared.
“Sorry. Lost in thought,” he said, picking up his fork and absently stabbing at his salad.
As Hermione and Ron bickered about their new appliance, Harry searched the crowd for any sign of Draco. Realizing that the sea of people was far too thick, he sighed and turned to his own purchases. He’d been successful in buying presents for nearly everyone on his list, which was a great relief. He’d spent far too many Christmas Eves in years past scrambling to Diagon Alley after realizing that he’d waited to buy presents until quite literally the last second.
“Hey, you’re a different person now,” he said quietly.
He paused, however, when Potter raised his right hand and waved at him, the unmarked skin of his inner wrist exposed. “See you later, Malfoy.”
Harry let out a heavy sigh at McWeenie’s words. There were times when he wondered if he’d stood a chance with Malfoy, had they not hated each other in school, but doubt often overshadowed these thoughts.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Piss off.”
“Well,” Malfoy said, his voice weary, “I didn’t exactly have a choice, did I? With the wizarding world casting me into exile, and all.”
This is the second to last update! I'm absolutely dreading Wednesday, but I'm also super excited for you all to read the ending! Thank you so much for continuing on this fluffy journey with me <3
about Malfoy. He wanted sappy date nights, stealing kisses in broom closets in between classes as though they were horny teenagers, and getting into bed together for a purpose besides fucking. He wanted a
Malfoy choked on his sandwich. “What do you mean? What about the girl Weasley?”
“Can I put my cock inside you?” Harry asked bluntly.
“Janice Taylor, Magical Law Enforcement,” she replied. “I’m rather new in the DMLE. Sorry to meet this way, and for disturbing you so late. We needed to reach you immediately.”
Harry felt his face go pale. Malfoy was here? One of the Healers stepped out of the group and Harry found himself face to face with Malfoy’s equally-stricken face. Harry swallowed, trying to keep his feelings off his face, mirroring Malfoy as the other man also carefully wiped his face of emotion. Malfoy nodded at his boss, and while Harry wanted to request that someone else do his exam, he didn’t want to lose face in front of the whole group, Malfoy included. The other Healers set out on their assigned tasks, and Janice accompanied them.
“As you know, you recently returned from a mission for the Aurors in Northern Ireland,” Janice said. “Unfortunately, after your departure, the Aurors left in Warrenpoint discovered that the smugglers were not only transporting baneberry for its use in potions,” she continued.
Harry sighed. Why couldn’t anything in his life go according to plan? “Alright,” he said, trying to hide his annoyance. “Inspect anything you like.”
This was going rather better than Harry’d expected. He and Malfoy were nearing the end of their fourth day of quarantine. They’d mostly spent the time watching films and eating takeaway Janice brought over, but they’d had quite a few civil conversations in between. They’d talked about their respective careers and their friends. Harry introduced Malfoy to more Muggle technology. After a few drinks, Malfoy had brought up sexuality again, and they’d both admitted their relative lack of experience with men. Harry had never gone further than kissing with a man, and Malfoy was only slightly more experienced. The conversation had made Harry unbearably hard, which was frankly ridiculous, because it was only a discussion about kissing, but to be honest, Malfoy’s mere presence was driving Harry’s libido through the roof.
“Yes,” Harry managed to rasp in response. “Sorry, I…” He trailed off. “This is just so weird.”
“Do they need me to go back out?” Harry asked, internally pleading that the Northern Irish Aurors could handle the new development themselves. It had been weeks since he’d had a proper break and he was exhausted.
“I… I’m sorry,” Harry said, out of breath suddenly.
Harry sighed and looked around his flat. 12 Grimmauld place was a bit dusty—he’d been away for a few weeks, after all—but nothing was out of place. It always felt wonderful to come home. He headed to the kitchen to make a cup of tea before bed. Harry had just returned from a case in Northern Ireland dealing with some plant smugglers and was looking forward to a quiet e evening. Of course, Northern Ireland had their own Aurors, but they often called in English Aurors for tricky cases. Apparently Warrenpoint was a hub of baneberry trading; its position on the coast made sending and receiving shipments easy.
“May we come in?” Janice asked. “I’ll explain everything shortly.”
Draco leaned forward to kiss Harry, tangling their tongues once more. Harry lifted Draco before slowly pushing back in, keeping the pace slow. He knew Draco’d never done this before and wanted to be gentle. Draco had other ideas. The next time Harry pulled out, Draco slammed back down on his cock.
“Er, you know I’ve never,” he began awkwardly before Draco interrupted gently.
“All right in there?” Janice called.
“Still want to?” Harry asked.
“Your arse is fantastic,” Harry nearly growled.
“Leave us to what?” Harry asked, getting quite tired of not understanding what the bloody hell was going on.
The two men watched the next few minutes of the film in silence. Or rather, Harry thought Malfoy watched the film while Harry tried to suppress his growing panic and growing erection. He hadn’t been this nervous or this easily aroused since he was about fifteen, but for some reason, Malfoy made him feel like a horny teenager again.
“Please,” he whispered against Harry’s mouth.
Sensing his discomfort, Malfoy paused. “Relax, Potter. I’m a professional. I see this every day.”
“God, of course,” Harry said. “You’re welcome to anything, anytime.”
Draco huffed. “Merlin, Harry. You’re so oblivious sometimes.”
Once he was fully sheathed inside Draco, Harry grabbed Draco’s hips, keeping him from moving. “God, you look gorgeous like this. Don’t move,” Harry said. “I don’t want to come too soon.”
“Did you know this was going to happen?” Harry demanded, rounding on Malfoy.
“No, rather the opposite, actually,” Janice responded. What the hell does that mean? Harry wondered before Janice continued. “Apparently, this particular baneberry crop had been specially bred to have not only its usual effects in potions, but also to carry a magical disease. While the smugglers were handling the shipments with masks and gloves to prevent transmission, the Aurors who intercepted the shipment, yourself included, took no such precautions, imagining the plants to be ordinary. This team of Healers is from the DMLE/Healer Task Force for the Containment of Magical Maladies and is here to inspect you and your belongings, making sure no trace of the disease is found.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s hips, fucking him hard and fast. Draco was still moaning and keening, and it wasn’t long before Harry was coming in Draco’s arse with a groan.
“You’re just desperate for it, aren’t you?” Harry could tell Draco loved it when he talked like this.
Draco’s eyes darkened with lust. “God, fuck, yes. Merlin, Harry, are you trying to kill me?”
Harry drew back, his bravery gone for the time being. “Okay!” He said faux-brightly, trying to dispel the awkwardness. “Let’s go watch our film.”
“I’m bisexual. Into both.” Harry still felt a little odd saying it. Malfoy looked as if he was putting a puzzle together in his head.
Harry snorted. “You hardly have to ask,” he said. “It’s all we’ve done for four days.” He cleared away the leftover Chinese that sitting on the table.
“It’s not like it’s a secret, Potter. It’s not a bad thing.”
Malfoy looked taken aback. “What?”
“Hence the protective charms, Potter,” Malfoy scoffed. “Really. One would think you play dumb on purpose.”
“Y-yes, Malfoy?” He choked out.
Coming out of his focus on Malfoy’s blush, Harry cleared his throat. “Well, are we doing this?” He asked, then cringed at how awkwardly sexual it sounded. “I mean, you can start whenever you’re ready,” he corrected himself. If possible, he was blushing even harder than before. God, couldn’t it have been anyone besides Malfoy? Not that he’d particularly love a mostly-naked examination with anyone, but ever since their eighth year at Hogwarts, he and Malfoy had been so awkward around each other. It was like they didn’t know how to act without fighting. Of course, Harry also had other reasons to be awkward. But Malfoy didn’t need to know that.
“Mhmm.” Harry cut off his own answer, capturing Draco in another kiss. The feeling of their naked bodies moving together was incredibly intense, almost overwhelmingly intimate. Harry ran his hands all over Draco’s heated flesh, tugging on his hair before caressing his back and moving down to cup his arse.
Draco’s every word got Harry hotter and hotter, desperate to be inside Draco for real despite his nerves that he might fuck up his first sexual experience with a man. He added a second finger, and then a third, searching for Draco’s prostrate. He knew when he found it; Draco let out a moan so loud the neighbors would have heard if Grimmauld Place didn’t have silencing and privacy charms surrounding it.
“Turn around,” Malfoy ordered. It came out louder than Harry’d been expecting, and he jumped before turning around reluctantly. Malfoy, still on his knees, let out a strangled gasp, so tiny Harry could almost convince himself he’d imagined it. Was it possible that Malfoy was attracted to him? No, there was no way. Harry didn’t even know if Malfoy liked blokes, and Malfoy certainly didn’t know Harry did. Lost in his hope—idle curiosity, Harry corrected himself—Harry hadn’t noticed that Malfoy had again leaned in to finish the inspection, starting his ankles.
“Seduce you, maybe.” Harry answered, once again muttering the lubrication charm and slicking up his prick.
“Of course,” Draco answered. “You?”
Draco pulled back, a confused expression on his face. “Yes?”
The room fell into silence. “Well, that’s sorted,” Janice said.
Harry led the way over to the couch and turned on the TV. His crush on Malfoy—which he was fully admitting to now, after denying it to his friends and himself for years—was getting out of control. The most confusing part was that he thought Malfoy might like him, too. But Malfoy’s feelings were really a moot point; despite Harry’s Gryffindor bravery, he’d never, ever make a move on Malfoy. The humiliation was too much to risk.
, I am not seeking your advice as a man of distinguished aesthetic tastes. I want to know if you like it. If, maybe… that is, if you’d perhaps like to live there. With me.”
The next morning, Harry wakes up in Malfoy’s bed, erect and alert. All night, he’d dreamt about their plans. God, he can’t wait. He kisses the back of Malfoy’s neck and shoulders until he wakes up, and then they lazily wank each other off. Harry looks at Malfoy’s mussed hair and sleepy eyes and doesn’t think about the weird feeling in his chest. He thinks, instead, about how Malfoy is so pliable, so willing to give Harry what he wants, but that only makes the weird feeling grow, so he closes his eyes and listens to Malfoy’s breath catch and drag.
Malfoy turns his head to peer at Harry. He looks somewhat astonished to be asked such an inane question about his day, and Harry can hardly blame him.
, to sully if not to keep.
“Fucking perfect,” Harry remarks, laying a light smack on one cheek. Malfoy jumps tellingly, and Harry quite looks forward to exploring that further at a later date, but right now he needs to be closer. “C’mere.”
Ron is going to kill him.
Malfoy gives them a wide-eyed look, and Harry can’t help but suck in a quiet gasp, but luckily it’s covered by Parkinson’s dramatic sigh.
nothing. Even when I acted like a jealous arse and bailed on you in the middle of the forest during the scariest year of our lives. When you needed me. You had every right to, but you didn’t. Or am I wrong about that?”
The week following their split had seen Hermione looking healthier, freer, and lighter than she’d been in years. Ron, in absolute denial, claimed that she was faking it. Harry couldn’t help but feel torn. He was of course loyal to Ron, but his other best friend hadn’t looked this happy and self-assured since that time in 5
“You’re not sure it’s right to accept Potter’s love and still have the freedom you need to be happy.”
That said, he'd still like to put this particular revelation off for a while, if at all possible.
He’s actually right, for once. After Charms, Hermione drags Harry to the library in search of a rare book she thinks would interest him. There’s hardly anyone in the library at this hour, but Harry doesn’t notice anything amiss, not even when she leads him deeper into the stacks than he’s likely ever been. His mind is entirely on the term project for Charms, and whether Hermione’s about to connect him with the inspiration he’d been seeking.
She turns and gives him a playful glare, but he just smiles back.
Malfoy watches her go for a moment. As soon as she rounds the corner out of sight, he takes her seat. He pointedly sits too close, leans his shoulder against Harry’s, and stares out the window silently.
“I just, I know, okay? He doesn’t-” Harry stumbles, then pushes past his embarrassment. “He doesn’t feel the way I do.”
Malfoy glares back, not deigning to answer.
Pleasure zings through him in response. He’s tense, feeling newly conscious of the numerous scars littering his body. But Hermione doesn’t flinch or hesitate, doesn’t shy away from them, and Harry can feel himself relax a little.
Malfoy, against all odds, had apologized on the spot. He’d actually seemed quite genuine, listing his wrongdoings and offering reparations rather than excuses. After he’d gone on for quite some time, Hermione had interrupted him to say, “I accept your apology, and will accept changed behavior in lieu of reparations.” Since then, Hermione’s seemed more comfortable in the room than either one of them.
Zabini smirks. “It’s all right, Pans. We can understand the desire to cosy up to a war hero in the interest of bolstering one’s reputation, can’t we?”
"Ginny!" Ron finally manages to say, uselessly trying to wipe pumpkin juice from his eyes.
Malfoy closes his ledger, setting it to the side. He stands, tall and sleek, and stretches his arms above his head. Something in Harry desperately wants to pounce. Malfoy walks over, leisurely in his approach, slowly crawling on Harry’s bed to sit between them. When he speaks, his voice is sleek like honey. “There’s hardly any need to be nervous. We’re just going to have some fun, and if we never reach our desired destination, I imagine we’ll still enjoy ourselves quite a bit along the way. Alright by you, Potter?” He lays a hot little kiss on Harry’s mouth without giving him the chance to respond.
They don’t encounter anyone else along the way. Breaking into the Greenhouse is child’s play to someone who’s spent so much time practicing locking and unlocking Charms, and once they’re inside, Harry shoves Malfoy up against a heavy workbench and kisses him hard. He crowds Malfoy in, presses their bodies together, bites his lip. And Malfoy, beautifully, takes it.
“Draco,” she says, mimicking his tone perfectly. She rises to her feet and gives Harry a subtle wink. “See you later tonight, Harry?” Her voice is low and full of promise, which seems to raise Malfoy’s hackles even further.
try to make some headway on his Potions assignment. And though he takes out his books and parchment and quill, he’s still hearing Hermione’s moans in his ear and thinking about all the things they could have gotten up to if she’d allowed it. He imagines tugging off her knickers and has to squirm in his seat a bit. He’d have loved the opportunity to slip his fingers inside her, pumping and caressing until she came on them.
, where the hell had it come from – and asks, “He? Surely you aren’t referring to Ronald.” She sits against the headboard, holding a weathered old tome and seeming only partially interested in the conversation. Because, scorching hot threesomes or not, she’s still Hermione Granger: ever in pursuit of more knowledge. Harry can’t help but smile at her, and she smiles back reflexively.
“That’s sweet, but Hermione is more likely to enjoy having her own space. This room seems perfect,” Harry responds, looking at the photo and ignoring Malfoy’s unsubtle question. He picks up the photo of the master bedroom and gives it due consideration. “Although, this bed is rather large. I imagine she’d come and visit us often enough.”
“Quite alright, Potter,” Malfoy says distantly, and holds the wrinkled parchment out to Harry.
Harry sighs regretfully and climbs off, collapsing next to Malfoy tiredly.
The Slytherins apparently deal in pointed silences and slight expressions of disgust. Harry rolls his eyes a little, but the truth is that he finds them far more amusing than annoying. “If you want to know about Hermione, you’ll have to ask Hermione.” He doesn’t feel great about the idea of discussing her behind her back.
“You, of all people, will survive. You’re big on rising from the proverbial and sometimes literal ashes, are you not?” Ginny wraps an arm around his shoulders. “Totally jealous, by the way. Hermione’s looking particularly fetching these days.”
“Come now, Potter, you’re her best friend. Couldn’t you at least give us a hint?” Pansy seems to be trying not to speak to Harry with open disdain; it is not a very impressive effort.
his cock?”
She and Ron are apparently done with their conversation. Both are eyeing him with concern. He feels a rush of warmth just looking at them.
Harry thinks dizzily, just as Malfoy makes a wounded noise shoots across Harry’s cock and belly. Harry follows him over the edge, bucking up against Malfoy frantically and probably babbling something embarrassingly effusive about how bloody hot he is.
Malfoy, who hasn’t moved since the ghostly fox had first popped through the wall, pushes his fingers deep, almost questioning.
“Yeah,” Harry encourages. And then, just because, he tells Malfoy about how much better his fingers are than Harry’s own. “So good, you’re so good, Malfoy.”
Harry is officially done with his meal. He’s about to get up and head to class early when Hermione grasps his hand.
Harry rubs his morning erection against Malfoy’s hip, nipping at what appears to be a very sensitive patch of skin. Malfoy jerks, yanks Harry all the way on top of him, wraps his long limbs around him. Harry licks, sucks, worries the hot flesh with his mouth while Malfoy moans beneath him. Their cocks bump together and it’s slightly painful and fucking wonderful in turns.
“Well, if Potter’s education is at stake, I suppose we’d all best do what we can to assist.” Malfoy’s voice is facetious, but Harry can hear him turning pages obediently.
“Yes,” Ron blurts without quite meaning to, eyes skittering towards Malfoy and then quickly away. He frowns down at his plate, and Harry just knows he is unwillingly picturing exactly what Hermione has ‘moved on’ to doing.
A low whistle sounds from nearby, and though he knows he’ll regret it, Harry turns to look at Malfoy. “Who knew Granger had it in her?”
, he thinks, resting more of his weight on top of her and letting Draco stroke his prostate with those glorious fingers. Draco pushes his fingers in, curls them expertly, pulls them mostly out. He does this, over and over, seemingly tirelessly, until Harry can feel his cock beginning to rise again.
Harry never should have done it, but even as he lay in his bed admonishing himself for getting into this situation, he remembers. He can very clearly recall how it had felt to have Hermione's impossibly slick and hot pussy spasm around his dick. Honestly, he's not sure how he should feel about the events of last night, but his cock doesn't seem the least bit confused. His first time, beyond a few handies behind a greenhouse or shed, and it was a threesome with his gorgeous best friend and - he might as well admit it - the hottest guy he's ever met.
Mostly, they spend the day lazing about their room. Harry puts the finishing touches on his Transfigurations paper, and Malfoy becomes engrossed in an historical novel. He tries to explain the homoerotic subtext to Harry, but subtexts aren’t really Harry’s forte. Malfoy insists on reading some key scenes to Harry.
“Whoop!” he shouts, arms flailing comically as he goes down. After, Harry lies on the floor mortified and red-faced, thinking about being somewhere very, very far from here.
Malfoy sputters. “I will admit no such thing!”
“Ginny wouldn’t...” he trails off too, as he quickly realizes that Ginny absolutely
Hermione moans, rubs her peaked tits against him, and keeps jerking his cock.
Harry, who has not yet managed to stop touching his cock, squeaks out an embarrassed, “Hermione!”
Harry pushes them all the way off, along with his pants, and then presses the front of his body to Hermione’s, kissing her hot little mouth and running a hand up her thigh. She lifts her leg and hooks it over Harry’s hip, giving him room to get his fingers splendidly wet and bring them up to stroke her clit just the way she likes. Draco’s fingers bump against his, and then he presumably pushes them inside Hermione’s pussy. She starts rolling her hips seductively, tits brushing Harry’s chest as she takes her pleasure from both of them. Harry focuses on her clit, alternating between teasing flicks and rubbing hard circles until she comes between them, bucking deliciously and moaning exuberantly.
When lunch rolls around, Harry has to make a quick stop in the nearest gents’ to relieve a bit of tension. Who knew the library was so full of erotic possibilities? It takes hardly two minutes for him to get off, especially when he discovers that Hermione has somehow managed to slip a pair of damp purple knickers into his trouser pocket without his notice.
Undeterred, Harry talks over him. “Sorry, I just had the most amazing dream, and I really need- that is, I want, if you’re willing…”
Harry is momentarily flummoxed. Aeroplanes flying has always been a fact of Harry’s life, but damned if he can actually
“Yes, well.” Harry’s lost his train of thought entirely, caught by the notion of about being
Neville, much further down the table and in the midst of a discussion with Blaise Zabini, gives Harry little more than a nod of acknowledgment.
“I’m more interested to know how!” She says with a dirty grin, and then her eyes grow wide. “Oooh, Ron must HATE this!!” She’s got that evil little sister glee thing going on.
Malfoy’s reading voice is posh and refined and the perfect soundtrack for a cozy evening by the fire. Harry is hardly even listening to the words themselves, and he suspects Hermione is doing the same. She sends Harry a sweet smile and he smiles back peacefully. Tomorrow she will likely yell at Harry for not finishing his Transfigurations paper, but that’s tomorrow’s concern. Tonight, he gets peace, and Draco’s smooth voice washing over him, telling him things he mostly already knows.
Harry feels a shock go through him at the way she’s talking to Malfoy. He’s even more surprised that Malfoy doesn’t seem offended by it.
Malfoy pauses, takes a sip of his water, and considers Harry’s question. “Potter, how do aeroplanes fly?”
Of course, put that way, Malfoy's seemingly kind silence makes much more sense. It came from pure, unadulterated self-interest. Malfoy wants back into Hermione's knickers, is all. He's probably, even now, thinking only of fucking her again with his fat prick, making her moan and come and...
Malfoy slaps Harry’s hand away from his own dick, and Harry screams at him, a tear slipping from the corner of his eye. The urge to climax slowly recedes while Harry thinks about how very much he despises Draco bloody Malfoy, and then he jumps. Draco bloody Malfoy’s hand is on his cock, stroking it once and then aiming it up-
“Hermione,” he groans, loud and long, seemingly unable to say anything else. He doesn’t do this, doesn’t let himself look at her like this. But it’s impossible to avoid right now, because she knows Harry is turned on, and she’s lying on his bed. Her breathing is uneven, and the points of her nipples are clearly visible through her blouse, bra conspicuously missing. Did Pansy Parkinson remove it? Harry groans again, thinking about Parkinson laying kisses over Hermione’s bare breasts, sucking a dark nipple into her mouth, making Hermione moan…
But now, he’s remembering the way Hermione had shamelessly used Malfoy’s mouth, the way Malfoy had unhesitatingly offered Harry his arse. The way he’d happily surrendered his body for their pleasure.
around, trying to find out what you’re up to! It’s preposterous!” They both laugh at him, and it’s reminding Harry all too much of Ron and Hermione’s insistence that he was obsessed with Malfoy.
Harry smiles and gets back to the task at hand. He tries to suck a bit more into his mouth, but promptly gags. Draco gasps above him. Okay, that was too much. Harry pulls back, gives most of his attentions to the head of Draco’s prick, stroking the rest with his hand. Draco’s so hot and so thick, and Harry bobs his head slowly, using as much tongue as he can.
“…Hogwarts?”
Harry takes a long time spreading him open with wet fingers, fingering him happily until Draco begs for his cock. Then, graciously, gives it to him. Mostly, only Draco’s arse is on Harry’s jumper. The truth is that Harry lays Draco Malfoy in the dirt and fucks him slow and hard in the dim quiet of the Greenhouse. Draco pants and cries out, but mostly, looks up at Harry with a questioning, confused look.
Unfortunately, he is waylaid in the Common Room by Ron. Harry takes a good look at the frustration, worry, and guilt on his best mate's face and says a bitter goodbye to his plan of furiously masturbating for the next 90 minutes.
“Well!” Hermione says breathily from Harry’s bed.
Draco holds her hips steady, and, most amazingly, Harry can feel it when he pushes the head of his cock into Hermione. He only nudges it inside, just a bit, and stops. He kisses Hermione’s shoulder, again and again, and Harry follows his lead.
When Harry looks back at Hermione, her blouse is buttoned up and her skirt pulled down, and she’s adjusting her over the knee socks. She looks up at him and smiles brightly. “Thanks for being such a good friend, Harry.” She kisses his cheek and then crawls out of his bed.
” Both Harry and Hermione chime in emphatically. Harry would quite like to do that, right now.
Harry trails behind, musing over his newfound ability to fluster Malfoy with a single look.
Aaaand that’s it! Unless y’all are hungry for an epilogue, that is. Thank you for joining me on this ride. You all have been so very kind to me. fandom has given me so much over the past 17 years, and I mostly just wanted to give a little something back. Much love. <3
Harry hums skeptically. It’s unlike Malfoy to give Harry the benefit of the doubt, but Harry can admit that he doesn’t really deserve it in this instance. “I got bamboozled by a giant snake hiding in a reeking corpse.
It takes a second for his brain to catch on, and another second for him to break off their kiss and remove his hands, but he manages to let her know someone is coming in time for her to walk further up the aisle and pretend to be browsing the shelves. Luckily, the 6th year Hufflepuff who strolls by catches only a glimpse of a flushed Harry Potter standing around with fists stuffed in his trouser pockets before she smirks and moves on.
“Well, what is she looking for? One hopes she doesn’t exclusively deal in gingers,” Zabini intones with a delicate shudder.
to touch her. He inches closer and runs his fingers through her hair, down her neck and her shoulders. Malfoy has given up on staying quiet, and is moaning and clutching Hermione’s squirming hips for dear life. Harry reaches around and holds both her breasts in his hands, squeezing briefly. When he plays with her nipples, she gets even louder.
Ron goes back to shoveling food into his mouth, and Hermione squeezes Harry’s hand.
Draco shushes him, and Hermione kisses his face and strokes fingers through his hair. “Relax, Harry,” she whispers to him. “It’s so good when you do.”
“I still need you,” Draco says, chest still heaving.
knows that Malfoy isn’t a morning person.
“That much is readily apparent,” Malfoy remarks drily, though hardly snide at all.
Harry rears back in surprise. He hasn’t used his bed at all, since that first night he’d slept in Draco’s bed. He’d not even thought about it, really. He looks to Draco nervously, but he’s already settling into bed, leaving a distinctly Harry-sized space open.
Brilliant. She’s utterly brilliant.
“Yes, quite,” Malfoy agrees, scratching Harry’s scalp gently and making him groan. “This is a perfectly adequate list, Potter. I’d be happy to lend a hand.”
“Privacy Charms,” Hermione gasps, rolling up towards Malfoy’s mouth enthusiastically.
Ginny waggles her eyebrows at him. “Is it Hermione?”
He tries to tell him, but what comes out is, “Draco, you’re so- it feels so- you’re so
Malfoy huffs against Harry’s collarbone, clearly amused by the idea that Harry knows a spell that Hermione does not. Harry shivers involuntarily.
It’s a brilliant idea, and Harry feels a thrill go through him at the thought. He takes out a fresh sheet of parchment and eagerly dips his quill. He pens the number one, and then stops, red-faced.
It’s not as though Harry actually believes he can keep this from Ron for long; though he may be given to moments of extraordinary dickishness and the occasional bout of ghosting, Ron
thing you can do is be yourself.”
Maybe not forever, he acknowledges silently as Draco crawls up to collapse next to Harry. But he’s pretty stubborn. He won’t be letting this go without a fight. He smiles tiredly at Draco, runs a hand through his messy blonde hair, kisses his wet, delectable lips. Once he’s licked up every taste of Hermione, he looks to see Hermione on her hands and knees, digging around the bed, presumably in search of her knickers. Harry knows the polite thing would be to help, but he catches a glimpse of her glistening pussy under her skirt and has to touch it. Her hips wriggle in delight at the firm stroke he gives her.
“You know, Harry,” Hermione says thoughtfully some time later. Harry, who has been aimlessly staring into the distance, looks to her warily. Subtle cues are not Harry’s specialty, but even he can sense a reproach coming. “For someone who has been improving noticeably in classes, you don’t appear to spend much time actually studying.”
It’s not that Harry want to do what Malfoy says, just that he thinks he’d probably be more comfortable in less clothing. It takes a while for him to get undressed, distracted as he is by Draco Malfoy giving his best friend a proper fucking right there in Harry’s bed, but eventually he manages. Hermione’s moans are near constant now, her tits bouncing enticingly with every thrust. She wraps her legs around Malfoy, who appears to be biting his lips in an effort to stay quiet, and reaches out for Harry.
Mill, Pansy, and Blaise all scoff simultaneously.
“Exactly who have you taken to the Greenhouses, Malfoy?”
“That’s not very nice,” Hermione comments, avidly watching the movements of Malfoy’s hand. “That’s quite enough teasing, don’t you think, Harry?”
Hermione rolls her hips, wriggling on Harry’s prick with purpose.
Harry kicks off his shoes and gathers his notes close to him. This is likely for the best, though he’d had something much more fun in mind.
“No need,” he asserts, thrilled to brag just a bit. “I’m not much of a reconnaissance man, myself. Usually just like to dive in and figure it out as I go along.”
When he turns to check on her, the sopophorous beans almost go flying across the room all over again. Hermione has discarded her school robes entirely, and she sits in her seat, back to her workstation, head thrown back in pleasure. For a long moment, Harry is caught by the picture she makes: white shirt unbuttoned, pert tits out of the cups of her Gryffindor red bra, her uniform skirt seeming rather a bit shorter than usual. Her back is arched, and she lets out a clear, sweet moan, and that’s when Harry finally fully takes in the scene before him. Draco Malfoy is kneeling on the stone floor, face buried between Hermione’s thighs, long pale hands wrapped around her squirming hips.
her: clenching spasmodically around him, moans turning into an actual scream, her body shaking all over, and that’s it for Harry. He snaps his hips up once more, shooting his release inside Hermione… who was already full of Draco Malfoy’s come, holy God. His cock jerks again and again and he wonders if he’ll
Malfoy snorts loudly, but says nothing.
“Yes,” Malfoy acknowledges belatedly. “I usually was.” He’s still staring at Harry’s floating head.
“Totally,” Harry agrees with a humourless laugh, holding her close. He considers remarking that it’s a bit early to call it, but discards the idea.
“Yes, Granger?” Malfoy responds, loosening and removing his Slytherin tie.
Harry and Malfoy rise and dress as usual, silent as they walk down to the Great Hall. When they reach the Eighth Year Table, though, Harry stops well before they reach their usual seats.
Blaise, still leaning against the wall and not even attempting to disguise the telling bulge in his trousers, raises his hand. Other hands go up around the room, including two Slytherin 7
Seriously, what had he been
Malfoy looks up at Harry, searches for something in his eyes. Not sure what he’s looking for, Harry just looks back and hopes to Merlin that Malfoy isn’t about to roll out of this bed in disgust. Malfoy gulps nervously, cheeks flushed, and then leans down to kiss the center of the scar. The actual physical sensation is dulled, distant, but Harry hears himself gasp anyway. Malfoy closes his eyes and stays just where he is, lingering, laying kiss after kiss over the scar.
Just like she is right now. Oh, sweet Merlin, her hand has disappeared under her skirt and a couple more buttons of her top are undone. Her arm moves subtly, and although he can’t see from this angle, he’s certain she’s rubbing her clit through her knickers. She moans again, hips jerking, and Harry
Hermione, though, looks at Parkinson and gives her the dirtiest smirk Harry’s ever seen. Parkinson, incredibly, blushes a bright pink and hops out of her seat. She turns and struts toward her room, shooting Malfoy a look of wide-eyed incredulity as Hermione follows her. Once they’re gone and Parkinson’s door has slammed shut behind them, the entire common room bursts into chatter about the scene.
Parkinson approaches just then. She looks perfectly put together, but she doesn’t seem to notice Harry and Malfoy’s presence until well after she’s taken her seat. “Mill,” she says, voice devoid of any tone at all.
Pulled from thought, Draco looked down at his arm, currently covered by the long sleeve of his white button down shirt. His shirts always covered his arms now, but they couldn't conceal the shame he felt beneath the cloth.
There was the person he'd been obsessed with since the moment he met him six years ago, only a bit taller... still twistedly...darkly handsome...and yet, looking broken all at once.
Draco could see that familiar fire in them and he felt a flighty feeling in his chest that brought on the sensation of warmth again...sweet sun-lit warmth.
"You should have done it."
With another huff of breath and a bit of blind faith, Harry called out decibels lower.
Draco pondered with a furrowed brow.
Draco's grey eyes fluttered to once again meet the fire in Harry's emeralds.
death eater who volunteered his only son to
The surprise of a cool sensation of skin on skin struck Draco's forehead. A hand grabbing the back of Draco's head, tangling fingers into his hair.
Shards of porcelain struck by spells had littered the floor and he felt blood trickle from his forehead as well as the torn cloth on his left knee, jagged fragments from the demolished sinks and tile as the culprit.
He wondered silently as he leapt out of the way of the hex, tumbling to the floor, giving his elbow a rather jarring bounce on the hard tile.
daft, he could almost feel that Malfoy felt the same too.
"Yeah?" Draco found strength in his voice again. "How do you reckon that?"
That was also before Malfoy Manor, now a stark contrast from those sun-bathed days, was shrouded in darkness as death eaters gathered chanting their adoration for hexes and unforgivable curses.
Draco sprinted through the doors of the Great Hall, making a clumsy exit.
Who was this person?
it was a mute whisper only Draco could hear.
The Manor was even better when his father wasn't home. That was when the family, servants, even the bloody house elves felt at peace. In those scarce moments of peace, he never hesitated to extend an invitation to Blaise, Pansy, and those simpletons Crabbe and Goyle. During the effortless summers of first and second year they would roam the grounds eating stashes of candy hidden in cupboards from previous Honeydukes rounds, play Qudditch on the massive lawn, just being normal kids...whatever normal was for a pack of haughty Slytherins.
A handful of redeeming moments didn't make up for the fact that Dra-
When he didn't feel resistance, Harry summoned that Gryffindor courage and allowed his arms to wrap around Draco, engulfing him in a warm embrace, chin over Draco's shoulder while his hand rubbed light circles on his back.
. A pure-blood death eater. There was no other explanation for this person...this fierce un-caged animal that was attacking Harry. The Draco he knew must have died when the dark mark was born to his flesh.
Harry. What Draco mastered in terms of self-preservation, Harry matched in bravery. The fool was too stubborn to see the danger in saving Hogwarts year after year that Draco did. At first, Draco pitied him for it. Thought Potter was mad and there was no use wasting perfect sense on a madman. That was until enough exposure to this infectious excuse for a wizard led Draco to attempt to
After some time in silence, Draco mustered up the strength to speak.
Harry's need to help others, despite their blood status...despite their faults.
That look in the Great Hall seemed to signal that long gone was the Malfoy haughtiness that Harry had become accustomed to throughout their years together-
Would it be back to the hasty blur of Harry's brief words with Katie Bell? Or maybe you would have to go to Katie
have a heart. It began to grow larger as he was exposed to other students and muggle-born professors alike. Even bloody Moaning Myrtle had started to grow on Draco and she wasn't even alive.
Potter wasn't here to save him. He was here to save the day.
"I...I'm just...so tired..." his hoarse voice called beyond the stall.
Harry's eyes enlarged and he felt his heart sink.
Bodies entwined together. Water sputtering from blown sinks, debris scattered across the tile. Mixing of dust and blood across splintered stalls. Moaning Myrtle was by the headmaster's side, yet even she was at a loss for words, but Albus knew better.
. It isn't too late."
Harry spoke with such strong conviction. A look of pure seriousness and Draco knew that these were not the type of words spoken from thin air merely to console another person. Harry whole-heartedly believed them.
Draco's expression changed from uncertain fierceness to bewilderment.
"We are stronger
Then the flashbacks hit.
It was true...
believe that..."
"But I promise if you talk to me...we can fight
Matching the intensity of Draco's gaze he grasped his shoulders and bellowed back.
Moaning Myrtle's familiar shrill was piercing through the clamor of hexes and jinxes both Draco and Harry were flinging at each other.
"Well, I thought of cursing you, but I'm not sure we'd be having this moment if I did."
Draco was torn from his thoughts momentarily as he found his way up the stairs nearing the bathroom. His vest clinging to his shirt clearly wet from adrenaline.
"I know what you did Malfoy."
reassurance to Harry that she was unaware of who hexed her? Harry, of course,  didn't believe her.
Suddenly, this duel didn't matter...the bloody war didn't matter...all that Harry could feel was hatred for the creature that had taken his parents, Sirius, and now...
"Draco...I'm here..." Harry cooed.
Draco internally screamed yet he was heaving and near sobs as he dodged an expelliarmus from Harry, diving behind one of the bathroom stalls.
Frustration bubbled to the surface. How was he going to defeat Lord Voldemort?
he thought to himself. A pang of dread pinched at his chest, causing his right hand to shoot to the spot his tie was fastened, attempting to loosen the constricting grip at his throat. His other hand rummaged through blonde strands of hair, attempting to comb them for comfort. He was tempted to glance back, but lost the courage to. Beyond the beating in his chest he could almost make out faint thuds behind him. Those didn't compare to the pounding of his heart. He felt a sharp sting.
Harry sharply inhaled, discarding any early feelings of sympathy or compassion for the haunted Slytherin and made his way to the bathroom where he saw his former classmate and rival slip in.
Harry slowly stood up, though in a clear limp from the bleeding gash on his knee. He knew calling out to Draco would reveal his location, and yet there were no spells flying his way.
Draco was rocking back and forth, his head in his hands, sobbing. The compulsion to touch this wounded prince proved too much for Harry and he gently knelt in front of the Slytherin, reaching a hand out to softly lie on his back.
"Maybe you feel like you HAD to..." Harry's voice waivered with a tinge of uncertainty.
"We can save the lot of them...your mother and the others."
Harry visiting Draco in the infirmary after his brief time as a ferret, offering a flask of warmed butterbeer with good intention and a half hearted smirk.
Harry broke the silence and Draco could have sworn a piece of him that still clung to hope had shattered as well.

"Draco..."
, confrontation.
Harry was a lion, but Draco...what was he? A snake?
survive this. We can
Continuing his pace, he let out a sarcastic snort. There was no defense at that moment of vulnerability when the dark arts were upon him in his own home.
And Draco's heart began to calm again at Harry's trance inducing voice, lulling him to close his eyes and believe. He welcomed it when Harry spoke again.
At the present, Draco's thoughts shifted back to the night he was marked. With eyes now open he could sense the numbness washing over, his face loosing any signs of emotions.
The second cloak was that of his deranged aunt with a wisp in her eye and cackle upon her lips clenching onto the shoulder of the creature she adored. That creature was the third cloak. Voldemort.
Following her gaze, Harry's view shifted finding the silver haired Slytherin a few feet away at the end of the Great Hall. Draco's eyes were wide. A rare image indeed. He seemed to be slightly shaking. Harry guessed he felt exposed far beyond what one might expect during this evenings dinner.
A cruel wrenching feeling had taken over and Draco felt his face contort in a sadistic expression of rage.
Potter's effects had stirred a change in Draco long before the last memory. In fact, Draco had told his father to spare the damn Hippogriff that nearly chewed his arm off third year because of Harry's soft held empathy for the animal. Hell, even Granger's punch to the face knocked some sense into him. Draco started to appreciate the smart-ass muggle-born. He wanted to see what Harry could in people...something more than breed.
That's where the trouble started. Not only did Lucius want the Hippogriff executed immediately, he began to force Draco to attend his...
Draco glared at the image in the mirror and for a second, he felt those damn sparks again. The same sparks from his childhood. The ones that consumed his chest like a thousand fluttering golden snitches, evading sight or at least attempting to.
Harry shuddered at the thought, remembering the dark mark on Draco's arm.
One that he could never understand nor
hexed an innocent person and was no doubt, working for death eaters...for Voldemort...just like his spineless father.
His wand grasped tightly in his hand, twitching once more with enraged magic that wouldn't be shaken off this time.
"Don't you
Draco whimpered and shook violently grasping the white sink, his knuckles turning red, head down in defeat.
It's a shame Lucius even got out...
Even with Malfoy's constant taunts, Harry did notice that Mal-
Draco felt another surge of pain in his chest as he reached the bathroom.
No snark, no pride, no typical confidence that would admittedly make Harry jump with excitement. Draco was just a defeated soul...difficult to recognize, hunched frame with his back towards Harry and a glaring look in the mirror.
Draco never
He didn't know why, but Harry felt a knot in his stomach. Still...this had to be done. Feigning confidence, he drew his wand steadily with the knot in his stomach churning its way closer to agony, and pointed it to the pale body in front of him.
Truth be told, he had vehemently fought the tears from the excruciating pain applied to both the moon kissed skin of his inner arm and his once tender heart. Sure, Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors alike would argue it's existence, but Draco

A firm statement when Draco was alone in the dungeons. It was after Harry confirmed Lucius involvement with the attack at the ministry, no less. If only Harry knew how much he wanted his father imprisoned, even if it meant the unwanted notoriety as a death eater's son, even if it couldn't bring back Harry's beloved godfather.
Through all the teasing and competition, Draco found himself, dare he say,
he internally berated himself.
He thought. But he was swiftly grasped away from his confusion when he heard the Gryffindor roar again, although with less force.
Meaning something along the lines of tearing skin? Hermione would have known the precise definition. Harry restrained himself in that moment. There had been enough cuts, bruises, tears, pain...Harry couldn't bring himself to inflict anymore, especially not on this...
Draco silently noted how Harry always had a way of doing that. Speaking with such assurance that it became contagious to everyone else.
It sounds masochistic, but in truth Harry felt the most
He winced in pain, but rolled to his side awkwardly aiming an expelliarmus to disarm his lost boy.
the once proud matriarch wailed. But her cries fell on careless ears.
Another involuntary flashback brought him to the moment he locked eyes with Voldemort. The dark lord had a stoic expression on his face and spoke in barely a whisper.
and the bloody Order of the Phoenix as his enemies.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, continuing his rapid pace. Flashbacks from the past six years of his encounters with Malfoy played through his head like a picture show.
"AND YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM THAN ANY OF US. YOU KNOW HIS WEAKNESSES! HIS PLANS!"
Draco felt himself contemplate, shifting his gaze up to the ceiling. He hadn't noticed how high the ceiling was before. No wonder Myrtle loved making bounds across this place.
A gentle inhale of air and Draco coyly opened his eyes, taking in the scene instead of darkness.
In a panic, he threw off his vest, feeling the sweat that had soaked his shirt through, making it cling to his lean frame. Perhaps too lean...
Thoughts of Potter caring about him...even as he was now, defeated and lost...it gave him a warmth that tore through his chest yearning to fill his body. Draco relinquished in the mixed feeling it produced of hate of himself for allowing Potter to have this effect on him and of ecstasy that even in this shit hole, he mattered to Harry.
Despite his current panic, Draco couldn't help but let the ghost of a smirk play across his face at the benevolent thought.
Harry mentally scolded himself. It was a half-hearted scold, but served its purpose nonetheless.
Movement shifted his attention. Harry felt Draco's head turn down, almost burying himself in his shoulder.
Harry called out to Draco who was still partially hidden by the splintered stall door.
There was also the moment Katie's eye's locked on a body behind Harry...
Harry chased after Malfoy from the great hall. If he hadn't been so fixed on catching up with his target, perhaps he would have noticed the tension in Draco's stride, how he fidgeted with his tie and seemed to half glance back every few moments, never long enough to truly be seen by the boy who lived.
When he finally caught up with the young wizard, Harry froze.
His sobbing had stopped, but his breathing hadn't paced yet to a comfortable rhythm and he still couldn't bring himself to look directly at Harry, instead choosing to shuffle back a bit and lean his damp head on Potter's shoulder, still allowing Harry's arm to snake its way past his hip, pulling him closer in a side position. Both boys relying on the fragmented stall for back support.
"PLEASE PLAY NICE. DRACO!"
The perfect blend of innocence.
It was a true Gryffindor roar and Draco felt the stall shake as he continued to grip it for support. Draco was dazed and exhausted, but he couldn't help ponder at Potter's words.
Narcissa was held down by other cloaked figures on her knees by an elegant divan that formerly sat her and Draco. Her typically perfect hair a tangled mess around her tear stained face, no denying the resemblance to her twisted sister. Her delicate hands outstretched and reaching for her son, her only son, being dragged off.
The stress of his fucked up life had taken its toll.
And the rest, they say, is history.
But Harry's call was only met with silence.
when in those heated moments with the serpent prince. Malfoy was the only one who knew how to light a fire under Harry. Making him feel confident, despite the fighting and the insults. There was a spark he felt whenever in the same room as Malfoy and its what kept him going...proving himself throughout the years.
The last portion felt like a scream through his mind.
And Harry was telling the truth. There was a moment he almost called out the curse in his newly found potions book.
Lucius Malfoy was the
The tears started flowing and Draco hated that he could be reduced to this by Harry Potter's voice alone. Mustering what strength he could, Draco finally ended his silent vow.
If there were any hope for the young Malfoy, for any of them, it would have to come from a source even Voldemort himself could never wield.
Draco was pulled away roughly and brought to three cloaked figures a few feet away. He was difficult to push, but didn't dare overtly struggle less he upset the death eaters and risk a hex to his mother who was left behind. It was only when he felt Lucius's cold serpentine hands tightly wrapped upon his arm that he gazed away from his mother's fading view to his father. The man looked like a coward as he held Draco's moonlit arm in place. Bruises already starting to form.
And Draco truly believed it...what good was he to anyone?
the mark also meant exiling himself from the one person he had been infatuated with since he entered Hogwarts. The one half blood that started to make him doubt his father's ridiculous obsession with blood purity, the boy who matched Draco in Qudditch, acted with bravery when Draco himself struggled to grasp the concept, and helped Draco refine his wit, determination, and sarcasm with each heated, albeit
Draco turned around in a clumsy fashion. His hair drenched with sweat and the look of panic twisted with...fear? No, not fear...utter damnation, Harry thought to himself as he stared down the sunken form in front of him.
Harry limped through the rubble, stopping to pick up Draco's wand, storing it in his back pocket just for additional safety.
Draco's shirt was ripped and there were trickles of blood sliding down his arm too, drawing attention to a rather large bruise...no...skull that Draco had embedded on his skin.
The fumbling wizard felt his lungs burn as he paced the halls and dimly lit stone corridors searching for Myrtle's bathroom. Ironically, it had become a safe place since withdrawing from his old life at Hogwarts. Students were known to avoid Myrtle and her incessant wailing, but it was the only company Draco had.
All Harry could do was toss his head back, close his eyes, and allow a miniature smile to play across his lips. He needed some lightness, a calm from the storm that had just passed.
A thump in his heart hit again. That damn curse only Draco could cast.
Draco bemused to himself.
Even now the thought was enough to elicit a clenched fist from Draco, finger nails digging into the soft flesh.
never
It all happened in such quick moments. One with a time turner wouldn't be sure how far to go back to catch each detail.
In one swift motion, Harry maneuvered himself to face the torn wizard once more. He grasped Draco's faintly scratched chin, forcing the boy to look into his deep green eyes.
"Draco...I
And yes, Draco's words stung Harry, but he knew that this was the moment to capitalize on the return of his dragon spirit.
The power that emitted from the wand was more painful than anything Draco had ever experienced in Defense Against the Dark Arts duels.
"BOYS. BOYS. STOP THIS!"
Harry lowered his wand and slightly inched closer. His breathes beginning to slow.
But as he continued to glare...his eyes slowly began to soften. There was something on Harry's face. Could it be...no...maybe...maybe there was a hint of
Harry couldn't believe it. His silver fox wasn't gone...he was just lost.
A momentary break from the memories found Draco swallowing hard, his mouth already equitably dry from his quick pace.
Harry watched as a silent hex was impulsively cast in his direction.
Myrtle circled the top of the bathroom flying past Harry to find where Draco had been hiding, but was only met with a blast of red from Draco's wand, clumsily searching for it's target.
came back.
There it was, the soothing care in Harry's voice. Perhaps it was exhaustion. The overwhelming physical pain, mental drain, as well as emotional fatigue Draco had been sporting for months...but damn it, he wanted the warmth Harry was selling. He
"We can beat him."
Draco's face tightened in pain at the remembrance.
Anger propelled Draco to spin forward and silently cast a rather harsh disarming hex. Something he picked up from training with Bellatrix.
"He's got my mother! You may not have met yours but I DON'T want to loose MINE!"
"Draco...you don't have to do this. I know you hexed Katie."
But that was before...
. What he hated was how much the raven-haired, boy wonder, bloody chosen git could make him
, was hiding something...something tender and caring and a piece Harry just knew existed beneath all the bloody hell he put him through.
Harry clutched his chest with his free hand. Had there ever been such a time?
Harry's eyes widened in shock, mouth agape.
This was new for Draco. Harry had seen fear on him when Buckbeak took a chunk out of his arm third year. He had seen embarrassment and shame whenever Draco was in the presence of his bastard of a death eater father, but Harry could hardly recognize this broken soul quaking in front of him, a discarded vest to the floor, and an overflow of water pouring from Draco's abandoned sink.
Harry went on.
you hear me. You aren't hexing me so you must be listening."
The look Malfoy gave him at the Great Hall flashed in his head. It was something Harry didn't recognize and that unsettled him. Usually all it took was a glance Malfoy's way and he could tell if the other had been cocky, determined, annoyed, even hurt that usually came laced with a prideful stance in his demeanor. Draco was always too proud to let his feelings be known for long. Something Harry wished he could gain trust to.
This year there were no troves of Slytherin followers, no time to taut his advanced skills in potions, no purpose to carve an identity for himself ever since-
The dark lord drew a flick of his wand that expelled a green light so powerful that it burned through Draco's skin with the force of a Hungarian Horntail's fire breath. He twisted his head in pain and gritted his teeth, stifling the yearning scream in his throat, writhing as his arm was firmly held in place by his own father.
"I know what you did Malfoy."
Harry covering him during their violent Qudditch match second year.
It didn't matter.
