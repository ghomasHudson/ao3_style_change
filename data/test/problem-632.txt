“I would remind you that you are a dirty liar, Pansy Parkinson, and that Jesus would not approve of this harassment.”
“It was just a fever,” the woman who must be Viola’s mother whispers. “You can’t die from a fever. Kids get them all the time. It’s just a fever.” And the whispers continue, on an on. A litany. A prayer.
“It’s so obvious in retrospect,” Pansy is saying as Harry lays down, head settling into the cushions, and loses his grip on the world. “He would’ve died first year without you, wouldn’t he?”
him, Harry realizes, as he inches forward and leans in close. An older version of himself, all muscle and hard weather. “Don’t you fucking dare.” Dream Harry pulls the broken pieces of Draco into his arms and carries him inside, slamming the door hard enough to shake the hinges.
A pretty brunette glares, and Pansy grins back with teeth. “See something you like?” Pansy says, something hot behind her words. Draco expects a blush, or embarrassment, but the brunette has the decorum of a gypsy, and her irritation melts as her eyes rove over Pansy’s body.
No one’s moving, a thousand breaths trapped in a thousand chests. Purple robes frozen, slack jaws hanging in stasis. The silence is unnatural—this many people shouldn’t be so still.
“What?” It was then that he’d known, in the uncanny way that Harry always knew when danger was stepping onto the stage to turn the tale into tragedy, that something was wrong.
Draco sobs, buries his face in Harry’s chest, but Harry is enraptured, presses Draco’s forearm to his lips and just holds it there. “Beautiful,” Harry mumbles against the skin. “So beautiful.”
No matter how many times Harry replays the memory, this moment is impossible. In the pensieve, Harry can see himself, knees on the stone floor, blinking and blinking and blinking. And then the world explodes into white.
“Fuck,” he says, thrashing under his comforter. The down filling chuckles as he tries to kick himself to freedom.
“Lucy,” Malfoy says, striding into the middle of the group, “has auditory and tactile hallucinations. Do you know what that means?”
Nothing changed between them, not visibly, except that Hermione started coming over for lunch. Every day in the beginning. Having someone there—not saying anything inspiring or motivational or trying to fix him, just existing in his space—had helped suck some of the cloying despair from inside his chest.
And those fucking grey eyes, lifting as Harry approaches. The attention is singular, focused, as if he is the only person in the world who matters. It’s as intense as it was the first time, that night in A&E.
“I wonder what brought him here,” Hermione says. “To counselling and helping Muggles. You should ask him.”
“You’re unbelievable.” Pansy strides into the flat, four-inch heels clacking on the hardwood. “Both of you.”
As the damp air settles on his tongue, Draco makes a decision. “If you won’t come to me,” he whispers to no one, “then I will come to you.”
It’s the cold that wakes him. There’s a draft whistling in through the window and it’s tickling his feet, where they dangle over the edge of the bed.
“Fucking mental,” Megan mutters (Harry’s sure that this one is actually named Megan). They’re all clustered around the nursing station.
“So, after a truly horrible betrayal where one of his closest companions betrayed him with—wait for it—a kiss! Judas sealed his wicked scheme with a kiss, Pans! How did I never think of that?”
Later, with Pansy sprawled across his bedroom floor in a velour track suit, Draco feels the wrongness of the day settle like debris. These were not the dreams he’d had at eleven, boarding the Hogwarts express and waving goodbye to his childhood. He’d not imagined himself a public enemy, a villain. He’d never thought himself to be a cautionary tale.
“It is,” Hermione says, and even though it’s approaching one in the morning, Harry sees that look burrowing in. Hermione has her thinking face on. “As much as he was an entitled blood purist, he was also clever.”
Of course there would. While the St. Mungo’s graduation celebration for newly minted healers was not a socially significant affair, the saviour of the wizarding world was attending a public event for the first time in years. High society would be chomping at the bit for a ticket. Every important ministry official would be in attendance.
Draco wants to run—he’s always been a coward, he knows, he knows. But a bigger part of him wants to lean into the violence. To feel someone finally take their pound of flesh. Someone had to.
“Agree to disagree,” Potter said, eyes fixed on the road, and Draco had no idea what to do with that. A version of Potter who didn’t loathe him—who though he was
Draco tries to sit up. “Holy fucking shit on a stick, my head!” he says, flopping back into starchy sheets. “What the fuck!”
“I could have just hexed you. You were breaking and entering, you know,” Pansy drawls, taking a generous sip of her wine.
“You look—” Draco starts, but can’t quite articulate the unique twist of desire in his stomach; he feels like he’s fallen from a broom.
White-blond hair was a paintbrush dipped in deep red, flecks of blood scattered across the stone floor. “Oh god.” Harry was by her side, on his knees next to Narcissa Malfoy’s body “No.”
“You’re terrible,” says Ron, but takes his Breezer, looking at it as if it’s a revelation. “You know, this tastes too good to be alcoholic.”
Malfoy’s eyes were still closed and Harry wondered what was so wrong about it. Found that he wanted to interrupt. To ask what was so wrong—
“Done,” Draco says, cinching the knot to Harry’s throat, gently pressing the starched shirt collar flat.
“You’re supposed to hate me,” Draco said, more to himself, as he walked around the truck, hopped up onto the seat, and slammed the door.
Three words that slip in through Draco’s sharp intake of breath and squeeze the chambers of his heart into that shape of Harry’s palm. “You don’t need Yeats when you say things like that,” Draco whispers, and the wind picks up the words and sends them rustling through the fields.
“Quick quills,” Harry says, collapsing into his hands. Under his elbows, a few of the paper charts fall to the floor. “I fucking hate these stupid pens. Like, I know that they’re a clever invention. I get that. But I’m this close to breaking the international statute of secrecy, for a fucking quick quill.”
Pansy is standing in the doorway, a paper bag of groceries in one hand, her key dangling from the door.
Draco steps forward, grey dress robes folding around him like stardust woven into fabric. If he was re-entering wizarding society on the arm of Harry fucking Potter, he was going to look his best.
Draco thinks, and realizes that his mother wants to see him. That the worry on her face is genuine and that their afternoon in Diagon had shaken her to the point of hand delivering food to his guests.
“You can’t save everyone!” Draco explodes. “You can’t fix everything. Or be the centre of every fucking universe.”
The night had fallen on the world hours ago. Draco couldn’t see much past the truck’s high beams. They carved the dark open with their solitary blast of white light.
He’s going to have to explain. The water presses against his forehead and Harry leans into it. He’ll have to explain, and it’s all so stupid, isn’t it? People die all the time; Harry’s watched them go, has found them cold, and so he knows this is stupid and that Draco’s going to see.
He pawed at her broken limbs, barely touching, not sure what his hands were supposed to be doing. Her thin lips were blue.
Draco feels Harry’s magic humming; Potter’s always been powerful, and that hasn’t changed in this universe. The street is a battlefield, curses flying everywhere, and Potter is a power plant, magic is rolling off of him in waves. There are civilians everywhere, trying to escape the duel that spilled out into their everyday lives.
Granger nods, but she’s still looking at Draco. Bushy hair shades him from the sun and he can’t place what he sees in his face.
“Neither am I.” But Draco did want him.  It was there in the way he looked at Harry, wild and possessive.
The consequences of his obsession spill around him. Draco’s record player is askew, all of his lovely vinyl albums spread across the floor like playing cards. Dirt mixes with books, and there’s dozens of those strange vials glistening in the moonlight. They look silvery, almost like memories. Harry feels the urge to collect them, to tuck them back into the chest he’s upended.
,” he had said when Harry’s temper raged in Draco’s small office, and Draco’d been sure that this was how he died, burnt alive in a fit of Harry’s wild magic, it was so hot on his skin.
Harry’s not ready for him to disappear again, and so pushes through the door and collapses into another chair. The cheap plastic wheels scrape the tile.
Draco forces his key into the lock, trying to forget that his shoes are currently the consistency of soggy bread.
It was a future they would never have and it was because of him, the result of choices Harry’d made that he’s still not sure were the right ones.
“Yes,” Draco says into his mouth and Harry gasps as those lovely hands—strong hands—grab his shoulders and push him onto his back. For a flash, Harry’s eyes snap open, and he’s sure that the world is unravelling. Because Draco Malfoy is above him, knees on either side of his hips, holding him down. He’s panting and looking at Harry like…
For a moment, Harry almost retreats. It’s the look on Malfoy’s face that pulls him back. Grey eyes stare at the ceiling, vacant and sad. Almost like Malfoy has slipped out of focus, onto another track, into another world.
“That’s really not how we normally handle these things. The counsellors have a lot of insight into the patient’s mental state. It’s important to listen—”
“An escort from one of the golden trio? I think not. I’d rather not indebt myself to you further,” Draco says, but Granger’s looking at his mother.
“Sit.” Pansy is stern and Harry is afraid and so he rises from the floor and collapses onto the sofa without protest. The shock of Pansy’s appearance mingles with the panic and Harry feels weak, like all his bones have gone soft.
It had been six months since anyone had heard from Draco Malfoy. Six months since the Prophet had reported on a mob attacking
Pansy was right about the direction of Draco’s thoughts—which were Potter, always Potter—but she was wrong about the depth, of how deeply Harry Potter cut into him. More permanent than the Sectumsempra scars he wore on his chest. The spell was going to kill him, but he would go willingly if it meant he could have Potter.
The moon bulges above them and Harry looks up. There’s comfort in the lidless dilation and he’s calm as Hermione’s spell swells in his chest.
“Nothing,” Harry lies, stomping to the stove and ladling Hermione a massive bowl of soup. Harry likes soup. It warms you on the inside. It was the first thing he’d done after he woke up and his brain still itched.
“No, not at all.” Faux indifference slips off his tongue. “You walking out in the middle of the night and leaving me alone—”
For a moment, the panic stands still. Harry jerks his head up, winded and dizzy and confused, and there’s Pansy Parkinson right there in front of him. She’s standing in the doorway, a bag of groceries on the floor next to her, a stray orange rolling away.
Harry could, though. As the arrows they’d flung at one another rattle around inside his head, it’s this that scares him more than anything else.
Harry is unfazed. The task of acquiring several pints of human blood had fallen to him, and he’d agreed easily enough.
This is my first Drarry and I'm just dazzled by the folks reading so far. Thank you so very very much <3
Later, Robertson would corner him in Literary Fiction, his caterpillar eyebrows full of mischief. “He left you this,” Robertson says, handing Draco a slip of paper with a phone number on it.
“Doesn’t it? You’d have to be daft, really have to make an effort at idiocy to turn down something that improves patient care
Robertson harumphs in his direction. “It’s less about fondness and more about the world’s slow descent into lazy diction. In my day, a suitor would have come prepared, armed with the words of his better—poets and philosophers. He would have spread his dreams beneath your feet. He would have romanced you in several different languages.”
Harry sighs. “No.” That had been Harry, through and through, and Draco loved him for it, although he still hadn’t said.
She does not break eye contact as her tiny white paw pushes the glass off the counter and onto the floor.
“What’s the point of going home?” Draco’s been skittering from universe to universe, a rock skipping on a smooth lake, jumping and jumping and never sinking.
“It means that she can hear people speaking to her. All the time. Lucy has a voice profile of thirteen abusive hallucinations. And, how did you put it, Megan?” Malfoy pauses to let the tension simmer. “That she was talking to the walls with her ass cheeks hanging out?””
“I’m sorry that I haven’t had time to brush up on the entire history of auto mechanics!” Draco wails, sounding like Celine again. “Although I’m definitely going to ask Robertson for some clarity on the situation tomorrow.”
He’d found the spell—a messy ancient thing—in his great great uncle Cassius’s collection, scrawled in the margins. It was peak idiocy, casting a handwritten spell. Draco knew it, but then he’d never been very good when left on his own. Wallowing had soured to recklessness and Draco had hoped doing
It feels intrusive, somehow, as he watches himself pull Draco tight against his chest, press his nose to Draco’s neck, breathe in the smell of him and shudder against the swell of Draco’s breathing. “I love you,” this Harry says, lips against the knob in his spine. And again, “I love you,” into white blond hair.
“Why don’t you go on,” Ron says, tucking a wild strand of hair behind Hermione’s ear with casual affection that’s nearly a decade old. “What were you saying about Malfoy?”
“Anything.” Books collapse, pages spilling, spines leaning, stories splayed open. The living room spins.
Which is when he sees the black lines crawling over exposed flesh. “Your tattoo,” Harry breathes, still clutching, still holding.
“Really?” Harry hears his voice rise an octave. This is not going to be good. “Not much to explain, now is there?”
A man in a blue uniform slams the driver’s side door and begins to close the distance. Draco wonders if this is the Muggle Aurors, but that wouldn’t make sense, because he wasn’t doing anything illegal.
A soft scuffle disturbs the quiet. Leather shoes on flooring. As Draco creeps down the hall, the warmth of a fresh fire casts long shadows out into the dark.
“We sacrificed so much. It seems stupid to tear ourselves apart now,” Potter says, letting out a breath he must’ve been holding. “It’s over. Just let it be over.” Draco can hear all of Potter’s bruises in this final line; he sounds so tired.
Fists pound against Harry’s chest, his fingernails tear lines into Harry’s arms. He rails against Potter’s firm chest. Violence. It’s all violence.
“You were up to something!” Harry’s anger is an open flame; he hasn’t felt this much of anything in months. “And I didn’t stalk!”
“It’s okay if you don’t—I mean, I figured it was a long shot, look at you—” And Draco was going to die.
Pain shudders, bright and fresh across his chest, and this is a wound that he knows. Remembers. A bathroom, the angry syllables of
Until he’d watched himself flicker out of existence—it was a rather bleak thing to witness, knowing that one day he would stop coming back.
“What? No!” Harry scrambles to fix whatever he’s broken. His words, as always, are blunt objects. “I just…when I picture it. You with a kid.” Harry smiles. “It’s just unexpected.”
It was cheating, really, to look that good in profile. “I wouldn’t,” Malfoy says, so serious that Harry believes him instantly. “Now stop stalling. We came to drink, not to linger awkwardly outside.”
Time stretches and they eventually find Emma sitting on a shag carpet, back pressed against a lazy couch. She’s balancing a chipped glass atop a guitar, humming softly. “Harry!” she shouts when she sees him, and the look on her face is so relaxed and good-natured, that Harry actually believes her when she thanks him for coming.
Draco finds Jesus and then tips into a universe where Voldemort wasn't defeated at the Battle of Hogwarts (he’s having quite a day). Weariness watches the traffic flow on the edge of Archway bridge and Draco discovers that heroes are not always unbreakable.
Draco snorts, but lets her lead him inside. It looks like he may have to tell Pansy about the curse after all.
“You’re a menace, Pans,” Draco says, aiming for his bedroom, but those blasted coolers have impaired his senses.
The moment holds, the distance between their noses a joke, and then Harry watches himself take Draco’s face in his hands.
The world was an earthquake. Public riots rocked the streets every and people were picketing outside the houses of influential Wizengamot members. Acres of pure blood wizarding lands went up in flames and the Prophet turning up the heat, with editorials on both sides, and washing their hands clean of the world on fire.
“Uh? Draco Malfoy?” Harry says, rubbing the back of his neck. This was a terrible idea. It would probably be better to just run now and—
Malfoy is in the department again, arranging an appointment with the on-call psychiatrist. It’s for a patient—Lucy Freedman, Harry remembers—who had walked into the waiting room in a thong and a sports bra and nothing else.
“Amber, have you considered the benefits of a mobile unit? Like, have you actually thought about it? The cost-benefit analysis is excellent.” Malfoy’s voice is pressured, as if he’s trying very hard not to lose his cool.
They were gone before the stands could empty. Before he could find Potter and do…he’s honestly not sure.
Draco looks down at his robes, notices that they’re different than the ones he would normally wear. The material is heavier, and now that there aren’t a dozen curses flying above his head, Draco can feel subtle spellwork woven into the threads. Anti-inflammatory spells, water resistant material, spells to resist stains and blemishes—Draco chuckles at his vanity, but isn’t surprised. He checks his pockets. Dragon leather gloves and sprigs of sage and rosemary.
Harry waves a hand, as if this detail merits little notice. “He said I should woo you in multiple languages, but I can’t. I came after you and I’m still not sure if I’ll be…” Harry closes his eyes, and in spite of the ragged blue jeans and the plain t-shirt, Draco sees the sun glancing off of his skin and is sure that nothing has even been so beautiful. “I’m not sure if I’ll be enough.”
“At Malfoy manor,” adds Malfoy. “They used to live on the grounds. There was one that was pure white…” The memory takes him and Harry can’t stop looking at Malfoy’s mouth; his lips are still parted.
Everything is bleary and bright. Draco presses his palms into his eyes and tries to push away the pain. It doesn’t work. The meat of his palms comes away black—
“Start with the sage, and then the lavender next, and then—” her voice cracks. “Then we’ll be ready.”
“—the way he’d seemed to…” Pansy bites her lip; it’s painted bright red. “Fade. He was fading. I didn’t notice him half the time, even when he must’ve been home in the flat. Usually his voice could bring me back, and I’d remember, but it was getting worse.”
“Stop,” Ron wails, pulling his woolly hat down over his eyes. It was maroon and clashed violently with his hair. Draco told him so at every opportunity and Ron had taken this as a challenge to locate and purchase a legion of red hats.
But that plan backfired spectacularly, as all of the sounds sharpened. Malfoy’s hand moving, sharp breaths, and the crunch of gravel under shoes.
It’s with a grin as wide as a watermelon that Harry turns towards Room 5—one of the few places in the department with a door.
“Stop!” Harry says, and Bella meows and Harry finally finds the device causing the commotion in a drawer in his entranceway.
Draco stares until he finds whatever he’d been looking for, and then stands. He does not let go of Harry’s hand.
“Okay,” Harry thinks he says. The tiny room holds its breath and Malfoy looks like he’s considering something. And nothing exists between the silence and what Malfoy might say.
“No don’t—” Harry flinches, because there’s probably vomit and blood on him and Draco is clean. Harry doesn’t want anyone else to touch the remains of his night.
Harry’s dancing, Draco’s smoking, and Harry knows he’s really not supposed to want this. He does anyway. (Typical, Harry. Way to be predictable)
“Hoy shit,” Harry breathes. Because, until this moment, he’d sort of thought it hadn’t been real. He’d given up on ever finding Draco Malfoy.
“I’m coming!” Harry shouts, scrambling for an undershirt. He needs to hurry, because if he doesn’t, the demon cat will not be happy, and when she’s unhappy…Harry shudders and hurries down the stairs to the kitchen.
“And you’re only coming to Granger now? Really, you’ve saved the world several times over in much more efficient fashion. I’m beginning to think that it was Granger who did the heavy lifting. She’s certainly the one doing it now.”
His fingers dash to reply—filled with adrenaline because Draco had asked about him, but Draco is a prodigious texter and beats him to it.
For a long moment that could only have been a few seconds but that feels like forever, the words hang in the air between them. The sincerity in Draco’s voice, in the way that he’s looking at Harry, almost convinces him. Almost. “Are you fucking joking?”
Draco looks at John, notices something warm in his fingertips, and realizes that he can feel the curse, curling her hands between his.
“You impatient little shit,” Harry says, fishing a tin of soft food from the bottom shelf and spooning it into her dish.
The years slip from finger to finger as he counts them on his hand. “Five, I think? Started right after the trial.”
“I dreamt about you,” Harry whispers, much much later, pushing his face into Draco’s chest. It feels like a safe place to leave a confession, pressing the secret words onto Draco’s skin.
“Me neither.” Draco closes his eyes and he can almost feel the heat of Potter’s body, the smell of old leather, the stubble scratching against his cheek. “Me neither.”
He’d told Hermione. It was a secret that was elusive when it came to articulation—he just didn’t know how to say out loud the thing that he was so sure was true.
Harry lowers the book to eye level and shrugs. Everything has felt a bit fuzzy since Robertson said the words “love” and “there it is.”
The world is wobbling and Draco’s skin is hot but he doesn’t care. He’s above everything now. The ache of what’s happened is so far away, and it’s okay now. Everything’s okay.
“I like you,” Harry hears himself say, his America voice low and afraid. “Have for a long time. So long.”
“You want to give me free labour?” Robertson had said, white hair crackling with the humidity. The man cast an imposing figure. He was tall and broad as a battle axe, but with the mania of those professor types who are always on the brink of the next discovery that will change the world.
His chest is heaving with the effort of trying to match Celine fucking Dion, tears are streaming down his cheeks, and Draco doesn’t care.
“Were you not listening?” Draco says, looking down his nose at this oversized ball of muscle. “I’m just fine up here. In no need of assistance. And you are not adding much to the quality of the conversation, so if you could go away, I’d very much appreciate it.”
Anger claws at his throat. And when Potter reveals that he’d been there at the top of the Astronomy tower, Draco can’t bear it. He’s carved his palms open with ragged fingernails.
“Looks like you’re having the shittiest day if your life,” John says, treating his tears as if they’re invisible.
“Oh,” Pansy says, abandoning her groceries and hurrying to his side. “Oh, you’ve gone and caught feelings, haven’t you?” She pulls Draco’s head into her lap and begins stroking his hair. The feel of Pansy’s hands is a secret comfort that he guards jealously.
“Uh,” Harry gasps. His breathing is out of control and the dirt won’t go back into Draco’s plastic pot. “I’m—” But there’s no way to finish that sentence, because there is no explanation for what he’s doing.
“No,” Draco says, slowly, because who did this man think he was, telling Draco what to do? “I don’t think I will.”
Some days, though, Harry wanted to be more of a man than corpse. Some days, he felt like Hermione had managed it and that he’d come back to life. Some days—
The words had peeled off his skin and laid him bare. Potter had said that. Had narrowed his singular green eyes and said,
“Left me in his fucking flat to show myself out,” Harry says, the memory stinging. “If he’d thought it was a mistake, he should’ve at least said so to my face. It was passive aggressive and a shitty thing to do—”
“I haven’t really figured that out. I want—” But he doesn’t know what he wants. Because, “I’m not supposed to want this,” he says, out loud for the first time since he’d realized that wanting Malfoy was something seared into him—permanent, scarring.
There was a door off to the left, and Harry had forced himself through it. He heard the metal slam against brick and then he collapsed onto the edge of a metal fence.
Draco’s eyes follow Harry’s. “Those? Oh.” A hint of embarrassment, followed by, “they’re done by my patients.”
Another whoop, another stern glare, but Harry feels lighter. As if the catastrophe of the last few hours can be undone. “But I fucked it. Or he did. I dunno.”
The confusion settles on him slowly. Spell Damage was not where they kept the dead. “What did you mean, you
“I dunno,” Harry says, realizing how little information he’s gleaned from his time with Malfoy and making a mental note to pay more attention to questions and less to the lips answering them.
There were so many bodies. Pressed up against each other and moving. Trapped in the pull of a song and a drink.
“She can help,” Harry says. The details of how Hermione figures things out have always felt vague, a secret plucked out of a book somewhere at the last possible moment, but he knows she’ll come through in the same way that he knows the sun will rise tomorrow. “We have to get him back.”
Emma’s sweet features were all scowl and Harry scuttled away before she could say anything else. Away from everything that was blond and distracting and who fucked him in his dreams at least twice a month.
“How…” The moment feels fragile and Harry’s sure that he’ll break it. His words have always been blunt objects.
A thread that resisted divergence, twisted tight around Draco, tying their lives into tandem. With love. Because Harry always loved him. With anger sometimes, and reluctance, and passion and something unfaltering. Harry Potter loved him.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Hermione says, passing Harry his own cup and settling down next to him. “You don’t have to.”
“Watch the airway,” Harry says. You wouldn’t think that someone with a seizure would die because they couldn’t breathe, but Harry knew better. It was so easy—common, even—for a patient to bite down on their tongue and bleed, or vomit and choke, or—
“Er,” Harry says, at a total loss. “Do you have a bag?” This seems to startle Robertson out of his musings. “CRADLE THE WORDS IN YOUR ARMS!” he bellows. “Treat them with dignity! REVERENCE!”
The fucking cat is poised on the edge of his kitchen counter. A single fluffy paw is raised, poised in front of a glass. That particular glass is special to him, a gift from Ron, after he’d agreed to be his best man. It’s got Harry’s fucking name on it.
. He scoots back across the room and settles down next to Pansy. She’s taken her socks off and is wiggling her toes.
For now, though, Harry’s content to rub Draco’s shampoo into his hair and drown in the smell of citrus and spice. To rinse the evidence of a thousand emergencies down the drain and to cover himself up in Draco’s towels and then his clothes and to hold on to this moment where it’s alright.
Because dream Malfoy and real Malfoy aren’t the same and he doesn’t care anyways. Because he’s not supposed to want this and Malfoy can leave if he wants to.
The air is sticky and wet on his skin and Draco leans into it, accepts the dusting of moisture on his nose and his cheeks in the same way he accepts the pull of his wand as it takes him to Harry.
There is a long silence, in which Draco collects himself from the floor with as much dignity as he can manage—not very much—and Robertson levels him with one of his serious looks. “Draco. Why don’t you tell me what’s actually ailing you? Rather than your failure to engage in what the bard would call the beast with two backs.”
“You’re both so emotionally constipated. I can’t believe you made it this far without external intervention,” Pansy says. Harry doesn’t know how to reply and so takes a long gulp of his cocoa.
Harry can feel his pulse in his throat. Malfoy knows his schedule. Which means he sought it out, which means he was thinking about him—the mobile pings and Harry can’t look at it quickly enough.
Pansy looks up, sees him, and Draco can breathe again. “Oh?” says Pansy, “look at you, waxing philosophical.”
“Spread your dreams beneath his feet,” Robertson says. “And perhaps then you will deserve his affections.”
Harry watches his own eyes close, sees himself press his head to Draco’s, match his breathing, and then, finally, sleep.
Harry’d grinned, lips stretching. He’d been hungry, so hungry, and all he wanted was Draco. Without preamble, Harry swallowed him all the way down.
Pansy sighs extravagantly. “It’s multiple universes. Different worlds, where he lives as himself until the curse decides it’s done with him and sends him home again. It’s normally not a big deal.”
Harry is shaking all over. Draco is staring at him with a look that is simultaneously desperate and furious.
It’s a few inches across—that’s all—and Draco feels his balance lurch, feels himself pitch forward and then lurch back. “Oh,” he breathes, throwing his arms out like a bird to help steady the wobbly world.
“Not even I could set that mess to rights,” Malfoy says, and he’s smiling. It’s just a gentle thing, but Harry can see it, playing across his lips.
“That the entire wizarding world would forgive my sins? That I would settle into high society and rule the world from the various important boards I would inevitably find myself sitting on?”
the way Harry looks at him. The universes are different, the context wild and varied, but that look…it does not change or falter.
“All of those questions. I’ve watched them building up since that first day in A&E,” Draco says, setting the bottle on the cement. “Just ask.”
Draco snorts—it’s undignified and wonderful. “Hair should not be orange,” Draco says, and he’s smiling at her. “And frosted tips will never be cool. Just wait. Future decades will laugh at you.”
“Propositioning me is quite a hopeless venture these days,” Draco goes on, undeterred. “Unless you have a secret dick somewhere—”
Draco’s on a balcony overlooking the gardens, which feel freshly scrubbed but lonely, too. The manor hasn’t recovered from the war. It's still standing, still grandiose in the way that old buildings tend to be, even after they’ve been gutted and damaged. There’d been peacocks once. They’d strutted, arrogant and fanciful and far too brazen for their own good, before Macnair had butchered them all. For sport. Draco had watched, hadn’t stopped him.
“Look,” Harry yawns, surveying the room for the first time and realizing that they must’ve been here for several hours. Hermione has entered full research mode, the evidence exploding all over the floor. “I’m just going to shut my eyes for a bit. Just a bit.”
Horrifically, Draco realizes he’s going to cry. He bites the inside of his cheek to stop the assault, but he’s too late.
“S’alright,” Harry said, not ready to explain the circulatory system and blood draws to two pure blood wizards. “I can get the blood.”
“The one where you lament about things I can’t talk about and I apologize for being the most catastrophic kind of arsehole. And you ask me several intrusive questions that will inevitably be some variation of ‘What is Malfoy up to?’ I just…” Malfoy takes a shaky breath. “I can’t. At least, not sober.”
“I’m peeing!” Draco shouted, barely registering how undignified he sounded or how distressed his mother would be to know that the word ‘peeing’ had come out of his mouth.
In the weeks and months following the Battle of Hogwarts, the Ministry had opened all trials for alleged Death Eaters to the public, in an effort to avoid the hushed suspicion that certain families were buying their freedom. Dollars soaked in blood to smother the guilt. And so Draco’s shame would be witnessed by most of wizarding London.
Handover in A&E is at 5:00pm and Harry’s watch tells him he has forty minutes until he needs to be back in Emerg.
They’re all tempting options. But as Draco flicks through his ever-expanding CD collection, he realizes that there was only ever one person who could capture his mood in this moment.
The draft nips at his bare chest, and Harry almost crawls back into bed because Draco won’t be long and he could just wait for him to return. But the need to hold, to be held, drags him up and out of the bed, through every room in the flat.
The Emergency Room had slowed. Malfoy had looked up and Harry pinned like a butterfly in a shadow box. He looked at Harry like he was a mirage, grey eyes wide and afraid.
“It was not the most likely outcome when this day began,” Narcissa replies, and Draco wishes he could reach across the formalities and hold her.
“I can page him,” Emma said, as Harry looked down at the assessments Malfoy had attached to the chart. Five years, and his handwriting was still cramped and neat
The dance floor had a heartbeat and was sending shock waves through Harry’s bones. The whole world swayed around him. There were just so many people. Sweat rolled down Harry’s forehead, but not the warm kind spurred on by dancing or arousal. The cold kind that turned his skin the texture of raw meat.
“I was worried about you,” Draco answers, keeping with the truth. The moment is too fragile for sarcasm, too breakable for humour.
, Harry remembers. The site of a meteor strike, a thousand years ago and Draco had wanted to see it. Harry, unable to deny him anything, had agreed without question.
“But—” Harry can’t seem to line his words up. “But that’s gotta be dangerous! Like, time turners are usually bad enough. This is the whole universe! That’s gotta be worse.”
Robertson’s brow contracts with concern. “If I ever encounter this young gentleman, I’ll be sure to set him straight. Whether or not I believe him deserving. If that is what you wish.”
“Uh…I’m here with Malfoy’s wand?” Harry said to the air in front of the gate, kicking at the gravel with his trainers.
“You look better,” Draco says when Harry pads down the hall to find him. It’s late, Harry realizes, too late for visitors, but Draco’d asked him over, had said it was okay. He’s sitting right there on the couch, a mug pressed to his lips.
“No shit, Sherlock,” Pansy says, strutting back into the living room with a cup in each hand. “I’ve become quite the expert in Muggle sayings, by the way.”
“Right. Now, sit on the couch like a good little boy while I make you some cocoa.” Her black eyeliner makes her eyes look enormous. It’s smudged, as if she’s been crying or trying to rub away the exhaustion.
After an hour passes, though, Harry thanks Emma and shows himself out. He definitely doesn’t spend five minutes scrutinizing the pile of shoes, nor does he notice that Malfoy’s lovely leather boots are no longer there.
But Harry’s not done. “You’ve always been a coward. Running or just giving up when things get hard—”
Draco had lied. To himself and the curse. But she knew. Draco didn’t understand it—the hows of it were made of magic—but he knew that the curse could feel the want still thrumming in Draco’s blood.
isn’t exactly the kind of language that one uses to address the Wizengamot. Draco can’t stop staring at the shoes, because he’s scared. He's so scared and looking at it will make it worse.
“Don’t wanna live by myself by myself anymore!” He lets the strangled note drift off as it fades to black.
“I’m sorry.” Draco barely hears her. But he feels Pansy’s hands rubbing soothing circles into his back. “I’m sorry,” she says again. “I’m sorry.”
“This is—” Draco gasps and Harry dances around him, ghostly hands fluttering and useless, “inconvenient.” As his insides start to pool around his spindly limbs, Draco raises his wand arm and whispers, “
known. Even if his understanding of what infinite worlds and the multiverse was incomplete, he’d known that finding Draco and returning home at all had been a long shot. Trying to get a fix on her eyes, as they shift in a face that’s made of a thousand other faces, Harry says, “But I had to try.”
“The perils of the Chosen One. Reduced to hand cramps and some semblance of legibility. However will you survive?” Five years ago, Harry would’ve assumed Malfoy’d meant those words to wound.
“It’s in poor taste to insult your host, Weasel,” Pansy says, and proceeds to flay Ron with her sharp tongue. Harry briefly wonders if she’d learned from Draco or if he’d learned from her.
“Fucking Malfoy,” Harry growls, and pads towards the bathroom to shower off the mess he’s left in his pants.
“I still can’t believe you actually disappear,” Pansy says, shaking one of the bottles. Florescent lime green.
“You’re so fucking hot,” the stranger said, pushing Malfoy roughly against the opposite wall. “No one else out here.” The words were an invitation.
, Draco thinks and sinks into the soft down of his pillow.  Because it’s certainly not easy. Harry’s temper could scorch the earth. He’s too generous with his good opinion and far too tolerant of the press. He leaves his damp towels on the floor and allows his evil house pet far too much leniency. Sometimes, when Draco leaves for work or visits the manor, Harry looks at him as if he’s afraid he will go forever—as if Draco could ever stop coming back.
Feverish simmers and Draco moves slow, coaxes Harry’s body to the edge of reason and leaves him boneless. Fingers stretching him open. The pressure drives him wild, and Draco is so purposeful about it, so intensely focused. Harry’s mouth is open, the touch both too much and not enough.
They’re both on the ground, tangled up in each other. Voices are calling above them, with words of “You alright mate?” and “Draco, you’re a pustule of infection. You’re all the bad things!” and “Harry! Harry are you hurt? Are you okay?” Harry knows he should answer them, but Draco has opened his eyes too, and is looking at him with apprehension. There is a question lurking that wasn’t there in another universe but is resurfacing in this one. As if Harry’s promises are incompatible with the air they’re breathing now that they’re home.
“That was my objection,” Pansy says, looking at Ron approvingly. “Well spotted, Weasel. Perhaps your use extends beyond the occasional comic timing.”
Pansy’s grin is wicked. “True,” she says, “but I don’t actually care about your choice of venue.” She tucks a strand of orange-kissed hair behind one ear. “If we’re not celebrating your brush with an extended stay in Azkaban, why are we here?”
Ron’s face matches his hair. “Harry! Why didn’t you get food?” he wails. “I can’t take her without food.”
An ominous yowl rends the air, on cue. It’s as if the villainous creature can read his mind (Harry is sure that she’s telepathic. Even though Hermione insists she has no magical properties and reminds Harry that he got her from a
to stay calm, because I need to make a plan and I can’t make a plan when I’m having a panic.” Draco peers up across the table, pleading. “I need someone to help me make a plan.”
“The war is over,” she says. “And this is a pathetic display of violence that you will probably pretend was justice. But at the end of the day, you are really just a mob of angry people attacking an unarmed man.”
“I wonder if they get hot playing that silly game,” Pansy says, tossing her purse and coat on to the sofa.
“So that means that there must be something wrong with this version of me. Because Potter is good, he’s the poster boy for goodness, and he can’t love me. And so it follows—”
“Looks like an ear infection to me, Mr. Trembelt. Take these.” Harry tears the paper from the prescription pad and scratches his name across the bottom. “Twice a day for seven days and then come back to see me.”
Harry doesn’t understand the hows of this request. The parameters of this ancient morality curse are indiscernible and it was all Harry can do to listen to her voice. His magic is warm, humming and itchy, as his skin shifts as the power bursts through. “Home,” he says through a mouthful of stars.
“It’s bizarre really,” Draco says. “He’s a muggle. There’s no reason that he should be able to just spread his wings and
Draco wonders, as he takes the drinks from the barista-turned-late-night-bartender and walks back towards his table.
One good turn, Draco thinks, certainly deserves another, and gives himself up to the universe that could have been but never was.
“Alone,” Draco says, trying not to sound too pleased with himself.  “And I paid with a Credit Card.”
“It’s Saturday, Harry,” Hermione says, reading his face. “I’ve had a Ministry representative reach out to Royal London Hospital and explain that you’ve had an urgent personal emergency and that you will return to your duties very soon.”
“At least it only happens at night.” Pansy words slur a little at the edges; she has her tongue between her teeth and is dabbing at her feet with intense concetration.
Harry swallows hard. Barely hears Dr. Horwood’s barrage of questions. Finds his focus pared down to the single point where green eyes meet grey.
The look that blooms across Pansy’s features is kaleidoscopic—horror and excitement and ravenous for more.
“I should get the healer,” Harry says, releasing him. There will be bruises, he’d held on so tightly.
As soon as the blow lands, Harry knows that it’s fatal. Draco’s anger peels away and reveals the hurt, raw as a wound.
“I’m leaving, Potter,” was what Draco had finally said, because it was the truth for every version of his question. “And I’m never coming back.”
“It’s—” The Auror tightens his jaw, the first hint that there might be feeling beneath the stern visage. “I didn’t expect to be the one to tell you—this was just one of the Malfoy properties that we were dispatched to. You weren’t here and so I—”
The sound that comes out of Draco then could break your heart. A keen and a sob, a sound that wants but is ashamed to want.
The lines of the world start to straighten out. The power lines point perpendicular overhead, ninety-degree angles rushing around corners. It grounds him. Everything settles back into place, firm lines taking shape; around them, the landscape colours itself in. It is a strange gift, to wander until the ground feels solid under his feet and the universes stop blinking in and out of existence.
There must be hundreds of people crowding into the pews. Hundreds and hundreds, and more coming all the time. Draco feels them. Their hatred is thick in the air.
It starts small. Hovering around Draco’s office. For just a couple of hours. Not long. Five days after Draco has disappeared, Harry wanders down to community health and
“Yeah, I’m a bit shit at this,” Harry says, staring at the collection of coffee rings next to Malfoy’s mouse pad. “But I wanted to see you?”
It wasn’t his imagination, or a violent spectre of his desire come back to haunt him. Draco Malfoy is standing in the door, slacks wrinkled, blond hair thick with rain and pressed flat against forehead.
The years that followed his decision, the certainty that he’d come back wrong. It twists in the clean white air.
Bella narrows her pale blue eyes at him, staring straight back out of that horrible squished face. They’d be having some variation of this same battle for the better part of three years.
He’d planned to chart, to hide in the tiny little office that he shares with two other residents and try to get caught up on his documentation. Harry’s feet, it seems, have different ideas. Without much conscious thought, Harry is walking up to the switchboard operator, not thinking about what he’s going to say until he’s right there in front of her.
For half a second, Draco wonders what to do next. Get up, perhaps? But his body is not responding and his eyes feel swollen.
“Not relevant. Anyways, the officer was a bit…rough with me. Long story mercifully short, I landed in A&E and face to face with John.”
No, this was an act of last resort. Draco had expected Potter to come back, would stride purposeful and strong into his shop and interrogate him. At some juncture, perhaps in a moment of heated verbal sparring, he imagined Potter grabbing him by his collars and pulling him close. Draco’d considered this all afternoon, as the glimpse dragged on and on. How Harry’s eyes would flare as anger shifted into something heated. Their lips would crash together and the kiss would be more teeth than tenderness. Draco would match him, Harry would push and he would pull and it would be like it’d always been, but they would fight with their mouths and not their fists, and what a difference that would make.
“You needed it,” says Robertson, shifting away from the windowsill he’d been perusing and leading Harry towards another towering mess of books. “Now, let’s find you some reading materials to assist in your efforts.”
“Yes, well, it turns out he’s more than willing to connect you with all sort of illegal substances.” Pansy wrinkles her nose, but doesn’t say anything.
The universes were bizarre and addictive, dazzling in their unpredictability and glistening in their variation. There were worlds where wings sprouted from his back on the full moon, where Draco transformed the old Black home into a museum, where slow acting death curses flew in the air. And yet, as the threads of the multiverse wove the lines of fate into the fabric of his body, magic stitched to vein, Harry Potter was forever constant.
Draco doesn’t have an answer for that. It’s fortunate, then, that he starts to cough and that his spittle is tinged red. Long fingers rub circles into his back, and Narcissa is behind him, holding him steady.
Everything unzips. The heat of a setting sun, the sway of an empty field, the cloying of gravel and sweat on his forehead. Everything but Draco and Harry knows that this is another part of him that is indivisible.
“Something about…tread softly? Because these are my dreams.” Harry pauses and Draco’s grateful because the Boy Who Lived is misquoting
Her search of the room complete, Pansy steps towards Harry and presses the box into his arms. “Of you,” she says. “They’re all of you.”
Potter is ragged, like a messy draft of the person Draco used to know. His edges are scribbles and there are dark smudges under his eyes.
“Not supposed to want this,” Harry whispers, as his back arches closer to the long lines of Draco’s chest.
“Potter,” Pansy interrupts as if Ron does not exist. She crosses the room and grips him excitedly, gel nails digging into his skin. “We’ve got a plan”
Harry smiles, picturing Malfoy on the balcony, wrapped up in the moonlight, all mystery and pent-up rage, black denim and unknowable tattoos.
Potter’s still talking. Insisting that Draco saved his life at the manor by refusing to identify him. It’s true, but Draco hasn’t told anyone that, and he wants to scream, wants to pin Potter to the ground and force him to explain how the fuck he knows. Who does he think he is, spouting opinions about Draco’s innocence and guilt?
“You just can’t help it can you?” Draco says, and the words are sharpened, aimed to hurt. “You have to save everyone. You can’t just leave well enough alone.”
“Stop it,” Potter says, and his eyes are on fire. His grip is firm and he doesn’t let go. Not when the crowd starts to settle, not when the members of the Wizengamot return, looking grave. Not even when they read the verdict of their deliberations.
“It’s not that,” Draco says, and Harry can’t stop staring, because this isn’t how it’s supposed to be.
Draco pulls his hand back, and all of a sudden he feels a thousand miles away. White socks peek out from under his long legs, and his arms are wrapped around his knees so tightly, Harry’s worried he’ll fly apart.
A&E is on wheels, the kind of night where everything walking through the door is an anomaly, and the department is riding a collective caffeine fix.
In every other universe, Potter could love him. Did love him. Wanted him in a way that broached no argument, that took no questions. That refused to share. In this universe though.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco had said, pushing an unsteady Pansy through the front door. “I know she may appear conventionally attractive. But trust me. This one is more trouble than she’s worth,” and Pansy had cackled into the starlight and they’d stumbled home, arm in shaky arm.
“Save it, Potter,” Pansy snaps from an armchair, her small body swaddled in an enormous jean jacket. She looks so Muggle that Harry struggles to process—she’s got pink elbow patches, for fuck’s sakes. “While you’ve been doddling, we’ve been hard at work.”
“I just—” Harry considers his words for a moment, and then decides that it’s been a strange day all around and that he’s got very little left to lose. “I’ve just had a lot on my mind. Needed a break.”
wrote at length about what could have happened if Harry had gone to meet Draco that fateful night in sixth year. If you haven't read it, I'm so jealous because I would give up a non-vital organ to experience this fic again for the first time. You can read Turn
“Just drink it,” Pansy says, thumping his back and Harry doesn’t have the heart to tell her that doesn’t actually help people who are choking.
The platform is cast in a soft light, the seats and the tile white. “Kings Cross,” he says. “Again.”
, Harry thinks, much later, as he straddles Draco’s hips and the pretences of a universe they both yearned for but never expected to have fade away. “Every single one,” Harry breathes, and lowers himself down, revels in the fullness of it, the way Draco’s eyes flutter closed. There is bliss in the sweat and soft sounds and Draco’s thumbs clinging to his pulse point. Harry lifts his chin to the ceiling, lolls his head back and breathes. The promise turns to air, slipping into his lungs and drowning him in a certainty he’s never known.
“It was like my ears popped,” Draco says, looking up at Pansy, who is hanging on his every word. “Like when you’re flying and you drop too fast, and your ears pop and you can suddenly hear and you had no idea you couldn’t until that very moment. It was like that, but with my whole body.”
“Did you smear blood on my balcony?” Draco drawls as he surveys his surroundings. “That’s practically medieval. Pansy, how did you let this happen?”
“Neither of you have much experience being kind to one another,” Hermione says through a long yawn. “But I think you can salvage this.”
“Draco,” his mother says, and her hands are all over him. Long cool fingers, exploring the parts of him that hurt.
“Are you not familiar with Shakespeare? My my, you must have been quite preoccupied with your criminal activities before landing in my shop.”
“Why do Slytherins have to be so cryptic?” Harry mutters and Bella howls in agreement. The mistress of evil has been curled around Harry’s feet ever since he stumbled back through the floo, box in hand, patted down by Pansy’s assurances that he will understand everything as soon as he watches these memories.
“Why not,” he whispers to the world whizzing beneath his feet. “Why not,” he says and pulls himself up onto the handrail.
“You’re so earnest. Always have been,” Draco says, fixing him with that look. It’s not gentle or kind. It won’t let him go.
“Yeah. That’s me. Harry the resident,” and he knows he sounds like an idiot, but he’s so delighted to be a stranger.
Mike’s got a grin that feels earnest in that I’d-take-you-home-and-feed-you-supper kind of way and for a moment, the person and the patient starts to blur. Harry shakes his head, flips through the chart. Bloodwork, Oxygen levels, and heartrate monitors and still, no one can figure out what’s wrong.
he realizes and what a concept that is—to live a life free from wartime ideology and the pressures of life and death. Seventeen-year-old shoulders were never meant to carry something so heavy, and it’s nice to see a version of himself smiling across the cab of an old truck—even if the American accent makes his skin crawl.
Harry starts, head jerking around. “What are you doing here?” Harry snaps, but it’s a brittle thing.
The early afternoon is tempting, storefronts beckoning in the midday lull. Draco’s neighbourhood is quaint and tries a little too hard at it, but Harry doesn’t mind. There’s an electronics shop that advertises a massive collection of CDs and vinyl records, another that sells stationary—and Harry briefly fantasizes about burning it down, his personal vendetta against muggle pens has grown that strong. Near the end of the lane, right before a stoplight that’s humming red in the dew, is a used bookshop.
“We’re doing it,” he says, waving Ron’s scowl and Hermione’s pinched lips away impatiently. “Tell me what I need to do.”
Draco stands in front of the window, makes stern eye contact with his reflection. “All by myself!” he shrieks, because he’s not singing anymore, and he pushes the high note from his lungs. One hand clutches the curled newspaper, while the other stretches in front of him, raising slowly up from waist to chin. As he belts out the final syllable “ANYMORE!!” his fingers snap into a fist
“Don’t leave,” Harry gasps, stumbling. There has to be something here, some clue to where Draco’s gone, because he can’t be gone again. He can’t.
Robertson, Draco would soon discover, spoke five languages, had a PhD in Literature and Linguistics, and was more interested in the drama of Draco’s company than actually training him to manage a book shop. “I’m don’t care about the minutia of your every day,” Robertson had proclaimed as he conducted Draco’s orientation to the shop. “It’s not complicated. Sell the books, manage the register etcetera!”
Draco wanted to answer, to launch a compelling argument about the dangers of moral relativism, but his teeth had started to chatter.
Pansy shuffles though her purchases until she finds a tub of ice cream and hands the entire thing, plus a spoon, to Draco. “You can come back from that,” Pansy says, returning to the cupboards, into which she is stuffing several cans of beans.
“But I’ve lost him,” Harry says, forgetting where he is and that it is a stranger in front of him. “Draco might be gone forever and it’s my fault.”
“No no! I’m so sorry. I’ve got—bye then!” The sound of her plastic heels clack rapid fire against the hospital tile. If Amber spots Harry in her flight from the office, she doesn’t let on.
“There is more than one crisis worker,” she finally says, as if this should be obvious. “Which one are you looking for?”
“But now,” Hermione soldiers on, “Draco is adrift in the multiverse and we need something that can connect us to him. A link. Something that’s remained consistent in every universe. Probably the thing that he needs to
“This is literally the only universe where Potter can’t—” The table is littered with tiny scraps of paper, a tarot reading of his anxiety. “Where he can’t love me. God, he doesn’t even
Harry looks at the vial and then the time on the mantle. 2:07 pm. The night had melted into morning and then into afternoon and still, Harry hadn’t been able to stop.
. “What is at the centre of your distress?” he asks, not unkindly. “If I were to pare it down, boil all of the dramatics to a single urgent need. What is the X that marks the spot?”
“Oh Harry!” she says. “Why don’t you come through. We’ll have a cup of tea and you can tell us everything.”
“How much rum is in this?” Harry asks, grinning as he tries to find the answer in the aroma coming off the steam.
Bella is curled up in his lap, snuggled into a mangey throw blanket, still strangely affectionate. “Did you hear that?” he asks her, and she opens one massive eyeball lazily. The pounding sounds again, much louder, as if the meaty part of a fist is bashing against his front door, but that’s not possible, because he isn’t expecting anyone—
“Pansy,” Draco says, massaging her shoulders. “I know it’s been a difficult day. Here, let me just put on a nice CD.” Robertson recently taught Draco all of the technical terminology regarding the Boom Box. Draco was alarmed to discover that it wasn’t even the smallest bit explosive.
No one has anything to say to that. “The risks,” Pansy says after a long pause. “We should go over the risks.”
Ron’s sitting at the kitchen table, his long back a U shape as he pours over case files. Dozens of photographs and stray pieces of paper clog every inch of table space. For a moment, Harry’s filled with a twinge of guilt, and longing. This was the future he left behind when Ron joined the force alone. They could’ve been partners, could’ve gone on solving mysteries and chasing down dark wizards for the rest of their working lives. Harry would’ve taken the spot next to him and they would’ve stayed up into the early hours of the morning.
Not-Potter is still staring at his shoes. “That was pretty fucking odd,” he says. “I’m Daniel, by the way. I promise not to use any more one liners if—”
Harry has settled in the middle of the bridge, is staring down at Archway Road intently. His fingers are pressed flat against the stone railing, his knuckles white and flecked with rain. He looks so alone up here, so removed, as the traffic whizzes by and the wizarding world continues on with its horrible bloody struggle. Up here, none of that can touch him.
“Well, it was quite awkward.” There’s a smiley face pressed into a few of the tablets, a garish promise for later. Draco thinks it’s a bit tacky.
“Look at you, more than just a pretty face.” Pansy kicks him under the table while simultaneously downing another shot. One can’t help but admire her coordination. “Come on.”
“I’ve officially noted your complaints, Miss Parkinson. Now, please leave me to my self-destructive behaviours. I would like just one night where I’m not thinking about—yes, I would very much like not to think.”
Age is difficult to obscure in hands. They’re soft with wrinkles and wear. There’s age in his hand, hidden so well in the thundering tones and confident posture.
Back in 1998, Pansy falls in love with Justin Timberlake (we approve, Pans) and Draco takes a ride across the Alaskan Tundra in a pick-up truck with Harry fucking Potter, who's looking at him in a
While Draco is gallivanting across the universes, he discovers that one good turn probably deserves another.
The lines of Malfoy’s neck slip under Harry’s skin. The balcony is a metal cage of wrought iron twisting like cursive. Harry leans against the railing, close to Malfoy.
The wind clattered against the windows, and even though they were sealed up tight, Draco could feel the cold trying to claw its way in.
“Mmm,” Malfoy says, rising from his stool and bending down to collect Harry’s fallen papers. “Wrap this up by ten and then we’ll go.”
The metaphors dance with the dust motes, but the questions are as irresistible as the shop had been. “It’s…there’s this bloke.”
Potter must have woken up, which is a bit odd—he usually stayed in the car when Draco stood on the edge of oblivion and stared into the distance. Casual dramatics didn’t seem to phase Harry in this universe.
, he’d thought. The wards were ancient, dated back generations, and shouldn’t have succumbed to an angry kick.
Jet black hair is stark against the white light. Draco’s still fixed on Potter, on the way Harry bows his head, as if in prayer.
And Harry can’t lose this. Not again. Not ever again. He’s holding on to Draco, hands shaking as they wrap around Draco’s biceps, because if he lets go he might lose this.
“Touché mental heath worker.” Something companionable settles between them, which is a miraculous development given the context.
Smooth skin, sweaty and heavy. Hands that searched and touched him just there. How Draco had pressed him into the sheets, had moved so slow at first, so careful. Until he wasn’t and Harry had arched into it, had begged—
Whatever confession Potter was gearing up to, Draco was suddenly sure that he did not want to hear it.
“All by myself!” The notes are impossible to hit if you’re not Celine, but he doesn’t care. “Don’t wanna be ALL BY MYSELF!”
Draco raises one eyebrow. “You didn’t give me much time to prepare for visitors,” Draco shuffles a bit closer. He’s wearing slippers, Harry realizes, and a jolt of fondness stabs like a headache behind his eyes.
It’s a futile exercise, really. Draco knows that he’s still the same person who had called Hermione Granger a Mudblood, the same person who had let the death eaters into Hogwarts. Rubbing shoulders with Muggles hadn’t erased that. His cells were still the same. His parts hadn’t been changed out. The ugliness was still there.
Ron pushes his way into their circle of scheming—not one to be left out—to peer at the page. “Wait. That’s not—” He gives Hermione a skeptical look. “That’s not how summoning charms usually work, Mione. Harry struggled to summon his broom from across Hogwarts. How is he going to pull someone out of another fucking universe?”
“So, you’ll dream of him and that will establish a link. We’re hoping it’s strong enough that we can perform this variation of a summoning charm.” Hermione is holding a heavy purple book, gold letters peeling on the spine.
, Harry thinks and then shudders in spite of himself. Drilling directly into a bone has always given him pause.
The IV cart is screeching and the violent sound of alarms crack the hum of the department. Harry glances at the numbers wriggling across the screen.
No matter what he does now, the facts will remain the same. Draco is almost certainly going to Azkaban. It’s strange, to know what’s coming. His trial is tomorrow and there is precisely zero chance that he avoids a prison sentence. Not a single death eater has been spared what the public at large are calling
There was nothing more dangerous, Harry thought, than Hermione when she decided she was going to figure something out. Her brain could bend the world.
For a moment, Draco and Narcissa stand and stare. Gringotts shines white on the horizon. It feels so far.
“What did you get?” Hermione asks, back on the rug, feet up on the coffee table. Harry instinctively knows that Draco would be scandalized on his furniture’s behalf, but Pansy doesn’t give a whit. “Will it be of any help?”
All of the pretences fall from his face and Draco watches himself in the mirror, dressed in the finest robes money can buy, his feelings naked for Harry to see. He slips a possessive arm around Harry’s waist.
“That was rude?” Harry thinks out loud, and starts to track a path across the labyrinth of Royal London Hospital.
Mouth a thin line, Harry moves towards the mirror. “You know,” Harry says, voice warm, flavours of want and affection twisting in the vowels. “I think I prefer a suit to dress robes.”
“I’m the pinnacle of class and decorum,” Draco says, and snaps his wine from Harry’s loose fingers. “I am the reference point against which all grace should be judged.”
she says, stepping towards him on the platform. Her hair was blonde-white, or was it red? Every angle cast a different face, and Harry couldn’t pin her down.
he thinks, to assume that Draco was going to stick to his side all night. Malfoy isn’t his babysitter. It was fine, really. He can leave whenever he wants.
, is all Draco had thought. He’d been viewing Potter in different angles of profile. Harry’s fulll face focused entirely on him now, so intent, so close—
“I miss…” Malfoy closes his eyes and Harry can see the synthetic light in his eyelashes. They’re faint. Lovely. “The peacocks,” he says, finally.
Draco shrugs, breathing into his tea. He hasn’t removed his hand. Circle after circle, like a balm, as if that point of contact will hold this moment together. “You’ve been kind to me. Like when you spoke at my trial. I thought you hated me, and then there you were.”
“Don’t,” Draco says, weary. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to stop apologizing if you do. So please…just don’t.”
“What are you playing at!” Draco’s yelling but against the noise all around them, it hardly registers.
The idea had been Hermione’s. “Muggles have cured all sorts of things we haven’t. And their pharmaceuticals work in places where potions just can’t compare.” Harry agreed, and it was why he was here. In one of the few ERs with integrated ties to the Ministry.
“Thanks,” Harry says, taking the clipboard and trying for a smile. It’s a catastrophic failure at cheeriness.
“—idiot. Stop inflating your ego and start telling me about this curse. Are you sure that it even took? Have you seen one of these…universes?”
“I think I might want to make love to your pen,” Harry says, watching how smooth the ink looks coming out of the tip.
“My life is depressing,” Harry says, and Bella yowls in response. “And that’s enough out of you,” Harry says to the squished face that pops up onto the counter. Giant blue eyes watch him—judge him.
“They’re all…” The words are a pound of flesh that he’s not ready to pay. “They’re all going to see.”
“Don’t mistake the cocoa as kindness, Potter. If your pitiful little story doesn’t end with a detailed description of where you’ve taken Draco—”
“Yes, I think we can pull him out,” Hermione says as Harry drifts out of semi-consciousness and back into Draco’s living room. “It would be old magic. A summoning spell. It’s practically Pagan, but I think we can manage with the right preparation.”
Shacklebolt had owled him every day for two months. Reporters published front page spreads on everything from his takeout preferences (greasy), his love life (shambles, since Ginny’s left), and his political affiliations (unknown).
Narcissa approaches the heavy gate announcing the entrance to the Malfoy ancestral holdings, and it swings open to greet her.
“Uh, yeah?” Harry has no idea where this is going, but thinks it’s better than where he started. “Hermione made me get one. In case I got lost of forget something or didn’t remember the Muggle medical intervention.”
“No,” he gasps. “I’m fine—I—I just—Draco, you’re vicious. You—scared that woman. You should’ve seen her face—” Harry knows he’s being ridiculous. Draco’s face tells him exactly how unimpressive he’s being. But it’s as if a damn has burst and five years’ worth of laughter is rushing out. “You terrified—she was running—actually running—”
The memory of it mingles with the last dregs of a dream. Five years was a long time. Five years ago, Malfoy had levelled him with a look that bled loathing and said, “
“Help?” Draco’s shrill and reeling. “How! How does forcing me to see her like that, to have to choose to end—No. You don’t get to pretend this wasn’t your fault.”
“I’ll help you.” Hermione had smiled then, and for a second, the world flickered into colour. “He called me a Mud—a nasty slur and he stomped on your face and he poisoned Ron.”
“I’m fine,” Draco says, staring down at his next bad decision and first foray into mind altering substances. Robertson would have cause to call him a deviant now.
At first, Harry thinks he’s gone to the loo. Or maybe to find another bottle. But he doesn’t come back and a strange irritation itches under Harry’s skin.
Eventually, over a lunch where Hermione ate and Harry lay on his kitchen floor, he said, “I’m a warm body without a soul, Hermione,” and hadn’t had to say anything else because Hermione had understood.
“If this isn’t life or death, I will spell you flaccid,” Hermione says, rubbing her eyes, not realizing that Harry’s head hovering in the flames beneath their mantle until he snorts with laughter.
“I’m many things, Potter,” Malfoy says, eyes still closed, lips barely moving. “But nice? I don’t think so.”
The living room drifts out of focus as Hermione explains how it could all go wrong and Harry could get stuck and never be able to return to this world. Harry barely hears her, isn’t concerned about consequences because he knows he’s going to do it. That it wouldn’t matter what they suggested, because he would do anything to get Draco back.
Draco sighs. The fastest way to the end of any conversation with Robertson is honesty. “It wasn’t the date,” he says, searching through the junk drawer under the register for a plaster or a stray piece of tissue. “That wasn’t great, but it’s…there’s someone else.”
It's 1998, and Draco learns a bit about Shakespearian tragedy, scores a set of digits, and attempts to match the vocal talents of the untouchable Celine Dion (you were doomed from the start, Draco. No one can touch this French Canadian goddess).
The manor wouldn’t recover from the war—not now. It was grandiose in the way that old buildings tended to be, even after they’ve been gutted and damaged. When they’d moved the bodies from the basement, Draco had assumed that the violence was over. There would never be peacocks again, Draco knew that now. Azkaban had been a one-way trip for father, and his mother—there were no peacocks for her now.
“Fuck you.” There it is. Anger stirs behind those green fucking eyes and Draco almost groans with relief.
“And you love me for it. Now stop obsessing over how perfect Potter was and how evil you were. You know it’s not that simple.”
“Right,” Hermione says, voice brittle with confidence. “Harry, you stay there. I’m going to cast a gentle sleeping charm. Just enough to put you just beneath the surface.”
The heavy glass door swings shut and Harry’s safely back in the street. “What a strange man,” Harry mutters. His arms too full for takeaway, Harry heads back in the direction of Draco’s flat. The magic from earlier has melted away, and the streets look dull rather than dappled. Still, the weight in his arms feels significant somehow, and Harry can’t quite bring himself to regret it—no matter how loudly his stomach growls.
The weight of what this means—that Draco is lost in the far flung regions of another universe and that Harry has no way to find him—pushes through his anger, and then his panic. Eyes watering and itchy with sleep, Harry yawns, the truth still crushing his thoughts, his lungs. “All that’ll be left are the dreams,” Harry says, words coming out scrambled. All he wants now is to crawl back into a world where Draco was his and he didn’t care if it was when he was asleep or awake.
“I can’t see how you will ever deserve him,” Robertson says, hand still outstretched with a few coins, a bit dazed. “Even felons need love too, you see.”
“Go to him with the words of your betters,” Robertson says, finally. “Do not enter battle empty handed. Bring the wisdom of philosophers and the whimsy of poets.”
“But why?” he asks Ropson—that was the Auror’s name. Ropson. The question was loose and confused, as if he were asking after a family friend or a public figure. “Why?”
“I’m going to take you to bed,” Draco says, and Harry’s in his pants and a single sock, somehow, and he knows he doesn’t stand a chance. That he was lost the moment he apparated away from those restless automatic doors.
There is a moment’s hesitation, a half second where he shudders at the idea of touching her, and lord old prejudices die hard, don’t they? Teeth gritted, Draco takes her hand and Granger pulls him to his feet. Her brown eyes are still bristling with suppressed rage and Draco isn’t sure if it’s directed at him.
The cracked tile of Grimmauld sags around him, mould creeping in the caulking, faucet sniffling into the sink. Harry’s not sure why he thought that his kitchen would feel less empty. Grimmauld has never warmed to him, as if the transfer of ownership resisted, refused to take.
Harry opens his mouth to protest, to say that he was supposed to be updating Hermione and not some Slytherin-turned-Muggle fanatic, but Pansy beats him to it.
Usually, the spell would localize, find the relevant part of the body and offer a colourful depiction of the harms done and the damage that needed fixing. Black, though, only meant one thing.
The part of Harry that functions like an adult human being on a day-to-day basis starts to wonder what time it is, what day of the week. “Shouldn’t you be at work?” he asks, trying to ignore the Pansy Parkinson shaped elephant in the room.
“Harry Potter,” Malfoy says, and Harry feels himself shrink, tries to hide, feels his hand go limp. The skin suit that is Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived feels like ants scrambling across muscle.
“Cocoa?” Harry says, tugging at one of the fleece throws on the back of the couch cushions. It smells like Draco.
“You didn’t tell me,” Draco says, glancing at his mother’s kindness, which is now splayed across the end table in close ups of hardwood floors and breezy windows.
John sits up, leans forward, a little further into Draco’s space. “No. It’s not. But nothing will change what you did. No matter how much you wish for it.” John pauses grinning. “Here’s the one and only piece of advise I’ve got for you. Take note, you grumpy twat.”
“You’re being borderline offensive. You know that?” Harry said, still blushing. Still vaguely upset.
Pansy snorts. “You’ve been cagey as a Hufflepuff with a hidden agenda since we walked in. You,” Pansy says, poking him in the chest, “have a secret. So spill.”
Harry tries to banish the memory, shudders as a fresh wave of guilt rises like bile. “Uh—Okay. Something else.”
All of Daniel’s features are twisted in confusion, but he gives Draco a little wave and turns to face Robertson, who is still holding his cabbage.
“We will get through this,” Pansy had said, squeezing his hand as they left Malfoy Manor behind—Pansy had made arrangements for a caretaker until Draco chose to return. “We’ll be okay.”
“Well, yes. All good ideas come from me. But still,” Pansy shivers, and while it could’ve been the cold October wind, Harry knows it isn’t.
The halls were silent, the portraits had fled from their frames. Everything was quiet and Harry realized that, whatever had happened, he was too late.
Malfoy raises the wine bottle in greeting, fingers still wrapped around the neck; he doesn’t let go of Harry.
“Draco!” Robertson returns from the backrooms in a burst of energy, still cradling his cabbage with tender loving care. “Are you fraternizing with the customers?”
In another world, Harry reaches out. In another universe, he makes words that stitch rather than tear.  Here, though, as Draco walks out of his life, Harry watches him go.
“Is she always like this?” Pansy asks conspiratorially, and for a moment, Harry feels like he’s been given a glimpse of what friendship could be like with Pansy Parkinson.
“Tell Potter he can stop breaking things,” Ropson says as one of the Aurors looks up at the sound of their feet on the tile. “I’ve found him.”
, he thinks. “And you could just leave and I’d be stuck feeling like this. And you’d be gone again.”
It’s been five years chasing the ghost of a snitch he’d never hoped to catch and here Harry is, at an anticlimax.
Brown curls mingle with Pansy’s black hair. Halter-top has her hands all over Pansy’s leather tank top, has dropped down to taste the skin on Pansy’s neck. Draco reaches out, takes one of Pansy’s sweaty hands, shoots her a questioning look. “Having fun?” he yells over the din.
An ugly laugh rushes out of him, the edges made of razor blades. It hurts, to laugh right now. “Just stop, Malfoy. You realized it was a mistake. You freaked out. You panicked. Whatever.” It wasn’t
Draco knows that face, as well as he knows his own. And so Draco knows, as he looks at Harry, that there is something different in this world. Something far too similar to the universe that Draco already lives in.
“I thought we were celebrating your escape from Ministry clutches,” Pansy says, sipping her cooler. “Not criticizing my
The feelings froth and bottleneck and somehow, their bodies have figured it out. Forgiveness and desire overflow.
Confused clicks into comprehension and Harry says, “Draco.” Places his hands on Draco’s shoulders and turns him, gently. “I want them to.”
“Draco hasn’t died. Not that we know of,” Hermione says, pushing past the memory. “So, it shouldn’t…it should be different. If the summoning spell does what we hope it will, you should be stepping into the other universe and bringing Draco back. Not dragging someone to a plane where they no longer belong, but returning someone to where they’re meant to be? It’s a subtle difference, but an important one, I think.”
On a balcony ensconced in wrought iron, above him as they moved together in the half light of an hour so late that it was early, and finally in the middle of a hurried emergency room, where the only thing in the world that mattered was pared down to the single point where green eyes met grey.
It was fine, Harry tells himself after apparating home to Grimmauld. Fine, he thinks as he feeds his evil cat, who had shredded the cabbage he’d left out on the countertop. It was totally fine, he thinks as he pulls on a pair of joggers and his running shoes.
Draco slips the white filter between his lips and lifts the flame of his lighter to the tip. “Yes well,” he says, taking a deep breath in. “I had a fairly traumatic interaction with the Muggle mental health care system and decided that I wanted to be a part of it.” Draco breathes out, and smoke spills from the corners of his mouth.
“I’m sorry to intrude,” the man says and takes a step closer and Draco holds his ground, keep himself close to the exit. “There’s been an incident. Of some urgency.”
“What is that supposed to mean!” Harry says, gesticulating so wildly that the rum drink is sloshing over. “What fucking universes?”
“You were lonely,” Hermione said, kissing him on the cheek. She came for lunch twice a week. Always had since the war. Harry depended on it. “You needed someone to take care of.”
“I shouldn’t have said any of that shit.” The words feel like an epilogue that he’s not ready to write, but he presses on. “I didn’t mean half of it.”
“I’m actually quite experienced with bizarre behaviours. Case in point,” Draco says, gesturing towards the back room, where Robertson is probably still quoting Elizabethan playwrights. “My employer monologuing to a cabbage.”
Draco finds Harry’s eyes and stares, not casual or polite. That look is what it’s always been: it’s intense and demanding, it’s animosity and gravity, it’s an obsession that finally tipped into pleasure. Draco stares as he pulls his shirt over his head. Keeps staring as he nudges Harry’s knees apart. His hands roam across Harry’s ribs and he’s still staring.
Harry nods, breathes deeply as he lights a match and presses it to the first bundle, laying it gently in the centre of their messy rendition of a summoning charm so ancient that there’s no trace of wand work. The smoke billows across his cheeks.
Draco hates how calm the words are, when he feels hot all over. Potter, in his stupid shaggy jeans and a shirt that hangs like a tent flap. And he’s just staring at Draco without any of the fire that used to be there.
“You’re not alright,” Draco says, a statement rather than a pointless question. He takes one tentative step into the room, watching Harry like he’s something wild.
Harry ignores him because the idea of being close to someone—no, to Draco—is the only thing he wants. To lose himself in something that doesn’t hurt.
“You know,” Harry says, pushing through the regret and pulling a ballpoint pen from his pocket. “I thought I would miss cleaning spells the most.”
“Thank Merlin,” Potter says. There’s a touch of mania in his voice and it’s so stark a difference from the relaxed posture and easy silences of this world that it startles Draco.
cleaved Draco in two. There is one version of him, the one that accepts Ropson’s side-along, that moves through the halls of St. Mungo’s. This version is calm, polite, is a shell encasing the shock. Draco watches himself, moving through the world as if underwater.
Mike’s wife Frieda is rubbing soothing circles into his back while bloody vomit pours from his lips. Forty years of marriage, with three kids and eight grandkids. Harry knew all of this. Details tended to filter through the breaks in the trauma and crisis—the last bits of the night, coloured in “You still don’t know what’s wrong with him?” she asks, calm in the way that matriarchs tend to be—straight-backed and strong in the face of a tragedy.
The words swim on the screen and Harry has no idea what to make of them. Text messages offer very little context, Harry thinks. It’s impossible to tell if Malfoy is being playful or nasty.
There’s something cheeky in Pansy’s expression as she talks to the barista-bartender, something far too innocent in her eyes as she returns with a glass of red for Hermione, a Bacardi Breezer for Ron, and a hot cocoa for Harry.
“You landed pretty hard, I heard,” a voice says, but Draco has no time for anyone else. Not now. Not when his head is has decided to go supernova.
“He came back from the dead! A perfect person who was noble and good in the face of impossible odds. He sacrificed himself for the whole world—”
Curses fly overhead, but all Draco can think about is skulls and snakes. Bile in his throat, he looks down at his clothes and nearly sobs in relief. His robes are forest green and his arm is clear. Unmarked.
“Aren’t there assessments?” Draco waves his hand, as if conjuring the paperwork he’d expected to see. “
Narcissa had wrapped her thin arms around him; it was an unconventional pose for a side along, but Draco leaned into it.
“No,” Draco says. Panic seethes in his guts. The Potter in this universe didn’t sound like that. These are not the words of the worn out Auror who’d wandered into the passenger side, agreeable to several uncomfortable hours in a moderately priced automobile. This is—that’s his—it sounds like—
“No one does a Power Ballad quite like you,” Draco says as Celine’s voice fills the flat. It’s soothing, in the way that only strong French Canadian vocal cords can be.
“And then we—when we—” Harry can’t say it. Shame is sticky on his tongue. “I told you not to leave.” It hurts. This all hurts.
“No, Draco. I’ve inquired about all alternative options,” Narcissa said. “I know how distasteful wizarding society finds our family. I would have avoided this were it possible.”
“Where did you even find that thing?” Pansy tries to sound haughty, but she gives the Boom Box a wide berth.  Neither she nor Draco know what kind of
“Maybe,” brunette says and Pansy looks hungry. The girl’s halter-top leaves little to the imagination, and Pansy looks ready to take hold of the her long curly hair and twist it between her fingers.
Draco gulps, so desperate for air that he doesn’t think, just swallows a mouthful of dust, and starts to hack.
Beneath the excited voices of two clever witches on the verge of a breakthrough, Harry remembers the way that Draco had looked at him
It seems a reasonable conclusion to think that he is stuck in some other world, that the curse dropped him somewhere on their way back and hasn’t yet noticed that she lost her passenger.
“I’m very good,” she says, giving him a wicked grin and Harry decides that he’s going to like maybe-Megan. “IV’s in.”
“Right. The curse I cast may or may not open up the…uh…the multi-verse? Plunging me headlong into different various worlds, wherein I live as myself until the curse decides it’s done with me and sends me home again. It’s no big deal.”
It’s been a long day and Draco finds he has very few fucks left to give—certainly none for rude Aur— “Police officer!” Draco snaps his fingers, and feels his balance lurch. “That’s what you idiots are called. Police officers.” Draco’s so pleased with his excellent memory that he barely notices the officer charging forwards.
“Have you thought of healing?” Hermione had said, and it was an offhanded comment. Not one meant to land or said with much intention. Hermione was desperate to get Harry off the couch and Harry was catatonic most of the time. Neither of them had expected it to take.
“You’re depressed, Harry,” Hermione had said, pushing a mound of takeaway containers onto the floor and settling next to him.
Self-loathing curls tight in Harry guts. Because he likes the dreams. Which was something he could deal with—privately, in the shower and under the covers, where no one else could see.
was a wound that would never heal, penance that Draco would carry for the rest of his life, because happy endings were earned.  In this universe, Draco knew, the door to this one possibility (at least with Potter) was closed.
“So easy,” Harry whispers to the sloshing reheated sludge in his cup. “I wouldn’t even need a wand.” These days, Harry could manage most of his healing spells wandless.
It was easy enough, to joke about how terrible he’d been. Pansy was a good sort, and would tease him until he felt normal again.
“Draco, your coat,” Harry said, reaching for a lumpy thing that was far too hideous to be a coat. But Draco was already tugging at the ancient metal handle. He didn’t need a coat. He needed to get out—
is the first thing Draco thinks, until his body realizes he’s woken up and then decides to make it’s complaints known. Every inch aches, like stony knuckles have kneaded him until he’s nothing but bruises.
Draco hadn’t known how to interpret the question. How deeply did Harry Potter wonder about the trajectory of his life? Hours, days, years?
“Right,” Granger says, striding down Diagon with the confidence of someone who has saved the world. “Follow me, then.”
Those tight knuckles release and Draco flexes his fingers. “You’re a horrible host,” he says, brushing rain from his shoulders. “Can we sit?”
John laughs and it’s such a full sound—as if he’s got goodness to give away. “You’re here because you were tight rope walking Archway Bridge and maybe thinking about killing yourself? At least, that’s what the officer said when he dumped you in the waiting room.”
He wants to argue, but knows that, with Pansy, there’s no point. So he deflects. “I can’t stop looking at your hair,” Draco says instead, and it’s true. Pansy’s hair is a jet-black bob, except for the last half inch or so—which appears to have been dipped in bleach.
Now that he’s closer to her, Harry notices how exhausted she looks—her dark hair is greasy and pulled into a high ponytail and her face looks strained, as if something dreadful has taken her by the seams and just stretched her like cellophane. Harry wonders if they’re still close, Draco and Pansy. They live together, so it seems likely.
“Wow,” Harry breathes, overwhelmed with the intensity of the place. “Just…wow.” Careful not to tread on the pages, Harry wanders the maze, breathing. Just breathing.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Ron explodes onto the scene a few hours later, covered in dirt and someone else’s blood. At some point during the morning, Hermione had sent a Patronus with the address and a short explanation that Ron was currently calling, “Needlessly cryptic, Mione!”
The curse had tugged him loose from a pile of sweaty limbs and cloudy breaths stuck against the windows.
“The trouble won’t be the spell. It will be…” Hermione pauses, searching for the simplest explanation. “It will be knowing where to aim the spell. The multi-verse is a fairly big place.”
Forty-five minutes later, Harry stands in front of the ancient register, his arms laden with, “the words of your betters,” Robertson insists. With a flourish that any wizard would envy, Robertson stacks Walt Whitman’s
“It shouldn’t be like this!” The anger is unexpected but Harry’s been on a knife’s edge all day. “We could save so many people and it would be easy! It would be so easy.” The mug is burning his palms but Harry barely feels it. “It’s like the war, just a quieter kind of hate. We don’t look at them, don’t see them, and so it’s alright if they die from heart complications or kidney failure or lymphoma and who cares, because they’re not magic and so it doesn’t matter.”
, Draco’d said a lifetime ago. Sorrys would send them stumbling down a cliff of regret that only turned their past into a bottomless pit. It was pointless. “I’m sorry,” Harry finishes anyway.
Six shots of tequila later, the overhead speaker system stutters to a stop, cutting off the most recent Lord of the Rings soundtrack that had been humming through the café.
“She does. I’m not sure why you can’t seem to grasp this,” Malfoy says. “To her, it’s real. She can see it, hear it, feel it. What you and I see when we look at her is irrelevant. The sensation of a thousand legs touching her, the way it feels when a dozen people won’t stop yelling at her?” The room exists only for Malfoy. “That’s real. Please do not make her into a joke.”
“I don’t want to need you,” Draco says, as he settles into the sheets, and Harry’s transported back in time, in the middle of the Wizengamot and beneath the glare of a thousand angry faces. “But here we are.”
His back pocket vibrates, and he feels a pang of irritation. It’s an undignified interruption, all things considered. Wobbling violently, Draco drags his phone out.
“You’ll need to control that temper, Mr. Potter,” Dr. Horwood says after the balding security guard deposits Harry into the arms of his supervisor. “The sick leave of a fellow hospital employee should not elicit such a reaction.”
“Excuse me,” he panted, but the edges of his vision were black. “Move,” he gasped, because his lungs were desperate for air and he couldn’t breathe.
and Draco must have died, infinite possibilities be dammed, because there was no world in which Harry Potter ever did
But then he’s under again, and he’s drowning in Draco’s open mouth kissing the line of his sternum, stripping his own clothes from Harry’s skin, slow, purposeful.
“Fuck a witch’s tit!” Draco yelped as the cold air bleached his skin. Draco needed space from that stupid truck. He could see it now, after tumbling out into the wild. It was bulky and red and looked as if it was carved out of a block of metal. The indicator was still blinking.
They’re in the lobby, Draco realizes, in a corner near the coat check. No one’s seen them. No eyes are looking. The doorway to the ballroom where the celebration will take place is just up ahead at the top of a set of stairs. Two double doors are flung open, towering twenty feet tall and surrounded by fairy lights floating in the air. Laughter drifts up and out, washing the entranceway in the promise of company.
When Dark-Haired-Not-Potter had slipped up behind him, Draco had taken one look at his face and known what the stranger wanted. Understood it in a way that was so much simpler than everything else in his stupid life.
Draco has had some strange entrances into other universes—he once nearly bled out on Harry Potter’s doorstep. It was always a little disorienting at first, but Draco’s improved at finding his bearings. He’s proud of his new ability to react on the spot.
Draco let himself be led—hadn’t he always?—until he’s looked up. And then he’d stopped, arms bare against the elements.
“I’m not sure what you want me to say,” she says, glowering at him. “I really shouldn’t be giving out personal information about employees, but after I told Draco about that first time you asked after him—”
Harry is pining in 2003, Draco has decided to emulate Harry's stalker-esque behaviours (I know, right? Bad form, Draco) and everything comes to a head after a late shift in Emergency...
“I love you too,” Draco whispers, when he thinks no one’s watching. And this is his Draco, Harry remembers. “I love you too,” Draco says again, and Harry believes him.
There’s a light at the top of the stairs, and Draco sees the shadows first. Dark blunted angles, of hair that refuses to sit flat. The light hits his face and Draco really should have known.
“I found an old spell in one of great great uncle Cassius’s journals. It’s a family spell, I think, but it wasn’t copied into any of our official ledgers.”
They fold back into the house, slipping from room to room. Draco moves between groups, chattering nonsense. At some point, he presses a drink into Harry’s hands. The world feels pliable, off kilter.
Memories of not-Potter’s face when Draco had asked if he could look under the hood of the car come rushing back. “Horrific, thank you for asking.”
“The curse!” Draco’s not sure why he’s having this conversation now. “She says I have to fix it. Or that the other universes will…” He tries to gulp the truth back down, but it’s like bile in his throat. It needs out. “They’ll pare me away to nothing.”
It was a small gesture. One that Harry has replayed in his pensieve more times than he can count. They were halfway through the back door when Malfoy had reached for the stranger’s hand. A simple thing. Tender. Almost intimate.
“Have you lost the ability to speak?” Draco’s voice snipes at him. “I’ll admit, I thought that your intellect would have increased somewhat considering that you’re a Healer now?”
“Someone told me…to come to you with the words of my betters?” A tiny grin crooks the corner of Harry’s lip. “To come with poets and other people with nice words.”
Draco shrugs. “I’m struggling to see how it matters, whether I snort myself into oblivion or take a hundred of these bloody things or just sit in my flat alone like a good little boy,”
All the while, the sound goes on and on. The scream of the dead rasps quiet, bouncing off the industrial tile.
Draco laughs in spite of himself. What a delight to work in a place where the name Harry Potter doesn’t produce instant recognition. “Someone I will never have. Not in this universe anyway.”
“I can’t decide what’s more unlikely,” Pansy says, nose scrunched in concertation, dabbing at her baby toe. “You dancing burlesque or Potter loving you.”
It all moves so quickly across Draco’s face—the agony and desire, the disbelief and finally the hope, a determined shade of red in his cheeks.
“Oh.” John wasn’t dropping it. Insisted on highlighting Draco’s shame. “I don’t know what gave you that idea.”
Draco strips his coat from his damp shoulders, drapes it across the back of the sofa, and strides towards his sound system; he’s upgraded in recent weeks. Tall speakers sit in the corners of his living space, connected to a large CD player. It had taken the better part of a weekend, in which he had nearly spooned Pansy’s eyeballs out with his kitchenware, but he’d managed to put the entire contraption together himself. Draco is quite proud of this.
Harry lingers in the shower long after he’s finished washing. As steam chokes the air, Harry breathes deep into the damp, lets the water pressure pound his shoulders.
“Well, I am formally declaring this a terrible idea,” Pansy says, settling down and crossing her legs in front of Draco and his multi-coloured drugs. She gives one of the tablets a gentle sniff. “I want that on the record.”
“It would have been quite taboo, what with him being a man and a death eater,” Hermione had said. “Bad boys seem to be your type. And he’s always been a bit of a bad boy.”
“So,” Ron says, blowing steam off the cup Hermione hands him. “Have you…?” Ron has the audacity to wink at him.
It’s not that Draco wanted to marry Potter. Make violent love to him? Maybe. Wrap him up in warm blankets and push his hair back from his forehead and whisper sweet nothings into his ear? Perhaps. But marriage? That, Draco thought, was a step too far.
It wasn’t like Harry hadn’t tried to go to parties. In those early days, in the student housing next to St. Mungos, Harry had forced himself to leave the mouldy comfort of Grimmauld. To drink piss poor beer and shoot clear liquid from chipped shot glasses and try to slip into student life like he wasn’t anyone special. Like he didn’t matter at all.
“I entered the mental health consult a while ago. The counsellor’s almost finished with the suicidal ideation in Room 5.”
This was initially not a chapter; it's more of a deleted scene, if I'm being honest. It's barely 400 words, but I decided to include as a small stop-over before the next entry in this story. I promise you will not have to wait any extra time for another full chapter—that will be posted tomorrow <3
“Do you have any idea?” Draco says, rolling against him. Friction has never felt so vital, so gloriously fucking perfect.
“This was a stupid idea.” Harry kicked the heavy gate for emphasis and then squealed as pain shot through his foot. “Fuck!”
And what fury. Draco’s swallowed Fiendfyre whole. It roars inside of him, an urgent need to raze the entire universe to the ground, to set this string of fate alight and watch it burn.
That night, he dreams Draco. Of a light at the top of the stairs, a strange tattoo, and striped pyjamas.
Something tight in his hair, pulling his neck back, forcing his chin up. He’s pulling him closer and Harry goes, he doesn’t mind because then there’s a tongue licking a line up his neck, teeth sharp against his flesh, a mouth at his ear.
“I arranged the purchase in case you wanted to take a break from the…” Narcissa considers her words, “the judgement of the post war reckoning. Until today, I hadn’t thought…I didn’t think…it would be necessary.”
Harry has nothing left and so lets the words fall away. He drifts into sleep with Draco Malfoy wrapped around him and for that tiny slice of his life, and for the first time in forever, everything is alright.
“I’m occasionally quite callous,” Draco says, dabbing the single ply slip of tissue under his eyes. “It’s not one of my better qualities.”
“What kind of spell!” Pansy yelps, far too loud. Several heads turn to look, and for a moment, Pansy seems a touch concerned that she’s breached the International Statute of Secrecy.
On instinct, he’d started to run, tucking Malfoy’s wand under one arm, and he hadn’t stopped until he was at the front entrance, panting and scrubbing melted snow from his face.
Harry accepts the mug because there’s nothing else to do. The ceramic is warm between his hands and Harry readies himself for Pansy’s wrath.
But Draco is already moving slowly towards the boom box, creeping on his tip toes, lest he startle it into explosions. He jabs at the next song button.
Big brown eyes drift open and look up. There’s no recognition behind them, no hero worship or familiarity. It’s why Harry’d wanted to intern here. No one went to pieces or asked for autographs or went to the Prophet if the Chosen One was their healer. “Hey Viola,” Harry whispers, because there’s not time for many more words. “I’m Harry.”
And just as she has in every other moment of crisis, when Draco has felt like the world is without gravity or friction, Pansy is a point of contact holding him steady. “Alright,” she says, blinking rapidly. “You irresponsible, ridiculous, impulsive—
In the end, it had been a bit more complicated than that. Draco had apparated to the manor—he had his wand now—and Minty had met him in the shattered remnants of his front door. It stood like a missing tooth. “Go to your room, Master Draco sir. Go straight to your room until we can finish making this right.” There were Aurors in the ballroom, but Minty pushed him past their blue tape and flashing cameras. “Don’t look, Master Draco. Don’t look.” The sagging skin around Minty’s eyes had been red and swollen.
Harry hears Ron tell him. The laughter boils in his chest, bubbling over and he can’t help himself. Harry barely recognizes the sound, it’s been so long.
“You’ll have to dance, of course,” Pansy says, giving both Draco and Harry one of her most violent looks. “I spent fifteen minutes flirting with that bearded boy. You have no idea how risk averse he is! Insists that the clientele won’t like a girl band.” Given the glares being directed at the cash, Harry thinks Darwin might’ve been onto something. “You owe me.”
It’s cumulative, the pain in his chest. The weight of his mother’s body, lowered into the ground and of the feet kicking him in front of Gringotts, of a thousand futures he will never have and one pair of green eyes that will never look with love. The scars on his chest will never fade and the pitch of his soul will never lighten. And right now, the white lights flying by feel less like dying and more like flying.
“We’ve evaluated her condition,” the healer is saying. “I’m sorry Mr. Malfoy. There’s nothing that we can do.”
“Cop also said you fell, but onto the sidewalk and not into the street a hundred feet below. And that you cracked your head on the way down.”
He’d wanted to wait him out at first. Draco had to come home sometime. It was his flat. But frustration quickly mellowed to shame. If Draco didn’t want him, if he was so averse to the idea of what they’d done that he’d left his own flat rather than face it, well…
Harry finds some bizarre items—scattered bottles of nail varnish in the bathroom, several pairs of spangly heels that set Harry’s mind racing, a collection of colourful scarves in the front closet. Harry finds all of this and more too, but not what he’s looking for.
“If you don’t all leave this instant, I will report each and every one of you to the Ministry and have you brought up on charges of assault, creating a public disturbance, and hate crimes.”
And when Not-Potter had pressed his lips to Draco’s ear and said, “Let’s take this somewhere else,” Draco went. Because the last time he’d thought about his dick was after a jaunt with Potter across the Alaskan Tundra and he needed to wash that down with something else. Tequilla. A cheap Potter knock off. Anything.
“I suppose we could just bleed ourselves,” Pansy had said. “Hang on. I’ll get a knife from the kitchen.”
Potter’s close. It’s uncanny, but Draco can feel Potter’s eyes. He’s always known when Harry Potter was looking at him.
Harry’s never been very good at repairing broken things. Not in life and not in the ongoing battle with his Persian nemesis. He’s had lots of practice—Bella is tetchy when she doesn’t get the food she likes, on time, in her favourite dish (that has little fishes painted on the bottom that Harry had special ordered). He’s lost several ceramics to her displeasure and has still not mastered fixing them. No matter how strong the
Robertson fixes the cabbage with a serious look. “I believe I am. Now, if you’ll excuse me. Solemn introspection on vast philosophical ideals is best processed in private.”
atop the pile. “Make sure you read the Yeats,” Robertson says, holding out Harry’s change, which Harry is wholly incapable of taking, as his hands are filled with books.
The concrete is cold against his skin and Draco wonders what it would feel like, to stand on the ledge between life and death.
Harry sees something in his own face, a little greyer, a little harder, but stilll there. And then hears it in words that are as unlikely as they are inevitable. “I love you,” this other Harry says, and takes Draco to his bed.
“Why else would you stick around, waiting for me to find—” The words are brittle. “To see—” So brittle that they crack.
“I’m in love with Harry Potter,” Draco says and, Merlin, it is such a relief to have the truth said out loud.
It shouldn’t calm him—should have the opposite effect—but Draco is comforted, knowing that the precious Chosen One is nervous too. It makes him feel horribly human.
The clerk’s eyes narrow. “I’m sorry to disturb your—” Harry looks at the pointy metal sticks and gulps.
“Home,” he mumbles, and wakes up in a new universe, legs tangled in sheets that feel familiar. The sterile smell of starched linens and healing salve tugs at his memories. He’s in the hospital wing, Draco realizes.
The upward inflection marked this as a question, and Harry mouths a reply, but the words still won’t come.
Draco slips out of his soft brown boots, leaving them in the puddle of stray shoes in the porch. They follow the noise inside. The house feels like a paper fortune teller—room after room unfolding, and somewhere between the music, the old guitars and warbling feminine voices, Malfoy reaches back and takes Harry’s hand. Like it’s nothing.
Harry rolls his eyes, but his brain has stopped itching for the first time since that impossible moment on the terrace. “Sometimes, I just want to just cast one or two spells. For the cancers they’ve not got figured out yet. Or to regrow organs and save someone months of dialysis. I feel like a failure, like I’m keeping lifesaving treatment from a whole group of people who deserve to be saved.”
“I’m waxing biblical,” Draco says, slipping into a booth. “Have you ever heard about the crucifixion?”
It’s magic at first. A stinging hex blooms across his cheek, something hot blisters up his back. The pain swaddles him and Draco doesn’t resist. For the first time in months, he knows how to handle something. There’d been pain at the manor. So much—
The tears sting; it’s the only reason he knows they’re there. “This is the only world where he can’t love me,” Draco gasps. “He can’t. I’m so awful that he can’t.”
The man grins and it’s cheeky as an ambush behind enemy lines. “I shall call you captain monosyllable.”
A part of Draco had given into the fantasy that Potter had wanted him, had chased that attention to a hot release in a tight fist. In person, though, Draco’d had no delusions when he stared back into those green eyes. It had been loathing, suspicion, hatred. It had never been lust or anything softer. Nothing like love.
“Hmmm.” Hermione’s eyes drift away from Harry, going fuzzy and thoughtful. “I wonder how Malfoy has managed it all these years. Watching people die when he knows they could be saved?”
, because he knows that face, and yet Harry’s answer still buckles his bones. “In every universe,” Harry says.
“He’s probably just gone out for coffee,” Harry says, glancing at the clock on the bedside table for the first time. 4:37 am.
Harry leaves, still short a sock, as seven o’clock turns to eight. Takes one long look at the bedroom and the plants and the sheets, listens one last time for the sound of the front door, for feet on stairs, and then apparates home.
A spot on Harry’s countertop is suddenly very interesting.  “I can’t—” because he couldn’t. This want was too old.
“You think they would be more interested in your Muggle Medical Integration Bill, but no! That won’t drive sales.” Draco scoffs and Harry wants to swallow it, to feel the warmth of Draco’s posh mannerisms heat him from the inside out.
“I was freaking out. Because I—I could,” he whispers. “That’s the part that scared me, I think. That I could,”
. Draco is sure that none of these pale, middle aged Muggles have ever stepped foot in a real dungeon or seen any kind of magic, gathering or otherwise.
Draco’s knuckles look like they’re about to burst through his skin. “I know it looks bad,” Draco says, the words tight through clenched teeth.
Draco doesn’t look at the chair, or the chains hanging limp at his sides. He doesn’t look at the raised seats or the purple robes. He picks a stain on the cool cement floor and forces his eyes to stay put. Looking at it will only make it worse.
Fucking Malfoy, who always knew how to get under his skin and just stay there. Who hadn’t said thank you, who had fled the Ministry after his trial and hadn’t looked back. Until that awful night at St. Mungo’s, when everything had gone wrong—
“Stop being so fucking stubborn!” Draco cracks, his composure shatters like porcelain. “I’m trying to be reasonable, to explain—”
Harry rushes across the room, grabbing at the items on the coffee table. A stack of books, a lighter, a receipt. “Please,” he breathes, and he’s not getting enough air. “Something.” He lunges for the bookshelf, grabs at the titles. There has to be some scrap of Draco left behind.
Draco is leaning against the wall across from him, looking at Harry as if he’s a wild animal that’s escaped the zoo. “What are you doing here?”
Here, Robertson’s words stumble to a halt. There’s a sheen of tears ready to spill over—emotions came so rapidly with Robertson, sunbathing to storms. “Um?” Draco says, inching towards his slightly manic employer. “Sir, are you grappling with your mortality?”
“Torture?” Draco says, wounded. “I’m merely providing you with an education. I’m expanding your cultural palate.”
“She never licks my fingers,” Harry muttered, glaring at his stupid cat. “I can’t believe you convinced me to get a pet.”
“That little card game they play has all kinds of spells, Pans,” Draco says, and watches her shoulders relax. “Besides, it’s less of a spell and more of a curse, as it turns out.”
Draco: Speaking of jobs (and yes, that was me segueing seamlessly via text. Watch and learn, Potter), you’re off for the next two days, are you not?
“Positive affirmations are bullshit,” John says, his face washed out by the hospital lights. “In moments like these, anyway.”
Draco doesn’t know when he lost Pansy. The memories started to blur like watercolour paint as they’d tripped out of the flat and smudged their evening into Muggle London. It’s been hours—Draco can feel the time ticking in the sweat turning cold down his back, the ache in his feet from dancing to the tune of his desperation. At some point, he’d stumbled out of the club, buzzed and dizzy and craving air.
The two nights aren’t all that different. Headlights stampede down below, bright eyes blinking in the dark. A memory of white knuckles and trembling shoulders, of a boy who lived who wanted to die.
The streets of Diagon are bright against the afternoon, sunlight glancing off windowpanes. People are bustling in a way they hadn’t during the war—the world is learning how to move again. Draco swallows hard and resists the urge to take his mother’s hand.
Harry knocks into the end table and the force of his hip sends a decorative wooden box crashing down. It falls face first onto the floor, intricate wooden lines untangling, and Harry’s so upset he barely notices the secrets falling out. Little vials made of glass spill across the hardwood, rolling away in all directions.
One of Draco’s lovely plants falls from the windowsill. It’s upside-down on the ground. Happy leaves blink up at him, soil scattering across the floor.
The Muggle Auror glowers. “There’s two ways this night ends,” he shouts over the sirens, which are still bellowing their displeasure into the night. “With you nice and safe in your bed or with you in a cell. So just step off the fucking ledge.”
