Mrs Spencer tutted sympathetically and Draco silently congratulated himself for the proper pronunciation of ‘electricity’, though he was still lost when it came to understanding what it did exactly. Potter was forever laughing at him when he tried to bring it up claiming that he sounded like a child stumbling over a big word.
Draco moved to a side and Ginny knelt down next to him. Pansy sneered.
“I suppose if Mother is happy…” He gave a shrug.
“A year later, we got married and two years after that, we had James. I was
“We’re having an Easter party at the Burrow.” Al said excitedly.
Potter seemed to take this as an invitation and moved to place hot, open mouthed kisses along the length of Draco’s neck, moving upwards until he came to the particularly sensitive patch of skin behind his ear. Draco shuddered as Potter began to torturously lick the spot before sucking it into his mouth, reducing Draco to a whimpering mess. He found himself rutting helplessly against Potter, not caring if he showed his desperation, his whole body thrumming with desire. Potter ran his hands along the length of Draco’s back until he settled on cupping his arse, pulling him harshly closer and holding him in place as he grinded deliciously back against him.
His aunt paused in her rolling to take a look at the contents of the bowl. “A cup should suffice. You’ve mixed it beautifully Cissy.”
“What, no! No, Malfoy, I
Draco hesitated for a fraction of a second and Pansy pounced like a nundu to the kill.
As a reply, Draco only gives his shoulders a small squeeze before continuing with the massage. Harry frowns, wondering if he’s done anything to piss him off.
great,” Weasley grumbled and then grunted when he got a sharp jab in the ribs from Granger. “Come on, ‘Mione. I’m sure Harry agrees with me, right, mate?”
He jumped into the Floo before Draco could dredge up a retort, his laughter echoing behind him. Draco scowled, following behind with a muttered curse.
Mrs Weasley nodded. “I shall get Arthur to arrange an appointment with Kingsley for the two of us. You can report this incompetent Auror as well.”
“You bet you lily white arse it is!” she replied hotly, poking him hard in the chest. “As you’re friend – and yes, we are friends now, so it’s no use putting up a fuss – I have every right to tell you when you’re doing something that could potentially ruin something beautiful!”
“So you’re still having trouble with that wand,” he began haltingly and Draco rolled his eyes. Could Potter do nothing else but constantly state the obvious? He was starting to seriously question his taste in men.
” He tried to put as much exasperation as he could muster into that one word alone, hoping it would make Potter leave him alone.
Potter looked crestfallen. “I thought you liked me.” He sounded so downtrodden that Draco couldn’t stop himself from patting him on the head. He cursed his weakness but it just seemed like the thing to do in the moment.
Draco looked to where he was pointing and saw his name
“No.” Potter shook his head and his stoic expression softened a little. “Well-groomed and thoughtfully put together, maybe even a little cold at a glance, but make the effort to look further and you’ll notice the hidden warmth and loveliness in every corner.”
“Why are you both bickering when you should be working?” Weasley interjected loudly. “If you can’t resist squabbling, then do it
“You’re still coming back tomorrow though, right?” Potter persisted irritatingly, words jumbling together in his haste to get them out before Draco could step into the Floo.
Potter looked unrepentant, leaning back against the kitchen table with a stupid grin on his face. Draco hadn’t heard the slightest indication of his entry and he cursed Auror training for making Potter even sneakier than he already was.
Draco blinked. “They actually got
“With the library over, you’ll be finished helping me,” Potter continued, oblivious to Draco’s sudden emotional turmoil. “You won’t have to spend your days here anymore.”
“Why.” Al asked innocently.
He led Draco up to the second floor where the library was. As soon as Draco came close to the door, he felt a huge surge of Dark magic, heavy and leaving a bad taste in his mouth. Having lived with a number of abominations, just last year, Draco had grown accustomed to such energies but this one was so strong that for a moment he stumbled.
“Harry –”
Draco also answered in the affirmative and the child practically flew up the path towards the house, shouting to the world that he had the best godfather and cousin in the world. Draco followed at a more sedated pace along with Potter, the brooms over their shoulders.
let alone make a snarky remark?
George laughed again. “It was a joke.” he smirked as Draco flushed again. “Merlin, you’re so serious. Loosen up a bit old chap.”
“You do bring out the worst in me.”
Draco had had
“You’ll have to get used to my friends.”
“Harry…”
“Surrendering on you own terms to prevent a humiliating loss? How very Slytherin of you Potter.” Draco said with a tilt of his head. “Didn’t know you had it in you.”
“I thought you were
“Smart lad.” He finally smiled and Draco relaxed in response to the easy-going grin that now graced Bill’s face. He looked so different from the serious, foreboding man of a few seconds ago and even his scars seemed to be less noticeable. He was pretty attractive actually, and Draco felt his face heat up at this realization. To make matters worse, he suddenly felt a finger stroke the back of his neck and jerked away with a shriek, stumbling straight into Bill’s firm chest.
“Hey, you have to admit that was funny.” Potter raised his hands in surrender, palms facing upwards. “Although, Bob
“Draco, I’m going to play on the seesaw ‘kay?” James said, already making his way to one. Another child was already there and he was willing to use it with James. Once sure that the boys knew what they were doing, Draco turned to Albus.
Draco held out the finished plate to Potter. “Can you take this up? I’ll be with you in a bit, just need to arrange another plate.” What he really needed was some time to pull himself together when he felt like he was splitting at the seams. Potter took the plate but placed it back on the counter.
“All the time.” she answered nonchalantly, and Draco laughed.
“What was all that about taking Ginny out to dinner then?” Draco asked Potter.
“Cissy, keep stirring. We don’t want the mixture to clump.” Aunt Dromeda called from where she was rolling out dough. Teddy was standing beside her, using a template to cut the rolled dough into shapes.
Unable to resist the urge to ruffle Potter’s feathers even more, Draco put an arm around Ginny and allowed her to snuggle up even closer. She smiled blearily up at him before yawning again and closing her eyes. Potter’s face was a veritable thundercloud and Draco hid a satisfied smile behind his glass. It might do Potter some good to fret about for a bit and Draco had always jumped at a chance to get on his nerves. The saying ‘
“Well you seemed a bit– actually,
Draco smiled tightly. “Was there any reason you called for me, Mother? And it’s nice to see you Aunt Dromeda, and Cousin Teddy too.”
They had a bit of a stare off and Draco was the first to break away with a weary sigh.
dramatic.” Draco commented to Lily as he lifted her out of the tub and kept her on the bathroom rug. He gently towelled her off with a dry towel and then wrapped it snugly around her. “Shall I get her into her nightclothes then?” he asked, picking her up.
Potter gave Lily one last appraisal before softly saying “Thank you.”
“Great!” James cheered. “Then you can come with us.”
“Draco Malfoy.” he replied, taking her outstretched hand in a firm handshake. Her lack of reaction to his name told him that she was a Muggle.
Draco smirked. “I continued to harass them as much as I dared. Never anything to cause them real harm, just little things to tick them off. When Lucius was sent to Azkaban, the first thing I did when we came home was find someone to take them off our hands. A collector of rare birds has them now. He offered to pay us but I couldn’t take his money when I was giving him peacocks from hell.”
“Have you two had a pleasant chat?” she asked with an innocence that Draco
“It doesn’t make any sense!” Potter burst out. “He kept falling off his broom and you tell him to
Having spent the day unproductively, it was no surprise that Draco decided to retire early for bed. It didn’t say much about his social life – all but deceased by this point – that he was turning in at eight o’clock on a Friday night, but it wasn’t as if anyone was around to mock him for it anyways. He might have retired earlier too, if it wasn’t for a certain winged menace bent on keeping him up as long as he could.
“I’m in love with Potter.” Draco’s face slackened in shock as he registered the words that had left his mouth, and Pansy and Blaise mirrored his expression. He brought a hand to cover the lower half of his face. “What the fuck?”
Draco stopped and turned to him quizzically. Potter also came off the porch and Draco could finally make out his features in the silver light of the half-moon. His brows were knitted together and he looked anything but happy. “I just wanted to tell you to stop flirting with Ginny. She’s already taken, in case you didn’t know.”
“I just wanted some water actually, but I can get it myself. You should see to the stove.”
Harry does so, keeping his expression as serious as he can. Draco is snuggled up against him in an instance and Harry lowers his arm to rest on his narrow shoulders. It was a surprise, but the fact that Draco’s a shameless cuddler isn’t something Harry complains about.
“That was so cool!” Teddy gushed, hopping about. “If we get enough balloons, can we make Gran’s house fly too?”
“…Greg and Vince would be trying to fish with no success, whilst simultaneously eating all the crackers they’d brought as bait…” Blaise put in.
“He kind of was,” George added unhelpfully and Charlie did not look amused. If looks could kill, there’d have been one less Weasley in the world.
“Would
“Don’t think
“I can’t!” he yelled back. “I can’t cast a bloody Patronus!” He clenched his fist, feeling utterly useless. “I’m not– I can never–” Potter gave a particularly wretched whimper and Draco gagged. At this rate, he was going to sick up right here in the library.
In typical Draco fashion, he’d thrown an enormous hissy fit and had only been somewhat placated when Harry offered to keep back his own wand as well – another decision he greatly regrets now. Harry has a feeling that the cartload of pumpkins is part of a passive-aggressive revenge plan on Draco’s part, but one never
Draco practically climbed over James in his haste to get out of the taxi of death. Potter had wanted to visit a Muggle park that day and in a moment of madness, Draco had been persuaded to take his first ever ride in a Muggle car. Needless to say, he wouldn’t be doing that again anytime soon!
“Please, don’t fight,” Draco moaned, opening his eyes to look at them beseechingly. He didn’t need a pair of bickering lovers added to the shitestorm that was his life.
“Mum, I’m fine,” the Weaslette huffed as she dusted herself off. “I’m
For the rest of the time spent blowing up balloons, Draco steadfastly ignored Potter the best he could. He certainly wasn’t sneaking glances down at him, and if his hand happened to brush against Potter’s hair every now and then, well, it wasn’t done on purpose. Most important of all, Draco was definitely, undoubtedly, most assuredly,
“Is that why he calls you ‘Malfoy’ and not ‘Draco’?” asked James.
James guiltily dropped the Muggle markers he was using to draw slugs on his sister’s cheeks. Teddy managed to grab Hugo before the boy went tumbling out the soon-to-be closed window, and Fred ceased in his hair pulling long enough to throw a small stuffed cat at Louis’ head. It caught him unawares and the can of paint he’d been holding went flying into the air, covering all the nearby children as well as the wall in purple paint.
“This one’s terribly skittish,” Bill laughed. “Wonder if Charlie’ll be able to calm him down.”
A moment of silence passed before Potter spoke up again in a low voice. “You reminded me of my cousin, okay. The way you kept boasting about your father and not making friends with the ‘wrong sort’ and how you were so obviously rich and privileged, you sounded just like him and I didn’t want to have to live with another Dudley. Not after I’d finally gotten away from him.”
“Wanna be set up then, Malfoy?” George goaded. “Charlie’s hardly ever in the country, so I have no idea how he does it, but he seems to know practically every queer bachelor in the kingdom.”
“Draco.” Just his name, and yet it was filled with warning.
Potter dramatically collapsed against a large cage.
Potter’s expression turned thunderous. “Take it then, if you can manage to get the bloody thing off the wall in one piece. I’m sure it’ll look simply lovely back at the Manor.” He returned to the balloons without another word, abruptly bringing the conversation to an end.
look kind of sick. I’m sorry I was late,” he said. “The girl at the shop took forever to get our drinks.”
“What happened?” Fred’s eyes were like saucers.
, but it was a wand nonetheless, and after being without one for more months than he liked to remember, Draco was thankful for it. At least he wasn’t reduced to living as a Squib any longer.
“Stop pushing Lils!”
Potter shook his head. “It’s fine,” he said. “It
Potter picked up his own purple balloon. “They seem tough but once you blow them up, they get really delicate. Don’t inflate them too much, alright, or they’ll pop. Here, let me do one first and then you can follow my example.”
Bob nodded and his smile took on a whimsical quality. “A beautiful name for a beautiful soul.”
“You shouldn’t have provoked the beast in the first place.” Draco continued, gently pouring water over Lily’s head.
“I’m gay,” Draco replied at once, giving Potter a cool look. He refused to ever be ashamed of who he was. “I hope that doesn’t bother you.”
Potter instantly looked apologetic. “I’m sorry, you’re right. I’m acting like a randy teenager.” He stepped forward and took Draco’s hands. “I should take you out to dinner first, at a swanky restaurant. Anywhere you want. We could – ”
“It was last week actually.”
He snapped out of his frantic musings and turned to Luna.
“We can invite Pansy and Blaise over too, if you want,” Harry continues slowly. “She and ‘Mione have apparently become best friends ever since they went shopping together that one time.”
“A real-life tragedy in the making.”
“No, I will
rather creepy.”
“Well they seem to be getting along fine.” Potter said with amusement as he sidled over to Draco. “She’s…different from what I expected, I’ll admit.”
Potter pretended to look aghast. “Are you saying I have a dirty mouth, Malfoy?”
Oh no, the day was going to be much worse.
Completely frustrated with Potter’s outrageous behaviour, Draco took a deep breath through his nose and sent it out harshly into the balloon. Its resistance immediately gave way and Draco blew until he had no more air left in his lungs, and the balloon was as big as his head. He pulled off to give a triumphant crow but unfortunately lost his hold on the balloon in the process and, to his intense mortification, it made a loud and decidedly
“What? Lily fell in a hole?” Potter looked frantic again, and began hurriedly checking her over for injuries. As she was still in Draco’s arms, it brought them into close proximity and Draco got a whiff of gingerbread. He wondered for a moment if Potter had been baking before he’d come after the children, and then wanted to bash his head on a rock for wondering in the first place. It wasn’t as if anything Potter did interested him in the least.
Potter still hadn’t said anything but his eyes were aflame with
Draco levelled a hard look on Weasley and he at least had the sense to look mildly intimidated.
“You did?”
Before Potter could say anything, Lily decided to make herself noticed by springing from her perch on Potter’s shoulders towards him. Luckily his days as a seeker had left him with quick reflexes and he instinctively dropped his bags and caught her, cradling her against his chest. The girl even had the audacity to smile angelically up at him while he was busy trying to get his heart to stop pumping like the Hogwarts Express.
Potter gave a wry smile. “I want Ginny in a good mood, so yeah. There’s er, something I want to speak with her about.”
“Yours, I think.”
“Tomorrow.” Draco didn’t look back as he stepped into the flames.
“Come on, can’t you just admit that I knew something you didn’t?” Draco cajoled recklessly, even though he knew he was this close to making Potter lose his temper.
him – but he still couldn’t quite shake the feeling of guilt that persisted in the recesses of his mind. An active conscience was
“Merlin, Harry. Are you alright?”
Draco exited the bathroom and headed towards Lily’s room, remembering it to be at the end of the hall. Potter had given him a quick tour of the house just before dinner. Draco had been there once as a child but he’d hardly recognized it to be the dank, gloomy Grimmauld Place he known before. Potter had done a wonderful job remodelling and Draco was hoping he could get an invitation for his mother to come see it too.
“Thank you for putting up with all my drama, Mother.”
A strangled sound came out of Draco at George’s outrageous remark and Charlie laughed even harder, bending over and clutching at his flat stomach. Bill gave them both hard thumps to the head.
“He doesn’t need to work either. He has more than enough money to live a life of leisure but he’s never been one to be able to stay in one place for too long. Always so restless.”
“I’m not trying to do anything.” she replied defensively. “Nevertheless,
Bob beamed. “Do come see me again.”
“Mother, it will never happen!”
“Harry, no, we’ll be late,” Draco laughed breathlessly as Harry ignored his whines and continued to shower his neck with kisses. “Salazar, what is with you and my neck?”
“Oh, no the only reason he got to know was because the wife told him herself.”
A hand landed gently on his shoulder and he breathed in deeply before turning. Potter looked back at him with an easy smile, and Draco couldn’t help wishing things were different – simpler. He’d already made up his mind to speak to Potter, but it couldn’t be tonight. He had other matters to tend to and had no intention of ruining Teddy’s party by starting a fight. They’d talk soon but for today, Draco was still Potter’s friend.
“Potter, you have ice cream on your nose.” Draco laughed, handing him a napkin. Potter didn’t take it though, instead sticking out his nose for Draco to wipe it off instead. Only after he’d done it had Draco realized that it had been an oddly domestic act.
Draco sniffed. “Please Ginevra, don’t speak of such blasphemous things.”
Potter stubbornly jutted out his chin. “No.” He tried to do it again and yelped when Draco slapped his hand away.
Potter looked mildly concerned. “Please tell me you didn’t do anything illegal, because in case you didn’t know, I’m an Auror trainee – as in, it’s sort of in the job description to do something if you’re gadding about breaking the law.”
“Even more impressive.” Pansy gave them an approving look in return.
“It’s quite painful actually.”
Sending Potter a wink, he raised his voice. “Well Potter, if Albus won’t come out, I suppose we’ll have to smoke him out the way Mother and I got that pesky rodent out of the broom shed. Do you think the shop owners will be terribly upset when I set fire to their robes?”
“Well, I’ll admit he is rather small,” she allowed, stroking its head gently. “If not a post owl, he can at least serve as a companion.”
“I don’t– I’m not feeling too well, actually,” Draco stammered out, with what he hoped was a believable smile. He couldn’t even
“Running away, are we?” the boy jeered after him, having apparently regained his bravado. “Can’t really expect anything more from cowardly scum like you.”
“Look at that, Draco Malfoy is a softie deep down,” another voice quipped behind him and he turned to see Ginny approaching with Potter, his arm possessively around her shoulders. Draco managed to smile, even while his stomach squirmed in a strange mix of jealousy and guilt.
James seemed to understand this logic and nodded. He held out his hand which Draco solemnly clasped. “Hullo, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Mr James Sirius Potter.”
“Save it, Mother.” He covered his face with a pillow.
Ginny came closer. “Who’s that?”
Draco felt completely humiliated and his next words burst out unthinkingly, loud and sharp as he said, “Well, it’s not like anyone would hire me anyways, what with my track record and all.”
rusty. Sorry, but I felt bad for you.”
Potter looked pensive. “I knew that Luna considered you a friend, but I’d never known you were
After a few quiet minutes of work, Potter seemed to decide that sitting straight was overrated and he brought his legs up to half-lie across the couch and subsequently put himself well within Draco’s personal space. Draco shuffled over to give him more room but Potter just stretched out even more until he was fully reclined and had his head resting on Draco’s thigh.
“From the way he used to dress, you’d never figure Potter was swimming in galleons. It explains how he could afford to get you such an extravagant gift though.”
“Leave him alone. Mum won’t be pleased if she finds you harassing our guest. Or Ginny for that matter.”
George pushed himself off the wall. “I’m a pretty good listener no matter what anyone says. And thank you for sharing it all with me. I think you
“Yeah.” Potter said with a nod. “Gets it from his dad I suppose. Remus was one of the smartest men I’ve ever met, and the kindest.” He sighed. “I try my best but I know I can never be the father that Remus would have been for Teddy.”
The shout brought him out of his stupor and he quickly moved to duck into a nearby alley. Peering out, he looked around as he tried to mentally retrace his steps. They’d been on their way to Flourish and Blotts when he’d had that spell shot at him and then the schoolboy had come along. Come to think of it, Draco thought with a frown, the last time he remembered seeing her had been just as they’d left the Apothecary.
“Well who doesn’t?”
“Goodnight Mother.”
“What will it be sir?” The ticket girl asked politely.
“Yes. Dangerous,” Ginny echoed fervently, nodding her head. “Don’t want to die just yet. And besides, I have… something to do tomorrow.”
that?!”
“Not so fast, you little bugger.”
“It gave one of the most terrifying shrieks I’d ever heard before. I’d been turning to smile at the rest of the class but quickly turned back when I heard it. And the hippogriff was
on him?” she shrieked.
“Pansy would like to borrow it if you don’t mind. Shall I send it by owl tonight?”
“My arse aside, Potter can’t do this to Ginny,” Draco snapped. “I don’t care if I’ve fallen for him, he needs to back the fuck off.”
a boyfriend willing to move in with him a mere five months after they’d started dating. His friends had warned him that he was moving too fast and was bound to be hurt, and he’d been the only one not surprised when Draco had said yes before he’d even finished the question.
“I promise, Blimpy is harmless,” Draco couldn’t resist teasing, and Potter shot him the finger.
Draco crouched down next to him. The robes came all the way to the floor and it was the perfect hiding place for a mischievous little boy. Well, the boy was about to learn that if you played hide-and-seek with a Slytherin, you were bound to lose.
“Ah, how times have changed,” Blaise sighed.
George laughed. “I think you broke him.”
“I’ll wait for you,” he told him. “Better to spend as much time with you as I can before you’re no longer a semi-permanent fixture in this house.” Potter laughed ruefully and Draco wanted to hate him for not knowing what statements like that did to Draco’s heart.
After a moment of deliberation, Ginevra’s brow smoothed out and she visibly relaxed. “The children have told me a lot about you.” she said. “Harry too.”
The blush that had finally begun to subside came back in full force and Draco could have decked Potter right then and there. “How. Dare. You.”
She took James’ hand and led the way down Diagon. Al held Draco’s hand and they followed close behind. As they walked, James and Al began to tell him about their plans for the coming Saturday.
“Merlin, I
made Draco pause to turn around, but only almost. He practically leapt down the steps and as soon as his feet touched the pavement, he turned on the spot, not giving a rat’s arse if any Muggles caught a glimpse of him Disapparating
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley,” Narcissa said quietly, and Draco had to look away, his chest constricting. Things weren’t supposed to be like this; that a small act of kindness
“That’s wonderful Mother.” he said in a voice that wavered a bit. His mother eyed him narrowly for a minute before turning to his aunt.
Pansy snorted. “That’s what you get for calling so suddenly. It’s not like I was expecting you.”
“Good children” he said, pleased. “Now what should we all do until your parents come?”
you. How do you like that?”
With a final weary-sounding hoot, Mercury lifted himself off the pillow and landed on the top of his cage. A cage that he refused to re-enter. Draco had tried to reason with him but he might as well have been talking to a wall for all the good it did him.
“Do you make it a habit of giving up on projects you’ve taken over?” Granger raised a brow impressively. “If I recall, you’re usually more tenacious than this.”
“Well,” he huffed. “Am I forgiven or not?”
Potter moved to stand beside him, his hip resting casually on the countertop. “I wouldn’t say ‘property’. You’re really more of a gift.” He stroked back a lock hair that had fallen over Draco’s forehead and gently tucked it behind his ear. Draco did his best to suppress a shiver. Bloody Potter.
in fact finished with – and clutch at his right arm, his face rapidly losing colour. Horrible black streaks appeared on his hand and they pulsated ominously, spreading a few centimetres up his arm each time. Potter’s face was scrunched up and sweating profusely, and a thin line of blood dripped down his chin as he bit through his bottom lip, unsuccessfully trying to hold back his cries of pain.
“So Zabini was seeing the Minister’s wife and he found out?”
Draco Floo-ed back to his room with a heavy heart, knowing that he was unlikely to get any sleep that night. Usually he’d speak to his mother before going to bed, but he didn’t feel fit for company. He’d go to bed and try to forget for a moment that Potter had come back into his life and set it to flame.
“I wanna buy mommy extra pretty robes.” Al announced.
Ginny shook her head. “Ron’s helping George out at the shop, and Harry’s gone into Auror training.”
Mirage-Pansy stalked up to Draco and whipped out her wand, flicking it at him with a sharp smile. “Perhaps this will reassure you of our authenticity.”
So whenever he saw the proof of their bond, displayed so beautifully in gold, reminding him of all that he
Draco ignored him in favour of taking a cautious peek outside. Potter had to have passed on by now and… Bugger, it looked like he was trying to claw his way through his throngs of worshippers to get to the shop.
“It’s annoying is what it is,” Weasley continued, frowning. “It’s all ‘Malfoy this’ and ‘Malfoy that’ all day long.”
“A quick trip jinx would have sufficed!”
Potter smiled gratefully. “I’ll serve as your overseer of course.”
In the fortnight that followed, Draco spent more and more time with the Potters. It seemed that the children requested his presence wherever they went and Draco was only too happy to join them. Potter had turned out to be the type of parent that wanted his children to experience all the joys of childhood, and Draco found himself reliving his own by accompanying them. His father hadn’t seen the need for such things but luckily for Draco, his mother had. Sometimes Potter would invite Draco to meet up with them at Diagon alley and then promptly ask him to think up a place to visit. Draco had already taken them to the magical zoo, the museum of magical history and the observatory he had loved as a child. The children had enjoyed these trips immensely but the strange thing was Potter seemed just as excited whenever they visited a new place. Only later did his aunt tell him that Potter hadn’t been allowed the childhood one would have expected of the Chosen one. After that, the trips weren’t only about the children. Draco wanted Potter to experience everything he had missed as a child and more.
“Er…” Potter blinked. “I think you look fine.” He gave Draco a look that would have looked appreciative on any other person, but only served to make Draco scoff.
, not some half-baked schoolboy. After he’d kissed me until I was so dazed I probably didn’t known my own name anymore, he invited me to adjourn somewhere more private.”
Potter frowned. “Be nice. She’s really happy with Nev. He’s abroad right now attending a Herbology convention in Germany, but he’ll be back in a week or so.”
James groaned. “Honestly, we just got back and you two are already all over each other. Don’t you get enough shagging done when we’re at school?”
Potter actually had the gall to look offended; as if
“Feisty one, isn’t he?” Thin Lips spoke to what remained of the crowd. It had dissipated wonderfully when Draco had entered into the fray and now only a few stragglers were left. Apparently an angry Draco was still considered dangerous; a small comfort in its own regard.
Mrs Weasley looked livid. “Something
took his wand in hand. A rush of pure heat shot through him as soon as he made contact, originating from his palm and spreading to his very toes. He gasped at the sensation and clutched his wand to his chest, hunching over it and simply
Potter shook his head. “I should be able to crack those. I’m pretty good at it actually and my trainers say that I could go into Curse-Breaking if I ever tire of Auroring.”
“What the hell was that?”
“He was the one who told me about it in the first place.”
Draco smiled. Perhaps a drunk Potter wasn’t so bad after–
“Come.” said the boy suddenly and scrambled back in the direction he’d come from. Draco could do nothing but follow behind as quickly as he could. He didn’t want to lose sight of the tiny figure, valiantly leading his way through the undergrowth. Really, all this fuss over a
Realization seemed to dawn on Potter. “Oh yeah! Sorry, I forgot for a minute.” he said sheepishly. “Robes, right. Well…” he trailed off
Draco quickly emerged out of the alleyway and headed back the way he’d come. He didn’t care that he was bumping into people left and right, shoving through the crowd like an uncivilised boor. He growled to himself as he pushed a hulking brute of a wizard out of the way, jabbing his bony elbows into the man’s fat pouch of a stomach. At least his skinniness was good for something, including slipping through tight crowds, whatever Mother had to say about it.
“Eww, they’re
take a few tentative steps first, and he hurried in after him, praying Potter was still in one piece. It wouldn’t do for the Chosen One to die of some unknown curse, the very day he invited an ex-Death Eater into his home.
Charlie raised his hands in defence. “Relax, Bill. I’m not trying to bed him.”
Potter was dressed in a plain green t-shirt, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and faded Muggle jeans. Draco had to admit, the man looked good in them. Said man was regarding him with a bemused smile on his face and Draco instinctively
“She was…” Draco struggled for a word. “
Draco described his little expedition to Potter who apart from the occasional interruption, listened in raptured silence. He’d visited places he’d never known existed, seen enough exotic plants to send Longbottom into herbology heaven and met Masters who were as brilliant as they appeared to be mad.
Draco surprised himself by reaching across the space between them and taking Potter’s hand. He gave it a companionable squeeze, trying to will Potter into cheering up. “If you asked me that ten years ago, I’d probably have said ‘yes’, but now all I can say is there’s nothing stupid in wanting a normal life. Merlin knows you deserve one after all the shite you’ve been through. Some of which was because of me.” Draco finished with a wince, withdrawing his hand and looking down.
Draco scowled. “I wouldn’t call it praise, merely speaking the truth. Brown may have good assets, or so the others tell me, but she’s a few ingredients short of a potion if you ask me.”
“So you’re gay?” Ginny observed with an unconcerned air that immediately put Draco at ease.
He was too busy staring at the couple in front of them. They were still ribbing each other and gave off the feel of two individuals who knew each other as well as they knew themselves. It was obvious to any onlooker that they shared a lot of history. At one point Ginevra offered Harry a bag of some sort of sweets. He took one out and bit it, chewing it contemplatively before offering the half-eaten piece to her to try. Draco found himself almost blindsided by the sudden jolt of jealousy that shot through him.
Harry rotates his arm a little and sure, it still feels tender but it’s likely just a bruise so he shakes his head. “I think you’ve scared at least fifty years off my life though,” he tells Draco seriously, feeling well enough now to be angry. “Honestly, what is
d me to let us know. It’ll be fine.”
“Next time you decide to have an afternoon shag, remember to lock the bloody Floo!”
Dean packs up his briefcase and is gone soon after, shooting Harry a slightly worried look as he steps into the floo. Harry closes his eyes and wills his heart rate and breathing rate to slow down. He throws his wand so it rolls a few metres away from his outstretched hand and then waits, breathes coming out slowly.
“I always
“Remember when you were trying to persuade me to give him a vacation?”
“Can that happen, Daddy?” Al asked fearfully. Potter patted his head soothingly.
surprise, Pansy – the girl who’d once tried to have sex with some bloke while Draco was sleeping in the same room, and had shown no shame whatsoever when she’d been caught – blushed as sweetly as a virgin bride on her wedding night, and shot Blaise a quick look that spoke volumes. Draco took a sharp intake of breath and his own problems were forgotten in place of a shocking realisation that hit him like the Hogwarts Express.
The horrible shrieking behind him
Draco snorted. “As if I’m in need of companionship.”
“It’s getting late,” Draco replied simply, smoothing out his trousers and looking around to see if he’d left anything behind. “Besides, you should have a night out with your
Potter…
“No,” Harry tells him firmly. “There are loads of other tricks I could’ve pulled on you. I took it too far with this one and that is not on you.”
“Make sure Draco eats a lot,” Molly ordered, giving him a disapproving look. “The child is much too thin and we simply
Mrs Weasley nodded gravely. “It was atrocious behaviour, truly frightful.”
“What you say is also true.” Fleur sighed. “Ze rest of ze family is no better, though ‘Arry does make an effort.”
confident. “It’s okay,” he repeated. “That wand – I could
“Oh yeah, because I’m
“I need some time to think about it,” he finally said, and Potter
“Draco dear, I was just telling Fleur about your old French tutor.” his mother said when she saw him. “Apparently she is one of her distant aunts.”
“I complain about you mooning about the Manor, not because I think you need to be out working somewhere. I complain because it breaks my heart to see you wasting away here with me. I’ve already lived my life to its fullest, but you… you are so young. You still have so much to do with your life and knowing that you live like this because of my and your father’s foolishness, is almost too much for me to bear.”
“Good afternoon Harry. I was just asking your friend here if he was feeling alright.” Mrs Spencer interjected. “He’s suddenly not looking too well.”
“Way to stake your claim, Harry,” she praised, giving the now blushing Potter an approving nod.
“I humbly accept your invitation Potter.” Draco said with the most dazzling smile he could muster. It must have worked too because Potter looked taken aback for a moment.
Draco took her arm and led her through the gate and up the short walk to the house. It was a quaint little thing, surrounded by a beautiful garden. The fence surrounding the property looked as if it were just for show but as they had passed the gate, Draco had felt a shiver of magic around him. Apparently there were wards and someone had included his and his mother’s magical signatures in them, allowing them to enter without difficulty.
Potter murmured something he couldn’t quite catch and then shuffled between positions, until he got comfortable. Draco’s breath hitched as Potter settled on his side, facing towards him. His cheek lay warm on his thigh and he could feel Potter’s slow breaths through the thin shirt he wore. Draco exhaled shakily.
“Stop what?”
Weasley choked this time.
“We were just talking about your mother’s resourceful way of keeping you both from Azkaban,” Thin Lips explained in a genial tone. “Really, you must be so proud of her.”
“It’s faster this way, not to mention more hygienic,” Draco returned smartly.
“Do tell Luna to join me for tea one day. I miss listening to her talks.” his mother said with a fond smile.
“Weasel can’t, but I’m pretty sure the rest of the family aren’t nearly as dim-witted. Remember the pranks the twins used to play in school?”
“Such behaviour is to be expected,” she continued. “People aren’t likely to forgive and forget so easily, and the War is still fresh in all our minds. Stop giving me that look, Draco.”
Sure enough, the mini hurricanes turned out to be Al and James, and they did not look happy. Oh, he was in for it now.
had he been thinking? Losing his cool like that and almost doing something stupid and completely unwarranted. Merlin, he hadn’t even been in Potter’s company for more than a few days and apart from no longer hating him, his feelings for him were borderline indifferent.
Harry’s seeker skills certainly come in handy as he dives onto the ground after the snake, snatching at its tail and swinging it off the ground with a triumphant cry.
“Are you alright?” Mrs Spencer suddenly asked with a sweet motherly concern. “You look rather pale, dear.”
“Water is alright. Thank you.” Draco didn’t feel all that safe drinking with Potter just yet.
“I froze. I literally could not move and suddenly he was right in front of me and then ducking under the umbrella to sit beside me. He ran a hand through his hair, pushing the wet locks back before giving me the most devilish smirk I’ve ever had the pleasure of seeing. He said that he hoped I’d been enjoying the view and obviously I started to flush like an idiot and splutter. I’m not usually very good with people I don’t know, and this man was a Muggle too. But somehow, I felt completely at ease with him and we actually had a nice conversation.”
Harry isn’t usually afraid of spiders but he thinks Aragog and his children may have done a number on him because the moment he’d caught sight of the gigantic monstrosity crawling towards him, he’d been
“Not in a bad way,” he admitted reluctantly. “You’re surprisingly good company. For a Gryffindor.”
out.”
Draco smiled at how bad Potter was at being subtle.
“I need to see him.”
“Oh nothing.” Draco said dismissively. “Just happy with the world in general.”
“No Lily.” Draco admonished sternly, trying to lean his head away from the little girls’ grabbing hands. “You can touch, but no pulling.”
The veela sniffed in disdain as she looked down at him but then her eyes fell on the pretty buns he’d made from her daughters’ hair and a delighted smile came to her face. Draco’s face heated up. He may have been gay as they came but even he felt his heart stutter at the utter radiance of the woman before him.
jolted him awake again. He looked up to find one of the Manor house elves standing by the side of the bed, wringing his hands together.
“Stop that.”
When the bushy-haired menace sprang her ambush, Draco was lying in bed staring at the ceiling as he was wont to do these days. He hadn’t seen Ginny since the accident which was probably because she was pissed that he’d handed a cursed book to her other half; bringing to mind past events best left forgotten. He turned, fully expecting to see his mother, but instead found himself faced with one Hermione Granger, famous for her intellect and doesn’t-know-when-to-bloody-quit attitude, breaking into his sanctuary like a witch on a mission.
“There was this one wizard in Tibet,” Draco recounted with a laugh. “He claimed that the only way he could get inspiration was to sit on his roof in the pouring rain stark naked. Unfortunately for me, it had been one such day when I’d come to his lab.”
“Not just me,” she replied with a knowing smile. “I saw that you and Ginevra were getting along splendidly as well.”
Almost immediately running footsteps could be heard from within and the door swung open with a ‘pop’ to reveal a small army of what had to be Weasley children, if the freckles and red hair gave any indication.
“Daddy actually did that?” Al asked in delight, his eyes shining like the most dazzling of emeralds. Draco had to force himself to look away from them.
“Well, I’ll be off then.” With a wave, he turned on the spot and
“Sure is. Although, fair warning, this particular dragon might not be so keen on you mounting him.
To his surprise, she gave an unladylike scoff. “My dear child, you would have to be married to Lucius Malfoy to understand what real drama is.”
“Daddy, can we get a doggy like Doug?” Al asked eagerly.
Draco shuddered at the thought. “My lips are sealed. And anyways, you can always try to make up for it this year.”
“You aren’t the boss of me, Potter.”
Al’s face lit up and Potter groaned. “Hide-and-seek will be a terror at our house now. Thanks for that.” he said dryly as Draco lifted Al off him.
Draco sent her the two-fingered salute in response and Blaise tutted.
Draco had been rather fond of her actually so he nodded. “
“I no longer call you that anymore so stop fussing,” Draco admonished. “Anyways, let’s see. Well, there’s joke shop Weasley, Gringott’s Weasley and stick-up-his-arse Weasley.”
“What’s a –”
“I live to please.” Draco replied with a bow. He held out his hand to help Potter off the ground. “So, do you have an idea of what Ginevra might want for her robes?”
“Draco, I know you want nothing to do with me but you
Everyone made faces at that.
The owl took off and did a quick circuit through the rooms before alighting back on Draco’s shoulder. It hooted once, sounding vaguely approving, and Draco laughed.
leave my side when we’re out shopping?”
“Why’d she have to go back? I miss her so bloody much.”
“Why are you such a snob?”
Potter stared at him in disbelief. “Oh don’t make that face, I was doing her a favour here. I even offered him the robes that I’d been thinking of getting Ginevra. That blue would have looked lovely on Mrs Smith.”
In a panic Draco turned to Luna but the witch seemed to have disappeared. In fact, now that he thought about it, the ‘pop’ he’d heard just as the door opened had sounded suspiciously like the sound of
Draco had no idea what a ‘film’, or ‘the tube’ were, though he had an inkling they were Muggle. Nevertheless he couldn’t back out now and he refused to look like an ignoramus in front of Potter so he just nodded.
Draco allowed himself to relax at that. So she just thought that it was some fancy academy. “Oh yes, it was rather an old fashioned school too. We didn’t even have electricity!”
Draco groaned, his head pounding from the bottle…alright,
“Harder, Malfoy.”
His mother looked furious. “Draco!”
Eventually they came to a clearing and Draco saw another little boy kneeling at the edge of what looked to be a fair sized hole. His little friend quickly made is way to the second boy and Draco knew at once that they were brothers. The other one looked to be a few years older but he had the exact same mop of black hair, though when Draco approached the two, he saw that this one had bright brown eyes instead of green.
“True story,” Ginny mumbled, half-asleep with her face buried in his chest.
Draco smiled fondly as he thought of his mother’s pretty smile, much more apparent these past months. “She used to smile a lot more when I was small. Things changed after that.”
of stuff that Gran doesn’t allow.”
Draco would have liked to say that he handled the situation with poise and dignity, but then he’d be lying and he always had been a particularly shite liar.
Harry looks at the spider and then at Draco’s frightened expression. He sets his jaw and gently pries Draco’s clutching hands off his shirt as he slowly steps down from the chair. Harry is done being cowed by a mere spider and he’s decided it’s time to take a stand.
“One would think I’d be adept at handling such matters by now,” his mother said with a small laugh, and Draco was instantly alert.
“This was a bad idea,” Draco said out loud and immediately regretted it when Potter gave a small grunt and opened his eyes groggily.
you work. Multitasking is a thing, you know.”
“Huh, I always figured he gave you free marks.”
got a new shipment of those but they’re in the back right now. If you’ll just wait here, Mr Potter, I’ll be back as soon as I can.” He practically skipped out the door to the back.
Draco was just finishing his lunch when the large owl landed beside his plate. It hooted pleasantly and held up a foot with a parchment tied to it. Draco untied it and gave the owl his last bit of rabbit as a treat. It affectionately nipped at his finger before flying away out the window it had come from. Draco unrolled the parchment and then smiled when he saw that it was from Potter.
Draco didn’t reply and tried to focus on what he was doing. They’d settled into a routine where Potter would first clean the books and break any Dark Curses on them, and then levitate them over to Draco to check for Familial spells. Once they’d both deemed the books safe to handle, they were passed back to Potter to be sorted however he pleased. The routine was repetitive enough that Draco didn’t need to give his full attention to it and he settled into a much needed brood.
“If she can take out Bellatrix Lestrange, she’s a warrior in my eyes.”
Harry resists the urge to whoop. “It looks brilliant!”
Draco wanted to sink through the ground, face and neck burning as he hurriedly pulled away from Bill.
“Are you bullying him?” Ginny suddenly demanded, taking in the scene before her.
“You really should try it this way,” Potter continued, holding out the balloon
Draco huffed in amusement. “Fear not, Potter, I’ve been the most upstanding of citizens these days. All I did was leave the lout with a little gift as we parted ways, and for all I know he might turn up tomorrow after all.”
He hooted again.
“What the bloody hell is happening in here?” he barked after seemingly finding his voice.
“Er Luna?”
“I try.”
Draco listened indulgently as James took to the floor with a flourish. Lily sat beside him and as of habit she gripped his shirt with one hand, leaning comfortably against him. He placed a soft kiss on her head. It’d been her first year at Hogwarts and he’d really missed her.
“Wait.”
“Oi, don’t just stop in the middle of the road! People are trying to walk here!”
Bob popped up as if he was on springs. “We
The Snitch must have sensed that it was being chased and suddenly darted to the left, disappearing from sight again. Draco pulled his broom to a halt as he lost track of it and turned to Potter. He was busy manoeuvring his broom out of the way of a Bludger and he too seemed to have lost it. Draco exhaled slowly. The Snitch couldn’t have gone far and if he just kept his eyes peeled, he could…
“If it wouldn’t be too much of a trouble.” Potter replied gratefully. “I’ve kept her nightie on her crib. Could you put her to bed too? I’ll put these two to bed and then join you.” He was already towelling off Al whilst James wiped himself. “I think they’ll be asleep as soon as their heads touch their pillows, so boys say goodnight to Draco now.”
Two more women entered after them and… bloody hell, was that the Beauxbaton’s champion from his fourth year? The veela who all the boys had been raving about. She’d actually married into the Weasleys?
“Good afternoon,” Draco faltered, trying not to wince when his voice cracked.
Ginny’s eyes narrowed. “Draco,” she began slowly. “You are going to meet my brothers and that is final.”
“I’m so glad you called,” she said gratefully. “My mum was about to drag me to go hat shopping, and she always takes
The crowd tensed up as they seemed to come to the realization that Draco was now armed, and the snotty schoolboy looked ready to wet himself. Although sorely tempted to hit the brat with a strong Furnunculus, Draco restrained himself and merely cast a Drying Charm on himself before striding away.
his mind in case Potter was a
“Draco, did I –
Draco smirks. “I suppose that would be an acceptable start to how you make up for giving me such a scare.” Harry smirks right back, releasing Draco and gently pushing him towards the door.
Draco cuts off abruptly and silence descends on the room. Harry has laid himself so that his face is turned on its side, facing the fireplace, but he doesn’t dare open his eyes even a crack to see what Draco is doing. He barely resists the urge to laugh but somehow manages, and he waits.
“I don’t know what I did wrong! I’m so confused and angry and hurt, and it’s like my mind is in a mess. This whole thing was crazy to begin with I know. Ron thought I’d finally cracked when I told him that you were going to the movies with us and when I kept meeting you he even suggested seeing a Mind Healer. And at first I thought this was just about getting over stupid school rivalries and the kids liked you so I thought what the heck, I might as well hang out with you. But you just had to go and be
“You think I won’t do it?”
“Potter, you
Draco shuddered at the loaded words. He took a deep breath and opened his eyes. Potter watched him earnestly, and it was all too much. Draco couldn’t think straight with him so close, and he moved away to get some breathing room.
“Daddy!”
“Let’s bury Albus in the garden!”
“You’re no fun, Malfoy,” Potter said in exasperation, shaking his head.
Al dragged him to the swing set and once there, Draco picked the little boy up and placed him in the seat of one of the toddler-safe swings.
Draco sent Ginny a bland look. “You didn’t tell him we were friends, did you?”
him?”
and almost fell out of his seat.
Draco was sure his heart came to a dead stop when Potter held out an unassuming brown wandbox. He stood up on legs that were shaking badly and took the box into his hands, locking eyes sharply with Potter.
fairly trying, having to fit my head in next to Pansy’s fat one…” Blaise began with a sly grin and then cut the call.
“I truly love that tapestry, you know.”
Potter uncomfortably shuffled his feet but didn’t contradict him. A moment of silence passed when James suddenly chimed in.
Draco coughed awkwardly. “You see, I knew your mother from school too.” he directed this at Al who had come back to stand next to him.
Draco looks positively disdainful. “I cannot believe you actually said that,” he deadpans, shaking his head slowly. “Seriously though, you’re certainly not getting any tonight if you don’t clean up the mess you’ve made. You better pray
Draco hung his head with a sigh. “I’ll be with you in five.”
“Ooh Dad, can we?” James asked, his eyes shining.
The impromptu massage continues for a few more minutes until Harry wonders why Draco is so quiet. “I was thinking, maybe we could invite Ron and Hermione over for dinner later this week,” he says as a ways of starting a conversation. “Hermione’s been begging to come have a look at the place, but I figured you wouldn’t want anyone over until we were properly settled.”
“Pansy, are you– Sweet mother of Merlin!” He hurriedly retracted his head and tried to shake the image of his best friend getting thoroughly buggered by some tanned Adonis of a bloke. Grimacing as the shock wore off, he grabbed another pinch of powder and threw it into the grate again.
Before he even knew it, a week had gone by and he’d spent every day in the company of Ginny Weasley. What made the whole thing so surreal was how
“But not in a bad way?”
as Harry tackles them onto the ground. Harry lets out a practically animalistic growl as he tugs his invisibility cloak away to reveal Draco’s grinning face, just barely resisting the urge to throttle him.
Weasley shook his head in despair. “Nutters, the lot of you. I’m completely surrounded by madness.”
wonderful to see you again. I’d kiss your hand, but as you can see, I’m all but a floating head in a fireplace.”
When he voiced this to Potter, the other wizard turned away, his shoulders tense. “Since Andromeda was cut off, any of her descendants never appeared on the family tree either.”
“Dad!”
“I wonder if your noble Gryffindor heart can handle it.” Draco said with a smirk.
“You should have seen her,” Blaise sighed wistfully. “She came right up to us and dragged the other girl away from me and then backed me against a wall and snogged the life out of me. That was when it clicked for me too. I’ve been ploughing my way through the population but nobody’s ever made me feel what I do when I’m with Pans. Apart from you, she’s the only one who sees the real me.” He grinned. “Not to forget, she’s in possession of a smashing pair of tits.”
“Typical Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes. “I suppose saving the world from the deadliest Dark wizard of all times wasn’t enough for him.”
In an illustration of pure recklessness, he released his broom and threw himself bodily forward. The Snitch smacked into the middle of his palm and he closed his fist around it in triumph, savouring the wonderful feeling – no matter how short-lived it turned out to be. Without his broom underneath him, Draco’s sudden flight sent him tumbling head over heels onto the pitch, crying out as he did a couple of somersaults before finally coming to a rest on his stomach.
“Hermione, thanks for bringing the kids.” Potter said, giving her a hug. “Sure you can’t join us with Rosie and Hugo?”
“Draco, my brother from another mother!” Blaise’s head appeared next to Pansy’s and he had the audacity to grin. “What brings you fire-calling?”
What Pansy had said resonated with him, but was he really willing to take a chance like that? Yes, he fancied Potter, but at the same time, he
Potter scratched his head sheepishly. “I sort of wanted to ask her advice on how to go about asking
“Exactly!” Draco pounced on what Potter had said. “Have you met his wife? No? Well, I ran into her at Flourish and Blotts the other day and ended up helping her find a book about Divination. From our brief interaction I found her to be rather lacking in intelligence, which explains why she’d marry Smith of all people, but making up for it by the fact that she is rather stunningly beautiful. The point to note here though, is that she is almost as blonde as me.”
Draco didn’t wait to hear more, rushing away as fast as he could. A stupid part of him almost wished Potter would just stay down in the kitchen and then he wouldn’t have to see him again. If Potter would just let it go, they could act like the kiss had never happened and things could be normal again. As if to dispel that very notion and rub his misdeeds in his face, when Draco made it back to the party, he immediately ran into Ginny and made her spill her drink all over her front.
Harry seemed to shrink before his eyes then, the anger leaving his face in an instance as a lost expression took its place. “I don’t understand.” he finally said helplessly. “I don’t know what I did.”
“Anyways,” Potter continued. “With the help of my house elf, Kreacher, I’ve managed to spruce the place up a bit, redecorating the rooms and throwing away some of the more...
Draco smirked. “Ginny and I make a pretty good team if I do say so myself. She’d have done well in Slytherin, something you couldn’t possibly understand.”
Draco grimaced. “I’d rather have my wand shoved up my nose than read her dribble. I honestly don’t see why Mother finds her books so appealing. Load of rubbish with too many adjectives and an unhealthy amount of fit chimney sweeps if you ask me.”
“Yeah, Sirius Black was my godfather and left it to me in his will,” Potter explained. “If it wasn’t for that, the house would probably belong to you, right?”
“Will you stop that?” Harry grit out through clenched teeth.
“You really are going to drive me mad in a few days,” he told the owl sternly as he hit his pillow with a strong Cleaning Charm. Another flick of the wand transfigured the cage into a lopsided perch. “There. You can sleep on that for tonight and maybe if this wand is in a better mood tomorrow, I’ll fix it up better.” That said, he didn’t wait for a reply and flopped face-first onto his pillows.
Draco smiled back shyly. “Goodnight…Harry.”
Potter had his mouth full but seemed about to respond anyways, so Draco hurriedly beat him to it.
Draco opened his mouth to tell the girl that they were definitely in no way
Potter readily accepted this and turned back to Weasley. “Did you just get back?”
“That sounds great. How ‘bout we go after this? I’m done with the rest of my shopping anyways and we could have lunch in Muggle London too.”
Draco relaxed only marginally when Potter stepped out from the shadows of the porch like some sort of spectre.
“But,” he continued, an idea coming to mind, “If you still want me to feel better, perhaps you could listen to what I have to say?” He felt pretty good considering he was trying to manipulate children – some of which were still in nappies.
They drifted into a comfortable silence and Draco wondered if this was what it was like to be Potter’s friend. Eventually Potter broke the silence with a question.
Draco shared a pained look with Blaise. “I’ll send it over when she’s finished with it.”
Draco heaved a weary sigh as he saw Harry making his way towards where he was standing alone. The unrelenting bastard had his mouth set in a hard determined line and Draco quickly darted over to where his mother was chatting with Fleur, almost bowling over George in his haste. It was too troublesome to think of them all as ‘Weasley’ so he’d taken Hermione’s advice and started calling them by name, though he still continued to call her husband ‘Weasley’. When her prompting had made him try out ‘Ronald’, they’d both given exclamations of disgust and Weasley had begged him never to call him that again lest he be sick. Draco was all too happy to oblige and Hermione had relented with a muttered “
his ankle,” Potter barked out orders with calm efficiency, wand already in hand. He didn’t ask permission, unmannered boor that he was, and Draco bit his lip as his injured ankle set itself with the sickening sound of bones aligning. Potter flicked his wand a few more times in Draco’s general direction, muttering under his breath, and Draco sucked in a startled breath as some of his soreness left him; his head for one, felt
“You didn’t need to accompany me.”
“Ooh romance, how thrilling!”
“I’ll come back to help you tomorrow,” Draco went on, ignoring the voice in his head that rose up in protest, reminding him that he’d vowed not to go back for anything and that to do so now was a sign of weakness. The voice sounded very like Lucius though, and that was proof enough that it knew fuck all. “I promised anyways, and I’m not usually one to go back on my word. Even if I still think you’re an annoying tosser,” he added just in case Potter thought they were pals now.
“And now?”
Just the other day they’d fixed up a lovely crib mobile and if they managed to get the carousel back into shape as well, Draco was certain the two items would be perfect presents for Teddy’s upcoming birthday. Potter had initially been against the idea of giving Teddy ‘someone’s old junk’, but Draco had assured him that giving family relics was what was generally done for a wizarding child’s first birthday and that he could offer him more than one present if he truly wished to.
He was gently pushing them in unison when a woman who reminded him a bit of Professor Sprout, joined them at the swings with a little boy.
“I do not know his name but would recognize him if I ever saw him again.”
“Okay,” Potter finally wheezed, bending over with his hands on his knees. “Okay, I’m done.”
He took a quick shower, scrubbing furiously at his left cheek, and changed into the pyjamas he kept reserved for occasions like this when he felt truly poorly. They were a gag gift from Blaise and a tad embarrassing with cartoonish baby dragons wobbling about the muted blue cloth, but they were also so soft.
Potter didn’t seem to know what to say to that and the rest of their walk up to the house was done in silence, they entered though the back door into the kitchen and to Draco’s surprise, found his mother vigorously mixing a bowl of batter, her sleeves rolled up and pretty robes covered by an enormous apron.
“Come on,” Potter continued. “We have to walk to the station.”
“I take it this cousin of yours… he wasn’t kind to you?”
“Oi, Ferret-face!”
“How delightful! So you are also a fan of hers?” Mrs Weasley gushed.
“I prefer the term
“Does this mean you’re gonna be our other daddy?” he asked in a whisper.
“I’m fine. Had a moment of madness back there where I was tempted to tell you both just how much you mean to me.”
To say that Draco was worried about seeing Potter again was an understatement. He was willing to admit he was
“Drop it, Charlie,” Weasley eventually broke the silence, his voice gruff. “It’s not like he needs to work in the first place when he’s rolling in money. Didn’t you hear him? Lives in a sodding
Draco laughed. He’d actually had a nice time today. Better than he’d ever expected a day out with Potter to be.
Luna vacated the room and Draco found himself chuckling. It was a good thing Luna was going with him today or he didn’t know how he would have survived the day. He dragged on the jeans and found them to be tighter than he was accustomed to but still comfortable enough not to make any adjustments to.
“Shall we go?” Luna asked kindly, seeming to sense his dilemma. “The Burrow is not too far from my house, as you might know. I’ll side-along you.”
“No chance of that,” he replied with a snort. “You’re a little too female for my taste.”
“I’m fine.” Draco moved away from Potter and regarded the door, almost able to see the Dark magic emanating from it. “Some of these are Familial spells and I can deal with those,” he said eventually. “But you might need to contact a Curse-Breaker to get through the Dark Curses that seem to be in place.”

owl – as it slowly clambered to its feet, shaking its head in a dazed manner. How it had even gotten out of the cage in the first place, he had no idea, but he was sure the latch had still been firmly locked when he’d set the cage down beside the fireplace. Narcissa leant forward to get a better look at the owl and it gave a polite hoot as if to say

Draco also opened his mouth to argue but between the two of them, his aunt and mother shooed them out like a pair of unruly schoolboys. If the barely concealed smirk on his mother’s face was anything to go by, it had all been planned.
“Mafoy, you’re really pretty,” Potter told him seriously. “Not pretty like Ginny-pretty; pretty like Malloy-pretty.”
in a snit but his anger was in no way directed towards Potter. He was furious with himself and his inappropriately growing desire to kiss Potter senseless. In fact, the only way he’d been able to stop his most recent attempt was by dousing himself with piping hot tea. Not his best decision but effective nonetheless. All he wanted to do was go home and have a long rant with Mercury. He supposed he should have been embarrassed that an owl had turned into his confidante, but Mercury was a good listener and Draco really had no one else he could talk to about this matter.
“Ron’s picking up the cake on his way back,” Potter said, keeping his arm around Draco’s shoulders as he steered them out of the room. “We still have time but it can’t hurt to finish up with the rest of the decorations early.”
“Now that he’s gone…” She turned back to Draco. “Darling, you’ve nothing to worry about. Weaslette–”
Draco drew himself up and steeled himself, adopting an expression that would have done Lucius proud. “Is there any need for you to touch me?” he asked in a voice that he hardly recognized as his own. It was so cold.
“I would not, as a matter of fact.” Draco shuddered at the very thought. “It would mean the day wasn’t completely unique to me.”
“Aren’t
.” Draco put in.
When he’d gotten his breath back however, he wasn’t the least bit surprised to see James and Albus standing in front of him.
“Dad, you know Draco?” he asked with all the innocence of a child.
“Okay, now you’re just being intentionally rude.” Potter gave a long-suffering sigh and looked at Draco apologetically. “I really didn’t want to do this…”
“Oh I’ve missed these.” Al groaned after taking a bite out of his one. James also said something though it wasn’t exactly understandable with his mouth crammed full of one whole brownie.
Harry is washing dishes while he listens to the soft
“Yeah, it
“She said I might catch you if I was lucky and I’ve been looking for you all morning,” Potter continued, idly scratching at a knot in the wood of the counter. “Finding you here was pure coincidence. I was being mobbed by some rabid fans and jumped into the nearest shop.” He looked sheepish. “I may have cast a powerful Repelling Charm on the door actually, after I came in.”
“Dress robes it is.” Draco said. “Now, does she have a preferred colour? Actually, never mind that. I think a nice lavender would suit her, perhaps with pale pink trimming. Or how about cobalt blue with light blue accents?”
Draco cringed at the reminder.
He found himself smiling now at the earnestness with which the children went about their work. They seemed to sincerely believe that they were doing this to cheer Draco up. Lily and Hugo had toddled over to Teddy and he was pointing out the pictures in the book that Draco had gifted him. As Draco had predicted, Teddy loved the book and now it kept the little ones distracted and out of the way of the others.
“The very one. She’s using the kids as a cover while she goes shopping.” he added with a laugh.
“Please, never call me that again.”
“You mean bribe them with candies to ensure their best behaviour.” Potter said with a wry twist of his lips.
“Not that it’s any business of yours,” Draco began pointedly, seriously considering the possibility that Potter had been cursed. “But I’m going home. I’ve already finished making my purchases and want to give my gift to Mother.”
“That’s Potter-Malfoy to you.” Harry replied with a cheeky grin and leant to kiss him on the cheek.
coming back in a few days. He got some time off so you might get to meet him eventually.”
Draco bristled. “Oh I don’t know, maybe because if it hadn’t been for me, Lily would still be in that bloody hole over there!”
“We need to clean up,” Draco suddenly announces, wrinkling his nose in disgust as he looks down at them both. “You’re literally a bloody mess, and you’ve contaminated me as well.” He looks so endearingly petulant that Harry can’t help reaching behind him to swipe at one of his ‘wounds’ and rub the mess onto Draco’s pristine cheek.
“They’re both fine, I suppose. They seem happy.”
Draco would have wrenched himself away but Weasley only further tightened his grip. “You’re not running away this time,” he said quietly, his tone firm as he proceeded to drag Draco to where Potter stood at the door, an unreadable expression on his face.
fit into this happy picture?
“You never told me about this, you sneaky bastard!”
when my jinx will take effect. It’s quite ingenious really,” he added with a modest shrug. “Completely alleviates suspicion and is embarrassing enough that he won’t go straight to St Mungo’s about it.”
His mouth twisted up for a moment, unsure if he wanted to tell them about his plans after all. He felt almost
“Yeah, yeah,” Draco muttered, giving the book a half-arsed glance before turning back to his work. “It’s all yours.”
The two nodded understandably. “We’ll talk to you later then,” Pansy said, leaning forward to ghost her lips over where the flames made his cheeks.
“I will.” Luna promised. “He’s out of the country right now, but when he’s back you both can come over for dinner. He’s a magizoologist and is currently on one of his expeditions.”
“You know, you’re sort of terrifying when you talk like that,” Ginny told him seriously. “You’d make a brilliant banker. I’m sure the goblins would love you for your ruthlessness.”
“Great! Let’s be off then, shall we?”
“I’ll use my own.”
“You suck.” Teddy said with a glare.
“Potter, you utter imbecile! Are you alright?”
“I do
“I don’t need to even feign appreciation in the slightest, Mother. These are divine.”
“I would think, Harry, that you’d know that Ron
Draco felt faint.
“Brilliant!” Ginny beamed. “Tomorrow’s a Sunday too so you’ll get to meet the whole lot.”
to speak to them.
“Who’s your grandmother?” Draco asked in shock.
Draco gave his back a bemused look and then went on his way. His wand was in a temperamental mood that day and he didn’t want to risk a splinching trying to Apparate home, leaving the public Floo at the Leaky as the only other option. No one liked him there of course, but there wasn’t a sign outside that barred his admittance (yet), and there wasn’t anything they could really do about. Draco took an inordinate amount of satisfaction in cheerfully waving at the glowering bartender just before he stepped into the Floo.
The owl turned its head around to look at him and Draco could have sworn that if owls could smirk, this one would be doing just that now.
“Kindly allow me to pass,” Narcissa repeated again, tone frigid.
When he came to the spot where No. 11 and No. 13 stood side by side, he took a few steps back and stared at the space in between, repeating the address in his head as he’d been advised. Soon enough, the two houses shifted apart and Grimmauld place sat snuggly between. Taking a deep breath, he walked up the steps but before he could ring the bell, the door swung open to reveal a panting Potter.
“Well, it
“Malfoy, you’re early.” A voice said behind him and he jerked forward, tripping over his own feet. A hand grabbed his elbow, preventing him from falling on his face and for a moment he was pulled back against a firm body. Draco gulped.
Draco leant back on one of the empty bookshelves. “And what makes you think I’d be willing to do that for
George laughed too. “Well, there hasn’t been a dragon he hasn’t won over yet.”
Potter actually smiled at that. “What would you expect when you take two fucked up individuals such as ourselves? Shall I continue?”
“You actually
kind of a war hero and all.”
Potter instantly tensed again. “Lucky guess.” he spat.
Draco really should have left at that. He should have ignored the barb and been on his merry way to find his mother. He should have chosen the course of action that ensured no complications, as any good Slytherin would.
She didn’t try to hex me at all and we managed a civilised conversation. She says I’ve gotten paler,” he added with a frown.
“Don’t worry, it’s really just a train. The only difference is, it goes underground.”
“Just because you’re clean and look after your hair and skin doesn’t make you gay,” Ginny said with one shouldered shrug. “I mean, take Charlie for instance. He’s probably the roughest out of all the Weasley men but he’s also as queer as a magenta hippogriff.”
A part of him knew that he was saying this as much to himself as he was to Potter. Trying to remind them both that Ginny did not in any way deserve to get hurt.
“He’s a bad influence.” his mother declared with venom and Aunt Dromeda really did laugh at that.
When the two finally arrived, they looked anything but pleased. They were wearing matching sleep robes, haphazardly pulled on, and Blaise hadn’t even bothered to close his. He sported a pair of black pants and his lean, dark torso was on full display. Pansy’s hair was a right mess, her lipstick smudged and some impressive hickeys littered her neck. There was no question as to what they’d been up to when he’d called.
“Irresistible, yet sadly not very modest,” Draco muttered under his breath, although Potter must have heard him anyways as he began to laugh.
“Hi Mrs Spencer!” Al called from his swing.
“Sweet Circe…” Her wand already out and waving intricate patterns in the air. “Draco, send a Patronus to St Mungo’s. I can’t handle this on my own.”
I’ve never met a group of birds that were so irritable and vicious. When I was very small, they’d chase me around the gardens if I was stupid enough to go outside without Mother. Probably would’ve pecked me to death if they’d ever caught me. My first Christmas home from Hogwarts, I made sure to chuck snowballs at the beasts until I was exhausted. Lucius was furious but I think Mother was secretly pleased.”

Charlie blinked in surprise. “So what, you’re just staying at home doing nothing? Not looking for work or
of the popcorn in the microwave. He smiles as he hears Draco yelling for him to hurry up, already snuggled up on their couch with a thick blanket around him. He keeps claiming that the movie will start in a minute, but it’s already been fifteen minutes and Harry’s pretty sure it hasn’t begun yet or Draco would already be screaming. His boyfriend isn’t very good when it comes to anything remotely scary, though he begs to differ.
. I was pretty sure you wouldn’t take it kindly if I randomly popped over to your place.”
“But how…” Potter began in bewilderment
“Well, maybe next time I will ask you for help!”
Draco smirked though his next words brought a twinge of hurt. “If I ever talk to Blaise again, he owes me a thousand galleons.”
“Will
“Ooh, a naked Malfloy!” Potter’s eyes widened. “Tha’s even better!”
“Potter, the thing was growling and practically foaming at the mouth. What about that, gives the impression of friendliness?”
Potter rolled his eyes. “I used to be an Auror, remember? And anyways, what were you thinking?”
So he did, and when he’d finished, his friends looked as frustrated as he felt.
fatten him up. Narcissa says he eats far too little.”
Potter didn’t seem to be listening, too intent on glaring across the room at Draco. He’d been like that for a while now and for the life of him, Draco couldn’t fathom why. It couldn’t be because of the match; Potter was an appallingly good-natured loser and had even congratulated Draco on a fine catch when they’d sat down for supper. In fact, he’d been reasonably polite for most of the evening until this sudden shift in mood, and the only explanation Draco could come up with was that Potter didn’t like the way Ginny was plastered against him. Even now, she was casually placing her head on his shoulder, and as far as Draco knew, Potter wasn’t aware of his sexuality and it probably
“Afterwards, you will take yourself off to bed.
Draco looked down at Ginny who had fallen asleep on him and shrugged. “Perhaps.”
“I’m fine.” he said in a strained voice. “But er…I have to ask, how could you be so sure Ron and ‘Mione would end up together.”
He made his way to the wardrobe and contemplated what he should wear. He wasn’t sure if he was supposed to be dressed in robes or Muggle attire.
“And are we sure Weasleys can plan so far ahead?” Pansy looked sceptical.
Potter cleared his throat awkwardly, Weasley looked just about ready to laugh, and Draco wondered if he could survive jumping out the window. The moment of truth, however, was interrupted as the door swung open to admit Granger, face set in a mulish expression. They all stared at her and she crossed her arms tightly, lifting her chin and setting her jaw.
Draco looks as apologetic as Harry’s ever seen him and he gives a sheepish one-shouldered shrug. “It’s a simple enough Doppleganger Charm, and I knew Sev well enough to produce a reasonable likeness. I didn’t expect you to react so… explosively,” he adds somewhat defensively and Harry gives him a narrowed look.
“That’s not what I meant.”
It was just after dinner and Draco was sitting out in the garden reading. To his embarrassment, he’d sought solace in the pages of one of his mother’s torrid novels, and though he still thought them utter rubbish… well, at least they were
“Ignore her,” he tells Draco as he heads inside to retrieve their wands and some carving knives. When he comes out again, he can see Draco making rude gestures at their hidden neighbour and he sighs, discretely passing him his wand, which he pockets just as sneakily.

“Nothing’s happened
Ginny sagged with relief. “You gave me a right fright but if you can still run your mouth, then you’re going to be fine.”
Needless to say, he choked.
“Couldn’t we send Malfoy for them?” Weasley suggested after a pause.
Luna nodded. “I do actually. You were very earnest.”
Potter looked pained. “Listen, I didn’t mean it like that. I’m truly sorry and it has nothing to do with my bollocks. I mean, yeah I
“Though I’m surprised Draco let you maul him like that. Some of those look borderline painful.”
Those capable arms holding him close as Harry claimed him with his mouth alone. Draco trembled at the memory.
“So I’m equivalent to a piece of furniture now? Property of Potter.” Draco had no idea why he’d just said something so strange, but his mouth didn’t seem to be listening to him.
.” Potter back with narrowed eyes. “Ginny warned me that you’d start blaming yourself the first chance you got and she told me to tell you to get your head out of your arse because not everything is about you.”
She let out an irritated sigh and briefly glanced at the Weasleys, giving them a stiff smile before grasping Draco by the arm and leading him away from them. “If you must know,” she began once they were out of earshot, “I’ve been subjected to unfriendly behaviour before.”
“I do know my fair share when it comes to flying.” Draco said in irritation. “Think I got the seeker’s position by fluke?”
doing here?!”
Potter gave a dismissive wave. “It’s already been a year now. I can truthfully say I’ve gotten over it. Though,” he had a self-deprecating smile on his face now, “I sometimes wonder if I’d married Ginny just because it was expected. Not to say that I didn’t love Ginny, because I did, but I’ve always wanted a family and the closest I’ve had is the Weasleys. Being with Ginny felt so
“In the event that he
“So where have you been all these years?”
Ginevra gave him an affectionate swat on the arm. “As long as

“There! I wanna play there.”
Mercury gave a warning hoot from the tree he was perched on, just as someone who was definitely
Back when his friendship with Ginny had just begun, Draco had not seen any of this. All his ignorant self had seen when looking past Potter’s hero factor, was an awkward, socially inept, train-wreck of a wizard, all rash decisions and brazen luck, and he’d been baffled that Ginny had settled for
“Fucking hell, Draco, this is a fine mess you’ve gotten yourself into,” Blaise groaned. “If the groping is anything to go by, Potter obviously has a certain fondness for your arse.”
“I said… you need to calm down,” Potter panted and Draco twisted as the hot puffs of air fell on his face. “Stop squirming, you little shite.”
Draco wasn’t sure how to respond to this. He’d never heard someone accept the title as if it were something to be proud of. Although… the Weasleys probably
about Potter looking so vulnerable. He was supposed to be all things light; full of spirit and life and daring. He wasn’t supposed to look drained and helpless because of Draco’s stupidity.
Draco made his way towards him, and saw that he’d stiffened. He mentally rolled his eyes. Did Potter think he was planning on attacking him and then making off with the children?
Al studied the playground gravely, tapping his chin as he no doubt comparing the pros and cons of each piece of equipment. Eventually his eyes settled on the swings.
“Oh, did Narcissa get the new release?” Pansy asked excitedly. “I must borrow it. The last one with the chimney sweep was simply delicious!”
back to the Manor, catching a glimpse of the family waving back at him just as he was whirled away.
“Glad they meet with your approval. I’m quite pleased with them myself actually.” He entered his bedroom and set the cage down. “I suppose you want to stay in here?” The owl rubbed its little head against Draco’s cheek. “I’ll take that as a yes then.”
Pansy shot him a sardonic look. “You act as if she’s some ancient warrior.”
“To get back to the matter at hand,” Granger interjected. “Harry, is there anything you want to say?”
Potter did not look pleased.
A week later found Draco in Diagon alley. Surprisingly he hadn’t been hexed yet, and though he had received a few looks, no one had said anything to him either. He was even tempted to test his chances by going to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink. However, before he could implement this thought, he was suddenly tackled from the right. Before he could even come to terms with what had knocked his breath away, another one tackled him from the opposite side. He gasped out in pain and was even reaching for his wand when he heard two very familiar voices exclaim “Draco!”
When Draco lifted his gaze, it was with a jolt that he remembered Ginny. She was looking at Fred’s hand with a sad little smile gracing her face, pained brown eyes glistening brightly. Draco swallowed and then looked back at the clock, wondering at the pain the family must feel every time they looked at the clock and its ever-present reminder.
Draco looked away. “I didn’t want to hear about your relationship,” he said quietly. “Not when I…” He blushed at the words left unspoken.
“Is that what the kids call it nowadays?” Draco smirked.
George crowed gleefully. “Malfoy against Potter, eh? Get ready for fireworks!”
“Well hasn’t this conversation taken a depressing turn?” Draco finally said with a shake of his head.
“Is this good?” he asks, trying not to squirm as the wet paint seeps into his front.
“If she didn’t want you over, Potter would have
“Oh.” Draco didn’t really know what to say to that. “Sorry?”

“Dad, we’re here.” James broke in.
“Well you shouldn’t have assumed that I was Harry.”

“What?” Draco demanded, extremely unnerved.

And he’s
Potter looked just about ready to storm off and bring the hammer of righteous punishment crashing down on the heads of Draco’s supposed persecutors, and it really was too much. He began to laugh helplessly.
“Do you have any more scary stories?” Victoire asked.
“So do you accept my proposition?” Potter looked at him imploringly and the full force of his stupidly green eyes hit Draco hard.
“It wasn’t anything important,” Draco replied quickly, shrugging. “I can’t even remember what it was now.”
“You might want to get your glasses checked, because if they were working, you’d have seen that
Weasley’s face lit up. “Would you?”
Draco snapped his fingers, a thought crossing his mind. “You know how most magical toys already have the magic implemented into their design, and that’s how they run on their own? Well, I remember some of my old toys weren’t like that, and Mother would have to add her own magic to get them to work. If she forgot to replenish their stores, they’d stop working when all the magic was used up.”
! And the hole appeared out of nowhere! And
Harry was trembling now, in anger or hurt Draco had no idea. Regardless, he recklessly plodded on, taking on a jeering tone. He was starting to feel giddy now. “What’s the matter Potty? You don’t look too well.”
Draco laughed helplessly. “You have an answer for everything, don’t you, Potter?”
Had Draco liked the film? He’d
“She still hasn’t given up then?” Draco asked sympathetically.
Draco tried to quell the sudden bubble of excitement he felt at Potter’s words. It was almost as if he was asking him out on a
Draco stared at the closed door for a moment, resisting the urge to go in after him. He was still painfully hard but he’d have to contend with a nice long wank when he got back. Eventually he shook himself and walked down the steps and out of the wards, glancing back for one final look at the house before
“And what’s not to like about you? You’re handsome, educated, charming. I think you’d make a wonderful match.”
“Turn around so I can do your back,” he tells Harry. “Though I warn you, I’ve never done anything like this before so I’m not sure how well it’ll turn out.”
“Funny thing is, I never noticed how much she’d changed until I saw her finding herself again.”
“It does have its merits,” Draco snorted in amusement, “But if your father is anything like mine, the necessity of an heir would drive him to find some discreet family to marry you off to, gay or otherwise. Why, just the other day Lord Greengrass called on us to ask if we were still planning on fulfilling the contract.”
Draco sprang forward with a snarl and Potter gave a low
She gracefully left the foyer and Draco made his way up to his suite of rooms. He switched out of his outdoor robes and haphazardly dragged on a pair of Muggle shorts and a plain t-shirt that was much too big for him. It made him look even more emaciated than he already was, but was also sinfully comfortable. He then grabbed a band off his dressing table and dragged some of his hair back into a messy queue. His hair really wasn’t long enough to tie back – and he sure as hell didn’t plan on growing it out – but he found that he liked to pull his hair back. His mirror, on the other hand, was not a fan of the look.
They can make it look like an accident!”
be a fucker if you’d volunteer as the fuckee.”
For all his previous blustering, Potter had grown deadly silent now, staring at Draco as if he was truly seeing him for the first time. Draco wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad response, but continued with his explanation regardless.
Potter smirked. “How else does one blow things, Malfoy?”
When he reaches out to the trip for the third time, he isn’t even surprised when he hears the sound. This time he turns with a scoff, fully expecting to see nothing again since apparently he’s going crazy and is hearing unidentifiable sounds now. Instead, Harry chokes on his spit and jumps back so fast he bangs the back of his head hard on the wall.
“Very well then. Leave me in the company of this boor.”
Ginny nodded understandably. “Well,
“Well, I’m just– I mean, I realised that I’m pretty much taking up all your time, right?” Potter looked so adorably repentant and it was all Draco could do not to reach out and smooth his wrinkled brow.
Well, there went his grand escape.
the two of them looked together. Certainly they made a handsome couple but it was more than just that. They shared an easy connection that few ever did; a sort of emotional bond that spoke of the trust and understanding between them.
will be expecting you here as soon as possible. You’re surprisingly good company. For a Slytherin,” she added with a smirk.
“It was no trouble at all.”
Draco hardly registered her command, his eyes locked on Potter. Would his younger self have been pleased to see him thus fallen? Suddenly Lucius’s voice was in his head, crowing over the fact that he managed to cast a Cruciatus Curse on the great Harry Potter. Had Potter cried like this back then too?
“Draco, glad to see you could make it!” Arthur came up and clapped him on the back good-naturedly, a broad smile tugging at his lips.
“Knowing Mother, she was probably spying through a window or something,” Draco said in answer, beginning to make his way back to the Manor. “Or maybe she has some advanced spell that lets her observe everything that happens on the grounds. Merlin knows, she’s devious enough for it.”
The two witches began to move towards the shop, still chattering away to each other and Draco was left behind with the Weaslette. She looked completely unsurprised by the truly shocking turn of events.
Sometimes Ginny would pop by and then they’d take a break to chat with her or go for a quick flight, Disillusionment Charms hiding them from Muggle eyes. Draco found that he’d really missed hanging out with her, and watching the way she and Potter interacted brought into perspective how
Draco shrugs. “You were taking a while and I wanted to make sure you were alright.”
“Yes he is.” Potter replied, shooting him a look. “Even though it’s perfectly
“That shirt really does look lovely on you.” Luna commented as they walked down the driveway. They could always have
“Promise?”
If anything Potter looked even more bemused now. “I did say we’d meet here at half past didn’t I?” he asked. “If my watch is correct, then it’s only a quarter past.”
Draco felt stupid, even as he forced out a laugh. Really, he was turning into a Hufflepuff, getting his hopes up over every little thing.
Bob chose that moment to return, dragging along a simply enormous bag of pellets. For some reason he wasn’t using his wand, even though it was right there tucked behind one ear, and he grunted as he hefted the bag onto the counter.
“So something
They made their purchases and Draco paid this time, insisting that he owed Potter after the film. Then they found an empty table which was unfortunately in the middle of the shop. Within moments, most of the room was staring at their little trio. Al however, was too busy getting the contents of his mint chocolate chip ice cream cone all over his face and shirt to pay them any heed and his father seemed to be not too far from doing the same.
At the same time, Draco also knew that he’d overreacted and quite possibly made an utter berk of himself. He shouldn’t have flared up and huffed away like a child throwing a tantrum, but he couldn’t seem to help it when it came to Potter. He had a horrible tendency to making Draco feel insecure and defensive and uncomfortably sixteen all over again.
“Of course I like you, Potter.” He swallowed. “I sincerely value our friendship.”
“Alright then… I’ll, er, accept it as a gift then.” Potter reached out cautiously and snatched up the bag before retreating away from the counter again.
“Night Draco.” they chorused.
Progress increased rapidly afterwards and the biggest surprise was probably the fact that he and Potter got on quite well when not actively hating each other. Potter turned out to be warm and unexpectedly witty, with a wicked side that Draco hadn’t expected at all. He could make Draco laugh, which was no easy feat, and could take a joke at his expense with good grace and patience that he certainly hadn’t exhibited when they were children.
was soothing but when Draco looked at Potter he seemed anything but relaxed, fidgeting in his seat and looking up at the ceiling, expression troubled.
Harry pouted but pulled back nonetheless, allowing Draco to straighten up and push away from the wall he’d been crowded against. He used a spell to smooth out the wrinkles on his dress robes and did the same for Harry’s. “Ginny will never forgive me for ruining her wedding day. I’m her best man and I cannot be late.”
Ginny smirked. “We’ll see, Malfoy. We will see.”
Weaslette nodded and bestowed on him a comradely grin. “We’ll get along swimmingly then. Oh, and even though I know who you are, I don’t think we’ve ever been properly introduced.” She held out a hand. “Ginevra Weasley, Ginny if you please.”
Well, his day just kept getting better and better.
Harry sodding Potter was standing before him, his atrocious hair even more of a mess than usual with leaves and twigs and
do you think you’re doing, Draco?”
“In his defence though, he was trying to charm his pumpkin juice into rum and it somehow exploded.”
Ginevra’s face broke into a brilliant smile as she too stared around the room. “The room looks amazing! Draco, gosh did you do all this?”
Narcissa continued to glare icily at him and he met it with one of his own. A cleared throat finally broke the tension between them, and they both turned to see that despite it being obvious that they were having a private conversation over here, Mrs Weasley had
“Potter!” Draco gasped, the breath practically knocked out of him. “What the –” He wasn’t allowed to continue as Potter’s mouth descended on his own and then all Draco could do was wrap his arms desperately around the man’s shoulders and kiss back for all he was worth.
“Yeah Malfoy, you did promise to spend some time with them and you aren’t busy right now.” he said, his lips twisting into a rather vicious smile. “You should come with us for sure. It’ll be loads of fun.”
?” Ginny sounded disgusted.
“I find them to be extremely intelligent creatures.”
Draco hurried on without pause, ignoring the taunts and laughter that followed in his wake. He gritted his teeth as he pulled his hood up to cover his hair and obscure his face a bit. He really should have listened to Mother when she’d told him to cover up his distinctive hair, but after being subjected to the indignity of being forced to leave the Manor against his will, he hadn’t exactly been in a listening sort of mood.
“Fred, stop pulling your sister’s hair! Louis, you cannot drip paint all over Molly’s dress! Teddy, get Hugo away from the window this instant! Good god James, what are you doing to Lily’s face?!”
Potter choked. On what, Draco had no idea but he choked nonetheless. “Easy Potter. I warned you beforehand, didn’t I? And anyways, that isn’t really all that shocking. The son was quite the piece of arse. Honestly, if I’d known Blaise was shagging him that summer, I’d have asked him if he was willing to share.”
“Merlin’s saggy left tit, I can just see you pelting those peacocks with this righteous expression on your pointy little face!”
“Is it really such a bad thing though?” Blaise suddenly spoke up, his voice soft.
“You need to stop worrying, Malfoy,” Potter added with a wry smile. “With you on the case, everything will go like clockwork.”
Ignoring him as best he could, Draco exhaled slowly and felt the balloon inflate a little before it got stuck at a certain point. Frowning, he blew a bit harder, but the obstinate balloon still wouldn’t budge.
It was a handsome piece of furniture, made of a dark rich wood that had been lovingly worked over using magic until it was covered in dainty carvings. A figurine of a fairy sat prettily at the top centre, her slender legs curled over the surface of the mirror, and even now she was scrunching her nose up in disgust.
be above using, and full-on seduction involving interesting choices of clothing. All in all, Harry manages a full day and is proud of it.
“So, Draco, you single?” Charlie casually asked next and George snickered again, tightening his hold on Draco as if he expected him to keel over – which, truth be told, was beginning to be a very real possibility.
“What’s your mum’s name?” James asked.
“Maybe if you didn’t dress like a cross between a homeless kid and a gay stripper?” Weasley suggested gruffly.
“Much as I’m tempted to accept your offer, I really should be getting back.” Draco said regretfully. “I could always fire-call Mother to tell her I was staying, but I don’t like to do that at such short notice. She’s probably still waiting up for me as it is.”
When the dishes are done and the popcorn is ready, Harry finally joins Draco on the couch, placing the popcorn on his lap.
“Well the Knight bus – ”
“Nothing much,” Draco replied quickly, adopting a casual tone that sounded horribly fake even to his own ears. “This whole week was pretty much spent improving my Seeking skills with Ginny.”
“It works! Wicked!”
He took Harry’s hand and led him to the Floo. They passed the Black tapestry that still hung in its place on the wall and he gave it a fond smile as his eyes sought out his name, proudly connected to the one which lay branching out from
“But I told him to get here an hour

“Why?”
and it seemed to be crashing about in an almost frantic manner. Draco wasn’t taking any chances, especially with the children around, so he quickly (and effectively) pulled out his wand, pointing it in the direction of the sound. Lily had stilled and tightly wrung her arms around Draco’s neck. James too had ceased in his prattling and huddled closer to Draco, while Al seemed to have woken up fully and was tensed up with a hand gripping his shirt tightly. They all waited in silence. There was more rustling and then through the bushes came a –

“Tell your mother we said ‘hello’,” Blaise added.
Draco smiled softly. “I appreciate the confidence you had in me.”
“That isn’t your wand.”
. All anyone has to do is mention you and he instantly perks up. I swear if he had a tail, it would be wagging nineteen to a dozen. Draco, you’re so good for them and all I ever want is to see them happy.” Her voice brooked no argument. “I may not be married to him anymore and I may not be in love with him, but Harry is still my family and I love him. So stop hurting him and stop hurting yourself over some stupid reason – because I’m pretty sure whatever you’re worrying about is not anything serious.”
Eventually Potter found his voice, supposedly having had his fill of staring. “I… didn’t know you’d gone to bed, or I’d have called tomorrow. It’s still pretty early and I figured you’d be free so Andromeda brought me here and– and I’m rambling again, aren’t I?” He laughed and the easy sound of it took some of Draco’s tension away.
Draco shot the door a dubious look but sure enough, people seemed to be giving it a wide berth as they walked past.
“I mean, sure you have your father’s colouration and height,” Potter said next, almost as if he knew what Draco was thinking, “but everything else is all your mum’s. You’re really slender like her, and you have her shape of eyes and mouth. I only noticed that night she ambushed me with tea. You both smile the same and have similar mannerisms too.”
“Merlin’s balls, Lily! Do you have a death wish or something?” Draco fumed. “I mean I know having Potter as a father must be both a bother and an embarrassment, but surely it hasn’t led you to wanting to end your exceedingly short life.”
?” Potter croaked and Draco laughed.
“Whatever are you doing skulking around in the dark, Potter?” It was kind of eerie not being able to see Potter’s expression. Only his glasses were visible, glinting in a faintly menacing manner.
Harry was taking in the scene with an unreadable expression, eyes softening when he looked at the children but when they looked at him… Draco took an involuntary step back at the purpose in those eyes. Salazar save him, Harry wanted to
Harry?” Ginny groused loudly. “He’s going to get a real earful if he makes me wait any longer.”
When they reached the foyer Draco suddenly wondered where his mother was. He couldn’t seem to hear her about and was considering summoning a house elf to fetch her when Luna spoke up.
Ginny’s face scrunched up in a grimace. “That must have ended ugly.”

Ginny laughed and Draco was tempted to throw the polish at her.
“Unless you
“How can you still be so concerned about me after what I did to you?” he asked in a strangled voice, forcing himself to lift his head and look at him.
sound, and took off like a shot, jetting around the room like a wild pixie.
“I use this broom so often, it’d probably fall apart if I didn’t routinely service it,” Ginny explained as she reached into her servicing kit and pulled out a pair of twig clippers.
“Oh.” Potter looked like he’d die of chagrin. “Right. Sorry. I’m pretty much killing this apology, aren’t I?”
“Just like a battery,” Potter said with a grin.
“If it wasn’t for her, I probably wouldn’t have lasted through eighth year.” Draco replied softly. “She’s my best friend.” He looked Potter unwaveringly in the face when he said this and the man smiled.
Draco took the proffered bag because really, there was nothing else he could do. He was genuinely terrified of what Bob might do if he were to tell him that he actually didn’t want the owl, and he had a feeling that even with Potter in the room, he wouldn’t get through it alive. With a resigned sigh, Draco picked up the cage.
Weasley blushed fiercely, shooting Granger a betrayed look. “I was threatened.”
He found Lily’s nightie to be just where Potter had said, and the searched through her chest of drawers for some socks. The weather was mild but there was always the chance of her feet getting cold in the night. He quickly dressed her and then settled her down with a blanket wrapped snuggly around her. His mother had always read him a story before bed but the little girl’s eyes were already drooping so Draco decided not to. She had to be exhausted after playing all afternoon.

in front of Potter! You know how I feel when it comes to him!” Draco blinked as he registered his own words. He really didn’t know why he was so angry, but the thought that Potter was most probably with his friends right now, no doubt having a good laugh over poor, jobless, weak Draco Malfoy, was enough to make him want to scream.
“What else am I to call you?” Draco sniffed disdainfully, watching as Harry tensed.
“Wait, why was Draco running away? Harry, did you
Draco shook his head in disbelief. “Honestly, Weasley, everyone knows that you should never interfere in the kitchen when a house elf is present. It’s like one of the laws of the universe.”
“Bye Draco.” The boys chirruped together and Draco waved as the children followed their father into the crowd. Soon the family was out of sight and Draco wondered for a moment if he had bitten off more than he could chew.
Draco shrugged. “Your family is an exception, but most Pureblood families are just as vicious. Blaise’s letter was also smudged and I think his hand had been shaking when he wrote it. He expressed his condolences for my father and said that his mother didn’t really care about what we’d done in the War. For all her liberal ways, Ariana Zabini could be as loyal as they came. However, he said that he had to be there for Pans and if Parkinson Sr. found out that he still spoke with me, he’d ban Pansy from seeing Blaise too. There was nothing else to be done. After Pansy’s mum died, we’d both made a pact that whatever happened, we’d always protect her. I’m pretty sure they were in love with each other too.”
Draco screwed his eyes shut. “Potter, why must you do this to me?”
… wouldn’t invite you if she wasn’t certain you’d be welcome. Just charm them the way you handled her and Mrs Weasley. You’ll be fine.”
“Potter, I need to tell you something.” Potter looked up at him inquiringly. “The thing is… I–”
to be completely put on.
Potter nodded tersely.
“That’s
Before Mrs Spencer could make any further suggestions though, her grandson chimed in. “Grandmamma, I wanna go to the slides!” He sprang off the swings and grabbed her hand, trying to pull her along.
Draco pursed his lips in distaste. “The thing that threw me off the most about that whole conversation was the fact that he didn’t appear to know who I was. Has he been living under a rock all this time?”
“Kreacher will also bring Master Harry some cinnamon biscuits.”
“Oh, thank Salazar!” Draco exclaimed as soon as Ginny told him that it was only she and her parents that were at home that morning.
“After a few minutes of general ogling, I noticed that one of them seemed to be looking back. I sort of panicked at that point and quickly looked away, pretending in vain that I hadn’t been drooling over his gorgeous body emerging from the waves. When I risked a glance back, I was further panicked to see that he seemed to be coming towards me.”
He was about to call out to the fallen hero in his best placating tone when the children suddenly sprang up from his arms, rushing towards Potter in a way that would surely spook him and result in a frenzied attack. Just as Draco was about to intervene though, he recognized the excited cries coming out of their mouths.
“The Burrow?”

Draco shrugged. “We Malfoys are full of surprises.”
Ginevra gave everyone in the room a smug look. “I told you.” she said plainly.
a sound in the first place.
“Harry, come back here, you utter berk!” Draco looks torn between staying safe on his chair and following Harry. “I will not be accounted for your early demise.”
Weasley looked sick and Draco let out a squawk of outrage. “What is with you Gryffindors and your perverse fascination in my clothes? What I wear in my room is my own business.”
“Yeah, he’s mad at Hermione too,” Potter stated lazily.

“Leave it to me and go upstairs. Mistress Andromeda wanted to speak to you about the food. She seemed quite impressed with it all.”
“I win.”
“Well then, Narcissa, do you have somewhere to be or would you like to accompany us? Ginny and I were just on our way to Flourish and Blott’s to pick up Joyce Gretchin’s new release.”

“Granger?”
“Well, I
“Still haven’t forgiven her for ‘stealing’ Adrian Pucey from you?” Blaise asked with a sly smile.
Draco began to shake his head. “No. No, this isn’t happening. I’m not– I can’t be– It’s just attraction. It’s a fucking crush! I can’t–”
“If he has any taste whatsoever, he’ll like what he sees.” the mirror shot back with a knowing smirk.
“Very well, Potter. I see that you are sincere in your repentance and I suppose I can be a good person here and accept your apology with grace and goodwill.”
Seemingly satisfied that Draco wasn’t going to speak, Harry nodded. “Come here.” he ordered and Draco obediently came to stand in front of him. Harry started babbling at once.
“Well don’t just stand there.” Mrs Weasley said with a quirk of her lips. “Come in child.”
“So you received it after all.” Potter said when he finally tore his eyes away from the hawthorn wand.
Instead of answering his mother’s query, Draco chose to stare at the owl –
“Potter, are you
“Is everyone alive in there?” Yet another voice called from outside the room and the remaining Weasley twin sauntered in with a dark skinned woman who Draco recognized as one of the Gryffindor chasers, Angelina Johnson.
“Oh.”
Granger gave him a tired smile. “Goodnight, Draco.”
“Ginny, get onto his other side and hold him steady while I
Granger visibly shook herself and then smiled at Weasley. “Yes, I believe you already mentioned his seating arrangement.” She looked sharply around the room which was still filled with smoke animals and creatures and then turned her gaze on the children. The scene before her looked harmless enough in Draco’s opinion. The girls were still huddled around him, examining each other’s and their own hair with the hand mirror he’d conjured up. The boys were also sprawled nearby as he’d been in the middle of a tale about the time a peacock had chased Greg around the gardens. Lily was still on his lap though she looked like she was about to doze off, one chubby hand holding tight to his shirt and of course Hugo was still camped on his head.
owl, seeing as how he’d selected an empty cage, but then he caught sight of said cage and the words died in his throat because there
“So Malfoy, have to be somewhere or would you like to join us?” Ginevra asked in a genial tone. “We’re headed to get some perfume for my mum and I’m sure you’d be able to find some to suit Mrs Malfoy as well.”
Draco looked down at his lap. “I already know I’m a disappointment. You don’t need to bring perfect Potter into our home to show me just how much of one I am.”
“Who knew you had such a dangerous childhood,” Weasley said with the first friendly grin he’d ever directed Draco’s way. “And I thought mine was bad with the twins as brothers.”
“But–”
“So,” his mother continued. “How is Mr Potter? I heard you helped him pick out robes yesterday?”
“What about you? You’re looking paler than usual actually. Are you alright?”
Draco gave a pleased smile. “Why, thank you, Potter.”
“Hear hear!” Blaise cheered. “Pity for little Astoria though. She was quite besotted with you if I remember correctly. A sweet thing really, unlike her sister.”
“Yes, Draco come.”
Potter finally pulled away with a final soft suck, and then took possession of Draco’s mouth again. Draco’s lips felt swollen and bruised, but he welcomed the pain. It made it all the more real; that he was actually being ravished by the man he was probably in love with. He had strong arms around him and the scent of woodsy shampoo surrounding him. He was kissing Potter. He was kissing Harry. He was…
Harry held his hand as they walked back to the rest of the party. James had gotten over his anti-kissing fit and stated gravely that while he shared Al’s sentiments when it came to Draco becoming a part of the family, he would not want to see any more ‘yucky kissing’, so could they kindly not do it in front of him again. To tease him Harry had swiftly leant over to give Draco a quick peck and James had screamed in outrage and took off back to the others.
Draco couldn’t really blame Potter for his scepticism, but that didn’t stop it from hurting. He might not have realised that they were almost finished but he
She met it with one of her own. “Try me.”
“Draco dear,” his mother’s voice broke into his reverie. “I think I’m ready to go in.”
The movie begins a few minutes later and Harry is soon clinging onto Draco as tightly as Draco is clinging onto him. He hasn’t expected the movie to actually scare him, but bloody hell is it creepy. He’s surprised Draco hasn’t begged him to turn it off yet, considering he can’t seem to stop shaking.
Draco held up his hand for silence. Once it was given he tapped his chin with his wand. “From what I understood, most of those suggestions would cause a mess again. Why not do something for quiet?”
“Of course I’m sure,” Harry replies, taking off the white t-shirt he’d chosen for this occasion. He hands it to Dean who sets it down next to his brushes.
“Wait, what? Draco, are you–”
Draco hesitantly placed the end of the balloon in his mouth and his face scrunched up in disgust. The balloon had an utterly
Draco blinked, the anger dissipating in a matter of seconds. “Well, I believe Potter and I just had an argument.”
“If you’d told me you were being harassed, I’d have accompanied you on
Draco yelped loudly as a Stinging Hex caught him on
“We’re pretty forgiving people. Your mother already apologized to Mum for all the things that your family did or said, and I guess that’s enough for me. I’m tired of all the fighting and hate. I’m just so happy to have
“You were laughing and I can’t reach Draco from over here.”
“Were you
. He looked up and Potter was watching him with eyes that shone with pure happiness, his smile wide and true.
It took only a few seconds for all the children to be seated placidly in front of him. Teddy had also come over and Lily and Hugo toddled over to be taken onto Draco’s lap. Draco got himself comfortable and then began, feeling thoroughly in his element now.
“Hey!” Potter sounded affronted for some reason. “I think she just wanted you to carry her. She seems to be rather…fond of you.” he ground out as if he was in pain.
“It’s just…you’re so
Draco gave her a polite nod back.
“Yes.”
“I – I never knew him.”
“Excuse me?”
Draco tried to swallow around the lump that had suddenly lodged itself into his throat. He stared down at the smiling child, left orphaned by the War. Apart from his mother, there wasn’t anyone else in the world that Draco could call his family. Lucius had long since passed away, Azkaban being too much for his health, and Draco hadn’t even come back for his burial. He wondered what it would have felt like to be like Teddy, never knowing the feel of a parents’ love. He looked up and found Potter, laughing at something Albus had said. Potter would understand just how Teddy felt, and Draco suddenly felt ashamed of himself. When they’d been around Teddy’s age, Draco had made it a point to bring up Potter’s lack of parents every chance he had, never once stopping to consider how the other boy would feel.
“Whatever you say.”
There was a beat of silence and finding nothing else to say, Draco turned to leave. “Goodnight then, Potter.”
“Draco…" Potter breathed out softly, and suddenly his lips were on Draco’s and they were warm and soft and wet and everything Draco had ever dreamed of, and everything he could not accept.
“Good.” Potter said, taking Lily back onto his shoulders. “We’ll see you then. Oh, and Malfoy, wear Muggle clothes. Casual.” He smirked when he said this and Draco had a sudden urge to stick his tongue out at him.
Potter shook his head. “The film starts at four thirty and I still have some shopping to do. Meet at the Leaky by half past three? That should leave us with time to spare even though we have to take the tube.”
“Potter, you will keep your hands to yourself!” Draco felt like he would spontaneously combust right then and there.
“Oh, bollocks!” Pansy suddenly wailed. “I wish we were back in the good old days when we’d be lounging by the Lake without a care in the world. I’d be leaning against a tree with Draco’s head in my lap, Blaise sprawled beside him…”
“I’d love to actually, but it’s not worth having an angry Auror after me in the end,” Draco sighed. “I modified the jinx a bit so it’ll wear off on its own eventually. Might take a couple of days though.”
tired after all that running you did today.” He smirked. “You’re almost as fast on land as you are on a broom.”
“Is that why you asked me if I was gay?” Draco asked, their conversation in the attic coming to mind. Potter nodded hesitatingly.
that,” Charlie persisted.
“I may have expected something a bit grander though,” Granger added teasingly. “Like a guest list going up to a hundred. A grand ballroom as the venue. Perhaps with a gold statue of Teddy as the centrepiece?”
“Thank you Weasel–
Draco nodded, a smile coming to his face. “I’d like that, Teddy.” he said softly.
That set the others off and soon the rest of the room was howling too.
Draco shook his head. He hadn’t actually.
It doesn’t take Harry long to come up with the perfect revenge trick and he decides to implement it the next day itself. Draco is still humbled by the mishap in the shower and it’s not difficult for Harry to send him off to deliver pumpkin pies to Narcissa at the Manor. Draco doesn’t seem to suspect a thing, leaving with a bright smile and promises to actually help Harry prep for dinner. Harry almost feels bad about what he’s planning on doing.
“Wait!” Teddy sprang forward and grabbed him before he could make the turn. “You should come over tomorrow for lunch. To Gran’s place I mean. Harry is coming too.” He stared up beseechingly. “Please?” Draco looked over at Potter and saw that he was smiling now.
“Don’t
“He’ll get over it,” Ginny replied flippantly. “Now let’s get this game started! Dad will play referee.”
The girls gasped and even Teddy looked up from his book. The trio by the door froze in their tracks, turning slowly.
.” Draco levelled a hard look on her.
“Chocolate will do, if you have any,” Draco replied shortly, resuming his work.
“Well, that was anticlimactic,” Pansy mused dryly. “After all we did to get them to this point too.”
?” Pansy said in monotone, her expression as blank as her tone.
“How much do I owe you?” Potter asked, reaching into the pocket of the baggy sweater he wore.
The ‘something’ this time turns out to be none other than Draco, who is now squatting down to peer at him in concern, and Harry realizes that he’s slid down the wall onto his arse, and his head is throbbing like crazy.
“Who would have thought
“Isn’t it? I especially like…”
Potter complained frequently about the unfairness of it all, and almost as if his whinging had been answered, suddenly Auror training was put on hold later on in the week. A raid gone wrong had left a multitude of Senior Aurors in the hospital, which meant there was a subsequent drop in active Aurors. There simply weren’t enough Aurors to spare for the trainees and this allowed them whole days to work on the attic until training resumed.
came to a halt in front of him, and once he had gotten over his initial fright…er,
Narcissa let out another huff, and Draco shot her a frown. He wasn’t sure what had gotten into the Weasley girl, but whatever it was, it was not to be encouraged. Mrs Weasley came bustling towards them then, her cheeks still lightly flushed from her outburst.
“Malfoy, you might want to pull your jaw off the ground.” George’s amused voice in his ear had him hurriedly closing his mouth – mortified that it had indeed dropped open – with an audible click. Bill and George snickered.
“Planning on taking a nap, then?”
“If you say so.” Draco couldn’t help saying. He’d forgotten how fun it was to rile Potter up. “And besides,” he continued, shrugging indifferently. “It’s not like I’d have come for it even if I’d been in England. I’m surprised you’d even consider inviting me.”
Luckily for Potter, their stop came up just then and he was able to beat a quick escape, almost leaving Draco and the children behind in his haste to leave the woman behind. Once out of the train, they made their way back to the surface and after walking for a bit longer they came to what Potter pointed out as the film theatre. There was a small compartment at the front and a girl sat in it, passing out tickets in exchange for Muggle money.
involving the War, but his mother thought differently, hoping that discussing what had happened would help them move past it.
“Did I strike a nerve?” Thin Lips jeered and Nasal Voice snorted out a laugh. “Come now, all that rot about you aiding the Saviour reeks of horse shite. You’re nothing more than the wife of a Death Eater, a common whore really. Bet they kept you around just to entertain You-know-who and the rest of his fucking followers. Did Lucius know about that too? Probably liked to watch, sick bastard that he is.”
“I was thinking that if I didn’t take drastic measures, that bastard would take the robes.”
“What are you doing, Ron?” Ginny hissed, glancing at the others in the room. “You’re making a bloody scene, and I don’t even know what this is about.”
Potter sighed. “Come to Dada, Lily. Draco has to go home now.” It was odd hearing Potter use his given name. Odd, but not necessarily bad.
“Come on, Harry, don’t be like
He’s out in the garden a week later, mowing the lawn the Muggle way. Draco has opted to stay inside with the pretence that Harry doesn’t need any help mowing, though Harry knows the real reason is that Draco is scared of the electric mower and the loud sound it makes.
“Good. Now, could we start by cleaning up the room? Pick up your toys please; your parents will be back any moment now.”
. He gazed down at the sleeping child and the feelings that swelled up inside him almost scared him with their intensity. Before he knew it he was smiling widely and was still doing so when he walked out of the room and promptly collided with Potter.
Draco scowled. “Very funny, Potter.”
“What did you do?” Potter gasped.
“I already told you, it’s ‘Harry’,” Potter replied, stepping closer. “And yeah, I do. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, but at least it’ll be interesting.” He tilted his head and gave a small lopsided smile that did strange things to Draco’s heart. “Still want to give it a go?”
, surely he wouldn’t…
“Privately, of course,” Draco hastened to add. “I already spoke with McGonagall, who’s agreed to allow me to pop in to use the library whenever I need, and Granger said that I could contact her for any help as well. I’ll be doing them later on in the year though, not with the others.”
“I can’t possibly do that,” Potter protested immediately. “Please, let me pay you for this.”
George tilted his head. “Are you?”
“Oh, but I’m sure you can stay for dinner. Mum always makes too much food anyways.”
Draco laughed at the absurdity of his statement. “You prefer dry lips?”
Granger hummed thoughtfully. “Ginny mentioned something about this. Apparently we’re bearing witness to the infamous ‘hermit clothes’ which Draco wears when in the comfort of his own room. Ginny quite likes to catch him off guard like this in the hopes of catching a glimpse, and I can see the appeal now. The messy queue is a nice touch, I must say,” she added approvingly.
When they emerged from the path they were greeted by cheers all around, as well as a couple of catcalls and whistles. Draco could see his mother and aunt standing beside Molly and all three women looking on proudly, his mother even pulling out her handkerchief to dab at her eyes. George sidled over and started ribbing Harry at once, teasingly asking when the wedding would be. Harry laughed even while his face went bright red. Ginevra was standing with her sisters-in-law and she raised her glass in a strange salute, blowing Draco a kiss before nudging at Luna who had a serene smile on her face.
close.”
“No problem Malfoy,” Potter said with a smile. “I figured as much so it’s on me.”
The Snitch still hadn’t made an appearance and forty five minutes had already elapsed. The two teams had managed to remain more or less tied in points, but Bill’s team was now beginning to creep ahead. He and Angelina were proving to work startlingly well together, while Weasley was an immovable rock in front of the hoops. Charlie was doing fairly alright considering he’d never played Keeper before, but he had next to nothing on his brother.
Draco clenched his fists. “Good.”
Draco’s breathing became erratic as a bubble of panic swelled up inside him. The rational part of his brain told him to remain calm and think this out clearly. With the Easter holidays upon them, Diagon Alley was teeming with activity, garishly decorated shops luring children in droves with the allure of chocolate and goodies, their helpless parents trailing behind in resignation. It was the simplest of things to get lost in such a crowd and there was no reason for Draco to lose his cool and make a spectacle of himself. He wasn’t about to run around calling for his mummy like a complete ninny.
“Suppose you’re right.” She set the clipper down and began polishing her broom handle. “Did you know that Nev and Harry have the same birthday?”
“When I was walking around the Lake with my friends…” She blushed prettily. “I fell in a hole.”
Eventually they reach the top of the hill, which means that their home is only a couple of houses away. When they are finally walking up their drive, Harry can’t help smiling. It still feels surreal to think that he has a house
“It’s true,” Ginny chimed, stealing a sip from Potter’s mug. “The Sorting hat wanted to put Harry into Slytherin.”
“Malfoy, come on.”
When Draco found Harry, he was leaning back against a large apple tree, a half filled basket on the ground beside him. His eyes were closed but as Draco approached him they shot open, widening marginally when he saw who it was. Draco felt some of the courage leaving him as he was subjected to Harry’s intense gaze but rallied himself valiantly, drawing strength from Ginevra’s words. He would tell Harry exactly how he felt about him. However as usual, Harry beat him to it.
Draco panted loudly and was shocked to find himself moments away from cumming in his pants like a schoolboy. Gripping Potter’s hair with both hands, he dragged him back for a kiss, swallowing his moans and whimpers with relish. Draco’s whole body felt like it was on fire and he was so close now.
. He turned out to be the bastard who didn’t give a fuck about my mother’s harassment complaint.”
“I assure you my mother taught me many things, some of which are the only reason you still remain standing with all your body parts intact,” Draco spat back at him, his fisted hands itching to plant themselves in Thin Lips’ grinning face.
Harry squeaks this time, and sends the snake a scorching glare. “Stop talking to me!”
Bill idly stroked the end of his ponytail before flicking it back. “When my wife heard that you were coming, her exact words were ‘Do not take any nonsense from that snotty Malfoy. You put him in his place if he acts out’. With a French accent of course,” he added with a small quirk of his lips. “So Malfoy, will I have to put you in your place? Planning on acting out?”
His mother didn’t say anything to that but after a moment of deliberation she spoke up again.
“He did not!”
“Mhmm, exactly.” Potter nodded sagely.
Potter took a deep breath. “Okay, bollocks aside. This morning like I said, I told Ginny about how I’d pretty much ambushed you in the middle of the night and acted like an arse. The only reason I told her about it in the first place, was because I really did feel bad about it and wanted to make it up to you but I didn’t know
“You should show her you care then,” Draco muttered half to himself. “You don’t even write.”
“Come on Draco!” James yelled. “The Easter hunt is about to begin!”
Draco tried to bite back a laugh but ultimately failed. “If I spread this little titbit of information around, I’m sure you’d lose your image.”
“Oh, I like that!” Potter shot to his feet, wiping pie off his face with an impatient swipe of his hand. “Who was the one kissing me back, huh? Clinging to me so hard I probably have the finger marks to prove it. Moaning and whimpering and practically
“I’ll be sure to.” Draco promised, sitting beside her.
“We don’t have time for this, child!”
“So, I suppose I should start off the annual Potter-Malfoy family Hogwarts discussion.” Albus began self-importantly. “Not beating around the bush, the wonderful House of Ravenclaw took the House cup this year!”
“Well, I didn’t ask for your opinion in the first place. Now for the last time, will you get off my pillow or must I resort to force?”
Ginny stared at him for a long moment before breaking into peals of laughter.
“Well then, I suppose I’m going to be having a few words with her in a bit. Now get the fuck out of here before I hex your bits off and then turn them into balloon animals so you can watch them float away.”
A hand landed on Draco’s arm and he jumped, but it turned out to only be the Weaslette. “Come on,” she said, tugging at his arm. “Let’s get out of here. Mum’ll finish up with this and join us in a moment.” Feeling as if he’d been sent to some strange alternate universe, Draco allowed himself to be dragged away, his mother following behind with a bemused expression.
He’d managed seventeen counts before having to rush to the nearest bathroom to sick up. When he’d returned to the window, the Death Eaters had left and Draco had gone out to retrieve Tiberius’ abused body, ordering a house elf to bury him in a corner of the garden. He still visited the little grave once or twice a week.
Ginny stared for a moment before closing her eyes with a pained expression. “Trying to understand your thought processes is giving me a headache.”
“Oh Draco, it’s lovely!” she sighed, holding the soft cashmere up against one smooth cheek. “But you really shouldn’t have. I’m in possession of a multitude of scarves as it is, and winter has already passed.”
appreciate your behaviour.”
At that moment the aunt in question glided in. “Teddy, didn’t I tell you not to run?” she asked sternly.
Granger nodded warily.
to him for one thing and had even trusted him with her daughter. To his surprise he realized that given time, he could one day see himself calling her a friend.
“Yes, mum.”
“It was alright.” Draco repeated firmly and the boys stuck out their tongues at him.
Draco let out a breath that he hadn’t known he’d been holding. George suddenly gave him a hard smack on the back, causing him to stumble a few steps forward.
. He pointed accusingly at Potter. “And
After the War, Harry had wanted a pet to keep him company. More specifically, he'd wanted a snake. He’d known how it would look, picking such a companion right after defeating old snake-face himself, but Harry hadn’t really cared what the public would think and all he’d wanted was a pet that he could talk to. However, he’d soon realized that being able to speak Parseltongue really had been all Voldemort, and no matter how much he’d tried, he’d been unable to understand a single hiss from any of the lively snakes in the tank.
Draco pretended to consider this. “I suppose evil birds surpass prankster brothers in terms of danger, but I’d still have paid good money to see the Weasley twins take on the Lucius peacocks.”
“I’m fine. Really.” Draco replied quickly, alarmed by the look in the woman’s eyes. It was the same look he’d seen in his mother’s eyes just before she became an overly concerned parent, fussing and coddling as if he were still five years old.
He shut his own eyes for a moment and then shrugged on the shirt without another thought. He reached for his pants but then turned back to Luna, still sitting placidly on his bed, her eyes trained on him.
Lily suddenly waved her arms in the air, straining away from her mother’s embrace. “Dwaco.
Draco offered him a smirk. “When we walk into that room, prepare for the interrogation of your life.”
“So Draco’s gonna come watch the film with us, Daddy?” Al asked in a hopeful voice.
“All’s fair in love and war.”
“Didn’t you?”
It didn’t. Draco got back to the pies that had been forgotten. “Where are you taking her?”
“I’m not even sure what exactly ‘the tube’ is.” Draco replied. “I take it, it’s some sort of Muggle transportation?”
“I can’t believe it,” he said in a trembling voice. “You’re actually buying him. You’re buying the Little Owl!”
“I really need to get rid of that stupid thing.”
“Unfortunately,” Pansy sighed. “Anyways, you both should be off. Don’t want to keep the Weasleys waiting, right, Draco?” She winked.
Potter laughed. “I’m not so sure Aunt Dromeda would approve of that idea.”
The momentary pleasure at knowing that Potter missed him was quickly quenched by the reminder that Potter still wasn’t well. He’d kept himself updated through his aunt and he knew that although the curse had been removed, it had still left him exhausted, both physically and magically. It made sense that his two best friends would volunteer to look after him.
Weasley turned to his wife with a helpless expression. “It’s Malfoy.” he said as if he could hardly believe his words. “Malfoy’s sitting on the ground of the playroom and he’s plaiting Rosie’s hair. And Hugo’s on his head
Draco weakly returned his smile and then turned away again. Maybe… maybe it would be better if he told Potter how he felt. It would probably ruin their friendship, not to mention his friendship with Ginny. His heart clenched at that. He was going to miss her, maybe even more than Potter.
“No, no, I don’t!” Harry isn’t sure why he’s so freaked out. Maybe he actually is a Parselmouth after all, and it has nothing to do with Voldemort. Still, Harry’s hand shoots up on instinct to touch his scar, half-expecting it to be swollen and pulsing. It isn’t of course, and he lets out a shaky breath. The War is over; there isn’t anything to worry about and he just needs to–
Draco stood up and stretched luxuriously, sighing as his back popped in a satisfying way. “I don’t need a new broom to beat you,” he said, adopting his old, haughty drawl. “I’ll take the old one and you’ll still be eating my tail bristles.”
“I seem to do nothing but ramble when I’m around you,” Potter said with a twinkle in his eye. “Shall we sit and I can explain myself?”
Before Potter could think up a response Al gave a loud giggle and flung his cone at Potter’s head. Luckily for Potter, he still seemed to have his Auror reflexes and quickly cast a shield spell. Unluckily for Draco, it sent the cone flying straight at him to splatter across his forehead. Ice cream dripped down onto his face and when he’d wiped enough out of his eyes to see, Draco saw that while Al looked suitably ashamed and repentant, Potter was laughing so hard he was in danger of falling off his chair. Draco did the only thing that he could have done in such a situation.
“So, how have you been?” Draco enquired politely and then wanted to kick himself. Any fool with eyes could tell that Potter wasn’t doing well.
. Sweet Luna how you have wounded me.”
The days that followed passed in a blur of cleaning and sorting. Draco took Potter to task, firmly demanding that they work interminably each night until exhaustion forced them to stop. Potter had whined plaintively that he needed to get up early for Auror training, but Draco had been unrelenting. If they wanted to finish the job within this century, they needed to pick up the pace. There would be no more chatting in the sitting room until they were done.
best friend consorting with
“Uh huh.” Potter looked sceptical but made no further comment. He went into the room instead and gave Lily a kiss before coming out again, closing the door quietly behind him.
“Ginevra.” Both Draco and Potter said at the same time and again Potter regarded him with a stunned expression.
”, too busy shoving off his seat with a snarl. Instead of breaking the bastard’s nose again, as he was sorely tempted to do, Draco swept out of the kitchen, barely keeping his anger in check.
“Daddy, is Draco scared?” Al asked, tugging on Potter’s shirt.
They’d reached the gates now and as they stepped through them, Draco felt his nerves coming back to him. Pretty soon he’d be faced with a houseful of Weasleys, not to mention Harry would be there.
Draco was too emotionally drained to get into it today and Mercury seemed to get the hint, giving his ear an affectionate nibble before alighting onto his perch. Just as Draco was pulling the coverlet over him, there was a knock at his door. He sat up, calling for whoever it was to enter.
“You said you’d come visit.” James stated blandly, crossing his arms in a pretty good imitation of his father.
Mrs Weasley nodded approvingly. “Good girl.” She turned to the two Malfoys. “Now then, are you alright?” she enquired politely.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy–”
“There isn’t that much left to tell really.” Potter admitted. “Ginny and I got a divorce, and the weird thing was no one made a big fuss about it. Except for the Prophet of course, but they don’t count. The Weasleys were wonderful about it all. Ginny moved out and got herself an apartment. We share custody of the children but they stay with me since Ginny’s work takes her out of the country often. She’s a sports reporter and a bloody good one at that. I quit the Aurors and never looked back. It gave me more time to spend with the kids and I find that not fighting for once is a rather nice way to live.”
“Ron, be grateful that you got a month with her anyways,” Potter chided. “It was nice of McGonagall to give them that, instead of the usual one-week holiday. Seriously, bless her.”
Draco rolled his eyes and was about to say that he wasn’t buying an owl unless it happened to be an
“Yes, I heard you the first time. Strapping apology, Potter. Simply brilliant.”
of this.” his mother said incredulously.
“There’s no need to laugh, Potter,” Draco huffed with a scowl. “I don’t see what the joke is here.”
“And he calls
“Mother, none of this is your fault. Father–”
Potter laughed and then groaned. “Don’t make me laugh again, Malfoy.”
“Do you have a scar?” Louis asked eagerly, but Draco shook his head.
“You silly man, it’s me who should be wondering how someone as amazing as you could love me back.” said Draco, rolling his eyes at Harry’s dumbstruck expression. “And yes, before you ask, I also have feelings for you. Pretty intense feelings actually, but as you’ll soon come to know, I’m dreadfully paranoid and tend to blow things out of proportion. Luckily for both of us, your ex-wife is an interfering harpy and was able to talk some sense into me. Actually I should really get her a fruit basket or something as a thank you gift. Mother always says that –”
“And you went with him?!”
Al grinned from his perch atop his father’s shoulders. The Potter children seemed to like that particular vantage point. “I want ice cream.” he stated with a sweet smile.
“It’s fine,” Draco said, pulling out his wand and releasing Potter from his bonds. “Better, Potter?”
“I assure you, Potter, I have no intention of seducing Ginny or any such nefarious deed. We’re only friends and as you may have noticed in school as well, my female friends often tend to use me as a human pillow, and I tend to allow them to do so. However, if it troubles you so much, I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.
a snob! Who even says things like ‘blasphemous’? I don’t think Ron even knows what that word means!”
“Well I have the unfair advantage of having learnt French from a very young age.” Draco said in Bill’s defence. “I’m sure your children are quite capable of speaking in French even though they normally speak as any English children would.”
Draco let himself be held, allowing the soothing scent of his mother to wash over him. Eventually he gently pushed her away and offered her a tentative smile.
He snatches the pumpkin out of Draco’s hands and smashes the bloody thing onto the stone steps, watching with satisfaction as it violently bursts open, before stalking into the house. He can hear Draco’s indignant cry behind him.
His mother sat down at the edge of his bed, her face softening a bit as she took his hand. “Darling, I’m sorry. You’re right; I should have warned you that we had company.”
Harry decides to ignore him and focus on the task at hand. He slowly creeps his way to the kitchen counter and reaches under it for a large saucepan. He manages to get close to the spider without startling it, and from the corner of his eye he can make out Draco with a hand pressed over his mouth, his eyes wide. Taking a deep breath, Harry bends at the knees and finally places the saucepan over the spider.
“So wouldn’t this work out well?”
The situation – which was already surreal to begin with – got even more surreal as Ginny Weasley instantly placed the squirming girl in his arms, not hesitating even for a second.
“I’m sure it is.”
Draco stared at him in abject horror. “Who
“Yes, but I don’t
“I said to lean on an armchair, not me.” Draco tried to keep his tone as even as possible. He dared not look down, knowing that Potter was probably staring up at him with those goddamn eyes of his.
was to have Potter.
Harry turned away without another word, but Draco caught a glimpse of a face filled with as much anguish as he felt. He watched as the other wizard strode away, disappearing out of sight without ever looking back. Draco blinked frantically, his eyes starting to smart.
“If you can break them, why didn’t you do so earlier?” Draco asked.
Draco felt his jaw drop in an exceedingly undignified manner as Mrs Weasley proceeded to tear a strip off Thin Lips, who was looking decidedly ill now. She’d really worked herself up into a fine rant, and her voice rang through the air; scolding his conduct, his language, and even berating him for having a hole on the sleeve of his robes! Then she turned her attention to the crowd and Nasal Voice, and soon they were all hurrying away with shamed expressions, many of them red with embarrassment as well.
Draco smirked. “Are you trying to tempt me into insulting the Weasel because that’s a game I’m sure to win.”
“Sod off Al-bore.”
Potter sat up with a decidedly awkward cough and adjusted his shirt. Weasley eyed him shrewdly.
Harry gave him a fierce look and he obediently shut up again. “And then we kissed and it felt like I was dying all over again but this time I never wanted it to end, and you called me
But then Potter laughed and the weird tension dissipated so fast, Draco wondered if he’d imagined it all.
“You talk as if you’re some old crone about to keel over any minute.” Draco said with an amused smile.
“Must be nice to be rich,” Angelina mused casually, and just like that the atmosphere of the room was lighter. “Bet you had a lot of fun as a kid with such a big garden to play in.”
“Alright, fine, I suppose that’s a bit drastic. Even I’m not cruel enough to send you back to Bob. Though the ‘plucked and roasted’ threat still remains as long as you stay on my pillow. You’ve already shat on my seventh favourite pair of boots and now I’ll have to send them to be cleaned.”
“I forgot about that part.” Draco laughed and leant in to kiss his frown away.
Draco sent him a grateful look, promptly seeing the mocking words for what they really were – Weasley’s way of diffusing an awkward situation.
“Actually, I only said I would consider it…”
Eventually they seemed to have calmed down and his mother pulled away, dabbing at her eyes with her embroidered handkerchief. Aunt Andromeda turned to him now and he suddenly felt shy, though Merlin knew why.
“Okay, Harry, I think it’s time for bed.” Weasley swept to his feet and hurriedly yanked his best friend away from Draco. “Sorry about that, Malfoy.”
His mother beamed and then turned to him and Potter again. “You boys should wait in the sitting room. We’ll bring you some when we’re done.”
“That’s what I thought,” Draco replied. “Seems they were willing to overlook our involvement in the War since we’d been pardoned and all. Mother handled the matter smoothly enough and now the contract’s been officially destroyed.”
“I’m pretty sure everyone knows his birthday by now,” he shot back dryly. “He
Blaise looked entirely too smug for a disembodied head floating in a fireplace. “All that says is that we were so impassioned with each other, we couldn’t even make it to my room.”
exhausted?” Ginny prodded his arm.
“These are the ones made from Aunt Cissy’s batch.”
Draco’s jaw dropped in outrage. “I do not need to be gone easy on!”
“Yes, I do.” This time, Draco wasn’t pretending. He
Still looking at Potter, Draco replied. “I wasn’t very nice to him. I was rather…mean in fact. Not to say that your father was nice to me, I assure you he wasn’t.” he added.
Dean tilts his head critically and then hums. “Yeah, I think that looks good.” He gives a small shiver. “Merlin, Harry, you look pretty horrific actually. Malfoy’s going to have a right fright when he finds you like this.”
“They were just robes!”
To Draco’s surprise, he’d inadvertently started walking back to the Leaky as they talked, and here was Potter, complacently strolling beside him without a care in the world. Draco almost opened his mouth to remind him that cosy little chats weren’t something they did, but he stopped himself as he realised that he was actually
“Pretentious and a mess?” Draco tried to joke but it fell flat even to his own ears.
“Draco, what on earth–” Aunt Dromeda came rushing into the room but froze when she caught sight of him.
Potter regarded him curiously. “What’s got you in such a good mood all of a sudden?”
get murdered though, I call dibs on his wardrobe,” Blaise said quickly. Pansy silently stared at him for a long time and he eventually excused himself to the bathroom.
Draco leant forward and covered his face, not knowing if he should laugh or cry – and then settled on shrieking when Potter’s hand somehow ended up on his arse and gave it a hearty squeeze.
“Obviously I didn’t mean for
Potter winced. “Well, I’m sure he was just busy. You know us grownups, always have something to do.”
rubbish. Ms Joyce had a certain flair for the dramatic and he’d been shocked by the sheer number of ways to indirectly mention a man’s cock.
“Next time, just come with me,” Harry says wryly, “instead of appearing behind me like a fucking spectre. You’re so pale too.”
“Draco, are you sad?” she asked, cuddling up next to him.
“Alright, fine! Christ, you never make things easy for me.” Potter let out a frustrated breath and stepped closer, his voice dropping low as he said, “Ginny told me about how the two of you became friends.”
“Quick question, Malfoy. Are
“So, what are you two talking about?” Weasley asked as he settled down a few feet from where they were. “Kreacher’ll bring up a plate for you all too,” he added.
an owl in it. A tiny owl that had probably been hiding in some corner out of sight until now.
He heard his mother take a sharp intake of breath beside him and suddenly she was pushing past him in a rush, her arms wrapping around the older woman with a fervour that Draco hadn’t known she had. His aunt returned the hug with as much passion and for a moment all the witches did was to hold each other, sobs muffled into the others’ hair. Draco could do nothing but stand uncomfortably by as they exchanged rushed words and tearful smiles.
Harry sighs and proceeds to clean the pumpkins as instructed. It’s tiring work but he gets it done in the end, and twenty four pumpkins and an hour later, Draco is satisfied.
Through it all, Weasley snickered to himself.
Draco thought the game sounded rather stupid but
Weasley was muttering something about getting a camera and Draco tried to sound as firm as he could when he spoke to Potter.
The familiar voice had Draco springing up and away as if he’d Apparated, and sure enough, he looked down to see Ginny Weasley staring back at him furiously.
He gave a shaky laugh. Sharp as a tack this one was. “Why would you think that?”
agreed to this. A game of Quidditch was one thing, but actual conversation? It was next to impossible when every other word that came out of his mouth reminded everyone of what he’d once been – of what he’d
“Potter, you fucker,” Draco snarls, springing to his feet and towering above Harry in a menacing manner. Harry wiggles his eyebrows playfully.
Draco watched as Charlie easily lifted Ginny’s prone figure, hardly jostling her at all. She mumbled something to herself but otherwise didn’t stir.
“What’s the matter, Death Eater, a little water too much for you to handle?” the boy taunted, face scrunching up in a piss-poor attempt of a sneer. Draco personally thought that it looked more like he was suffering from a bad stomach-ache but he benevolently kept it to himself.

Blaise tried for a nonchalant smile. “Come on, whatever it is cannot be
what the gesture meant. “Has this happened
The resulting violent shudder and grimace are answer enough and Harry pushes Draco none too gently aside as he exits the bathroom, the towel slung low on his hips. He has a feeling this will be Draco’s last trick, but right now he’s not in the mood to appreciate that. Instead his mind is whirring with ways to get Draco back.
get you to beg for it. You wanted it, don’t even try to deny it now.”
“I was wondering, did you have to go shopping for those clothes? I never pegged you as the type to own jeans.”
“Of course, Malfoy. Of course.”
“Well, I believe the picture speaks for itself.” Draco replied with a smirk. Whoever had taken the picture had done a bang up job indeed. It clearly depicted a chocolate ice cream covered Draco laughing as his vanilla missile hit Potter squarely on the nose, splattering onto his glasses, while Al laughed in the background. The thing that Draco loved the most about the photo was the fact that Potter’s irritated frown morphed into a brilliant smile and the beginnings of a laugh could be seen right before the photo panned back to the beginning.
Making a score of hasty excuses that he couldn’t even remember later on, Draco practically ran out of the shop. He hurried away, blindly bumping into witches and wizards alike. Many of them cursed at him and even shoved back, but Draco was numb to it all. He plodded on until eventually he came to a more abandoned part of the alley. The shops here had long been out of business and no one was there at the moment. Only then did he lean against a nearby wall and take a shaky breath.
“After she’d gotten over her little hormonal fit, she practically threw me out, telling me to have a good time with the family and that I deserved a break.”
“Well I couldn’t leave you to undertake this demanding task alone.” he replied teasingly, making his way to him. “So pray tell, what has the Golden boy on his knees?”
, he couldn’t see him as anything else.
“Potter, why are you doing that?”
“Well, here we are,” he said aloud when they reached his set of rooms, gesturing out with his arm and feeling a tad silly as he did so.
“I think you can truthfully tell your mother that I am indeed ‘stuffed’. I think I even have a belly bulge!” He scrutinized his stomach thoughtfully. “I’ve never had one before.”
something to be taken lightly. Still, Draco couldn’t back out now after coming this far – and he really didn’t want Granger storming his room again – so he steeled himself, swung the door open with a flourish and stepped in.
“Thank you, Mrs Malfoy, but I really should be off.” Potter got to his feet and nodded at them. “I’m sorry for disturbing you both so late.”
“Of course, Master Draco. It wouldn’t do if Kreacher was to burn your dinner.”
Draco stared at the piece of paper in his hand as he strolled down the street to Potter’s house.
“More like he lived abroad for most of his life,” Potter replied. “Didn’t you catch a bit of an Australian undertone to his accent?”
Once Potter reached the base of Draco’s neck, he nosed at the neck of his jumper, nudging the loose material to a side until he’d bared one pale shoulder. Potter buried his face in the warm juncture between Draco’s neck and shoulder and bit down hard enough to make Draco let out an embarrassingly high-pitched keen. Potter licked gently at the stinging bite as if in apology, and then proceeded to suck at it, this time consciously and painstakingly marking him. Draco moaned at the attention Potter was giving to the now oversensitive patch of skin; he’d never known that the act of someone physically marking him could be such a turn-on.
