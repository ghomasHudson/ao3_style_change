“But there’s no hitting in the Granger-Weasley family!” Hugo said, looking distressed. “Is Rose allowed to hit me now?”
“Oh.” Draco stopped pounding on Harry’s back, considering this. “Well, fine. If you must, have your dastardly way with me.”
“Believe me when I say I know what you’re going through, sweetie. But you can’t live your life being afraid of your own shadow! From what I’ve heard, you’ve already dealt with buckets of darkness and it’s time for you to get some sunshine-y goodness up in here!” Jonathan pats Draco on the arm and moves back behind him to continue cutting his hair. “Plus, mama ain’t blind! I see how you two are around each other. And the viewers at home won’t need to hear you say you’re in love with him when they’ll be able to see it for themselves.”
“That means it’s time to spill the beans, boys! Where are your bedrooms?” Jonathan claps his hands in glee.
“Thank you all for coming! Chag Sameach, as we say in Hebrew. I’d like to extend a special welcome to our newest guests, the Malfoys!” Saul said to the assembled mass of people now seated at the magically-enlarged dining room table. “Once again, our Harry has outdone himself. He’s spent the past three days cooking this feast, and it is absolutely delicious.” There was a murmuring of agreement around the table. They’d prayed, they’d sang, they’d told the story of Passover; it was almost time for dessert and for the children to find the afikomen, but Saul had taken the opportunity to make his annual speech. “When I first met Harry, he was nothing but skin and bones. And now look at him! He’s getting a gut!”
“Teddy seems like a delightful kid,” Karamo adds. “Tomorrow, you two will meet Tanny for some shopping, and then you’ll both meet up with me and Teddy for an afternoon adventure. We’ll bring Sir Bites A Lot along with us, so it’ll be a full family outing!”
When he’d informed his mother of his impending divorce and relocation, she’d merely raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow and commented, “How thoroughly modern,” before returning to her needlepoint.
Harry put up his hands, not wanting Malfoy to continue in his description. “I honestly don’t want to know.”
Potter nodded. “Yes, those are all my children, actually. The tall one with red hair is James, the one with dark hair like mine is Albus, and the little girl is Lily. And that’s their Zayde, the man with the newspaper. His name is Saul.”
“You’re right, love. Tonight is about celebrating our family. And eating latkes. And watching Pansy clean out everyone’s pockets at dreidel again.” Harry took Draco in his arms, enveloping him in a tight hug. “I still can’t believe you’re going to be my husband.”
“I’ve dressed up as Celestina Warbeck for the past four Halloweens, Harry. Why would I be upset about putting on women’s garments?”
He heard slow footsteps descending the stairs, and he rolled his eyes. Al’s favourite passive aggressive action was to stomp down the steps as slowly and loudly as possible to let everyone within earshot know just how upset he was.
“I had no idea you were all wizards,” Hermione admits, extricating herself from the hug Karamo had pulled her into.
“Scorpius, I said that I’d talk to Harry about having a sleepover. Please don’t twist my words,” Draco said, looking apologetically at Harry.
Jamie scoffed. “I know there isn’t anything wrong with being gay. Or with loving who you want to love. But just because we know that it doesn’t make people stop bugging us at school.” Jamie spoke quietly, still not looking up at the rest of his family.
Granger scoffed and rolled her eyes. “Not only am I a Trainee Healer, Malfoy, but I am also a war veteran with PTSD symptoms of my own. I know one can’t control one’s panic attacks.” She was sitting facing Draco, her legs crossed and an unimpressed expression on her face.
“I’m a creature of habit, you know this about me,” Draco replies, smiling over his shoulder at Harry.
“My mistake,” Draco replied, looking at her seriously. “Why don’t you show me what a superhero would wear to a nice dinner? Perhaps trousers and a bowtie?”
? And what if she’s not? I didn’t know that wrackspurts and butterflies’ hovering habits were pregnancy tests.” Draco set his mug down on the kitchen island and fiddled with his engagement ring. “And I thought that tonight was going to be about our announcement,” he said quietly.
Teddy pets Troglobite, who’s clouded eyes are looking around curiously. “Um, I dunno. I mean, I just… I just want them to be happy with me and with our life together. I don’t want them to think that they were happier before they took me in.” Teddy keeps his gaze on Trogs.
Ron claps his hands, calling the group to attention. “Right! Yeah, thanks, Hermione. I know it sounds like a lot, but honestly, there’s no family more deserving of happiness than this lot.”
“You can handle the Howlers yourself, then.” Harry opens the door to their bedroom to reveal Teddy and Troglobite, both dressed up for the party: Troggy is wearing a small bowtie and is trying desperately to get the cone-shaped party hat off of his shaggy head. Teddy looks like a combination of his dads, donning khaki trousers and a short-sleeved button down shirt with a bow tie that matches the dog’s.
“We married each other for our bits, actually. She wanted an heir as much as I did, but we’re both gayer than Christmas. So we appeased our families and married. And Scorpius is the single best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“Don’t say anything yet, OK?” Harry said, holding up one hand to stop Draco responding. “I just need to say my part, yeah?”
“I’ve never worked in a kitchen with a house-elf,” Antoni says, looking uncomfortable. “I feel like I’m invading his space.”
Draco snatches the offending garment from Harry and stuffs it into the pocket of his robes. “Ta ever so much for your approval,” Draco says sarcastically, looking ruffled. “Well? What are you all looking at?” He snaps.
Draco leaned over the cauldron, keeping careful count of the number of widdershins stirs he was making with his wand. He straightened up and removed his goggles, writing several lines in his notes. He sighed and brushed his hair out of his eyes, pausing to wipe the sweat from his brow. He had adjusted the climate charms in his laboratory to keep the tropical plants he was working with happy, and he was currently in his shirtsleeves but was seriously considering stripping down to his pants.
I sigh, letting my head drop between my arms. “What do you want, Harry? Do you want to fuck me? Do you want me to suck your cock until you come all over this pretty lace?”
“Love, do you still think I’m going to chuck you out someday? Just up and say, ‘oh well, thanks for the delightful shags and I appreciate the help parenting those kids but, ciao!’?” Harry had apparently heard Draco’s last words and he sat down at the table, taking Draco’s hands in his own.
Draco’s head was buried in his arms and he tried to present his arse more fully for Harry’s ministrations. Sweet Merlin but he loved it when Harry did this; when he opened him up with his tongue and his spit and made him feel cherished and a bit dirty all at the same time.
“Whom’s. And it’s your father’s arse that’s being objectified,” Draco replied, pulling Lily to him and pressing a kiss onto the top of her head. “It’s quite lovely and Ms Goldblum would like nothing more than to get her hands on it.”
[The scene cuts to the guys, plus Ron and Hermione, standing in a darkened entrance hall. Hermione conjures her Patronus and sends it away with a message for Harry.]
“That is the cutest thing I’ve ever heard and I have three nieces! Sorry girls, Uncle Bobby loves you the most though!” Bobby adds, grimacing at the camera.
Ron smiles and puts his arm around Hermione. “She does all of our thinking. Any and all questions should be directed to her.”
Harry shook his head. “No, not really. I haven’t been sleeping well lately and I don’t think coffee will help.” He chose a seat at a small, round table and sat down. “I’m Harry, by the way. But, err, you already know that.”
“Harold Amelia Bedelia Buckingham Potter the third,” Jonathan says seriously. “You’ve known Draco for most of your life. You’ve been raising a child together for over six years! You’re in love with the man. I think you know him very well. Even if, for some unknown reason, he didn’t return your feelings - which, if he doesn’t, then Meryl Streep didn’t deserve an Oscar for her portrayal of Miranda Priestly and
“You charmed the heart right outta me, Draco Malfoy!” Jonathan looks gleeful. “You were obvi a gorgeous hunk before, but now you’re ten, ten, tens across the board!”
Suddenly Malfoy began to laugh. “Salazar, Potter. Untwist your knickers! I’m just having some fun.” Harry gave a half-hearted chuckle and took another drink.
“Oh, whatever. This is going to be broadcast across the wizarding world, and I look like … well, I look like I’m wearing your clothes.”
“I have the utmost respect for people who can master those devices, but I certainly don’t see a future for myself in such things.” Draco smiles. “Besides, I have Harry to navigate it all for me.”
“Oh, bugger!” Harry cursed, starting at Ginny’s voice. “Jamie! Al! Lily! Your mum’s here!” he yelled, pointing his wand at his throat to make his voice heard up the stairs. “In here, Gin!”
“OH THE LOVE OF CIRCE, JUST FUCK AND GET IT OVER WITH!” Someone near the fire, possibly Neville Longbottom, who was definitely no longer Harry’s friend, yelled over to the two of them. A loud round of applause broke out in the Common Room, along with shouts of, “Please! Give us all some peace!” and, “Just admit it!”
Harry and Pansy talked about their experiences growing up. Harry told him about the bullying and the blatant favoritism. Pansy talked about the pressure her parents were already putting on her and how she does not really feel like they cared about what she did. They got tea accompanied to the biscuits and then they chased down the cart and got plenty more sweets. When they were going back to their seats, a boy spotted Pansy and chased her down the hall.
"Hey, Draco, what do you want?" she asked casually, opening the first box of candy she had close to her, pouring them into the emptied tin so it would be easier to share with Harry.
"What in the world are you going on about?" He felt a little angered. Granted he had not talked to Hermione or Ron for a few weeks and ignored all letters and phone calls. But they were everything. They were also all he had left.
Gossip around the office was not as discrete as people believed it to be. It was around the desks of the field Aurors. The common work area of the interns. The kitchen when Harry is not in it. People would talk. 'Did you hear that Harry Potter was getting a divorce?' 'Did you hear that all of his kids will still live with his ex-wife?' 'I am certain that he did not leave last night.' They were right but that did not change that he did not want to hear it all.
"I don't know. This was where you wanted to have supper. I shall put on the kettle. I did deprive you of your tea." She said as she started the light the fire. The sight of a woman in high heels making a fire in Hagrid's little cabin making a fire was not something he thought he would ever see but here he was.
Draco's jaw dropped. But he could say anything else, Pansy chocked on one of the Jumping Jellies and sit it out on Draco.
Life makes promises. Growing up with the Dursleys was not easy, but it kept expectations low. But then everything changed when one innocent morning, a few hundred owls delivered a very important letter. Suddenly life had offered him too many promises of a future unknown. As he lived his life and grew, life offered new promises. It started with friends. Then an opportunity to be a skilled athlete. The promise of a long and happy future with a beautiful girl. The promise of finishing school and getting his dream job. The most tantalizing of all promises was the promise of becoming a hero. A hero he was. Everyone recognized him for it. He would still have people come over to him, telling him that he is their role model. They want to be like him. However; being someone else's hero was the worst job one could have when they no longer felt like they could do a single good thing for anyone.
Harry did not notice that she had taken a box with her. "I did not want them to get any of these. They don't deserve any after what they did to my hair."
After a half-hour or so, a girl walked past where Harry sat and he noticed because she was crying. Harry looked toward her who was looking back into the hallway she ran from. She was drenched in water.
Everything she said seemed so possible. So real so true. He could almost hear Hermione's disapproving voice at the door, beating her knuckles against the door to his office. He could hear Ron next to her asking Harry to open the door.
The image changed. As Harry approached Platform 3¾, a woman caught her leg in the gap between the train and platform, sending everything in her arms flying. She twisted in pain and cried stopping everyone around her. Young Harry lingered to help her gather all her things. It was enough time for all the Weasleys to have left. Harry had not met Ron and he did not ask if he could sit with him. He passed his cabin because he saw that Harry was already sitting with Pansy Parkinson. She was telling him something while showing him some necklace she had and sharing the cookies she had. Eventually, Draco passed by. He almost passed by completely but Pansy stuck her head out and called him to join them. The scene changed. They were all older. Fifth-year or so. But all three of them looked different from how he remembered them being in the fifth year. Harry's hair was shorter. He approached Draco with Pansy at his side. The Draco he knew never rested his head on the grass. He hated anything touching his hair. That is when Harry noticed a green tie around his own neck. Younger Harry kicked Draco playfully. He just looked up and laugh. An innocent expression he had never seen on his face.
"All of these people needed to live. They would have lived. Some of them might not have played the same role that they played in your life that they did but they still would have eventually reached you. You are fated to meet no matter what happens. But this is the wrong timeline. However, since this is the time that passed, we have no right to change your past without your consent. We do our best to be civil this way. Now, Mr. Potter. I am here to offer you a choice." She took out the golden key, "You can return to your time where I left you in your office. I promise it gets better. You will go through with your divorce regardless. You will sleep at work for a few days. Until Ron and Hermione come banging on your door. They will make you use your vacation days that you avoided using. They will make you come with them to their home in the country. You will spend days remembering the good old times. You will talk about the future. You will cry and tell each other how much you love one another. You will drink so much that Hermione will swear off drinking for a year afterward. You will make it out of it."
There had been too many nights when he would wake up in the middle of the night, in cold sweat. It could be Cedric, Lupin, Serius, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape. So many more. Having Ginny there when he woke up only made everything worse. The world looked grey and there was nothing he could do about it anymore. Fighting was exhausting so it was much easier to drown himself in work and drown himself in alcohol when he would get home. There was purpose and silence.
She did not respond. She just stood there with an extended hand holding the invisible invitation. He did not think it was wise to follow an unknown woman to an unknown location. But that little burst of a stranger appearing in his office and asking to whisk him to a promise of a new adventure. Harry felt like an addict that never recovered, finally getting a fix. That is why he took her hand and left everything he could possibly want to avoid.
Harry left his office, locking it behind him. He got more private about it with time, not letting anyone see the mess or the blanket and pillow always on his couch. New interns walked quietly around him. Some old colleagues would give him a nod that Harry did his best to return. In the tiny little kitchen in the back, Harry emptied out his cup of old tea before rinsing the cup and putting in a new tea bag into it. He got the stove burning with an Incendio. He took his time doing everything from adding four sugar cubes, finding just the right shape spoon, and waiting for the water to boil. He made the resolution that he would finally sign it as soon as he sets his tea on his desk.
Looking back, it was hard to tell when everything started to go wrong. Watching his Godfather die, watching his friends die in a war, being unable to help or even thank the people who placed their life on the line for him, being sent to die. Maybe someone else would have handled it all better but here he was.
"I understand, Mr. Potter. Very few people know about our existence. Not even the Minister. Everyone who is told everything about it is either going to work there themselves or going to forget they ever learned about it." Her voice held some pride, clearly proud of her status. Harry felt a little bit of adrenaline from seeing an unknown woman standing in his office with the promise of secrets.
"It's actually fine," she said and she tried to brush her hair out with her fingers, "my friends got a little happy with their new wands and spilled water on me. I yelled at them but they didn't want to apologize."
Harry examined the woman in front of him. She had short shoulder-length hair in a perfect bob. She wore a black blouse with a loose ribbon and a green knee-length skirt. Her heels were impractically high and polished so well that Harry could see his reflection. The most unsetting thing about her was her wide smile framed by bright red lipstick and unblinking eyes.
Pansy opened the tin and put it on the table between them. "So you also have some horrid cousins?" she asked.
Harry's first question to the tea regards what actually happened on the train. What happened and how did it happen?
"The Ministry of Time has audited you for a meeting. We very rarely invite people to join us for supper but you are a fine exception. Your life has touched an impressive amount of other people's lives. Would you care to come with me?" She offered a hand politely and threw floo powder into Harry's private chimney.
And suddenly he was just looking at a plain mug of earl grey. Harry felt so lost. There were so many thoughts in his head that he could not gather them together. The lady smiled softly.
Harry took the same seat he had taken in his first life. He looked at the rolling English countryside. Harry was nervous but Hagrid's words were comforting to him. There was a path to be followed and he did not have any immediate questions that held him back. He was so focused on the window that he did not see Ron stop at his door. He was about to speak up and say something to him but his shyness picked up as he had no idea who he was. Looking back into the hallway, he spotted Dean and remembered having met him at one of his father's work events that he was forcibly dragged to. Ron moved on and Harry never realized that he was there.
She offered a hand to shake and Harry was a little taken aback since he was under to girls never shaking hands. But he took her hand and shook it.
"I talked to them. They said they will apologize. Just come back," Draco said, not really noticing Harry at first.
Harry looked back at the mug of tea. His first thoughts were: It was so much easier to like Draco when he is brought down from his posh pedestal and gets to look like a normal human who got spit on. The second: the Tea of his Life could use some sugar.
The woman produced a folder out of thin air and handed it to Harry. He took it suspiciously. The contents of it made his blood turn cold. The file contained death certificates. Remus Lupin. Cedric Diggory. Sirius Black. Nymphadora Tonks. Severus Snape. Albus Dumbledore. Fred Weasley. The file contained their pictures and information about how they died.
Heading back to his office, he unlocked it and slipped back inside with mug in hand. As soon as he closed his door, he jumped, spilling half of the cup's contents on the floor and his leg. A woman he had never seen before was standing in the middle of the room. He knew he had wards from people apparating into his office. But here she stood.
"Why are we here?" he asked her. Just being there, he felt so much lighter. Everything felt a little bit smaller than he remembered. But it smelled the same, it looked the same, it felt the same.
Harry sat in his private office, throwing and shuffling around different papers. Once he clearer up one spot, a mess would form in another place. He knew that ultimately he was avoiding the paper lying on top of the largest stack. Divorce papers. He could not put in words why it seemed so difficult to sign it. It was all he needed to do. Write his name, the date, and a signature. Nothing more. This was a mutual decision. They agreed that this was for the best. They had a plan of who lives with whom and when they travel around. He did not hate Ginny. She did not hate Harry. But neither loved each other anymore. Ginny deserved better. Harry wanted to be alone.
“Your forgiveness,” he said to Miss Lovegood once Madam Joylove had quit their table, “and honesty have not been taken lightly. I owe you my thanks.”
“Yes. And as many dances as you will afford me after the first.” His gloved thumb brushed Harry’s bare wrist. “I did not know when you wanted to tell the world, but I am ready when you are. And I would happily tell them tonight.”
“It is difficult being Harry Potter. The pressure weighs upon him. But he has been different lately. Happier. Distracted, even. And you seem to be the only new variable in the equation.”
“No,” he said, taking another before sitting down. “Do not bother. It may be best to let such annoyances pass to aid our end goal.”
Draco took a deep breath. “It seemed the logical thing to do as we are now working together to raise funds for the The Patronus Charity.”
“Yes, I see Mrs. Malfoy often at charity events,” said Mrs. Granger-Weasley. “Please send her my regards.”
. He sat down with Rita Skeeter just this afternoon to discuss our work with Harry Potter’s charity.” He gave his mother the smallest, most imperceptible glare he could without attracting attention. He knew very well that she had purposefully pivoted the conversation as to not offend their pureblood sensibilities.
He shrugged, pulling at Draco’s shirt from the waistband of his trousers. “I do not need a wand for much these days.”
“Technically you are my first cousin, once removed, but Grandmama told me that saying ‘cousin’ was fine too.”
“Draco, this is business. Your personal feelings about Mr. Weasley are not as important as your plan.”
Draco cleared his throat. “Our social calls have been pleasant. I am happy to hear that he feels the same.”
He had expected no consideration from the Wizengamot; Draco knew too well that he and his mother would be rotting in Azkaban if not for one key witness.
“Sit down,” Mrs. Malfoy said. She sat herself in the armchair next to the chaise and looked at him expectantly until he did as he had been told. “Draco, she is… not ideal.”
“Since we parted, I have done everything in my power to remove every obstacle standing in the way for us to be together. I told the woman to whom I might have married that my heart belongs to another.” Harry’s eyes flashed when he said it, and it made Draco’s heart leap. “My mother and I introduced her to several people in whom she could find advantageous courtship, so that I would not leave her abandoned. She was good-natured and understanding and any person would be very lucky to have her.”
“It’s not your fault I just—” he turned over onto his back and stared at the canopy above them, “—I tire of being
“Mmm,” she said in disbelief, her eyes cutting to the letter on the floor. “I have guests coming for tea. Next time, close the door and keep your indolence to yourself.”
A woman whom Draco assumed was Madam Joylove came to their table, looking akin to Professor Trelawney’s long lost sister. Wild hair escaped an orange turban cap and the edges of her shawl were burned from, what Draco could only assume to be, too many run-ins with kettle fires.
“The wards have been disarmed, Mr. Greengrass,” the auror to the left said, and Mr. Greengrass stepped to the side and motioned for them to come forward.
“You know,” Draco said, lifting his arms to allow the magic to pull his shirt over his head. “I am choosing to ignore that the most powerful wizard in the world is only three and twenty years old and is currently undressing m—”
Blankets were spread under a large oak tree, complete with a large spread of cold meats, cheeses, and fruit. Potter walked forward and perched himself against the trunk as if he often time under its large, outspread branches. It was a nice spot, Draco thought, and he could easily see Potter coming here to escape the eyes and expectations of the Wizarding World.
He wondered if Potter was in a similar predicament. He was not a pureblood, but he was still a gentleman of means. Surely they shared the same duty. Draco frowned. Potter had never mentioned a courtship, and the only woman he had seen him with was Mrs. Granger-Weasley. Was he courting a woman? Was he courting
The question surprised Draco. It was easy to forget that there were people all over the world who had not been subjected to Harry Potter in one way or another for the last three-and-twenty years. “Well, he has always been brave and loyal and all of those other annoyingly decent traits. Determined.” He lip quirked upward. “Stubborn. Self-sacrificing to an aggravating fault. And now that we’re older, much more quiet and private than when we were boys.”
“Oh,” Draco replied, color tinging his cheeks. He hastily looked at his plate. “Yes, one could say that.”
Mrs. Granger-Weasley sat up in her seat with a smile. “Oh, that sounds fascinating. I would love to read it.”
“Of course. Nothing but the best for a Malfoy,” Mr. Stone responded. Draco might have taken that as a compliment as a boy, but it felt like a jab now. He clenched his jaw instead of saying something he might have regretted. The shopkeeper went to the back room to retrieve it for him and returned a few minutes later. “Anything else?”
As he entered the dining room for breakfast, he saw his mother for the first time since their quarrel, and he gave her a nervous smile.
“And yes, you could say that we didn’t get on very well for the first, oh seven odd years of knowing each other?” More laughter, and a few comments rang out across the room. “Ok fine, yes, we absolutely hated each other. But I think deep down I was still that eleven year old - even when we were hexing the living daylights out of each other - jealous of the confident wizard with the pointy chin.” Harry looked down at the floor, trying to gather his thoughts. He shook his head as if to clear it, and looked up to meet Draco’s grey eyes. “When you wrote me that letter a few years after the war, I knew you had grown up. And I had, as well. You told me all about your community service, and learning about Muggles, and apologised for everything that happened during the war in that roundabout way of yours. I didn’t respond to the letter, because I wasn’t sure what to say. I was tempted to write you back, of course, to tell you all about my own experiences, but I was afraid. And it was easier for me to just put things in drawers and not think about them, back then.
“So am I allowed to kick Charlie Vance in the penis?” Lily questioned, her eyes alight with something that made Harry a bit nervous.
Draco waited, unsure if he was meant to follow Harry into the closet or stay seated. After two and a half years, though, he was used to Harry’s rash style of decision making.
“This is going to be a thing now, isn’t it? You ordering me to use my wandless magic to make your life easier?”  Harry waved his hand, casting a
[Camera shows Harry, Draco, Teddy, Karamo and Antoni standing in front of the large butcher-block island in the kitchen with an array of ingredients laid out in front of them.]
“I used the Malfoy library to research the Potter family and was able to track down the location of his great grandfather’s birth. Since then, Harry has been experimenting with some South Indian recipes to get more in touch with his roots.”
“Before I school you in everything about the Divine Mrs Warbeck, I just want to leave you with this question: if Teddy came to you, extolling the virtues of someone he’d fallen madly in love with, but was afraid to confess his feelings, what advice would you give him? I find it very hard to believe that you’d tell your son to lock his love away.”
Hermione puts up her hand. “A few things, before we go in. As you know, Teddy nominated his dads. Harry knows you’re coming, but it’ll be a surprise for Teddy. And, we thought it best not to warn Draco, as he would most likely have left the country or locked himself in his bedroom for the duration of filming. He’s…a bit dramatic.”
Draco dropped his head back and Harry groaned loudly, letting the hot, wet heat swallow him. He usually gave Draco a few moments to adjust, but Draco pushed all the way back immediately and began fucking himself on Harry’s dick.
[the camera watches the Fab Five leave the kitchen, and then pans back for a final shot of Draco and Harry, who are still sitting at the table. Their heads are bent in conversation, and both men are smiling at each other.]
“Dunno, mate.” Ron had remarked at dinner last night. “Tony’s alright, and his handwriting is perfect. He doesn’t mind setting up the Total Station in the morning, and he’s actually pretty funny.”
Harry laughed, remembering Malfoy’s ashen face when he returned to the common room after having witnessed whatever it was between Hermione and Ron. To this day none of the parties involved would disclose what precisely Malfoy had seen.
A chorus of high-pitched giggling broke out behind him. Draco turned to see Scorpius and the Potter children watching them and laughing. The old man had put down his newspaper and was watching the scene from behind a pair of half-moon glasses. He looked highly amused, but was apparently able to keep his mirth contained.
[Footage of Harry and Draco standing side-by-side in the kitchen, chopping vegetables and chatting, often looking at each other and smiling. Teddy sits at the table completing homework, while Kreacher stands in the corner muttering to himself and throwing angry glances at the camera.]
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked, closing the door to keep the temperature steady in the room.
Draco felt himself blush, but he tried to cover his embarrassment with his trademark snark. “Yes? Keep going, by all means. I never tire of others extolling my virtues.”
“Je sais, mon chouchou.” Draco responded, placing a hand on his son’s small shoulder. “Mais, en anglais s’il vous plaît. Perhaps we can speak to the young man again when we’re done eating.” Scorpius’ expression brightened and he nodded at his father.
“Don’t worry, Teddy, I’m sure you’ll get used to it. My husband and I are very affectionate at home, and my boys don’t mind. It’s good to have parents who show their love for each other and not just for you.”
“I’ve been extremely lucky in my life, finding family and friends to support me.” Harry took a drink of his tea. “And of course there were the years and years of therapy.”
“Love you, Draco.” Harry runs his fingers over the lace at the top of my stockings. “Hell of a Tuesday night.”
“Why did you run away after you told Draco you loved him?” Teddy demands once he’s again seated at the table. His face is scrunched up into a grimace. “You’re not supposed to leave a room until a discussion is finished,” he admonishes.
“Language! And, err…” Harry scratched his neck and looked down. “We… we were. Informed of it. The school sent an owl, but I didn’t want you to fly off the handle and make a big deal of it so I didn’t say anything. They disciplined that Vance kid, so I didn’t think there was much more to be done.”
Teddy giggles, and Karamo pulls out a large bundle of colorful fabric from behind the picnic basket. “OK, enough serious talk! Who wants to fly a kite?”
I groan despite myself. Harry’s casual displays of complicated magic never cease to impress (and arouse) me. Single-item summoning spells like that shouldn’t work—the knickers should tear or pull me with them. But, Harry being Harry, they appear perfectly intact in his large, tanned hands.
“No, Lily,” Answered Draco, a small smile playing at his lips. “No matter how much you may feel someone deserves to be kicked in the penis, violence is only acceptable in three situations.”
“Wow! You look great!” Teddy yells, jumping up. “Draco, you look like a movie star with those sunglasses on!”
“Err, sorry about the silencing spell, but we needed some privacy,” Harry explains, blushing slightly.
The seminars were taught by visiting lecturers from various backgrounds and institutions. They first tackled basic muggle history and then moved on to more nuanced topics like art, technology, and entertainment. They went on trips to the British Museum, the War Rooms, and to the Tate Modern; they were tasked with cooking and cleaning without their wands; they visited hospitals and laboratories to see how muggles had not only survived in a world without magic, but had thrived as well. Draco quickly found out that almost all of what he’d been taught as a child were nothing but lies and stereotypes. He was embarrassed and angry, but glad that he had the opportunity to change.
Saul waved a dismissive hand. “My Sophia saved me! She came into the camp with British soldiers to liberate us, posing as a muggle nurse. She found me nearly dead in a bunk, riddled with all manner of disease. She watched over me and nursed me back to health. Fed me matzo ball soup - it was even better than my bubbe’s. The first time I opened my eyes in hospital and saw her, I knew she was my b’shert - my soulmate. My angel.” Saul looked over at Sophia and smiled, taking her hand. “We’ve been together since 1945, if you can believe that!”
“Untwist, Harry! For the love of Merlin.” Draco emerged from the bathroom in a puff of steam, the late afternoon sunlight that shone through the bay windows causing the combination of heat and dust motes in the air to create an ethereal, other worldly setting.
“Thank you for the soup. It’s delicious.” Harry wasn’t sure if it was due to the fact that he’d not had a full night’s sleep in over a week or if Sophia really was peppering her sentences with non-English words.
“Listen, Malfoy. Ever since we started this project you’ve been micromanaging every single thing I do! If you don’t like my excavation style why don’t you come down here and I’ll take notes on
“So it’s a ‘yes’?” Harry said, watching as Draco inspected the inner part of the band that held the stones and inscription.
Malfoy looked up, his lips red and his hair mussed. “First, I want you to keep calling me Draco. Second, I want you to fuck me. Can we do that?”
[Camera pans around a large, old kitchen. Antoni pokes around in the cabinets while Kreacher watches from the corner, wringing his hands and muttering to himself.]
“Well, I was watching your show with my Aunt Hermione, the girl right over there.” Teddy points to where Hermione is now sitting in one of the old leather chairs near the fireplace. “And you are all really good at making peoples’ dads and moms and even grandmas seem so much happier than they used to be. And sometimes I think my dads work too hard. Also, they need to wear different clothes because they are handsome but they hide it. Both of them.”
“Of course I want to be their other father,” Draco said, lifting his gaze to meet Harry’s bright green eyes once again. “I just... I don’t know. I suppose I don’t want to raise my hopes up only to be disappointed. But I love your children. I love
“I’m, fuck, I’m really close, Draco,” Harry warned, fisting Draco’s hair tighter. He felt Harry grow harder moments before he began to come in warm spurts in Draco’s mouth. “Ah, shit!” Harry yelled. Draco spluttered a bit, causing semen to hit him in the chin and cheek.
Scorpius nodded. “And we’ve been very polite to the adults and didn’t exclude the little kids even once! We even found the afikomen with Rose but we let Hugo and Lily find it again so they could get the prize.”
“Oh please, everyone knows where your chocolate stash is,” Hermione raised her eyebrows at Harry, who confirmed this with a nod, “and not only have I apologised for the knickers mix up, but you know I was only concerned that you were stepping out on Harry and I panicked!”
[the camera pans to Teddy, who is looking at his parents nervously and fidgeting with the hem of his aunt’s sweater.]
“Not only is it beneficial for mental health and aids in relaxation, but it also improves one’s flexibility. Immensely. I, for instance, can hook my leg behind my neck. Wanna see?” Draco lifted his head and waggled his eyebrows at Harry, who laughed and rolled on top of him. “Show me,” he whispered into Draco’s ear.
“I’m perfectly suited to taking notes and recording, Potter. I’m only advising you on what I know to be the most effective excavation techniques. My great great great grandfather Orion Malfoy was a gentleman archaeologist, embarking on one of the first wizarding Grand Tours. It’s in my blood - “
“Let’s go let’s go! Everyone is going to be here and you two are taking absolutely forever!” Teddy turns and runs down the hallway.
[Scene cuts to the Fab Five standing in the foyer outside the sitting room with Draco, Harry, and Teddy.]
“Weekends are the best!” Teddy exclaims. “We usually go see my Granny Andy at St Mungo’s but she’s forgetful and sometimes doesn’t remember who I am so I have to remind her with pictures and lots of hugs. Then we go flying, or we go have picnics, or we go to Granny Molly’s and Grampy Arthur’s house to see all my aunts and uncles and cousins because boy do we have a big family. But my favourite is when my dads let me watch a movie. We sit in here with our jammies and eat popcorn and cuddle.”
And I have spent every day of the past two and a half years thanking the universe for shoving us back together. Because you are my piece, Draco. You are that little bit of me that wasn’t complete and I was always looking for you, for my b’shert. And I’ve got you. And I’ll spend every day of the rest of our lives being thankful for your presence. For putting up with my temper and my hair and my impulsive method of decision making. For packing the kids’ lunches and making sure I don’t burn down the house when I try to use the toaster. For loving this crazy family and agreeing to become part of it. I’ll never let you go, Draco.” Harry leaned in and kissed him then, sighing into the familiar feel of Draco’s soft lips.
I clutch harder at his broad shoulders and let out a loud moan when he grabs me and starts thrusting up to meet my downstrokes, gritting his teeth.
Gathering himself, Harry looked down at his own dusty work boots, baggy cargo pants caked with mud, and plain white shirt that stuck to his shoulders from sweat. Malfoy’s outfit, of course, was as pristine as it was on the first day of the excavation. Harry grabbed the hem of his filthy shirt and brought it up to his forehead, wiping the sweat and dirt from his brow. He looked up and saw Malfoy staring at him with his mouth hanging open before his features quickly shifted into his trademark sneer.
“Anyway, as I was saying,” Harry continued, chuckling. “Draco and I are getting married. And I wanted to tell him, and tell all of you, how incredible I think he is and how insanely lucky I am to have him. Draco,” Harry faced his fiance, taking his hands in his own. “I remember the first time I saw you, when we were eleven years old. We were in Madame Malkin’s and I had just been told I was a wizard. I was still in shock, I think, and there you were, confident as can be, nattering on about Hogwarts houses and Slytherin and how you’d off yourself if you were sorted Hufflepuff.”
“I’m going to come,” Draco breathed, spellbound by the sight of them fucking that was reflected in the mirror.
Harry chuckled. “Well, Jamie’s always been a bit mad about Teddy. And Teddy, well, he tolerates him about as well as any pre-teen would tolerate an eight-year-old’s constant owls and requests for his attention.”
[The door to the bathroom opens and Harry steps out. He’s wearing slate gray chinos rolled up at the ankles and a short-sleeved, slightly fitted chambray button down.]
Teddy grabbed Jamie’s hand and kissed his knuckles, smiling up at him from where he was seated. “I promise that I see you as more than a friend, now!” Teddy exclaimed, laughing.
“Well, I suppose we should begin with this ‘makeover,’ then. What exactly does this entail? I warn you, I have little patience for shenanigans and I won’t be signing any waivers without my solicitor’s consent.” Draco stands glaring at the four men who are still standing, his arms folded across his chest.
Scorpius and Al entered the room then, whispering furiously to each other before nodding and approaching the end of the table where Harry and Draco sat.
[Antoni confessional/interview: Harry looks at Draco like he’s hung the moon, and Draco is no better. I can see why Hermione has no doubts about their feelings for each other. How we’re going to get two powerful, stubborn wizards to admit their feelings is another story. I’ve always had luck adhering to the old adage that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach!]
“What did that git Charlie Vance say to you?” Asked Draco, brow furrowing. If it weren’t frowned upon to hex children, he certainly would have done so to that little twit. He had already been the cause of many of Lily’s tears, and Draco was fiercely protective of their only female resident. It made Harry’s heart swell to bursting at the special friendship that the two of them had formed.
“We helped a lot before the guests came!” Al said quickly, “and didn’t complain about it except for once but I apologised.”
[He flicks his wand and the door opens to reveal a large, untidy bedroom, which the group quickly fills. His bay windows look out onto the street and are draped with heavy dark red velvet curtains that are pulled back to allow natural light to flood the room. The walls are painted a creamy white and are cluttered with framed photographs and random drawings clearly made by a child. An old four-poster queen-sized bed has been hastily made, done up with linens in dark reds and golds. A pile of books and a half-drunk glass of water sit on a nightstand. A dilapidated wooden dresser stands unevenly in one corner.]
“Of course it’s not a no! I’m not the one who’s absolutely mental.” He grabbed the box out of Harry’s hand and with his own hands shaking, took the gold band out.
“Do you, erm, still want to do this? Because I do.” Harry asked sheepishly, hoping that Malfoy’s sober mind still wanted what his drunk body clearly did.
“To be fair, Harry, this is a common room, for all of us, so technically he’s allowed to be doing that here.” Hermione reached behind her and retied her hair into a bun at the nape of her neck. It was October, but the humidity had stuck around this year, causing her already unruly hair to further revolt from her attempts at reigning it in.
Malfoy turned to face Harry fully, and whatever snide remark he was surely about to make never made it out of his mouth. Malfoy’s eyes raked up and down Harry’s body, and he seemed utterly at a loss.
“I’m going to give you some direction, and then I’m going to show you how to recreate the style by yourself in the comfort of your own home. I think we’ll leave your stubble for now - it reads as ‘sexy and a little bit dangerous,’ right? Ready, chipmunk?”
“Well I came back, obviously, Harry! Honestly.” Draco waved his hand, gesturing for Jamie to continue.
“First of all, no, it is not possible to transfigure reproductive organs to carry a pregnancy to full term,” Draco began. “Although, researchers in America have made some interesting discoveries regarding the possibility of magically-induced gender reassignment surgery-”
After quickly tying her white hair into a bun at the nape of her neck, she turned to face Harry and gasped, “Oh my! It’s Harry Potter!” Her hand immediately flew to clap over her mouth and she grimaced. “Oy, what a thing for me to say! I’m sorry dear, I’m just surprised to see you! And in a muggle neighborhood! And here in our store! Saul, look! It’s Harry Potter!” The old man - Saul, apparently - nodded, looking faintly amused.
Harry opened his mouth to protest, to tell Dr Song that truly, he and Malfoy got on infinitely better than they ever had in the past seven years of their acquaintance, but he hesitated. True, they’d shared a quad-room in the Eighth Year boys’ dormitory (with Ron and Blaise) for the past 7 months without either of them dying at the other’s hand, had gone 5 months without hexing each other, and even gone for the past 3 months without insulting the other’s family, but they weren’t mates. Although, they certainly weren’t enemies anymore. Harry didn’t know what they were, but “arch nemeses” didn’t fit the bill. Really, they’d come so far.
Draco swatted Harry’s hand out of the way. “That’s enough, Harry. I’m ready.” Draco reached behind him and put a pillow under his hips. Harry poured more lube into his palm and coated his dick thoroughly. “Are you sure you’re ready, Draco? I don’t want to hurt you.”
Draco gawped at Harry. “So, what do you suggest, then? We just agree to disagree that I was a prat, and now we’re friends?”
Lily set an orange flier on the table in front of Harry and Draco. “Friday is family night at school. Mr Bowers said that we can bring as many parents and guardians as we want because every family is different and special and perfect no matter what that bum-head Charlie Vance says and I want to show you all my family tree that I made and Mummy and Nev said that they wouldn’t miss it for the world and I want you all to be there ok?” Lily had turned slightly red from not taking a breath during her brief speech.
, something I’ve only heard him do a few times in all our years together. He clears his throat and tries again. “So this is just...for me?”
When he returned to the fire empty-handed and silent, Malfoy took one look at him and burst into laughter. “Oh gods, Potter, did you just walk into your cabin without knocking? Did you seriously not notice all three of them leave fifteen minutes ago? That’s priceless!”
“I’m going to taste your arse, Malfoy. I’ve been left staring at it for long enough.” Harry pressed his body flush against Malfoy’s and leaned in to whisper into his ear, “If I do anything that makes you uncomfortable, just say so and I’ll back off immediately, yeah?” Malfoy nodded and shivered. Harry pulled Malfoy’s shirt off, trailing a finger down his spine while he peppered kisses on the back of his neck. He then knelt, taking Draco’s joggers and pants down with him.
Draco bent his head so that his cheek rested on the top of Harry’s messy curls and breathed in the intoxicating scent that now meant home: the slightly woodsy smell of Harry’s cologne mixed with the cooking oil that always clung to his hair and clothing regardless of how much time he’d spent in the deli that day.
When he was at the deli, Harry felt relaxed and comfortable in a way that he hadn’t felt since he arrived at Hogwarts as an eleven year old. He didn’t feel pressured to talk about the war during the long hours he spent eating soup and learning how to make knishes. Instead, Saul would tell Harry stories about growing up in Germany and working in his father’s deli, about summers spent swimming in lakes and climbing trees. He would speak quietly and fondly about his large, loud family that didn’t make it out of the camps, sometimes stroking the numbers tattooed on his forearm absently while he described his little sisters. He talked about life with Sophia after the war, about coming to England and opening the deli. He talked about what it was like to discover the existence of magic, and how hard it had been for Sophia to leave the wizarding world behind. He talked about forgiveness, and he talked about healing.
“If this is moving too quickly for you, I’m sure Bobby has kept your atrocious furnishings somewhere,” Draco snaps, turning to inspect the photographs arranged along the mantle.
“That’s very impressive, honey!” Ginny said, giving her daughter a high five. “Where are your brothers?”
Hermione’s hand flew to her mouth in mock - shock. “No!” she gasped. “Narcissa Malfoy wearing orange?”
“Matzo ball soup,” she responded, sitting in the chair next to Saul. “It’s the best cure for an empty stomach, and it does wonders for the soul.” She gestured for Harry to eat, and he took a small bite. It was heavenly. Harry began to eat quickly, relishing in the salty warmth of the soup. He looked up and saw Saul and Sophia smiling fondly at him and sat up, belatedly realising that he was hunched over the bowl and was practically shoveling the food into his mouth.
“Then we have bathtime and someone reads me some stories even though I’m really good at reading by myself! But my dads do the reading at nighttime because they do good voices with the characters. And then I go to sleep.”
At the sound of his name, the dog lifts his head up and gives a little yip from where it’s laying on Jonathan’s lap.
Harry exchanges relieved looks with Ron, and at that moment a white blur comes racing into the sitting room and crashes into Antoni’s legs.
Teddy takes a deep breath and looks first at Draco, and then at Harry. “You want me to be your son forever?”
“He’s right over there, Harry! And if you ask me, he certainly looks like he could use a hug.” The man behind the counter gestured to where Draco was standing completely motionless.
Harry cut him off before he went on a long tangent, probably giving the kids way more information than would be helpful. “The point is that when two wizards want to have children, they can either find a surrogate - someone to carry their child for them - or they can adopt.”
Teddy sighs dramatically. “Well, if you’re sure.” He bumps his small fist against Karamo’s. He turns to Harry and Draco. “Dads, you have to behave for them! Draco, no hexing anyone. Even if they insult your robes! And Harry, you have to fess up about your holey pants, OK?”
“I’m obviously no stranger to long, luxurious style!” Jonathan flicks a chunk of his long, brown hair behind his shoulder. “But it seems like maybe you’re ready for a bit of a change. What do you think about taking some of the length off? Nothing too dramatic, but I think this ‘do you’re working could use an update.”
Draco gave Harry a small smile. “I forgive you, Harry. But I suppose I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? This - you and me -  has all played out too easily. I’m terrified that I’m going to wake up one day and you’ll have realised what a mistake you’ve made in being with me.”
“No. My muggle relations weren’t all that interested in whether or not I wanted to cook, they just told me what to do and I did it. Just...just drop it, Malfoy. OK?” Harry felt like an idiot. He shouldn’t have made any comments about his life before Hogwarts. The last thing he wanted was pity from anyone.
[Camera pans around Hampstead Heath. It’s partly cloudy, but the sun shines through in patches. The park is dotted with groups of people: families sitting together, kids flying kites, dogs playing fetch. Karamo and Teddy, who’s holding Troglobite’s lead, wave at Harry and Draco, who approach their checkered red and white blanket and picnic basket.]
Tan shoos Draco back into the fitting room. “Now try on those joggers, they’ll be perfect for watching films on the sofa with Teddy.”
“Are you fucking insane?” Draco said, bringing one hand up to his throat to clutch at phantom pearls.
Harry nodded and tilted his head to kiss Draco, clutching at his shoulders and pulling him closer. Draco responded by opening his mouth and licking into Harry’s, wrapping his arms around his arse and pressing their groins flush against each other.
“Do you know my papa? Hi! I’m Scorpius Malfoy. I’m five and a half and I just moved to London from Paris. Have you been to Paris?” Scorpius had run to his father’s side, and was now standing between him and Potter. He stuck his little hand out to the other man, the mitten that was clipped to his jacket sleeve swinging wildly, and waited. Draco held his breath, sure he was about to watch his son be rejected by Potter just as he had been at eleven years old.
Tan brings over a wool peacoat and a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. “Here, put these on. You can wear something like this on a casual Saturday out with your family, or even on a date in the Muggle world.”
Bobby nods. “She also supplied my team with a large selection of photographs. I’m telling you, that woman is a force of nature. I’ve never seen posture like that in my life.”
“Of your own house?” Draco replied, his mouth quirking in response. His thumb stroked Potter’s cheek, a new heaviness falling upon them as Draco realized the significance of Potter’s words. Potter had never been with a man; he might not have been with a woman, either. Draco had to make this absolutely perfect for him. “I will be with you every step of the way.” Then he kissed him, his fingers fumbling to unclasp Potter’s waistcoat. “Merlin, why are you wearing so many blasted buttons?”
She smiled weakly. “I am so proud of you, of what you have accomplished.” She grasped his hand again. “And I do believe you about what your studies found, even if it is difficult for me to fully… accept knowing our family history and traditions.”
He turned toward Potter’s friend. “Mrs. Granger-Weasley, I have curated a list of books for you as requested.”
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy,” a voice called in the distance, and Draco looked up to see Miss Lovegood walking toward them. Her robes were a sunny, golden yellow and trimmed with black velvet. A badger sat upon her shoulder, but Draco could not tell if it was taxidermied or handmade. With Miss Lovegood, there was no way of guessing. Her eyes moving between them before smiling. “I guess the plan worked?”
Draco would attend the dinner to appease his mother, but he would stall for as long as possible. He was in no hurry to marry, not when their plan was working well enough without that step. Not when he had other social engagements to attend and other people to see. Not when he could think of nothing else but Harry Potter.
Draco walked down Diagon Alley the next day to meet with Miss Lovegood for tea. As he traversed the well-worn walkway, he thought of the meeting from the previous day. It had ended well enough, though Potter had seemed distant after their
Draco held out his hand as Harry stepped down from the dais, and the moment their hands touched, silence fell over the room. He could
“Of course,” he said, eliciting a smile from her in response. Draco could admit that she was pretty and agreeable, and if he did have to marry sooner than later (
“Mr. Greengrass?” she called out behind her, waving her wand over Draco to no doubt make him look normal again.
Draco saw Harry making his way to the dais to give his speech, and he reached forward and grabbed his wrist to stop him.
“If we must,” he responded. “Hopefully his wife has taught that oaf some manners since our school days.”
Draco bid his mother farewell and Apparated to the charity office. Now that he knew he was in the right location, he tried to let himself in. However, the door was locked. He cast a rain shielding charm and tried knocking. “Mr. Potter? Mrs. Granger-Weasley? It’s Draco Malfoy.” He checked his pocket watch again to make sure he had the correct time. What was the name of the other woman who smelled strangely?
“Oh no. She takes it so very seriously, and she would never share something she deemed to be so important and private.”
She moved to the center of the room and raised her wand. Her arm moved as if conducting an orchestra, and transparent, glittery impressions of a ballroom appeared. Four long, house tables stretched from her wand and walked to the front of the room, filling themselves with flowers and place settings. House banners unfurled from the ceilings, and candlesticks floated upward and suspended mid-air. Music stands erected from the floor and a champagne fountain began to bubble and flow nearby.
have known it. Potter kept to his very small circle, and he certainly did not seem interested in Weasel or Longbottom.
“Mama,” he repeated, feeling dizzy with… hope. He had not experienced one positive emotion since Harry had left him in the forest, and the feeling was overwhelming.
Draco laughed and then leaned forward and kissed him. Harry melted into his embrace, and it felt so good, so
Harry took a trembling breath and then grinned. “I am otherwise engaged tomorrow evening, but I will check my schedule for availability.”
Potter kissed him, softly at first, until Draco brought their bodies together, both of them groaning at the feel of their bare skin touching for the first time. Potter’s hesitancy regarding his lack of experience seemed to disappear as he pushed Draco back onto the bed, vanishing their clothes with a wave of his hand. He stood above him, and Draco drank in the sight of him; his broad chest, his tapered hips, his cock thick and heavy at the apex of his thighs. Merlin, he rivaled Adonis himself.
“There is breakfast on the table,” she responded. He nodded his thanks and crossed into the next room where Professor Bernard was already digging into his eggs and khobz.
Harry’s hand was still at the collar of Draco’s robes, and he carefully rubbed his thumb against his neck. “She had already figured out our secret,” he whispered. Well, of course she had; she had made that apparent at the party. Plus Draco’s own pining when they met for tea could have been seen from the heavens for anyone inclined enough to pay attention. “Now,” Harry continued, stepping back and removing his own tailcoat. “Miss Lovegood, have you fainted in shock from seeing me in such a state of undress?”
“Very well,” Mrs. Granger-Weasley replied with a tight smile. Draco did not blame her; even despite their recent conversations over books, he had never given her a single reason to trust him. Merlin knew why Potter suddenly seemed to do so.
“Good day,” The man said with a smile, which immediately disappeared when he turned and saw the person to whom he was speaking. “Oh. Mr. Malfoy.” He cleared his throat. “It has certainly been a long time.” This reaction had been a somewhat common occurrence since the war. There were some who would never forgive him for who he had once been, but Draco tried his best to ignore it, if only because he refused to prove their suspicion right.
A moment later, Weasley appeared at the top of the hill and moseyed down the pathway to the creek. Draco took pleasure in the furrowed brow that appeared when he saw Draco standing there.
He stood before them and pressed their palms together. He pointed his wand where they were joined and then repeated the incantation he had memorised the night before. Words of reunion, family, and blood. His mother looked directly at him, his aunt looked at their entwined hands, where tendrils of red magic bound them together as he spoke. With the final word, the magic quietly dissipated, and when they held their palms upward, the skin had been healed.
“Oh,” he responded. “Yes, I suppose.” He knew that he must marry one day; he was required to secure an heir, after all. However, he had hoped that that could come a bit later in life. He grabbed the parchment and made an addition.
“Erm, thank you.” As Griffel began to disrobe him, it was easy to see that he was faster and more efficient than Draco’s own valet. He even floated mid-air to handle the top of Draco’s clothing instead of dragging about the heavy, rolling staircase. Once finished, he whisked Draco’s other clothes into the nearby wardrobe.
Draco exhaled and smiled, his heart full of elation and relief. “I was thinking forever. As my husband. If you are free.”
Draco felt an odd sort of warmth in his belly at receiving such a carefree interaction from such an unlikely source. He could not help but think of how different life could have been if Draco had been raised in a normal family. Perhaps he and Mrs. Granger-Weasley would have been friendly rivals at Hogwarts. Or perhaps many evenings shared together in the library would have kindled a real friendship. If he hadn’t have been so ignorantly bound to the duties of his family, his whole life could have turned out so differently.
Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley shared a private look between them that Draco could not quite read, though he felt it was more than likely at his expense.
He was a little thin, but then again he always had been. There was some muscle definition, but not too much. It was his tattoos he was most proud of.
Draco was on his back, hair mussed all over the place, breathing deeply in sleep. The blankets were pulled back to his knees which showed a pale but toned chest and stomach that ended at the waistband of light blue, very tented boxers.
Chuckling to himself, Harry moved to do as asked. He was relieved to have something to do other than sit and watch all day. Besides, he enjoyed measuring out ingredients. It was mildly cathartic.
“I think you’re the one who has a wish for something Potter.  Here it is hours later and you're still thinking about my cock?”  Draco murmured softly and seductively into his ear.  Do you want to know what I was dreaming about?”  He whispered in a husky tone.
Draco particularly enjoyed the multitude of tattoos from what he could tell both muggle and wizarding ink decorated the savior.  He secretly hoped he might someday be able to examine each and every one up close.  When the three of them had gone back to the wizarding world as graduates, working together to figure out what they could do to help repair the damage their idiot parents had done.  Pansy had been the first to suggest a club and a clothing line to blend muggle ways and technology and fashions into the wizarding world.
Seeing Harry's sadness, Draco took one of his hands in his, squeezing lightly. Severus, who had been looking at names of the Brotherhood, placed his hand on Harry's shoulder while leaning in to see some of the smaller names.
He leaned over Draco's back, never faltering in his rhythm, and pressed open mouthed kisses along the blonde man's spine. He was close.
"Er… yeah," Harry said. "First of all, I just want to remind you that I will not tolerate any sort of rudeness from you towards me or any of my guests. If you can't be civil and keep your mutterings to yourself, I won't hesitate to give you clothes and send you away. Understood?"
"Kreacher," Harry said, forcing a smile, "you've done excellent on the house. You can retire for the night."
"Take a couple deep breaths Potter."  He stated in a soothing voice.  "Tell me what you saw, exactly.  Can you do that?  I need to determine if it was a real death eater or just a copycat.  Damn the profit for publishing pictures.  I'm surprised they're not selling them as Halloween costumes."  Draco quipped.
"Oh for Merlin's sake, Harry! Get with it. I'm talking about Luna!" She rolled her eyes at him like he was supposed to know exactly what she was talking about.
Slowly and deliberately, Harry reached up with both hands and skimmed just his thumbs over Draco's beautifully pink cheekbones. He stopped just before Draco's ears, his fingers buried in silky blond hair.
Harry's eyes widened then he glanced at the blond. Remembering how he was in private, Harry wasn't so surprised. He really was a good man.
“Oh I’ll do that but you’re going to fuck me afterwards.  I’m tired of endless foreplay.  So you’re going to put that beautiful prick of yours where it belongs.  In my ass.”  Draco moaned thrusting his hips and fucking himself deeper into harry’s throat.
"Severus and I had some business to attend to but now that it's finished, he wanted to ask Harry a question," Hermione answered.
“Oh I see, just because I’m pretty, I’m automatically the bottom?”  Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed. “Do you have any idea how much of a stereotype that is?  Please." Draco scoffed.
After stroking and licking for a moment, Harry pulled off to look at Draco. “You’e fucking delicious.” He whispered, then dove back down for more.
Only a few moments later, Harry was suddenly pushed from behind.  He tripped over his own foot, but Ron righted him before he could fall.  Harry whirled around to see four members from the Holyhead Harpies glaring at him.
Draco’s shoulders lifted in a gallic shrug and he simply nodded.  “If you insist on it Potter.  If you insist.  Don’t forget though, that I’ve seen it before, or is your memory that short?”  Draco volleyed back enjoying the game.
“You did darling but we both know that I never listen.  For your own good, you’ll thank me later.”  Pansy shrugged and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco finished the fashion shoots and as the staff stepped in to pack up and whisk away the high fashion photographers through a side entrance the blonde grabbed himself a sparkling water and slipped upstairs to his office near the elevator and lay down on his own sofa barefoot with his eyes closed after drinking down his water.  Staying hydrated was a key to keeping his face wrinkle free, and avoiding prolonged exposure to the damaging UV rays of the sun, which he was wont to do anyway as he was extremely prone to burning.  An hour later after a quick nap he went down to meet the wizarding vips in his freshened up suit. Pansy would be among the vip’s he and Blaise would be greeting personally after arriving first.
“Professor?”  Draco finally managed.  “Hermione, what on earth is going on?”  He finally asked too much in shock to be formal.
Just about the time Draco was finally starting to focus on weighing and counting Potions Master Piston showed up.
“Yeah,  she’s been keeping up with the papers, always has been on top of all the gossip, and who’s who, and who their doing what with.  Mind you, usually it’s because she’s trying to get her brand noticed on important people.   She started seeing the interviews with Ginevra and has convinced herself that you and I would make a great gay powercouple.  I told her to mind her own business and leave you alone, as I’m likely the last person you’d want to see right now.  Obviously she didn’t listen and went behind my back, sending you tickets for tonight.  I’m sorry, I know how you value your privacy.  Or rather, I would if I’d been in your shoes as a kid.  As it is, I quite enjoy the attention my fame brings me.  At least in the muggle world.  Muggles are fun.  Why did no one ever tell me?”  Draco explained taking a sip of his water and then adding some ice to it wandless and wordlessly.
“I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re on about.” The blonde smirked into his tea. Pansy fixed him with the glare deserving of that statement.
‘Damnit Blaise, where the hell are you?’  He thought to himself.  There were supposed to be people to keep this sort of thing from happening.   He smiled and signed his picture in magazines and copies of the ones they sold at the bar to his fanclub and other patrons who wanted one.  Realising that this must be the fan club, Draco played with them a bit and then bid them goodbye.  He posed with them for a final group picture and then turned and headed back towards the bar.  He was waylaid once again by Pansy.
“I don’t have much of an appetite at this time. If you don’t mind, I would like to get straight to researching my situation.”  Snape said dropping the glamor and rolling his shoulders as though he wasn’t used to the peculiar sensation of the wings.
“If I have my way, we will.”  Harry smirked as he cleaned himself up and righted his clothes.  “You know, I think we have waited way too long to go out.  Won’t you come on a date with me?  I could cook for you and make a fire and we’d have some firewhisky or maybe some wine…”
“Now, now prince.  Don’t be ungrateful.  Blaise sent me to fetch these two, says the coast is clear.  You and Harry can catch up a bit more.  I’m sure you two have a lot to talk about.  You know where to find me when you want me.”  Pansy said, levitating the tumblers back to the small sidebar.  “Come on Hermione, Weasley.  I think you’ll enjoy the red lounge best for starters.”  She led the two out of the office, Hermione casting an apologetic smile at Harry but eagerly following Parkinson.
“Harry!”  He cried as he came, which sent the brunette right over with Draco.  He cried out and locked his arms around Draco's back, letting all inhibitions go as He rode out his release.
Draco gave off the air of being wealthy in public, but his home proved different. Were things that bad for him after the war? Harry could only wonder.
Hermione took a breath then regarded Draco."I talked to your mother today and she's moving with you. At this point, I fear for her safety as well."
“Draco.  You’re looking sharp.  I see Pansy dressed you for tonight as well.  Good. Good.  I need you to meet the photographers on level two by the large windows for a shoot.”  Blaise said as he hung up the phone.
Oh, so Draco could play that game too. Harry smiled. He didn't know exactly why teasing Draco was so much fun, but he planned to do more of it. He rather liked seeing the blush that colored the pale man's cheeks.
“Hmm.” Harry hummed. “Michael Corner. Nice choice.  He never let on that he was in any kind of relationship, except for Ginny.  I’m glad you had a decent first romance.  Your father and Voldemort really gave you a bad shake of things.  For the record, I never held it against you either. About the mark, I mean.”
“I learned Karate while I was getting my business degree at oxford.  Blaise couldn’t be with me twenty four hours a day.  After a couple months of getting beat up fairly regularly in the muggle world, I started taking karate classes to protect myself.  The mediwitch course was initially Pansy’s idea.  She took it with me as it was after her design classes finished for the day.  We’re both licensed in Medi Witchery.  We can do all the basic healing, diagnostics, etc.  My face is my living.  I can’t exactly let it get all busted up regularly now can I?”  Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes and instead tossed his longer hair over his shoulder to get it out of his face.
“For one,” Harry said, “there’s no need for you to apologize. I don’t mind seeing you at all.  However I do appreciate the concern you have for my privacy.  Two, as far as muggles are concerned, the ones I’ve dealt with weren’t so fun.”  Of course, he was referring to his aunt, uncle, and cousin.
"I'm glad to hear that," Hermione said with a smile. "Now you better get Harry to your place before he passes out on my sofa."
She cleared her throat. "That's why I wanted to see you two. I'm moving you from Draco's place to Grimmauld. It is already hidden. Kreacher is there and has been informed of my decision. He's preparing rooms for you, and for Severus if you allow him access to those books."
"Definitely," Harry agreed with Draco then gave Hermione a brief hug. "Thanks again for this," he said.
“Honestly, Ronald!  Grow up.”  Hermione said rolling her eyes and pulling Ron’s hand away from his face.  “Look around.  Don’t you see what’s going on?  The photos of Draco, the pride flags and civil service awards on the wall?  It’s obvious Draco Malfoy is popular with the muggles.  It’s also clear he owns this place.”
Harry, not really paying attention, reached out and barely skimmed his fingertip over Sirius' name. Suddenly their names began to glow.  A white light filled the room and Harry, Draco, & Severus closed their eyes to the brightness.   When the light cleared there was a door in the middle of the tapestry.   Draco blinked at the Sight and looked to his former teacher for wisdom.   Before anyone could do anything,  the door opened up and There stood Sirius Black.
“Here Potter, lean on me.  We’ll get you fixed right up.  I have a first aid kit in my office.”  Draco said softly, not thinking too much about the fact that he was touching Harry Potter.  He was afraid his brain might melt if he allowed it to register.  So instead he led Potter with a very upset Hermione fussing over the both of them upstairs to his office.  With the door wide open, there was plenty of room for Blaise, Ron and Hermione, Harry and Draco all inside.  His office was enormous.  So was Blaise’s but it didn’t matter at the moment.
“Didn’t you have a boyfriend to protect you?  I mean, you’re a good looking bloke, gotta have been bending over for someone who would’ve helped you.”  Ron said.  He didn’t mean any harm by it.  It was a backhanded compliment Draco understood his line of thinking but his eyes still flashed and narrowed.
Harry followed Draco to the living room fire, waiting to floo to the Ministry. Something Draco said earlier had caught him unaware and now he was questioning himself.
“Well, or if not my place, any of your friends or just, any place that you don’t normally go.”  Draco added hastily getting to his feet and moving back towards the desk.
"Intruding?  Why absolute nonsense.   I'll hear none of that kind of talk.  You are always welcome here Harry dear.  We owe you so much after all.  If you hadn't testified on Draco's behalf at the wizengamot, he would be in Azkaban with his father."  Narcissa frowned and actually shuddered at the thought.
“If I might interject?”  Draco lazily yawned, reminding Harry of a cat as he stretched languorously.  He felt Ginny glancing at him as he continued to tease his lover.  “Lovegood lives in her own world half the time.  She picks up the most obscure details, things none of us notice.  Yet the obvious escapes her.  So my advice is that simply walk up to her, plant one on her and tell her that you can’t think of anything else.”  The blonde bent his leg and let the sheet slide lower still revealing a light blonde happy trail of hair to his lower bits.
Draco had changed his name from Malfoy, to Black.  Taking his mother’s maiden name had seemed like the right thing to do after he’d been disinherited by his asshole father.  The man still refused to admit that he’d been wrong.  Arrogant to his dying day.  Draco didn’t let it bother him.  He felt it was only right and fitting that the Malfoy line would end with Lucious.  He only had himself to blame after all.  Throwing in with a man like Tom Riddle and inciting a bitter war that destabilized the population and the markets.  It had been a foolish endeavor, ill fated from the start.
Once the three men were safely inside the sitting room of Grimmauld Place, Narcissa bustled in from the kitchen with Kreacher following behind.
“Fuck off pretty boy!”  The larger of the two spat at him while the other sneered venomously in his direction.
Harry studied his reflection in the mirror. His hair, messy as always, needed a trim. It was a shaggy mess that hung to his chin but he really wasn’t concerned with that. He’d just run his hand through it like he always did. He bit his full  lips to get some color in them. Turning from side to side, he looked at his naked torso.
“I see.  Well since he’s here he can bloody well make himself useful.  Let him help mechant, and you over here and help me with the potions.  We can get ahead of the orders a bit with the extra set of hands.”  Draco nodded and grinned to himself.  He was certain that nothing much phased the old bat.
Blaise and Pansy had regrets of their own.  Draco knew that Pansy had felt especially bad about trying to hand Harry  over to the dark lord and had sent him a whole new wardrobe with a note apologizing for her panic and subsequent actions.  He hadn’t heard how it had been received but he guessed well as the striking brunette had been seen wearing the outfits on numerous occasions.
“So basically I gather that this means that should anything happen to Master Piston that I am to take over her duties.  Is that correct?”  Draco asked Hermione to be sure he had it right.
Draco emerged with plates of toast, eggs and a few sausages for everyone.  He served his mother first, then Harry and after giving his mum a quick peck on the cheek he sat down and began to butter a piece of toast and fix himself a cup of coffee.
