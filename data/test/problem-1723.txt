Just as predicted, that was the end of nice weather. Autumn came rumbling and angry, heavy rains, thunders and storm barely ever go away. Everyone were stuck at the castle, not even willing to go to Hogsmeade as attentively as before.
“No. He will be fine.”
“Grandma is still asleep,” he asked, helping Teddy to sit on the counter as he always did. The boy just nodded in agreement.
With autumn in it’s fullest, Halloween passed, and Christmas approaching faster than anything, Draco found himself caught in the overflowing amount of homework, essays, and learning for the midterms. He barely ever left the library, though now there wasn’t much time for reading his favorite books as he was too busy with actual school work. On top of that he had his assistance to Slughorn taking up many hours every week, so he barely ever saw Hermione for anything other then revising their knowledge. He didn’t even take the invitation to go to Hogsmeade with her and Harry, siblings having Quidditch practice that day, because he felt exhausted and wanted nothing more than to sleep away whole Saturday. And so he did.
"Aren't you two hungry?" Harry said. "You have been sitting here since the morning and it's almost three."
“Oh. You are here,” she said, few moments later, as she only then realized she wasn’t alone.
“Whatever. Want to play again?”
Hermione has come with them to have brunch this Saturday noon, but she quickly left, explaining that she haven’t done her homework. Ron and Ginny were having a Quidditch practice, and Luna didn’t want to come, saying she had to write an article on which Neville was helping her.
“Yes. But it isn’t really based on true story, right. They just took this situation and made it into romance. So, there is this rich girl and poor guy that are on this cruise, and they fall in love. He can draw and she is posing for him and she says ‘draw me like one of your French girls’, which is where the reference came from.”
On the Saturday evening, after he was sure all of his work was done and ready to be handed in on Monday, every word he had learned reviewed multiple times, and everyone was long gone to bed, he sneaked to Prefect’s Bathroom. The wind was blowing harshly outside and large droplets of rain were beating against the windows with so much force, he feared they might break. It was late November after all, and it was just a matter of few weeks before heavy rain would turn into snow.
Harry cut off, even though Draco knew what he wanted to say. That he would be alright on his own. Which would be hypocrisy on Harry’s part to say, since he perfectly knew that all Draco wanted was to be with him. That he was perfectly happy by his side and would continue to be for the years to come if he had a chance. But Harry had his life put together already, had a woman that would be his wife and at his side, which left Draco with nothing. And they both already knew that Draco didn’t have it in him to fight against all the odds that were standing before him. With no one at his side to support him in the slightest, there was no way of him making it on his own. He could walk away from his parents, turn his back on Lucius’s ideas and lifestyle that he planned for him fully, but he would be left with nothing. He didn’t have a Knut to his name. The only money he had, weren’t his. It was only a dowry that his father created once he understood there was no way of Draco marrying a woman. Even if he got married, he would be cut off from Malfoy values, being left for the sake of his future husband and his generosity, his dowry given to his husband to do as he pleased, while he could not even see a glimpse of it.
That was something he decided to keep to himself and not let it slip past his lips.
“Is everything alright?’ he asked, softly.
“Sorry. It must be hard. I can’t even imagine what you must feel…”
“That’s good. That you are getting help and all.”
“Hermione?” Ron muttered.
, it just happens. Magic, I guess.”
Ana looked around the room, noticing the trunk, and Draco’s distressed face, and he knew she put two and two together.
“He is a git. He always has been, but I was ignoring it until recently. And we argue constantly. If you only been to Christmas. It was disaster. I left home short after Harry left.”
“I’m not sure, Aunt. I … am I the bad person because I’m sort of … scared of her? I know it is stupid. She did not do anything. But …”
They took few breaks, but never withdrew completely, letting each other have a breath, eyes fixed in one another, before they were kissing again. They moved closer, Harry’s hands wrapped around his back and middle, Draco perfectly snuggled into the warmth of his body, enjoying every second of closeness. The most beautiful thing was, there was nothing primal about it, nothing sexual. It didn’t even spark single spark of arousal in him, nor Harry as he could feel. It felt like coming home. To a home filled with love and joy that neither of the never had nor knew.
“Alright. Thank you, Aunt. And I am really sorry for causing you inconvenience…”
“How is it?”
. Don’t look at me like that. Hermione told me that. My point is, that it’s the same for us that have been brought up in pure- or half-blood families. It isn’t common, though. And frowned upon, because if you are the one to
“We didn’t feel like watching the game,” Hermione explained. “I never liked it. It’s very primal and brutal, and the last thing I want to see is Ron getting beaten in the head by Bludgers. And Harry, well, he can’t play, so it isn’t the most pleasant thing to watch what you can’t do, right?”
“Draco, wait!” Hermione exclaimed.
“Hello! This is Mrs. Tilly speaking. I am sorry to interrupt, but may I speak with Andromeda Tonks, please? … Yes, yes. Thank you very much! … You too! … Oh, hello there, Andi! I am sorry to interrupt your stay, darling … I hope you are having fun? … Yes, yes! I have someone here that needs to talk to you. Have a nice stay, dear, I will see you soon.”
Is this chapter late two weeks? Yes. Is the author extremly guilty and sorry? Yes. Will they step up their game? They shall try, but won't promise anymore. Anyway, please enjoy the chapter! It's adorable and sad in just two thirds!
But it was his House-elf, Ana.
He followed Harry all the way to the seventh floor, which was more tiring than he liked to admit, and to the empty corridor on the left. He was confused as of why Harry would bring him to the empty corridor but it quickly became more apparent as big, slick door appeared out of nowhere.
“It’s about
Author <33
He got out of bed only before noon, entertaining himself with nap and reading one of the books he had lined up. He got ready, according to the awful weather outside that he just hated, and left the castle. Some people were already coming back from Hogsmeade, passing him on the way there.
“Already?” Hermione said.
It was slowly getting to him. The school year was nearing the end, and with that the end of the school and his relationship with Harry. In few weeks he would be back at the Manor with his mother, not able to stick his nose out through the wards, awaiting his faith. Or maybe, just maybe, once his NEWTs results came, he would consider standing up for himself, starting some potion practice, or at least start a training at some Apothecary. He wouldn’t mind that. Owning his own Apothecary, some place nice, where he could sell all the potions in reasonable prices, so everyone could have an access to it.
“NEWTs revisions?”
It's Christmas and, unexcpetedly, it turns out to be Draco's best ones yet.
“It’s alright, Draco. You are my guest. And I don’t mind sleeping in that room. It isn’t half bad. I’ve slept in worse places than that.”
They were sitting a little bit too close, Blaise a bit too much leaned in to him over the table, and Draco was blushing, which he shouldn’t.
“Yes. I am not feeling too well. I will see you tomorrow in class. Thanks for lunch, Harry.”
First of all Harry knew that he was gay, and regardless he decided to be so close to him. Two, he was being nice to him, assuring that there was nothing to worry about, and comforting him. And, above that, was the fact that Draco had admitted before himself the giant, silly crush that he had been nursing since the fifth year. His heart was pounding like crazy every time Harry did as much as looked at him, not to mention the sparks he felt when they caught eye contact or touched. Which was rare, so this moment, where Harry was straight-on having his head on his thigh, resting so peacefully, and listening to his stutter, it felt so…out worldly. But in the best way possible. He had never felt this way before, and as sad as it was, he wasn’t sure he wanted.
He opened his eyes, tilting his head to the side to look into Harry’s green eyes, even though he knew Harry could see him very poorly.
. And without them, Harry lacked a little tiny something. But was still as breathtaking.
“Let’s just change the subject,” Hermione muttered.
be doing it with Ginny. Draco was his friend if anything, and being friend didn’t mean taking one to see your place or spend the day sightseeing, going to the movies.
,” Harry reminded.
Now, the boy he loved, and girl that he considered best friends, were both gone from his life, and he had hard time figuring out how to put together the near future for sake of his baby. It was wearing him off, and he found it difficult to think about anything else. He couldn’t focus on his studying, more often than not just staring at the pages of the book blankly, letting his mind drift away.
He walked into Three Broomsticks but Blaise weren’t there yet and, even though he was early, he started to doubt if he would show up. It wasn’t as busy as it was usually at this hour, looking at how many people didn’t even come to Hogsmeade due to the weather.
“Of course. There is only so much they can squint at. Though I can already assume that Ron will make a nice show. Did I tell you that I think he is going out with Katie Bell? I mean, I don’t think, I know. But everyone pretend like they are not. As if it would hurt me, so they are changing the subject whenever I come near. Harry is the same. Why would even care about who Ron snogs? Which, by the way, I saw them do. They weren’t exactly sneaky about it. They were sitting on the stairs to boy’s dormitory.”
“I suppose.”
“Yes, yes. Now you are free. You can do whatever you like. But please, help me. Just get me somewhere away. I need to get a train to Essex.”
His mother was a whole other story. As much as he was terrified of telling her, she made it easy by never being there. They just had breakfasts and dinners together, and other than that she was out and about, doing her own things, while he lounged around in the solace of his own room.
Love,
Being a daughter of such people, destined to marry whoever they chose, growing up with the only purpose of being married and having an heir. He wouldn’t put it past Lucius to think he could take advantage of her though he didn’t know his father all that well, especially his younger self. And all in all, to be pregnant at seventeen, coming from such a conservative family, just to have your baby forcefully snatched from you, to carry on like nothing ever happened, to marry the said man and have a child. But a child only to fulfill the duty of having an heir. It was just sick, and all of the sudden, he couldn’t blame his mother all that much for the distance she put between them. He wasn’t sure how he would act in such a situation. And he would never want to know.
They were silent for a long time, both deep in their own thoughts.
“Is it an interrogation?”
“Me and Ron are breaking up,” Hermione announced, closing her book.
“What … What are you saying, Blaise?”
“But do you love her?” he asked.
He let out the softest moan, even though he tried hard not to, as Harry’s lips slipped past his collarbone and wrapped around his neglected nipple, his tongue doing the most amazing sort of magic.
“What is it?” Harry said softly.
“You want to play, mate?” Ron asked Harry.
“Go away, Salem,” he hissed.
Draco nodded in response. He started the very important task of putting everything he could on his plate and filling his bowl with honey puffs, wanting to get as much as possible. It wouldn’t be too long before everyone were back and he couldn’t come back anymore.
“You have nothing to worry about.”
“So, can you take them? But maybe don’t mention they are from me. It would sound a little silly if I’m not there.”
He felt lightheaded all of the sudden, not believing his ears. He had no idea about such a thing ever taking place. Not that his mother would ever tell him. They barely talked about things that didn’t revolve around something trivial. But such thing… He felt a rush of sorrow and sympathy, and he didn’t feel quite distant anymore. Andromeda was right. He couldn’t dwell on what
“Do they have m-m-monkeys?” he asked, very serious.
Love,
She outstretched her hand to him, and he quickly grabbed Salem and his trunk checking again if he got his money on him, before he took House-elf’s hand.
After they finished breakfast they agreed to meet at Headmistress’s office in half an hour. Still not believing what was about to happen Draco went back to the Dungeon. He packed his bag, that he had enchanted to hold more that it could. He packed the gifts he had for Hermione, Harry, Ron, Teddy and Mrs. Weasley. It was all beyond awkward but he knew he couldn’t just go there empty handed, so the least he could get was the box of fancy chocolates and caramel liquor his mother fancied. Once he was set to go, packed bag on his shoulder, dressed in his warm coat, hat and new scarf, he left to meet Harry, Salem securely in his hands. He never mentioned he would be taking his cat, but it went without saying.
He turned around to face Harry, seeking green eyes with his silver. Harry wasn’t smiling, he was looking at him attentively, with something that Draco wanted to read as deep adoration and even more. With love. He was the first one to lean in for the kiss. Now, perhaps for the first time in a long time, he felt good. Like he was in the place where he belonged. Where he could be himself, let his guard down, not to be scared of what was going to happen to him next. And that was a big potential problem. Considering Harry a missing piece that made him feel at home, because it was people that created the home, was a wrong idea. Because it was only temporary.
He wanted to say
“You didn’t have to do it. But thank you.”
He was in the middle of contemplating what he shall name as to why he couldn’t make it to the dinner, instead of locking himself in the bedroom and pretending he didn’t exist, when the noise of Floo interrupted. He figured it was just Andromeda and Teddy back, and he didn’t make much of it other than starting to put the plates on the round table. It was only when Salem stopped eating to jump off the counter and run to investigate in the alert, that made him think it wasn’t Andromeda. And the only people that all the wards were open to were him and…
his father and work some job he loved, like architecture design or whatever else that involved drawing as a job. But one couldn’t have simple pleasure of dreams being fulfilled.
His heart was pounding in his chest, and all he wanted was to run away as far from the Manor as he could and never look back. He figured that his mother did it to show how good and changed Malfoys were. Inviting your former enemy, someone you were mixing with mud, and the most sought-after personality of the Wizarding World wouldn’t go unnoticed.
Harry started talking about the Tournament, about the dragon egg and what Cedric told him, whole of Second Task and Draco listened attentively. It was so nice to have Harry tell him those things. Almost as if they were friends. Or as if they were going to be such.
“That’s … unfortunate, sorry to hear. But Muggles made movie about it. Like that Grinch movie, but about this ship sinking.”
Harry walked him all the way to the library, before stealing quick kiss and leaving to the common room.
Draco leaned in to shush him with a gentle kiss. Harry seemed surprised but gave it back, his lips moving slowly in answer. The kiss carried on, slow and not rushed, the conversation dissolving. They didn’t need that kind of negativity between them. Especially since it was all in the past. He didn’t want to even think about what Harry went through, and how it still reflected on him to this day.
Here is another chapter! It's a little bit short, but I think it makes up with content!
“Where are we?” he asked.
“Hello, I wasn’t expecting you. I thought there is no space in your busy life for me,” he said, smiling. It took a bit of effort to get up from the couch, and the lightheadedness kicked right in, making him sway a bit. To his surprise Blaise magically appeared right next to him, gently grasping his upper arms, supporting him.
Draco spent the rest of the day at the library, with the trio and Salem, that decided to join. They did endless revisions and homework, before calling it a night. He didn’t bother going back to his room, instead he waited to the very last minute to leave the library, and then spent another half an hour crouching in the shadows of the hallway, wishing that he wouldn’t get caught.
“You should have seen the owl that brought the flowers. They didn’t pack it very well,” Harry said.
“I am sure. I will go grocery shopping and make everything.”
His inner turmoil distracted him to the point that chess became secondary task, and he did lose. Not on purpose though.
“Have you thought about what to do after school?” Harry asked, once his homework was done. He was leaning in the chair, watching Draco carefully as he was drawing him.
“I know,” he sighed. He felt warm lips on his forehead, and he smiled. He could get used to forehead kisses.
She took out her wand and just moments later Salem, just as three of them, were all dry. But still so very cold.
He still acted as if she said something else and he was misunderstanding. But he surely wasn’t. She really said
“I think it’s going to rain,” Hermione said.
He had no idea where exactly his aunt lived. He only knew the address through the letters, and finding a house of the said address wasn’t that easy. He walked around for a bit before he made up the courage to ask someone for directions. Three different people gave him three different directions which caused him to walk in circles with no results. Finally, a nice old man that was selling fruit, told him the right way, telling him to send his regards to Andromeda. He could cry from happiness if he wasn’t so emotionally exhausted from the emotions the day has brought him when he spotted the mailbox with the correct number and
He felt as if the whole world shrunk just to him, and there was nothing else but the sound of blood running through his veins, giving out a rustle as loud as a church bell.
“It’s time to have dinner,” she said.
Harry sighed heavily, hugging him tighter and placing few soft kissed on his face, understanding perfectly. Draco didn’t want this nigh to end. He wanted the clock to stop or the time to at least drag on slower. And sleep was only bringing the inevitable end quicker. He was be alright with one sleepless night if it was the prize he had to pay for being with Harry.
Warnings: This chapter contains sexual content (blink and you miss it) and Umbridge-typical abuse
Draco rolled his eyes, but let Harry put the notes away as he turned around and sank into the water all way up to his chin. Maybe Harry wasn’t
Choked up on emotions, Ana put on the blouse that was way too big for her, and the silk would no doubt be wasted away in no time from being pulled on the ground. But who would care of the matter? Ana was free and he was close to being too.
“At least,” Harry said, but his voice was distant.
“You still keep in touch with Mrs. Weasley?”
“Oh, you never been to one? Right, that’s stupid of me. I forgot that Hermione told me it was just a Muggle thing. Well, zoo is the place where you can see animals from all around the world. Like elephants or zebras or lions, many birds and reptiles, everything. Oceanarium is the same but with fish and everything that lives underwater.”
“I get it, Harry. You don’t have to explain. And I don’t think you should beat yourself up about it. Have you two talked it out eventually?”
His parents did. It didn’t get them anywhere good.
Thank you so much for joing me here!
He wasn’t sure if ‘ready’ was a good word. It has been quite a long time since he last travelled by Floo. Two years? Might have been a bit more than that, even. He reckoned it was somewhere in midst of hell breaking loose, and he went somewhere with his mother. After all he never got to leave the house on his own.
Hermione, nor Madame Pomfrey, wasn’t lying. After their short conversation, Draco got a big dose of potions, topped with Dreamless Sleep. He didn’t wake up until the noon of the next morning, feeling a lot better. Hermione, Luna and Neville came to visit him after the dinner and spent good hour at his bedside. Hermione stuck around longer, and Madame Pomfrey had to rush her out. He wasn’t discharged for another five days, the trio visiting him every day. He finally left the Hospital Wing on Saturday, after having dinner in the solitary of the Hospital Wing, that he shared with two first and second years, that didn’t pay him any mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was leaning against the wall next to the portrait of dark woods, hidden in the partial shadow of the hallway that he appeared from. Concern was painting his features, and it didn’t really suit him.
“I … yes. Thank you, Harry…”
“Yes.”
. I was really hoping for giving you nice Christmas, I suppose. But I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable there.”
“L-L-Look at me. I’m a mess. I w-won’t be able to talk to them. I would be too stressed. And they hate me. Don’t say they don’t. Your girlfriend hates me, Ron barely tolerates me, and everyone else have no reason to like me either. My father … my father was who he was. He had done terrible things that led to deaths of many people. He supported V-Voldemort. And he was always mean to Weasleys. Why would they want me at their Christmas? A Malfoy. Spoiling the time with their family.”
he win was entirely different question. At this point in his friendship with Hermione he understood that, perhaps, they were real friends, and it would last longer than he initially thought. And that meant it was high time he started getting along with Ron, at least for her sake. So, he stood before difficult question of whether to be beaten, to let Ron feel better about himself, or to win and make him dislike him more. But on the other hand there was a possibility that Ron would like him more if he turn out to be good and won.
Okay, enough with the rant because I got carried away. I just wanted to say again a big THANK YOU for waiting and sending me good word. Also wanted to brag that I got three tattoos and four plant children while I was gone, which indicates just how much time passed.
On the Sunday just a week later Hermione dragged him out of the library before the lunchtime, and they met Harry outside the castle. It was another warm day, even warmer that the previous one, though it was for sure one of the last days before heavy rains and storm would hit them.
Harry took away the parchment and pencil and put them on the table, as he was no longer drawing, just staring at it. The brown-haired man moved his chair closer, so close that their thighs were touching. He leaned in to Draco, just so they could hear each other.
“Good night.”
“You will go first, okay? Just so I am sure you said proper place. House Elf know you are coming, so don’t be surprise if Kreacher comes to assault you with tea and refreshments. He is sort of weird. Long story. And let me take your bag and Salem. I will make sure they get there safely.”
“Oh,” Harry said.
“I need warm clothes and blankets. I’m going to my room,” she stated.
“Yes, Young Master.”
Love you,
“Oh. It’s alright, t-though. We can s-s-see more an—another time,” Draco said, blushing gently.
It was true, though. He hasn’t played Quidditch since the second year. Merlin, he didn’t do as much as going near the broom since then, as he broke so many bones in his body and had such a concussion there was no way. His father was angry as hell, but there was no power that could force him to do so.
“That’s it?”
“Harry?”
Soon enough they were at Cornwall, and Ana left, thanking him again and wishing her best. He was left alone with his thoughts, looking at the floor, because looking through the window was giving him motion sickness on top of the ride itself. There were few times when he was sure he would puke, but managed to keep it in.
“Really? You were pretty good at it. I mean, you almost got the Snitch at our last match.”
“And where did I ask for your opinion? You are my son and you will do what I tell you to. Now, I want to see you at the fireplace at nine, no fussing, no nothing. In a couple of days, it will be as if nothing ever happened. No one will hear about it, no one will know. You will marry Blaise in autumn just as it was planned, and everything will be just alright.”
have some serious catching up on movies to do.”
“I know,” Harry whispered, holding him just as close and tight. “It was just a scare, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it and I was scared to come back to sleep. The worst part was that it was you, Draco. And I can’t get that image out of my head. That I hurt you. You are the most important person in my life, save for Hermione and Ron. And I …”
“Right. It’s Weasley’s house. We call it that. But you should come. I will owl Molly to ask if you could, but I am sure you are more than welcomed.”
“Potions, Herbology, Alchemy, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Care for Magical Creatures, Arithmancy and Ancient Runes.”
“We could share? It’s big enough to fit ten.”
“Well, of course. It would be a scandal if the Young Master Malfoy would decide that he wasn’t feeling up to have a party for the sake of all the uptight assholes,” he said, sitting next to Draco again.
“Hermione said you wanted to be alone. Did something happen? And are you alright? I haven’t seen you in days and that fall. Did…”
They didn’t press the subject anymore. Instead they both started doing their homework, in silence this time. When it was time to leave, they both started putting their books away.
“Draco?” Harry said, dumbfounded.
A bit unsure he gave Harry his bag and Salem, who let himself be handed over without a fuss.
"Who are you and what did you do with Hermione Granger?" Harry said as he popped behind her out of nowhere, taking an empty seat next to Hermione.
"No, nothing happened. I am just ... worried. I need to get top marks with the NEWTs I'm taking if I want any decent career."
Discussing his mother at the moment was the last thing on his mind. He was perfectly content with looking into the space ahead.
Harry took two wrapped parcels out of his bag and walked to him. He sat next to Draco and passed the presents to him.
Draco smiled as Harry laughed it off and came back to his homework. He came back to drawing, but couldn’t stop thinking about the other’s words. Did it mean that Harry would like to spend more time with him once the school was over? It did sound like it. They couldn’t get any Muggle device to work at school and there were no more occasions to leave, so summer sounded like the only option. He got a little excited at the prospect. Movies were fun, even though he just saw one. And movies with Harry were another level, even though he didn’t really saw one
He hated that he was lying to Hermione like that. But what else could he do? Telling her the truth was out of the question. He didn’t even want to think what Hermione would think of him. He was Harry’s lover. Someone, that Harry was cheating on his
“Mm. Just wondering where I should hide, so they won’t decide to make me an example or whatever.”
“Mother wanted me to marry this autumn. She found me a fiancé.”
“Let me,” Hermione said.
Hermione looked at him dumbfounded, as if he gone totally mad at the spot, and he couldn’t really blame her. He was going mad while desperately trying to keep it together.
It was only few moments later that Harry came inside and made his way towards them, followed by the Weaselette. Draco felt an uncomfortable twist in his chest and dead weight being dropped in his stomach, not willing to let go any time soon.
He found himself longing for Harry to speak more. He wanted to get to know him better, know everything he could, every bit of information there was. He wanted to know how his life was. How it was like living without his parents, coming to Hogwarts for the first time. How it felt to always need to look over his shoulder, because of some psycho. How it was to be the Savor. How it was and felt to be
“Hagrid’s dragon?”
“That’s nonsense, darling. We will talk once I’m back. See you.”
“Don’t even let me begin about what your little scene could cost us. I am trying to put this family out there again, step up in this bloody ladder, and you do something like this. I swear to Merlin, Draco. Have I ever done anything bad to you to treat me like this? I always have your best interest as a goal. I ask nothing of you but one appearance, and you are making it a source of all the gossips at today’s breakfast and next social occasion.”
“I was meaning to tell you for days, but it slipped my mind.”
No matter how much it hurt him, he had to get over it. He knew that him and Harry were bound to break from the beginning. There was no reason of crying over it, especially since it was just big, fat lie.
Andromeda and Teddy left shortly after lunch, and he got ready to pick up groceries. He got accustomed to the idea that at this point everyone in the village took him for a girl with a strange name. He didn’t mind one bit. The only thing that played on his nerves was pitiful looks and whispers. After all, he was young and alone, living with his aunt, and pregnant on top of that. It added up to a picture worth of gossiping.
“It is,” Draco said, smiling.
“Come in,” he said, half-expecting his mother.
Draco laughed softly, imagining Harry in such slippers. He let Harry lead the way to the office, saying a shy ‘good day’ to Professor McGonagall. Harry and her chatted for a while, before she left called for by Professor Finnick. They walked to the fireplace.
Harry gives Draco a look into his past.
It was just how things worked, especially in Wizarding community. They were all from different places, hundreds of kilometers apart, and even though they could Apparate and Floo, it was easy to stop keeping track on it, finding excuses not to. If people weren’t sharing the same circles, liked him and Blaise and other purebloods for example, it simply didn’t work. He knew Blaise, Pansy, even Carrow, whole his life, and if he wasn’t to step away from this life, he would continue to have more encounters with them than his actual friends.
He wrapped his arms around Harry, cradling him in a tight hug. There wasn’t much he could do other than to assure him that everything was alright, and that Harry wasn’t alone.
He scrambled to his feet and run to his room, trying to think rationally. He was scared like he haven’t had in his whole life. He didn’t care about what anyone would say, not even his mother or father, but threatening into getting rid of his baby was another story. What was even more terrifying was the fact that he was closed in this golden cage, and he had to figure out a way of leaving without alerting his mother.
“S-Sure,” he said.
When it was time to get downstairs, he wanted to just run away. He hated all those people, and even Blaise’s presence wouldn’t help. His mother would show him off as a little posh dog, and he would have to dance with some awful men. It all made him even sicker than he felt already.
“I guess you don’t.”
“You finally woke up, Mr. Malfoy,” Mrs. Pomfrey’s voice brought him back from heavy thinking. She was quick to get to his side with a tray filled with potions. He wasn’t looking forward drinking any of it.
“It’s my bedroom. I reckoned that it would be most useful to have it finished. It was first thing I got fixed once I started working on the house. Before that I slept in Sirius’s bedroom on questionably dusty bed.”
“Where have you been? I really needed cuddles,” he said quietly, receiving a meow in response. As if he spoke cat.
It was also the day of the first Quidditch game of the season. Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. Whole school was buzzing from the excitement since the evening previous, and almost everyone left early in the morning to get to the pitch and take the best sits, so he was slightly confused to see Hermione, and later Harry, at school. After all they were Gryffindors, and both their spouses played in the house teams. For some unknown reason, though, Harry wasn’t doing so this year.
They settled that their arrangement would be the way it was. Quiet affair, that would end once one of them decided it was time. Draco was okay with that, because he knew that if he wasn’t – he couldn’t have Harry at all. And, even though it hurt him, he took the role of a lover and the second person, rather than not having Harry at all. He knew it was only temporary, but it was all he needed and wanted. Few weeks of living a fantasy. If he tried hard enough, he could block out the fact that the Weaselette even existed, pretending they were in a secret relationship just because they wanted to shield their private lives from the eyes of the others.
“Are you sure?” he asked.
“I am sorry that I came without a word. I got the address from your mother. I am not sure if she told you, but … I know everything. She told me some time ago when I pressured her into giving me a reason of why we aren’t going to get married.”
“Yes. I guess I never mentioned it. Sirius Black, your mother’s cousin, is … was my godfather. He left me his family house after passing.”
Before Harry was finish there was a pop and the old House Elf with grumpy face appeared. He eyed Draco suspiciously before mumbling something about ‘proper heir appearing’ that Harry didn’t seem to care about. Instead he told Kreacher to look after Salem while they were gone, before dismissing him.
The room was dark, save for the moonlight coming through the tall windows. But just a moment later, by Harry’s magic, plenty of candles set all around the room came to life. His attention came to rest at the bed in the farer corner. There were few red roses laid there, and more candles standing on the nightstand. It gave him certain idea of what this all was about. And he didn’t mind one bit.
“Happy Christmas,” Harry said.
It was like having someone drill a hole right in the middle of his chest and filled it with black hole of some sort. He was so extremely lonely, sad and lost that it was unspeakable. It was easy to say he never felt this way before. When he was left for his own at the Manor or during the war, he didn’t have such an existential matters on his hands and he didn’t suffer the loss of his loved ones.
“I won’t push you to go there, no matter how much I disagree. Keep in mind that no matter what people at school say or what you stubbornly keep telling yourself, who your father is, doesn’t mean it’s who you are. Or that you should be guilty of his doing. Remember that it’s not only you. Andromeda is Bellatrix’s sister. And Bellatrix had taken the only member of family I had left, only person that knew my parents, who was like a brother to my father. But I would never find Andromeda accountable just because Bellatrix was her sister. I suppose many people can’t tell the difference and are choosing to get it out on whoever is available. But maybe you are right. Maybe it’s not the best time
Draco rested his head against the edge of the bath, closing his eyes and enjoying his moment of rest. He really adored such moments. It was as if everything slowed down, and for once he felt, that he really deserved it.
. It was the word that fitted the best and didn’t summon more questions. When one said that, everyone knew it was que to drop the subject. But he wanted to be open with Harry, just like he was to him. So, he explained exactly how it was, and why he was staying at Hogwarts this year.
He changed into a midnight-blue blouse he had in his closet and black pants that were stretchy enough to fit him. Which he couldn’t say about much of his clothes. His everyday attire could be anything he pleased, but he knew he would be getting an ear-off for dressing into something he had already worn. Better be safe than having his life ruined already.
“So,” Andromeda started, putting down her cutlery. “We are going to have a guest for dinner tonight.”
Draco makes new friends with people he thought would be least wanting to have anything to do with him. He also starts to talk, which doesn't come out as smoothly as he would wish.
Draco could swear that the cat was more charismatic than many humans. The way it looked at Draco as if e was just dumb, and then started stretching its head towards the house, meowing accusatory. Only now Draco understood that the house was most likely empty. Curtains were drawn in all the windows, and while he would suspect it to be due to summer heat, several piled-up newspapers on the lawn proved Salem’s point.
There was a heavy silence between them, though Draco felt as if he won something. For the second time in his life, he stood up for himself. It would be easy to marry Blaise. So easy. But he didn’t want easy anymore.
“Ms. Granger, Ms. Lovegood, Mr. Potter and Weasley siblings.”
But now it was all out of question.
Having no time to second guess his decisions, he called Ana, that appeared with a pop.
“No, Draco. I beg you. You can’t do this. You are so much better than this, you deserve so much more. You would be…”
Hermione was as immersed by the school work as him, so they spend most of their time together, at the library. The girl refused to spend more time at the Gryffindor Common Room than needed.
“We are wizards, Harry. It’s almost cute how little you know about this world even at this age. But yes,
“Oh,” he let out, thoughtfully. He didn’t see that coming. But Harry’s remark still didn’t do much sense.
“What?” he whispered after what felt like hours.
“It’s fine, it’s alright,” Narcissa murmured, more to herself than to him. “I know just a person. I will fire call her now, and I am sure she will have us an hour from now. And no one will ever know. It will be like it never happened…”
He felt a bit warmer on the inside, and he felt relief flooding over him. He knew it shouldn’t help so much but it did. With on petting Salem still, he took big breath and started reading again.
Harry got to his feet to check the bushes it came from, while Draco sat down to do his shirt. His heart was beating fast, and cheeks were burning. It was only now that it got to him what just happened. He let Harry touch him in such an intimate way. In the open space, of all places. Where anyone could come by and see. Did he had no shame whatsoever? It didn’t sound like him one bit, but he also couldn’t find it in him to regret anything. It was nice. And he craved Harry’s every touch and stroke of affection.
“What?” Harry looked up at him, lost for words.
“I did many things. You would have to be a bit more specific.”
“It’s hard to not be someone they make you to be your whole life,” he whispered.
“You are so much more than that, Draco. You are smart, intelligent, talented, so kind and good. You don’t deserve some dull life, being with someone you don’t want, stuck in the life you don’t want, just because your parents are expecting you to do it.”
. You couldn’t know what I meant.”
“Yeah, I did. Three. I think it would get too distractive with more, and I wouldn’t want anyone feel left out. I know how it can get the more you have.”
“You look troubled.”
He sneaked into Dungeons just before the class before lunch ended, and luckily he avoided anyone’s prying eyes, especially the ones he didn’t want at all. When he was in the safety of his own room, he finally let the tears that he didn’t know he was holding back, run. It took him a long time before the tears stopped and his head stopped being all fuzzy and full of awful thoughts. He laid curled up in his bed, hugging Salem, staring into the darkness of the room before he finally fell asleep.
“It’s…It’s y-your house either way,” he said, quietly.
“What am I going to do now,” he whispered.
“Sixteen weeks.”
“I’m sorry, Draco. I had no idea.”
Narcissa stood up from the chair, anger written all over her face.
Harry stood before him, as he sat on the edge of the bed, and pulled off his beige turtleneck that Draco liked so much. His upper body was everything he could imagine. Tanned as the rest of him, tight, but not so defined, muscles visible under the skin, and there were plenty of scars scattered over him. But it wasn’t what he wanted to think about now.
“W-Why?”
. Outside.
He could see his mother’s face tense up. That was definitely considered talking back.
“Don’t … Don’t say it, Draco. I can’t … you can’t marry someone you don’t know, someone your parents set you up with. You deserve the world. Nothing short of it. And to think that you would marry some pureblood psycho, that would treat you God-knows how badly … you can’t let that happen.”
“You can leave your things here, Salem can roam around freely. You don’t mind leaving him here, do you?”
Thank you so much for reading! And I am extremly sorry for not uploading chapter in time, but I had pretty rough week and only now manged to get back on track. Anyway, I hope you loved this chapter! I wrote the ending first, the whole thing in the Room of Requirements, and now, re-reading it...it's  just amazing, really. Make sure to let me know how you liked the chapter and what you think about Harry's acting and confession. Like, I don't want to spoil anything, and it isn't a spoiler really, but I want to make clear that it is a confession, that he have this deep feelings for Draco, but he is too scared to let go of Ginny because even though he doesn't love her, she is his safe haven with whole Weasley fam.
“Good for you,” he smirked.
He laid in bed that night, trying to think how his future would look like. He was scared, that was obvious, but there was a lot of hope present. He knew that no matter the denial, he was having his baby, there was no questioning it. All it needed was a little bit of time to warm up to the idea and to put things together before they came. Which he found hard to even envision.
“Yes. I know, my house is no huge, fancy mansion or a castle, and I have whole of one room to offer, but it’s a very nice room. Also, I have a nice bathroom, hot water and big bathtub, not to brag. There is plenty of books in one of the rooms too. So, I suppose you have just enough ways to entertain yourself before I’m back. And Kreacher will be at your demand.”
Harry shifted, lifting Draco’s chin to look at his face. The expression of deep concern was painted all over his handsome face.
“Are you … are you s-sure?”
“Yes.”
For few moments he considered telling Harry. It would make things so easy, he figured. He would dump the Weaselette, and they would be together. Three of them. Draco liked the sound of it, and maybe, just maybe he would do that. Only if the circumstance were different. First of all, if he wasn’t who he was.
“Positive. He thinks I have a company. So, even if he was planning on coming back, he would rather sleep in the common room than to walk in onto something that would scar him for life.”
“I need to get some fresh air,” he whispered.
The day was so gloomy and just purely awful that it got even to him. His head was pounding, the pregnancy-safe ache potion doing nothing. He didn’t do as much as getting up from the couch all day, just sitting there with legs up on the table, wrapped in the blanket. Even watching television, which was his and Teddy’s favorite, but most forbidden, activity, didn’t sound like fun.
“I wanted to talk to you.”
Please, enjoy this chapter! It is rather short and rather chaotic, but I poured a lot of love inside!
But soon enough gloomy thought came. His mind was filled with idea of Ginny moving into this very house to live with Harry, to have her things around, their photos hung up in the sitting room and everywhere possible, to have her way around the house, decorating it as she pleased. Well, it sounded only reasonable looking at how she was his girlfriend of couple of years now. More than once he heard Ron plotting about them getting married after they are both finished with Hogwarts, more than once Draco saw the couple here and there, talking, smiling, holding hands, hugging … it was silly to be sad about such a thing. It was natural order of things – getting relationship you were happy in to another level. But the thing was that as much as he could live with his one sided crush, he didn’t want to lose Harry’s friendship. What was bound to happen once Ginny came into picture, once they were married or at least moved in together. She hated Draco, for some unknown reason, and he didn’t like her either for the way she looked his way. And Harry wouldn’t care about him when it comes to woman he loved.
“Do you want coffee, sweetie,” Andromeda asked.
“Do you really want this, Draco?” Harry whispered.
See you in the next one!
“She was too,” Andromeda sighed. “But there was not much any of us could do. Oh, well, it was different times, I suppose. Luckily you don’t have to go through this, darling.”
“Do we really have to talk about it?” Harry muttered. Draco found it almost adorable how embarrassed Harry got because of the subject. He wasn’t expecting that. He thought he would be the one to shy away from it.
“Okay,” he said, smiling.
Salem meowed and left them, going in the opposite direction. Draco let him put the cloak over them, a bit too stunned to say anything for the next few minutes.
“Hey!”
He followed Harry further into the house where it only looked more like a construction site. Everything they passed looked empty, raw, some spots already renewed. But there was barely any furniture, light put out everywhere. And it was so cold, almost as much as it was outside. Getting a house tour from Harry, no crazy House Elves in sight, he couldn’t stop thinking about the words from few minutes back.
“I do not love you. I never knew you were interested in me. You always were my best friend, and I will always be fond of you in that way. But it wouldn’t be fair towards any of us to be in a relationship. I love someone else, and I am going to have a baby with him. It is complicated but … I just cannot do it.”
“Hey. I … sorry I got myself so comfortable…”
“Are you alright, sweetheart?”
He was clear to leave Hospital Wing two days later, and he wasn’t sure if it was a good thing. First of all, it meant a possible risk of running into Harry or Hermione, who he didn’t let into the Hospital Wing for duration of his stay, and Madame Pomfrey was nice enough to keep out.
“Okay,” Harry whispered, finally.
“No, of course not,” Harry said, quickly. “It was very considerate, I wasn’t actually expecting that. It’s … it’s very nice of you. Even more than that.”
Well, it wasn’t like he was about to say no to such a tempting idea.
Hermione continued to fiercely relating him the story of her unfairly graded essay, how the professor was wrong, and in which moments exactly. He found the fact that he could somehow uplift her spirits, at least he told himself it was him that did so, heartwarming. He couldn’t be more grateful for he had found Hermione. That after many years he finally found it in himself to say sorry. He never dreamed of gaining a friend like her, and he couldn’t be happier.
“I can’t produce a Patronus. So, I’m just writing essay on it.”
Harry nodded and they both went downstairs to the sitting room to Floo. Once at the fireplace, Draco gave Harry all the neatly wrapped gifts, and he picked up Salem ready to go.
“It isn’t the comfiest. I can get some sort of couch if you want…”
“Yes,” he said, quickly.
Every week Andromeda would take the boy to a healer that helped kids adjusting to their Metamorphmagus skills, and today was Teddy’s usual appointment. It was quite a trip since it was in London, but Draco didn’t mind one bit. He would appreciate having a bit of lonely time to cry while baking a pie.
“It’s okay. I don’t mind. He can stay there as long as he wants, we will leave the door creaked so he can walk around the house when he wants. I will get Kreacher to bring him food …”
“Why are you so sure about that?”
Also, I decided to keep a tiny schedule to have you know when to look here for a new chapter, so I will be posting new chapter every Friday, but there shall be extra updates sometimes.
“He was helping me around,” Harry’s voice startled him.
, that he found in the library, and sneakily swiped the covers with harmlessly looking novel. Salem was curled up on his chest, and the fire from the nearby mantle was giving cozy warmth. It was the middle of the summer, but Manor had it to itself that it was chilly and gloomy through the whole year, so the fire was always handy. He dropped his favorite summer activity of spending the whole day on the blanket in the fields, a while ago as summer heat and the sun made him all too lightheaded, nauseous, and tired.
“B-B-But how are we go-going to get there if…if not with the r-rest?”
“Young Master gave Ana a cloth…”
His heart dropped and he felt something twisting painfully in his stomach.
“I suppose. Three is a lot as it is, so I couldn’t really imagine more. I always wanted two at least. It was too lonely as an only child.”
“I did,” Blaise said, watching him intensively.
Through the rest of the afternoon spent at The Three Broomsticks, he kept stealing glances at Harry, and couple of times their eyes meet, sending a warm sensation into his chest. He tried his best not to be obvious, but he couldn’t help himself. He tried his best to block out the fact that Harry was in the middle of sort-of double date, which he was finding rather hard. The redhead was constantly glued to his side, sometimes even moving almost to lay on him, which he found weird and way too PDA. It sting him very much. He knew he had no rights to be jealous, but he couldn’t stop that burning hurt spreading in his chest.
I need to say I love this story, and so far it's coming together very smoothly (not to jinx it, though). I love Draco's character in this one, and somehow I like the atmosphere that is going on. I'm trying to make it, I dunno how to call it, mysthical? Etheral? Like very calm, romantic, gentle, like in those old movies. I'm kind of excited about this chapter. When I first came up with this story I didn't have like a proper beginning in mind, so it's a bit of a freestyle here but I must say I like it and I can't wait to see how it unfolds in what is about to come.
. I mean, not him in particular. It’s just … we were sort of connected. And I could see or feel some things he did and felt. And I had a lots of nightmares when he was obsessed getting a prophecy from the Ministry. Almost every night I would dream of this door and hallway, and I had this awful feelings to that. It was the worst moment when one night I sort of got into his snake’s head as it was attacking Mr. Weasley. It was so horrible. It was as if my brain just turned and I wanted to kill Mr. Weasley myself, do those things to him. When I woke up I was so terrified and no one would listen to me, everyone were so calm, treating me like a hero that saved Arthur, and they would keep me in the dark, deciding it was better for me. When, in fact, I was going mad, thinking I am a threat to everyone. So, those nightmares … they come back every now and then. Tonight was one of them. It started alright, but then I slipped into what seemed like this vision, that I was attacking someone. I couldn’t wake up, and when I did, I felt so awful … I was scared for a moment that it was a dream that I defeated Tom and that he attacked someone again.”
“I am going somewhere in a week. It’s a clinic, no nicer way of putting it. I am seeing a therapist, and he suggested I should go away there for some time. So I’m going. There are just so many things on my mind that I’m uneasy with. I want to finally put my mind and life in order before I can even imagine trying to ask for your forgiveness, and for you to give me another chance.”
“It’s fine,” he whispered.
“Welcome to my home,” Harry said. “It’s still not in order. I hope next time you visits it’s more presentable.”
His head snapped to look at Harry as he said rushed ‘I do’. Because he did want to hear anything Harry was willing to share.
“Can I?” Harry whispered, breaking the kiss. It took him a moment to realize that brown-haired man’s hand was on his shirt, fingers wrapped around the small button.
“Of course, darling,” she said. She presented him with a big cup of tea, and only then she took a better look at him. “Oh dear, why didn’t you say anything? You are pregnant, aren’t you?”
There was a heavy silence between them as Harry looked at the tapestry. Then he pointed at burned out place next to his mother and aunt. Andromeda Black.
“Why?” he said, puzzled. Didn’t Harry like it? Like him? Had he thought it was a mistake all along?
“Like anything else, I suppose,” he said, quietly.
Cat just meowed in response and jumped onto the counter to wait for the tuna. Draco checked on the roast before picking the bowl and can.
His best chance was to go to aunt Andromeda. It wasn’t ideal, he was nervous to just appear out of blue, asking for a shelter. But it was the best idea that he had, if not the only suitable thing. He considered Hermione for a moment, but he didn’t even know where she lived. But it also wasn’t the best idea, looking at how he gave her a cold shoulder after months of friendship and now would just go to her in time of need.
“Let’s hope she won’t. So, anyway, we will Floo there. It’s in London. I thought we could go after breakfast and go for a stroll around the town, maybe see a movie, and then go to Weasley’s? I just need to have you know that my place is crap. It was empty for years before Sirius moved back there and then it was empty again, and I have people working on it, but I don’t think it looks much better.”
He let Blaise help him sit and have him sit close to his side.
“Draco,” Hermione’s soft voice made him look to his right.
He was surprised at how lightly he handled it. Honestly, he wanted to pat himself on the shoulder.
Draco looked away, considering whether he should tell or not. Harry didn’t know himself, so it wasn’t fair. But then again, Blaise was so nice to him, wanted to save him, thinking that Draco needed saving.
“Madame Pomfrey said you will be as good as new in matter of days.”
In the end movie was almost as much fun as the zoo. It was nothing close to the pictures his governess took him when he was a child or the ones he had a chance to go to with Blaise. Those ones were just so … bland compared to muggle thing. They were all centered around the wizards, magic, things he already knew. They were all so boring and unnecessarily long and no fun at all. Places where they showed them were no fun either. There were no snacks, no posters, no nice smell of food, and definitely no hot, buttery popcorn and overly sugary, fizzy drink. It was so much fun that he felt sad that he never got to be to such a place earlier. But what made it better was the fact that he could be there with Harry of all people, for his first time.
“How are you feeling about the second anniversary? It’s almost around the corner. Just few more weeks,” Draco said.
“I’m sorry. I know you loved him. But if you feel this way then there is no good. You can’t build relationship constantly fighting.”
out loud, but he wasn’t used to it. It was sort of a taboo, and it sounded almost vulgar in his ears.
Nothing made much sense for him anymore. If the things that Ginny said were true, why would Harry go out of his way to see him and explain? Why would he tell her now, not months back as she told Draco? And why would Ginny be so alright with Harry letting her go?
“He’s an asshole,” Harry said.
“Of course. I tell you what, we spend at the zoo as much time as you want and if we still have time we will go to the cinema or wherever else, okay?”
“I did the full body scan in search of your injuries when you were brought here and I found out then. I run another scan to see if everything was alright. But your baby is very strong, and luckily it wasn’t harmed one bit. It appears to be around eight weeks.”
“I’m sorry, Draco. That he isn’t the father you deserve. He shouldn’t force you into fulfilling the ideas of you he had, and plans he created. You are your own person. Amazing, beautiful inside and out. And just because you are such a gentle soul, doesn’t change your worth. If anything, you are worth one hundred of your fathers if not a thousand.”
“Are you?”
Draco smiled softly, feeling much better than he did before Harry came back. After all it was a good thing he didn’t go, but he was glad that he played some part.
Soon enough they were sitting at the table, eating and talking about Teddy’s exciting trip to London. The boy wouldn’t close his mouth for more than two seconds, and it was proved hard to get him to eat. After the meal was finished, they moved to the living room where Harry and Teddy started playing right away, uninterested with treacle tart and tea.
They ate, keeping up the nice conversation, and had even more tea and biscuit for dessert.
“I…I h-hated it.”
“I don’t. I never was as much as attracted to her. She was always there, crushing over me, because I was Golden Boy that she heard about even before we first met. I liked Cho, but that never worked out, and Ginny had some boyfriends. And then, when times got hard, she was there. She liked me again and, there wasn’t anyone I liked, I was lost in everything that was going on and I just let it happen … and I keep letting it happen. Because Weasleys are like a substitute family. And I don’t think I can lose anyone more. And I will if we breakup. I know it will be a disaster. You’ve heard Ron. He is already talking about us getting married, how he will be my best man and godfather of our first child. Their mother isn’t much better. She is actually nagging me about the engagement party this summer. It’s just … It feels so shitty, but at the same time I don’t think I can do anything about it, nor want to. It is alright. And I’m scared that once it ends, then I will be all alone, and it won’t be
He went back to bed, leaning against the pillows, Salem making himself comfortable in his lap. He opened the letter, wondering who would be writing to him, and was met with Blaise’s neat writing.
He felt a wave of white lightheadedness wash over him. If his aunt was out for days, there was no telling when she would be coming back. It could be a day as well as weeks. And he had no other option than this. To that, there was nothing but four Galleons left in his pocket, and sickness mixed with hunger in his stomach. He had no way of contacting Andromeda, as his wand didn’t even work.
“They do. Many kinds, actually,” Harry said, smiling widely. It seemed he was glad that he came up with idea of visiting the zoo.
“Be with you like this. I want you to be my first.”
“I am aware. Hermione is taking eight. I would too, but there is no way of me passing Charms anyway.”
He sink deeper in the milky, pink water that smelled of roses and lemons, letting out a heavy sight. He still had to properly thank Hermione for letting him know about this place. It was just splendid, even though he didn’t get to use it too often. It was way too far from the dungeons and the last thing he wanted to do after a long day was to walk kilometers just to get to the bathroom, at risk of getting caught. But it was always so worth the fuss.
“Let him in, please,” he sighed.
Andromeda didn’t say anything, just smiled gently.
"No. You two bookworms need some fresh air. You had been here long enough. Come on, pack your things, and lets go."
He would be lying if he said that coming back home wasn’t the most nerve-wracking thing he has done in his life. The emotions that wouldn’t leave him the whole train ride home were just awful. He almost wanted to open the window, and just jump out once the train found its way on the bridge.
“Let me finally wish you happy birthday,” Blaise said in the middle of their desert. “I know you are not of your birthday, but I say unfairly so. You are the nicest, purest person I had ever come to known. I wish you everything the best and may all your dreams come true, Draco.”
“Finchingfield!”
Luna was quick to start talking about the most intriguing article from her magazine, as Hermione seemed even more ready to drop dead at the spot. Neville, on the other hand, was listening attentively, looking at the blood with love-struck eyes, that Draco found deeply adorable. He knew his cousin was more than oblivious, and it would be beneficial to point that out to her, but he didn’t want to mingle in other people’s affairs.
“But you s-should. Sirius was a heir to it and you must have meant a lot to him if he left it to you.”
“At least now it’s over,” he whispered.
Once the NEWTs were over and return home was days away, he felt himself suffocating. It was as if the whole school breathed again after holding it in for last couple of weeks, in preparations for the exam, while he felt worst than before now they were over. He was scared of going back home. He hasn’t heard a word from his mother for whole ten months, and he didn’t even mind that much. She was never there, and he got used to it. But somehow, now, the silence was killing him. His mind was playing tricks on him, and made up scenarios one after another. In most recent one, his mother already knew about his pregnancy. How she came to knew was the mystery, but the matter was that she did. And she was waiting to reprimand him, rant about how he wasted his life and kick him out of the house.
She was mad at him. For appearing in the clothes she didn’t choose and fleeing the party in so many emotions. He was surprised that she wasn’t reading Prophet’s article about pathetic Draco Malfoy in tears, out loud.
“Yes, they did, didn’t they,” he muttered, franticly looking around.
. Not with Draco, of all people. And he
“No, don’t. I mean, you were here first. I will just go.”
Narcissa looked at him from her teacup, eyebrows drew together.
“I…I…m-my fa-fath-er…m-made m-me,” he said, quietly. “Af…After th-then I wa…was too-o s-scared.”
"Great. Then let’s go out, and find some spot. I already took care of food so we are set."
“Is it alright with you, Draco?”
“Have you purchased the book I told you about?” Hermione asked, not caring for politeness. “I was serious, it will really help you with getting a better score at your Transfiguration.”
He took all the potions that were handed to him, and all tasted far worse than he had expected. He felt slightly better almost immediately so he was quick to forget the awful taste.
“But … Ginny told me you told her about us,” Draco said finally.
“Don’t be. It’s alright. I told you to do whatever you want. I hope you didn’t bore to death?”
“I see. That’s nothing to be ashamed of. I’ve seen many people try and fail, but with enough hard work it is bound to happen. I had difficulty with it myself. If you want, I would be more than happy to help you.”
Well, hello lovelies!
Harry’s expression made his smile disappear. He wasn’t in teasing mood anymore and there was no more room for it. Harry visibly regretted that, and was beating himself up as if he did a really bad thing.
“But…why? Did something happened, Draco?”
“We could have dinner on Sunday. Invite Mother. I will make onion soup, confit de canard and chocolate souffle. It is her favorite.”
Harry closed his eyes, shaking his head as if to get rid of the words that Draco just spoke.
Harry encouraged him to choose the movie based on the colorful posters. He settled on something Christmas themed, as Harry explained, with green monster on the picture. Harry purchased tickets and, once he refused to, chose various snacked for them.
Draco nodded in response, and Harry went back inside. He quickly caught up with his friends.
Stan gave them each a ticket. “That will be one Galleon and five Sickles.”
“I’m sorry. I had no idea and just assumed.”
“Fine. Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, Charms, Transfiguration and Care for Magical Creatures. You?”
Maybe it was childish not to be able say
“Exactly!”
“I shouldn’t have done it. I didn’t mean to … disrespect you like this.”
He felt Harry’s hand on his back, big and warm, stroking his clothed skin gently. He found it really comforting.
But nothing was okay.
Thank you so much for reading! I hope that you liked the chapter. It isn't the best and could have been longer and more organized but it is what it is. Things are getting closer to being resolved, finally! Just four more chapters to go, sweethearts (which I still can't believe)!
“Mm. The little guy was hungry. Right?” He tickled Teddy’s chin, earning an adorable giggle and nose scrunch. Oh Merlin, how much he couldn’t wait to have that. Not that he minded Teddy any less. He loved the boy with all his heart. But, he couldn’t wait to meet his baby, hold them in his arms, give little kisses and hugs. But he wasn’t due for another eleven weeks.
would be his family. That
With just a slight sounds of protests, both Draco and Hermione collected their things, and followed Harry outside. They sat on the stone benches not far away from the entrance, and dug into late lunch that Harry had brought from the kitchen.
“Oh! I see, darling, I see. Let’s get you and your pretty cat inside my house then. I will get you something to eat, and we will call Andi right away. Come, come.”
“Yes. So did she.”
There was a moment of heavy silence as Harry was staring at him intensely, concern painted on his face.
“You are so amazing,” Harry whispered.
, which also many people don’t even know exists. And I have friends and girlfriend. Nice one, I suppose. MacMillan once told me she was a good catch. Maybe he was right. I guess I just don’t see it. But the point is … she is alright. And she wants to be with me. Few years from now we will have kids. I will have family that I dream of. It’s all better than many have it,” he said, but his voice didn’t sound convincing at all.
They lunch lasted for almost two hours, and he spotted that his friends already left, leaving Ginny and Harry alone at the box, sitting very close, Ginny whispering something to Harry’s ear as he had his eyes lowered. He hated the sting of jealousy in his chest he felt when looking at them.
It felt like flying. To kiss Harry, to have his hands untuck his shirt from the pants, undo his buttons, and finally drop the white fabric to the ground. He didn’t even feel self-conscious as Harry was taking in his half-naked image, before leading him to the bed. He felt all sorts of butterflies dancing in his stomach, head a bit light from all the emotions he was experiencing. He couldn’t quite believe what was happening.
I hope you liked it, lovelies! I am not sure how I feel about this, but I say it isn't the worst. Things are taking turns, don't they? I must say, I was planning this part to come out a bit different, but I certainly like it much more this way. Also, somehow, the part where Mrs. Neighbor takes Draco for a girl is my favorite - don't ask me why.
“Yes. I came back a week ago. It was very … helpful. Hard, though. But it helped a lot. Though I know it’s not the end of it. I’m still going to the therapy.”
“Sure,” he said shortly, busying himself with pushing his pancake around.
He lived off of pieces of food that he managed to swallow down, before he decided he was being a little bit overdramatic and finally had a full meal. He ate the full dinner plate that appeared at his desk with much difficulty, having it only because he knew that keeping up the diet he had was out question. He was still in denial over the news he had received, and he as was doing pretty great, until he accidentally let his hands wander to his stomach. It would send him into spiral after spiral, and he was sure he was slowly going crazy.
“Drawing me like
“I know. But it doesn’t mean it’s impossible.”
“Good luck with therapy. I guess I will see you around,” he said, quietly.
Instead of saying anything, he just nodded, stuffing his mouth with food.
“Are you sure won’t come back?” he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We should have a picnic,” Hermione repeated.
“You are right. And I will be fine. Although it will be hard. I suppose I will spend more time with you, here. I will be public enemy number one starting today’s evening.”
He was found at the loss for words once again, not knowing how to act or what to say, standing frozen with a bowl of salad in the midway to the table. First of all, he was panicking, wondering if the oversized sweater was hiding his belly just as it did this morning, but looking at how Harry wasn’t freaking out himself, it did. Then there was a case of
At once they stood up and started packing, rushing towards the castle. They didn’t get a chance to run too far when the heavy rain and cold wind hit them with great force, making them wet at the spot. As usual, Salem was tripping him, in sake of trying to find the hiding spot from the heavy rain, but he was too busy with the basket and trying to protect the book he got from the library and didn’t want to ruin.
He blushed faintly, ripping through the paper of one of the wrappings. He had purchased a very old book on potions for the other. He remembered Harry telling him about how he got into potions once he could focus on his studies and Slughorn was teaching them. One of the times they went to Hogsmeade as a group and walked into the bookstore, Harry had picked up that book. It contained many hand notes, had recipes of very rare and powerful potions and iy picked his interest, but due to distraction (being Ginny making him leave with her to Three Broomsticks) he didn’t buy the book. Instead Draco did, having Christmas in mind.
Narcissa left the dining table, leaving him shaking with tears running down his face. He had a hard time processing what just happened. He went over many scenarios in his head, but none of them turned out like this. There was a screaming match that ended with kicking him out, but never a thing like this.
There was a loud rustling in the corridor, and tapping of two little legs came into the kitchen with loud ‘Uncle Hally!’, and he didn’t get to finish his words, being occupied with Teddy. Andromeda followed inside and looked cautiously between Draco and Harry. She rested her hand on his shoulder, asking if everything was alright.
came back, and I refused to do what my father wanted. I didn’t become one of them. There is also a fact that I told him I didn’t want to marry a girl, as he always had planned. All of which lead to him despising me and having not spoken a word to me since I was sixteen. It will be fun once he is back. Very much, indeed. I suppose I won’t get to see my mother anymore, he will probably forbid her.”
Draco suddenly hated the way Harry looked at him, so attentively and carefully, as if he was the center of the world at the moment. Harry was this way, paying him all the attention when they were together. Now, unlike anytime else, he didn’t want that attention.
He shook his head, blinking away his tears. It all was too much. He didn’t know what to believe, what to even think. He wanted to believe Harry, wanted things between them to go back where they started. But he needed some time before that, to put his own mind in order. And so did Harry, as it seemed. If he was to tell him about the baby right now, supposedly he would be ruining Harry’s progress. More than anything he could understand and cheer for the other. Harry needed some help coming to terms with everything that happened, and Draco was happy that he finally started thinking about himself, trying to help cast the shadows away. And telling Harry about the baby would probably ruin it. One thing was undeniable, Harry had savior syndrome. He was just too nice and too good-hearted. Instead of looking after himself and investing time into his own healing, he no doubts would invest everything into looking after Draco, and that wouldn’t take them anywhere.
“Is I true that you found me?” he asked.
“I wanted to apologize to you. I acted like an asshole, I hurt you so much. I just want you to know that … you were, and still are, the most important person in my life and someday, when the time is right, I would like to try and have it all back.”
Water never was going cold, staying in it’s perfect temperature, keeping him warm and relaxed. He could just fall asleep like this, or never go out. That wouldn’t be so terrible.
“Yes,” he whispered.
“Right.”
Harry turned his head to face him, soft, surprised smile brightening his features.
“Yes. I did few others too. Drawings too.”
Draco started getting out of bed, taking sleeping Salem that hissed unpleased, but Harry stopped him with heartwarming smile.
He interrupted Harry with getting to his knees and wrapping arms around him in tight hug. He caught the other by surprise but in no time Harry was hugging him back. It didn’t last long as Draco withdrew to take a better look at Harry.
Hermione stood there for a moment longer, her cheeks turning crimson.
Draco was the first to withdrew after a long moment, breathing heavily and looking at Harry carefully. Only now he noticed that something was really up. It wasn’t the first time that he encountered Harry looking this way. So distant and tired. He had bags under his eyes, stumble on his chin and his skin had this sickly grey color. He never dared to ask, worrying he might be overstepping his boundaries.
“Exactly,” Harry said, smiling sadly.
“I do. I am not going to marry Blaise, nor anyone else.”
“I bloody hope you are. I don’t want to talk or think about it anymore. We are having guests for dinner tonight.”
“Hermione mentioned you like drawing and you enjoy paintings but don’t have too much time for it. So, I figured if you had supplies maybe you would make a time. As I’m saying it out loud I’m hearing how stupid it is, because if you wanted, you could have obviously buy it for your…”
“I know, Salem, I know,” he muttered to the cat that was rubbing against his legs. “I got you a tuna, so you can just shut up with the judging and stuff your face.”
It might have been a little bit rich coming from him, looking at how he was snogging Harry, that was in a long-term relationship that he had no intentions of ending – ever. But it was not less true.
“I am alright. It’s just some flu, I guess. It will be gone in no time.”
“It does not matter anyway. How long?”
“What’s
It appeared that zoo was much more fun than Draco even thought it would. He figured, at some point, that he was no better than a five-year-old that they met at monkey station. He was erupting with excitement just as much, giving small jumps here and there, not able to contain all the energy that build inside. They were going from place to place, seeing more animals than Draco had knew existed, as Harry was patiently explaining to him where they are from, answering every silly question he got. They made all of one stops to get pretzels and hot chocolate, two of the things that he never tried before, but knew had to have more often because they were simply tastiest things in the world.
He stood in the entrance to the kitchen, looking extremely handsome and put together. His hair was pulled back, seemed freshly cut, and even though he had stubble, it didn’t make him look any less fresh and clean. He was wearing a black turtle neck and light-wash jeans and that black coat. And he made Draco feel just how much he missed and needed him there throughout this whole time.
were different,” Harry whispered.
“May I ask how did you earn yours?”
was the one to suggest breaking up in first place. And now he is acting as I hurt him, as if I just dumped him out of blue. And it is just so annoying because all of the sudden I don’t have friends. Harry says he wants to stay out of this, but obviously Ron is his best friend and they share a dorm, and it isn’t like Ron did something to him, so it just happens naturally. And Ginny … I don’t think I ever liked her too much, but now she is just acting like Ron. If not worse than him.”
Before he even knew it, Harry scooped Salem from his feet, putting, almost soaked, blanket over him. What came as a bigger surprised was that Salem didn’t go hissing, and biting, and scratching. He let himself be carried by a total stranger. But it might have been a circumstance. Draco came to learn that Salem could be a total sweetheart, trying to crawl under his skin if he could, just to comfort him, but also turned to total drama queen. That cat has the biggest attitude that Draco has ever seen.
He didn’t fall asleep, but was so deeply caught into the emptiness and nice feeling of water that he only noticed someone came in when he heard loud rambling behind. He abruptly turned around, just to see Harry of all people standing next to the sinks, looking at him with wide eyes.
He stepped to the room first, Harry following him. It turned out to be a bedroom, the only room that has been finished. It wasn’t too big, but so nice and welcoming that he wouldn’t mind staying there. The fourposter bed, bigger than his own back home, was made of dark wood, delicate lilac drapes hanging from it, matching nicely with white flannel bedding and fluffy pillows. The side tables and in-wall closet all matched the bed with their color and neat finishing. The walls were nice shade of beige, complementing dark-wood floors that he figured would be covering the whole house, and stained glass lamps and candelabras were making it even more beautiful, not mentioning the big windows and balcony door on the opposite side of the room, showing off the big backyard, now covered it untamed bushes and endless amount of snow. Fireplace was lit, very dim fire in it warming the space. It all made Draco want to forget about their plans and just crawl under the warm sheets and spend his day there, reading and napping.
“I think you are being overdramatic. They just have problem with you, is all,” Luna said.
This year, more than anything, he wanted to forget about his birthday. It was the last thing he needed, but his mother had already her mindset, so there was no way of canceling his annual birthday ball, or whatever she called it. It was rather nice to one point in his life – he simply didn’t have to attend. It was an affair for his parent’s friends, and whoever they found suitable to invite, and no one cared about him, that was on the opposite side of the house, looked after by his governess and House-elves. It was just a social occasion, good as any, to gossip and badmouth everyone. But since he turned thirteen, he had to attend, and he absolutely hated it. Counting all the social affairs he had to part-take in every year, all being nonsensical, it would round up to a good twenty, even though he spent most of the year at Hogwarts.
“So, you are sure about it?”
Somewhere halfway through Hermione’s rant of why it would be beneficial if the law was passed, Ron passed their booth, holding hands with Katie Bell. He didn’t say a word, only sat few tables away, but even Draco could see his ‘sneaky’ glances.
Luckily, before he could get scolded or send away to change, a family that he didn’t care to remember came to wish him a happy birthday, and rant about their new summer house. He had to face a few of such encounters before he could walk away in search of Blaise. It was so pathetic. Having a birthday party and not be able to talk to anyone. What was even worse was the fact that from one moment to another, he started noticing more and more fellow Slytherins, which made his last year of school a living hell.
“That sound n-nice. And I bet you on-only say it’s nnasty when it’s not.”
spend most of the time with him at the library.
Draco is over the moon, embracing his very secret relationship with Harry.
“I … yeah. Ron is close to being my friend, I suppose. For Weasleys just chocolates and liqueur for their hospitality, and for Teddy because … he is my cousin’s only child. He is only remains of the family I have. It was kind of stupid of me, wasn’t it?”
“You know.
“Try to sleep for a bit, okay? You must be tired…”
“You had any idea how worried I was? Madame Pomfrey said you didn’t want to see anyone and then you didn’t show up for classes whole week. What is going on, Draco?”
“I … I’m sorry for coming unannounced. But I had an argument with mother, and I had to get out of there,” he said, quietly, not wanting to get into details not in person.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said, finally.
“I…sorry, didn’t know you would be here,” Harry muttered.
“Oh, my Merlin … it’s so beautiful, Blaise. You didn’t have to.”
“They wouldn’t do that. I wouldn’t let them.”
He flipped pages of his notebook and found the small panting hidden there. It was very colorful watercolor painting of the meadow, woods in the background, a man – one that he tried to not base on Harry – sitting in the grass and flowers. Harry examined the painting, smile forming on his lips.
His thoughts took him in so much that he barely paid any attention to Harry as they walked all three landings, not getting into the basement that Harry made out to be close to some toxic hazard area. He got his reason back as they were back on the second landing, Harry opening the door to one of the rooms.
“Mister Zabini are here to see Young Master. Should Ana tell he to go?”
He looked down at his plate and started eating, but he couldn’t stop thinking about Harry’s plans. Why was he doing this? Inviting him to Weasley’s was generous enough, and now spending a day together in London? It was another level. And he couldn’t stop wondering why exactly Harry wanted to do it. He could do this with his
“Actually,” Harry said, as Draco was about to say his goodbye. “You could stay here. I will come back after dinner, excuse myself from tomorrow, saying I want to work around the house. We can hang around later, have something to eat and you can sleep over. We are not expected back at school until tomorrow evening.”
Even Luna looked after them as the remaining trio watched them walk away, Hermione visibly at the loss for words. Which didn’t last long.
Tears were running down his face, and he couldn’t stop them any longer. He had spent so many nights thinking about it, dwelling over the fact that the most amazing thing in his life turned out to be a lie.
“Good night, Draco,” Harry said, softly, looking at him with eyes full of … something.
“Oh. That sounds fun, the movie, I mean.”
He just shook his head, refusing to say anything.
It felt as if the whole world crashed on him at once. He couldn’t quite believe his ears. Blaise was his best friend. There was no way in the world that he was considering marrying Draco. No way. Blaise was a perfect gentleman that was supposed to marry some girl, not him.
He was almost at his checkmate when he hesitated. He would win, that’s for sure, but
“Yeah. A lot, actually. It gets worse around Halloween. It’s when they died. 31
“That he is. I think we should get going. It’s getting late and I promised Hermione to meet her at the library.”
"You know. Just the usual," Harry said, shrugging his shoulders, visibly reluctant to go into the details.
“One is from Hermione, one is from me. Also, thank you for your present. I wouldn’t think you remembered.”
“Don’t be. It’s alright. I mean, if I was playing I couldn’t be here with you, enjoying our picnic, could I?”
There was heavy silence between them, few hot tears were rolling down Draco’s face as Harry was caressing his hands gently. Why couldn’t this all be so simple? As simple as Harry made it sound.
. That Harry didn’t have to fight his demons alone. That he didn’t have to care about Ginny, about Weasleys. That
Oh, how I like to end on the sad note. There will be another update this week, so stay tuned! I am having a little trobule with this few chapters - the past and upcoming two, because they were really unplanned. All I had planned was the beginning and the big drama that is soon to come, so I am struggling a bit with writing, but I will get better, I promise.
“Why would he hate you? He is your father.”
“Promise.”
Warnings: this chapter contains mention of assault
“You will marry Blaise. If not him then one of the others suitors.”
He snatched the silk blouse that was still hanging on the mirror since last night and turned back to the House-elf.
It was crazy, really, how Harry made him feel. It was the kind of love that he read in books about. And now, experiencing it, it felt magnificent. Something he wanted to last forever, but he knew was bond to end soon.
“Her portrait did the same to me.”
“Have you ever thought how many kids you would want?”
“Aren’t you too nice to me?”
His mother would go nuts once she knew. Even thinking about it now, he knew that getting rid of it, even though it was an option, was not going to happen. It was his, and Harry’s, baby. That was it. He was having and keeping it. There was no other way out, it never crossed his mind, no matter how shocking and life-wrecking the news seemed.
“We don’t have anything to talk about.”
It seemed that the Weaselette was keeping some sort of silent pact with her brother, as she sat there without a word, giving Hermione glances time to time. Which Draco would find hilarious if it wasn’t so pathetic. As if he was one the talk about being pathetic, as always lately.
Meanwhile, I hope you liked this chapte, and I will see you in the next one!
“I suppose,” Draco said, thoughtfully.
“Yes. And Blyth is very lovely healer that works at the sanctuary. I met him the Christmas previous year. Charlie introduced him as a friend, but I knew something was up. And now they send the invitation. Molly already wrote me a long letter to tell me how mad she was, but happy at the same time. I don’t blame her. She is very attentive when it comes to her children and Charlie, well, he is a bit closed off.”
Harry next to him.
“Wha…Why?”
“Mm. Of course. Let’s see … have I told you how Hermione grew fur and whiskers?”
Hermione left and he continued with his essay. He didn’t envy her at the moment. He knew that Ron could be a bit … nasty. Not only from hearing Hermione’s stories of their friendship and relationship. He remembered all the times him and Harry didn’t talk for some reasons, few years back. And it wasn’t like it all was Hermione’s fault. Some relationship just didn’t work, and it was one of them. Draco just wished the best for his friend and that she didn’t
“Not really. I had an argue with Ginny, Ron and Hermione were fighting the whole evening and Molly kind of broke down in the end. But I got to see Teddy and spend time with him, so that was nice. Turns out he adores dragons all of the sudden, so your gift was a win. He didn’t even bother opening mine. He fell asleep with the plushy you got him. Well played, Draco, well played. Andromeda sends her regards and wishes Merry Christmas and good New Year and Hermione got you a present.”
Harry moved to his stomach, looking at his face for a brief moment. What did this supposed to mean?
“There you are, finally,” his mother said.
“Are you writing Charms essay? I didn’t know we had any homework other than mastering Patronus.”
Draco nodded, motioning for the guest to sit at the round table. He prepared their coffee and tea and sat own in front of Blaise, not entirely sure how to act or what to say.
“Tea for now, please.”
Another thing was, that now, thinking about it as the time was slowly but inevitably approaching, he had his fair share of doubts. He didn't want to do as his mother pleased and marry whoever she chose. It didn't sit right with him, not anymore. But the question was, did he had it in him to put up a fight.
He got up from his spot and looked around, in search for the brown-haired man, but there was no one in sight. Until Harry appeared out of thin air, Invisibility Cloak in his hand.
“It is very considerate of you, Blaise. But I have to refuse,” he said finally.
His head snapped to look right at Harry, his eyes full of hot tears that he desperately fought to not let go. Harry didn’t look his best. His hair was more disheveled than they usually were, even more, grown out now. He had dark circles under his eyes, and his skin looked a bit gloomy, sickish.
The spring is approaching and despite having a foul encounter, Draco feels happy for, what feels like, the first time in his life.
It wasn’t much, but it was something. And as bitter as it would leave him, he had at least those few months to look back at.
“I share room only with Ron now. And he promised he wouldn’t come back. I think he sneaked out to The Room of Requirement.”
Draco felt excitement growing inside of him. He had heard of those animals, he didn’t live under the rock exactly, but he always thought they lived in their natural habitat only. It never crossed his mind that huge elephant could be found in London. All he had ever seen were some magical creatures in the circus when he was little. Wizarding world didn’t care about lions or cheetahs or whatever else. They were more interested in five-heads dogs and unicorns and whatever else they got their hands on.
Harry was already waiting for him, his own black bag on his shoulder, and Draco had to admit that he looked immensely handsome in beige turtleneck, long black coat and Gryffindor scarf wrapped around his neck loosely.
“Not really. I mean, getting married, for sure. And I guess that’s it,” he said, uninterested.
His eyes trailed up and down the names, eventually finding the branch with his mother, aunt Bella and Andromeda, the last one burned out of it. He heard the floor creaking and he turned abruptly to see Harry approaching him, their bags on his shoulder and Salem in his arms. He opened his mouth to apologize, failing to do so as Harry was faster to speak, as if reading his mind.
I don't know what to say, it has been a while since I last posted and I just...I don't know, I don't love this chapter and am second guessing this story, so we will see how it goes.
“Yeah. She said she wasn’t mad, or anything. But I still …”
Thank you very much, lovelies!
He quickly went into spiral of hateful thoughts. Starting with his stupidity of telling Harry so many things about himself, of hugging him, ending somewhere where he couldn’t stop thinking how everyone would be just so much better without him.
Draco warms up to Harry.
He was more than sure he would cry, since just the thought of being so close with a man he loved so deeply made his heart swell. But now, as it came to it, he couldn’t put together a single thought, and even though his eyes watered, tears pricking, he didn’t cry. He let Harry hold him close, enjoying every second of the warmth of his boy that he could get. It was perfect. Truly perfect.
you. Giving you a cold shoulder and empty threats was one thing but this … it got me so mad. It shouldn’t be this way. With anyone, violence isn’t an answer. And especially towards you. They had no right. And seeing you like that. Unconscious, bleeding and all beaten …”
“I’m aright, I guess. I just think it is too fresh still. To remember this all, think and talk about it. Think about everyone that are gone, “ he added quietly. “But they deserve it. To be talked about and remembered. So, I have to endure it for them. What about you?”
“Mm. No way,” he said sleepily. “I don’t want my arse beaten today. I prefer to enjoy this day.”
“I hope you are perfectly aware of how much fuss you caused yesterday,” Narcissa said finally.
“You are perfectly at right to have such feelings towards her, Draco. I am not trying to defend her, no. She did a very awful thing but … she understood that, and she is very sorry. You are her only child, Draco. She wants the best for you and she thought she was doing the right thing,” Andromeda said.
“Hello, Teddy. Slept well?”
“Ready to go?” Harry asked.
“Y-Yeah. I did. Have you?”
“But it does. You know it does. You know how people at school look at me. Besides I know about Ron’s brother. It’s their second Christmas without him, and I don’t think they would be really comfortable with Death Eater’s son at their table. No matter what they said.”
,” Harry said, quietly.
would give him the family Harry wanted so much. That Harry still could be happy, not just
“Yes. I will get the food,” he said.
“You can tell me anything.”
“Oh. B-But you can’t! It’s your bedroom. I will go, just show me which room.”
“I am tired of this a-all. I don’t want to see you anymore.”
“T-Thank you. Got it from Luna. For Christmas.”
“Why?” Harry asked, visibly worried all of the sudden.
“Isn’t it?” he asked, rhetorically.
“I think you really had enough learning for one day, don’t you?” Harry said.
“She approached me and told me you told her about us. That you apologized to her and said everything between us was just one big lie.”
Harry tensed under his touch, but Draco joined their hands that laid on his chest, in a comforting manner.
Moments like this, when he thought about the baby, about the scary future, he couldn’t help but have his mind drift to Harry. After all, Harry was the father of his child. Which felt so unreal that he had a hard time wrapping his mind around it, despite being perfectly aware that there was no other possibility.
“Harry,” he said finally.
“I will go to my room,” he said, having finished his lunch.
The way she was looking at Draco made him feel conscious. His first thought was that his mother was coming. And he didn’t like this idea. Sending money and asking for updates on him was one thing. But coming over for dinner was the other. He didn’t want her anywhere near him. There was some weird sense of self-preservation in him.
He could feel the other shifting, standing right behind him, his hot, stead breath on his neck. Harry’s hands came to softly wrap around his middle.
There was a sudden, loud clicking in the handle, and he figured that the call has ended.
“Are you here to see Andromeda, darling?”
"Me too," he agreed.
Eventually, the decided it was high time to go back to school. They paid and left the pub. When they were already outside, he took only few steps, before he felt a hand wrap around his arm. He turned around to see Harry. He was alone, unsure smile on his lips. The brown-haired man leaned in to him.
He was sure Harry would comment it some way, everyone would jump the occasion to badmouth Lucius Malfoy, no doubt. The more dirt on him the better.
Her words came so sudden that Draco abruptly stopped, looking at her with startled eyes. He had forgotten that she was even there.
He smiled, shily, as he turned piece of parchment with raw outline of a portrait sketch for him to see. It didn’t look quite as Harry yet but e was getting there.
“Well, that’s a little bit problematic because I fully intended that too.”
Draco stood in front of a large mirror, his heart fluttering slightly, as he was taking in his own reflection. The clothes that his mother ordered from the tailor didn’t suit him at all. The pants wouldn’t close all the way up and the thin fabric of white silk was showing off his growing belly more than it was visible when he was naked. There was no way of denying what was going on under these clothes, so there was no way of wearing them.
The words were spilling, leaving Harry shocked, an him still unimpressed. He was already at peace with the idea. Sure, it wasn’t top of his dreams. His dreams being married to Harry, living at Grimmauld, having
He went to his room, surprisingly not in the mood to cry at all. He turned on the wireless, already set on his favorite station of classic music and late-night reading of poems and books. As he was lying in bed, cuddling Salem as if he was a plushie, he couldn’t help but wonder if he was doing the right thing.
Draco is faced with a cruel reality when his secret comes out.
(See the end of the chapter for
As if it was nothing, he placed his chin on Draco’s thigh, eyes fixed on the book. He looked down at the mop of dark hair, as if Harry gone mad. What he thought he was doing exactly?
He wanted to cherish those moments, and emotions that Harry caused, but it was hard, knowing perfectly well that it was all happening in his head and was leading nowhere. Harry had a girlfriend and even though he was pretty nice about it, he wouldn’t want him the way Draco would want him. There was no possibility. So it was more than stupid of him to feel this way because of simple, friends-like gestures. It was almost fucked up.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, smiling sheepishly.
“Do we really have to talk about NEWTs?” Harry sighed heavily.
He had no idea how he managed to get through all of his NEWTs without a mental breakdown, and sill think he did somehow acceptable of a job. It ended up to be a big blur filled with switching off his brain to work mode, and going to sleep after his tests of the day were done. It became his new tactic. Switching off his brain and sleeping it off. Just to not think, to not fall into the pit of grief over his lost friendships or fear of upcoming return to the Manor.
Thank youf or tuning in, for reading this chapter, and if you made it this far - for reading my rant!
On the Saturday morning he was woken by tapping on the window. He got out of bed, just a little bit annoyed, and opened the window to be met with big black owl that outstretched its leg where the letter was tied. Draco unfastened the roll of parchment and, before he could offer any stacks, owl was off.
Harry planted few soft kissed on top of his hand, before stopping. He was still holding Draco’s hand, not saying a word, so blonde look up at him, just to see Harry examinate his uncovered wrist. An uncomfortable wave of realization hit him. Harry was looking at the nasty, old scar that was blemishing his pale skin with its pink color and awful texture.
“I thought you weren’t coming today!” Hermione said, popping out of one of the booths.
He started at the other man for a moment, stunned with his invitations. He wondered for a moment if he heard correctly. Did Harry really wanted him to stay at his house, while there was only his bedroom available to inhabit, and he wanted to make an excuse from his ‘family’ obligations, from spending time with them, to spend his Christmas with Draco?
Draco fished his little pouch from his pocket and took out two Galleons. He passed them to the man.
“A-Aunt Andi? It’s … It’s Draco.”
“Excited to get out of here for a while?”
“Thank you. For everything. I … no one ever has been so considerate and kind to me like you and Hermione. And you already gave me nice Christmas. The best one I ever had. Besides, back at Hogwarts I have whole Dungeon for myself and there will be Christmas dinner. It doesn’t get better from here,” he said, giving a faint, reassuring smile.
