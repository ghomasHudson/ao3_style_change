He looked up at Seamus. He was his friend, right? He wouldn’t ask painful or embarrassing things. “Okay, then. If you insist. Truth.”
“It’s fine,” he said, agitating his hands in front of him as if to excuse himself. “It’s fine! I’m only a bit emotive, um.”
Moreover, it wasn't like the turtles showed much activity before ten in the morning.
Harry watched with a wrecked heart as Malfoy dressed, shaking his head, cheeks flushed. Malfoy averted his eyes as he muttered, “Well, bye then,” and then Floo’d home.
“Being woken up by sex? A dream. Being woken up by your huge cock burning through my sleepy hole? Sounds painful.”
Harry looked at him with his eyebrows drawn together, sharing a look with Malfoy and understanding immediately neither of them found the idea funny at all.
"I like your office, Draco."
“M-Malfoy, what the fuck, who—”
“So how long will this last?” Harry asked Malfoy’s back as he stirred something that smelled delicious.
Give yourself some credit, Draco.”
“Okay, Draco, we’ve talked about this. You can’t call it ‘the fucking Manor’. Tonight you’re gonna need to sell it at its best, people have to believe it’s a good investment, that it’s clean now, ready for a new start. You have to behave better with it!” Pansy snicked a cherry from one of the dozen tables in the atrium. Sucked on it, obscenely, making Draco’s nose scrunch up in disgust.
You should have foreseen it. McGonagall sends letters to all the students who fought the war.
Still. Malfoy’s kisses were always just right, with the perfect amount of tongue, the perfect angle.
Harry tried to take a breath but almost choked on it, Malfoy’s weight still pushed against him. His cock gave a jolt at the feeling, his voice already panting. “M-Malfoy, I can’t—”
Harry felt his face on fire. Sighing deeply, he just smiled. “I guess we do.”
tortugatongue. And no, I’m not crying. Sand just got into my eyes.” He looked up into Draco’s eyes, a trembling smile on his face. “I’ve never been good with goodbyes. I don’t like them.”
After an entire night spent answering questions like, “What do you think you’ll do after Hogwarts, Draco?” and, “When do you plan to marry and have kids?”, all you want to do is drown in Firewhiskey and maybe fuck Potter.
Ginevra dropped the newspaper and stared at them. “Then we have to bury the reporters. How dare they say we played a role with you! Hermione, what’s your plan?”
winced, at Harry’s words but otherwise remained where he was. “Ron didn’t tell you.”
“Erm, I’m sorry. It was worth a try.”
Nope. With a dejected sigh, Draco sped up his steps, dreaming of his warm bed and a hot tea.
Without replying, Potter picked a second cherry, and his tongue darted out a milli-second to lick it before eating it, “Why are you so interested in what I am into, Draco?”, making Draco’s heart jump in his throat.
Draco sighed, his face heating. Thinking about the memory had sent his body into a spiral of arousal, and—
He reached Pansy, who was excitedly squeeing with the waiters. “Did you have any idea at all that you have eight hundred salad plates, Draco? Did you?”
Malfoy had called him
Oh yes. We do. Harry pulls off and they rearrange to be face to face. Malfoy hooks his hands under his knees and spreads open for Harry.
“Do you think this is normal?” Potter held Lady Luck close to Draco’s eyes for inspection, but Draco couldn’t distinguish anything abnormal and his head was hurting too much to focus on something so close anyway.
Potter chuckled, shaking his head. “Then do it. I’m not gonna stop you.” He bit again his bottom lip. For a moment, Draco thought Potter was gonna say something, but then he sipped his tea and the frown that had formed between his eyebrows cleared.
“Good night,” Harry said, smirking like a fool. “Unless…”
You don’t do these things, usually. Usually, you take your time, preparing your partner, but Potter’s words are hot in your mind.
Harry kept staring at her, waiting for the rest of the sentence. '...a bond of gigantic bacteria' maybe? '...a bond-ing on the bed virus'?
you!” Draco hissed, his eyes flashing. “What does that mean, huh? That I
“I’m very observant, Malfoy.”
She sat next to Harry, dropping her precariously open bag on the couch between them.
Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, squeezing him in a tight hug. He grinned and nodded, solemnly.
Draco showed him his room and why did he never tell Harry he had curly hair when he was a kid?
“Doing salutations to the sun?” Harry asked, a playful smile in place.
you can’t help but think.
Harry rolled his eyes while the other people in the circle looked suspiciously at Malfoy. Luckily, Seamus cleared his throat and went on. Maybe he’d guess the wrong person? The Veritaserum worked only for questions for which the answer would be either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ — if they wanted the name of the person, their only shot was to try and ask Harry for a  specific name now.
And at this point, with Harry touching him, telling him he wanted to kiss him, that he’s an important part of his life, Draco simply felt the need to give in. “Stop teasing me.” He grabbed Harry’s waist, pulling him closer, bumping their noses together, growling, “I can’t wait anymore.”
“How was your trip? Motivating?” Draco asked.
So, he’d fled. For half a year, around the world, and came back a new man.
Feeling his stomach flutter, Harry forced himself to concentrate on the task at hand, tearing his eyes off Malfoy, but not before crossing his grey eyes, fixed on Harry with an intensity that surprised him. It almost looked like Malfoy was checking Harry out too.
Pansy just laughed as she listened to Draco’s ramblings. “You’re nuts, completely bonkers. Potter’s not gonna laugh at you. Anyway, I’ve written a clue on this piece of paper. You have to promise me something, though. You won’t open it until tonight when you’re with Potter.”
"I'm not a kid!" Boo-boo shouted indignantly. "Okay, yes, technically, my body is the one of a kid, but that's because I'm a ghost and I can't grow up! But I've lived the last twenty years with you two, I'm not a child anymore! I
“Shut up, that was almost thirty years ago!”
Malfoy only pressed harder on his hip, biting on Harry’s earlobe. “Stay still and be patient, pet, all in good time.”
After some time, Ginevra wiped the tears gathered at the corner of her eyes and tugged Astoria up from her seat. “Let’s go. These two morons don’t deserve one more minute of our time.”
“Yesterday night, during the prom, I…” Draco tails off, feeling the heat creeping down his neck. Damn it. “I flirted with Harry. And… you know, one thing lead to another. We…”
“It seems that our time-travel, that this is kind of… predestined?” Draco said, looking at Harry warily.
He felt his cheeks grow hot as he thought that the git was an absolute bastard, how could he possibly look so hot in a stupid hood?
Hermione dropped her folder and quill on the desk, looking at them.
^^^^^
The moment the waitress went away, Harry rolled his eyes. “Was that really necessary?”
He didn’t miss how Pansy’s face flushed, how her smile faltered. “How is that relevant?”
“I don’t know,” Harry said, his voice petulant like a kid who’s been asked what he did at school that day. “I feel like a… like someone,
Harry cried out, relief coursing through him, his hips helplessly bucking against Malfoy’s finger, his brain completely fuzzing. “Oh gods, more,
He was gazing absent-mindedly into the void when Andromeda playfully shook him. “You get along well, after all, Harry.” Her voice seemed to have a hopeful tone, rather than the flat one she had assumed after the Final Battle.
at Harry’s feet was distracting.
"I'm sorry, Harry, you're right. We should have waited for you to wake up, but you don’t understand, it… it had been frightening! You were… you looked like you were dying!"
Why he remained silent every time Harry would smile at him, or look at him, or just give him any attention, making him feel like he was the centre of his universe.
“Not so fast, you idiot,” Harry said, rubbing his back in slow circles. “Thanks for the banner, by the way.” He smirked. “Very thoughtful.”
Malfoy finally kissed him, chaste, a peck on the lips. Retreaded back, to look into Harry’s eyes. “The Dark Mark. I… you’re right. The situation, Voldemort, he… Harry, it was taking it or dying on the spot. I still thought I could help you, I wanted to tell you straight away, but…”
“That right now I’ve become your sex slave?” Malfoy supplied, chin held high. “More or less. The bond makes it so that I physically need you to order me around, more frequently the first weeks or so. And when you do it…”
Draco thinks as he sends a glare in Harry’s direction.
He looked up and saw Malfoy looking at him sceptically.
would have deigned to teach me Occlumency properly!”
“You’re so cute, all embarrassed and cheesy.” And seriously, where had Theo come from?
He watched while Malfoy’s breath hitched in anticipation and the fire in his chest roared stronger, urging him to make Malfoy remember exactly how it felt to be Harry’s.
Harry groaned, pushing him closer, grinding against him.
“Why do you always forget to cast an umbrella charm?” Sarah asked. She pointed her wand to the floor, evaporating the rain Draco had brought inside. “I’ll take you to Pansy’s table; she’s already here.”
“So, Pansy, how’s your witch-hunt going? Did you find out who the mysterious chef of Sweet Prophecies is?” Ron was sitting right next to her, his adoring blue eyes fixed on her lips. How Pansy could be so fucking oblivious to Ron’s attentions, Draco had no idea. It was clear to everyone else but the two of them, apparently.
Hermione interrupted them. “I’ve called Draco and Harry, they are on their way here. Don’t look at me like that, guys, we need to solve this together.”
It’s Hermione Granger who opens your eyes.
In one swift move, Harry grabbed Draco’s arm, urging him up to face one another. Harry had something in his hand, but Draco couldn’t quite see it.
And that was how they started noticing the years passing by. Harry was already obsessed with counting the passing of every day; trying to remember exactly what day it would be in their real timeline, trying to remember their birthdays and anniversaries. But he hadn’t realised how confusing it was starting to be.
With a last glance towards the placid ocean, Draco turned off the lights of his cabin and laid down on the couch, exhaling slowly. He was there to work, after all, not to fuck with Mexican
The next morning, he and Malfoy were sitting in the restaurant of the hotel, eating breakfast, trying to drown their hangover in eggs and bacon.
With a groan, Potter pushed his tongue down to Draco’s balls, dragging it over each one, closing his mouth to suck them in.
Harry laughed again, and Draco felt proud to be the one making him laugh like that. He reached out to Draco again, taking his hand.
"What do you mean, he can’t be found?" A shiver ran through Harry's body thinking about what that could mean, hoping he was wrong.
Malfoy just hums, shifts to tighten his legs around Harry. “I want you to fill every inch of me first,” he whispers into Harry’s hair, arching slowly to fuck himself on Harry’s knot.
Harry writhed under his touch, his lips involuntarily stretching into a grin, his hands closing into fists. Malfoy had just started and Harry was already dying to just open his mouth and cry out loud and laugh and laugh again.
“Mate, it’s not a surprise to anyone, really.” Blaise popped up from behind Draco, startling him.
It was enough to make Harry hard, his mind already going in all kinds of directions.
"Actually," he said, "I still have curly hair.”
“Harry.” Ron bit his lips and took a deep breath. “I’m really sorry, okay? But this—” he pointed vaguely at Harry, “— this is exactly why we couldn’t involve you.”
Ron smirked, the bastard. “Huh. Maybe Harry didn’t tell me the whole story?”
Harry didn’t know how long he kept at it, but it surely was more than one second when Malfoy finally gave in and pulled his fingers out of Harry’s mouth, growling impatiently and grabbing at his shirt, pulling him toward his chest, crashing their lips together.
“Playing with my cousin. Do you want to join us?”
"So, yes, Remi, this is Draco Malfoy. You already know him for his abilities as Curse-Breaker, however, I suggested him for his
“You’re such a good boy, sweetheart, you know? Good good good boy. I’ll treat you so well, I’ll be patient, pet, you’ll love it, you’ll beg for more.”
Harry’s plea died in his throat when Malfoy finally replaced the tongue on his hole with his finger and swallowed his cock instead, until his nose rested on Harry’s groin.
“Reasonable.” Harry watched as Malfoy retrieved another cauldron from his storage, setting up to prepare a new potion. “How do we know if the effects are gone?”
They found Boo-boo closer to the rocks, and asked him to join them. He looked at them smiling, saying he’d rather remain a bit longer at the beach.
Barely one minute after they reached a little open space bordered by ancient trees — oaks, Draco said — and…
Harry glared at her, and then at Hermione. This was so unfair, so fucking unfair.
They looked at each other with their eyes wide open, not daring to move a single muscle. After seconds that felt like a lifetime, Potter slowly started to talk. “Did your mirror just compliment me?”
Harry’s eyes followed the movement, thoughts immediately drifting towards dirty places where he’d lean in and nibbled at Malfoy’s shoulder. Now Harry could almost feel it in his blood; the Veritaserum, flowing in his veins. He felt compelled to say everything that crossed his mind.
Malfoy shot Harry a venomous glare. Harry could finally take a good look at him now that the smoke was gone. Malfoy was wearing his usual light green scrubs, the V neckline exposing a generous portion of his porcelain — bloody kissable — skin. The goggles were hanging around his neck, but red bruises circled Malfoy’s eyes; he must have just taken them off. His hair was messier than usual, strands brushing his forehead,  sparkling like he’d just stepped out of the shower.
An hour later, Ron and Harry are sitting at the Gryffindor’s table for breakfast.
“This is the last time.”
“She’s going back home, at last,” Draco whispered, a cheesy smile tugging at his lips.
^^^^^
Harry had glanced down, seeing Draco’s pyjama bottoms dampening with his come.
Malfoy.
Ron smiled and called Bob — that day’s waiter— over, ordering three slices of apple and mint cake, plus another two glasses of Pinot Noir. Draco would have never guessed that apple and mint were a good combination, but Sweet Prophecies changed that too.
“Probably.”
Draco blinked, possibly frozen, under some sort of spell himself that changed his personality from composed to blunt and horny. Potter had bent his head slightly, then sucked —
“What, trust me? Why the fuck I’m an auror if you can’t trust me with cases? Ron, for fuck's sake!” Harry knew he was being unreasonable and only proving Ron’s point further with his behaviour.
“Seriously—” Malfoy went on while frowning down at his shirt. He’d done the buttons all wrong. He started undoing them again, shaking his head, whispering under his breath.
Not that Draco wasn’t used to ocean water by now, but he was surprised to think for the first time that it was a really good smell. Damn.
“Draco, you draw? You paint? You didn’t tell me anything! Thirteen years, honey, and I’m only now discovering you have curly hair and can draw?!”
Draco braced himself against the wall, digging his fingers against unyielding plaster, listing all the names of his forefathers in alphabetical order to avoid coming on the spot.
“Okay,” repeated Malfoy. “I think it should be ‘Voldemort’.”
“What stuff?!”
“That’s a damaged shirt. Wow, the sex must have been
Harry smiled too, as Boo-boo nodded and did a little gesture with his hand like a soldier's salute.
Draco was kneeling on the floor, an ear-to-ear grin on his face, papers all around himself with a stack of brushes and watercolours.
Draco had sucked in a breath, asking himself if there was anything filthier or hotter than this. When Potter eventually bit into the slice, droplets of lime juice ran down his fingers. His tongue darted down to lick the droplets clean, before returning to voraciously attack the slice of lime.
The memories were abruptly interrupted when the car came to a stop next to an isolated cottage in the middle of what one could only call a forest. By the overgrown look of it, it was probably long abandoned or in disuse.
“Is that so?” he had asked, voice so low the vibrations went straight to Draco’s aching cock.
“I know. Fuck, goddamnit, I want you too.”
Draco slumped on the sofa and
Malfoy snorted, choking on the sip of hot tea he was drinking.
Harry’s voice hardened. “You better start explaining
, hanging out on a Friday night with their friends, sharing small talk about their daily lives. Every now and then, Potter would squeeze Draco’s knee under the table or brush against Draco’s hand, white-knuckled and tightly wrapped around his pint, and Draco would hate his life. So. Damn. Much.
Draco blinked once, realising he was clenching his wand in the holster secured to his thigh, probably an involuntary reflex. Relaxing through his breaths, he left it. It had been useless for a long time, now, anyway. Instead, he brought his hand to the pendant under his shirt, and smiled again. People were clapping: it was good. Good.
Draco shook his head. “Don’t, Pans.”
Seawater. Draco remembered when he swallowed a ton of seawater as a kid and how it burned down his throat, his nose, how he felt like he was gonna choke. It felt exactly like that to try to swallow and talk with Potter now.
Once outside, Draco glanced up at the sky, now a deep blue punctuated with bright stars. He turned to find Harry again staring right back at him. He showed a half-smile and whispered, “Where are we going?” when—
All the air leaves your lungs as you bend over. He pushes you back until you hit the wall. He’s fisting your shirt and, this up close, you can see there are tears in Potter’s eyes too.
He tried to look normal throughout all the goodbye-greetings, and after a weird moment with their wives —
“That’s not true,” he whispered. His hands fell lower, massaging Draco’s chest and Draco allowed himself to lean back against Potter’s body, revelling in his warmth, his musky scent.
“I see you can still recognize people, in spite of the ripe old age.” Malfoy turned towards him, leaning his hip against the banister of the stairs that led to the second floor, a smirk already pulling at his plump lips.
“You never told me, Geremia! We worked on this for so many years! What did you do?!” She sounded desperate and Harry realised only that moment what that could mean for Hermione. He ran to her, catching her between his arms before she could fall to the floor, Draco now pointing his wand at Geremia.
When he walked into the kitchen, Ginny was cooking waffles and cutting fresh fruits. Harry stared at her figure, always graceful and elegant despite the years passing. He probably owed her a ‘straight’ brunch. He cleared his throat and she turned, her eyes bloodshot. Guilt again crept into Harry’s throat, but he swallowed it down, opting for a stretched smile instead.
“I know you have a weakness for this,” he murmured, dipping two fingers into the bowl and trailing a sweet line from his neck to the base of his cock. Draco climbed over Harry and straddled his hips, immediately attacking Harry’s neck, devouring every bit of the cream.
It was a sunny summer day, with a soft breeze gentling the stifling heat. Harry couldn’t be luckier than this. Music lingered softly in the air, the orange tree in the back yard had given fruit after years of dryness— that, too, Harry didn’t question too much.
of what happens to me. I can
Malfoy reached him and pried the prescription from Harry’s hands. “I can read by myself,” he said. Then he picked his wand and sent an unlocking charm to the door of the laboratory, then restarted working on his potion.
Cold sweat forms at Harry’s temples: Draco’s eyes are filled with pure rage, like Harry hasn’t seen for a long time now.
“Love, want you, need you, want to make love to you.”
Malfoy was looking all around as if it was the first time he attended a party in all his life.
“Quite,” Potter breathed. “Look, I have to go back home, but I wanted to say ‘hi’ before I did.” He moved around the sofa and sat next to Draco.
to be ordered around?
“Shut up! You’re just sour because you lost the bet. While I’m still in. So, Harry, the House?” Seamus grins and the situation is so abnormal that Harry finds himself mirroring his same grin.
"Right. We will… and I can't wait for it."
Even only the idea of taking the steps to go up to his bedroom — where, by the way,
Now Harry knew they were young, they didn’t know anything about role-playing, BDSM, anything. They only did what they wanted. He wondered if Malfoy had realised now, as Harry did.
"But does he? Does he deserve the prize?"
“Crown?”
"Y-yes, I think so…" Harry's vision had blurred for a moment but was already clearing again, when a glass of water floated in front of him.
Malfoy was laughing too, and kissing Harry’s jaw, neck, ear. “Beautiful, gorgeous,” he was saying between laughter. “You’re so beautiful when you laugh, sweetheart. You like it, don’t you?” Malfoy seemed not able to stop talking and the feather was completely wild on Harry’s skin now, his nerves a wrecked mess.
like it.” Harry’s lips were still pressed on Malfoy’s hole, reluctant to let go of that perfect taste and skin underneath them.
Hermione took another sip of her wine before replying. “Talk to him.”
But at the news, unexpected memories of Hogwarts flooded Harry’s brain— Malfoy sliding down the bannister of the Great Hall, cloak billowing behind him; Malfoy sneering whenever he crossed paths with Harry, hair glistening; Malfoy looking down at him from the branches of a tree, eyes bright.
They had to disguise themselves to not be recognised amongst people, and then hope for the best. Harry had left with some money on him but neither of them could go to Gringotts and withdraw from their vaults, or their past-selves would notice it.
“Say that you’re mine,” he whispers.
This is one of the constants in Draco’s life. After years of uncertainty, lies, and fights to accept his very nature, Draco discovered routines helped him stay sane. They were little things: the same song played every night before going to sleep (Bohemian Rhapsody, of course); reading every day; breakfast with his mother every Sunday morning; eating at Sweet Prophecies at least once a week (preferably a couple of times, or three. Four. Damn, Draco would go there every day of his life if he could).
After the New Year celebrations, Potter comes back home —you should really stop calling it
As soon as he regained his normal breathing, Harry
Oh, fuck. Harry was so screwed — they were going to discover, he knew it, but tried anyway. “Guys, can’t we just drop—”
Draco cleared his throat, willing his voice to come out evenly, dragging his eyes off Potter’s enthusiastic face. “Erm, no don’t worry. That’s… fascinating. I honestly didn’t know you were a wandmaker, but it sounds like something you need a lot of patience for… like, not for you.”
When he got to the door of the laboratory Harry found the usual sign: “Work in progress — do NOT come in.” Harry rolled his eyes— everyone knew by now that Malfoy never took it down, not even when he wasn’t preparing potions at all.
Harry just nodded. Why he’d brought up war memories, he had no idea.
“Sorry, fuck! Ah, get me a glass of water, or something.”
Harry snorted, while Malfoy's eyes widened as he whispered, "See,
“I remember something… especially from my time here.”
“What?! Who’s here?” Potter’s voice sounded completely taken-aback, almost as if he actually had been alone in the cubicle…
Harry looked at him, nodding frantically. “You’re talking like this only because you haven’t seen her after Ron told her that her pot roast sucks.”
“And we had to extract Draco. We were able to locate the base but of course they saw us, so that was useless— they’d run away already. Problem was, in escaping, one of the Scarlet Tribes tried to cast this bond on Draco. I don’t know, I guess to control him since he was the mole or… well. Couldn’t let it happen, of course.”
So that’s how you meet him again. He’s sitting by the shore of the Great Lake, book on his lap, Granger and Weasley next to him. When he sees you, he sneers, and your cock —treacherous, vile little thing, that— decides to perk up at the sight: Potter’s wearing his eyeliner again.
His heart thumped hard, told him to punch the git.
Without thinking too much about it, Harry continued. “I don’t know what I’m doing with my life.”
“Shut up!” Harry yelled, all the other customers’ eyes snapping to him. Draco froze, slowly raising his gaze to him.
Malfoy drew out his wand and muttered a revealing spell on Harry's skin that immediately broke out in thousands of little red dots.
doing here?”
Harry cast another quick tempus: it was only five in the afternoon. Definitely too short a time since Harry’s last order to Malfoy and too early to get drunk. But he was in no right state to make good decisions right then.
Potter went on. “What if they’re a woman?”
Pansy stroked Draco’s hand, trying to soothe him. When she finally spoke, her voice was so sweet Draco felt tears forming in his eyes.
Whatever it was that Harry was creating, though, wasn’t an hourglass. It looked like… “Er.”
“So you tied him up to me.” Harry concluded with a weak voice. “How long does it last? How can we… Malfoy said the caster… you’re the caster then Ron, right? You can, just, pull it off now?”
Oh. Whatever version of Veritaserum Malfoy was brewing, it was too much. It was switching from being a tool for Harry to being something else. A way out. A free exit.
“Fuck, I want to kiss you.” Potter’s eyes widened as if he hadn’t planned to say that. “Good lord, and I don’t even know why. I mean…”
"He's not an animal! It's more like we adopted him, isn't it?"
“W-what?!” He felt his eyes widen and flicked them quickly to Ron, who waved a hand dismissively.
Cheeks softly rosed, tongue often slipping out to wet his lips, barely-there chuckles that made Harry’s heart skip beat after beat.
“Honestly, me neither.” Cringing for the open vulnerability of his broken voice, Harry took another fortifying breath. “What are you doing here, Malfoy?”
“Ginny… You know what I did today after Draco left and Scorpius went back home? I went into Draco’s studio. I wanted to… I don’t know. Destroy it? And when I entered — dear Salazar, I think I hadn’t entered his studio in years. Years. And when I did, a lump formed in my throat and I started crying and crying and crying, until I had no voice, until I felt completely empty. His shelves… oh Gin, his shelves are full of gay books and films and photos of him and Harry. I lived there with him, how did I miss it? Where was I these last thirty-five years?” Astoria dropped her bowl and covered her mouth with her hands, trying to muffle her sobs.
“But won’t it hurt her? She’s used to us now!” Harry was clutching Lady Luck to his chest so hard Draco really feared he’d crushed her shell.
They walked towards the shore with a light breeze ruffling their hair, the sun almost rose, resting on the horizon line with the water.
And still.
Draco beamed, the tears finally gone from his face.
When Malfoy left his mouth to trail kisses along his jaw, Harry groaned, bucking his hips forward, searching for friction. Malfoy smiled against his cheek and brought a hand to his hip, pushing it into the mattress, with a strength Harry knew would have left bruises. This thought made Harry’s head spun, and he started to unleash incoherent begs, “P-pease, let me move, l-let me… I-I need…”
Draco leaned on his hand, whispering, "From time to time…"
Draco flushed to the tip of his ears and nodded. He had ranted hours on end about the cashier who didn’t let him finish his
His moans and ragged breathing filled the room until Harry was so aroused he worried he’d come in his trousers without even touching himself.
Half an hour later, Harry was free; Jacob and Louis were being transported to the Ministry jail, leaving Harry and Draco alone in the room. They looked at each other, twenty years of want and love leaping out of them.
Harry had shaken his head, unable to believe his lucky stars. He had grinned, asking only one last thing. “Where did you buy it, Draco? Can we trust it?”
“You’re such a drama queen. I ask myself every day why I’m still friends with you.” Pansy shook her head and took one slice of garlic bread, taking a small bite. Draco smiled, remembering the first time they’d come here and Pansy’s disgusted face.
It was sold for 30 thousand Galleons.
“First name, Draco? Wow, you must be really upset. Is it this attractive young boy’s fault?”
As soon as he stepped foot into his flat, a voice dangerously similar to Potter’s rang in his head, ‘Honestly, Malfoy, why do you always forget to cast Weather Charms?’ It was something Potter liked to tease him about. Potter was right — Draco was a pureblood, someone who grew up with magic as the most natural thing in the world; it should have been second nature.
“Yes! How do you know that?”
They had started with short trips, one to five minutes back in time, and to the very close past — one to twenty hours earlier.
“Never, for the love of Salazar, Draco! I would
The delicious blush appeared again on Potter’s cheeks and his voice wavered slightly. "See, I'm a bit worried, because…" Potter cleared his throat, tapped his fingers on the table. "She seems… slow. I mean. Slower than usual…"
Draco’s heart beat fast in his throat, making him sound weak with emotion. “Us.”
Harry watched as Malfoy’s tongue peeked out to wet his lips, already imagining the thousands of ways this could end up. Badly— extremely badly.
Before opening his eyes, Draco felt Harry’s distance from the cold spots he left on Draco’s sides and lips; the heat of his body gone. Startled by his shouting, he hurried to flick his eyes open to see a peacock attacking Harry. Specifically, it was pecking Harry’s arse, without showing any sign of letting go.
Albus raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips. “Dad, please. I knew you felt something for Draco well before today.” Harry grinned, and Albus quickly concluded, “That said, it doesn’t mean I am fine with this. You hurt mum, and that’s never fine. You’ll have to work hard to regain our trust. But… I wanted you to know, I am here for you too.”
Frozen in their spots, Draco and Potter listened while a portrait of Draco’s great-great-grandfather just next to them started to sing:
"Of course, we told you that! We would have never used it without being sure it could work."
He said it as if it was nothing, a clinical condition. But Harry knew better. This situation was a gigantic fuck up.
They had lived everything in a dreamlike way, discovering they were in Sweden. They stayed there for an entire year, from December 1997 to December 1998. Harry remembered exactly where he was in that period: hunting Horcruxes with Hermione, hopeless, cold, desperate. A few dialogues with Malfoy and Harry knew he didn't have good memories about that time either.
she want to do with the property? Draco was afraid she wanted to burn it down.
Potter stuck out his tongue, waving a hand and muttering “bye!” before closing the door behind him.
"Boo-boo, believe me… we'd stay if we could, b-but—"
Thirteen years together could do that.
"He means we tried to track him down but it looks like Jacob has disappeared from Earth, Harry." Hermione sat on the bed next to Harry, careful not to touch him.
Ron rolled his eyes, his lips twitching. “You’re seriously damaged, Malfoy, if you think I’d ever willingly think of you as a possible partner—”
Hermione raised an eyebrow as Harry went on. “I’m serious! It’s not normal; we do it
“I thought you’d be mad at me,” Draco said carefully, levitating his coat and shoes toward his wardrobe. He padded towards the sofa, sitting next to Potter.
Harry looked as Malfoy's lips tightened in a thin line, his eyes veiling darkly.
The only audible sounds were his hurried step, heavy breathing and desperate, broken crying.
She turned her head when she was on the last step. “Oh Draco, I am so excited! Look how beautiful the Manor is! It will be so fun!”
Hermione looked at him with an eyebrow raised, murmuring, "Harry? Draco?", and Harry waved a dismissive hand at her, and they sat facing Malfoy who was currently looking down at the parchment on his desk.
And really, it made all the sense in the world, but it never hurts to try, right? Well, it hurt a little bit when no one answered his message and the mobile discharged completely.
“Just how many portraits do you have, Malfoy?” Potter was wiping the few tears stuck in his lashes, a hand on his belly. “This night is weird, perhaps the weirdest of my life, and believe me, I’ve had some very peculiar days.”
waiting for Harry’s next words. “Big Tuna? Isn’t he the head of that new gang...”
Well, that’s not entirely true. But he had come back and decided to do something artistic. He’d work out his frustrations through art.
"Yes, sir! I'm part of the mission, this is exciting!"
, thank you very much.”
“You laugh and you look so carefree and you don’t have to do anything else but laugh,” Malfoy’s voice was soft against Harry’s cheeks, a soft contrast to the tingling that was running through Harry’s entire body.
“Malfoy?” Harry called. His head felt weirdly light, his shoulders relaxed as if… Harry looked around himself again when Malfoy’s angry shout reached him.
Once back to their room at the Leaky, Harry sat heavily on the bed, taking off his shoes while Draco went to shower.
Just when you decide to turn around and run the fuck out of the pub, he cocks his head and his eyes find yours.
Potter clicked his tongue, looking annoyed. “You know, you gotta stop doing that.”
Harry’s cock jolted in his pants. “Shut up,” he murmured and watched Malfoy shudder again and
He took a deep breath, lowering his eyes to his own cup.
"I was doing sun salutations. Which reminds me… I've got a funny feeling. I really think we've been here for more than twelve hours."
“Naked Harry Potter Saves the Day Again— Or Is He Slowly Turning Mad?” was Ginny’s favourite title for it.
Except Harry never really got along with the Floo. And he was anxious and
Harry glared at him. Ron sighed. “Look, mate, I’m sorry. I’m sorry we didn’t tell you about this investigation, that we…” he trailed off, picking at invisible dust on his shirt. “I wanted to tell you, but…”
“Yes! Ehhh,” Seamus crooked his head, regarding Harry with a smirk on his face that only widened when he slurred, “Have ya ever had a gay fling?”
London then. Thank fuck. But definitely Muggle London. Looking into the streets, Harry didn't recognise the neighborhood, though.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and took a quick glance inside the box too. He snorted incredulously, his eyebrows now flying above his hairline. Everyone started to talk at the same time.
,” Harry moaned, pushing Draco onto the mattress. “First let me just…” He sat between Draco’s thighs, lowering his head to Draco’s cock, taking it all the way down his throat in one, long suck. Draco cried out, his hand flying to grasp Harry’s hair, tugging on it desperately.
"The princess awakens," he snarled, accompanying his words with a sweeping gesture towards Harry.
“Oh, honey—” Pansy reaches out, her hands brushing Draco’s cheeks. Draco can’t stand it; he needs to get away before he makes a fool of himself.
“Oh, Harry, of course yer allowed.”
Harry loved watching Draco sleep. It was the moment when he was the most sincere,
Slowly, they all came back, flowing into Harry's mind like gentle waves on the shore of the ocean. Luna, Rolf and Neville had organised a New Year’s Eve party at their place, an immense farmhouse with endless gardens, full of magical creatures and plants growing everywhere.
Draco crooks his head, his eyes wrinkled. “What?”
Harry had been so thrown by the ‘fuck’ that he almost didn’t notice Malfoy coming completely untouched. A second later, Malfoy was already on his back, breathing slightly altered, cleaning charm done.
Everyone speaks at once.
!" Harry snapped, the head of everyone in the room turned to him at once.
Soon most of the people joined them on the dance floor, smiling heartily when passing Draco and Pansy.
Harry regretted with a passion that he couldn't touch anyone because he would have loved to shove the git, and his damned gorgeous smile, away right now.
Harry's eyes widened — was Malfoy sharing personal information about his private life, his childhood? He held his breath and then released it, falling back into known dynamics.
They spent every Christmas together, with the Granger-Weasley family too. Draco and Hermione bonded almost immediately over books and a shared interest for everything that resembled a good study subject; and even with Ron, the relationship was still on a basic level but they would occasionally hang out together.
“There,” you snarl, rough, angry. “You’re marked too, now.”
“Wait!” Draco exclaimed. He ran to his writing desk, barely registering that Harry had just called him
By the end of the night, he was bent over his sofa, Malfoy behind him, his cock pumping mercilessly inside Harry.
“Draco.” A deep voice startled him. “I saw the way you were looking at me.”
“If you’re grossed out, we’ll stop, I promise.”
A suspicious wave pushed him into Harry’s chest and his arms quickly wrapped around Draco’s waist, holding him in place. Harry’s lips sucked Draco’s earlobe making him squirm and hard again, making his arousal spike. He kissed Harry, sliding a hand underwater, brushing it down Harry’s chest, finally grasping his cock, moaning into their kiss, feeling Harry thrust into his fist.
“Arrogant git,” Draco muttered, his spent cock giving a throb at Potter’s words. His mind reeled with images of Potter fucking himself with his fingers in a pub’s loo, thinking about what he’d get
Harry tucked a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “Soon. Soon, I promise.”
“Sure, let’s go. I know just the place.” Draco got up, taking his cloak from the coat stand next to his desk and walking past Ron. “You’re paying.”
-ing a red bottle. Dragon’s blood, Harry recognised. Malfoy sighed before continuing. “Okay.
“Herm!”
Draco’s lips stretch into a smirk. “Dirty, dirty Potter. You’ll be the ruin of me.”
Harry was scratching the back of his neck. “Honestly, I don’t know. But we can’t tell them off, now. Ugh, that’s
? It was too much. “Excuse me,” he muttered, then finally crossed the last few metres to the window doors of the ballroom and exited to the gardens.
Trembling. Sweaty. Cheeks red, lips shamelessly apart, wanton, hair messily spread around his head.
look. To finally get Potter on his knees, furious, fired-up, ready.
“Pfft, are you— oh Merlin, are you telling me that for all those years…” Pansy tried to talk between one laugh and another, a hand on her belly, tears in her eyes.
Draco reached a hand between the cleft of Harry’s arse cheeks, but Harry batted it away.
Harry snorted and approached Draco. "Happy Anniversary, honey," he whispered, sitting on the bed, eyes still fixed on Draco's perfect skin. He knew every single mole, scar, vein, and inch of that man by heart.
with this ghost story?”
Malfoy and him, laughing while doing silly dances around the room, trying to avoid the desks and inevitably bumping them.
She picked up immediately, her tone worried. “Harry? Harry, where the hell have you been?”
“I—” You really don’t know what to say. Granger sits on the table, waves her wand to put the kettle on.
"You know I fell in love with you when I saw you dying your hair for the first time. It's become a regular thing now, but black doesn't suit you. Time for a change!"
When Malfoy spoke, Harry’s arousal fired up so much he wondered if Malfoy was using his Veela powers again.
“Draco, we have a whole new stack of dye, what’s the mat—”
of times.”
“But I don’t need to go to the bathroom…”
Draco brought a hand to his mouth, tracing his upper lip with his finger. It sent sparks down his spine it was so sensitive.
But before he could open his mouth again, Potter smiled and it was so warm, so tender that Draco’s chest ached.
“Dromeda… why is Teddy’s hair so…” Harry struggled to find a word until nothing better than, “Malfoy-ish?” came to his mind.
“Can we go retrieve the potions and Cloak?”
Harry blinked, feeling his face heating up at the slight accusation in Ron’s voice. “I… Everyone knows…” he said. His mouth suddenly seemed dry, and when he tried to swallow, he ended up in a fit of coughs.
They went over the edge together, murmuring sweet and dirty words to each other the whole time — for a long time their moans, their broken ‘yes, fuck, yes’ and the indecent sounds of their bodies sliding together were the only sounds audible in the room.
“Well, we have all the food I’ve cooked and you have a bedroom…”
Harry leaned forward, slotting his mouth over Draco’s.
“Do you ever shut up?” was Harry’s next question.
Right. This really
Harry reached him, slouching towards him reluctantly, muttering that, “You actually have it…”, gaining an angry wave of Malfoy’s hand in his direction.
how to behave at social functions.
Draco shook his head. Jerome didn’t understand; this was a matter of life and death. “Jerome, listen. This is serious. This chef, they don’t know it yet but we’re meant to be. We’ll marry and have kids and live happily ever after. I know it, but I can’t fulfil our destiny if you don’t help me out.”
“Are you still with me?” Harry was looking at him, his thumb stroking endless circles on Draco’s neck.
"Who?"
“Ugh, you’re so cheesy.” Draco rolls his eyes and fakes gagging—always such a drama queen.
his glasses and the list, and within seconds a scrunched up parchment flew to his hands, while his glasses landed with an ungracious smack on his forehead.
“It isn’t,” Harry conceded with a smile. “But… there’s no explanation to it, but I do have some qualities… I don’t know. They told me sometimes you get some qualities of your Animagus animal, but, er…”
“Ugh.” Harry scrunched up his face, snorting a little. “I think— I think my Veela wants to protect you. I’ve felt like this for a while now.”
Harry sighed. Old memories of old times. He let his body slide down on the bed and turned off the lights. The next day would be a hard one.
“The t-shirt too, sweetheart.”
“What now?” He asked, not taking his eyes off the papers. Usually, Hermione was one who concentrated while working.
bonding spell, and in the end, Harry felt a little bit better.
A chilling breeze made the hairs at his nape stand up on end. Draco hated winter, he always got a cold and never felt warm enough when going out. He probably should head home.
It was a week before Draco saw Potter again. He knew he hadn’t behaved particularly well— after the last time, Draco never reached out to him and Potter hadn’t written anything either. Technically, there wasn’t anything wrong with that. They weren’t
“Yes, Nev, I love the surprise! Thanks, guys!” He finally felt light-hearted and tranquil, after days closed in at St. Mungo’s. A reunion with his closest friends was exactly what he needed.
A single reply, Hermione's. "Oh, Harry."
You come as he trails his fingers on your temples, kissing your nose. You don’t tell him you can’t keep doing this because in a year you’ll be married.
With a deep moan, Potter released Draco’s cock and leaned his head against the wall, closing his eyes.
When Ron left, Harry became intensely aware of how empty his last two days had been —if one didn’t count scorching hot sex of course— and the air felt suddenly too dense to breathe regularly. If that was how Harry felt after two days, how could he go on like this for … who knew how long?
Whatever response was on the tip of Harry’s tongue, it died when he saw Malfoy sitting on the bed, legs sprawled, completely naked, gasping on the word ‘sweetheart’ as he was stroking his cock in long, teasing tugs.
Harry looked at Draco perplexed — other friends? And who, exactly?
Harry and Draco exchanged a perplexed look, Boo-boo usually didn’t react like that to their fights, but they let it go. All in all, time was passing for him too.
Triwizard champion.
“My, my, Potter, you’re so busted.” Zabini was having too much fun for Harry’s tastes.
They both gasped and Harry raised his knees, planting his feet on the bed, digging his fingers in the soft flesh on Draco’s hips, knowing he’d leave bruises and smiling because that wouldn’t be a real pain, but something welcomed.
-notebook looked like a fifteen-year-old's filled with the bane of their favourite star.
And Draco had blushed, so bright and red against the weak shine of the moon. And Harry had kissed him, desperate, hot, messy.
.” Potter was barely refraining from bursting out laughing, an ear-to-ear grin plastered on his face.
Harry entered Andromeda’s house with a little package in his hands and halted abruptly on the doorstep.
In an effort to regain control of the frozen room, Draco cleared his throat, startling Mr Serkin who promptly smiled back at the people seated in front of him. “If no one else has any offers…” he trailed off, searching the room for other bidders’ intentions. “Well, then… Going once, going twice, sold. Malfoy Manor goes to Hermione Granger for 16 million Galleons.”
One of Malfoy’s feet slowly slid down Harry’s chest, until it reached Harry’s hard cock and found its place there again, rubbing and pressing and Harry had to mentally conjure a brief image of Dudley eating his birthday cake to avoid coming on the spot.
They exchanged a look, still breathing heavily.
Harry watched Draco’s back as he walked away, his shoulders tight in a nervous line. He and Boo-boo stayed together for the rest of the morning — Boo-boo kept telling Harry he needed to fix things with Draco, that he was probably only scared by the situation, that they could overcome it.
Pansy smirked, leaning in toward Draco. “Ron may not have talked about Harry, but he did tell me something rather interesting.”
Potter cocked an eyebrow, a knowing smirk appearing on his plump lips. “Who’s the quick-tempered, easy-to-jump to conclusions one, now?”
resting in his bedroom and Ron’s face looking so guilty, so fucking miserable.
Draco almost choked on his mouthful at the image, his eyes quickly filling up with tears as they darted around the restaurant. It was the perfect metaphor. Every wall was of a different colour, flowers everywhere— hanging from the ceiling, the walls, off the tables, on the floor. Small bottles floated around the guests, holding all kinds of spices, both Muggle and Wizarding, ready to be used at any moment: oil, salt, pepper, special sauces with avocado, or something called
You turn him around, make him stumble until he’s face-first against a tree. He’s bucking his hips backwards, already panting. Everyone should see him like this, you think. So you say it.
Six months in, and Harry was dying with frustration. Every time they watched a movie with Boo-boo or went out eating all together like a happy family, he’d think he wanted to hug Draco, hold his hand, kiss him, stroke his hair, anything, anything to have some contact. But the potion only helped his bond to be dormant, not to shield him from the pain he’d feel when touching someone else.
Harry sucked in a breath, trying not to panic at the memory. That had been a moment during their living in Muggle London that he really wished he could erase from his memory.
“Fifty percent of the people think the chef could be African, forty-six percent think they might be Asian…” Draco quickly scanned the results of the poll. Pansy was right. He tossed it onto the table, scowling.
“Seriously? You’re a Veela, Malfoy.”
“Draco, I have to tell you something—”
who decided to take the Dark Mark,
They slowed down together with the music. A new composition was about to start, Beethoven again. Walking towards one of the stalls with beverages, Draco side-eyed Pansy, an amused smirk on his face.
“Fuck,” he breathed, leaning down towards Draco’s neck. “Fuck, fuck Draco you’re so warm.”
Draco rubbed his face on Harry’s, laughing lightly. “It’s weird to feel you without a beard,” he giggled, raising from Harry’s body and slipping out of him. Harry whimpered and pulled him down again, capturing his swollen lips in his mouth, sucking on them.
Somehow, you believe him.
Potter’s jaw dropped open, and his eyes popped as he flushed brightly in the semi-darkness of the pub. He looked between the slice of lime in his hand and his glass, blinking several times as if he hadn’t realised what he was doing until that very moment. Draco hated himself for possibly breaking whatever spell had possessed Potter to do all that in front of him.
“Oh, so you
“No!” Draco almost shouted, then felt his cheeks aflame with embarrassment. He added, more quietly, “No, don’t say it. There’s no me
“Good morning Auror Harvey,” Harry said, leaning a large cup of cappuccino on his desk. “What do you have for me today?”
He’s taking it like a star, lips swollen, painted violet with a new lipstick he bought for only you to see.
“Stop reading!” Harry ordered, sitting up right.
“Eloquent as always. Potter, does it seem to you as an honest spell, this one?” He asked with a raised eyebrow.
Malfoy's eyebrows wrinkled at this, his lips stretching in a "huh" expression. "Idiot, we have an Invisibility Cloak."
Malfoy had immediately told Harry they needed to put aside their animosities if they wanted to collaborate, and Harry had agreed as if more than a decade of rivalry could be so easily put aside.
But Potter just nodded, wiggling his eyebrows. “Maybe I’ll surprise you.”
ed the black rope, his favourite. “Then I’m going to tease you,” he continued and this time, a long dark green feather flew into his hands. Harry’s breath hitched in anticipation.
They checked the time, knowing their old selves were now still in Harry’s room and walked to it, learning more about what it meant to move around being invisible. Once in the room, they watched as their past-selves argued and talked about the bond.
Malfoy didn’t so much as flinch. He just smirked, and unclasped his arms, brushing one hand down Harry’s chest. “Will you? Such a good boy, aren’t you, Potter?”
“Fine.”
Harry scanned the drawings on the walls, impressed by the quality of art drawn by a five-year-old kid. He couldn’t draw like that now, and he was forty-three. Draco drew incredibly detailed landscapes, his house, a squirrel, a hippogriff, the peacocks, lavender fields… he used to draw anything.
How they’d switched, they’d tried both roles, how nothing was decided and precise, because fuck the world, everyone wanted something from them, but they could be free together.
Draco cleared his throat, sure this time the blush was taking over all his face. “So, we shall start.” Everyone’s head now snapped to him. “I will now turn the floor over to the auctioneer, Mr Serkin, who’ll lead the Auction from now on.”
He was munching on his chocolate bars, sat on the bed, a blanket pulled up to his neck. Harry was eating a strawberry muffin, sitting next to him.
Draco shot her a glare that he hoped looked murderous but more likely only looked watered-down and wobbly. She laughed and went to go dance, dragging Luna Lovegood out of Merlin knows where. Had she always been there with them?
He closed his eyes, arching his back off the bed, sinking his hand into Malfoy’s hair, trying to disentangle his other hand from Malfoy’s grip.
Memories again filled his mind, memories of how they’d discovered the freedom of letting go, of being at the mercy of the other and forgetting their destined paths for a moment. How Harry had discovered Malfoy could make him come only spanking him, barking at him to stay still, to take him in his mouth.
He chuckled and, trying to avoid Draco’s glare, he turned to hug Pansy. “Gorgeous. You’re absolutely gorgeous, my lovely. That dress is perfect for you, your beautiful body will turn some man mad tonight!” He kissed her cheeks, making Pansy’s blush extend toward her collarbone.
Harry's mind was still racing with all the new information he was trying to sort out, and he couldn't avoid speaking to Malfoy, whispering, "I still don't understand how is it possible that Hermione got us here. Our
Once under the Cloak, they followed the two men inside. They decided Boo-boo, still looking frantic and excited, should wait for them outside and watch if anyone else arrives — Boo-boo had already seen and heard enough.
His hands are now in your hair— he can untie those cords whenever he wants to, the bastard. Just like he’s always been able to untie your life, your heart, your soul, too.
“It’s fine.” She answered pronto. “They know already, and they are here now, so let’s just be done with this.”
So now Draco Malfoy is.
Alicia opened her mouth to speak, when her wand suddenly started wailing and flashing red.
"I'm kidding." He winked and cleared his throat, as if he needed to gain time to gather his thoughts.
“I see,” an amused voice said softly, making Draco’s head snap up. His cheeks tingled with warmth once he recognised the timbre.
“These are completely useless. If we want to discover their identity, we need to concentrate on different details.”
Now that he had started, he felt as he could never stop anymore. Harry had bottled up his mixed feelings towards Malfoy for so long that now he felt like an erupting volcano, the anger boiling in his veins like lava, ready to reach out and swallow Malfoy and everything else.
"Another drink,
Draco shivered against him, his hands gripping the couch in anticipation. He breathed, “
Hermione had told him that Malfoy had his own selected team of Curse-Breakers, only rarely consulting with the Ministry, usually for their most complicated cases.
"C'mon, don't tell me you like Geremia's attitude! I know for sure you don’t like presumptuous bullies." He winked, the presumptuous idiot, turning to face Hermione and Geremia, his tone as cold as stone.
“You didn’t,” Harry had whispered.
He was wearing short dungarees, big square glasses and a sad frown.
Malfoy raised his head, chopped mandrakes’ roots in his hand. “Mmmh. It makes sense,” he muttered. “It responds well to you, doesn’t it?”
“Potter,” Malfoy breathed, bringing a hand to his face. “Just order me to cook you breakfast.”
and Granger is Granger, two Heroes can do whatever they want."
Harry’s so confused he can feel his thoughts painfully crossing his mind, zig-zagging around. When Zabini sighs and turns to go out of the classroom, Harry snaps out of his stupor.
No, ugh no. He couldn’t just start with
Draco reached his location next to the big reproduction of the ocean he created into a cavernous room where the sample turtles were currently living, taking out his notebook and a pen.
The first time they met there, it was weird.
“What!” Harry said with a surprised laugh. “I’ve travelled by dragon, it can’t possibly get more dangerous than that!”
Malfoy's face scrunched up in disgust and Harry felt the sudden urge to kick his shins under the table when he remembered that that would have hurt him more than Malfoy.
They laughed together, until Malfoy's eyelids started closing again and he whispered, “So, roommates… sure, so brilliant, Harry Pottah… just, we... see... the bond, one bed. Cast a no-touching spell for the night and… we should disguise ourselves.”
to see you naked, Harry, Boo-boo seems the quickest and easiest option. Now shut up, or we'll miss what Jacob said."
He spent the entire night drinking, getting steadily drunker until no one could understand a single word he said.
Fifteen minutes later, they were walking together towards Grimmauld Place, half of Harry’s trunk filled with flasks of potions, feeling relaxed for the first time in days. He was happy to be talking about something that wasn’t his bond and listened to Neville’s stories about his plants without even interrupting him.
Harry stared blankly at him.
but still very naked and confused.
“Now, as for desserts, I was thinking—”
He was starting to relax when the feather returned to stroking Harry’s stomach, the dimples at his hips, and he laughed, body trapped by Malfoy’s weight, face inches from Malfoy’s.
“That would be horrible,” Harry mutters.
Potter smiled back, understanding passing between them. It felt intimate, close. Too close. Draco shook his head, inhaling slowly. They were only fuck-buddies; no need to read meaning into a simple smile, little confessions like these.
He shook his head to clear it. Not the right moment.
Malfoy had frozen and done it again. Harry had shaken his head, cried out, “Stop, stop, it tickles!” and Malfoy had found it amusing, the berk. It hadn’t been to anyone’s surprise that Malfoy loved torturing Harry during sex— a bit much of a surprise for Harry to learn just how much he liked being tortured, especially by Malfoy, in bed.
It makes Harry’s skin prickle. How easy it is for Malfoy to look so put together and how easy it is for Harry to always look debauched, just fucked, messy and scrawny.
Malfoy had huffed, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and index finger. “Merlin, you’re daft. I’m not a healer and I’m definitely not your healer, but right now I’m collaborating with the medi-witches and wizards on your case and lime-green robes is the uniform to wear in hospitals.”
Draco sat on the sofa, staring at the door for a full minute before scoffing. He was
Harry was still training when the news about the Malfoys came out.
Before Hermione could reply, Geremia's dry answer interrupted them. "You don't know what you're talking about, we're professionals. That ghost must have been a poltergeist and he certainly played a little joke on you two. I wouldn’t expect for someone like you to fall for it."
He smirked and sucked the tip of Draco’s cock back into his mouth, groaning around it as he reached his hands around Draco’s legs to cup Draco’s arse.
Harry was completely covered in blood, from head to toe.
“Harry’s deflowerment,” Neville announces gleefully.
Potter arrived to pick him up at 10 pm. They met in front of Draco's lab because it was closer to the cafe they chose.
"From now on you're wearing it natural, I'm begging you."
The Manor had looked empty and crowded all the same. Its hollow corridors echoed of Draco’s steps, reminding him he was there alone. Then he would open a door, find a room where the Dark Lord —
“Ow!”
The chocolate was amazing. Harry only moaned slightly as a reply, and Malfoy went on, this time with a small smile playing on his lips. “It’s because of things like this—” he gestured around the room, “that they didn’t involve you in this case.”
. No, no, no, no. Draco stopped, wand fisted tight in his left hand, right hand clutching his robe at the chest. A feeling too similar to joy overcame him, but he had to will the illusion away before it took possession of every single fibre in Draco’s body.
Draco rubbed his eyes and smoothed his hair nervously back on his head, behind his ears. Since he started wearing it with its natural waves he was constantly worrying over its state. Sighing, he said, “I! Don’t! Know! You’re confusing me. If the ball is about to start, shouldn’t we go?”
St. Mungo's, then.
“Wow, Pansy was right, you do look like you’re about to come when you’re eating here.”
“I mean, I do need money to buy the ingredients. So… I’d need a job. And you, too. We’ll glamour and… but I’m sure they’ll fix this and we’ll be back in no time.”
“You agree with me, though. The fucking best restaurant in all of London.” Draco took another bite, smirking. “Despite hating it the first time we came here.”
He didn’t reply anything and Harry closed his eyes again, hoping he could get at least an hour of silence before the bond would activate again.
It was arousing even if not quite what Draco wanted. He took Harry’s wrist just as he was a knuckle in and pushed away his hand.
“Yeah, and oh Merlin, we also went house hunting and damn, all the shopping we did for the furniture together. We chose everything, even the beds and the curtains! You were so fixated with silk stuff and I wanted so badly to have a chromatically arranged house. I’m asking myself how did I not realise before I am gay, really.” Harry’s voice was rough for laughing so much. “We also tried the bed together to see if it was comfortable! You said–I remember it–you said ‘
The waiter arrived a few seconds later, letting out a soft snort as he poured them two glasses of their favourite wine. “Upset today, Draco?”
Potter stopped in front of the cherry wood doors and turned, scowling at Draco. Fuck, that was hot.
"Why all the "ssss", you sound like… like…"
“It’s not. I know, okay? I’m sorry, Potter.” Draco scuffed a hand on his face, closing his eyes, and when he opened them again, it was to find Potter looking at him with an astonished face.
“May I ask what the hell you’re saying?” Harry’s tone was light and playful and Draco let himself relax again, staring distractedly at the few raindrops trailing down Harry’s chest, entangling in his hairs, gathering on his nipple.
"A what?!" Malfoy's eyes widened briefly before he gasped and stepped back when Harry pointed his wand at him.
He didn't mean to sound genuine, but the mixed feelings towards Malfoy and his office and his damned uniform were starting to confuse Harry.
Potter squirms, moans, lifts a leg to put it behind your back. The invitation is clear. You let go of his cock, lick around your fingers, spit on them, and waste no time before swallowing his length again.
Harry did, his mind quickly scanning every possibility, looking into everything he could to get some clues of what was happening. Ron looked sideways at him, clearing his throat. “I can’t explain right now, I’m sorry we didn’t…” he left the sentence mid-thought to fumble with his wand and pointed it at Harry and Malfoy’s fingers, still entwined.
, until his breath came back regularly and the shouts ceased. He’d open his eyes, look inside the room. Make sure it was, indeed, empty.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Harry, how many times do I have to tell you, we can’t interfere with the—”
As he broke the kiss, the second Malfoy unbuttoned his shirt, making some of the buttons jump on the floor, and he put a hand on Harry’s chest, slowly sliding it lower and lower, until he grasped Harry’s cock.
"This time travelling isn't the most comfortable thing I've done, huh."
Potter’s thumb started stroking Draco’s neck, making him quiver in response. It was so delicate, yet it sent sparks through his body. “I know. That’s interesting, you could know more about Muggles than me, now. And with who did you plan to dance to this tonight?”
He glanced one last time in the mirror: he didn’t really love wearing clothes that were quite so casual, but Harry always looked
Draco beamed at the cashier as he went to pay. “Jerome—”
As if they didn’t already know.
The waiter looked around the table with his eyebrows wrinkled; they were usual clients there, all the staff knew them by heart, and he was probably sensing the tension at the table. Draco and Harry offered weak smiles to him and held their breaths in anticipation. Once he backed away, Ginevra asked in a whisper, “How long?”
Malfoy must have seen something on Harry’s face, because he smiled minutely and jutted out his head, their lips now wetly touching.
Malfoy snorted in the kiss, breaking it. “Oh Merlin, Harry, we’ll fight so much. We… I know things are not magically resolved now…”
“Damn, it is, isn’t it? It wasn’t my idea, I swear.”
. Not only because of how extremely unhygienic it all looked but because of the look on Potter’s face.
“Me,” you pant. Why the hell are you even speaking at this point? “I’m the whore, eat me,” you mewl. Pathetic.
he hissed, and —
“I want you—” he rasped, lifting Harry’s shirt, brushing his fingers to his ribs, feeling them expand with Harry’s ragged breathing, his chest, nipples. “I want you right now, Harry.”
“Because after the War, I lost everything! Not only my parents, my soul, but my magic as well. I’ve been living like a squib for the last five years; I don’t remember how it feels to even conjure a glass of water, nothing! My magic completely left me! That’s ironic, isn’t it? An evil Death Eater, a dangerous boy,
not to know what it meant and invented the story that sometimes one assumes their teacher’s Patronus. I was… oh Draco, I was so happy. I thought of telling you everything that day, you know? Of telling you I loved you too, of running away together, building a life together... But, the second time you did it in front of me, it had changed, and I was scared I had maybe only imagined all of that…” He was rubbing the label so hard, Draco feared it would catch fire.
Draco did
Draco sucked his lip into his mouth. What she was saying made sense. Dangerously scary sense.
. I just—” he swallowed, scratched the back of his neck. “I just feel angry, all the time. For all the injustice, the pain, the-the evil that’s still around and…”
When Draco exited the bathroom again and saw the changes in the room, he cast a low
“Fuck off,” Draco whispered, shaking his head.
"So?"
Harry pushed further, always checking Draco’s reactions, excited to see he was still sleeping, still murmuring like he always did while dreaming.
Draco thought,
Harry sucked in a breath. This wasn’t the answer he had expected. Actually, he didn’t know what he had expected. “Fuck ‘em,” was all he said, while with a hand he started to stroke Draco’s hair gently.
Draco had nodded, frantic, lifting his hips to slide his trousers and pants off. Potter took the hint and stood to finish undressing, then returned to straddle Draco in a blink of an eye.
Taking deep breaths to steady himself, Harry opened his eyes again, trying to remember what had happened.
“Yeah, right, um…” He enlarged everything on the kitchen table and Draco’s heart did somersaults in his chest. Everything smelled delicious, and his mouth watered in anticipation. The dishes looked absolutely perfect and varied and—
Taking Draco’s silence the wrong way, Potter snapped, “Aren’t you going to say anything?” and without waiting for a reply, he shook his head and returned his wand to the inside pocket of his suit. “I thought we were past our childish bickering.”
Draco squeezed his hand back, pulling him closer. "If I recall correctly, it was a turn-on for you,
“I—” Harry furrowed his brow as he watched Malfoy press himself against some faceless, sturdy-looking guy. “What do you mean,
“Well, if you must. One dance.” He hoped he sounded defiant and not at all desperate to get any kind of contact with someone who wasn’t Pansy or Blaise. To get any kind of contact with Harry Potter, finally.
Ron put down his glass. “Err, you know, Harry always talks about you and I couldn’t understand what he sees in you, but you’re actually okay,” he said before glancing somewhere past Draco’s right shoulder.
“Okay. I actually think it’s a good plan. We don’t have anything better to do anyway. The only thing I can tell you for sure is that, yes, I don’t need them while sleeping, and that even if I’m a good Occlumence, this isn’t like
“You’re still in time to back out, Potty.” Draco’s voice was light but the way he bit on his bottom lip spoke miles to Harry.
Before dinner was a bad idea; he wanted to enjoy his food. The same went for during the meal; it would be inappropriate. As for after… it seemed like the best option, though at that moment his cock perked up and he wondered whether it would be better to have sex before.
, for fuck’s sake. Draco first noticed it at Hogwarts and it looked like Potter never lost the habit. Whenever he had something in his hands, Potter licked it, as if to taste it, to discover if he liked it. It was incredibly unsanitary and unhygienic, and Draco totally hated it, it was the grossest thing he’d ever seen. Except, he completely lost it every time he caught Potter doing it.
Potter took it with raised eyebrows and a light snort. “Sure… Merlin, Malfoy, you’ve got a mobile? That’s new.” With careful movements, he took Lady Luck in his arms and moved to go out.
He spelled every word with as much spite as he could master. “Give me one reason why I should listen to you, you bastard.”
Things look to be getting worse by the minute at the Slytherins’ table. After Draco sends Harry that venomous glare, Harry sees him having a heated discussion with his friends until—wait, are those tears streaming down Draco’s face?
“Let us help.” Draco tried to intervene, to feel useful in some way. Hermione just walked passed them, laughing and muttering something he didn’t quite catch.
! People would go crazy with me, knowing I can’t defend myself, I can’t even
Then Malfoy straightened up.
"Absolutely not, I'd prefer riding a dragon bareback than marrying Harry Potter."
. It had never happened, not even during training.
Looking back on it, that was the reason Draco had hit on that guy earlier that night. He and Potter were at a pub with the usual gang —Ron, Pansy, Hermione, Luna— when a brown-haired bloke offered Draco a pint. Draco had glanced back quickly at Potter —who looked positively murderous— and smirked.
Jerome laughed, exchanging a glance with Pansy, his eyes crinkling. “Mate, drop it. If it’s destiny, you’ll eventually meet, right?”
"You're a soul-bond Curse-Breaker, so what…"
to say his speech before deciding exactly which words he’d used.
When Lucius Malfoy died, age forty-eight, it was on the front page of every Wizarding newspaper.
So that was how Harry came into his Veela inheritance, and how the entire fucking wizarding world not only knew about it, but knew about the failure of his first time.
Just when Harry's mind started going through all the possible things he could do or say to make Malfoy laugh and those dimples appear again — a silly dance? Some other scathing and bordering-on-offensive jokes? — Hermione turned her head and waved her hand for them to come over, quickly introducing her colleague Geremia Sprut.
“Ah, do tell me more, Harry. This sex, how do you have it? Is it very dirty? Rough? Angry?” Hermione looked seriously interested, and for a moment, Harry worried that she’d been caught up in his Allure, too.
Ron and Hermione left last. She kissed Harry on the cheek, whispering to his ear she was proud of him. For what, Harry had no idea.
However, it came to no one’s surprise that Hermione and Draco’s pranks were the best. They’d sworn war against one another, and even after Croaker banned everything, they kept the tradition alive with smaller pranks, little mischievous acts that
the solemness of the situation, of course — Draco put it in the drawer of his writing desk, watching it blend with all his other clues about the possible identity of the chef. He couldn’t believe he’d finally know soon.
“Sorry to break it to you, Malfoy, but I
He was just lying there, taking Harry like a good pet, coming untouched on Harry’s cock.
, then started kissing Harry again, whispering on his skin, “love, my love, so beautiful, so sweet, I love you, my love” over and over again.
Once back in the hotel, Draco with his cup of hot tea and Harry with a beer, they finally started talking.
Harry murmured, “I-fuck, Draco, I can do that, I can—”
“You know how difficult it had been for me to lose my magic. I lived in shame for five years, I was ready… damn, Pansy, I was ready to face the world out there. To tell everyone I’m reduced to a fucking squib and I am fine with it now — and then… then... Potter arrives and he had to go and fucking change everything, didn’t he?”
Harry propped himself up on his elbow, regarding him with a wary gaze. He opened his mouth to tell him off, when he looked at the two of them together and his cock hardened once again fully.
Harry released his grip on the turtle sighing, defeated and pouting. They were in Draco’s lab and he was running the last tests on Lady Luck to check everything was still fine.
“That’s what I’m saying!” Blaise snaps, dropping his fork to his plate. “Wait, what’s that face?”
Malfoy stopped laughing, bringing a hand to his face, as if trying to cover them.
“Do you like the surprise? We thought you’d need a distraction.” Neville levitated the trunk up to the bedroom and winked at Harry, walking towards the kitchen.
“Fuck, yeah, yes, I’m guilty of all that. I just feel like I
"Okay, okay," Draco replied with a snort, "I do love him." His cheeks reddened deliciously, Harry's heart skipping a beat at the sight.
Each word rolled out of Malfoy’s mouth in a visibly controlled effort to be kind. “Granger knows. See you tomorrow, Po—
Still. His hands were always just at the right place, at the right time— around Harry’s waist when he thought he couldn’t take the brutal pace anymore, rubbing at the small of his back when he needed soothing, tugging at his hair when he craved dominance.
Draco’s mouth hung open, and his eyebrows raised up to his hairline. “You didn’t know you were a wizard until you were eleven years old? Are you fucking kidding me?”
In the meantime, Mr Serkin was proceeding with selling the first object: a rare antique book about spells and rituals no longer used in the Wizarding World. Its value was solely historical; it was the only copy left in existence in the world. Draco risked a peek to the Golden Trio: could Granger be interested in it?
They spoke together as their gazes met and held. This wasn't possible, right? It was just too much alcohol. Yes, Draco was probably still tipsy from last night and hadn’t realised.
Malfoy smirked. “That’s a good sweetheart,” he whispered, laying the feather on the blanket next to Harry’s hips.
“I’ll start,” Malfoy said, turning his head to look up at Harry. “I’m fine with your feet kink, you can ask me to do stuff with them, just not to stick my toes in your arse.”
"See, this spell,
“Okay then. It's your birthday after all.”
Broken laughter started leashing out of him, as his body kept wriggling and writhing under Malfoy’s hands. His breath caught in his throat and tears prickled behind his eyelids— another wave of laughter came out of Harry’s mouth and Malfoy giggled, his fingers now brushing the underside of Harry’s balls.
Within ten minutes, they were back at Grimmauld Place, Harry bent over his kitchen table, his wings spread wide to his sides as Malfoy’s cock pounded incessantly into him.
She thins her lips. You used to be afraid of her. Now, she only looks tired and a little bit crazy.
“Oh Merlin, so it
Malfoy’s smile was smaller now but it seemed to give Boo-boo happiness all the same. He smiled and flew around the room, excitedly repeating, “yes! together again!” over and over again.
“Beautiful, handsome, my love, my love. I know your body by heart and now… I can touch you. My love.”
He had fucked up greatly.
for you. We could give it a go.”
Sour tears run down Harry’s face. “I missed you.” He repeated, sobbing.
A burning feeling in his pinky made Harry jolt out of his thoughts as Ron kept muttering something under his breath. Malfoy didn’t do as much as exhale a breath. He looked positively quite-dead.
Suddenly Malfoy pulled out his fingers, lingering on Harry’s lips, tracing their shape with a heated gaze. “Do you remember our first time?”
He went back to drinking his tea, tearing his eyes off Harry, picking up a biscuit.
Harry slowly raised his eyes to Geremia, pure rage thundering in his chest. Draco grabbed his arm, murmured to him to stay calm.
“Where are you coming from?!”
“Dear Lord, you haven’t changed either! I wonder what’s happening in your mind right now if you spaced out like that.” Potter smiled, a genuine smile, one that only people who’ve been intimate would share, one that made Draco’s heart swell in his chest.
He cleared his throat, luckily dropping the topic. "Here I am. In these three days we were able to create a potion that controls your symptoms."
“I love you.”
Right below the article was a photo of Harry and Draco holding hands and smiling. They didn’t seem to kiss, though.
A drop of rain fell onto Draco’s nose as his thoughts unravelled. He cursed and sped up his steps. He needed to hurry if he didn’t want to arrive late to his appointment with Pansy at Sweet Prophecies.
Ginny went to get some for herself and came back, laying down on the hammock next to Astoria. She took a deep breath. “Listen, Tori. This thing sucks, but… can I be honest with you?”
grow one, he only had some rough patches on his jawline. Harry loved it.
Pansy gasped, startling Draco who realised that the wine was about to spill over the edge of his glass. “Err,” he said intelligently, and proceeded to take a big gulp. Pansy shook her head, her eyes crinkling amused.
“That you WHAT, exactly, Harry?! Finish that, now! That you WHAT!” Ginevra was yelling now, and she raised from her seat, bumping a fist on the table. All the people in the restaurant turned their heads towards them.
Still high on endorphins, Draco turned Potter around to face him. Fuck, Potter looked beautiful. His hair was sticking out in all directions, his lips plump and shiny as if he’d bitten down hard on them, green eyes glossy with a hint of something unreadable that unsettled Draco.
Draco needed to know and felt his curiosity starting to get the best of him. He opened his mouth when out of the corner of his eye, he saw Pansy dancing with Blaise. Right, he needed to talk with Potter.
“Can you believe it?” He asked to Draco, gesturing annoyed.
“Oh fuck, yes, Malfoy, like this… and then, you slipped one finger inside me. It was,
Years later, when Scorpius, Albus or even Ron and Hermione would ask how was it possible they’d found each other in Mexico during funny — if verging on embarrassing — family dinners, Draco would still give the same answer.
So, during one of the times when Harry had got back together with Ginny, Harry decided to confront Malfoy. Or rather, Ginny had said something like
"It sucks, mate, but then we remembered you ranting hours on end about Malfoy's fame as a Curse-Breaker and, well, here he is!"
. Right. They felt shorter in Draco’s head, trapped in his thoughts, his fears, his misery. The composition came to an end, fading away. Draco opened his eyes, covering Pansy’s hand on his shoulder with his own.
When Harry felt solid ground beneath his feet once again he opened his eyes, looking around himself in confusion. Draco was crouched on the floor, his face the usual green-tone it assumed when they were transported from one era to another. Before he could fully take in where they were, a feminine voice reached his ears.
Harry nodded, taking a step forward in turn. “That’s fine. And right. I’m sure someone else could help us with that until you feel ready, maybe Parkinson or Zabini…”
“Sex?”
So here they were, snooping around Hogwarts from time to time, getting to spy on their old selves, mocking each other, showing Boo-boo around their old school. Apparently, he couldn’t be seen by the ghosts of Hogwarts either.
Draco turned his head, his sight wavering slightly. Perhaps he had too much to drink. “Oh, him. That’s just Julienne, a friend of my mother’s. He’s forty years old and I’ve got nothing against the age gap, but… no, thanks.”
“Tori…”
“Uuuh, did you hear the spite she put in your surname? Wow, this evening is turning  out to be
They stayed together another couple of hours, chatting about work and checking that Harry’s Fidelius on the house was still intact.
And in between all the rediscovery of each other, they’d visit loads of new places, Boo-boo and Harry competing on who was the most excited about it all. Draco was now completely addicted to Muggle culture and finally had his Royal with Cheese.
She approached the bed, huffing impatiently. “Harry, we have a brunch with our kids and their families today, did you forget? They’ll be here in one hour! You need to get ready. A sixty-year-old man sleeping in his clothes, without blankets. You’re not young anymore, Harry, you’ll catch a cold!”
” he whispered. Harry smirked around Malfoy’s hole before finally circling the rim with his tongue, so slowly he felt every wrinkle, every tiny movement of Malfoy’s anus.
“Oooh! Draco! This is not our house!” Harry sounded scandalised, but his hands were already skimming over Draco’s back, reaching his hair, tangling in it.
looks like this.
The rest of Draco’s words were lost. Harry’s mind finally clears and his head stops pounding so that now every thought is connected to the previous one and memories start flowing back to Harry.
“Snape? What—”
Somewhere during Harry’s rambling, Draco must have reached him because they were now standing mere inches apart. His gaze held Harry’s. “And?”
As he stared at Malfoy’s sleeping form, Harry felt his cock straining against the zipper of his trousers, and he hoped it was only morning wood and nothing more. He couldn't be attracted to Draco Malfoy of all people, after all his solitaire years.
After an hour, every nerve of Draco’s body was on fire, and he was ready to jump at the slightest contact or question. Pansy shot him a perplexed glance, which Draco tried to brush away with a shake of his head.
He didn’t even get to finish that sentence. Malfoy slept in Harry’s bedroom again, and by slept, Harry meant fucked again and again as they slowly made their way through their likes and limits all night long.
Potter smiled, his tongue delicately collecting the pre-come gathered on the tip of Draco’s cock before slowly circling the foreskin.
Draco covered his face with his hands, blushing to the root of his hair, muttering into his hands, “Dear Salazar, I’m the worst.”
But once a month. Once a month Harry gets to see him like this.
“Draco, glad to see you here,” she purred, sarcasm oozing out of every pore. “No flirting tonight? There’s a bloke at nine o’clock who’s been staring at you rather intently.”
“No, it wasn’t poisonous, you imbecile! It was Veritaserum. I mean, not
Their one rule in this whole arrangement was that they would come clean with one another if someone started having
“Um, yeah, sorry. Okay, well. Yes, it’s true. I cheated on you for the last year and I know… er, I understand, what you’re saying. I was not cheating on you physically in the years before, but I wasn’t completely involved in our marriage as I should have been. I was a right shite.”
Once at the table, they said their greetings to Astoria and Ginevra — all the while Draco was trying to avoid emptying his stomach on the table, right there. He took a deep breath and sat down, his hands trembling visibly. Astoria gave him a perplexed look, that he tried to brush aside offering a weak smile and a wave of his hand. She didn’t seem convinced, and with good reason.
"This is not a hangover, Mr Potter, as you should have realised by now. When you arrived here three days ago—"
It was already three o’clock. In just four hours Harry would arrive and Draco had to rehearse his speech. He stood in front of the ceiling to floor mirror of his bedroom, staring determinedly into it.
“Thought you’d appreciate it,” he says, wiggling his eyebrows.
A sudden pain in his chest made Harry drop the vase, which crashed to the floor and into thousands of shards. A trilling resounded throughout the shop, and suddenly Harry couldn’t think of anything, anything at all but getting to Malfoy, to
Draco had two tiny folding beds brought there: one for himself and one for Pansy. She didn’t live there, but she would stay for the night when Draco felt like he was drowning, like all the air was being knocked out of his lungs, leaving him sore and feeling completely lost; when the nightmares were so bad he was no longer able to separate real life from dreams.
“Actually, don’t answer that.” He suddenly turned towards Malfoy, piercing him with what he hoped was a glacial glare.
"Harry! Careful! Are you okay?"
“Come.”
Malfoy glanced sideways at him and took another puff. “Want one?” He offered, tilting the cigarette to Harry. Harry took a drag, if only to put his mouth where Malfoy’s mouth had been.
“Hola Malfoy,” he said, entering Draco’s laboratory.
He could feel Astoria’s gaze burning a hole in the side of his head, while saying a gritted, “Indeed. Your hands are shaking.”
As he shouts, his cock bobs in the air and starts shooting all over his stomach, your chest. His hole throbs furiously around you— it makes your head spin. You still inside him, filling him with your release: it feels endless.
With horror, you realise tears are streaming down your face, sobs keep slipping past your lips. Potter says nothing.
Draco gasped, more amused than scandalised. It had been clear for a while that Harry’s passion for tasting and licking didn’t actually disgust Draco. “That would be so—”
Harry would suck Draco off in his sleep, or brush his cock between his thighs slowly, trying desperately to not wake him up too early, swallowing every moan or groan that threatened to pull out of him at every thrust. But Draco always woke up and came with Harry. Not that Harry didn’t like it, he just…
“Potter,” you say, nodding. Up closer, Potter’s even hotter: the first thing you notice is that he’s not wearing his glasses. If you thought you’d ever seen green, you were wrong. He’s also wearing black eyeliner, which highlights his eyes and makes you salivate, and a shiny red lipstick that looks completely ruined. Like maybe he’s drunk too much or someone has smudged it with a kiss.
Where was he? Was he sure no one had done anything wrong to him? Panic started to coil in the pit of his stomach, worsening his sickness when the room finally stopped spinning and he started breathing regularly again.
“Oh god.” Malfoy’s entire body stiffened as he cried out, cum splattering everywhere on the rug, his hole spasming all around Harry’s tongue. He brought a hand to press to his cock, feeling himself getting closer despite being still fully clothed.
Just because he could, with Malfoy, like this, naked and hard, so hard, and happy, so happy.
Draco smirked, and slipped a hand into Harry’s pants.
Draco marvelled in the magenta shade Pansy’s cheeks gained, happy to pay back some of the embarrassment she always liked to use with his Potter situation.
Boo-boo simply flew into the car with them, poking around every seat and little pocket or compartment.
Harry made to do it, when a thought startled him. He looked at the two Malfoys and breathed, “No.”
Looking up at Harry, he said amused, “I feel like you have too much clothing.” With a flick of his wand, he Vanished Harry’s clothes.
He thrust a bit out and then in again, harder and deeper, until the diameter was simply too monstrously big to fit anymore. Draco gasped and bubbled nonsense the entire time, shaking uncontrollably and moving together with Harry’s thrusts.
He glanced over the crowd once again, wondering who’d get the Manor, what would they do with it. The price was already ridiculously high — 10 million Galleons — when a wand raised from the first row. A feminine voice. “I offer 16 million Galleons.”
“Yes.” Hermione nodded. “And I know who he is. Well, it makes sense, you know, you and Ha—”
Draco reached a finger to Harry’s cheek, grazing it light as air, slowly tracing his cheekbone.
capable of loving. Draco would dye his hair a different colour each month and this time he had red hair. It was while looking at his dyed hair that Harry knew it, once and for all, he had fallen for this eccentric Draco Malfoy, who loved doing yoga every morning, dyeing his hair, and looked like an angel every time he smiled.
The big cherry wood doors at the entrance were open, letting a sweet breeze come in, the smell of lilies and jasmines from the garden lightly lingering in the air. For the occasion, every single room in the Manor had been cleaned up, polished, and adorned.
Draco felt his eyes stinging and closed his hands in tight fists, trying to avoid bursting out crying in front of his son and his just-cheated-on wife. “I know, I mean, we didn’t plan it, Scorp. It just happened and I apologised to your mum, I never wanted to hurt her!”
, lately.”
They looked at each other for a moment before bursting out laughing.
Harry hurried to uncover himself, hoping he wasn't blushing too much, and trying to discreetly hide his bulge.
getting ridiculous. Harry is even more lost than before, if possible and his head still feels messy and crowded. What the hell is Zabini talking about?
!” Draco moaned, sitting up again. “It was going to be perfect, Harry!”
It was only one week without Potter. Draco could do it; he had
“H-here, here, it’s… just,
“Shut your mouth,” Draco all but growled. “And suck my cock. You like it more than I do.”
“Glad that’s settled.” Harry should have left, but then he asked, “Why did you become an Auror?”
"Breathe, Potter, or you'll faint again." His tone was unfairly soft now. It was so strange to hear him talk like that, that Harry forgot for a second what was happening, only able to focus on this weird version of Malfoy.
Harry looked at him, at his knitted eyebrows, his intense stare. “I do, I believe you. And… I never stopped loving you either.”
Resisting the impulse to simply shove his cock past Potter’s lips and down Potter’s throat always proved to be one of the hardest tasks in Draco’s life —even harder than sitting patiently through a crowded table of Malfoys asking him when he was going to produce an heir— but it was worth it.
“It’s
Malfoy turned his face to look up at him, and was it only Harry's imagination, or was his arse slightly undulating now?
"Please, sit down, Harry, try to breathe and calm down. This is an unpleasant situation, but I may have found a solution."
“You—” Malfoy’s breath was so hot, it made Harry shiver. “How dare you—?”
“Will you shut up?” Harry shouted embarrassed. “I've had enough of this.” He grabbed the bottle and spun it, watching with relief and only a touch of disappointment as the bottle stopped on Zabini.
“Well, what are you waiting for, then?”
He bit down on his bottom lip, fidgeting with his hands. Even without knowing too much about this apparently new Malfoy, Harry knew that wasn't a good sign.
At the end of the day they parted, and Draco found himself walking home instead of taking the Floo. He still hated the winter and cold and snow that remained glued to his lashes
,” he pleas, as he shivers uncontrollably.
“Fuck,” Harry whispered. He grasped Malfoy’s ankle, watching the action as if his hand had moved by its own volition. He watched as he stroked Malfoy’s skin, marvelling at the velvety feeling of it. The bottle of firewhiskey levitated in front of Harry and his glass was immediately full again; then Malfoy’s too.
Damn.
Harry.
Trust
Harry’s eyes were closed and he was almost dozing off when he heard before seeing Malfoy coming back. He cast a Tempus— Malfoy had spent more than an hour in the library.
Harry stopped dead, narrowing his eyes at Malfoy. "Sorry, but you just walked me right into it! Ugh, I hate this. I wanna be treated normally. And by the way, if that’s true, why are
“But it seemed an impossible task with Jacob gone. However, I—”
Harry looked back at Malfoy, his legs trembling with the effort of holding back his impending orgasm, a plea in his eyes.
“You’re all about first names, tonight, huh? She went to find Ron.”
Poppies had always been his mother’s favourite flowers.
Harry smirked, held Malfoy’s gaze. “You mean like this?” He asked innocently, playing with the tip of his fingers, finally sucking them again in his mouth.
Draco was at a loss on how to reply. Was Potter complimenting him? But what he said sounded like something intimate, not something that just anyone would notice, or could possibly like, about Draco. “I only do so when the food is good. And, you know—” Draco needed to say something, anything, that would bring them on more neutral ground. “I like it when you do that, too.” He smirked, hoping to sound mysterious and naughty.
Not the right moment to panic.
"For your information Potter, I don't spend all my time here. But I guess… for Lady Luck, we could arrange that."
“Sure, I was just, um. I’ll see you at Potions, yes?” Without turning around, Harry reaches the Slytherin table as all the students’ eyes turn to him.
Fuck. Oh, fuck. The
“Hotel? You romantic prat, where were you taking me?”
“I just don’t care what people think about me, Malfoy.”
Astoria hid her head in Scorpius’ neck, and he looked sadly at Draco, the anger seemed gone. “Of course, we will. But we’ll need time. Oh! Do James, Al and Lily know about this? I think today they have brunch together.”
Shit.
They had done activities before this, loosening Draco, who was now stuffed with a plug and ready for Harry. The idea of Draco sleeping with a fucking dildo shoved deep into his arse made Harry’s head spin and he finally undressed too, placing himself between Draco’s sprawled legs. He slowly pulled the plug out of him, staring as Draco’s hole fluttered around it. The movement made Draco whimper and Harry couldn’t resist but thrust his fingers in, wanting to make this last for as long as possible. He dragged his fingers in and out of Draco’s hole a couple of times, circling the rim when pulling them out completely, marvelling at the way Draco’s body kept shifting, trembling, the way his breath hitched or his mouth opened in faint moans.
“Well, open it, will you?” He throws the gift your way. You take it, bewildered. When you open it, you exhale in relief.
“Had enough, have we, sweetheart?” Malfoy asked, tone sweet. Harry swallowed, feeling his throat burning dry at the need to laugh and let his begs out.
"What! Draco! It's the Muggle equivalent of porn Pensieves. I can't believe you still don't know a thing about Muggle culture."
which was absurd, by the way. Harry
Draco kicked her under the table. She should stop saying such rubbish, honestly.
Draco snorted, closing the book in his lap. “I want you to know that I fully regret giving you free access to my flat.”
“Nope, but I’ve been here for the last three weeks — you’d think a bit of
Malfoy scrambled to sprawl on the rug, presenting Harry his arse canted up.
Draco turned his head; Harry was standing next to him, his arms rigid at his sides and his jaw clenched. Staring right in front of himself, he said in a broken voice, “I didn’t handle that very well.”
Harry’s hand tightened on Draco’s waist but he was silent and when Draco lifted his head to look at him, Harry was breathing hard, eyelids half-closed.
Harry had a second to spare a thought about Boo-boo’s previous life: how sad it must have been if he found everything so exciting? But he had to stop the thoughts when he saw Malfoy speed towards the car, and he hurried to follow it also, being careful not to smack against birds or lamp posts or traffic lights.
Draco felt mad, only mad people could fall so fast, so intensely, over someone else’s scent, taste, laughter, eyes. But Harry didn’t seem to think he was mad, or if he did, he probably was mad himself too, because he leaned in again and pressed his forehead to Draco’s, purring, “Kiss me one more time.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry rushes to say, interrupting Draco’s flow. “I don’t like Zabini.” He takes a deep breath, two, three. He can’t hold it back anymore. “I love you, Draco. I really do. And yesterday, it meant the world to me.”
"I-I forgot to take it yesterday before sleeping. Ugh, Dr-Draco, help—"
“Do you need…”
She stopped, biting on her bottom lip, her gaze shifting to Malfoy, who continued.
“The ghost?” Hermione asked. Geremia was still staring imperiously at them, his eyes cold as stone fixed on them.
He didn’t reply. Instead, he approached Harry, a predatory glint in his eyes. When he was mere inches from Harry he purred in his ear, “I have a birthday gift for you,
for breakfast. Then he pinched his arm in the strongest way possible to stop himself thinking such rubbish.
Draco sucked in a breath. He had talked with her these past weeks during the preparation when feeling particularly lonely and Pansy and Blaise weren’t there, and the topic of his sexuality came up fairly often. He had had a few experiences during Hogwarts years, but nothing serious and then, with the War over and his struggling, Draco almost forgot about his doubts, his fears about having to marry a pure-blood girl.
Harry spells the sheets to cover them up, kisses Malfoy’s ear. “All night long, love,” he murmurs back.
Harry sighed. Thankfully he had left the Aurors; picking up clues and staying calm really weren't his strongest skills.
Somewhere during Draco’s panic, Pansy must have ordered because the waiter arrived with a slice of apple pie for him and profiteroles for Pansy.
“Yes, well.” Draco smoothed a hand down his tie, his eyes glued to it. “You know, I had time to think during the past five years and I never thanked you for…” He flicked his eyes up, a slurpy noise distracting him. Potter was eating the cherry, and for fuck’s sake, was it necessary to make so much noise? Why couldn’t people eat cherries normally?
They started the so-called Eighth Year at Hogwarts, and they’re all in their old houses, their old dorms, their usual roommates. Dean, Neville and Seamus have an ongoing bet with Ron about Harry’s virginity—Dean and Seamus think Harry won’t be able to separate feelings from sex and will end up waiting for the ‘
He sat at the dining table, mouth salivating at the number of treats displayed. Strawberries with melted chocolate and cream; what looked like fresh bread with marmalades and butter; slices of apple, pear, banana with sugar; a carafe of orange juice and a kettle of hot tea; plus the deliciously aromatic steaming coffee pot.
You panic. Of course you do: Potter testified for you at your trial, effectively sparing you months, if not years, in Azkaban. It’s all too fresh: it happened barely a month ago. You still have to write that ‘thank you’ letter.
“I bet Bill and Fleur will look marvellous, they are always so sophisticated, don’t you think Draco?”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Draco, I have no time for your memories, right now. I can feel your hard cock twisting against mine… I know you’ve been like this for most of the luncheon.” Harry licked along his ear shell, making Draco shiver.
It's not like he hadn't changed from the pureblood elitist he used to be: he was almost forty-five years old, widowed, with a near twenty-year-old son, and he’d built his career mixing Muggle and Wizarding knowledge.
Forty-five. Draco was forty-five years old.
,” Draco found himself demanding as Harry continued to lick around his rim, his tongue maddeningly teasing Draco’s arousal. After a while Draco’s cock was fully hard, bobbing on his stomach with every lick.
“Fuck, Potter—” his voice was high and breathy. Harry sucked a kiss on his hole, growled, “Call me master,” and attacked Malfoy’s puckered rim again, licking and licking, moving a hand to cup Malfoy’s balls and massage them.
Harry was still wriggling, the feather now grazing under his arms, his chin, and he kept laughing, a broken high-pitched sound— he had no idea how Malfoy could find him sexy in this state.
Malfoy's cheeks pinked lightly as he hurried to sip from his cup, the steam blurring his face.
and that's Geremia, my co-worker. Everything that happens here is strictly private. Our Boss wanted me to make you swear an Unbreakable Vow but I managed to convince her not to. Behave yourself and don't make me regret it!"
Just when Harry’s ready to call it off and go back from where he came and demand Zabini to just explain himself, Goyle spots him and raises a hand. “Potter! Oi, Potter!”
“Kiss me, kiss me, Draco, kiss me,” Harry unleashed his plea in a stream of whispers, eyes still closed, mind clouded and intoxicated from the sent of Draco and the flower.
Harry didn’t even care. Draco’s hand sneaked to his front to grasp his cock as he bit down Harry’s neck.
Some lime juice was stuck on the corner of Potter’s lips, and whatever spell had hit Draco that night was still in effect because the next thing he remembered he was leaning in and licking it off with his own tongue. Off Potter’s lips. It was unhygienic, dirty, filthy and damn, so fucking hot.
"What now? We still have one hour and a half." Malfoy asked, looking around himself, being careful not to be seen by his past-self.
“But I won’t,” you continue as you line your cock to his hole, tight, too tight; he’s not prepared at all. You tease him, rubbing your cock head over his rim. “I won’t stop until I’ve filled your whore hole with my come.”
He nodded frantically, tilting his head to give Malfoy better access to his neck and a second after he felt Malfoy’s tongue trailing a long stripe along his throat, his Adam’s apple, biting gently at his flesh, the contact once again making Harry’s world spin around him.
Harry came, crying out Malfoy's name. Malfoy had only tightened his hold on Harry’s hips, smirked in the crook of his neck as he stilled inside him and filled him with his warm come.
"Oh, that’s great! I’m Harry and this boring idiot is Draco. Want to follow us into the coffee shop? We were about to enter."
fucked yesterday night?” She gestures between Blaise and herself, and then glances at Draco.
Malfoy and him, studying together in the weirdest uncomfortable positions only to be the closest possible.
Your heart skips a beat as your throat dries. You swallow painfully around it. She’s never been an affectionate mother, but she’s loved you. She’s raised you. You owe it to her; it’s not like you can say,
It didn’t take long. Draco accepted the pint and headed over to the dance floor with the bloke. He didn’t even remember the stranger’s name, or even the colour of his eyes, for that matter. Draco had kept his gaze fixed on Potter— on how Potter’s jaw clenched from anger, on the way his tongue had darted out to lick his probably rage-dried lips, on the almost-white knuckles of fingers curled around a glass of whiskey.
all the fantasies would be forgotten when he starts giggling as he unbuckles his belt. Salazar, he’s roaring drunk.
? Sure, he was training as an Auror, but he was too evil to look so hot. He even wore leather trousers, see-through shirts, and glitter on his eyes sometimes.
Harry hated it.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Draco’s tone came out tired and resigned: he spent so much time worrying about Potter attending his Auction that really he couldn’t be upset over his omnipresence now.
“I wasn’t looking at
Draco shook his head, the room spinning around him again. “No! I order the pizza and you go to the bathroom—”
“Oh, ‘Mione, Ron. We wanted to get a breath of fresh air. What are you doing here?”
