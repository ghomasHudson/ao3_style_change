“Eventually you get tired of waiting.” Draco says, putting to words the painful lesson of his own recently failed relationship.
“Yes. Your son is worried about how sad you are. How long has it been since your wife passed?”
“You and I are a great family all on our own” Scorpius’s words were slightly muffled as he buried his head in Draco’s shoulder.
Harry took several steps into the gazebo and looked around - there, on a bench nearly hidden in shadow, sat a small figure. A very familiar figure.
“Sayeda!” He bends down to her level and lets her hug him. “Is this your school?”
Esme shrugged, looking uncomfortable, though she retained a modicum of haughty restraint that irked him.
Pansy cleared her throat. “That’s something you’ll have to ask him.”
“That one, yeah.” Harry said, glancing over at Draco to see his reaction.
“I’m sure he won’t be once he realizes how worried you are.” The Professor could talk paint off a wall with that cajoling voice.
“I got your letter, you don’t have to again after all these years.”
Draco glanced over to see them cuddled on the floor and felt his heart warm. People could - and did- say what they wanted about Pansy Parkinson, but she was a fiercely loyal friend and excellent godmother.
“Did you know you were gay in school?” Potter asks, seemingly out of nowhere.
Pansy laughed and muttered something that sounded a lot like what one would call a person who made their living working with clay. Draco glared at her as he pulled away from his son. “Maybe, a long time ago.” He said, tweaking Scorpius on the nose. “When I was at Hogwarts. But that’s in the past and right now I think our dinner is starting to burn.”
Harry laughed. “I just hadn’t met the right wizard, I guess.”
“Ron!” She said sharply, though her tone was undercut with mirth. “You can’t meddle in Harry’s life like that!”
“I do, but Ron doesn’t - he was an auror for about three years but hated it. Now he works with George at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and looks after Hugo.”
“Thank you for once again corrupting my innocent child.” Draco sighed. “Scorpius, a smut show is a show for adults. A...romantic show.” He cringed as Pansy laughed.
When he arrived back he found her wearing her cloak and a very unhappy expression. “I thought that, given our mutual friend, I should at least stay to say goodbye.” She told him quietly.
Harry is about to ask for more details when Remus pushes the door open with one hip, seemingly unaware of Harry’s presence. He’s carrying a brown takeaway bag and whistling softly; there’s a joviality to him that Harry has never seen before and the look he gives Sirius is so fond it makes Harry’s chest tighten. It’s obvious, suddenly, that this is an old ritual - the second snifter, the music too low for anyone to hear.
Potter looks as though he’s about to respond, but their server reappears, setting fish and chips before Draco (he couldn’t resist ordering the muggle delicacy) and a sandwich in front of Potter. The server lingers, smiling brightly at Draco. She asks if he wants more tea, how he’s enjoying his day, and it occurs to him that she might in fact be flirting. A shame, given that his proclivities swing solidly in the opposite direction, but it buoys him a little nonetheless.
“Interesting”. Potter takes a large bite of his sandwich and Draco dearly hopes he’s not about to speak with his mouth full.
Sighing, Draco made his way to the bar and leaned against it beside the attractive wizard, though he didn’t dare make eye contact. He signaled the bartender and ordered refills. Then, taking a deep breath, he turned to the man beside him - who was no longer there. In the split second it took Draco to realize this, Harry Potter slid onto the now vacant stool. They locked eyes for a moment, Draco’s stomach doing a little flip that he did his best to ignore.
"Have you ever thought about what life would be like if the normal was magic and it was rare to be a muggle?" I questioned no one in particular, sliding into a sitting on the bed.
"What's your kink with the Slytherin dorms anyway? Potter has a Slytherin girlfriend, doesn't he?"
hurt the boy I fell for. I will be very glad to see his father behind bars as soon as this war is over and he can rot in there for all I care.
Does he ever shut the hell up?
"I'm supposed to be a heartless death eater under the complete control of Voldemort. You are supposed to be The Chosen One. The brave one who is supposed to solve all of the world's problems no matter what it is. We didn't get a say in this and yet it's expected of us. I can't imagine the pressure you must feel," Draco explained in a tight tone, glancing up to catch my confused gaze with vulnerable eyes reddened by tears still sliding slowly down his cheeks. "I will help you, Harry. No matter what, I want to see Voldemort's demise."
Mcgonagall stood up slowly with eyes alight with flames. "Mr. Malfoy, I think they understand your perspective. Please, calm down."
"You okay?" I murmured over the loud pounding of my heart in my ears.
"What are you doing in here anyway, Malfoy?" I questioned in an indifferent tone, using every muscle in my body to tear my gaze away from the decorated wall and towards the blonde still leaning back in the chair.
Thankfully, the snitch surged upwards and merely brushed his fingers. Draco and I were quick to follow, pulling the ends of our brooms up to follow the snitch higher into the sky. My arm was outstretched, fingers inches away from catching the golden ball if it would stop moving back and forth so randomly. Draco was only inches away, brows furrowed and bottom lip bitten between his teeth in the embodiment of concentration. Then, the snitch flew left and we followed as if we were playing follow the leader. Wherever the snitch decided to go, Draco and I followed very close behind. When it flew down, we dipped down like two rockets. When it surged left and flew high into the air, we followed right behind, almost falling off in the promise of the sharp turns. Still, Draco and I remained inches from the snitch just because it flew so goddamn fast. We'd have to leap off of our brooms to get it and I might do just that.
I was very much so surprised when Draco turned to give me a bright smile. My own special smile and I think I forgot how to breathe properly. His team was racing towards the ground and calling Draco down to celebrate their victory. They really should, considering one more will solidify their place in the championships more than likely against the Gryffindors. Well, if Voldemort let's us get that far into the year without fucking everything up. I've been so caught up in Draco, I've completely forgotten about the oncoming war. I really need to get my priorities straight even though Draco can be considered a big part of the war. I'm not sure what side he's on and if he's being forced to fight as a death eater, I'll have to fight against him and I can't possibly hurt him. I
"You have to believe me when I say I was forced. I didn't want to get the mark, but I just couldn't take anymore pain. He threatened to kill my friends, kill my parents and I just couldn't let him hurt anybody else. It was my fault I was put into that situation and I couldn't let anyone take the fa-"
I wasn't sure what he was going to say, but he sounded so small- so broken, I couldn't help myself. I launched myself forward and pulled the blonde into a tight hug. I wrapped my arms tight around his middle, knees on either side of his legs so that I was leaning over him, eyes clenched closed as I tried to push as much reassurance into this one embrace. Slowly, Draco began to unravel. His arms wrapped around my middle just as tightly, face tucked into the side of my neck as he finally let heart wrenching sobs bubble past my lips. They were small, quiet, and choppy, but they still managed to rip my heart to shreds each time. I could feel the wetness of tears coating my shoulder and yet, I couldn't bring myself to mind. I slid a hand up to play with the ends of his soft blonde locks as I murmured mindless nothings into the evening air.
“Am I what they had in mind?” Anthony asked, an uncharacteristically vulnerable look on his face.
And what had Draco done? Feeling that humiliation echo across years all the way back to the very first time Potter had rejected him, he’d stormed out of the bar like a child, destroying any chance of even friendship with the other man.
“It sounds like you're losing some sleep over it. Do you think - well, I don’t know your name. Where did you say you were calling from?”
Harry smiled softly. “She sounds like a smart woman.”
Harry swallowed and took a deep breath, trying to push down the rush of excitement that small movement had caused. “Yeah we broke things off in January.”
“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as she rejoined them carrying a second mug which she handed to Harry before sitting on the arm of the couch behind Ron.
“I heard you and Anthony split?” Draco asked nonchalantly, though his hand had come to rest, knuckles barely grazing Harry's, on the bar.
Draco returned his son to a frantic Pansy and had some quick words with the child about absconding from one’s caregiver and the politeness of not mentioning other potential love interests in front of one’s father’s current date. He would have liked a longer lecture, but didn't want to leave Esme alone for too long.
“Oh Harry.” Fran reaches for his hand. “I’m so sorry. I feel like we’ve lost touch with all the change over the past few months. I wish I’d known.”
“Friends with children who will take their fun where they can find it.” Hermione said, then her face softened. “We want you to be happy, Harry. If it’s with this mystery man, or Draco, or Ernie-”
“In the end we both wanted different things. I - might have done that thing where I decide something without taking into account how it will affect someone else.”
“I’ll go there now. You stay here in case he returns, I’ll send you a message once I know something.” Draco practically dove into the fire.
“Papa?” Scorpius’ voice was muffled against Draco’s shirt. “How did you know you liked wizards too? Did you ever like a wizard before you met mummy?”
“I’m afraid we’re one and the same, Scorpius.” Harry said.
“Well, I work for the Magical Youth Services division of the ministry. It was part of Kingsley's plan for his first year as minister. It’s shocking there really wasn’t anything like this already, given the amount of children orphaned by the first war, but I think that was due to the fact that most of them came from ancient families - like Neville - and they stepped in to take care of the child. No one ever really considered the muggleborn children who were orphaned and grew up with no knowledge of their abilities.”
“Yes, because of the war. Slytherin house was seen as evil for a very long time because some bad wizards came from the house. And a lot of students, including Slytherins themselves, believed that being in the house automatically made people bad. A lot of Slytherins also had parents who didn’t think that muggle born witches and wizards were equal to those from magical families.”
What he meant to do was review the patent briefs for a shielding cloak he and George had been working on - Harry ran the more serious wing of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, focusing on protective items and teaching self-defense classes, which had become quite popular even in the absence of the dark lord. While George’s eager brilliance had dimmed slightly in the wake of Fred’s death, his inventions were still stunningly good and Harry tried very hard to be a useful co-conspirator.
Ernest is almost everything Draco has ever wanted in a boyfriend - dapper, intelligent, funny. True, Draco has never imagined he would be with a Hufflepuff, yet here he is, dating a man who keeps his striped yellow tie and prefect’s badge framed in the study. Despite this, Ernest has changed since their years at Hogwarts, transmuting the swotty attitude of his teen years into a successful career as a barrister in magical Britain. Even Narcissa approves, given that Ernest is from a pureblood family; they don’t speak like that anymore, of course, but Draco can read her well enough. Lucius wouldn’t have approved either way, but death has robbed him of an opinion.
“We don’t ask why the universe took mummy away from us because there is no answer.”
“I suppose I’ve missed quite a bit.” Draco said regretfully. The Greengrasses had lived close to Cardiff for generations, which meant that Draco’s social circle was largely Welsh by extension during his marriage, and almost non-existent on that end following Astoria's death. He hadn’t kept up with anyone from Hogwarts but the Slytherins, and had made a special effort not to track Potter’s progress. He was frankly surprised that Pansy hadn’t mentioned either Potter or the youngest Weasley’s proclivities, given how much she loved gossip. He would have to ask her about it later. “It’s only a shame I missed the Hogwarts coming out party.”
“Oh.” She rolled her eyes. “Freddie is in Slytherin too. Everyone was all upset about it but then they realized they were just being babies.”
“It seemed like the right thing to do - you practically having a fit over the whole thing. I think that letter might be the first sincere thing you’ve said about what you want since you started dating that one.” Ron indicated Anthony with a jerk of his head. “I liked him as a person, yeah? But every time you mentioned your future you had this...resigned look about you. I knew you were being foolish and misunderstanding what Hermione was saying about relationships.”
“Can we put a bookmark in this conversation till after breakfast?” Draco said. “It’s nearly ready.”
Across the room, Harry flashed an uncomfortable grin.
Later, after Scorpius had gone to bed and the two of them were drinking an expensive port in front of the fireplace, Pansy circled back around to the topic. “You know, Scorp’s right. You are sad.”
This chapter mentions racism and homophobia, but not in detail.
For a moment, their eyes hold and Draco feels something, a small flutter of excitement. He dismisses it almost instantly, having learned early on in his gay career that falling for straight men is never a good idea. He can’t do anything about the fact that he has found Harry attractive since school, or that when Harry looks at him he occasionally feels as though he’s eaten a fizzing whizzbee.
“Potter, good to see you.” Ernest sounds pleased to be acknowledged by Harry Potter so publicly, though as they’re in muggle London no one around them even knows to be impressed by it. Draco does not turn around and begins fiddling with the handle of his briefcase, hoping that Potter will realise he is interrupting an intimate moment and move on.
“I knew it was you when you came in.” She said in a lilting French accent when he had made his way to their table. “Daphne described your hair perfectly.”
“No, I can just tell.”
Draco groaned inwardly - five pm on the first day of the new year was not his ideal setting for this conversation. Scorpius knew a very edited version of the story, one designed to educate without any of the more disturbing details. The full tale would come when he was old enough to understand it and the role his father had played.
Harry didn’t even have to consider it. “No.”
“Fancy a cup of tea?” Hermione asked suddenly, a slight pink tinge of embarrassment rising in her cheeks when he looked at her in shock. “Only I know how difficult it is, on the first day.”
“I’m nearly thirty-”
“Hello Pansy.” Harry said, grabbing the fur as it fell. “It’s lovely to see you.”
“And you became a healer.” Potter says, though it isn’t a question.
Potter shakes his head. “That’s a shame, ‘cause I like your mum. She sends me a card on my birthday, did you know?”
Harry had waited almost a month to see Teddy, so involved in the post-war clean up that he barely ate or slept. When he had finally arrived on Andromeda’s doorstep, their conversation had been clumsy and he was sure she hated him. Still, Harry persevered, showing up once a week to see Teddy no matter what was happening in his life. Slowly Andromeda’s hesitation changed to respect and then friendliness - she was in need of companionship as much as her grandson- the sudden empty space where the rest of her family had been was overwhelming at the best of times. She and Harry began to talk more, he would stay for tea after Teddy had been put down to nap or bring her a parcel of the fancy chocolate biscuits she favoured, a new book Hermione had recommended. Andromeda was smart and quick witted, and it didn’t take long for Harry to stop seeing Bellatrix in her features and start seeing Andy, who made a strong cuppa and told the most wicked stories about her days at Hogwarts: first girl on the Slytherin quidditch team in over a century, never quite making prefect due to her inability to keep her mouth shut when faced with something she did not like, quick with a hex if the situation called for one. The Weasleys began to go with Harry on some of his visits, a slow trickle of guests bringing food and baby clothes, toys and entertainment. Together they had created a patchwork family - they looked slightly odd from the outside but that didn’t matter to any of them.
Embarrassingly, Draco felt his eyes begin to well up as Scorpius looked back at him long enough to offer a brief smile and wave before turning around again.
“Budge off.” She said, pushing a particularly persistent casserole away from where it had been nudging her shoulder. “Who else would have cooked you this feast? Honestly, it was all I could do to convince her not to come over here. She means well but-”
“Papa?” Scorpius asked, tentatively tugging to see if he could pry his fingers out of Draco’s grip. He couldn’t. “Papa, can we go inside now?”
“What about your mum and dad?”
“When did you come out?”
Harry met Anthony’s eyes, and was surprised to see tears that mirrored his own threatening to well over. He raised a hand to cover the one that Anthony had against his cheek.
“Does he understand?” Harry asked, looking at the child as though he could confirm.
“Are you heading to work then?” Harry wordlessly summoned a fork from the kitchen and caught it deftly as it flew toward him.
Fall passed slowly into winter, and before Draco knew it, Yule was upon them. All the shops in the Phoenix District had colourful lights strung from their eaves and Scorpius’ primary school was festooned with non-denominational decorations (snowflakes, snow people - it seemed as though weather was the general, inoffensive theme). Every day, Scorpius came home with a different December tradition from around the world, among them popsicle stick reindeer, little plastic dreidels, a lantern he had decorated to celebrate Ligligan Parul Sampernandu, a drawing of the Gävle Goat, a hand-drawn guide on the different Jólasveinarnir one could expect to encounter, and a Krampus mask which he insisted on sleeping with under his pillow as an appeasement to the creature till Draco confiscated it.
“Who did that??” the man demands, springing to his feet and setting the roots dancing wildly about his chin.
The three of them turned to look at the bar where Anthony and his companion were leaning close, clearly having an intimate conversation. Harry watched for a moment, feeling regret and sadness but surprisingly very little jealousy. What had Anthony said? They both deserved to be happy?
could pass away in the upcoming war looming over our heads like a sword on a string.
"What about you?"
Ah, the howlers. How could I forget about something so important? Draco has been receiving a howler from his father almost every single day. At least, he's gotten more than I can count. Each time one drops onto his plate, his face goes pale and he stumbles as quickly as he can out of the Great Hall before it could open itself. None of the other Slytherins look up or seem the least bit surprised, but everyone else snickered and made fun of the blonde. Stuff like 'daddy isn't going to help you now' or 'damn, you really pissed daddy off now, haven't you?' Draco never acknowledges these insults, doesn't even come back after the howler opens in the hall just outside of the Great Hall doors. We can never make out the words, but we sure as hell can hear the loud, angry roar of Lucius Malfoy and I'm starting to see why Snape is more of a father to Draco rather than his real one.
The other tensed, atmosphere going thick as my question hung heavily in the air. I wouldn't have asked if I didn't need to know what was happening to be able to help. If they do so at home, I need to find excuses to keep Draco away from the manor. If it's happening here at Hogwarts, then I will murder them before they even lay a finger on Draco ever again. I know it has to be someone in those letters from his father. Wherever he goes during that time, whoever he sees, I'll break every single fucking bone in their body. I tightened my hold on Draco, pulling him impossibly closer until I knew he was safe and just to make sure he's actually still here. That this beautiful boy isn't just a cruel figment of my imagination.
"I said, let me see," I said once again as evenly as possible even if the sight made my heart well painfully in my chest.
The blonde let out a soft hum in response.
Draco's features immediately diminished into a blank stare. "As safe as anyone can be while under direct supervision of Voldemort and his number one henchmen. Don't worry about me, I've grown used to all they throw at me."
I thought the best place to hide from my problems was the Room of Requirements. The Room of Requirements can be anything and everything depending on what you imagine; anything you can ever dream of. Maybe I could turn the room into my dorm and take a nap away from the prying eyes of my friends or maybe into the lake and rest underneath the tree. Maybe I could imagine a cloud high in the sky, floating above all of my responsibilities thrusted upon me ever since I was a baby. I can sleep amongst the warm summer breeze on the soft fluff of a puffy white cloud. Yeah, the second option sounds better! The soothing sound of water lapping at the ground and the soft wind brushing against me sounds amazing right now.
to talk to Draco more than anything at this moment.
Then, he was gone without another word between either of us, the clock of the door resounding throughout the silent room.
I sucked in a deep breath and a weight instantly slipped from my shoulders because I no longer needed to worry about what side Draco was fighting on. He's on our side and I know that he will try his hardest to end this war with as much enthusiasm as he uses in potions. He's going to be the perfect mole on the inside and if Snape is also caring for Drsco, I would suspect that he's also not one hundred percent agreeing with the Dark Lord. Maybe we have a greater footing than I thought in the first place. Things are looking slightly more bright at that moment because with Draco, we also have the rest of the Syltherins who will follow his lead. We will know all of their plans and have a counter attack planned before they even know what's coming with the help of Draco. More importantly, I don't have to worry about hurting the blonde if we did face each other in the field. Not to mention I'm going to enjoy killing the man who murdered my parents
Hell, I've never thought of it before now, but one time Draco got a howler, he was absent- missing from the entire school for two days. He came back on a Thursday, skin even more deathly looking than before, eyes blank and unfocused as he plopped heavily into his seat in potions. He looked as if he hadn't slept a day in his life and just barely made it out of bed this morning to dress messily in his robes and forget to comb his hair. The most intriguing thing was the bruise gracing his nose and spreading to the apples of his cheeks, lip split and swollen a bright red from irritation. The sleeve of his robes fell away to expose bruises running up his arms and he practically limped into the room while putting most of his weight into Zambini beside him. Then, Snape slipped a vial of something out of the sleeve of his robes and Draco instantly downed it in one gulp. The bruises slowly began to fade to nothing throughout the entire class and it was like I had been the one seeing things.
That is until the quaffle was flung in our direction. My eyes widened because wherever the quaffle goes, so does the hoard of other players. I glanced over and definitely wasn't surprised to see a crowd of players on brooms all rushing towards us with reckless abandon. They were drawing closer and closer even though Draco doesn't seem worried in the slightest. He kept zooming by and yet, the mass of people and the wall behind us would shield us from view. A wall with a hole large enough to fit through from the bludger incident earlier in this match. Draco is
"I need to know, Draco-" I cut myself off with an uncertain breath.
I know I can never hurt him, so if he was against me in the war, we're all screwed. I pray for us that Draco can finally leave his father's orders and do as he pleases. I know what it's like to live under constant directions, not being able to control your own life, and that's the most terrible and suffocating feeling I've ever experienced. I wouldn't be surprised if he's following orders directly from Voldemort considering how close his father is to the monster. Maybe he was forced to become a death eater if he is one that is. I don't think many people are willing to become a death eater in the first place.
"We need to make sure he's okay," I murmured more to myself than to my friends in front of me. "To protect him."
One Slytherin catcher and one Gryffindor catcher were flying neck and neck towards the Slytherin hoops. I couldn't see exactly what was happening considering they were facing away, but I could tell the Gryffindor had the quaffle and was racing as fast as they could towards the hoop. The Slytherin was ramming into their side and making their path jagged, and yet, the Gryffindor was holding strong. A beater from both teams was hitting the second bludger back and forth, trying to knock one of the catchers out of the air. It was a play even I had to fly a little higher and watch just from how nail biting it was. The Slytherin girl used the tip of her broom to hit at the Gryffindor male's leg hard enough for him to yelp and clutch his leg. The girl took her opportunity to slam into his side and cause him to veer, dropping the quaffle. The girl easily dipped and caught it, turning to race towards the Gryffindor hoops. The crowd was eating this up as loud cheers and boos filled the air, encouraging the girl to race towards me with eyes solely focused on me. The male was close on her heels, racing after her with flying bludgers in toe and one blonde seeker looking to see more of the action.
"Me leave? I was here first, Potter!"
Harry. Why were we forced to mold into these lives?"
Hope filled my chest like a breath of fresh air. "A bet?"
We were in the safety of the shadows and I doubt people noticed our fall because of the loud cheers and shouts pouring in from above us. They probably think Draco and I chased the snitch into the stands when in reality the blonde is straddling my waist with his face hidden into my shoulder. Yet, I couldn't make myself complain about it like I would have if Draco even poked my shoulder a year ago. It wasn't like he was heavy or anything because it was the exact opposite actually. Draco is frighteningly light and his heart is beating so fasting against my chest, I'm slightly scared he might have a heart attack.
Draco reached for a green apple, but stopped short upon noticing the unnatural silence throughout the Great Hall. He glanced up, blank features slowly morphing into anger as he noticed all of the attention on him and the other Slytherins. "If you don't fucking mind, I would like to eat my meal in peace. Thank you," He spat in a tone that resounded throughout the quiet hall and sounded more tired rather than the furious draw he looked to be hoping for.
I couldn't help myself when I leaned forward and pressed a long kiss on his cheek. I stayed there for only just long enough for it to register in both of our minds. His skin was soft against my slightly chapped lips and I could smell the musty scent of the library mingled with expensive cologne flowing off of Draco ever so slightly. I could hear the other's breath hitch and instead of pulling out of my weak hold, he sagged into me just as exhausted with this day. I pulled away after what felt like hundreds of years, eyes focused on our feet between us as a flush rushed up my cheeks. God, he's going to hex me, isn't he?
"I should ask you the same thing," Draco spat back with a little more bite than normal.
"I don't want to hear your voice right now," Draco spat as he delicately put the book away and clenched his right hand into a fist at his side.
Draco's jaw clenched, but the Veritaserum pushed the words out for him rather quickly with such a large dose. "No," he murmured, almost too soft for me to be able to hear, gaze focused on his wringing hands in his lap.
"You would be pure blood then."
"I just wanted to talk to you, but you were making it extremely hard," I pressed a little annoyed with the blonde because if you think about it, we are in this position because he forced my hand.
I snorted, rolling my eyes in amusement. Only Draco would make a bet about letting him win. I unraveled my cloak and spread it out as much as I could underneath the bent tree above us. Its thick leaves loomed over us like the claws on a gnarled hand, casting shuttering shadows on the lake in front of us. I sat on the cloak, legs outstretched in front of me as I leaned back against the rough bark. It's nice to sit here in the peace of the night and listen to the quiet noise of lazily lapping waves and the crickets far away in the forest behind us. It's nice to share this moment of serenity with someone I hold very close to my heart. I just wish it could be under normal circumstances. A school romance between two normal people who can cuddle up together for warmth under a tree without worrying of their imminent demise crawling closer and closer with each passing day. I wish I could pass stupid notes to him just to make him smile and sit with him at lunch without being judged by choosing a different house. I wish I could run my fingers through his hair to ease the stress evident in his stiff body as he sat in front of me, legs crossed underneath of him and hands clasped neatly in his lap.
"Voldemort will be there, won't he?"
Draco snorted, head turning towards me just to let me know he was listening, but not fully enough to look at me. "You aren't worth my time, Potter. I have business to take care of," he grumbled underneath his breath and before I knew it, he was making his way towards the door. "Have fun in my room, fucking pervert."
I didn't believe it for a second, but decided against pushing as all fell silent. I watched his book slowly fall from his face to rest gently in his lap, slim pale fingers cradling the cover delicately as if that book was the most precious thing to him. Draco's brows were furrowed ever so slightly, eyes darting across each page as he read more quickly than I can even speak. It was weird to see all the pride drip from his features as he let loose and relaxed into the vivid words of his story. That insufferable smirk was exchanged for a slight frown of concentration, but besides that his breathing was slow and languid and he sat in a position that made him a lot smaller. His shoulders were hunched forward, right leg folded over his left to prop his book up and give a better angle for reading.
I was too stuck in my own head to get embarrassed. Too enraptured by the very new sight in front of me to care about being caught. What if's began to invade my thoughts of Voldemort until I wasn't even worried about being The Boy Who Lived. I was stripped of my titles and left to be a boy with a terrible and unabashed crush. A crush I should never have because the person doesn't feel the same way. I felt like a muggle watching their crush from across the lunchroom, wondering if I could slip a note in his bag during math class. Not wondering if I could tell him my true feelings before I die in the inevitable war. Before
"I've been trained to use Occlumency to resist Veritaserum and I didn't want to be tempted to. A bet is a bet and you won fairly."
"Maybe this is a cry for help in Malfoy language. Him saying the Slytherins are in need of some support? They have no one to run to," Hermione pondered, completely ignoring Ron to lock eyes with me. Worry glowed brightly in her toffee eyes.
I nodded thoughtfully in response. "I'll find out."
"God, a snobby pure blooded Slytherin," I teased lightly through a tone of mock disgust.
"Draco, please, are you a death eater?" I muttered hesitantly, not really knowing if I wanted to know the answer or not.
Something about Draco Malfoy alone didn't sit well with the other students. They hated him with a whole new passion.
close, I have to try now or I may never get another chance! I grabbed the end of Draco's broom and yanked him as hard as I could towards the wall once the mass of players surrounded us. Draco gasped, not expecting the sudden harsh turn and was simultaneously thrown off balance. His broom shot up into the air and I dipped mine downwards, flying back sideways into the hole. Though, the sudden rough turn made Draco's grip slip and before I could blink, he was falling down towards me. I did the only thing I could to protect him. I caught him and was pushed into the top part of the hole.
"How and why do they hurt you?"
"Yeah, this year with all of those howlers, must be getting to him because he hasn't made a move to insult us since the train," Ron added thoughtfully, but he didn't seem to mind either way because he was back to stuffing his face with mashed potatoes once again.
"I do remember that one time Draco and I were paired for a project. I thought he was going to be a complete git, but once we were alone in the library, he became one of my favorite people to talk about books with," Hermione admitted in a saddened tone, pushing the lettuce around on her plate absentmindedly.
Absolutely no one. Look at professor Snape, you hate his guts and all he is a man tortured by lost love. Zanbini comes from a broken family and could barely make it from meal to meal before he was taken into the Malfoy Manor over the summer. Being a Slytherin means you fight to survive and people forget our house means we won't stop until our goals are accomplished rather than coldblooded killers."
see fit, but thank you for your concern," Snape drawled out in an even tone that reeked of a final bite for the Slytherins, not even bothering to turn back towards said professor. Then, the end of his black robes licked at his heels as he exited the Great Hall in the usual Dnap flourish.
I practically ran down the hallway leading to the Room of Requirements, robes flapping against my heels the only sound in this entire wing. For the first time in what feels like forever, a mixture of happiness and hope was rushing through my veins like surging wildfire. The room would remain hidden until I opened it, so I was slightly surprised to see the wooden door already visible on the brick wall. I guess somebody must have just left and the room is still clearing itself of the last person's wishes before it hides away once again. I made sure to clear my mind before imagining the lake as hard as I possibly could as I paced in front of the door exactly three times. It's the only way to open this door rather than an entitled painting who you need to whisper a password to. Oh, sitting at the lake with Draco's head in my lap, running my fingers through his hair as he read from one of those big, dusty tomes he always has in his bag. I could feel myself growing lighter and lighter at the thought until an ear splitting grin quirked at the edges of my lips. He may even read it outloud, but I would surely grow bored of the contents and end up being teased by Draco for not understanding. It'll probably be a book about advanced potions or magic history nobody but him, Hermonie, and the teachers know about. He may be a git, but he is a very smart git.
"He's in my house, Minerva. I'll punish him how
With that, we both caught sight of the snitch as it zipped past his head. We both simultaneously glanced towards each other, our eyes meeting for only a fleeting moment. His in a silent challenge and mine pleading. Then, he was zooming off in the direction the snitch went as the crowd cheered in encouragement. I was left to trail after him like a fucking puppy as we weaved around the actual game in the middle of the field. We raced in a single file line around the edge of the field, the snitch still a few feet in front of Draco's outstretched arm. At this point, I'm not concerned with winning considering we still have a great chance of making it to the championship even if this game goes to the opposing team. I
"Malfoy, please-"
The last sentence caused the other to laugh slightly, shoulders shaking from either the tears or self-deprecation- I'm not sure. I took it as a sign he liked the little nickname because he didn't pull away and punch me square in the jaw. He dug his fingers into the back of my t-shirt and clung onto me like his life depended on it. I didn't mind because it gave me the excuse to nuzzle my nose into his soft hair and rub absentminded shapes on his lower back. His hair smelled oddly of green apples, but I didn't question that fact because I know he really likes them. Slowly, his body began to relax as much as it possibly could in a situation like this. His cries slowly morphed into little sniffles and trembling turned into shivers from the cool night air. Yet, he didn't pull away from my neck, nor did his arms loosen around me.
I started to lean a little farther, to push a little harder to squeeze in beside Draco and the wall to the stands. I need to gently bump him out of the way of the snitch just to keep the game going long enough to get him to meet me somewhere. Though, every time I bump his broom, he merely accommodates the hit by swerving outwards and pushing himself ahead with the force. It is a remarkable move not many people can pull off, but I've seen Draco outside many days until nightfall, no matter the weather, trying to catch the snitch. Sometimes he plays with others or he will sit in the pouring rain for hours, waiting for the snitch to show up and catch it without competition. I feel like flying to him is much like how flying is to me. It's a freeing experience being hundreds of feet off the ground, the wind ruffling through your hair and the stars within reach. I personally love flying so fast you can hardly stay on your broom because of the wind and apparently Draco does too because he's easily picking up speed towards the snitch, a speed that made his hair flutter haphazardly into his eyes which sparkled dangerously under the hot sun.
Draco seemed very satisfied with my answer because he nodded as best he could with his head pressed back into the wall. "As you should," Draco replied with a small grin, eyes alight with something akin to relief. "I would say the first person that desperately needs to be saved from Voldemort's clutches is Zambini. He can hardly stand-"

"Nervous, are we?" I pipped up in a teasing tone about two feet from where Draco was passing.
Draco merely laughed humorlessly, flopping back into the deep chair behind him as if he knew exactly where it would be. I guess we both didn't want to go back to the world outside of the Requirements's doors. As long as we stay behind these walls, reality can bend at our will to recreate anything we could possibly imagine. Time seems suspended within these walls, like we've fallen into our own little wormhole, even though we both knew the world still rages on beyond the finely kept birch wood. It won't stop me from pretending I'm just a normal wizard who has no responsibilities besides passing my O.W.L.S and who I'm going to take to the Yule Ball. Maybe I can pretend I am merely a side character, peering in from the outskirts as the hero of the story saves the day and leaves me to cheer him along without any worries in the entire world.
A war I had no idea where Draco stood in.
Draco, one for not being a minute late, was standing next to one lone tree, pacing nervously it would seem. His platinum blonde hair caught the thousands of stars and made it glitter just like it made him seem to glow. He looked absolutely ethereal, pulled directly from a book of fantasies simply worrying his lip between his teeth. He had left his robes behind for a simple green sweater a size too big and dark slacks that complimented his slim waist nicely. The sleeves of his sweater were pulled down over his hands, wringing each other in front of his chest in obvious signs of fear. His long hair was shielding my view of his eyes even though I could bet my life on them being storming- clouded over with hundreds of thoughts zooming through that beautiful mind of his. His shiny black shoes crunched the green grass below loud enough to stir the inhabitants in the lake, but he didn't seem to notice. He was tall and slim with finely crafted features like sharp cheekbones and a narrow jawline. He is more on the lean side considering I've never seen him throw a punch let alone lift something without using magic even though that's normal for pure bloods.
I sat up slowly, as if going to corner a startled deer. Draco kept his back to me with tense muscles and I could feel the silent seething he was doing even from comfortably perched on his bed. I slid over until my feet touched the fluffy rug, eyes never once leaving him because I was afraid he might disappear like sand if I glanced away for even a second. I can't fully believe Draco spat so much on his mind to me of all people, but I suppose you reach a boiling point and explode every once in a while. I feel as if Draco isn't one for sharing, so I suspect he hasn't talked about his feelings in a very long time. I know I've only hit the tip of the iceberg and I know I won't see much more once Draco sews his seams shut once again. I know he'll run away as soon as one of these floorboards creak under my feet. I may never speak to him again after this embarrassing situation.
“Watch me do the spells.” He told his son. “Follow my wand movements.”
Hermione’s face grew serious. “I heard about Astoria, Draco. I'm so sorry.”
“No.” Anthony said quietly. “I would have thought you might ask me if I wanted a child around for a month during the summer, given that we practically live together.”
“We - it was very difficult, losing my wife. But I think we’re doing okay, my son and I. Aren’t we doing okay?” this question was clearly directed at his son, but before the boy could answer the Professor spoke.
“Sorry I’m late.” He huffs, sitting down hard and turning to the server. “Could I taste the Benoit Courault cab franc from 2018?”
“Draco, there you are! I was beginning to think you’d taken my advice and actually found someone to shag tonight.”
“I am normal.” Draco said, feeling irritation prickle at his temples.
“As much as I enjoy the thought of you clumsily trying to dance around the question, Potter, I’m afraid I haven’t the patience today. Yes, I’m gay. Yes, I’m dating Ernest.”
“Don’t you like the one he has now?” Professor Mentis sounded like the kind of adult who shared secret, mocking looks with other adults over children's’ heads.
“Honestly Draco, you need to learn when to give up on a lost cause.” Pansy says loftily, and Draco knows he is about to get a lecture on her relationship with the man she dated before marrying Theo.
“Where did you and Anthony meet?” He asked, adjusting the robes around Harry’s shoulders.
Scorpius nodded solemnly, turning his attention back to Rose who had tugged on his sleeve to whisper something in his ear.
“You really had no idea something was wrong?”
He pinches her arm in retaliation - truthfully, Tiberius has not worked out the way he’d imagined. Endlessly grumpy and with a preference for shitting in Draco’s loafers, and his loafers alone, the kneazle’s affections lie solely with Ernest. Draco is really only considering partial custody because it feels like the right thing to do, seeing how he had been the one who wanted a pet in the first place.
“You did mail that letter!” Harry cried, turning to face the traitor.
“Destiny has ruled so much of my life, I can’t help but wonder - what if this wizard is meant to be my partner? What if I never meet him and he’s supposed to be in my life?” He took a shaky breath. “You know Anthony doesn’t want kids? Ever?”
“She came home, right-” the crowd cheers and Harry’s attention is momentarily diverted from his monologue. He squints unnecessarily at the pitch (they are in the private box with unobstructed views) but can’t quite make out what has happened. “- and she tells me she’s moving out. I’m there, cooking dinner
“How do you know that?” The child’s question was inquisitive, not defensive as Harry would have suspected.
Remus raises his eyebrows at the mostly untouched snifter of mead in front of Harry, but his voice is gentle as he takes a seat. “You’re right, she would have.”
“Well, Sleepless in Shoreditch, do you think there could ever be someone else for you?”
“Yeah. Grimmauld is huge and we have all those extra rooms. Andy can’t manage her house anymore, or keep up with Teddy most days.”
Draco straightens his back and meets Potter’s eyes. “I apologise, Potter, for being an insufferable blood purist as well as the part I played in the Battle of Hogwarts. As I said in the letter, I’ve made a promise to myself to set my life on a path that not only passively causes no harm but actively contributes to helping others.”
“And you like my papa?” Scorpius demanded, all traces of fear forgotten in the face of this new information.
“Don’t you ever miss having house elves?” Pansy asked as they sat down at the table and Draco began to fill Scorpius’ plate.
Harry didn’t consciously watch Malfoy leave, but when he turned back to his friends Hermione had a curious look on her face.
“I can tell you’re a good father, your son must love you very much to reach out like this, but he is obviously worried for you.”
“Not drinking to excess.” Draco said.
“Because it’s better to detect a curse than try to reverse it.”
6:30pm: :0
“Yes, thanks Ron, hadn’t worked that out for myself.” Harry muttered, though there was no malice - Ron’s infamous ability to say the wrong thing had long ago stopped being a source of contention between them.
Harry closed his eyes, feeling grief pool in his chest for the child.
“He’s looking
“Best thing I’ve ever had a hand in.” Harry is watching them with over-bright eyes.
May 1st came altogether too quickly for Scorpius. Despite his extensive planning - well, Rosie’s extensive planning - he still did not feel prepared for his solo trip to Hogsmeade. He knew that he would be in very big trouble with his father, maybe even enough to be grounded (Draco had never, but Scorpius’ cousins frequently suffered this fate so he knew it was an option).
“James was furious that she had gotten herself injured and she tore a strip off him, told him that muggle or magical, she wasn’t about to live in a world where hatred was tolerated.”
Have some definitions, all yanked from Wikipedia.
“To be honest I don’t know him very well.” Harry admitted.
After a moment of frenzied contemplation, he found a quill and some parchment, sitting down at his cluttered desk to write.
“I know.” Pansy sighed. “I know. Eventually, though, you’ll start dating again. You’ll meet someone.”
“Honestly Harry?” Hermione said, taking a sip from her own bottle. “This might be the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”
Harry grinned, running a hand through his hair in a way that utterly destroyed its last vestiges of neatness. Draco felt heat creep up his neck and settle in his cheeks and opened his mouth to say something, anything, to get Harry to take a step closer.
But these aren’t
“I just have to get my bag from Rosie’s room!” Scorpius was off in a flash, leaving the two men alone.
Draco took his hand.
“I don’t think this is what people mean when they say to confront your childhood bullies.”
“Was Sayeda a client of yours? Or is that rude to ask?” Draco looks around to make sure none of her schoolmates can overhear.
“They’re from the radio show.” Scorpius said, reaching to open the nearest one.
Draco felt blindsided. In the years since he had seen Harry Potter the man had changed in ways that only accentuated Draco's attraction to him. He still had his trademark green eyes and messy hair (though it appeared to have been somewhat tamed for the occasion) but these days he was sporting a close-cropped beard and seemed to have learned how to dress himself, kitted out in deep green robes over a black button-up and slacks, a sprig of holly pinned to his lapel. The scar stood out on his forehead, a white fork of lightning that disrupted his light brown skin and part of one eyebrow. His smile was easy and bright, his stride confident as he walked into the room at the back of the group, catching Hermione when she tripped over the edge of the rug so that her stumble was barely noticeable.
“Don’t let him scare you.” Harry’s hand is suddenly on Draco’s shoulder, a comforting and confusing weight. “Their buñuelo kisra is the best thing I’ve ever eaten.”
“You haven’t been together that long, have you?” Potter produces a thermos from his bag and pours tea into the attached mug. He looks around, then pulls a muggle rubber out as well and discreetly transfigures it into another cup, filling it before he slides it across to Draco.
Scorpius wasn’t sure what to do, so he waited till the next day to consult Rosie; there was something about her that made Rosie seem like she always knew what to do. She was in possession of both keen intelligence and distinct oddness, two factors which made sense to most of the adults who knew the source of her genetic makeup. To other children, Rosie was a force of nature and none dared stand in her path.
Draco waits till the server has come and gone before forcing the words out into the silence as his friends sip their respective drinks.
Scorpius and Pansy got on surprisingly well; though Pansy was an avowed child hater, she always listened to Scorpius’ stories with an air of serious interest. She was also quite involved in the dramas of his primary classroom: in the month since beginning there Scorpius had amassed a surprising amount of stories about his classmates. Pansy listened to them all, from Rose Weasley-Granger’s latest antics to whether or not Maxine Strauss had been right in telling Scorpius she had a crush on him. (“Absolutely not, subtlety is key” was her most Slytherin of answers.) Pansy had also known the Greengrass sisters since their youth and could answer Scorpius’ questions about his mother. Draco listened with a mixture of pain and nostalgia as she talked; though it hurt to hear these memories, he couldn’t begrudge Scorpius the opportunity.
“Call me Molly dear. Come on inside, the rest of the family is waiting.” She said, pushing both men through the door toward the dining room. Though Harry had been sure there would just be a few Weasleys to contend with, nearly the entire clan was assembled around a long table: Arthur at the head, Hermione and Ron with Rosie and Hugo, Ginny and Luna, Bill and Fleur, George and Angelina with Roxanne, Percy and Audrey with tiny little Molly the second. Charlie was still on assignment in Siberia, and the rest of the children were at school, but Anthony would meet them over Christmas after he had introduced Harry to his family at their Hanukkah celebration.
“I think they’re busy trying to convince Rose and Scorpius to go to bed at the moment” Harry grinned. “I just came from there, actually, stopped by for dinner and got suckered into playing dragons with the two little sods afterward. Scorpius told me I do the best roar he’s ever heard, by the way.”
“I’ll floo you back to Aunt Pansy’s and tuck you in to bed, alright?” He asked
“Maybe you’re just scared.” Hermione suggested. “This is a big step, getting engaged to Tony and meeting his family. You’ve never had the luxury of planning for the future, but now that the war is over there are endless possibilities - do you think maybe you’re a bit unsure about what to do?”
“Oooh.” Pansy eagerly grabbed a letter, breaking the seal and unfurling the parchment to read. “Dear Sleepless in Shoreditch - really, Draco? - You are the most attractive wizard I’ve ever laid ears on.”
Draco was not prepared for the joy that blossomed on his son’s face. “You’re the man who makes brownies?” Scorpius wiggled free from Draco’s arms and put his hands on his hips to assess Harry properly.
Draco raised his glass in a toast of acknowledgement. “Fair enough. If I'm being honest, Astoria always told me I was the most dramatic man she had ever met.”
“What’s the matter with you?” Draco asked, reaching up to run a hand through his own hair in frustration before he thought better of it.
“I know, the first time I came to the Burrow I felt the same way.” Harry told him.
“One of her many talents” Harry glanced over at Draco and their eyes met. For a second, Harry wondered if he was going to abandon his faculties and throw himself at Draco Malfoy unbidden. It certainly felt like a distinct possibility - the grey eyes across from him were familiar in a way that had nothing to do with their shared past. Harry could see hesitation and something close to hope in that stare.
“Scorpius?” He called out, and both parents instinctively recognized the panic in his voice.
"Detention, Mr. Malfoy! Two weeks of detention! We do not alone such foul language no matter what house you're in."
"What do you mean?"
Of course, Draco could Stupify me easily when my mind wasn't below the clouds. I couldn't get myself to care in the slightest honestly. At least I would be alone in the room of Requirements like I wanted to be in the first place. Any other time I would have him on his ass in a few seconds flat or even as soon as I noticed the other when I walked in the room. Draco was smart, but he had a short temper when it came to me.
to know that Draco is safe and Hermione seems to think so as well considering she's been talking about that day in the Great Hall every waking moment. He can be our spy on the inside, to give us tips on Voldemort's doings that we desperately need right now.
"Like you said, my hero complex just wants to make sure everyone is safe. Especially the Slytherins who I've neglected to see may need help the most."
Before I could chase after him, a bludger flew inches from the tip of my broomstick. I swiftly leaned back, pulling my broom to a stop and staring back wide eyed towards the Slytherin beater. He looked overly smug to almost have hit me, but to be fair, my head was high in the clouds or I easily could have dodged. Thankfully, I didn't need to because George was quickly at my aid, hitting the bludger back towards the male with enough force to cause a loud smack to ring in my ears. I watched it rocket passed like a tiny missile and the Slytherin's eyes widened considerably as it grew closer and closer. He dived to the right just in time, but the bludger fell and took out the bottom of one of the columns as easily as slicing butter. The wood crumbled away to reveal a hollow middle and just now, just large enough for someone to go through very meticulously now that it exploded back out. You wouldn't believe how many times people have had to repair these wooden beams. You would think they would use metal or magic to reinforce it, but I guess it wouldn't receive that loud roar of excitement from the crowd. Still, George saved me from a long fall to my death, so I exclaimed my thanks with a large smile and nod as he dove to chase after the bludger once again. Before he left, he shot me a quick wink as if to say 'you're welcome.'
- he seemed much different. He didn't throw any sneers and didn't feel the need to make any insult as if he was being told to maintain a certain social standing. At first, I thought it was merely a ploy to get people to feel bad for him, but after Draco brought this into the light, I'm beginning to think none of the Slytherins this year want anything to do with the war. They are just like the rest of us, they want to finish school like every other student. To get away from their families with many more reasons than the normal teen.
Including anything potions related and making us all look bad because of our essays.
I don't know why I was so caught up in Draco's little bubble. It's weird to see the usually boastful boy close himself off from the world and mind his own business for once. His clothes are rumpled and his tie is barely tied around his neck where the collar of his shirt underneath is oddly folded and in disarray. His usually well kept hair was in a tangled mess which was odd coming from someone who thought appearances were just as important as personality. I don't think I've seen Draco talk much this year let alone start any fights with my friends and I or anyone else for that matter. He fades into the background until his social rank is questioned by the other Slytherins.
"You wish," I exclaimed with a little smirk, just as I pushed a little harder forward and leapt forward towards the snitch. One hand remained firmly planted on my broom because that would be about a hundred foot drop onto nothing but grass.
"I don't know why you wanted to relax in my room though. It is quite cozy, isn't it?"
No sense in delaying this any longer with him staring right back, eyes filled with all of his hidden vulnerabilities. "When you go home for the summer, will you be safe?" I started with the number one question I couldn't get out of my mind since the Room of Requirements.
Draco struggled, I could faintly hear the grunt he let out to try and hold the words back from the Veritaserum. "Lord Voldemort has given me a very important task. One I can't possibly do and both him and my father are growing tired. My father sends me those howlers to tell me my time is running out and each time, I apparte home and he uses-" Draco coughed loudly, almost disgusted in himself. "God, Harry, I can't do this anymore!" He took in a sharp breath, finally caving under the truth serum and maybe even all of the pain keeping their secrets to himself brought.. His cane. "He uses his fucking cane and Voldemort likes to use Curcio on me just to show I'm at his complete mercy. I'm so
I took a swift step forward, eyes wide. "Why a heavy dose? You know that's extremely dangerous, right?"
"Having trouble, Potter?" Malfoy asked teasingly over the loud sound of wind in my ears.
"Oh, so you're begging now? How kind of you to find my words so enticing?"
Slytherins always give it their all no matter what and Draco's outburst isn't going to deter that. They watched Madam Hooch shimy the key into the lock holding all three types of balls with narrowed eyes and tight holds on their brooms. Everyone was in a circle in the middle of the large grassy field in the middle of circular stands hundreds of feet tall with multiple levels of stands littered with students. The houses in the match today had banners that were placed on the columns holding up the stands and wiping silently in the wind. Three identical poles with hoops were stationed at the end of each side much like a combination of American football and football. The bludgers flew into the air quickly enough to make my eyes widen even if I've seen it done multiple times. My eyes instantly caught the golden snitch glittering like a jewel under the bright sunlight as it flew into the air right in the middle of the circle, as if teasing us for not being able to grab it. I watched it soar high into the clear blue sky, too high for me to be able to see.
I can not tell you how much it hurts to be rejected so blatantly. My heart was stabbed in my chest with a burning spike and I sucked in a deep breath to ease the lump forming deep in my throat. My grip loosened on his slim wrists, brows furrowing as if I had been physically hurt and I just might have been with that thoughtless smirk on his lips. Draco easily pulled his hands out of my grip and rubbed at his wrists in front of his stomach, challenging eyes never once leaving my own even as he stepped out of my personal space. I watched him slide against the wall before waiting for an answer next to me without a care in the world. Not like he just crushed my feelings under his boot clad feet with a pretty little smile. Does he want me to win? Does he not realize what I meant by the kiss?
"What have we done to deserve such horrid treatment? Absolutely nothing, but wear green and it wouldn't matter how we acted. You would still hate us just because our house was also the house of Tom Riddle even if we were the sweetest people on the face of the Earth. But we aren't aren't because we would have been chewed up and spit out the second we stepped through those doors- pushovers," Draco explained with furrowed brows and all anybody could do is sit and watch with wide eyes. "We grew up differently, live differently, have different values, but we all bleed red. Everyone makes mistakes and you all act like you're sitting on a pedestal next to fucking Merlin himself. You act like you haven't done anything wrong in your entire lives."
I was partially surprised to see Draco watching the game rather than looking for the snitch. He usually doesn't pay much mind until the snitch is in between his pale fingers. Here he was zooming just ahead of the commotion, a little lower than me to be able to get a better view. A grand smile graced his features for the first time in as long as I remember, eyes sparkling like fallen stars and I was even surprised to see a little dimple forming on his right cheek. He looked so carefree with wrinkles forming beside his eyes in his mirth and occasionally shouted encouragement for his teammate. I wished Draco would look more like that, beautiful smiles and hope glittering in his grey eyes. I could even feel my own identical smirk pull on the edges of my lips, something light filling my heart for the first time in a long time.
Today wasn't much different than how it has been all week. Dinner began about twenty minutes ago and the Great Hall is alive with excited chatter and laughter just like it is every night. Everyone is excited for the quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor tomorrow after lunch. They are letting the Slytherins know who they are rooting for by nasty words thrown in their direction and disgusted glares that would make even me sick to my stomach. Yet, the Slytherins look completely used to this terrible treatment because they haven't even bated an eye. They are all eating their dinner as silently as possible, no one talking or even looking relatively excited for their game tomorrow. They were picking at their food rather than eating, grim expressions on their features surrounded by a room filled with laughter and light. The walls were sparkling with candle light, catching off of the yellow on the Hufflepuffs yellow robes and making their plates glitter like hundreds of stars. I was even surprised to see them murmuring harsh words about the Slytherins to their friends who snickered with affirming nods.
Well, I'm not
That really made Draco's blood boil over. He sprang up to match Mcgonagall's height and now his furious eyes turned from us to the teacher instead. Everyone held their breath because no one had dared to say anything bad to Mcgonagall no matter what or if she was obviously wrong. The world may even explode by her hand with that challenging look on her wrinkled features. The other teacher's looked just as surprised by Draco's outburst because they also seemed too shocked to move and stop the encounter before it happens. Snape seemed to be the most conscious one because he had his palms pressed firmly on the table in front of him, ready to jump in and stop the argument when it got too much. For now, he seemed satisfied with having someone finally speak out about the real issues surrounding the stigma of Slytherin.
"Well damn…" Ron murmured just loud enough for me to hear on the other side of the table.
The wind was knocked from my lungs and my grip tightened around Draco's middle, eyes clenched closed as we skidded to a stop a few feet from the opposite wall. My eyes had clenched closed and I wasn't surprised to find I was holding Draco tight enough to my chest to bruise. His head was tucked into my shoulder to shield his face from the impact, knees on either side of my hips, and hands clutching onto sides like his life depended on it. It wasn't a very far fall, but I would definitely feel it tomorrow. My clothes had been ripped from the wood and I could see a few bleeding cuts underneath, but nothing serious. I would be more sore than anything.
"Me?"
"Practicing spells." Came his short and quiet reply.
"Perhaps my first fuck off was too kind," Draco suddenly said without even glancing over as if he already knew I would approach him at some point. "I don't want to talk to you, Potter."
Then, that smile morphed into one of shock and Draco was nose diving downwards. My brows flew into my hair, wide eyes trying to see just what the hell he was doing when merely seconds ago he was excitedly watching his team. Though, I saw exactly why when a bludger flew back towards Fred who was smiling from ear to ear even if the Slytherins were cheering loud enough to rattle my bones. The girl had managed to fling the quaffle through the middle hoop just as Fred launched a bludger directly towards her. She was too distracted by making the goal, she didn't notice until she was being knocked off her broom. A scream filled the air and the game momentarily halted in horror, even Fred had looked shocked himself by the girl falling faster and faster towards the ground. Usually, you swing around on their broom or get knocked in a different direction, not completely taken off of your broom. Her broom was a few inches below her and the ground not far after, Draco was racing towards her as quickly as he could, but I'm not sure he can go any longer without losing the ability to pull up, himself.
"Take a picture, why don't you?" Draco spat without the usual venom, glancing up and catching my wandering eyes for just a second.
“Come help me put dinner together, Scorpo, and when he returns we’ll ambush him together.” Pansy said, holding out a hand. Reluctantly, Scorpius returned to the kitchen and helped her unpack the paper bag. Much like their home, it was more spacious inside than out and they managed to pull bottles of butterbeer and a full meal from Creevy’s (the prophet called it “worth the wait in line” and “wizard comfort food”) from its depths.
Harry’s surprised expression was a secret delight to Draco. “It’s Anthony - I’ve always known I wanted them.”
“Oh did he?” Again, the searching look. “Well, send us a message and we’ll arrange something.” She puts her arm around Sayeda, who has begun to lean against her. “This one has crammed herself full of candy floss, and I’m afraid that if we don’t get some real food into her soon she’ll crash from all the sugar. Lovely meeting you, Draco.”
The child beside her who was evidently named Rosie looked up. “Mummy, who’s this man?”
“The wards haven’t been tripped.” Draco said, running a frantic hand through his hair.
“I-I-” Scorpius tried and failed to explain, so overcome at seeing someone he recognised that it was all he could do to cling to Harry and sob. Harry scooped him up into a hug.
“You are not my favourite Malfoy any longer Draco. And Scorp loves Bitsy, don’t you?”
“Do you live in the area?” Hermione asked when they had both settled into their seats.
“Papa!” Scorpius cried, nearly falling off the stool in his effort to follow. “Wait I have questions!” But Draco was already out of sight.
“I care.” She said, unable to meet his eyes. “Like I said, Draco, I wanted to date a normal wizard.”
“Mummy?” Rose said, getting up from her seat at the table.
“I don’t mind.” Draco said, and it was true - somewhere during Harry’s explanation he had sat down on the seat beside him and apparently started in on Pansy’s cocktail.
“Are you okay, Aunt Pansy?” Scorpius asked - Pansy looked over to see him watching her intently. She forced her face into a neutral expression.
It was during one of these coffee dates that he learned that Harry was engaged to Anthony Goldstein - an announcement which caught him entirely by surprise.
Draco and Esme had been dating casually for about a month when Valentine’s day came around. Draco had never been a fan of the holiday, he found it altogether too fussy and had really only gone along for Astoria’s sake till she had told him she didn’t much care of it either.
Scorpius nodded solemnly, an expression on his face that seemed far too old for such a small child. Harry wondered where he had gotten the idea that he needed to defend Malfoy’s parenting skills, and whether the Greengrasses had anything to do with it. It didn’t seem worth pressing the issue, though, because Scorpius had rapidly moved on to another topic. Harry listened as he recounted his recent trip to a Quidditch match, and discovered that they shared a favourite team. Eventually George and then Ron joined in on the conversation, which culminated in Molly digging out one of Ginny’s old team robes and shrinking it down to fit Scorpius. Harry wondered briefly what Malfoy would say when his son returned home in a green robe with Wingtips Weasley emblazoned over the shoulders and the Harpies’ logo beneath.
Hermione scrutinised the parchment, unaware that its writer had focused a near replica of her expression it only a day before.“It’s a reply to the one you wrote that man from the wireless, isn’t it?”
“Oh come on Harry, you can find other men attractive.” Hermione said teasingly.
Scorpius was supposed to be with Pansy, and this arrangement worked itself out till roughly halfway through dinner. Just as Esme was opening the chocolates, the floo flared, admitting a thoroughly disgruntled six year old.
Draco sighed and crossed the distance between him and his son, scooping the child up. “Remember our discussion? You can stay up till midnight when you are ten.”
(“No one wants to kill us anymore, Draco, they just want to forget us.”)
Harry could picture Professor Mentis leaning forward as he sensed a human interest story that could be milked for publicity. He was almost ready to change the station back to Celestina Warbeck when the small voice said “My Yule wish is for my papa to find a new love.”
They were the first to go through, stepping out into Hermione and Ron’s living room. As they entered Harry made a thoroughly juvenile joke about floo rhyming with poo that sent Scorpius into peals of laughter, and they were both so caught up in their merriment that they did not notice Draco sitting on the couch.
Potter shrugs. “Just making conversation. Where are you headed?”
“Oh! Do you not care the gender of your partner?” Scorpius asked, suddenly very alert.
“It was long overdue, to be honest.” Draco says and then, surprising himself “how are you managing?”
“He likes jam, Papa. Strawberry jam just like mummy.” Scoripus announced for what had to be the fourth time that hour as Draco spooned peas onto his plate.
Draco’s cheeks pinked slightly at this and Harry could see him bite back a smile of genuine happiness.”I never would have imagined Hermione and I being friends and yet somehow she has become one of my best.”
“I didn’t - how long have you been - sorry, that’s rude." He scrubbed a hand through his hair in a way that definitely did not make Draco want to replace it with his own. "I didn’t know you fancied blokes.”
Amani nods “The new place is fantastic, much closer to Yeda’s school and the ministry. I’m doing a project with them and Fran decided to take a sabbatical from the university to be a stay at home parent.”
“This is Professor Mentis and the Mind Healing Hour. Tonight we’ll be looking back on some of the year’s most beloved floos.”
“Only a few months, right?”
On the pitch, the seekers both spot the snitch at the same time and dive toward it - Colin Ashcomb, of the Bats, throws himself forward slightly, arm outstretched. Harry and Dean lean forward as well, along with the rest of the stadium, waiting breathlessly to see who will end the game. Ashcomb is lithe but strong, and Harry watches in fascination as his muscled thighs clench around the broom nestled firmly between them. Harry has been a big fan since Ashcomb began playing for the team, following the man’s career in newspaper articles where it often appears next to Ginny’s and, occasionally, his own. It’s no secret that part of his popularity hinges on the fact that he’s handsome, so Harry doesn’t feel it’s odd that he is appreciative of Ashcomb’s good looks.
“You have to admit, things were pretty dramatic for a minute there.” Harry said.
Draco can’t actually imagine his mother sending Potter birthday cards - Narcissa is not a sentimental woman by nature. “No she doesn’t.”
Once he had repeated the story in its entirety, Harry collapsed onto the couch, taking the lager Ron offered him with grim determination.
Luckily, Ron was in the living room having a beer on the sofa, though he did startle and grab his wand as Harry stepped through the fireplace.
“I’m glad you had so much fun” Draco said, giving Scorpius an extra squeeze - it had been strange and lonely in the house without him for so long.
Surprised at being drawn back into the conversation, Harry scrambled for an answer. “I never stayed up till midnight on New Years as a child.” He didn’t think explaining that he had frequently stayed up till midnight doing homework (or indeed, spying on Scorpius’ own father) would have the desired effect.
“Is Scorpius here tonight?” Weasley asked.
Perhaps it is due to alphabetization, or the fact that very few students have chosen to sit their N.E.W.T.s at such a late date, but on a hot day in early July Draco finds himself sitting his exams in the same Ministry classroom as Harry Potter.
“I’m considering sending him to Hogwarts early just to put an end to the argument.” Draco said.
“Scorpius?” Harry exclaimed, lifting his wand to cast light on the child as he rushed over to him. “What on earth are you doing here?”
“There are, but they aren’t so bad.” Harry told him. “If you get nervous you can stick with me, alright? Rosie’s grandma makes the best pumpkin pancakes you’ve ever had.” This was true, Molly’s grandchildren were obsessed with her pancakes from the youngest (Molly’s namesake) to the eldest (Teddy). Though the family gathering would be significantly smaller as most of the older children were at school and Andromeda was visiting a friend, it was still guaranteed to be chaotic. Harry figured it would probably be a bit overwhelming for an only child from a family of two.
Rose turned serious brown eyes on Draco. “You know my mummy from school?” She asked skeptically, as though she didn’t quite believe Hermione had acquaintances with whom Rose was not familiar.
“Only one way to find out!” Ron said, summoning his cloak so that it flew directly into the side of Harry’s head.
“Not as surprised as we were.” Draco kept his tone neutral, friendly. He had never liked Weasley and hadn’t been particularly interested in befriending him while at Hogwarts. That being said, the man must have hidden depths if he was married to Hermione, so Draco was willing to amend his previous judgement. His younger self would never have permitted this re-evaluation, but since Astoria’s death he had begun to allow himself all kinds of liberties and the perspective offered by fatherhood had shifted his opinions considerably.
“Maybe.” Said the man.
“You know, when I met Molly - of course it was at Hogwarts, in my sixth year and her fifth. One day I just saw her, really saw her, for the first time. I was walking down the corridor to potions and suddenly this book landed at my feet. I bent down to collect it and so did she, so I ended up holding her hands. You know, I couldn’t tell where mine ended and hers began.” Arthur laughed self-consciously. “It felt more like magic than anything I had learned so far in school.”
Harry’s laugh drowned out the second clip, but he sobered quickly when a voice he recognised came on.
The three of them filled plates and collected goblets of wine, then chose an unoccupied table from which they had a suitable view of the room. If Ron or Hermione noticed that Harry’s eyes followed the movements of a certain blonde head, neither commented on it. They chatted and ate till Hermione spotted a colleague from the ministry and practically dragged Ron over to meet him. Realizing he was now alone and thus approachable (it didn’t happen as often now, but he didn’t want to take any chances) Harry decided it was time he went looking for the loo.
“That’s not on.” Dean says, taking a healthy swig of firewhiskey and raising his hands in a cheer as Quigley, the Bats’ beater, manages to knock the Appleby Arrows’ chaser nearly off her broom with a well-timed bludger.
birthday cards.” Draco says indignantly.
1. My headcanon is that Ginny’s quidditch nickname is Wingtips Wealsey.
“Go.” She said. “He’s a child, they get upset. He’ll be over it when you get home and you’ll have a talk without any screaming. I’ll make sure he eats dinner. You’re going to be late if you don’t hurry.”
Harry can’t sleep, there’s a certain itch that gets under his skin sometimes, a refusal to quiet that has been with him since he can remember. Sometimes he can calm it by counting in his head, or trying to recall a particularly boring tidbit from History of Magic, but he often ends up lying in bed watching shadows move across the ceiling till morning.
“How long did Scorpius keep you talking?” Malfoy asked, not making any move to return to the party, so Harry leaned back against the wall.
“On the train?”
“Malf- Draco, wait-” Harry began, but the other man was already halfway across the bar.
Gävle Goat = The Gävle Goat (Swedish: Gävlebocken) is a traditional Christmas display erected annually at Slottstorget (Castle Square) in central Gävle, Sweden.
Draco understood immediately - he hadn’t dated anyone since Astoria’s death and the presence of a new person in his life was bound to be jarring for Scorpius no matter how much he had professed his longing for Draco to begin dating.
“In the end, Draco, you were a scared boy trying to keep his family alive, poisoned by hateful rhetoric which also happened to be the only thing you knew.” Hermione put a gentle hand on his arm. “I don’t hate you.”
“Rose, this is a very serious situation.” Hermione said, kind but firm. She turned back to Draco. “We could use his hair to track him, maybe, or his magical signature-”
“It’s not like that, Scorpius.” Draco said, trying to lessen the embarrassment of the situation.
that.).
Harry has never really listened to music that made him feel anything; it is almost never played at the Dursleys, aside from the carols Aunt Petunia puts on at Christmas, and no one at Hogwarts seems particularly devoted to it either. This might be the first song he has ever heard and enjoyed. The fact that it is with Sirius, that his mum loved this band, makes it all the more significant.
"Oh, maybe a boyfriend then? How adventurous of you, Scarhead? You know-"
"Protect Draco? I think he's made it this far without any help," Ron replied as if repulsed by the thought of lifting a finger for the blonde.
"In this world, you would be a halfblood."
"I'm not in the mood to deal with your salty ass, so you can just leave." I rolled my eyes and waved the other male away with a flick of my wrist.
"Are you safe?"
What the fuck did I win if it wasn't the game?
All of that laughter was immediately snuffed out as the large oak doors creaked open. Every single set of eyes from every table glanced to see who was coming in so late. Obviously, it was the one and only Draco Malfoy with wrinkled robes and panting breath as if he had run directly from the other side of the school. His hair was a mess on top of his head as if he had twisted his fingers through the platinum blonde locks, pulling at the roots hard enough to rip out pieces. His pale skin now resembled a corpse, cheeks sunken in and much more wobbly on his feet than he usually would be. Deep bags rested under his dull grey eyes as he turned towards the Slytherin table. The click of his black boots on the concrete floor was the only sound in the Great Hall as he made his way to his everyday seat; directly in the middle of the Slytherin table. Nobody seemed to breath as he plopped down in between Parkinson and Zabini, but the hatred and disgust was palpable throughout the hall. You could see the glares double in effort from the other students in other houses.
I've noticed that Draco has been sneaking out late at night and acting a little nervous if I might add. I'm starting to think that he's become a death eater and aiding Voldemort in some time of plan within the castle walls. God, I hope I'm wrong. He doesn't deserve that; no one does.
For a split second, I could see fear and hesitation sparkling in those well guarded eyes. The next he was standing and spinning away from me, busying himself with looking through his bookshelf. He probably already knew where every book was and has probably read through each enough times for the spines to weaken and the words to fade because of age. Hell, most of those books look years older than his father and maybe they were even written during the time of Dumbledore by the yellowing of the pages and odd font on the covers. Still, Draco took his time, fingers trailing over the covers before taking out a medium sized tomb with yellowing pages and a jade green cover. He looked satisfied with his choice by the slight smile that pulled on the very corners of his lips and the warmth just barely there in his grey eyes. He hid his face behind the dusty pages before I could read too much into him and flopped back into his chair as if it were second nature.
There was a desk of chipping oak wood filled with cluttered papers and books opposite the door, a full body mirror hung upon the dark green walls decorated with moving pictures of scenery and multiple different people I had no idea who they were. I suppose they must be idols of some sort considering none of them looked alike (not family) and yet they were well taken care of. There was only one four poster bed which was weird to see since there were supposed to be three others in one dorm room. I was surprised to see a makeshift bookcase made out of stacked crates and jammed full of multicolored books all of different sizes, but all worn down to the last seams. It was also odd to see Slytherin colors instead of a Gryffindor room as well considering members of other houses aren't allowed in other common rooms, so dorm rooms are definitely off the table. The blankets on the bed were dark green with silver and black borders with the large Slytherin snake directly in the middle and the same colors painted the walls with the pillows being white and the rug just beside the bed on the left side, a dark green. There was a wooden chest at the foot of the bed with what looks to be a blanket made of all four houses rather than just Syltherin as you would suspect. I think I was most surprised to see the boy of my obsession standing beside a comfortable looking black chair, looking confusedly around the room as if it changed right under his feet.
