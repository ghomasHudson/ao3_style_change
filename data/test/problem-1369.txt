Harry desperately sought out Asherath, willing to plead for help as Burke’s hand slipped between their bodies. The man sharply tugged at Harry’s flaccid penis and smiled against Harry’s bleeding bite mark when the boy whimpered. Harry could barely make out the shape of the dementor through his tears, but he tried to make eye contact.
As promised, Rodolphus did teach Harry two defense spells. Since the curse did not have a counter, Lestrange taught Harry a spell that would help alleviate pain. Harry found it useful as it could be used against headaches, though it lacked the potency a potion would have. For the second spell, Lestrange taught him a manticore repelling charm. Harry did not think it would come in that handy, but he still made an effort to learn it.
Harry knew it wouldn’t be the most impressive or useful gift Neville would get, but hopefully he’d like them anyway.
It was more awkward to support Albert once they were all naked. Harry and Lucius bracketed Albert and allowed him to set the pace. This unfortunately meant that Harry couldn’t use his hands to cover his privates while he walked. And since everyone was curious about Albert’s injuries, everyone was watching them. Despite this, Harry was willing to sacrifice his dignity to help Albert.
“Like them pretty, do you?” teased Mulciber. As much as Harry wanted to punch the man, he had no qualms about admitting Mulciber had grown on him. He was crass and had a mean streak, but Harry found his frankness refreshing. Except perhaps in this particular situation when the man was tactlessly mentioning his crush. In general, it helped that Harry didn’t have much of a history with the man prior to Azkaban. Mulciber also seemed to be the only one that didn’t see him as a kid. He interacted with Harry like he was an equal.
Hale, Runecraft, and Scrimgeour circled around the issue a few more times, essentially stating the same things again and again until another wizengamot member cut in.
“Your dad talked about you,” Harry said. Draco made a face, so Harry quickly added, “nothing embarrassing.” Except that wasn’t quite the truth. He wondered if Draco would be embarrassed to know Lucius spoke about his cute footy pajamas. It was the sort of thing Hermione or Ron might get embarrassed about. Harry just thought it showed how much Lucius cared about his son.
"It's the form my patronus takes," Harry said. He debated for a moment but decided to tell them it had also been his father’s animagus form.
“But you are,” insisted Asherath. “The closest comparison would be when one of your kind is with child. At first the difference is imperceptible, but as the new soul grows, their combined light stands out above the rest. And yet, none I have seen has matched your brightness. The child’s soul is too new, still developing, and once the pregnancy is over, both humans return to a brightness that is no different than the rest. Appealing but no more so than any other of your kind.”
There were two carriages waiting for them outside of Hogwarts. Although they appeared to be the same size as the ones that bring the students from the train to the school every year, these had no thestrals pulling them. In fact, there was no sign of any animal pulling the carriages along. Harry futilely hoped that meant it wouldn’t be able to leave the grounds.
“Draco?” he whispered. He wondered if this was finally the moment Draco realized Harry wasn’t good enough for him. They had solid proof now.
Harry reluctantly shuffled over to the black curtain. Anton made his way over and handed him a plaque. It contained the serial number that was written on the folder.
“It didn’t really work,” Harry admitted. He knew it was something he should be proud of but he honestly felt disappointed that he hadn’t been able to hold it on her longer.
“Congratulations, Mr. Potter,” Hale said with a smile. He pulled Harry up from his chair and gave him a firm handshake.
. Not really. But he’s still all there. Like, mentally. He’s relatively healthy. Er, he lost weight, but he’s still eating!” Harry said. Despite not painting a good picture, he thought Draco looked less tense than he had a moment ago.
“Shouldn’t you be in class?” Harry asked. He wasn’t surprised to see Ron and Neville skip, but it had to be a first for Hermione.
Just in case, Harry decided he should contact Hale for advice too. The man would be able to tell him about specific laws or policies that he should look into, or perhaps certain people he should talk to. Plus, the man had a remarkable ability to use words as a weapon. Maybe he would be willing to coach Harry on what to say when advocating for change.
“That can’t be legal,” Harry stated slowly. He was beginning to wonder if the death eaters were just trying to mess with him in any way that they could.
“That’s – well, that’s good Harry,” Hermione said placatingly, “but they are still... bad men. They’ve done some really horrible things.”
“Harry wasn’t given the opportunity to attend those classes. You, on the other hand, choose to daydream instead of paying attention,” Hermione said snidely.
Before he could finish reprimanding Mulciber, the door at the end of the hall opened. Almost immediately Burke’s angry voice shouted out.
“No,” Harry’s voice came out stronger but still wasn’t the yell he had intended it to be. He tried to grab his clothes, but Burke grabbed his wrist. He pinned Harry’s hand near his head so that the boy was unable to stop himself from being exposed.
“Get off,” Harry hissed. He blindly swung his arm towards the guard. Burke caught it easily, but in the process let go of Harry hair. Before Harry could feel grateful, Burke yanked Harry’s arm down to his side then swung his own leg over Harry’s torso to trap the arm between Harry’s body and his own. Harry struggled to buck the man off him, but Burke settled heavily over Harry’s torso.
“Yeah. I mean... you seemed interested, so you can study them some more, or whatever,” Harry said awkwardly. It made Harry happy to see Draco hold his messy notes as close as he held the mirror.
It was a lot of information for Harry to take in. While he was glad that Burke’s soul hadn’t merge with his own, that relief was outweighed by a horrible realization.
Harry couldn't help the derisive snort he gave at that statement. The woman went from sympathetic to insulted quickly, so Harry cut in before she could say anything else. “The ministry hasn't bothered to do anything but blame me for underage magic, whether or not it was actually
They had to end their reunion when the prisoners heard the guards entering their block to pass out meals. Harry could have spent the whole night talking with them, but still felt satisfied overall.
“Yes. Pansy isn’t going to do anything that would hurt Draco, Greg won’t hurt Vince, and Blaise can be bought,” Theo explained.
Hope y’all feel this was worth the wait. I had written half this chapter months ago, but then didn’t feel like writing for the longest time. I’m trying to get back into it as I want to finish this story.
The two guards turned towards Harry next. Their mocking smiles stilled and Harry thought they looked a little uncertain. Harry didn’t recognize either of them from when he arrived.
“Hale did tell me that you’d been at the ministry,” Harry offered as an olive branch. He left out the disparaging comments Hale also said about Dumbledore’s power struggle with the ministry.
“And like I said earlier, it’s best if we don’t know specifics,” Theo said. “What if we’re caught? If a guard finds the other mirror, or a professor catches us with this one, we’re screwed. The more we know, the worse it’ll be for us.”
Harry took to researching two-way mirrors as obsessively as he had tried to figure out what Draco was doing all year in the Room of Requirement. He really hoped he’d have more luck with the mirrors than he’d had with Draco. It helped that he had someone assisting him this time.
Unfortunately, Harry saw the moment surprise turned to suspicion on the dour man’s face. Snape struggled to undo the damage. Harry didn’t feel much better when he chanced a glance around the room. Nott was watching Snape work with a thoughtful expression. Draco appeared worried as he kept glancing over to watch Harry. It made Harry’s stomach churn unpleasantly. He didn’t want to look unstable. He could feel many of his classmates’ stares on him for the rest of the class, which intensified when Snape finally gave up on fixing the wall and left some noticeable lines. When they were finally dismissed, Harry had to hold himself back from running out the door. He tried to look calm and collected as he packed up his things. Harry had mixed feeling when Nott complemented him with an “impressive” as they passed each other on the way out.
“I have an interview set for tomorrow with a reporter,” Harry said after he decided to be honest and upfront with Nott.
Harry’s other problem was that his general body order really was becoming quite rank. Azkaban apparently didn’t believe in deodorant. Probably because it was too cold to work up a proper sweat.
“I’m aware,” Harry parroted back. Usually when his uncle said much the same to him, Vernon was satisfied to hear Harry agree. When Harry was younger, he had tried sticking up for himself, but that only lead to more chores or being sent to his cupboard. Eventually Harry discovered that if he agreed with Vernon then the man would decide he’d filled his daily quota of making Harry miserable. Harry wondered if the same strategy might work with Burke. In a lot of ways Burke reminded him of Vernon; they both had the same misplaced sense of superiority. Unlike Vernon, Burke wasn’t satisfied with Harry’s insincere agreement. Instead it seemed to pull all the air out of Burke’s sails, which pissed him off more.
“I understand if you don’t feel comfortable coming to me as I’ve obviously failed you in my duties as your Head of House. I’ll always be willing to listen should you want to talk. I hope...” McGonagall paused briefly before she pressed on. “I ask that you consider the possibility of a mind healer-”
“Yes… I’ve tried to follow him a few times,” Harry was reluctant to admit how obsessed he’d become, “but he uses Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts so it’s difficult to-”
“Thank you... again. These really are b-” Draco stopped mid-sentence and turned towards a retreating Theo. “Where are you going?”
“Is there one for my mum too?” asked Crabbe. “She’s been...” he trailed off awkwardly as he eyed Harry, not sure how personal he should be with him.
“I’m sure you must have at least seen the draconifor spell,” Lucius stated. Harry vaguely remembered it from his third year. “Normally the dragons are small, but you could increase their size for a more… spectacular effect.”
to me,” Ginny stressed. She looked as if she thought Harry was able to confront the dark lord that very night.
“I didn’t even know Canadians could get angry,” laughed Rabastian as he recalled the trouble his brother had gotten into.
“Yes. I didn’t know at the time, obviously, but it fits. It had his memories, was able to possess Ginny, and it was trying to use Ginny’s lifeforce to gain his body back,” Harry pointed out.
“I made a mirror to go with your brush,” Harry told him and held up the mirror. “If you hand me the brush, I can add some shrinking and enlarging charms so that the guards will be less likely to notice it,” Harry offered.
“Oh! Sorry. Hermione, Ron, this is my judicial-wizard Reginald Hale,” Harry introduced them. Hale recognized Hermione’s name from her letters and thanked her for sharing some interesting reading material. With a pleased smile, Hermione launched into a comparison between wizard and muggle laws that she found interesting. Harry had no idea what she was talking about, but he was amused to see Hale’s surprise at her eagerness turn into genuine interest in the subject.
Once inside the building, John and his shipmate broke away from the group and Harry was sorry to see them go. So far, John was the only one to question the ridiculousness of the situation. While Perkins seemed sympathetic enough, it is clear that he was willing to go along with it.
“Oh Harry, you couldn’t have helped that. We know... we know you would have done right by her if you’d been awake,” Mrs. Weasley said.  Harry nodded, because he would have asked Ginny to marry him, and would have been so grateful if she’d decided she wanted Harry after all.
Harry decided that Crabbe’s plant ought not to move while it was in its mini size given that drew attention to the figure when the purpose of shrinking them was to easily hide the objects. The password Harry selected for Crabbe was “Hyacinth”. Once it reached its full size, the life cycle of the plant would start automatically. If the password was said a second time, it paused the animation before shrinking the plant.
Mulciber was cracking up in his cell. Even the Lestranges seemed to be chuckling. Lucius looked uncomfortable but serious.
“How could I when his father’s right here and threatening me with unnecessary sex ed lessons?” Harry responded. Mulciber snorted, Rodolphus chuckled, and Lucius tried to look unimpressed but ruined it with a smile. “But, er, he is that too,” Harry added shyly. Draco might not have the same glow about him this year, but Harry thought he was still unfairly beautiful.
Draco knew Harry would enjoy the food more than the decorations. Draco had not cooked it himself; he was willing to admit that wasn’t one of his many talents. So, he got his house elf to make gourmet versions of all of Harry’s favourites. He asked Mrs. Weasley to help with a couple of side-dishes because he knew from experience that Harry felt no other could compare to her cooking. But the heart of the meal was the desert. Hidden in a scrumptious treacle tart was an engagement ring.
“Yes,” Harry answered. He had not looked away from the man, so he noted the relief his words brought.
“Oh! Yes please,” Crabbe said. A second later he was holding out his toilet paper roll between the bars of his cell. The other men seemed equally as eager at that suggestion. Harry dutifully softened the toilet paper to each man’s preference.
“I’m sure Miss Granger’s work is as thorough as always,” McGonagall replied. Hermione, who was standing nearby, preened at this. “Still, I want to see for myself how you’re fairing.”
I’ve mapped who is in the cells around Harry (see image at the end of this chapter). I might move them around if the story needs someone in a cell closer to Harry but for now this is what I’m picturing. If you’re wondering why some of them didn’t talk, I assume it’s because they were sleeping or something. They’ll have a presence later on.
It was bittersweet the first time he saw Teddy and James next to each other. Under different circumstances he would have been thrilled to see two of the marauders’ descendants growing side-by-side. It wasn’t the same knowing one of those children was really a horcrux reincarnated.
“Perhaps you also want to stay in solitary,” said Burke. He tilted his head as he surveyed Harry, and all three men could practically see the wheels turning in his head. Burke was clearly hatching a new plan to get to Harry away from prying eyes.
Harry tilted his head and slowly pulled his collar down until the new tattoo was visible. Malfoy hissed in shock.
“Not all at once,” Albert cut in before Harry offered to give Hale a letter from them all. “One letter can slip through the cracks, but eight letters are more likely to be noticed.”
Dumbledore and Runecraft were heatedly talking. Dumbledore was trying to converse quietly but the student body was so completely focused on the whole scene that his and Runecraft’s voices still carried across the hall.
“Er, right but...” he couldn’t explain why he felt he shouldn’t move on, so he lied and told them “there’s no one I’m interested in.”
Mrs. Weasley was patient with him as she taught him how to properly care for a baby. He was uncomfortable holding the child, but he did it because it was not fair to ask the Weasleys to do it. Still, his reluctance must have shown because each of the Weasleys gave him concerned looks at one point or another. Only Hermione had been willing to call him out on it. He still couldn’t explain the horcrux, so he settled for revealing a different truth; one that would have made him nervous had James actually been his son instead of a horcrux.
“Pott-” Snape was cut off when Harry flinched hard. An angry crimson-coloured spell shot from his wand. Fortunately, he had not been aiming at anyone, as the spell left a deep crack in the wall that quickly spiderwebbed. The entire class stopped what they were doing to either watch Harry quickly shift away from Snape, or where the crack continued to spiderwebbed up the wall about four feet.
“Professor-“ Harry tried to catch Dumbledore’s attention, but the auror whose name Harry didn’t know pushed his shoulder and forcibly guided Harry along. They were out of the hall and on the grounds before Harry thought about properly resisting.
eaten other food. People food. Well, not other people but food appropriate for humans,” Harry had to force himself to stop babbling. He took a deep breath and tried again. “I’m not, er, digesting it like you would. I don’t know if I’m digesting it at all.”
“Albert?” Hale questioned. “I wasn’t informed that he was hurt. What happened?” Hale asked the latter to one of the guards.
Burke gave Harry a look so foul that not even the Dursleys could hope to match it. Harry knew it wasn’t smart to antagonize the man. Burke had already shown he was willing to hurt Harry. He wouldn’t be satisfied until Harry was broken and miserable. But there was a part of Harry that couldn’t back down even if it was the healthiest, safest option. He hadn’t done so for uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, or Dudley. Snape had tried with limited success. Hell, even Voldemort would be able to tell Burke it took a lot more to keep Harry down. So, while Harry stared at Burke’s blotchy face, he determined that this pathetic man would not be the one to break him.
“The good news is that your case is playing out favourably in the media,” Hale said jumping right to it. “You were starting to lose some support. Dumbledore’s... failure to have you released immediately was lending credibility to the ministry’s unorthodox approach. After speaking to Mr. Nott, I had enough information to steer the media into looking into last year’s ministry-approved detentions. Reporters have been interviewing students non-stop these past couple of days.”
“You haven’t healed him?” Hale said in lieu of a greeting. “No, no, don’t bother just yet. I’m taking photographs of this... unless you have already done so?” The man was not surprised when the guards admitted they had not documented Harry’s attack.
“Maybe not in the hallway? I was trying to take Draco somewhere we wouldn’t get caught, but Parkinson insisted I get vetted first,” Harry said.
“I would if you’d bothered to show Potter his place,” responded Jugson. “What would the dark lord say if he knew you were passing up an opportunity to-”
“You’ll get it in time,” Lucius reassured him. Both Albert and Lucius were convinced Harry would master it with practice. Harry just resolved to stop looking anyone in the eye from now on. Just as well considering after the third day of radio silence from the outside world, their routine had finally broken.
The two were forced to cut their bickering short when they entered the library. They occasionally exchanged heated whispers, which grew in frequency each time Hermione refused to share her notes with Ron.
“You’re not,” Draco snapped back. When Harry just raised an eyebrow in response, Draco sagged and sighed. “Alright, there is some... damage,” Draco flinched as if saying the word caused him physical pain, “but, you’re still whole.”
Harry didn’t know how long it took him to tease out the soul, but he was patient. He sent his magic out so that it gathered Burke’s soul and nudged it up and out of the man’s mouth. Harry couldn’t help but marvel at his success when a glowing white orb floated just past Burke’s lips. Later Harry would wonder how someone as revolting as Burke could still have such a pure-looking soul. For now, he just took a moment to observe the soul hovering between him and Burke.
For the next several months, Draco updated Harry on interesting soul magic spells and rituals he’d discovered. Nothing directly helped solve the horcrux concern. Harry was a little disappointed but understood Draco’s analogy of being at a first-year level of knowledge on this branch of magic, while horcruxes were advanced seventh year stuff. He knew it could take years to have any solid answers... assuming it was even possible at all.
“Potter, whatever you had to do during the war... stop beating yourself up over it. You were in a war. It was justified-”
“You’ll find that many of the guards like to play mind games. They eagerly exercise whatever small amount of power they have,” Malfoy explained.
As far as I know, Theodore Nott’s father was never given a first name. I’ve named him Albert but if anyone knows if he has a canon first name please let me know.
“Potter are you-” Wiblin froze midway to Harry when the boy flinched back from him. Wiblin had been too close to Burke for Harry to trust him. It belatedly occurred to Harry that he was still naked from the waist down. He pulled his sheets around him since he didn’t know where Burke had tossed his clothes. Wiblin gulped as he glanced at Harry’s covered lap before focusing on his fallen co-worker.
“My tattoo... another guard helped him do it. And they helped him take Albert away so he could beat him up,” Harry said.
This caused a minor argument between Ron and Hermione. Hermione accused Ron of never taking school seriously, while Ron countered that Hermione was too serious about their schoolwork. It was a common disagreement between them. It usually annoyed Harry, but now he found comfort in the familiarity of it.
“Did he write about me often?” wondered Harry. Harry felt his cheeks heat up immediately and hoped that Azkaban’s poor lighting hid it. Lucius still have him a knowing look.
“I don’t understand,” Draco said, unable to confirm that Harry’s son would be alright. He didn’t know how James was part of Harry’s biggest secret. He thought whatever it was happened long before James was born.
Harry and James moved into Malfoy Manner when they returned. Harry had thought it would be weird living with his in-laws, but Draco pointed out that the manor was huge, so they’d have their privacy. Harry had ultimately agreed because the manor was brighter and less stifling than Grimmauld Place. He hoped it would be a better environment for James.
they were in some cases, and having no idea how to destroy them, Harry was desperate. Ron was desperate. Hermione was desperate, though she tried to hide that as much as she could from Harry.
“I know,” Harry said. There must have been something in his voice that revealed his own self-hatred, because both Ron and Hermione tensed. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley pause and watch them. He let out a breath and tried to explain as levelly as he could.
“Still in Azkaban though,” Crabbe pointed out. Before Harry could try to reassure them that Hale was working on Albert’s case, Draco cut in.
Harry left soon after as he couldn’t leave James with the Weasleys all morning. They’d done enough for him as it was. He dreaded facing Mrs. Weasley as he worried he’d see her disappointment in him. Instead, Hermione was waiting for him and he didn’t know if that was better or worse.
Under the curious and watchful eyes of Albert and Lucius, Harry had put the box together. He applied the shrinking and enlarging charms, though he did not use 'Harry Malfoy' as the password. "Stag," Harry said pointedly.
“Draco, you’re babbling,” Harry cut in. He’d been able to follow Draco’s rushed explanation, but felt he should interrupt. His husband didn’t usually get flustered; not unless Harry did something to either anger, embarrass, or arouse him. So, seeing Draco nervously info dump everything on him made him uneasy.
,” Draco said. He moved away from the comfort of his fiancés’ arms so that he could look into Harry’s eyes. “I know the ritual to create a horcrux.”
Using the floo almost made Harry sick up again. He didn’t, but his stomach didn’t settle for a long time. He distantly heard Draco order a house elf to prepare a guestroom. He let Draco support him once more as they made their way up Malfoy Manor’s elegant staircase.
Harry picked at his food wishing it was something else for a change. He froze when he suddenly tasted Mrs. Weasley’s Sunday roast. He concentrated on his food and was delighted when his next mouthful tasted like treacle tart. Harry felt mischievous as he focused on Lucius’ food and shared the Sunday roast flavour. He giggled when Lucius paused mid-chew with wide eyes when he registered the change.
“Join the line, Potter,” Burke ordered. Harry weighed the pros and cons of refusing. As nice as the Death Eaters had been, Harry wasn’t sure if that would last once they could reach him. Harry was especially nervous as he could now see the Lestrange brothers. In fact, most of the men he could see were looking at him curiously now that they could finally observe him. It was a nerve-wracking experience. With a deep breath, Harry moved out of his cell.
Perhaps, if he’d never found his mother’s ring, and if he’d never had to run from some snatchers, the idea of creating his own horcrux would have remained just that. An idea. A crazy, desperate thought that rattled around his brain. Never spoken aloud. Never followed through.
“That’s different though. No, really. What you did when you were a Death Eater... that was forced upon you. You never cast a curse unless they forced your hand. You didn’t eagerly participate in any of his schemes,” Harry pointed. He felt Draco exhale against his chest.
“Don’t you?” Harry asked. Andromeda and Draco, and by extension Narcissa, were the ones who saw the most natural interactions between Harry and James.
“Harry,” Lucius said in a tone that was meant to placate him, “it’s hard to believe in the good of muggles when most of our grandparents actually lived through decades of witch hunts.”
Neither Mulciber, Crabbe, nor Avery were animagi so there was a slight debate on what the sixth side of the box should be. Crabbe had suggested a bowtruckle, but Avery thought a kelpie would look cooler.
“I awoke to the sounds of a struggle. When I sat up, I saw Burke attempting to- well, we’ve already established the vile act that bastard intended,” Lucius said judgmentally.
“Harry...” Draco sounded sad instead of disgusted, but Harry found he didn’t like that either. He didn’t want to make Draco sad.
Afterwards he met up with Hermione in the library. He figured it was still the safest public place he could be in Hogwarts. Some students still watched him and a few others pretended to look at the shelves nearby but were clearly listening to his conversations. Luckily no one dared face Pince’s wrath by being too disruptive. Harry managed to finish a couple of his assignments before Ron found them and urged them to go for dinner.
“Rise and shine, Nott. Rise. And. Shine,” one of the guards mocked. Harry’s eyes widened as he realized that Albert was Albert Nott. Harry assumed he was Theodore Nott’s father or perhaps an uncle.
“It will take more work,” conceded Malfoy, “But you don’t have much else to do in here anyway. Plenty of time for review.”
“But I’m not pregnant,” Harry said. He was fearful of where this conversation was headed. Burke hadn’t succeeded in raping Harry, but perhaps consuming the man’s soul had made pregnancy possible. Harry feared he was carrying Burke’s offspring... or worse, Burke himself.
Hale was back the next day and demanded to see Harry immediately. Unfortunately for Harry, the visit centered on paperwork, none of which were release papers.
“Theo was already helping me with this part anyway,” Harry said as he riffed through his bag to dig up his notes.
“That was a house elf!” Harry angrily cut in, finally unable to censor himself. Why were they bringing that up again? Hadn’t they covered it in his trial last year?
“Watch it, Nott. It’d be a shame to inform your judicial-wizard that you could not make your date because you were in solitary confinement,” threaten Burke. Nott’s sneer became more pronounced, but he didn’t reply. Harry was glad that the man remained close to them.
Despite the glorious comfort of his bed, Harry couldn’t sleep any easier than he had in Azkaban since eating Burke’s soul. He laid in bed for a long time, only partly comfortable bundled in his comforter. He felt hot but was unwilling to get rid of the comfort of his blanket. He stuck a foot outside his sheets and hoped that would help cool him down. Harry wanted to sleep, he really did. Unfortunately, he felt wide awake no matter how still he forced himself to remain. Try as he might, he couldn’t calm his thoughts either. He worried there would soon be noticeable consequences for how long he had remained awake. He vaguely recalled that someone, probably Hermione, once told him that sleep deprivation caused hallucinations. Harry had enough problems without adding that to the mix.
“James?” Harry questioned with a wobble in his voice. There was no question the child was his. Not with his father’s messy black hair, and his mother’s green eyes.
“Not help, er, with whatever that is,” Harry clarified and gestured towards the room of requirement. As much as he liked the Malfoys, he wasn’t about to help Voldemort’s schemes. “I just mean...” Harry trailed off. The truth was he didn’t know what he meant. Unless Draco confided in him, Harry didn’t know enough about the situation to offer anything.
“You can have my memory of that,” Harry offered. “It probably won’t help much since I didn’t see Burke attack him. But I heard him threaten Albert, and gloat when he returned him to his cell.”
Harry paced nervously as soon as Nott disappeared. Lucius tried to distract him by reviewing spells, but Harry wasn’t able to focus. He kept wondering if Nott’s judicial-wizard would agree to take him on as a client. By the time Nott was returned to his cell, Harry was a nervous wreck.
Harry and Draco eventually settled back into their routine, and Harry let go of his fear that Draco would leave him. He still felt in his heart that he was unworthy of Draco; that creating a horcrux had permanently tainted him and there would always be a part of him he couldn’t give to Draco because of it. Consequently, he would have left their relationship as it was... had Draco not proposed.
“This was supposed to remind you that you’re mine now,” Burke remarked. “No matter. I’m sure I can find another way to have the message sink in.”
“So long as you don’t keep doing so in public places – ministry property, no less, you should be able to practice with relative ease,” stated Nott. Harry gave him an incredulous look.
“Did that guard really try to rape you?” asked Goyle when it was clear Harry had nothing more to add about Lucius. Goyle jumped when one of the others kicked him under the table, but the damage had been done.
The slow pace wasn’t Burke’s insightful way to increase Harry’s worry and fear. They were moving slow because Albert seemed incapable of going any faster. The guards seemed content to let Albert take slow painful steps rather than help by levitating him or healing his wounds.
” one of the dementors announced. This was hardly reassuring as thus far their questions had been confusing.
a solid white. There seemed to be minuscule transparent blank spaces throughout the mass, but these spaces were filled then emptied as the white parts seemed to move at a slow pace. The longer Harry looked, the more he began to think of it like steam rising from a cup of tea. Only instead of rising up, the more substantial parts circled around in a contained amount of space. Where these silvers overlapped and intermingled, they became more visible and gave off that white light effect.
“Well,” Scrimgeour said, focusing intently on Harry as if not acknowledging the others’ presence would afford him the same treatment from the inmates. “It’s all good to be Dumbledore’s man Harry, but that loyalty will not help you in here. Think about my offer, will you?”
word, not just bodily but magically as well. An unseen force pushed out from his chest and when it reached Burke, it toppled the body on to its side. Burke’s arse was now facing the guards, but his vacant gaze was pointed towards Harry more clearly than ever. Fortunately, the man’s crotch was still somewhat facing downward. Harry hated seeing what was left of the man, but he did take his first deep breath since taking Burke’s soul. He clung to the knowledge that Burke couldn’t hurt him anymore.
Harry’s poor mood grew worse as Snape peppered his lecture with snide comments aimed at or about Harry.
“You don’t need us to teach you that spell, do you?” Mulciber teased. “I thought you said you knew sex spells.”
“So, er, there are some letters for you,” Harry explained and gestured at the box. The others all stared at the box as if it was about to jump up and attack. It was Zabini that broke the impasse by plucking one of the top letters.
During his turn to teach Harry something, Crabbe decided to combine herbology and potions. Crabbe told him about a flower that on its own is benign, but if fertilized by unicorn dung, it glowed and could be used in potions. After describing the flower, Crabbe transitioned into potion lesson. Rather than describe a particular potion, he talked about the effects that flower’s stem and petals might have on potions. This led to Macnair jumping in to talk about unicorns and their properties.  While Harry had covered unicorns already, this review helped him make the links between classes.
“Well, Albert is the one who hired Hale for me,” he said hoping that Hermione’s practical side would understand how beneficial that was to Harry’s release. “And they made me
Harry had been content to leave it there. Happy to take whatever time Draco gave him, and not be selfish to ask for more. He honestly had not intended to progress into a romantic relationship, but somehow fell into it anyway.
Harry was sweating by the time his name was called. He hated being back in the courtroom and was terrified he’d screw it up for Hale and Albert. McGonagall tried to be supportive as Harry rose from his seat, but Harry was unable to look at her knowing she wouldn’t like whatever he ended up saying while on the stand.
“Are you sure?” Hale had asked when Harry slipped him the letter. “Considering why you’re in here...”
“I’ll take it,” Draco sighed. “I have to find a way to get you to see it, to believe it. But for now, I’ll take it.”
Harry was led to a room not far from where he was given his tattoo. As they approached the door, Harry noted that there was a large window that allowed anyone in the hallway to look into the room. Harry noted that a man was already waiting in the room and had a bunch of items laid out on a table in front of him. Harry only had enough time to notice the camera before he was being pulled forward.
“I hope so,” Harry said. He placed his empty cup on the desk. He didn’t know how much he should say to Dumbledore, but Harry didn’t feel good about leaving Lucius and the others in those conditions.
“Only what I know,” Harry said. They others were quiet as they could all guess Harry had shared his suspicions about Draco being a Death Eater.
Several snatchers happened upon them on one of their rare ventures back to civilization. Later Harry would learn he’d led the snatchers to them by saying Voldemort’s name, but they assumed it was merely bad luck when it happened. They’d been unprepared, and were forced to split up to make it harder for the snatchers. Harry managed to shake all but one. He’d apparated away once he was clear of the muggle population, but the snatcher had grabbed him at the last second. Harry pushed the man away when they landed in the forest. He readied himself to run again but stopped at the sight of blood. Lots of blood. The man had splinched himself so badly, he had difficulty breathing. He couldn’t raise his wand to heal himself, let alone stop Harry from kicking it out of reach.
Burke and another guard walked over to Harry cell. For a brief moment, Harry thought that perhaps Dumbledore had done it and Harry was free. But one look at Burke’s smiling face let Harry know that wasn’t the case.
“I’ve already asked Neville to explain his and Hermione’s class notes,” Harry informed her. Since Neville was one of her stronger students, Sprout was satisfied with Harry’s choice.
“He won’t be safer with me,” Harry whispered. He couldn’t blame Lucius if his acceptance was only a scheme to provide his son with extra protection. It pained him, but he could understand it. Lucius was trapped, unable to help his son except perhaps to convince someone else to take on that responsibility. The plan might have worked if Harry had been anyone besides the boy-who-lived. “Vol – you-know-who would just be even more happy to hurt him if he knew Draco mattered to me.”
“Yeah,” confirmed Harry. It surprised him how happy it made him to see Crabbe smile. Harry hadn’t thought much about Crabbe jr. even though he’d early on realized that Crabbe sr. would love the opportunity to use the mirror as much as Lucius and Albert.
One gift down, but still two hours to go before Harry had to pretend to be sleeping, Harry pondered what other gifts he could make. Hermione’s birthday was the next one after Neville’s… but Draco’s birthday still came before both of them. Harry didn’t know if Draco would even accept a gift from Harry, assuming Harry made something he felt was good enough
A small foot tapped the side of his palm, and lightly jostled the remains of the ring. Harry slowly turned horrified eyes to the baby still in his arms. His eyesight blurred as the full horror of what he’d done dawned on him.
“If two sad sacks like Lucius and I could get the gorgeous Black sisters to agree to marry us, I’m sure you’ll do just fine,” encouraged Lestrange. Lucius rolled his eyes but didn’t bother addressing the insult. From Lucius’ stories, Harry knew the man felt blessed to have Narcissa as a wife.
“Albert Nott has given me his account of the incident. If the court would allow-” Hale tried to propose.
“The way he flies,” Harry admitted quietly. “Even in our first year, it was just so… elegant. Which is ridiculous because when he plays quidditch he’s so far from sophisticated. He cheats, and tries to knock me off my broom – he once pretended to see the snitch
“But I can’t just leave it,” Harry said miserably, “it hurts.” It was more of an excessively uncomfortable feeling than true pain. All the same, Harry felt like it would drive him mental if he had to live like this forever.
“I already am,” Burke gleefully stated and went back to working on the second rune. Harry tried to struggle, but the chains already held him tight and only constricted further the more Harry struggled.
“Not really,” Harry tried to shrug it off. He felt his breath catch when Zabini just smirked in response and Harry belatedly realized how obvious he was being about his crush on Draco. If the prisoners were able to figure it out without seeing Harry and Draco interact, it wouldn’t take much for Draco’s friends to figure it out if Harry kept watching him with lovesick, honeymoon eyes. Still, Harry couldn’t help but feel disappointed when Draco straightened up and they were no longer pressed together.
“I suppose we have our answer,” Harry said. When there was no immediate response, he glanced away from the atrocity before him to seek out his husband. Everything in him tensed when he saw the tears falling from Draco’s eyes. Somehow that hurt more than being confronted with his own mangled soul.
“Yes... Well sort of? I wrote in the diary and it responded. Even showed me a memory. The locket influenced our emotions. Towards the end it showed Ron... well, it was something Ron feared might happen, so it was able to pick up on our thoughts. It also tried to drown me,” Harry recounted.
That did not mean he didn’t try other spells when he was awake and alone while all his housemate slept. Unfortunately, no matter what he tried, he only saw his own reflection in the handheld mirror. It had initially been surprising how healthy he looked. There were no bags under his eyes even though he hadn’t slept for the longest time. There were no teenage acne littering his skin. In fact, his skin almost seemed to glow. He knew he should be pleased. If he looked healthy then his professors were more likely to believe it too. However, Harry was all too aware that this health was due to slowly consuming Burke’s soul. He hated being reminded of it every time he looked at his reflection.
When Harry turned back around, Lucius was watching him with a raised eyebrow. The man clearly wanted to ask what that whole scene was about, but the guards started moving them back towards the cells.
Eventually he couldn’t take the constant guilt, and nervously told the Weasleys it was time he and James moved out. He wouldn’t take away what they saw as their last piece of Ginny, so he assured them they could visit whenever they wanted. He also told Mrs. Weasley that she could babysit him whenever. In fact, he’d probably ask her to do so frequently. It was the least he could do for the good of the whole family. Especially James.
“Draco,” Parkinson said with reproach. She leaned in and whispered to Draco, though both Harry and Zabini could still hear “you remember that comment he made to Goy-, I mean Wren. Do you really think you should be alone with him?”
"Sadly no," answered McNair. "If more than 75% of a living creature tries to pass through the bars while the cell door is locked, a strong shock charm is released." Harry wondered if McNair found that out through experience. Harry questioned how Sirius got out of his cell but perhaps the window was not tied into this security measure.
“I can’t wear my earrings during this time of the year because the legonian purioes are attracted to them and they always get stuck in ear wax. They tend to bite as they pull themselves back out,” Luna explained. She rather liked that pair of earrings and thought it safe enough to keep on a quill. To Theo’s credit, he merely nodded along though his face held a stupefied expression for a rather long time afterwards.
“You know, I had an ulterior motive for suggesting James sleep over at Bill and Fleur’s,” Draco stated once he and Harry retired for the night. He hadn’t so much as suggested it as steered the conversation in that direction and let Bill think it was his idea to invite the children to sleep over and continue celebrating Victoire’s birthday with a morning brunch. Poor Fleur was going to have her hands full with her own children, James, Teddy, and the various other Weasley spawn old enough to participate.
“And yet, you call to us like a beacon,” Asherath responded. “You are so bright. I don’t think you grasp how rare that is.”
"Obvious would be engraving 'I love Draco' or 'DM + HP 4ever'," Mulciber stated. "Actually, that might be the best suggestion. It would look lovely on the top of the box."
“I don’t need any warnings or a suspension,” the other guard cut in. “We probably should have left Nott. If Hale comes by soon and hears about it, he’ll make a big stink- I mean, umm,
“Is he really?” asked a second man on the boat. He was staring at Harry’s forehead. Given the limited light on the boat, he couldn’t make out the scar.
“If you had ran to get help, surely one of the other guards would have come to your aid. He might have even been able to save Burke’s soul,” Tetley suggested.
Harry second-guessed how wise it was to open up to the press as he walked up to them. This man looked to be the opposite of Rita Skeeter’s in-your-face personality, but that did little to put him at ease. Harry didn’t have a good track record with the press, and it was hard to forget that even though he was the one to request the interview. He knew that whatever would be printed from this meeting, even if it portrayed Harry favourably, would result in the school gossiping about him. They hadn’t exactly stopped watching him, but the novelty of his return had finally started to wear off. He didn’t want to regain that attention.
“That’s just an added bonus. I’d hoped to see at least one of you. Otherwise, I would have asked Harry to come to the off-”
“Oh! You’re so far behind, Harry,” Hermione fretted, either forgetting Harry told her the Death Eaters made sure he kept up with his studies or doubting the value of whatever they taught him.
Harry didn’t answer the question. Despite their support on how ridiculous this situation was, Harry didn’t trust them not to repeat any confessions he might make. However, his silence might have been answer enough given the raised eyebrows both Albert and Malfoy were sporting.
Harry grabbed a book to lookup a spell and jostled the pamphlets Hermione had given him. One fell to the floor. Harry was about to toss it back with the others but stopped when he noticed its subject. This one was about the difficulties many prisoners face once they were released. Harry thought it might be muggle in origin, but many points likely applied to wizards as well. After he read through it, he realized he had not asked Hermione to help him develop a plan to get some positive changes for the prisoners in Azkaban.
“Thanks,” he said. She looked to be holding up OK, and Harry admired her strength. “You’re too good, Mrs. Weasley.”
"Could you make another box like the one you made for me?" he asked. "There should be enough room to fit multiple letters. You can also wear it as ankle bracelet so it's on you when you're released."
“Eaten?” questioned Mulciber before laughing. Harry flinched at the sound. He did that a lot lately.
“You can’t keep wondering these what ifs. I’ll help you figure out if James really is your horcrux like you think,” Draco said.
“Move,” he ordered and pushed Albert to get him moving. Albert stumbled at the action but quickly righted himself. He frowned but started walking as directed.
“He doesn't mean it. Not really,” Harry said quickly. He knew Albert was capable of killing them, but that wasn't the message he should be sending. Harry didn't reveal one of his most shameful secrets for Albert to prove Runecraft and the others right. It was meant to provide an understandable reason to why Albert might have spoken poorly about muggles to Harry, but ultimately wouldn't help Runecraft build a case. It wouldn't work if Albert started giving them a reason to accuse him of planning to murder some muggles.
Harry considered it. He wasn’t sure what Nott’s motivation was. As surprisingly nice as these men had been to him, what Nott was proposing would impact the outside world. He didn’t know if this would somehow help the death eater agenda.
“I know,” Harry said, and he did. He knew everyone wouldn’t give him an indefinite pass on being a miserable sod. He just didn’t know how to go about it when his family was a constant reminder of what he’d cost them. He had to get his shit together somehow. Fortunately, he felt a bit lighter after unloading on Draco. “If it makes you feel better, I drunk-sobbed all over Malfoy last night.”
“I cast it but it only worked for a second,” Harry admitted and hoped that this conversation wasn’t their plan to get him to admit it out loud.
is mostly trying to do it on his own. I overheard Snape offering his help but Draco… he thought it was best if he did it himself…”
“What are you doing?” Harry asked in alarm when Burke leaned over Harry’s prone form. In response the man grabbed a fistful of Harry’s hair and yanked his head to the side.
. The knowledge subconsciously and unintentionally passed from Voldemort to Harry through their connection. Harry knew the exact steps he had to take. It was why the idea had stuck around. He knew it would work.
“I can’t,” Harry gasped as he pulled away. He was still so close, he couldn’t miss the flash of hurt that crossed Draco’s face before he started to shut down. Harry’s stomach churned as he realized Draco thought Harry was rejecting
Before Lucius could answer him, the door at the end of the hallway opened. The guards came through passing out the prisoners’ dinner. Harry was depressed to see it was the same bland meal they always got but elected not to skip it.
Once they reached the stalls, Harry was surprised that the two men still kept Harry in the middle. Harry would have protested but Mulciber abandoned his stall to move into the one on Albert’s other side.
“I won’t review any defense spells if you are so closed minded about the dark arts themselves,” snipped Rodolphus.
“Can you get to Hogsmeade this weekend? I know a reporter that would love to interview you on this topic. He’d be fair too,” Hale reassured. Harry knew the reporters still wanted him to comment on his stay in Azkaban, and Harry honestly hated it. If Hale knew one that would let the focus be on prison reform rather than Harry specifically, then Harry was all for it.
“I honestly don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry. Then, just to spite Burke, he added, “the minister and I had more important things to discuss than you.”
Harry was still uncomfortable discussing his crush, but was worried that if he didn’t distract Lucius the man would insist they go back to sex spells. “He’s smart,” Harry admitted. When Lucius raised his eyebrow, he felt the need to elaborate. “Like, not just book smart. I mean… well, in fourth year he animated these badges. They said ‘Potter stinks’ so it was pretty insulting, but it was impressive all the same. I wouldn’t have been able to do that,” he said. If Harry hadn’t been tutored by these men, he probably still wouldn’t be able to create those badges. As soon as Harry realized he got his new skill set from them, it also occurred to him that they might not be as impressed as Harry was with the badges. “It’s not just that he’s smart, I guess. It’s that he’s creative too. He doesn’t just regurgitate spells. He finds ways to use them in different situations,” Harry concluded.
“How... is that relevant to Albert's case?” ask Harry, not wanting to say anything more on the subject. He succeeded in distracting them as they debated whether to address what Harry had revealed immediately.
“Albert? Is Harry Potter really in front of us or have the hallucinations finally started?” asked Lucius Malfoy.
Harry cut off once he was face-to-face with Draco. They both blinked as they realized they were a hair’s breath away from each other. Harry briefly allowed himself to admire the colour of Draco’s eyes before he started to pull away. He stopped immediately when Draco’s hand tightened in his hair. Before he could voice the question, Draco closed the distance between them.
“How?” Harry was happy to see the beginning of a smile as Draco brought the mirror closer. But then Draco froze and glanced back at Harry. “Potter, if this is a trick...”
“Well?” prompted Lucius after he observed Harry scowling at the photo for several minutes without discarding it like the others.
“Right... this book has some surveillance spells that I thought might be a different way to go about it,” Harry nudged the book in his direction. “Unfortunately, they are either limited by distance or only active for a short amount of time.” He let Nott read the spells.
“For the most part. They, er, your dad, and er, the others, aren’t completely unaffected. But they do better than those that can’t... you know,” Harry explained. He left out the part where a dementor told him they can still sense smaller animals, but mostly left them alone because they were less appealing as meals.
“Outline?” asked Nott curiously. Harry bit his lip as he considered his options. He didn’t know Nott as well as his father, so it would be stupid to instantly trust him. But Harry didn’t get the sense that Nott was at their table for any nefarious purpose. He didn’t think there would be any harm in telling Nott, especially since it impacted his father.
“No, well yes, but that wasn’t – I’m trying to find Draco,” Harry explained, even if it did little to actually explain anything to the prisoners.
Burke’s hand trailed further down but his own body was blocking his access. Keeping a tight hold on Harry’s hair, the man slid down Harry’s body. He brought his hand to the hem of Harry’s shirt and lifted it up. Harry shivered as chest was exposed, and he knew it had more to do with Burke’s cold gaze than Azkaban’s cold atmosphere. Burke’s hand was firm as it moved up Harry’s chest, and just as unforgiving as it pinched his nipple.
“She still hasn’t forgiven me,” Crabbe stated. “She told Vince his first week at Hogwarts, that if he brought any plants to class, she would ensure they ended up back in his dorm room with a permanent sticking charm.”
“It wasn’t fair for any of us to expect it from you either,” Neville admitted. Harry appreciated the sentiment. It was something he had raged against when he learnt of the prophesy, but he had mostly come to accept it. He wouldn’t have made the horcrux if he hadn’t. It had not been fair for the wizarding world to place such a task on the shoulders of a child, but Harry had long ago learned and accepted that the world was unfair. Still, he wanted something better for Neville. The other man was too kind-hearted to be burdened with the responsibility of someone’s death.
He found Draco in a ridiculously large dinning room, made even more absurd by the fact the man was eating alone when the table could easily fit twenty-four people.
“May I?” asked Lucius. Harry didn’t know what Lucius was asking permission for but trusted the man enough to nod in agreement anyway. A second later he felt flabbergasted when Lucius pulled him in to a hug. Despite his surprise, Harry sank into the contact.
The others were quiet as they waited for him to elaborate. When it became clear he wasn’t going to, Hermione just said encouragingly, “when you’re ready, we will support you,” and they all let the subject drop.
“Rodolphus really misses her,” Harry attempted to explain. Hale didn’t push the issue. He dutifully shuffled the letter in with the pile of scrolls in front of him.
for a hug than me. I know I’ve held back. I don’t deserve it, after all I’ve done. But if James isn’t a part of me, if he’s really just my son, then I’ve hurt him for nothing. I’ve let him down. I let
“Since no one else has survived the killing curse, we have nothing to compare your symptoms to,” she said. Harry couldn’t explain it any more than she could. He didn’t mention seeing Dumbledore and the train station in what he assumed was the in-between. He certainly couldn’t mention that he’d made the choice to come back. He had several theories on why he was able to survive the killing curse, and none were something he planned to share with a stranger. He’d let her and everyone else assume it was the same thing that had miraculously saved him the first time, though Harry knew it couldn’t be. He hadn’t fallen into a coma when this happened to him as a baby.
"Flemish Giant," said Lestrange proudly. Sadly, Harry didn't know what a flemish giant looked like offhand. Lucius and Mulciber tried to describe him to Harry, but it was rather difficult to draw something you hadn't seen. Eventually it was suggested that Harry use a conjured mirror to see into Lestrange's cell like he had when setting the heating wards. Once Harry was able to see Lestrange's form, he was able to create the third block quite easily.
“I hate to ask more of you, Harry, but could you provide me with some parchment and a quill?” Lucius asked once he finished his meal.
“You’re insane,” Harry said and once again tried to buck the man off. He wasn’t flexible enough to reach him with his legs and couldn’t get enough leverage to free his arms.
“It could have been anyone,” Harry stated after he mentioned the poison was supposed to be a gift for Dumbledore. Something of his own doubt must have been clear in his expression though.
Although Runecraft had already stated why Harry was being arrested, this reminder caused the hall to finally break into whispers. It seemed that the students had gotten over their initial shock and were now ready to gossip. Harry sent an uneasy glance around the hall. When his eyes landed on the Slytherin table, he expected to see smirks sent his way. Instead he saw the same shock expressed by the other houses and perhaps a bit of sympathy. Even Malfoy wasn’t rejoicing in Harry’s ordeal. Then again, Malfoy hadn’t smiled or smirked much in the last few days. Harry figured that whatever task he had from Voldemort was taking its toll on him.
“Horrible,” Harry said. Before he could elaborate their door opened again, and Ginny walked in. Both she and Dean shifted uncomfortably as they eyed each other. Rather than exchange any greetings, Ginny turned away first and focused on Harry.
it?” Burke asked. He gripped the bars tightly. Harry noticed that the man’s knuckles were still bloody. Apparently, he hadn’t bothered to clean himself up either.
Many of the other prisoners watched the exchange. It fueled the gossip about Burke attacking Harry. With each bruise Harry revealed as he undressed, the others got a better sense of how much damaged was done. Harry hated the sensation of all those eyes on him.
Harry didn’t know how he felt about what he was just told. On the one hand, if he got to leave prison sooner, he wouldn’t care much if they started the trial without him. But on the other hand, he wouldn’t be able to defend himself beyond the statements he’d already given to Hale.
“Harry?” Lucius asked as he stared at the rocks. A few parted to reveal Harry’s face. He blinked at Lucius slowly before he glanced up and noted the low light coming from the cell’s window.
As Burke stomped angrily away, Harry quickly finished getting dressed. He followed Lucius and Nott to collect their shoes before joining the other prisoners in line. While there were still some stragglers, most prisoners where in line chatting quietly to each other. Harry once again stood between Lucius and Nott. He watched Lucius run his fingers through his hair as he tried to get out the tangles. Apparently, Azkaban didn’t believe in hair brushes. Harry knew his hair was bound to be a mess.
“Don’t worry; we’re bound for a shower soon,” Nott added after a moment. He had probably meant it to be encouraging but Harry suddenly realized it would bring a whole new set of problems. It was embarrassing contemplating taking care of his bowel movements in front of two death eaters. He didn’t know how he would deal with being naked surrounded by a dozen of them. He could picture Dudley snidely telling him not to drop the soap.
Harry reluctantly parted ways with Draco, but not before Draco offered to help set up any meetings Harry might want with the prisoners. As Harry made his way to the Gryffindor table, he wondered what would happen if he asked Draco to use the mirror. Would Draco meet him in that classroom alone? Or perhaps he’d sneak Harry into his dorm room.
“Well... I was a horcrux, right? What if that’s the spot Voldemort’s soul took up?” Harry asked. He’d stopped avoiding saying ‘Voldemort’ once the aurors started using it as a way to round up any stray supporters dumb enough to show up when his name was spoken.
“Sadly, you’re looking as atrocious as ever,” Harry teased fondly as the classroom door closed behind him.
“Is that what that smell is?” asked Albert as he made a show of leaning closer to Burke, exaggerated a sniffing noise, then wrinkling his nose. “Oh dear,” he continued, “it seems like you didn’t wash it all off.”
Eventually Madame Bones put a stop to the questions that led nowhere. “You hadn’t wanted Mr. Potter present when we went over this. You got your wish then. You can’t complain about it now,” she said firmly before adding, “if you have
“Magic,” he shrugged. Nott and Zabini snorted, and Harry counted it as win when Draco gave a small smile. They looked like they wanted to push the issue, but let it drop when Harry once again nervously glanced about the library. He couldn’t help but feel paranoid.
“Still hot... and full,” Harry answered. He wasn’t sure if the dementors experienced soul eating the same way as him but answering honestly seemed like the best way to get their honest answers and help in return. “It’s getting better, I think,” Harry said. It was either better or Harry was used to the feeling now.
“Fine!” Jugson snapped. “But if the dark lord questions why the boy left here with nary a scratch, I’ll be the first to point to you.” Neither Lucius nor Nott seemed particularly worried.
Burke brought the cloth to Harry’s neck. Harry braced for pain, but it only felt like wet cloth brushing over his skin. After a moment, he tossed the cloth aside and brought his wand to Harry’s neck.
Instead of guiding Harry to the meeting room, the guards turned the other way and headed towards Azkaban’s entrance. Harry’s heart speed up and he worried it was another trick until he spotted Hale waiting for him at the processing counter. So were the same two aurors that had brought Harry to Azkaban in the first place. Perkins smiled kindly while Bradley scowled at him.
“Because I’m not tripping over myself to serve you?” Burke asked and grabbed Harry’s hair again. “I’m not willfully blind like the others. I see what you are, and I will do what everyone else doesn’t seem to have the stomach for. Because that’s what
“Not under these circumstances,” Hermione defended, “... though, I suppose that is a silver lining of sorts.”
Despite these comforts, Harry was weary of what Dumbledore wanted to talk about. He didn’t think Dumbledore would expel him after all, but he expected some reprimand. So, it completely shocked Harry when Dumbledore opened with “I’m sorry.”
for Death Eater activity,” Stan sounded incredulous at the thought. The man knew who Harry was even if he insisted on calling Harry ‘Neville’.
“I won’t risk it, not if it’s you. If you want more children, I’ll carry them,” Harry offered. The thought of being pregnant absolutely terrified him in so many ways, but he’d do it for Draco.
“But I might not actually get out of here,” Harry thought to Scrimgeour’s parting comment. It seemed like Dumbledore was having trouble getting Harry out of Azkaban. By now Harry had stopped expecting every sound to be Dumbledore pulling off a rescue mission, but he’d held hope that it wouldn’t be too much longer. That seemed so foolish considering Scrimgeour’s visit.
“She... she told us...” Mrs. Weasley said haltingly. He thought her difficulty in speaking was because of her grief, but when Harry glanced back at her he saw worry instead.
The others told him about the constant stream of reporters that hovered around the school. The professors couldn’t officially allow them on school grounds, but they turned a blind eye to the interviews that happened in Hogsmeade.
There was another awkward pause, and this one went on longer than the previous one. Harry desperately searched for something new to say but drew a blank.
“If your friend, Hermione ever wants to pursue a career in law, tell her to contact me after she graduates Hogwarts,” Hale continued amused. “Since I’ve taken you on as a client, she has been owling me past court cases she thought would help your situation. She even started sending muggle ones! Even academic texts on the psychology behind the temporary insanity defense, and brain development that impacts decision making skills in adolescents. The ministry isn’t likely to put much stock in muggle laws or theories, but I have found them to be fascinating reads.”
“And you think you’re somehow failing?” Draco asked. He sounded genuinely curious, and without any of the maliciousness he would have expected from Malfoy before the war. His words also lacked any trace of facetiousness, which was the general attitude others expressed when they thought Harry was blaming himself for Ginny’s death once again.
grateful, but it also makes it even more obvious how I’m... lacking. Hell, James is more likely to go to
Harry came to slowly, only jarring fully awake when he opened his eyes and registered he was in a hospital room. What felt like just minutes ago, he’d left Albus Dumbledore at the train station, determined to go back and help his friends. He had expected – well, he wasn’t sure what he expected, but it wasn’t this.
“Please don’t ask me for a bottle,” Harry turned horrified eyes to Lucius. Harry didn’t know what to do if the man asked for a bottle, let alone used it while he was in the cell across from him. He was certain his accidental magic would cause the floor to literally open up and swallow him whole.
“Take your time,” Ginny offered. She looked worried, but Harry knew it was for his sake. For a moment he considered not telling her. Keeping the ring on himself until he figured out a new plan. But he knew he didn’t have a better option, and she was a big part of the reason why he created a horcrux in the first place. He needed to make sure he gave everyone a fighting chance if he failed his first time.
Draco couldn’t account for the time between James’ birth and Harry waking up. His best guess was that the reunited pieces of his soul needed time to heal. He also couldn't explain why Harry had been functional with only half his soul before he died, but remained in a coma until his soul was haphazardly put back together.
“Arresting him was such a bad idea that I can’t even fathom what moron thought it would be a good move,” Malfoy answered shaking his head. “I don’t know how they thought this would work.”
“Honest,” Harry squeaked out. “If you’d just tell me exactly what you’re talking about, I might be able to answer you.”
“It won’t be for long, and it won’t look good for the ministry,” Hale reassured him. “Look towards the right. The press has been allowed access to your trial, and you can be certain this has been noted.”
“I would like to ask you about your scar, tattoo and experiences in Azkaban. If it’s ok with you, I would like to note your responses,” Hale gestured to a notepad and quill – the remaining items on the table. Albert had previously explained that the quill was spelled to write down Harry’s words verbatim. Luckily it couldn’t capture his tone or note any unnatural pauses Harry might make. In other words, no matter how rehearsed Harry sounded, that was something only he and Hale would know. Which was a good thing, because Albert and Lucius had coached him on what he should say to the questions that Hale was going to ask him. Hale could then use Harry’s responses with both the media and on any official documents he submitted to the ministry on Harry’s behalf.
“The kind that hurts others,” Harry said. Hermione deflated at that, and suddenly everyone understood how the Dursleys might have been mentioned. They were still confused about how Albert knew about them in the first place, but weren’t sure if the should ask Harry about it.
Harry was running hot ever since he consumed Burke’s soul, but he remembered how inadequate the prison uniforms and bed sheets are. With a bit of concentration, Harry made the air around him a more pleasant temperature and pictured it spreading out. “Did that work?” he asked.
“Well you can hardly escape in an Azkaban uniform,” Lucius snipped back. “You could always ask the dementor to explain itself,” he suggested knowing that the guards could not speak to them like Harry could.
“If all else fails, Harry can cast simple confundus charm whenever a guard becomes suspicious,” suggested Lestrange.
“Mr. Potter, Harry... if you need to speak with anyone about your experiences in Azkaban, please know that my door is always open. I know I’m not your head of house, but I want to reassure you that all of the professors are willing to listen,” she said kindly. Harry was fairly certain he wouldn’t take her up on her offer, but he appreciated it nonetheless.
“Oh, that’s right, they are delinquents just like you. They’ll probably be joining you here soon enough. I know the aurors were questioning them,” stated Burke. Harry tried not to let his worry show. Harry could overlook Burke’s taunts about being labelled a delinquent. It wouldn’t be the first time it happened. But Harry didn’t know what happened to his friends and he was worried about them just as much as he was worried about what was happening to him. It sounded like they were still safe at Hogwarts for now.
“Oh, well that’s disappointing,” continued the voice. Ignoring the ‘shut up’ that was hissed from Lestrange’s cell, the voice continued. “Crucio then?”
“Harry?” Harry heard Lucius’ voice call to him, but when he turned back around, Draco still had the mirror angled towards him with a look of wonder.
Instead of elaborating, Harry push over a scroll with the theory he had managed to work out last night. “I tried this last night, but it didn’t work,” Harry said. He had tried again in the morning, roughly around the time he thought the prisoners would be eating breakfast, but nothing had happened. Harry only saw himself reflected, and frankly he was tired of looking at his own reflection.
“I think it helps that they aren’t alone. The ministry has rounded up so many prisoners lately, that most of us are put next to someone else. Being able to talk to someone helps... you know?” Harry said. Draco nodded slowly.
Harry recalled Malfoy and Mulciber’s conversation from the night before, and figured Malfoy was trying to see if Harry would be receptive to it. He was, but didn’t know how they would teach him new spells without actually being able to practice. It was fun ‘trying out’ the darker spells the day before, but Harry doubted he had retained more than a handful of the ones they mentioned, and he wasn’t even sure if he would be able to do the spells even if he had a wand.
“I know that. But they’re more than just the-” Harry cut himself off as his eyes landed on Neville, noting his suddenly pale complexion. With Ron and Hermione, Harry could
“Er, do you mean the Weasleys?” Harry asked. He hoped she wasn’t planning on contacting the Dursleys.
“In some ways. Had I not been your judicial-wizard, it could have been disastrous,” Hale informed him with a smirk. Despite the rather pompous statement, Harry suspected there was a lot of truth to it. “It has, of course, backfired on the ministry as all sorts of lawmen are protesting it,” Hale continued to explain. Harry chanced a quick glance at the aurors and was surprised to see Perkins nod and Bradley scowl, though the latter could just be from being near Harry.
“Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” Harry said as Hedwig flew towards him. He allowed her to fuss with his hair. He took several minutes to just enjoy her company. He wished he could stay longer, but was very aware of how little time he had before the afternoon classes ended. He wanted to be back in his dorm before then.
Harry felt giddy as he walked towards the showers, high on the knowledge that he successfully got away with warding the cells. However, his good mood lasted only until he stepped into the changing room and felt the weight of everyone watching him. They were as hungry to catalog his injuries as they had been the day before with Albert.
There was silence at Harry’s bold accusation. For a few minutes, he could only hear his own angry panting but it allowed him to calm down when no one immediately jumped to defend her.
“That’s not what I said. And you accuse me of being a drama queen,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Look, Potter, we all have our demons. There is so much I regret, and plenty more people telling me I should feel bad about even more things that were out of my control. I’m not miserable, but I’m not the happy child I was before the dark lord returned. I’m not going to pretend to be either. If you’re not OK, it’s not your duty to pretend you are so other people feel better about themselves. You hide enough of it in front of the children, but no one has a right to ask you to bottle it all up. Be upset; work through your shit, and if you need help ask for it. Your friends will support you.”
“Bloody hell. He’s a natural,” Mulciber laughed breaking the sudden silence. “You know, under different circumstances, Rodolphus, you might have just had a new apprentice on your hands.”
Nott looked it over and nodded a few times. “It might work if you had both mirrors,” he hypothesized.
“I’m happy to see you’re readjusting, but you know I’d understand if you needed some time. Don’t push yourself too much. I know you’re an excellent brewer,” Slughorn said. Harry could read between the lines. If Harry asked, Slughorn would be willing to do Harry a favour by being more lenient with coursework than usual. Harry tried not to grimace. He knew the professor only made the offer because Harry was still someone he wanted to ‘collect’. Harry might have gone to prison, but his reputation was currently good with the media, so he was still desirable. Unlike Draco, who Slughorn avoided because someone he was
“Leave the boy be,” Nott muttered after he spat out a mouthful of toothpaste during his morning routine.
“What...” Harry stammered. He raised one hand to lightly pat Crabbe’s upper back. “Glad I could help... He really misses you,” Harry said, uncertain about what else to say.
“Yes, Mr. Shunpike’s case is a sad one. The evidence on him is circumstantial at best. Sadly, his judicial-wizard has not had much luck getting his sentence overturned,” Dumbledore said.
There were so many things wrong with that statement that Harry struggled to pick something to address first.
“Martin, bring Burke to... might as well be the office. Not like there is a good place to store him,” the last guard that arrived ordered once Burke’s clothes were back in order. The guard nodded and levitated the body out of the cell. Harry was happy to see them go.
“You have always been a remarkable young man. I’ve admired the strength you’ve shown in your latest troubles, but I suppose that is nothing new for you,” McGonagall said.
“Fine,” the man left the room. As he did not stand guard at the window with the other guards, Harry assumed he was going to retrieve Albert.
“Discussing theory, mostly,” Harry said. Given how upset they were that Harry thought the Death Eaters ‘weren’t that bad’, he knew it wasn’t the time to explain that he gained the ability of wandless magic after eating someone’s soul. Harry didn’t know if there ever would be a good time to broach that subject. He needed their help to figure it all out, but he feared they would think him a monster.
Anton pulled out a new folder from the filing cabinet. When he placed it on his desk, Harry noted the label was a serial number. He was pained to realize it was about to be his criminal serial number.
Perkins cleared his throat but when Harry glanced at him, the auror was still not looking at him. Harry glanced at Burke. When Burke noticed he had Harry’s attention, he sent him another one of those smirks.
Draco went with a traditional proposal. He set up a romantic dinner. It was at Harry’s home, because Harry didn’t enjoy being out in public. Too often someone came up to them to gush over the chosen one. Worse were the times someone harassed Draco about his past. When the focus was on him, Harry was embarrassed, but when slurs were thrown at Draco, Harry became angry. And his anger was explosive. So, Draco limited any public meals to the galas and events they attended.
It hurt. It was the worst pain he’d ever experienced. The pain he felt in proximity to Voldemort was the only thing that remotely came close, but this was so much worse. Harry almost threw up several times, but forced his body to go through the motions. He used muscle memory that wasn’t even his, but somehow it worked to guide him through the ritual.
“Please sit,” Hale said. He wasn’t quite what Harry was expecting. Given that Lucius and Albert had spoken so highly of the man, Harry had expected a pureblood with a holier-than-thou attitude. The man was certainly dressed in an expensive robe, but otherwise didn’t look like most pureblood wizards Harry knew. For one thing, the man’s hair was shorter than most purebloods his age seemed to prefer. Hale styled it so it still screamed ‘expensive’, but it almost seemed like a muggle hairstyle. Furthermore, the man has built in a way that Harry had come to expect only from Quidditch players. Unlike most wizards Harry knew, Hale seemed like he spent a good portion of his time exercising and building muscle. It made the man appear imposing. His apperance probably helped him in his chosen career.
The guard opened the door for them. Burke pulled Harry closer before leading him through the door. It was the first time Harry saw any cells or other prisoners in the place. The cells were built so that the prisoners, rather than just facing one prisoner across from them, were able to see into two adjacent cells on the other side of the corridor.  It seemed like even more an invasion of privacy, but Harry realized that might have been the point of the design.
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said with wonder. He raised a hand to touch it but felt nothing. He realized that had been foolish. Draco had not removed his soul, merely allowed it to be projected in front of him. Still, Harry would challenge anyone to see it and not want to touch it.
With the benefit of being animagi, both Malfoy and Nott seemed to recover quickly. Crabbe was still moaning pitifully in the cell next to Harry, so Harry assumed the man was not an animagus. He didn’t hear anything from Lestrange’s cell. Harry suddenly wondered how many of the death eaters were animagi and may have been privy to Harry’s terrifying encounter with the dementors.
my fault,” Harry responded. He knew this was on Burke but knowing and feeling were two separate things.
“Are you sure? That one is complex,” Hermione pointed to a spell on the next page. He read it over, asked her a couple of questions, but managed to grasp the concept quickly. Hermione tried to mask her surprise, and Harry felt a little smug. When he proved capable of quickly catching up with the rest of Hermione’s charms notes, he felt vindicated by their shocked but impressed faces.
“No, the dementors are definitely the worst,” another voice responded. “At least for anyone who isn’t an animagus. I’d take a beating any day over reliving
Harry was uncomfortable and cold, but he wasn’t his usual pitiful mess around the dementors. He assumed that meant the dementor wanted to talk to him again.
Harry placed the additional spell work on the brush. He then transfigured one of the smaller pebbles into a thin chain with a clasp. He added a small loop on the handles of the brush and mirror before stringing them on the chain. The end result was a two-charm bracelet.
“Thanks,” Harry said, then remembered that Hale had told him Hermione kept mailing him muggle court cases and theory. “Reginald Hale is impressed with you. Thinks you should go into law,” Harry said with a smile.
He left the others to their essays and went searching for the beginner rune books Hermione suggested. Fortunately, enough time had pass that those that had followed him to the library were now genuinely focused on their homework or reading. Very few people bothered to look his way as he made his way to the Runes isle.
“They’re stalling,” Hale growled. He put several forms in front of Harry to sign. He gave a description of each one as the legal babble on them went over Harry’s head. “Between Runecraft and Hawkworth, I imagine they’ll get you to sign every form in the ministry before they release you.”
“Then... it won’t matter if this,” Wiblin gestured vaguely in Harry’s direction, “waits until there’s no longer any media focus.”
The next several days were blissfully Burke-free. It was possible that the man had previously scheduled these days off, but the prisoners all assumed it was because of Albert’s gift. Harry smiled whenever he pictured Burke opening the package and getting dosed by an aggravated plant.
Harry stared at Lucius, who looked earnest yet encouraging. Harry wanted to accept what he was saying, but it sounded almost too good to be true. Harry craved acceptance but had learnt to be wary of it all the same. He had grown close to these men over the past couple of weeks, but that didn’t erase all the negative history that existed between them. Harry watched Lucius and tried to figure out why the man would be keen to encourage the boy who once tricked him out of a house elf. Even if Lucius had forgiven all past transgressions, once they left their Azkaban bubble, new problems would arise. Voldemort was gearing up for a war that would pit Harry against them. Lucius encouraging Harry to pursue his son seemed foolish, unless...
“I’m not half bad at charms either,” said Mulciber. While his words were humble, his tone was not. “And of course, the dark arts.”
“It’s important that you look like a respectable young wizard today,” Hale insisted. To emphasize this point, Hale pulled out a jar of hair gel from his own robes. “I hope you don’t mind, but we should really tame that rather atrocious hair of yours,” Hale’s tone was kinder than his words. Harry let the man style his hair despite not having a mirror where he could check out the results. By this point in their relationship, he trusted the man to make him look better rather than worse.
Dobby greeted him before enthusiastically getting a small meal at Harry’s request. Harry was glad that Dobby didn’t ask about Azkaban beyond making sure that Harry was ok. The other elves mostly ignored him unless he spoke to them first. It was the most pleasant meal he’d had since being back at Hogwarts.
Harry was surprised to see Nott still at their table when he returned. He had assumed that either Ron would drive him away or Nott wouldn’t voluntarily stick around without Harry there. It made it easier to only have to recount the interview once.
“Harry, just the man I wanted to see,” Hale said with a large smile. “This is my son, Dazhbog,” he introduced, and Harry tried to keep a straight-face at the somewhat pretentious name. The two students said hello politely. Harry had not thought too much about Hale’s children, though he vaguely recalled the man being concerned about them when Umbridge’s actions had come to light. Harry wasn’t too surprised to learn the man’s son was in Slytherin. He assumed it was Hale’s house as well.
Harry briefly considered telling McGonagall about his study sessions in Azkaban. However, Ron and Hermione’s shocked reactions did not bode well. It seemed like McGonagall, and by extension Dumbledore, would have a similar reaction. Harry didn’t want to deny his new friendships, but he held back. It had been a long day already and he had no desire to deal with the fallout of that on top of everything else. So, he strategically pretended to struggle with some spells. McGonagall seemed content overall. At the end of their meeting, she informed him that he only had to complete the missed assignments for the spells he’d ‘struggled’ with. Had Harry known this was her intention, he wouldn’t have pretended to struggle that much, suspicions be damned.
“Er, well… Fudge is no longer minister. It’s Scrimgeour now,” Harry started. He wasn’t sure exactly what to talk about but he saw the value in talking. In the quiet mood that had sprung up after lunch, Harry had been left to worry about his situation. Even though these men were death eaters, speaking to Malfoy and Nott helped distract him.
About 40 minutes into Lucius’ systematic review of charms, they heard the door at the end of the hall open. Feeling panicked, Harry recalled the heat he had spread out to the other cells. He heard Crabbe and the Lestrange brothers whine at the sudden drop in temperature and softly apologized.
“Can any of you actually cast healing charms?” Hale asked the guards waiting outside the room. There was a moment of silence as they seemed to realize the trap Hale was setting. If they admitted to knowing the spells, then they let two prisoners suffer unnecessarily. If none of them could perform the spells, Hale would use it as another example of the ministry’s incompetence.
Considering Burke left without unlocking Harry’s cell for the dementor, Harry was pretty sure that the threat to have him kissed was just a scare tactic. However, Harry had seen enough of Burke’s personality to believe that the man would probably try to assert his dominance again somehow.
“Oh! Oh no, dear,” Mrs. Weasley confirmed. There was an awkward pause as all of the Weasleys tried not to think too much about how baby James had been created.
“Alright... well, I have- had a two-way mirror. I broke mine, but that’s besides the point. I was thinking about it last night, and I thought... well... it would be a good way to secretly communicate with someone. Er, I have a mirror, a new one that is, and I’m trying to figure out how I can connect it to another one. One that’s far away... in Lucius’ cell to be exact...” Harry haltingly explained.
“Oh?” Harry asked. Draco had created several spells over the last few years, and Harry never failed to be impressed by them. By Draco.
“You unwrap it, stick the back to a section of the wall, smack the center, and then back up. Before you know it, there’s a nice-sized hole in the wall you can squeeze through,” Ron explained.
“That’s quite insightful,” said Lucius once he realized Harry was done. He was giving Harry a soft look that many people would assume the man incapable of. Harry shrugged feeling embarrassed.
As they pull away from the shore, the fog grew thicker until Harry could barely make out the men next to him. Bradley tightened his grip on Harry’s arm. Harry briefly entertained notions of kicking the prat and trying to swim to shore but quickly discarded the idea. Even if Harry could undo the magical bindings and lose them in the fog, he was no longer sure which direction to go. With his luck, if he didn’t drown, he’d probably end up swimming to Azkaban… or into a waiting dementor’s arms.
Burke spelled the cell door open with a flourish. The man was noticeably in a better mood. His eyes tracked Albert as he painfully made his way back into his cell. The prisoner was slightly hunched over. Once his arms were no longer tied behind his back, he held one arm close to his side. His posture made it clear that there were more injuries under his clothes.
“Well what’s your favourite colour?” Harry asked Asherath. He thought perhaps if he learnt their answers to the questions, he might be able to figure out what they wanted from him.
“He... hit me. Just a few times; it’s not like it was something he did all the time or anything. But he was really angry so he hit me that time, and locked me in my – in the cupboard,” Harry admitted. He was flooded with shame as a few of the witches and wizards broke their silence to whisper to each other. “It wasn’t too bad. I mean, it didn’t hurt for too long. I think, I think I might have unknowingly healed myself with magic.”
“We said everything we needed to. Besides, I know I’ll get to speak to him again soon,” Theo said. “However, there’s someone who wants to speak to you.”
“McGonagall came with me,” Ron said and smirked. “She kept interrupting the auror or telling me not to answer until I could hire a judicial-wizard,” he explained. Harry thought it sounded a little but like Hale, though he imagined McGonagall would be upfront with her criticism.
“Just focus on the memory you want me see,” instructed Hale. Harry tried to only think about the memory he was willing to share. He prayed that no memories associated with Burke’s soul got caught up in the extraction. Harry suspected that even if it did, his secret would be safe with Hale.
Ron had called him a love-sick fool on more than one occasion. Harry didn’t deny it. How could he not be when Draco consistently proved to be the best boyfriend on the planet. The man somehow juggled his studies, additional research, taking care of James and Harry both, and still made time for family, friends, and various social engagements. In comparison, Harry felt like he did nothing all day and still ended up exhausted.
you. Your aunt- you didn’t do it on your own. You did it for your mum. That’s a good reason. I thought I had a good reason, but I
“Couldn’t sleep?” Lucius asked. He watched as the rocks circling Harry soared high so as to leave Harry’s face visible. Given that Harry was looking at Lucius, it was clear to the man that this movement was done subconsciously.
“Don’t be shy, Potter,” Burke called out from his spot at the door. When Harry looked back at the man, he noticed Burke’s wand and eyes were squarely on Harry. “If you dally here, there won’t be any hot water left.”
“Harry,” a witch Harry didn’t recognize spoke in a gentle tone, “you don’t have to be family for someone to care. If you would have come to the ministry, we would have made sure you weren’t kept in that unsafe environment.”
Harry’s stomach growled, which he figured meant he should stop lingering in the room. He might be used to eating small meals, but the unhappy gurgling his stomach made let him know he needed to recharge. Harry decided he’d make good on his promise to get food from the kitchen.
1996?” Runecraft cut in as soon as they’d officially started. Harry looked to Hale for guidance, but the man had already jumped in.
That was true. It seemed to roughly occupy the same amount of space Draco’s had. Even if Harry added up all the thin blank spaces between the healthy spots, it wouldn’t take up half the space.
When their attempt to discredit Harry’s memories failed, they focused their attention on asking Harry questions. Harry felt like they picked apart anything he said as much as they could. Runecraft in particular tried to twist Harry's words. Several times he quoted some statements Harry had made from the transcript Hale submitted to the court, purposely cut to be damning. Each time, Harry glared at the man and elaborated so it wasn't as negative for Albert. Ito tried to censor Harry once, but Hale stepped in, read the whole statement Harry had previously given, and simply asked Harry to confirm that he’d said it.
“Go back to your post for now,” the guard told Wiblin. “You’ll have to make a statement, but for now...” the man gave a tired sigh. After one last glance at Harry, the man walked away. Wiblin dutifully followed.
“I just... he shouldn’t have to live through Azkaban simply because the ministry needs some... sacrificial lamb,” Harry said. An overwhelming sense of sadness came over him. “Honestly, no one should have to live though Azkaban,” he added softly. It was horrible conditions for even the guilty to have to live through.
“Draco!” Harry called. It came out louder than expected, so Harry was glad that only the three Slytherins were nearby. A couple of second years had seen him head in this direction, but Harry hoped they didn’t care enough to follow him.
“Nah, this isn’t on you mate,” Ron said. There was a slight pause before he added, “sales have increased since then. I think people wanted to support you through the shop,” Ron added.
“It feels wrong to say this, but I’m actually looking forward to Snape’s class tomorrow,” Harry said once he finished copying the last spell in Hermione’s defense notes. It sounded interesting.
“Be sure to give them a kiss for me while you’re at it, won’t you?” Harry responded. Malfoy made a choking sound he attempted to cover with a cough. Nott was smirking and did nothing to hide it.
“What did he do though?” asked the first man. “I wasn’t even aware he was standing trial. Bloody papers sure missed that one-”
“It was my pleasure,” Hale said. Before they could say more, Perkins walked up to them to return Harry’s belongings. He didn’t much care about his school robes, but he reverently held his wand once it was returned in one piece.
Warmth spread through Harry at a rapid pace. He panted through the initial shock of it all with his eyes clenched tightly closed. His hands nearly ripped his sheets as he struggled to breath through the feeling of Burke’s soul seemingly spreading throughout his entire body. It was too much and the knowledge that it was Burke made the whole experience agonizing. The bastard managed to get inside Harry after all. Harry gagged but did not think that the dementors had the ability to regurgitate a soul after consumption. At least, Asherath hadn’t shared that knowledge. Harry was left trying to control his breathing as the too-hot/too-full feeling settled in his body.
“Look, I’m never going to think you’ll find someone as good as Ginny... but that doesn’t mean you have to be alone the rest of your life,” Ron elaborated.
“James can stay with me for the night,” she offered. He probably should have felt ashamed of being such an incompetent dad, but in that moment, he could only feel relief.
The box also housed the photos Harry had created of his friends. He suggested that the others occasionally store their own photos in Albert’s box to reduce the risk of the guards finding them. As much as it pained them to part with those photos, they agreed it was safer to only pull them out when they needed to.
The cell had enough space that Harry didn’t feel like the bed was right next to the toilet. He had been able to do a decent pacing session when he told Malfoy and Albert the story of how he got here. The bed wasn’t overly large but was made to fit a grown man. Unfortunately, sheets were about as thin as the uniform and likely wouldn’t do much against the cold. The mattress was too hard. Harry had grown used to Hogwarts’ mattresses for most of the year. However, his bed at the Dursleys was not that much different from the one in the cell. When the Dursleys had reluctantly moved Harry to Dudley’s second bedroom, they had needed to provide him a bed. Rather than buy him a new mattress, they had elected to buy Dudley a new bedroom set and gave Harry his old one, including the worn-out mattress.
Harry watched his son with a bit of wonder. Hermione assured him that James was healthy, and the others all took turns filling him in on what he’d missed. George tried to claim he was James’ favourite uncle, but Ron had protested claiming he’d always be the favourite because he was also his godfather.
“As shocking as that is,” Mulciber said sarcastically, “I’m more surprised that Harry here isn’t an entitled arsehole.”
“I believe you,” Asherath determined. He turned to Ishanders and added, “had he known how, he would have halted this one as well. It clearly distresses him.”
Harry was trying not to shiver but couldn’t stop it completely. The cell was cold and his prisoner uniform was doing little to fight against the cold. Harry was also pretty sure his shaking was partly due to fear. Harry wanted to break down but refused to do so in front of a bunch of death eaters so he fought the urge to cry and scream. He wasn’t sure how long he would be able to hold out but he hoped he could make it until the others feel asleep.
“You appear less... bright,” Asherath explained. “You are still brighter than the rest, but the newest soul is fading. It is not as bright as last I saw you.”
“Not today,” he said. He was vague enough that Dumbledore could interpret that to mean anything from needing to discuss what happened with Burke, or even the events leading up to the crucio casting that started this whole mess. Harry didn’t think he’d ever want to talk about any of it. He would avoid the horcrux issue too, but he’d need all the help he could get if he had any hope of safely removing it.
party. Basic healing spells should be taught to the guards, though that would be less important if the guards were not permitted to injure prisoners in the first place. And, there should be more humane living conditions for the prisoners,” Harry stated. As relieving as it was to know he wouldn’t have to go back to Azkaban, he feared what would happen to Lucius, Albert, Mulciber and the others once the public eye wasn’t on the prison as much.
Harry frowned. He was ashamed to admit that part of him wanted her to suffer despite everything he just said.
“Well, I am quite gifted in charms and transfiguration,” boasted Malfoy. It was the first instance where the man lived up to the mental image Harry carried of the arrogant Malfoy family. It surprised Harry that he didn’t mind the bragging as much as he once would have.
Since the Harry and Draco interactions can’t happen just yet, I’m trying to bring Draco in where I can. Thus, Harry being obsessed with his handful of photos. Somewhat creepy? But let’s face it, we’ve all been there.
“Mate, if Azkaban is so bad that even Umbridge doesn’t deserve it, then it probably really is too much,” Ron said. Harry blinked a few times at Ron’s sudden agreement, but it was a huge weigh off Harry’s shoulders when he realized Ron was genuinely on board to help Harry with his Goliath-sized campaign for prison reform.
“Yeah. My scar. And he didn’t mean to make me into one. So, it can happen accidentally, you see?” Harry pointed out.
“Well, let me know if there is anything you don’t understand,” Hermione said as she handed over her transfiguration notes. Harry didn’t bother working on any of the essays the others had been assigned. Instead he focused on copying Hermione’s notes and making sure he understood them. Neville was particularly excited about Harry’s new dedication to herbology and answered all his questions. He didn’t seem as surprised as the others that Crabbe Sr. had been the one to provide Harry with his new fount of knowledge.
“Ginny – she tried to pick a name you’d like. James after your father, and Prewett, well that’s my maiden name,” Mrs. Weasley explained though she looked worried Harry would object.
“Then perhaps you can attend his trial as character witnesses. In the meantime, Potter will be taken into custody. Now, there are five other students we need to question about their involvement in the break in at the ministry,” Runecraft reminded everyone. Bole pushed forward with Ron and Hermione.
“I appreciate that sir, but I shouldn’t have a problem in your class. You always make potions so interesting. I wouldn’t want to miss anything,” Harry said. He knew he laid it on thick with Slughorn, but the man wasn’t be suspicious at the flattery. With Harry’s other professors, Harry was more subtle when hinting that he liked their subject enough that it wouldn’t be too strenuous for him to catch up. So far, his professors took him at his word, believing he shared their love and enthusiasm for the subject regardless of how much Harry might have shown in the past. He did have a renewed interest in learning all magical fields, but he certainly embellished for their benefit.
“So why did they do it?” The question came from the cell next to Harry. If he remembered correctly, the man in that cell was Vincent Crabbe’s father.
Harry started with the injuries on Albert’s face. Most of those were healed by the basic healing spells he’d learn in charms. It still baffled him that many of the guards had been unable to master these spells. There were a few deeper gashes, but a mental episkey healed those up.
“How can we help?” asked Crabbe. Immense gratitude chased away his self-pity. He knew he should be troubled by why these men weren’t disturbed by the knowledge that Harry ate someone’s
“Draco... there is something you need to know. If you really want to marry me, you should know this beforehand...” Harry said.
“Look over my Defense work?” Theo asked and passed over a scroll. Harry dutifully read it and was amused when half-way through he found a note addressed to him.
There wasn’t much in his pockets. A half-eaten box of Bertie Botts, a note he and Ron were passing each other during Charms earlier that day – he rather hoped they hadn’t written anything embarrassing or incriminating - and the beginning of his Charms essay that he decided to scarp and start over. As Burke pulled out the items, Anton marked a note of them on his form and started placing them in a bag.
“Still doing things wandlessly, I see,” said Albert as he too sat up on his cot. Like Lucius, he watched the movement of the rocks and was impressed by Harry’s ability to converse and keep up the fluid motion.
“Think you can make this water warm?” asked Albert as he washed his hands after his morning piss. “Cheers,” he said almost immediately after, which informed the others that Harry had once again performed magic soundlessly and wandlessly.
Harry tried not to be too obvious when they were around other people after those comments, but he found himself slipping when he was alone with the other man. When Draco had gifted James a nightlight that projected stars on to the ceiling, Harry had not been able to stop admiring it. James had developed a fear of the dark, but none of the store-bought nightlights had seemed to help. Draco decided to create his own, and James was finally satisfied with the softer dispersed lights and its ability to play a soft tune if he was still scared. Harry hadn’t been able to stop complimenting Draco’s brilliance that night.
Harry thought that Auror Perkins seemed inclined to agree with Dumbledore but that could be wishful thinking. Mr. Runecraft, on the other hand, was clearly annoyed at the interruption.
From the hallway Wiblin kept looking into the cell. Various curses left him, and his eyes kept sliding from Harry to Burke and back again. Harry still wasn’t wearing his glasses so Wiblin’s features were blurry. Just having the man nearby was doing nothing to calm Harry’s racing heart and laboured breathing.
Despite no longer viscerally feeling the dementors by their proximity, Harry held his breath and clenched his fists to stop his hands from trembling. It felt like it took them ages to approach Harry’s cell. It was only the whimpers and moans of the non-animagus prisoners that let Harry know the dementors were moving in his direction. The delay gave Harry enough time to second guess whether or not he should ask them for answers. He got the feeling that he wasn’t going to like whatever he learned. It was only seeing the peacock and porcupine in the cells across from him that gave Harry the resolve to push forward. If the two death eaters were forcing themselves to remain relatively close instead of cowering in the corner, then Harry ought to have the same strength to face his new reality.
Lucius steered Harry back to the line up while Crabbe appeared and convinced Mulciber to get a shave after all.
Fighting back tears, Harry slowly made his way down his body leaving the appearance of hand shaped bruises and a few scratches. The deep bite mark looked particularly harsh. Harry didn’t know when he had healed himself, so he wasn’t sure if his illusions matched up to what the guards saw. He’d just hope that they hadn’t looked at him too closely.
They still weren’t sure about how souls developed. Draco was reasonably certain the spell he created was safe to use on children, but just in case, he didn’t want to use it on James unless it became necessary. He hoped he could convince Harry that James wasn’t a horcrux without having to resort to it.
“Better some mystery bland thing than a mysterious pungent meal” responded Malfoy. Harry watched Malfoy scoop up some of the beans and eat it. Harry cautiously did the same. He figured if the aristocratic Malfoy could eat it, it was something Harry could manage.
her; wishing to have both my sisters back in my life. How foolish that seems now. The fancy of a lonely child...”
“Among other things,” Harry said. He decided to trust Theo’s judgement of them. Theo began asking questions, so Harry explained what he’d discovered that afternoon and how it helped with their project. Eventually the others grew bored, and all but Crabbe retreated to sit and wait across from them.
Harry had a hard time falling asleep that night. He alternated between hoping that Dumbledore would suddenly appear to release him, and dreading that the suddenly talkative dementor would come back. Neither happened and Harry eventually succumbed to sleep.
The sound of the hallway door opening again interrupted whatever Wiblin was going to say in response. Heavy footfalls moved towards the little gathering. Harry wasn’t surprised to see it was yet another guard.
“Right... er, I do have something to tell you. I – I, shit, I don’t know how to do this,” Harry admitted.
He needed to create something impressive without being over the top... except Harry wondered if over the top might be the only way he
Harry next focused on Mulciber’s cell and built a similar illusion. He waited until he was almost in front of the cell before he activated the wards. He breathed easier once he felt them set without any visible confirmation. He didn't have as much time to build an illusion in front of the second Lestrange brother’s cell. He knew it was sloppy work, but gambled on the fact that the guards’ attention was elsewhere.
“No, I-” Harry cringed and looked away from the guard in case his guilt was plainly written on his face. “No.”
Harry tensed, because of course it was Runecraft, and Bones hadn’t been wrong about Harry saying things just to spite him. Harry glanced at Albert and made a quick decision even though he knew he’d regret it on a personal level later.
“There isn’t really that much time left in the school year. I don’t want to fall behind if I take even more time, er, away,” Harry stated and hoped that appealed to the professors. McGonagall looked as if she agreed, but Snape looked unhappy. Of course, Snape was the perfect example of ‘Resting Bitch Face’. No surprise there.
When Harry saw a large B displayed at the end of the hallway, he wondered if they were transferring him to the other ward. However, Burke stopped in front of a door just before block B started. Unlike the other rooms they passed along the way, this one didn’t seem to have a large window allowing them to see into it.
“She had to listen to me practice this enough times, she won’t want to hear you say it again,” Draco said, but he did go through his speech so that they had an PG version to share that left out the innuendo, and the subsequent follow through as Draco did get Harry to follow the rose petals to the bedroom. Their friends would be curious, but not
“It’s not that,” Harry said. There was definitely no love lost between Harry and the Dursleys. “I just don’t feel like talking about them.”
“Uh no,” Harry admitted with a cringe. Albert wouldn’t be happy if he heard Harry was skipping classes. All of his previous tutors took his education seriously, but Albert was definitely a stickler for keeping to daily lessons. “I didn’t want to deal with Snape today.”
“I see… well, if you’d like to use my office…” Snape drawled. It couldn’t be a more obvious attempt for the man to snoop on their meeting.
. It was as if it wasn’t a big deal aside from the novelty of the act. Harry knew he should be repulsed by what it said about them as people. He shouldn’t let their concern and acceptance ease any lingering guilt. Harry knew a good person would be horrified, and yet he could only muster up feelings of happiness that they were willing to help him and had no intentions of squealing to the guards.
Harry spent most of the reception moving from guest to guest and thanking them for attending. He barely got to eat any of the food Draco had painstakingly selected. Before he knew it, the night was over, and it sunk in that they were now Mr. and Mr. Malfoy-Potter.
“You don’t have to. Especially if you think it would get you in trouble with the ministry,” Harry responded.
“Leave,” Burke insisted again, but he was watching Harry’s horror-struck face instead of the dementor. He lay atop the boy to keep him pinned down. The hand that wasn’t holding Harry’s wrist was pressing Harry’s face to the cot so that Burke had free range to access Harry’s tattoo. Harry shivered as Burke leaned down and licked it. A second later the man moved his mouth a few inches over and harshly bit down. Harry screamed and tried to pull the man off with his free hand, but once again was unsuccessful.
“Harry, you explain to Draco,” Theo said and practically shoved Harry into the classroom. A few seconds later, Draco joined him and the door closed behind him.
There were a couple of minutes where no one said anything, just watched Harry or exchanged glances with their neighbors. Harry knew that if the courtroom didn't have anti-apparating wards all over it, he would have accidentally apparated himself back to his old school’s roof just to get away from everyone. He looked at Hale somewhat desperately.
Harry whipped around to see Burke. The man frowned as his eyes swept over Harry’s uncovered and unblemished chest. It wasn’t hard to guess that the man was looking for any damage Jugson might have caused.
When Draco frowned down at the notes, Harry wasn’t sure if he was confused by the magic or Harry’s handwriting. “I can explain... if you want,” Harry offered and tried not to grin like a fool when Draco accepted. As Harry explained how he used the blood permanence spell as the base for the connection without undoing the initial transfiguration spell, he felt Draco’s side press up against his. While Harry answered questions about how he solved the issue of the significant distance between the mirrors, he felt Draco’s breath glide down his neck. When he showed Draco the notes of his previous failed attempts, he felt his own body temperature rise but wasn’t sure if was due to Draco’s proximity or the flush that occurred whenever Draco complimented his work.
“Well, yes, but I meant to carry on the family name,” Lucius stressed. As Harry was still looking at Draco with admiration, he saw a flash of something cross his face. When he didn’t jump in immediately, Harry suspected the Malfoy name was as important to Draco as it was to Lucius.
“Merlin, no,” Lestrange said. “I wouldn’t subject my love to this place again. I just wish I could see her.”
“I can,” one guard admitted reluctantly. He entered the room and approached Harry. Harry tensed as the man’s wand pointed at him but forced himself to pay attention to where and what the man was casting. Each time he felt magic run over his skin, Harry silently cancelled the illusion of the injury. It was a slow process.
Over the next couple of days, Harry collected letters from his fellow prisoners. In total, he had one letter for Nott, one for Draco, one for Narcissa, two for Crabbe jr., two for Crabbe's wife, one for Avery's wife, one for McNair's wife, one for Mulciber's mother, one for the Lestrange brothers’ father, and three for Bellatrix Lestrange. While he did not know the contents of most of those letters, he had heard snippets of the ones meant for Bellatrix. One was the sappy love note Harry had expected from the man. Another contained equally sappy poems and sonnets, though Harry suspected they were mostly the product of boredom than any true interest in poetry. The last one was more on the raunchy side. Mulciber had helped Lestrange write that one. As the two traded suggestions back and forth, the letter had grown increasingly dirty. Lucius had eventually begged Harry to cast a privacy charm because he did not need to picture his sister-in-law in such positions.
“How the fuck were they supposed to escape if Potter was naked?” the last guard stated, pointing out the obvious flaw in Lucius’ story.
Their next major focus was trying to determine if Albert had spoken against the ministry. Harry used to opportunity to remind them of their own failings by mentioning Albert hadn’t been happy to hear about Umbridge at Hogwarts. Scrimegeour, who’d been surprisingly quiet up until then, insisted that that was a failing of the previous minister. Given the direction Harry was willing to take this line of questioning, the wizengamot decided to drop it quickly.
“But who are-” Harry started to protest, wondering just what sort of criminals Burke planned to place him with.
“No!” Ron and Harry said at once while the girls laughed. From the corner of his eye, he saw Dean give Ginny a disgusted look.
certainly won’t judge you harshly. It’s admirable that you went to defend your godfather’s honour. It’s actually impressive that one so young managed the cruciatus curse. You don-”
Harry created a photo for Crabbe as well. That picture was a combination of the man’s son and Goyle, since all of Harry’s memories of the other boy had Goyle in them as well. Crabbe cried quietly when Harry gave him the photo.
“It was fine,” Harry replied as his hands clenched his shirt. He wanted to put it on, especially as Burke’s eyes focused on Harry’s tattoo. Unfortunately, Harry didn’t trust Burke enough to have his vision obscured even for a few seconds.
It didn’t help that when the guards brought breakfast, they too were staring at the area. Harry assumed that Burke or Wiblin must have been bragging about it to their colleges.
“Shouldn’t we be at the ministry?” asked Harry. The auror’s answer and attitude were doing nothing to alleviate his fears. In fact, Harry’s imagination was growing and leaping at wilder theories. Were these men really death eaters and were using this whole situation as a ruse to get Harry to Voldemort?
“Attention! Attention!” yelled one of the guards, interrupting the potions review. The man followed up with a series of banging noises. It sounded as if someone was passing a metal bar across the cell’s bars. The noise grew louder as the guard came closer to Harry’s cell. He didn’t pause as he continued down the hallway, but he was walking slow enough that Harry realized the noise came from the man’s wand rather than a physical tool. Harry was grateful that the guards didn’t carry metal batons, like the muggle police had, despite knowing their wands were capable of just as much damage.
“Lucius? How does Lucius have a mirror in his cell. No, don’t answer that,” Nott said with wide eyes. Harry was glad he didn’t have to elaborate.
Luckily, his new tutors didn’t seem to notice. They insisted Harry review the wand movements and magical theory behind each spell he mentioned. They would help fill in gaps on his grasp of the theory. Whenever he wasn’t sure about the wand movement, either Malfoy or Nott would demonstrate. Occasionally this was complicated by the fact that neither men could recall themselves. It became somewhat of a game of magical
The medi-witch was able to confirm that Ron, Hermione and Neville had all survived the battle. Given Neville’s heroism, and Ron and Hermione’s closeness to both Harry and Neville, their actions were celebrated and reported on for months following the battle. The medi-witch was less informed about everyone else and promised to look for an old newspaper that listed all the deaths.
“I’m coming back,” he repeated. One way or another, he was coming back to her. That was the whole point of the horcrux.
It occurred to Harry that the man probably thought Harry had done the same given he barely had any facial hair to speak of. “Oh,” Harry blushed.
The unexpected boon moving in with the Malfoy gave Harry was that he was able to start his auror training earlier than planned. Narcissa had insisted as she spent most days watching James anyway. Now that the boys were old enough to play together, Teddy and James insisted on seeing each other frequently. With Andromeda also there, Narcissa pointed out that there wasn’t a need for three adults to watch two children. Harry disagreed considering the mischief the two had started to cook up but ultimately relented once Draco agreed it would be a good time for Harry to start his career.
“Thanks,” he said and sat down next to Draco. He wanted to make a quick escape, but knowing his first stop would have to be the Weasleys to pick up his son had him agreeing to the acceptable delay.
was a Death Eater just to spite you,” Madame Bones said as she took over the questioning. Despite Harry preference for Madame Bones, he was nervous by this turn of events. He would not be able to pretend she was twisting his words around should McGonagall ask later. Harry was willing to expressly state Albert had his full support; he just dreaded having to explain it to his professors who were already keeping too close of an eye on him.
Hale agreed to take the memory at the end of their meeting. He would review it and determine if it was worth entering as evidence for Albert’s trial.
“There is still some paperwork we need to do,” Hale said, but sighed deeply. “Though we should probably do it when Runecraft isn’t standing across the room, looking like he’s one snide comment away from murdering us all.”
“You do?” Harry asked, genuinely surprised. “Even after seeing that,” he gestured up towards the projection of his soul. Despite every reassurance Draco had given him, Harry was certain Draco would eventually wise up. Or, if he insisted on staying with Harry, he may no longer think of Harry as a good choice to father children with.
“And...” Harry paused before the next example could spill out. Perhaps because he’d thought about the Dursleys, he almost mentioned Albert’s hatred for them too, but he caught himself in time. His reluctance to mention them wasn’t for Albert’s sake though. He knew he could find a way to justify any hatred the man had said about them, but it would cost Harry to do so. He thought it best to spare both of them the potential trouble. Unfortunately, some members of the wizengamot caught on that he’d almost said something of importance.
Harry felt his stomach drop as his cell door suddenly opened. He was grimy enough that a shower was long overdue. However, all the other prisoners’ cells were also open. It made him nervous.
“If you’ll step over there, by the black curtain,” Anton directed. Harry felt his stomach clench. He normally hated having his picture taken but this one would probably be the worst one yet. He could already see it printed it in tomorrow’s
He left the stand after that. He felt everyone’s eyes on him as he returned to McGonagall’s side. He was uncomfortable with the attention. Harry regretted revealing so much, but he also knew he'd do it again for Albert.
Perkins sat comfortably beside him, though he was watching the scenery go by rather than Harry. The still-nameless auror was sitting across from Harry and watched him suspiciously. His wand was out and aimed at Harry as if he expected Harry to either attack him or jump out of the carriage at any moment. To be fair, Harry was considering both options but didn’t think the odds would be in his favour.
Draco carefully watched Harry dig in to the carefully marked slice. The minute it took Harry to find the ring would go down on his top five most stressful moments. He had just enough time to rethink his plan, suddenly worried Harry would swallow it whole without realizing it was there. He relaxed minutely when he saw Harry furrow his brows and spit the ring into his napkin in a more graceful manner than he would have before he dated Draco. Harry’s breath hitched as it registered what he was looking at, and Draco prepared to propose.
“Perfect execution,” observed Lestrange. Considering how often they made Harry practice the spells each day he’d been there, it would have been embarrassing if he couldn’t properly cast them. Still, Harry couldn’t stop smiling each time they gave him a genuine compliment. That sense of pride was not diminished even if it was for perfectly performing a dark arts spell.
As the conversations continued around him, Harry let himself slowly relax again. At least until an uncomfortable feeling in his stomach started making itself known. He tried to ignore it as long as he could.
“Yeah. Increased salary too,” Ron said. “But it was horrible in the meantime. If Fred and George’s shop hadn’t been doing well, we would have been in trouble. Except, they seemed to realize that and tried going after the shop too until Fred, well, he sort of... leaked that you’d been the one to originally finance the shop. The ministry backed off because they knew it’d look like they were targeting the shop because you were a silent partner.”
Once the wards were complete, Lucius encouraged Harry to continue reviewing charms. A couple of times, he corrected Harry’s stance but overall was pleased by how much Harry retained of their lessons. Every so often, Lucius paused and asked Harry to describe what he was feeling. Eventually, Harry got a feel for how the magic built up within him and passed out into the world. Harry found he was repeating himself, which didn’t seem helpful to him until he subconsciously deodorised the whole area after Lestrange had gone to the bathroom. Harry belatedly realized that his sense of the magic in both cases was the same. He was not able to stop any accidental magic, he could adjust the strength of the spell if he caught it as it happened.
Harry wanted to sink into the floor. As much as he liked the thought of getting to the point where he would need to know sex spells, Mulciber was right that Lucius was the last person Harry wanted to discuss this with. This was one subject he didn’t want his new mentors to teach him, even if all of them seemed to think he’d be able to convince Draco to be in a situation where they were necessary.
Harry’s good mood lasted the whole day. He ignored all whispers about the Dursleys as best he could. A task made easier each time he locked eyes with Draco and got a smile instead of a sneer. It was a tad unfortunate that Harry didn’t see Draco outside of class that day, but Theo informed him that Draco spent most of his free time talking to Lucius. Occasionally Crabbe joined them, but Albert was at his trial, so Theo wouldn’t get the opportunity to speak to his dad until later in the evening. Harry regretted that he wouldn’t be able to talk to him too, but he supposed he could just ask Theo for details the next day.
“As the ladies and gentlemen of the wizengamot are proving, you cannot fault my client for expressing anger against these particular muggles,” stated Hale.
“Yes, it... it allows you to see a projection of someone’s soul,” Draco said. He saw Harry tense, but pressed on. “It’s like, well, have you ever seen a soul when a dementor pulls it out? It’s pretty small, surprisingly so. I had to figure out a way to make it bigger so that I could really examine it... and I finally figured it out...”
Unfortunately, Harry’s testimony was limited by his inability to confidently say what Albert had done or said that night as most of the Death Eaters wore masks. Harry had only really been able to recognize Bellatrix and Lucius.
The only one who seemed reluctant to celebrate the news was Lucius. They decided to officially inform Draco’s parents during dinner. Draco had already spoken to his mother earlier. She had known of his plans to propose and wasn’t going to wait the whole day to find out how Harry responded. She must have told her husband, as he was subdued since they arrived and Draco preemptively asked Molly to watch James that night. Harry expected to finally hear that he wasn’t good enough for his son. Instead, Lucius brought up a different concern.
They were quiet as they sipped their teas. Harry bit back the instinct to apologize in return. As he sat comfortably at Hogwarts, it was hard to recapture the terror he’d felt in Azkaban. However, he only had to think of the other prisoners still in Azkaban, and his stomach churned. If he had to make the choice again, he would still ask Hale to be his judicial-wizard. He didn’t want to hurt the headmaster, but that was one choice he did not regret.
“Shoes too,” announced Burke. Harry toed off his threadbare sneakers and replaced them with the shoes on Anton’s desk. The new shoes resized to fit Harry’s feet but that was the only impressive feature. Similar to the thin prisoner uniform, the shoes seemed to be made of cheap and crappy material. Harry was pretty sure that he’d actually be more comfortable in the worn-out pair he came in with.
“You didn’t hurt her too much, did you?” Lestrange asked. Harry wanted to retort that she deserved so much more than what she got but realized that Lestrange was concerned about his wife. It was odd to realize even death eaters had feelings and cared about their families. Harry was fighting against feeling any pity for the man. Neither he nor his wife were innocent victims.
“If I had run away, either the guards or dementors would have likely thought I was trying to escape and probably would have hurt me more,” Harry said slowly. He tried to hold back on the sass, but didn’t think he succeeded in hiding his dislike of the man completely.
“We’re heading straight to the ministry, so you might as well change into these now,” Hale said as he handed over the higher quality robes. Trusting Hale, and wanting to leave as soon as possible, Harry didn’t argue with the man. Despite having no privacy, Harry striped with less embarrassment than when he had first arrived in Azkaban. Hale did not provide new underwear, so Harry left the uncomfortable Azkaban pair on, but the rest of his outfit made up for that discomfort. The material of the new clothes were so soft, it felt downright heavenly against his skin. It was also significantly warmer, though the coldness of Azkaban had long stopped being a problem for him.
“Leave it,” ordered Nott. He was watching Harry, but his eyes kept trailing down to Harry’s neck and the new prison tattoo. Self-consciously, Harry rubbed at the area. It didn’t hurt and was partially covered by the thin shirt, but Harry felt like it was as noticeable as a giant scarlet letter.
Perkins led the way, with Dumbledore and Harry following closely behind. The headmaster placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder to better steer him around the crowd. Just as they surged forward with questions for Harry, Hale loudly offered to speak on his behalf. The crowd didn’t seem too keen to let Harry go, but with Dumbledore and an auror serving as buffers, Hale was clearly the best way for them to get a comment for their stories. Once they were past the main crowd, their walk out of the ministry was unimpeded. Just as quickly as Harry had been whisked away from Hogwarts, Dumbledore brought him back.
“Yeah, well...” Harry didn’t know what to say. He knew Hermione was trying to tell him that he wasn’t alone, but it just made him feel worse to have left his responsibilities on their laps when they were hurting too.
Before anyone could question his odd behaviour, the box started to enlarge. Once it had grown to its full size, Harry awkwardly added “missing you” and internally insulted his past self for choosing such a sappy password. It was still less embarrassing than
“It’s alright. Good actually. Though a bit jarring since the taste and texture don’t match,” Lucius said but scooped up another sporkful quickly.
Harry didn’t know Avery enough to select a personal gift. The man’s cell was close enough to relay some lessons, but also far away enough that it made personal conversations difficult. In the end, Harry decided to create a dagger. He was fairly certain it wasn’t properly balanced, but he hoped the engraved snakes on the handle made up for it. He selected the last rune Avery taught him, “Eihwaz”, as the trigger for enlarging the dagger.
Hale was patient throughout the process and allowed Harry to review everything once they were done. When the quill was no longer recording their conversation, Hale laid out his plan of action for Harry.
“I should try to find your sons before supper,” Harry offered. Lucius and Albert were conflicted as they wanted to keep talking to Harry, but the thought of seeing their children after so long was too tempting to pass up.
“So, you mentioned your stalking habits,” Nott said. Harry blushed. Even if they didn’t know about his crush, stalking someone was questionable behaviour.
“You don’t mind, do you?” Ron said nervously. “Gin thought you’d want that. I mean for Hermione and I to both be his godparents...”
He spent the rest of the night theorizing how it could be done. He thought he could make it work if he had both mirrors in front of him, but he couldn’t puzzle out how to do so at a distance. The only reason he didn’t give up hope was because he used his own blood on Lucius’ mirror to make it permanent. Harry was certain that blood magic might be the key to connecting the two mirrors, but he didn’t know enough to figure out exactly how he can use it for this additional purpose.
plane of existence was really called. He wanted to be able to see Ginny again. He wanted to spend eternity with Draco, who was surely bound for there when he died. Harry doubted he was any more worthy of it than he was worthy of Draco’s love, but he’d take it if it was given to him. And if the best he could hope for was an eternity sitting on a bench with Voldemort’s baby soul piece in the in-between, then he’d work on building enough good memories to make up for the lack of true peace. He’d horde memories of Draco to keep him sane. Starting tomorrow, he’d treat James as his son and only his son. He’d show Draco the love he can offer their children should he trust Harry with giving him more. And some day,
recount his interactions with Draco over and over in his head. And Draco just kept taking up more and more space as Harry tried to figure out what he was up to this year. Worry slowly overtook anger as the primary emotion attached to his rival. As of late, Draco had looked more and more tired and stressed. He even stopped putting effort into his looks, which was a warning bell to anyone that knew him. Of course, coming to that realization had made Harry confront the fact that he’d always thought of Draco as attractive. He still was, even with bags under his eyes. Draco looked like he could use a good night’s sleep, but that particular line of thinking was probably best to follow when Harry wasn’t sitting in front of Draco’s father.
“Sit,” Burke insisted. Harry tried to resist, but after a short scuffle, he felt his limbs lock up. With a few swishes from Wiblin’s wand, Harry was moved towards the chair. As soon as he sat down, the chains wrapped around him. Once he was secure, Wiblin release Harry from the spells he cast. Harry tried to struggle, but the chains tightened painfully.
“I don’t know,” Harry muttered as he brushed his thumb against Draco’s swollen lips. “You’re certainly giving me a run for my money.”
“I considered bringing that wretched plant to decorate your cell,” hissed Burke. Harry had to wonder why the man hadn’t followed through with that. It would have made the entire hall of convicts miserable. Of course, it likely would have negatively impacted the guards as well.
“My client has not harmed any muggles. He merely expressed anger when he heard about a case of child abuse,” Hale counter. Harry cringed as it was stated so bluntly.
Harry accepted the bundle Hermione gave him with an ungracious “fine”. He flipped through them, noting some contained contact information on healers or health centers. Others were informational brochures about the different types of therapy, or covered various kinds of trauma. When Harry got to a booklet that centered on sexual assault, he instinctively crushed it in his fist.
“Maybe it won’t be that bad,” Neville said, but he didn’t look convinced. Harry didn’t believe it for a second. Rightfully so, as it was bad. Front page news bad.
criminal, but his awareness of the situation would be hampered by the presence of the dementor,” Scrimgeour said. The latter was a valid point, but Harry realized that if the man truly thought that then he would apply the same logic to anything Harry said given he’d been closer to the dementor.
“Well, the others followed Bellatrix’s orders… but they also respected what Lucius said…” Harry said hesitantly as he didn’t know which scenario helped Hale more.
Also, if your friend is going through something, it's probably NOT best to ignore it and talk about quidditch. There are various reasons these men take that approach and think it's the best option. However, some people need their friends to just sit with them and acknowledge how crappy the situation is even if they can't do anything about it.
“Look, I really don’t want to talk about Burke,” Harry said tensely. He didn’t want Burke to take up any more space in his life. It was bad enough that he couldn’t get away from the heavy and hot feeling of the man’s soul. “Whatever Hale said about him, was probably true. Assuming the papers didn’t bungle it up, that is...”
All three of the dementors then turned away from Harry and continued down the hall. The sound of a door opening indicated that they were leaving but it took a while for the mood to get lighter and truly indicate that they were gone. Despite not feeling the full effects of the dementors’ presence, Harry desperately wanted chocolate. He doubted it would be provided when lunch showed up.
“No, I can’t. You’ll hate me. Everyone will. I can’t ever tell anyone,” Harry despaired. His eyes watered and a few tears spilled out before he could stop them or turn away from Draco.
“Just don’t use it on anyone who is pregnant as it might induce labour,” warned Rabastan Lestrange after Lucius confirmed that Harry had the proper stance and wand movement. “Unless that’s the outcome you’re hoping for.”
Lucius sprouted off some Shakespearean-sounding insults, to which Crabbe moaned “I don’t even know what that means.” It set off the other men to suggest their favourite slurs to help improve Lucius’ name-calling skills. Privately, Harry rather liked Lucius’ suggestions and made a mental note to call someone a ‘bawdy growth’, a ‘clump of foul larvae’, or an ‘ill-bred merrow’ at some point in the future.
Harry nodded and stepped back from Draco. He held his breath as Draco positioned himself with plenty of space directly in front of him. For something that had taken years of study, the spell was rather simple.
It was harder than he imagined convincing Hermione to allow him to meet Ginny. She knew the risk, and thought Harry was stupid for even considering it. She also understood the desire behind it. Not the horcrux part, but the desire to be with the people you loved. Ultimately, she conceded and helped him arrange their meeting.
Harry sighed and tried to think of a completely different idea. Unfortunately, for every lowkey romantic idea that popped into his head, Harry was able to imagine how Draco could misinterpret Harry’s intentions. Lucius had seemed pleased by the brush and mirror, but that had been in Azkaban. Any gift was probably welcomed just for the novelty of having something pleasant around. Harry wished he could ask Lucius for advice.
Harry was a little horrified to see that Malfoy seemed to be on the verge of crying. It was ten thousand times worse than being faced with a crying Cho. Harry could not think of a single thing to say. The man had appeared cold and distant in the past, but it was clear that he loved his son. Harry recalled the numerous times Draco had indignantly proclaimed he would tell his father about any sleight. Harry had the epiphany that Dumbledore was wrong. Lucius Malfoy has been fighting his son’s battles for years. The man would probably gladly stand in front of even Voldemort if he though he could shelter Draco from further harm. Being stuck in Azkaban, unable to help his son, was probably a fate worst than any pain Voldemort could dish out for his previous failures.
When Harry sat in the chair, the magical chains swung up and encircled him. It was decidedly uncomfortable, but Hale’s presence at his side prevented Harry from having a panic attack.
?” Ginny questioned. Harry shrugged. Ron and Hermione would likely catch her up on his feeling about the prisoners later.
Harry easily changed Albert’s meal as well. The man was just as grateful and quickly ate his meal with previously unseen gusto. Harry was unable to fully modify the other prisoners’ meals as their trays would not fit through the bars except for where they placed them when finished. He was able to change the taste of their bread if they held it out for him.
Fortunately, the guards were merely handing out dinner and not there specifically for Harry again. Once they got to Harry’s cell, he refused the food. One look at Wiblin holding the food tray caused Harry to lose what little appetite he had.
“Wasn’t your fault,” Albert groaned. Harry was surprised the man could read the guilt on Harry’s countenance, given the swelling around his eyes.
Of course, there was also a downside to Lucius having a clear view of Harry. The man had taken to squeezing in etiquette lessons. So far, he mostly nagged Harry about his posture. He was constantly reminding him to sit straight or stand a certain way when casting spells. Harry wouldn’t admit it, but the wand movements did feel more natural when he stood the way Lucius suggested. This was the reason he entertained Lucius in what Ron would have called ‘high society bullshit’.
“I think it will help you,” pressed Nott. “Scrimgeour was worried. Those rumours he spoke about – well, I’d bet they was lots of talk against the ministry for arresting the chosen one. This will further gather support for you and against the ministry. And shine a light on the corruption you spoke about.”
“Dementors,” Malfoy explained, not that he needed to. By now, Harry was aware of what dementors felt like. As the sound of his mother’s voice started ringing in his head, Harry tried to huddle on his bed without looking like he was huddling. It seemed unlikely that the other men would notice due to their own proximity to the dementors but he remembered all too clearly the teasing Draco Malfoy and his cronies gave him in third year. Without his wand available to cast a patronus, Harry suddenly felt like he was in third year all over again. Completely helpless against the dementors and his worst memories.
,” Harry attempted to imitate Draco on those last few lines. He internally cringed immediately after and hoped Draco didn’t take it as an insult. Harry was temporarily relieved when Draco offered a small smile, but it faded quickly. Harry wanted to say something as Draco looked so sad, but he didn’t know what would make it better. Everyone knew exactly how bleak Azkaban was. The little bits of comfort to be found would seem small outside of the prison. An uncomfortable silence fell upon them.
There was comfort in knowing someone could see Harry’s darker side, at least a portion of it, and not be disgusted by him. As far as Draco knew, he didn’t think it was so bad that he had to fix Harry. Everyone else seemed to be waiting for Harry to snap out of his funk, but Draco thought who Harry was at the moment was good enough.
can do,” Draco eventually said. He stiffly walked back and forth in front of the room of requirement.
Once they got to the locker rooms, Lucius moved close to help. They hit a snag when Albert tried to undress. He couldn’t remove his shirt without considerable pain. Eventually one of the guards stepped in and cut the shirt from his body. Harry briefly hoped the guard would also heal Albert, but he didn’t.
“I’ll arrange it during my next meeting,” promised Nott. Harry nodded and felt a weight being lifted from his shoulders. It wasn’t much. It might not even help. But it was a plan. A step forward. Even surrounded by concrete walls, Harry suddenly felt a little less trapped.
Harry spent a significant amount of time nitpicking at the design, but actually was happy with his creation by the time he finally set it down. He started to prepare for making a matching brush, but hesitated. Considering the lifestyle his parents had been able to provide, Draco likely had no shortage of beautiful knickknacks. Harry’s mirror was probably equivalent to a preschooler’s drawing compared to the mirrors Draco could purchase from high end boutiques. Harry sat back with a groan and reconsidered his gift.
Conversations sprung up around Harry, but they were soft enough that they were mostly background noise. Harry appreciated it as he could eavesdrop from one conversation to another instead of being alone with his own thoughts. Crabbe, Nott and Avery were talking about the first meal they wanted to have once they got out of Azkaban. As far as Harry could tell, only Nott was trying to appeal his sentence, but it didn’t stop the others from reminiscing about the days when their meals contained variety and flavour.
“Not you,” Harry said and cringed when he noted his voice kind of sounded like a dementor’s. There was a raspy, rattling quality to it.
“Wouldn’t that be a shame? I can see it now. The headlines reporting the tragic tale of Potter getting kissed in an escape attempt. And just when Dumbledore was about to rescue him too. Such a shame it would be,” Burke mocked and leaned against Harry’s bars. Harry wanted to call Burke’s bluff but the truth was he didn’t know if the man was bluffing or not. So far, Harry hadn’t seen anything in Burke’s character that would suggested he wouldn’t let a dementor kiss one of the prisoners.
“What do you mean? I never tried to get your attention. Before this,” Harry waved his hand between them in a vague manner that was meant to encompass his whole Azkaban experience, “I would have been quite happy to never come across one of you again. No offense.”
“That actually might be better. Less chance of having people stick around and eavesdrop,” Hale mused. He said he’d follow up with a letter for the day and time, but he imagined his reporter friend would be eager to meet Harry as soon as possible. Harry agreed and once again thanked Hale for the list he’d given.
“Yes. I don’t know how much he knows about Draco’s task,” Harry stated. Although he couldn’t see Crabbe’s face, Harry thought he heard the same fatherly concern that Malfoy had been expressing.
far. We’re cleaned up before our judicial-wizards or any high-up ministry workers see us. So, it isn’t obvious to anyone not in the building. Though I doubt the public outcry would be too loud in defense of prisoners anyway,” Lucius said.
“Bradley, I have him. Would you mind getting the door?” Perkins prompted, causing Bradley to reluctantly lower his wand and exit the carriage.
“I know it is a lot to ask, but I was hoping you could discreetly give this to Reginald Hale the next time you meet. I am hoping he is willing to mail it to Draco,” Lucius said.
would have been. He hoped the Slytherins assumed it referenced their fathers’ feelings towards them.
Supper in the great hall was as awkward as Harry expected. It was a good thing Dean and Seamus had found them in the dorms and asked their questions then, as they provided more of a buffer between Harry and the other students who wanted to ask him intrusive questions. Being surrounded by Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Dean and Seamus kept the rest of his nosy housemates away. Occasionally someone would ask a question as they passed by, and a few yelled their questions from their seat, but after Ron implied he’d use his prefect status against them if they didn’t piss off, the other students generally gave up asking him questions. It didn’t stop them from staring and gossiping about him. He caught at least five students openly gawking at his tattoo.
“Yes,” Harry said and got lost in the memory of how it felt. “It was easy. Too easy to just guide someone’s soul out,” Harry said as he remembered the rush he felt as he did it. The memory of coaxing Burke’s soul from his body was tied to an almost euphoric relief that he had stopped the man from hurting him. Harry wasn’t sure he would be able to convince himself that he ought to feel remorse. Harry was confident that if he had to do it again, he would still pull out Burke’s soul to stop him. The only downside was what came after. “I don’t think I should have eaten it though,” Harry admitted.
Harry had hoped to use the time Ron and Hermione were busy with prefect duties to work with Nott on the mirrors. That plan was disrupted when Ginny and Luna slid into Ron and Hermione’s vacated seats. He was somewhat mollified by their interruption when he caught Nott’s expression when Luna pulled out a quill that had one of her radish earrings attached to it.
“So, it’s not a Death Eater plot?” Harry asked. There was silence and Harry immediately regretted asking. He wasn’t ruling out the possibility that this was somehow Voldemort’s plan to make him miserable and get him out of the way. But the question also reminded him and the men around him that they were on different sides of this war.
“There are two things you need to sign, but you could do so later and mail them to me. I mostly came to talk about your plans for improving Azkaban, and to see if you would be willing to testify on Albert’s behalf,” Hale explained.
“Do you think they’ll actually listen?” asked Harry. Scrimgeour hadn’t been keen when Harry suggested similar measures for the ministry itself. It seemed unlikely he’d like it any better for the prison.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked. He brought his own empty tray to the slot in his cell. Glancing at Malfoy for confirmation, Harry then tapped the bar and watched his tray disappear.
Harry was trying to think of a response that wouldn’t incriminate him but also let them know he was crap at that particular spell. Surely the fact that it had barely worked should cut him some slack. Before he could think of a way to phrase it, the sound of doors opening at both ends of the hallways were heard. Suddenly the already cold air turned frigid. Both Malfoy and Albert back up in their cells.
“Fucking Jugson distracting us during the only time we get any warmth,” Lucius grumbled. Harry figured the man must be upset if he was resorting to crude swear words instead of the more Shakespearean ones he claimed signified his cleverness. Despite Lucius pointing the finger at Jugson, Harry knew his own reluctance to undress was what really delayed them.
“Go to bed,” Harry suggested to the tired death eaters. As usual it was a struggle to convince them, but Harry argued that they could help him more if they were fully rested. Or as rested as Azkaban would allow. Harry wished that he was able to sleep, but he hadn’t felt
Harry gently took Albert’s hand and placed it on his upper arm. He had initially tried to bring Albert’s hand to his shoulder, but the man hissed in pain before he could raise his arm too high. It would have been better to allow the man to lean against his side, but the guards would not let them walk side-by-side. This was the best Harry could offer as they moved single file.
Harry had expected Lucius Malfoy’s mocking face to greet him, looking much like his son had in third year. Instead an even nastier surprise was waiting for him.
“Hands against the wall,” Burke instructed. When Harry was in position, he heard his cell door unlock. Burke was quickly at his side, and manhandling his hands behind his back. Harry’s face smacked into the wall. His glasses were pushed up but fortunately didn’t break.
“James can take your name. Well, perhaps hyphenate it,” Harry amended. He didn’t grow up with the same pride about his heritage that Draco was raised with, but continuing on the Potter name seemed like a good way to honor his father. “That is, if you aren’t concerned about James’... purity,” Harry directed the last part to Lucius. He suspected that even if Lucius deemed James’ muggle ancestors were sufficiently far back enough not to pollute his magical inheritance or some other such rot, the Weasley blood was not. They might have been pureblood, but Lucius would not see Weasley genetics suitable for any Malfoy heirs.
After that Harry strove to make James laugh frequently as he tried to see what Mr. Weasley saw. But he couldn’t. Harry concluded that, like with the faint freckles he thought he saw, Mr. Weasley was only seeing what he wanted to see.
“Could you get Crabbe too?” Harry asked as she marched away. She held up her middle finger in response and continued to walk away.
To Harry it sounded like the laws were in place to keep the prisoners down. Before becoming one himself, he might not have cared or possibly excused it as justifiable as criminals were suffering for their crimes. After living through it, Harry realized how broken the system was. Frankly, he didn’t understand why he was punished but Burke had free reign to do as he pleased. What Burke had just done to Albert seemed worse than Harry’s one second mistake, especially since Burke had planned it out and done similar acts before. It didn’t make sense how Burke’s violence was tolerated and almost protected under the law.
“Are you sure it was a horcrux?” Lucius asked faintly. Apparently the man had not realized exactly how valuable the diary was.
The common room was empty, which didn’t surprise Harry given the hour. He went to the chairs he and his friends usually occupied, and spent the rest of the night reviewing Hermione’s notes and practicing the spells. He was mainly concerned about performing the magic using his wand. He attempted to scale back on how much power and intend he channeled when casting. It wasn’t something Harry had paid attention to before Azkaban, so he couldn’t compare his spell work now to how he preformed before. He could only hope none of his professors or classmates had paid much attention either.
“You stupid... thinking you... so fucking... no one would care... work that way... I have you... whatever I... nothing you... me,” Harry couldn’t fully understand whatever Burke was spewing at him. His vision was getting darker the longer he couldn’t pull in a breath. He feared he was about to die but didn’t have the strength to stop it.
“What? Why would Ginny put your horcrux in a new vessel, her son no less, when you weren’t even dead?” Draco asked.
Mr. Runecraft turned towards Harry and asked, “Do you deny casting the unforgivable curse?” His words sounded innocent enough but Harry felt a touch of maliciousness it in.
“Er, he insisted I learn proper posture and some politics. That was exactly as boring as it sounds,” Harry said and was glad when Ron immediately commiserated with him. However, Hermione wasn’t distracted and took to quizzing Harry about various subjects. When she was done, she stated she was satisfied that the Death Eaters hadn’t purposely misinformed him.
“You are a rather odd puzzle,” Asherath continued. “Able to contain a portion of a soul without consuming it. It seemed like a waste, but still fascinating.”
“I’m sure... Perhaps Potter knows then,” Burke threatened as he drew his attention away from the injured man and focused on Harry once more. Harry drew in a fortifying breath as he held the man’s full attention once more. Whatever satisfaction Burke had gotten from seeing Albert in pain slid off his face as he moved towards Harry’s cell.
Harry forced himself to eat the meal and then morosely lounged on his cot. Despite the meal rousing the other prisoners, few seemed sociable at the moment. It didn’t help that almost immediately after lunch, Harry could hear Crabbe defecating. The smell trailed into Harry’s cell confirming his fears that when he could no longer hold in his own bowel movements, not only would Malfoy and Nott be privy to the view, the prisoners closest to him would likely be informed by smell and sound. It was not something Harry looked forward to.
It was clear that he was expected to line up with the other men in the hallway, so he filed in between Lucius and Nott. Nott gave Harry’s shoulders a squeeze, and it reminded him of Sirius’ preferred form of affection. It calmed Harry as he was beginning to believe that they wouldn’t harm him even though they could reach him now. Burke narrowed his eyes as he observed them. He too came to the same conclusion as Harry, though he was less happy about it.
Harry once again felt conflicted. It was fundamentally wrong to use up someone’s soul, but Harry felt like he couldn’t avoid it at this point. Even if he could stomach giving up magic, there would be no guarantee that the deterioration of Burke’s soul would stop.
Once everyone arrived, they started by having Harry go through the formalities.  He dutifully stated his name, age, and that he understood what he was on trial for.
It only took a few questions for Harry to get the general sense of what Hale was trying to tease out. The man focused on getting Harry to describe whether the Death Eaters had been aggressive or reluctant. He asked whether Harry recalled anyone trying to minimize the damage.
“You’d best get back to your job. At least while you still have one. You know, since my friend, the minister, is unhappy with you,” it was an empty threat, but Harry was satisfied that Burke actually looked worried for a moment.
The others tried to brainstorm options, but none had suggestions that were feasible and many were deemed too risky. Harry couldn’t vomit the soul. It was probably dangerous to try to coax the soul out as they couldn’t be sure they wouldn’t coax Harry’s soul instead/as well. The prisoners found themselves restricted as they couldn’t access their personal libraries and do some research. In the end, Harry resolved to ask Asherath if the guards let him return when they believed he was the one that ate their co-worker.
Nott snorted and said “Burke’s idea of a perk is just an extra serving of that crap they call a meal around here. It’s hardly worth the trouble you’ll face.”
Perkins lead him towards a shoddy dock. The wood was uneven and creaked as they stepped on it, but ultimately held their weight. The boat docked and Bradley greeted the men on it with a show of affection that had been absent from the man so far.
“I’m going to look into soul magic. I think there may be a few books in the family library, but I doubt they cover something as advanced as horcruxes. The only soul magic I can think of off the top of my head are rituals to communicate with dead ancestors, or old-fashioned marriage ceremonies that
The auror took two steps towards Harry before Dumbledore’s voice rang across the hall causing the auror to pause momentarily.
“Don’t worry, Potter,” said Mulciber as he saddled up to them, thankfully fully dressed. “We know you got hair where it counts,” even though he ruffled the hair on Harry’s head, it was clear he was referring to something else.
“Deserved or not, she would fight back,” warned Lestrange. Harry realized that the man was genuinely trying to warn Harry off. Harry wasn’t sure if he should feel flattered or horrified that that the man thought he was going to go out and start using dark curses.
Having spent the year perfecting his ability to spot Draco’s name on the map, it did not take long for Harry to find him. He, Parkinson, and Zabini were currently outside, but making their way back towards the school. If Harry moved quickly he would be able to catch them before they reached their common room or the library. He hoped they weren’t headed towards the Great Hall as there would be no way to speak to Draco privately there.
“I think I figured out how to connect two mirrors if they were side-by-side, but it doesn’t work with one mirror being so far away,” Harry explained.
“No need. Perhaps you’re right after all and there isn’t a need for a formal sit-down. I shouldn’t take too much of Harry’s time. But perhaps, Harry, you’ll humour me and walk with me to the gates,” Hale said.
Harry counted four guards. They were all watching the prisoners carefully, wands at the ready. As Harry neared the end of the hallway, he noticed a couple of dementors near by. They were prevented from reaching the prisoners due to Wiblin’s Patronus. Harry deducted that the presence of the dementors was what prevented the prisoners from attempting to overpower the guards with their higher numbers.
“I think you have left the man in pain long enough. I will take my pictures immediately, so that he can be healed. I will then continue my meeting with Mr. Potter. Once that is concluded, I will meet with Mr. Nott,” Hale countered. Harry admired the sheer confidence the man had. The guard looked as if he was going to deny Hale’s request, but he must have heard the ‘or else’ warning in Hale’s tone.
She grinned and kissed him. Harry relaxed and marveled at how lucky he was. Ginny was amazing; far too good for him, but somehow loved him all the same.
“No one?” asked Malfoy. He pointedly raised his eyebrows. Harry immediately thought of Umbridge. When he pushed the thought of her away, it was thoughts of getting revenge on Snape that took its place. Almost immediately afterwards thoughts of cursing Voldemort, Wormtail and the Dursleys all popped into his head. Perhaps there were a few people he might want to hurt…
“You’re in good health,” the medi-witch declared, kind despite Harry’s near interrogation. “However, we want to keep you here for observation. We’re not sure why you were in a coma to begin with. Several eyewitnesses said you’d been hit with the killing curse. You’re now the Boy Who Lived Twice,” she said. She’d tried to say the last part with humour, but Harry just cringed at his new moniker.
“Really? You’re going with innuendo? Your mum is going to ask me to describe this moment in detail; what am I supposed to tell her?” Harry asked.
“Would you think me a hypocrite and get angry if I say it isn’t your fault?” Harry asked. As far as Harry was concerned, the only one who bore the blame for Tonks and Remus was Bellatrix, the one who killed them.
“Yes, well,” Scrimgeour made a visible effort to pull himself together. “It’s a story of personal growth. You can still stand alongside the ministry helping us while we help you. My offer to introduce you to the auror department still stands. We can still arrange it so that you have a bright future as an auror.”
not really. Harry recalled the sense of rightness he’d felt when he was first given the child. Ginny didn’t destroy his horcrux, because the baby was its new vessel.
“Shut it, Potter, I’ll deal with you next,” Burke promised. He spelled Albert’s cell door open and stepped over to the prisoner. Burke pushed Albert into the wall before spelling the man’s hands to lock behind his back.
“I know. I just want to give it enough time for everyone to find something else to talk about than my stay in Azkaban,” Harry said, even though he privately thought avoiding the great hall permanently was a fantastic idea.
Having caught on to the fact that once Harry was in his cell, Perkins would leave but Burke would remain, Harry decided to try not getting on Burke’s bad side. He needed to survive this long enough for Dumbledore to get him out of this mess. It would be easier if Burke didn’t hate him. Even better if he could go unnoticed. Perhaps it wouldn’t be any worse than his summers trapped at the Dursleys.
“I was angry at the time. Maybe that’s why it worked?” Harry proposed. He didn’t want to think about being a natural at such a dark curse.
“Potentially useful,” interrupted Ishanders as he disagreed on how handy this ability was. “If we can harness this skill, we can keep a portion of our meals for when we are in dire need,” Ishanders theorized. It sounded like an old debate between the two, but Harry barely followed their conversation at this point. His mind was busy going over all of the lessons he had with Dumbledore throughout the year.
“Great,” he said morosely. He opened his mouth a few times as he attempted to add something to that, but nothing came out. A small blush started when he saw that Draco was staring at his mouth, noting Harry’s struggle.
The great hall grew quiet. Those that had not noticed the ministry employees enter the hall were suddenly notified not only of their presence but also their reason for being there. The students alternated watching the aurors and Harry, who had frozen a few feet from the Gryffindor table.  He stood near Ron and Hermione who had been leaving the hall with him.
“Harry?” Lucius prompted once the other prisoners recovered from the effects of the dementors’ presence.
If it couldn’t be Hermione, and he had no idea where Ron was, the person he’d trust the most to keep the ring safe was Ginny. It would be risky since she was at school with Death Eaters, but he knew she’d do her best to protect it. Besides, she was one of the few people who had experience with horcruxes and would know how serious and dangerous the ring could be. Certainly, she’d take precautions.
Harry blinked a couple of times as he was thoroughly confused. “I didn’t,” he said slowly and wondered if he somehow managed to halt the deterioration subconsciously. “I’ve been using Burke to power my magic almost non-stop since it happened.”
“She didn’t mean to,” Mrs. Weasley said with another quiver in her voice. Harry barely heard her explanation of how sometimes a witch’s power lashed out during a particularly painful and problematic delivery. Mrs. Weasley went on to say Ginny would have never intentionally destroyed the ring, but Harry wasn’t mad. He didn’t blame Ginny for destroying his horcrux. She
“What did you tell him?” ask Hale. Harry glanced at him nervously. He knew he was off script and that Hale wasn't prepared for whatever Harry was about to say. Harry debated if he should move forward or back out. He hadn’t come to the trial expecting to mention the Dursleys. Harry knew he could use it as an example of ‘acceptable’ anger and hatred spoken about muggles, but he didn't know how much that would actually help Albert. It didn’t directly relate to the Death Eater charges.
“No, if I tell anyone... I think it has to be you. I can’t tell anyone else. Ron and Hermione wouldn’t speak to me anymore. I can tell you, but I don’t want to lose you,” Harry tried to explain.
“The ministry takes these types of crimes seriously. Potter must be held accountable for his actions,” Runecraft stated as Harry was guided towards them.
“Keep it,” Harry replied. He thought himself a fool for hoping he actually had a chance with Draco. He knew it was just a grand delusion on his part. As Goyle proved, they all knew about Burke, and Harry couldn’t fathom any reason that Draco would want him after that. Still, he wanted to do something for Draco, even if a silly box was a poor gesture.
“Even mum’s alright with it. Well, she’s not pleased that you’ve chosen a Malfoy, but he’s good with James. That counts for a lot with her,” Ron told him.
When the class began to work on the practical part of the lesson, Snape didn’t bother checking in with Harry like his other professors had. The man was content to let Harry figure out how he’d catch up on the spells and theories he’d missed. It seemed like Snape was prepared to spend the rest of the class pretending Harry hadn’t rejoined them. Therefore, it was all the more surprising when Snape approached Harry from behind and suddenly reached for Harry’s wand hand.
“Our next family trip,” Draco immediately suggested as he’d already considered it. “There are experts in countries that do allow soul magic that I could consult with. I’m sure they’d be willing to help.”
Ron and Hermione traded looks, both noting the ‘we’ Harry had used. Ron shifted uneasily as he didn’t want to advocate for harsh punishments when it was his best mate that suffered through them.
“It’s easy to spiral,” he said after a pause. “I don’t know how Sirius did it for twelve years,” he added quietly. Especially since Sirius had been alone, without the support system Harry had.
“Back to work,” Snape snapped. The other students went back to practicing their spellwork, but their attention remained primarily on Snape or Harry.
“You can always arrange to pay him back once you’re able to get to your funds,” Hale suggested. Harry nodded but dwelled on the fact that Albert had paid for his clearly expensive judicial-wizard.
“It was brave of you to do what was right even when forced into a terrible situation,” Dumbledore eventually stated. Harry snorted.
“Right...” Harry said and fell silent. Ginny placed her hand on his arm, not rushing him, but reminding him she was there for him.
Harry told them about the strange events that had been happening all year. He felt awkward accusing Draco of Katie’s predicament to his father, but he forged on. A few of the other prisoners snorted in amusement when Harry mentioned Ron had accidentally consumed a love potion meant for Harry, but Malfoy seemed as tense as ever throughout the whole conversation. Harry thought it was an odd twist of fate that despite his strong accusations all year, Harry was parroting some of Hermione’s arguments about how Harry could be wrong about Malfoy. Harry himself didn’t believe but he found himself wanting to comfort Malfoy.
“This way,” Burke started leading him down the right hallway. But they stopped about half-way through the hallway at a door marked ‘Block D’. Harry wasn’t sure what happened to Block C but it was clear Burke plans to bypass that entirely.
“It’s not,” Harry quickly reassured. “Umm, Lucius maybe you could tell him something only you would know?” he suggested. “I’ll give you both some privacy,” Harry added in case Draco thought Harry was angling for them to reveal some Malfoy family secrets. “And I can explain more later, if you want.”
The aurors ushered Harry into a carriage once they got to the shore. It was a déjà vu of how Harry arrived at Azkaban, but at least this time he had Hale with him.
Harry looked towards Malfoy and Nott. It was insane to count on them for support but Harry didn’t know what Lestrange was trying to accomplish.
Malfoy and Mulciber were running through a list of spells. When one of the Lestrange brothers jumped in to suggest some sort of anti-clotting spell, Lucius snidely remarked that it was rather advanced and thus not likely to be part of the sixth-year curriculum. Harry realized they were planning more spells to review with him. It brought tears to his eyes again, though this time for a happier reason.
It was a bittersweet find, but Harry was glad to have it. He kept it safe, but in light of the horcrux hunt, it ultimately slipped his mind. At least until they’d been attacked.
“It sounds like a horcrux,” Lestrange answered honestly. Even though it was the conclusion Harry had come to, it hurt to have it confirmed by the others. Especially from men who were well-versed in dark arts and thus more likely to know for sure.
“Harry… shouldn’t we finish the outline since your meeting is now set for tomorrow?” Hermione said. She wanted to encourage Nott to leave but didn’t want to be overtly rude about it.
“Wait, you don’t think Moody uses his eye to watch people walk around naked all day, do you?” Harry suddenly couldn’t help but wonder if the man ever took a peak at him. Or Crouch Jr, who impersonated Moody.
“Some,” said the man defensively. Rather than argue, Malfoy just agreed that it could be added to the plans. None of the men suggested divination, which suited Harry just fine. They also did not suggest muggle studies, but Harry figured he knew more about that than any of them. Perhaps he’d offer to teach it to
“Help,” Harry whispered roughly. “Get... im... off...” Harry tried to plead even though it hurt to talk.
The door at the end of the hall opened a second time, but Harry was busy poking at the mystery meat, so he didn’t register the significance until Burke leaned against the bars of his cell and spoke.
I didn’t want to go through writing up a long trial, so I made Hale do most of the legwork offscreen... mostly because Harry technically is guilty so it would be tricky to work around that. My vague justification for his release is that Hale managed to cast so much doubt on the ministry that it questioned the authenticity of their proof that Harry was guilty. Because the trial went on without Harry present, Hale was able to pick and choose parts of Harry’s testimony that never openly admitted his guilt. So, just imagine Hale being a badass putting the ministry in their place while painting Harry as the wizarding world’s angel despite his crime.
“Who knew Harry was secretly a genius?” Theo asked. He let Draco take Harry’s notes and calculations.
“Certainly not,” Parkinson said and protectively stepped in front of Draco. Harry blinked at her in surprise.
“It’s really not a trick or anything,” Harry said and directed it towards Draco. Despite Parkinson’s protective stance, Harry was easily able to make eye contact with Draco.
“You know they’re watching you,” Harry felt he had to try to stop this. “Whatever you have planned won’t go over well when-”
