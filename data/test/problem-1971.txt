He grabbed his wand from the table, turned it on the door, and, in a tone of relief, said,
, he thought.
“This is it. I’d better go—black shoes, right?”
“In Slytherin?” Ron yelled, and launched to his feet as well. “Yes, they did, or at the very least they didn’t fight it. Ask Harry! He could have been with them, but he said no, and so he was in Gryffindor. With us. On the
Pansy clutched reassuringly at his hand again, and he knew she was silently telling him to calm down. They were both waiting, waiting for a certain dark head to duck into the Hall and sit at the Gryffindor table.
“God,” Malfoy gasped. “God, I’m going to… I have to…”
He grinned. “No need to be jealous, Gin’s as gay as we are.”
“Do you still…” Harry’s throat tightened. The age old instinct to provoke Malfoy was warring with this new, powerful urge to dip his head and please him. He tried to go for a pleasantly neutral tone, something sick churning in his gut.
Fingers on his buckle, but Harry didn’t pause as he mirrored Malfoy’s actions, both of them unzipping the other, breaths huffing into each others mouths as they kissed fiercely, hotly. They stepped out of their trousers, breaking away from one another, and Harry’s struggle with the skinnies made Malfoy snort. Harry flipped him an entirely unconvincing middle finger, but Malfoy’s red lips were irrepressibly happy, smug, bitten raw. Harry was not charmed.
Draco blinked.
“Look, Malfoy, it’s my potion too, and if you—”
It was late, and the fire in his dormitory was dying again. Draco levelled his wand at it irritatedly, and gave it a flick. The flames pulsed up again, fire crackling pleasantly as it re- ignited, and Draco felt warmth start to spread out towards him, softening his posture even further as he slumped down onto his elbows.
“I think we’ll kick off with some light group practical work, seeing as this is only our second class, and we spent the first one doing admin, really, didn’t we?” Flitwick chuckled lightly, and a ripple of agreement went through the class of six.
Potter looked half- relieved, half- sobered.
Draco had grabbed his wand, wood slick under his scrabbling fingers, and looped an eager cursive reply, lyrics flowing out of him as easy as breathing, like just turning a tap on and allowing words to stream out.
“—definitely pissed with me,” Potter was saying, a touch of anxiety colouring his tone. “I’ve been avoiding him since, and then in the dorm… you saw how he was.”
And Draco would have sworn at him, or flipped him off, but there was something in Weasley’s tone that made him raise his head slowly, eyes red- rimmed from all the mist, which was making the whole class tear up a bit.
It was bad enough he was this tired, but he was damn hungry, too, and there was no way he could eat a bite before Potter came in and they could enact the first step of the Plan. Draco’s Plan.
“Our waitress wants to sleep with you. Luckily, she’s not yet under the impression you want to sleep with
Even now, Draco thought half- amusedly, fortified by a large breakfast, he found it difficult to resist the pull. His mouth watered slightly, and he swallowed hard, determined to think of something else. It would be completely mortifying if Potter arrived and he was drooling onto the stone flags.
Theo turned jerkily, walking speedily to the door and darting through it without looking back. Draco continued getting dressed with a shake of his head.
It had been like this for a while now.
Potter did not say a word, hand frozen mid- air, and his face was galvanised by an emotion so akin to humiliation Draco thought he might get up and just leave right there. But then, with a desperate neediness that made him turned him on unbelievably, Potter brought his other hand up to cover Draco’s wrist, squeezing it hopelessly, fingers stroking over the light hairs on his arm and nails grazing his skin. Draco’s breath caught.
Draco, unwilling to stay in Malfoy Manor, had rented a little apartment in London with a small fraction of the contents of the Malfoy vault, and tried to be normal for the few weeks that needed to expire before he could return to Hogwarts. One evening in the small dark bookstore he’d taken to haunting, that song had come on. He’d never paid any particular attention to the music playing before, but this song- it had arrested him where he was walking, running a finger over the worn spines of the books. He’d stayed frozen until the last notes faded, the thin flexible voice had died away. After that, he’d made the little old shopkeeper play it every time he came, at least once, until he knew each word by heart. Lost in thought, Draco remembered the smell of the old paper, wax and dust mites and sunshine dancing in the musty air to the sound of that unnamed Muggle singer, who had captured Draco more successfully than any magic had before. On an impulse, Draco seized his wand from where it was lying in a little nook on the shower wall, and, with careful intent, started to scratch words onto the shower wall. Scrawling black script, in his own Malfoy- taught cursive- the first two lines from the song.
Draco drew in a shuddering breath, looking up to the ceiling for a second and trying to gather himself. The glow of the floating candles above them flickered in his vision, comforting; he squeezed Pansy’s hand once, tight, and rose to his feet just as Potter slid into his seat, beside the Weaslette.
There was a pause.
“What, Pansy, fuck’s sake- spit it out!”
Draco pushed his hair back with a careless hand, suddenly remembering its un-gelled state. He cringed; everyone had seen it. Draco looked up surreptitiously, trying to see if anyone was looking at the state of his hair. He cast his gaze over the Great Hall, but there was only the chatter of students, the emphatic bites of the ever- hungry adolescent. No eyes looked towards Draco Malfoy. And then- out of Draco’s peripheral vision- he sensed somebody watching. Draco flicked his eyes over to the right, and caught a flash of green irises as a dark head was hurriedly bent towards its plate, eyes averted. Draco leant in with a stab of something he couldn’t identify piercing his lungs.
Blaise mmphed indignantly. “’Scuse me? I’ll have you know my eating habits have often been described as—" he swallowed thickly, “— erotically deliberate and affecting.” He dropped his spoon reluctantly to dab at a corner of his lips with his napkin.
With a shaky inhale, he drew himself up, straightened his robes subtly, and started to explain.
Pansy gave him a doubtful look. “I don’t know, Draco, the man’s just been ditched. I don’t reckon he’s paying much attention to anything around him.”
do. We’re all adults, we’re living our lives—who says we even have to acknowledge him? We went to the same school; that’s it.”
“Potter – Harry – what’re you—?"
side. He had a choice! They all do! And you’re just fucking naïve if you think—”
“M… Malfoy?” He asked weakly. “Draco Malfoy?”
,” Pansy sniffed.
Pansy giggled, but it sounded strained to Draco’s ears. He narrowed his eyes, leaning in.
Ginny buried her face in the loveseat.
Harry looked at her dubiously.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Potter said guardedly. “I myself was about to ask for the bill and leave, having been as you so kindly put it, ditched. Then you came over and proceeded to throw me back into sixth year, both conversationally and, y’know,” he quirked his lips. “Hormonally.”
“And, you know, it wouldn’t be anything official, just… well, I don’t know the word. I don’t think anyone’ll have an issue with it. Just off the books, right. But still scored. We don’t need a, like, commentator or anything. As long as it’s match conditions. We’ll have to share a, a changing room, of course,” he said, and swallowed.
Potter grinned. “Just wanted to confirm. I know you’re very protective. Not that you need to be.”
Blaise had gotten there before him; he loved watching other people, analysing and deducting, and he had a good target all ready to go.
“But then, we mustn’t forget the only exception to your admirable independence, must we? Of course, that was when your life fucking depended on it, so I s’pose you didn’t mind asking for my charity then. You remember, Malfoy? Your hand, slipping over mine, and then you yelled- do I have it right? Correct me if I’m mistaken; I would never dream of saying anything except the honest truth to you. You said,
“Draco…” he breathed in a soft voice. Draco, feverishly gasping for breath, dimly registered this as strange for somebody who barely knew him.
“What do I not understand about sacrifice, huh? What, you want to tell me how much people hate me here? How much it pains them to see me in their school? Well, I’ll tell you something,
“He gets a good morning, and I get a ten- minute lecture on the evils of laziness and misogyny in the wizarding world and how men should try a bit of domesticity for a change?”
, as such, Potter, but…” the tiny area of Ginny’s face that was visible to Harry flushed a deep, candy- apple red. “Yeah, I might be… seeing someone.”
Pansy grimaced. “February.”
Harry took a generous handful of Floo powder from the urn on the mantelpiece, stepped into the fireplace, which roared to life, and opened his hand so the powder fell in a thick flurry onto the emerald flames.
“Sure you were, Weaselbee,” Draco said easily, slinging his bag over his shoulder. “Sure you were.”
“Come along, Golden Boy,” he muttered teasingly, leading him from the room.
“What d’you think, Harry?”
But Draco’s gaze was pinned on the mop of dark hair spread over a snow- white pillow on the fifth bed down, the lean curve of a sleeping back outlined softly by thick covers. He shook Zabini’s hand off absently, distractedly. The boy beside him was not his main concern. Without even looking around for Madam Pomfrey, who would butcher them if she found them disturbing Potter, he walked slowly over to the bed where he was sleeping, footsteps sure and soft. From where he was standing, only the clean outline of Potter’s nose and lashes were visible, his hair impossibly soft and wild over most of his face, cast into gold- black shadow as it was by the dappled sunrays streaming in from the enormous window over his head.
Right. Playing with Potter.
Blaise rolled his eyes heavily. “
She blushed, and Pansy looked at Draco. He knew they were thinking the same thing; Blaise could easily have turned on the same level of charm, dimple and all, to poor old Mrs Finchman.
He took a deep breath.
“You’ve lost your wits since we were kids, Malfoy,” Potter smirked, smile stretching to become fully fledged and beautiful. Draco watched it blossom and felt like screaming.
Thoughts?
“Right. I forgot.” Potter stared right back at him. There was a certain passion alive in his eyes--
Okay, he could do this. Snark. Witticisms. Dirty humour. This was his forte, his playground, his birthright, if you will.
He must have said that out loud.
Just as Draco was nearing the front of the hall, about to turn right and head straight for the Slytherin table, something wet and slimy hit his left cheek. Draco stopped dead. Shocked, he put a hand to his face and looked around in confusion. An onion slice, purplish- grey and scaled like a corpse, lay mangled on the floor. Draco raked a murderous glance down the Hufflepuff table- the only possible place it could’ve come from. The closest part of the table yielded culprits. A third- year boy, sitting with a self- satisfied smirk planted right in the middle of his face. Hot anger, boiling with pent- up force, ripped down Draco’s spine. He gripped his wand tightly, wishing he could jinx the boy to a jelly. The little bastard had probably just done it to earn himself a bit of respect. Given that Draco had never seen him on the Quidditch pitch and Hufflepuffs were idiots as a general rule, he was sure that the kid was mediocre to the last degree. Was this what it had come to? Now Draco was like the weedy little kid mediocre children bullied when they were six or seven, just because it was cool?
“Yeah,” Blaise never missed a beat, cheekbones only further enhanced by the attractively mocking smile he was sporting. “You said we couldn’t take the piss because your dating this girl-
for Salazar’s sake.
And then, as if from the depths of his subconscious, summoned from the very last dregs of his schoolboy self, came—
“The fucking
“Did it not occur to you,” Blaise said infuriatingly, “to use Alohomora?”
Harry and Ron looked at each other, grinned guiltily, and stuffed their wands in their pockets, setting their spoons down noisily.
“Then what?” Weasley demanded, doing up the final buckle on his bag. “You haven’t told me what happened to spook you, mate, and until you do I can’t help you. It’s not adding up for me, and Sea doesn’t know what to do. He’s hurt.”
“You don’t sleep. You don’t eat, at least not much. You won’t talk to me. I don’t know what you’re doing, but I can’t take it anymore, Draco. You have to confide in me. That was the whole point of this bloody thing…” Again, Theo trailed off and swallowed, looking away from him.
Harry was aghast. “It’s not a dog-wrangling workshop! You can’t just…”
Potter looked down. “I think… as long as McGonagall agrees, it’s fine. Right?”
She jerked her head towards Harry, who shrank back behind Hermione.
might accidentally spill from his mouth.
Draco interrupted, reeling. “I didn’t do this!”
Because what good could come of this, actually?
Draco gagged. “Fuck’s sake, Blaise, close your mouth. Do we have to see that?”
However, Malfoy was definitely not allowed to know that.
Harry lunged for the bed, landing on it with a ‘whump’ and narrowly missing Ron, who scrambled out of the way with a snigger. Harry sagged.
Harry nodded. “Unfortunately.”
The ginger snatched his wrist back, practically spitting wounded pride. “I
“Uh, I…” Harry was flooded, suddenly, with a cold sense of reality. He shifted, the neediness clawing at his stomach only worsening. He tried to think clearly. Home…they were going home together. He bit his lip, and with a rush, felt Malfoy shift beside him, hand palming over his crotch almost unconsciously.
her for a month and intercepted all her mail in case she was dating someone. You blocked her Floo, jinxed her so she couldn’t Apparate, and hid her broom in your wardrobe.”
Draco swallowed.
He half- didn’t want to turn around and look at Malfoy. He felt suddenly very stupid, and cold, and why would anyone want to do anything with him, Harry, in this grimy, creepy house with snooty portraits ogling them from all directions?
“Her. I’m sorry. Really. We don’t have to… but I think it would be better for you to come inside.”
Ron squeezed his eyes shut, already pale face going an alarming shade of snow- white. “Merlin’s saggy balls—”
Harry and Ginny were slung over either side of the large loveseat, perched on the arms with legs tucked into the cushy centre and heads rested comfortably on the back. Ron and Hermione were sitting lazily on the sofa, Hermione’s legs splayed wide and a hand rested on her belly. Though she was still technically sober, she’d had enough Butterbeers to satisfy even the sugar- lusting baby, and was in a blissed out state quite equal to any induced by real alcohol. The weather had started to get pleasanter about twenty minutes beforehand, and now a tentative English sun was warming the glass panes of the living room windows and streaming onto the carpet in dappled squares.
The realisation crept up on Draco like a shadow, thickening into something very real and frightening. Had everyone else known except Draco?
“I did them over the summer. Low point. The only reason the bandages are still on is because they were touched by magic when they were still raw. Muggle blade, magical concealment charms. So while they heal, they’re bandaged. Okay?”
“I mean, I understand if you don’t want this – to do this – anymore.”
Draco paused, and chose not to analyse how creepy it was that he knew that.
It was only about eleven in the morning, maybe almost half past, and three out of the four of them were drunk. Not terribly drunk, but the kind of tipsy that ruins you for productivity for the rest of the day.
“But I made a lot for you two, because I know you always enjoy it,” she continued blithely.
How dare he?
It was an effort to keep his head up on the walk over, but somehow easier than usual, with the knowledge Pansy was watching him. The small, protective slice of his heart that had covered Pansy’s ears from the sound of her parents yelling in the summer of their second year, that had tackled to the ground a boy who’d been mean to her when they were eight, didn’t let him slouch and slink into himself. He kept his back straight, shoulders insouciantly set. It was an effort, yeah. But he was doing it. He was meeting people’s eyes, staring them out, looking away without looking down, because there was a difference. And if his hands were sweaty in his trouser pockets, who had to know?
Muggle Studies was really fucking boring.
From across the large wooden table they threw themselves towards Pansy, who was already giggling and slipping out of her seat, dancing way out of their reach even as they slammed down onto the oak surface, heads hanging limply down and arms akimbo.
He glanced around at the Gryffindor team, most of whom were sitting near him. Draco looked, too. Demelza Robins looked like she was game. Alicia Spinnet, too. Jimmy Peakes wasn’t there, Ritchie Coote was so young he was practically irrelevant…
Draco nodded, mouth tight. “Yeah.”
Zabini should not be breathing near Potter.
Was it worth it? Who could say. But the only thing he knew for sure…
“Pansy?”
At twelve thirty- nine, Draco was leaning against the wall of the corridor outside Professor McGonagall’s office, trying to look casual and unbothered.
Malfoy stood in the entrance stiffly, eyes darting around the kitchen like he didn’t recognise it.
But who would write a third line? Who would know the song? Who…
Ginny’s eyes narrowed. “I’ll let that go, Granger, since you’re carrying Weasley spawn, but you might want to be careful. I’ll take any further slights out on the Golden Boy here.”
Truthfully, he’d agonised over it all day, turning it over in his mind again and again.
“Family.” Harry swallowed thickly, “Family home.”
Harry looked up. “What?”
So how could he get in there when it was practice season?
Draco wrinkled his nose. “I’m not about to give you another confused stare; you had enough of those before Charms. Just put me out of my misery, will you?”
Draco felt momentarily guilty for ruining that peace.
And he strode out of the Hall, along with the dying shrieks of Draco’s good mood.
Potter snapped. Draco saw whatever emotions that were warring in his eyes resolve, in an instant, into something hot and feral and altogether dangerous. He launched himself at Draco, grabbed his shoulders in both hands and shoved him bodily up against the fireplace, holding him there. Potter was right in his face as Draco gasped and tried to push him off. But the other boy was immovable. He stared into Draco’s eyes, pinning him with his arms and breathing hard, chest heaving. Their breaths mingled, and a soft lock of Potter’s hair fell forwards to brush Draco’s eyelashes, the touch incongruously tender. Draco watched, transfixed, as Potter licked his bottom lip, a slow swipe of tongue that rendered it shiny and red, disgustingly full.
he thought to himself.
Hermione slapped him lightly on the arm. “Ronald. Get a grip.”
“She said she was hungry, and Hermione heard,” Harry explained.
He gave her a polite nod, felt her disbelief reverberate through his head like a buzzing shock. Tried to ignore it.
Draco physically could not speak. All his energy was going into not getting an erection right there and then, and the images of Potter… open for him, were too much. It was all too much.
Weasley had the grace to look ashamed. “Sorry, Professor,” he said to the floor.
Draco swallowed. “Did you…?” He blushed, knowing he sounded utterly obvious.
There, lying in fractured little shards, were the remains of a small glass bottle, and smeared thickly on the sticky stone flags was a viscous liquid that could only be describes as pink- tinged. The red lid had rolled a bit and was lying some feet away, near where Granger and Potter were working.
“I don’t want the facts.” Zabini leaned in, and Draco resisted the urge to make a sarcastic comment about what did he want then. But Zabini wasn’t done, long fingered hands clenching on the table as though he were physically struggling not to punch Draco.
“When did you find out you liked girls, Gin?”
Slughorn examined the empty cauldrons regretfully, dark green robes billowing behind him.
Impatiently, Draco grabbed his wand and headed for the showers, ripping open the cubicle door and shutting himself inside. He couldn’t bring himself to turn the tiniest degree to the right, so that the writing would be visible. A great pulsing ball of excitement that seemed vaguely disproportionate to the situation sat like an emotional leech in his chest, draining any other thoughts. He closed his eyes, drawing in a breath, trying to calm himself down. Briefly, he wondered if it was sad that he was breathless over this. Then, with a measured step that belied his racing heart, he turned to face the wall.
“Oh…” Malfoy said, face scrunching. He looked unsure of what to say. “I’m sorry?”
Draco nodded.
Blaise shoved him lightly, and they started to playfight, jostling each other until Draco wobbled on his chair, legs screeching as he leant too far back. He grabbed the table for support, accidentally dragging it over the smooth wooden floors so it screeched loudly. The fluting music of the restaurant died down, and nearly everyone turned to face him, eyes questioning and brows raised as if to say, ‘
The corner of Zabini’s mouth flicked up, and a dimple Draco had never seen before pressed itself obscenely deep into his glossy cheek. Draco watched for a second, pleasantly surprised at the entirely different look of the other boy’s face, and then shook his head minutely, smile still fixed to his face.
Harry grinned into the large mug of hot chocolate he was slurping. “Why would anyone want a pap shot of that?” He mock- trembled. “Traumatic sight.”
“This isn’t me making some joke about it, or being a jealous prick- despite what you seem to think, Malfoy, Potter and I are not involved, neither have we ever been involved.” He raised an eyebrow archly. “Not that it’s any of your bloody business.”
Blaise had his arm, then, and they were walking away. Draco felt strangely numb, and his mouth wanted to smile forever but his head was spinning with everything, splashed over with joy  and weighted with sadness for this beautiful boy that he’d loved since always, but who was damaged for reasons that weren’t his fault.
The revelation stunned him. How had he not noticed?
And, fuck. Fuckety fuck.
But the severe cut of McGonagall’s eyebrows softened, her lips smoothing out as she said, “I’m glad you’re feeling better.”
“No. Brush your locks, give them a bit of a rumple around,
Malfoy was still staring out of the bloody window. Disproportionate hurt surged up, welling in his eyes, and he curled his hands into fists against his skinnies.
Something about him, a basic faculty that allowed him to deflect and raise his eyebrows and tell guys he wasn’t interested, had rusted over. He could only stumble weakly into a waiting cab—even as experienced wizards, they were far too drunk to Apparate—and press his face into the smooth column of Malfoy’s neck.
“In love.” Zabini grimaced, faint disdain etching a line onto his forehead. “They’re all close, obviously, but those two were – by accident, of course - entirely absorbed in each other.”
Draco wanted to scream.
It had been a mere ten minutes ago that he’d come up with his plan.
. Draco’s head spun.
Potter gasped into his shirt, hand coming up to fist desperately in the dark material as they walked slowly towards the door. Hot breaths panted helplessly into Draco’s shirt. Draco could sense Muggle eyes on them- he tensed, and then melted soothingly as he felt Potter stiffen in reaction. God, his entire body was attuned to this boy gasping in his arms, clinging and glossy- eyed. He wanted to
With a defiant squawk, the owl tightened its grip on the slim letter in its talons, tucked its wings in, and dropped to the ground with a dull thud audible even from inside the rosily warm kitchen. Draco leaned even further over the sink, peering painfully downwards at a precarious angle to see the owl lying prone on the tiny back lawn. He raked a hand through his thick blond hair, and turned to the other two.
Draco snarled at a flash of billowing black robe in his left periphery, snatching Weasley’s wrist before he could empty a measure of ground Rottskunk nails into the creamy surface of their potion.
He was right behind Potter.
he thought dreamily,
A tight smile crossed Zabini’s lips. He inhaled deeply and then blew out the breath.
“I think we’ll have Miss Bones and Mr Finch- Fletchley and Mr Longbottom.”
“Oh, on Salazar.” The other boy gave a heavy, condescending sigh, as though he were about to spell something out for a very tiresome five year old. (Draco would have hexed him, but he was too curious.)
And Harry bit his lip, his grin threatening to split his face in two.
“So long.” There was a weighted pause. “Fucking thousands of years, Potter, God. So long.”
There was a loud, indignant yell, quickly followed by a bout of frantic shuffling and snickering.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy spun them suddenly, hands sure and firm on Harry’s lower back in a way that made Harry’s eyes fly open in shock and arousal. Malfoy crowded him back against the countertop, pressing their hips together hard so that Harry was completely trapped, his hands coming up to grip Malfoy’s biceps.
“Tell us.”
But Potter was already turning away, slipping into the stream of students that was starting to fill up the hallway, and his robes blended in with a sea of billowing black. Draco thought he might’ve looked back, once, the lenses of his glasses glinting in the warm daylight, but he was too far in and it hurt to watch him go, actually. Like Draco was losing something that had somehow entangled itself in his essence, tugging at his lungs as Potter got further and further. Leaving Draco with the odd, quiet melancholy of loneliness.
Pansy stared at the table.
His voice was smooth and even, and Draco knew instinctively his Lucidity Charm was perfect.
There was a pause.
Draco was utterly, miserably powerless to stop it.
, Draco thought.
“Draco?” She asked carefully.
The handle wouldn’t turn.
Draco looked at the tall, brown- skinned boy beside him, and the anxiety on his face set Draco’s stomach writhing.
, idiot,” Zabini said disgustedly.
(See the end of the chapter for
He saw a tiny, tiny shift in Potter’s eyes, a small softening of the curve of his mouth.
He nodded towards the two boys, a struggling mass, and with a parting shot of, “good luck, Finnigan, mate, looks like I’ve spiced him up for you a little- you’re welcome, by the way,” accompanied by a malicious wink, he closed the door to the broom cupboard and pulled his bag back over his shoulder.
Sheer, unadulterated excitement started to pulse in his veins, mixing in with the heavy tangles of desire and want, creating something rather like a time bomb. He felt like he was about to explode, but remained upright, jealously bringing Potter closer and closer to his body until his hair- smelling irresistibly of warm apple and musky boy- was tickling his nose, tipped down as it was. They started up the stairs, Potter moving slightly more independently now, but head still burrowed deep into Draco’s black shirt, hot breath stirring over his nipples, keeping him electrified. To stir things up, as they reached the top of the staircase, Draco decided to play with Potter a little. No reason to give him an easy time of it, just because he was suddenly so edibly…
Ron stiffened. “What House was she in?” He asked immediately, and his voice was strained. A muscle in Ginny’s delicate jaw ticked.
“Cheers, Theo,” he said awkwardly.
He was on his way to Muggle Studies, that much he knew. It was com… complimentary?
They trailed after him, elbowing each other discreetly.
But he was already pulling out a piece of parchment from the bureau that stood at the end of the dormitory, picking up a spare quill and pulling the ink pot towards him. The irresistible charm of pouring out one’s mind had him spellbound- before he knew it there were cursive words spilling out onto the parchment like thread from a spool.
Ron’s brows pulled together for a second, and his eyes flicked over Ginny’s face, as though searching for something.
Draco snorted. Should he tell her how exactly he was coping? By dreaming up people scribbling the next few words to a song that he was almost certain only he knew.
“Just before lunch,” Zabini replied, voice pitched low and careful.
Draco glanced up, eyelids heavy, to see Potter tucking his wand back into the slack waistband of his trousers. Several lewd things came to mind, but he brushed them off, instead opting to duck his head, staring resolutely at his shoes. Now that his head was completely clear, Draco realised just how drunk he’d been. Silence yawned like a fat, awkward cavern.
Zabini should not be touching Potter.
Draco tucked his shaking hands behind his back, folding them into his robes and winding the material tight.
“Yes, Mr Malfoy. It is, I daresay at this early stage, a good idea. I’m glad the two of you are… attempting to sort out your differences.” The corner of her mouth quirked up, and Draco blushed the bright, embarrassed red he’d been threatening to turn for the past twenty minutes. He sensed Potter, beside him, do the same.
“We love your new girlfriend. We love her so much we’re willing to date her, and we’re both gay,” Draco joked. His smile faded when he saw the snarl cut into Pansy’s fairy- like countenance.
“I’d be happy to prove that to you sometime,” he said, gaze on the ceiling.
“Kneazle saliva!” he snapped. Where was it? He couldn’t see it anywhere on the bench…
“Fucking hell, Potter—”
There was silence from opposite him, but not the oppressive kind. It was thoughtful, more like, but weighted all the same.
Seconds were ticking by, and Potter’s lashes were still feathering down. Draco couldn’t see his eyes, and his hand was still splayed tightly over his forearm, both of their wrists tense.
Draco resisted the urge to stand up straighter like a schoolboy and call her Professor. “Fascinating. He’s a wonderful author.”
“Let me guess,” Draco said drily. “It has something to do with the weird dynamic between you two where you treat him like glass and he curbs your hard edges and it’s all sweet and romantic and inter- house unity.”
Ginny snorted. “Yeah, right. Like it’ll be that easy. I want to keep you guessing. You’ll find out on the day.”
Malfoy inhaled sharply, and cast a quick, hot glance at Harry. Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off the pink bow of Malfoy’s lips, the smoothly planed curve of his neck, the wildness of his eyes under the slant of his brows. He wanted to tangle himself in the other man, get lost in him entirely, and his hand was needily tight on Malfoy’s thigh.
“Please, Malfoy. Give me a sodding break. You never take your eyes off the boy- not in the Hall, not in lessons, not anywhere. You haven’t noticed he’s been gone all week?”
This entire time, he hadn’t looked Potter in the eyes. He’d gotten a flash of unruly hair, red lips parted in retort, pale skin, but quickly looked down. Where, to be frank, he hadn’t found much solace. Because—what was Potter
But he’d been so absorbed in checking the showers, thinking about ways in which to catch the Gryffindor from the showers, he’d barely been paying attention in lessons, much less in the Hall. Often, he skipped meals, opting just to nurse a mug of milky tea in the common room and stare out of the window, watching the faint shadows of seaweed stroke over the glass and counting baby squids.
“WE’RE GOING TO THE WORLD CUP FINAL!” Blaise howled to the ceiling. Draco felt his lips stretch upwards in a smile.
Harry swore weakly.
Pansy frowned. “
Ginny sighed. “You know how I went to that wellness place back in February?”
Potter, and it was driving Draco crazy. Just these soft, barely- noticeable brushes and steers that spoke of an intimacy so sacred Draco wanted to burn it to the ground. A gentle hand on Potter’s hip, a pretentious stroke of the cheek when there was no ink on there and everyone knew it, a laugh that saw them lean close to each other, so close that Draco’s heart started to cook itself in a boiling froth of white rage.
“So, I saw this ad for someone in Witch Weekly. Like, someone to make you happy. You pay them for an hour, and they make you happy. I thought I could use—”
Draco said in a bored tone.
“So, yeah, I kind of coughed and looked down, and carried on eating, and that night I literally stared at the top of my four- poster and tried to sort out this tangled mass of feelings just sitting in my stomach.”
Ron looked at Harry bemusedly.
But now… now here was this pureblood, highbrowed and fair- skinned and shamelessly aristocratic, magical fingertips sliding over Winston Churchill’s miniature plastic face. It occurred dimly to Harry that he should offer to pay instead, but then Malfoy was turning to him, leather wallet in hand, and he was obscenely attracted to him, so much so that he didn’t think he could move in any direction, much less speak. He was galvanised, lips dry as Malfoy came towards him. His grey eyes were half- shielded by blond hair, and he looked almost… shy. He was worrying his lip, not sensually (though it was definitely one of the more adorable things Harry had ever witnessed) but anxiously, teeth sliding over his bottom lip and reddening it.
“Yes, Professor,” Granger said, forcing a smile.
At the moment, however, Draco was fighting a raging headache, battling his way through the treacle- thick crowds on the way to Double Charms, NEWT level. What fun. He heaved his bag over his shoulder, tugging the strap closer to him and frowning hard. The pulses of pain right behind his eyes made it hard to concentrate on anything- the pushing, yelling mass of students surrounding him in the wide corridor blurred together into a single vicious body determined to split his head in two. He pressed the heel of his hand into his right eye, gripping his hair tightly and trying to regain some clarity. Draco didn’t realise he’d slowed down dramatically until a kid nearly collapsed his kidney with a bony elbow to the back, having stumbled right into him and tried to carry on sprinting as though there wasn’t a blonde, six foot Eighth Year standing directly in front of him. Draco groaned, clapping his hand to the meat of his back and speeding up, nearly buckled over in bewildered pain. By the time he’d gotten a few metres further, he found that he could barely see from the cleaving, white- hot knife behind his eyes. He stumbled, blinked, and jerked as a light hand gripped the crook of his right arm, steering him into the nearest corridor on the left and then through a large, narrow door bearing the number ‘347’ on it in dull gilt- his Charms classroom. He peered to his right.
shabby, is it? It’s positively dandified.” Blaise said.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************
“Well, I didn’t have a partner, and since Snape was our teacher that year, he thought it’d be a laugh to put me with Malfoy.”
that, it’s my—”
Well... there you go. Thoughts?
Draco set a brisk pace, heading out through the courtyard and into the grounds. The corridors were pretty empty, most students still finishing breakfast, and he was relieved not to have to keep his head down as he took a sharp right out of the stone arches of the courtyard and onto the dewy grounds. He was careful not to stray onto the grass, treading precisely on the gravel path all the way down to the Quidditch pitch, morning air whipping blood into the apples of his cheeks. Faintly, he could make out several sets of wasp- yellow and black robes fluttering in the breeze as he approached the changing rooms, and a procession of Hufflepuff players made their way up to the castle in the opposite direction, backs to Draco as he came ever closer to the building they had just vacated.
Draco’s lips parted slightly, and he felt the urge to say something, confess the feelings swelling up in his chest like a wave boiling to smash against the shore, but Potter released him then, stepping back as though he thought he’d crossed a line, somehow.
“We going to yours?”
- had seen what he had not.
Not once.
, with a pliant sweetness Draco had never seen on him before.
Where the hell was Potter?
Harry should’ve known better than to come out alone on a date.
“Thanks, Professor,” Draco muttered, still blinking from the slightly strange sensation.
And then the realisation dawned on him, like a small present he hadn’t expected. Pansy wasn’t here, but he could still write to her.
Draco sighed, slouching lower in the chair and spreading his legs wider. He couldn’t think of anything, couldn’t get past the whirlwind of thoughts and emotions and new fucking information. God, so much had happened since he last wrote to Pansy. He didn’t know how to begin to explain it all.
“Mr Malfoy.” Draco made an effort to look sorry, but McGonagall seemed uninclined to reprimand him. Amazed, Draco had to remind himself that the idiot had thrown food at him.
But it seemed he could not. Potter, with an exasperated glance at Granger’s fussing, walked up to Weasley and wordlessly began helping him repack his bag, which had now been emptied of its contents entirely and was ready for a more strategic filling. Their heads were bent together as they murmured, just like in Muggle Studies, except now Draco was curious. He hooked his thumbs over the edges of his pockets and stood casually, cocking a hip to push his ear a fraction closer to their conversation, and listened in.
“Hello? Earth to Zabini. Anybody home?”
? You fucking befriended this girl?” Draco asked incredulously. “After you—”
“Wait, but, but—what are we going to do?!” Draco demanded, clutching at Pansy’s arm. She snatched it away, pearly sharp incisors bared for a second in what could only be described as an involuntary snarl. Draco mentally smacked himself. Pansy didn’t like to be clutched at unless she’d initiated it.
Theo’s jaw clenched.
,’ he thought sadly, and shoved the thought away. He wouldn’t be self- pitying. Anyway, it wasn’t that bad, was it? It was just that he hadn’t been out much lately, and the date had gone so wrong, and it was late, so late—he cast a quick wandless
“Actually, Draco… I don’t even remember the party.”
“So? I have no issue talking about you and Hermione snogging.”
“Tell us, tell us!” Harry chanted.
Draco snapped back to attention, looking back at Potter, who looked like he was weighing the offer up. After a minute or so in which Draco shifted breathlessly from foot to foot, staring at the ground, Potter opened his mouth, the parting of his lips a welcome sound in the tense silence.
By the time Harry had his fingers on the wood of the door he was ready to cry. He longed for nothing more than to be on his Firebolt, hundreds of metres high, hovering in the balmy summer evening air, distanced from every other human being on the planet. Free and light, confident in his every movement. Not here in this hell that seemed spiked and maliciously armed against him, trapped in his body that quaked and froze and sent shots of pure fear dissolving through his bloodstream at its own whim. He opened the latch with clumsy fingers, going through the gate and shutting it behind him. The barman didn’t give him a second glance; he breathed a sigh of relief.
, except Hermione’s dreadful—
“Yeah, well, Blaise can afford to. He can hold his drink, whereas you, Draco…” Pansy snickered.
Potter’s tongue poked into his cheek as he grinned back, slow and a tiny bit filthy.
Now, McGonagall was simply regarding them sternly over the rims of her rectangular lorgnettes; Draco was sure it was a trick she’d learned from Dumbledore. It still made him itchy under the collar, the nape of his neck prickling with the memory of those wise, blue eyes on him.
was the one who'd just fucking... outed Potter. Hadn't he? Or had Potter been... obvious?
“Why is everybody always telling me to move on?! Did you ever think maybe the old stuff has staying power?” Draco said hotly, and paused.
“One more,” Ginny smirked. (Ron gagged in the background).
Draco gave her a look, and she fell silent.
Harry did so.
“Did it occur to me? Did it occur to me? Was I or was I not,
“And you don’t ever want your own place?” Malfoy asked, hands bracing himself on the counter behind him. He looked easy there, comfortable against the dust- specked black granite, and somehow it made Harry’s chest loosen, seeing him standing there in the kitchen like it was his home. Like he belonged.
Chapped genetically, Pansy had informed him with a harried sigh. Apparently even she couldn’t smooth them out with all the products she’d smuggled from home—
“I know
Potter sat up, mirroring his posture, and he looked incensed now, fully awake. The lazy ease in the curve of his spine had vanished; he glared at Draco with that expression Draco had always hated and loved in equal measure, the burning one that meant he was about to defend his house and his school. Because he was just that fatally good, he’d never think to actually defend
Okay, so maybe he was a little drunk- but hey, perks of being an eighth year.
Sue him.)
Draco merely looked his scepticism. “This really constitutes an emergency?”
“Uh… what did that look like again?”
Harry offered him a smile, a small quirk of the lips. “Yeah, the house- elf turned the place around when we were on the run, staying here.”
“Not all of them, Ron!” Ginny screamed. “It’s so fucking unfair for you to use Fred against everything, when it’s just your own prejudice blinding you. Some of them were born into this! It’s all they fucking knew. Their parents were telling them it was okay! Their parents were telling them it was right! What would you do if Mum and Dad taught you something was right, from the day you were born?”
…It wasn’t that that Draco cared.
Malfoy gasped above him, and Harry felt warm breath on his hair, Malfoy’s hands sliding down his back to grope him through his jeans, and
And Malfoy groaned, half- aroused, half- mocking. Harry surged back into him, their chests pressing together, Malfoy’s hands desperate in his hair, squeezing over his hips, his stomach…
Mocking?
Mrs Finchman reached a shaky hand up to pinch his cheek. “You’re a good boy.”
“…thought you valued it more than that,” the ginger was finishing. “He feels iced out.”
“Nah,” Harry agreed. “I only knew one thing about myself, n’ that was what I had to do about our good friend Tom Marvolo Riddle when I was old enough.”
Potter ploughed on, seemingly fuelled by the small look of agreement.
She shrugged off her muddied Quidditch robes, leaving them in a dank pile on the wooden floor, and started to make her way towards the kitchen, eyes hungry. Harry moved to block her off, expression urgent.
Zabini curled his lip. “I’ll leave you two adolescents to neck some other time. What are we doing? I’d prefer to get out of this ferret’s general vicinity—” he pointed a long brown finger at Draco “—as soon as I possibly can.”
The walls whispered at Draco, blurring and curling in and giggling with him, as though they shared a schoolgirl secret.
“Pansy was here,” he said confidently. “Where’d she go?”
Pansy seemed to take this as an insult to her authority.
“No, I didn’t. Don’t fucking manhandle—
you was getting too hot a month ago. So no, I’m not okay, and I would really appreciate something to eat.”
Harry raised his eyebrows at Ron, and Ron grinned immediately, nodding almost imperceptibly back at. Ron’s skill in subterfuge had come on in leaps and bounds ever since they’d started having to find creative ways to get rid of the accursed oatmeal. Now, he was wonderful at stalling, and practically as good at lying as Harry, though not quite as quiet on foot. Something about living with the Dursleys and sneaking around upstairs whenever they had company had made Harry completely silent on any type of flooring; even on the creaky wooden planks of Grimmauld Place, he’d had been silent as a tomcat, footsteps ghosting over the oak like silk slipping over steel.
A snort escaped him, and Malfoy grinned in response, eyes glued endearingly to Harry’s mouth.
He shook hastily, pulling his hand away as fast as he could and breaking their stare. With a quick nod, a tight smile, he turned away and started to walk back to the Slytherin table. His heart raced beneath his robes in a way that was entirely unreasonable. As he strode away, Potter called after him.
Harry blinked. “What about me?”
Jesus fuck. They needed to get out of here this instant.
More to stop himself thinking than anything, Draco ducked back under the shower spray, scrubbing his hands through his hair and massaging his scalp roughly. But his eyes opened as though controlled by a wilful spirit, and snatched another glance at the inscription. Though his pupils stung, hazed with water, he couldn’t tear his gaze away.
“Don’t rub that in my face! The stupid wand didn’t know what it wanted—probably just felt like practicing some of the more basic spells for a change.” He stepped closer to Potter, hands still deep in his pockets. “Some of us have a more diverse range than just Expelliarmus, you see.”
There was no reply.
A spasm of hopeless mirth twisted Blaise’s mouth before he schooled it back into a bland smile.
Harry and Hermione sat frozen as Ron extended his arms, and Ginny went into them considerably more agreeably than she did most things. The two fiery heads bent together, and Ginny’s long, strong limbs wrapped tight around Ron’s lanky bulk.
Not a word from Potter.
“Yep. That’s the Golden Boy.”
Potter’s eyes flickered unmistakeably down to his ankles- which weren’t exposed at all; Draco had been exaggerating, and really, was that look of hurt on his face
“Watch it, Zabini.” Draco pushed his plate away from him, hand slipping under the table to rest softly on the handle of his wand, tucked firmly in his robes. Zabini’s eyes followed the movement, and he stiffened, jaw working for a minute, and then the other boy took a deep breath, long legs stepping easily out from behind the bench. He turned to go, then looked over his shoulder, brown eyes reckless.
The wind blurred Draco’s vision. His emerald robes, dulled by spatterings of mud and sweat, whipped around him like a flag. His muscles ached relentlessly from gripping the broom, and his fingers felt like they were frozen in place.
Draco looked down for a second, gaze flickering to the floor.
“Uhm, could you, ah—” someone cleared their throat behind Harry, and he startled a little, jerking in his seat. He tried to pass the movement off as recoiling from a fly, and started awkwardly swatting at the air, shooing a bug that didn’t exist. His eyes slid back up to the waiter, who now looked confused as to whether he should ask for an autograph or call St. Mungo’s. Harry lowered his hand slowly, straightening. He drew in a long, thick breath, air catching on the snag in his throat.
Draco flushed. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“Wales’ll be third, ‘cause we beat them narrowly yesterday, and in a few days I reckon we’ll play India for the title. ‘S going to be tough. They’ve got a great lineup this year, and there’s this Chaser-“ Ginny broke off, hacking into her sleeve. They all looked at her alarmedly as she gasped, coughing so fiercely that her body spasmed. Harry was just reaching over to pat her on the back when she took in a deep, clean gulp of oxygen. He looked to his left to see Hermione tucking her wand back into her robes, wearing an expression untarnished in its good intentions save for a tinge of smugness.
“The cuts don’t make you weak,” he said gently, and the other boy’s eyes flew to his.
about Potter! I couldn’t care less! Could- not- care- less.” He gave Pansy an emphatic stare. She stared right back at him, lips pressed into a firm line, and his voice broke into a high, embarrassing whine.
(See the end of the chapter for
Faintly, Draco sensed Potter shift his bag from one shoulder to the other and turn to him. Before he knew it, there was a hand on the arm of his robes, gripping him tight. He looked up to see Potter holding him, eyes urgent.
“The right person?” Was all he said, words carefully nonchalant.
Why was it gloopy?
After every other House had a Quidditch practice, Draco would sneak into the showers and check if anything had been added to the writing. Once he’d established what House the person was in… he didn’t know, exactly. His gut writhed with anticipation. This had consumed him for weeks- was he really risking the ruin of the only exciting thing in his life just for… curiosity’s sake?
, second best in our entire wizarding year NEWTS?”
Malfoy leaned closer, so they were completely pressed up against each other along their entire bodies. His breath was warm when he whispered against Harry’s ear, hips rolling infinitesimally, enough to drive Harry completely crazy.
“It’s not actually politics, you know. It’s basic human rights. And no, actually, we’re not on a date anymore.”
Draco woke early, restless, head thick and dizzied from lack of sleep. He stretched on the couch, groaning, and stood gingerly, hugging himself, before making his way over to the dark wooden drinks cabinet standing over by the west wall. Clumsily, he made himself a cup of milky Earl Grey, and sat cross- legged on the window seat to eke out the hours until breakfast, as the dawning sun sent warm, newborn rays stroking down through the water, caressing Draco’s face and staining the lake a becoming gold-green.
Malfoy’s gaze was sure, but he was still chewing his lip.
, wand flicking delicately under the voluminous sleeve of his robes.
you, Pansy,” he said, touched.
“Probably India. They’re playing Wales tomorrow, and Bulgaria’re against Bogota the day after that, but they’ll be fighting it out for fourth and fifth; Bulgaria just aren’t as good without Krum. Damn shame he retired.” Ginny shook her head sagely.
“Nah, I like having a nice haze on me before the meal starts. Helps me when I try and figure people out.”
It made him want to wreck him, to be perfectly honest, and Zabini’s greedy hands on him weren’t helping the situation.
“Maybe a little,” he finished lowly, still fucking staring, and Harry walked towards him, tipping the other man’s chin up.
Pansy glowered. “You first.”
He snapped back to attention just in time to hear McGonagall start to speak, her voice measured in the silence of the office.
Draco’s mouth fell open. He looked around at Blaise, eyes unconvincingly offended. “Wha—you think that’s—you think I--? I don’t
And then he was rutting against Harry with no reserve, breaths harsh and loud in Harry’s ear.
“—Actually, I’ve just remembered that’s not true. I did have a moment. It was gradual after that, but I just remembered I had a specific, out- of- the- blue moment where I suddenly felt attracted to girls. I was at dinner in the Great Hall, kind of tired, y’know, after a really shit day of lessons. You guys weren’t there, or Neville and Luna, or actually anybody I really liked. I was sitting by myself, which I didn’t mind, because I could just eat and let my mind wander. I don’ really remember what I was thinking about, but I remember hearing a group of girls giggling together behind me.”
Malfoy snorted. “I’m not
“So, if that’s alright with you then… oh, well, is it?” He asked, realising with a sinking feeling of horror that they’d never actually agreed to anything.
Draco stayed where he was, smirking. “No, you. I insist.”
The Charm collapsed, and rain poured in, drenching Draco in seconds as he stumbled in shock, and started to sprint the short distance between him and shelter.
And he couldn’t quench that voice, no matter how hard he lathered himself in soap and scrubbed it away. No matter how much time passed, the black lines stayed scrawled on his retinas, printed there so he couldn’t blink them away.
“Your own fault for wearing tights out, Potter,” he said snottily. Harry wasn’t even slightly fooled.
Draco jerked out of his trance, hands shaking slightly with nerves as he fiddled anxiously with his trousers, not daring to look up as Potter and Weasley made for the exit. Once he deemed it safe, he blew out a quick breath, head spinning with what he’d just overheard, and straightened, about to leave—only to freeze.
Pansy was very possessive.
Malfoy turned to him, and his grey eyes were… hollow.
Draco giggled weakly, because he could appreciate a joke and also Potter was leaning in
The plan flashed through Draco’s mind at breakneck speed, then again slower, and he went over it again and again in his mind, deliberating excruciatingly over every fine point.
“What’s your girl’s name?”
A part of Draco wanted to argue.
“And spectators?”
There. Now, when he returned for Quidditch practice next week and nobody had written anything more, Draco would know that he’d been fooling himself. But a tiny voice, gouging an acid hole in the pit of his stomach, murmured, “What if someone replies?”
Draco looked gleefully at Weasley, struggling to keep the smirk off his face.
And that did get Malfoy’s attention. He looked back, and his lips parted slightly in what had to be shock. Harry was only inches away, closer than even he’d realised. He saw Malfoy’s lashes flutter down, thick and dark blonde. Darker than his hair. It felt like he was trying to regroup, pull a mask back up.
Draco grinned. “You needn’t look at him like he’s a different species, Pans; we’ve both seen you shovelling in cereal in the morning like it’s going out of fashion.”
“Not to be cliché, but…” he murmured.
, is the one thing you look for as soon as you’ve sat down in a classroom?”
“Sorry,” Hermione said, releasing a rare giggle. “Look, why don’t you ask—”
Draco looked at his shoes.
“But inexpressibly powerful, if handled correctly.”
Now he was the one receiving Hermione’s patented patronising look. “Oh, please. You can practically see the brand of your underwear through those.”
He shivered.
Decent? Quiet?
Draco was enraged.
Did that sound too self- pitying? Maybe it just seemed like that because, though it was meant to be a joke, Draco meant what he was saying a little more than he wanted Pansy to know. Still, there was no way she could know how lonely he’d been. But he didn’t want her to feel sorry for him.  Just in case…
How could it be…
together?” He clutched his spasming abs, coughing weakly.
“We’ll ask McGonagall for permission at lunch. Meet me in the corridor outside her office at twelve- forty!”
Hermione sighed loudly.
Pansy gave him the finger, silvery family ring flashing.
He turned back to his work, and tried to ignore Weasley’s angry brown eyes on his back. Draco hoped, hoped so hard he thought his heart would shrivel from the force, that Weasley would let it go. He didn’t need one of the Golden Trio publicly ribbing him. They were like the alpha wolves to this pack of sheep. Once they did something, you could be sure everybody else would follow suit, even in the case of Weasley, who, in Draco’s opinion, had no more brains than the common mountain troll.
Oh, bloody hell.
And then the man was gone, heels drumming on the wooden staircase. The restaurant was frozen.
match.
Harry flicked a limp hand through the air. “Nope. Going to a Muggle place. Well, there’s a wizarding clientele, so I guess we’ll be on a separate floor, but there’s Muggles about the place. Have to blend in. No robes tonight.”
“Honestly, Ronald! Did you wake him up or not? Do I have to do everything myself, or--”
“Well, I met a girl there,” Ginny continued, and Harry could see she was trying to stay impassive, but her pink lips twitched up indomitably, and a slight blush crept up her neck, staining the pale skin.
. He clenched his jaw, trying to clear his head. But unbidden into his mind came the memory of that overwhelming tenderness he’d felt at the sight of Potter curled on the hospital bed, the curve of his cheek soft and pale in the weak daylight. How he’d practically melted that day in Potions, when Potter had held him back from punching Weasley, whispering teasing words into the nape of his neck. Raw, unbridled jealousy, even fury, when he’d seen fucking Finnigan with his hands all over
The hallway sharpened a little around him, and the black flowers revealed themselves as students, black robes fluttering behind them as they whisked to lessons. Draco stumbled, grinned foolishly, and shouldered his bag. He’d just had a free period, and had spent it swigging from the secret stash of Firewhisky in the eighth- year Slytherin dorms. He’d just about reached a pleasant state of detachment from the world, where he was aware of the things around him but couldn’t find it in himself to care particularly about any of those things.
Pansy huffed. “Well, it sounds crazy when you say it like that.”
It felt like a riddle. It sounded like a riddle. But, taking one look at Zabini’s disbelieving face, Draco felt like maybe the truth was staring him right in the face. This wasn’t some ambiguous code he had to crack. This was an observation Zabini had made about Draco.
“Well, normally I’d have accounted for the whole meal, but you both seem to have the appetites of Hippogriffs tonight. Pansy here has singlehandedly demolished that shabby shabby thing.”
As Draco reclaimed his seat beside Pansy, he felt his head start to clog with rising questions, a low- grade panic buzzing in him. Panic, and maybe something else that he chose to ignore.
And it was fucking ridiculous, what Draco was even about to contemplate. Because how could it be…
Draco cut in, feeling his heart climb stupidly into his throat. He wasn’t going to cry, no, that would be ridiculous. But his voice was jagged. “Besides, McGonagall probably wouldn’t believe me that her precious, perfect Golden Boy ever led a Death Eater astray. The very notion of it would probably rock her world order.”
Theo Nott.
Which, like, really?
, he realised midway through Arithmancy,
“If we weren’t in a public place,” Draco took a dignified sip of his water, “I’d jinx you silly.”
Draco gulped, weighing up the situation. Shock and embarrassment sluiced through him like icy water, the syrupy thrum of his pulse picking up as he slowly regained his senses and the blur of arousal wore off somewhat. In his periphery, he could see Potter staring at the floor, his hair a mess and his tie askew. Draco didn’t need to look down to see that his own robes were badly mussed, the collar of his shirt rumpled, and he could feel a blush staining his cheeks, creeping across his neck.
Potter rolled his eyes. “You’re clearly not ready to face it, and I have no idea why else you would be here, so…” he raised his hand as though to catch the waiter’s attention, and Draco saw his lips in slow motion, almost shaping the words ‘the bill, please?’
“I want to, though.”
“Y’alright?” She probed.
, but knowing you, you’ll have managed to convince her of that by the time the starters arrive. Stop flirting. It makes me nauseous, and besides, every time she looks at you it’s like she’s visualising you naked, and that makes me visualise you naked, which is just…” Pansy shuddered.
“He’s not allowed visitors,” Zabini mumbled, and Draco felt a hot spike of worry pierce his throat, choking him off for a second.
He got slowly to his feet, back straight despite the throbbing of his head. “What’s that supposed to mean? Look, I’m sorry if your daytime dalliances disgust me, Potter and that hurts your feelings, but—”
Harry bit back a responding grin. “I was rather hoping you’d be doing the ravishing, actually.”
**********************************************************************************
His brain was filled with fuzzy white silence.
ensuite!” Harry protested.
Draco read the letter through, setting his quill down gently. Suddenly, the entire incident seemed ludicrous to him. Of course it had been him. Who was going to know a Muggle song? He swore quietly. Suddenly, he didn’t want to say any more. He picked up his quill once more and slashed a hasty goodbye, telling Pansy he would write to her again and that he hoped to see her soon; whenever she was on holiday. Quickly, he dashed down the dormitory stairs, through the common room, and out into the bowels of the school. Mentally, he cursed the fact that the Slytherin common room was so many levels down. His legs ached as he ran up the main staircase, tie loosened and shirtsleeves pushed up. When he finally reached the landing that preceded the Owlery, he rounded the corner at breakneck speed, letter clutched in his hand, and promptly crashed into someone.
The bell rang, cutting through the dialogue all around the room, and Draco tucked his hands into his pockets, hanging back, waiting for everyone else to leave. But Weasley couldn’t close his bag, fumbling with the buckle and shoving at his awkwardly positioned belongings to make room. Out of the corner of Draco’s eye, half- obscured by a piece of blond hair that was hanging over his bent face,  he saw Potter and Granger approaching, Granger still fiddling with the strap on her own satchel.
, he thought desperately, willing the Shield Charm to hold until he could get inside. But it was weakening steadily, and he was so close to the changing rooms, but then he felt a dribble of rainwater over his nose, and he spluttered, swearing.
To be honest, Blaise was little more than a damn nuisance to Draco at that moment..
“What colour is it?” Hermione replied from inside the bathroom.
He forced himself to stand up, pushing his chair back as quietly as he could. It still squeaked a little, and he cringed visibly, looking around to see if anyone was watching him.
“Sorry,” Ginny wheezed, tears streaming down her cheeks. “Oat got stuck in my throat.”
“If I get shot down today, I’m blaming you lot.”
“I said, mind if I return the favour?” Malfoy repeated. His eyes were steady, but he was biting his lip in such a way that he looked as though he wanted to devour Harry.
rippled over him, and he wondered briefly what his own name would sound like on those lips, in that sinful tone. But then he was jerked out of his reverie by the screaming knowledge of just what exactly Potter had been talking about.
“You alright here?”
“I—” he began eloquently, only to break off with a hitch in his breath. He curled his lip on reflex, only just escaping biting his lip like a child.
Potter scoffed. “You can’t be serious.”
“Okay. I’m going to pretend you’re not acting like a child, and invite you in. I didn’t know you’d been here with—”
Malfoy’s lashes lowered for a second, and when he looked back up his gaze was dark.
Blaise was contemplative for a second, skin glowing like the love-child of coffee and cream, dimple pressing obscenely deep in the warm light. The woman blushed as he regarded her lazily, eyes half- lidded. “Shot of Ogden’s Firewhisky on the rocks? And keep them coming. Or, you know what, just bring the bottle, and once that’s finished cut me off.” He gave her a smile filled with easy charm. “I’m holding you accountable for my sobriety, now. Don’t let me down.”
“Yes, sir?” The waiter looked politely awestruck, eyes darting from the scar on his forehead to his green eyes behind distinctive black glasses. Harry sometimes wondered if he should change style of glasses to throw people off, but what was the use in that? They’d recognise him anyway, and he’d owned this pair for more than a decade.
“Where did you actually go, may I ask?” Blaise inquired, dimpling roguishly at her. “To see a special someone? Or should I say…” he leaned in, licking his lips obnoxiously. “
“Draco. Draco, get up. Come
A little adorable. Harry wasn’t stone, after all.
Potter grinned disbelievingly, a laugh huffing out as though unbidden. He raised his eyes to the ceiling “Why’re you here, Malfoy?”
“Not strictly true,” Blaise interjected, waving an elegant hand. “Let’s not forget, Draco, about your raging schoolboy crush on the Chosen One. I don’t think you’re in any position to judge.”
Harry searched Malfoy’s face for a trace of that blonde boy he’d met outside the Great Hall. His face was still expressive, still pale, but somehow matured, effortlessly lovely now. He’d grown into his eyes, too, Harry thought. Where they’d been enormous in school, grey and haunted, now they fit his face, elegantly cool.
Malfoy nosed closer to Harry’s cock, warm breath hitting him through the fabric of his boxers, and Harry actually trembled at the sensation. God, how was he meant to survive this?
“All the boys’re just longing to do anything for me, yeah? That includes you, does it, Malfoy?”
“Pointy git, floppy blonde hair, posh voice?” Ron’s voice was getting shriller and shriller.
“What are we doing?” Draco said, words rushing out of him like he’d been unbottled, somehow.
He exhaled.
“You don’t have to—”
” muttered Blaise defiantly
Harry waved her away.
“The fashion guru? The queen of haute couture? The style icon?” A high, amused voice said from the doorway. Ginny was leaning against the door frame, long legs and arms crossed languidly.
Ginny dabbed at her eyes. “All grown up, our boy.”
Weasley opened his mouth, a mulish smile playing around his lips. Draco braced himself, looking back at him coldly. Just as he was sure something idiotic was going to come out of the Weasel’s mouth, a lazy voice came from behind Draco.
“Okay, okay!” he yelped, hands in the air. “I’m sorry. But if you think about it, it’s a compliment—”
And the oatmeal was gone.
They walked on, Slytherin code preventing either of them from harsher words, and for once Draco was grateful for the code of etiquette their families had impressed upon them, allowing them to finally just move on from something as easy as breathing.
“Mate? Are you… do you want to put the wand down? And talk to me? You can tell me anything.” He desperately searched his brain for that gay Muggle leaflet Pansy had once given him. What had it said the parents should say?
Draco wobbled a bit, and giggled. He figured he was maybe an annoying drunk, but he was also a fucking Slytherin and he wanted respect. He pounded his chest with a lean fist, glaring at a small Ravenclaw girl who scuttled past with a frightened start.
“LUCIUS MALFOY POSTHUMOUSLY STRIPPED OF ALL TITLES AND HONOURS AFTER NEW WAR ATROCITIES REVEALED”
“D’you think it looks good?”
He inhaled sharply, softly, and crossed the last little gap between the two of them, his right hand coming up to grip the back of Malfoy’s neck, and the left darting up to cup his cheekbone, feather- light. Cautious. Gentle.
Ginny glared at him.
It sounded ridiculous when he said it. They’d just been
One of Potter’s dark eyebrows flicked up so exquisitely delicately that Draco was painfully reminded of how gay Potter was. He remembered reading about it the year after the war. The Prophet had had a field day with it. God, would everything about this boy always make him feel so fucking twisted up in knots? There was a squirming, tight ball of genuine pain in the pit of his stomach. He was so bloody confused.
Hermione looked up from her knitting, cheeks pleasantly flushed from the fire. “Lovely. Was it alright?”
It was fucking wrong, genuinely disturbing, that the sudden plumpness of his bottom lip shot to Draco’s cock.
She surveyed both of them again, and Draco felt the weight of her sharp mind press upon him like a load. Potter, beside him, looked less uncomfortable. He’d probably been exposed to this sort of philosophical interrogation for years. Snape, during the entire stretch from first to sixth year, had never once talked to any of them like this. As though he cared.
“That’s not the point, Malfoy.” Potter just looked entertained now, and it make Draco’s blood boil, because wasn’t he supposed to have the power here?
Zabini shifted. “Over the summer. He was… shocked, from after the war, isolated, even.”
It was ridiculous, really. In all Draco’s years at Hogwarts he’d been distracted – obsessed – by Potter. But he’d never gotten to know him, had he? They’d never spoken softly, cross- legged on each other’s four posters at three in the morning like him and Pansy, never joked over breakfast and Vanished each other’s favourite juice. They’d never hugged fierce and hot on platform nine and three- quarters, an icy holiday in the Manor looming over Draco like a Dementor. But somehow, over the years, the corrosive anger between the two boys - the malice and taunts and fights - had led Draco to have a bizarrely deep understanding of Harry Potter, one that provided him a comprehensive, sensitive knowledge of all his weaknesses and fears and darkness. And somewhere along the way… Draco had begun to notice his beauty, all flushed cheeks and bright eyes and quick sarcasm. The way his robes were tight across his chest and hit perfectly on his ankles, fluttering up to expose deliciously delicate arches and tendons. How he was shorter, significantly so, than Draco; that if they stood chest- to chest, Potter could hook his chin over Draco’s shoulder and Draco could maybe dip his head and drink in the scent of Potter’s hair, arms fitting round each other as they pressed so tight they wondered if they could ever let go. Yes, in a perverse way, Draco knew Harry Potter better than he knew anyone else.
, fuck! But you pay the stupid fat thing, Pansy.” And he flung his wallet on the table, standing up and stalking over to the window with his arms crossed.
“Uhm.” Pansy’s voice was becoming steadily more and more hushed. “Gryffindor.”
“I—I—“ Draco couldn’t form a whole sentence.
Draco opened his mouth, about to cut in, when he became vaguely aware of raised voices behind him. He stopped, and twisted in his chair to see the table he and Blaise had been playing a drinking game on. The dark- haired man with his back to them was sitting up straight, gesticulating somewhat incredulously, and the sheer- shirted guy facing them looked mulish. He stood up, chair screaming on the polished wooden floors, and cut his date off mid- sentence. His voice was loud and vulgar, audible over the gentle background music, which died down abruptly as the band stopped and stared.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Come on, Chosen One. Get to your date.” She ushered him towards the Floo.
“Would you like to order drinks now?”
Below that, a subheading declared:
Draco felt weak. “But what are the… what are the chances of that?”
, he thought slowly, ideas running like a slow river of treacle through his mind. God, why was he so sluggish?
Malfoy moaned above him, voice absolutely ruined, low and roughened as he swore.
Ginny jerked her head towards Harry and Ron.
Ginny sighed, reaching a languid arm up to tangle through her long, fiery hair. “Well, that was just one encounter with a girl that made me feel stuff. The first encounter ever. But I had about six years’ experience of having what I thought was a ‘crush’ on Harry here.” She patted his head clumsily. “At first, I tried to ignore the whole girl thing. Then, when I started dating Harry, I actually came to terms with it, but our relationship was kind of… comfortable, and I didn’t know it should be more than just that, so I thought I could be bi. And I kidded myself into thinking I loved you. No offence.”
“We’ve essentially snuck into the Headmistress’s office, and she doesn’t know we’re even coming? Never mind how you know her fucking password, aren’t we going to be in deep—”
“Fuck off, would you?” Draco said disgustedly, shoulders tense with anger.
A particularly loud laugh of Granger’s, prompted undoubtedly by Bookly, who was blushing fiercely, made Weasley emit a sort of wounded noise that sounded a bit like a pained Kneazle.
“Mind if I return the favour?” He asked, and it didn’t feel like much of a request.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Look, you have an attractive chest. Just because I like girls doesn’t mean I don’t know what makes men look good. You don’t have chest hair, you’re pretty buff but still got that kinda lean preppy thing going on, and the shirt suits your skin tone. Trust me.”
“Look, Zabini, it wasn’t me who ratted them out, okay? Now for god’s sake leave me the—” Draco broke off, clapping a hand to his forehead as a searing pain went through it. The knife behind his eyes was now slicing steadily into his optic nerves. Draco gasped for breath, head pounding, and dark red spots appeared in his vision. He shook his head frantically, trying to clear them, but he could only wheeze and cough into his hand. To his horror, a spray of garish red erupted onto his palm, peppering his mouth with the metallic tang of blood. Theo Nott, who had been watching Draco and Zabini argue worriedly, sprang to his feet and cupped Draco’s head in his hands, eyes roving his face worriedly.
“…Yeah?”
,” Blaise said meaningfully, eyebrows so far up they were nearly indiscernible from the neat, dark swoop of his hairline.
“I mean,
Blaise nodded vaguely, munching on an apple.
Draco was stony- faced. “Exactly. So if your question was whether or not it occurred to me to use a fourth year spell, the answer would be- do you take me for a fucking idiot?”
“Will that be all?”
She looked up, and grimaced. “No, I’m fine, just… I should really have told you this earlier. For the record, I’m sorry I didn’t. It’s- well, I wanted time to process.”
A flicker of the jaw was all he got.
Draco’s breath hitched.
“’Mione! What d’you think of this shirt?” Harry yelled through the ensuite door.
Okay, fuck.
He traced his tongue over his lips, suddenly so slack, and fiddled with his trouser pocket lining.
“What?
“Well?”
“Nott?” Draco’s voice was weary. “Just… whatever it is you’re not telling me, tell me now. Seriously, I’m stressed, and tired, and I don’t know how you know about that—”
“Oh, don’t look so scandalised,” Ginny said, examining her nails. “It’s a good thing. Shows your date that you have other options, whilst also giving him an attractive insight into what he might get a piece of if he behaves. Works every time.”
- he hadn’t been bothered about it, though.
Ginny nodded. “Not patent. Get a pair of lace-ups, preferably with a bit of a heel on them. Helps to pull off skinnies.” She raked a disturbingly clinical gaze over Harry, who felt only mildly violated. “You’ve got good legs, Golden Boy. Show ’em off.”
Pansy looked slightly mollified. As the boys slid off the table and back into their respective seats, she sat down again, fingers still gripping the tickets tightly.
Draco gave a strangled cough. “Jesus!”
Potter seated himself comfortably in one of the armchairs, facing the fire slightly so that the warmth radiated towards him. He looked up at Draco, expectant, and Draco sighed, holding back a curse. He sat in the other armchair, and tried to look remotely relaxed.
He was not equipped to deal with this.
“That’s not my fault!” Potter exclaimed, and looked up slightly in nervousness, checking to see if anyone had heard. Draco looked away quickly, and busied himself with his bag.
And Harry’s stomach tightened and melted, throwing itself on the floor and wailing. The emotion swelling in his throat quickened his breath so he was panting, pulse fluttering, and Malfoy was staring at him with limpid pools of silver for eyes. That was desire, Harry knew it, and he couldn’t wait any longer. He crossed the distance between them in a step and a half, hands reaching instinctively for Malfoy’s waist, and when the other man met him halfway it was pure relief, cool water in the desert. Harry burned for him, chests pressing together with the urgent need of two people utterly absorbed in one another, and he wanted more, so much more, nothing was enough. Not the slide of his lips over Malfoy’s exposed neck, leaving a trail of goosebumps in his wake, not the possessive splay of Malfoy’s hand over his hip, not even the breaths they were exchanging, hot need misting closer, mingling, gasping…
“I wouldn’t say it’s a
But Draco’s blood was up, suddenly, and he was close to Potter, so close that he fancied he was swallowing down the warm puffs of breath Potter was exhaling, feeding Potter his own air as well.
As they descended the upper level stairs, the Headmistress added, “Oh, and Mr Potter?”
“I can make you, um, a cup of tea?”
“Right, sorry.” Pansy didn’t sound sorry at all. Draco raised his head from the crook of his arms.
this girl, and she’s special. I never thought we’d work, but we do, and didn’t I tell you that you couldn’t make fun of me?”
Harry licked his lips. “I…” Shit. Did he say it? Would it drive him off?
? Have you lost your mind? Do you even comprehend what—”
At that moment, Draco wanted it. Wanted to feel awful about himself, and be proven right. He didn’t let up, closing in on Potter and feeling his mouth thin out with that violent need fuelling him.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I know.”
“Ron, mate, what’d you think about the second question?”
Draco coughed awkwardly, shifting in his seat. The restaurant’s music started up again, and a low hum of chatter threaded across the room, ripples of conversation whispering in his ears.
Draco gave an awkward wave of his hands and wanted to Avada himself. “Nothing, I—nothing? You just looked… sad.”
, I just…”
Zabini stepped ahead of him, turning smoothly so he was walking backwards through the Transfiguration corridor and facing Draco as they walked.
Zabini rolled his eyes. “God, you’ve really zoned out this week, haven’t you?”
“Well, he didn’t, did he?” Weasley replied, and it silenced the dark haired boy for a moment. Draco was fascinated, hands slackening on the leather of his satchel as he leant in. A voice in the back of his mind screamed that he was being painfully obvious. But the worry was silenced by Potter’s murmur, so low Draco had to strain in order to hear.
Draco began to think, and then banged the lid on that thought so hard that the mental reverberations made him a little dizzy.
Ron looked sheepish. “Sorry. It’s just…” he lowered his voice. “Hermione’s getting cranky. She says she reckons you sleep in to annoy her, and its unfair for us to expect her to make breakfast and have it ready for whenever we deign to grace her with our presences.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione laughed, a pregnant lady laugh, full of vibrant, generous life, and Ginny smiled despite herself.
Ron—still a die- hard Cannons fan-- chucked a pillow at him, which missed by a mile.
Draco turned his head slightly to face Potter, eyes tracing his profile in the warm daylight.
“We were doing the Confundus Charm, but apart from like, messing you up, the Charm lowers your inhibitions if it’s too strong, right?” He looked around the room for confirmation.
Harry widened his eyes at Ginny from behind Hermione’s back, waving his arms discreetly to warn her off, but Ginny was already agreeing obliviously, pushing her red hair behind her ears. The girls went into the kitchen, chatting, and Harry leaned against the wall, feeling quite tired of trying to save everyone from the dreaded oatmeal.
Pansy giggled. “Oh, calm down, Draco. Don’t get all antsy just because Potter’s here too.”
the person behind this would want him. And maybe, just maybe, he’d want them back.
Draco peered out from under the arches of the courtyard at the grounds, obscured thickly by pounding sheets of rain that slickened grass and stone alike. He grimaced, and cast a surreptitious Shield Charm, body enveloped in a softly glowing bubble that would hopefully protect him from the relentless weather. He took a breath, and ducked out from the cover, into the maelstrom of wind and rain.
“My pleasure.”
Draco picked up his wand from the nook where he’d put it, and stepped up to the wall again, wet fingers set in that peculiar grip on his wand handle that burned black lines into the glistening tiles. Carefully, heart pounding, he scratched another line.
Blaise groaned, and Draco could practically hear him rolling his eyes.
“Alright, Gin?”
“What’s the matter, Zabini? Eat something at breakfast that didn’t agree with your delicate constitution? Want me to send an owl home to mummy? She must be terribly worried about her darling boy, all alone at school with ex
Draco fought the urge to feel his cheeks.
Ginny snorted. “What the hell kind of a question is that? I don’t remember my exact facial expression.” She swallowed.
Harry shook his head. He was on summer break from Auror training with Ron, and he hadn’t actually been on a date since… well, ever since he’d dated Ginny, really. He hadn’t really had time to meet anyone after school, and he’d honestly never cared enough to pursue it.
**********************************************************************************
Draco cleared his throat harshly, distracting himself before he flagged up again in his trousers.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************
Ron swallowed, swiping at his eyes clumsily with the back of his hand. When he spoke his voice was rough.
Looking up, Draco got a fleeting visual of Pansy giving him daggers and Blaise preening himself in the mirror, before he got hurriedly to his feet and smiled.
Draco’s mouth was suddenly very dry. He half- turned to Pansy and Blaise, a screaming question in his eyes.
Draco mumbled incoherently into his pillow.
Ron leapt onto the remark like a fly onto rotting meat. “So,” he began eagerly, “so, d’you want some of my oatmeal? I mean,” his ears flushed a light shade of pink, as they always did when he was searching for an idea. Harry saw it strike him, and his face became the epitome of husbandly concern.
“I can’t see it,” Hermione said.
Blaise gave a wry laugh. “None taken.”
“Uh… I understand you might feel different right now, but if you just open up I can…?”
“Aah, Draco, don’t sulk. ‘S only a Knut,” Pansy said, smirking when he glared at her.
“But I just… I didn’t mean any of it. What I said. It’s
Draco tried to reason, but he couldn’t shake a cold, leaden feeling of betrayal, sitting like a waterlogged corpse in his stomach.
A little melody, rendered rough and low in the boyish timbre of his voice, but in his head each note was shrill and high. He knew the song by heart- a Muggle song. He’d heard it sometime after his father’s funeral. Lucius had just died, weak from Azkaban and the inevitable fall of Voldemort, and Narcissa had fled mere days before to somewhere in the South of France. She’d tried to make Draco come with her, but he’d been determined- just to spite her, she’d said angrily- to stay for eighth- year. He could still recall, Draco thought bitterly, the sight of her pale face, a little decorous tear gleaming on her cheek, as she Apparated away from him.
This woman was unfortunately unaware of that fact, and she nodded, flustered, lips pursed in concentration, eyelashes flickering as she stole subtle glances at Blaise, who was now examining his perfect fingernails with elegant disinterest.
“…Theo?” He asked incredulously, wondering if he even wanted an answer.
Pansy shook her head, ringlets bouncing, and though she looked upset a small smirk carved its way onto her face as though she couldn’t help it. And, Draco knew, she couldn’t. She was a Slytherin. “They don’t know. I managed to get myself in pretty easily, it’s just Polyjuice—”
Draco exhaled. “Pansy. Darling. That sentence was not even slightly understandable by anyone untrained in the lingo of the chronically mad. Speak. Fucking. Sense.”
He could feel the truth of it.
Draco smirked. “Well, don’t give away my secret. The team’s pretty set on becoming best buddies with you guys.”
“Still?” Ginny demanded shrilly. “Oh for… is there anything eatable around the place, then?”
Potter clenched his jaw. “Stop being a child, Malfoy,” he shot back, but turned almost beseechingly to Zabini anyway.
“The Black family home.”
, moving like oil under silk, a lean ripple that made Draco’s throat all the drier.
“I shouldn’t have needed to,” Potter bit back, and Draco was unreasonably pleased by the flush of colour on the other boy’s pale cheeks.
Pansy nodded, already deep in a rather one- sided conversation with Blaise about the exact shade of brown of the Quidditch player’s eyes.
Draco didn’t need to look right to know that Potter and Longbottom were inching hopefully towards one another.
Harry swallowed a mouthful of hot liquid, coughing, and said, “Who d’you think you’ll be playing in the final?”
. If I wanted a fucking lecture on politics—”
Gryffindor.
, Draco thought in bewilderment.
Blaise grinned. “It’s karma. Or like, fate. The universe is telling you that you should’ve gotten with him at Hogwarts. This is course- correction. Go flirt with him.” He sat back expectantly, eyes wide and flicking towards Potter’s back.
Ginny sat up slowly, illumination like a breaking wave on her face. “You cannot be fucking serious, Harry,
- reaped a benefit for us. I’m not seeing a benefit.” He craned his neck obnoxiously, peering into the distance as though looking for something, and then turned to Draco. “You seeing a benefit, Draco?”
Draco looked back at Blaise. “That’s…”
“Yes, Draco, you were,” she said prissily.
Anyway, he certain he was going to Muggle Studies. The way there, however… he was not certain of.
“Yes, actually, but we’re, um…” Pansy leaned into the woman, voice lowering.  “Silver guests?”
“Upset? About what?” Draco asked incredulously.
He turned to Ron.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************
“Hang on,” Harry interrupted, “which look was this?”
“How d’you know I use any?” Harry said indignantly.
“In what way is that the same? That was in
“No, you’re alright, Malfoy,” she continued. “I’ll see you in Muggle Studies.”
Harry sighed. “Yes, Ron. I thought he was hot.”
Zabini rolled his eyes furiously, so hard Draco honestly thought they might just stay stuck up there, pupils swooping up into his beautifully sculpted brows.
“Provocative!” Harry rounded on her in defence of his treasured skinnies. “They’re not
Harry looked at her. “It’s an upmarket place I’m going to, you know, not a stripper joint.”
“I’m just saying,” Blaise shrugged. “Kind of hypocritical for you to give her shit about dating the Weaslette when you were gagging for Potter’s golden—”
With an exhausted sigh, he heaved himself off the wall, and staggered slightly, unbalanced by the sodden weight of his robes.
Shock. Shock at Potter’s response. Sure, he’d been suggestive. But to get a blush so very prettily rosy… well, Draco was extra Slytherin- sure he’d struck a chord somewhere.
Weasley gestured miserably to the patch of dingy dungeon floor just hidden by the corner of their work bench, and Draco went, breath coming sluggishly and blood pumping.
There was a hot, desperate feeling clutching at Harry, sending waves of prickles rolling over him like a tide. He stared hungrily at Malfoy, who looked rather like someone had just kicked him in the balls. An urgency coursed through Harry, as though every second the taxi driver stared at them impatiently, he was losing the other. He clenched his teeth, foot tapping anxiously. His breathing harshened, and then, as a quiet exhale, he bent towards the driver.
Ron grinned, a wide, toothy smile stretching over his face.
He turned a little sterner suddenly, and everybody stood straighter. “However, it can be rather dangerous when partners fall out, and their anger is strong enough for the potion to exacerbate to violent levels. You did drop the Kneazle saliva, did you not, Mr Weasley?”
Pansy shrugged. “Actually, this is the restaurant’s busiest—”
shirt.”
“Ah!” Draco clutched his heart with his non- chopstick- holding hand. “So brutal. No thought for the feelings of us poor peasants.”
Could it work?
He realised he should probably say something, His mouth felt curiously dry as he opened it; he licked his lips and took a breath. “I- I won’t.”
“Malfoy, Malfoy,” Potter was murmuring it, curling into his shoulder, and then his lips were at Draco’s collarbone. He wanted to go slack, let his hands push into Potter’s luscious hair, maybe pull—but they were in public, damn it, and Draco let out a growl that rumbled from his chest to vibrate through the dark- haired boy’s body.
the Lucius Voice murmured disappointedly, and, oh goody, it was back, and Draco would not be maudlin, not with his father’s voice in his head.
“And then,” Professor Flitwick continued breezily, “Mr Zabini, Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter.”
Sadly, this was the most alive Draco had felt in years.
Draco looked up angrily, head still spinning. Blaise Zabini glared down at him.
“Thank you, Professor. I am.” He opened his mouth as if to add something, but seemed to reconsider. Nodding slightly, he turned back to Draco and allowed himself to be led from the office.
“Pansy, you never…”
Harry bit his lip, nosed forward slightly, and with an exhale of something like surrender, he pressed his face into the crook of Malfoy’s neck, breathing into it softly. His hand loosened on Malfoy’s cheekbone, sliding down to grip at his black shirt.
************************************************************************************************************************************************
“That’s beautiful, Ginny,” Hermione breathed, misty- eyed and vaguely sugar- hazed. Even from the loveseat, Harry could smell the lingering scent of pumpkin- spice Butterbeer clinging to her skin.
“Well, it definitely looks like you’ve just, uh, done stuff.”
Potter raised his dark head, eyes seething.
“I don’t think we can…”
“God, ohhhh, fucking Christ.
**********************************************************************************
But he was angry, and he didn’t care- something about their proximity made Draco reckless. “Not here? Then where, Potter? Where do you want it?” He lowered his voice suggestively, obnoxiously, and leaned in even closer, and then Potter was blushing deeply and drawing back, and a thrill shot down Draco’s spine, a thrill of the sort he’d never felt before. There was something else, too.
A chill of horror stroked Harry’s spine.
“If I’m thanking anything, it’s the boots,” he muttered, and Harry laughed outright, nodding slowly.
Unsurprisingly, Draco immediately felt horribly drunk, legs weak and head so light he felt as though he were floating.
With that, she resumed the slow climb up the stairs.
Harry exhaled, mouth tipping up in a half- smile. “It’s impolite to interrupt when somebody’s thinking.”
There was a gasp from Potter, a sort of inhaled, snatched- off whine, and then, with a force that seemed to almost topple him, he pulled himself off Draco, straightening minutely within the tight circle of his arm.
“Shall we?” He gestured to the entrance to McGonagall’s office, pushing himself up off the wall and grabbing Potter’s bag from their feet. He offered it to the other boy by the strap, and Potter stared at him for a second before accepting. Their knuckles brushed as the bag slid onto Potter’s shoulder, a fleeting graze of skin, and Draco clenched his stomach not to inhale sharply.
“You.” Malfoy walked further into the kitchen, leaning back against a counter with his arms crossed. “You could’ve lived here. In a different place to your friends.”
“Look, Potter—”
“Fucking Christ,
Pansy looked amazed at how he was withstanding the plea of such a loveable animal. But Draco was different. Draco was strong, hard, unyielding. Cold as ice. Draco wouldn’t-
“I don’t think I will, Malfoy. What I meant was only you, the oblivious, snooty as fuck
After the passageway, he couldn’t see further into the recesses of the restaurant, but he assumed there’d be a corridor with the witches’ toilets at one end and the wizards’ at the other. Other magical species would be somewhere in the middle. Harry fought down a burst of anxiousness. Which way would he have to go? Right or left? His belly twinged.
Draco hated anyone being a possessive little shit with Potter. Hated it absolutely. But maybe… maybe that was because he’d branded Potter’s name on himself every damn time he came to the image of him looking up through those dark lashes, ingrained Harry Potter so deeply on his subconscious that, in a twisted way, he’d always seen Potter as, well.
this entire exchange had been so fucking bizarre, and why was Draco turned on?
There was a pregnant pause.
A broom cupboard.
Hermione sniffed. “You were sloppy. Your shirt was untucked.”
Potter turned around, shoulder curving as he looked behind him, and it was so fucking stupid that Draco’s fingers immediately flooded with adrenaline, started to tremble. Potter’s eyes went wide, wide and green, and his eyebrows flicked up. It wasn’t a hard expression, a part of Draco noted anxiously, not icy. As though he remembered the hospital wing. But there was a wariness there, and Potter’s eyes flitted to his right briefly, landing on where the Weaslette had turned with him and was staring baldly at Draco.
Blaise was catatonic, blinking slowly at the revelation. Then, he exploded with the force of a minor atomic bomb.
He leant over to Blaise.
and faced Draco. His hands- Draco refused to look too closely at them- gripped the armrests firmly, fingers splayed and white- knuckled. His legs were spread wide and his pelvis canted forward almost suggestively, though he knew it was not on purpose, just for balance.
“Please,” he said, still smirking. He removed his hand slowly, and Draco stood stiffly by his side, trying to remember how to breathe normally. “I wouldn’t screw us over like that, Malfoy. McGonagall gave us the password for emergencies. And she must be out now. We can wait here for her.”
Intoxicated as he was, even Draco could tell what he’d stumbled into. He gaped up at them, a hard lump of something sticking in his throat that he could not seem to speak around. He did not look at Potter. His pulse thrummed frantically in his ears, and one thought was slamming itself repeatedly into the walls of his brain.
Draco thought it was obnoxious behaviour, and he had a good mind to tell Potter so.
“What’s that supposed to—“
Draco glanced at the front page, bewildered- and froze, short of breath suddenly.
He was sitting at the small desk beside his bed, staring down at a piece of paper, ink pot glistening at him tauntingly. He’d been trying to write for the past hour and a half, and the only two words on the paper were:
“No, no, no,” she chirped happily, “my oatmeal doesn’t agree with me. Must be the excessive fibre.”
“Don’t use that toilet,” she said weakly. “I’d like to take this opportunity to officially name it my morning sickness toilet.”
Draco shifted under the covers, his mind drifting unerringly back to his most recent visit to the showers
“—or your parents, Draco, super close to the Dark… ah, him, and kind of tense as a result.”
Weasley, who was at least two inches taller than him, stepped back and ran a hand through his thick ginger hair.
It hit him like the Hogwarts Express; the memory of searing flame licking high just below him, waves of intense heat rolling up and soaking his shirt with sweat, pasting his hair to the nape of his neck. Hands like vices around whatever pieces of crap he could find a grip on; fingers sliding and straining, hauling himself higher on the precarious tower of rubbish collected in that accursed Room. Potter, a sleek, dark- haired arrow, soaring towards him, bent low over the broom. His eyes had burned into Draco’s, and even with unadulterated terror pounding through his veins Draco had been arrested by their intensity. He’d reached a hand up, clawing at the hot, thick air, fear a tangible taste in the very breaths he drew in.
It was with a shuddery exhale that he turned to the front of Grimmauld Place, closed his eyes, and visualised the house. And then, with a great rumbling slide of bricks, numbers thirteen and eleven were shunting aside, and number twelve bloomed in the middle, stones somehow more weathered- looking than the rest.
“Help me! These two,” he shot Ron and Hermione, who were clutching their sides from laughter by now, a filthy look. “Are useless. What shirt shall I wear?”
“What?” Blaise and Draco groaned in unison.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Not to be a cheesy fucker, but I’d have thought it’s obvious why.”
Blaise grinned. “Age before beauty.”
Well, that just ruined everything. Trust fucking Potter to have a Saviour complex big enough to actually encompass Draco. It made him want to retch, and cry, and write about seven more letters to Pansy, because his cursive was getting sloppy. Lucius would not approve.
he snapped, scowling.
Malfoy was climbing in, talking to the driver, one long leg still sprawled out of the door. Harry, sitting dazedly in the cab, tried to catch his breath, focus on something. The throbbing in his stomach did not abate, sharpened to something almost painful as he stared at Malfoy’s pink mouth, shaping words his brain slid over like so much impure water. He was jolted half- back to reality by the sound of Malfoy’s voice.
Harry turned, shoulders back, refusing to appear anything but completely ordinary, and brushed past a short wizard pushing open the door. The sudden proximity of the other man made him flinch inadvertently backwards into the door, which hit him hard on the arse as it swung closed. He yelped, catching a glimpse of the wizard’s alarmed expression through the gap in the door before it slammed, and he turned sheepishly round to face the whole bathroom.
“Spit it out, Weasley!” Draco barked, losing his patience.
“I hate when you change the subject onto my love life. Ok, fine. Fucking relentless. But remember, you have no right to laugh at this story because it reaped a really big benefit for you two as well.”
“That wasn’t a problem when I said it was maroon!” Harry yelled.
Was he honestly doing this? He was going to tell Pansy everything? Draco tried to pull his hand away from the parchment, take a second to think about what he was doing, but something that had been wound tight deep in his gut stopped him. It needed to be loosened. He couldn’t not tell her now that he had begun. The prospect of finally unburdening himself was too sweet.
Across the table, Ron was doing much the same thing. Hermione, however, was sat comfortably in an armchair beside the fire, knitting needles clacking before her, a fat book resting in her lap.
And- Potter?" Draco said, feeling as though he had to get it out quickly or he'd die of the burning feeling that was snaking through his body at the sight of those eyes on him.
Blaise eyed Draco silently, mouthing, "good boy." Draco gave him the finger, and all three of them held back laughter. Something about Mrs Finchman’s slightly random manner was hilarious to witness.
Draco giggled feebly, and Flitwick passing, muttered a Sobriety Charm in his direction.
Speaking of… Draco’s ears pricked up. He heard the faint swish of robes around the corner, light feet. It
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco did, at least, have Quidditch, where the team respected the fact that they needed him enough to let him alone. He was captain, so they couldn’t have kicked him out of the team themselves, but they were when all was said and done Slytherins. If they wanted him off the team, there were several ways to push him towards quitting. But they had decided, instead, just to be politely frosty. It was really the best he could hope for, Draco reflected. However, he still liked to stay in the changing room showers until they were all gone. Walking out in a towel- the most hated person in school, completely vulnerable- might have been just too much temptation for the team to resist. And Draco would have hated to be expelled for breaking a few arms.
“I’m here for… I get these things,” Potter began, and breathed in slowly. “The Muggles call them panic attacks. It’s post- traumatic stress disorder. After Voldemort. When we were… when I was trying to fight him, I used to get these nightmares, dreams of where he was and what he was doing, Often, it was torture. Now he’s gone, I have those dreams over and over, and sometimes – not always – but sometimes, I wake up and I can’t breathe from the panic of it all. I think he’s going to come back stronger, and this time everyone I love will be killed. It’s mad, obviously.” His voice shook, and Draco’s fists clenched.
Pansy pressed her lips tightly together, and Draco could see she was trying not to giggle.
He got like this sometimes when he was by himself in new spaces, forced to interact and be confident, sociable, easily talkative like other people were. It had crept up on him the past few months, made drastically worse by the long summer break after the two intense years of Auror training. When he had been around Ron in the working week, he was generally stable. If he had any little relapses he could just stick close to Ron, but he was normally able to talk to other people and he’d be ok. But these past months of hanging out only with their tight little circle of friends who were either living in or constantly visiting the Burrow had seen him slide inexorably backwards into a place he’d never been before. His little ‘anxiety irregularity,’ as Hermione called it, had escalated into a full- scale (though undiagnosed) problem. He now found it incredibly hard to be around other people, whether they were strangers or even just people he didn’t see often.
Zabini, beside him, looked spooked. He half- turned to Draco and put his hand on his arm, warm profile outlined by the bright white of the walls.  “Malfoy… you know, maybe we should come back…”
He thought he would have come there pretty quickly, hips held possessively by Malfoy’s large, insistent hands, shirt sliding up to bare skin that Draco was looking at like he wanted to lick it up. But just as Harry opened his lips on a desperate moan, caught up in Draco’s lips, the other man pulled back.
Draco coughed and spluttered, too shocked to move.
to do that, exactly, but there was the spark of anger that he knew was definitely his, oh yes, and then there was something else just… building on that, creating a ball of fury in his chest like he’d never known before.
He refrained.
It still made him cringe to this day.
Draco stood looking after him, hands loosely at his sides, lips still parted as though to spill his secrets into whoever would have them. He was utterly unguarded.
Entirely possible, given the fact that he was a nervous wreck.
A firm grip landed on his arm. He looked up, and barely suppressed a yelp. Pansy’s delicate face, dark eyebrows and fine lips were inches away from his own, incisors bared in a fierce expression.
“…oh,” was all Draco said, carefully neutral. To tell the truth, he would have screamed ‘ha- ha- ha’ in Zabini’s face, but he was far too interested in finding out about his relationship with Potter to break this new bond.
“Yeah,” Pansy continued, “’cause—”
Which, really. That was the whole problem, wasn’t it?
This was too much. This confusion was too much, not knowing was too much.
“No!” Ron protested. “No, I don’t- it’s not that, I don’t care, Harry, you know I don’t,” and he looked up anxiously at Harry as though he was checking Harry knew he was not, in fact, homophobic.
“I—you’re the same—you haven’t grown?” it came out as a strange half- question, and in hindsight it was definitely not the best thing Draco could have said.
And he probably didn’t, Harry realised. He and Bellatrix had visited Grimmauld Place the summer after fifth year; when he, Hermione and Ron had been living here, Kreacher had completely cleaned the place up.
“Well who did then? Who else was in with the fucking psychotic mask- wearers so much he became one of them?”
to do anything for you, aren’t they? It took Weasley about two weeks until he was kissing your golden boots." Draco made his voice soft, commiserating. "Oh, how does Granger feel about that?”
After a few agonising seconds, he cleared his throat, making his voice soft. “Potter.”
“Wha—” he spluttered. “You can’t—I just asked
“Well, why does it matter?” She laughed.
It had just been… a really fucking long night. The only thing he wanted was to get fucked until he wasn’t thinking about anything at all, until their sweat burned off his anxiety and self- consciousness. He wanted Malfoy above him, caging him in, inside him.
Draco and Blaise froze, mouths hanging open.
to be- the fucking Chosen One, he could just blatantly not pay attention.
There was a sigh from somewhere in front of him that gusted past Draco’s ears, and then came the familiar, characteristic sucking feeling that came only from a Sobriety Charm.
They stared at each other across the kitchen. Harry was hyper- aware of Malfoy’s hands braced behind him on the counter; the experienced dueller in him wanted to see them in front of him, visibly empty; the rest of him just wanted them. He felt strung incredibly tight, tense. Waiting for one of them to make a move.
Ginny carried on. “There was one girl who stared right back at me, and she made, like, the exact same expression, only I was in about fifth year, so I was still kind of skinny and had a messy ponytail and the remains of acne, but this girl was sixth year, and mature at that, so she was freaking gorgeous. The way she was quirking her eyebrow, just like me… it felt like she was taking the piss, but not really? I was so attracted to that. And I can still feel the way I swallowed, hard, and my tongue felt thick, and I couldn’t look away, especially from—and I couldn’t for the life of me explain why—her neck, which was exposed on one side ‘cause her hair was pushed to the right. And it was really slim, and pale, and I could see her delicate jawline, and the point where the fullness of her mouth pressed into the sharp curve of her cheek, and it was so lovely.” Ginny sounded dreamy, and even Ron wasn’t gagging or looking away. There was something mesmerising about the whole story.
There was silence, and Draco felt the nerves force his mouth open once more.
And, fuck. That stung.
Salazar, they’d been doing this for years! And now Potter was wounded? Draco swallowed the liquid remorse trickling like a bitter river down his throat.
Hermione frowned. “Really? I don’t remember that bit.”
“I won’t tell anyone, Zabini,” Draco said quietly, and he meant it. “I can keep a secret.” He shot his left forearm, imprinted with the Dark Mark, an amused glance. “Obviously.”
Draco smirked. “Told you.”
“That’s because you were shit- faced!” Draco protested. “I was the only coherent one out of the three of us, and I’d drunk the most. I will not,” he crossed his arms, “will
Hope everyone enjoyed it! Please leave feedback etc- I'm tired as hell right now and my eyes are literally sliding shut so I'll be back in the morning. Peace out lovelies :))
She nodded.
So he spent the next twenty minutes trying to push the key in further, because Pansy had once said something about all the pins in a lock needing to be pushed the right way, and maybe there were more pins that hadn’t been pushed, so he pressed the little key practically all the way in, and then he broke it, and coincidentally that was when Draco’s patience broke too.
“Not so fast, pal. I want dessert.”
Draco shoved his hands back into his pockets. “No, I just… no.”
“Sorry, Pans, no promises,” he shrugged.
A wave of tenderness enveloped Draco, the like of which he’d never felt before. He wanted, more fiercely than he’d ever experienced, to stroke back the feathered chaos of Potter’s dark, silken hair, to curl up next to him and fit their bodies together, breathe softly over the gold- stained expanse of his cheek.
Harry licked his lips nervously, bending forwards, and he was breathing hotly over the tip, gazing up at Malfoy through his lashes, waiting for a reaction.
“Sorry, right, so- Harry. I’ve made some of that oatmeal you like, so I guess that’ll be fine? You boys leave your wands up here; Ron, your mum didn’t like wands at the table and neither do I.”
“Tea?” Malfoy mocked.
Harry twisted sharply to stare over his shoulder, suddenly paranoid. What if someone was watching him? What if they’d seen him going into the bathroom, and set up an Extendable Ear, or they were wearing an Invisibility Cloak, or, or—
But Draco could handle it.
“Different?” Draco offered gently.
“Okay,” Draco said quickly. “I’ll see you then?” It was tentative, but Potter smiled softly, the right corner of his red lips lifting infinitesimally, and taking Draco’s heart with it.
a hardship to have you here. Not- not at all. I said it because I wanted—you just seem, sometimes, like I can’t—”
“What?” Ron demanded, looking around the room with an accusatory expression on his face. “
“No.” Draco said.
“Fucking turn around, Malfoy,” Zabini said impatiently, looking as though his mind were whizzing a million miles a minute.
“You’re right. It
Pansy waved him away. “The wand is an extension of the self.”
“Pansy?” He said excitedly. “You here?”
Pansy gulped. “Uh.”
Wait.
And after that Draco had to keep laughing, had to carry on because it was just fucked- up enough to be funny, and he didn’t have anything against the ‘Puffs but God- imagine
Zabini saw the realisation dawn on his face, and before Draco could blush or move or stammer out a reply, he cut him off.
“I don’t think it’s the charm, Pans,” Draco interjected. “Salazar knows that wears thin quick enough. I reckon it’d be more helpful to hit him with a Stinging Hex, warp up his pretty face.”
Granger turned to look back at her boyfriend- Draco gagged mentally- whereupon Weasley straightened, forced a smile, and nodded at her nonchalantly. She beamed back, and turned obliviously back towards the unfortunate Bookly, who was completely unaware that his chances of being hit by a Conjunctivitis Curse in the immediate future were rising exponentially every second. Draco watched first amusedly, and then wearily as Weasley shifted right, then left, and, looking desperately around for someone upon whom to relieve his feelings, landed his gaze on Malfoy. His jealous expression shifted to one of ugly vindication, and Draco knew he was about to bear the brunt of Weasley’s slights. Not for the first time, he cursed the fact that Granger, who had seemed like a hopeless case in first year with her buckteeth and bushy hair, had discovered how to skilfully- he had to admit- make use of her feminine wiles. Most of the boys had fucking crushes on her now.
“Maybe, sir,” he replied politely, tone thinly doubtful.
He walked over to the window, leaning over the sink to press his nose against the glass, face alarmingly close to the owl’s.
He rolled his eyes.
Draco thought offhandedly,
“Seems right, don’t you think, given you’ve hoovered up three- quarters of the meal?” Draco smirked. His fingers were restless, sliding over his expensive Muggle watch, toying with the tablecloth, smoothing over his suit trousers.
Something was, by now, niggling in the back of Draco’s mind.
“She was meant to, yeah.”
Harry grinned. “Yeah, mate, I know.”
“Bloody hell, Ron!” he gasped.
But it
He swayed suddenly, sharp words melting like snowflakes on his lips, burned up by the heat of his skin. He swallowed, pressing a hand to his forehead.
“Same,” Harry yawned. “Bu’ I also really thought the Chudley Cannons were a decent team back then.”
“Well, wouldn’t want to disappoint.” His lashes flickered downwards slightly, and
He tilted the half- inch forward to Draco’s left ear, voice a sensuous brush on his jawbone, his earlobe, his temple…
“What are you asking me?”
Moronic.
him? Or was he looking for a friend?
Pansy took out a Knut from his wallet, put it carefully in the owl’s pouch, and gave it a pistachio. The tawny hooted happily, ruffled its feathers and took flight, veering clumsily out of the kitchen and down the corridor, to where Blaise was holding the front door open for it.
It was Potter.
“A botched jinx- maybe a Headache Hex or a Fever Spell, I can’t be sure,” Professor Flitwick said grimly. “You should be alright now, Mr Malfoy. How are you feeling?”
But he hadn’t begged, had he?
Draco looked up at the students surrounding him, and just behind them, to where Professor Slughorn was just tucking his wand back in the breast pocket of his waistcoat.
Zabini snarled. “I was referring to you.”
It was weak at best, but Potter swallowed and stepped back, and Zabini scowled in an angry- supermodel sort of way.
“Look, Nott, I’m not telling you shit! We’ve hung out a bit this term, but frankly we barely spoke before that. I don’t know you that well, and for you to just demand things of me, pin me to a wall, and fucking—”
“Sorry, Ron, it’s just I…” her slim hand went to her belly, heavily rounded now. “I get these mood swings sometimes.” She looked a little uncertain, which was understandably uncommon, considering she’d spent her entire school career juggling saving Harry and Ron and being constantly right.
The boys slipped quietly into action, adjusting their hands in their pockets, fingers tense with anticipation. Ron furrowed his brow, and Harry could see him concentrating on his magical core. He was wandlessly Accioing their wands from upstairs. The problem was that he still couldn’t do wandless magic non- verbally, so as Ron opened his lips to whisper the Summoning Spell, Harry started coughing loudly, hacking into his sleeve with practiced ease. It took about forty seconds for their wands to come whizzing into the kitchen, and they caught them deftly, hiding them under the table where they couldn’t be seen.
And tell her what? That you’re obsessing over some writing on the wall of the Quidditch showers? Part of his brain demanded mulishly.
She broke off with a sudden laugh like a streak of silver, darting through the air too quick to savour.
“No, no…” Ron trailed off. “I was actually talking about the…” he made a vague gesture that seemed to encompass Harry’s skinnies.
Malfoy stared up at him from the floor, mouth red and eyes completely dark. His pupils were dilated, black swallowing up grey, and the sight of him made Harry’s cock throb desperately. He was still so fucking hard, and Malfoy cupped his erection through his boxers, gaze reverent.
“You could’ve,” Malfoy interjected, and he sounded genuinely curious.
Draco must have written it. But his Malfoy curiosity made his fingertips itch. Prove it, his mind screamed. Prove you wrote it.
Because this could only end badly, for Draco and whatever poor sod was writing this shit.
. You guys might not even be compatible. And then,” Pansy’s fingers came up to grip his chin. “You. Move. On.”
Potter cut him off with a hand over the mouth. It smelled of soap and salt.
His breath was coming slowly, deeply, and even as he felt pure arousal rush to his crotch he could feel his eyelids dropping lower, hazy visions of Potter’s legs spread, spread, spread, arse pushed pleadingly, desperately up, replaying in his mind’s eye.
Which, by the way, had
“Point is, we won’t make fun anymore. We fully support your relationship with the Weasl—uh, Ginny. Honestly.” Blaise’s voice evened out and regained some of its usual liquid charm.
know, then? What is it that you and Potter have that means you can know and not me?” He demanded, hot anger rising in him. It might have been ludicrous to anyone except Zabini, because to everyone else Draco hated Potter. But Zabini knew… everything, as far as Draco could tell, and he didn’t bat an eyelash at the question.
“You don’t need anyone’s help, do you, Malfoy? You’re invincible, untouchable, never deign to ask anyone for anything.”
“—was because in that thirty- second conversation we had, I never connected with anybody more. I was surprised when it happened because… I, well, we know her. It turns out she, ah,” Pansy cleared her throat. “She actually went to Hogwarts. Year below us. I just, uh, never really talked to her. Guess I was prejudiced.”
His head whirled with an indistinct mixture of poignant green eyes, alive and sharp and deep as wells, and black scrawls of writing burned onto a glistening wall. Irrefutable. Raven hair, curling with sweat and lyrics just teetering on the edge of painful. Pale smooth skin and hot water and white tiles and blushes.
“Because we all want to know, Harry. You’ve never told us this,” Hermione said sternly, and Harry couldn’t resist that voice, he’d spent years learning to
Draco paused.
” he said, maybe a bit too viciously, but why the fuck not? The complete and utter shock from Potter's recent leaping out of the closet harshened his words even more, and they were like knives in the quiet of the cupboard.
Draco thought uncharitably, and then felt bad. It wasn’t crap; not the theory, at least. The lessons… well, the lessons would bore even a Niffler with a grain of sense.
“The front page, Malfoy. I swear to Salazar, I won’t stand for it. If you had anything to do with this…” he spat, gesturing hotly at the paper.
A discovery in the Quidditch showers and an unburdening of one blond Slytherin's troubles by the magic powers of quill and ink.
Pansy cast him a faintly disgusted look, sliding the brassy tureen of rice towards him with a delicate hand. Her chopsticks were balanced impeccably between two fingers, roughly rounded nails grazing the slim wooden sticks.
?” He asked, and his voice was so fucking gravelly, two octaves deeper than his usual pitch. It sent a grating murmur down Harry’s spine, and he squirmed happily. The hurt evaporated. He licked his lips slowly, watched Malfoy’s eyes trace the movement. He grinned.
“I always did take you for a ditchee on a date, Potter.”
“You don’t understand,” Zabini muttered. “He’s delicate.”
“Okay.” Pansy tucked a piece of hair behind her ear, silky strands snagging slightly on her roughly- filed nails. She took a shallow breath, and started.
“Wait, you
“No? I didn’t think so. So I would say,” and Draco leant forward, drunkenness leaching out of him as though he’d never had anything at all, “that you should maybe shut your trap about things regarding ‘only me’.”
There was a cough from just beside him. Draco looked to his right to see Theo Nott standing back, blushing slightly and shifting nervously from side to side.
Yes, he thought. Definitely him, and he was nearing the bend, rounding the corner—
“Don’t say it like that!” Pansy snapped suddenly, swallowing a huge mouthful so quickly it looked painful.
Pansy cut him off. “I didn’t want to worry you. But my point was, I got lulled into a false sense of familial security when we were younger, so I was seriously blindsided when they moved to different fuckin’ countries.” She rubbed the back of her neck, looking sheepish. “I didn’t take it too well. I decided I needed to get away, so I fabricated an excuse of sorts, to like. Pretend I was going out of the country for something.”
“I didn’t mean to!” Blaise protested, eyes wide and innocent.
Pansy and Blaise had never let him forget it since.
“Okay, fine,” Ginny said, rolling her eyes, and she visibly sobered, concentrating past the Firewhisky buzz, narrowing her eyes and raising one brow slightly in a quizzical, lightly sarcastic way.  Her mouth quirked up in a half- smile, and Harr could imagine her exactly at age fifteen, icy and fine- boned, hot disdain evident in every clean swoop of her face.
The other man’s eyes squeezed shut for a half- second. “She inherited it automatically. Before you and Dumbledore removed her from the magical equation.”
He cut himself off, looking down. Draco bit his lip.
“Brilliant.”
Harry put his tongue in his cheek, considering. “No, not really, though,” he said eventually. “I mean, I suppose I never gave it a load of thought, but… I wouldn’t have wanted to.”
But who even cared?
“Why,” she began, and took a deep breath. “Why does that matter?” There was an obstinacy in her tone that made Harry wonder briefly if she’d prepared this argument beforehand.
Oh God.
He stepped closer, mouth clumsy. “Are you ok?”
He wasn’t sure it was reciprocated. The kiss outside had been fucking amazing, doubtless, but the house being Grimmauld Place had thrown Malfoy. Was still throwing him. Harry could feel it, could feel hostility jabbing at Harry’s back like glass. Sex was probably out of the question. Tea was… even less likely.
He took a deep breath.
“Didn’t like it, huh?”
So Draco tucked his legs up underneath him on the battered leather of the couch, socked feet curling in, as the faint drumming of rain on the lake echoed down through gallons of darkened water, drifting through the thick panes of the common room’s underwater windows and lulling his eyes half- shut. He sighed quietly, magic still sparking in his mind’s eye, and fell asleep as the last embers in the grate went out.
Was he trying to make it as obvious as possible that he knew Potter was lying?
Zabini was worse- he kept
He was desperate not to let his vulnerability show. God. What if Malfoy said he didn’t want it? What if he said he’d never liked Harry before? What if he—
They were talking about love, because that’s the best subject when one is day- drunk.
There was a general flurry around the classroom full of students, all of whom were staring at Draco, as Professor Flitwick came briskly into the room, levitating a tottering pile of NEWT level Charms textbooks. When he saw Draco reeling in his seat, the pile came crashing to the floor. Flitwick ran to him, bending over to feel his face and lifting his wrist to listen to his pulse. Draco could hear blood throbbing weakly in his ears- out of the corner of his darkening vision he made out Zabini, scowling down at the whole scene. Flitwick, small wand raised, muttered a short incantation, twirling his wand and passing it over Draco’s forehead. Miraculously, the agony behind his eyes lessened hugely, and Draco gasped, left with a faint sense of itchiness in the region of his eyelids.
They pulled away from the curb. In silence of the back seat, Harry was suddenly stiff, knees pressed tightly together. He ground the toe of his right boot into the floor, heel high and twisting. He didn’t dare look up at Malfoy, who was equally quiet.
Draco made exactly three sentences worth of notes on the Hypocrisy Phenomenon in that lesson, and two of them were identical.
Like he was five.
But what? But nothing. The ‘but’ was meant to convey that it was alright, really, but it manifestly was not alright. Nobody had forgiven him, and he had not moved on.
cubicle, nerves writhing.
“Pansy.”
“Either way, you get off!” Hermione quipped loudly.
“Oh for—” Draco said angrily, dropping his now- cold toast with a huff and getting up. “I
“No, not this morning,” Hermione replied cheerily.
If anything, he wanted to punch Longbottom even more as he clung to Potter, talking to him for indecently long period of time for two people in different groups.
“Why,” he took a deep breath in, “the FUCK have you been hiding as Theo Nott? Huh? You couldn’t have told me? You couldn’t have told your best friend you were planning to sneak into school even though your parents don’t want you here, and that you were going to masquerade as a fucking BOY for a year? Were you just going to stay as him the whole time? Were you ever going to tell me?”
a lightweight.”
A puckered smile spread across her small, withered face. “How are you finding Oscar Wilde?”
“Come on, you fat git! Go round, it’s only a measly few metres. I’ll even open the bloody front door if you don’t want the living room window. Just—”
Draco picked up his fork and started to eat away at his rice, taking chunks of meat from the strange stew- like dish and an occasional crab. It was delicious, flavours dancing across his tongue and mingling in a vibrant, blendable harmony of spice and sweet. The three of them dug in enthusiastically; for a while, the only sound at their small table was the chinking of cutlery against china, and eventually the greedy scrapes of fork tines clearing any flavoursome debris from the very surface of their plates.
Remington and Wells gaped at him.
Draco gave a ginger half- smile, breath shallow. His fingers twisted behind his back, out of sight.
“Oh, and Mr Malfoy--?” McGonagall turned suddenly. Draco looked up. “By keep your temper in check, I ,of course, mean try to stay calm enough to cast a proper jinx. Muddled magic can have serious consequences.”
Blaise, however…
“Don’t say that,” Potter said angrily. “She… she vouched for you, when you needed it, and Godric knows she’s seen the worst of me. Don’t- don’t make out like everything’s so against you. That isn’t what this is.”
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Draco leaned forward, voice gentle.
“Yes, she was,” Draco fought, but even as he said it he realised it was the middle of term. There was no way she could have been here.
This one hadn’t even been going that badly, until the guy proved himself to be a sexist, racist twat firmly set against Muggle- borns.
he thought numbly.
Soothingly, Pansy looked just as discomfited. She kept shifting, tugging at her collar and rolling her shoulders like they were too big for her, somehow. As though she wanted to shuck off the extra pounds of muscle and bone that rendered her lean and broad and hard- edged. Theo’s jaw was particularly sharp, too, the lines of his throat spare and long, and every time Pansy turned her head her brow would furrow slightly, as though she wasn’t used to being able to turn that far. It was hilarious. Now Draco was aware of the situation, he loved watching her struggle discreetly, and though he’d die before admitting it, a secret well of warmth always spread through him at the thought that she was enduring it all for him.
“Thank you, Professor,” he said, turning to go and seizing Potter – who was standing frozen– by the elbow.
“We met at…” Zabini looked up at the ceiling in evident discomfort. He gnawed at his lip, and said nothing.
“House elf?” Malfoy asked, arching a brow and looking around at the dust.
. That’s hilarious. She never knew you stalked her, right?”
Draco gasped, feeling his forehead. It was hot, extremely hot. Theo turned back to him sharply.
“Weasley, for fuck’s sake read the instructions,” he hissed, voice low and furious.
An oddly long one, my friends-- enjoy the ride, I suppose. A lot goes on. Like seriously, uncharacteristically a lot. Hope you guys like it :))) please comment what you think.
A plume of smoke curled out from the doorway as the corridor was revealed, thin and tapering. The portraits lining the walls went on for so long that the painted faces became indistinct. A ripple of murmurs spread along the paintings; some of the inhabitants who had been snoozing awoke with a jerk to glare at Harry and Malfoy, muttering to their neighbours.
Granger was staring at him from across the classroom, one hand resting on the strap of her bag, the other drumming thoughtfully - and probably unconsciously - on her lower lip.
And that was that.
“Come on, Draco, we’re going to be laaaate!” Pansy yelled down the corridor. Blaise was by the front door, checking his lapels obsessively in the mirror on the adjacent wall and tapping his foot.
Stay cool.
Simply, it was the process of elimination.
The waiter scurried away, and Harry looked over to the bar, mentally planning his route. He’d go around that table, then that one, and then walk along the bar to the small latched door, and he’d let himself through- closing it behind him, or someone might accost him- and he’d walk down that little passageway, and—
Draco's mouth was dry; he ran his tongue over his lips in shock, taking in the scene before him.
There was a pause while Theo closed his eyes, and lifted his wand in line with his head. Then, he murmured an incantation, to low for Draco to hear, and ran the wand from his head in a sweeping motion down to his waist.
Harry swallowed, heart rabbiting in his chest. He would’ve thought giving head should’ve been the thing to make him nervous, but Malfoy kneeling there, looking like a fucking wet dream-
And Potter… damn him, Potter would never want him like that.
He buried his head in his hands. “God, I can’t do this right now! I don’t know what I…”
“Only you, Malfoy,” Potter said sardonically, and Draco nearly choked from the hypocrisy of the situation.
“Whatssamatter?” He managed, eyes bleary with sleep.
He gritted his teeth. “I’m not going to go
Draco leaned in, voice whittling to a chummy whisper. “Zabini, I always knew you’d be the woman of the relationship.”
He was snapped back to attention by the sound of Weasley, who was now trying to wring some kind of apology out of Draco for his harshness.
The other man’s breath was deliberately slow, intent dark in his eyes, and his hand tightened to mirror the desperation of Harry’s grip. Harry wanted to explode from it all, the coil of desire that saw him canting his hips forward. He was a hair away from grinding against the seat shamelessly.
Harry felt his brow furrow involuntarily, and he took another step, hands restless at his sides, wanting to reach out and touch.
Draco cleared his throat, unable to look upward into Potter’s eyes. The legs around the chair tightened imperceptibly as Potter shifted forwards, still wrapped suggestively around the bloody thing, and now Draco was fucking jealous of an inanimate object.
“But eventually, y’know, you went away, and I had a long time to figure shit out. And it wasn’t like I was unsure of what you’d say. I knew you, and by then I was pretty certain that you were, in fact, in the exact same boat as me. So we split, and I’ve never looked back. Never dated a guy again. And you never dated a girl again, did you, Harry?”
Now, of course, Draco thought firmly, he couldn’t care less about the lot of them. No- he picked up his chicken leg and resumed his slow demolition of it- the Golden Trio was no longer his concern.
He swallowed.
Harry slid back into his chair and allowed himself to go boneless. His right leg was tremoring from being clenched so stiffly, and his jaw felt wrong somehow, like the bones had been clicked out of place. He was too strung out to check the area. Instead, he just sagged on the seat, running a tired hand through the curling thickness of his hair. It beggared belief.
“Please, Malfoy,” Harry whispered, and
“WAIT!” Draco grabbed his arm senselessly, gaze trained on Potter’s. The other man’s vivid eyes went wide, mouth dropping open slightly. His eyes went instinctively to where Draco’s hand was encircling his forearm, fingers spread wide over the pale, lean expanse of his forearm.
Zabini scowled. “You can say it, you know. Dick. I can practically hear your thoughts.”
When Harry spoke, his voice was rough. “I… I don’t feel that way now, but,” he swallowed. “Maybe if I- if I met the right person I’d want to be…” He tailed off, knowing he was biting his bottom lip, unable to stop.
“Hang on… you said this happened a few months ago? When, exactly?”
He was in the midst of making himself another mug of tea when the door swung open loudly, slamming against the back wall. He turned, blinking anaemically in the low light, to see Theo Nott standing in the doorway, looking intensely determined.
wearing?”
Harry gasped into Malfoy’s mouth as his hands slid over the curve of Harry’s bum, and he ground himself instinctively forwards, letting his neck bend backwards. Malfoy kissed him harder, deeper, never letting up and allowing him only snatches of breath between their lips. As Harry swayed backwards, head weighted by desire and legs weak, Malfoy chased him, holding him up with strong hands on his arse and waist. He was fucking everywhere, and Harry was starting to grind harder, unconsciously, completely lost in it.
Draco rolled his eyes grumpily, marching over to the side door and reaching up to the high ledge above the frame, groping around for the key. He felt cold metal under his fingers, and grasped the delicate key, bringing it down. With a satisfying click, it slid into the lock, twisted smartly, and Draco reached with a grateful smile to the handle, about to turn it.
Draco met her eyes, throat rough from alcohol. His head swam, and he nodded once, jerkily, hardly believing what he was agreeing to. His legs felt shaky as he stood up, fabric clinging tightly to his lean thighs and fingers coming down to fiddle with the material of his shirt. He slid his chair back, moving out from behind it so slowly he felt like he’d been hit with a drugging spell. His blood thumped sluggishly in his ears, pulse a fluttering beat that he could feel like the panicked roll of a drum. His eyes were fixed on the wooden- panelled floor.
Draco had asked for sense, not more gobbledegook.
“Well, you know these sorts of girls. All talk. They hushed up, mainly, but there was one girl…”
Draco thought.
’ he thought contentedly, ‘
—the rest of the class would be just fine and dandy with him spreading his germs everywhere?
“Stop trying to guess from my face. I’m not telling you; there’s a reason why. Answer my question first. Why does it matter what House she was in?”
Draco looked up woozily, hair falling over his eyes, to see a blushing Finnigan standing before him, hands busy at his belt. He was on the very left of the small space, obviously having leapt away from… whoever was beside him. Draco turned his head woozily, vision refocusing just enough to make out a horribly familiar pair of green eyes, staring-
He closed his eyes, pressing the damp heels of his hands into his eyelids and trying desperately to block the headache that throbbed evilly around the backs of his eyeballs. When he lifted his hands away his eyelashes were tangled and smattered with droplets of cool water. He gave a slow blink, clearing his head, and squared his shoulders. Then, he raked a hand through his hair so it regained some of its messy charm, rumpled his shirt as artfully as he could, and set a deliberate pace out of the bathroom, opening the door carefully and striding down the dimly lit passageway. He refused to stop, check, plan; the tension in his fists and chest was invisible to anyone simply watching him, and he strolled out from the corridor behind the bar, through the gate, and around the various tables without allowing a sweat to break out on his forehead.
“Yeah, it’s actually going fine. I mean, today was a bit shit, but we were missing a couple of players, it was raining cats and dogs, and nobody was allowed any protective charms so,” she shrugged, “it was to be expected.”
Ginny gave a wry laugh. “Oh, you know what, it’s so nice, but - and I hate to say this because it’s really good, but I can only eat a certain amount of slow release, high fibre foods at the moment. It’s a special diet the coach is putting us on.” She looked regretfully at her bowl, pushing it away. “I don’t think I can have any more.”
“I think I speak for both Draco and myself when I say- what the hell does that mean? You
“Unfortunately, the potions can’t be restored, but I think you’ve all gotten the idea of it, haven’t you?” He looked around the class, all of whom were glaring at either Weasley or Draco in blame.
,” Draco snapped irritably.
Finnigan broke in with an angry, “hey!” which Draco completely ignored, “— looking like I’ve just gone a round with a pissed- off Skrewt, and my trousers basically down around my
And so, as Draco reread the textbook page for the fiftieth time, he decided something crucial.
His fingers stilled on the table as a group of three walked through the golden doors to the Great Hall, and he looked at them through his hair, gaze searching, but they were too small, too skinny. There was no shocking mop of red hair among them, no brown-gold curls, and the dark-haired boy didn’t even have green eyes, as far as Draco could see. They sat at the Hufflepuff table, and he exhaled shakily, his palms flattening out on the table. He let his head hang, eyes fluttering closed exhaustedly. God, he was tired. He and Pansy had stayed up late talking and planning, and his eyelids felt heavy, his tongue thick and clumsy. The nerves coursing through him were making him unbearably jumpy, too, and he felt like he might snap at any second.
“Cheer up, Weasley, I didn’t actually hit you, did I?”
McGonagall eyed them shrewdly, glasses glinting in the bright light from above her desk. She was sitting, now; they’d moved over to her desk about three minutes ago, when Draco had gotten around to explaining about the reason for their visit- the friendly Quidditch match. The five minutes previously had been devoted to stuttering half- truths as to why he and Potter had ended up pressed together, centimetres away from snogging and half- hard against her fireplace. Draco had been horribly paranoid the whole time that
Draco strode out of the classroom, brushing past Finch- Fletchley, who was stumbling around in a drunken stupor, fourth Lucidity Charm apparently too weak. He did not look back, not when Professor Flitwick called after him, not when the door slammed, and not when vicious green eyes burned in his memory.
Draco smirked. “No surprises there.”
Draco felt a wave of emotion slam into him, and blinked away tears embarrassedly.
Lavender Brown, a simpering smile fixed upon her silly face, smiled back at Potter from near the front of the classroom, and sent a paper aeroplane fluttering towards him, scribbled over with a stupid little note in her feminine cursive. Potter unfolded the thing and read the message quickly, green eyes alive with humour, and he sent Brown this bright, secret grin as though they were in on a big hushed up piece of news.
,” he told himself. “
rang the Lucius Voice in his head.
With some semblance of dignity, they managed to make it to the stairwell, and then he sensed movement somehow, spine rippling to tingles- there was a voice whispering in his ear, Pansy’s voice. He half- spun, only to see the delicate bluish glow of her Patronus hovering by his shoulder.
Malfoy, with unbelievable speed, turned to face him for the first time.
“Get up, you git. You know I love kippers.”
Draco gasped indignantly. “How dare you? I am
“I’d say
Draco shook his head mutely.
“The people in Slytherin didn’t ask to be—”
“Have at it, baby.”
“Okay.”
“Sorry,” Weasley muttered, looking as far from contrite as one could possibly get. He looked at Granger for support, but the curly- haired girl was glowering at him, standing beside her empty cauldron with a wounded air.
His throat felt completely ruined, fucked raw, but he didn’t want to move an inch, even as Malfoy was coming down his throat, shuddering and threading his hands through Harry’s hair. When he gentled, slumping back against the counter, Harry finally pulled off, jaw throbbing.
Yeah, this is pretty much a trend by now so you probably all know what to expect- very little action, a coincidentally large amount of feels (it always happens by accident, dear lord) and furthering of character relationships. Enjoy, I guess? Happy reading, folks. Or not. It might be crappy :))
Later, a worried- looking Theo Nott attempted to engage him in conversation over lunch, but Draco couldn’t focus, too preoccupied with the distance between Potter and Seamus Finnigan over at the Gryffindor table. With a decidedly unhealthy sense of victory, he watched as their hands brushed over the chicken drumsticks, and Potter snatched his away like he’d been burned. Finnigan’s grey- blue eyes lowered, lashes fanning down, and Draco could have danced atop the table.
“And I gave you a hint. Which you denied. As guiltily as a sixteen year old kid.”
“Been dreaming of me, Draco?”
They looked back at him. Pansy swallowed, and gave a hesitant nod. Her lips twitched upwards. Blaise, beside her, was openly suppressing laughter. Draco lost all composure, and gave him the finger, eyes immediately tracking back to the lone, dark- haired figure at the nearby table.
Potter turned his head suddenly too, so they were eye- to- eye. His breath ghosted over Draco’s cheek, warm and soft. From this close, Draco could see the tangle of his lashes pressing into his glasses, the slight flush at the top of his cheekbones.
. Draco tried to rationalise it, tried to remind himself of the stress of a situation like that-
Maybe it was too early to be thinking about this.
What the hell had that been about?
“There’s got to be some sort of Disillusionment Charm on it!” Hermione yelled from upstairs. “It’s bloody impossible to find.”
“Right, well, that went well. Fancy a bit of lunch?"
“What— or, should I say
His legs shook a tiny bit as he walked out from behind the table, not daring to push his chair back in, and began to weave around the first table. A goblin sitting in the chair he was walking past gave a loud snort of derisive laughter, and his heart froze in his chest.
They were interrupted by a sharp clacking sound- all three of them looked up to see an obese tawny owl knocking determinedly against the kitchen window with its sharp yellowish beak.
He looked over at Ron, and cleared his throat. Ron looked up; his brown eyes were full of a sadness that could only be brought about when confronted with something like Hermione’s oatmeal. It was worse, Harry reflected, when you could practically taste the memory of Mrs Weasley’s wonderful egg sandwiches on your tongue, and smell the tang of the sharp brown sauce.
And yeah, call Draco a classic prejudiced pure- blood, but Muggles were giant idiots.
Malfoy grinned back, predatorial and intense, and his left incisor was just off- kilter. He looked like a lion, maybe, or a degree of lion that was colder, paler. More dangerous. Harry wouldn’t ever tell him, but he’d left ‘ferret’ in the dust. To call this man a ferret would be laughable- barely even worth the effort of trying.
Draco’s gaze whipped up so fast his head swam a little.
“What’re you guys talking about?” Pansy cut in, having just finished ordering.
And that stung- not that Draco was going to show Zabini that- but yeah, it hurt a bit. Because Draco wasn’t like the other Slytherin kids, children who were brainwashed at worst; victims of circumstance in a pinch. He had gone the extra step. He couldn’t be counted as a kid, or someone who was just born into the wrong family. He hadn’t been a passive bystander in the war.
He swallowed, and some dim part of his brain that was still functioning noted that Potter mirrored the action, the outline of his Adam’s Apple bobbing slightly as he ducked his dark head further.
Draco thought that maybe it was strange he didn’t even feel satisfied, or vindicated. He was only hot, and itchy, and annoyed they’d lost this much time arguing. His brain was foggy with green fucking eyes, the same pair as always, and silently he damned the inventor of the Wistful Draught. Undoubtedly a hopeless romantic. Probably a Hufflepuff too.
The sheer- shirted man sneered, and his blandly handsome face twisted into something ignorant and ugly. “Got that right.” He snatched up his coat from his chair and flung it dramatically over his shoulder, pivoting towards the staircase. Before he marched up to the ground floor, he turned for a parting shot, sticking out his arse in a way that was definitely on purpose and flagrantly unattractive.
,” Pansy corrected, rolling her eyes.
“Oh,” she said, considerably more amicably. “Good morning, Harry.”
He stepped closer, breath gentle on Potter’s cheekbone.
Good.
Pansy had abandoned him minutes previously, brushing her fingers over his and leaving for Arithmancy, the broad set of her shoulders slightly stiff under the weight of her bag. It was so odd hearing her feminine purr come out of Theo Nott’s chapped lips—
lanced through Harry until he was groaning into Malfoy’s mouth, their lips never ceasing. Harry felt Malfoy’s fingers on the buttons of his own shirt; Malfoy was smiling slightly into their kiss as his fingers slid the silken material off Harry’s shoulders, and it made Harry’s stomach explode with butterflies.
It came out quiet, spoken into the private space between them.
Draco sat bouncing his leg shallowly for at least five minutes before he felt someone squeeze his hand. The dry slide of skin over skin made him look up and do a double take; the way their fingers slotted together was incredibly familiar, so to see Theo Nott’s eyes looking at him earnestly from his right was… unnerving, to say the least.
Nott’s head whipped up, and he stared at him for a heavy second, before nodding, a hysterical laugh escaping him. His wand, which had hung limply by his side, raised, and Draco stepped back on instinct. Nott flicked him a glance and smiled, amused.
Harry blushed hotly, but did not avert his eyes, and from between them there arose a new sense of being, as though they’d wanted each for so long, been through so much, years of history had clouded their view of one another. Now, it was like they were seeing each other freshly for the first time in… God, since Harry had refused that first handshake from that pale, grey- eyed eleven year old who’d shouldered in front of him with easy, firstborn- son confidence.
Malfoy shook his head, the smirk disappearing off his lips. The look in his eyes was incredibly intense, sombre, as he stared at Harry, his exposed chest, his hair, his mouth…
