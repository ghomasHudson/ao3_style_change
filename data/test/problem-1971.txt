The elves were scattered around the kitchen, preparing for dinner service, and they all looked up at him in surprise as he stumbled in, gasping for air.
“Hang on a moment!” Ron said sharply, just as Harry was about to lead them all out to the corridor. “We’ve forgotten someone!” he announced and Draco frowned at him. The room was well and truly empty.
"Hello Grandmama," he greeted her and she smiled at him, indulgently. In the dim light, Harry could see her name plate inlaid into her frame –
“ELF!” Bellatrix screamed, righting herself and pointing her knife at the doorway to the dining room. Draco turned to see Dobby standing there, quivering but looking defiant.
“You’ll have to close your eyes to get into the wards,” she said and he paused in lifting the backpack up over his arms. “It’ll be the only time you’ll have to,” she added and he nodded.
“Go on, say it,” he urged the table at large and Bill burst out laughing. Weasley had his head in his hands and Hermione was looking a bit smug, while Dean looked bemused and Luna looked like she was restraining herself from hugging them. Potter just gave him an indulgent smile and kissed him again.
Would they succeed? Historically, Potter had always managed to get away, but only a few days ago, Voldemort had taken his father’s wand to use against Potter – and then killed Professor Burbage with it. Draco shuddered and screwed his eyes shut at the memory. Her screams…
“Look,” he whispered, and his voice was covered by the sound of Bathilda fumbling with some logs at the fireplace. Some of the photographs were moving. To Draco’s surprise, Potter reached out and snatched one up. He studied it, his eyebrows pinching together, and before Draco could see what the photo he was holding was of, Potter turned and spoke to Bathilda, who was bent over the fireplace grate, stacking the logs inside it inelegantly. Granger looked at her, despairing, before coming over to her and taking over, crouching down.
When he wasn’t being pulled into mysterious conversations with the trio, Draco helped Fleur prepare food. It was obvious that she wasn’t used to cooking for this many people, and Draco had very few kitchen skills to speak of, but they muddled through it together, chattering away in French. Fleur noted that Draco’s accent was very Marseille and he explained that his paternal grandmother had been from the region, as one of the pure-blood Bonnet family.
“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,” Granger said soothingly and Draco squeezed his shoulder slightly, acknowledging the statement. “It means… you know… living beyond death. Living after death,” she explained and Draco cleared his throat.
“I remembered. Marvolo Gaunt, I saw him in a memory – he claimed to be a descendent of the Peverells. And – he had the ring! Dumbledore’s ring! What if that was the Resurrection Stone?!” Potter exclaimed, his voice rising in pitch as he started linking things together, and Draco froze. The ring on Dumbledore’s rotting hand, the one with the black stone that seemed to never catch the light… Could it be?
“Ron’s taken her inside. She’ll be all right,” he told Harry kindly, and he nodded and turned to look back down at the body of the house-elf in his lap. Draco watched as he pulled the knife free from Dobby’s chest and then Potter shucked his jacket and laid it over him like a blanket.
!” Harry said from behind them, and Draco rolled to his feet in time to see Goyle’s wand fly out of his hand into the mound of things behind him. There was the crackle of another spell, which missed, and Crabbe whirled around, his wand outstretched, pointing to whoever had sent that last spell.
His little flat in Hawthorn wasn’t much to look at on the outside, but Harry loved the interior. Natural light flooded into the flat from the windows, and no room was ever completely dark. His books were crammed into bookshelves, and potted plants wafted their leaves lazily at him as he walked passed them (the ivy might have even petted his hair), dropping his backpack on the floor next to the kitchen.
“Well enough, I hope. I had best be going though, I’m joining Mother for dinner,” he said and Harry tried not to frown. Malfoy gave them both a small smile and wave, then disappeared into the ground flooding out of the atrium into the autumn sunset.
“They’re out there, you know,” he said, nudging a curtain with his fingers. Draco made an impatient noise and walked over to the window, his bare feet making no noise on the carpeted floor. Potter watched him approach out of the corner of his eye and jerked his chin to motion out of the window. “They’ve been here for a few days, watching us, or at least, thinking that they are.” Outside the window was dark, at least from what Draco could see, but he nodded all the same. Potter looked out of the window one more time and then tore his gaze away. “They want Hermione, you say?” he asked and Draco nodded.
“I would prefer to be in charge of all my faculties tonight,” he told her and she nodded, casting a long glance over her husband who was staring into the bottom of his wine glass like it held all the answers that had only so recently slipped through his fingers. “Has the Dark Lord arrived yet?” Snape asked, and his dark gaze flicked over Draco, who felt a chill go along his spine.
The front doors were being held open by the Aurors, who looked to be struggling against them, so they ducked inside quickly. With a shout, Team Alpha stepped away from the doors, and they quickly slammed shut, as if forced shut by a strong gust of wind.
“Sorry, I just – Wait, that was you! In third year! Out by the Shrieking Shack!” Draco pointed at him, accusatory, and Potter laughed, the cloak dropping from his shoulder. “I had nightmares for weeks!” Draco howled and even Granger giggled again. He took a step forward again, shaking his head, reaching for the cloak. “What’s it made of? Demiguise hair?” he asked and Potter took the cloak off, folding the fabric once more and putting it back into the pouch and then looping it once more over his neck.
“And now? Do you think it’s easier?” Draco asked and Potter shrugged one shoulder. He reached over, looking for a second like he was going to take Draco’s jaw into one hand, leaving Draco breathless for a second, but then he pulled back and the Snitch was struggling in his grasp.
“I hope you’re wearing enough sunscreen. You know what they say about the O-zone layer in Australia,” she cautioned and Harry bobbed his head, remembering the lectures he received when he announced he was going to be leaving England for distant shores. Hermione took her seat again and packed away her book, tucking it into the satchel bag on the floor beside her.
"Enough!" he shouted and whatever Malfoy had been about to shout died in his throat. Neville looked between them, as if he were separating two bickering children. "Now is not the time. You are both - yes, both of you, Harry-," and Harry scowled at him, "upset, we get that, honestly we do. But whatever drove you two apart years ago needs to be put on the backburner for now. You both need us to help you find the boys, and you need to let us help you as well," he said and Harry felt deflated all of a sudden. He stepped back and allowed Luna to draw him back onto the sofa, her hands firmly planted on his shoulders. Malfoy took a few steps back until he was leaning heavily against the mantle of the fireplace, and he placed a shaking hand over his eyes. The others all gave him a moment to compose himself, looking away, but Harry kept watching.
The motorbike spluttered and sparked and then the dive was no longer a controlled one, it was just gravity acting upon the motorbike, pulling it down towards the earth. The motorbike spiralled, and the red flashes of lights were replaced by green ones, not fired by Harry but by the Death Eaters which appeared out of the night sky, coming to the Dark Lord’s aid.
“Oh, good. Budge up,” Potter slurred, and Draco shuffled back against the canvas of the tent as Potter moved to lie down next to him, tugging up a blanket that had been draped over his legs. He offered his hand a bit clumsily, nearly slapping it into Draco’s side, but Draco took it anyway, curling their hands together in the awkward space between them on the bed. “Sleep,” Potter murmured, his eyes already closed, and Draco closed his eyes too.
“I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me,” he said and Draco had to interrupt.
Malfoy's grip on his hand was tight, and got tighter still as Luna spoke. Harry glanced over at him and Malfoy looked pained, his lips pressed firmly together, his brow furrowed. Harry squeezed Malfoy's hand, trying to be reassuring, though he didn't feel calm at all himself.
There was a bang two aisles over and Hermione let out a bit of a shriek, covering her head with one hand as the stacks of objects on either side of them wobbled threateningly. Draco’s heart skipped a beat but he kept moving, kept pumping his legs.
“You’ll need it for Apparating,” he said reluctantly and Draco nodded, tucking it behind his ear for safe keeping while he finished putting a final few things in his backpack.
Harry fetched a trolley while Draco enlarged the boys' trunks, and the boys helped them load their trolleys on. As they made their way down the platform, various people turned to look and point, but Harry and the boys ignored them, while Draco tried to tune them out. There had been all sorts of rumours when he and Harry had gotten back together, including some that claimed that he had bewitched Harry in some way, much like he supposedly had all those years ago, but together they had navigated them all and came out the other end, though there were still whispers that followed them everywhere.
“Bring him in, quickly!” she said in a high, quivering voice, and the group was forced up the stone steps and into the entrance hall. Draco blinked in the harsh light and then his mother was on him, patting his face, stroking back his hair. “Oh, Draco! Release him, at once!” she snapped at the Snatchers and a few of them hesitated but Greyback gave a short nod and they released Draco’s bindings, though they rebound the remaining five prisoners to each other.
"I'm aware. I may have moved to France, but I'm not completely cut off from English Wizarding society," he said. Harry studied him for a second, eyeing his face. There were now lines where once his skin had been smooth, and they all seemed to be focussed between his eyebrows - frown lines.
“Did he?” Draco asked, looking around the room. There were posters on the walls, though he couldn’t make out the details. “I would’ve heard of him then, I think. Especially over the summer… Our houseguests aren’t very kind,” he added and Potter frowned.
’ though the last date was empty. Draco’s heart pounded in his chest. Books like this were Charmed to change themselves when families they were tracking were born or died – the book could not lie. He looked up and Granger gave him a tight smile. “I bet no one ever wondered where he ended up. They weren’t an important family,” she added and Draco nodded.
“You can look. It’s not pretty, but it’s not as bad as it was,” he said and Draco tried to look at his forearm.
“Yeah, it is,” he sniffed and lifted his hand again, looking around. “Where is it, by the way?” he asked and Draco pointed to where Hermione’s bag sat next to his foot, dropped there by the owner as she staggered towards bed.
“Here,” Draco said, struck suddenly. “Take my wand, give me the other one. You always said it worked better for you anyway.” He pulled his wand free and held it out. Harry hesitated for a second before taking it, pressing the pale wood one into Draco’s hand. It felt dead in his grip, unresisting and lifeless, but Draco wanted Harry to have something of his when he – left. Harry stepped back and Draco dropped his hand to lace his fingers through Harry’s, and then they walked back through the castle.
“I’ll get it when we leave,” he said and she sniffed but took the cloak and tucked it carefully inside the bag.
,” Potter told him from over his right shoulder. “Give it a try.” Draco raised his wand and pointed it out into the clearing.
“Merlin,” Pansy breathed, somewhere between awestruck and horrified. “He’s bitten straight though his lip,”
He woke sometime later, and the tent had gone dark. Potter was still sitting next to him, glasses removed, propped up against the headboard, his head lolling down against his chest which rose and fell as he breathed. Draco tested pulling his wrist free and though the Mark grew warmer, it didn’t burn as it had previously. He nudged Potter in the side and he startled a little and then blinked sleepily down at Draco.
The room was filled with nooks and crannies for secreting things away. He would have to search them all individually. As a particularly precocious twelve-year-old, he’d spent the Christmas holidays in his second year cataloging them, and he ran through the list mentally, darting to and fro around the room.
There were a few glasses set on the table, and Harry set down his empty glass to pick up a fresh red one. He was about to turn and walk away when he spotted someone in the crowd and stilled.
“Come on,” Mrs Weasley whispered to Draco, pulling him back as Harry passed him, his focus solely on Voldemort.
“You’re not one of us,” a small Gryffindor boy said as they approached and Draco breathed through the urge to jinx him, though Blaise looked ready to go. He pointed his uninjured hand at Harry.
!” he hissed and the owl swooped out of the tip of his wand, letting out a shrill shriek that pierced the night. The Death Eaters whirled around, some of them calling out to their fellow members. But too late, because Potter’s silver stag came galloping as well, head lowered, its antlers outstretched. The owl clicked her beak at it, and it shook its antlers in return.
Draco woke up late morning to the sounds of heated discussion coming from outside the tent. He had clambered into the upper bunk soon after Potter had left him to go on watch, and he lay there for a few minutes after waking, staring up at the canvas ceiling. He tilted his head back and could see that the flap that usually separated Hermione’s sleeping area had been rolled back – she was awake then.
“Headmaster Snape asked me to fetch Malfoy for him, sir,” she murmured, her voice so quiet it barely carried across the room. Amycus scowled and tapped his stubby blunt fingers on the lacquer of his desktop before nodding once. He caught Draco’s eyes and jerked his chin in the door's direction.
Luna and Ollivander exchanged poignant goodbyes and Fleur darted forward to kiss him on each cheek, asking that Ollivander return the wedding tiara to Bill’s Aunt Muriel and handing it over. With a final wave, Bill and Ollivander disappeared out the front door.
It had taken Harry a few days to settle back into his routine in Melbourne. He spent his mornings in St Kilda’s, either at the Vineyard or at the Galleon Café, where he was regular enough that the woman behind the bar knew his usual coffee order. He read a bit, and wrote letters (to Luna, who was somewhere in the outback with her fiancé; to Neville, who had announced that he was going to take the position of Herbology Professor after Christmas; to Ron and Hermione, just letting them know he was home and settling back in). A few times, he had unfurled a blank sheet of parchment and written ‘
He blinked the world back into focus, remade it in his vision, and he was cocooned in semi-darkness, only a faint ringing in his ears. He groaned and tried to push himself up but there was a large piece of stone debris over his chest, holding him in place.
He had to wait. He didn’t know how much time had passed when the gargoyle finally turned and Harry appeared, looking pale and stunned. Draco got to his feet and it looked as though it took Harry a second to realise that Draco was standing there.
“I’m still here. We’d better get moving. I’ll follow in your tracks,” he said and she nodded. He stood behind Potter and made sure to walk in Potter’s footsteps to disguise his own prints. Potter and Granger walked arm in arm down the snowy lane, Granger hyper focused on their surroundings, but Potter looking every which way. He couldn’t stop looking around, his mouth slightly agape as he took in the cottages and their lights. Draco wondered if he knew which one had been the one he’d lived in for that brief time with his parents.
His eyes opened onto the fuzzy room again, and Potter was waiting for him, standing next to the window. Draco blinked, feeling a little dizzy at the fuzzy edges of the dream that crept into his vision. He hadn’t seen Potter in his dreams for a few weeks now, not since Potter asked him if he had known Regulus Black.
’ and I thought – what does that matter? Why does that mean she has to die?” His words were slurred and thick with tears but Potter was stroking a thumb over the curve of his knee and Draco tried to take a steadying breath.
"Quite possibly, Harry. Review your files, look for those parents whose children chose not to return to them. You may find some intriguing leads," he pushed himself out of the chair and rose to his feet, smoothing down his robes. "I have a standing appointment to play a game of cards with the Council of Wizards, 1592, so you will have to excuse me. Galileo is most insistent upon punctuality," he said and Harry began to protest.
“Dobby was already on his way out when Tizzy found him. I’d seen Potter in the mirror, in the dungeons,” Aberforth explained, then he looked around as though searching for the elf. “Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him?” he asked and Draco’s heart dropped. He slumped into an armchair opposite Hermione, who gave him a weak smile.
Surprisingly, he had even found companionship with Ron. Bill had a very old and chipped chess set and Ron had taken to playing matches in the evening, mostly with himself but after two nights of watching this, Draco had taken a seat by the black pieces and had begun to play. They didn’t talk, except maybe to curse each other, but their nightly matches drew watchers from the other inhabitants of Shell Cottage.
," he said in a quietly chilling voice, and Harry stumbled down a few more steps. Just past the landing, on the next flight down, two small boys pressed their heads together, curls tangling into fine straight locks. Harry reached for them and then fell again, straight into the waking world.
It was neatly and securely wrapped in plain brown paper, and Harry’s name and the University address was written in neat cursive on the front. Harry ran his thumb across the folds of brown paper, unwrapping a clearly old but well maintained book. His heart jumped a bit.
it,” he repeated, almost proud of himself. Draco wanted to touch him in some way, but wasn’t sure what to do.
," Malfoy said, moving a bit closer to study the image. There was a knock on the door and Ron called for whoever it is to come in - Belinda pushed the door open, a tray of tea hovering next to her, and then from behind her, Hermione walked in, followed by Ginny, Luna and Neville. They all had grim looks of determination on their faces.
“It’ll be all right. Let’s – let’s get back to the castle, if he’s gone to the Forest we’ll need to think of a new plan – Draco, can you walk?”
“Yeah… it could be…” Potter muttered and Granger let out a frustrated huff and withdrew her wand from the inner pocket of her jacket, lighting it without a word. Even by the light from the wand, the stone was still barely legible, but even so, Granger pointed it at the stone.
It was Blaise. His face caught the firelight, shining golden, and his expression was a picture of disgust and horror.
Ever since Draco had woken up from the dream last night, curiosity had been gnawing at him, and he took the opportunity of silence to ask. “Mother, do you know – well, do you know if it is possible to enter someone else's dream? When you yourself are dreaming?” he asked her and she raised an eyebrow, frowning slightly.
At the time, it had warmed Harry's heart. And by the time Malfoy had been released from house arrest, they had been nearly inseparable.
“All right, leaders up here, and we’ll divide up the troops!” he was saying as McGonagall turned her sharp gaze back to Harry.
"Bring them back," Harry murmured and Draco nodded, leaned forward to kiss him softly one last time, and then turned to the Aurors.
The spell coming from directly behind it seemed to spook the dragon, which roared and unfurled its wings. A second later, it realised that it was now untethered and amidst the shouts from the goblins and wizards below, it stretched its wings out to their full length and gave one, powerful, flap.
“It’s not yours Missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it–” He was cut off from saying anything further by a bang and a flash of red light and he fell, Stunned, to the floor, the sword already in Bellatrix’s hand. There was a cry of outrage from the Snatchers around them and Draco could see Potter’s head swivelling every which way in an attempt to see what was happening. Scabior, stupidly, drew his own wand.
The seventh-year boys dormitory smelt of freshly laundered sheets and peppermint. It was laid out like a hospital ward, two lines of four-poster beds, three on one side and two on the other. Draco’s bed was nearest the door, and his trunk was already laid at the foot of the bed. He rummaged inside it for pyjamas and then went to light the lamp on the bedside table. He noticed a small note propped up against it and blinked when he realised it was Snape’s handwriting spelling out his name on the front.
“How did you know?” he asked, feeling like the memory of Rowle screaming on the floor was so distant here, like it had happened to someone else, and Potter shrugged one shoulder.
Inside, Hermione was laid on a comfortable-looking sofa, her eyelids fluttering every now and then. Ron was kneeling beside her, smoothing her hair over her forehead. He looked up as Draco entered.
If Harry had to cast a Patronus, it would give him away instantly. Everyone knew about the beautiful stag… but no one knew what Draco’s was. No one knew he even had one.
“Is it?” he asked and Draco had to think as well. All this time away from others had made him lose all sense of the day. Granger’s eyes were still on the church and the little churchyard next to it.
“Finally,” he wheezed, and there seemed to be a collective breath as they all realised they were coming to the end of the talk. “Short-listed candidates will be invited back to the college where we will announce who has been granted the fellowship. Thank you all for your attention this evening. I invite you all to mingle at the back of the hall. I believe there is wine available,” he said, glancing over at another examination fellow, who bobbed her head of tightly coiled red hair. There was a scattering of polite applause, and then everyone stood and headed to the back of the hall, where a table with a white cloth over it was laden with wine glasses.
“You set off the Caterwauling charm?” one of the Death Eaters asked and Aberforth argued back as Draco crept further along the side street, his back to the wall. He felt it dip slightly into a doorway and he reached up a hand, trying the handle – thankfully, it was open and he slipped backwards inside, shutting and locking the door behind him.
MY PEOPLE,” he shouted, jabbing a finger at Ron’s chest. Ron gaped at him and Draco tried to calm himself. “
“Severus,” Mother said and her voice, quiet though it was, cut through the noise of their fellow diners. Snape wound his way to her and she offered him a hand, which he lightly took in his own. “Good of you to come. Can I get you a glass of anything?” she offered and Snape demurred.
There was a hand on Harry's shoulder which knocked him out of his daze, and he moved away again, leaving Malfoy's stomach uncovered. Ron was standing next to him, looking concerned.
“If you couldn’t make it out, Harry, how can you be sure?” Hermione shot back, and Potter seemed to wilt a little. As much as Draco wanted to support Potter, he had to agree with Hermione – if there was no proof, that was it.
“I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” Harry said quietly, but his voice carried over the watchers. “It’s got to be like this. It’s got to be me,”
“I don’t think anyone will be wearing it for a while,” Draco said and Potter nodded. He rubbed a hand over his face and then pushed himself up to sit, swinging his legs over the side of the bed so that they were nearly knee-to-knee.
Potter and Weasley were scouring a nearby hedge for blackberries while Draco and Hermione sat at the tent entrance reading. They both looked up when Weasley shouted “NO!”, Hermione jumping with fright. Potter gave them both an apologetic look as Weasley fished him out of the hedge, explaining his reason for shouting. “-that’s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance – it’s how they found us in Tottenham Court Road!”
“That’s good! It’s a strong start. See, you can do it after all,” he said as he took a few steps closer. “You’ll need to find a really happy memory, though. Do you have anything at all? Beating someone at Quidditch, the Yule Ball?” Potter asked and Draco thought hard.
my mother,” Draco snapped and Snape’s frown deepened. “We sit at a dinner table surrounded by bloodthirsty fanatics and the Dark Lord stalks the corridors of my home day and night and all she does is make polite conversation about books and her garden and –”
He would never get to say ‘goodbye’. He would never get to say ‘sorry’. He would never get to say ‘thank you’. All of it, all the possibilities the future had held, were gone.
“I’m not sure about this,” Granger breathed, as Potter went to walk past her. He paused and thought for a second.
His renewed purpose was not dampened by a sudden downpour of rain, though his jumper was. He shivered all the more as he trudged along, following a river’s path. It took him several hours, pulling out his wand every now and then, adjusting his course, until he found what he was looking for.
Remembering he had been writing a reply to Malfoy's latest letter, Harry fished it out of his backpack and set it on the kitchen counter, leaning over it to continue writing.
“I’ll come with you, actually, I haven’t decided,” Malfoy said, standing up himself. Hermione looked a little put-out that her audience was leaving her, but she gave Harry an encouraging smile just before he headed to the bar.
At the end, there was a single door, made of a wood so dark that it seemed to blend into the wall. Draco gripped the large iron handle and turned it, the door creaking open. He went inside, and Harry followed him in.
“He was your mother’s cousin. He defied Voldemort, apparently,” Potter said, drawing his knees up to his chest, his gaze far away. Draco frowned and took a few steps further into the room. He was once again surrounded by the warmth of the dream, and Potter’s eyes seemed to track him from the doorway, though they weren’t suspicious. Curious, more like.
“Maybe?” he suggested and the answer seemed to spur on his father, who looked at Weasley next. His lower face was crusted with dried blood and he stared defiantly into Lucius Malfoy’s face.
!’ He echoed the spell, hearing twin shouts from Weasley and Harry, and the crowd of goblins staggered, some falling over, but they kept advancing. Draco adjusted his balance on the still moving mudslide of hot metal, and sent off another volley of hexes, Weasley and Hermione following suit. Behind the group, the tethered and half-blind dragon, a pitiful thing that they had passed on the way in, roared, and a jet of fire flew over the heads of the goblins.
“Yes, Genealogy and Anthropology,” he said eventually, sitting up straight in his chair and lifting his glass too. Hermione’s eyebrows shot up.
"Dinnae do anything stupid," he told them all, in a thick brogue. "When ye ge' tae th' location, assume formation but bide for my signal. If tha' bastard Malfoy - nae offence, mind," he said, looking at Malfoy who nodded dumbly, "If he is waitin' for us, cast tae stun only," Everyone nodded. Begbie crossed his arms over his massive, barrel-like chest, and called forward the first team members to Apparate. Four Aurors stepped forward, and he counted down for them, all four turning and disappearing with a
“I’m flattered Cameron, but no,” he said quietly, but firmly, and Cameron all but deflated in front of him.
“That’s a legend, isn’t it?” Draco asked, calming himself a little at the looks on their faces. Potter rolled his eyes and Granger shook her head.
Draco, who had been attempting to read an old textbook, watched his mother’s face in the firelight, trying to build the courage to ask the right question.
“This is Dragomir Despard,” Hermione gestured to Weasley, who clicked his heels together and bowed sharply, a rough imitation of the Durmstrang boys that had visited in fourth year. “And this is Pierre Bonfils, a distant cousin of my husband’s. Both speak very little English, but they are in sympathy with the Dark Lord’s aims. Dragomir has travelled from Transylvania and Pierre from France to see our new regime,” Hermione explained smoothly, and Draco gave a flourishing bow that felt a little ridiculous.
“You must not hurt Harry Potter!” he squeaked and Bellatrix screeched in fury, stamping her foot like a child.
“Then what do we do? If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than – wait!” Harry snapped, turning to face the goblin who lingered by the vault door, his arms crossed over his chest, a sour look on his face. Harry blinked and it was like a light had flickered on in his brain. “Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!” Harry said, gesturing to Hermione and opening his hand as though waiting to catch something.
“Start with Rowle, Draco,” the Dark Lord commanded and Draco screwed his eyes shut, holding his wand tightly as if it were a lifeline. “NOW, Draco,” the Dark Lord shrieked and Draco pointed his wand at Rowle.
“It’s very brave of them,” Hermione said, standing and heading for the kitchen. “If they were found…'' she said, trailing off and Weasley shrugged.
“Crabbe and Goyle are here and they’re going to kill me and Harry. We need to find him!” he told her, his breathing catching in his lungs.
A group of people lay in a line in the centre of the room, and Draco blinked at them, confused, before he realised that these were the dead. The Weasleys, mourning, were crowded around the recovered body of Fred. Ron and Hermione slipped over to them, Hermione embracing Ginny as Ron joined his brothers who opened their arms to him. And next to Fred…
Thompson was there, at his desk in amongst the Aurors, when Harry planted his palms on the smooth wooden surface and did his best to loom over the Head of the Aurors. Thompson barely glanced up from his paperwork. He had always been arrogant and dismissive, believing that Harry had gotten into the Auror program on his name alone, and not because Harry had proved his capabilities. He had been bitter about being passed over for the Head of Aurors position when Harry had been promoted six years ago, and was now bitter that Harry had become the Head of the MLE, and Thompson had been selected to take his place leading the Aurors. Meetings between them were forced and barely civil, and Harry wanted to punch him half the time. Now was no exception.
He had been sitting outside for nearly an hour on his own when Potter returned, looking a bit less harassed than he had previously. He glanced over at Draco, who turned to the next page and studiously kept his eyes on the book. Potter surveyed him, and then the hearty fire in front of them, and then settled himself down.
“I’m very certain, Severus,” he replied and Draco, unable to wait any longer, banged on the door. There was a frantic round of rustling, and then Snape called ‘
“He works at the Ministry. Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes,” he lied smoothly and Draco thought for a second that Potter would’ve done very well in Slytherin.
“Maybe you can be the Regulus of our generation. Maybe you can keep secrets,” he said, almost wistfully, and then Draco woke up.
“Look for the door!” he shouted and Draco blinked through the haze of smoke. He coughed and wiped at his eyes, which made them sting.
“They’re going to get us all killed. Harry needs to tell them, we need to go. He’s fighting off another vision, I can tell,” he told her and she shrugged one shoulder.
“You said you were studying Anthropology and Genealogy, Malfoy?” Harry asked, nodding his thanks when he received his own pint glass. Malfoy took his seat and began meticulously pouring out his Dandelion and Burdock like he had yesterday, glancing up to look at Harry.
Draco’s world fell away for the moment. It felt like someone had hit him with the Levicorpus Spell, like the world had been yanked out from underneath him and he was hanging, suspended by a thread, over the horror that loomed below him. The Dark Lord continued to speak, “He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone.”
“I don’t know,” he admitted and they fell silent. “You and Granger have been kind to me. Kinder than I deserve,” he said and Potter ran a hand through his hair.
“Do you think that Peverell bloke had anything to do with this? The one who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow?” Potter asked, swiftling changing the subject, and Hermione sighed.
“And you know what you’re looking for, roughly?” he asked and Granger made a noise of acknowledgement but didn’t say anything, shoving the quill between her teeth as she turned another set of pages furiously. He set the book back down on the table and tried to read what she was writing upside-down – the words were a tangle of scribbles that he had no hope of deciphering at this angle. “Do you know where they are?” he asked and Granger sighed and peered up at him through her mass of hair, plucking the quill from between her teeth to speak to him.
"Right, everybody out!" Harry announced, and Draco pulled open the front door, stepping out into the early Autumn sunlight. They made their way across to the park opposite the house and stood in a well-shaded area. Harry took Scorpius' hand while Draco took Albus' and together, they Disapparated.
"LOVE YOU!" Scorpius shouted, waving frantically, Aloysius wedged under one arm. Draco gave a happy hiccup of a laugh, and waved back, and kept waving until the train turned and, with one last long whistle, disappeared out of sight.
“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad appear…. And Cedric…” and his gaze became unfocused, like he was thinking of that moment. Draco had heard about it in whispers around the Manor, but he saw true pain in Potter’s eyes. He stepped a little closer, and Potter’s vision refocused and snapped back to him, giving him a small smile.
!” He shook Snape’s shoulders more violently and then someone had seized him around the middle and was pulling him away, and he yelled and kicked.
“Why are you talking to me now?” he asked and Snape raised an eyebrow. His dark eyes were endless voids in the noon light of the Orangery, absorbing all warmth around them and reflecting back the coolness of the Black Lake in winter. Draco held his gaze though, rage gnawing at his insides, betrayal as well. “Where have you been all summer? Where have you been since June?” His insides twisted as the hurt tasted acidic in his mouth. “Where were you when I needed you?” he asked and Snape looked pained, his eyebrows drawing together, his lips pursing.
Draco uncorked the vial and allowed some of the dittany to pool onto his fingers. He paused for a second, looking at the angry red mark and then leaned over Potter again, using the pipette of the vial to drop some of the liquid on. It smoked and Potter groaned again but he soon settled and Draco took a second to rub the dittany in, covering the whole mark. It smoked slightly and began to heal, but the skin was still dark and painful looking even after a minute.
"Chaser. He's good - takes after both of us, I think. He was annoyed that he didn't beat me for “Youngest Seeker in a Century', though. He thought that if he was really good, the team would recruit him before he had even stepped on the train," he said with a laugh and Malfoy smiled. He tapped on the frame near Scorpius.
’,” Crabbe said in what Draco was sure was his best threatening tone. Draco stiffened for a second at the edge of his bed but then shrugged it off and clambered back in, pulling the duvet back down over his lap.
The Manor was silent, aside from the breaths of the Aurors, which clouded like mist in front of them. Hermione shivered next to Harry, and he reached for her, gave her shoulder a squeeze - the last time she had been here was when they were caught by the Snatchers all those years ago, and she had declined accompanying him to the Manor when Harry had started to visit Draco there. He wanted to give her some form of comfort, though he was feeling very unnerved himself.
"The hair has been identified. Lucius Malfoy," she had said, looking very shaken. Ron had thanked her very politely while Malfoy's skin had paled by another three shades. Harry dug his hands into his own hair and tried very hard not to scream.
Whether it had been by Potter’s touch or his presence alone, a sign was now rising out of the ground in front of them, through the weeds and snow. It creaked as it raced towards them and then let out of soft groan as it settled, and the gold letters on the wooden placard read;
"Your sons are being particularly difficult this morning," he told the other figure in the room. Draco shrugged and turned around from where he had been buttering toast, raising an eyebrow at Harry.
After an enlightening conversation with the Grey Lady of Ravenclaw tower (which shed light on both her and the Bloody Baron’s former lives), an encounter with Hagrid and his dog (who had whimpered and dived behind Draco’s legs at the first opportunity), meeting a grinning Fred Weasley who smiled harder even as the castle shook around him, and finally all but running into a grim-faced Aberforth Dumbledore, Draco wasn’t sure what else was going to happen when they rounded another corner and nearly ran directly into Ron and Hermione.
Draco hesitated. Only for a split second, but enough. The Dark Lord’s eyes narrowed and he turned his attention to Draco, “Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!”
“We should go,” Weasley cut in and Potter and Hermione looked at him sharply. He was still knelt next to the wireless, and he gave them a timid smile. “We should go. If Hermione’s right, we ought to go see Lovegood,” he added and Potter gave him a dark look. Draco followed suit.
"I'll take him to St. Mungos. You get your boys sorted," she had told Harry, before going to crouch in front of Malfoy, talking to him with a low soothing voice.
“We’re here,” He eventually said simply and Draco sighed and nodded. Every time they had met in this dreamscape, Potter had been verging on incoherent, conversations skipping ahead before Draco could catch up. Potter leaned back and lowered himself so he was sat cross-legged on the floor in front of Draco. “Is Hogwarts very different?” he asked and Draco shrugged one shoulder.
“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow.” Draco’s head whipped up and Potter looked round at him in shock. “The evidence is that she died several months ago,” and Draco remembered the smell of the place, the state it was in, the molding walls and the stench of a body rotting from the inside out. He tried not to gag at the memory. “The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic,” Lee finished grimly and Hermione was shaking her head, while Weasley just stared at the floor, lost in thought. Potter stood and went to join Draco at the dining table, resting a hand on the back of his neck and squeezing lightly, a comforting touch. Draco shuffled up along the bench as Potter sat down. Lee continued to speak.
"That is correct, Lee. We still don't know who could have taken them, or why, but it is of the utmost importance that both boys are found safe and well. I must let the kidnapper know, if he or she is listening to this, that the full force of the Ministry is searching for the boys at this time, and we will find them. This is a promise," she said sternly.
The drawing room door was slightly ajar, and Draco pressed an eye to the crack to see in. Hermione was on the floor, quiet and still, and Bellatrix was looming over the goblin that they had been tied together with, and he had the Sword of Gryffindor balanced in his hands.
The glowing Dark Mark had gone, leaving the night sky studded with stars. Dumbledore waited for him. He looked like his portrait, whole and healthy, his hands folded over his long beard. He did not look like the half-dead man Draco had once confronted in this very place.
It had been Molly Weasley who had come barrelling through the fireplace at 4am, taken in Malfoy trembling in a corner, rocking backwards and forwards, muttering to himself, and Harry, pale and exhausted, in front of her, and she had pulled herself up to her greatest height and nodded, as if steeling herself for the forthcoming events.
“That’s fair. We can just sit here for a while. I think you’re keeping the nightmares at bay,” he replied, looking over Draco’s shoulder at something in the distance. Draco settled back and they sat there in silence for a long time after.
Row upon row of graves were lined up behind the church, the tombstones dusted with snow that covered the dates of most of the deceased. An angel stood watch over one of the graves, her hands raised and pressed together in prayer, and the marble caught the flecks of light coming from the stained glass windows, staining her tears a vibrant red in the light. Potter moved off the trenches they were carving to look at one of the graves and his voice was piercingly loud in the otherwise silent church yard.
, but that’s what he was now. He smiled to himself, and then pulled his hand away from Cameron before he could touch it.
“Plan?” he repeated. He swayed a little where he stood but Ron left him standing, did not prop him up. “Well, there’s something – Ron, Hermione, Draco and I – need to do and then we’ll get out of here.”
“Damn!” she hissed and then she shook her head. “Right. We’ll just have to–” She was cut off by a cry coming from a thicket of trees nearby. She and Draco whirled around to where the noise had come from. “Was that–?” she asked and Draco felt all the panic drain out of him.
“So – where do we go from here?” Draco asked after a minute of silence. Granger looked up at him and sighed.
Snape held his hands up for quiet and the Slytherins fell silent. Draco looked over at the other tables and the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were still and silent – a few Hufflepuff students looked to be hastily wiping away tears. The Gryffindors were barely holding themselves in check. He could see tightened fists and murderous glances from the other side of the Great Hall – a few looked over at him in disgust. Overhead, the cloud covered sky tumbled and swirled, the moon hidden from their view.
. Potter had a habit of slipping past the Dark Lord, of surviving. In the endless weeks of summer that had passed since his return from Hogwarts, Draco often thought of Potter. He had been rushed away before the end of year feast, ushered home where he had been barred from contacting his friends or the outside world and in that space, Potter had taken root.
“Yeah, Xenophilius Lovegood was wearing it around his neck at Bill and Fleur’s wedding,” Potter acknowledged. “Hermione, why–?” but she had turned on her heel and gone marching back to her bedroom, returning a few seconds later with a book in her hands. It was ‘
“Alas, I also! Gold, filthy gold,” he said with a conspiratorial laugh. “We cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.” He offered his arm to Hermione and the rustle of her cloak drowned out the noise of Harry gasping behind them. Draco forced himself not to look.
“Just look around! Remember, the cup’s small and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles – otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle–” Potter instructed, holding his arms out high at his sides like he was wading into particularly cold water. They remained rooted to their spots, and Draco pointed his wand light, scanning from the top of the vault downwards.
“Would I like the wife and children and Lord Malfoy nonsense? No, thank you,” he replied shortly and he took another bite of his sandwich. Potter studied him for a moment longer and then turned back to the book in front of him. They ate in silence that was only interrupted by the scrape of a spoon or the occasional grunt off Weasley from where he still slept in the armchair. After a few minutes Potter straightened again, frowning.
A flash of white blond hair. Pale, pointed features. Grey eyes. Draco Malfoy was stood with some other Fellowship candidates, politely listening but not engaging in their conversation. Harry felt like someone had just whacked him over the head with a broom handle.
“I’m okay for the moment, thanks,” he said with a smile, and Potter nodded, picking up his mug of tea and going to join Hermione by the tent entrance. Draco went over to the dining table, picked up ‘
With a growl of frustration, Draco dropped into a crouch and began pulling out his supplies for the night from his backpack. “Fine!” he shouted to no one. “If I get hypothermia and die, I’m haunting you!” The tent poles caught on the lip of the bag and it took a few furious tugs to get them loose, sending Draco back onto his bum on the cold ground. He swore loudly and behind him he heard a ‘
Hermione reappeared a few minutes later, looking a little pale but relieved. She collapsed into the seat next to Harry, who gave her an enquiring look. She held up a hand and turned it from side to side, and Harry understood that she wasn’t sure if her Viva was enough… They didn’t speak until the doorway to the room Hermione had exited opened again, and another Fellow stepped through.
He had signed up along with Hermione to take his Seventh Year, much to the surprise of Ron and his other friends, and he hadn’t looked back. Academia, though fraught with its own politics, soothed Harry’s mind in a way little had before.
“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” Harry said, tucking the Elder wand into the pouch around his neck, his true wand held lovingly in his hand. “And quite honestly,” and he turned his back to the portraits, to Dumbledore’s sparkling gaze, and reached for Draco, pulling him close. “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime,” he said quietly against Draco’s lips and Draco smiled and in front of all the Headmasters and Headmistresses that Hogwarts had ever known, he kissed The Boy Who Won.
“Granger, Potter,” he replied in greeting, his hands remaining firmly at his sides. “A pleasure to see you both,” he said and Harry resisted the urge to scoff. It certainly wasn’t, at least not from his point of view. He had last seen Draco Malfoy and his mother in the courtroom of the Wizengamot, just after giving evidence that Narcissa Malfoy had saved his life by lying to Voldemort. Malfoy had been pale, his skin nearly translucent in the candlelight of the courtroom, and Harry had found himself studying the way that his schoolyard rival had looked older than his years, and exhausted down to his very soul. Harry had a fair amount of pity for him, truth be told, but very little sympathy.
"Because we're us," he had said simply, because it was true. They seemed to be the cursed ones, two doomed boys from either side of a War that was far greater than either of them. Doomed to wander, doomed never to find happiness or be at peace. Doomed to never be allowed to love.
“Thank you Mr Potter. Please return to this college next Saturday at five in the afternoon for the announcement of our successful candidates,” Williams said, and Harry stood, thanked the assembled Fellows, and left.
"Slytherin. Both of them. Everyone - the Ministry, the press, my friends - all thought I'd be horrified. But I wasn't. I was supposed to be in Slytherin, but I made my choice. The boys made theirs," he explained. Malfoy nodded.
“Stay under the cloak,” and Draco nodded. The woman finally opened the door and stepped back to let them in.
A hand reached through first, young and slim, with calluses on the palm from gripping a broom. A curled lock of white-blond hair and then his own green eyes, a slim nose. Albus was emerging from the mirror.
“You will need to be braver still, Draco. Find courage in your heart, dear boy – and in your dreams,” and then that hand was gently pushing him, sending him backwards over the ramparts and then he was –
"We managed to floo her late last night, McGonagall let us use her floo. She's devastated, obviously, but she said… she said she didn't see them at all on the train," she explained and Harry's heart dropped. Hermione met his gaze again. "I've told the Aurors. They don't think the boys ever made it to the train, Harry," she said, reaching for his hand where it was clenched around the files he held, his knuckles blanching white. "I'm so sorry," she murmured and Harry felt himself nod automatically. Of course she was sorry - for the last 21 hours, everyone had been “sorry'.
Outside, Potter was sitting on one of the logs, catching and releasing a Snitch with one hand, the other holding a large piece of parchment open on his lap. Draco stared at the Snitch, feeling a small tightening in his chest. He missed Quidditch. He missed playing the game with his teammates, and he even missed matches against Potter. He was an excellent Seeker, better than Draco, even if it pained Draco to admit it to himself.
“Fred,” she told him with a trembling bottom lip, the word wrenched from her, and he looked over her shoulder to see the Weasley twin, who had been so very alive only a moment before, staring sightlessly up at the ceiling, his mouth curved in one final smile.
“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” Greyback asked and Potter jerked, knocking Draco’s head with his own.
“What about Weasley? The – Ginny, I mean. Weren’t you two dating for a while?” he asked and the tip of Potter’s ears went slightly pink. He nodded and let the Snitch go – it shot up in the air and then flitted around their heads as he spoke. He looked down at the parchment again and Draco could see, from this angle, that it was a map.
They had evicted the final inhabitants of the Room of Requirement. Granny Longbottom was every bit as formidable as her grandson wasn’t, and though Draco would have liked to have spent more time getting to know his cousin (who hugged him and told him he should come and meet the baby sometime), they had to get moving. Ginny Weasley, lingering in the hallway now, gave him a curious look as she edged closer to the stairwell that Nymphadora had just run up.
“What is it?” he asked. Draco squinted into the darkness. All around them the edges of the graveyard were dense black, and Draco couldn’t see anything.
“I love them. I love them so much. But their cause is getting people killed. And I can’t love who they’ve become. What kind of parent does this to their child?” he asked Potter, who was an indistinct shape through the tears. Potter straightened, still half-crouched, and wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling him close so that Draco could cry on his shoulder.
“You still don’t get it Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough. Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard… the Elder Wand recognised a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realising exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance,”
He would run forward and take that curse and pour all of his dying love onto Harry if it would keep him safe for one more day. But he couldn’t. Harry’s gaze flicked to his for one second and Draco understood – it had to be this way.
He awoke the following afternoon to a heated, albeit whispered, conversation between Potter and Granger. Granger was reclining into one of the squashy, if drooping, armchairs, and Potter was sitting on one of the dining table benches. Draco, who had been on the night watch the previous night and was still a little bit fuzzy from sleep, pushed himself out of bed and ambled over to them, wrapping his arms around himself to ward off the cold that seeped in through the tent entrance.
in woodland, sending them sprawling onto the icy ground. Granger sobbed and Draco groaned and Potter let out a strange strangled cry. Draco looked up to find Potter convulsing on the ground next to him, his eyes white as they had rolled back, his limbs jerking erratically. Granger moaned to herself and scrambled over to him, wrapping an arm around his waist.
“Your authority!” Bellatrix sneered, twisting her arm in an attempt to free it from Father’s grip. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!” she shrieked, twisting harder and Draco would have laughed if he hadn’t been so terrified, to watch his father and Aunt wrestle in the drawing room, Bellatrix trying to shake Father off.
. It was the light they shone on those about to go in front of the Wizengamot, to ensure they were truthful.
“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” Hermione said, snatching the book off Weasley, closing it and hugging it to her chest. “I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was on that grave and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, if anyone knows something, we have to assume it’s Xenophilius Lovegood. I’m sure this is important,” she said with conviction and Draco nodded. Potter looked over at him from the tent entrance.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked, gesturing to the Manor which rose like a nightmare in front of them, set a top a hill which was covered in a fine mist this morning. Begbie gestured them closer, and Harry led the way.
“Darling,” his mother sobbed, reaching from him and he allowed himself to be hugged. His father gripped his shoulder tightly as his mother smoothed back his hair. “Are you uninjured?” she asked, and Draco nodded. “What Potter said–” she started and he nodded.
Accompanied by the sound of metal clanging as he bounced between suits of armour. For Peeves, it was rather tuneful.
“The Ministry falls tonight then, Bella?” Mother asked delicately, as Bellatrix took a gulp of wine from the crystal goblet. It stained the corners of her mouth.
“Did you see what happened to her?” he asked, smoothing back his cousin’s hair. Her chest was so still, her eyelids did not flicker. He could see that they shared the same nose, the same chin.
“If it is not love that will save you this time, you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?”
“It’s too late for that,” he said with finality. He lifted one shaking hand and pressed it to his head, closing his eyes again. “He knows where it is. He’s there now.”
“I agree,” Hermione said, bending back over her book. She read in silence for a bit and then looked up again at him. “Harry had a complicated relationship with Dumbledore,” she said, the change in subject like a punch to the gut, and Draco gave her a baleful look. She raised a hand to keep him at bay. “No, listen. Harry grew up in a home where he was very much unwanted. He spent 10 years sleeping in a cupboard under the stairs,” she said and Draco’s jaw dropped. Hermione nodded. “Hogwarts is Harry’s first real home, and Dumbledore gave him that. To Harry, in a way, Dumbledore saved him. But he also left Harry with a lot of scars. He only ever gave Harry the barest amount of information, and whether that was to protect Harry or for another reason, I can’t say. But Harry trusted Dumbledore and he feels like–” and she blinked and tilted her head, thinking. He waited for her to speak. “He feels like with Dumbledore now gone, he has to take over. He has to save everyone. But he feels guilty about it. Does that make sense?” she said and Draco nodded.
While Hagrid looked determined, confident, Potter was clearly unsure. He looked around the dark sky, as if searching for some hint of what was to come. Draco hovered close enough that if he was corporeal, Potter should have seen him, but Potter looked right through him. He was close enough now to hear Hagrid shout over the engine “We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” The motorbike began to descend, even as a strange expression crept over Potter’s face, like fear and realisation all in one.
“Are you warm enough?” she asked and they all nodded. She nodded once in reply and then disappeared upstairs.
“I think we should move too, but let’s go when it’s dark. We can Disapparate under the cloak as well,” she said, and he and Potter nodded. Hermione gave them a reassuring smile.
Belinda came back with the tea, and pushed the mug into one of his hands. Harry reached for her with the other.
And so it went, Harry answering questions regarding the answers he had written in the examination papers. One Fellow wanted to know his justification in saying the Tudor period was the start of the decline of magic, another wanted to discuss his answer regarding the basis of late-modern fairytales. Harry found the more he spoke, the more confident he felt. He knew this subject like he knew his bones - all the knowledge he had accumulated over the years was there around him, like a warm blanket, and he leaned into it every time he talked. Time was ticking on, and Fellow Williams, who had originally spoken to Harry, spoke again.
Draco stood in the silence of the sitting room and went to the kitchen, where Luna Lovegood was sitting on one of the rough hewn chairs at the small kitchen table, sipping a mug of steaming tea. She looked up at Draco with her large pale eyes and gave him a weak smile.
“Oh Ron – the Deathly Hallows can’t exist!” Hermione snapped, shucking her jacket. She took half a step out of the tent to shake it roughly, though it didn’t seem to do much good. Weasley huffed at her from the armchair.
“Oo does ‘e look like?” Fleur asked, leaning against her husband. Draco tuned the conversation around him out, staring down at the goblet of wine in his hand. Much like he had felt in the forest at the news of the death of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell, he again felt like the world had been crystallised around Shell Cottage, unchanged. But with death came birth and the cycle began anew. He looked over at Potter, who was still smiling.
When he was done, Draco turned back around to find Potter and Granger’s tent gone and only Granger carrying a small bag looped around her wrist. Draco shrugged on his backpack and joined them in the centre of the clearing. Potter had stamped out the remains of the fire and kicked the ash into the surrounding dirt to disguise that there had ever been a campsite there to begin with.
“What’d you think you’re playing at, woman?” he asked and Bellatrix didn’t even respond, she just hit him and his cohorts with Stunning Spells until they were all crumpled to the ground, except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneel under Bellatrix’s wrathful gaze.
"You sent your fucking Patronus after me, Potter!" came a shout and Harry recognised that voice, had ached for that voice for years, and then he was on his feet and wrenching open the door, causing Belinda to topple into the room with a yelp.
“What’s going on?” he asked, looking over Potter with concern but not panic. Draco felt instantly better for having him here.
“I saw it. I have this… link with Voldemort. I can see what he sees sometimes,” he explained and he stretched and smiled. “I can tell you this only because this is a dream. Dreams can’t talk,” he said firmly and Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Malfoy's here,” he said, surprised by the breathlessness in his own voice, and Hermione frowned at him
Without thinking, he pulled his wand out from his jumper and pointed it at Potter, who was knelt near the tent entrance, frozen. There was the bang from his wand and an echoing one from across the tent, and then Potter buckled over, clutching his face, groaning in pain. From the other side of Potter, Draco could see Hermione with her wand out too. They had both hit him with a jinx at the same time.
“Dumbledore bequeathed it to me. This symbol – it’s been drawn in, it’s not part of the print. And Harry here says that Viktor Krum told him it was a symbol of Grindelwald, but there’s no mention of it in anything I’ve read about him,” she said, flinging a hand out at Potter who was watching them with one eyebrow raised, as if in disbelief.
The Manor was still silent around him but his heart raced in his chest. Another dream. Another strange, all too real, dream. He strained his ears to hear movement around the Manor but aside from the distant calls of the peacocks on the grounds, there was silence. He turned over and fell asleep once more, dreaming of nothing.
“Hey,” there was a murmur next to Draco and he jumped. Dean was next to him, holding the goblin, and he jerked his head towards the cottage in the distance. “Let’s go inside, okay?” he suggested and Draco nodded, pushing himself up to standing. He kept his eyes averted as he followed Dean inside, staggering on numb legs into the warm building.
“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!” Aberforth was shouting at the Death Eaters.
He took a deep breath and stepped inside, the surface warping and rippling around him, accepting him in until it settled into a single sheet and went still once again.
“No, sir. Just getting used to being back at school after the holidays,” Draco threw out the excuse and hoped that Slughorn would buy it. The Potions teacher gave him a once-over look and then nodded.
“I didn’t say I liked it, but it’s the truth!” Aberforth said defensively, leaning back in his chair by the fire. His arms were crossed over his chest, and the lenses of his glasses caught the firelight, turning his eyes a blazing orange for a second.
“Amortentia?” He tried but the gargoyle didn’t move. Draco tried again. “Veritaserum? Uh, Wormwood? Wolfsbane?” He scrambled to find more Potions ingredients. “Asphodel?” he suggested and the gargoyle groaned and moved out of the way. He blinked at it. “Really?” he asked.
“It was my dad’s,” he told Draco quietly. He then stood and hovered awkwardly before heading to the wireless that was in the corner of the room. It had been silent as long as Draco had been in the tent, but Potter went and fiddled with it now. Granger looked up with interest as he did so.
“Are you alright, Harry?” Longbottom was saying, hovering nearby. Harry’s eyes took a second to focus on Draco and then he turned as Longbottom continued to speak. “Want to sit down? I expect you’re tired, aren’t–?”
“To Godric’s Hollow? Isn’t it a wizarding village?” he asked and they both turned to look at him. “What’s in Godric’s Hollow?” he asked and Granger chewed on her lip for a second before closing her book, marking her place with a finger.
“They’re safe,” he told Ron, who had looked around in alarm. Bill shucked his travelling cloak, draping it over one arm. “It’s lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts, they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she’s safe too.” He surveyed the group and then looked somewhere behind Draco’s left shoulder. Draco looked up and over, and noticed Potter standing there, leaning against the door frame.
“Well, we should go say hello,” Hermione said and walked off, Harry left gaping behind her for a second before following her through the crowd. Malfoy was exactly where he had seen him earlier, though a bit further away from the candidates than he had been before. Hermione didn’t slow her pace and continued to walk right up to him, Harry trailing behind her, his full wine glass sloshing in his hand.
"… I'm sorry, Minister - Harry Potter's sons have been kidnapped?" he sounded shocked, horrified, and Harry buried his face in his hands.
“What do you mean?” she asked and Weasley gave her a lopsided grin. Next to him, Harry took Draco’s hand in his own and squeezed it.
He looked around, and spotted Viktor Krum talking harshly to a man with pale blond hair dressed in bright yellow robes. On the dancefloor next to him, Fleur Delacour, the Triwizard Champion from Beauxbatons (who Draco had thought to be so beautiful the first time he saw her, but now on seeing her twirling across the dancefloor, he realised he had been mistaken – she
“These Wandless haven’t disturbed you, have they?” he asked with a sneer, and Hermione waved a hand.
He emerged later, and the sun was high overhead. Hermione was kneeling on one of the dining table benches and she looked up as he came out. She gave him a weak smile and gestured him over. He approached and she turned a book back to face him.
“Dobby’s dead,” he managed to say before he sank down into an armchair, feeling hollowed out and broken. Ron clenched his jaw and nodded. Draco cleared his throat and wiped a hand angrily across his face, smudging the tears there. “Has she woken up?” he asked and Ron shook his head.
"We should probably head off as well. Good night Malfoy, and best of luck tomorrow,” she said, reaching out to shake his hand. Malfoy looked at her and hesitated, but then took her hand and shook it. Harry didn’t offer his hand next and Hermione gave him a cross look.
“This is where Dobby leaves you, Master Draco. Outside this door, you are outside the Hogwarts Apparition zone,” Dobby explained, pointing one long finger at the door.
“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” Father said, straightening and pointing at Weasley. “It’s them, Potter’s friends – Draco, look at him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his name–?”
,” he said quietly, his voice a little strained. He had tried to not think about his parents since arriving here, but occasionally their betrayed expressions as he had Disapparated from the Manor came swimming into his mind.
"My father," he said quietly, as though all the air had been knocked out of him. He locked eyes with Harry, who suddenly understood. "Harry, it's my father. He has them,"
“No, Draco,” Dumbledore said, his voice soft and sad and kind. “It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now,”
“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” he cried and noises of delight rose up around Draco, who smiled politely and clapped. Lupin hadn’t seemed to have noticed him, having strode around the table to pull Potter into a hug, catching him off guard. “You’ll be Godfather?” he asked Potter, who drew back, his eyes wide.
They used to sit like this when Malfoy had been pregnant. Harry would press his hand to Malfoy's middle and feel their twins kicking and moving, while Malfoy hummed songs to himself, or read out a newspaper article he found interesting, or a passage from a favourite book.
“I saw something move, I could have sworn I did…” she murmured back and she stepped away from Potter, breaking her hold on him to withdraw her wand from her jacket. Potter gave her an incredulous look.
"Sorry Harry, but you know the rules. No immediate family are allowed to be involved in any cases. It can cause a conflict of interest," she said and Harry raised an eyebrow at her.
“What happened to Ugly?” Greyback asked, pointing one clawed finger at Harry, who lay face down on the ground. From inside the tent, there was the sound of things being overturned, of Hermione’s books being thrown to the ground and Draco tried not to flinch.
It had begun to show in his lessons. In Defence Against the Dark Arts the day before, he could barely keep his eyes open, even though Michael Corner yelped loudly when Amycus Carrow shot a Stinging Jinx at him for talking in class. The class had been shocked – the professors had never used magic on any of them before (except for the ferret incident in fourth year, though it had been established after that it had not been the actual Professor Moody who had jinxed Draco). Draco, scared into wakefulness, had kept his eyes trained on the desk in front of him and tried to avoid Amycus’ wrath.
"You'd better come with me. I don't imagine you have anywhere to stay tonight," he heard himself say, and Malfoy nodded once, standing up straight, and following Harry from the door. Belinda was sat at her desk, a quick-notes quill writing up the minutes from this morning's meeting as she dictated them. She glanced up as Harry walked past, going for his outer robes that hung on a peg on the nearby wall.
“I just wanted somewhere quiet to sit, really. Things are… Well, a lot of stuff is happening right now, Dobby. I needed some peace,” he said, ladling a dollop of honey into the teacup Mibby had provided. He poured the tea and added a splash of milk, before turning back to Dobby and cradling the mug of tea in his hands. Dobby was looking at him, obviously concerned. The elf began to gather up the firewood he had dropped as he spoke.
“Meanwhile,” Lee continued as Hermione let out a long hiss of air, “in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing the deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was indeed the Killing Curse – more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime.”
“I’m sure it is. They’ll–” She swallowed a little and Draco followed her gaze to the churchyard. He could see the dark line of gravestones peeking out from behind it. “They’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it,” she said. Potter hesitated, his arm convulsing a little and Draco tightened his grip on his shoulder, enough to depress the fabric of Potter’s coat a little. Potter was staring at the graveyard like it held everything he had ever wanted and everything he had ever feared. He looked frozen to the spot and Draco had to dodge out of the way slightly as a villager came slipping past, apologising for nearly colliding with Potter and Granger.
“You – will – never – touch – our – children – again!” screamed Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix didn’t even have time to laugh when Mrs Weasley’s curse soared through the air and hit her square in the chest. She froze in place as Draco ran forward to stand next to Mrs Weasley, who panted.
“Do you ever think it’ll leave us?” she asked, and Harry didn't need to ask what she was asking about. She was asking about the trauma of the War, the fear that came with someone standing too close, of not having your wand in reach, of watching boggarts turn into the dead bodies of friends and family alike.
“Where did you find this sword?” she repeated. The sword rocked to and fro in her grip. “Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!” she shrieked and Draco winced.
“Ok, ok!” she said, waving a hand to send him back into place. She withdrew Bellatrix’s wand as they came to the wall at the back of the small courtyard, tapping it in sequence until the wall unfurled in front of them. They stepped through into a much changed Diagon Alley.
“We thought you might ‘ave broken in,” Crabbe said in a quiet, mean voice. He and Goyle stood in the middle of the common room, dressed in black. Crabbe’s fists were clenched and Draco tried to swallow around the knot that had formed in his throat.
“We need to find Bathilda’s house,” Granger muttered from underneath the cloak, and she shivered a little but kept glancing over her shoulder. “Harry? What do you think? Harry?” she reached over Draco and tugged on Potter’s arm, but he wasn’t paying attention. His gaze was focused ahead of them, at the very end of the row of cottages they were walking past and then suddenly he was speeding ahead, causing Draco and Granger to half jog to keep the cloak covering them all. Granger slipped a little on the ice and Draco took her arm to stop her sliding out from under the cloak.
“Harry!” Draco screamed and Neville turned in surprise at his voice as Voldemort raised his wand to retaliate – a shielding charm appeared out of nowhere in between the Dark Lord and Neville. Neville, seizing the opportunity, ran back, sword in hand, dragging Draco with him.
“Draco,” Amycus said in his gravelly voice, leering at him in that odd, lop-sided way of his. “Please demonstrate the Cruciatus Curse,” he instructed and Draco felt like someone had dumped a bucket of ice water on him. Next to him, Finnigan had gone even paler. One of the Gryffindors (Longbottom, Draco realised with a glance) had tried to jump up and was being wrestled back into his seat by two of the Gryffindor girls.
Draco, feeling sick to his stomach, put roast potatoes and roast chicken on his plate but barely ate it, the food turning tasteless and mealy in his mouth. He ate a little but pushed his plate away and then half-listened to the conversations around him as the other students had their fill.
“Potter – he helps. I don’t – I don’t know. It doesn’t hurt as much when he’s touching me,” he said in a quiet voice and there was a stunned sort of silence before Granger sighed.
“I was about to call him!” he said, sounding almost petulant. Draco dared a glance back to see he was holding onto Bellatrix’s arm tightly, preventing her from touching her Mark which stood out starkly on the pale skin of her forearm. “I shall summon him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house and it is therefore upon my authority–”
’ and a flash of light, and then they all fell silent, stunned and scared. “It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!” the Dark Lord crowed and gently, like he was cradling a baby, Hagrid lowered Harry to the grass, his body shaking with sobs. The Dark Lord sneered and paced the ruined cobblestones of the courtyard along the length of Harry’s body.
“No,” he whispered, his voice soft and tremulous. “Severus… Severus, get up,” he said, reaching his shaking hands for the man’s shoulders. He shook them once and his head lolled, his dark, lank hair falling in front of his face. “You have to get up! Severus, get
“It is I,” a familiar voice shouted about the storm and Draco saw Potter’s expression tighten in surprise. “Remus John Lupin! I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!”
"While you're all playing Sherlock Holmes, our sons are out there, being held hostage by a madman," he exclaimed, outraged, while rising to his feet. Hermione gave Harry a glance, waiting for him to protest, but Harry held his tongue. Malfoy turned on his heel and stormed out of the room, slamming the door shut behind him, causing Harry to flinch slightly. Hermione raised an eyebrow at him.
“He’s with us, Nev,” Ron said, stepping forward and laying a hand on Neville’s shoulder. “He’s on our side,”
!” he said, pointing his wand. The silver mist bloomed out of the end but again, no shape formed and Draco slumped, disappointed. Potter came up behind him and patted him on the shoulder, sending a spark down Draco’s spine.
Harry dropped the two parts of his wand on the Headmaster’s desk and then stepped closer – Draco, Ron and Hermione shuffled forward to watch.
“He changed, Harry, he changed. It’s as simple as that!” she cried, opening her hands wide as if motioning to the obvious. “Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen” – and there was that spike again – “but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who voted for Muggle protection and Muggle-born rights, who fought You-Kn0w-Who from the start and who died trying to bring him down!” She stepped closer with every point, gesturing sharply and Draco had to look away, feeling like someone had punched him in the gut. As he turned, he noticed a book lying on the floor between Potter and Hermione, and from the cover Albus Dumbldore smiled at him. Draco’s breath caught – it was the book from Bathilda Bagshot’s house.
“I couldn’t settle. Ron threatened to make me sleep on the sofa if I didn’t stop fidgeting,” Hermione said with a smile and Harry laughed. She twirled her fork in her left hand for a second, one of the tells Harry had noticed throughout their years at Hogwarts - Hermione was nervous.
where he had met her yesterday and they deposited themselves onto a free table, taking a moment to just breathe and gather themselves.
“What do you think?” she asked, tapping a picture. It was an illustration of a rubbing taken from a tombstone, and underneath, neatly printed were the words. ‘
He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, just watching his father. Lucius had not been involved in the plans for tonight, but Draco had heard whispers about what was going to happen, excitement a low hum in the halls of the Manor. Tonight, at dinner, the Dark Lord would send them to kill Harry Potter.
history, I can see the future far more clearly than I ever could before,” he finished and he looked at Fellow Williams, who nodded once.
He hurriedly pulled more socks on and jammed his feet into boots while trying to pull three jumpers on over his head. He was just standing up as she came barrelling out of her room, dressed and tying her hair up, her beaded bag swinging violently from one wrist. She paused and cursed. “Oh, he’s got your wand,” she said and Draco, who had forgotten all about that, nodded. “We’ll have to go together. Come on, be quiet,” she hissed at him, and he joined her at the door to the tent, stepping out into the freezing night.
Harry pressed a kiss on Draco's cheek, ignoring the murmur "Stop that you whore, I will bite you!", and slapped Draco on the butt, "Come on, let's go inside. I want my lovely lover on the lovely sheet, making lovely love."
He drank it while he wandered back to the boutique. Diagon Alley was not really bustling with people, but there were a few mingling. It was nice and calm, just like Harry wanted it. A nice young lady was holding up a basket filled with roses. Maybe he should...?
Well, that made sense. So Draco thought of his friends and family, wishing them to be saved even though they abandoned him here. The god chuckled and removed the gag from the lips of the human. He was indeed exceptionally beautiful. Alabaster skin, fair hair, slim build. He liked his play toys like that. Sadly he didn't see the eyes but he most certainly would. The boy was full of anger and resentment with a pretty heavy dose of fear. But that was not all. He really wished for the village to be saved, the people to be spared and that the enemies wouldn't hurt his family or friends. Hm, interesting.
"You are a horrible gremlin," Harry laughed and slapped Draco's butt which caused the man to laugh, "Maybe, but I am your gremlin."
Well that sounded promising and that was why he bought it. The tiny little text underneath was almost not visible. It was the manual for it.
Malfoy's face smoothed out and he shook his head, "Anyway, how could you not know that? I am your neighbor." Malfoy pointed at the mansion right next to their significantly smaller house.
His dearest husband scoffed, "That is not even worth opening a vault for. I don't care what you do with the money. Donate it for all I care. We don't need it."
Like his boyfriend, who was wandering right next to him. If someone told him ten years ago that he would willingly hold hands with a former Death Eater and even do more than that... Harry wouldn't have believed him. If someone told it was
Well, that was not really a thing to look forward to, right? He just hoped it would be quick and painless.
They had a relaxed breakfast and then went to the living room to talk about the list and then hopefully reach an agreement on what they wanted to do first.
Around noon a knock was on his door. Ginny was still not home and he doubted she would come before it was dark. She loved to drag him to go shopping after breakfast, have lunch in an expensive restaurant and then shop some more before going to dinner in a very high class restaurant again. Now he was all by himself and Harry noticed he didn't even mind one bit. He was getting up from the couch he was lazing on and opened the door. To his surprise it was Draco. What did the omega want?
He eyed the basket; it was still full to the brim. There were at least fifty or maybe more. He grinned. That would be a very nice surprise.
Harry sat on the recliner as Draco stood in front of the big whiteboard. That way they could make the list and erase it easily. Draco had a nicely leather bound book in his hand and stared at his list. Thankfully he was not as expressionless as in the beginning. Still, he was far away from wearing his emotions on his face. But Draco tried and Harry appreciated it.
Draco was going to die on that marble table and nothing would happen. The god was thirsty for blood and one sacrifice would not be enough.
Draco shook his head. He told a lot of stupid things but that was really the worst. If the demon left him, his magical abilities would return to their original state – not the tenfold it was now. Before he could worry too much, a cold shiver ran down his back and Draco knew this instant that his lover was with him. Hastily he draped himself on the bed. The thought about him begging for sex like a common whore was instantly crushed. He did that for power!
So... what should they do with the money? They didn't need it! Harry sighed and looked at his husband. They had everything they wanted. An just putting it in their vaults was stupid, right?
Harry sighed. He had a lot of trouble coming his way. Couldn't his life be quiet for like a decade or so?
To his utter surprise the couple turned around and walked the few steps and was out of his sight. And how - fucking - dare was Harry?! To have a mistress just because he was occupied with some really life-changing decisions if Lily was better dressed in purple or dark pink? How dare Harry! The fair haired man huffed again, this time he even stepped back so the clerk also noticed something was wrong. Before he could make his way angrily out of the store, his
It took them roughly three days to finish it. They worked on it on-and-off, between work and relaxing.
They bought the ticket on Friday when they were drunk from too much butterbeer and firewhiskey in the leaky cauldron. They were on their way home to celebrate Draco's promotion privately (meaning: lots of fucking like rabbits) and they thought it was funny if they tried out that lotto thing. Not that either of them needed to money. Harry got his parents funds which were immense, and Draco got his own fortune to live off. Also they made a pretty penny with Harry being a teacher at Hogwarts and Draco was now the head of the Slytherin house.
Harry quickly converted the pounds and sighed, "4 million 16 thousand and 64 galleons, 5 sickels and 10 knuts."
He felt his body hovering and being moved gently until two golden-green eyes opened in front of him. They were big and terrible and Draco shivered. If he survived that, he would never do an ancient ritual again! Never ever!
When Harry asked Saturday morning if Draco was finished, his boyfriend thought about it and then nodded. They agreed on adding things down the line anyway so it was just a rough draft anyway.
Even though they were basically royals, they were only a small village and the war reached them as well. Being the village around the temple of the god of war had its perks since the war bringing forces respected the god too much to actually do damage to the village, but it was different now. The barbarians were heathens, they didn't believe in their gods and that gods even existed in the first place so they didn't fear the consequences. Funnily enough the village was mostly trading corn, rice and very rarely linen, not gold and diamonds and all that luxury stuff. Draco's family was one of the wealthiest thanks to old trade routes and having the monopole on corn and grain harvests.
A soft light brightened the cave as Draco looked at the walls, roof and ground for the mushroom. A happy giggle came over his lips as he darted to a mushroom and carefully extracted it with the soil. Harry let his husband be, just drawing his own wand to look at the walls. It was a pretty boring cave so far. Although a mysterious hue was around it at the first glance.
But now Draco licked over his bottom lip, biting into it. Suddenly Harry wanted to do other things than speaking about the list. More fun stuff actually. Something where Draco was on his knees in front of him, not being able to speak much.
Both grimaced at the mention of the slander 'newspaper'. It did not deserve the name newspaper anymore. So many fake 'news' and horrible fantasy novels were written there, it was not even funny anymore. Someone had a field day publishing lie after lie after lie.
Draco was instantly bored. He tried the potion a week before when his beloved was not in his house, so he knew it didn't hurt him nor had any side effects shown up. So he was safe. Now was the time to use it!
Harry scoffed, "I'm not stalking you, Malfoy, and I didn't keep tabs on you. I still skim the Daily Prophet, you know?"
The sun rose even higher and Harry could forget his nagging and screaming wife for a bit. Not for too long though, but long enough.
Draco was writing one as well and every point that was on both of theirs, they would do first. The order didn't matter. They could sort that out later. But now it was brainstorming time.
Another chuckle followed and the hands gently massaged the calf, wandering higher and higher over the thigh,
Draco gulped. That was not going according to plan. Well, nothing really went ever according to plan. But the sad truth was that he needed the demon to accomplish everything he was sent out to do. He couldn't say no; he didn't have the luxury. And so he nodded and hoped it wouldn't hurt so much.
Harry smiled and knocked against the stone. It easily gave way. He turned his head to Draco and smirked, "Are you ready for an adventure?"
The blond man rolled his eyes and brushed the grabby hands off of him; he was annoyed and did not want anything from that heathen now! Harry and his lovely, but whorish, butt should simmer in hell!
The boyfriend (could someone call him that?) in question was out and about, doing god-knows-what, and living pretty abstinent the last few weeks. Which irritated Draco to the max. He wanted to have his night filled with moaning and groaning, blinding light exploding behind his eyelids, filled with passion and the lewd sound of skin slapping against skin and not a chaste kiss on the forehead and an empty bed when he woke up. But this would change tonight!
!, Draco thought lovingly. It seemed that Harry did not have an affair with the florist lady but rather bought her entire stock of red roses. And those were the big, expensive ones. He sniffed one of them while he smiled at his boyfriend. Oh well, Harry escaped his wrath once more.
How stupid can one be?! Demons couldn't and wouldn't love a human of course. But Draco hoped his body was enough to bind Harry to him. At least until Draco could slowly untangle the mess that was his heart and mind and distance himself from the love he felt.
They continued the narrow path, just enjoying the nature. They would stop occasionally since Draco wanted to pick some of the herbs and plants he needed for his potion shop. That was something Draco enjoyed and Harry went along with it. They saved money like that and Draco could choose the best quality for himself.
Every so often, he bent down to pick up a shell. Some were simple but had a wonderful color, others were simply exotic looking. He liked those.
Draco pushed open the door of their cute little house and was overwhelmed with the scent of rose. Stunned, he looked around and saw the entrance hall covered in deep red roses. He went further in and their living room, dining room, kitchen and everything else was covered in an abundance of big rose bouquets. What...?
Draco was not an easy person to be around. He knew that. But he prided himself in being very organized and structural. He was affectionate to Harry – or so he told himself – and he was very generous with his
He cleared his throat and pulled off the oxygen mask he had, "I have something to tell you. Ron, please, don't get angry."
The smell was pine-y, mossy, clear and so uniquely 'forest'. Harry loved the smell! Draco as not the biggest fan of it but he endured. Birds were flying around them, high up in the trees, and Harry whistled a matching tune to the birds which answered.
He looked at his boyfriend and now understood why he was never invited into his bedroom. It was miserable and killed the entire mood. Harry's smile looked forced and Draco knew that Harry knew that this was not normal. Having a minimal lifestyle was one thing, having simply nothing was very unusual.
But now Harry had a big ass problem. The fire on the table. Yes, another table was going to burn to a crisp. Harry whimpered. Draco loved this table. He freaking loved it so much that he promised to hurt Harry's balls and dick if he dared to scar it.
It grinned. Two rows of perfectly straight teeth gleamed in the darkness surrounding him. The sharp canines were especially fear inducing but Draco looked up to the eyes immediately.
Being together for five years didn't sound long for some people. But they knew each other for over twenty years now.
You are making (filtered) coffee for you and your boyfriend. Somehow, you manage to spill it everywhere and burn yourself on your left hand
Draco could control his ice powers so damn well. He rarely froze something. He could even summon it on purpose to have ice cold drinks in summer.
That let his husbands head turn around and he perked up, "Maybe I find the flowering pink dotted redhead mushroom in there! Wonderful thinking Harry, let's go!"
Slowly Harry blinked his eyes open and looked at his two best friends. He tried to smile, but failed. Another rush of pain went through him.
He wrote a quick note himself and bottled it up in the same glass bottle he received his note. He promised himself he would throw it in the sea later that day.
Ron choked on his spit while Hermione had tears in her eyes. They assumed the worst but this was even worse. She hiccupped and wiped over her eyes but now tears were rolling over her cheeks, "Why," she whispered. Why didn't Harry tell them this?
Their friend shook his head, "I am sorry. I only know I will die within this week. Can you both do me a favor? Please just put me in the grave next to my parents. Nothing fancy, only you and your family - the Weasleys. I don't want to have a big funeral."
“Comparably uneventful,” he says, waving his hand in a so-so gesture. “And… yours?” he tries again, and Harry, moved by the compassionate insistence, feels his resolve wavering. He reckons it wouldn’t be the worst idea to get a second, completely unbiased opinion. He’ll just have to tell the world’s vaguest story.
Draco speaks from far away again, and he feels the shake of a soft hand between his shoulder blades attempting to rouse him, but the bed is so comfy. He thinks,
He’s right, of course. Shrewd, when it’s most to Harry’s detriment. Harry shrugs again. “Okay, okay, I… er… I said something about… his mother. He didn’t take it well.”
Draco ducks his chin to close his eyes and pull in an expansive breath. When he looks back up, he no longer needs to question whether his face is reddening.
Harry looks just as surprised to see him, despite standing on his doorstep. He opens his mouth once or twice, then manages half a sentence before Pansy makes it over. “Draco, there’s something I need to—“
“Oh, piss off, Potter,” he snaps, uncreatively. The book hits the table beside him hard where he throws it down, and he pushes all his energy into making the bed tight enough to bounce a sickle.
beliefs. And sure, I first came to them because it’s what I’d heard from my parents, but by seventeen you can make your own mind up, and I still chose ignorance and acted on it… cruelly.”
“Giff-door!” she echoes, still laughing. Though she has her mother’s complexion and hair, that smile is all Weasley.
“No, she was quite thrilled. The young French witch? She visited for a day or so from Paris? The way Narcissa puts it, she’d thought you’d seen her off but caught a peak of you two sharing a cigarette and a kiss in the gardens… She sounded so happy for you, Draco. She loves you so much and to see you find someone—not to say it has to be something serious with… what’s her name, dear? Emily, maybe, or—“
Standing at the kitchen counter, though, his quill hovers above the parchment for at least a minute before he finally touches pen to paper.
folders were staring him down, haunting him. On one morning, he sleepily shuffled to the kitchen, eyes half-cracked, to see his Flourish and Blotts notes sitting by the kettle. He froze, wand halfway to tapping the kettle to life, staring at the folder he’d been sure was sitting on his dining room table.
His fears were compounded when the file for the Flourish and Blotts curse arrived at his doorstep, too. A paper bag with two Spoonfuls chocolate croissants sat on top with a note promising that Potter’s looking into getting the evidence to Draco’s lab. He chuckled a little at the idea of his study being lifted to the status of ‘laboratory’.
Potter gifts him a short smile, perhaps the first he’s earned, and Draco ignores the ways his eyes also widen for just a moment in fleeting surprise.
“Yeah, mate, don’t get me wrong but I’m pretty sure he’s said worse,” Ron adds. “So why’s this week got your wand in a twist?”
One day the front page instead was a loop of a dreadful-looking Potter with terrible dark circles under his eyes, a dark mess of hair even untidier than usual, trying to duck his head away from the camera flashes, all under giant block letters announcing “BOY WHO LIVED AND LONG-TIME GIRLFRIEND SPLIT.”
How beautiful it is, to find him sitting up and alive and generally okay, but the shocking rage he’s felt over the last half an hour with the realisation that someone he’s trusted is at fault grows entirely into a new form at the state of him.
. He mailed a copy to Narcissa from his new flat in London, not trusting himself to return to the Manor when he’d begun to feel so whole again.
Leave it to Draco, posh deep to his core, to pour boxes of egg noodles and vegetables and rice onto his finest plates. Harry abandons the study and pulls out a chair across from him. He likes watching Draco eat. He’s so polished and put together most of the time that there’s something deeply fascinating about watching him wrestle just as much with eating noodles as the Everyman. Before he can catch his prolonged stare, Harry looks back to his meal. He feels Draco’s eyes on him the second he removes his own.
“Are you going to invite me in?” he responds, voice booming, arm towering over Harry in a brace against the doorway exactly in the way he doesn’t like.
“I just remember how hard you were always working at Hogwarts towards your mastery,” she enthuses. “Invite me to the release party?”
“Well said how?” she presses. “Draco? Blaise?” She leans so far forward that her hair is in their chips. “Blaise, come onnn, what do you mean? Do you know, Draco?”
he thinks. He’d thrown out some yoghurt that Harry had insisted he’d eat by the expiration date tomorrow, knowing it was untrue. And then he’d rearranged Harry’s spices alphabetically. Only minorly criminal activity.
He turns at once, walking as fast as professionally possible to the lift, which creaks irritatingly slow towards the main floor, and when he bursts through the doors he fears he’s too late, that Draco has left. But he sees the flutter of a long coat—neatly tailored and fitting for a man he knows—turn the corner and he follows hastily. He almost runs right into him.
He spares a glance from Seamus to Ron and gives an indiscernible shake of his head. Draco knowing about his interest in men surely signifies that the dominoes are beginning to fall, but he’s in no rush to help them along.
“Best of three?” he jokes, but Pansy is already nodding enthusiastically and restarts her drumming just in time for a pretty young witch to step lightly by with a glass of wine. Her glossy black hair hangs like midnight water down her back as she hurries by without noticing the trio at all.
He frames Harry’s face between his hands, taking in his flushed cheeks, his wet lips, his relaxed eyes. He’s beautiful. “Sometimes,” he says, holding his gaze, “we have the exact same thoughts.”
Jack looks stunned. It shakes him and seems to wake him up, and his face settles into an intense look to rival the smirk of success on Draco’s, no longer dimpled and cheery.
Slowly and methodically, Harry listens close. He connects the quiet shushing noise to a music box, which Draco looks enthused to take home. There’s a small silver box, too, that feels like
Pansy finally drags herself out of the booth, sobering a bit when she realises Draco has grabbed his wand from the table and is really making to leave.
It happens so suddenly that Harry’s first instinct is that his friend is falling off his barstool. But then his lips meet Harry’s and he stills completely in shock.
.” Harry crosses the distance between them he’d just created, reaches out unthinkingly and takes Jack’s hands. “No, I’m so sorry, it’s me, it’s my fault.”
“Sure, Lars,” Harry says, feeling Draco’s stature close off even further. His shoulders are high and his hands are shoved deep in the centre pocket of the hoodie. Harry doesn’t feel so good himself—he and Jack rarely cross paths.
“Yes, if you… if that’s—I froze. At the pub. And I don’t blame you for leaving. But it was just shock, you have to know. Not disinterest. Something that I’d only
Harry’s not sure what he’s meant to say or do now that he’s been summoned down here, and so far what he has said has felt wrong. He tries to imagine what he would tell Ron, an old friend, but Draco is another beast entirely. With him, his instinct is to be a silent but supportive presence. A persevering lighthouse, rather than the coastguard.
Blaise reaches across the table and almost knocks Hermione’s drink over. She catches it quickly while he thumps Ron on the shoulder. “Ron’s my lad. I have the same answer, majority rules; you two have practically been together three months.”
, we can’t stop at Ashok Potter. We must see temples older than the Potters. Forests older than the temples.”
The voice, at least, hasn’t gone hard yet. He speaks quietly, but it’s perfectly clear and warm. “If we don’t go now, I’ll lose my nerve.”
“There’s another table on the porch, in case you wanted to work outside,” Harry says behind him. “And the kitchen is that way,” he points towards the other end of the living room. “Bedroom and bathroom upstairs.”
“I think I’ll firecall Andromeda. When I get back,” he mentions after a bit, then turns away from the view. They begin ambling back down the other side of the hill, not explicitly touching, but standing close enough for their shoulders to brush with every step.
Most of the time spent at Draco’s in the following weeks is spent quietly, but Harry doesn’t mind. His study becomes an oasis, separate from the rest of Harry’s life—a peaceful escape unbeknownst to even his closest friends, only because for now telling them would take the magic away.
He doesn’t smell like himself, Harry discovers with a frown when he joins him. He smells like St. Mungo’s, like soap and someone else’s laundry. When Draco’s arms close around him tightly, he’s not sure who’s comforting who.
“Oh, I remember that, yeah, I… I didn’t mean to make you upset, it was just a joke. It just came out. But no more jokes like that, if they’ll… if you don’t want to hear about that.”
It’s while sitting on that old mattress that Mari finally frees Draco. Harry sits close, touches the back of his head gingerly, staring at the rust-red on his fingers as the man beside him shakes out his hands. After flexing his fingers he turns to Harry and guides his head forward without a word, fingers gently parting his hair.
d by his own possession was the first sign that Draco’s distracted today, the second comes with a soft knock at his door. He looks up with his head cocked in confusion, and after shifting Dante out of a slumber and onto the floor, he walks quickly to the door, opening it a crack and then fully to reveal, of all people, Narcissa Malfoy.
Just yesterday, he’d mentioned Luna while bustling about Draco’s kitchen—two weeks into their study nights he’d found the urge to prove his skills in the kitchen and was letting himself because it was a Friday afternoon. Draco had allowed him to ramble as if she was nothing more than a passerby from his school days.
Potter chuckles and looks above him to the screens intently, so he focuses his attention on the pint set before him. It’s sweating a ring onto the wooden tabletop.
“Sickle for your thoughts,” he speaks warmly. He’s dropped the camera back into the bag and propped a knee up on the seat of the boat, his hands flat on top.
“Good to see you, Draco. The Unforgiveable objects are such an intriguing new realm of research, I’m utterly proud. Utterly proud, indeed.”
“What do you want me to say?” Draco responds crossly. “That I’m disappointed? Worried for your wellbeing, for the case? Sure, but I can’t fix that tonight. I don’t feel like being unhappy and we can talk about it later. But I know I’m good at what I do. You can lay off that.”
!” she’d shouted. Her face was laced not with anger but worry. “Circles under your eyes like I’ve never seen, you can’t keep a train of thought, you forget things the second I say them…”
“We have some work to do to get to lunch, but we can stay as long as you want,” he says softly so as not to disturb Harry as he approaches him, but he shakes his head nonchalantly and gets to his feet.
He can tell that Draco doesn’t know what to do—feels the same unsure but determined energy that was present when he showed Harry affection in the kitchen on Sunday—but he can appreciate a good effort, and there is real comfort in the arms around him now. He stays there for a minute.
He’ll work from home—the paperwork is surely already on his desk, just waiting to be summoned. It’s not as if he has a plan to study the physical evidence yet, anyway, without speaking with Malfoy.
It feels like a winning comeback, so when Draco responds indifferently, Harry scowls. The hypocrite. A trace of the easy competitiveness that’s threaded itself through their relationship since school rears its head.
He won’t last. If Draco’s suggesting he has to handle what he thinks he’s suggesting, sleep so close, keep his composure, he’ll fall apart.
With the round called he pivots sourly for his water, hiding his face, and Draco comes blustering towards Harry, spitting the mouthpiece out and buzzing with energy.
With a flick of his wand, the radio is on low, breaking up the silence of his office. The case files haven’t changed since he last saw them, of course. He wonders if Draco is having the same problem—if he hasn’t burnt his copies out of spite yet. At least he has the evidence, now.
He wonders when Potter had learned such patience. Whether he’d meant it to be so maddening not to respond as intended when Draco wanted to rile him up. Rather childishly, he thinks it wasn’t half as fun to nag on him when he didn’t nag back. Like he’d stamped out the last embers of a fire instead of adding oxygen.
Draco disappears to change. While the kettle boils, Harry washes last night’s dishes and wipes the counters down, and when he opens the mug cupboard and finds it empty, he forages back through the chaotic study to collect cup after cup of stale, half-drunk tea and coffee and washes those, too.
Draco travels to the couch and sits instead of engaging with Harry’s growing temper—the good mood earlier evidently a food-based outlier. He’s stressed, and not with him but because of him. It’s okay.
Suddenly, Draco swivels up, his feet falling to plant themselves on either side of Harry, almost knocking his coffee over. It’s hard not to laugh at the dichotomy between what had been occupying his anxieties and the very limbs in question, now so close that they’re pinning him in. He won’t flatter himself—Draco hasn’t noticed his foot on the biscuit plate either. He’s too preoccupied to be allergic to Harry’s touch.
“Yes, dear, for something. The purpose of the tea. A delivery. I’m so absentminded.” She laughs lightly and Draco’s grasp on the cliffside loosens. “I thought, why bother with wards I’m adequate at when my son is a charms genius?”
After that, Flitwick cajoled Draco into submitting a paper on the spell to the National Charms Association for official classification. This took months to write up, not including the time to improve upon flaws in his original spell that he couldn’t bring himself to ignore. By the end, he had the writing for what would become his first published work:
He left a while later, all smiles as if they hadn’t held a miniature Mind Healer session, and Draco attempted to sleep, succeeding only so far as to get to know his ceiling better. He felt like a stranger in his own body, incapable of piecing together a comprehensible anthology of his thoughts and feelings after such a strange afternoon.
“That’s… pleasant.” He falls onto the couch and curls up as if he’s going to go right back to sleep.
Draco dusts some sand from his shins, looking anywhere but ahead. Harry’s gaze gets so intense when he’s discussing this keenly. “Yes, in a way. Like… if I’m going to bring you to connect with your past, with the
, then runs back inside while Harry gets comfortable, and he’s still left debating whether they’ll even need a warming charm on such a nice autumn day when he returns holding two mugs of tea and offers one to Harry.
“I love when you call it the ‘Gay Thing’,” he says, eyes narrowed playfully. “Makes me feel quite special.”
“Nevermind, then.” Harry scrunches his nose. “No thinking allowed.” He walks back towards the sofa, tugging him along for a few paces before he stops in his tracks. Harry feels him stiffen and drops his hand quickly.
“Do it however you want,” Harry sighs in exasperation. “And don’t kill the messenger—someone’s already trying to.”
Draco fell asleep tucked into Harry’s body, wrapped in his arms, listening to his quiet breathing, but he wakes up almost off the edge of the bed, laying at a forty-five-degree angle, his arm dangling. His mouth is wide open and he closes it quickly, thinking of all the teasing Harry’s given him about his wild unconsciousness, and turns back towards the middle of the bed.
Harry meets her eyes contemplatively, trying to piece the puzzle together. “So on public record, it looks like there’s animosity, but the involved parties know it was easily resolved.”
.” Malfoy snaps, finally turning his eyes on Harry’s. There’s an urgency in them that commands unquestionable authority and it springs Harry into action.
“We did a number on each other,” Harry corrects, taking a big sip. “But separating let me… find something new about myself. Something that Ginny had noticed first. I started seeing men and realised that—with the women, they were never as perfect as Ginny? But these blokes could be far from perfect and I’d still… you know.”
He doesn’t know what to say, because he can imagine, if he had to hear that she’d been in danger and then still didn’t have eyes on her for weeks after, just what that would do to his psyche. He stabs into his cottage pie glumly.
They switch positions, and Draco spends time carefully copying the position, letting Harry prod him into minor adjustments, and running it a few times. Slowly Harry starts to fight back. He’s a good teacher—Draco always feels like he’s being challenged at a level that neither belittles him nor dominates him too severely to let him learn.
This gets his attention, snapping his head over to Harry, whose eyebrows are raised in concern and exasperation.
Draco’s brows had already been furrowed in bewilderment, yet at this judgmental salutation, they somehow push even closer.
“I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox and which you were probably saving for breakfast,” Draco said in response, picking off a square of chocolate from the bar sitting by the dough Harry had built. He popped it in his mouth. “Forgive me… they were delicious, so sweet and so cold.”
“Where’s Harry!” Draco screamed as Neville kept an arm around him. He could see Ron and Hermione swept up in the crowd as well and the noise around him was nearly unbearable, screams and curses bouncing around the entrance hall as they were dragged along.
“He beat you!” Ron shouted while Draco cried “You’re a liar!” Across the way, he saw his parents find him in the crowd with identical looks of horror on their faces. Whatever had silenced them before suddenly broke and the defenders of Hogwarts began to scream and shout, Draco among them, fury coursing through his veins. He wouldn’t remember, after, what he had shouted, only that it was all he could do to stop himself running across that gap.
“He desired her, that was all,” Voldemort sneered, dismissive. “When she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him–”
“No sword,” Weasley repeated, scowling. “That double-crossing little scab–” he started but Draco interrupted him.
Harry held onto Draco’s hand and pulled him forward, until they were by the Weasleys (or Draco assumed they were, given that they all had red hair aside from Fleur, who waved at him).
“What about Dementors?” he asked, his voice carrying over the still air. “Let ‘em have free rein, they’d find him quick enough!” he suggested and there was a tut.
Draco moved further into the hall, eyes searching. Ron and Hermione were still with the Weasleys, though Mr Weasley had moved to sit where Draco had been before, between the bodies of Lupin and Nymphadora, his head hanging low. Hermione looked up as she saw Draco approach, but with one small shake of his head, he told her everything she needed to know.
“Why, Madam Lestrange!” a voice called from behind them. They all turned and Draco’s heart lurched – he knew the man approaching them. He darted forward to whisper in Hermione’s ear.
"They'll be alright, won't they?" Harry asked in a low voice, raising his hand to wave. Draco gave a small snort, lifting his hand too.
The night sky was lighter, though not by much, and he joined Bill Weasley where he stood, watching Potter who was digging in a patch of ground that overlooked the sea. Bill looked around at him as he came closer, but turned back to watch Potter.
“SILENCE!” the Dark Lord shouted across the gap between the two sides as the wails and cries crescendoed. He whipped his wand around and there was a loud ‘
“Did you see! Did you see, Potter–” but Potter was crying. His face was streaked with tears as he stared at the place where the owl Patronus had been, and his hands were shaking as he wiped his cheeks with them and then he was turning and walking and then running and then –
“If you know the location of Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy, you’d do well to keep that information to yourself,” she said in a low, stern whisper and Draco nodded, blinking heavily. He let himself tip sideways and he was asleep before his head even hit the pillow.
"But what if-," he heard himself say, Hermione coming up behind him to grip at his hand in her own. Her grip was verging on painful, and Harry clung to it. Let Draco go in, alone? But what if the boys were hurt, what if they were scared, what if they didn't trust Draco to go with him, what if-
“I’m sorry,” he eventually said after a few minutes of Draco glowering at him. “I don’t know… I don’t know what I can say to you,” he said and Draco scowled.
of the Deathly Hallows do, it’s a ridiculous fairy tale. You’re trying to fit everything into it, but it doesn’t work that way! What proof do you have?” she asked and Potter thought for a second.
“If they do, I am unaware of its precise location,” he said primly and Draco stifled a laugh. Colour rose on Yaxley’s cheekbones, and he looked away first. Snape went back to his book with a small smirk on his face.
Every snap of a branch outside sounded like footprints, every bird chatter sounded like someone talking. He dragged over one of the armchairs to sit by the tent entrance and curled up there, dragging a blanket over himself as he read. The morning was chilly and his breath rose in a fog in front of his face as he tried to read and not panic as the minutes went by.
“How about your dear cousin, Malfoy?” Rowle sneered across the table. Draco felt his shoulders tighten, but didn’t say anything in response, picking at the flakes of salmon on his plate. A jeer from further down the table distracted Rowle and he looked away. Draco let out the breath he had been holding.
"Why, yes, he did. Two rowdy little boys, shouting and pulling against him they were. Why, one of them even kicked at Lucius' legs! I hope he learned his lesson, what with the jolly good whack Lucius gave him," she said, sniffing disdainfully. Harry felt rage boil up inside him and he turned to shout into the atrium.
With a great cry, it flapped once more and took off from the lake edge, rising higher and higher into the sky until it was swallowed by the waking stars.
The forest was quiet this early in the morning so he hummed the Hogwarts school song and tried to search for Potter and Granger. A few times he heard twigs snapping behind him, as though someone had just stepped out from behind a tree, but when he turned, no one was there.
“Do you really want to read that?” he asked and Hermione opened the beaded bag swinging from her wrist, dropping the book inside with a ‘
“Anything?” he asked, and Potter shook his head, setting his bowl in his lap. In front of his crossed legs, the blue flames sputtered but continued to burn, casting the snow around them in a ghostly blue light.
“You make it sound so simple,” Ron said, pressing the heels of his palms into his eyes. Draco’s heart broke for him – he could see from Ron’s expression that he was beyond devastated, that his grief had hollowed him out in a second.
The surface of the mirror itself was twisting, rippling outwards. Around them, the Aurors stood straighter, pulling out their wands from where they had been stowed away. While Hermione and Ron leaned back, Harry took a step forward as a figure emerged from the mirror.
“Or what, Mercer?” he said in a sneering tone of voice. “I remember when you were too frightened to open my door, boy, and don’t you forget it,” he told the Death Eater, and his fellows tittered in response. “I ask again, what is all this racket? And why in Merlin’s name were there Dementors out here??”
“What are you using it for?” he asked and Potter shrugged but did not answer. The Snitch fluttered by, catching the firelight and turning burnished for a flash. Draco, without thinking, reached up a hand and caught it before Potter could and was left breathless once more by the smile Potter gave him.
“Huh?” Draco said aloud, leaning forward in his chair. Harry jumped a little, obviously not having realised that Draco was now awake, but Draco’s eyes were on the portrait. A white dot had appeared at the end of the painted tunnel and it was growing bigger and bigger until the girl came back into frame, but there was someone else with her, taller than she was, though they were limping. The two figures grew and grew until only their heads and shoulders filled the frame and Draco rose to his feet out of his chair as the portrait above the mantelpiece swung open and Neville Longbottom, his hair overgrown and cuts peppered over his face, clambered out, letting out a shout of delight.
“He might’ve made it all up!” Potter snapped, slipping inside the tent. Draco followed, Weasley and Hermione bringing up the rear. “He might’ve just been telling us stories to bide his time while the Death Eaters came!”
"Those boys, Grandmama - they're my sons," he told her with a smile, and Delphinia looked as though she had swallowed a lemon. "And that man," he gestured at Harry, "He's their other father. My father, he kidnapped them yesterday. He took them from Kings Cross, and we've come to get them,"
one. Do you know of any in the school, Baron? If I can find it, I can redeem–” But there was a rush of noise and the common room passage was opened once more. Draco dove behind one of the sprawling leather sofas, tucking himself away, the ghost of the Baron sinking into the wall next to the fireplace, drifting away.
“I believe both,” Harry said, shrugging one shoulder and there was a flicker of shock that crossed Voldemort’s face, though he quickly masked it by laughing, his high, cold laugh wrenching the air in two.
"I asked him to come here, Hermione - remember?" he said and Hermione's expression softened slightly.
“My cousin. I only met her today. She seemed… fun,” he said, and Blaise touched his shoulder gently. Draco sniffed and wiped his eyes. He looked over and Fleur was looking at him with tears in her eyes. He looked away. “What happened to you?” he asked and Blaise settled down on his heels next to him.
“I didn’t want it to be like this,” he murmured and Draco marked his place in the book with a finger. Potter picked at some blades of grass, avoiding his gaze. “I wanted today to mean something. To tell us where to go next. But we’re just –” and he tore one of the blades in two. “- going in circles, aren’t we?” he asked, turning his gaze to Draco, who sighed.
He was just about to get out of the armchair and check what the paperbag had served up for lunch when there was a pop from just outside the wards, and Potter, Hermione and Weasley came staggering back through, all covered in what looked like a thick layer of dust, a large cut bleeding from Potter’s forehead and Weasley limping slightly.
“I think Harry’s right,” Hermione said, the first time she had spoken in the office. She was looking at the portraits surrounding them with interest, though there were dark smudges under her eyes. All eyes then turned to Draco and he hesitated for just a second, and then caught Harry’s gaze.
“I must be coming down with something,” he suggested and Pansy studied his face for a long while. He looked away first, unable to meet her dark eyes.
“Wait for me,” he sneered. They gave him identically pained looks and he slumped back in the armchair. “But if the deal has been struck, you can’t back out now. That would be worse for us all.”
"Thank you, Harry," he said Harry quirked an eyebrow at him. Malfoy shrugged. "It seems ridiculous to call you by your surname in what was previously our marital home," he pointed out and Harry swallowed his reply. He merely nodded and then led the way up the stairs, hugging Albus' jumper close to his chest.
“Aren’t you listening?” Harry sounded impatient now. “Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!”
“I thought–” he tried to say around heaving sobs. Potter had slipped from his chair and was crouched in front of him now, hands braced on Draco’s knees, trying to comfort him. Draco wiped his nose on the back of his jumper and coughed, trying to speak again. “I thought that maybe, deep down, they were good people actually. That they were just scared and were following along because they didn’t know what to do. But my mum–” Another wave of sobs came over him and he had to close his eyes, ducking his head down. “My mum said Hermione was ‘
Without Potter, the train felt surprisingly empty, though as usual it was bursting with the chatter of excited students. Draco wasn’t able to join in, as he somehow felt defeated, though Blaise and Pansy kept trying to draw him into conversation. He made small noises of acknowledgement and kept his eyes trained on the speeding countryside outside.
“More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time,” he said, his red eyes glowing in the firelight. The snake slithered over his trailing robes, her eyes trailed on Dolohov. A particularly hard shudder sent Draco’s wand slipping from his fingers and clattering to the ground. He bent to pick it up from the expanding pool of blood on the floor around Dolohov and wiped it shakily on his shirt sleeve. The Dark Lord was still talking to Rowle, who was shuddering with every breath. “You call me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco” – he turned his red slit-pupiled eyes to Draco – “give Rowle another taste of our displeasure,”
"Because we're the best hope you have, Harry," he said, and Harry's heart clenched. Hermione reached over and smoothed his hair back from his face.
need us in the morning," he said and then he used the banister to pull himself to standing. Malfoy pushed himself to his feet and nodded.
“I mean, is it possible to… join someone in a dream? Meet somewhere while you’re both asleep?” he asked and she lowered her untouched fork.
“We’d better go. Leave them here. Maybe the walls will give out and they’ll drown,” he suggested hopefully. Draco, still feeling a little weak, gave him a small smile and followed him out of the common room. “Where have you been?” Blaise hissed as they walked through the corridors. “Pansy’s been beside herself. You just… disappeared back in October. And then we heard about all that stuff going on at the Manor over Easter–”
“Anyone who wants at Malfoy has to go through me,” he said firmly and Draco felt a rush of affection for Ron Weasley, who stared out at the group of students with his jaw set firmly.
“You cannot change this,” Dumbledore told him and Draco blinked rapidly. The dream, the memory, swam around him and he choked back a sob.
“I think we need to move,” Draco said after a long stretch of silence. “There was a lot of magic going off here last night and if they’re tracking us, they might pick up the scent. We should probably change locations,” and Potter thought for a second and then nodded.
“Yes, at Magdalen College. What about you? I heard you went off to the Continent for your degree?” she asked, and Malfoy bobbed his head once - his white blond hair caught the light and for a second turned into a halo around his head.
“We leave in half an hour. I am told by my most trusted advisor,” and here Voldemort swept an arm to gesture at Snape, who inclined his head, as if humbled by the praise. “That Dumbledore’s pathetic Order of the Phoenix plan to remove Harry Potter from a safe location soon after sunset. To hide under a cloak of darkness,” he sneered, his tone mocking, and the table laughed. They were well trained. “We will fight them in the air. In the night. And then dawn will rise on a new age!” Voldemort finished his speech and there was applause and cheers once again. The snake bobbed its head and Aunt Bellatrix looked positively giddy.
“Come on, let’s go back to sleep. I always sleep better if you’re there,” he told Draco, offering his hand. Draco took it and stood, waving his wand as they left the kitchen to dim the lights. They picked their way across the sitting room back to their sleeping bags. As Potter settled he turned on his side to face Draco and reached out a hand under the coffee table – Draco took it. The angle was a bit awkward and Draco knew he’d wake with a numb arm, but he fell asleep holding Potter’s hand and didn’t wake for the rest of the night.
“Probably hiding in the sewers somewhere with Potter,” he added and Pansy laughed. Draco found the right page – under a list of ‘Muggle-borns of Interest’, there was Granger's name along with her age (
Granger offered her hand, palm up to Draco, and he took his wand out from behind his ear and took her hand. She offered her other hand to Potter who took it as well.
“I have it here, if you want?” he asked, offering it up and Potter took it, opening it up in front of him on the bench, bending over to look at it. Draco looked away, feeling heat rise in his cheeks.
Draco let his backpack slip from his shoulders and he worked with Granger and Potter to secure the wards around the clearing. “
His hair was long, longer than it had ever been. His jeans hung loosely on his hips, the knees scuffed. His well worn boots were no longer the shining black they had been, but scuffed to grey and creased, and the jumper he wore fell over his hands, one forearm dark and sticky – how none of them had noticed was beyond him. But his eyes – they were sharp and fierce in a way they hadn’t been before. Despite the situation he now found himself in, he looked – confident. Happy, even. Whole. Healed.
was a Slytherin, wasn’t he? Maybe there’s something down there. It’s the dead of night, no one will be awake,” he added when she gave him a look that suggested she didn’t approve of this plan.
“Malfoy,” she replied and they eyed each other. Draco pushed himself up to standing and brushed down his thin jacket, acquired from the Lost and Found at Epping Forest, as he stood. Granger didn’t move. Her hair was pulled back into a messy plait that was fraying and her sweater looked grimy underneath the coat she wore. She looked tired, the dying light of the forest casting long shadows down her face.
“Some tea please, Bugsy,” he requested and she bobbed him a small curtsey in her pillowcase dress and then disappeared with another
Draco woke with a start and lunged for his backpack before he was even fully awake. He had obtained a forestry map of England from one of the tourist centres he had walked past in his exploration of the English national parks, and he scanned it desperately, looking for a Witch Wood.
After that revelation, it seemed like Weasley and Hermione leapt into action. They poured over every book Hermione had in her arsenal, discussed at length if Diagon Alley was a more significant place than the orphanage that the Dark Lord had once lived at, and argued whether they should look for the wand over the Horcruxes.
“Well done, m’boy!” Amrose Swott bellowed, his arms raised high as he clapped his hands. The voice that Draco had heard all those months ago from Snape’s office, Phineas Nigellus called, “And let it be noted that Slytherin house played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!” over the shouts of his fellow Headmasters, and he winked at Draco when he caught him watching.
“No, not anymore. I believe that pure-bloods are dying out, but that’s because of our own stubbornness in refusing to marry Muggle-borns or half-bloods. I think blood purity was once valued but isn’t now,” he added and from the corner of his eye, he saw Hermione give him a small, pleased smile. “I think that your talent with magic is entirely unrelated to your blood status. Take Hermione, for example–” He tilted his head to face her and she gave him a confused look. “The brightest witch of our age. Blood purity doesn’t have a thing to do with it,” he told her and she beamed at him.
“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, a long time ago,” Potter said over the sound of seagulls. “I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it any more; it was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know – but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the reumour, it can’t have been difficult.” He blinked and it seemed like his eyes were closed for a second too long, and then they opened again. His eyes were bright against the dark smudges under them, and Potter swayed slightly where he stood.
“I know,” he said quietly and Potter nodded, giving him another long look before heading back to the tent.
“Why do you have Death Eater scum tagging along–” but Weasley didn’t finish that sentence before Hermione rounded on him again.
“Lupin was the best Defence teacher we ever had,” Blaise said gruffly. “I saw him go down. Dolohov got him. Wasn’t
“Stop looking! She doesn’t care!” he hissed at her and Hermione had to drag Bellatrix’s black eyes away from a woman crying in the padlocked doorway to Florean Fortescue’s. A bedraggled man lurched towards them from a shaded doorway, mumbling about his children, but they dodged past him continuing on their way.
“Maybe I am!” he snarled, and he threw up his hands as if warding himself. “Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don’t expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, trust me even though I don’t trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!” On the last word his voice cracked and his eyes were deeply pained.
Greyback let out a low appreciative whistle and Draco tried to stifle the panic rising in his throat. “Ve-e-ery nice,” Greyback said, taking it off the Snatcher with a low hum of appreciation. “Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?” he asked the group and Potter spoke before anyone else.
“Stan Shunpike,” Weasley said thickly around his bloody nose and Greyback let out a sound that might have been a laugh but sounded more like a bark.
They Apparated back into the Bodleian Library, pulling on their gowns as they exited and once again joined their applicants in the atrium, picking up their badges for the second day of exams. Harry spotted Malfoy leaning against one of the walls, and he caught Harry’s eye before giving a small smile and then ducking his head down again, frowning.
“Draco,” Snape said and he turned to look back at him. Snape was watching him with the same practised neutrality, the same coolness he looked at everyone, but even Draco could see some of the fear from Draco’s face reflected in his eyes. “Your mother will be most upset if you don’t return. Don’t be late,” he said in a heavy tone and Draco nodded and turned away again, walking away on weak legs.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said, turning his gaze back to Draco. He dropped into a crouch, frowning. “It’s too dangerous. You can’t,” he told him quietly and then he stood and turned, disappearing behind the trees and leaving Draco to wake up in his tent, alone and breathless.
“Yes sir, since 3 years ago,” Dobby said, proudly showing the hem of his Hogwarts tea towel that poked out under the bobbly jumper he was wearing. “How did Master Draco be finding the kitchens, sir?” Mibby came back over with a small pot of honey and she bobbed Draco a small curtsey and gave Dobby a strange look before rejoining the other elves around the kitchens.
He cast a quick look around and then ducked around the sign, crouching to lift the stone. A scrap of a pamphlet had been stuck to the bottom of it, crumpled and caked with sodden dirt, but Draco peeled it off and wiped the dirt away.
Draco landed, coughing and retching, onto a stretch of damp sand, his trousers instantly soaked through. The goblin, still in his arms, groaned. He settled the goblin onto the sand, checking him for any obvious injuries. From the awkward angles they rested at, his legs were clearly broken.
"Oh, he's in there. He wouldn't have set Obscura otherwise," he said. Ron made a noise of agreement.
“How’re you holding up, dear?” he heard a maternal-sounding voice ask him, and he looked up to see Mrs Weasley standing over him. Her face was blotchy and red from crying, but she gave him an encouraging smile and he nodded at her.
“The Mark,” he managed to gasp out before the pain hit again and this time he couldn’t stop the scream that left him. Potter was making soothing sounds and called for Granger, reaching for Draco’s arm, holding onto Draco’s wrist when the pain suddenly ebbed away, though it still felt hot and angry. Draco gasped again and fell back onto the floor, tears running down the sides of his face.
“He might kill me himself if he finds out I’m not,” he said and Harry gave him a small smile before pulling away and standing up. Draco stood as well, dusting himself off.
“It’s a boy!” Lupin crowed, righting himself, his shaking hands fumbling with the clasp of his cloak as Bill wrestled the door shut behind him. “We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father–”
“I was - Cameron,” he said and they both looked at him expectantly. He waved a hand in what he hoped was a dismissive fashion, though he didn’t necessarily feel it. “We ended it before I came over. He wasn’t interested in doing a long-distance relationship if I got the Fellowship, and neither was I,” Harry admitted and Hermione bobbed her head in agreement.
The dream was warm again, and soothing on his arm. He felt something brushing it softly and opened his eyes to Potter knelt over him, lightly touching his forearm where the Dark Mark was livid against his skin.
“Harry?” it was one of the other prisoners, bound on Draco’s right. He turned his head to look and couldn’t help but smile, recognising the man sitting next to him.
“All over, mate. We were in Hackfall Forest when they caught up with us. How about you?” he asked and Dean gave him a wry smile.
“Too nice,” he hissed in her ear as they passed Tom, who looked stunned at the morning greeting. “My Aunt would never bid someone ‘good morning’ like a common Muggle,” he explained to her in a firm tone and Hermione took a steadying breath.
He found a quiet stretch of corridor in the basements and sat down heavily on the stone floor next to a portrait of a bowl of fruit. He tilted his head back and pressed it to the wall, letting the cold stone soothe the building headache. When he next opened his eyes, he nearly jumped about a foot in the air.
! Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?” she asked, turning to face Draco. He glanced at Hermione, whose chin quivered.
“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!” Father reached behind him and managed to grab one of Draco’s arms, hauling him forward painfully by the wrist. He moved slightly, a shaft of light appearing over Potter’s swollen and mottled face, his glasses askew over his nose, only the faintest hint of those green eyes appearing through the swollen lids. “Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv–” Father was saying excitedly and Draco pointedly kept his gaze averted.
,” Draco murmured, holding that feeling tight in his chest and the silver mist swooped from the end of his wand, turning in a graceful arc, silver light forming into two wings and a beak and eyes that would have been amber if they hadn’t been made of starlight.
A house-elf in a neat dress and pinafore was humming to herself in the kitchen, and she looked up as Harry entered. She gave a quick bow and gestured for him to take a seat at the long scrubbed wooden table that had been in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place since he could remember.
It was like some nightmare version of a carnival game. Harry, swinging upside down with his face ruddy, tried to stick the tip of the sword through the handle of the cup. Draco, as tempted as he was to shout encouragement (and even a few ‘
"Oh, well," Delphinia said, leaning back in her swing. It drifted to and fro lazily for a moment, while she fluttered her fan thoughtfully. She looked between Draco and Harry a few times, and then rolled her shoulders and nodded resolutely to herself. "I can't tell you exactly where they are, Draco, but they are here, darling. They're in this house. If I were you… I would have a look in all the
“Draco, is it him?” Father asked him over his shoulder and Draco, still being petted by his mother, tried to pull away, though she held him tight.
“Bellatrix,” Blaise said darkly and Draco felt his jaw tighten. “Who is she?” Blaise asked gently and Draco coughed wetly. He realised he was crying.
are my people. Not them, not those people out there–” He threw an arm wide, gesturing out of the hole in the side of the castle. “- You. You, and Harry and Hermione, and your brothers, and Albus
“This is a dream,” Potter murmured, almost like he was trying to convince himself that Draco was only a figment of his imagination. He blinked and picked up the conversation about Draco’s cousin. “Regulus Black swapped out the locket. He hid it from Voldemort,” he added and Draco frowned, feeling his forehead pinch together.
He lurched to his feet and began to run over the damp, waterlogged sand, tripping and pushing, his eyes trained forward as Dobby sank to his knees and Potter caught him, cradling him gently. Potter’s hand hovered over the knife and fluttered there for a second. Draco was close enough to hear him now.
“They can’t produce them. Though my mother always said that hers would be a snake and my father’s would be a peacock,” he said with disgust and he could tell Potter was trying very hard not to laugh as he schooled his face into neutral pleasantness. Potter nodded.
“Where’s Harry?” he asked and she opened her mouth to reply but then shut it, glancing around frantically.
“Oh, right… Hermione,” Potter said but his eyes flickered over to the chest of drawers where he had last heard Draco. “I think she wants me to go upstairs with her,” he said and Granger nodded, as though steeling herself.
The days spent planning in that cramped back room, crowded around Griphook’s hand drawn maps as he told them about traps and alarms, guard routes and any theft-preventions, turned into weeks in the blink of an eye. Time seemed to slip by them, even as Draco and Harry snuck away for stolen kisses on the beach, and soon, Ollivander was well enough to travel to the Weasley’s Aunt Muriel, and the household crowded into the sitting room to see him off.
It had seemed so simple then, to have children. After all the work they'd put in, the spells and the potions, after all that, it seemed so easy. They're born and you raise them, and hope that they don't stumble into a War, like their parents had. It had never even occurred to Harry that maybe the boys would be kidnapped. It never occurred to him that a parent might - possibly, terrifyingly - outlive their child.
“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,” she said contemptuously and Travers inclined his head, conceding the point. “Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers,” she said and Draco could’ve smacked his forehead. She shouldn’t push it. Travers brushed the comment aside, looking down at the people sitting in the doorways.
“If it is Potter, you need to take us to Malfoy Manor,” he shouted over the hubbub of noise. The Snatchers quieted a little. “The Dark Lord resides with my family. He will reward you greatly if you take Potter directly to him,” he added and he heard an outraged noise from his left – Weasley, he was sure.
"It was one of you that took them! One of the Death Eaters, someone that you fucking knew, Malfoy! Someone who probably sat in your fucking house, had dinner at your fucking dining table, probably fucking tortured Muggles right next to you, SOMEONE YOU KNEW. You fucking tell me, Malfoy, who the fuck has taken my sons, because I swear to Merlin, I will rip them limb from limb," Harry screamed back, taking a few steps forward, reaching to grab the front of Malfoy's jumper, but Neville was there suddenly, putting himself between them.
Did Snape know? Draco pushed past a group of first-year Hufflepuffs who squealed as he ran ahead. He had left the trembling third-year at the door to the Dark Arts classroom as he raced to Snape’s office. He pushed through another group of Gryffindors who scowled and cursed at him as he went by, but their words fell on deaf ears. His boots, worn for a Herbology class he was now missing, pounded down the hallway as he ran, mimicking his racing heart.
He didn’t want Harry to do this. What if he didn’t come back this time? But before he could protest, Harry had closed his eyes and then he was a dead weight in Draco’s arms. Draco lowered them both to the floor quickly, Harry cradled in his arms as Ron and Hermione watched.
“Ah, yeah, I haven’t mentioned it have I?” he said and Granger giggled. Potter stood and pulled from the collar of his t-shirt a small, brown Mokeskin pouch, the drawstrings of which were looped around his neck. He pulled it off over his head and drew it open, reaching inside and withdrawing a long piece of silver-y fabric. He dropped the pouch onto the dining table and then drew the fabric around himself, turning it in his hands and then his whole body disappeared from view. Draco gaped at him.
Once, Draco had yearned to be among them, join their ranks and realise the Dark Lord’s goal. But during this last year, especially over Christmas break, the number of Death Eaters in the house rose weekly, and Draco felt his skin crawl whenever he found one trawling through the library, snatching books from their shelves and turning the pages roughly before putting it back in the wrong place, or in the kitchen, ordering the Manor elves who didn’t even belong to them to give them food, drink, prepare elaborate meals without thinking who was going to pay for it in the end.
as she twisted from side to side in the atrium, stood amongst the relieved candidates that had just exited their last paper. Harry felt drained, mentally and physically and Malfoy looked like he did as well. He was leaning against the wall next to them, his shoulders rounded as he pinched the bridge of his nose.
"I know. Do you think you can help?" she asked and Malfoy looked over to the image of pillar, and nodded.
“Please be sitting, sir, Mibby will be bringing you a cup of tea,” the elf said, gesturing to a seat at the equivalent of the Hufflepuff table. He sat himself on a stool that had been left there and watched the house-elves bustle around him. Some of them were carrying mops and buckets, others stacks of clean white sheets, obviously off to tend to the dormitories and common rooms. One of the house-elves carried a bundle of firewood past him, but glanced up as it went past and did a double-take, sending the firewood crashing to the floor. The other elves around them sent up a chorus of ‘
“Fidelius Charm,” Bill replied, picking his way through the sofas to join Potter in the doorframe. “Dad’s Secret Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m Secret Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that’s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. There isn’t much room here, but she’s got plenty. Griphook’s legs are on the mend, Fleur’s given him Skele-Gro – we could probably move them in an hour or–”
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?” Draco shouted over the sounds of spells firing around the cavernous space. Harry skidded to a halt next to one of the dragon’s legs and gestured frantically at them. Draco swore loudly.
, get to the door, the door!” he shrieked in a panic and Goyle moaned behind them, and Harry’s hand shot out and snatched something from a pile of smouldering junk, before he righted them and leaned down over the handle, sending them hurtling towards the door.
"Did you find anything last night?" Harry asked, and Hermione flicked her wand at the spider diagram on the wall - it shivered and then moved around, as if orbiting itself.
“-wasn’t yours,” Harry was saying with a tone of victory in his voice. “Snape was Dumbledore’s, Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother. And you never realised it, because of the thing you can’t understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?” There was no answer from Voldemort. “Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” Harry explained, his voice almost gentle. “The same as my mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realised – he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?”
There was a small noise from behind them and he turned to see that Harry had turned away from the group, one hand pressed to his head. He let go of Hermione’s arm.
“I’ll go find him. Blaise, stay here,” Blaise opened his mouth to protest but Draco cut him off. “No, really. I won’t be long, he can’t have gone far,”
Draco found his eyes sting with tears at that, and Harry reached out and took his hand, lacing their fingers together. He did not stop talking though, not until they reached where Harry had been leading them.
It was another late afternoon sitting watching the clouds pass over the ornate fountain set in the lower grounds. His book for the day, a collection of old faerie-tales, had been put to one side in favour of pillowing his head in his arms on the window sill and staring outside. Downstairs, he could hear movement and talking, most likely from their “visitors”, but his doors were warded, so he had no fear of being disrupted, at least for now.
“I don’t make the decisions,” the gargoyle wheezed. Draco stepped through the opening it had created and waited as the moving staircase lifted him to the door in front of the Headmaster’s office. He lifted a hand to knock but then paused, hearing someone talking on the other side.
“What time is your portkey?” Hermione asked lightly and Harry turned his attention back to her, ignoring how his cheeks suddenly felt hot.
had mourned the fact that two of the most famous bachelors of wizarding England were, in fact, dating each other, there hadn’t been much negativity since.
“Dobby,” Harry said quietly, surprised at the painful lump that suddenly welled in his throat. Draco nodded, looking downcast.
“Track the movement of the wand for me Mr Malfoy, there’s a lad,” she said and she began to move the wand from side-to-side, up-and-down, in figure of eights and even runes. The light burned on the back of Draco’s corneas and every time he blinked, he saw flashes of the runes behind his eyelids. Eihwaz. Dagaz. Raidho.
“Come to finish the job?” he said and Goyle sneered. His lips were split and there were bruises beginning to form on one side of his face – they looked like the underside of a boot.
Mother had been right. ‘Lively’ was one word to describe the evening meal. Draco had been sat between his parents, more for his own protection than anything else, as the Death Eaters around the table elbowed each other and laughed uproariously, knocking over bottles of wine from the cellar and spilling the food that the elves had so carefully prepared over the table and even onto the floor.
“Close your eyes. I’ll have to take you by the hand and lead you through,” she said, reaching out a hand, palm up. He hesitated, just momentarily, but if she saw him waiver, she didn’t comment. He screwed his eyes closed and reached for her hand. Her palm was cool as she closed her fingers around his hand and pulled in forward. He felt a rush of tingling, like being dunked into a pool of ice cold water, and then he was gasping on the other side.
“Where did you get it?” he eventually asked and Potter looked at him over his shoulder as he tucked the pouch back under his t-shirt. His curls were burnished in the lamplight of the tent and his eyes darkened.
“Grab one!” he shouted, pointing at the pair of heavy broomsticks in a pile of junk. Ron grabbed one and straddled it, pulling Hermione on behind him, and Harry did the same, Draco winding his arms around Harry’s waist as the burning world below them fell away.
“They do well to know their place,” she said and Weasley shot Draco a look, obviously impressed and a little terrified at Hermione’s impersonation.
“Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, he's here. I just saw him talking with some of the other candidates,” he said and Hermione studied his face before shrugging out of his grip.
“Don’t be,” he replied in a soft voice and then stepped away. He brushed a hand over his cheek again, wiping away the tears that remained and then he looked back at the place that the owl had been. “Do you think you could do it again?” he asked and Draco drew his wand, knowing that the kiss he just had would fuel a million Patronuses.
“Sit, Malfoy,” Amycus snapped at him and Draco hurried to his seat. Pansy patted his arm and gave him an encouraging smile.
“Good to see you, Draco,” he said kindly and Draco dropped Potter’s hand, took Lupin’s offered hand and shook it.
"Scorpius. He loves muggle books," he explained and Malfoy made a small sound, flipping the book over to read the blurb.
Harry looked up, ready to apologise to whoever was waiting for him to move, but the words stuck in his throat.
“All student letters are read for any subversive material. Surely you’ve realised that,” Snape replied coolly as Draco slipped the letter out from the envelope. It was his mother’s flowery handwriting, cursive and perfect, not an ink blot on the page.
He had come to Wychwood. The forest itself wasn’t as big as the others he had visited, but it was dense with oaks. He had trekked every trail, ducked behind every thatch of trees, desperate to find Potter and Granger. Surely, Potter hadn’t lied to him. The sun had begun to set early and Draco could already hear Rangers in the distance, so he had to call his search to an end, however reluctantly.
He was not there. Neither were Ron and Hermione. He was about to take a step forward to search for them when something seized him around the middle and pulled him backward, sliding fabric over his head.
“Wait, wait, let me check–” Harry said as they headed up the marble staircase, and he reached into the pouch around his neck and pulled out a tattered bit of parchment. He dragged them off the staircase into a quiet hallway and settled himself on a plinth of a statue that had obviously been called up for service. Draco lingered, bouncing on the balls of his feet, buzzing with nervous energy. Harry whispered something to the piece of parchment and writing bloomed over it. Draco frowned, recognising the map he had seen all those months ago.
“Go,” Dumbledore said, stepping back and letting go of his shoulder. “Live. Be happy. Be young and in love, and then grow old and be happy. Never doubt that you and Harry have my blessing, for all that it’s worth.” Draco felt something tug at him from behind and he knew, deep down, that this would be the last visit from Albus Dumbledore. The Headmaster gave him one last smile and then Draco allowed himself to fall backwards off the Astronomy Tower, taking a final leap of faith.
He’s right, always right, always thinking cleverly. Harry’s been a useless wreck but even now, Draco’s thinking critically. He’s already holding the other man up but he leans forward and touches their foreheads for a secondary point of contact, closing his eyes and imagining the magic within him pouring out.
Potter’s smiling as he shakes his head. “Nothing, nothing. Sorry, it’s just—that’s a muggle line to chat someone up. Funny to hear it in your mouth. Not that I think—I know you didn’t mean it that way. Not that I’m laughing at the idea of you, a man, chatting up me, a man. I
Ron shuts his mouth at that, just in time for Davy to come back over the crowd. “Hello! Er, welcome to the first Inter-House game of 2007!”
“Yeah, I sent him back a copy of the family photo and the one of him and me at the counter. I’d like to go back. Regularly.”
He rolls onto his stomach, arms out by his head under the pillow, and turns his head towards Draco even though his eyes are closed. “Knackered. Full.”
He walks faster and the sound keeps up behind him. His heart pounds his ribs. He passes his home, slips into a quiet side street and here the streetlights are out, the corners dark. He spins around the next corner, only tripping slightly on the cobblestone of an alleyway, and walks breathlessly down the shortcut, glancing back continuously.
“But I know you,” he replies. He meets his eyes with a playful cockiness. “You were going to make your purchase, get takeaway, and sit with a new book while you ate. And you probably wouldn’t get up again until almost midnight. It’s like… your swotty definition of pampering yourself.”
The statement has fueled Draco’s anxiety, so he keeps his head trained toward the path. His mother and Andromeda talk, but he has no clue whether it's fully friendly or a bitterly stilted show of clemency. If he’d been able to apologise to Ron and Hermione, though, surely seeing Andromeda will be doable.
, Harry had walked into the study with his collection of files from home and instantly recognised the absence of the antique chair.
Feeding the kneazle gets Draco thinking that he might as well eat too—a common consequence that is more often his reason for remembering to cook than he cares to admit. Unfortunately, the lack of planning that he often applies to meals has left his kitchen empty of all but a couple of dodgy boxes of takeaway. He sighs, checks on the potion—it’s turned a light lilac, meaning he still has hours before it reaches its proper dark jewel tone—and gets dressed to go seek sustenance.
“Alright!” Pansy clapped her hands together. “I have my answer.” They both turned to look at her. “It’s…
He loosens up even more once they’re seated, his back to most of the café. It’s easy with Ron so chatty, full of excitement for the end of one profession and the beginning of another, and soon enough he’s fully engrossed in the conversation enough to practically forget where he is.
Being the centre of attention was another unfortunate byproduct of the night—he’d had gatherings for the last two releases, but none of them had reached this size. This was for several unavoidable reasons; Pansy had claimed control over this launch before his
Draco clears his throat, feeling the moment has arrived. “Actually, if you’ll excuse me… I hid your gift because I didn’t wrap it.”
The veins in his neck tense, nostrils flaring, as the Aurors who had just been staring unhelpfully at the woman grip him unnecessarily hard for someone who’s already magically bound.
His friend slowly turns his head from the till his way, surely examining the sheepishness on his face, so he mumbles in quick admission, “I come here sometimes.” Then, to the barista, “I’ll do a toastie and the white coffee, Deb. And whatever he wants.”
“I don’t! I do know that hypothetically it would have to be very dark magic, so it’s not very likely that—“
Both pairs of eyes turn to him, and he hesitates slightly, feeling as though he’s interrupting old friends. But he joins them regardless, and places the items cradled in his arms on the counter.
Harry tries again, unsurprising in his persistence, and the second one he catches with the grace of a Seeker, leaning swiftly with one arm braced against the wood of the boat frame. He captures it in his palm easily, grinning in victory as he sits back down.
Harry’s already resigned himself to dinner with Ginny, but the opportunity for more distraction and maybe even some lunch is enticing. Perhaps he’ll drag it out just a little longer.
; the same deep-set eyes, aquiline nose, angular cheekbones, but he looks less skinny, more broad-shouldered. He holds himself awkwardly in his robes like they’re wearing him, and Draco wonders if he knows about the snitch-sized dark bruise on his jaw back below his right ear.
He’ll give himself until Monday. He has the weekend to think, and on Monday he’ll either show up at Draco’s, or send an owl, and after demanding clarification on just what ‘mistake’ means to him, he’ll respond accordingly, with his Plan A or Plan B or Plan C… just as soon as he figures out what a Plan A or a Plan B or a Plan C would entail.
The Ministry itself is moderately busy on the weekends, but it’s significantly quieter on the Auror floor. Cassie’s desk sits empty, as does Yolanda’s, a few Junior Aurors mill about on the on-call side of the floor, and Harry and Ron walk quickly to his office without being stopped.
He’s frustrated, confused. He doesn’t know how to properly explain that he definitely hated him and now definitely doesn’t. There’s no world in which he’d dare confess his deeper feelings—not when the concept of a friendship seems close enough to giving them mutual heart attacks.
“Not for that.” Draco’s gaze flicks to the skull, sitting tall on a shelf. “I shouldn’t have left it out like that. It was irresponsible.” His voice is quiet, as if he doesn’t trust it not to waiver if he raises it.
“Davy Wood,” Ron groans. He’d attended Ginny’s first games taken over for Hooch at the end of last season, and seems regretfully familiar. Then something clicks.
When they begin to exchange gifts and Draco’s pile continues to grow significantly past his estimations, he’s stunned. There are presents stacked at his place from Harry and Ron and Hermione, but also one from Bill and Fleur. It’s an out-of-publication book on Numerology in its original French, and they wave off his profuse apologies for the lack of reciprocation.
“As the ‘friend who can literally feel traces’, there’s nothing formidable about you. Not a drop. And your magic…” Draco searches for the right words and the courage to say them. “It’s… beautiful.”
“Pansy’s coming over to plan the launch party,” Draco mentioned, flipping through the Prophet as if there'd been no outburst at all.
Ron looks uncomfortable to break the news, face pinking. “I took the offer. I gave two weeks notice.”
Ginny owled him back later that day with a ‘hotel owl’ as she called it, promising him that she’s only staying somewhere posh enough to have such a bird on hand because the team was putting her up to take care of something with the sports division of the Ministry. She was happy he had time to meet, reportedly, but tasked him with picking the restaurant.
They struck up a new routine that week: Draco worked on the Ministry evidence quietly in the mornings, then some time after lunch Harry would spit through the fire hungry to practice tracing. Draco didn’t mind putting his work down. He enjoyed teaching. It made him think of Flitwick’s words on his last visit—how he’d retire if Draco took over—but this was only ever a fleeting thought.
, perhaps. The inevitable kind that appears when one has spent almost every night for weeks with a friend who’s conventionally attractive. As simple an obstacle as coming down with the flu, or overbuying vegetables at the supermarket.
Harry scratches his head apprehensively, feeling more vulnerable than when he was pressed for details about Jack. “But when he’s not terrible, he’s so interesting. He seems—the way he works… he’s smart and with his friends he seems completely normal. It’s like… half the time he’s amicable, and I can’t decide if it’s worth the other half.”
