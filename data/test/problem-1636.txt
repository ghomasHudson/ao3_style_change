Hermione liked Ron. As in like-liked Ron. As in love-like Ron, or like-love Ron…was there even such a thing?
Harry looked around as he walked around the room, seeing that there was also a table with a couple of chairs in the room as well as a mirror, he also noticed another door that would probably lead to the bathroom.
"Yes, you are," Harry laughed, shuffling back up in an effort to reach for Draco. "I want to see your face, you know."
"Fine my ass, mom is going to be pissed. And you shouldn't influence these poor minds with your idiocy!" Ginny said disapproving. Ron was happy with his little sister supporting his back, especially since she could almost outweigh Hermione when it came to lecturing. Which reminded him.
"Is that all you got?!" Draco yelled again but quickly moved around the tree as he heard Harry's footsteps coming nearer.
"Of course! They are the most tasteful chips I've ever eaten, they have an amazing texture and their crispiness is just right it is incredible! My father used to ban them in the house like many other products that were made using Muggle methods, but one time my mother had accidentally bought them -not having noticed the brand- and gave some to me and my father. I absolutely loved it and my father did so too, so he asked my mother from what company it was and when he found out, he was furious. He tried to take it away from me, so I, of course, told him that if he was going to take away my chipchip I was going to make him regret it. Three days later I was sitting on the sofa with the chips on my lap, my father begrudgingly taking some too." Draco smirked at Harry, happiness filled his body as he saw the look of surprise and smile on Harry's face.
How was it even possible that a few months back it took so much effort to not be in the same room as the freckled wizard and now she was having trouble getting him alone in a room with her,
Harry blinked a couple of times, then reached out to pick up his glasses and experimentally, put them on. Making everything go blurry. He put them off, again blinking for a few seconds and then repeating putting the glasses on and off, on and off, on and off.
Draco felt his heart beat faster, his ears ringing. He loved the feel of Harry's mouth, the coldness of it standing in contrast to his. Making him feel pleasantly surprised every time they did it. He could feel Harry's heart beating against his ribcage, and even though it was pretty slow, Draco knew that for Harry it was beating a mile per minute.
It reminded her of her cat when he thought Hermione wasn't looking. Sneaking over from one room to the other. She could picture how he would hunch down, swirling his' tail, getting ready to jump on her parents' brand new couch. He would leap ten feet in the air whenever she cleared her throat, scampering back to his' scratching post while giving her a menacing glare.
"Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!" Voldemort said.
Harry had already handled the messy state of his part of the room. And was now dashing down the staircase in his Quidditch robes, ready to change his frustration into something else. Because not only did he need to clean the mess
"It had this…syrupy scent, sugary even. When I first smelled it, it actually made my mouth water a little…"Harry said, looking into Draco's eyes with something the werewolf couldn't identify. "It had this…
"You look handsome today," Harry continued, caressing Draco's cheek in a fether like movement as he tucked one of Draco's loose hairs behind his ears. Draco gave a sheepish look as he did so. Blinking a few times when Harry removed his hand he looked down to the ground, hearing his blood pulse on the inside of his ear he moved his hand towards it. Realising with a jolt that when he jumped up he must have messed up his hair. The hair he had been spending so much time to acquire!
"Ahuh," He almost moaned. He would gladly do it, no questions asked. He wanted, no, needed to hear Draco's whimpers again, see his facial expression as he watched him cum.
He threw the leaves into the nearest trash bin, standing by the exit as he waited for Draco to put the rag back in its place before they both moved out of the classroom.
! Moaning out Harry's name while furiously moving his fingers in and out his hole and playing with his tip again.
Draco suppressed a shiver, he needed to stop thinking about it like that! Potter only did that because he was drunk. There was no hidden meaning behind it, absolutely not.
He now stared at his lover with interest and curiosity. What had he done with the potion after Draco offered it to him?
…Before something above them seemed to catch Draco's eye. The beautiful yellow color quickly disappeared as a look of horror crossed his eyes and Draco moved to stand up in a rush. Harry frowned as he looked up to see what made Draco move away from him, and his eyes widened as he saw what was hanging above them.
Harry was hitting him with every trick up his sleeve, tongue flicking, lapping, tracing- the sensation was strange but so wonderful at the same time. It kicked his arousal up another notch and made him let out the most intimate of sounds. Moaning out Harry's name like it was a prayer. His hot breath making Draco shiver.
Harry held the weapon up with both of his hands, it was rather heavy and it didn't feel good in his hands.
"Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you." Hagrid said throwing another dead ferret towards the hippogriff. "Right. I think you can go and pat him now."
"Ron we must go now." A lady said, probably his mother. The boy had a smile on his face when he walked over to his mother.
Harry looked out of his door to see what uncle Vernon was doing this time to stop the letters this time. Vernon was busy screwing wood to the letterbox while saying,
"If you're so worried why don't use that vail of liquid luck you've been keeping in your drawer for God knows how long?" Ron eventually said, making Harry stop in his tracks.
He advanced towards her, cheeky smile in place as his fingers hooked around her waist band. She let out a shaky breath, nodding.
"This is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well." Harry encouraged them, already seeing so many patronesses, he couldn't help but feel proud.
ashamed of. In every fantasy, Harry took control while Draco was just acting like a moaning mess. Harry would tease him, play with him, mock him, and what was even worse was that Draco absolutely loved it!
"Freshly substracted this morning, sir. I hope you enjoy," He said as he filled Harry's wine glass full of the red liquid. Draco stared at it with something close to jealousy, although he really tried to hide it.
"I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of myths and left immediately for London." McGonagall said.
Draco huffed in response. "You haven't eaten in over two days! How long do you think you can keep that up before you'll starve?" He grabbed the vampire's face, giving him a soft kiss while tenderly brushing away the wild raven locks. "Can you at least try it?" He begged.
"Are you alright?" She asked, worriedly. He nodded, his stomach flipping upside down as he saw, not one, but two hands locked on his arm. Hermione's gaze boring into his skull as she assessed him. 'Always the one fretting,' he thought with a fond smile. He could imagine being able to see that warm sight for the rest of his life.
"This way you won't be able to overthrow me while I push you away," Draco said, his tone filled with a smugness that made Harry chuckle, even though the idea itself still left Harry with a pit in his stomach.
Before he stopped. The door closing behind him with a loud bang, but it didn't even make him flinch.
"Now, where were we?" Harry said. "We're going to divide you into groups, you're going to play your best game if you want a spot on the team. Is that clear?" Harry watched as all the participants nodded at him, except for Ron, who was staring at the tribune confused and angry.
"…You want that?" Draco asked carefully, cautiously. Suddenly pouring an ice-cold bucket of over Harry's head. Because this was really happening. He wasn't just making out, playing a fantasy nor having this awesome dream. This was reality. He was actually going to have sex with Draco.
And when he thought about it…he was. He used bullying, insulting Harry as an excuse for wanting to keep his attention. Because he felt so lonely, but…Harry was right. Draco wasn't that lonely, he had a family that loved him, more than enough money, power, a high title…
Ron nodded, smiling enthusiastically even though he seemed as light headed as Elliot. And gave her two thumbs up as he backed away from her. Hermione responding the same, laughing slightly before he turned around to clasp Elliot on the back. The two running through the rest of the corridor on a search for the party accessories while Hermione stood there giggling at the two fumbling to get to their destination until she realised…
"I think it is something we shouldn't concern ourselves with, at least for now. I bet he is in enough turmoil about that fact as it is. Our worries would only bring a bigger pressure on it. Besides, who knows? Maybe your hunch is right."
about Harry fascinated him. He still felt surprise when those lips decided to taste his, loving the way how they feel. How they stretched when smiling or how they somehow seemed to glow when tainted with blood…
"Can you walk?" Ron heard her say softly, her fingers tracing circles onto his arm. Probably unconsciously.
Ron and Harry were walking down the corridor to go to their dorm, but they stopped when they wanted to turn around the corner and saw McGonagall and some other teachers.
"Don't get cocky, Potter," Draco rose his eyebrow, giving a cheeky grin, "As if you'd be able to overpower me."
Sorry for the hold up you guys but you can see why it took me so long to write this one. I'm pretty proud.
" Harry sighed, finding himself stupid for even thinking Ron would be as hateful as uncle Vernon. Hell, the wizarding world was known for their toleration and acceptance against creatures like him, and Ron never in his life made a comment that could indicate he wasn't as accepting as the world around him. Still, he had worried.
When they let go to take a breath he didn't know why he had never done this sooner. Gone would have been those afternoons bickering, sharing cold glances or trying to cut each others throats. He found that this was a more favourable option. Considering Hermione's fluttering lashes and drunken look, she would agree.
He was getting closer, losing control of his body as he bucked up into Harry's hand. Moaning out cries of pleasure as he did so. Yelling for more, that he was so close, that he was almost there. Until one second before his outburst Harry quickly moved his mouth to Draco's cock, drinking all he had to offer.
He felt himself drifting off, his pillow hugged tight underneath him while his blanket lay loosely on his back. He could hear the birds singing outside, their chirps dancing around in some sort of lullaby that made Harry feel instantly safe and calm. He exhaled in and out, his thoughts leaving him as he traveled back into his slumber.
Harry groaned in frustration knowing that none of them would do. It was hard to think of a gift for someone who could get whatever they wanted.
Harry laughed a little at Draco's supposed to be cockiness. After having spent a ridiculous amount of time with Draco, Harry had noticed that what he once thought as Draco trying to patronize him it was just Draco's manner of speaking. He wasn't really trying to sound like a complete bastard. He had noticed it every time Draco said something to Harry that sounded particularly hurtful, he would turn away from him and play with his fingers in what Harry thought was supposed to be regret and shame.
"No problem, you should thank Hermione though," Ron said, a look of guilt filling his features. "I'm sorry, I hadn't even noticed that you hadn't got anything to eat, I just thought you were concerned like me."
He managed to find some sort of route in his head and looked around himself again. There weren't many muggles outside and none were paying attention to him. Harry huffed in another breath.
"HA!-Wait what?" Before he walked up the stairs, determined to take care of a particularly stiff problem.
Only a few more days before the next school year began, and Draco was actually quite relieved, wanting to get out of his room and man up. So when his mother asked him for his help with some cabinet he accepted and went with her to Diagon Alley.
Draco looked beside him, wanting to tell Harry this but as he moved his gaze to Harry's he saw the vampire's attention wasn't on him.
"Surprise me," He eventually answered, Shay, giving him a pleased smile in return. She turned to Draco who -much to Harry's amusement- was now looking up at the ceiling.
"Urgh, why does he keep avoiding meeeee?!" Harry complained to no one. Walking through the corridors trying track Malfoy down. It had been days, DAYS!
"Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking." Hermione said.
It's curious that you should be destined for this dagger when the wand with the other feather gave you that scar." The man told Harry, pointing at the scar on his forehead.
Okay, he wasn't exactly the best planner around here, that was mostly Harry and Hermione's thing. So what would they do if they were here? Well, Hermione was here but that didn't exactly count since he was sure she couldn't hear him past the oak door.
"Are you? Are you really? Because if you were really that sorry, why still going out with that dipshit?!" Ron started to yell.
of this- He shook his head, looking down at the table before he pushed his chair backward. Loudly scraping the wooden floor of the room. He stood up, avoiding the pleading look Harry was giving him as he moved towards the exit.
She switched her gaze up, locking her eyes with his as she felt the pressure of his hand squeezing her shoulder. And in an effort to process what just had happened, together with the knowledge that she needed to answer honestly only made it so Hermione started cackling like a mad man. Smiling at Ron -who looked at her with unease- she pressed her finger against his chest and said, "One moment," and stormed off to find Draco.
He sighed once more warbling his lips while doing it, looking ahead of him and seeing Ron and Hermione walking together. He was happy their friendship hadn't grumbled.
He was getting crazy. He was panting uncontrollably now, he was so confused. He could feel his control slipping. But why was Malfoy listening to him? Why did he care? Why, why, why, WHY?!
Draco let out a shaky gasp. Harry growing more insistent, moving his hand faster and letting his other hand prob him deeper. Draco was getting close, his breathing turning erratic. His cock starting to leak a bit of precum.
"What are you talking about?" Cedric asked, but before Harry could say more a door opened. The next thing Harry knew, his scar burned like never before. He shouted in pain almost falling to the ground. He knew that Wormtail was there and if the pain was any indication it meant Voldemort was the disgusting little creature that he was holding.
Okay, he did. He'd been counting unconsciously in his head. When it had been fifteen minutes Draco decided he should just leave, Potter had probably left before Draco was even there.
"Almost there, almost there!" Harry said in a high pitch as Draco kept up the suction inside his mouth.
After they had called a truce and became friends Harry hadn't seen him much after that. But that didn't matter really since they were going to see each other at potions anyway. Unless he was sick.
"Got any preferences? Or do you just like all of it in general," Draco asked, prodding a bit deeper. "You know, positive, negative. A or B?"
"Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if you were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket watch, maybe one of you would be on time." She said.
He kept asking himself, how. How had he fallen in love with Draco? When had he come to think of him as more than friends?
…And it felt kinda embarrassing knowing that when he actually tried to uncover Draco being a bad guy and all, now he knew he was just acting like a mother hen.
But then again, Potter did confess he had been avoiding Draco because he couldn't stop staring at his throat.
It takes a moment for him to realise what she was saying and when he does, his cock starts twitching.
"HARRY POTTER!" Draco yelled, noticing that all eyes were turned on him but not giving a shit about it, only looking at Potter. He needed to make clear to bloodsucking daredevil that he needed to stop being such an idiot.
"Hm," He said, trying to hide his disappointment as he sat down on the carpet, "I suppose it'd be an added bonus."
That's why he was surprised to see a brown furred, female wolf sneaking around in his territory. When Draco growled at the intruder the other wolfs' eyes shot immediately up and she ducked her head right away and started whining. And even though Draco knew those eyes to be Grangers' it didn't mean she was safe.
Fred and George were standing behind him while Harry was glaring daggers at Umbridge's retreating figure.
That's how they ended up here, with Harry calmly exploring the forest as Draco walked behind him bored out of his mind. It was really too tempting to watch those in thick clothing covered back muscles move around with each step Harry took, so he decided to make a snowball and throw it at Harry's face to distract himself, which in all honesty, it did.
"We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!" Harry said after running in McGonagall's classroom.
Harry looked at those anger filled eyes, quickly looking away from at that accusatory look, knowing he deserved it.
'Oh hell no.' Draco thought to himself while walking backward like the rest of the class…well everyone except Potter.
Or at least, completely absurd! Who in their right mind would scream at someone they needed lumberjack shoes to cook gumbo in?!
now I think about it! She would never want to be with an idiotic, weak, chess player?! And she's a werewolf, Harry! Those are the highest ranked creatures in the world!" Ron rambled in utter panic that Harry would most likely laugh about if it was another situation. Then Ron shot a pointed look at Harry and began again. "Well, I mean right under you of course. And I'm just a plain, boring wizard! Even she can use magic better than me! She has claws and an amazing mind while I only have a simple wooden stick." He said before crashing back on the bed, eyes towards the ceiling while making pathetic sounds.
They rushed out of the room, huffing and puffing as they made their way through the corridor. Hermione could still hear Ron's worried voice in the distance. She was grateful that most of the teachers had figured out what was wrong and had interfered immediately. Letting all of them escape while trying to keep the rest of the students in control and stop them from following.
When he put them on he sighed and walked over to the fridge. He opened it, he hadn't noticed it yesterday when he was in his clouded mind, but the only things that were in it were a couple of bottles of water and some energy bars, which Draco looked at with disgust. But took one anyway, not expecting anyone knocking on his door yelling: "Room service!" anytime soon.
He was startled when Ron bumped him with his elbow saying; "Harry, you alright mate?" This caught Hermione's attention, whose head immediately turned to them.
Alright, let's get down to business. I've got some bad news for you guys, well not really bad but some might feel bummed out about it. As you may have realized my updates haven't been that regular anymore, as in I don't finish before my deadline of one week. This is because I've been writing much more words per chapter, before my min. was 2k but now that had changed to at least 3k, also I try to get into more detail like I tried with this chapter. This means I'm going to move my deadline from once a week to once every two weeks. Now I actually wanted to go to writing chapters and uploading them once a month, but I hadn't predicted that this story was going to take more than a year (happy new year btw) and I want you guys to have some hindsight into when my updates appear and not having to wait too long for them. I still have the warning that the updates could be late thanks to my schedule, but I'm also adding that it will probably take longer when I have big plans for the chapter: as in long chapters, chapters I need much info on or smutty ones. So that those won't be limited. When I get on vacations and stuff I'll warn you in the A/N.
"Are you freaking kidding me? I hoped we passed this bullshit already!" Ron yelled out. His arms outstretched in the air before looking at Harry, frustrated. "You're not actually considering buying that self-righteous arse a gift, are you?!"
"Ron?!" Harry yelled, a blush covering his face as he looked up to his friend –who was busy trying to claw said eyes out.
She shook her head, smiling despite herself. Then, slowly, he reached over and intertwined her hand with his. It was an intimate gesture, one she needed to realise was going to happen more often from now on. That thought send a strange twist in her stomach, a shiver down her spine, excitement running through her veins.
Harry halted taking a sip of champagne, frowning as he thought about it before shrugging and saying, "I guess, I was able to eat Treacle tart without wanting to throw up, it smelled kinda good too…"
Harry looked over at Hagrid who was eating a bowl of soup. Harry wasn't really hungry and even when he was he would probably not be able to eat it.
Ron looked at her for a moment before laughing erratically. Not stopping even when he fell on his side, holding his stomach as he wiped tears away.
"Better out than in. Who was he trying to curse anyway?" Hagrid asked after giving Ron a bucket to throw up in.
Of course, he'd be disappointed. But knowing the raven-haired boy, he'd probably take it like a man and congratulate Draco with the price.
The only thing Draco felt, as his head was leaning on Harry's shoulder, as the fire roared loudly and he was wrapped in a big white blanket, was complete contentment. He was relaxed after getting all of that of his shoulders. Happy that Harry wasn't pushing him away and as he looked up to meet those forest green eyes watch him closely he couldn't help but smile.
? He couldn't even grasp how lonely that must have felt, no not lonely, horrible. He had no love, no money, no power, a low ranking title…
Am tired so don't get much to say except that next update will be a bit late and that I ehm... didn't expect this chapter to be this long, so good news on that!
Draco looked absolutely mortified as he pulled the dildo out of the drawer. He gave it a questionable look that he also turned towards his boyfriend. "It's not-"
"Yeah, but it was kind of strange. I mean, I was in our regular compartment waiting for them. In the end, Harry never came, but when Hermione did, she just stared at me for a couple of seconds before she squeaked and run off!" Weasley said and then went on with another subject, making Draco return to his food and watch the remaining first years getting sorted.
"You sure?" Harry asked and Hermione nodded. So Harry picked Ron up with all his protests and placed him on top of Hermione's back. Ron gripped the fur between his fingers and sighed in content.
Alright, enough with the rant. I want to prepare you guys because now that my holidays have finished..I'm gonna get busy again...(bring in the sarcastic yay) which means: waiting. I'm sorry. But! The good news/bad news -because it depends- is that the story is almost finished! In that it will take...hmm, I would say around six/seven chapters before the end. So I will try to finish it by the end of the year!
She had given him a shirt, but not just any shirt. It was the redshirt Harry had worn when he'd stormed in the Great Hall. The one that was obviously tight fitting but also looked very sexy on him. He'd seen some glimpses of it the past few weeks but hadn't seen him wearing it often, which was a shame by itself.
Draco moaned, looking up at the sky as Harry loosened his belt, his lips parted. He fought back as his eyelids threatened to drop, not wanting to miss a second of what was about to happen next.
"What? Did you say that I was wrong? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?" Draco asked thinking this strange behavior could no way be from just a stomachache.
They laughed about it now, a fan falling over his own two feet while storming over to Harry coming at the forefront of their mind every time they talked about it.
and kiss Harry if it would mean he was going to be pushed away. He wasn't really good in the 'show my emotions department' either, unlike Harry who showed his emotions clear as day.
He moved his gaze until it spotted a waiting figure standing awfully out of place as she leaned against the wall. Her bushy brown hair tied up in a messy bun while her face had the faintest hint of make-up that was only noticeable thanks to the red lips and black eyeliner sitting atop of her eyelids. Draco tapped Harry on the shoulder telling him that he had found her before they pushed through the mass of the party-goers.
The moment he walked into the secret base his eyes fell on the boy standing in the middle of the room, his blonde hair glistening in the small amount of moonlight that seeped into the room as he turned to look at Harry with an almost hopeful expression. Grey eyes shining brightly as a small smile of relief slowly formed onto his face, probably being afraid it had been someone else before noticing it was Harry who had walked into the room.
She stood there for a moment knowing that this was probably getting out of hand. "A couple of weeks after the beginning of the school year." She closed her eyes as his face twisted, a loud huff followed by a silent repeat of
Harry tried to back away while Wormtail took out his knife and cut at Harry's arm. Harry cried out in pain while Wormtail kept smiling, he pulled out the knife and let drops of blood fall onto the knife. Turning his back to Harry and made the drops fall into the cauldron.
"Urg, I give up. I'm screwed," Harry said, body flopping to the ground as he lay down with arms spread wide in defeat.
Draco turned back towards his table. They had been here for over two hours, just another fifteen minutes before he needed to wake Harry. They spend most of their afternoons in here, the room of requirement, to catch up or to simply be with each other. After Harry's dispute with Weasley, Draco had been glad when he saw both of them walking up to him, laughing.
They lay there for a bit, Harry mulling the words over in his head. "I'm nervous about that too, I suppose." He admitted, letting his head fall back on his pillow. His eyes on the ceiling. "Hermione ones told me that, vampires are unable to age until they've found their mates. It has been something I don't like to think about."
They passed a few classrooms, most of them empty while others were filled with the displeased noise of detention. He wanted to make a joke about it, about how they had often found themselves together with the same fate and how they would glare at each other for hours on end until Filch would come in and tell them to, for once in their lives:
Draco froze in place as Potter kept nuzzling him and his fur. He was sure that he was blushing furiously underneath his fur, but was thanking every supernatural being that no one could see it.
"Really, you don't have to worry about either of us, you're forgetting that Hermione will never give me a moment of peace as long as the finals are there. I still remember her reprimanding me for not coming with her to the library to study for the O.S.L.s,
Harry thought back at what happened on the pitch while walking towards the girl's bathroom and stopped at one thought.
"Alright, what did you do?" He asked, looking up at the ceiling as he heaved a sigh. When she didn't answer, Draco watched as she made an effort not to look at him, nervously playing with her fingers.
"WHA!" Ron screamed as they both fell back onto the floor with a crash. Neville stood up, eyes wide as he worriedly looked over the tabletop. Seeing his two friends shouting and trashing around underneath the table. Ron struggling to get out of Hermione's tight grip while she was holding onto him firmly. "Why are you always this violent?!" He yelped.
"I-I think, I'm going to look for Ron," Hermione eventually said, taking a step back before hurriedly making her way around the room.
She wanted to laugh at his dramatic tone, he did have a nick for exaggerating things after all but when she saw the piece of fabric he was holding, she froze. Every ounce of her ready to go into flight mode but she knew that wasn't an option. Ron was waiting for her response, turning the cloth over in his hand as he inspected it. His finger poking in one of the openings.
When Potter started petting, Draco almost melted at the touch of the gentle hand on his head, he only managed a huff as protest. And looked into Potters' beautiful eyes again finding that they were becoming more and more interesting by the minute.
Harry was, not to his expectations, enjoying himself at Slughorns' party. Even when Slughorn demanded a picture taken with him, which he'd normally hate. It was probably because he had such a great date. He could imagine how clingy Romilda would be, Luna, however, was exploring the whole room and it looked like she was having fun.
"I think we need to position Andrea somewhere else, perhaps the rock wall? It would give her enough shelter from the wind with it being in between two bleachers and would be a great hideout because of the boulders in front of it so she can sneak up on the opponent and steal the Quaffle from them, you know she always seems to be a little disorientated when strong winds are up, she doesn't have the right thickness in wings for that. And if we position Demelza there she can also move more freely with her jumps, though she would have to look out for the steal junkyard, no need for her to step in that. What do you think?" Harry asked, craning his neck a bit to the left while taking a sip from his goblet, looking Ron in the eyes.
"Sir, I wasn't interested in her! But it's alright, I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse." Harry shrugged.
"Come on Neville, I'll give you that herb book you liked so much," Hermione wiggled her eyebrows, ignoring the look of indignation from Ron.
"But when she's like, talking to someone else, especially guy's, that harmless twist in my gut turns lethal. And I just get so angry. So when I saw her with Krum-
"So, I've found out that me being able to use Ron's magical powers is because we're mates! It's a rare trade that's called
But that didn't stop her. She was going to apologize and she was going to do it now. So Hermione walked determined towards the boy who was eating a baked potato at the Gryffindor table.
Harry found his control slowly slipping away, on one side not wanting to yell at is hurt friend but on the other side wanting to strangle him for the insensitive comment.
Harry's smirk only grew but Draco noticed the slightly nervous stance Harry's body created. "Please call me Harry. Look, Listen, I know we have started off on the wrong foot and I know you hate me and all but-
They were now in McGonagall's classroom. Draco was standing a foot away from the golden trio smirking, while McGonagall was punishing them by taking 50 points each from their house.
"Just…hang on a moment," Harry said and leaned in to give Draco a soft kiss, "You really do look handsome tonight,"
Everyone, even Hermione herself were looking at the scene with open mouths. Ron took back his hand and the feather fell back on the table.
He would rarely get this panicked about something, this scared and truly show it to his friends. He normally kept his insecurities away, knowing he shouldn't think like that about himself.
"'M sowry, couldn't wresist," He mumbled, swiping his tongue over her left bud as his hand squeezed the other bosom. It made her shudder. The feeling of another hand touching her, skin to skin, was new but also exciting. Her body was already reacting to Ron's efforts, her lower parts steadily growing more wet as he progressed to flick and suck. It was a tingling, almost electrifying sensation. Making her aware of every part the wizard was touching.
One was a golden necklace, with a silver wolf dangling at the end of it surrounded by a smoky black and blue, the wolf moving from a standing position to that of a sitting as it howled making the overall picture very elegant.
"Sure," Harry said a bit unsure. People started making room for both of them, even the magical creatures stopped what they were doing because they were also curious.
Madame Hooch had given them to him at the same time as his special running shoes. It had been obvious that he needed new ones, but Harry hadn't actually thought much about them. After practice, he'd just threw them on his bed, not really caring until now how they looked.
He picked up Draco's legs -toes gripping at the bedsheets with an iron grip- and wrapped them around his waist. His boyfriend watched him as he did so, reinforcing him as he interlocked his ankles. This way his aim was easier accomplished, Draco's mewling confirming that thought. Not only that though, the simple skin-on-skin contact was soothing, stabilizing. It made them connect better, brought a certain aura around them that made the act whole. Without it, Harry wasn't sure if he'd love it as much as he did.
'…since when had it gotten so quiet in here?' Hermione asked herself, shoving her thoughts aside in order to focus back on the present. Looking over at Ron she noticed him looking at the ground, biting his lip and wriggling with his fingers.

"When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger." The lady said.
Harry looked up to see an enthusiastic Hermione sitting in front of him, with two gigantic books next to her.
'Dammit he's adorable, I want to kiss him so bad,' Harry thought as he bit his lip, trying to hold himself back all the while scolding himself that Draco was just red of anger. Not from anything else.
"And some actions of this person make me so sad I want to cry myself to sleep- 'Like when he rejected my friendship and treated me like a dick and still does.' -But other actions make me so happy that I'm feeling really weird on the inside and that I smile without any real reason. 'Because, Dobby's freedom is really not such a good reason, at least not good enough.' I look into their eyes and I swear I could just drown in them, I'm also anxious and sometimes jealous and-and it's driving me nuts!"
"Teeth? What's wrong with your teeth?" Harry asked, making Draco finally aware of the lisp that was accompanying the words. It was amusing, if Draco wasn't completely focused on Harry's face right now, or to be more accurate; his mouth. He pointed with his fingers towards own teeth hoping Harry would understand the gesture.
"Come on now. Now...you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well," Harry looked at Hagrid with a shocked expression. "We'll get to that later. Just make your bow."
Some teachers frowned at him, and Draco was a bit put off too. Yes, he hadn't actually seen the guys face yet, but even if Draco's mind was clouded with Potter he was sure that he'd have noticed if a sculpted body like that was in this school!
Harry, the stubborn vampire that he was, kept his lips there while licking the pale soft skin and started moving the hand that cupped Draco's cheek sliding it across the rest of his body and stopped at Draco's arse. Squeezing it.
"Please God no, that tastes worse than a vial of liquid luck, I can tell you that," Harry laughed for a moment before he realized what he'd said. His smile faltering.
"I think it's time you went to bed," Vernon ordered Harry, but Marge interfered. "Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up." She said snapping her fingers like Harry was her butler.
"Can you believe that?" Harry chuckled, humored. Before he took a look at Draco's…suspisious expression.
Harry rolled on his shoulder seeing a black dot coming closer to him. Harry instantly spins away before the bludger could smash his other bones into crumbles.
When he turned another hedge he saw Krum but he didn't seem like his normal self so Harry hid inside the hedge. When Krum ran the other way Harry got even more worried than he already was because the scream came from where Krum just came out. When he turned another hedge he saw Fleur being swallowed into the undergrowth.
It was New Year's Eve, Harry and Draco were having small talk to pass the time, getting to know each other as they waited for the final countdown. They were sitting opposite of each other on a big, black couch that was buried under a huge amount of fluffy pillows, it stood in front of a 10 feet tall window that showed the Great Lake at its fullest and between them stood a see-through coffee table. There were huge pillars standing around the room along with a couple of chairs, couches, a mini fridge along with a full sized kitchen and various decorations. There were candles laying across the whole room and on top of the coffee table, a big old-fashioned fireplace standing in the corner as it roared loudly.
To begin this long ass A.N, I want to apologize if you think Hermione has been acting like a bitch. I didn't want to make her one, I still have trouble with writing her p.o.v and Harry's, but I hope you still enjoy the story.
'I know I'm not supposed to but I would just love to push him off the wall.' Harry thought while starting to climb.
"Draco, are you coming I need to take care of some things in Knockturn Alley, and since it's close to Diagon Alley we could buy your school stuff on the way," Lucius said to his son.
"That doesn't change the fact I mistranslated ehwaz and eihwaz, and I won't let it happen again," Hermione said determent, finally sitting down in front of them.
She knew she couldn't be always right, stupid past experiences had taught her that but she really wished she had been right about this.
Ever since his father was sent to Azkaban his mother had been not like herself, hollower. He could see she was depressed and lonely, even when she tried to mask it with a smile. The times Draco saw an honest smile on her face were limited, but he'd seen one for a whole week after she went to Paris. Talking about it non-stop and making Draco feel guilty for having whined about spending his Christmas at Hogwarts when his mother was finally having a great time.
'He's gorgeous! And he smells so good!' Harry thought to himself. 'Wait, what? Why would I think a boy is gorgeous?'
Even when it had been really hard the last couple of days to push his feelings aside, he had been really enjoying them and he found content as he smiled, looking over at Draco sitting next to him, their shoulders touching as they both looked into the fire. Draco's scent invading his nostrils but he was too tired to care.
at the same time. He imagined it like this. Harry's cock buried deep inside him, moving hard and fast inside him. Would Harry be this big? Would he be smaller? Bigger?
Hermione groaned out a noise of frustration, her forehead sweaty and flushed and her fingers coated in her own juices deep inside her as she wasn't able to get off. Mentally berating herself for not having picked up the damn dildo.
"So tell me, why are you here?" Draco asked timidly. Harry picked up one of the chairs and put it down in front of Draco. He hesitated a moment before picking up the table as well and putting it between them. He watched as Draco frowned for a bit before answering.
"Draco, Draco wait-" Harry tried to stop him, standing up alongside him and trying to take a hold of him before he walked passed him. He attempted to run after him before the hostess stopped in front of him. He looked over her head to see the werewolf walking out of the door and cursed to himself.
A few minutes later he stood before his bed, picking up the green duvet as he made himself a small nest. He was too tired to reign back his wolf, letting it do whatever it wanted as it stacked pillow over pillow, creating a small den of makeshift sheets and cushions.
Sorry for the short delay, forgot to do some assignments that were long as fuck aka three days I could have spent writing this. It could have been a little longer but that will just be in the next chapter, which I already had planned is going to take some time to write. So warning for the wait.
"I suppose I shouldn't be the one here giving you advice, with me never having had a real relationship and all, but Harry I really don't think this is the answer," Hermione said after a moment, looking at Harry and Ron a little unsure. Harry looked at her with confusion. Of course, this was the answer!
"But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?" Harry questioned feeling like he was so close to the truth.
Harry looked at his golden ticket and started to panic. "Platform 9¾? But Hagrid there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing…is there?" Harry looked around him only to see Hagrid had vanished.
Harry was watching in horror as Wormtail picked up a knife saying; "Flesh of the servant willingly sacrificed." And slashed of his right hand into the cauldron.
"What's wrong?" Harry asked again after a minute or so, seeing his uncle, aunt, and cousin looking at him up and down.
'Finally, detention is over! Seriously I didn't think there could be an even worse detention than cleaning all the dirty dishes of the great hall after! But seriously hadn't they got magic do to stuff like that?' Harry thought to himself when he was walking through the empty corridor. When he heard the voice again, the one he heard when he was having detention.
"I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask." Lucius said trying to sound conventual. But when Harry listened to his heartbeat… he frowned. Why was Lucius lying?
"I'm sorry, sir. But I'm afraid that we are full," The hostess said in an uninterested tone, not looking up from the open book in front of her, scrabbling down a few notes. "Did you make a reservation?" She asked after a moment, making Harry's back hair stand on end.
"Jesus Christ Dudley, you smell horrible! What the fuck is that?!" He asked, his hand immediately trying to cover his mouth and nose from the horrible scent.
"You there! D-5!" Ron said and a black pawn moved forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raised its swords and smashed the black one.
She let out a shaky sigh, gawking at the man in front of her. He was fit, no one could deny that. Spending hours on Quidditch practise made him put on a significant amount of bulk. But she knew that beforehand. No, she was curious about another part of him. And when her eyes landed on his stiff member she swallowed.
Draco huffed out an annoyed breath that quickly transformed into a keening sound as he felt Harry fondling his balls through his pants. Pulling at them, not enough pain to hurt but just enough to make Draco hang his head in shame by all the sounds that resulted in coming out of his mouth. It wasn't as pleasurable as touching the more needier and more importantly:
“Then take your blonde colored hair, gray eyed, skinny ass over there again, and work this out. Knock his door down if you have to.”
“Anyway, the date is going well. I’m 25 today, I am at a restaurant with the man of my dreams and talking to one of my best friends. Life is awesome!”
"Um, pretty much, but I digress. Anyway, I didn't feel like wearing anything fancy at all, so I just wore some jeans and a polo shirt. When I got to his house he said that he liked the whole
, and a lot of other shit, but to tell you the truth, it really doesn't matter anymore. What matters to me at the moment, is
“See, I think that when you’ve found someone, you can spend the rest of your life with them, you know what I mean?” Harry asks.
Harry turns back to Tori, who's currently sticking her bottom lip out for a pout before she starts to cry.
"No, just lonely without Harry." He replies wiping his eyes before his tears fall. "Is it still wrong that I'm waiting for him to call me because his relationship has failed with Inferno?"
"Come on, Malfoy. Everyone needs someone, even you." Harry says while grabbing a hold of Draco's hands. "What are you afraid of?" Harry says putting his head on Draco's shoulder, wishing he could do nothing more, than to help his friend find someone.
"You're so small, Tori." Harry says as he peppers kisses on Tori's cheeks causing her to grin a little.
Harry knew that Draco was hurting, but at this point, all he could do was hope that time would heal all the wounds very soon as his own heart was breaking.
"For starters, he cheated on me, and mind you, I stopped caring because I was going to break up with him. When I confronted him about everything, he acted like I was stupid and it made me furious. I got all my clothes, Tori's things and left. I was in the park for a few hours when I decided to go back home and apologize-"
"Seriously, how are you straight, but like going to GoGo bars? Just give a reason why?" Draco asks Neville as they enter inside the bar.
"Sure." Draco says happily, knowing Damon well that he was going to drag his friend out to a gay bar.
Draco had liked the fact that he got time for himself when Harry would play or feed Tori when he would come home from work. It was exactly like a husband coming home to his family, and Draco would have dinner already made. During those dinners, Harry would talk about his day at work, and after dinner, he would play with Tori and ask how their day went. Now, Draco had liked Harry and thought that he was the most amazing guy in the entire world; however, he was scared of dating. Harry might be average height, but he was fit, funny, smart, had a kind heart and had an amazing smile to match. Draco just didn’t know what to do because he didn’t want Harry to turn out like Goyle. He didn’t want to be in the position where he was in love with one person and the other didn’t reciprocate.
“Well, she didn’t follow the rules to her restraining order, so the police shot her arm after she shot at them.” Ron says.
"Because I was supposed to be out of there at 4, but my friend really needed the help." Harry said. "Besides, had I not stayed, I wouldn't have met you or this little cutie pie."
Once they were outside, Draco unbuttoned his shirt. Neville looked at Draco, and noticed that he looks as if he's on the verge of tears.
"Shhh." He tells her, taking off her underwear. After all her clothes are off, he simply stares at her body.
Draco knew that Gregory Goyle wasn't going to be a good father the moment they found out that Draco was pregnant. He simply checked out and virtually ignored Draco for majority of the pregnancy. Since then, Draco vowed  to be everything that Victoria would need.
"Ron, I really think that I should have called him." A dejected Draco told him as they were out in Nevada.
"Good lord, you're fucking beautiful. I can no longer pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me." He tells her.
"I love this boy but don’t worry about me because he's like a brother. He's a great guy. He would never play with your feelings like that. But if he does, I will hunt him down."
“Damn, baby! Shit!” Draco says, unaware that Harry is undoing his jeans, pushing them down to the ground. Before Draco can catch his breath, Harry’s on his knees. All of a sudden, Harry's mouth is being filled with Draco’s dick. He starts fucking Harry’s face. “Take off your shirt.” He demands, while he takes off shirt while he continues to face fuck Harry. Harry slowly takes his shirt off , and places his right hand on Draco’s dick, stroking it, leading his hand and his mouth in a synchronized rhythm.
"Alright." Draco said. "Her bottles are in the fridge, and if she gets hungry, just warm one up, but not too hot. Her diapers are in the bag by her crib, and if she cries, put her in the swing or play with her."
After a while, Draco begs Harry to fuck him even harder. As Harry picks up the pace, Draco manages to slightly turn around and give Harry a filthy kiss. Harry manages to surprise himself as he flips Draco onto his back.
See, it was always for you to attract people because of your last name, but not because they personally knew you. For me, it was a lot easier to attract people with my confidence because it was easier to get what I want and just forget about all my past experiences that hurt. Confidence is something I can exude because it's a shield. It's the best shield that worked in my favor because being emotionally attached to someone after last time scarred me in ways that I never thought was possible. You never played coy or played games with anyone’s heart, which is extremely hard to come by. It was….....anyway confidence was a must I my life, but now I can only be confident with you because you're my equal and I never have to try so hard to be liked or put on a high pedestal by you, and it makes me super happy.
If Harry were to describe his best friend, he would says that Hermione is very clever, exceptionally talented, levelheaded, book-smart, and very logical. He could also say that she is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can be counted on. Harry values that Hermione never strays off the path and that she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done. For all the positive things that he can say about her, the only flaw that he finds interesting is the fact that she is afraid of failure, which was evident when she lost a case in court when her client lied on the stand causing her to lose. She was pissed for three and a half weeks because that was the first and last case that she ever lost in her career.
"Oh please, Draco! What about you?" Ron asks Draco. "He's a successful business man. He can do a hell of a lot better than you. I mean you are hardly ever to be found. All your free time is spent one of three ways: with a new suitor, working, or with Harry. I'm surprised that we always talk at work and have lunch together."
"The food is done." Harry said as walked into the living room with two plates of pasta and placed them on the coffee table about an hour later.
Harry wants to chuckle at it, but thinks in doing so would make him choke around Draco's length, and he's enjoying himself too much to let that happen. Instead, he laughs mentally at Draco's insistence, even in his sleep.
The same way that Draco bobbed his head up and down in a sensual manner, Harry did to Draco who thought that Harry was a lot better at doing.
"I don't know." Ignoring the last part of Sirius’ comment. "I just hope that nothing happened to him after our double date last night. Maybe I'll ask Ron to help me go look in and around-"
“Shh.” The blonde man said, placing a finger on Harry’s lips before he resumed kissing his friend passionately. He continues for about another ten minutes before he takes off the rest of Harry’s clothes and his own clothes. Once every article of clothing is off, he kisses up and down Harry’s body. When he covers Harry’s hard length with his mouth, Harry starts going crazy.
The place is loud, colorful and nearly filled to capacity. The song that is currently blasting through the place is Katy Perry's
Even Draco had to admit that Ron was 100% correct on this one. Just like when he told Harry to confess what happened with Blaise and his pseudonyms. He couldn’t go through the rest of his life thinking that he had betrayed Harry like that because it hurt too much. He had to talk with Harry, whether he liked it or not.
"Well, I have to admit it, I'm surprised that you actually had the balls to go out and finally screw somebody that isn’t Malfoy. But we are still missing something. Why did you come in so late?" Ron inquired.
As Draco is on top of the birthday boy, Harry cups Draco’s face and kisses him gently after taking of the blonde’s button up shirt.
"I think that she'll still look like me, but more like a toddler than a baby. Then she'll look more like a kid than a toddler, so on and so forth."
“It’s all for you.” Draco says in a light tone before he places his mouth on Harry’s length once more.
When I’m with you, the world stops and I just let myself stop, be me and just think about you. It is so hard picturing a life without you, and when I thought that I was going to lose you…. I would have lost an important part of me. It's still so hard to believe that I almost lost you. You, the most important person of my life. When times get rough, no one would ever be able to take your place at all, and that scares me. All I know is that I’m happy that you will always be there for me, just as I’ll always be there for you. No matter what happens in life, I’m happy to have met such an amazing man like you. From childhood to now, it’s been an amazing ride that I’ve been on and I am happy to be on that ride with you. Thank you for being my every thing. You are the best and I love you, always and forever. I can’t wait to marry you, Harry Potter.
"Just remember, no matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, just remember that I love you." Draco says. "Food, here we come!"
"Yeah, I kissed him." Harry said. "God, he's such a good kisser, you guys. His kisses are very addictive and his touch is very warm. He's even better in bed. Inferno knew how to take care of me in ways that nobody but one person has ever known how to, and he made me feel very loved. It’s like I almost found the best thing that I never knew I needed." Harry gushed.
around Harry's cock. It's unrelenting and with every press against Draco's prostate Harry is seeing stars. He pulls off from sucking on one of Draco's nipples and arches his back as he thrusts back in once more and he comes, hard.
"We're gonna watch the greatest Disney movie on Earth, princess!" He said as he sat Tori up on his lap, but Tori simply brought her hand to her mouth, cooing loudly at him as she stared at him. He smiled fondly, kissing her forehead wondering why anyone would ever leave this little bundle of joy. He rubbed her stomach gently listening to the sound of Harry walking down the stairs.
At this moment, it wasn’t about getting off at all. It was just about the here and now, bodies as one and it didn’t feel bad at all. Their bodies were moving in sync as their lips brushing together in a plea they were accepting. Pushing his arm between their bodies that seem to be stuck together, Draco wrapped his hand around Harry, stroking him slowly as he kept thrusting into him. A wordless cry came out of Harry’s lips as he came undone all over his stomach and Draco’s hand, lost in Draco’s touch that sent him into blissful heaven. After coming down from his high, he closed his eyes and kept moving his hips, needing Draco’s completion.
"After all this time, I've never realized that what I was looking for was right I front of my face." Harry says before humming Mariah Carey's song
“Well, it’s obvious that you love him, Draco. Go after him! That’s what you’re going to do.” Ms. Figg tells him.
"It's not a waste. We can get things for Tori! We can get little outfits, hats, shoes, toys, so on and so forth."
“And you two are here, running around like motherfucking children? And now you’ve got me here, feeling like a worthless, goddamn animal, running around looking crazy as a motherfucker? Bitch, you know what? See, I think you've- I think you’re jealous of me. I think you’re really trying to fuck with me. You are fucking with my life, my time and most of all, my emotions. And you’re just going to stand there and look down to me, with that damn sad look on your face? Like if you are a motherfucking saint, Malfoy?”
"Calm down, Blondie. I'm in my room. Did you use the spare key I gave you, or did you pick my lock again?" Harry shouted from his bedroom.
“You know what, Malfoy? Don’t.” Harry says while pulling away from Draco’s touch. “Don’t think about me. Don’t talk to me. Don’t even look at me, ok?” Harry turns to the bartender. “One martini-extra dirty for this dirty, conniving, snake in the grass.” He tells him while putting money on the bar.
Draco thinks to himself. He’s gonna have a great time with Flames, as he tried to bury his jealousy over Inferno and his dinner date with Harry for the night. After all, he wasn’t going to meet up with Flames again, plus the guy lived close by.
"Mph, mph, mph. I can't believe that you actually have a sympathetic side, Draco." Ron says as he and Draco sit at a table at the hospital cafeteria before taking a bite of his salad.
His distracted thoughts end when Draco tries to push down more on Harry's length, despite the fact he's already full and isn't relaxing. Since he's asleep, he has no control over his muscles, and can't will them to relax and take it easier.
"Harry, if it's about what happened the other night between Blaise and I'm truly sorry about that. I was only protecting you and I-"
"Save it, Malfoy." Harry sneers shaking his head, putting his hand up hoping that Draco will stop talking.
"Aw, Tori would you like this?" Harry asks as Draco hovers over the babbling baby. She looks at the dress and simply stares at it before smiling. "I think she likes it."
Draco hadn't showed up to his shift, again. This has been going on for the past two weeks, and honestly, he's over it. Usually, he would carpool with Ron to the hospital, but lately, he had to drag his best friend out of the house to get to work. He had no doubt that Draco was hungover, again.
"Will you forgive me?" Draco asks his friend after a few minutes of silence between them "I'm just glad that you mean well."
Draco takes in the sight of Harry’s toned body, and he certainly enjoys the view, hoping that he can ingrain the image in his head for life.
"Ron." Draco answered. "Just make sure that you're holding her correctly, Weasley. I heard that you have a reputation ofnot holding babies right."
“Let’s make a contract.” Draco says as he hands a startled Harry a napkin. "Write something up. We'll both sign it, and have Hermione take a look at it. If we don't get where we are supposed to be, then you and I will fulfill the contract."
"Yup. The water soaked my clothes and wet the floor. My neighbor was beyond pissed." Harry said as he chuckled at the memory. He placed the small baby bath that he bought for Tori in the tub, and ran the water as he made sure that it wasn't too hot or too cold. Draco gently removed Tori's onesie off which made her whine.
"Oh, stop it, Potter. You're making me smile like a Cheshire cat." Draco says, moving Harry's hand away.
"Ron is going to be late." Hermione told Harry, who's currently sitting at her table. "Anyway, what kind of burritos would you like to eat this morning?"
"You know that a gentleman never kisses and tells." Harry says as he shuffled his papers around, trying to look busy .
"No." Harry says shaking his head as he throws the phone on the couch. He'd spoken with the blonde nearly everyday for the past two weeks before bed, and seen him every night since Monday to relieve some his stress. Besides, Harry was sure that Draco would want a night off from Harry, so he decided to make his way into the kitchen and warm some leftovers. Once Harry warmed his plate of spaghetti, he made his way to the couch with his food, a bottle fo wine and turned his TV on. He started flipping channels and stopped when he saw
"I just couldn't." Draco says sadly. "If you knew how upset he'd get, then you wouldn't have told him either. I just... I couldn't bear to hurt his feelings anymore than what they were."
"Yeah, yeah, Draco. We knows What happens next. You start off by going "Hey there. I'm Draco. You're hot. Where do you want this, and how do you like it?" Harry responds.
“So last night after we went our separate ways, Draco asked me what I thought about our double date. I told him that I couldn't believe that it took so long to hang out with Ron after so long.”
"Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you." Filch said.
"I'm sorry. I don't know what I was- it was just the heat of the moment. You're just very hot and your lips look so beautiful and luscious - I think I should stop talking now." Harry said as he was trying to get his door open.
"I like when you look me in the eyes. When you try to avoid my eyes, makes me sad." Harry says as he caresses Draco's chin.
"Since you came out of your way to hang out, why don't you join us? I was going to call you and the others to finally meet Inferno, but Hermione and I were so busy with work, that I totally forgot to do so. I know it's a little bit late and too much to ask of you, but you know that you’re always welcome to stay, especially since you've turned down my offer to meet this guy several times now. You can put the food and beer in the fridge, if you want. I've cooked enough food for at least three or five people."
Deep down, he knows that Harry would never do anything like that, but he just couldn’t take that chance. It’s like walking into a relationship that’s great in the beginning but it goes downhill after a while. His mom would always tell him about the guys that he’s been with, and how he should find a respectable, decent boyfriend that would care about him. On one hand, he knew that his mom was right, but on the other hand, it hurt that his mom had said it like that. He knows that his mom means well, but he just wished that she would just stay out of his dating life, even when he knew that she was right. Besides, if he let Harry in, then he'd be different. After a moment, he hummed softly as he buckled Tori in the stroller, checking to make sure that it was secure. He put on one of Harry's jacket on, grabbed the spare keys that Harry left for him, and proceeded to fill Rex's water and food bowl.
"For starters, I can’t stand listening to those love songs anymore." Hermione tells him. "Every time you fall in love, you blast so many love songs and I can hear them through the wall for two weeks or so. As much as I love them, give it a break."
"I hope this about your little contract. Are you two finally coming to your senses and breaking the contract? You know that I want some grandkids from you and Harry, especially since you're one of my favorite cousins."
"To be honest, not at all." Draco said as he placed several kisses on her chubby cheeks. "I just don't want my little princess to grow up. I want her to be small and chunky."
"Malfoy, why are going a Go-Go Bar? I doubt I'll find anyone to date there." A miserable Harry states.
At this point, Draco turns and stared at his little three month old daughter moving around happily in her swing, cooing at the stuffed animal hovering above her.
“Ugh.” Ron says as he rolls his eyes at him. “You really need to get out more and stop sleeping around.”
"Can you give Hermione a smile, baby girl?" Draco asked as he played with the little booties on her feet, causing her to smile at Hermione.
Back at Harry’s three bedroom house, Draco is carrying the birthday boy all the way to his room with their lips attached the whole entire time.
"You are crazy if you believe that." Neville said causing Blaise to laugh at the state that Draco was giving Ron.
"God dammit, don't you fucking get it?! I don't want to do anything with you!" Draco snapped at him. "I'm surprised that Harry would want a man like you at all, you goddamn filthy animal!" Draco tells him.
"I'm Inferno. Would you care to come in?" Inferno asks, while moving from the door so that Harry can enter his house.
"You of all people should know that it's not how life works." Ron tells him. "This dude cheated on Harry, and I know your stance on cheating. If you don't tell Harry now, then he's going to find out some other way. Trust me. If you don't, you'll always have that thought in the back of your head screaming
"Harry, it was a pleasure seeing you again. Do me a favor, and see that this nerd doesn't trip on his own feet? I mean he is pretty clumsy." Ron jokes.
"I'm being serious, Harry. One day you're gonna find a guy who sees how wonderful and caring you are." Draco tells him, still unaware of the fact that he has been holding Harry's hand, fingers tangled together.
Draco realize that Ron was right. After all, Ron truly was the definition of a great friend who did hangout with him in his time of need. While he was sad that Ron was leaving after an hour, he was truly happy that Ron was able to find Hermione. Now, Hermione someone who didn't seem like his type would actually give him a chance, but in his opinion, Ron deserved some sort of happiness with someone who could make him happy, even if they're complete opposites. Just like he and Harry.
"You know something, I am happy to have met Hermione." Ron says. "I’m happy to be in bed by at least 10 pm now."
"Honey, don't try to lie to your mother, I see right through you. Besides I've got Holly as an alibi. Oh! And what about Holly, you won't be able to see her for another Christmass!" His mother cried.
It didn't mean Harry wasn't feeling slightly uncomfortable…for multiple reasons… he just hoped Draco hadn't realized it, or worse
Hermione opened her mouth, looking affronted. And Ron just wanted to jump in glee because he never managed to do that, but then he remembered that they were actually fighting and that wouldn't be what you call
When Draco felt Potters' fangs pressing lightly on his neck, he whimpered before realizing he should stop this. It was obvious that Potter wasn't in control of his actions to Draco's dismay.
When it met with his tongue Harry felt his taste buds sing with satisfaction, adoration and fulfilment as it praised the liquid into the heavens. He could taste Draco's heartbeat, bouncing into a hypnotizing rhythm while he drew more of the blood into his mouth. He didn't close his eyes though. Draco's eyes being the only thing anchoring him, reassuring him that he wasn't in pain.
"Of course! Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school here, and now he's told Draco how to do it."
"I can't stop myself! Every time I see him I just, I just, I just can't meet his eyes, or even stand by his side! It just makes me all warm and fuzzy inside that I almost can't stop myself to take a deep breath and breath in that amazing smell, I tell you it's a crisis." Hermione said guiltily but serious.
"Oops, sorry my fault," Harry said, turning back around and seeing blond hair almost disappearing into his chest.
He breathed a sigh of relief and felt his eyes dropping a bit. When he tried to lie on his thigh though, he felt pain on his neck. He brought the hand that had been lying there in front of him, seeing that his claws were red with blood. He frowned as he moved his hand back and felt two punctures left in his skin.
"Yes, he is! And I'm not feeling guilty about anything!" Harry said out loud, having managed not to shout but not to keep the anger in his tone at bay.
Harry jumped at hearing Draco's voice and looked as if he was caught doing something he shouldn't be doing.
What was wrong with him? He was supposed to be happy for Malfoy for making friends. Yes, it had been an unexpected one, but who cared?!
She also barked for her minions to grab the golden trio to her office. To her apparently, the whole show was one of her so-called conspiracies and so she was 'interrogating' them. Threatening to torture them if they wouldn't tell her. It was at that moment Dumbledore appeared together with Fudge.
Yep, strange indeed, but Harry didn't mind it very much. He was too distracted by his own anticipation to question about Ron's change of beliefs.
"That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy." Harry said worriedly.
Harry turned around his whole vision gone to black. He heard some worried whispers and saw Malfoy's eyes widen. This time, however, he had control over it. He wasn't going to hurt Malfoy…
Everyone screamed. They all knew trolls were dangerous and highly aggressive, yes they also knew that they were stupid, but you didn't need brains to smack with a gigantic mace.
'Maybe I should talk with Dumbledore about this.' Harry thought as his eyes wandered back again to a certain blond Slytherin.
"They're called Thestrals. They're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit-"
He was going to die, he was sure of it. No one could take this much pleasure and survive. Taking a deep breath Draco was glad for the cold night air, cooling down his definitely overheated body. Humming, Draco found himself sniffing more. Finding a delicious scent overtaking him. It smelled like the forest, only there was something else, something cinnamony, it seemed to intertwine with his scent and he couldn't help but welcome it.
"It's just… I've never talked to a snake before. Do you… I mean… do you talk to people often?" Harry asked.
Ron opened his mouth, ready to reply, but stopped himself as he looked at Hermione. She could see the inner dilemma that was forming in his head. He stepped closer to her, hanging his head to meet her eyes as he whispered; "What did you want to talk about?"
"Dry up Dursley, you great prune." The man said. And while he said that he bent the shotgun up into the air. And as if the gun wanted to make it more dramatic it fired a bullet.
Harry turned around and yelled, " My dad wasn't a drunk!" On which his aunt dropped her wine glass, obviously shocked.
" Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, after Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem." Hagrid said not understanding why he was asked all of this.
. Someone who made his entire being tremble with delight and devotion. He'd never had someone who his vampire felt so in sink with. He wasn't even sure if it liked anything besides the taste of blood, but it seemed to like Draco an awful lot. And Harry found himself asking, more than ones if maybe this was how it felt to be mated to somebody.
He'd asked permission from Dumbledore about it, trying not to get overly annoyed as the man offered him a lemon drop. He hated lemon.
Hermione was silent after that until she said with some guilt, "That might be because after you were poisoned and lay unconscious in the hospital wing, you kept calling my name in your sleep."
Harry ran towards the bed, standing beside it, wanting, but not daring to touch. And started to panic. He couldn't be dead, Snape would've told him, send him to jail, he couldn't be dead.
Harry had no idea when he'd moved, when he'd pushed Draco against the wall, or when he pushed his mouth against Draco's in a hungry need for more. The only real thing that registered to him was how much he wanted it, how much he wanted to show to Draco that he belonged to him. And when he heard Draco moan at his ministrations, smelled Draco's scent spike up a bit, he wasn't sure if he could stop.
Draco shuddered as he made a disgusted sound, shaking his head as he pulled up a clean pair of trousers. His wolf starting to run circles in his head –impatient- Draco knew it wanted to find Harry as quickly as possible, it always seemed to relax and wag its tail when the vampire was close. Not that Draco minded, it actually made him quite relieved, stepping into a relationship where a part of Draco wanted to do nothing more than to rip his lover's throat out wasn't what they would call
Then Harry realized he was being stupid and wanted to facepalm himself because 'Of course he sounds like a wolf, he's a bloody werewolf.'
Hermione lay down and covered her top half, face still flushed. As she saw Ron sitting down next to her she couldn't help but smile as he handed her a chocolate frog.
"Hey, pea brain!" Ron said throwing a piece of wood hitting the trolls' head and distracting it for a little bit so Hermione could move.
"Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man!" Hermione said dashing towards Dumbledore.
"A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. A sorry lot this, Hagrid." Filch said, which was responded by Hagrid sniffling. "Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
Harry nodded before sitting on the grass, taking his own runner shoes off and putting the other ones on. As he stood, he didn't feel any different.
When Malfoy turned around, Harry went back to his stalkerish behavior when someone came up to him as he was peeking behind the corner Malfoy had just taken a turn in.
"Harry, that's Katie. Katie Bell." Hermione explained, seeing Harry looking over at the commotion in confusion. "She's had dragon pox for a couple of weeks so hasn't been at school for a while."
Hermione got slightly dizzy as she smelled Ron's scent heavy in the air. Seeing him look at her with a worried expression asking her if she was okay.
"It's unbelievable how senile that Filch gets! Do you know how hard he was gripping my arm? He should be fired for that!" Malfoy yelled in outrage to Snape. When Malfoy and Snape exited the party, Harry couldn't help but follow them and decided to hide behind a wall and eavesdrop on them.
"It's just a bit tender, that's all," He said, pointing at Harry's bite mark. Harry watched as Draco caressed it, lovingly. His thoughts drifting back to earlier that evening.
When finally in front of the giant building of the joke shop he had felt accomplished before entering the building. He'd seen a lot of people there, sneaking around, laughing, puking. Some had stared at him weirdly, which had made Harry frown.
Draco was of course immediately interested in what was going on, his mother always told him he was a very curious child, so he walked to the door looking through the keyhole.
"I hope we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to…What was the phrase? come quietly. Well, I can tell you this, I have no intention of going to Azkaban." Dumbledore said calmly which seemed to irritate Umbridge further to Harry's delight.
"Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of Hagrid." The spider said in a creepy tone before it disappeared again.
True, when he turned eighteen and hit werewolf maturity. He'd expected to have a bit more muscle, his senses a bit more heightened and his speed a bit faster. But already seeing that Potter had appeared into the Great Hall in a flash, made him nervous and self-conscious.
"Ohh, ah, nmm, nh" Draco moaned with an occasional shudder pressing his claws into Harry's skin and probably breaking it but Harry didn't seem to mind nor care.
"And that other one, what was his name? Derek? Dylan? I don't know, go see for yourself," Her grandmother smiled at her.
Hermione and Ron turned their frowning faces towards Harry. Harry was still backing down and almost falling in the progress, while Malfoy was pointing at him with his body tense.
"It was on your bed. The box. Thought since you don't eat candy, I'd try one...or twenty. I can't stop thinking about her, Harry." Ron said, still sounding strange while picking up a heart-shaped box. Harry wasn't angry Ron had eaten the candy, why would anyone send him candy anyway? Some probably thought that since he could eat muggle food/candy, that he wanted to. And when that happened he would either ways give it to Hermione or Ron, so he wasn't bothered by it at all.
" The voice said, Harry started to panic and he walked a little faster, trying to follow the faint smell of blood.
He supposed they had already picked out their presents, if the discarded paper rap was anything to go by.
'You got to be kidding me.' Harry thought surprised. Sure, he'd valentines gifts before but he'd supposed they were out of politeness, not because anyone was actually interested in him. But giving him chocolates obviously infected with love potion was something different. And even though it was dangerous and stupid, Harry couldn't help but blush.
When Draco was far enough from her he could think normally again but only remembering a vague part of the interaction with the brown furred wolf. He did, however, knew that it was Granger.
"My aunt lets me watch cartoons." Neville shrugged like it was all the explanation that was needed. "You'd be surprised how much you learn from them, the other day I even..."
"WHAT! I heard you the first time!" Draco yelled as he turned to look at the slightly irritated brown-haired girl. Hermione gave an exasperated sigh before shaking her head in fondness.
Draco closed the door, swallowing as he saw Harry take a sniff inside the room. He fumbled with his hands as he saw Harry's back muscles move, wanting so bad to just…
'He will probably be just as an arselicker as all the other people I know.' Draco thought bitterly. Draco looked at where the sent came from. He saw a boy with raven colored hair.
"I'm sorry for not telling you," Harry said quietly, Ron not responding. "I know you are angry with me, and…I deserve it,"
Harry was surprised when Hermione didn't give him one of her famous lectures on how dangerous it was to go into the forbidden forest on a full moon. She didn't even give him a stern look. It was as if she'd forgotten. Not that Harry was complaining.
"That settles it. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend." McGonagall said, but unlike Snape, she didn't hide her amusement.
"Because…"Draco rummaged through one of the drawers, standing up straight when he appeared to have found the thing he was looking for. He turned towards Harry, presenting him with a green tie. "we need something to fasten you down on."
Hermione looked down at her plate, caressing the side of it. Harry could see she felt guilty but also uncertain and a bit scared.
All the while Draco was talking about all the different creatures that were supposed to be in the lake. Harry had been surprised by Draco's knowledge about all the different creatures since he didn't seem to pay much attention to Care of Magical Creatures.
"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!" Voldemort yelled in outrage. Harry turned back towards him, his eyes black and felt his fangs growing.
"And don't you just love tolerating me, sweetheart? The way your cock keeps twitching gives me a pretty clear picture of that."
"Well, you're actions make me doubt that very much!" Ron shouted while a large group of first-years came into the room before deciding to back away quickly. Neville still sitting there as he opened his notebook.
Then he looked a bit concerned and quickly added. "We don't have to, I mean it's not something important,"
Ron swallowed as he felt his cock stand at full mast, wanting to touch it but to entranced by looking at Hermione as she arched her back of the bed moaning out
There was a giant pine tree standing at the teachers' table and some smaller ones spread across the room, actually, they were sitting right next to one. They were decorated in all of the house colors and dim lights. Making the room much darker if it wasn't for the giant fire in front of them.
"I mean, knowing Draco, I don't think he will appreciate this very much. I think he would prefer it if you just be yourself and see how it goes. You know, without the sudden halo of luck covering you from head to toe. He isn't able to use it, so it seems a bit unfair…"
Draco groaned loudly, his hand having moved to Harry's head when searching for something to hold onto. "Alright, that's…new," He could feel Harry's breath on him as he laughed, relaxing him.
As he closed the door behind him, Draco found himself leaning against it. Eyes wide as his breath came out in loud, shaky puffs. He couldn't help but swallow in an attempt to moisten his throat that had run dry very quickly after noticing Harry's-Harry's…
And even if Harry had been suicidal and said something to Draco that had nothing to do with their potion, he knew Draco wouldn't hear any of it. Knowing that deep inside, even when the blonde didn't want to admit it, rested an inner Hermione that wanted to do great on his finals and would even listen to someone as annoying as Slughorn if it meant he was going to get a perfect score.
Hermione silently walked into the room, not looking at anyone as she took her seat, much to Draco's confusion. She always greeted him.
The next lesson Harry wanted to help the magical students and showing the non-magical how things worked and that they shouldn't underestimate people on a lower rank like wizards.
Harry looked up at his boyfriend. The werewolf's grey eyes staring right back at him with curiosity and agitation. Which wasn't anything new, as both of them had studied hard these last few days. Researching their potion and figuring out how it could strike its maximum power. But who cared. Life was meaningless anyway.
Which brought him back to when the love of his life died, or sort of died. He was so relieved when he saw Potter standing up, so much so that he was holding himself back on running towards him and hugging the boy. He knew it wouldn't be appreciated, he would probably just make a fool of himself.
"You shall not harm Harry Potter!" He yelled, before he blasted Lucius backwards, landing in a crumpled heap, when he rised he stared murderously at Harry.
"Yes, quite a bit actually." Draco arrogantly crossed his arms in front of him. A mischievous gleam in his eye that Harry didn't get to see all that often. It was usually at times he was trying to prank him like that time Draco told him Snape was actually a famous ballerina in the supernatural world. Of course he had laughed it off and said
Was the last thing Lupin heard, instantly recognizing the voice. But he didn't say anything, Lupin was even more shocked when he saw Draco falling to the ground, starting to cry.
"Hm? No, of course not. Why would there be?" Hermione answered, still not looking at him. He frowned. It was obvious something was bothering her, so why would she lie?
He decided to hide behind the corner watching everyone that came out, they were smiling and whispering. He saw some Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, and Gryffindors.
"Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you must look beyond…" Trelawney said walking around the classroom.
"That nasty little ferret," Ron said fiercely under his breath. "I mean, can't you see how much time they are spending together?! It's just sickly. I bet he's the reason Hermione doesn't talk to me anymore, the prat." Ron said bitterly, taking a sip from his goblet.
It was named after a Greek myth, about a nymph names Clythie who was deeply in love with the sun god Helios, only he didn't love her in return. Abandoned, she spent the rest of her days pining away until her death. Helios, taking pity on her transformed her body into a beautiful flower. And even to this day, the plant dutifully followed the sun, faithful to her beloved.
Sure, even if he wasn't avoiding Harry like the pest, Harry didn't know what to say to him either. He didn't know how to react to Malfoy's display of vulnerability, if that was what it was. Had Harry been wrong all along? Had his friends been right? Or was he right, and it was all an act? Malfoy did say '
He looked up from the table seeing and hearing Hermione frantically spilling out explanations about god knows what. Hermione -mistakenly- thinking that his frustration had anything to do with her vague answer, had apparently started to apologize to him all the while he was drowning in self-misery.
was when his eyes rolled back in their sockets. Harry ravaging him down as he kissed, licked, touched every part of him bellow, moving himself a way down to his balls as he started sucking on them and making Draco practically howl with excitement.
"Tell me," Harry commanded, a low rumble coming forward as he licked his lips. He didn't know what he was doing. He could feel his fangs starting to fall down, his rational thoughts getting pressed into the back of his mind.
Taking a deep breath Harry ran into the brick wall only to emerge on another lane, with a big red train and lots of people… or should he say, creatures?
His brain wasn't really catching up as Harry slid in some more, wiggling it around a bit while being conscious not to hurt Draco. This did stir something in Draco, he caught himself letting some of his tension and nerves go while Harry worked more of his finger inside. When it was fully in Harry squinted his eyes, moving his head sideways. Draco could practically hear the gears inside the raven-haired boy's head begin to churn. He considered telling him how to proceed as Harry seemed at a loss on what to do exactly which was highly unusual for the confident Gryffindor.
"I said just this once!" He yelled before slapping the pillow on the raven-haired's head, who yelled back indignantly.
had tackled the other boy down onto the bed and not the other way around. No, it was more his nerves wreaking havoc than anything else. Because he knew where this was going.
"You think it's funny I'm a Griffen and I'm in Gryffindor, aren't you?" Oliver asked his face impassive.
"It's really remarkable Harry how less you know about your species." She said before skipping away. Harry was puzzled, but that was nothing new, especially if he just talked to Hermione.
"I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament."
"Nothing, sorry what did you ask me again, Draco?" Harry changed the subject, giving all of his attention to the beautiful Slytherin.
Draco watched happily as Harry drank from the goblet again. He'd noticed that the vampire hadn't been eating that well lately, so he was relieved to notice Harry eating again. Even when he was a little disappointed, knowing it was just blood from some random muggle.
"Harry you need to get up, you know McGonagall will kill us if we're too late. You too Ron why aren't you dressed yet?!" Neville said his voice full of worry and a little impatience.
"So, why not give it a shot?" Ron asked after his laughter cooled down, looking at him quizzically. "I mean, I get the distaste on not being able to finish even one sentence with her, been there done that. I'm just saying, that mate, you've been literally overrun by love confessions. I can see it's tiring you, it's tiring me, it's tiring Hermione…so just pick one that seems nice, get to know her and hey, maybe she will be the one! At least you won't get bothered by barbie one and two while you guys are dating even when it turns out you don't like her,"
"I think that it gets better if I move a bit, get you accustomed," He said, his voice tender, "You can grab onto me if you like, I can handle some small scratches."
But Harry's eyes kept watching it, pupils slowly dilating and a faint blush covering his cheeks as he started fidgetting. Looking up at Draco hesitantly, Draco could see the want in his lover's eyes as well as the nerves that accompanied it.
"Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page." Draco spat, he was trying to make it teasing but it came out wrong… again.
"What?" She blinked, getting hauled out of her happy-friend-thoughts and back into reality with Harry hovering above her. "No! He tells me those things in confidence! You don't want me rattling to him about how…perfect his eyes are, do you?" She said flustered.
"Let me show you," Draco pressed his foot against the dip of Harry's back, the vampire giving him a wolfish grin as his thrusts came back full force.
Harry stared up at Draco's face, his eyes wide and hungry. And Draco could feel his member stir at that. Feel it pumping and pushing against his trouser as it wanted to be let free. That look undid him every time. The way Harry seemed to look at nothing else but him, the way his eyes shone that fierce green color with a black ring staining the outside of his irises. The way they blazed with arousal and need… But even though Draco could feel his cock hardening, see Harry's clear want on the vampire's face, Harry didn't move. His hands staying rested on the couch as he seemed to consider something.
"Well, I was five at the time. And even though I think muggles are pretty stupid, I need to give it to them, they do make the best chips." Draco nodded as he stared into space before putting another hand in his mouth. He looked out of the window towards the dark sky, seeing the moon almost at its peak.
Then again, it might not have been necessary. Which was what Draco had worried about for non-stop. That one day, someone would show up and blink their long eyelashes at his lover saying that it was
"No idea."Harry immediately said, his nerves returning tenfold. Should he really do this? Was Hermione right all along?
"What do you mean?" Harry asked confused. Ron rolled his eyes, putting another piece of pizza in his mouth.
"So, so it's true? I mean… are you really a...vampire? And do you really have that… that." Ron stammered.
"What the hell Potter?! You want to scare me to death?!" Draco shrieked in outrage, but Harry didn't seem affected by it, much to the werewolves disappointment. More like he seemed to be amused by Draco's anger which infuriated Draco all the more.
"I need your blood." She said, making Draco frown with a look of suspicion. "It's for an experiment, you know for, ehm… it's about a… I just need a
"He's just being modest," Hermione said still trying to make him look like a hero they should follow, and it was a smart strategy since it was for their own good but that wasn't how Harry wanted to do this.
Harry kept repeating in his head, Draco's moans spurring him further on. His tongue lapping and twisting in ways he knew would make Draco come apart. He wasn't going to end it that soon though, planning his next step carefully.
"Maybe we should get in, the train will be leaving any second now," Hermione said, sneaking a glance at him as he mutely nodded.
"Glad to hear that," He started, arms folded over his chest, "And has Draco received anything from his application yet?"
And that's how he got here. Thinking of how he shouldn't do this as well as why he should, but all the while hesitating to knock on the door.
"Well, go to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick in the arse for me!" Draco said jokingly.
It was a weird sort sensation, but pleasurable all the same. It made Harry's eyelids droop and his breath come out in small puffs. He wasn't ready to succumb though.
Harry couldn't help but snigger at that, he knew Ron's temper wasn't something to be underestimated, though he didn't want to be on the receiving end of one again he would sometimes provoke one out of him. To see how he reacted…which mostly ended up like it had with Elliot.
It still felt somewhat surreal. Draco never thought of, never actually imagined, that Harry would ever feel that way towards
"It's Ron. I know I'm not supposed to be here, Dumbledore made a whole announcement on it you know. But… I'm worried, I wanted to make sure you're okay." Ron said, his tone calm and soft not wanting to startle her.
It wasn't really surprising his wolf would be all anxious. Werewolves where very clingy lovers, wanting to be with their lovers 24/7. They could of course behave and date like normal creatures thanks to their human part, but being exposed to so much attention from
" Harry gripped the bedding on either side of his head, holding onto it just like he had done while letting out a desperate whine. "Dammit, Draco,"
"Thanks. It seems you're about the only one that does." Harry said somberly thinking about how Seamus was acting towards him the fear coming off of him.
feelings creeping up on me and…ehm… I don't know what to do." Draco said, and that was enough for his mother to tear her eyes off of her book, looking straight at Draco. And who could blame her, Draco
At first, he didn't feel anything change, no sudden giddiness, no sense of luck or anything like that and he slowly felt disappointment gnaw at him. Maybe he really did wait too long. He was about to tell his friends when he felt something similar to a lightning bolt course through him.
"What? Again to scared to say anything? Oh, wait don't tell me you're not only stupid and deaf but also blind and mute?" Malfoy asked mockingly.
"…You know, I really think you both should have a big talk. Clear the air, with…whatever, is bothering you two." He scooted a bit closer to the table as both of his friends looked down on it, guiltily. Neville shrugged, feeling a little uncomfortable in this…situation. –much like he has been the whole weird experience. Sitting there, not knowing what the heck he should do; he should make a countdown on how many times that happened, he contemplated. The clock ticked on further and further, the long arrow moving just that bit to the side. Announcing the few minutes that had passed. The seconds. Aaand he probably was going to have to skip dinner to help push these two to talk, wasn't he? 'I could always plunder Seamus drawer later,' Neville thought as he muttered, "You know, you can't just start screaming at each other like you want to rip the other's head off…It's not really
"No worries, not my first time being almost crushed into a pulp like a bag of chips," Draco said, looking over at Harry with a slight blush tinting his cheeks.
"I mean really! Do you know how hard it was not to stare at that massive –OOF! Hey, what was that for?!" Ron yelled, but it didn't really reach Harry's ears. Too deep into his thoughts and mild panic attack to actually hear his friend.
Draco hoped the dim lighting would make it unable for Harry notice the stupid blush that came over him. Dammit, why did his lover always catch him off guard? Now he really cursed Weasley for throwing his dumb party and letting Harry make him so flustered. Even when his whole body fluttered with affection for his lover's actions.
How could he have been so foolish? Of course, Harry hadn't kissed him because he wanted- It was meant as a joke. It was tradition to kiss anyone who was under the mistletoe, Harry had probably seen it and thought why the hell not? He always jumped into things like this, how could Draco even begin to think it was more than that? No way that Harry liked him like that, why would he? Draco had ruined it by kissing him back, by misinterpreting what was happening and now, Harry surely knew Draco's feeling and it would all be over.
Draco felt himself deflate a bit, unwilling to worry his lover just because he had a bad day. He walked up to him and sat down on the couch, motioning for Harry to sit down as well.
Draco knowing centaurs were peaceful creatures and so he ran to look for Hagrid leaving Harry there.
And there he was; walking towards the Great Hall with his two best friends in tow, completely oblivious to what he'd been up to. He hadn't even told them about his massive crush, let alone that he was now in a serious relationship with that person. He hadn't told this to the two people who he had entrusted in
Of course, as luck might have it, she slammed the cover a little too loud –making the sound revibrate through the entire room and bring her to the centre of attention. She closed her eyes when she heard the hissing sound of the librarian.
He wetted his lips, his eyes moving from the ground to the ceiling as he stumbled through his words, making Hermione frown and nod her head in reassurance.
Harry felt himself go crazy. His mind was scattered into a chaos and all of his senses were continuously being triggered. He tried to keep calm, talking to Draco about potion's class and what he'd been doing today. But as he looked at Draco he found himself getting even more distracted.
Although it was strange Harry did, however, stop with laughing -rather awkwardly might he add- ending it with a long sigh. He looked around the room, glad most students were still in class or studying in the library, it meant they could talk some more without getting eavesdropped by noisy meddlers.
FIRST OF ALL, I want to make clear that when Draco was describing Harry's status (low ranking and no power) I meant it in like his family, with Draco and Ron I meant in like Draco's family and him being a werewolf. If you were confused by that.
"True, I might have sat on it at some point, but I imagine it will taste the same." The man said while taking some sort of package behind his back. He gave the package to Harry while saying, "I baked it myself, words and all."
"Really good, just one taste…" Harry said a bit hoarse, letting a fang softly cares the wolfs' skin.
"…Ron, I don't see him as food. It's more than that. Sure, I've thought about sinking my teeth in that pale, long…
He looked around, seeing that the room was as big as a normal room, maybe a little smaller. But instead of having five beds it had one, his own private four poster bed with the usual green curtains. Next to it was a little fridge which was stuffed with what Draco guessed where food and drinks so he wouldn't starve to death or dehydration. There was also a closet with a bunch of clean clothes, bedsheets, pillows and soft blankets. The room had a small window that couldn't open too far but was still able to bring some fresh air in the room as well as some light.
"God, that's really embarrassing," Harry silently groaned to himself. Rubbing his eyes, trying to rub his shame away.
"You know it's not a contest," She told him, matter of factly, "I'm sure Draco will be happy with whatever you give to him, so don't beat yourself up over it,"
Harry looked at Hermione with shock, trying to pick himself up again after… How dare she starting to lecture
Harry felt his entire being tremble. He was moody, he was lonely, he was depressed and he was frustrated as fuck.
Harry didn't know what was going on with his best friends. Apparently, according to Ron, Hermione's knickers where in a twist and at the night of the celebrating party, Hermione had send angry red birds at him and Lavender when they found her sitting on the stairs. And according to Hermione Ron was acting like a spoiled brat, and didn't stop complaining about that she'd to make other arrangements for the party.
"Sooo, what are you doing in the middle of a corridor?" Draco asked, his voice sounding sweet, making Harry's throat go dry yet again.
For a moment he was confused about where, exactly, he was. Before a ton of humiliating memories burst in his mind. He looked down to see himself completely naked and couldn't help but blush, when he looked at the mattress he saw a large dark spot where his knot had spurted his cum. He was still hot and needy, but it was dimmed a bit in comparison to yesterday. Shivering a bit he covered his naked body and walked over to the closet to pick up some sweatpants and a very soft looking shirt.
"Sorry, could you repeat that?" Snape asked, clearly to annoy Malfoy further. And hearing Malfoy sigh, it seemed it had worked.
"Can we go to a place a little more private?" She asked hopefully. And to her relief, Ron answered with a "Fine" and a huff. He followed her as she led them both to the stairs she had been crying on after Rons' kiss with Lavender.
"So tell us, Harry, what have you been up to?" Ron asked, smiling at him with curiosity. He felt Hermione's hair brush against his arm as she came into step with them. He didn't look at her, afraid that she would see right through him with that calculating gaze of hers.
Harry sighed. Why wasn't he able to shut his stupid mouth? He knew Ron was upset, and he knew that if he defended their former bully Ron would start acting up, but he couldn't help himself! It just came out by impulse. He just couldn't handle Ron insulting his...friend.
I hope you guys liked this chapter, I have never written any smut so I hope I didn't disappoint you.
"Hmmm…let's see, I already know what's your favorite subject, that's obvious you wouldn't actually teach something, with a risk of being expelled, without liking it now, would we? But I need to say I'm curious. Who is your favorite teacher?" Draco said, narrowing his eyes on the raven-haired boy as if it held all the answers to the universe.
Draco only needed to show his fangs before the wolf started running away. Draco was satisfied with that but when he wanted to walk away from the clearing, a scent hit him. Draco put his nose in the air sniffing ones more, then he heard someone's heart beating furiously behind him.
"It's true then what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts." Draco said. This is Crabbe, and Goyle they are chupacabras…and I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm a werewolf."
There he saw her. The most beautiful, intelligent girl in Hogwarts, smiling and waving at him. He was so lucky to be her friend, even though he wanted to be so much more.
in a relationship and that he couldn't tell Ron that: no, he couldn't date someone because technically he wasn't single anymore. Which Ron or Hermione for that matter, didn't know that.
"Wait. Has Hermione run away too?" Harry suddenly asked, his eyes snapping away from the door to meet Ron's. Calmer then before but not less worried.
Harry knew how soft they were, had touched those parted lips before with his own. And, oh how tempted he was to do it all over again-
'Think Ron, think!' He thought to himself. Standing there like an idiot for at least five minutes or so. He looked at the back bag he brought with him, stored with books of his previous classes, his quill and ink, his wand, some snacks he was tempted to eat right about now… HIS WAND!
"I'll- I'll just leave- I'm sorry," Draco said his voice shaky as he furiously rubbed his eyes and moved to get passed Harry who'd stood up.
But as he tried to look down to catch his lover's eyes, the only thing he found was the fluff of the vampire's black-hair. And within seconds his whole mind was blown away again by the feel of
Which led to both of them smiling toothily and a good night's kiss Harry was sure he wouldn't forget about any time soon. He would also make sure to remember the way Draco's face blushed in an uncontrollable manner at being called
"Ah, there is my smart grandchild. Come, come," Her grandfather said after spotting her by the door, encouraging her to get closer. "Give old grandpa a hug."
It confused Harry, if this house-elf was one from the Malfoy's, why did she talk to Malfoy with such a motherly tone? "Excuse me, sir. My name is Holly, could you tell me who you are, and why you're standing by my masters' bed." Holly asked with the same kind tone, finally looking up at Harry.
“Don’t worry about that, Draco. What’s done is done at this point. You might be able to find him at your friend's house. But take someone with you because you look a little bit frazzled.”
"Draco, this is Neville Longbottom." Harry said as he placed a hand on the lean, blonde man who waved at Draco. "And that one right there is Blaise Zabini." He finished pointing at the brown skinned man.
"So, what are you in the mood for? She asks him teasingly, knowing that he'll be in the mood for pizza and some wings.
"Draco, I can assure you that the guy that you were with was a total douche nugget. Harry is different. He's just like you to be honest. He simply wants someone to love him for him and not just for his bank account. You just want someone to love you, truly love and take care of you and Tori. I promise you that Harry isn't like that and he's one of the sweetest guys in the world."
“Do you want this? Do you really want this?” A naked Harry asks Draco twenty minutes after their first round.
Draco’s blood runs cold and he feels his heart breaking into a million pieces as he starts to tear up.
"My name is Draco Malfoy." The blonde said before taking a sip of his hot chocolate. "What's yours?"
Harry simply tilts his head and gives her a look, smirking at her as he shakes his head at her while she smiles at him.
all because an ex of his cheated on him with someone who was a carbon, wannabe copy, of a cheap ass model. Fuck 'em.
The only thing that was on as they were going home was the radio playing in sweet silence, and Harry had never felt to happy in his life. He was extremely happy that this relationship between the two of them was actually moving forward, even if it was at a slow pace.
"Oh, how I wish someone would look at me like that." Said Harry, sounding sad and heartbroken. "Why can't I find my one and only?"
I never thought that anyone would love me after all these years of failed dates and being so uptight about things. When I met Draco all those years ago when we were young men in college, I never thought that he would be my knight in shining armor.
"Remind me to thank Harry for that by making his favorite meal." Sirius says while wiping the tears away. “Go on with your story." Sirius tells him, finally trying to catch his breath.
"Sorry to burst your bubble, but you do like to drink a lot when you celebrate your birthday." Draco says. "I just- it's- I want you to be able to experience the
." Draco says playfully, causing Harry to chuckle. "You know what? I made mistake with being with Gregory. He was an asshole, through and through to the very end."
"Everything Sirius makes is fantastic. I swear Draco, he's sent from up above because he really is the best."
"Thank you." Harry said. "I've been told that I've been unfailingly kind like her. That and that I have her eyes. I'm glad that you like them."
Harry moans at once from the familiar taste of Draco in his mouth as Draco bucks his hips up in a natural reaction. Harry looks up at Draco through his lashes to see Draco tossing his head from the side, whimpering in his sleep. Harry smiles around Draco's cock and takes more into his mouth, sliding his tongue underneath Draco's foreskin as he goes down.
Draco looked at her with pleading eyes as Harry is shock. He can’t believe that Draco has had their contract in his wallet for a decade.
Harry smiles as he's going up the stairs of his home as Draco is following close behind him with Tori cooing in his arms.
"A surprise. Just walk and talk with me, Malfoy." Neville says as he dragged him to an apparel store.
or something? Nope. It was just him and Harry. His Harry who was standing inches away from him with his eyes swelling up, visibly upset.
"You know, you can either walk with the devil or you don't and he's definitely not walking with the devil on this one. After all he is a hopeless romantic. It's probably best for the both of us if he leaves." Draco says as he's trying to see himself in Harry's shoes.
"His name is Draco, and his boyfriend left him and their baby girl." Harry said as he's grabbing his coat and his bag. "He needs a place to stay."
, but it’s something that I’ve come to grips with. Yes, it’s hard to forgive, but it is human nature. Letting go of anger and bitterness can work wonders for both your attitude and your health, not to mention your relationships. It's hard to forgive, but I have learned that no one can help you with your own personal resentment but yourself. It doesn't help to hold on to things that make you miserable at all. Learning how to let it go may not always be the best feeling in the world, but you know, it's better to be in a better place where you are thriving.
"In a moment." Draco said as he was burping his daughter. As he was burping his daughter, Victoria smiled at Harry.
"You think that kissing me would change my mind?" A hysterical Harry asked him. “Did you honestly think that kissing me would achieve anything at all?”
“You’re the amazing one.” Harry says before placing a kiss on Draco’s spine. He grabs Draco’s hips and starts pounding into him at a hard, but gentle pace. The deeper he gets into Draco, he can here Draco’s moans which starts to get louder and louder.
"You are." Malfoy says as he rides his hard on out. “Just like the last time, babe.” Harry starts to feel giddy again.
He stops, puts the mirror down and leans back in his seat as he looks at his friend, impressed with her words.
"I always apologize for the things I haven't done. Anyway, when I got back home, I saw a note that basically said that he didn't want to be a father and that he didn't want to be with me."
"Hello." Draco said when Lily and James came over to him to introduce themselves to him. They sat down at the table cooing at Tori who was staring at them.
"He sure did. I’m a lucky girl and he’s a lucky guy. I should really tell you how he delivers in bed."
"I don't care what his name is, Draco. God! Why are you even my best friend? What's the point of being here, at this bar? You-" Harry shouts, while every patron at the bar looks at Harry.
"Some dinner and maybe a movie." Harry answered. "We'll be back by 8 o'clock, that is if Draco doesn't get to home sick."
Draco nods as he picks up his daughter. He kissed her forehead a few times and he watched her squirm a few times.
"Shut up, Draco!" Harry blushes madly. "See ya tomorrow." Harry says, kissing Draco before he leaves the house.
“There’s the smile I love! Thank goodness you got my looks. You are going to be breaking hearts when you’re older, baby girl.” Draco said as he kissed her clothed stomach. He sat aback and simply admired Tori’s outfit that Harry picked out for her. Harry had gone to work this morning and Draco had promised that he would visit later in the day. It was officially five weeks since Draco and Tori had been staying with Harry, and it was great.
is something that is very valuable to me. I have the best support system that consists of: you, my parents, Sirius, Hermione, Ron, Neville and Luna, and to tell you the truth, I couldn't ask for any better because you're all so amazing. You are the most important people in my life that have always inspired me to be a better person. It is amazing that you all provide me with motivation to achieve my goals, whether or not they seemed like impossible dreams or not. You empower me to make the changes I need to succeed and cheer on my success. Often times, I always think about the qualities that you all have, and I'd also think about several other things when we interact with one another.
Draco smiles at his sincerity, but he looks down as Harry get distracted playing with Tori. He wants to believe the man, but he has a hard time doing so.
"It shows?!" He says, completely embarrassed as he pulls out a mirror out of his desk drawer, thinking that the songs had given him away.
Thanks for reading and sharing your comments with me! I truly appreciate you for stopping by and reading, more than you could ever know. I Will Be Back With A New Drarry On September 1st, Y'all. What Do You Think It's Going To Be About?
“Harry! HARRY!” Draco screams. When he sees Harry slip out the door, his tears flow freely from his eyes and all he can think about is how both he and Harry are emotionally damaged for one night.
"I mean, I'm no fool at all. I am not one to be subtle, but I can't be that oblivious to miss out on the most perfect guy that has been brightening up my world for over well over a decade."
"You knew that party was a going away party." Draco snarled. "I can't believe that you made me go to that party with my hopes being raised."
"Yup, and after aboutt a decade, it doesn't get old. Shall we get a couple beers after we go dance on the dance floor?" Draco asked his friend.
Considering the given situation, Draco shouldn’t be happy that Harry and Inferno (or Flames) are now broken up, but deep down he’s happy to spend time with Harry again, all to himself.
Draco waited for a moment, just until Harry bottomed out. After a brief moment of studying Draco’s beauty, he gently pulled Draco by his neck and kissed him once.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, me buying clothes for people is not a waste, got it? I'm doing this because I want to, and you don't even have to pay me back." Neville says.
Now, in hindsight Draco should been happy that his best friend had found a potential mate, but if he was being honest himself, he wasn't happy in anyway shape or form. In fact, he felt..... very discouraged and he couldn't figure out why he was feeling like that. This was strange to him as things were working out in his favor, but something was holding him back from truly enjoying this outcome.
"I think it's perfect, so don't stress yourself out, babe." Draco tells him while walking up to Harry. "Knowing you for…..practically all my adult life, you’ve never done anything half-assed or small. You love making big gestures, taking care of everybody and making sure that everything is perfect. It's one of the things that I love most about you." Draco tells him, while cupping Harry's cheeks.
Two hours later, they are finally leaving the mall and Harry didn't think that shopping for baby clothes and toys would be so much fun.
"Look, just to dinner and have a talk with Harry. I think I’m wasting both of our time by being here, doing….this." Draco tells Inferno as he waves his hand between the both of them.
It's officially Harry's last moments in his house, and he's looking around the empty living room. He spots the picture of him and Draco still hung up on the wall. He wants to leave it behind, but he decided to take it with him. He was actually sad to leave, but it was time for him to move on. He took the picture from the wall and put it in the last box that he had near the door before he picked up the box and left his house. He put the box in his car and sped off towards a new life, where new adventures were awaiting for him.
PS: If you ever read my diary Malfoy, just know that you are in big trouble, but nonetheless, I fucking love you Draco and don’t you forget it.
"Isn't she precious?" Harry asks before he hands her Draco before grabbing her small stuffed animal.  "I never thought that having a baby would be so fun, you know?"
"Look! There he is!" Hermione says as Harry completes his U-Turn and starts driving down the street.
"Alright, I'll get back to you guys." Lavender says as she walks away Ron is ready to ask Hermione questions.
"How about our favorite American Idolist’s latest album?" He tells her, putting away his wallet, reaching for his bag.
"Harry's been talking about you a lot." Hermione told Draco. "He's always saying that Tori is cute and that you're hot."
"We'll see." Draco snort as he opens his book. "The last time I was under the mistletoe, I was kissed by my auntie Bella."
"We'll cuddle later if you like, but right now, Tori needs a change." Harry says as Draco leave the kitchen to find a diaper.
"I really don't have to listen to you." Inferno tells him, showing him the door. "Get lost!" He says pushing Draco through the door, slamming the door in his face.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked the blonde as he placed the mug in front of the man. "Do you need to go to the hospital or something?"
Hermione was trying so hard to get Harry’s attention, but she was as baffled as to why he ignored her advances. One night after a long shift at the office during their first year as an official employee at
"Wait! I need to hear this myself, just as soon as I put this chicken in the oven." Ron says from the kitchen.
"I just don't think that he sees me in that way at all.” Harry says dejectedly. “I mean, I know what he’s been through, and I’ve proved to him that he is capable of being in love, admitted that I want to be with him, but I think he’s still scared. I keep hoping that things will change, but I doubt that’ll ever happen.”
"Oh. I was dreaming." He said while he put his hands on his head. "What time is it? And why does my head hurt? Am I late?"
"Anyway, I had a long day full of cases and I got home late, so I ate some spaghetti, drank wine, watched
Still angry about the conversation they had at the party, Draco decides to go strolling in the park, but it turns out to be useless. He decides to go to the GoGo bar and drink his sorrows away.
“Oh, fuck!” Harry moaned in complete happiness as Draco grabbed him by the hips and fucked into him. “Oh, yeah, babe! Fuck me harder! Please, fuck me harder.”
"I usually cook all the time when my friends come over. If i can say that because we all have keys to each other's homes." Harry says before he takes a bite of pasta from his own plate.
"I know that, Draco, but it's the least I can do for tonight. Is it a crime to let me pay for our meal, when I'm giving you the chance to throw me a party without any kind of help at all from yours truly?"
"First of all, I said that you were invited to Hermione's party. I never said that you had to go. No one forced a gun to your head and make you go to the party. Secondly, I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, but I thought that you deserved to hear it from Harry himself. If I had told you the truth about that party, you never would have gone."
He looks up at Draco's sleeping, flushed form and wonders how a man that looks so adorable on the outside can be so dirty and sexual on the inside.
"It could have been amazing if Ron would stop eating." Hermione says as she hits Ron's arm with her book.
“Oh my God, have I been this fucking stupid?!” He angrily asks himself, sitting up on his couch. “Where are my clothes? Shoes? Dammit, where the fuck are my keys?!” He asks himself while he gets off of his couch, running to his bedroom. Fifteen minutes later, he is out the door, determined to find Harry.
"You think that'll work?" Draco asks him sounding skeptical, but with a glimmer of hope in his eyes.
"Is this.... too much? I mean, the Mac and Cheese, German Shepard's pie, Red Velvet Cake, wine and the whole ambiance, is awesome but do you think that it's-"
"Don't cry, little one." Draco said as he got her onesie and her diaper off. "Ready to get cleaned up?"
“Oh well, this serves her right for cheating on her husband.” Draco says harshly as he and Ron leave the OR. “Cheaters get what they deserve and more.”
Every time someone would ask me if you were taken, or would ask me to hook them up with you, I would lie and say that we were together. Don’t ask me why, but it just came out so unexpectedly, and people would back off. I guess that should’ve told me something but I guess it had to take a contract to tell me that what we were looking for was right in front of us (well, right in front of me at least.)
He starts wondering what he's going to do if Harry is actually missing because he can't picture life without Harry at all.
"You're just in time for Brunch and a fucking lobotomy, blondie." Ron answered as he came from the kitchen with a glass of water and some pills. "Do you plan on taking a shower right now?"
