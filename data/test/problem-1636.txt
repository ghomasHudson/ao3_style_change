“Is everything alright with Scorpius?” Harry asked, seeing the tension once again fill Draco’s face and body.
“I hope you feel better”
Albus look taken aback, then mildly troubled. “You don’t need to do that Scorp, if we don’t have anything we can always go back inside.”
“Harry, did you think of something else?” Hermione asked, noticing his sudden lack of appetite.
Ginny cast him strange looks as he became quite flustered while trying to engage the children while they were home for the holidays. Caught off guard by their father's sudden invasive interest in every aspect of their personal lives, the children became quiet and suspicious. They were quick to shift focus on each other, oftentimes revealing embarrassing truths about whoever was the closest target. It caused tensions between all of them to skyrocket, several shouting matching breaking out because of it.
“So good to see you Harry dear, Ginny said she wasn’t sure you’d be able to make it today, but you’re already here aren’t you?” Molly asked, squeezing her arms around Harry.
"Here Potter, if you're going to follow me around all afternoon then you can make yourself useful," Draco said, gently handing Harry a very large Dragonscale briefcase that rattled softly.
“Inside,” Draco managed, flicking his eyes towards the house.
Harry’s eyes flicked out of the room towards the stairs that went up to where he assumed the bedrooms were. “She’s…” he started.
“Thank you Potter,” Draco said quietly, as close to admitting his own personal defeat as he could.
"I have one more stop before we're done, though we're running later than expected so I might have missed him already," Draco said.
“Potter,
Harry shook his head, "I'm really not sure, so far there has been an attacked roughly every three to four weeks. That may be how long it takes them to build the explosives, or just figure out their next targets."
“Seems you have more suspects to look into now, your welcome Potter,” Draco smirked.
“I’m guessing they won’t take the help very easily, will they?” Hermione guessed, a smile on her lips.
"I apologize Malfoy, I didn't mean to insult your wife or son. I just wondered if they may have mentioned the trip out in public where someone could have overheard," Harry explained.
The young man nodded furiously, snatching back the list and practically running from the office as if his heels were on fire. Harry envied his enthusiasm and energy, remembering years ago when he and Ron would practically sprint around the ministry doing their tasks no matter how mundane simply because they felt useful and important. The young Auror who'd just left his office could very surely be up for a nice promotion if his research led to a break in the case, which had always spurred Harry on in the past. Shaking his head of the nostalgia, Harry focused back on his paperwork, determined to get more organized before he had to head back to Malfoy's that evening.
A trip into town was definitely called for and Harry eagerly perused every shop thoroughly during his lunch break. He picked up a book about Quiddich teams around the world, nearly walking into another of the shop’s patrons while skimming through it. Then found a Snitch bookmark that fluttered its wings until you closed the book. Happy with his purchases, Harry bundled them up and had the shop owner wrap them for him before sending them directly off to his own apartment; sending them to Malfoy Manor may raise a few too many eyebrows.
"What the bloody hell is wrong with you two?" Draco demanded.
It was while they were scanning over the required text lists that Albus gave a cry of surprise before darting through the impossibly thick crowd. Third in line at the counter, holding Ron and his spot while the other man carefully maneuvered through the towering piles of books, his arms laden down with more than a dozen texts, Harry couldn’t chase after his son. Thankfully just as Harry began to panic, a tall blonde head was seen bobbing over the crowd and he sighed in relief as Albus squeezed back beside him.

"Have you ever seen it do something like this before?" Harry asked, still trying to keep his voice low.
“We’ll just have to make a point of it won’t we? After all, who’s going to tell the Minister of Magic and the Head of the Auror department they’re not allowed to go home for dinner?” Hermione replied with a haughty sniff.
“Completely depends on the quality and nature of the book and bookmark I suppose. Who are they for?”
Harry nodded, understanding a panic attack when he saw one, no matter how controlled Draco kept himself. “Yeah, definitely not my favorite part. I prefer to come here during the week when it’s a bit quieter.”
Harry swallowed thickly. “I think you deserve a second chance at happiness Malfoy. What you went through at Hogwarts wasn’t your fault and there was no way for you to stop it or change it. Then your parents were sentenced, you were brought up on charges and people who didn’t know you, or your circumstances were deciding your whole future. When I saw you again with Astoria and Scorpius that first time at the Hogwart’s Express, you were smiling, and I was really happy for you Malfoy. You’d managed to find a life and make something of it for yourself. And now, it’s like I can see it falling apart in front of me. I can see you’re hurting, I saw how upset Scorpius was and even though I know it’s not my business I can at least do this for you.”
Hermione moved her chair around next to Harry’s at the table, gently taking his hand in hers and settling her head against his shoulder. “Do you remember all the times you found out some bit of horrible news while we were at school? You’d rush off, hiding under your invisibility cloak and Ron and I would be left standing there having no idea how to help you. I suppose it was easier for me then for Ron, he was always afraid to overstep and make things worse and I just couldn’t stand watching you fall apart. No matter how bad things got Harry we were always right behind you if you ever needed us. You might get pushed away, you might get yelled at to mind your own business, but you’ll still have shown you were there and you cared.”
Draco rapped his knuckles on a small worn, wooden door recessed in the stone wall. It was only four feet tall and to most it would have gone completely unseen; not that this was a bustling street in any case. With a flick of his wand, Harry cast a diversion spell on the entryway of the alley.
Draco looked inquisitively at him, “are you saying you’d take my offer of friendship now?’
Harry was glad for his friends, he enjoyed seeing them so happy. He'd eagerly anticipated being that happy with Ginny when they'd finally decided to make their on-again, off-again relationship permanent with a proposal of marriage. And it was everything he could have hoped for when they actually managed to get their own schedules to mesh. At first Harry had scheduled days off and Ginny had quite a bit of time between training sessions before she was recruited to a semi-professional Quiddich team. Then both began rising through their respective ranks in a rush. Looking back Harry was stunned at how fast it all went, one day they were getting married, then Ginny was coming home to tell him she'd been scouted by the Holyhead Harpies, next he was getting a promotion and they moved out of their tiny one-bedroom flat and that following winter they found out Ginny was pregnant. The next decade continued on in a very similar vein, one major event after another, promotion here, winning the Quiddich Cup there, baby number two and three somewhere in all of that.
“Doesn’t the joke shop all read have a magically expanding one?” Hermione asked, half serious.

“Harry you’re welcome to the guest bathroom of course, we’d better all get a move on if we want to get any shopping done today,” Hermione said pointedly, quickly catching onto the reason for the intrusion on their lazy weekend morning; back to school shopping.
"That's probably what saved you then, you're very lucky Malfoy. The other families had moved since the wars, there were no protections on their homes more complex than a heavy-duty locking spell on their doors. They were caught completely unprepared because they weren't attacked with magic," Harry replied.
Harry had the insane urge to body bind Draco and then levitate him the rest of the way but managed to resist and continue their torturously slow way to the parlor. The lights were still on and Harry flicked his wand towards the fireplace as he deposited Draco onto the couch, wrapping a cashmere throw around his shoulders. Without anything more to do Harry rolled his wand anxiously through his fingers, standing awkwardly next to the couch.
“It was. That’s why… why we I broke up. There were too many secrets. I don’t know… I just wanted it to be
Admirably, Harry thinks, Malfoy’s expression doesn’t change all that much. Fingers squeeze his. Gently.
Emotions flit across Harry’s face… concern… respect… fear… others Draco can’t quite discern… jealousy, maybe. Harry’s eyes are wide, open to him. With a little probing he could probably find out. But he doesn’t.

to say, shallow and pointless as they would be. Instead he says, “Show me your scars.”
Potter looks as though he’s been slapped.
Draco sips the tea… and finds that he can’t answer.
“Hmph,” the woman says. “You had better not. When the Good Lord chooses to use one of his more unusual molds for a person, why that only makes that person even more special.” She pats Harry’s hand again. “Maybe just needing a little bit of extra care sometimes.”
“It was,” Draco says.
“A little. I just wanted to know if he was okay…,” Harry said, his voice small.
“That’s… terrible.” The word seems utterly inadequate, but Draco can’t come up with a better one.

“If you’ve already filled out the form, Mr. Potter, you certainly don’t need to fill it out again.” Smile. “In fact, if Mr. Malfoy, here, can confirm your identity…”
“I wasn’t worried.”
Harry smiles, a shy, tentative smile. “Hi,” he says.
Draco takes a deep breath and drops Harry’s hand, taking a step away. A step towards the water. “They’re probably even right.”
Dolores Umbridge (who for all of the Dark Lord’s reign, was claiming kinship with the ancient pureblood Selwyn family and is now claiming to be Margaret Thatcher’s third cousin, once removed) cleverly turned the idea of—to use the polite term,

“I’m fine,” he had snapped. Those were the last words he said to Harry…
“Don’t be. Please. It’s okay. Don’t be sorry. We’ve got time, Draco. We’ve got all the time in the world.”
Harry consented to a few diagnostic spells… that didn’t turn up any useful information.

“All right. Goodnight, Harry. Malfoy.”
“Draco, please.” Harry is holding out his hand.
Harry does… and he doesn’t. His mouth descends slowly this time, but with no less intensity, his eyes blazing green. It starts slowly, a brush of the lips, then a taste and a nibble, while Harry’s hand… his fingers… make gentle love to Draco’s own hand, while Harry’s other hand caresses Draco’s cheek, until Draco can no longer tell where his body stops and Harry’s begins.

Draco was gone; that much was inescapably clear. The Dark Lord had ruthlessly called Draco to him and the call had gone unanswered. Severus could only hope that Hermione had found the spell needed to dampen the pain. Kreacher was to leave it in a fairly obvious location and Hermione was a smart witch; she would know what would happen to Draco should he ignore the Dark Lord’s summons. It was a supremely difficult spell… but he had complete faith in her.
Somehow his hand is still in Harry’s hair and he uses it to hold him still for a kiss that is as rough as it is tender. “I love you, too,” he says.

There was blood now, but still the boy refused to scream; he just pressed his forehead to the stone that marked his grandfather’s final resting place and waited for the lash to fall.

Harry looks up, meeting Draco’s eyes in the mirror. “No… no…
I’m not sure if he dropped his hand, or if I flinched away from his touch. There is space between us now, and when I meet his eyes, he looks wary. He might be blushing a little.
“How… how long… have I been… away?” Draco asked the elf.
He watches Malfoy, who could not be dissuaded from seeing him safely home, scan the room. “You have a piano?” he asks. “You can play the piano?”

“Be back in this room by seven, Draco.”
Draco concentrates on nothing but Harry… the little gasps he makes, and how he smells of Earl Grey tea and wood shavings and sunshine, and how he fills Draco’s hand, and how the ridges of his cock slide under the pajamas under his palm, and how he arches into Draco with a moan that is at least half sob.

Harry sits back, feeling suddenly and inexplicably better. Malfoy hands him a damp paper towel to wipe his face.
Charlie’s fingers are calloused, rough even, but his touch is gentle as he lifts Harry’s chin, forcing his gaze away from the fire and into aquamarine eyes.
Draco knew he was starving to death; the bowls of food were inadequate. It was all he could manage to eat the bites of food and drink the sips of water that were keeping him alive. More than once, he had simply considered ignoring them… to speed up the inevitable.

“Yes. I filled out the form yesterday,” I say. “But do I need to…”
“Don’t you… want me… like this?” Draco askes, his voice trembling.
Draco opens his mouth and they are kissing… properly. Draco’s free hand tangles in Harry’s hair and he makes little noises, sweet little noises that are halfway between a sigh and a purr as Harry teases his tongue along Draco’s… as he nips gently at his lower lip.

Draco turns a corner and sees a figure making his way—almost unsteadily—towards him.

Potter did would have been better than what he was leaving behind.
Harry looks up at him, his eyes unsure… then trusting. His smile returns and it is sunshine. “Thank you.”
Ron trails off… this time of his own volition. He looks around. There’s not a wine bottle—or for that matter boxes of that crap Muggle Cheesy Mac which Harry eats in place of actual food—in sight.

Harry is an excellent cook, but he hates it. Weasley is a terrible cook, and on his nights he usually suggests that they grab a bite at the pub—something Draco won’t even consider—or he brings home takeaway; Draco is mildly annoyed to find himself enjoying various exotic dishes, purporting to hail from all corners of the globe, out of paper boxes or plastic trays.
It couldn’t hurt more if Draco had picked up a knife and stabbed himself in his own heart.
“Don’t say his name!”

“Let’s go home.”
Kreacher says nothing.
“Thanks, Adelle,” he says drily. “Like I didn’t know.”
Blackness pressed tangibly against his eyes. He shut them. Pain and terror and anguish combined into a gritty sort of exhaustion that held him to the floor.
Harry didn’t expect Lance, dressed in nothing but a pair of boxers, to walk him out. He didn’t expect him to kiss him, long and lingering, on the doorstep.

They trail Bill as he checks room after room—the Ministry has done a good job; nothing dark or horrible remains. The house elves have done a good job, too. The house is immaculate… and even the smells of fear and death and misery are gone.

Harry’s expression softens, though he still looks hurt. “Hey… Draco… it’s okay.”
Without really meaning to, Harry knelt down and put a gentle hand on Malfoy’s shoulder. “Are you all right?” he asked.

to feel this way. You’re allowed to feel upset, hurt… even violated.”
The Sectumsempra scars are barely visible, the faintest spider web of silver across Draco’s chest, but they are sensitive, and Harry knows it. He runs his tongue over the raised flesh… and Draco shivers as Harry follows the line to his hip. “Or even here.”
Beneath the Mark, Draco’s skin is so fine and pale that it is almost translucent. Concentrating on
Minerva McGonagall offered him one of the rooms at Hogwarts, and peace and quiet, while he studied for his NEWTS, while he decided what he wanted to do. He almost accepted that offer.

He shudders.
I’m not going to be able to look her in the eye and tell her, “No,” no matter what it is that she wants to do.
Harry is trembling under him. His hair, black against the white of the pillow case, his eyes wide and green.
“You should still tell someone. My father…”
“Harry Potter

He places another bit of squishy, smelly meat into his hand. A moment later she is back, taking the treat before retreating… not all the way back to the wall this time.
The warmth of the cup makes him realize he is cold.
Harry turns his head, kissing Draco’s palm. “We’d better go,” he says.
the truth.
Harry swallows visibly. “I have some special soap for greasy hands.”
He picks up Harry’s hand, which still smells faintly orangey, even after the cleaning charm, and brings it to his mouth. In proper courtly form, he kisses the backs of Harry’s fingers before turning his hand over to press his lips into his palm.
“I didn’t know Ron was going to do that,” he said. “I shouldn’t have let him.”
He was out of breath and tears were running down his face when he made it to the mat. It could hardly be considered soft, but being off the floor made him feel slightly better. He rested a moment before carefully picking up the pitcher.
so many of the things they have seen… Harry wishes with all his heart that he can think of something… anything… to say to make it better.
“Well, Zabini and Parkinson were never Marked so… Zabini went to the States, New York, I think. But it might have been Boston, or even Chicago. And Parkinson went to live with a great-aunt or something. In Tokyo.”
Draco shuts his eyes. “Yes, Harry, I meant it.” He opens his eyes. “I meant everything I said.”
“It’s in my story. The lonely boy kisses the dragon and the dragon turns into a prince and they live happily ever after.”
His hands are shaking and tears are threatening to overflow his eyes by the time he makes it to the tiny row of tables that runs along the edge of the market. He sits at the first empty one he comes to.
Draco begins shivering in earnest, though he is not sure why; he isn’t really cold anymore. His teeth begin to chatter, though, and Harry holds him tightly, placing a long kiss on his temple.
“It is you,” Harry says, his voice ragged. “It’s really you.”
The idea of hurting Harry makes him feel sick and it is that, even more than Harry half sitting, half collapsing onto the ottoman, his face dropping into his hands, that deflates his anger. “Oh fuck,” Harry says again, his voice little more than a whisper.

“Harry, I am those things.”

Potter’s smile flickers a little, and Draco feels a twinge of something that might be guilt.
“I know.”
Draco is sure he can’t move, but he feels his ribs, his hipbones, pressing into Harry and tries to pull away.
He feels the weight of Malfoy’s fingers on his… feels him pulling his gaze back… up.
Harry’s voice is ragged, starting and stopping with little gasps, and his fingers on Draco’s hip at tighter than he might normally like. Right now he doesn’t mind.

~*~*~*~
The man is also wearing several sickles worth of an astringent-smelling cologne. Harry tugs his arm out of the man’s grip—a feat that requires quite a bit of effort; the motion threatens to disrupt the fragile truce he and his stomach have reached.
“I know what you need…”
Draco mock shuddered at the thought. “I would have off’d myself before second year. I wouldn’t have been caught dead in those hideously garish yellow robes and watching their pathetic Quiddich team is enough to cause a stroke.”
Draco shook his head. “She won’t go, she doesn’t want to be treated like she’s sick and dying and I don’t want to unnecessarily worry her about that.”
“Malfoy? Harry, have you been talking to him about the case? I have a gag order on all the local papers, you can’t discuss this outside of work,” Hermione scolded.
With that, Harry slung an arm around Ron’s shoulders while placing a loud smacking kiss on his cheek at the same moment Hermione captured Ron’s lips with her own.
“Sounds like this is more then just getting back at Voldemort’s followers. The agenda must be more broad, maybe a pure blood cleansing?” Harry replied.
The elusiveness of their previous conversations came back to Harry, though he was still as puzzled as before. “Did you tell them what’s been happening then?”
“You all right then mate? Didn’t see you much at the station earlier,” Ron asked, shucking off his coat.
Draco’s mouth twisted into a sneer. “It’s his last week at home, I wanted to give him some form of normalcy before he left again.”
Draco looked shocked at the admission and silently followed Harry inside. “What would possibly possess you to do something like that?”
Harry lowered his eyes in embarrassment at the mild scolding, realizing he was leaping yo judgments with Mafly once again, only to be proved wrong. He'd tried to make amends after Voldemort's defeat by speaking at Lucius', Narcissus' and Draco's trials. Explaining how he'd witnessed first hand the Dark Lord's manipulation and threats of the entire Malfoy family. As The Saviour Of The Wizarding World, Harry's plea for the Wizengamot's leniency went a long way. Because of his use of unforgivable curses Lucious' life sentence in Azkaban was reduced to 50 years, Narcissus was only sentenced to 10 years as an accomplice after Harry testified that she'd tried to save his life and although Draco lost his wand and was forbidden to ever use magic for the rest of his life, he was spared from spending any time in prison.
"Thank you very much for taking Mr. Malfoy's statement so quickly. I have a few questions of my own for him so if you could transcribe your notes and send them to my office I'll make sure they get looked over and properly filed," Harry added, as the young woman lingered by the table, glancing between the two men.
Pale blue grey eyes flicked up from the parchment he'd been writing on to stare bewildered at Neville whose head was now resting on the table, arms wrapped around him as if trying to hide while his shoulders shook with massive heaves. Harry on the other hand stood next to Neville in silence, his eyes watering, face turning a frightening shade of red as he bit down so hard on his lip that he drew blood.
-Hermione
As was becoming quite usual, Draco’s response to his present came much quicker then Harry had expected it to. He’d read it twice over now while he was finishing his morning cup of coffee. Either Draco was that bored that he’d dove head first into the first distraction possible or the book had truly interested him that much.
"Since I don't get out and socialize much anymore, nobody except Astoria's parents," Draco answered.
Draco set Harry with a very blank look as if explaining something exceedingly simple to a toddler. "By association with the son of Lucius Malfoy, Astoria, unfortunately, doesn't have many friends and Scorpius' only friend is your son. Astoria didn't know anything about the trip until the morning I sent for her parents, who would very much like to forget I exist; and say what you will about Slytherins but no Potter alive or dead would betray someone's family like this."
Draco bit back his response in surprise, eyeing Harry as he stood, hands braced on his dining room table looking much more haggard in the flickering firelight then he did moments ago when he'd entered the room.
That next week what Hermione had said circled around his brain as much as what Draco had. He just couldn’t figure out how to use Hermione’s advice in relation to Draco’s problem. Before Draco had only reached out because he’d insisted on being called in as a bodyguard, now however Harry doubted Draco needed any errands ran. In fact, he wouldn’t be surprised to find Draco sitting in his parlor still staring at the ceiling. Scrubbing his hands furiously through his hair in frustration, Harry sent off a quick note to Hermione.
“’Mione you know those rumors were total rubbish,” Ron insisted.
Draco nodded at the change in topic, the anger dissipating. With nothing more to add he turned away and began walking towards the manor’s rear patio.
Draco urgently yanked his arms free to gently feel the vine tangled with his hair even as Neville pulled him back onto the stool. "My hair! What has it done?"
"I've set perimeter wards to alert me if anyone apparates inside the manor's grounds or uses anything more than basic magic. There is also around the clock Auror guards keeping watch," Harry explained.
“Even if they did change Hermione, could you ever really trust them? If all you knew before were lies?” Harry asked.
Please be advised that some changes to our current situation have arisen and its condition had become increasingly worrisome. Consider taking appropriate steps concerning persons previously discussed as soon as possible. If any additional assistance is required inform me immediately.
The blonde was struck speechless as Harry shoved open the heavy front door of the school and made their way across the sprawling front lawns to the greenhouses. Malfoy had wanted to argue his point with Harry, and had been prepared to throw back in the black haired man's face all the insults, slurs and cutting remarks that had ever been said to him. But as much as he'd wanted to call Harry a liar, especially for that last part, he just couldn't bring himself to do it when he so desperately wanted to believe it was true.
Just as Harry rounded the corner of Malfoy Manor's main gate, the Malfoy family Eagle Owl swooped down, dropping a scrap of parchment at his feet. Stooping down, Harry unfurled the note and read it in confusion. "Come in!" was all that was written in what Harry assumed was Malfoy's rather elegant cursive scrawl. Unsure why Malfoy sent an owl rather then just meet him outside once again, Harry quickly took a brief detour to the manor's front doors.
The tension was slightly broken when the house elf popped into the room once again, a small teacup and saucer in hand for Draco. The man sat up right a little more as it was handed over and Harry figured it was the perfect time to make his excuses to leave.
"Yes, though as for your question on whether or not they learned how to create bombs in the military I can't be so sure of. These parts are cheap, a plastic kitchen timer, household grade wires, it's all available at your local hardware store. This tells me even if they were in the military they're not using miliary grade components, which would be much easier to trace. Also, not every person who joins the military learns how to make and use explosives like these, that's a very specific branch with a limited number of people. Sadly over the years the knowledge has leaked to the public and flooded the internet, nowadays you can learn how to build a bomb from household materials as easily as you can learn how to unclog a toilet," Mr. Denton replied with a rueful shake of his head.
“What are you doing here Malfoy? Shouldn’t you have just ordered Scorpius’ school supplies and had them delivered?” Harry asked, his eyes darting around the shop as he began looking for possible threats.
Neville nearly completely lost his composure then, elbowing Harry in the side as he clamped both his hands over his mouth. "You wouldn't dare," he hissed.
"He should be in Azkaban with the rest of them. Let them all rot!" the man continued, waving his arms in the air in agitation.
Harry bit his tongue, trying to keep his face impassive as he nearly blabbed Hermione's plot. He highly doubted Malfoy would take being used as a pawn to catch the bombers very kindly at all. "We're confident they won't move on until they've finished what they started. If your wards weren't as effective as they were Malfoy there wouldn't be much of the manor left standing. They don't leave anything to chance and this is going to be a major setback for them."
Harry felt the words like a physical blow and was left speechless, unable to come up with an adequate reply before Draco left.
Ron eyed Draco in surprise and gave Harry a look as they exited the bookstore. Harry jerked his head over at Albus who was scouring over his school supply list with Scorpius, getting an answering chuckle from the red head.
His investigation was slowed considerably by Hermione’s constant interruptions. The paperwork was piling up faster then he could get through with it and even with one quill magiked to sign his signature while he physically signed with a second one, he found he couldn’t catch up. Hermione checked in either by owl or personally at least twice a day, sent several notes for errands she needed him to run and had him reporting back on any changes every hour. Most of it was extremely redundant and managed to not only irk him but all his Aurours who he had to keep nagging for updates. Much to Hermione’s frustration no matter how much she pushed and prodded the case was moving along at a snail’s pace. It was mostly a waiting game now, all-possible leads had been followed, suspects checked, double-checked and put under surveillance. The biggest questions now were when and where would the next attack take place.
“Then you’d better read up Potter, because I am not sitting through an entire meal with you if you haven’t the foggiest notion who Amelia Beltrap is at the very least,” Draco replied with a hint of his former haughty attitude.
“They look like you and Malfoy, Harry,” Ron said.
“I thought we were done with all the insults, the back stabbing and lying Malfoy? I thought maybe we had both grown up and could be civilized with each other, but every time I try to be your friend you push me away again,” Harry rebutted, staring at Draco’s retreating back. The anger and frustration were getting the better of Harry, as was usual with Draco, so try as he might he couldn’t resist trotting across the grass to catch up.
“Right, and I should have been a Hufflepuff,” Draco scoffed.
Draco smirked, “no, you were right to call me out Potter; I was an absolute prat. I would have tried to turn you into a flunkie like Crabbe and Goyle and bragged about having The Boy Who Lived as my subordinate. You would have been turned over to the Dark Lord the second he’d been resurrected. We would have lost everything.”
Draco drew in a shuddering breath, the weight of the answer to Harry’s questions like a 10-ton weight in his chest. He wanted the weight gone; it was overwhelming him, crushing his lungs, slowing his heart, making the blood roar in his ears until whatever Harry was saying next was lost. He wasn’t good with pressure like this, he never had been. Keeping his mouth shut about Voldemort’s plans while he lived in their house, plotted the down fall of the entire world, lying to the teacher’s at school, it had nearly been his undoing. Draco felt so weak, his defenses were crumbling and he was panicking. His head was pounding and there were dark spots filling his vision, blotting out Harry’s face but he couldn’t even get his mouth to work anymore.
Eventually the spinning slowed and the nausea Draco had felt abated and he forced himself to look at Harry. Concerned green eyes raked over him continuously and the hand that held his felt like a vice. A shiver of cold wracked his body and Harry hunched closer until Draco could feel him pressed from shoulder to hip along one side of him.
"A Time-turner? Why would she want more classes?” Draco asked in surprise.
“They’re always like that,” James piped up.
“I know it’s only going to be a few days dad and then everything will go back to the way it was, but Scorpius barely wrote me this whole summer. He looked so sad when we first saw them, but he said he was fine,” Albus replied, worry creasing his brows.
Hermione tutted, “You’re still maintaining extra wards around his home? Harry, that’s a waste of magic, you’ll only exhaust yourself. Let the manor’s wards do their job, there was barely a scratch last time; they’ll be fine.”
“It’s not your concern Potter, I’m clearly still in one piece,” Draco insisted.
“Robes,” Scorpius and Albus chorused, both boys giving a grin before leading the way down the street.
"In the parlor Potter," Draco called out as Harry closed the heavy black walnut door behind him.
“Malfoy, I’m so…” Harry began.
"Fine," Draco replied shortly, turning back towards the fireplace and very effectively dismissing Harry.
“That would have been quite the prophecy, he wins by killing my parents, then I win by inadvertently weakening him to the point of death, followed by him killing me before I finally destroyed him. Makes my head hurt thinking about it,” Harry joked.
“Good, I haven’t been alerted to anything either. Hopefully whoever was responsible for the attack has given up. We’re not sure of the motive just yet but Hermione and I believe these recent attacks on the half bloods are the same people. Though they may be a diversion of some sort,” Harry answered.
Deciding to have a quick dinner at home, Harry sat munching on leftover spaghetti while musing over what to write to Draco on the note attached to his gift. Nothing seemed quite sincere enough or it was so over the top flowery it made him want to gag on his fork.
"At least they're paying customers, and yes we can go back to the manor now and hopefully eat whatever it was you bought us for dinner," Draco replied.
“So mum, does that mean we’re not going school shopping then?” Rose asked, causing all three adults to exchange matching looks of confusion.
“Tea please. Do you want anything else Potter?” Draco asked, not even bothering to look up.
"Speak for yourself Potter, I look like I've been struck by lightning," Draco groused, scowling at his reflection in the tray. Strands of his hair stood straight up from the top of his head where the vine was trying to catch it and reattach itself.
There wasn’t much more Harry could add without divulging his conversations with Draco, and he still wasn’t confessing to that. Besides it might be a moot point since Draco was suddenly too busy to be bothered with him anymore and Harry was back to being no more then a bug under his shoe. That didn’t mean Harry wasn’t still worried about a possible attack on the manor again though. He wouldn’t remove his additional wards until he was sure there was no more threat.
"It's alright Miss Witherstrom, I can take the rest of Mr. Malfoy's statement," Harry interrupted, striding purposefully towards the young woman with a smile.
“Ron, while I appreciate the thought you know I could be called back into the office at any moment, and so could Harry,” Hermione said, gesturing towards the unopened bottle in her husband’s hand.
“Yes, of course, wouldn’t miss it for the world,” Harry replied, shooting Ginny a confused look, which she promptly ignored.
Harry huffed and rolled his eyes as he finally managed to catch up, turning their trolley around and snagging Scorpius’ luggage to pile on top.
“Well, you could have accepted Malfoy’s gesture of friendship and gone and joined the illustrious house of Slytherin and become a toady for Umbridge,” Hermione snickered,
"Mr. Malfoy, good to see you again. Oh my, Mr. Potter, to what do I owe the pleasure?" Madam Pomfry greeted, taken aback at seeing two of her more common patients during their years at Hogwarts stepping through her fireplace together.
“Without using the word ‘fine’, tell me, was Scorpius okay today at the station?” Harry asked seriously, his voice low and even.
“Fine Potter, just a bit crowded for my tastes. I prefer not to be elbowed unnecessarily,” Draco replied, purposefully forcing his hands to relax.
At Draco's raised eyebrow Harry explained, "Just in case anyone from the mob feels like following us."
Harry hurriedly took the excuse to escape before he was forced into any awkward small talk with Ginny or Molly. He was surprised that Ginny hadn’t told him about today as he’d always looked forward to helping their children get reading for an upcoming year at Hogwarts. They hadn’t spoken much over the summer however and Harry figured this was simply one of those things he’d start to miss out on now that he and Ginny no longer lived together.
“Yeah Ron, just thought I’d say hi,” Harry replied, giving Hermione’s hand a squeeze.
Draco's eyebrows quirked up, "You really think you'll catch them in a few days then?"
Red rimmed, blood shot eyes met Harry’s and the man barely kept from wincing at the raw pain he saw reflected in those stormy grey iris’. Malfoy was stronger then anyone gave him credit for, and it amazed Harry how many times he had managed to scrape himself off the ground and stand proud after all these years. How much more could the universe possibly ask of them until they were so broken there wasn’t enough to put back together? Harry sincerely hoped he would never find out, Draco may not be his favorite person in the world most of the time, but it was painful to watch him suffer and he was quickly getting tired of it.
“Well, I’m glad to see you didn’t break our vault stores entirely this time. Did you happen to pick up anything for your sister?” Harry asked, causing both boys eyes to widen in realization. James and Albus began frantically rifling through their bags for something suitable.
“I thought you didn’t want to drink last night,” Harry teased, earning a minute scowl from Hermione.
Harry leaned back, letting his headrest atop Hermione’s. “Yeah, I know I’ve said it before but I don’t know how I would have gotten through first year without you and Ron, let alone graduation.”
Within another ten minutes Ron and the boys all trooped out, bags full of tricks and treats hanging off their arms. The minute Scorpius spotted his father his face split into an excited grin and he hurried over to show off all his purchases. Draco straightened, seemed to completely shake off his paralysis before turning his complete attention to the rapidly speaking boy with a slight smile. The transformation softened all the harsh lines along Draco’s face and Harry’s attention was frozen until James and Albus started clamoring for him.
“You’re right, I do know more then anyone else about what really happened. At least I know what I saw; I know the rumors that were going around school and the visions Voldemort was sending me. What I don’t know Malfoy is what you were going through. I always assumed you wanted to be a Death Eater, that you supported Voldemort just like your parents,” Harry replied.
“Flowers are always nice”
“No magical item could have predicted how your fight with the Dark Lord was going to end. For all intents and purposes you were dead, then you came back to life. So if you want to split hairs he actually won for a minute,” Draco replied.
After a bit of strained silence Harry cleared his throat, “I know you’re getting pressure from people for answers regarding these attacks on the pure blood families Hermione. Like Ron said earlier, I know you’re stressed, but lately it seems as though I’m just another errand boy to you. You’re not even listening to my suggestions anymore and instead have completely taken control of the Aurours. You’ve cut me out of everything in my own department, I have to ask you for updates now.”
"Harry listen, you said it yourself the manor is nearly as heavily warded as Hogwarts and unless they use magic we have no way of tracking them and they've never failed before. They must be getting overconfident by now, these have been brutal attacks that have killed not only previous supporters of the Dark Lord but innocent women and children. They're not going to let Malfoy ruin their perfect track record," Hermione replied.
“Malfoy, are you alright?” Harry asked worriedly.
Harry remembered those first few years with a wry chuckle. He and Ron had been nearly living at the ministry while starting as Aurors and Hermione had been bouncing around between several jobs, trying to figure out which one she liked best. It was two years into being an Auror when Ron had shambled into their shared office looking exhausted and grim. He'd sadly announced he couldn't do it anymore, that he'd been fooling himself this whole time and there was no way he was cut out for this line of work. He continued explaining how Hermione and he had gotten into several terrible rows these past few weeks over it all and she was threatening to end their courtship. Harry who'd barely managed four hours of solid sleep the night before stared blankly at him in shock. Ron had then broken down, tears flowing unchecked as he'd begged Harry not to be mad or disappointed with him. Of course, Harry hadn't been either of those things, more concerned that Ron was so distraught he looked ill as his best friend crumpled into a chair hiccuping and stammering his explanation. Ron had never really told Harry how much his support then had meant to him and how relieved he'd been when Harry had solemnly promised that he'd help him save his relationship with Hermione no matter what.
Harry was seriously torn between fleeing this house and chalking today up to some weird fluke that he could hopefully forget over a glass of Fire Whiskey and stepping back into the parlor. Draco was clearly not well by any stretch of the imagination and his fall earlier had set Harry on high alert. He was probably going to regret this tomorrow, Draco would verbally flay him alive for pushing and never allow him within eyesight ever again.

Normally, he thinks coffee shop normally smells amazing… bitter coffee and behind that sweetness—chocolate, of course, and vanilla, hazelnut, and raspberry—all held together with steamed milk. There is a gentle medley of perfume and cologne carried in and out by the patrons, the constant note being the spicy jasmine scent his boss, Adelle, wears. Then, subtle and almost unnoticeable, is the books—all used, littering the coffee tables and jammed on a rickety bookshelf, just waiting to be read again—with tastes of cigarette smoke and sunshine hidden between their covers.

“Is there… is there anything else you need?” Potter’s voice startles him.
“Yes.” He forces his fingers to let go of the grapefruit and pick up another.
Potter regards him curiously, but takes the rinsed dishes, dries them, and puts them away without comment.
To Draco’s surprise, Harry is less than thrilled.

would be the plus-one, the one that is only invited for the sake of politeness.
“You almost did.”
Her eyes narrow further. “Don’t you have a question to ask me?”
Draco’s nodding… asking a question… nodding again.
“Not to panic, dear, but a trans boy… anyone with a uterus… can get pregnant if they’re not careful.”
“I like that, too,” Draco says. Softly.
They’d stayed on the mountain last Christmas.
And Draco is left, empty and alone, in the passageway that leads to his bedroom.
I wipe the jam off her face before letting her Floo away with Draco.
“You, Harry Potter, are wearing far too many clothes,” he says with a slight smirk.
“Everyone leaves.”
He finishes with even less warning than he began and the sudden loss of Potter’s grip, bruising as it was, causes Draco to fall… onto the pavement.
Ron tries again, not shouting. “Look, Kreacher, I don’t know what Harry told you, but he needs—”
Of course,
“But you can’t go anywhere! I
“Oh. I… yes… I would like that.” The moment lengthens. “Harry,” he whispers.
“I hurt you, and I’m sorry for it.”

Harry nods slowly.

Black. Bitter.
Draco feels a great gasping sob being ripped from him… he can’t contain it and he can’t control it and he feels himself falling forward without even the energy to stop himself.

of people trying to kill me.” He sounds defensive.
“Dinner won’t be ready for a couple of hours,” Potter is saying. “I didn’t know if you’d want to sleep… or read, maybe?”
Malfoy laughs a little laugh. “Anytime.”
A brown bottle flew into Harry’s hand. He looked up, searching grey eyes for permission, and Malfoy, looking so desperately fragile, nodded.
“Yeah… I… Look, I’ll get you some clean towels. Don’t worry.”
“I know that dream,” I say softly, carding my fingers through his hair. His hair is thick and heavy, but so very soft. Even though it looks it, it’s never tangled, and my fingers slide easily through the curls. “You always come for me.”
“Oh… Okay.” She is still looking at me, her eyes now wary. “Do you even know how to take care of me?”
“He told me,” Draco said.
“I work.” If there’s one thing Draco
He runs his fingers over the scar from the spatula, and turns him, pressing kisses over his shoulder… over the burn from the frying pan.
“Hello, Potter.” Draco’s voice comes from somewhere behind my right shoulder. He is using the drawling tone he used as a Hogwarts prefect and…

“I… thank you for dinner. And a place to sleep tonight. I’ll leave in the morning.”

.  His words make him want to vomit… he says them anyway.
“We’d have to get a bunch more books, though. Kids’ books. Hermione’ll have ideas, and so will my mom. She loved to read to us… when she could get us all to sit still. Which wasn’t very often.”
Harry has opened his eyes and is watching him closely.
saying what I think you’re saying… are you?”
“Nothing.”
Draco hissed and black spots were speckling his vision before he was done, but he managed to wash off the blood and the filth from being imprisoned for… he still didn’t know for how long. He slipped on grey slacks that had once fit him perfectly and were now threatening to slip off his hips. The touch of his shirt hurt. Ignoring this, he did up the buttons. He was somewhat surprised to find that his wand was lying on the nightstand and used it to dry his hair.
“I want to go home,” Draco says, his voice so small he can barely hear it.
… But I can’t feel… It doesn’t
~*~*~*~
“Yeah. You don’t mind?”
Draco pulls his leg out from under Harry’s… and immediately wishes he hadn’t as blood, wielding pins and needles, flows back into his leg. He stands up anyway, tugging on Harry’s arm.
He doesn’t. He just gives Harry a long look before climbing in beside him. Harry reaches out a hand, catching Draco’s, interlacing their fingers.
from the shower, Potter.” Draco can feel his mouth twisting into a smile that is more than half smirk. “And I’m not entirely sure that it wouldn’t be pointless.”
Potter looks up at him, fear and an aching trust clash in his eyes. Draco lowers his mouth.
A lubrication charm… then a finger… carefully.
“I think so.”
Hermione calls it “what if” history… and says there’s no real point to it. She always touches the inside of her forearm when she says it, though; it’s barely visible anymore… where his aunt carved the word “mudblood” into her arm. What if he had done something—anything—
It’s been five days.
“Now, I’ll just need you to fill out this form, and then I’ll call for Miss Weasley. We’re near the end of our day, so you can take her straight from here… save the confusion of the regular dismissal time.”
“Always. To share?”
Draco almost doesn’t care. Whatever else, he is not leaving this dog trapped between white, windowless walls.
Draco’s throat tightens, but he cannot tell if it’s Elladora’s silencing curse working on him, or if it simply the natural response to unshed tears and unsaid words.
“Who were you dreaming about tonight—or shouldn’t I ask?”
She took a few deep breaths, leaning half on Weasley, half against the table. “Better?”

Harry just holds him tighter, his face buried in Draco’s neck. When Harry breaks free, Draco’s shirt is damp. Harry palms the tears off his cheeks. “Are you still going to work for Mr. Ainsworth?” he asks, tentatively. Hesitantly.

Three days. Seven clients.
“I did, as a matter of fact,” Draco says. Victoire is not an impolite child, and she is utterly silent as he responds. It is a relief to hear his deeper voice. “Miss Harding told me. She says you’ve been working very hard.”
Draco uses his tongue to trace each of Harry’s fingers, sucking each one into his mouth before moving on to the next. “I love you, Harry Potter,” he says.
Severus shouldn’t have said it. And he honestly hadn’t thought Draco could go any paler; every last drop of color slipped from his face.
“Sometimes it’s like I can’t believe it’s really over. I can’t believe
Draco nods again.
He wants to kiss it. But he’s trapped under Draco’s arm… and doesn’t want to wake him.
scream was the only thing I had left. I know… that doesn’t make any sense…”
“I’m so sorry, Harry…”
“Of course not. I don’t hate Muggles, Potter. And if I ever did… I was wrong. But…it just seems like it would be hard to be with a Muggle… always having to hide who you are.”
to you? I mean… you must have done accidental magic sometimes, and that was probably kind of scary for someone who had never seen anything… And I just want to know if they treated you… I don’t know…” Draco finds himself speaking very quickly, his words starting to tumble over one another. He takes a deep breath. “I just want to know… if they were kind…”
“Y-yes… yes…”
As the notes drift from violent to exquisite, wisps of oxygen begin to find their way back into Harry’s lungs. He watches Malfoy take a deep breath. He feels a tear drip off his cheek and splash down onto his collarbone.
“Don’t you…
Harry falls silent. And Draco remembers how he used to think Harry constantly sought out attention… how jealous he had been… how he used to relentlessly tease Harry.

it. I promise.”
Draco knows he’s damn good at his job… but he can’t seem to go more than a day or two without doing something utterly heroic to prove it.
“Harry… when you say you couldn’t eat dinner…?”
He’s not even sure Harry’s still awake… until he feels the brush of an illumination charm and the room glows softly. It’s enough to make out Harry’s features, beautiful and worried, but not much else.
“He’s not a Death Eater and he’s not bothering me,” Harry says as firmly as possible under the circumstances.
I’m not much in the praying department, but I string together a few prayerful-sounding words for Fleur’s parents and send them heavenward, as walk through the gate and approach the door.
The screams changed to sobs… great wracking sobs, and Draco found himself clinging to those arms like a lifeline. The arms wrapped around him, holding him tight.
“Yes… but… what…? A Blood Quill made those marks.”
Hermione kisses his cheek. Hugo, holding his mother’s hand, regards him solemnly. Rose is all bounce and giggles; generally if Hugo wants something said, he simply waits until his sister says it.

“He’s still a git, though,” Ron says, ignoring Kreacher’s frown. “Look, when Harry… when
Draco lets out a soft sob and Harry just holds him, running gentle fingers across his back. When he pulls back a little, Draco isn’t shaking quite so badly. He reaches up to trace Harry’s cheek. “I won’t let go either, Harry.”
“That, Potter, is entirely up to you.”
“You’re right… I--” He’s cut off by the arrival of the house elf carrying a tray of sandwiches. Sandwiches that are warm and smell delightfully meaty and cheesy.
Until that moment I had

He’s like one of the wounded dragons Charlie nurses back to health before returning them to the wild. The thought is mildly embarrassing, but Harry can’t find it within himself to feel anything but grateful.
“Please! Please, don’t hurt me!” Malfoy’s wand clattered onto the flagstones and he pushed it away. Deftly, Ron pocketed it.
The Dark Lord does not leave his rooms until late morning and breakfast table conversations are refreshingly light: his mother and Antonin Dolohov are at the far end of the table discussing roses, and Antonie Pucey, his uncle Rodolphus, and a few others are discussing the favorites for the Quidditch World Cup.

I don’t mind.
Harry feels his heart swelling…
“Not really. They ache a bit with the cold sometimes.”
“Harry? Was there something else you wanted?” Draco asks. It comes out breathy.
I wait a few more minutes before the still-perfectly-braided Victoire bounces up to me. “Uncle Harry!”
“It’s okay. You don’t have to be okay.” He’s holding Harry’s hand, but also his eyes. “Do you want to tell me about Halloween?”

different if he had survived the War.
. You could never be. And I’m coming back after class.” And, almost as if he knows Harry is opening his mouth to object, he adds, “I’ll play for you.”
Potter turns and pulls a set of fluffy white towels out of a cupboard. “The bathroom’s just here,” he says, pressing a switch and illuminating a tidy room with a white-tiled shower. “I’ll leave some things on the bed for you. Don’t mind the cat; she’s friendly. Her name’s Athena. Take your time and come down when you’re ready.”

She smoothed a handkerchief out on the ironing board. It was the palest blue and had a large “D” embroidered in one corner.

all his major arteries. Hermione thought it was a miracle; Ron didn’t think it sounded like a miracle—he thought it sounded like magic.
Harry is dreaming… about the coffee shop. About Draco Malfoy. About Adelle and her perfume which is sharp and cloying and circling around his head like something out of the cartoons he used to watch, peering over Dudley’s shoulder, pretending to be cleaning, when he was young.
“It’s fine,” Draco says, nearly certain that it is. He is prefers to stay within the confines of his own little sphere—basically the coffee shop, the market, and the occasional walk to the park with Harry. But a bookshop… his eagerness to see that wonder easily overcomes the lingering misgivings he sometimes has about going somewhere new. “A

“Me too.” He
And the feel of those fingers on his back, erasing pain he didn’t even know he still carried…. Potter blinked and part of Draco wanted to just lean forward and kiss him. If those fingers could bring relief to those cuts on his back… what else could they heal?

Physically, he’s almost the exact opposite of Professor Dumbledore… yet the similarity in tone and sentiment sends an actual ache straight through my heart.

I try to ignore the fact that my house is a mess. I’ve turned the formal dining room into a studio—I like the natural light from the large front windows, and it’s convenient to the kiln I installed in the basement. And I really only want to eat in the kitchen… and be reminded of the meals I shared there with Sirius… and Remus, Tonks, Mad-Eye. Everyone, really. It was like we were one big family.

“I’ll be fine,” Harry whispers. “I don’t want to be a bother.”
The Dark Lord is holding court in the drawing room and there are Death Eaters in the hall… loud and vulgar and, frankly, terrifying, but if Draco slips out of the drawing room through his mother’s parlor, and then up the back staircases, there are only three dark passageways between him and the safety of his bedroom.
“Harry…”
“He. Knows. I. Left.” Draco said, rather unnecessarily, struggling to breathe, struggling to not scream.
“Dunno… half-five, maybe? Most people are at dinner.”
Draco pushes open the door and steps into the common room.
Sometimes I fall.

The shopkeeper chuckles gently. “Fiction is down here. Non-fiction is upstairs. I’ll be right here if you need me, boys.”
Four doors lead off the landing: two are shut tight, another is open, revealing an unmade bed and heaps of dirty laundry, and the final, also open, is a large, grubby bath.
Polyjuice Potion burns going down… and then he waits as his bones grow or shrink, as his features change, molding themselves into the features his client wants.
Halfway down the stairs, Draco stops. “Did you

I would pass out under the invisibility cloak sometimes, causing something of a panic. Hermione worried. Ron yelled. Ginny and I broke up.

The elf had a point.
“You have one. It’s right here. Will you play some more?”
An old piano stands along one wall, currently supporting Harry’s meager library. According to his landlady, someone left it behind ages ago. The flat is four floors up—it’s stayed.
Draco didn’t respond. He just pressed his face further into the bed and held on. He tried to remember to breathe.
Harry has a routine… dogs he walks, plays fetch with, grooms. Draco is following Harry, holding a leash and a pocketful of dog treats, when he sees her—a Border Collie, at least in part, and so black that she is not so much a color, but the absolute absence of color. She has a small patch of white on her chest… and it’s the only proof he has that she’s anything more than a shadow, crouched and quivering at the far back of her kennel.
“I’m home,” he says.
“Draco… I…”
“Fine… thanks,” Harry says, tightening his grip slightly before stepping out from behind Draco to accept the mug Weasley is holding out for him. He takes a sip, wrinkles his nose, and stirs in a heaping spoonful of sugar, ruining the perfect foam.
“Orphans, really. The Dark… Vol-… oh,
Harry tries to hide his wince, his sigh of pain. He fails.

all his fears and misgivings.
“I will not be kept like some sort of a pet, Harry,” Draco says gently, more to soothe the dog than to soothe Harry, whom he would really prefer to shout at. Or possibly hit.
The shadows in the library are thick… his illumination charm must be wearing off… but when Harry raises his head he can see Harry’s eyes, bright and green and brimming with tears. He looks so young. Maybe even younger than the first time they kissed. “I
Draco looks at Harry’s hand, still in his own. The cuts aren’t so much as bleeding, but glaring up at him, looking red and angry. He whispers a spell meant to cool and soothe. Nothing but time will heal a Blood Quill’s cuts… but it should help.
I just didn’t know how to get it. I still don’t.
Not like a hangover. Not like the stomach flu. But an undercurrent of nausea that drags at him, turning him away from his favorite smells.
“True,” Granger agrees. “But they don’t owe her a ridiculous sum of money. They have set hours, access to healing potions, even the ability to refuse clients. And they can talk. Not to their clients, apparently, but to each other. And me.”
to be.
“It’s not what you’re thinking, Malfoy,” Weasley says slowly. He picks up his own coffee, studiously tracing the rim of his mug, watching his finger and not Draco, as he continues. “You need to understand… Harry was… in a bad way… after the war. After you left. ‘Course we didn’t know that part… But he had nightmares… he drank too much… he failed his psych evaluation for Auror training.

He is fed, he is clothed, and the light that comes into his cell is natural and tinted with salt and seaweed. His guards are human and they are not unkind.
“I asked Kreacher to sort out of some of Regulus’s old things for you. I thought they might be more comfortable for you than….”
“So what is a suitable occupation for a Malfoy?” he asks instead.
Draco likes.
The little kennels they keep the dogs in are eerily similar to the white, windowless room Elladora kept him in… save that, in the top half of the doors, there are small, bared windows.

“We’re all set.” The voice is hard and sounds familiar, but Draco can’t be bothered to place it.
“We’ll figure it out. If you won’t go to St. Mungo’s, will you at least go to a Muggle doctor? I can take you to the office I’m working at this month. Maybe… I don’t know… maybe you have an underlying infection. Maybe even from this.” Draco picks up his hand, running his fingers over the completely healed cut. “I checked you for everything I can think of… but maybe I missed something… maybe a blood test…”
“Harry…”
He tastes of wine… of unhappiness… and he makes a small noise, opening his mouth for Draco to deepen the kiss.
“No, it’s not. I
Draco finds the truth before he answers… and he can feel his boundaries shift, his fears slip away.
If Jamaica somehow manages it, though... Blaise will be thrilled; he has a special place in his heart for the country his mother still calls home.
In the end, though, it was Charlie Weasley’s invitation to Romania that had him packing his things, leaving a note for Ron and Hermione, and disappearing without a trace.
“I didn’t. But I would have. I would have said…
“I know that you aren’t, Draco. Whatever else, I know that you love me.”
“You’re all right, Draco,” Granger says. “Do you want me to open the window?”
“You’re all right, Malfoy,” Weasley says. “You’re at Harry’s house—Grimmauld Place… used to belong to the Blacks. You may have been here before, actually.”
“I’m not doubting that.” She pats his hand gently. Her knuckles are swollen with arthritis, but her manicure is subdued and perfect. The diamond on her ring is one of the ones that could feed a small country. “But I watched my mother go through three pregnancies and my sisters have had sixteen between them. I, myself, have been pregnant five times, and now I have three grandchildren and twenty-eight great-nieces and –nephews. I am not usually wrong when it comes to noticing when someone is expecting.”
Well, maybe not…
“You survived it, Draco,” Harry says at last. “You walked out of there.”

“Oh. Right.” Her eyes narrow.
It’s not meant to be permanent, though.

“Hey…” Lance’s fingers lift his chin a little. “I had a great time last night.”
Draco wonders what in hell Potter’s done with his house elf… “Where’s Kreacher?” he asks abruptly, still holding the wall for support.
“This.” Harry pushes back against Charlie until his arms tighten. “Yes, this. When you’re sucking me, you’re too far away. I want to be held.”
Harry feels the surreptitious touch of Malfoy’s wand, then the cold trickle of a disinfecting charm, then a pinch, then… nothing.
“Fuck,” Potter says. “Let me… let me do something to heal you.”
And where Potter’s mouth… lips… tongue touch his.
My hands are still shaking. The door is also flanked by roses.
"It's every place in the last 10 years that some sort of explosion or suspicious fire started in what used to be thought of as an abandoned building that clearly wasn't after they inspected it. Some of those are pretty far away, but we don't even know if the person is a local or not so they could have relocated during or after the wars which is why I included them. However these are only the ones reported to the ministry, if this person really is muggle-born or a squib I suppose there'd be more reports by the muggle authorities that we don't know about," the young man explained quickly, his face switching from proud to anxiously nervous as he finished.
“Maybe I can find out if I can get copies of any of their previous games. Being the Head of the Auror department does have its perks, like knowing the head of every magical department in the Ministry; several of which owe me favors,” Harry grinned.
“Malfoy…” Harry protested, reaching out and laying his hand on the man’s forearm.
“No, Astoria has appointments she can’t miss that have been scheduled for months now,” Draco insisted.
Harry was momentarily taken aback by the question. “I don’t think I’m very optimistic at all actually. I just can’t sit still while someone hurts innocent people. I don’t know I’ll always win, but I figure if I have the power to help I should at least try my best.”
The Head Aurour's smile dropped as he turned to face Mr. Malfoy just as the other man's lip curled up into a sneer. Nadine slowly and quietly backed out of the room, clutching her notebook to her chest. She was not a stupid woman, she had top marks all through school to prove it and in this instance knew without a shadow of a doubt that pushing to stay and continue interviewing Mr. Malfoy was not a good nor smart idea.
"Not satisfied I'm being watched closely enough Potter? Come to personally babysit me?" Draco asked snidely.
Harry was soon bombarded by familiar faces as Ron pulled him over to be greeted by Fred, Angelina, Lee and a host of other Hogwarts alumni who had been similarly dragged in by their kids. Soon enough James was at his side begging to buy several of the newest items he’d found with Hugo, Albus and Scorpius in his wake. Seeing the blonde, Harry’s head snapped around looking for the boy’s father.
"From who? Nobody has the authority to override my orders," Harry asked.
Draco's eyes flitted nervously around his backyard, the shadows lengthening as the sun set over the horizon. Harry could practically feel the goosebumps that erupted down the back of the blonde's neck as he wrapped his arms around his torso like a shield, hunching slightly into his sweater.
“Well, that certainly would have changed a few things,” Draco muttered.
Harry moved a step closer, right below where Draco stood looking so tense he almost expected something to snap. Draco’s already pale face was almost bleached white, his eyes blown wide and his throat swallowing convulsively. If Harry didn’t know any better he’d say Draco looked scared, but of what?
“We should really plan some more Friday dinner’s now that the kids are at school again. Harry and I only see each other at work, and heaven’s knows when you two get breaks,” Hermione suggested, earning twin nods from them both.
“I don’t think Harry means to ignore them Hermione, but it sounds like they’re building up to something. Maybe they have a final target in mind and if you’ve already got them under watch then I’d keep an eye out ‘cause they’re bound to strike again if they get an opportunity,” Ron said.
“Up,” Draco croaked, flinging his other hand toward Harry.
The rest of the week was a flurry of activity, between his usual work routine and helping Ginny prepare the kids for their upcoming school year, the trip to the train station came alarmingly fast. Albus hadn’t said anything more about his concern over Scorpis, however it was evident his worry was steadily increasing as his letter to his friend never received a reply that week.
Neville looked up at Harry in confusion, not sure where his friend was going with this. "Yes Harry, it seems to always go towards any patches of sun it can find, why?"
-Harry
Harry felt his stomach drop to his toes, his throat closing up as chill washed over him at the admission. He slid bonelessly back into the couch beside Draco, the man turning his face away as his control faltered. Harry placed a hand gently on Draco’s shoulder, unable to say or do anything but stare silently at the mantle. It was no wonder Draco had been a prat lately, he was pretty sure news like that would have sent Harry into near catatonia, let alone what it’d do to his kids.
Harry nodded, “keep the kids with you, I’ll go take a look. He probably just stepped outside.”
“Hermione? I thought you were Head Auror? Why’s the Minister of Magic calling the shots, doesn’t she trust you to do your job? Or does she always stick her nose in everybody’s business?” Draco scoffed.
Neville led Draco deeper into the greenhouse, pointing out several plants along the way. Harry had never seen Draco interact with any of their old Hogwarts school mates since they'd graduated and was quite bemused by the entire phenomenon. There were no more outbursts from Draco, instead he and Neville bent over a parchment for nearly an hour writing down plant names and tossing information back and forth quite companionably.
“Fancy a game sometime?”
Harry relaxed a bit, he hadn’t doubted his purchases when he’d made them but as the day wore on he began to wonder a bit. If anyone was the leading authority on books it would be Hermione, and she certainly was better at social etiquette and more formal traditions then Harry. A few pointed questions were much easier to deal with from her then the possible humiliation at Draco’s hands if he loused this up.
Using his wand as a stylus, Harry scrolled over to his Inbox, the Owl symbol had a little number one next to it. Clicking on it embarrassingly fast, Harry was more than relieved to see that it was from SN7 at Owl-Mail and not a junk message. Heart beating suspiciously fast, Harry found himself grinning from the very offset of his PenPal’s missive.
Kenny tried to surpress the icy anger that burned from within at all his friend had told him, and what he knew must have been omitted from the account. It wasn’t fair. He knew realistically that Butters wasn’t an angel, but he was pretty damn close. And Kenny would stop at nothing to protect him.
“-It’s fine Potter. I wouldn’t deserve you anyway. Let’s talk about less maudlin things.” Draco flashed a brief smile to reassure Harry.
Besides, right now his shop needed him. He had been horrified to learn that his profits had been down from this time last year. It seemed that Malfoy’s store had seduced some of his custom with their cheap knock off branded brooms, some mass produced crap that had been churned out with little care to quality. Goodness, even the staff that worked at Quidditch Direct had no soul; it was all buy our stock and then leave. No chatting, no banter and no family focussed care. Why would people put convenience over quality? Harry didn’t understand, and if he didn’t act soon he’d risk losing the store he held so dear.
Harry honestly wasn’t sure if he’d ever laughed so hard. Malfoy, when not being a prize git, was actually pretty funny. During the sampling of the tea he had begun some of his favourite impressions of their teachers from Hogwarts.
“I’m pretty sure they wear chequered shirts and jeans in North America.” Harry added with unconcealed smugness. He couldn’t wait to see Draco’s face when he took him to a Walmart.
Astoria had found it shocking that Draco wasn’t crowing his victory. The person she’d known would have been utterly gleeful at thwarting Potter. When she said as much, Draco could only sigh as they made their way home after a tiring shopping trip in muggle London.
“You ready to meet Mr Wonderful?” Draco smirked when Harry opened the door. He’d asked for him to come around the morning of the date so that he wouldn’t have to stew with his nerves alone.
A dark shadow fell across his table. Harry’s eyes were drawn upwards, reluctantly, till they met the startling silver grey of his once arch nemesis. The blonde git smirked before raising an eyebrow in greeting.
people on names? Malfoy? Draco Malfoy?” Harry smirked, loving the anger that flickered in the blonde’s eyes.
Harry kept his eyes on the road, the landscape was becoming much more hilly and snow covered as they drove further up in altitude, as he muttered under his breath.
Having worked himself up into a quiet but fretful rage, Harry struggled to sleep. He prowled the WWWW on his W-book to aid distraction, but nothing prevailed. Checking his WOL account his heart leapt, he’d received another message from SN7 within the last few hours. Perfect. His PenPal was clearly attuned to when Harry needed him to revive his mood.
before adding rather petulantly, “Can’t we just apparate into South Park? Or at least floo?”
Potter would Draco thought to himself, remembering how it felt to be clung to the saviour, arms wrapped tightly around muscles as they flew high above searing flames. He shuddered at the memory as it licked warmth to his present and he knew without a doubt that he had his answer. Potter, or at least Quidditchboy, understood him, Potter had always managed to get under his skin, inciting a whirlpool of feelings that he’d struggled to suppress while at Hogwarts. Draco knew that he’d been more than attached to Quidditchboy and therefore Potter by default. The trouble was, how was he to get Potter to give him a chance?
“Erm… will our wands be okay?” Harry ventured in confusion. Kingsley hadn’t briefed that in the protocols, but it made sense with how easily polyjuice could be used. The problem was, while Harry had his driving licence, Draco probably didn’t even have a birth certificate to his name.
“It’s what I live for.” Harry agreed sagely, surprised at the playful tone the conversation had embodied.
Harry’s heart thudded painfully in his chest as those molten eyes pinned him with a sincere and thrilling focus. “Why?” Was the only thing he asked.
Upon it she saw several ‘exclusive’ article headings that made her snort in amusement:
The blonde waited anxiously for his owl’s return. He hoped that Potter would agree. He’d schemed for ages a way to get the other wizard’s attention and fell back on traditional English past times. He could only hope it would be enough and that Potter wouldn’t take offence to his gift of tea.
“I don’t doubt it.” Draco got up and poured whisky for them both, his upbringing ensuring that the correct hosting etiquette would always be met. “And are you mad also?”
“That’s awfully kind of you Ken.” Butters gave him a megawatt smile, grateful to have his friend. “But to be honest, that’ll just make my dad more angry. It’s best to just leave him and he’ll forgive me for whatever bad thing I’ve done now.”
“So how does this work?” Curiosity beckoned and he did want to know how Malfoy’s snobbish tea would actually be superior.
done with all the weird, life threatening catastrophes that went down in South Park. He had thought that by the time they made it out of elementary school, that things would have calmed down. And it did, for a while. This year though, this year had been the worst. And Kyle could just not deal with it any longer. It was his senior year and he had finals to study for and a damn crush on his best friend to get over. He didn’t need to be dealing with serial killer puppets or town wide orgies. Shudders. He still had post traumatic stress from that last one, and a lot of images that even alcohol couldn’t blot out.
“Oh.. erm.. Eric. Kenny and I aren’t.. you know.. doing that sort of stuff.” Butters blushed adorably as he spluttered about the sexual stuff. Kenny was just his friend, unfortunately.
“No polyjuice?” Blaise asked in greeting after watching his friend with an arched brow stroll elegantly towards him. Draco was clearly, though not visibly to the untrained observer, nervous about the meeting. He’d obviously spent ages on his outfit, before settling on the dove grey pants with a white shirt that suited him perfectly. It was smart enough without trying too hard.
“Oh lighten up Draco, people were bound to find out you owned the stores eventually, Rita would have scooped it at some point.” Astoria tried to placate her boyfriend.
“Are you sure you’re okay Leo? I can
didn’t want to go to a backwater town in America of all places.
“Saturday. Apparently he has Sundays off.”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “Why weren’t we friends?”
Harry laughed humourlessly at that, still fuming from their earlier revelation. “Well, this has been pleasant but I think we should go.”
Around one hundred metres from where Harry gnawed on his lip concerned with his unfortunately news, Draco Malfoy apparated into the recently renovated super store with a sharp click of his heels. He briefly shook hands with his friend and long term business associate Blaise Zabini, and they meandered around their new and vast warehouse style store.
The boys nodded to each other and set off in search of a friend to tell them, or at least a reliable source.
He had finally managed to distract himself when he heard his bird tap gently on the window with a dainty claw. Heart beating nervously, time seemed to stand still as he clutched at the letter. Ignoring Archimedes’ squawk of dismay, he ripped open the ribbon that bound the scroll of parchment and read.
“Of course Auror Malfoy. I’d expect nothing less.” Kingsley smirked before continuing with glee. “Just so you know though… your usual preferred muggle attire won’t really work where you’re going.”
“Potter? Who cares about him? Potter is nothing to me.” Draco rolled his eyes, too happy with his success to care too much about irksome matters.
as he proclaimed them.
“Indeed. Well update me if anything changes, we can get your friend Parkinson and her company to organise PR if needs be.” Lucius dismissed his son and business partner.
“Wow Potter, he sounds perfect but what’s if he’s, you know, ugly?” Draco jibed with a wink that made Harry flush.
Ding. The doorbell to the café chirped again. Harry’s eyes shot upwards, only to be drag down by the lead feeling in his stomach. It was just two girls coming for their caffeine fix; no mystery man with a blue handkerchief in sight.
Draco had still come around after The Discussion, as Harry had titled it in his mind, though he made no mention or suggestion of anything amiss. He still mocked Harry in jest, little flecks of banter peppered into conversation as he tried to ‘educate Harry out of his plebeian ways’. It had all seemed so normal, so routine that Harry was half sure he had dreamed the whole encounter.
“No Weasellette- I mean Ginevra?” Draco stifled his habitual sneer, bad habits did always die hard. He’d noticed the lack of ginger and her belongings, and couldn’t help the frisson of hope that sparkled in his chest.
Harry chuckled. “You must have been nearly the only one then. The Prophet harangued me for weeks when I first took ownership. Fortunately, it’s quietened down somewhat now.”
Draco stared blankly at his W-book. When he’d first seen Potter’s message, he’d almost deleted it out of spite. He’d returned home the evening before in a mood so foul, even Astoria hadn’t attempted to coax him out of it. The first time he’d read it, he’d snorted in contempt, the ever righteous Potter apologising for a conversation he had not instigated. The second and third time though, Draco began to feel guilt for his own part and absolution for Potter’s. Perhaps he’d judged Quidditchboy too rashly, perhaps they could have been friends? That’s if he’d not mucked it all up by leaving him hanging. But what to put? What lie could he conceive to explain his actions? Dragonpox outbreak? Wand gone faulty? Dementor uprising? No, Draco did the only thing he could, he told the truth (an abridged version at least).
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry felt like banging his head on the steering wheel, instead he geared himself up for the rant he’d had to have repeatedly;
“Of course you will, you’ve the Malfoy charm to use too. Now how are you going to know which ones him?” Blaise looked pointedly at the café door, their arrival at their destination apparent.
“What? Have you not seen an undetectable extension charm before? I’d have thought Granger would have used one.”
Four days later and Draco had accomplished many things. The first being, of course, not succumbing to the sickness brought on by his depravity filled night of alcohol abuse. A handy hangover potion, whilst unpleasant, allowed Draco to at least somewhat function as Vice-President of their company. The second success though had required far more tactical negotiation, wheedling and pleading, to get Blaise to acquiesce to coming to the night’s big meeting with his PenPal.
“How quaint.” Detective Parker sighed before holding his hands out to take their wands. “Yes, I guess that will have to do. Do you Brits not have a W-ID card? Our non-maj team came up with them. They’re like normal muggle identification cards but will glow if they’re used by an imposter.”
“If you say so… can we at least listen to Celestina Warbeck? I don’t understand why this
“I’m not going in.” Draco announced decisively, beginning to turn around on his heel to walk away.
“Because, I don’t love you. I’m not sure I ever will.” Draco felt a huge weight had been lifted from his soul as he admitted this.
“What can I say? I’m irresistible.” Draco quipped and nudged his body into Harry’s playfully.
Draco cut him off before the damage could truly be done. “ … I’ve been to one. But Teddy, I don’t think Potter is interested in that, he’s got customers to see I’m sure.”
“When are we leaving?” Harry’s face was all business now, Auror mode fully established.
“Hmph this place doesn’t look like much, does it?” Draco raised his eyebrow, fixing a gaze on the plain brickwork that had seen better days.
“Oh my dear Blaise. Watch and learn.” Draco winked before pulling open his W-book that he’d closed to compose a witty reply to Quidditchboy, Blaise staring at his writing in amazement.
When they finally pulled up, on the other side of the city, Draco jumped from the car like he’d seen a swarm of inferi.
Harry sighed, knowing that she could not (or would not) understand his plight and instead feigned interest in her latest complaint about the bias in sporting media. It was a usual topic for her, and Harry had no way of preventing it once it had begun. Unbeknownst to him, he wasn’t the only one with relationship woes as the holidays drew near.
Taking Harry’s silence as a rejection, Draco laughed self-deprecatingly. “I guess there’s my answer.”
“Harry. I’m so glad you came. I wasn’t sure if Ginny would be able to make you. You should visit Teddy before you leave, he’s in his room with Narcissa.”
To say that Harry was bewildered by the impromptu visit of his once former nemesis would be an understatement. In the days since, Harry had replayed their conversation in his head, searching for an angle or hidden threat. He did have plenty of time after all. But finding none to fathom, Harry had to conclude that he was simply baffled by the enigma that was Draco Malfoy.
“South Park.” Craig replied in his nasally tone, wrapping an arm around the pissed off boy’s shoulders.
Upon reading the reply, Draco was substantially shocked that his plan had progressed nicely with the acceptance of his tea. Now, he had only a few days to kill until he could go and visit the man. Fortunately, distraction came in the form of his friend Blaise and the catastrophe that was his relationship with Pansy.
“She has… but never on pockets. What else you got stashed in there?” Harry couldn’t help but ask as his eyes were fixed on the tight fabric where the pocket lay flat.
Harry was unsure if he’d ever spoken to the press as much as he had the past few weeks. Perhaps when the war had just finished? But this came a close second. Ginny and her team had come through endorsing his store; stating that there could be only one place to go for quality goods. The press were having a field day with the fact that it was the Malfoys that owned the business. Harry did feel slightly guilty for that one, he probably shouldn’t have let that bit slip. Still the overwhelming support had been hugely gratifying.
“I know a lot of things Potter. I’m surprisingly multi-talented.” He joked with a heart stopping grin. “So you talk to a person online. What’s complicated about that?”
“Why? Do you not like them?” Malfoy smiled with a confident grin.
“Using my godson to spy on my store is low. Even for you Malfoy.” Emerald eyes blazed dangerously.
“Harry, have you seen the sign that’s gone up this morning at the bottom of Diagon?” She but her lip in worry.
The most frustrating part was that no one ever seemed to believe him. Not Stan and those  guys, and not even Butters. The naïve blonde would always act distressed if Kenny tried to bring up his perpetual death cycle. He supposed that was a normal reaction to hearing that your best friend believed himself to be immortal and had suffered countless deaths. So Kenny had just stopped talking about it. He didn’t suppose many people would care anyway.
person is so obsessed with riding his vélocipède.”
Harry thought but didn’t voice. He was just thankful Malfoy had got in the car and they could hopefully make it to the scheduled meeting on time. Instead he just said, “Buckle up Malfoy.”
“Despite what you might think Potter, I have changed and I wanted to make amends.” The earnest gaze overwhelmed him, making him want to turn his head, before he remembered.
Harry glared at the question, his brow furrowing into an admittedly cute frown. “No, we broke up.” He appeared to dither before sighing and offering to make the blonde a cup of tea.
“What Potter said.” Draco was surprised he was agreeing with his once sworn nemesis turned begrudging auror partner, but he
“Such a poor changing of subject for a Slytherin.” Blaise muttered, and Draco chose not to hear.
“Brave choice. Almost admirable. Will have to call you a Gryffindor soon if you keep that up.” Blaise teased as they walked side by side in the direction of the coffee shop they’d arranged to meet at.
“Because, I’m trying to make amends and I like to gift my friends.” Draco said simply before reaching into his jean pocket and pulling out a large and ornate brewing set, complete with fine china. Noticing the bewilderment on his companion’s face, Draco smirked.
, sighed and rolled his eyes. “Honestly Malfoy, you can’t be calling
“Well Potter, what do we have here? You waiting on a date?” Draco tutted mockingly, “What would Weaselette say?”
The tinkling of the bell chimed the arrival of her another entry into his store. This customer did not wait for Harry to greet them, instead he began running towards the hapless hero with a high pitched squeal.
“It’ll be easy to warm back up, Malfoy, if you get hungry later.” she said. “It’s pretty good cold, too.”

When Draco smiles, his eyes sparkle.
He is grateful when Granger doesn’t ask if it actually was. He still isn’t sure.

“Harry. Promise me.” Malfoy’s voice has a slight edge to it.
Harry says the charm and most of the stickiness disappears.
He is fully seated in Harry, trying to stop himself from coming right then from the heat and the tightness and the look of awe on Harry’s face.

The middle one is the deepest, a wide –pink-and-silver scar, raised and hard, crossing below his heart.

That was one that came closest to killing him, opening his stomach, nearly spilling his intestines onto the bathroom floor.

“What’s in your hand, Potter?” he asks.
“Don’t, Harry. Don’t.

He hadn’t had the nerve to ask Healer Mitchell outright about an abortion. And, once he cried himself out in Draco’s arms, he wasn’t sure he would want one… even if it were possible.
“Draco…,” Harry begins, but the words fall away… For a moment he says nothing, does nothing, and the next thing Harry’s eyes blaze green and Harry’s mouth is descending on his.
“Excuse me, please,” Draco says to the Welcome Witch. She doesn’t look up. “We have an appointment with Healer Mitchell.”
“No. What I really want is a turkey sandwich… with spicy mustard,” he says. “I know it sounds weird. And then to take a nap.”
With his head canted down, he looks at Potter through his lashes. Potter is watching, wide-eyed.

A tear forms in the corner of Harry’s eye, falling before Draco can stop it. He traces the path with gentle flicks of his tongue, nibbles Harry’s earlobe, and then follows the tear to the spot just below his jaw. He traces the underside of his jaw and Harry arches up slightly.

Harry shrugs, the smile playing on his lips clearly saying that he doesn’t care what

“No. Not today. I don’t want to hurt you… I just… just let me hold you. Please.”

sorry.” Draco takes a deep breath, then kisses Harry’s hand again… rather than raising his eyes to meet Harry’s.
How Harry wishes he could have left that tone in the past.
It wasn’t even particularly unjust. Macnair was the worst sort of man… vile and sadistic. And it made Severus ill to think that Draco had been given to him, that he had been allowed to rape the poor boy over and over….
I sold myself… to that woman… to that place. I sold my whole
“You have been kind of busy,” Draco says, running his fingers down Harry’s chest. They are both barefoot and bare chested, together on Harry’s bed, but Harry’s ratty jeans and Draco’s tailored trousers have remained firmly in place. They are alone in the room, and probably in the whole dormitory; most people have gone home for the weekend—an Eighth Year privilege.
Before he can properly panic, Harry Potter pushes open the door, crosses the room in two strides, and pulls Draco into a deep kiss.
. And suddenly Draco was sure that having Potter’s mouth on him was either going to be the best, or the worst, thing that could possibly happen.
Then he sits down, reverently pressing his fingers to the worn keys… and notes begin to float out of the piano in little skips and starts and gentle cords. Harry watches as Malfoy’s hands dance up and down the piano.

Potter wasn’t looking into his eyes, anymore. He was looking at his chest. “I did this,” he said, reaching for the scars that crisscrossed his chest… where the curse had missed his heart by millimeters.

He closes his eyes. When he opens them again, the room is neither dark, nor light.
Harry takes Malfoy’s hand and places it on the piano. “You don’t have to miss it anymore.”
~*~*~*~
Harry finishes tightening a bolt and carefully places the wrench back in its box. He wipes his hands on a greasy rag; Draco couldn’t have said whether the hands or the rag is getting filthier from the exercise.
Draco works hard to sip the tea without spilling any.
If there was an answer, Draco didn’t know what it was.

His father had shut the door on him.
The woman at the counter is the sweet, not-quite-regular who always calls him “dear” and asks if he’s feeling all right. Today she doesn’t ask. Instead she tells him she’s going to sit down and asks him to bring her coffee over when it’s ready.
“And You Know Who moved into your house when you were fifteen. It’s probably not best to start comparing horror stories, yeah?”
O’Brien laughs. “History’s all about the teacher, that’s for sure. My teachers at school were pretty awful too. It’s part of why I studied nursing! Anyway, like I said, it could be stress, but my money’s on a virus. You know the drill, Malfoy. Take him home, put him to bed. Lots of chicken soup, tea, and rest.” She
“Yes.”
“He hurt you.”
His eyes are on mine, wide and grey and hungry.

“We’re still figuring it out,” Draco says, squeezing Harry’s hand.
Harry steps out, into the fog… onto a street he does not recognize. Lance shuts the door.

“Turn around.”
And ever since Draco helped Bill with some tricky translation of an ancient text he needed to break a particularly nasty curse… they’ve been meeting occasionally for drinks. Even Ron’s gone a few times. Even Hermione.
There are roses blooming along the fence and the sounds of happy children coming from the schoolyard.
“Possible pregnancy,” he mutters, gaze firmly affixed on Harry’s stomach. He casts a charm without asking. “Pregnancy confirmed.”
“Right,” he says. “Me too.”
Professor Hastings is pressing a series of buttons and then requesting Miss Weasley join him in his office.
Harry always asks.
He has a fucking
“Always.”
Charlie’s little cabin is at the edge of a wide valley, surrounded by tree-covered mountains and in the middle of the dragon preserve. It’s a two-day walk from anywhere. A shallow creek, slow and sandy, wanders through the valley.
It’s unreasonable; he’s walked down the hall where he was attacked dozens of times. Since. Maybe even a hundred.
“Draco, you came! Come downstairs!”
It’s dark and someone is touching his arm.
“Let me see your hand.”
As Harry empties himself into him… shouting his name… Draco shatters into a million pieces.

Technically, Draco is trapped. Shelves rise up on either side of him; his back is to the thick stone of the castle wall. There isn’t even a window.
“I…” Draco doesn’t know what to say. He’s certainty not going to tell Weasley the truth. Not about this.
Draco can’t answer and just lets Harry cry, shaking against him, holding him tightly.
Draco’s cheeks are wet, but he is not the one crying.
When they return to Hogwarts, they find the Eighth Year common room, predictably, deserted. Harry builds up the fire and they sit in front of it.
“So are you going to spend Christmas with the Weasleys?”
Draco is grateful for the truth… but an impassioned lie would be nice, he thinks. Maybe just this once.

In the morning, Draco waits until everyone leaves, Weasley and Hermione for work, Harry to do his magic tricks for desperately sick children, then he, quite alone, marches out the front door of Grimmauld Place.
The treacle tart Draco made for dessert effectively keeps Harry from storming from the kitchen… but it does not keep him from shouting a bit.

asleep and now he isn’t. The room is dark, he is safe, and the covers are holding in all the warmth that is Harry. Draco’s hand is resting on Harry and he finds one finger twisting, absently, in the slight fuzz that’s gathered in the center of Harry’s chest.
“It’s getting late,” Harry says. “We should probably be getting back.”
“I know.”
The uncomfortable thing was that Ron believed him. He was fairly certain that Malfoy was in as much danger from He-Who-Must-Be-Named as they were; he
was the one casting curses… how he would love to be the one making that horrible man suffer.

There are other parents here now. A dark-haired woman with a toddler in a stroller smiles at me.

He picks up another, smaller box, presses a button, and the screen on the wall jumps to life. “Sorry, do you… not drink?”
He insists that they are too young to start a family… that they are impulsive… reckless… That male pregnancies are difficult… irresponsible… unnatural…

Draco grasped the arms attached to those hands and held on, his grip bruising, as every scream of pain… of anger… of betrayal… was ripped from him. Every scream he had refused to utter forced its way out.

He finds himself squatting down, watching Malfoy right the cup, replacing the few coins with trembling fingers… watching him arranging himself on the filthy blanket, tucking the ends back over his legs, pain written across his face... watching another tear slither out of his eye, running the track of almost pure white all the way to his jaw.

Please note: Draco is going to experience a very vivid flashback in this chapter. Be careful.
The flesh under Draco’s hands is beginning to tremble. “I want… I need…”
The house he’s standing in seems to be a perfect marriage of the two extremes: It’s neither sprawling, nor tiny, and it has quite a large garden, but stands at the edge of the sort of village that looks like it bustles during the daytime. There’s a sturdiness to the house, but not a sternness, and the thick stone walls and ancient beams are softened with warm wood and shabby, but authentic, Oriental rugs.  The fire in the living room fireplace crackles merrily. Across the hall, in the dining room, a large table, solid but unadorned, sits in shadows—expectant, but not lonely.

… release Harry’s hand, they manage to get the blankets up over themselves.
He refuses to believe that the pregnancy could possibly be accidental, refuses to believe that the other father is a Muggle, and insists, with every other breath, that they have made a very poor—and possibly fatal—choice.
“You are a stubborn little brat, aren’t you?” Macnair said, his words and his movements ruthless.
Well, not completely.
Draco nods his thanks. “All right,” he says to Weasley. “Let’s get to it, then. Fiction, obviously. Something romantic, I think.”
“I know what yesterday was,” Malfoy say softly, reaching over the counter to place his hand on Harry’s.
I’m not. I don’t think. I guess I’m not sure.
“I’m not sure it would have helped, to be honest.”
The light from the hallway is enough for him to make out the familiar profile.
“More, Draco,” Harry says, not breaking the kiss. “I want more.”

Draco’s hand is in Harry’s. Or Harry’s hand is in his. Their fingers are laced, palm to palm, and Draco has no idea who reached for whom, or even when it happened. They might have been standing there all afternoon, just staring and holding hands.
“Right.” Harry tries to hide the knife-slash across his heart by turning away from Lance and sliding out of the bed. Luckily his trousers are on the floor by his feet. He pulls them on.

He wasn’t surprised to find Malfoy unbound.
. But not enough.
“Get up, Draco. You need to make yourself presentable. The Dark Lord wishes to see you.”
“No!” Harry’s hands are on his hips, pulling him closer.
Outside the wind has died down to be replaced by a light rain. Draco can hear it, pattering softly against the living room windows.
Nothing happens.

“Malfoy…,” Harry said reaching for it. “Where…?”
“I mean, there’s no reason for you to work! We have lots of money. You don’t have to!”
An emotion Draco can’t name wells up inside of him. The eyes aren’t enough. He reaches for Harry’s hand, intertwining their fingers. “I love you,” he whispers. It is a poor substitution for what he is feeling… what he wishes he could put into words, or even thoughts... but it is also the truth.
He sits. Gratefully. He’s even more tired than usual today.
Harry runs his thumbs across the scars. He looks up, holding Draco’s gaze. “Will you… will you take off your shirt?” he asks.
He nodded and was about to take a sip of water when white-hot pain tore through his forearm.
He remembers all the days and nights in his cupboard, and then in his tiny bedroom at Privet Drive, weak and listless… he hadn’t known

Draco wants to trust him… and knows that would be foolish.
“No one is safe with me, didn’t you know?”
“No.”
Besides Malfoy, only Ron, Hermione, and Charlie are aware that he is in London.
“No. But it feels… I don’t know. Evil. All I know is that Kreacher brought it to my mother. Regulus had asked Kreacher to destroy it, but he couldn’t. He thought, maybe, she could, but… she couldn’t either.”
“Is this okay?” he asks.
“No,” Malfoy whispered. “They’re okay.”
and not because they need me to save the world or because I’m working on their favorite fucking charity?”
Malfoy’s fingers press down on the last cords… the last delicate notes slipping away like thistledown in a gentle breeze. He turns back towards Harry, his face stripped bare of every mask it has ever worn.
Draco raises his eyebrows slightly. He always thought that Harry Potter was one of Dumbledore’s favorites. Had he been mistaken…? Or has something changed?
Suddenly there was emptiness behind him, and Draco could hear the Death Eater straightening his robes.
causing him pain… and, at the same time, wanting nothing more than Harry’s touch. His fingers are on the robe, ready to shed it, but Harry stops him.
The mess is everywhere, slippery and cooling on both their stomachs, the sheets, on Draco’s hand, and inside Harry’s pajamas. Their wands are out of reach and Harry slides away from Draco… to reach for his wand… his abandoned tee-shirt… anything to clean it up…
Soon, he tells it. It’s not a lie.

He passes his wand slowly over the bruised and torn flesh. A small sigh escapes Malfoy’s mouth.

Draco watches the shock and hurt writing themselves across Harry’s face.
Ron makes a strangled noise. “What…? Ugh! I did
“No!” That might have sounded a little panicky.
Elladora is practiced with the Cruciatius Curse… not quite to the extent of, say, Bellatrix, but she is more than capable of making Draco wish he had never laid eyes on her… making him wish that he had just gone quietly to Azkaban.
“You’re not a Gryffindor,” Harry says, chasing his lips. “You’re a Slytherin. You lot are supposed to be all about self-preservation.”
Harry had been prepared for the ribs, for the utter emaciation he knew he would see as soon as Malfoy removed his clothing; he gasped out loud when he saw the other boy’s back.

The library at Grimmauld Place is full of books… but it is obviously rather short on the Muggle fiction Draco has become attached to. Sometimes he sneaks into the room Granger and Weasley share and nicks one of Granger’s books—he knows she doesn’t mind—but her tastes run more towards romance, well-written, of course, but light enough to make up for the heavy tomes she reads for work.
His frozen, starving muscles do nothing to save him, and he has to struggle—really struggle—to sit back up.
His fingers graze his other arm. “Nagini bit me here… and…” He touches the center of his chest with both hands, half framing, half concealing the shiny oval at the center of his chest. “The Horcrux… Slytherin’s locket… it… Hermione had to cut it off me.”
He has spent hours there… letting day become night and autumn become winter. Making coffee and serving snacks. Sipping tea. Reading before the fire.

Draco nods before he thinks better of it.
Harry’s breathing changes, and Draco thinks he’s fallen asleep.
Upright is not ideal, and as soon as he is vertical, his stomach rebels completely. He pushes past the real Draco Malfoy and makes it to the loo just in time.

Draco was aware that his lungs weren’t functioning properly; he couldn’t seem to catch his breath. He was aware that his legs wouldn’t support his weight. One of his arms was in his father’s grasp; he wasn’t sure who held the other. He knew he was being dragged from outside to inside, down one set of stairs, then another.
Toast pops out of the toaster and Draco spreads his thickly with butter and strawberry jam.
He supposes Granger is reading it, but he picks it up and settles onto a chair by the window.
Then she’s gone.
“That’s not really the point,” Draco says. “And anyway, Harry,

He doesn’t. Except to fist his fingers in the blankets. Even as he sobs out Draco’s name along with his release, his hips barely stutter.

Nothing in his professional experience, and certainly nothing in his childhood, has prepared him for an evening of watching telly… with Harry Potter.
… he’s motionless. He’s not blinking… or breathing. He’s not even sure his heart is beating.
He barely slept. He forced himself to eat the charred meat and greasy potato sticks because one meal per shift was part of his pay.
. It’s foggy enough that Harry doesn’t bother looking for a secluded spot, but rather simply turns on his heel and disappears.
“Draco, say the charm.”
They are silent for the longest time, listening to the night sounds and the soft laughter coming out of the kitchen.
“Malfoy… it’s been a while. How have you…” Potter’s voice trails off.
The cat is nowhere to be seen.
“You’re home…,” Harry says.
His eyes, bright and green and pleading, look up at me. There’s not a lot of light, but I can see the teardrops glistening on his lashes.
“Your boss… she is your boss, isn’t she? … just told you to take me home and put me to bed.” Looking coy isn’t really Harry’s strong suit, but he gives it a go.
“He enjoyed being a Death Eater too much,” Draco says sadly; Vince would have ended up there, too, had he lived. “But the others…”
He doesn’t. “Erm… what are you two doing here?” he asks instead.
“After.” Harry doesn’t feel
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Excuse me?”
Once the room had been lovely, now it was messy, dirty even, the bed unmade.
Weasley pulls a blanket out of the chest at the foot of the bed, inspects it closely, gives his wand the gentle wave of a cleaning spell, and then another, more vigorous and it becomes a violent shade of orange which clashes horribly with… well everything. The Chudley Cannons.

“Yeah.”
“Y-yes, m-my Lord.”
He lies to his mother about his eating and sleeping habits—they don’t exist, but he assures her that he sleeps soundly and that he’s eating well.
Over Harry’s objections, she makes Draco stay in the waiting room.
