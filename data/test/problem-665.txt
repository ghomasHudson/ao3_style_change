"Ok before this turns into a fight why don't we go where we need to go in small groups instead of one group and we all meet up at Honeydukes and then the Three Broomsticks for a late lunch?" said Theo making everyone nod in agreement.
"We are just gathering evidence to help you get away from your relatives and Dumbledore, by doing this it will help" said Narcissa who ruffled his hair slightly.
"Get your fucking sorry arse off that floor right now and let's head to class" said Ron grabbing him roughly.
As they entered they saw Luna picking out some rainbow coloured ink when Otiz ran over to her in animal form.
"Well enough of that who wants to answer the question on what the Mandragor, Mandrakes are used for in a potion?" asked Pamona to the class.
Please can you do that for me?" Severus tried to get his son to choose something and when he put his down on the floor twin emerald green eyes with black specks in the shone up to him, tears in his eyes.
Some of them have had a back experience of a bored Harry but never and hyperactive, excitable Harry before.
"Sadly Headmaster a familiar can't be away from those he or she deems needs to be protected. He will stay due to Hadrian being here, he shouldn't hurt anyone if you don't provoke him, that is" said Severus sitting down, letting his son take the remaining seat while Remus stood behind them, keeping an eye on the thing that was his cub's familiar.
"Hadrian me and Tom have something to say to you and I hope that you are ok with this" said Severus catching his son attention even though he was blushing up a storm.
Arthur nodded and handed over Ginny's yew wand and right there and then snapped it making the magic within crackle and then disappear.
"Now where has that freak gone off too!?" said a gruff voice that both Harry and Severus knew all to well.... Vernon Bloody Dursley.
"Yes I thought we could all go for a few weeks between said two boys birthdays, yes we know said two boys will be fourteen but still I think they would love to go" said Severus not completely confusing poor Harry while Draco was more intrigued at the possibility of what this surprise was all about.
"Otiz get back here!" yelled Severus to the hybrid animal but he was upstairs in a few bounds and was by Harry's side within seconds of landing, he was mewing in delight only to stop when the three boys looked at him.
"I want to know why Harry is now in Slytherin away from his house, his friends!" sneered Jacob to Severus but he just sighed and said in a low voice "Hadrian was resorted into a different house due to his father wanting him to".
"Miss Granger we are here as your head of house and as Headmaster to talk about what has landed you here in the first place" said Tom as he came in followed by Minerva waving his wand to fix the upturned table.
Tom walked in with Fawkes on his shoulder, he had taken a liking to Tom even though he knew he had Nagini as well, he was perfectly happy on his new spot, Dumbledore never took him out like Tom was doing.
Lucius: he got a new cane with a hidden wand compartment so he could have his wand at the ready just like his old one, this one had a snake head with pale blue eyes embedded and from Severus he was given some books from the Prince library, ones he had never seen before.
"You did this!" shouted Draco pouting and pointing to his head which only earned him a smile from the two devils.
It was another day of another new term, Harry and his friends including the Otiz affectionately known as Goof by Harry himself were all walking to their first lesson of the day: Transfiguration with one Minerva McGonagall when they were stopped by Ron and Hermione of all things.
"Firstly we shall do an inheritance test and to see everything that has happened, this will also include a complete health scan, mentions of vaults and then afterwards once that is done we will do a complete cleansing if there is any blocks or potions within your system. Is that ok?"
"Haddy can you buy me so chocolate please, Drakey won't buy me any" said Pansy pouting like a kicked puppy trying to get her way.
"Good morning son and Merry Christmas, come into the living room once your washed and dressed and then we can open up the presents" said Severus as he finally got his robes out of Otiz's mouth.
I have put this off at this moment in time but everything else I can't, I get owls almost every minute since I walked into the office this morning, everyone has said that they don't want you back at school, wanting your wand snapped, living as a Squib... I don't know which one to choose so I let your parents decide for gate as your only eleven.
"He's so cute how old is he anyway?" asked Narcissa to them as they left the table Otiz in Severus' arms who was slowly falling asleep.
Under the Whomping Willow was a room, they watched as the dog became a man making the four boys scream while Otiz growled at him.
He didn't tell us why until we got back here, turns out Granger isn't in isolation anymore and we don't know why, Otiz has been like this since we got back" said Draco to him, only to make Severus sigh.
He wiped some tears away from and kissed Severus' forehead, "can you forgive me for being a prat? If so I have a surprise for you in your chambers" he slowly pulled a weepy Severus into his arms.
The staff where really helpful and one member bought me these but as you can see Otiz has claimed them as his own" and he pointed to the small boy.
"Now Lord Prince I ask you to cut your wrist deep enough to full the goblet halfway, don't worry the wound will heal right away. Once done please do the same for young Heir Prince".
Severus went back to the floo and allowed Minerva through, she was shocked to see that Draco as well as Blaise sitting quite happily with Harry studying, homework spread out on the coffee table.
The sun slowly shone through the charmed windows of Severus' bedroom making him groan slightly as it was slowly but surely brightening up the once dark room.
"Dray why did they leave us? What are they up to?" asked Harry as he watched their friends meet up with others to do their own thing.
Sirius wasn't liking the whole thing and was now nursing a very unwell stomach as he was throwing up, "never again".
"Ah yes, you are from Hungry so you don't really know about him, he was the Headmaster before you took over" explained Fudge to him making Fawkes trill happily as Tom sat down.
It never occurred to him that the boy was suffering, that had always been told that he was treated like a Prince but this now was a hundred percent a lie!
Harry was finally set free from the dreaded hospital wing which he was happy for, the smell was getting to him making him feel sick to his stomach and the watery porridge he was forced to eat that very morning didn't help things, he was only allowed to do his morning classes as he was still slightly weak from yesterday's transformations.
"Hadrian can you please help me with your father, you know he's made with me and I want to say I'm sorry but he won't listen to me, what do you think I should do?"
"Really Otiz?!" said Harry getting up from his seat at hitting his familiar on the back of the head making his ears and tail appear.
Tom was only half way through that weeks paperwork that Dumbledore had left, he was still trying to catch up with years of paper work that never seemed to be ending when there was a knock at the door.
They arrived at the entrance to Gringotts and went up to an open desk, Harry still being held by Severus as he was still shaken from what had happened with Vernon even though he was no where close to the.... man.
And so Bancroft looked towards Albus, Amelia, Harry and Severus as well as the rest of the court and sighed.
They were publicly shunning him which was bad, meaning that no one would come to help him if he needed it.
"Hi I'm sorry for taking the food, I was hungry and I saw it and ate some, sorry" it crawled up Draco's arm and sat on his shoulder it was about 30cm long and was a shiny navy blue with purple hair and teal wing, it really stood out against Draco.
You are also under arrest for grand larceny from one Tom Marvolo Riddle, one Severus Tobias Prince- Snape and one Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape formally known as Harry James Potter, bullying, intimidation, full knowledge of abuse from the just the three mentioned and filing documentation of illegal goods. Placing charms, potions and blocks onto young witches and wizards to complete tasks which are too high with their current level of magic which has resulted in many, many sad deaths.
"So what has brought all of you to my office?" said Fudge even though he knew, the Goblins had wrote to him about the blood adoption and all the blocks and potions on Harry and who had placed them all on him.
Harry couldn't believe his eyes at what he was seeing, the thought it would be something like the Muggle one he had seen when the Dursley's took Dudley and he was forced to stay in the car on a burning hot summer's day but this time was different.
A girl from Hufflepuff called Andie Owltwist who was in her fourth year now storked up to him and slapped him so hard he fell off the bench he was sitting on.
"Thank you Draco for that and it looks like I'll have someone in my chambers tonight and most like for the foreseeable future" said Severus looking down at his shaking son and then at the familiar pacing the room.
"You worry too much Otiz really you do, I have all my friends and my family to look after me, nothing will go wrong with everyone protecting me and from what you said about Lady Hogwarts and Lady Magic I'm more protected than ever before.
"What seems to be the matter Mister Potter?" she asked only to have Harry reply with "it's Snape now Madam".
Severus hummed at what was happening but Hadrian kept his face in his fathers chest not wanting to be there.
I want to live my life in the Muggle world with my family and I hope Mister Hadrian Snape understands that what my client has done is the worst thing anybody could hope for all he had to do was check on him but he never did if it wasn't for his father we would have lost the Saviour of the Wizarding world.
Even if that meant ripping the brat away from him and replacing back where he should be even if they almost killed him again, he would make it happen.
"Draco please sit down and we will tell you everything that we know and hopefully you'll understand why Harry here is now Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, he is no longer Harry Potter as of two months ago" sneered Severus making the blond boy sit down without a word leaving his lip, while Harry was placed on Severus' knee so then he could cuddle into the warmth that his father gave him
The door opened, only to be hit with the smell of blood, I looked around the room but it was too dark to see. "Lumos", I gasped in shock for the sight in front of him. Harry lay bloody and bruised in a small corner of the room. I could hear a faint whimper coming from the boy and walked closer only for Harry to flinch away and whisper "I'm sorry sir, I'll be more quiet. Please sir I won't disobey you again. Just don't hit me" I was in shock. What the hell has happened here?!
Otiz growled at her and then punched the three boys away from her, no way where they getting involved with her!
"Insolent disgusting Muggle you've made me lose the Saviour of the Wizarding world he was in that place so then he could learn his rightful place he was beaten by them so then he knew what pain and misery felt like so then he could get Voldermort and destroy the bastard when he came back for power!
Hermione sighed and turned to face Luna "looks like someone put a charm on them so then they won't come down, you'll have to get a teacher, I must be going I have some homework that I need to do" and she walked off bumping into Harry as she went.
"I did no such thing, he fell over his own feet must not be able to walk if he does that" laughing slightly as she got her wand out even if it was a child's wand, for some stupid reason the teachers didn't trust her with her normal wand but it would have to do, this should be simple enough.
If he wants to he can get the Ministry to take action as using self writing quills in Hogwarts is against the rules, what you have done about bullying and raping students you WILL make a formal writing apology to each and everyone one of them through letter and a full public display.
Otiz noting his familiar's thought process and he growled louder than before and then in the room now stood a rhino size animal Otiz, his fur was now no longer the pale blue it was firey red, static flying everywhere and vaper coming from his mouth.... he was pissed.
Werewolf Remus sniffed the air noting that it smelt like his mate, of broom wax, engine oil and leather and the fox that he had known over the year as well as his cub, his missing cub that now smelt of potions more than his honey and lavender rose he knew from when he was but a baby, the lavender was long gone now but the honey was still there just not as powerful anymore.
"Harry listen to us for Merlin's sake you need to get out of that slimy god for nothing house and the demon bat from hell and come back to where you belong!" shouted Ron for the final time.
You will help me with the house work as well as the garden, me and your brothers as well as your father will not speak to you and if we do we only want a yes form you. Your room will be stripped of everything besides your clothes and bed.
Poppy came bustling over to see what was wrong and upon seeing Otiz she knew it only had to be Harry in the bed but when she noticed that he wasn't there but a phoenix was.
Severus came towards the bed and once there he sat down and stroked Harry's hair, noticing how soft it was, yep definitely Lily's texture as well as her eyes everything else was James freakin Potter, oh well.
He had tried to worm his way into Severus' life when his mother had died but he just couldn't get passed his defences at all, he was imperishable!
The trio knew nothing of what was going on, they were still trying to figure out what was going on with Hermione's school work to notice now that they were left alone in the tower.
"Why did that idiot have to take her out of isolation? She's hurt my baby way to much, so did the other two how he trusted them and all of it lost to him..." he was full out crying now and didn't hear the door opening.
As they were having their dinner a burst of green flames appeared and then disappeared to reveal one Albus Dumbledore, he nodded to the pair and when he noticed Otiz, he couldnt make out what it was but the darn thing was hissing and growling at him.
She walked right up to them, went round to the side of the table that Harry was sitting on and punched him right in his face breaking his nose in one fall swoop, blood was gushing out.
"Hadrian don't worry about her she won't be able to do a thing with us here, she will be place on the magical reins so she won't be able to spoil yours and Draco's birthday treat" said the twins as they were still pinned by Otiz as he was now lying down on them looking like he was asleep.
"Ok enough dawdling time to get up, have a wash and then up to breakfast in the Great Hall before we head out for the day" said Severus as he got up from the bed and again smiled a true smile to the boy.
"Son it's a lovely gift for Narcissa she will love it" and so they ordered it to be delivered to Spinners End and so they went on their way after they paid.
"Professor I don't know what you're on about I would like you to please tell what is going on" said Hermione looking shocked but up at the same time scared that she was going to cotton on with what she has been doing the passed eighteen months.
It looked like a little snake with wings eating some chicken and had a bit of lettuce sticking out of its mouth.
From what I could work out and from what Madam Pomfrey and dad told me... I was....." He couldn't say anymore he was now in complete tears, Severus just sighed and got up and picked him up.
Harry was curled around himself like a cat lightly snoring not at all noticing he had yet again changed form.
"Ah Fawkes my faithful companion are you here to help me?" asked Albus and when he brought his hands up Fawkes bit him hard and drew blood.
HE MAY NOT BE IN THE SAME HOUSE AS YOU ARE NOW BUT HE IS STILL FAMILY WHERE WE STAND FROM AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT I AS YOUR MOTHER DONT LIKE BULLYING!
"Mooney I missed you so badly as well, I was going crazy in that cell if it hadn't been for Tomas I would still be there, he got me a trial and everything, I'm now free and Tomas said I could come to Hogwarts with him. Oh Mooney if I hadn't gone after that rat Harry wouldn't have been in that household and grew up like that! We need to get him out!"
"A true Slytherin if I ever saw one" said Lucius to Sirius as they got onto the Drop Tower and were soon strapped in for safety.
"Good morning son and how did you sleep?" he asked without saying anything about his son's new look, he was pleased with how he looked, he still had his emerald green eyes which he was thankful for as it reminded him of Lily.
"We goes now, now, now!" said Otiz as he wriggled out of his grip taking some clothes with him and into the room.
"We will but can you pick something out for this nice man to pay for as a sorry for what he happened and he very gently pushed his son towards the stuffed animals.
"Severus dear I think it be best if we all meet up tomorrow morning say at ten outside the Ministry and then we will head in and see Fudge" said Molly making everyone around them all nod, they were going to make sure that they were there for the boy.
"Well we can go to Hogsmeade as we are third years and we have all got consent for it including Hadrian there... mind you he's fast asleep on you Draco" he laughed slightly pointing to the boy sleeping on Draco's shoulder.
I also heard that he refused to eat anything that his loving aunt... yes Petunia is her name, she is so nice, gave him saying what she made was disgusting and he would never eat something that she made.
Severus walked towards the edge of Hogwarts once out of the school's boundaries he appeared to 4 privet Drive, it was late in the evening, the only light that could be seen was the street lights. Severus spotted the front door and went straight to it, he looked around once more, noticing that no one was around, he pulled out his wand and whispered "Alohomora" the door opened with a soft click, not loud enough to wake anyone.
"Hello Hagrid I was wondering if I could ask you some questions? I think you might know who is pulling these stupid and utterly ridiculous pranks on the school" she said in a matter of factly.
She never wanted something like this to happen to anyone but due to what she had read in his case file after he was placed in his new family, she being one of them that had altered many a memory to make him fit in.
Back at Hogwarts the group headed to Severus' quarters and noticed that the three men were now laughing animatedly about everything and anything.
They all tried and only Harry and Draco managed to get one, they came in a set of four and each one was different, Harry's one was holding a fake pearl necklace while Draco's was holding a gallon. The other two had a crown on it head and the other was holding four different coloured rings which represented the houses of Hogwarts.
"Remmy careful please, she hasn't done anything to me or to you, I'm only making sure she doesn't get harmed that's all don't worry" he slowly stepped forward to try and help please the werewolf boyfriend of his, hoping that they were still together at least.
They walked up to a counter and to Harry's surprise it was Griphook at the desk, "ah Mister Potter what can I do for you?" he asked the boy who just hid behind Severus making Griphook look at him instead. "Mister Snape what can we at Gringott's do for you and Mister Potter?"
He bored as Hadrian wanted to spend sometime alone to do his homework with his friends and it fell down to me to look after him.."
Hermione pushed right passed Harry and his friends pushing him over landing on Otiz with a this, "Miss Granger that's two nights so far" said Flitwick to her.
"You will not get off like your brother and Miss Granger have, you will be exspelled from Hogwarts as you have not just harmed poor Hadiran but you have tormented many others for the sake of your own ridiculous reckless reasons.
You would think Ron would back down but he didn't, he stood up and started screaming at Harry with all his might about the injust that had occured and how he got to his parents and about all the lies he had told them!! Anything and everything he could think of Ron said it making Harry flinch and retreat into himself, this made Otiz jump up from beside Blaise and almost attack Ron for what he had done until the Great Hall doors opened to reveal one Molly Weasley.
"Finally you are going to get along and no more fighting I hated to see you to fight all the time when you could be friends" said Severus after a long while of watching the boys converse.
I would like to have you back as a friend, I miss my best mate, you were the first person that saw me as Harry nothing more. My name might of changed but I am still the same person! Can you deny me something that I never had but have only just got which you have always known?" he asked but Ron said nothing and walked off.
After a few long antagonising minutes Harry got up and looked at his father, tears streaming down his face, he launched himself at Severus only for him to almost fall off the bed as he held his son tightly.
"Secrets revealed, hair changing, ears and tails, got to love fireworks, puking pastilles" said George listing just some of the pranks that they had with them but was willing to make more if needed.
Yes he was James and Lilly's son, yes he looked like a spitting image of his father James but he was Lilly more than anything he could see it in all the little things he did and Severus was proud to have his hated bully's son as his own. His own flesh and blood so to speak... he was after all blood adopted so he was his own son, if only Harry's parents could see him now after what he had gone through he bet that they would be happy with his decision.
He was now in school, everything was strange it wasn't a castle, no stone walls not lamps for that matter, where were the tapestries, suits of armour, the ghosts?? Where in Merlin was he!
Hermione knew that she was being shunned just like Ron was but due to her keeping herself to herself mostly it wasn't as quick as it had been with Ron... she just wanted her friend back was that too much to ask?
The door opened to reveal both Minerva and Tom standing there, they at first watched the girl to see what she did next, which she flipped the table over in anger.
"My office Miss Weasely, now" said Minerva and both Professor's followed the young girl out of the Hall.
They have the ability to change their eye shape depending on the time of day, their fur sparks when petted, lick blood and walk without sound.
The new school term has just started back up and Harry was quietly getting back into his school work with the help of Draco, Blaise and for some reason Pansy, he never did like her but since he had been adopted by Severus she had changed her mind on him.
They headed to Madam Puddifoot's a little cafe that was more for couples than anything and Draco had got them a private table as he knew Harry didn't want everyone looking at him all the time.
He had pulled all the kitchen drawers out, tipped the chairs, pulled Harry's favourite blanket off the back of the sofa along with the cushions, running and jumping around! It was like he was on a complete sugar rush!
"Albus what has gotten into you, I have never seen you like this, calm down" said Severus to him but it was no use Albus has lost his temper and so his magic was unleashed and flew him across the room and he landed with a thud.
By the time first class was upon them Ginny was mouthing off about how great she was and how no matter what she was going to be the next Mrs. Potter even though Harry was no longer a Potter!
Albus was fuming but didn't let it show, how could a thing like that be allowed in this Honourable School!! He would have to get rid of it and fast.
"You sir may be my mother's cousin but you are nothing to me or to Hadrian, we don't trust you, come in guys let's get out of here I think uncle Sev might want to know about this" soon they left with the Whomping Willow only for Severus to come up to them asking if they were alright.
Soon their food had arrived something light which had been a salad for the both of them, Harry a tuna niçoise hold the olives while Draco had a chicken ceaser salad, they had asked for some raw meat for Otiz which they were happy to supply for them.
"Miss Weasely you have twenty plus cases open on you from when you left school today alone and I expect many more to come in during the day about what you have done to the student population, Potion Master Snape has asked you to be brought to court over threating to murder his son.
"That one!" pointed Harry as he practically dragged not only Draco with him but Sirius as well, this made the man gulp at it all.
"Here Hadrian have the other one" said Draco handing his one over making the brunette smiled brightly as was now becoming the norm for the boy after being adopted by Severus in his second year he was now slowly healing but he still had appointments with his mind healer but they were getting less and less and it was all thanks to his new friends and his extended family.
I slowly crept into the house and went up the stairs, everyone with a louder creek, damn! Once at the top of the stairs I saw four doors that seemed to open, all except one. The last door, at the end of the hallway, was closed and locked from the outside, what the hell?! I rushed to the locked door, still being quiet as a mouse and once again whispered "Alohomora" at once all the locks unlocked.
"Ok you lot what are you up to and can uncle Padfoot join in?" asked Sirius as he headed over to them.
By dinner that night she was complete and couldn't wait for her teachers to give her full marks as she had made sure to add extra points and information onto each essay that she had wrote, they were perfect in her book.
Dumbledore stood up once everyone had sat down and had said "we all love to have a joke now and then and I'm wondering when..." he stopped and looked at the Weasely twins who were playing the innocent game as they knew that everyone knew that they wouldn't prank themselves.
Severus glared at the boy and moved his hand and removed the boy from his son, then he pulled out his wand.
Harry enjoyed when they explored Ohe'o Gultch and the winding Hana Highway, he loved every minute of it, while Harry went swimming Severus went off and gathered more ingredients from the surrounding area, only to come swimming as well.
"Yes he came into the lab and wasn't happy that you were boring and no fun, then then asked to be carried and here we are ten minutes later" he brushed Otiz' hair out of his eyes the child snoring slightly.
One Lucius Abraxas Malfoy was standing in front of the Head Table waiting for everyone to sit down so then he could tell them what had happened and why the Ministry was now getting involved with the school.
The other Weasley's would be getting something small, nick knacks really but each one would be tough through.
"Again let me talk before interrupting me please Mr. Andrews... as I was saying this is Hadrian Snape he is no longer Harry Potter. He was adopted over the summer after something happened... I will let him explain if he so wishes...
Severus was out for a few weeks collecting his potion ingredients while Harry enjoyed his summer holidays with his friends.
Harry kicks off his shoes, drops the cloak and map on top of them and sits down cross-legged on the rug between the two of them. “What are we chatting about?” Harry asks, grabbing a cushion to hug to his chest.
"He gently pulled me away from him with the arm around my shoulder and looked at me. I expected him to tell me all the reasons we couldn't. Instead, he just said what would happen if we did, and it was my call."
"Good morning Hermione. Weasley." Draco says as he continues around to the other side of Harry before sitting across from Ron.
“So essentially what you’re telling me is you’ve come to help me solve my problems, but none of my problems are ones you can solve.”
“Shit. I’m so sorry guys, I’m so used to it being just the three of us. I kind of forgot there were other people in the house.” Harry said, his cheeks flushing red.
"I love you both, and I'm lucky to have you in my life." Harry's face turns lascivious, "Now, get out of here. I have a hot, naked, blonde in my tub upstairs waiting to bugger me senseless." Ron grimaces, and Hermione laughs. "Details later, Harry. I want details." She says as Ron pulls her to the fireplace.
Harry climbs into his bed in the Gryffindor dorm and reaches out to pull his curtains closed when Dobby pops up at the foot of his mattress.
“I’m not shocked you shagged Charlie. But his conquests and adventures have always been gossip between the siblings, I’m shocked he kept it secret.”
Harry went back to the Great Hall, found Kingsley, and informed him loudly that his house was now under Fidelus and he’d been smart enough to not use Hermione or Ron as his secret keeper.
But Harry held up his hand, cutting her off, “Look, I’m sure that he would be fine with Andi, but she’s his grandmother, his only one. Remus’ father is his only grandfather. That little boy had both parents taken from him in a single night, thanks to Voldemort. Sound familiar? Who else is going to make sure he never experiences the childhood I had, make sure he knows the truth about himself, his parents, how loved he is? And we still don’t know if he’s going to have his mom’s traits or his dad’s traits, he may have both. He may become a werewolf every month for the rest of his life.” Harry’s tone had become more authoritative and passionate with each statement. “I will not let the world treat him like an outcast or a lesser being when I can do something about that.”
“When dragon hide breaks the skin, you’re at risk for a serious infection,” says Charlie, his tone serious, a stark contrast to the playful manner of earlier. “You need to have it looked at.”
“I’m glad to hear it, though I’d still have been thankful either way. This may sound like a strange question given the circumstances, but today I keep learning how many layers there can be to those who served him. I know your family kicked out Andromeda, but do you have any type of relationship with her?”
“Did he ever,” Harry laughs. “Obviously I have a thing for Weasleys. Well, most of you. I’ll never be interested shagging Percy or Ron,” Harry said, pulling a face.
Ron took up the story, “Griphook left us as soon as he got the Sword of Gryffindor. The Flagrante and Gemino curses on the gold in the vault. The guards were coming for us and we had no way out. We were barely holding the guards off and yelling at each other for ideas, when Hermione came up with her mad plan. She blasted the bannister, then ran and jumped on the dragon. Harry and I followed, then ‘Mione blasted the chain holding it and we flew up and out through the roof.”
Ron spoke before Hermione could, "Look, mate, you deserve to be happy. It's easy to see he makes you happy.  This morning threw me for a bit, but I don't have issues with Malfoy anymore, he's different. We're all different. I just want my best mate to smile, and I think he makes you smile.  I won't pretend to understand the two of you regularly bring random men home, but if you're both happy, then I'm happy," Ron said, grasping Harry's shoulder. "Feel free to stop buggering my siblings, though," Ron said with a grimace.
"Sorry, love, that tends to happen around me," Harry said with a warm smile. He reached over to Draco and took his hand, pulling Draco's hand into his lap. "And it sounds heavy, but Fred and George were a bright spot for me. A little normalcy in a sea of strange.  I wouldn't change that for the world."
Whichever twin is under him starts pressing a lubed finger inside Harry.  He knows it’s not the same person who’s loosening him up with his tongue because that twin is still holding his cheeks apart. The finger in his arse seems to be searching for something, though Harry’s not really sure what would be in there to find, and then all thoughts leave his mind as the finger strokes across something inside him that sends a jolt straight to his cock and Harry is suddenly coming without warning.
Harry snickers. He reaches up to grab the two vials that have just flown up the stairs and into his hand.
“Harry, you’re only seventeen, your life is just beginning, surely Mrs Tonks isn’t expecting you to raise him on your own?” asked Ginny.
“It happens sometimes. Look, everyone will be here shortly, and I still need to go see Andromeda and Teddy. Can you handle settling everyone in?”
“It doesn’t really matter what she wants, it’s not up to her. I mean, I expect her to want to be a part of her grandson’s life, at least I hope she does. But I committed to his parents that I would care for him, and it wasn’t something I did on a whim. I knew the responsibilities when I said yes to Remus and I won’t hand that over to someone else after making that promise.”
Hermione looks over at the pair with amusement. "Well, Draco, I'm pleased you finally decided to grace us with your presence at Sunday breakfast, instead running off to hide."
It was my turn to chuckle. “That’s true. Is the Q&A part of the evening over now? Not that I’m complaining about you holding me here like this. It’s rather warm and safe, but I believe you promised to make me forget that I’m Harry Potter, and right now, I still know my name.”
He looked me in the eye and said, "Harry, I don't do relationships. Ever. With anyone." I went to talk, and he cut me off. "I know you and Ginny broke it off. But I also know my little sister's in love with you. Do you even like women?"
Harry lifts her a bit more, giving him room to slide out from under her. He sets her down gently on the pillow he just vacated, then rolls off the bed and stands up.  He quickly rolls his neck and shoulders to release the tension in his muscles, then reaches out to help Ginny into a more comfortable position. He can tell she’s still lost in the force of her orgasm and isn’t really back with him yet, so he climbs back up on the bed and pulls her gently into his lap.  He adjusts them, so his back is against the headboard, and Gin is seated across his lap, leaned into his torso, with her head tucked under his chin.
“Of course I can, but I’m not cutting into you this time. If Ron cuts it out, I’ll heal it.” she asked as she stood from the sofa.
The little elf’s diction was a shock to Harry, and he sat on the ground rather than continue squatting. “Were you educated by Snape?” Harry asked, curiosity evident in his tone.
Narcissa rose from her kneeling position and helped Andi to her feet. “Go home and rest, Harry. All will be fine in time. I will stay with my sister.”
“I’m going to wreck you. But that was the plan.” Charlie said with a wink. He stood from the table and dropped his pants with a quick shove down his hips. The sight of him naked was just as hot as I expected it to be.  The muscles in his thighs were toned and tight and just as strong as those in his arms. He climbed back up onto the table and between my legs, where I got a good look at his cock for the first time.
Harry nods, "Four already have, three are willing." Both sets of eyes across the table from Harry go wide, and he can see the thinking going through both of their brains.
"Not okay with cheating. That would never happen. Bill's happy with Fleur, but Fleur has given him a free pass with me, which I have no doubt she'd extend to Draco if I asked nicely." Harry puts his hand up, "Before you ask anything else. It's not my story to tell, and I'd rather you never even mention that you know that much."
He leaned us forward from the wall and used the hand on my neck to pull his shirt over his head in one movement. He never stopped grasping my ass, leaving the shirt hanging from his wrist. He leaned back against the wall, and this time when he pulled me forward, he changed the angle I was sitting at so he could reach my nipples. My hands were on his shoulders, and I immediately began running my hands over the muscles in his shoulders and upper back. I slid my hands up his neck and into his hair, newly shorn, and ran my nails over his scalp.
The twin under him slides out and comes around to Harry’s front. Harry’s too far gone to figure out which twin it is, but he hears him look down at Harry and ask, “Want to keep going?”
Charlie bit, pinched, kissed, scratched, and worshiped every inch of my torso. He slowly made his way down, eliciting sounds from me that should have been embarrassing, but I was too far gone to care. I felt utterly wanton. When he made it past my navel, he took the path down one side of my hip, altogether avoiding the place I was so desperate to feel his touch.  I was so hard, my cock was leaking precome and jutting out from my body, begging to be touched. When he reached the place, my hip meets my thigh, he switched to the other side starting at the hip and working his way back in a circle until he met my navel again. I heard myself whine when he sat back on his calves and just looked at me.
Harry broke out into laughter, “Gin, seriously. Do your brothers strike you as husband material for me of all people?”
Harry had finished eating, and Teddy had finished his bottle and begun crying. Harry stood up and began pacing and rocking Teddy to soothe him while he told the story of Severus Snape and his friend Lily Evans. He told his family of Snape’s childhood and then how his father and Sirius treated him throughout Hogwarts. He explained Snape’s fatal mistake of calling Lily a mudblood, of the man’s immediate desire to take it back, and how no matter how many times he tried to apologise, Lily wouldn’t hear it.
They headed over to the Floo, where Harry picked up Otiz who buried his head into his neck while Harry in fact buried his face into his fathers chest... he hated Flooing at the best of times but at least it was better than the alternative.
"Draco sit down we have a lot to talk about before our guests arrive in so little time" said Lucius as his wife sat down next to her husband making their son sit down in front of them on the other sofa.
Little did Ron know as that Greta was part of the Magical World, she was instructed by Wizengamot to look out for the wizard boy turned Squib after the was outcastes and shunned by Hogwarts and then by the Wizarding World itself.
"We never knew what the poor boy was going through during his time with those people who was meant to be his family, us the Malfoy's a pure blood family would never in our wildest dreams do that to any child. No wizarding family would" sneered Lucius indicating his hatred of the family.
Harry and his friends left as well but before the could get a good several feet away from the classroom Harry was swept into an iron grip from Otiz as he waited outside for them.
Albus had wanted Harry to stay at his no good relatives, he wanted him weak, knowing nothing of the magical world, he wanted him beating and broken! He wanted him to run to him when things went wrong! He wanted to have the golden boy, the saviour of the Wizarding World with him! He wanted to rule Harry's life!
"Tom get off me! I'm still mad at you, you idiot!" he tried to get up but he was stuck which didn't please him at all.
"Did this man never to his paperwork?" said Tom as he scribbled his signature on one of the thousands of parchments in front of him again.
For the twins I don't think it was them playing these pranks, they have grown concern for Hadrian and wouldn't hurt him and use him in these types of pranks, something I have asked them about as I also thought it would be them" said Severus trying to explain everything.
"I will sort this all out Harry I promise but first and foremost the adoption if you would Griphook" this made him nod and again pulled out the necessary documents which was mostly filled in by the Goblins already as the ink was still wet and handed over to Severus to sign.
I pushed you away from seeing you and when your friends grabbed hold of me it was the best thing they could of done otherwise I would of ripped that bushy haired idiots head off and don't say I won't because I would of!"
"I know you are you idiot, and I think I can forgive you" as he ate the last of his favourite chocolate cake.
"Are you ok?" she crouched down beside him checking him over the best she could with her very limited knowledge of first aide, Sirius just groaned and slowly sat up.
A door slowly formed out of the stone wall and opened to reveal my private quarters, I stepped back to allow Harry to walk in first. Harry looked around in amazement, he is so much like Lilly at the moment, their eyes the same, there were books everywhere, the walls were a dark green, there was a black leather sofa covered with papers, I should really clean up I then started to walk towards a room with a closed door, Harry stayed put.
Ron stood up and shouted to him "that freak over there next to that ferret took him to court for nothing! He should be back where he belongs! With us Gryffindor's and with his loving relatives!
Animagus (hybrid of Rainbow Phoenix (very rare) and Basilisk (rare), can change into both or a mix of each 100% blocked
Many of the student came from the Sacred families even if they were also branches from said families. They would make sure that the shunning would last inside and outside of Hogwarts!
Suddenly he was wrapped in total darkness only to hear a strong baritone voice that he knew that belonged to one Severus Snape, his father.
The rest of the Weasely boys were planning on keeping an eye on their younger siblings or playing some pranks; namely the twins of course.
As you might know I am a Bakeneko which translates to 'Changed cat' which is a Japanese cat demon it's often confused with the Nekomata, one way to tell these two apart is that Bakeneko has one tail while the Nekomata has two.
"Griphook I would like to take up full custody of Harry here as it has come my knowledge that he isn't being cared for by his family as well as his guardian, whoever that might be that is" said Severus to the Goblin who in turn smiled at him.
He chucked the Floo powder into the Floo network system and called out for the Ministry, once all the tugging finished Harry practically fell out of the Floo.
"It appears not Tomas, that man never did anything besides meddle in other people's personal lives" said Severus as he sat down a small smile playing on his lips.
"Still not used to magical transportation?" asked Lucius to Severus as he was still rubbing his son's back.
We all know the truth about what has happened we have all seen the results and everything, you will be fine" and she gave him a tight hug, claiming him more after his father had left.
"Just admit it you stole that freak from us!" yelled Vernon to him while his son Dudley tried to yank the poor boy off his father.
He had warned him about it but he still went and done it behind his back and now he had to go grovelling to one snarky potions professor that happened to be his boyfriend, if he could count it as that after four dates. He wasn't sure.
Once it stopped glowing fully Severus began to read through what his son had been though, as he read it Harry clung tighter and tighter to him, he didn't want anyone to know this, he was hating every minute of it.
It was one that helped me get this far by getting magic off Harry the same with Ron but now I can't find it!"
"You have got to admit him thinking magic is real at this age, thirteen, is quite funny" said Becky to her sister who in turn nodded.
"I don't need anything else I thought we were just getting Otiz some toy's?" asked Harry looking at his father shocked.
Remus was sitting at the end of the table next to Severus who was ignoring everyone besides watching his son interact with his friends.
Remus gave Sirius a quick kiss on his forehead and started to leave the room but Sirius held him and looked at Tom.
Severus then stood to leave but felt a tiny hand grasp his wrist, he looked back confused when Harry then asked "Sir, um... can I er sleep with you?" Harry stuttered. Severus only nodded and picked the boy up, Severus was surprised at how light the twelve year old was, he walked into his room and slowly laid Harry down onto his bed, covered him up, careful not to wake him, Severus placed a light kiss on the top of Harry's head. Severus slowly eased himself onto the bed and turned on his side, he dimmed the lights and looked at Harry once more before sleep overtook him.
Fred and George- they would be getting some muggle jokes and pranks that they could easily turn magical and sweets
"Severus please this is just silly, he will and forever be known as Harry James Potter, he was born with that name, it does not matter that he was adopted, Harry my boy, isn't that right?" said Albus looking at the spot where the boy once stood.
"Remus what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?" asked Tom as he put down his quill for a much needed rest, it wasn't even lunch and he was going crazy with the paperwork!
This made everyone who was in the hall come over to see what was going on and when they all saw that Harry was being bullied by his own house, ex house at that, they knew something was going on.
Diarrhea, conjunctivitis, flu, broken ribs, broken foot, torn ligiments in shoulder, malnutrition, dehydrated
"Otiz please if you want to go back and listen to them reminisce about their youth be my guest but after listening to it very night after classes for the passed fortnight I can't stand being there" said Harry to his familiar.
Everyone turned to the hybrid laying under the desk, mouth slightly open where the fire had generated from, they hoped, he then turned his head as to say 'I will know if something happens' and promptly fell asleep.
"I should put him on reins" said Remus making everyone else laugh all knowing how back Sirius could get at types of fun and pranking was right up there.
What he didn't want was Sirius coming along but after talking to him for a few days about anything and everything he found out what really happened as well as a few very well timed hexes from all five adults in the Malfoy home did Sirius realise he was not James and was just Harry or Hadrian as he was still trying to get the idiot, which Severus kept calling him or mutt, to understand that he was now adopted as well blood adopted there was Severus' blood running through his veins more so than James and Lilly but he still wasn't listening to them until Remus had stepped in a cursed him for a week.
Harry chuckled and made his way to the table. After eating their fill, they made their way into the bathroom and sank down into the hot water. The heat and the potion immediately began relaxing their tense, sore muscles. Both made quick use of washing up, dunking under the water quickly, and washing their hair. After they’d gotten clean, as the bubbles began to dissipate, the pair just sat comfortably and enjoyed the heat and the quiet.
“I’ll try to make this quick, Harry, but there are some things that need clearing up first,” Kingsley said as he took a seat.
He called for Kreacher. Then Teddy began crying. “Kreacher, time to eat.” Harry scooped up the infant from the crib and called Winky to bring a bottle for Teddy down to the kitchen.
He knew when he planned to break into Gringotts. Which, even with the crazy plots they had pulled off in the past, Harry was sceptical they would accomplish.
“Fucking Merlin, you’re tight, Harry,” Fred exclaims as he slowly pushes inside Harry. Harry doesn’t think it’s possible to feel more full than he does right now. The sensation is strange, but not bad. He’s processing what he really thinks about it as Fred pulls out and pushes back in, after a couple slow thrusts, Fred sets a steady rhythm, and George matches it immediately.
Harry shivers at the sound of such a dirty thought coming from his comedic friend, but he can’t lie and say he isn’t curious. Fred guides Harry to his knees over George’s head and holds him steady as he lowers his arse onto George’s mouth. George immediately starts lapping at the come that has dribbled into the crease of Harry’s arse. Once he cleans that up, he fastens his mouth over Harry’s entire hole and sucks in earnest. Harry gasps, his legs are threatening to give out, but Fred’s arms are helping hold him up, and George’s hands are strong and steady under his thighs, so Harry just lets go. His balls and cock are lying haphazardly across George’s face, and this is just so dirty, wrong, right that his spent cock gives a twitch. It’s too soon for him to get hard again, but his dick is definitely letting him know that this is turning him on. George sucks hard one more time, then backs off to lick all of Harry as if he’s making sure nothing has been left behind.  George slides from under him, and both twins help ease him down to the rug.
“I belong to you now, sir. Master Severus insisted that when he died, I would then belong to Harry Potter.”
Harry stuck the sock between his teeth, put his head down, and gripped the edge of the tabletop. Without warning, Ron drug the knife down the cut to open it up.
He didn’t bob up and down on my cock like I thought he would, he just slid all the way down my shaft until his nose was flush against my abdomen and his chin against my balls and sucked. I could feel his throat pulsing around me, and his fingers inside me began to rub faster and harder. I knew I was going to come, so I put my hands in his hair as a warning, getting ready to pull him off, but he pushed down even farther. It wasn’t long, and I was coming, shooting my load straight down his throat.
“Good. Now I’m going to torture Mum. When I tell her she’s a Gran, she’s going to assume we’re getting married. She’s going to freak out.”
Harry’s eyes widened in shock. “Is that why you three are still here? You’re turning yourselves in?”
After Kreacher apparated away, Ron looked at Harry, quite confused, and asked, “Avoiding a Peter Pettigrew situation?”
"I don't want the details of who's bits went where but I'd like to understand how that happened," Ron says, "And I cant wrap my head around Bill.  I can't imagine you're okay with cheating."
He carried me back to the table, but instead of putting me down on it, he stood me up on my legs. I was turned around and bent at the waist over the table.  He stretched my arms out over my head and pressed my torso down into the table. “Don’t move. Just feel,” he whispered in my ear before I felt his hands on my arse, guiding his cock back inside me. Once he was fully seated, he slid his arms up over my own and pressed his chest against my back. I could feel his breath on my ear, and he began to talk to me. As the first words of filth were whispered from his mouth to my ear, he began to thrust.
Everything became this haze of want and need, and I just gave myself over to the sensations. After a moment, I looked up and met his eyes, “I need to touch you, Charlie, can I touch you?”
“Then tell them to go home. My Auror’s have their hands full tonight and probably for the next few nights. Tell them to turn themselves in at the Ministry on Wednesday, and I’ll process them myself and make sure Narcissa and Draco aren’t mistreated.”
Andromeda threw her arms around Narcissa and sobbed. She sat back and asked, “Are you all going to be arrested?”
“You have a large enough disaster here, and I fully intend to leave you with it. I have my family,” Harry said, waving his hand towards the Weasley clan, “and now I have three house-elves. Hermione will be thrilled about that, I’m sure. We’ll manage.”
Draco rolls his eyes, "Fuck his sensibilities, I'm getting up anyway," he says as he throws the last bit of sheet off him and stands up and heads off to the loo.
Harry panics, sitting straight up in the bed, “Fuck Gin, I didn’t mean to tell you like that.” Harry looks like he’s about to bolt from the bed.
“How can I help you, Mr Potter?” Narcissa asked, her tone sounding so genuinely respectful it shocked Harry for a moment, and he forgot what he had wanted to say to her.
“I think he’s enjoying himself, Fred,” George says a little breathlessly. George pulls his thumb from Harry’s mouth and guides his cock to Harry’s mouth. “Open up, Harry,” George says, rubbing the head of his cock slowly on Harry’s lips. Harry opens his mouth and sticks his tongue out, waiting for George to move forward. He feels the hard shaft of smooth, soft skin rub across his tongue, and Harry moans around George. Harry’s not really sure what he’s supposed to do here, but he tries to replicate the things he remembers being done to him before. “Fuck, Harry, your mouth feels good.”
Harry reached out and pulled Ginny into a hug. “Thank you,” he whispered in her ear. “I’m lucky to have you.” He pulled back from the hug and pressed a kiss to her forehead before breaking the muffling charm and heading to check on Hermione.
Harry had hoped that was the case. “I think that given your loyalty and your honour, you’re the perfect person to protect this house and my family within it.”
“Alright, fine,” Harry says, standing up and turning to where the back of his thighs was facing Hermione.
“Minister, do you really want to be involved?” asked Ron. Ron’s tone of voice clarified that he meant that their friend Kingsley would be more than welcome at Grimmauld, but that maybe it would be best if the Minister for Magic had nothing to do with hiding Harry Potter from the world.
Harry looked down at Teddy in his arms with a fond smile. “But helping the babies wasn’t punishment. It was nice to care for someone who needed help to survive, I let her think I hated it, but I never did.” Harry pressed a kiss on Teddy’s forehead. “Teddy’s only two weeks old, he’s the youngest infant I’ve ever held. I’m sure Winky will have a lot to teach me, and I know ‘Mione will find me lots of books to read on things like child development and child safety.” Harry turned to Hermione with a smirk.
It clearly wasn’t what Harry had expected her to say, and he was sure the confusion was evident on his face. “Um, okay. I think.” He paused for a moment, unsure what to say. “Pipsy, do you actually wish to belong to me, or are you just following Snape’s order?” Harry said.
The look on her face at his question told Harry he was not going to appreciate her answer, but that she thought it would be hilarious. She waited for Draco to take a sip of his tea before saying, "Sixth year."
“Before Bill’s wedding,” Harry said, ducking his head, “I’ll need to let him know now and that you’re okay with it. I promised him that I wouldn’t ever let that night hurt you.”
They lay down next to him, a tangle of limbs. Fred has had time to catch his breath, so he’s completely relaxed. George and Harry are panting and spent. As his breathing returns to return to normal, Harry looked to his left and his right, a twin lying on either side of him. He looks up at the ceiling of the room above them and says, “I think it’s safe to say I like blokes.” All three descend into laughter.
“That you will. Your tight little arse is going to feel so good as I stretch it open around my cock. Then once I’m inside you, I’m going to fuck you until you come again for me, and I’m going to keep fucking you until I’m done.”
“No, Mr Potter, after having him living in my home, I am most decidedly happy that you have defeated him.”
“Stop. You aren’t being selfish, and when is my plate ever empty, anyway? You’re right, you didn’t commit to Teddy, I did. I’m not asking you to become a mother at sixteen Gin, but I’d really like you to be an Aunt. I don’t want to lose you in my life, and your family is my family. A family I want Teddy to know too.”
He looked at me with desire, and it flooded my body with heat. He reached down and ran his hands from my shoulders to my thighs and back again. Sometimes flexing his hands and squeezing gently, other times dragging his nails, hard enough to mark, but ones that would fade, not linger.
“Fuck that’s hot,” Fred says.  He slides out from behind Harry, supporting his weight and lying Harry back onto the rug. Fred stands and removes the rest of his clothes then gets back down on the floor next to his brother. “Switch and strip,” he says. The moment George pulls his mouth of Harry’s cock, Fred takes his place. George strips quickly and watches Fred taking Harry’s length in and out of his mouth for a moment. “Still good, Harry?”
Hermione sighed. “Lay on the coffee table,” she said as she pulled a knife sharp enough to be considered a scalpel and a steel bowl from the bag. She used sterilising spells on the blade before she passed it to Ron. She set the bowl to hover next to Harry’s leg. “I left the Dittany on the dresser after I healed Ron last night. I need to go get it.”
Hermione and Harry were laughing so hard tears were in both their eyes when Draco and Ron finished their chess game.
This was supposed to be a one-shot that ended after Chapter 1.  Now it has taken on a life of its own.  There are more scenes in the works.  A few more that were mentioned in Ch1 (Harry/Draco after the Pensieve; Harry/Draco/Charlie), as well as some new ideas that took off on their own.
Draco groans. "Ugh. Does he know it clashes with his hair? Use that sickeningly powerful magic of yours to accio up a hangover potion from the kitchen."
Ron groans as they walk into the drawing-room. "C'mon Malfoy, time for chess. I'm at my limit for talking about sex with Weasley's for the day." Draco just laughs and heads for the chess table.
Harry looked at Hermione and signalled her to answer the question by waving his fork and giving a small nod of his head.
"Dragons are always in need of proper handling Potter," Draco says with an air of arrogance that just makes Harry laugh harder. "I'm going to the loo, send him off."
Though if he’d told his seventeen-year-old self, that in only two years time, he’d find out the keys to his happiness included parenting three children — a Snape, a Lupin, and a Malfoy at that — married to Draco Malfoy, founder of a half-billion galleon charity, and turning the Wizarding World on its ear with his political influence — seventeen-year-old Harry might have just stuck with becoming an Auror.
“Merlin,” Charlie interjected with a look that was a combination of shock and awe. “People don’t hitch rides on dragons for good reasons. You’re lucky it didn’t throw you from its back. Though I have heard rumours about the barbaric ways Gringotts treated the dragon, so I’m proud you liberated it.”
“That’s a good point. It’s not a complex spell. I don’t have to be the caster. I can teach one of you.”
“But they can’t have expected you to take him this young, and it’s not like Mrs Tonk’s is going to hurt him—” continued Ginny.
The two sat and looked at each other.  Harry didn't know where to start, so he just sat patiently for a few moments. After a time, he decided to just jump right into the issue. He said, “You don’t want me to raise Teddy, do you?”
Hermione chimes in, "Charlie and Gin I understand, but the twins Harry? While we were still in school? And yes, please do explain Bill too."
Once Harry was content that those he’s responsible for, and a few he wasn’t, were taken care of, he allowed himself to drift back to sleep, hoping that the lifeless eyes of Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore stayed out of his mind.
“Just who we were looking for. Have a seat, Potter. Granger and Weasley, you too.” McGonagall said as she transfigured seating for the five of them. Both older members of the Order looked as exhausted as Harry felt.
"I don't think I've ever realized how close you were to the two of them," said Ron. "But it makes sense.
His mouth fits right over her center and begins sucking in earnest. There’s no finesse in his movements, no teasing, he just goes right to what he wants. His nose grazes her clit as he swallows down the mix of their fluids that he’s sucking out of her. When the rush of fluids slows down, Harry pushes his nose harder into her clit. Ginny cries out, “Fuck Harry do that again.”
Ginny let go of Harry’s hands and put hers on either side of his face. She tilted his head until he could meet her eyes, though he hadn’t. “Look at me,” she said gently. Harry slowly met her eyes.
Hermione laughs. "Really, Ron, that's what got you talking?" Harry's also laughing now, and Draco's clearly smiling around his cup.
“I was hoping to take the Weasley’s back to Grimmauld Place with me, but the Fidelus is broken, and I’m sure the Death Eaters know its location,” said Harry with a fair bit of annoyance. All they’d done and been through, and his own home was still off-limits. It was frustrating.
Gin reads his reactions and body with skill, and it doesn’t take long before she’s milking his second orgasm of the day out of him.
"It can't be that bad from what I've heard he tripped and fell down the stairs and when his cousin went to help him up like a good boy that he is, Harry wanted nothing to do with him.
Without saying anything Severus picked up a box and tapped it with his wand, the placed the box back on the shelf.
Tom smiled at this he loved Draco like a nephew and he was beginning to see Harry as a son and hopefully soon he would be calling him dad or any other form of dad by this time next year if their plans all worked out that is.
"Hadrian it's alright now, I have you just breathe with me ok... in and out, in and out... That's it well done" said Severus as the pair sat on a bench in the shade of a oak tree.
He sighed quietly once, no sound could be heard from the outside of his door. Harry frantically got up, a little too quick, looking for his wand. The whole room was spinning from the little light of what he could see, he picked up his wand from under his pillow and cast a "Lumos". He looked at himself in the mirror, he had bags from no sleep, he had bruises everywhere and where he didn't his skin was deadly pale, he looked down right awful. He felt how tired he was from just standing so he gently took off his glasses and set them aside, with that he fell into a restless sleep.
He broke, he was crying like the world had finally ended, even though he now had his father, yes that was a hundred percent true but still, it was still so hard that his own biological relatives would do something like that in front of so many people.
"I think we are in trouble about mentioning about the kissing" sighed Severus as he leaned into Tom more.
"Now that's even more creepy than Gred and Forge. Otiz please don't do that again" said Harry making everyone laugh.
Lucius had loved every minute of watching Sirius be dragged around by his future son in law, if he had his way the two boys would at least have a consort ring on their fingers but alas Severus didn't want that to happen at the moment they were only 13 and 14 at the moment, maybe next years and before the start of their fifth year, but he would see them have those rings on sooner rather than later in his book.
It had been three hours since everyone had gone to bed but Harry was still up not liking how things were turning out.... he was in the Snakes Den now and it looked like Ron and Hermione..... they weren't his friends anymore..... he never wanted that, yes he wanted to be safe from those monsters but it looked like he had lost something yet again.... his first ever friends.
"Dinner readys now Master sirs" said a house elf that was called Pippin and so the three adults and two children as well as the hybrid all headed into the kitchen.
"Mister Snape will you release the spell now before it becomes dangerous" said Filius making both Otiz and Harry look up at him.
"How dare you put a silencing charm on me Percy Weasely! You had no right to do that to me! You are meant to be a Perfect! You have abused your power by casting that spell on me!" she shouted at the oldest ginger but he ignored her altogether.
"Minister what do I owe the pleasure on this fine day?" Tom asked with a smile on his face, jestering for Fudge to sit down.
Once everyone had read and re-read over Harry's results they knew that they had to inform the Ministry right away, they had to inform Cornelius Fudge about what Albus Dumbledore had done to the Saviour, what he had done to the poor boy but it could wait until tomorrow as they didn't want to wake the poor boy up, he was out cold on his father's shoulder snoring quietly.
"Well it appears that we had nothing to do with this as it sounded like it started when WE where outside when this all started" said George to his little sister.
"Oh hush you, it's not like you don't kiss Draco and don't say you don't Nagini has seen it" laughed Tom rubbing Otiz' back as he whimpered in his sleep.
Mooney was on the casp of being let forth weeks before the next full moon, he didn't want that to happen and so took a shaky breath and glared fully at the man who said that his cub was protected by blood wards.
There first stop was Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, the bell chimed that made Otiz giggle at the sound.
"Oh stop your gorking already! You know I'm a familiar I've just happened to of changed my age that's all" and he got up and left the classroom as the bell went for lunch.
"Thank you" Harry croaked out and gave Severus a smile and a nod, he then stood up to his full height which really wasnt much different when he was doubled over in pain, Severus smiled at him and they made their way into the bank.
Severus just nodded, taking a sip of his steaming hot coffee, he sighed and then turned to his son "I knew your mother when we were children, I was the one to tell her that she was a witch, your aunt wasn't happy that your mother could do something she couldn't" and he took another sip of coffee.
We all know that your grades are now a P so if you want to waste our time by keep saying you are the smartest witch it begs to differ.
"This will be boring" said Blaise but he knew it was just the start and didn't want to take much away from Harry and soon all the children were on the ride.
"You've lied to me and Severus! I can smell it on you, do you really think that you could get past my wolves instincts?? You smell bitter" Remus got up and left the office but waited by the Griffin for Severus.
With that Severus got up taking a hold of his son who was worn out but stopped and turned round, son in arms and said "before I forget I would like to add into this meeting one Filius Flitwick, one Pomona Sprout, one Minerva McGonagall and one Poppy Pomfrey" and with that he left.
It was hot outside, so they were both dressed in thin Muggle clothes, Harry in tan khaki shorts and a red and blue stripe t-shirt while Severus as in a pair of black trousers and a dark green top. Harry hadn't let him out of the house if he was wearing all black.
"Why am I here anyway in the Muggle World I mean?" asked Ron only for the three adults to look at him and then between themselves and it looked like Severus had drawn the short straw it seemed. ((Sorry Sevvy))
"I just want to go back home" whispered Ron to her, slumping his shoulders as he finally got his breathing under control.
Arthur returned home that night to Molly making dinner for just them and a small sandwich for her disgusting daughter.
Everyone was in shock that Albus was no longer Headmaster and that the Ministry had found someone so quickly at that to replace him.
Harry perked up at this, it had taken a while for him to understand that it was ok to get presents or even to ask for something he needed but after Severus as even the Malfoy's explained to him that it was ok he was slowing getting on board with the idea.
"I think you should stop that before I call over a member of the staff" said Severus right behind the whale known as Vernon Dursley.
"The Headmaster called for me when I was in Herbology, Madam Sprout told me to go and I was on my way to him when you caught me".
Severus and Tom looked at each other knowing something was up with the boy and they knew he would come to them, mostly Severus if anything was truly the matter.
"Mister Snape please go along with Mister Malfoy to the Headmasters office" said Filius but Harry's eyes went bulbous at this and shook his head.
She was about to pick it up when all of a sudden it jumped up and started writing, she took a look at what it was writing and noticed that it was a history report, on the Goblin Wars. As it wrote away she tuned to the dorm mate and asked "how long has this been happening?" only to get a reply of "since before Halloween in first year" meaning eighteen months and no one had cottoned onto it.
"Come on Dray get up, please" said Harry whining at the end of it all, he may be shy and withdrawn but he was stubborn as hell and everyone was finding out just how stubborn he really was.
Fawkes has fallen asleep on the back of his chair only to wake up when the person in front of the desk coughed slightly, making Tom drop his quill ruining the work he had been doing for the past hour.
Euphemia Cecilia Potter, Rose Mary Evans nee Wilson, Eileen Abigail Snape nee Prince (through adoption)
"Well I never in all my time here at Hogwarts have heard of something like this!" she was shocked more than anything until everyone at the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables stood up looking towards their Heads of Houses!
Three quarters of the way through class, most of the class gasp at this seeing only him transforming back and forth from one form to the other they had never seen a half transformation before.
"Nothing much he started it when he wouldn't listen to us when we said we had class, just walked the fuck away" said Ginny and Ron together.
"You Mr. Snape are lucky that your Animagus forms didn't hurt you, you have a clean bill of health, before you can leave which will be tomorrow so I can observe you, you need something to eat and drink".
It had been a harsh last of term, Harry hated every minute of it as the Weasels and Granger has he had now taking to call them as they wouldn't shut up about being adopted by Severus and no matter how they tried they couldn't get him back to Gryffindor Tower and away from the snakes of the dungeons.
"Miss Granger what we all saw was that firstly you accused young Mister Weasely about placing a spell on you which has been confirmed by the rest of the Gryffindor house to be in true, the you accuse me as well as threaten me for unknown reasons and the you attack your fellow student..
Severus had finally gotten Harry to uncurl himself and looked Ron in the eyes and before he said anything he ever so slightly whistled making Otiz come over to him but didn't calm down.
It was a start of a new day just before Halloween, Harry's most hated day if you asked him that is but on a different hand it meant that he could spend some time with his father and study in quiet.
"Well when you fell asleep I told both Narcissa and Lucius about what had happened and I told Draco to let by gones be by gones and I don't think he will without you saying anything."
"Thank you Mr. Weasley for that lovely bit of information about how you see me, plus also harassing a fellow student is worth detention with me. Miss Weasley, Miss Granger I would also like you to come to detention as well due to harassing a fellow student" all three gulped at the stoic voice behind him.
"Professor what is this all about?" asked Hermione to her only for her head of house to sigh and gathered her thoughts before she continued but before she could Hermione chimed up about her work and that she has asked other students if they could read them and they could but Minerva just sighed again.
I stepped a little closer to the boy "Harry it's quite alright. Do you know who I am?" I asked my voice gentle. Harry then looked up from the floor to stare at me, he was so confused "P-professor?" Harry's voice wavered, I only nodded. "Are you ok? Who did this to you?", Harry then became very interested in the floor, he then started to cry and god I wasn't sure what to do so I reached out and placed his hand under Harry's chin to lift it up. As soon as Harry looked up, he did something that surprised me and himself, he launched himself into my arms.
"Boys please this is getting us no where" smiled Filius to them, making them blush slightly and with that Otiz changed back.
I think with all of this you will be place in isolation where you will be given a child's quill and books so then you can do your school work, I will be in touch with the board of Governors to then they can get you a personal tutor that will only give you the bare minimum of help teaching you.
"Pro-professor, it is really you?" asked Harry only to have Severus smile a true smile making him smile back towards the man sitting next to him.
I'll be drawing new front covers for the stories as I'm trying to find one where I can put our SMOL bean on as well.
"Harry, Harry it's time to get up" said Severus as he tried to wake the boy but said boy just hugged harder and nuzzled into his side more. Severus just smiled at him and slowly tried to get out of the tight hold on his waist.
"Severus I need to know as his former Head of House I would like to know why one of my favourite lions has turned into a snake and your son at that" she retaliated to her ex student and work colleague.
I would of cast it if I knew where Narcissa would send us through the Floo but sadly I did not so I had no time to cast it" and he got up only for Otiz to transform.
Harry took a deep breath and nodded towards the Goblin who passed the dagger to Severus so then he could help Harry.
Percy had been reading next to Bill, Charlie and Dora had gone to look at other stalls as they didn't want to sit around on this fine day waiting for everyone to make up their minds on where they were going to go next.
She nodded and started to cry quietly... "yes Professor it's true these are mine, I was selling answers to the other students" but she mentioned nothing about the self writing quills.
"Oh I don't think so Potter you better get up from there right now before I do something to you in front of everyone" sneered Ron making Hermione nod her head.
"Will you stop staring at the other tables Ronald and finish your breakfast you have class to get to" snapped Percy bringing practically everyone in listening range to look at the youngest male Weasely.
"Severus what on earth has happened here?" she asked but Severus just shook his head "Minerva I will come and tell you at a later date, now if anyone needs me I'll be in my chambers with my son for the rest of the night" and he walked off into the dungeons.
"We came home and Hadrian went into his room, placing a barrier around it due to his emotions, I tried to get in but it was Otiz that broke it letting us both in. I think.
"You're an idiot but your my idiot" said Severus once Tom finally let him go, they continued to watch the film and many more as well eat the chocolates late into the night.
He would never get a his education, a job or anything in the Wizarding World he was now and for ever more be a Squib... his magic was now locked and he would never be allowed to use it ever again.
"Ronald, Ginevra I think you have both forgotten what mum had told you in the Howler she had sent a few weeks back. I will write to her about everything that I personally have witnessed and about other things that have been brought to my attention by other students.
Everyone looked at him and laughed hard thinking that they had heard wrong but before they could ask anymore questions Severus stepped thorough the portrait leading to his office and then onto his private quarters.
"Severus calm yourself she is gone now" said Minerva to the distraught man, slowly but surely he calmed down.
This made Harry laugh at it all, after Draco Otiz loved the twins the best and he always helped with their pranks.
They sat there for a while and even though the rest of their dorm mates were by this time asleep their minds were racing, they tried to sleep but nothing worked and so they got up and started plotting for the rest of the night.
"You got that off dad and you know it Otiz" this made everyone laugh as they knew it was correct as they had many a times that he would steal Severus' coffee at breakfast in the great hall.
Slowly he got up only for him to whimper more than before and so looking at the time seeing that it was seven in the morning woke up his son.
"Come on you two let's go and get something for the hyper one" and he led them to the under tens section of the store.
"Oi wake the hell up!! Daddy, Mummy make the stupid thing wake up!" he yelled to his parents, Harry was still shaking behind his father but let go as Severus walked over to them.
"Ups!" screamed Otiz to the group, making people look at the group and the small boy who by now had tears in his eyes.
"Professor we were halfway down to your class when Granger and Weasely stopped us, saying that Hadrian there shouldn't be in Slytherin and that Professor Dumbledore would happily sort him back, Weasely then grabbed his elbow and started to pull him".
"So how come is it taking you fore..." Otiz threw some clothes out again "...now I know" said Tom as he sighed at the child hybrid.
Bill and Charlie looked a tad scary with Bill with his long hair and dragon tooth necklace and three claw marks across his face and Charlie with his weather beaten face calluses and blisters all over his hands which didn't seem to bother him that much at all.
With a sigh Otiz got up from the floor from where he was sitting after he had changed back and headed back into the common room.
"Or maybe a bottle for the nap?" said Phineas Black and everyone laughed at the two headmasters commenting on Albus.
"Come on then I see a nice café just up the road from here" said Lupin and so the three followed the werewolf into the café.
"But you still told!" Harry almost screamed but once he took in all the information that he was given he knew, even though he hadn't spent much time with the Weasely's he knew Molly would follow through.
"Theodore Nott I'm sorry for trying to attack you. I didn't mean it honest to Merlin I didn't, I was annoyed at something but let's say Hadrian can be very convincing if he flicks my nose in animal form" said Otiz hand on the back of his own neck blushing slightly.
"These could just be accidents that have happened over the years with his family, nothing more. Harry please go back to Gryffindor now, there's a good lad" said Albus but Harry didn't move he just looked at his father asking if he should go.
"You dare touch my son with your hands and I will call the authorities here right now. Plus I think that you are upsetting everyone else here who have come to enjoy a day out with their friends and family".
Everyone got ready but the stranger just stayed at the back of the class watching and waiting for anything that would happen to Harry and his friends.
"Don't even think about it, you attacked Hardian verbally while you Weasely attacked him, even if it was grabbing him and pulling him".
"Well this is my oldest Bill then Charlie with his girlfriend Nymphadora, you know everyone else" said Molly pointing to the three people Harry had never met before.
Tom knew that his Potions Master as able to posion you without you even knowing as he had asked him many a time to do that.. he had to admit it was fun to watch the snivelling whelps gasp their last breath.
"I'm professor should we go? It seems you have something to talk about, come on guys" said Harry to his friends it was then Sirius noticed Harry's uniform.
Finally back at Hogwarts, we walk down to the dungeons, this must be so confusing for Harry, he had never been in this part of the dungeons. I know I shouldn't but I stopped abruptly making Harry almost bump into me, he could only look up at me and wonder why and I whispered "Horned Serpent".
"If he's giving him chocolates he should be fine" said Harry making the group laugh ing as they had a feeling Tom would use that, they had all seen Severus eat a lot of chocolate when he was down or just in the mood and thought no one was watching him.
While Tom was trying to get forgiveness from Severus everyone else had decided to go to Hogsmeade for the day as it was the weekend.
It had been a week since Otiz had become human and it looked like he would stay that way for a while, he was a happy little six year old by normal means but with the consent hair colour changes and his fox ears and tail appearing out of nowhere it was becoming a chore to make him sit still.
Otiz curled around him and was soon asleep, Poppy kicked out the two adults and Draco stating that the poor boy needed rest and that he would be back in time for breakfast the following morning.
The Dursley's looked at the two new people before them, seeing that it was a member of the reptile staff as well as a security guard they quickly held their breath.
Minerva got there just before Severus started to tell everyone about what had happened to Harry only to stop in her tracks when she heard Harry crying into Severus.
"C..ca...can I ge..get him?" asked Harry only to have Severus nod to him and they walked over to the teller and all she said was "no one has been able to get close to him, he's quite rare really, its a first since I've working here that he's picked someone" and the kitten just mewed to them sleeping happily.
"Harry just leave them, I bet Dumbledore would be happy to transfer you back to Gryffindor now if we go" said Hermione pleading now.
I wish we could but they are keyed to his emotions. Let him calm down slightly before you try anything. Promise me that Otiz."
"What's going on? I'm so confused by all of this" said Harry looking at his friends and family, Otiz was beside himself really to explode if he could that is, Harry wouldn't put it passed him to some how combust.
In parseltongue Harry his a thank you as well but he added papa onto it making said man blush but didn't say anything to the pre teen.
They have the ability to shape shift into human forms and love to play tricks, they are also faithful guardians, friends, lovers and partners.
"Why Harry is here to celebrate the holiday with us Ron, why else would be be here for?" said Arthur to his son afterwards looking at Harry.
They were just waiting for the magic to calm down before they let him off the table and back into the room where he had changed so then he could rest for a bit before they did the blood adoption.
"Oh Merlin! Sev I'm so sorry I don't think it would be that bad! Honest I didn't" said Tom trying to get Severus to understand him somewhat.
His father had finally someone to love other than him but they were father and son nothing more, they had spent a whole night talking and it turned out that Severus had known his mother and they were best friends until he had called her something that he had promised never to repeat to another living soul as it was a very dirty and derogative word to any living soul that he came across if they were born to non magical parents which happened to be..........
Ok peeps I need some ideas on how Fred and George are going to play some pranks for their younger siblings.
"...let's say that on November 16th at 10am a court case was held, I will not tell you anything that has happened but I will say this that Headmaster Dumbledore has been put into house arrest.." everyone gasped besides the ones that knew what happened.
"Severus you mean Harry here is adopted by you?" interjected Remus shocked, he knew Severus would explain everything to him at a later time as they couldn't when they met up but it was now all coming out.
Many wanted to leave her there but it would look so bad if another teacher would come in and see her and so with great reluctance Madam Pinch called for a house elf to bring her to the Hospital Wing.
"I go Hog'art, go on twain woo woo, play at 'ubledore! Tev room, mak 'otion with Hadwin!" this made the older males happy and laughed, lastly they headed to the stuffed animals.
Otiz growled but only Harry and Severus heard but stopped when Amelia Bones entered and sighed she had no reason why this was taking place as everything that she had seen was in fall working order.
"Minister if e could get onto this, I have left poor Minerva and Severus to deal with the school and the still mountains of paper work that needs to be completed. They don't mind really but they still have their own work to complete and I sadly don't want to waste anymore time" said Tom making Fudge nod.
"I've managed to get them to do all my homework while I just sit there doing nothing and taking all the credit!" and she laughed evilly, something that would even make He Who Shan't Be Named be happy with.
The wolf stayed put in Harry's lap and didn't want to move, Otiz wasn't too happy about this new pup on his familiar but it was just a stuffed animal of sorts, he wasn't sure.
Ron got up noticing that his wasn't even the Burrow how did he get here? Who were those girls? Where was he? What was he to do here?
"We have put you here due to you attacking your fellow students, your grades have dropped so much that you are so far behind, we will be getting you a tutor to help you catch up" said Tom as he took a drink of water.
"What in Merlin's name, why would they care, when I found the poor boy he was being to an inch of his life, if I hadn't of gone to him he would of been dead, so much for the greater good if the Saviour of the Wizarding World ended up dead!" yelled Severus making Harry flinch and held on tightly to his father.
Go on you two get out of my hair for a while, I have to tackle this paperwork and hand it to the ministry by the end of he day, we keep finding more and more paperwork that the old coot never completed.
Harry sat down and right away Hedwig left Severus and went right over to Harry and rubbed against him hooting a happy tune, not long afterwards they both headed up to the Great Hall for breakfast.
"So Miss Weasley please elaborate?" asked Severus using the most intimnating voice he would use in the classroom, making the young lion shake even more than necessary.
"Now lets leave my "poor" cousin alone while he rests in his room until tomorrow as I don't think he would be able to eat or drink anything until tonight or better yet tomorrow morning" said Narcissa to them as the two of the carried Sirius to his and Remus' room to rest for the night.
This was when Harry and Draco notice that Otiz wasn't next to them and Harry started to panic.. Otiz was always there with him but now he wasn't.
Their friends had decided on this even before they had planned to go with the two, as a new couple just starting out they needed time and space to grow, even though Otiz would be following them around he was their for protection more than anything.
Hermione went to her dorm room to start on her homework for the night, she had Charms, DADA as well as Potions to complete.
"Finally I've been trying to get up to the Headmasters office for what an hour now and the stupid thing won't budge! I've said all the sweets I know but it won't let me up" she said matter of factly.
"I know something must be up for them to act this way" said Theo getting up and heading to the dorm room only to be met with a snarling Otiz pacing back and forth, he could understand what he was saying he wouldn't be screaming right now.
Oh how they wished they could kill the bushy haired girl within their dorm/common room, they had had enough of the girl who was telling at anyone she could find about trying to get Tom removed from the position of Headmaster and reinstate Albus of all things.
"No Lucius and I don't know what to so with it all, we have tried potions but he still ends up being ill" sighed Severus finally letting Harry go and he went to hug Draco and slightly gave him a kiss to his cheek which ended up with both of them blushing Weasely red which earned a muffled laugh from Narcissa.
They spent another half and hour looking at clothes and toys for Otiz who was completely out cold on Severus' shoulder snoring away.
"So'ry 'minoe but I 'ave got som'whe'e I 'ave to be" and he closed the door and walked away, he wanted to be alone for a while to get his thoughts together.
"Sit eat, then back to your room, Ginerva" said her father  after Molly placed her sandwich in front of her while she placed hers and Arthur's in their places which was a small roast.
"Professor what about my classes today?? The new term as only just started I can't miss out on any classes" said Harry but Severus just smiled to him and informed him that all the teachers were aware that he wouldn't be attending lessons today and that a sub has been brought in to cover as well and so Severus grabbed a hold of Harry and they apparated to Gringotts
Everything was ruined! How did they do this! How did they come up with these potions or spells and place it on them!
Ginny was taken away for the day so then she could 'earn her keep' which everyone was happy about as she in Draco's terms which were a waste of space, out of sight out of mind in everyone else's view and Harry was happy about it the same with Otiz, he had decided to be in teenager form as he wanted to go on some of the faster more exciting rides that the park had to offer.
"The reason why I'm like this this is because I am exactly one year older than Hadrian here, he is thirteen while I'm fourteen but I am still classed as a baby from where I come from and what I am.
How could two red heads be related to his Fed, 'orge and Pert? He would never know. Luna was nutty and Neville was sweet and kind and let him help with his plants thanks to his magic. He only got to know them as Severus had allowed Harry to invite some friends over.
He started crying he was missing them all of his family, his friends and his teachers including Snape the would rather do detention in Potions then be here.
"Would you be alright with me becoming your legal guardian?" Severus asked a little uncertain, he wasn't going to lie, he was very nervous about Harry's answer. Harry looked over joyed that he, again, ran into Severus' arms, Severus could feel Harry nodding against his chest "I take that as a yes" Severus chuckled "bring whatever you may need or want with you. I will shrink them down and put them in my robe" Severus said, Harry only nodded.
"Thomas we aren't going to give all the information on how to get back into Sev's good books, you said you weren't going to let that thing out of isolation and you did anyway! Look what she had don't to Hadrian, watch the memories of what she has done to the stidents! You didn't listen to him and now you have to work everything else out yourself" and he laughed and he dragged Harry off so then the so called Dark Lord could work everything else out himself.
"Professor can't you get that thing out of the castle, I thought that we were only allowed to bring a cat, owl, rat or a toad with us how come Potter has something else?" asked Hermione.
Petunia jumped when she noticed who it was and almost screamed but didn't want to bring too much attention to her "perfect" family.
"For the last time Granger his name is Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape and if I catch you falling him anything else I will bite your head cleanly off" snapped Otiz, he changed into a wolf size version of his animal form to protect them better as Werewolf Remus came into view.
Harry apologised to him but Severus said "it's alright. The reason I'm here is to take you out of this household but before I do I have one question" Harry nodded to this.
Broken bones, infections not treated, which could explain his overly bad eye sight even James Potter's eyesight wasn't that bad, malnourishment, dehydration, weak muscles, bruises, burns, cuts, grazes it continued like this up to the present date and how they weren't picked up by Poppy was beyond him.
I stood in the doorway until I saw that Harry's breathing had died down, once sure Harry was asleep I cast a healing spell, hopefully that would make things better and crack Harry's door, so I could hear in case of emergencies. I was just about to fire call Albus when I heard a muffled cry followed by a scream, god I've never ran so fast in my life. All this worry making him feel nauseous.
"What brings everyone here? Just before dinner I might add?" she asked them, the dorm mate of Hermione stepped forward and told her everything that had happened over the last school year and how Hermione was using a self writing quill and selling answers to everyone within the school. Other students told her of the bullying that the younger Weasely's and Granger had been dong to poor Harry, getting a cheap way out of homework by getting answers of Hermione.
"School funs! Mowwy come and had go at wed hair boy and girl and fuzzy head girl, I no like them. Wed head boy mean to Hadwin! Me tack him but stop when Mowwy come, she nice" said Otiz, after that he started to play with the toys again as he had finished eating and his drink was now dry.
Severus called for a house elf for some fire whiskey, just one mind you he did have to look after Harry as well as teach tomorrow.
"Father who is coming to visit us anyway?" he asked only for his mother to smile slightly at him and then turn to Lucius speaking an unspoken question to him, with his nod his mother explained.
"Hadwin!" cried the boy who ran up to him and flung himself into Harry's lap who made himself comfortable, he pulled Mooney into his arms and smiled.
"The Headmaster has asked for you, me and Professor Lupin to his office, by default Otiz is coming along because he would go on a rampage if we leave him alone" and he brought Harry up to the Headmasters office.
Otiz came into the clearing in his teenage form followed close behind by Harry and Draco, Otiz looked pissed to say the least at having to follow Harry of all people into something so dangerous that it was going to cost him his life if he wasn't careful, knowing Severus the boy would be grounded.
They had a whole floor to themselves which had six rooms, the last one they decided that if the boys wanted a sleep over that would be the room for them to do that.
Thank Merlin for Draco and his friends... or should he now say friends as since then they have helped him in calming him down and homework, plus they always stuck with him with everything he did.
"Today we will be practicing the Cheering Charm, this charms make the person the spell is used on feel elated but if it's over used they will have fits of hysterical laughter, this could also be used as a counter charm to the hiccoughs" explained Filius to everyone and then he demonstrated the wand movement making sure that it was slow enough for them to follow.
"I said it would of been better if he took my hand in first year ok!" and he was about to walk out when Narcissa closed the door with her wand, "run that by us again Draco" she wasn't happy.
Tom helped Harry pack everything making sure or doubly sure that he had everything, Otiz by then had left the bedroom and headed to the potion's lab where Severus was checking everything off that he would bring with him for the new term as not to waste them and he put everything else under a very powerful stasis spell he would ask his House Elves: Yahtzee, Boris and Mink to check on them every month to then they could send them over to be used if the spell was weakening.
Another Hufflepuff stood up and also slapped him but it was more of a punch than anything his name was Zander Wilson-Letcher and he was a seventh year and a Perfect at that!!
Otiz growled the whole time they walked back to Hogwarts no one had ever seen him like this before, besides when Dumbledore, Ron, Ginny and Hermione were around but as far as they knew Dumbledore was in Azkaban, Ron was now a Muggle, Ginny was at home being a slave to the family and Hermione was in isolation, so why was he acting like this?
Everyone came out of the memory and then looked at Harry who was now almost asleep on the small sofa being watched over still by the officer.
I watch as Harry only grabbed three things: a picture of Lily, his wand and his robe. "Is that all you're bringing?" I ask unsure. "This is all I own sir" Harry mumbled, by this time I was fuming, how cold these stupid muggles do this to Lily's son? But didn't let my anger show, I don't to scare Harry. "Harry I need you to hold onto me, we are going to apparate". Once this was said, Harry came over to Severus and took a hold of his arm and they apparated to Hogwarts.
Before he could say anything and leave the zoo the man insisted and so Severus brought his son over to the stuffed animals.
Otiz looked at himself and then how Harry was sitting, he was pushed up against the stone wall in a chair away from everyone else and he was standing over him, glaring at anyone that he thought would be dangerous to the boy.
"What was that for!" he asked annoyed only to have two identical devil smiles placed in two identical faces.
"Hadrian come on you have to eat something" said Draco for the fifth time since they had sat down but he was just pushing his food around the late that Draco had filled for him with his favourite breakfast foods including pumpkin juice that he had only a sip of.
"He was at home with me" said Severus who looked to Harry who now had his hand firmly in Otiz's fur, trying to calm down.
"Draco I have no idea why you both are at each other's throats all the time but this will stop, right away. This is not how a Malfoy should act" again his father sneered at him, making the boy nod.
Lucius looked at the boy in awe he had never seen Otiz like this, he looked like a blue haired green eyed Severus when he was a teenager.
"So I lost the only thing that is or was James, the only I cared about for ten years was to get close to my godson, my little Bambi".
The female Nymphadora was strange her hair kept changing every colour of the rainbow while Charlie kept hold of her.
The new first years didn't know what was happening but they were afraid of what was going to be said.
Severus took his wand and put it to his head and pulled out a whisper from his head and placed it in the Pensieve, then everyone dipped their fingers in only to be pulled into the memory, Harry was left behind in the office with another Ministry officer.
They all hoped that they would see this side of the man more, Harry on the other hand they were just happy to see him fully enjoying himself like any normal child would regardless of their up bringing, yes he had one of the worst but seeing him acting like the other boys and Tonks they were happy.
Once inside the common room Marcus Flint stepped forward and asked or rather said with a nasty smirk "why the great Harry Potter is finally in the Snake's Den...." this made everyone laugh besides Draco of course.
He shy but once you get to know the real him I think you three will find that Hardian is a pucker young man that needs some guidance from some older brothers".
If there is any then we will go straight into a cleansing to rid everything and anything, then once that is done we will be able to go ahead with the blood adoption" explained Griphook to the boy who had now moved into the spare chair next to his father, everyone else was sitting behind them, waiting, wondering what was going to be found.
Narcissa saw what she was going and pointed it out to Molly and Arthur as they wanted to know what she would do.
The rest of the group also looked round but didn't find it appealing and so they waited for Otiz to finish what he was doing only to find that he had picked up some Frog Spawn Soap, a nose biting tea cup and many, many dung bombs..
"Otiz as you know both me and Hadrian went to the zoo today as it was only the second time he has been there but as we were in the reptile house, Hadrian and I ran into some people we both never wanted to see" explained Severus to the hybrid who nodded.
As everyone looked over the file, some having to re-read everything their anger grew towards the Headmaster! How could he let this happen to the boy!
"Get off me goof!" said Harry as he finally got up from his bed after Otiz had fallen on him three time since he had woken up ten minutes ago.
Harry was a shell of himself and both of them knew it, he didn't want anything but someone to keep him from harm more than anything else in the world, he wanted to be hugged tightly but at the same time he hated to be touched, he wanted to gorge himself in food but he had tried that once before and ended up throwing up all over the place, his stomach not used to that much food.
I was about to leave but felt a tiny hand grasped my wrist, I looked back confused when Harry then asked "Sir, um... can I er sleep with you?" Harry stuttered. I only nodded and picked the boy up, I'm shocked at how light the twelve year old was, he's twelve but he weighs that of a seven year old if that, I walk to my room and slowly laid Harry down on the bed, covered him up, carefully trying not to wake him, I don't know why I did this but I placed a light kiss on the top of Harry's head and then slowly eased myself onto the bed and turned on my side, I dimmed the lights and looked at Harry once more before sleep overtook me.
He was cut off by a fourth year "what the hell!!" but with one look he stopped only a whimper coming from Snape's robes, Harry had resorted to hiding again like he did at the Malfoy's and his friends.
Blaise was one for friendly banter as well as a good tutor in his school work he helped out the group in things they were stuck on, mind you Harry did do only slightly better than him in some lessons and then there was Theodore Nott.
You are confined to you dorm room until your parents have been contacted, I know your brother Percy would have written to them as well" said Minerva to the girl making eye contact with Severus by the door.
"Well Headmaster I will yet again inform the Ministry on how you have acted with my son again as each time he comes into contact with you, he seems to have a panic attack.
At this he stopped as tears were beginning to fall, Otiz right away started to lick his face to calm him down, taking another breath he started up again.
"You have a dislocated elbow Mister Snape, now I would recommend that you stay as still as possible so then I can realine it, sadly it will hurt but with complete rest for the next few days it should be completely healed" Harry nodded to her about it all and held fast.
"But why is he being treat differently then the rest of us!" Ron almost screamed to her but she just put her hand up and said "be careful Mister Weasely I have it known that both you and Miss Granger there have already lost points and have gained detention due to what you have done to Mister Snape's arm at the moment. If you want again to lose points as well as earn another detention I would kindly remind you to sit back down and be quiet".
Otiz got up from where he was laying and jumped up onto the arm of the chair and nuzzled the boy, trying to make sure he was ok.
"Harry my love come to me right now, we are meant to be together forever, it has been set in motion since we were born" said Ginny to him.
"Young Heir Prince if you would do the honours of drinking the whole goblet to complete the blood adoption" said Griphook once he saw Harry's face.
"....yes, yes I would like to know why he is now with you. I would also like to know why the twins here are pranking everyone and not getting into trouble for it by their own head of house" turning to the twins right away.
Kingsley offered to have someone else take care of Harry’s task, but Harry refused. After everything the man had done to keep him alive, he needed to see to it personally. Harry and Ron left the office and went to the Shack. They brought Snape back to the Great Hall, while Kingsley and McGonagall taught Hermione how to cast the Fidelius Charm.
Harry sits up on his elbows to uncork and drink his potion.  The relief is immediate.  His headache is gone, his nausea is gone, and his energy returned. "Ugh. That's vile. Why do you insist on making them taste like licorice?"
Draco took the wand from Harry and nodded as he turned to walk back to his seat next to his mother. “I have one thing to do before I come back for you, Mrs Malfoy. I won’t be long.” She bowed her head in acknowledgement again, and Harry walked away.
He knew when he had to decide between Hallows and Horcruxes, two things that damn near any other wizard in the world thought were a myth or knew nothing of at all, and yet he had to choose which was more likely to help him defeat Voldemort — at seventeen.
Harry looks at Draco to see the amused look on his face while his oldest friends are thinking. Draco mouths, "Hermione," at Harry to which Harry mouths back, "Ron."
“Well, sixth year, I had a feeling I might fancy blokes, and I already knew I fancied you. But there was so much going on, and I didn’t have time to experiment like a normal teenager. And the twins offered themselves as test subjects.”
Once their first coupling has ended, they both lay back on Harry’s bed catching their breath. Harry says to himself, “that was a bit different from blokes, but I liked it.”
"There was never any romantic attachment with them, we never dated or anything of the like. But the twins helped me in ways the two of you couldn't. The three of us were in the war together, from the beginning to the end. I mean, we became friends trying to escape a Mountain Troll at the age of eleven for Merlin's sake. We were never going to be typical. The twins were touched by the war too, but they were still mostly carefree. They were able to be my friends, without all the baggage and weight.  I could feel like a normal kid when I hung out with them, even if it were only for a few minutes."
Harry didn’t want the attention that going back to Hogwarts would bring, not to mention, he knew how much chaos they’d left behind when they came here yesterday. “I doubt she’s had a single break with everything we left behind at Hogwarts. I don’t care if it hurts. Can you fix it?”
Ginny is still wet from their earlier session, and the added lubrication from Harry’s come still inside her ensures that his entry will be smooth. Ginny cants her hips and slides backward slowly, lining up his erection with her entrance. She breaks the kiss throwing her head back as Harry’s cock slides inside her in one smooth movement. Harry growls as the feeling of soft wet heat surrounds him. He tilts his head forward, sucking one of her breasts deep into his mouth, then backs off slowly until her nipple is the only thing left between his teeth.  He increases the pressure until Ginny gasps and groans from the blend of pain and pleasure. It’s his turn to gasp as she seats herself as far down as she can.
Andromeda’s head rose at that. She looked at Harry without letting go of her sister’s hands. “You really did it, Harry? You saved us all?”
Ginny laughed again, “Come on Harry, you know you want a large family. You won’t want Teddy to be an only child, you’ll want him to have brothers and sisters the way you didn’t. I’m smart enough to know that.”
"Of course, it's possible. What kind of hack Potions Master do you take me for?" Harry laughs as breakfast appears in front of everyone. "Don't you dare tell Severus' portrait though, I'll never hear the end of it."
Then he muffled the conversation to tell him that the Malfoy’s were turning themselves in, that’s why they were still there, but that first he needed to take Narcissa with him to speak to her sister.
“I’ll talk to George, Charlie, and Bill. We’re all pretty honest and open with each other anyway. You won’t get any issues from them. Percy isn’t stupid enough to cross you anymore, and Ron, well, if he actually figures anything out, you can explain it to him,” Ginny says with a wink.
Kreacher had a look of confusion on his face as he said, “House-elves are never used as secret keepers, Master.”
Harry snickers at the twins, and takes another drink of whiskey. He lets the warm burn flow down his throat and settles into his belly.
Harry reaches out and slides his arm around Ginny’s waist, “You’re always welcome in my bed Gin. Standing invitation. Dating or not. I don’t plan to try any exclusive relationships any time soon. Opening up to others emotionally is going to be my biggest struggle. The circle of people I trust is very small.”
Harry leans back for a moment to look at Draco, "Hermione, or Granger, in my kitchen for breakfast. No titles, okay?"
“Okay, Andi. Okay.” Narcissa knelt up from where she’d been sitting back on her heels and encircled Andromeda in her arms.
He knew when he had to figure out where a sociopathic narcissistic Dark Lord had stashed the remaining pieces of his soul before he could destroy him for good.
“Almost there, Harry, just hold on.” The fingers are removed, and Harry feels cold slick lube quickly rubbed around his opening. He feels a blunt pressure as Fred starts to push the head of his cock past the tight ring of muscle. Once his head pops through the resistance, Harry gasps, but doesn’t let go of George.
Harry just nodded. He slid Draco’s Hawthorne wand from his pocket and held it out to Draco, “I believe this is yours.”
"Oh, hush you. There's no denying Charlie's the sexiest of the Weasley boys, and you're hot. I'm perfectly happy with my Weasley of choice, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate beautiful things.  Now spill."
"If you want a night to forget about it all. I'll give you that. I can make your body sing, and you can forget your name, if only for a bit. But you can never hurt my sister with this, Harry."
George lays down on his back on the rug and throws a glance at Fred, “Help him over here, I want to suck your come from him.”
Harry replied quickly, “No! I promised I wouldn’t, and I didn’t hide anything. I mean, I have a scratch ‘Mione, from sliding off the dragon. It’s not even bleeding, I’m fine.”
I use Snape at Hogwarts as it's easier plus if Albus found out he would try to use the Prince name for unjust means" and he sighed again, this made Harry shift slightly.
He tried to move only to have something..... or someone groan at him from his side, looking down he could see a mop of dark hair sticking up from underneath his deep dark covers of his bed, he smiled at the child who was holding onto him for dear life.
The small ginger's wand being snapped was her, the brother losing his magic; that being bound; and being brought into the Muggle World, the old fart now being in Azkaban where he truly belongs and now the wench!
"Would it be alright if I become your legal guardian" Harry launched himself into his arms again "I take that as a yes then? Bring whatever you made need or want with you and I will shrink it down" Harry nodded and grabbed only three things.
"Hadrian listen to me and listen well my son, the young Mr. Weasely and his sister will not harm you and I can assure you that with their older brothers looking out for you as well as Otiz and myself you will be fine".
"Hadrian go and see Poppy about your elbow and then come back to our chambers" this made his son nod and all three boys walked out of the office and made their way down to see Poppy.
This made everyone look at the bird only to have Hedwig start hooting along with the other bird and then Tyki took flight just as the door to the compartment opened to reveal the Weasels and Granger.
"Young Mr. Weasely I would appreciate that you stop now otherwise I have no idea what Hadrian's familiar will do to protect him. Also as he is my son I would like to kindly ask you to stop" and he straightened up and looked Ron right in the eyes.
"Miss Granger you are to head to your next lesson now but I will have to say you will be in detention with Professor Flitwick today after dinner for missing his lesson, I will inform him of it as it was me that caught you out of class" said Tom getting up and directing her to the door.
He snarled again and this time he had had enough and went to attack Hermione due to the racket that was coming out of her month it was upsetting his cub more and more and it was they only way to protect him.
Andromeda froze in place, still holding on to Teddy but not moving. Narcissa stepped forward and gently took Teddy from her arms, and passed him over to Harry. She ushered Harry toward the sofa, then gently guided her sister from the door in the same direction.
Two years later, when he reflected on the decision he made during the time he spent at Bill and Fleur’s, Harry realised that he had found that better way without much effort.
"You're no fun," Harry says with a fake pout. He summons t-shirts for himself, and Draco then heads toward the stairs.
I slumped bonelessly back to the table, took a few panting breaths then managed to say, “That was bloody fucking amazing.”
When Draco walks back into the bedroom, Harry is already pulling on a pair of green satin pajama bottoms.  He passes a matching pair in midnight blue to Draco, who slides them up his slender hips. Harry's watching with an undeniable hunger in his eyes. "Breakfast downstairs first. Then I'm bringing you back up here for second breakfast," Harry says with a leer.
The twin in front of him is holding his own erect cock and stroking it slowly. The twin behind him slides one finger inside him but doesn’t stop his constant attack with his tongue. The twin at his head reaches down for Harry’s chin and pulls his head up slightly, then pushes his thumb in between Harry’s open lips. Harry sucks the thumb into his mouth, and he hears a groan from in front of him.
His hands went to either side of my waist, and I found myself being raised and dropped onto his cock. My arms rested on top of his, and my hands lay gently on his shoulders. I wasn’t holding myself up in any way, his arms had me securely. As he increased the speed he was using to impale me on his cock, I threw my head back against the wall and panted. It didn’t take long for my orgasm to build back up. I started to reach down to touch myself, but Charlie changed tactics again before I could.
Ginny reaches over the side of the bath for her wand. She sets the tub to drain, running clean water to rinse them both off. Then climbs out of the tub, waiting for Harry to follow. She waves her wand with a quick-drying charm, then pulls Harry towards her. “Talk time’s over lover boy,” she says as she reaches down and wraps her hand around his still soft cock giving him a quick squeeze.  She turns on her heel and walks towards the bedroom, calling out over her shoulder, “I have much more interesting things to do with your mouth.”
Ron's face lost all its color. "I just realized what you were talking about up there. Merlin. Which Weasleys would have climbed in the bed, Harry? Just how many Weasley's have you buggered?"
Bill, who looked very interested in the spell, replied, “That’s bloody brilliant. You’ll have to teach me that one.”
“I’m sorry, I forgot all your clothes are in the bag,” she said as she opened the bag and started pulling Harry’s clothes from it.
“Not that, I just know those two don’t do anything halfway, and that they’re hedonistic little buggers.”
Harry was outspoken about Snape, his role, about how he had never been who they all thought he was. Harry let both McGonagall and Shacklebolt know in no uncertain terms that he wouldn’t rest until Snape’s name was cleared, and by the end of the conversation, Harry received commitments from them both to help Harry with that task.
“If you wish it, Pipsy will comply. Master Severus taught me that intent was the core of respect, not titles. He bade me to use Master with him because it wasn’t always clear who was watching him.”
“Master Severus taught me many things that House Elves are not usually taught,” Pipsy said with a look on her face that Harry thought might be pride. He tried imagining the bitter, angry man trying to teach this diminutive creature and found that he couldn’t see it.
Kingsley chuckled. “I think you’re likely to be on the good side for quite some time. So maybe I can hold on to the Ministry, and there can finally be some positive changes made.”
She hugged her for a few moments, then she sat back again and told Andi that Harry would take Teddy back to Aunt Walburga’s for a while.
"When Draco started spending the night, I turn the arrival alert back on. I don't use it because I don't worry about the two of you being in my house while I'm vulnerable, and no one else has access. The alert gives Draco time to head out, or get under my cloak before you made it up the stairs."
Ginny laughed too. “Well, I mean, definitely not Percy or Ron and Bill already has Fleur, but I think George and Charlie could work out.”
My only reply was to smile. Which was basically the last coherent thought I had. He set a brutal pace, thrusting in and out with speed and force. I was babbling and whimpering, shouting things like, “please,” and “more.” I could feel the second orgasm building slowly around the rhythm he had set, but if you’d asked me right then, I’d have said Charlie was a Legillimens because just before I was about to come, only from his cock in my arse and no other stimulation, he stopped and pulled out. I whined at the loss, but before I could open my mouth to complain, Charlie had stood up, and I was being lifted from the table back into Charlie’s arms and carried back to the wall.
“Thanks, Kings. For the record, this is the first time since I learned of the Wizarding World that I actually believe the Ministry’s in excellent hands. “
Charlie laughs at that, “Oh please don’t apologise. The view was lovely. Wait, you said the three of you, does that mean Hermione is used to seeing you naked, Harry?” Charlie said with a raised eyebrow.
Harry hopped up and grabbed his jeans from the pile to put on. He leaned over and kissed Hermione on the cheek as he zipped them up. “Thanks’ Mione. I know how much you love blood right before you get to eat.”
Harry’s laughter increased. “The world is not ready for the terror George and I would cause, and given the way he flirts with everyone, I’m pretty sure Charlie’s not the marrying type. Really though, I’m more interested in having them all as my family than a spouse. Your family makes me feel warm and loved, and that’s not something I ever had growing up.”
Charlie moved one hand to the back of my neck, and the other slid down my back. The hand on my back continued its path until it was under my pajamas and pants. I could feel the rough pads of his fingers on my arse, and he squeezed. The hand behind my neck canted my head to the side, and he instantly began to devour my throat. Sucking hard enough to mark and cross just to this side of pain, then pulling back and licking slowly soothing the spot he’d just tortured. He nipped my ear, then worked his way down to my collar bone. I didn’t know a collar bone could be erotic but fuck if Charlie didn’t make it so.
When he added the third finger, I began to beg, in earnest, “Please, more. Need you. Please, Charlie, please.” But my begging didn’t get me anywhere.  He didn’t change his pace, he didn’t change anything, just kept going at his steady, infuriating rhythm. The fingers in my arse brushed against something, and my cock jumped. Charlie found that spot again and began to rub it with just the right amount of pressure.  He let my balls slide from his mouth with a pop, letting his teeth pull gently on my sac’s skin.
“Harry doesn’t use spells at all anymore when its just us. Though things people expect to be a verbal spell, he’ll say the incantation, but mostly to keep up appearances,” said Ron. “We don’t want anyone to know exactly how powerful he is. They’re already going to assume it because he defeated Voldemort. There’s no reason to give them more than that.”
There are too many sensations for Harry to focus on, George’s lips and tongue on and in his mouth, Fred sucking on his neck, four hands moving continuously over his torso, not knowing who’s hands even belong to who. Harry finally stops trying to follow his mind and just relaxes into the moment and does what he feels.
“Honestly, wherever we want to be. I want to explore life, explore the world. I don’t want to settle down, I want to meet lots of people, have new experiences, make a lot of mistakes and have fun before I figure out anything permanent.”
“That actually sounds like an excellent plan,” Harry says with a smile. “I know in the long run, I want a family. I want someone to fall in love with and spend my life with. I want children running around for me to spoil. But I also think I don’t even know enough about myself to make those decisions right now. I want to go figure out what I really like. But I don’t just want you to leave here, and we never see each other again either.”
Harry looked at Hermione, who blushed. “Well, we didn’t tangle with it per se. We, um, well we liberated it,” she said.
He pulls on her thighs, guiding her towards his face, “Get up here and let me lick my come out of you until you come so hard, your thighs shake.”
Charlie just barked out a laugh and shook his head, “Well at least I can assume that went well for you.”
“I’ll speak with Andi if you’d like Harry. There is no kind way to tell a mother her child has died. Focus on Teddy. I’ll stay with my sister as long as she needs me to.”
“What’s the matter Hermione, don’t you find my dressing gown stylish?” Harry said, gesturing to his transfigured dressing gown. “You still have all my clothes.”
Harry looked up to see McGonagall had been watching the exchange and had a look of sadness in her eyes. Harry stood and stepped towards her. “I fear the responsibilities that weigh on you seem to have no end in sight, Potter,” said the usually stern matron with kindness.
“I’ll be back as soon as I can, then I just want a shower and a bed,” Harry said as the exhaustion set in again.
Harry just smiled a complex and pained smile. He looked to see that Pipsy was still standing near Snape’s body and watched the exchange with Winky. “Winky and Pipsy, find Kreacher, and he can take you to my home. Will you both hear if I call you?”
"Again I say, wards were you, whiskey was me. Speaking of which, in all seriousness, can't you make me hangover potions that don't taste like licorice."
I was so sated and relaxed, I felt ecstasy, but I wasn’t hard. The hand on my leg slid up to my balls and massaged them slowly, he moved on to my cock, stroking not to entice, but just to enhance the sensations. I didn’t know what to concentrate on, the hand on my pelvis, the hot wet kisses on my neck, the hand gently scratching my nipples and holding me tight against him, or the hips slowly taking their own pleasure from my worn-out body.
Harry was ready to get this over with so that he could get to breakfast, so he raised his hand, and after a few seconds, the bottle flew into his outstretched hand.
Draco winced, “I’ve never met her, but I know she never stopped being my mother’s favourite sister. The house-elves keep their correspondence hidden from anyone else finding out about it.”
“You love me far too much to give me over to the public.” Harry said with a genuine smile beaming out from his face.
Harry reached for Draco's hand and pulled him into an embrace. He gave him a chaste kiss, "Meet you upstairs after I walk them out."
“Gin, can we talk?” Harry asked, nodding his head towards the corner of the room. Ron stepped towards the two girls and helped Hermione to sit up, then pulled her into his arms in a hug. Ginny stood from the bed and followed Harry towards the chair in the corner. Harry pointed for Ginny to take the chair, and he sat on the ottoman. He cast a Muffliato around them so they wouldn’t disturb Hermione. “She’s got enough on her mind,” Harry said as a way of explanation.
He pushed my back up to the wall, then used his hands to pull my arse cheeks apart and lowered me slowly back onto his cock.
She cast a diagnostic spell then said, “The tissue is infected, though it hasn’t entered your bloodstream. The damaged tissue will have to be cut out before I can heal it properly, and it’s going to hurt worse now than it did when it happened. Bill’s right, Pomfrey should come do this properly.”
“For what it’s worth, you have my vote. Though depending on the public, that’s a help or a hindrance.”
“Percy just pisses me off, so he’s a big giant no. I exclude Hermione and Ron because they’re too close to me ever to cross that line. I mean, all the Weasley’s family, but it hasn’t stopped me from falling into bed with most of you. Merlin, that just sounds wrong. Don’t really have any objections to Bill, so it’d be silly to say never.”
Hours later, Harry wakes first. He extracts himself from Ginny’s arms, throws on a dressing gown, and heads into the hallway, so the talking doesn’t wake Ginny up. He calls for Kreacher and asks for diner to be served soon and for it to be served up in his room. While waiting on Kreacher to reappear, Harry heads quietly into the en suite.
“Oh no, sir. I am happy to belong to you, sir. I was born a free elf, sir, and I chose to serve Master Severus on my own. Master Severus suggested you would be the safest place for me to go when he was no longer here for me. Once I agreed, he arranged for me to become yours after his death.”
Harry sighed, “We needed to get to Hogwarts before Voldemort did. It didn’t seem like a big deal. It just felt like a scratch. I wasn’t hiding it, Hermione, I promise.”
Once Ron and Draco are settled into their chess game, Hermione sits on the plush sofa pulling her legs up under her. She waves her wand, putting up a mild privacy charm. "There, we'll still be able to hear each other if we speak directly, but Ron won't have to hear any of the sordid details that I'm going to beg you for."
He set a rhythm this time of a slow glide out, followed by a fast, hard thrust forward. It wasn’t long until I was begging again,
“We deserve it. Father especially, but all of us. If I want my child to be a part of the world, I have to do what’s right to secure that for him. I’m not my father, I won’t repeat his mistakes. Mother agrees with me. Father’s too broken to argue.”
"I like it when you give me everything I want," Harry pulls Draco's lips back to his and apparates them directly outside the kitchen door.
Charlie’s cock was a work of art, and I knew that I’d be wordless again after he pounded into me with it, I knew that I’d still be feeling him for the next few days, no matter how well I’d been prepared. Charlie’s cock was thick, nearly twice as thick around as the ones I’d experienced before. Where the twins were long, longer than mine, though a bit thinner, with a slight curve, Charlie’s was shorter, about the same length as mine, but it was thick and stood straight out from his body. I licked my lips in anticipation, and Charlie smiled. “Like what you see, love?”
Harry just nods. Fred asks, “More?” to which Harry replies, “Yeah. Please.” The twins share a grin with each other, then both move toward Harry.  Fred moves around to Harry’s back, while George moves in front of him. George initiates a passionate kiss with Harry, and Fred leans in pressing kisses along the side of Harry’s neck, from behind.
Harry made their conversation private before replying. “Malfoy. Given everything that’s happened to us and between us for the past seven years, this may sound like a bullshit statement, but I want to thank you. For the manor, for your wand. Those two things, and your mother’s lie, played a huge part in my ability to defeat him. And for that, I’m grateful.”
George reaches out for his wand, he quickly transfigures three of the cushions into pillows, and one into a blanket. He throws the blanket over the three of them. Harry rolls onto his side, throwing a leg over George and snuggling into his side. Fred slides behind Harry, spooning him. George’s arm is under Harry and Fred’s heads, and Fred’s arm reaches past Harry to rest on his brother’s hip. Warm, safe, and sated, Harry drifts off to sleep.
Those weeks at Shell Cottage were when Harry knew that the moment Voldemort was in the ground for good — provided he survived it — he would find a better way to spend the rest of his life. He had no clue what that would be, but he was determined not to be satisfied until he figured it out.
She slid the hem of his pants up so that she could see the whole cut, and his expectation of it all being an overreaction deflated at the tone of her voice when she said. “Merlin, why didn’t you say something when this happened?”
"Where's the fun in that? I've been waiting for today for a long time," Hermione said, looking very pleased with herself.  Ron just scowled at his wife and turned back to his food.
Harry lets out a breath he doesn’t even realize he’d been holding. “I don’t understand why I feel relieved by that answer.  I know I love you, and I sure as fuck desire you, but your answer made me feel relief.”
Harry walked back to the Malfoys and relayed Shacklebolt’s message about turning themselves in and the wand. “The wards are down. You can Apparate directly from here. “
My legs started to buckle, but Charlie pulled out gently and lifted me back onto the table. He climbed up beside me and began peppering kisses along my jaw. “You still with me, still good?” I opened my eyes and gave him a hazy smile and a nod. I was beyond words at this point.
After the two girls had left the room, Harry made eye contact with Ron and they both sighed. Arthur asked what had just happened.
Harry turned back to Narcissa. “If you’re ready. I’ve no idea how to break this news. I appreciate you joining me.”
Harry walked over to the Weasleys and pulled Arthur aside. He told the patriarch of his adopted family his plans to protect Grimmauld and then take the family home with him. Harry told Arthur he needed a few more minutes to get the protections on the house to set and that he would be back for everyone shortly. He walked over to Hermione and Ron and told them it was time to head to Grimmauld.
“It’s not like that,” Harry pauses, “well, I don’t think it’s like that. I mean, he’s up to something, and no one believes me. Starting to piss me right off.”
Harry laughed then turned around to see that the rest of the Weasley’s had joined Bill, Fleur, and Charlie.
Bill interjects, “Harry, would you like for me to see if Madam Pomfrey can floo over to look at your injury?”
Ginny chuckles at his obvious arousal but sets a steady pace dancing her body above him. The lack of shame, and ease of movement, tells Harry this isn’t the first time she’s done this. He expected to be jealous, but he’s genuinely happy she’s experienced enough to make this very good for him. He’s not complaining about the way she’s making him feel.
Harry laughed, “Merlin no Ron, I have no doubts that neither you nor Hermione would ever betray me like that. I am avoiding a Bellatrix Lestrange situation. No one will ever expect me to choose a house-elf to hide my home. But they will automatically expect you. You can’t be tortured for the information you don’t possess. I don’t want either of you ever put in that situation, so I plan to make it clear to the press that my home is protected by a secret keeper, and it’s neither of you.”
“I’ll put everyone upstairs. You take the room on the first floor. I’ll make sure it’s clean enough to sleep in,” said Hermione.
Harry stopped and thought for a few moments. “You’re probably right, Gin, but it’s not something I’m going to think about now. Raising one will be hard enough. I know I said it all with confidence, but—” Harry’s voice dropped to a whisper, and his eyes lowered to his lap, “I’m scared I’ll screw it up, screw him up.”
Telling the tale was far more emotionally draining than Harry expected. Teddy was asleep, so he whispered for Winky, then passed the child over to the elf to put him down for a nap.
Ron’s eyebrows rose, and Harry simply mouthed, “Later.” Then to the table he added, Ron added, “Hermione even found a spell to keep our hair and skin from shedding until we shower.”
Charlie sat up, sliding my legs over his shoulders. He lined up his cock and slowly pressed the head inside me. I felt the stretch and burn as he slowly pushed inside.  He stopped once the head was in, took a few deep breaths, and looked over my face for any pain. I imagine all he saw was lust because the next thing I knew, he was bending forward, pressing my legs nearly back to my shoulders. I felt the burn in my leg muscles and the stretch in my arse simultaneously because he didn’t hesitate to slide all the way into me in one smooth, slow thrust.
“I’m sure you’ve all got questions, we’ll answer what we can while we eat.” said Harry as he left the drawing-room.
Harry shrugged. “Why should things change just because Voldemort is dead now?” Harry said with only a modicum of bitterness colouring in his tone.
"True, but we were alone this morning, no strangers to meet," Harry said with a smirk, "And asleep, you didn't even get a show."
"I was the silent investor in their shop, so the twins and I owled regularly about the business. One of the letters I sent back made them worry about me, so they snuck into the castle through the Shack to check on me."
Harry sighs. "Sixth year was rough for me. I was dealing with the guilt of Sirius. I was basically stalking Draco, and you both kept pointing out that I was obsessed with him, but I knew I had feelings for Ginny. That was confusing, and I wasn't sure of anything. Life felt like it was falling apart. Dumbledore had just dumped the weight of the world on my shoulders. I was a mess."
Harry pushes her hips up just enough to give him room to speak. “I’m going to set you down all the way on my face; take what you want, Gin.” Before she can react or speak, she’s lowered onto his face. She feels the pressure of his nose and mouth and chin pressing into her. She reaches one hand down from the headboard and tangles it in Harry’s hair tugging it gently, and she starts to rock. She’s pressing down onto his face. Riding his nose with her clit, she can feel his tongue moving inside her, and she’s so close, she’s afraid to hurt him, but she wants to tip over the edge so badly.
Harry knew there would be questions he had to answer, but he also knew there were things he didn’t want to share and things he shouldn’t even if he’d wanted to. “I’ll answer what I can, Minister.”
When the questions ended, and Harry, Hermione, and Ron looked as if they planned to fall asleep where they sat, Kingsley asked Harry if there was a safe place for him to stay. McGonagall planned to allow anyone who needed lodging to remain in the castle, the undamaged parts at least, but no one thought it would be wise for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to stay in such an accessible area.
"I like seeing you happy. And you make me happy too." Draco reaches for Harry's hand and interlaces their fingers.  Harry pulls their joined hands up, kisses the back of Draco's hand, and then walks them into the kitchen. Hermione and Ron are already at the table in their usual seats. Hermione has already poured tea for herself and Ron, and she's pouring Harry's coffee as they walk into the room.
“If you only have experience with Muggle babies, how did you know the spell to hold his bottle?” asked Percy.
“Lots of dark magic can use blood, skin, or hair, so we’re super careful to not leave any biological matter of Harry’s — all of us, really — anywhere for someone to find. It’s unnecessary in this house because I restricted access to only trustworthy people, but it’s habit for all of us now.”
“Fuck, Gin, you taking control is so fucking hot,” Harry says with a strangled voice, “I’m not going to last long like this.”
"It wasn't really about hiding from you, Ron. I promise that.  I knew you'd be okay, and support me."
“We’re friends. We’re close friends. They don’t need to know anything else. No one needs to know what happens in either of our beds.”
“No one will understand what he’s feeling as he learns his parents are dead better than you will. And if he’s a werewolf or a Metamorphagus, he’s going to feel isolated, and different. There’s no one else who understands that better than you do either Harry. You had all the obstacles, all these challenges, and you turned out just fine. So will Teddy—” she said sincerely, then added, “so will his siblings,” with a smirk and a chuckle.
“You said ‘different’, so I’m guessing you’ve already had sex with a man?” Before Harry can answer Ginny’s face pales and she blurts out, “Oh shite, you spent the last year with Hermione and Ron.  Please tell me it wasn’t my brother Harry.”
“Both Andromeda and Teddy can come back to my house. I have a house-elf to help take care of Teddy. My house is behind a Fidelus charm now, it’s the safest place either of them can be for now.”
In his sixth year, when Dumbledore began showing Harry what would be necessary to defeat Voldemort, Harry thought that being an Auror would help his task.
"It was the night of my seventeenth birthday dinner. That noise we heard downstairs before we tucked in was Charlie.  After Ron started snoring, I couldn't fall asleep, so I went downstairs. Charlie was in the kitchen with a glass of firewhiskey.  He poured me one.  We talked then, the first time we actually talked properly y' know. The talking wasn't deep.  We talked quidditch or dragons. Nothing heavy. It got a bit quiet, then I looked up and made eye contact with Charlie and told him I was scared to fucking death of failing everyone. We'd gotten about halfway through the bottle at this point, and then we heard a noise on the stairs.  Charlie grabbed my hand, and we went to Arthur's shed so we could finish talking."
For a second, Harry pauses, takes another sip from the bottle, looks up, and says, “Yeah. Definitely am.”
Harry stands up and starts pacing in a circle around the small room. He’s talking with his hands, still holding the bottle. “I’m not wrong about the plotting, he’s up to something,” Harry says with vehemence. “But all the carrying on about it has made me start to question things. I like your sister, I mean like, like. But I can’t get Malfoy out of my head either. I’m not thinking about him like that, least I don’t think I am, but what if I do like blokes? How’s anyone supposed to know how to figure this stuff out? How am I supposed to figure this out when I’m being dragged around to hell and back with Dumbledore, having to pry things out of Slughorn, following evil gits around, getting no sleep, and…”
“Being behind your Fidelus is the safest place for him, and I know you would never keep him from his family,” said Andi.
His hands kneaded my arse cheeks, squeezing and pulling them apart. I felt his warm breath over my entrance, and I heard myself gasp. Then his tongue was on me, and I couldn’t think again, only feel.
Hermione waves her wand and a new cup of tea pours itself, the proper amount of milk and sugar is stirred in, then the cup floats directly in front of him, waiting patiently for him to grab it from the air.
"I don't want to hurt her Charlie, I do love her. Being with me is just dangerous, more now than ever. And until it's all done. I just can't be what she deserves."
Harry takes a long pull on the bottle, swallowing down and wincing past the burn. He looks to his left and right, seeing the twins just watching him patiently. Harry takes another swallow from the bottle then stares forward into the fire. “What am I supposed to say?”
Draco chuckled and looked over at Harry, "Told you she'd figure it out first. You owe me 50 galleons.""
Andi answered for her sister, “She means the three of you along with Severus and Albus. She’s right, Harry, you have nothing to apologise for. We lost many in this war, but those deaths lie at the feet of Voldemort and no other. And as angry as I am with Dora for leaving the house tonight, I know she fought for what was right and for a better world for her son.” Andi’s voice cracked as she said Tonk’s name, and her tears flowed again as she finished her statement.
Harry chuckles and takes the stairs two at a time. His shirt is off and discarded on the floor before he makes it to the landing.
"In the beginning, we decided to keep things quiet so we'd have some time to ourselves. It's not like the two of us, hell the four of us, ever have a break from the press. We only wanted to hide it from the world for a bit, not our friends. But the first morning he was here, and you came in, he was in the loo. We decided we didn't want you to find out that way and wanted to tell you both first. Then it sort of became a game to see how long we could keep things under wraps."
Bill took the next question. “When the three of you left Shell Cottage, Hermione looked like Bellatrix Lestrange, Ron didn’t look like Ron, you had Griphook with you, and the sword of Gryffindor. This morning we learn you got injured sliding off a dragon. I’m guessing you tangled with the dragon guarding the Lestrange vault, but why?”
A wolf whistle followed by, “Very nice Harry.” had Harry spinning around to see a blushing Fleur, an amused Bill, and a leering Charlie.
Before Kingsley could speak again, Harry called for Kreacher and asked for sandwiches for the group. Both Ron and Hermione looked thankful. While finally getting to eat without worrying about where the next food was coming from, without having to pick up and run in the middle of it, the Trio took the time to enjoy their sandwiches. While eating, Kingsley and McGonagall asked question after question about what they’d been through, where they’d gone, what they’d done.
"The 'ginger waiter.' Ron found him in Harry's bed the next morning.  He didn't come down for breakfast, but when Ron described him, I knew."
Draco kissed his mother on the cheek, then reached out to touch his father’s arm. “Thank you, Potter,” said Draco. Lucius never spoke, but he offered a slight nod in Harry’s direction as Draco Apparated both of them away from the Great Hall.
Harry laughs, "It's okay 'Mione. He can ask, though he can probably figure it out on his own if he thinks about it."
Bills eyes went wide, “Fifteen centimetres long and at least a centimetre deep is not just a scratch Harry.”
Harry continued to tell the story of how many ways Snape helped him in his Hogwarts years, starting with his broom in First Year. He covered the cursed ring, and Malfoy’s task, and how Dumbledore manipulated Snape into agreeing to kill him. Harry told of the Astronomy tower, of all the things that happened seventh year, the ways Snape tried to protect the students the best way he could. Then he told them all of how Dumbledore told Snape that Harry had to die, how Harry was a horcrux and that Voldemort himself had to kill him. He told them how much that had infuriated Snape, then he told them how he died.
A new thought suddenly crossed Andi’s mind because she suddenly turned to Narcissa, “Draco? How is Draco?”
"Morning, Harry, Draco." Hermione's already floating a giant mug of coffee in front of Harry. "Tea Draco?"
“Alright Kreacher, I’ll be down in a minute.” Harry checked the time to see it was indeed breakfast time and the next day. He’d slept over 16 hours and felt recharged for the first time in a very long time. He realised quickly that he was still had no clothes, so he transfigured his top sheet into a dressing gown and headed toward the kitchen. Harry heard voices in the drawing-room and stopped in to see who was there. Hermione and Ron were drinking tea and Teddy was sleeping in his crib, so Harry went into the room to see his friends.
Charlie chuckled at my plea, but he gave me more. Suddenly both hands were under my arse, his mouth was on my other nipple, and we were standing. He stood and lifted me like I weighed nothing. I instantly wrapped my legs around his waist and my arms around his neck, holding myself tight to his body.
In his seventh year, while hunting Horcruxes and running from Death Eaters, Harry started wondering if he really wanted to do this for the rest of his life.
"He's the strategist 'Mione. You're observations and spells, Ron strategizes our information, then I execute.  That's how we work."
“Fucking nightmares,” he said, then he sighed. He checked the time, and only an hour had passed. He so desperately needed sleep. And that meant he needed a potion. He called for Pipsy, who appeared standing next to him on the bed with a very subtle pop.
“You’re no fun, little brother. But I’ll behave,” Charlie said, to which Ron and Bill both raised an eyebrow.
All the Weasleys were watching the trio with varying kinds of interest. He sighed, realising that they had so much they were going to have to explain.
“Andi was my favourite. We never stopped our correspondence, though no one knew about it. We used the House Elves to deliver messages unobtrusively.”
“Mmmm,” Gin said as she slowly rolled to the mattress’s side and slid her bare feet to the floor. She quickly walked over to the table, taking a seat and opening the trays to see what had been brought for them. Gin was so comfortable in her skin, Harry just looked at her with awe.
“No worries. I managed,” Harry said as he stood from his chair and walked to the pile of clothes that was amassing on the side table next to Hermione.
I woke the next morning back in Ron’s room, and for a moment, I was sure it was a dream. I rolled to my side to reach for my glasses. I could feel the twinge of soreness from our activities and saw a vial with a note next to my glasses. I knew then I wasn’t imagining, and it had happened. The next thing I registered was the pounding headache that came with drinking a half bottle of firewhiskey. I picked up the vial and looked at the note.
“Ignore him. We’ve only been up for about an hour. You weren’t the only person who slept through dinner.”
Fred intercepts Harry as he walks past him. George takes the bottle from Harry, and Fred guides Harry back down to the rug. “Stop.”
My quick burst of laughter made my head throb and startled Ron, who rolled over and went right back to sleep. I downed the potion quickly and felt the immediate relief. I lay back down on my pillow and took stock of myself for a few moments. I realized that for the first time since Dumbledore told me about the Horcruxes, the tension was gone from my shoulders, and I felt the beginnings of hope. I felt like we could do this, that we were going to get through it all somehow, that maybe, just maybe, our dumb luck would pull us through once again.
Charlie started to slide his arms up my back under my shirt, and I lifted my hands so he could remove it. He tossed the shirt to the ground, then pulled me into his chest and started kissing me. He raised both hands and put them on either side of my head so he could hold me still while he attacked my mouth. First, it was long slow strokes of his tongue, then small nips up my jaw. He returned to my mouth this time with passionate brutal kisses that left me panting when he finally pulled back.
At dinner, they continued answering questions from the Weasleys. Arthur picked up on asking about the Elder wand again. Then Percy asked what the trio planned to do next. Charlie asked if Harry really died. Then the cycle started over with Ginny.
"Bugger." Harry turns to look at Ron properly for the first time since he was woken up by Draco's voice.
McGonagall had returned to the hall and was watching Harry’s exchange with Pipsy with amusement in her eyes. She called for Winky, then looked to Harry and said, “Winky claims it is imperative to speak with you, Potter.”
Harry smiled, “I appreciate that more than you know Molly. You and Mrs Granger are the best examples of a mother that I know. I’d be happy if Teddy grows up as loved as your children are.”
Ginny grasps the headboard to steady herself just before Harry reaches up and grabs her.  His hands grasp where her thighs meet her pelvis, both thumbs grazing over her lips. “Drop your weight Gin, I have you.” She relaxes the muscles she was using in her thighs to hold her steady and feels the strength of Harry holding her steady. With no warning, his thumbs slide right inside her lips, pulling them apart as he lowers her the last bit onto his face.
The lubed finger he slid into me was shocking, but only because I wasn’t expecting it. He had relaxed my muscles so much that his finger slid in easily. It wasn’t long before a second finger pressed in to join the first, then I felt a warm mouth close over my balls as he sucked one into his mouth. He hummed around my balls as he scissored the fingers in my arse. The vibrations of his mouth and his fingers’ movement sent a jolt of lust straight to my cock. I was panting by this point, continually making noises I can’t even explain.
“Hermione, you learn it. Then we’ll set it. Alone, no need to divulge who’ll be there to a room full of portraits that often have second paintings.”
Lucius and Draco looked as if they wanted to speak, but she gently put her hand on Draco’s shoulder and Lucius’ leg and stood. Harry took a few steps back, and Narcissa walked to join him. He cast a spell around them so that no one else could hear the conversation.
Harry laughed aloud. "That's their choice as always. I make no promises, I'm not rescinding standing invitations to my bed because of your delicate sensibilities," Harry says with a smirk.
Harry stood with a smile. Leave it to Snape to have an educated house-elf that was even stranger than Dobby.
"The twins.  I know you were holding back details for Ron's delicate sensibilities, but I need to know.  Together? Like together together?"
Figuring out the last three took a second, but the twins tip the scales. It had to be Fred and George were with Harry in the past, because it would never have been just one of them. That also tells me it wasn't going to be George on the future list because neither he nor Harry would try the dynamic again without Fred.  It would be too painful.
“Harry, you’re fit.  And you’re passionate about everything. Shagging, you was bound to be fun. I’m sure Fred and George figured that out.  Volunteering to help you wasn’t a hardship.”
Harry looks at her, “The last thing I feel for you is pity Gin. Shagging you was magnificent, I’d just never shagged a woman before.”
When I did that, he bit hard enough to make me cry out, and the pain turned to pleasure immediately, and I thrust my hips against him, desperately searching for friction. I started begging, “Please, Charlie. Please.” though I couldn’t have verbalized precisely what I was asking for. “More. Need more.”
“I’m not taking him away from you Andi, I just want him protected and safe, and we still don’t know how the public and any remaining Death Eaters will react. Ideally, I’d like you both there.”
“Harry, that’s not going to happen. We’ll always be in each other’s life. I cant imagine Mum letting either of us miss too much family time,” Gin says with a laugh. “And I don’t know about you, but I’m definitely not against the idea of jumping into bed casually as long as we’re single at the time.”
"Potter.  Why am I being stared at by a Weasley that's wearing bright orange pajamas?" Harry hears Draco drawl in his calm pretentious voice.
Harry told them of Snape’s turn to the Dark Lord, how he accepted the Dark Mark, How he heard half of Trelawny’s prophecy and Snape’s shock when Voldemort said that it meant Lily’s child. He explained how Snape begged for Lily’s life, and while Voldemort agreed, Snape knew his only hope was going to Dumbledore.
Narcissa guided Andromeda to sit next to Harry, then she sunk to her knees in front of her sister, holding both her hands gently.
“No Harry, I don’t, and it’s not just Teddy. It’s something I’m pretty sure I’ve always known, but hadn’t really considered. I grew up in an enormous family and my brothers are going to make tons of nieces and nephews for me to be around. But it’s never been my dream to become my mum. There’s so many things I want to do first if I ever decide to have a family. You though? You are meant to have a family, to be a dad. I just didn’t really think about it that way until I saw how comfortable Teddy was in your arms.” Ginny said with tears in her eyes. “Don’t mind the tears. I understand it all. It’s just going to take a bit of getting used to, I’ve spent the past year knowing that we might not be together at the end of the war, but it didn’t stop me from hoping that would be the outcome. I love you Harry, I care about you, and I feel a little selfish doing this now, when you have so much on your plate.”
“I wasn’t expecting you to be kind,” Harry said with honesty. “Thank you for lying to him. I know you did it for Draco, but I know how terrifying that must have been. I also have a feeling you aren’t particularly sad about the outcome of this war.”
"I'm glad that's how you feel.  I also see that you're going to break down soon if you don't find an outlet for all the pressure these so-called grown-ups are putting on you. It's your call, Harry. Tell me what you want."
The sound that comes from Harry’s mouth isn’t a word, and he doesn’t know how to describe it either. Harry has enough presence of mind to realize that one of the twins is under him, giving him one hell of a blow job, while the other is attacking his arse with his mouth and tongue. The only thing that Harry can think right now is that he’s pretty sure he likes blokes now.
“Take all the time you need and don’t worry about Teddy, but don’t isolate yourself for too long. I have all the Weasley’s at my house for now, and they’ve lost Fred as well.”
Draco's right behind him, "You were singing a completely different tune last night," Draco says as he reaches out, snagging Harry by the waist and pulling him into his body before he hits the first step. Harry's only got his shirt over his neck and one arm halfway in when Draco grabs him. Harry's still warm from sleep and melts into Draco's embrace.  Harry turns in his arms and puts his arms around Draco's neck, pulling him down into a slow, gentle kiss. Draco's managed to get his arms through his shirt but hadn't pulled it down all the way yet.  The flat planes of Draco's stomach rub against Harry's toned abs. Harry deepens the kiss then pulls away with a growl.
She smiled back at him, “Come eat Harry, Kreacher’s made a feast, and you’ll need your strength later,” she said with a leer.
Harry pulls off George’s cock just enough to whine out, “Fred please, inside me, fuck. Please fuck me.” Harry leans forward-searching out George’s cock again, and George guides his mouth back into place.
He never got to go up to Gryffindor tower to sleep like he wished, though he did, at least, get his sandwiches. The food helped, but the nap would have been better. It would be another five hours before Harry would get to Grimmauld Place and finally have the chance to clean up, sleep, get his injuries healed, and fill the Weasley’s in on all the things that happened while the Trio had been gone.
Harry starts to speak, but Hermione cuts him off, "Wait, I want to figure this out on my own first." Ron just looks at his wife in horror. "What? C'mon, we can figure it out, Ron. Help me think."
Charlie didn’t stop again until he was as far as he could go inside me, his balls rubbing against my cheeks. He looked down at me, making eye contact, smiled, and asked, “Ready?”
“Sold Harry,” she says, sliding off his lap, allowing them to slide down onto the bed. Harry waves his hand, casting a nonverbal cleaning charm over both of them before getting comfortable on his pillow. He reaches out, pulling Ginny into him. She rolls toward him, throwing a leg over his and putting her head on his shoulder. Her arm rests across his chest, his arm holds her to his side, as they both drift off to sleep.
He has a love of Potions and Transfiguration due to his bond with Severus as well as his love of it and him being able to transform, which has kind of helped him with Minerva. Advantage of what!?
Otiz tried to come into the room, he had hated that he had to stay in Spinners End while they went to the zoo but still, he wanted to be with Harry and not locked out of the bloody room!!
"Look at this the great Harry Potter is shaking" laughed Jacob to his twin sister and she too started laughing but it was all to follow him, she didn't want to but he was her brother after all.
