“He’s… fine… but not quite my type?” Harry said, finishing his drink and finally taking the time to stop and actually take in the full scene before him. There were almost exclusively men littered across the dancefloor and booths.  In fact, the few women he saw were entangled with each other.  Suddenly, it dawned on Harry, “Malfoy, is this… is this a gay bar?”
Earlier in the book, when Harry is complaining to Hermione about how Snape is so in love with the Dark Arts, she points out that he sounded a bit like Harry.  Harry knows that he doesn’t like the Dark Arts, so now he has to conclude that point of view matters. Hermione's wisdom, coupled with Draco eventually renouncing the Dark Arts (which is something that could happen down the road, given that Draco has already started questioning it), should probably be enough to allow Harry to forgive Draco. And if there’s no love for the Dark Arts to despise, the next logical step would be for Harry and Draco to move into the Friends phase.
“You’d have to apply, just like anyone else.  However, I imagine the Board of Governors would be easily persuaded by a war hero known for his Expelliarmus teaching Defense.”  McGonagall gave Harry a rare, genuine smile.
But, in the books he is a child. He’s an only child, with overbearing parents. They’ve indoctrinated him from birth into a specific way of thinking. For the first eleven years of his life, he’s in this bubble of pureblood superiority where nobody ever dares speak out against their beliefs. He has, for sure, seen the tapestry at Grimmauld Place. He knows what happens if someone disagrees with the family-- they get disowned. He might not know the specific circumstance around Regulus Black, but if Sirius and Remus both assumed that Regulus was trying to back out from being a Death Eater and got killed for it, then the Malfoys probably came to a similar conclusion. For the Malfoys, blood is everything. Not just blood status, but also their families. In Draco's mind, if he doesn’t have his parents’ love and support, then what does he have? Abandonment? Death? Choosing family seems like a pretty easy choice for a kid given those alternatives.
Later, when Harry, Hermione, and Ron are captured and brought to Malfoy Manor it is Draco who is called to identify them. Narcissa says,

Draco took a deep breath.
Harry heard the distinct pop of Draco disapparating and leaned back in his seat, very confused. He shook his head, as if that would help clear it. But the image of Draco, looking slightly disheveled and wearing his Weasley sweater, wouldn’t leave his mind no matter how hard he tried.
“I wasn’t at work,” Harry sighed contentedly. Hermione gave him a stern look. “I was actually--”
“Would it make you feel better to know that Davies was also a jerk?” Harry asked.
"I tried," Harry brushed away some dirt from his pants. "But, I'm having some patronus performance issues."
“Ginny Weasley.” Pansy deadpanned.
“It’s lucky we were here though,” Ginny continued, putting the clothes down on a chair and walking over to the kitchen table where an unopened letter was laying. “This came for you a few minutes ago.”
“So the other day when you were in a meeting I had lunch upstairs,” Draco attempted another conversation in Oliver’s office. He had a two hour break between meetings and a Quidditch match, so Draco thought this would be ideal. “And I overheard some interesting Quidditch talk.”
“Neither was Percy,” Harry nodded. “But, he would do just about anything for a good networking opportunity. You’re going to have to sit on this side before they get here, though, and Percy is rarely late.”
“Remember when people thought that this would be our wedding?” Harry laughed.

potion in his free time?” Harry huffed indignantly, while getting further into Draco’s face.
“You’re still a very good flyer,” McGonagall pointed to her window.  She had a clear view of the Quidditch pitch. “Did you have a good time?”
“I’d like to welcome all of you to another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. First, let me remind you of some of the rules in case you have managed to forget them over the summer holiday.”
We finally see Draco when he and Lucius Malfoy stroll into Borgin and Burkes (a thing that Harry is mortified of, because
Once they got deeper into the forest, Neville paused.
“Was that not exactly what you would’ve ordered?  I was really saving our poor waitress the dismay of having to deal with your abysmal table manners,” Draco shrugged. “But back to your wedding...if I didn’t know you better, Potter, I’d think you were more interested in the grandeur of having a wedding rather than the actual point of it: the lasting and loving commitment of marriage.” Harry paused to let this sink in.
“I’m not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it,” Ginny sang, kicking open the door to Draco’s bedroom. “Sup, Malfoy?”
“And I’m just supposed to believe that Draco Malfoy, poster boy for blood purity, has been working on improving the taste of a
“Oh get over it, it was an accident,” Harry whispered. “It’s hard to maneuver under here and I wanted to make sure he wouldn’t be able to see my feet, okay?”
Suddenly out of the forest, there was a bright light. Harry opened his eyes, expecting to see his familiar stag but instead a phoenix burst forward and the devil's snare retreated.
“I recommend you learn to control your attitude, Wood.  I have a feeling that the Bulgarians won’t appreciate it next week when you visit for their match against England.” Percy looked away with the ghost of a smirk on his face when he had finished speaking.
“That’s not what I meant,” Neville explained. “I have a couch you can sleep on. I just don’t think you should be alone in the castle in your current state.”
“Oh, it had nothing to do with your safety.” Harry said, taking a step forward.
“What do you think you’re doing?” Harry demanded.
I’m not here to say that Crabbe and Goyle are gay. I know plenty of people who have gone to school dances with their friends and not a date, myself included. But Harry clearly has not even considered that maybe they could be. There is room for gay representation in this scene even if
“Technically he has an open invitation to everything,” Harry explained. “But I don’t think Ron will be bothered if he doesn’t go.”
With a name like The Burrow, Draco had been sure that the Weasley’s lived under the ground, perhaps like a pack of nifflers. Instead of an intricate collection of tunnels, Draco took in a home that was made up of several haphazardly constructed stories.  It was no Malfoy Manor, but Draco hadn’t expected it to be. What surprised Draco most as he followed Harry into the home, was that despite its shabby appearance The Burrow felt more lived in and loved than his home ever had.

to set a good example for the students.  And I’d appreciate it if the next time I’m giving a speech, you keep your bickering to a minimum.”
******************
“Well, Ginny’s always been one for a challenge.  And if I’m going to lose out to anyone, probably better for it to be because I have the wrong bits,” Harry laughed. He was long past the point of lamenting his failed relationship with Ron’s sister.
“Do you need me to spell it out for you like Granger would, Potter?” Malfoy set his report aside. “We learned that in order for Weasley to be interested, Oliver needs to have a prestigious position at the Ministry. So you just have to talk him up, and make him seem important. Percy is also keeping tabs on Quidditch matches which should be easy enough for us to exploit. Were you even paying attention?”
“I expected...you...to be...in...your office,” Draco huffed between breaths. He inhaled deeply and then composed himself. “I was hoping to catch you before you left, and then you weren’t in your office, so I ran here. Merlin, I’m glad you’re here.”
“Uh. Yeah, eventually.” Harry stalled. “But there was actually something else I wanted to ask you.”
Maybe Harry only liked Cho because he thought he should, and the frightening possibilities involve admitting his feelings for...other...seekers.  Harry continues to screw things up with Cho, and Hermione is there after one of his bigger blunders (Madam Puddifoot’s) to explain more feelings to Ron and Harry which leaves them dumbfounded.
“Did you hear something, Pans?” Ginny looked around the living room and pretended not to be able to see Draco.
“That’s the problem!” Harry threw his hands up in the air. “Oliver only thinks that he likes Percy because we made him think that! Percy is not the charming guy that we painted him to be. He’s a social climber. He’s only interested in what will get him ahead in his job and he doesn’t care who he hurts along the way.”
Harry nodded and scanned the bar.  Finally he caught eyes with a tall, sandy haired man. “That one,” Harry said, pointing towards the guy.
“Yes. This is the third time we’ve gone over this.” Harry replied. He shifted awkwardly in the bed. The lights of St Mungo’s made him look even paler than he was.
And then Draco could see Luis’s face--the terrifying delight, the smug satisfaction, the way his lips curled and his eyes gleamed as if there was nothing more that he wanted in the entire world then what lay at his feet at that very moment.
“Nope.” Sampson sighed. “More paperwork.”
Disturbed only when Vale popped up before anyone else and growled in a particularly angry tone, “There were two!”
Malfoy sat up and began to fold Sawyer up just as neatly as the other two, hands moving perhaps a bit slower but just as surely. He put them reverently back into the tote, lips brushing against their foreheads as he did. And Harry went quietly back into the room where he didn’t sit, but waited for Malfoy to break the silence.
And Draco went shock white.
They all ate in silence, a strange thing that hadn’t happened to Harry since Teddy and Andromeda had moved in. The whole meal was disconcerting, and the pancakes felt heavy in Harry’s stomach.
“Ah, but this date, that is the first time I made love to Harry.” Draco remembered because it was his wedding night with Ginny, and Harry had not done any of the things a groom was expected to do. He had not gotten spectacularly drunk, he had not glowed with pleasure and love at his new bride. He’d told Draco that it had felt like a performance, like the ministry events he attended, which of course made sense as it had been a huge public affair attended by the same people. And at the end of the night, both he and Ginny had been too tired to do anything but undress and go to sleep.
“You pass laws limiting the number of us who can be together in one place, you require us to register, to come to your buildings for wolfsbane potion, you make us a risk. A lone wolf is dangerous when cornered, a wolf cut off from their Pack cannot help but yearn for what they have lost, to seek out that safety and acceptance at the full moon.
Absently, Malfoy reached up to his collarbone. He was quiet for a long moment, running his fingers across the bone to the hollow at his throat and back. “He’s hard but fair, I suppose. The Pack respects him, they’d have to, or they wouldn’t be in the Pack.”
Harry and Draco made confused eye contact. And Draco shrugged, as if to say "wasn't me".
“But you’ve already saved the world in the biggest possible way. You didn’t have to be an auror to do that.”
Unfortunately for Cedric, he happens to also fall for the only seeker that Harry’s willing to acknowledge his feelings for and Harry starts to be jealous of Cedric (although still pointing out all of his strengths):
"You can ignore that," Neville said encouragingly. "They say things like that a lot, and they only come true about half the time."
“They did not cut me off,
“Double?” Draco raised his eyebrow and paused to make Harry sweat it out a bit. “I suppose that’ll work. But I’m taking the side of rashers. And if you don’t get the money back to me by tomorrow night I’m going to start charging interest.” Draco quickly handed the pancakes off to Harry, sticking a rasher in his mouth and headed back to the elevator.
(409)
“You are absolutely insufferable, Weasley! It’s a wonder anyone puts up with your antics at all! If it were up to me, I would-” Oliver’s rant was interrupted by the clanking of the lift grates opening on the ground level of the Ministry.  Percy wasted no time in delicately stepping around Oliver and exiting toward the floo, his robes swishing behind him.  Oliver clenched his fists and talked himself out of following Percy to continue telling him exactly where he thought Percy could shove his thoughts.
“Speak for yourself,” Harry replied. “But nobody is going to be able to see us anyway once we put on my invisibility cloak. And before you question it, I coordinated with Tom the Barman to keep this table reserved while we’re here so we don’t have to worry about anybody sitting here when we’re invisible.”
“Of course, Harry, of course,” Hermione cautiously stepped aside, allowing Harry to roughly grab his trunk.  “Please write to us once you're settled.”
Draco casually bumped into Harry’s shoulder as they walked through the door of their favorite diner.  Ever since he’d popped the question to the Girl Weasel, Harry had been yoyo-ing between extreme happiness and extreme despair.  The happiness made sense to Draco, it was like the perfect ending to a fairytale: the Golden Boy ends up with the beloved damsel.  The ultimate Hogwarts sweetheart story come to life. And yet… Draco could see so clearly that Harry wasn’t as happy as the rest of the adoring wizarding public seemed to think. Pansy had given him quite enough shite about his possible “ulterior motives” for seeing cracks in the Chosen One’s happy facade. But Draco was a Slytherin, which meant reading people was one of his greatest assets.  And if there was anything he could plainly see, it was that Harry Potter was not enthused about marrying his best friend’s little sister.
“Then I’ll be back shortly, I’ll grab those scrolls and the antique quills I was telling you about.” Draco heard Cormac say.  Draco entered the parlor to be faced with the owner of the familiar voice.
“Especially if you’re planning on being stuck with someone for the foreseeable future.” Harry added.  He smiled and then kissed Draco again.
“Er, right. Sure you didn’t… Anyway, I wondered if you might want to grab dinner, or I mean, food, something casual,” Harry stammered out.
“It might be too late to fix anything tonight.  Percy and Oliver are supposed to be heading to a World Cup qualifying match,” Draco checked his watch. “Very soon. Maybe I’ll just try tomorrow.”
As if the first month of teaching wasn't difficult enough, Harry also found himself getting more and more agitated the closer it got to the full moon.
Hermione let out a small scream when Harry’s body swirled into the fireplace. Harry had hoped to sneak in via floo powder, since nobody ever expected him to arrive that way, but unfortunately his good luck had run out and Hermione had been in the parlor reading at that very moment.
“We hope you’ll be able to put aside your differences to work together.” Oliver finished and then ushered Harry and Draco back out of the conference room making sure they both knew that while finding a new flat was the priority, they also shouldn’t forget about any of their other responsibilities.
“Oh shut it, Ron.”
“Oh for the love of- I know your breakfast order, I order toast without butter, I sit here in a diner at any hour of the day listening to you whine, because I’m in love with you, you absolute buffoon!” Draco exclaimed, finally feeling a bit of release from expressing his emotions that was immediately followed by pure dread at what he’d just revealed.
After consulting with McGonagall, they decided that for the first full moon, Harry would visit the infirmary daily to get his wolfsbane potion from the potions master. The cover story would be an ongoing cold brought on by the beginning of the school year-- a perfectly believable thing, as many students and teachers found themselves in similar positions. They'd come up with "trips" that Harry could take to gather material for lessons for future full moons once they saw how this one went.
“Ouch Potter, that was my shin.” Draco sneered as Harry accidentally kicked him under the table.
Tom, the barkeeper, grunted in reply and put a glass of lager in front of Percy. Percy sighed and accepted this alternative. He took a sip of his drink and looked around the room to see if the person he was meeting had arrived without him noticing. He didn’t see his colleague, but he did notice a familiar face walk through the door.
, and he absolutely didn’t want Draco Malfoy to see him like this because Harry Potter always wants to be his best when he’s around Draco). Draco spends most of this scene complaining to his father.
“Ugh, that stuff upsets my stomach,” Percy said. “Just get me pancakes from that 24-hour muggle diner.” And with that, Percy shooed Harry out of his office and shut the door again. Harry trudged back to his desk to call in the order.
“That’s almost exactly what your ex-Weasley told me,” Draco said, leaning against the bar. “But he’s nice to look at. What about you?”
“Actually, having a long weekend for Christmas would be beneficial for me as well,” Draco replied. “Cormac has been trying to get me to commit to playing Seeker in his pickup Quidditch League finals on Christmas afternoon.”
“If you didn’t order it for yourself, then who are you ordering it for?”
"It's too far for lumos!" Draco yelled back. The last thing that he wanted to admit to Harry Potter in this moment was a weakness, but unfortunately, Draco also knew he'd never been able to produce a patronus of any kind. And his secret was about to come out.
“Honestly, Potter, if you were any slower you’d be going backwards.”
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy started off on very different paths: Harry was unloved until Hogwarts where his found family showed him compassion, understanding, and light. Draco was loved until Hogwarts where his found family showed him competition, hatred, and darkness. They balance each other out. Harry can be the beacon of hope that Draco so desperately needs, and Draco can show Harry how to navigate the Wizarding World (he certainly has had more experience in that matter than the Weasleys). Harry can learn to think before he acts, and Draco can learn how to support and build people up.
“I will show you to your rooms in a moment.  But before I do, I want you to know that this castle used to be your home and it can be again, if you only let it.”  Harry averted his eyes, lest it become clear McGonagall had reminded him quite a bit of Dumbledore with that statement. “Now, your rooms are near the Gryffindor Tower, follow me.”
” Draco closed the distance between himself and Harry, locking them in a much anticipated kiss.
“Well, you see,” Ron began sheepishly, “I asked-”
“Potter, you do know if you keep doing that a lightning bolt won’t be the only scar on your forehead?”
******************
Step Two: accept that Draco is a child who deserves a redemption arc. I know Draco Malfoy is a little shit. He has to be an insufferable fuckweasel in order to firmly establish the Enemies/Rivals phase. There is no Drarry if they are not enemies first. It is their constant rivalry that fuels what will eventually become sexual tension, and the romance would just not be believable if Draco weren’t, well, Draco.
Sure enough, when Draco reached Harry a minute later, Harry was wrapped up to his waist against a tree in devil's snare and his wand was laying uselessly a foot away.
“I wanted to talk to you about everything that happened with Oliver and Percy.  And us… I know it seemed like I-” Draco began, but Harry interrupted.
Harry was a little embarrassed when he discovered that his eyes had filled with tears and he tried to blink them away before anyone would notice. He was so misty eyed that he actually almost missed the glint of platinum blond in the crowd. The sun was reflecting off Draco’s head and Harry couldn’t believe that a moment like this was when he would recognize Draco had actually showed up to the wedding.
“Oh,” Harry breathed. “I, uh, agree? Obviously?”
“Speaking as a somewhat objective party,” Draco said, feigning vague indifference. “What is it that you really want?”
Thirty minutes later, they made it to the entrance to the Forbidden Forest. Harry was looking a little bit green, but he was determined to get this over with so he could have his hangover cure.
“So you’re here for business over pleasure, too?  I was supposed to meet with somebody about International Quidditch standards, but he hasn’t shown up yet either.”
“I think Percy likes red wine?” Harry asked with clear confusion.
I have to admit, I’m a little disappointed with Order of the Phoenix. As the longest book in the series, I expected there to at least be a proportional amount of Drarry. But, as it turns out, it took nearly 200 pages before Draco is even referenced. Much like Umbridge’s speech, though, there is some important information hidden in the 800 pages of waffle and, fittingly, it’s Hermione who is able to find and explain it to the reader.
“Yeah, but that was different. It was a holiday and I was an unexpected guest, of course they were going to act like it was okay. But this is a
“I don’t have much time, what is it?” Oliver didn’t bother looking up from the stack of Quidditch game notes in front of him.
“He was a major part of the redesign of the Quidditch uniforms to be more aerodynamic and safe, he worked as an ambassador to include more countries in the World Cup which strengthened our diplomatic relationships all around,” Harry continued. “And honestly, just think of the seats that Bagman got your dad for the World Cup when he was in Wood’s position, I bet Oliver can get seats like that whenever he wants.”
Oliver fetched the rusty kettle that he always had Draco set up as a portkey.  Draco seemed a little off this last week...ever since he had told Percy about Harry’s strange outburst regarding Percy and Cormac and the plans for the house.  Oliver briefly considered that maybe getting his assistant (and his assistant’s school rival) involved in his own personal life and house hunting was a step too far. But no, that was what Draco was here for, and he was normally a surprisingly efficient and hard worker. Perhaps when he and Percy got back from this Quidditch match and finished closing on the home, he would have some words with Draco and discuss his current underperformance.
“Er, sorry, Profess-I mean, Headmistress.  Floo isn’t exactly my preferred method of travel.” He shook his shaggy hair out and put his luggage down.
Dumbledore said it best in his final scene:
The music continued to play as the pair twirled around the dance floor laughing. They stopped spinning as the music slowed and Harry felt a tap on his shoulder.
Hogwarts Hottie?!” Ron asked Harry a little too loudly when he sat down. Harry quickly shook his head. Draco looked away. Mrs. Weasley walked in from the kitchen holding up her wand with dozens of dishes following behind her in the air.
"Are you serious?" Harry caught his wand and the movement caused the devil's snare to spread farther. "I ask you to do one thing and you can't even do that?"
“There’s a hangover potion you can drink,” Neville said. “But we’re going to have to go into the Forbidden Forest to get the ingredients. Think you can handle that? It’s a job that requires more than one person.”
“Figure something out.” He said as they arrived at the seventh floor. “You can finish the report on hoop stability when you get back with my dinner.”
,” Draco said scathingly, “The glasses only refill themselves when left on the table. It’d hardly be safe for them to refill themselves while someone was actively in the process of drinking.”
“When Percy what, Malfoy.”
Drarry, like all good head-canon ships, requires a little bit of ingenuity on the part of the shipper. Just because Harry and Draco don’t end up together during the seven books does not mean that Drarry isn’t plausible. There are three steps to becoming a Drarry believer. There isn’t a particular order for the steps, but you can’t truly take up residence in the Drarry dumpster unless you follow these rules.
“Okay, if you think you have a better idea, tell me,” Harry accepted the beverage.
(460)
“We just recently began talking. Cormac’s uncle is an old friend and he suggested Cormac and I get to know each other better. He thinks we’d make a fine match.” Percy didn’t notice Draco’s brief moment of shock. The one positive of growing up a Malfoy was his ability to quickly school his features into a mask of indifference. “Please understand this is a matter of utmost privacy, of course.” Percy continued.
Harry isn’t wrong that Draco sent Dobby, and I’m sure that Draco would be very glad that Harry jumped to the conclusion that he did it out of malice. But I think that he had other motivations. First, if Draco has spent the summer back in Malfoy Manor and outside of the influence of Hogwarts, he’s probably starting to figure out that his world is different from the wizarding world as a whole. For a twelve-year-old, this knowledge is probably overwhelming, and Draco being the coward that he is, figures that the best way to deal with a threat is to remove it completely. He can’t not go to Hogwarts, but Harry Potter is the embodiment of his self-questioning. If he can remove Harry Potter from the equation, then he can continue to ignore the other thoughts he’s having that might lead him to question his upbringing. No Harry Potter means no crush and that means he can go on with life as he always has.
“It would be if the work week was over. But I’m supposed to be meeting with someone, and it appears as though they aren’t able to tell time,” Percy responded.
******************
Slightly before 10:15, Harry knocked on Percy’s door and ushered him to the lift for one of his many scheduled meetings. Harry followed Percy into the lift and casually leaned against the buttons to “accidentally” stop it on Draco and Oliver’s floor. The doors opened on the seventh floor and Oliver walked in as Harry slipped out with the excuse of needing to return to his desk to send a last minute memo to the Muggle Liaison Office. Draco quickly sent a message to Stan to make sure that the elevator wouldn’t make any additional stops.
“Cormac needs another chaser for the Quidditch match today, and you’re the only person I can think of on such short notice. Fancy playing a round?”
“Are you sure they would want me there? Just in case you forgot,” He raised his sleeve quickly to remind Harry of the Dark Mark branded on his forearm.
“Master McLaggen has retired for the night, sir, and is not to be disturbed,” the house elf squeaked. With a bow, she closed the door in Draco’s face. Draco tilted his head back and groaned.
“I’m only here because I needed some additional potions ingredients,” Draco drawled, stepping out from behind the tree. “But sure, you’re welcome.”
“I suppose you’re right. I let the jitters get the best of me.” Hermione smiled at Harry. “Thanks for talking some sense into me.”
“Thanks, doll,” Draco said, sauntering past Harry, who was glaring at him, and out the door. Harry, of course, followed Draco. He grabbed Draco’s shoulder and spun him around.
“I think we should probably be getting back up to the castle now,” Neville replied.
“While I can’t imagine anyone willingly subjecting themselves to my brother, nor him finding someone so exponentially out of his league-” Ginny faltered as Ron made a valiant effort to kick her under the table, “I am very happy for the two of you.  It’s also nice that Ron removed his head from his arse and finally realized he should lock Hermione in before she wised up and ran off with Viktor Krum.” Ginny deftly stepped to the other side of her chair before Ron could make a second attempt at kicking her. “Cheers to the happy couple!” Everyone took a healthy swig from their glass and conversation resumed around the table.
“What has you so upset? I haven’t seen you like this since O.W.L.S.”
He rushed around his desk and tried to finish at least one assignment before he left to meet Draco at the row house they were looking at for Percy and Oliver. He checked his watch, ten more minutes, Draco was going to be annoyed.  He was just about to head out when a delivery wizard approached him.
Harry looked up as he heard the diner door chime, and saw Draco’s blond head disappear into the diner. “That son of a bitch.” Harry sprinted into the diner behind him, and watched with horror as Draco sweet-talked the cashier.
“This looks idiotic,” Draco said pulling his chair over to the same side of the table as Harry.
“I thought perhaps the two of you were working things out,” McGonagall mused. “Or were you rekindling the flames of your schooltime rivalry? Whichever the case, I must insist that you try to at least
(134)
By the time Harry arrived at the Quidditch Pitch, a crowd was already forming at the entrance. He got in line, and out of habit pulled his Holyhead Harpies’ cap down a bit to shield his scar from view.  He didn’t get recognized quite as much as he used to. His defeat of Voldemort was old news--there was always some new trouble brewing that grabbed people’s attention. It also probably had something to do with his request to keep his name out of the papers after a raid. He opted for generic descriptions like “auror” or “ministry official” if an article had to be written. He was still one of the younger aurors in the office, since he insisted that he start at the bottom and work his way up just like everyone else, so his superiors were usually the people who got credit anyway.  Harry thought it was better this way. He liked the fact that he had earned his job through hard work and not just his last name.
“Yes, well, I would hope it would be clear a man of my caliber would be interested in something more refined. Anyone worth associating with would be able to tell that.” Percy said, slightly puffing his chest before his eyes darted to the pile of papers on Harry’s desk. “Please organize this mess and finish those reports. I don’t employ you to be an office decoration.” Percy turned on his heel and strode back into his office. This time the door did slam, so hard that the mug on Harry’s desk rattled and nearly fell over.
“You know it pains me to defend a Weasley, but it is her day too, you know.” Draco said. Somewhat distracted by Harry’s outburst, Draco began adding more milk to his tea than normal.  Harry reached across the table to still Draco’s hand before carrying on with his wedding rant.
Tilly glared and gestured towards the door. “Seriously? Harry’s.”
Hot burning tore through Harry, cut him in two, so painful he couldn’t scream. And blood gushed out, soaking through his clothes and running onto the floor. Harry tried to look, to see the damage, but he couldn’t move his head without nearly blacking out from the pain.
Harry didn’t and he had some questions now about wolfsbane. He could take Teddy to school and then stop at Malfoy’s flat. “Thanks.” Harry nodded and gathered his things.
“Wow, that’s really--” Ginny broke off suddenly, and looked straight at him. “Wait, what are we talking about?”
Malfoy set the plate down on the nightstand and then made his careful drunken way back to the kitchen for the maple syrup and a glass of orange juice.
Maybe they would be desperate and needy, barely bothering to pull off all their clothes before rutting and gasping their way into a shattering release. But Harry rather hoped they’d be slow, and he would get to carefully peel Draco out of the clothes Harry had brought from home for Draco to wear. That’s he’d get the chance to kiss and lick his way across every inch of that pale, scarred, perfect skin. And maybe his tongue would make it into a warm, tight place. Maybe Draco’s would. But it would be soft and careful, because Harry had no intention of letting Draco go. He was going to keep Draco this time.
So, briefly, for those who care, I originally wrote the first two parts of this story at the same time I wrote To Sleep Perchance to Dream. And I had all of these really lovely ideas for parts three and four. Except, when I sat down to write them, I literally could not make it past the first scene. I had all these ideas about how Harry and Draco kept in contact, mostly through text and they had this weird sort of amazing long distance thing going on that was all going to be resolved in part 4. Except part four never really made it past the first scene--I tried several times.
And Tilly laughed, laughed hard until tears leaked from her eyes, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh too, clutching at her hand. It was hard, but Draco managed to get out, between nearly crippling bouts of laughter. “Tilly’s my friend, Mum. My best friend.”
“It’s going to be okay,” Draco quickly reassured her. “Harry is good. He defeated
“Oy! Mind the frame, that’s gold, you know!” One portrait shouted as Draco rummaged through the crates, shoving his hands into the sawdust. All the magic in the paint and porcelain meant that a clever thief could have hidden ingredients under a disillusionment charm and Draco wouldn’t be able to find them. A good disillusionment could hide an object from a less precise summoning charm.
Draco took out his shrunken bag, enlarged it, and then began to riffle through his papers to find what Hermione needed. They spent the rest of the morning discussing various ingredients, the pricing, and whether any less expensive substitutions would be possible. It was, all in all, a shockingly polite and productive conversation.
There was something comforting about the regular hustle and bustle of the Auror Office, and it was easy to shed any lingering unease from Draco. Harry let the lull of the conversation around him wash over, he nodded at those who greeted him, and he gave a friendly hello when prompted.
Draco smiled. “This is Faye, she’s an Alpha, like us not like Harry.”
Sophie gave Harry a long look and sighed visibly. “Well, I met Dray when I was working at this coffee shop, but then Tilly comes into the bar one day, dragging him behind her and insisting Mr. Johnson give him the busboy job.”
And Harry looked at Draco, at his grey eyes and the way his hair fell across his forehead, at the pinkness of his lips and the paleness of his eyelashes. He remembered walking into the kitchen in his dream and the pleased feeling in his belly. “We’re fighting.”
“No,” Harry growled, and that was the end of all conversation in the room for several hours.
“Oh,” she sighed, glanced at Atkinson, and clinked her glass on the table. “And just what has my old friend gotten himself into now?” She flopped back into the sofa, long, shapely leg revealed by the part in her robe. Harry was suddenly sure the cleavage had been intentional, but wasn’t exactly sure what Pansy hoped to gain by showing off all that skin.
As a distraction from that line of thinking, it worked perfectly because Harry realized he had a tidy pile of completed case files that only needed Robards’ signature before filing in Records. And Malfoy might still be in his office.
Sarah was glaring fiercely at Hermione. “What did you do that for?”
“They were just surprised to see you in a muggle place.”
Back at the office, Atkinson followed Harry into the Bullpen.
But Sophie just buried her head in her hands and cried harder. Draco and Chris shot panicked looks at Tilly, who just shook her head and gestured towards the till, which they correctly interpreted as “close everything down, I got this.”
“Thanks.” Harry returned the more than friendly smile and felt a bit icky, like he ought to wash his hands thoroughly after touching these things. And maybe he ought to burn the robes.
“You still should have told us, we had a right--”
“As long as it takes.” He was able to hear Malfoy sigh. “Don’t suppose you could escort me to Granger’s office?” he asked and it was borderline polite.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t know? Some kind of gun? Uh, but Robards is fine with me taking lead on this case?” Time to get back on subject.
He looked good, Harry realized, dressed in a grey suit--waistcoat, no jacket. White shirt open at the neck. His hair was cut long, along his jaw and falling into his eyes. He had an earring, and he’d filled out a bit. Not enormous, but Harry could see that his shoulders were broad and strong. Things he hadn’t noticed in the dim light of the club stood out in the harsh light of interrogation, like the pallor of his skin and the color of his eyes. In the club, Harry realized suddenly, Malfoy had been relaxed, but here he was full of tension.
“Are you done yet?” Jude demanded, a bit irritated.
It was Friday night before Jenkins heard back from Constable Hannaford. “Alright,” he started their nightly meeting as usual. “Still a normal Friday, still looking for any leads on the Were incidents, keep your ears to the ground and your eyes open. Potter and Val, my office.”
They all have a gay friend they want me to meet. DM
“That seems like it’s coming along.” Hermione stepped into the lab.
“What happened a long time ago.” It wasn’t a question.
Harry sank to his knees on the cold kitchen tile. “Maybe.” His hand wrapped around Draco’s cock. “Maybe I just want you.” He licked the head experimentally, and then sucked Draco down all the way. Draco sank his hands in Harry’s hair, holding tight.
“I know.” Harry knelt down in front of Teddy. “And we are all he has right now, and I promise I am going to take care of him, but right now, I need you to go downstairs and let Andromeda know what happened.”
“It’ll be fine.” Malfoy said suddenly. “Just, you know, stick with your house. It’ll be good.”
“She seems nice enough.” Harry drank deeply from his glass. “I don’t like her.”
Draco got up and wandered down the hall to listen in the doorway.
“He does, actually.” Ginny peered at him. “Could you imagine if it was really him?”
“No,” Jude shook his head, “firecall.”
He took a long drink while Draco tried to figure out what Harry Potter could possibly feel sorry about. “Why?”
“Well, you missed a huge row between Mum and me.” She flopped down on the sofa and propped her feet up on the coffee table. Right next to Malfoy’s plate, Harry couldn’t help but see.
He full on moped through the house now and had been doing so all day rather than do something productive or even vaguely energetic. So, when he finally crawled into bed at midnight, he spent it staring at the ceiling and thinking about how all the creaking couldn’t be Jude anymore because Jude wasn’t there to be doing things that would make the house creak.
“I’m not asking a question.” Harry tried again. “But that was some messed up shit, and you can’t expect me to-to deal with you dying on my bathroom floor every other night.”
But Draco didn’t take it. He looked at the tiny bit of silver uncertainly, the way he sometimes looked at Harry, Harry realized, as if he wanted but wasn’t certain if it was a good idea. “Are you sure you aren’t proposing?” He asked instead, voice quiet and careful.
“Probably.”
Harry took another long drink and then looked at the ceiling while he spoke, “For Friday.”
The stranger looked intrigued. “So you aren’t trying to get somewhere there?”
It had played on the WWN’s Witching Hour by another band, the Howling Ghouls. He’d listened to them play over and over and over as a child, laying his head down on the carpet while his mother read a book in the drawing room. She’d reach down sometimes and run her fingers through his hair or sigh at a particular song, and very occasionally hum along with an old classic.
Tilly reached out carefully and drew his left hand towards her, she gently turned it over, baring the Dark Mark in the evening light. She ran several fingers across the entire length of it, stopping only at the burn mark left in the center of his wrist. “The first step to changing is admitting you want to.” She looked up at Draco. “You aren’t that boy any more, and you haven’t been for a long time. I am sorry that they can’t see that, and I am sorry I put you in that room with her.”
There was some grunting and gasping, and Draco tried very hard not to breath for several moments as panic flooded his body. He was chained in a closet while two people were having sex in the room! Sex! They were getting off on him being chained in a closet! Draco scrambled, kicking the wall and pulling on the chains and trying desperately to push himself farther into the corner, as if he could melt into the wall.
Around them, Aurors popped into the lab with loud cracks. From the edge of his vision, Harry could see a team from St. Mungo’s, Robards, Ron. Harry turned his head, hands still around Draco, to see them. “I’m okay,” Harry said, breathing normally.
It took five minutes for him to climb back into the booth. “God, I needed that. I haven’t laughed like that in so long.” He wiped tears from his eyes. “Oh, jesus. What were we talking about?”
him. “Mine.”
Harry settled Jude’s trunk just inside the door to his room in Grimmauld Place. He hadn’t set foot in this house since Christmas, when Jude had come home for the holidays, and it felt odd to be back. It smelled dusty from being shut up for months, but there was light from the windows and the floors were clean. It hadn’t gone to pot in the time Harry and Jude had been gone like Harry had feared it might. The house had been shut up for so long by the time Harry had inherited it that he had been afraid it had become sentient with the personality of a hoarder who died and was eaten by its feral cats.
It was about an hour before Draco heard anyone else on the staircase, and at first he thought it was Teddy because the steps were light, clearly not those of an adult. But they were slow, too slow, and a prickle of fear ran up Draco's spine. Who could be coming up the stairs? And then he heard a second set of feet, moving just as slowly.
Draco carefully put his fork down and folded his hands in his lap to keep them still. “It’s an art, Potter, not a science. Depending on the variety of wolfsbane, the growing season, it can be more or less potent. The color of the flower can impact that too. Each potioneer has different ideas about what makes the most effective potion.”
“Didn’t I give you clean clothes this morning?”
It was harder for Malfoy to detangle himself as Teddy had grabbed his shirt, and pushed his leg over one of Malfoy’s. And it was with surprising patience, that Harry watched Malfoy slowly uncurl his fingers and carefully ease his leg out of the bed. But he paused before actually getting out of the bed, “He won’t wake, will he?”
“Well,” Harry started to say, and then Draco was slipping an arm around his waist and leaning into him.
Faye slipped her hand into Vale’s. “But good. It’s good for these things to be known. We can’t ever really have a place to belong as long as there are secrets.”
“It’s been a long day. Atkinson was at my desk, I had a meeting with my boss, and everyone in the office was an idiot.” Harry sighed loudly. “Just tell me if you ate or not.”
There was a heartbeat of silence. “Shit. Yeah. What happened? Shut up, you fucker, I gotta take this call! Piss off! Sorry, still at the office.”
Harry glared back in response and placed gentle fingers back on Draco’s shoulder, carefully flexing it back and forth. Draco winced, but made no sound. “I don’t think you broke anything, but you’ll probably have a nasty bruise.”
Where Malfoy was pacing back and forth across the living room chewing on his thumb and mumbling to himself. And after Atkinson, it was more than anyone could handle, really. Harry wiped his hand across his face, and said, “I want answers, Malfoy.”
“Consider my offer.” Atkinson clasped him on the shoulder and horror flooded through Harry at the intimate contact. “Could do wonderful things for your career.” And then he was leaving, billowing his way out of the room, and Harry was breathing and trying to remember how to deal with a panic attack.
“Yeah, but you like it when I unload the dishwasher.”
Harry nodded sympathetically, but it had been four months of nonstop outreach and she hadn’t made much headway. And while Harry wanted to help Hermione, while Shacklebolt insisted on having an Auror presence at these meetings to show the entire ministry was behind the movement, Harry just couldn’t spend all of his time thinking about outreach. He had cases to handle, and Grimmauld Place needed work, and there was Teddy and Andromeda, and sometimes he wanted to spend time with Ginny and figure out what was going on with that part of his life.
“Shut up,” Harry muttered, but pushed open the door. Ron and Hermione were in a corner booth, while Ginny was getting a round of drinks from the bar. Maisie, Oliver, and a few other Aurors were playing billiards. Maisie waved when she saw Harry by the door, and Harry gave her a smile and a nod before heading over to Ron and Hermione.
“What was the potion?” Harry had to ask, but he already knew. There was only one potion that any Were would be talking about during this week.
“Being an Auror
“You know how he gets. If he is determined to hide from you--” she shrugged.
Harry started to say something, something about--well, he didn’t know what, which was fine because Andromeda reappeared with a plate heaped with pancakes that she set in the middle of the table. Teddy immediately reached out, until Draco elbowed him in the side. “Wait your turn.”
“And his research,” Hermione sighed a little longingly. “I mean, I can’t talk about it, but there are a lot of people who would put up with a rude boss just to be involved in that kind of work. It’s going to completely change the way we think about magic.”
Draco cleared his throat loudly and raised his glass. “To buying a bar!”
Malfoy laughed until he cried, still behind the refrigerator door but clutching at his side, Harry could tell from the way his shoulders moved. He grabbed his wand off the counter and flicked the door shut, so that the only light came from the tiny high window at the other end of the room. And then he cast again, flicking on the lights and Harry got his first good look.
just shag it out of their systems so that they didn’t have to have those rows in the middle of the street.
“What do you mean? We’re shopping.” But she had to know that wasn’t what Harry meant.
Val whistled. “Robards is going to shit kittens.”
Draco steps ceased.
“Atkinson did that to you, he-he stole your magic, he-he forced you--”
Draco recognized her I-have-had-enough-of-your-nonsense expression, scowled at the floor, and said darkly, “Nope, damage already done.”
“Yeah, why?”
Draco was having some trouble listening to what Harry was actually saying. He was trying to let the tone and voice just sort of wash over him, hoping it would soothe all those nerves he had about Luis being here and Henri being there. He padded quietly into the kitchen and got out a glass for water. It was cool in his hand, and Draco pressed it against his face trying to cool the angry flush there. But all he could see was Luis in his lab, and the way Henri had watched Harry at that conference--god was that really a year an a half ago? Those memories were bringing up all kinds of uncomfortable feelings that Draco really wasn’t interested in examining too closely right now.
When Harry finally looked back up, looked Malfoy in the eye, there was something else in his expression, something Harry was a little bit afraid of. “Malfoy.” He nodded, and Malfoy dropped his hand and the flash of cameras went off all around them.
Draco took a deep breath. “No one at your party except me will have to drink the tea.”
Dean sighed again. “I can’t make that promise either.”
Draco nodded, rubbing his check against Harry’s hand. “Only if you promise not to push me out in the morning.” He tried to scowl, but it ended up as more of a lopsided grin.
Granger followed him into the room. “Harry said he’d be at Grimmauld Place tonight, but that’d he’d take some time at lunch to check on you tomorrow.”
“Oh, well, I told them you sorted it. Other experts wanted to give it a try, and I told them Hermione had found a way to contain the dark energy. But, since they were likely to talk to Ron who would know it was a lie, I had to tell him the truth.” Harry smiled slightly and shrugged at Draco. “It was kind of impressive, what you did. Everyone else just started casting at it, but you took the time to understand the mechanics. Even Hermione was impressed.”
Harry woke up, Monday morning, to the smell of cheesy eggs. And whistling. Malfoy was whistling in the kitchen. That must mean he hadn’t died of blood loss in the middle of the night, that or ghosts could crack eggs and hold a skillet. Harry pulled back the blankets and went to see.
He’d been avoiding anything magical, to the point that his wand had spent the last month nestled in Tilly’s unmentionables. Going someplace that even reminded him of Barty Crouch and the Ministry made Draco uncomfortable, which was, he told himself sternly, utterly ridiculous.
Faye nodded first and just once. Shacklebolt considered for a moment, and then also agreed. “Fine, Potter, get in touch with my secretary and we will arrange a meeting. Ms. Faye, it was a pleasure to meet you.” The wolf at her side growled. “And, Vale was it? A pleasure as well. Robards, I believe we are scheduled to meet tomorrow at two? I will have my secretary move that appointment earlier in the day. Good night.” And he apparated away.
“Alright,” Ron said hesitantly.
“Do you remember when we built this place?”
“I can help, if you want,” Draco offered.
“Anytime.” Dr. Connor waved his hand.
Tilly sighed. “I’m sorry.” And unlike other times this happened, Tilly actually was sorry in this case. She even met Evan’s gaze, her eyes dropping to his mouth.
“I’m Sophie.” She said, pouring one handed while Baby Abe wiggled on her hip and tried to grab a lemon from on top of the bar. “And you’re the idiot who seems to have attracted everyone’s attention.”
“You couldn't narrow it down any farther for me?” Harry gestured vaguely toward the thirty hours of memories it would take him no less than thirty hours to view.
Draco’s bedmate sat up and began kissing along Draco’s shoulder and neck. “Get rid of him.” He trailed a hand along Draco’s thigh.
“Really?” Ginny looked utterly horrified at the thought. “I can’t imagine not seeing my mum in that long, although, I could probably go a month or two and not be upset. But four years? That’s a long time.”
“Ron and Hermione managed it.”
Tilly pulled up the sleeve, the button for his cuff now long lost, and gasped. She ran one finger down the entire length of the Dark Mark while tears leaked out of Draco’s eyes. “Shit.”
“Woah, Potter, Robards know you have those?”
“And that’s how you knew Hermione was pregnant!” Harry exclaimed.
“What about you--is it Draco?”
Draco picked up his phone and waved it. “You could have texted.”
“If you aren’t sleeping with him, and he is sleeping with my sister, why did he just declare his love for you?” Why was he asking all the questions that Draco couldn’t answer. Was afraid to answer.
It was selfish.
Suddenly it was just the two of them and the music and Harry swallowed hard. He could do this, he could. They’d done it before, the dancing and the touching in the sweat and heat of the club. And Harry had wanted him that night too. He’d done it that night, and he could do it this night too. He could dance and enjoy the feeling of Draco in his arms, the slide of sweat slicked skin, the harsh grind, the adrenaline and endorphins that raced through him, urging him closer and harder and faster and more.
“What will Trevor say?” Ron asked, putting a gentle hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco’s hands shook and he shoved them between his knees. “I won’t help you,” he whispered.
“Partner up, people! Stick together and guard your backs. These guys move fast and hit hard. If you see green potions, and I’m talking healer green, send a patronus, that’s Unspeakable territory. Now let’s go.” Robards grabbed onto Cox and they were gone.
“It’s Mum,” was all Ron said.
And Draco smiled even though it wasn’t funny, even though it was in fact meaningless when it came to explaining an entire new, hidden world. But Draco didn’t have to explain everything about magic, he just needed to tell his story, “I guess it starts with the Boy Who Lived.”
“I’m not. I want to help them.”
“I never think of him that way. To me, he’s just Teddy.”
“It’s very basic hormones, Harry.” She continued in a condescending tone. “They’re designed to make you want to stick around in case of a pregnancy, which is patently ridiculous between two men, but this is basic biology we’re talking about here.”
She nodded, if possible, even more emphatically and her hand shook as she held the magazine out to him. “I’ll bring it back.” And then he stormed into his office and slammed the door.
Harry had been cutting potatoes when Malfoy said this, and he remembered that Malfoy didn’t have a wand. It was such a strange thing, after all this time, to encounter a wizard without one. “You could always use my spare wand,” he suggested.
Andromeda looked at Harry, both trying to decide if that was what was best for Teddy, weighing that against the benefit to Draco.
“Does she know about me?” Draco said softly to Andromeda.
“It’s Saturday.” Evan scowled. “What has gotten into you?”
Hermione nodded, and they talked shop for the walk out to the Thai place. It was a small place stuffed full of plush chairs and thousands of tiny framed pictures while a large buddha occupied a corner by the door. She steered them to a booth in the back, and installed herself on one side, leaving Harry a clear view of the door. He paused for a moment before sitting down. Back to a wall, clear sight of the door. When had Hermione started picking tables just because they made Harry more comfortable?
Alice nodded. “He told it to my whole pack, too. My Alpha really likes that story.”
“Yeah, I just--with Harry--”
But if it was straight forward revenge, why come to Harry? Why insist that Harry figure out what Draco stole? Why have that Vow? Those answers weren’t straight forward.
Perhaps the most telling thing that Dumbledore says in this moment was when he questions why Draco would have let Fenrir come to the school where so many children were and Draco admits that he didn’t, he didn’t know that Fenrir was going to invite himself. Draco cared about the collateral damage, even if he doesn’t want to admit that. There’s also the fact that Draco had Dumbledore alone, and he couldn’t do it. It’s all fun and games when you’re not the one who has to do the murdering, and it was easier for Draco to compartmentalize when he was only hearing about the deaths of a bunch of faceless blood traitors without having any personal stake in it. But when suddenly there was a face to go with the name, and the face was standing right in front of him and he was the one who was supposed to do the killing, I believe he really started to understand the magnitude of how evil Voldemort was.
“It appears so,” Ginny said. “That’s the way it was supposed to be all along, you know. Lucky that Charlie happened to be at that Quidditch match. Thank Merlin Draco got there in time to stop Oliver.”
“Just a letter I was drafting,” Roger said hurriedly and went to snatch it back. But Harry was too quick for him and had already begun to read what was written. A lot had been scratched out with edits in the margins, and even though it appeared to be the first of many pages Harry was able to get the gist.
“I… I think I need to talk to Ginny.” Harry grabbed Draco’s hands from across the table. “But I can’t deny that you’ve been there for me these past few years. And you’ve always been an important part of my life, even when we weren’t exactly friendly with each other. You always motivated me to be a better person. And I have this sneaking suspicion I can’t really get rid of you. You’ll always be a part of my life.”
“The Weasley’s house. For the engagement party and Christmas dinner. I had already hinted that I’d be bringing Hogwarts Hottie so there will definitely be plenty of food. It’ll get your mind off what a jerk Cormac is, and I’m sure any one of the Weasleys would be happy to talk shit about him if you wanted.” Harry shrugged, trying to make it look like he didn’t care either way what Draco’s response was.
“Right, reporting to Oliver Wood in regard to magical sports is incredibly important work.” Harry replied, sarcastically.  “Must really make ole Lucius proud, to work in such a prestigious department, and for a Gryffindor no less.” Harry smirked while staring Draco down.
“Something taste different, Potter?” Draco had the nerve to smirk.
“We aren’t friends really, right Draco?  Acquaintances at best. Just know each other in passing.”
“Right, sorry Harry. I just want you to be ready for this next step.  It’s an important part of the healing process.”
“He’s been seeing Cormac.” Harry said with a straight face.
he finds out, right?” Draco corrected. “Because surely you’re not suggesting to me that after all of this, you’re going to tell Oliver. He would fire me, for sure. And I already confided in you that this was the best and only job I was able to find.”
“Let them? I had no idea they were going.  Oliver purchased the tickets, why didn’t
“Oh, shite.” Harry bit his lip. Draco was pleased to see that he at least had the decency to look embarrassed. “I...didn’t know.”
Draco cares about his academics and he wants to do well. He’s a Slytherin and he wants to be the best. Being the best does not typically involve screwing up an important exam (or losing Quidditch matches), but Draco willingly does both in favor of looking at Harry. He also is genuinely sulky and disappointed when Umbridge won’t allow him to go with her, Hermione, and Harry to visit Grawp. He clearly wants to take the opportunity to be around Harry rather than stay in Hogwarts.
Draco rolled his eyes before responding, “I have it on good authority that Percy Weasley and Oliver Wood play for the same team, if you catch my drift.”
“When,” Draco sighed. “When Percy was at his house discussing the arrangement that Cormac’s uncle had suggested.”
“Actually,” Harry said, feeling the need to defend himself. “I stopped reading the Prophet ages ago, so much gossip.”
Harry, realizing Malfoy wasn’t going to join him, and still drunk from dinner and the drinking that followed, stopped mid-flail.
“What sort of favor?” Harry asked curiously.
“Well maybe,” Harry retorted. “You should have considered the optics when you decided to align yourself with Voldemort.”
“And finally, you may notice a new, but recognizable, face at our staff table.” McGonagall motioned towards Harry. “This is Harry Potter. He worked as an auror for many years after he defeated You-Know-Who, and has graciously returned to Hogwarts to share what he’s learned with all of you as the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. May we all have a successful year, and enjoy the feast!”
“I thought you said this was brewed to
Draco hurried out of Malfoy Manor on Christmas morning. As glad as he was that he and Harry had managed to smooth over Percy and Oliver’s first big fight in enough time for the Christmas Holiday Trip to still happen, he realized as soon as he stepped foot on the sprawling grounds just how much he relied on the excuse of working for Wood to get through the holiday season.
“Yes. I know. You’re a werewolf, Harry.”
“What can I say, sometimes people change and surprise you.” Ginny shrugged.
Harry gulped.
"Oh good," she said. "You're both here. Hurry up and get in here before too many students show up and start asking questions.
“Shit.” Harry said, patting himself down. “I was trying to get some work done before I came upstairs and I must have forgotten my cloak. Go on without me, I’ll just meet you at the house.”
The next morning Harry rolled out of bed just in time to nick some toast from the Great Hall before his first class of the day.  Despite being rushed and a little overwhelmed by the sheer volume of children in the halls, Harry made it to his classroom before the majority of his students and even managed to tuck in his shirt and look somewhat presentable.  Hermione’s voice telling him to make a good impression floated through his head unbidden and he found himself straightening his robes as the last student took his seat.
“Malfoy, I’ve worked up an appetite with all of this dancing.  I need Indian food right now. Want to get out of here?”
Draco hurried down the sidewalk toward Cormac’s.  He had barely seen him since Christmas and while he was still a little miffed about being sidelined in favor of Harry, he also wanted to get laid. Draco managed to not scowl while rapping the hideous door-knocker and waited for Cormac or his house elf to answer the door.  He hadn’t owled ahead of time, but he figured Cormac would be as desperate for a lay as he was, so the lack of courtesy would be forgiven. When the door still hadn’t been opened a minute later, Draco began to get truly impatient. He was just about to knock on the door again, when the house elf opened the door.
“History shouldn’t just be brushed under the rug. It’s how we got to this point!”
Harry looked between the two of them, astonished, how was Malfoy so much better at this then Harry?
Harry took his own sip of tea; it had been a long time since he laughed. “Yeah, no, I think that’s important too.”
“Did he have depression?”
It wasn’t any wonder that his dreams with Potter shifted from the empty white place where they mostly shouted at each other to sweating clubs. Draco remembered the first one, remembered dancing in the club, someone grinding against his ass, hands firm on his hips, breath hot and heavy on his ear.
Her amber eyes went wide and her fingers light, and Harry just wanted to get this right. He wanted it to be perfect for her, and he didn’t have the slightest clue how to do that. She reached up and ran her fingers along his jaw, and Harry was grateful Jude had insisted he shave. Harry didn’t want to scratch her, didn’t want to leave bruises or anything else on her. He just wanted her to feel good.
“Thanks for coming on such short notice,”  Neville called out.
“Plus, you reek.” Ginny added playfully.
“Okay, we’re almost back. I think that maybe it would be better if you stayed in my room tonight,” Neville put his arm around Harry to keep him from falling over again.
“You know you don’t have to order for me” Harry said.
“You’re probably wondering why Oliver and I called this meeting,” Percy began.
It starts even before they get to the Hogwarts Express. Harry runs into Malfoy at Madam Malkin’s, in a scene that mirrors their first interaction. After they met in Sorcerer’s Stone, their relationship shifted into the Enemies/Rivals phase, and now at the beginning of this book they meet in a similar fashion, perhaps foreshadowing that a shift into the Friends stage is in their future.
“He’s got you there, George.  Plus, it’s hard to make fun of him when he does it so well himself, eh?” Harry laughed.
“It’s nearly nine, there’s not going to be much open,” Draco pointed out. But Oliver was not deterred.
“I’ll see you out, Draco.” Cormac said tersely, then continued to Percy, “It’s only polite to see a guest out.”
“He can use yours,” Cormac replied. Draco’s hands instinctively clutched his broom tighter. “If Harry’s playing Seeker you won’t need it.”
“Have you always been so drunk?” Neville extended his hand and pulled Harry up to his feet.
“That’s not a half bad idea, Gin.” Harry responded.
Harry rushed after Draco to catch the lift he was stepping into, but Draco shut the door right as Harry reached him.
Draco and Harry circled the small dance floor once. It was crowded with people and even though he was wearing his glasses, Harry was having a hard time making out people’s appearances beyond vague shadows and the occasional flash of color.
Oliver Wood threw his cloak over his shoulder as he entered The Leaky Cauldron. The bar wasn’t exactly big and he immediately saw Percy was seated at a stool alone.  What Draco had said to him the other day rolled around in his mind.  Maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea to sit somewhat close to Percy while he waited for his peer to join. He could try to be civil.
“Uh, yeah, but,” Harry stepped away. “Not gonna happen.” He took the drinks from the bartender and moved quickly back to the safety of the Weasley’s. He pretended not to notice how Oliver’s eyes followed him through the room.
Well! Harry certainly wasn’t going to apologize for being short! “I just wanted to know what you heard and saw.”
“How do you know he hasn’t imperioused these muggles you say he lives with?”
Suddenly, Draco’s arms snapped to his sides, his legs sprang together, and his whole body went rigid on the stool. He swayed for a moment and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. His jaw was clenched tight leaving only his eyes to move. He watched, in horror, as Luis’s feet came into view. What had happened to him? Why couldn’t he move? Luis had not cast, he wand had not moved, no words had left his mouth.  How was Draco frozen?
“I heard that!” Mama Gigi shouted, but the tips of her ears were turning just the littlest bit pink.
Harry knocked on the door, loud enough to wake the neighbors, but there wasn’t a sound from inside. “Alohomora.” Harry tapped the door, and then walked inside.
It happened so fast that afterwards, Draco was not quite sure what precisely happened. The Auror department sent Unspeakables to study the events, to understand, because in the moment all anyone knew was that Draco launched himself at Luis, Harry cast a Protego, and then Luis exploded, blood and bone raining down and soaking through Draco’s clothes as he landed in a puddle.
Again, Mr. and Mrs. Green looked at each other. “Well, Sawyer changed, after his accident. And one day, this boy, Ajax, came to the flat to speak with him. They talked for a long time, and Ajax told us that-that he’d make sure Sawyer was okay, make sure--make sure--” She cut herself off suddenly.
Harry leapt out of bed, fear lending him speed. “Don’t touch me!” Draco cried, scooting backwards to slam painfully into the door.
“Wrong!” Atkinson cast again, and Harry activated the Seeing Eye.
“Please. I prefer my men not half starved and crazy. And I prefer my crazy houseguests to wear clean clothes. Next time just find something in my closet to wear and put the dirty clothes in the hamper.” He didn’t look at Malfoy, but the silence emanating from Malfoy was palpable.
“I’m glad you were there,” Harry said, not looking at him. “I--and not just because you scared away Oliver.” He also wasn’t quite sure about the right words.
Harry hurried through the door. “Lay him on the sofa,” Grace said while grabbing something off a bookshelf. “Thanks.” She pushed Harry back and inspected the wounds on Draco’s arms. “What happened?”
“Okay.” Harry stood up. He led them up to the second floor bath, started the water and got out the shampoo and soap. And then he left them alone in favor of a whiskey sour which would be found in the downstairs parlor.
But usually Parkinson didn’t deny Draco’s presence.
Harry backed up and watched McKenna and his partner set up their spells. First a general magic detection charm.
“The same reason you won’t tell me your name.” If they had been anywhere else, Harry would have owned up to smell, but he wasn’t about to share anything about Teddy or Draco with Thompson.
“I just don’t want to be alone there.”
Usually, Harry skipped breakfast or grabbed something terrible from the canteen. “Uh, sure?”
“I haven’t been around to any of the department functions.”
Harry thought about the long walk up the stairs. “I think I’d rather sleep on the sofa.”
“I suppose it’s cultural.”
“I told you.” Draco scowled. “Roxi has sisters.”
“C’est une affaire, une affaire de quinze ans. Vous ne pouvez vous engager envers personne d’autre, vous avez ce Harry!” Luc shouted and slammed the door shut.
“What?” Harry asked, a little dumbfounded, but Malfoy was nodding to something in the conversation, and his hand was trailing up Harry’s thigh, and Harry jerked violently.
Draco sucked in a breath, and said, as calmly as he could under the circumstances. “I need someone with a wand. Can you come to the Port now?”
Draco just shook his head and joined the nearest line. The more hands there were, the sooner the work would be done, the sooner Luis would leave.
Harry took a swallow to give himself a moment. “She’s not gonna come over again, is she?”
“Potions and advanced charms. He hated divination with a passion. He was very interested in Quidditch but didn’t really follow any specific team. He read a lot, actually quite bookish when he put his mind to it.”
“Thank you for the flowers,” Percy said, twirling the note from the arrangement between his fingers. “You have very sophisticated taste.” There was a pause while the person on the other end of the phone spoke.
“Well, it looks to me like I just bought my boss some dinner. What exactly did I order?” Draco said looking into the styrofoam container at the top of the pile. “Pancakes?”
Even Voldemort is suspicious of Draco’s allegiance later on. Lucius is concerned about the well-being of his son. But Voldemort retorts,
He was used to a revolving door of women, each as haughty and pureblood as the next. But then, a few months ago, Ginny Weasley had stumbled in giggling with Pansy after a night out drinking. Pansy had mentioned her occasionally, they were both employees at the Daily Prophet (Pansy was a gossip columnist, Ginny covered Quidditch), but he hadn’t realized they were
"I didn't know how," Draco said through gritted teeth. "I gave you your wand back. You could have helped yourself."
“Mind if I join you?” Harry asked, motioning to an empty chair next to them.
“Oh dear, I think you may have broken him.” Pansy barely stifled a laugh at Draco’s expense.
“Scared, Potter?” Draco answered, gently squeezing their joined hands.
“It’d be fine! Your past is ancient history at this point, they aren’t going to hold it against you, especially if you’re with me.”
Draco put his head in his hands and tried to pinpoint the moment when things turned to shit. It dawned on him that his fight with McLaggen, and subsequent breakup, happened nearly a month ago. Even though it was embarrassing and unpleasant, he had only been operating under this fog of gloom for the last week, so he couldn’t honestly attribute this feeling solely to his breakup.
“He doesn’t even have a broomstick!” Draco added.
“I figured I would drop by to say hello.  I wasn’t aware he’d have company. I didn’t know the two of you were friends,
Harry caught himself walking up to the owlery to send Draco a note about the Potions job, but then he remembered that Malfoy was probably still mad at him for telling Oliver and wouldn’t be interested in anything he had to say. Instead, he wandered back to Hogsmeade and stopped in Honeydukes to buy himself some sweets. He also picked up some sugar quills for Hermione, chocolate frogs for Ron, and acid pops for Ginny as a thank you for getting him to leave the couch.
“With… each other?” Harry asked with a confused look on his face.
“Well, Malfoy, I think you might just need to try loosening up a bit. No one’s paying us any attention right now anyway.”  Harry gestured around to the group that was spaced sporadically throughout the tent. “Now is as safe of a time as any.” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm to pull him toward himself and began flailing about more earnestly than before.
Percy was not one to turn down free...anything, so he took a deep breath and chugged. Oliver was both incredibly impressed and shocked, but held up his end of the bargain and got the attention of Tom so he could purchase another round. This time though, they’d be shooting Firewhiskey.
“Honey,” Cormac said in a stage whisper. “You know how important this match is to me, and you know that I have the best chance of winning if he’s the Seeker.”
******************
“It might help if you use your words,” Ginny prodded Draco with her foot.
“I’m happy for you.” Harry gave him a small smile and patted him on his shoulder. He excused himself to go talk to Ginny and Pansy who had already taken their seats at the table.
"I don't know how," Draco said quietly, more to himself than anything else.
“Before he was your boss,” Harry continued, “Oliver was my friend. And Percy is only using Oliver until something better comes along. Wood deserves better than to be Percy’s backup plan, and he’ll be furious when he finds out, especially if they spend all this money on a house.”
“And, what does that have to do with us?” Harry asked.
“People can surprise you,” Draco’s mouth twitched up into a small smile. “At any rate, they were talking about Percy and mentioned that
“It’s just dinner at The Burrow and an engagement party!” Harry said.
Harry is furious. He tried, for the second time in his life, to use an Unforgivable Curse, something he (has so far) only attempted when trying to avenge the death of a loved one.  But in his anger, he focuses on Snape. He doesn’t blame Draco for any of it. By being forced to watch the events on the tower frozen, Harry was able to see the entire sequence without interfering. His lack of interruption was key to allowing him to find out that Draco Malfoy wasn’t who he thought he was. This paragraph shows that Harry has it in his heart to forgive Draco, eventually. The only thing he dislikes about Draco now is the Dark Arts bit.
“It’s silly, honestly. I’m almost embarrassed to say.” Hermione stepped out of Harry’s embrace and blushed. “I just, marriage is quite the step.  And I guess I just got myself in a tizzy over it.”
At their apparition lesson, Harry abandons Ron and Hermione in favor of standing directly behind Malfoy. He’s also unable to focus on the hoop he’s supposed to be apparating into because
“You called me Draco.”
“Look,” Draco continued. “I don’t know what Percy explained. But if anybody knows about Cormac it’s me. We were involved for a while, until I showed up at his house a month ago and Percy was there. They were discussing how a relationship between the two of them would be advantageous. And so Cormac left me because dating a Weasley was better for the McLaggen brand.  Percy is just waiting for the right moment to take their relationship public, he wants to make sure that it’s risk free so he’s using you as a backup.”
******************
Sure, Harry had his bisexual awakening when he realized that his admiration for Cedric was less about appreciation of his magical prowess and more about finding him incredibly attractive.  But he hadn’t really considered Draco as an option.  Draco was a co-worker who had become his best friend as Ron and Hermione grew closer as husband and wife, because he understood what it was like to have the monumental pressure of high expectations placed on you at all times.  Draco was often there for him when Ginny was out training for the Harpies. And it was Draco that convinced Harry to drop out of the Auror Academy and become the DADA Professor at Hogwarts instead.  Could he really have been oblivious this whole time?
Ginny was over constantly, and this high energy muggle music was always playing, and Draco, drunk on wine, spit out his accusation to Pansy. Pansy had laughed, winked, and gone back into her room leaving Draco with his wine and his thoughts.
“Draco, it’s fine, I get what-”
Ten minutes later, Harry dropped into a dive and ended the game before the other team was even able to make any attempts at scoring a goal. Harry was feeling better after being in the air, so he figured keeping Cormac from doing anything useful in the game would be a good way to thank Draco for letting him play.
“What are you doing in Muggle London?” Harry asked incredulously. He fumbled for his wallet, trying to find another bank card to try.
The waiter subtly cleared his throat as he placed the check on the table, and they were brought back to reality. The spell was broken. Draco’s eyes widened. He hastily fished a note out of his pocket and mumbled a quick thank you to Harry for the sweater before sprinting out the door.

“At best, they fall in love and then we can take credit for it and we’ll get their approval and we can move on from these godforsaken jobs with their highest recommendation,” Draco tapped his fingers on Harry’s desk. “At worst, they’re distracted for a little while and I can at least take a nap or go on a date with my boyfriend. Please.”
Hermione shuffled over and gently put Harry’s glasses on his face. The room came into focus. The room was brightly illuminated and made his eyes water. There was a distinct sterile smell, as though everything had recently been scrubbed with a particularly potent cleaning potion.
“I thought I heard your voice, Harry! Where were you last night?” Ron came around the corner and sat down on the floor leaning against Hermione’s legs.
“Erm, well,” Harry started. He hadn’t realized how difficult it was going to be to admit to McGonagall that he didn’t want to be an auror. She was the first one to really believe in him and had even stood up to Umbridge on his account when it came to the OWLS needed to progress on the auror path. “I’m just not sure being an auror is right for me anymore.  Feels like maybe I’ve spent enough time hunting down bad guys.” Harry managed to get out after his awkward silence.
“Right, of course. You’re very used to the Gryffindor approach of rushing in and asking questions later.  Luckily for us both, this is a situation that needs a lighter hand which I just so happen to have.” Draco handed Potter another beer and continued, “I think you were on the right path with getting them stuck in the lift. But perhaps, they would benefit from a different set of circumstances.”
“Do we have anything stronger than butterbeer?” Harry asked as he sprawled across their couch and covered his head with a pillow. “I have had the most ridiculous day ever, and I would like to be very smashed.”
“Oh, there you are, Harry!” Draco called from the empty living room. He was chatting amicably with the estate agent. “This home is beautiful, so much natural light!”
“I’m not normally good with words. If everyone didn’t already know, Hermione was the one who wrote a lot of my essays. But I worked really hard on this and the words are completely my own. Hermione, I love you with all of my heart.  I had no idea that when I saved the annoying, bushy-haired, bookworm from a mountain troll on Halloween that she was going to end up being the love of my life. You put up with me for years, and I’m glad that you saw something in the ginger kid with dirt on his nose.  It just goes to show that first impressions aren’t everything.”
“Finally home, mate?” Ron asked, poking his head around the corner of the parlor.
“Try talking to Harry,” Ginny added, patting what she assumed was Draco’s ankle. “I know you don’t get along, but he knows Oliver and my brother so he could offer some help. It’d probably be good for him, honestly. You know, he spends all his time with Ron and Hermione, which must be dreadfully heterosexual.
“Can’t say that I had thought of a specific place.” Harry finally answered. “Anywhere you want to go?”
A few hours later, Harry walked through the door of Grimmauld Place, hung up his cloak, and toed off his shoes.  This truly had felt like the longest day, even with the interjection of Malfoy. It was somewhat weird, but also...welcome. It broke up the monotony of his usual work day.
“I’m engaged,” Harry finally spit out. “To a lady.”
“Yeah, yeah. Take your money and quit your bragging.” Pansy replied.
“Uh...yes.” Harry and Draco answered in unison. Draco snuck a glance over in Harry’s direction and Harry shrugged.
“I know you can’t talk about work, but surely you saw him even if it was just in the hallway or the lifts.”
“Is this a moon thing?” Harry asked.
Justin let Draco into the flat when he knocked, just nodded a hello and shuffled back to the sofa where he was watching some late night show that Draco understood was funny but never got the jokes even the few times Neil had explained them to him.
Sarah stood up and looked at Jude, who hauled himself to sit back on the sofa. “I guess I could go for a cuppa.”
“I feel I ought to warn you, Evan’s as straight as they come.”
She and Hermione disappeared upstairs for some clean clothes while Ron and Harry and George all helped clear the table. Mrs. Weasley turned up the radio and sang along to
Draco leaned back on his heels and stared at the near sparkling porcelain. “I just hear that laughter. Sometimes I think I hear it while I’m awake, and it’s worse when I’m--” He turned then and looked at Harry. “You’re leaving tomorrow.”
Draco put his hand over Harry’s. “I missed you too. Can’t seem to stay away for very long, can I?” He looked down the aisle at nothing. “I haven’t much time, he’ll be back soon. How do you feel about crepes for breakfast? I’ve missed them almost as much as you.”
If you want to consider the epilogue as canon, though I definitely don’t blame you if you want to ignore it, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy don’t fight when they interact. Instead, they nod at each other in understanding, and Harry encourages his youngest son to not be afraid of being sorted into Slytherin house. He references Snape in that moment, but it could have also been seeing Draco. It would be believable, after this exchange, that Harry no longer hates Draco and that Draco feels similarly.
Harry had been moping on the couch at Grimmauld Place all week.  All of Hermione and Ron’s attempts to get him to move, go out, do
