How could he have been so stupid as to think it was a love potion? And to confront Malfoy about it of all things. Mortifying. He raked his hand through his hair, tugging on it, wishing for the fifth time that day that he had a Time Turner. Not that it would do anything about his throbbing cock, but it would do something about his severely damaged pride.
He knelt in front of Draco. The toy persisted inside him, pushing at all the right angles, buzzing in infuriating rhythms and still slightly stretching.
Draco looked like he was going to make a witty retort when they heard a spine chilling scream from the house.
He watched in horror as Malfoy plucked his wand out from between his fingers. Harry didn’t even try to resist, he didn’t understand why, he just let Malfoy take his wand. It was looking back at moments like this that Harry felt the most infuriated, why did he let him take it? He could have cast a thousand spells at him from the chair to where he was standing, so why didn’t he?
Draco spelled him across a clean pair of socks and slid them over his feet. Harry shuddered at the soft cotton.
He shook his head at himself at his sheer stupidity. This job was everything to him. Usually he was the epitome of good professional behaviour. Malfoy just irked something in him. Something far below the surface, that made him forget who he was, that he was in fact an adult, and would be facing something much worse than detention if he got caught pounding the shit out of Malfoy during office hours.
Harry must have let something slip on his face. He had no idea what gave him away, but Malfoy knew. An expression of disbelief gave way to one of pure amusement.
Harry’s cock twitched at the sight of him. He’d thought the obsession couldn’t get worse. He was wrong. Now the sight of Malfoy brought memories of his scent, his touch, his fingernails on his skin. Fuck.
Harry woke up at 2pm with a pounding head. He spent the next three hours cursing himself. Had he really made a pass at his assistant? Who happened to be his childhood nemesis? A man. When no one other that Ginny, Hermione and Ron knew about his preferences. He groaned. How could he have been so stupid?
“Careful,” Draco said, “can’t have them saying I killed the Minister of Magic. I’m on eggshells as it is.”
How could Malfoy have no qualms about this? Not even the slightest inkling of guilt. An easy smirk and a look over his shoulder.
Harry shuddered and took a few gulps of water from the glass on his nightstand. He stared at the scarlet bed hangings and concentrated on the gold trim. He counted the strands of thread he could see. One, two, three, four. He forced the image of Malfoy out of his head with golden fibres. He looked in between his legs and gritted his teeth at the sight of his sheets tenting in front of him.
He took Harry’s cock back in his mouth, sucked and bobbed his head till Harry was flying towards the edge again, 100mph, he groaned as he hit it again, that invisible wall. He twisted and moaned, desperate, but completely unable. Draco pulled back and let him catch his breath before doing it again, and again, till Harry was nearly screaming the place down in frustration.
“Poor thing,” he cooed in his ear as pumped his cock, then moved down him and slid his lips down his cock.
It was pitch black. He had no idea how long Draco had let him sleep for. He sat bolt upright and moved over to Draco.
He gasped as Draco spread a cold lotion on the soles of his feet, rubbing it in slow circles. Harry’s cock was beginning to twitch. He stared at the ceiling and thought of Umbridge.
He walked around the corner, enjoying the warm tiles against the soles of his feet. Draco grinned at him from where he was lying in the bath, already covered in bubbles.
He never thought he could be so happy to see such a depressing looking house. The black paint was peeling from the door, the windows were blacked out and mostly covered in cobwebs from the outside. Still, Harry felt butterflies in his stomach as he reached out for the rusted metal handle and pushed the door open.
Harry jolted from his dream. Nightmare. He definitely wasn’t hard. In the dream he’d been dancing with Malfoy and Malfoy kept pulling him closer and chuckling in his ear.
Draco moaned in his ear. Long and anguished. The most wonderful thing Harry had ever heard. Draco grabbed Harry’s ear lobe between his ear and pulled. Harry jumped. Every touch from Draco was making him shake, making his cock throb. He’d been wanting this for too long. Sat fantasising at his desk about it for far too many hours. Harry wriggled under Draco’s rocking, desperate to move but far too terrified to do so. Draco’s arse felt hard in his hands.
Draco pushed harder on the back of his head, his neck. Harry couldn’t breathe. He didn’t care. He was on the edge. It was inexplicable, Draco hadn’t even touched him properly yet. He knew when he did he was gonna last a second before he exploded. He gagged. Draco pushed harder.
“Oh, come on now.” McGonagall rolled her eyes at them. “Mr Malfoy, you lead. It’s just dancing, honestly.”
“I can!” They stepped out on the tenth floor and Harry determinedly put one foot in front of the other on the white stripe that ran down the middle of the corridor.
“Wait.” He dragged his eyes up and down him, biting his lips. “Fuck me boy wonder you don’t disappoint.”
Hermione yawned as they sat down on the floor of the girl’s bathroom with their cauldron. Harry was wide awake, happy occupy the hours between midnight and 6am with something other than explicit dreams about Malfoy. He didn’t even know he knew the things he was dreaming about. How the ideas of all the different ways men could fuck had made it into his brain he had no idea. He assumed it was the potion.
He needed to get home before he made even more of an idiot of himself. Draco went out to the lobby to make the phone call.
Harry relented, pulling his fingers back and slowly pushing himself back inside Draco. Draco groaned, low and long.
For a second, on his hands and knees, Harry felt relief from the constant desire that had been wracking his body for what felt like forever. He flopped over onto his back, staring at the bricks that had closed behind Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. His apparent lover. He closed his eyes, revelling in the buzz, the warmth, that flooded him. Drowning out the sensible thoughts that were demanding to know what the hell he thought he was doing.
“Lets show them all how hard your prick is for me, shall we?” Potter shoved down Draco’s trousers and boxers, letting Draco’s hard cock bob free in the air in front of the audience that were now unashamedly watching. Draco’s cheeks burnt. It wasn’t them watching him, god knows he’d done that enough times before. He enjoyed it. It was that Potter was the one standing behind him this time.
Now Malfoy was pissed, he knew that voice well. Malfoy didn’t shout, he just spoke in a certain voice that told Harry he should be very careful.
“Lie on your side. I knew you wouldn’t prepare yourself properly, but I really wanted to watch for a bit...so...”
Every time he took him higher, quicker and Harry was sure it was getting more intense. When Harry was nearing breaking point Draco stopped and sat back aside Harry’s lap. He leant forward and whispered in Harry’s ear.
“Harry? Harry! Are you okay?” Hermione’s voice. Harry froze. Stark naked in his bed with his lover laid next to him. “I brought you some breakfast, some painkillers and a cold press for you head. I always find that helps when I have migraines.”
“I’m ready. I swear I’m ready,” Harry babbled, wanting nothing more at that moment than for Draco to push his dick inside him. He was sure he could take it. The toy felt divine.
Harry sighed, he was cold, and miserable. Getting fired didn’t seem that bad right now. He muttered under his breath, the tent glowed and shimmered, shivered, and the water ran back out the tent.
“Gosh, Potter, you’re in such a bad mood today. You should have taken me up on that offer earlier...you seem stressed.”
Harry would have been concerned about putting Ron in danger but they were fairly sure that none of the Death Eaters, or anyone who wasn’t in the Order for that matter, had any idea about their hideout or it’s whereabouts.
“It’s okay,” Draco said. “I’ve done it before. I’ve educated him fully on safe sex.” Draco lazily did up his shirt.
Potter leant on the cage from the other side. He had an intimidating bulge in his jeans. He didn’t speak. He just gave Draco a sly smile and knocked on the bars.
Harry yelped as Draco pulled the toy from inside him and dropped it on the bed. He shuddered in anticipation. Was Draco finally going to do this, or was it just another tease? Another attempt to push him ever closer to the brink of madness.
“It sounds like a trashy romance novel.” She brought the cauldron back over and knelt down next to him on the floor. “We seriously need to find a better place to do this, Harry, it’s murder on my tights.”
He snuck down the corridors, dodging around the students heading down to dinner in their throngs, keeping his head down, trying not to attract attention. One of the many problems of being Harry Potter.
“You’re not seriously considering ingesting that?” She whipped the cauldron from under his nose and took it to a toilet cubicle. It dropped into the water with stomach turning
He’d told Hermione of his fears, but what could she do? Nothing more than he could. There were no clues to be found, no perfect spell or potion lurking in the back of the restricted section. She told him to go to Dumbledore. Dumbledore just told him to be patient, that everything was under control. Wars were not won overnight.
Draco gave Harry an unreadable look, not containing its usual malice, but not thankful either. Harry didn’t expect it to be.
Before Harry could respond Draco had slipped away from him and out the door, leaving him cold and damp against the cold damp wall. His head was still spinning. He started to count to 120.
Harry smiled at the familiar phrase. God, but what would Remus think of this new development? He shuddered.
Potter ran his fingers across Draco’s lips and Draco opened them, sliding his lips down Potter’s finger. Potter’s lips twitched into a smile.
“I...” he gritted his teeth and put on his best sick voice. “I feel awful, I think I’m getting a migraine.”
“Potter,” Draco whimpered. “Potter yes. Please. Fuck me hard. I don’t want to be able to sit down for a week. Please. I need.”
Draco stroked his own cock fast, crying out as he got himself closer. Harry groaned as Draco’s arse tensed around his cock, and watched, entranced, as Draco reached his orgasm, his mouth dropping open and his eyelashes fluttering. He came hard on Harry’s chest and Harry was pulled over the edge with him. Draco slammed himself down on Harry’s cock hard and Harry cried out.
“I don’t know about you, Potter,” Malfoy whispered in his ear. “But I rather liked that. What about you?”
“Not everyone pays as much attention to us, Granger. Well, maybe to the golden boy. But certainly not me.”
“A rolling pin?! Potter are you trying to insult me. This is real bamboo.” He started tapping it on pressure points on Harry’s back.
His stomach turned. His heart hummed happily at the feel of Draco’s head on his chest. He kissed Draco’s soft hair. Draco squeezed him back and kissed his chest.
“You always seem so surprised Potter, that I can make you feel such things...do you deny it to yourself that it feels this good after?”
Harry was speechless. He had no idea what was going on. Draco continued to rub his feet with his deadpan expression. He cleaned and flied his toe nails meticulously, pretending that he didn’t noticed at all that Harry jumped half a foot in the air whenever he touched the soles of his feet.
Thankfully, Major already seemed to have thought of a comprehensive solution to the problem, and just wanted to run it by Harry before he went ahead. Harry gave his assent.
“I brought you some clothes, before I came to fetch you. This wardrobe is yours.” He indicated the right one. He plucked out a green shirt and black trousers and hung them up for him.
Malfoy just gave him a small smile. Harry sighed and started to wipe the dust off his face, trying not to get it in his eyes. Trying not to study Draco’s face, it had been so long since he’d looked at him properly...he silently inspected for any scars, any change...there was none. Just Draco’s angular and sharp features with his piercing silvery eyes...god he wanted to kiss him.
God what had Malfoy done to him? He should not be thinking like this. He shouldn’t even be letting him sit there without his cuffs on.
Harry was shaking underneath him already, his body remembered Draco, welcomed the intrusion of his long fingers.
He took Harry’s chin and tilted it towards him. He took his bottom lip inbetween his teeth and pulled. Harry was embarrassed by quite how quickly his cock hardened again. Draco stroked their cocks together under the water, kissing Harry slowly. He spun Harry round so Draco sat astride his lap instead.
It was just impossible to concentrate on dancing and retorting to Malfoy’s constant provocations at the same time. Harry opted for silence and getting his steps right. He managed eight bars before Malfoy put him off again.
He dropped his dressing gown on the floor and slid under the water. He sighed out loud, wondering if life ever was going to stop throwing ridiculous obstacles in his way. Mind you, he supposed once he used to view Draco Malfoy as a ridiculous obstacle. It took him a good ten minutes to defrost in the almost scalding hot water. He toyed with the idea of going downstairs and knocking on Draco’s door. He knew which one it was, but Draco was surely asleep, and wouldn’t appreciate being woken up at the crack of dawn by his delusional boss.
Harry finished his whiskey and wondered if his attempts to ask Draco on a date had fallen on oblivious ears. He couldn’t decide which he’d rather. He’d embarrassed himself, he was sure, but if it led to anything, he’d take happily take the embarrassment. He didn’t know what he was thinking of. Draco hated him. Or he used to, now it was probably a mild dislike. A bitterness that he considered himself in Harry’s debt no matter what Harry tried to stay. Either way, he had no idea if he was straight or gay, had a partner, anything. Draco was completely private. And why on earth would be interested in him of all people?
“Draco... Oh god...” It felt like the first time, all over again, as Draco slowly pushed, till he was balls deep inside him.
Harry swore under his breath as he heard Malfoy’s voice, that really was the last thing he want to hear right now. As he stepped closer saw that despite the person being dressed essentially in rags and covered in dust it was definitely Malfoy. He could just about see a few strands of platinum hair glinting at him through the dust.
Just fucking. Just fucking. Just fucking. He repeated it to himself like mantra every time his brain started saying “but it’s Malfoy” at him for the rest of the day. It didn’t mean anything. They could get it out of their systems, it would run its course, no one would give away their secrets, no harm would come of it. Harry was fairly sure it was his dick doing the talking, with the calm voice that said as long as it got what it wanted, and Malfoy was definitely what it wanted.
“Fuck!” Harry grabbed Draco’s arms and pushed himself up harder on Draco’s cock, again and again, driving himself higher than he’d ever been before. He cried out one last time then flopped back onto the bed.
Harry got into the taxi and closed his eyes. The world span pleasantly, and he wished he had the nerve to ask Draco out. Properly this time. Without interruption. This was his chance. No interruption in here. Draco climbed in the other side and did up his seat belt.
Draco was trying to catch his eye but Harry refused, determined not to give him the satisfaction, at least for a little while. As he wiped off the last of the dust from his cheek Draco tilted his head, placing several small kisses down his wrist, looking up at Harry with a glint in his eye before nipping down slightly on his skin with his teeth, smirking at him.
He pulled on his dressing gown, feeling rather like crawling up into a ball under his duvet and pretending the whole thing never happened, but he doubted that was going to happen. He walked over to the window, looking out at the quiet London street. It was a clear night and he could see the almost full moon sitting full above the houses. It seemed strange that Death Eaters were planning an attack here, that danger was so imminent, when it was so peaceful outside.
It was the only explanation for the way he seemed to play on his emotions so well. God, he hated him, it had been so long since he’d seen him that he’d happily pushed all thought of him from his mind, buried it deep away inside him. He knew his body was missing him, yearning for him, but he refused to let himself think of him as he got himself off. Still sometimes just as came he swore he could smell the sweet sweat on his body like when they used to fuck, could almost hear him growling in his ear, feel his teeth on his neck, his perfectly manicured nails dragging down his side...
“Snow’s bloody nice,” Ron remarked, glancing out the window at the glittering white expanse covering the grounds.
Well, there we go! Harry may be starting to realize that his feelings about Draco are more complex then he first thought!
Harry looked around at his classmates, who were all staring at him as though he had just asked if they all fancied coming to jump off of the top of the Astronomy Tower with him. Oh Merlin. Had he somehow started speaking Parseltongue? That would explain their expressions, a mixture of horror and fascination. Just like in dueling club during second year.
“Chocolate frogs!” Harry said impatiently, panting as he carried Draco into the common room and dropped him onto a sofa near the fireplace.
recall correctly, I believe you frequently got smacked around on the Quidditch pitch, suffering many blows to the head, and therefore are not a reliable source for this so called ‘victory’.” Malfoy stood up, holding up a hand before Harry could argue back. “Just go sit at the kitchen table, Potter. I think there’s a pack of Exploding Snap cards around here somewhere.”
Draco scrapped as much snow as he could off of the benches, but his amount was meager compared to the armful that Potter gathered. Deciding to cut his losses, Draco nimbly hopped down, dodging past Potter and sprinting out into the middle of the pitch, the other boy close on his heels and pelting him with sloppy handfuls.
Draco frowned, and then looked down at his chest, face paling more than usual when he saw the colours there.
“Hey, you two, come carry my trunk!” She waved Crabbe and Goyle over, who were already holding their own luggage, but managed to drag Pansy’s large trunk along as well as the foursome exited the dorms.
“Finally! Oh, thank Godric,” Harry said, clapping Ron on the back in congratulations. “I’m so pleased for you both, really.”
“How about let’s all just be grateful that we’re all fine and move past this,” Harry suggested. “And next time I’ll tell you who I’m staying with.”
Malfoy’s face twitched, as though he very much wanted to sneer at Harry and then storm off. But instead he took Harry’s arm and pulled him towards the Slytherin table.
The Quidditch game was one of the most ruthless ones Harry had ever played, and that was including the match when dementors had shown up and tried to suck out his soul.
“Er, yes, I suppose it is,” Malfoy agreed awkwardly, extremely perplexed by Harry’s sudden delight. “Although I really wouldn’t recommend sending him a letter.”
Harry managed to guide them both over to the kitchen table, making them both place their wands in the center so that no one got twitchy.
Ron started humming aimlessly, brow furrowed in concentration as he tried to cram his helmet in on top of the rest of his gear. The sound itched at Harry until he couldn’t take it any longer.
“Poker might be fun,” Harry said overly enthusiastically, seeing the soppy glint in his friends’ eyes, knowing that if he didn’t keep them on topic, the sickening mushiness would begin again.
The other students’ gazes prickling against his skin and the air suddenly seemed stifling with anticipation, the spicy expensive scent of Malfoy still filling his lungs every time he took a breath. In a split second, Harry turned sharply on his heel and tore out of the potions classroom as quickly as he had come in, unable to stand being in the room for another moment, with everyone’s eyes waiting for him to say something – anything – about what he thought about it all, when he himself didn’t even know what he thought.
Ron came up beside him, kneeling to help do up the chest’s straps. “Hey, Harry, are you alright? You seemed kind of in your head through practice.”
He sputtered, freezing clumps sliding damply down his face and dripping onto his scarf. Potter’s peals of laughter broke the sacred veil that had seemed to be coating the world along with the snow, as he doubled over with glee.
“Actually, just a set of dress robes for me,” Harry broke in. “My everyday ones from last year still fit just fine.”
“You’ll be fine, mate,” Harry said encouragingly, swallowing the last bit of his toast and brushing the crumbs off of his crimson sheets.
“That’s fair,” Harry acknowledged, pushing through the doors. “You don’t have to sit with us if you don’t want to.”
The entrance grated open and the thrum of a popular Weird Sisters song spilled out into the hallway. Draco grimaced, head already aching. He grabbed Potter’s hand, the scrape of his Quidditch-calloused skin almost familiar now.
“Rematch to decide second?” Malfoy suggested in a casually deceptive tone, hand already reaching towards his wand.
“Yes, it does,” Harry said, thinking of the old Malfoy and how the very notion of going out of his way for another creature’s happiness, especially one which he would have considered vastly inferior to himself, would have made him laugh in disbelief. And now he was out in the freezing cold, waiting for a house elf to pick out his Christmas tree, just because it would make him happy.
Flicking the light off, he went downstairs, where O’Leary was practically bouncing with excitement, still wearing his knit beanie. In steady contrast, Draco was slowly knotting a slate grey scarf around his neck, carefully examining his appearance in the foyer mirror.
“Oh, I don’t know, how about you became impossibly irritating and I was still the evil git you always knew me to be?” Draco said almost sarcastically, rushing so quickly towards the door that he was nearly running. “I think we’ll be able to come up with something. You know, the realistic-ness of coming up with it in the moment?”
Harry gulped. Apparently breakfast with the Slytherins was going to be as terrifying as he had feared.
Harry stewed over the fight while he ate his dinner, glaring angrily at Malfoy’s empty seat. Calling Harry overdramatic when he was the one who had stormed off! The nerve.
“Hold on one sec, before we get all competitive, umm, can I borrow your hat and gloves again?” He blushed, wishing he had taken up Mrs. Weasley on her offer to knit him some winter clothes last Christmas.
Summoning up all the Gryffindor courage he had, Harry opened his eyes, bracing himself for the vicious tirade he was certainly was about to be hurled at him.
Harry honestly would have preferred that option, standing there staring at Malfoy who was somehow, impossibly, the owner of the room he was renting.
“Ron, Hermione, look who’s here!” Potter said loudly, dragging his friends’ attention away from each other and onto their guests.
“Nothing,” Draco said innocently, immediately contradicting himself when he began to trail soft kisses along Harry’s jawline, finally pressing his lips directly against Harry’s. Harry was too stunned to react at first, but slowly let himself get swept away by the kiss, clutching the lapels of Draco’s robes.
“I want to find her a copy of a certain play by a fellow called William Shakespeare,” Harry said, slipping carefully around a shelf to avoid knocking any of the books off, trying to see if there was any sort of apparent organizational system.
“Slytherins are strategic, but we’re not idiots,” he muttered, before grabbing the front of Potter’s robes and tugging him back against him into a kiss that was a lot more desperate than he liked to admit.
competition,” Harry said, joining him. “It’s just supposed to be fun and get you in the holiday spirit.”
“Not well, Harry,” she snapped, turning towards him, her face pale. “I don’t know why I was so foolish as to agree to this.”
“Merlin, I’m so sorry about that,” Malfoy said genuinely, shaking his head in confusion as he stared up at where the plant used to be. “Breakfast?”
Harry took off his scarf and knotted it around Draco’s neck, before taking his hand again as they happily trudged back up through the snow to the castle, voices dampened by the velvety night air.
As the line slowly crept forward, Harry began to examine the menu chalked across a blackboard in soft greens and reds. The people walking away with their orders had lattes that smelled of gingerbread and hot chocolate with snowflakes sprinkles dotting the whipped cream. It was all wonderfully festive, reminding Harry of something Dumbledore would have done.
Malfoy finally finished the novel as the sun began to set, having been oddly silent for the last ten minutes.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, looking down at him, arms folded across his chest with unmistaken irritability. “I don’t know what you’re going on about, Potter, but I have no desire to hear about your flat. What I would like to know is why you let the fire burn down when you were sitting right next to it!”
She finally looked up from her book, frowning. “You said you two had been dating for awhile though, and it hasn’t come up?”
“Relax, Malfoy! Try to have fun,” Harry coaxed, spreading some of the icing onto the corners of the gingerbread.
“No, don’t, that’s not necessary!” Harry said hurriedly, moving past any lingering confusion he had to prevent Ron from stunning Malfoy. “Really, Ron, everything’s fine. He’s not holding me hostage.”
“Don’t walk away from me! I’m not finished!” Harry ran to catch up with Malfoy, falling into step with him and glaring crossly.
Not quite sure exactly what he was answering, Harry nodded imperceptibly, shifting an inch closer, noting the flecks of snow crystals caught in Malfoy’s hair. Once again, Malfoy’s icy hands pressed against the small of Harry’s back as his eyes fluttered closed.
Draco looked over at him. “Why don’t you live with them? They clearly think of you as a son and I’m sure would be more than happy to take you in. You could leave the bustle of London and come enjoy the peaceful anonymity.”
Harry grinned sheepishly, thinking of the butterflies he got whenever Malfoy held his hand. “I don’t know if I would call it that, but I’m glad you’re okay with it all.”
“Sure,” Draco agreed, voice peculiarly sharp as he shrugged into his robes, fisting his tie in his hand. If Harry didn’t know better, he almost would have thought he sounded bitter.
Careful to knock the caked snow off of his boots before entering, Harry stepped into the foyer, about to take off the no longer needed hat and gloves, when he locked eyes with Malfoy, who had just come down the stairs.
“What did you have in mind?” Harry asked slowly, eager for a distraction, which had the bonus of both taking his mind off of his life and getting another chance to beat Draco Malfoy.
He and Draco were placed on opposite teams, with Harry playing with Ron and Bill and Draco playing with Ginny and George. With such small teams, each one only had two Chasers and one Keeper, the Quaffle being flung viciously across the large field in back of the Burrow.
“Mmhm.” Draco acknowledged, head still bent over his textbook as he desperately stared at the seemingly nonsensical words coating it.
At first, Harry tried to keep a straight face, he really did. But once he stepped through the entrance, he couldn’t help himself any longer. He burst out laughing.
“Well, I guess we’ll see you back at the castle,” Ron said finally, glancing down at Hermione for confirmation that they actually were intentionally splitting off on their own for a date.
Draco heaved a sigh, abandoning the Transfiguration textbook he had been trying to read. “Yes, Pansy, because I am not planning on going to it myself! So it would be a bit odd for Harry to attend a
Harry could see that Malfoy was shivering, jaw set stoically despite the obvious discomfort he was in. “You could have come in with me, you know.”
“Well, I suppose that is a comfort,” Harry said, understanding that Malfoy would prefer not to linger on his confession and going along with his attempt to change the subject. “Although I will wear you down someday and get you to at least have an eggnog.”
Ron’s eyes were wide as he hurriedly swallowed his mouthful of toast. “Mate, I think you’re the one who’s not feeling too well, sticking up for that git and bloody well saving him from a convenient death yesterday. Really, Harry, I don’t know what’s gotten into you.”
After they settled down from the initial surprise of the pyrotechnics, Harry and Draco watched in wonder as the house elf continued to set them off, until the living room was filled with the distinct tang of magical smoke. They then proceeded to have breakfast, before cleaning up the living room and stowing away their presents so that they could leave the house tidy before going to the Weasleys’.
Mollified, the Ravenclaw stammered something unintelligible and dashed back to his friends, who had all been watching him with undisguised interest.
“They seem to think so,” Harry said, burying his face in his hands. What in Godric’s name was he supposed to do now?
“Going all Parseltongue on me Potter? Godric Gryffindor would be ashamed. And not just of your awful dancing. Step, Potter, step, step, turn, now step, step, other way... God what did they teach you at muggle primary school?”
Harry and Draco were quite for a moment. The house was still in apparent darkness and silence, but Harry didn’t believe the charade.
Sexually, yes, he had consented, against most of his better judgement, but how could he help it when it felt so good? Mentally, no, he had never, ever, agreed to what Malfoy had done to his mind. It wasn’t healthy to desire someone so and hate them in equal amounts, it wasn’t healthy to hate yourself for it after, to feel your whole body turn on you and everything you used to believe in.
“I never disagreed with you,” Draco said. “I just chose to ignore you...ah fuck.” He cursed as he stepped too heavily on his ankle.
Harry lay face down in the bedsheets, trying not to writhe against his mattress. It felt like before. When he was convinced Draco had drugged him. It had been three days. Harry couldn’t cope. He screwed his hands up in the sheets. It was always Draco that found him. How the hell was he supposed to propose a meeting and beg for forgiveness. It wasn’t like he could just send him on owl. He wondered what extra lessons the Slytherins got that made them all so savvy to sending secret messages like the one Draco had sent him before. He wouldn’t have the slightest idea where to start.
There was a tiny lock of Draco’s hair that curled, just behind his left ear. The rest was poker straight, regulation Malfoy platinum and always in place. Harry noticed it when Draco was leaning his right ear on the telephone, propped up by his elbow, on the phone to what appeared to be a very tedious employee of the ministry.
Harry pulled back and wished he hadn’t, Draco’s lust filled stare destroyed any resolve he had left to resist.
Malfoy grabbed the back of his head, pulling him into a kiss. Harry jerked his head down, he hated it when he kissed him, the array of emotions and hormones it sent coursing through him made him feel like a traitor.
Surely it was not normal to be attracted to someone who sulked this much. It reminded him of his main objective.
“Like that do we? Pervert. I could serve you up to Voldemort like this. The boy who lived with his dick out, gagging for a Malfoy.”
He gasped his breath back and looked up at Draco. Draco was panting, but somehow still grinning above him, as he finally came to a stop and collapsed on top of him.
“God I could get used to this in the mornings,” Draco sighed, running his hands over Harry’s back, sending shivers down Harry’s spine.
“Saint fucking Potter,” he sighed wistfully. He trailed off, then moved forward, straddling Harry’s lap in the chair.
For a horrible moment Harry thought he’d splinched him in his haste to get away. He looked over at Draco had thankfully found him in one piece.
Harry took his own clothes off and put them in a pile on the now clean floor. He walked under the hot water and wrapped his arms around Draco’s frail frame.
He was expecting Potter’s eyes to slide right off him, dismiss him, maybe blush, and never mention it again. Especially not at work. Potter didn’t stare at him at work. He avoided his eyes, gave him an unconvincing half smile and went about his business. They worked on different floors. Draco being far too lowly to be up on the same floor as the Aurors. To be honest, he was surprised he was even allowed in the building.
“Please what?” Potter’s voice was low and full of lust. Draco could feel his hard cock against his thigh.
“Uhuh,” Harry agreed, jumping a fraction as Draco’s fingertips go a little too close to his arse. Draco didn’t seem to notice and carried on massaging.
Harry levitated Draco off the floor, trying not to look at the sheer amount of his blood on the floor. He took him into what used to be a dining room that was now Mrs Weasley’s area for patching them up.
“I’m sorry Ron, would you like us to lock him back in the basement like a real prisoner?” Hermione snapped at him.
“Well, I stand corrected.” Harry muttered and pulled the camera out. He lay on his belly next to Draco and they peered through the gap in the hedge.
“No! This is a love potion Hermione, there is nothing to fancy about Malfoy. I hate him! It just happened over night, like I’d been spiked.”
Harry cursed under his breath again, dripped some of the oil onto his fingers and pushed one inside Draco’s hot tight arse.
Harry groaned inwardly. He closed his eyes, wondering if he could manage to sleep all the way, but the noise of the carriage was deafening. Malfoy took another sip of his drink and turned a page of his book.
“Potter.” Draco laughed. “I’ve fucked half of Slytherin house and half the wizard population of London.”
“You wish, Potter. Come on. We’re starting to smell like this mop bucket. I’ll go first, so no one sees us, wait two minutes, then you meet me up there.”
“Draco,” Harry tried again, his cock already causing him to resort to desperate measures. He wrapped his arm round the blonde, looking up at him pleadingly. “Please, Draco, don’t leave me like this...I’ll do anything...”
By the time they got near to their stop, almost all of the train’s customers had got off. Harry had shifted onto the seat opposite. Draco hadn’t commented. He hadn’t said a word, except to ask Harry to move so he could go to the toilet, the entire journey. Harry was suspicious but fairly relieved, god knows the situation was bad enough without Malfoy’s needling.
“Apparently they’ve known for ages, Wormtail knew about it, from when Sirius and him used to be friends at school.”
Harry groaned. This would be the point. If this was all a joke and someone was going to come out with a camera, it would be now.
Harry could feel his cheeks burning as he pushed down, determined, Gryffindor stubbornness. He groaned as he felt Draco’s hips beneath him. Let his weight drop down.
Harry knew if he opened his eyes Draco’s crotch would be inches from his face. Draco rubbed up his neck, his thumbs circling and reducing his mind to mush.
“Yeah. Yeah, oh.” The buzz on that spot, and the way it slowly stretched him, the ever so slight burn, he squirmed.
Potter yanked his head back and whirled him around to face the crowd again. Draco dragged the stool back under himself for support.
Lucius just nodded and Harry watched from the floor as he levitated Ron in front of him and floated him out of the door with Bellatrix and Hermione behind him.
He closed his eyes as the sound of lunch bell rang in his ears, followed by the cacophonous sound of twenty text books being slammed shut.
Malfoy was straddling his lap before Harry could object. Harry barely had time to register his weight and roll his eyes at Malfoy obviously showing off for attention when his hand grabbed a fist full off hair and he kissed him.
Draco groaned above him, loud and long, and Harry shuddered. He had desperately missed that sound. Harry pushed his head forward, his throat contracted, objected, relented.
Draco grinned at him. Like a lion grinning at his dinner. He poured oil onto his hands and wrapped them both round Harry’s hard cock and slowly stroked him up and down, circling his fingers over the head as he reached the top.
“Fuck yeah. That’s...” he moaned again as Malfoy slid his lips back down. Drawing him oh so close, again and again, the present pushing, fucking him slowly, the sweetest pressure. Harry legs were beginning to shake, sheer need exhausting his body, when Malfoy stood back up.
They were too close now. That had been Harry’s fatal mistake. He was straddling Draco’s lap. Could feel Draco’s hard and willing cock against his leg. He wanted it inside him. Wanted to ride him to his hearts fucking content. Now he’d admitted it to himself back at the house the thought came more freely. Which was horrifying in itself after a good five years of denial.
Draco slid his forearm up, pressing it down over Harry’s throat. Harry’s survival instinct final kicked in, fear jolted through him and he struggled in Draco’s grip. He scrambled for his wand but it was nowhere to be found. He must have dropped it on the floor.
Harry desperately tried to find the words to tell him no, it was fine, to please put his hand back. But it was too late. The connection between Harry’s brain and speech seemed to be out of action. God knows how he ever got a girlfriend. A stunning girlfriend at that. He supposed he hadn’t had to do a great deal of work. She had more or less jumped into his arms.
“Your welcome. Catch you later, boy wonder.” Draco winked at him, turned and vanished through the moving bricks.
“Honestly. Never stretching.” Draco tutted again and moved his hands back down to Harry’s thighs and calves.
Harry tried to keep his expression neutral. He had no idea what Draco’s intentions were. Hell, he had no idea what his own intentions were.
“In your dreams.” He pulled out a book and started to read, happily sipping at his coffee like he spent every weekend relaxing on a muggle train.
Harry shuddered against at the thought.Then groaned as Malfoy came down his throat. He swallowed greedily, licking Draco’s cock clean.
Draco gave him such a familiar condescending look that Harry grinned. That was the Draco he remembered. Not the stone-faced polite assistant he shared an office with now.
“Patience darling.” Draco pulled Harry’s arms above his head and touched Harry’s wand. His hands stuck. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry felt hard wood push up his back and groaned again but his head fell into the coach this time, as Malfoy pushed it up his back.
Harry was straddled on Malfoy’s lap on window ledge in the astronomy Tower, snogging him within an inch of his life. They lost themselves, pushing their bodies harder together, reveling in the friction, the pressure. They’d never done it like this, out in the open, but Draco had tempted him up there saying it was a beautiful evening. It was a beautiful evening, a huge glowing moon hung in the clear dark sky. It was also bloody freezing. Harry didn’t care.
Harry was still surprised that Draco had stayed. Despite his sarcasm and foreboding he had turned up to work promptly on the first Monday morning, well presented, face blank of all sneering and insults. He always called Harry ‘Minister’, had a polite telephone voice and an unshakable mask that Harry actually found more frustrating that if Draco had been acting like his usual self.
Malfoy grabbed him and slammed him back up against the door. He whispered a spell under his breath and Harry felt rough rope tying tight around his wrists, pulling them together behind his back.
Harry whimpered as Draco stroked his prostate, teasingly light and gentle. Harry held his breath as Draco pulled out his fingers, still a little nervous, even after last night. He groaned at the feel if Draco’s hot cock pushing against his arse hole. He pushed back, gently at first, his mouth dropping open at the pleasure, the stretch, of feeling so full.
Draco sat down on a chair that definitely hadn’t been there a moment ago and kicked off his trousers and pants.
“We’re up here,” Harry called. “Two Death Eaters, that one and one paralysed here. We haven’t found anyone else.”
Harry’s mouth had gone positively dry. He pushed himself up on the couch and Draco walked back towards him.
Harry picked up the phone and tried to remember how to use it and not look like a twat in front of Draco.
“I want all of it.” Harry heard himself slur and cringed. Willing himself to sober up. He never wanted to forget this. Not ever.
Harry yanked his wrist back, terrified by the sensations such a small action had sent coursing through him. Jesus.
“Oh, Professor Slughorn was telling us about an extra credit project that he wants to do, we’re going to the library, do you want to come?” Hermione asked.
He pushed his slick fingers in between Harry’s legs before he had time to retort and Harry moaned loud, pushing himself back hard against Draco’s hand.
They walked into the large entrance hall, finding Lucius waiting for them at the bottom of the stairs.
“Malfoy! You can’t,” Harry hissed under his breath, quickly casting a silencing charm around the bed.
Time was ticking away, as the taxi sped them towards their block of flats. Time was running out. Harry said nothing. He checked his watch. It was 11pm.
“I think this all would have been easier if it was a bloody love potion he was slipping you.” She sighed and put her hands on her hips.
Harry took out his wand and went to put it to Draco’s arm but Draco yanked it back and pulled down his sleeve.
Draco did not look as well presented under the harsher lights of his office. Harry gave him a small smile.
“I’m not saying I trust you.” Harry thought he should probably say something to him, hoping to god it was something sensible and not the array of filthy thoughts that seemed to be flooding through his mind.
Harry couldn’t breathe. Draco rubbed something slick on Harry’s cock lifted himself up and then. Then Harry’s world as he knew it ended.
Harry was caught off guard and forgot the speech he had rehearsed to finally make Dumbledore take him seriously.
Draco flicked his wand at the door to the turret, it locked, and Harry felt wards spring up around them.
He warily stepped through the parted bricks into a seemingly empty room. He’d never seen it like this before. Bare brick walls, stripped back wooden floor, not even a chair. He checked his watch: 1202. The bricks clicked into life again and Harry turned to face them, slid his wand from his sleeve down into his hand.
“Oh.” He sighed. “Poor creatures. It’s alright,” Harry heard him cooing through the door at one of them. “Shhh.”
Harry watched in horror as Draco dropped to his knees in front of him and pulled out his cock. Harry squirmed and gasped at the cool air on his sensitive skin. Harry barely had time to register what Draco was about to do before he slid his lips down his cock.
He slapped his wand down on his arse and Harry cried out in surprise, he kept hitting him with it, in time with his hard thrusts.
Harry rested his head against Draco’s shoulder, unable to keep it up any longer. Draco’s moved his hand slowly over Harry’s cock and slid his thumb over the head.
“and...?” Hermione prompted, who had apparently now joined them at the bottom on the stairs, looking just as shocked as Harry did.
“What am I supposed to do with that?” Malfoy asked, shaking his wrists at him again, a noise Harry was starting to find particularly irritating.
Draco accio-ed a towel from the bathroom, one of the fluffy ones that had been there when Harry had moved in. Harry couldn’t help the slight moan that escaped his lips.
Harry stood himself up on shaky legs and walked back with Hermione, trying to ignore the sideways looks she was giving him, like he might drop down dead at any minute.
He told himself he was just going to talk to Malfoy, to see if he could convince him not to tell anyone about this, to somehow escape from this whole embarrassment unscathed.
Draco leant forward as he fucked him, touching their foreheads together. Harry stared back up into Draco’s grey eyes, unashamedly falling into them, headfirst. He hoped never to return.
Stressed. Harry rolled his eyes. He’s an Auror, course he’s fucking stressed. Yet, here he is, with the gift voucher Ron and Hermione brought him for his birthday, because they said he seemed stressed lately.
“Oh, don’t be worried about those two. I’m sure you know The Order have two of my father’s dear friends prisoner, we’ll arrange a trade. They might be a bit bruised and bloody...but...I’m sure they’ll have been in worse places. Like this place...” Draco looked round the room again in disgust. He was talking far more than normal, Harry could tell that he was excited, buzzing about this having actually worked. Harry found himself thinking - surprisingly logically - that this was probably the first thing his father had let him do since he failed to kill Dumbledore. It would make sense that he was elated that he had succeeded.
Harry felt his orgasm start to wash over him and gasped, staring up wide eyed at Draco as he started to come untouched.
Harry did not know how he’d got this drunk. Or got pulled into this game of spin the bottle. He just knew the world was fuzzy, and he didn’t seem to care. He was sitting in the Ravenclaw common room with only a vague notion of how he’d got there. Ron was on the other side of the room playing some sort of drinking game of wizard’s chest and roaring at the top of his lungs. Hermione was sitting next to Harry laughing her head off.
“Of course I do it’s just…he’s so distant. How am I supposed to trust him if I he won’t even see me?”
Harry sat back on his heels and Draco followed him, kneeling in front of him, stroking his fingers down his cheek.
Another knock at the door. Harry groaned. He was sat on the sofa in his pyjamas, watching a mindless action movie and thinking about ordering a pizza. More giants? He spelled the door unlocked.
“Mmm yesss Potter, look how well you can take this now.” He pushed in most of the way and Harry squeaked, fuller and stretched more than he ever had been with the toy.
He pushed Draco off him, much to his muffled objections, and got up to go to the bathroom. It was 7am, a little early to get up, but there was no way he was getting back in that bed with a naked Draco. Forget it.
Draco stroked his hard cock against the inside of Harry’s thigh and continued kissing his neck and stroking his cock.
Ron laughed and Hermione joined them at their other side after spending the class being spun around the room by Neville.
He lay down and wondered how the hell he’d got comfortable enough to sleep before. He closed his eyes. Malfoy turned off the lamp. Harry opened his eyes again and inwardly sighed. He wasn’t getting any more sleep tonight and he knew it. The groundsheet crinkled and rustled under him as he tossed and turned.
“Because you’re an arrogant, self-righteous, mudblood piece of shit, and it’s never. Going. To. Happen.”
Draco popped open the button of his chinos and Harry gulped. He kicked them off and walked back to Harry with a smug grin, he knew how good he looked.
He nearly shrieked, so sensitive from that bloody toy and Malfoy fucking him as hard as he always did. Draco laughed in his ear.
“Not all of us are rolling in money, Malfoy.” Harry tutted at him, hoping that Hermione bringing over their tea would move the conversation along and they could just forget he ever said anything.
The looked at each other in panic. Harry rolled off Draco and searched frantically through his sleeping bag for his phone. He found it and called Morgan but to his dismay it just rang and rang. He cursed.
Draco did and stared up at Potter as he came with a loud shout, his mouth open and his face turned up towards the heavens. Draco welcomed the warm liquid that fell on his face, seeming endless, until Potter finally gasped his breath back, let go of Draco’s hair and looked down on him with a smirk.
Harry grinned continuing to fuck him as hard as he could, Draco’s every cry and every contraction of his muscles sending him closer.
“Since when does Malfoy know how to dance?” Harry complained as they followed Hermione down the staircase.
“You don’t know?” Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ve fancied you since I started getting erections, Saint Potter,” Draco whispered in his ear.
Draco started to fuck him against the counter and Harry groaned, Draco was still so insistently kissing him, making him lose it far quicker than usual. He was whining into Draco’s kisses now, this felt better than anything they’d ever done before. It wasn’t fucked up, it wasn’t pain, it wasn’t toys, it wasn’t teasing, it was just pure sex. And he wasn’t pushing Draco from his mind anymore, wasn’t shutting him out, or bothering to feel like a traitor. He was embracing that it was Draco, gorgeous bastard that he was, fucking his brains out. And god, like this, as Draco was kissing him so desperately Harry realised Draco was completely right. The elation of finally letting go and admitting his feelings to himself was a rush and a relief that drove him even higher.
“What do you think Potter? You like it?”  Draco rocked back and forth on his cock and Harry swore he nearly blacked out.
“No, they’re being swapped, they won’t be harmed...much. They could be though, Potter, if I wanted them to be, so don’t fuck me around.”
“Fuck yes, Potter,” he gasped around Harry’s grip. “Fucking give it to me. Get those fucking fingers inside me.”
“If you’ve quite finished brooding Potter. Turn around and let me put some conditioner in your poor hair.”
The cold water quelled Harry’s erection and he let his head drop back down into the pillow. It was just a stupid dream. Sometimes he dreamed that he was naked flying around on winged desks in the Great Hall. It didn’t mean he wanted it to happen. Or that he was fantasising about it.
Every time Draco moaned Harry’s hips flicked forward of their own accord. Draco moaned. The cycle built until Harry was fucking Draco hard, drowning in the heat around his cock and Draco’s moans in his ear.
He looked up at Snape taking intently and refused to submit to her repeated attempts to catch his eye. He was incredibly glad for Snape’s insistence of silence in his classes. When the bell finally rang Harry faked a stomach upset and ran up to the dormitory, wondering if Hermione would ever look at him the same again.
A tear slid down Harry’s cheek. Hermione kept a tight hold on his hand. Ron stood tall next to him. His army waited beside him. How he had ever thought he could win this war on his own, Harry had no idea.
Hermione turned and gave them their breakfast. Malfoy coughed pointedly and Harry realised that there was no way he was going to be able to eat with the handcuffs on.
He still wasn’t used to how wanted Draco made him feel. Desired. He didn’t understand it, he knew plenty of girls had swooned at him cos he was ‘Harry Potter’. This was different.
“Aren’t you sick of seeing enough of me at work?” Draco’s expression was blank. Unreadable. It infuriated Harry beyond belief.
“I love you.” It was out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop it. To his great relief Draco didn’t so much as tense.
“Top off then let’s check you over. Malnourished, heavy bruising, that ribs cracked, and your collar bone... hang on... “ There was a sickening snap and Draco’s hand clenched round Harry’s. “That’s better! Let’s just check your back, okay, legs, yes...sprained ankle. Nothing a bit of rest won’t fix.
“Mr Potter, welcome to Tamsin’s Enchanted Therapy Garden. It is an honour to have you here.” She bowed her head.
“Please try and keep it discreet, Potter. God knows the hysteria that would break out if they found out how powerful you really are. Christ.” She sighed. “Okay. You’re relieved. Go home and get some rest.”
“You rarely let me sleep in your bed,” Harry reminded him, though he had no intention of stopping Draco get into bed with him.
“Oh.” She didn’t blush in the slightest. “Well, have you thought about the fact that you might just fancy him?”
“You will with me. Trust me.” Draco said, pushing himself up on the floor and sitting butt naked on Harry’s sofa. He beckoned to him. “Pick a movie.”
Draco picked his wand up again and smiled. Harry hadn’t felt this vulnerable in a long time. It made his cock throb even more.
Harry didn’t think he’d ever been less relaxed. Draco set every nerve on end, made his guard go straight up the second he saw him. Bracing himself for the insults, the glares. Or the seduction, as he got now, which he thought was a lot more terrifying.
“You’re in love with me...” Draco whispered in his ear, “and it’s tearing you apart inside hiding it from yourself.”
Of course. It was obvious now. These feelings for Malfoy were completely random , had come out of nowhere and were verging on blind obsession. He cursed himself for being so stupid and not having caught on earlier. Obviously Malfoy had slipped a love potion into his drink. There was no doubt about it now. He remembered the day Ron had accidentally taken one, he was delirious.
Their kiss became faster, more heated, till Harry was panting into Draco’s mouth as they frotted against each other. There was no other word for it. Draco pushed Harry down onto the floor and climbed fully on top of him and resumed the onslaught of Harry’s mouth.
“No one else?” Draco asked, though he was grinning and Harry stroked and sucked on his cock. He knew he answer.
Malfoy ignored him and proved to Harry that he most definitely could, by taking his cock in his mouth. Harry groaned, finding his will power to stop Draco none existent. He closed his eyes, enjoying the bliss for the moment, thinking his life would be much better if every morning started like this one.
Harry flushed, took it off quickly and threw it to the floor. He wasn’t embarrassed by how he looked, he knew he was in good shape. He was embarrassed that he was following Draco’s every command.
Harry’s breath hitched as Draco pushed something cold into his arse. It felt fairly small, but as Draco continued to pump his cock and bite on his neck it began to grow and swell inside him.
He glanced down at his pyjamas, wondering quite how many stains they had down them. Judging by the twitching of Draco’s lips he imagined there were several. In his panic Harry smelt the dinner Draco had brought with him before he saw the plates levitating behind his head. Stew. It smelt better than Mrs Weasley’s, and that was saying something.
“I assume we won’t be telling Ron about this,” Hermione said quietly as they walked up to the common room.
Harry smiled. He could get used to this. He could get really fucking used to this. Draco groaned as Harry fucked him with soapy fingers.
Draco rolled his eyes but dutifully slid into the window seat. Harry sat next to him and pointedly stretched his legs out into the aisle.
Harry shook as he turned slowly, trying to keep control of his body and not just grab his cock and wank himself off into oblivion.
“No. The only time I have a proper meal is if Hermione or Mrs Weasley cooks it for me. Hermione came to see me the other week and saw all I had was microwave meals. An owl turned up the next day with boxes and boxes of frozen meals she’d made.”
“Oh Harry...fuck...” Draco cried out as he came inside him. “Baby I love you too...you’re so beautiful...”
“I do. But they don’t blind me into making reverse love potions in the middle of the night and developing.”
His bliss was interrupted by the squeak of the shower door opening and the boys coming back from the bathroom.
“You will drink it. And then you’ll tell us the truth,” Harry said sternly. Malfoy just smirked at him and watched Harry picked up the potion and put it to his lips.
Potter ran his thumbs in between Draco’s arse cheeks and Draco groaned as he held them apart. He yelped as Potter buried his face in between them, licking and sucking at sensitive skin.
There was the ten minutes inevitable snoozing and swearing followed by the thud of feet on the floor boards as the Gryffindor boys finally surfaced.
God no. It was much easier to deal with his thoughts about Malfoy when there was no Malfoy there for him to have thoughts about. Repression and denial came much easier to him when the blond was strutting around reducing his mind to nonsense.
Draco slid two fingers inside Harry’s mouth, then three, sliding them to the back of his throat till Harry gagged. Draco stroked the back of his head.
“They’ve allocated you a flat in the Ministry Apartments. Fully furnished.” He handed him a key. “Flat 309.”
Draco was relentless, sucking and tonguing his balls until Harry was a blathering mess. His hips jerked back and forth and he pulled on his wrists, desperate for the soft wet incredible heat that was Draco’s mouth on his dick.
The spell released him and Draco pumped Harry’s cock hard. Harry screamed, the intensity of his orgasm took his breath and his whole body spasmed.
“What’s the point? I’ve told him a million times before and he doesn’t believe me. He must know there’s something going on. He’s not stupid.”
The bell rang and Draco dropped Harry’s hand, turned and walked out the room without a backward glance.
“Ron, what the hell is going on?” Harry demanded, looking between a sheepish looking Ron and an extremely pissed looking Malfoy.
“Promise me you’ll be careful? I don’t know what Malfoy’s up to lately, but he does seem... Darker. Somehow.”
Everything was going to be okay. He had just got to the tips of Harry’s fingers on the last arm when he stopped, stooped down and whispered in Harry’s ear.
Draco chose the moment Harry realised this to reach in between them and wrap his hand round his cock. Harry cried out loud.
He was sure he could keep a line between them in his head. The war. Malfoy. Hermione was right, what would Voldemort be thinking entrusting his plans to a 16 year old boy? And what could he be up to, that Dumbledore wouldn’t know about?
“Oh yeah, Potter, my good little cock slut, you take it. Like you’re gonna take it up your arse for me reeeal soon.”
Harry didn’t know if he could stand, let alone live up to Draco’s task, but he nodded anyway, determined to try. He stood up, lifting Draco with him.
Harry could have punched him in the face. He knew he only said it to get a rise out of Ron, but he knew that he was going to have to say something.
“You self-centred wanker. God, it's got to you, hasn’t it? Them telling you you’re the chosen one. The only one that can stop Voldemort? Do you really think you’re so important that it’s you he’d be worried about when taking on this castle full of experienced wizards? Potter, just how up your own arse have you become?”
“You keep that for later.” He winked at Harry, pulled up his trousers, kissed him on the lips and was gone.
“I’ll have to confront him. It’s the only way. I’ll make him tell me how he’s doing it, what he’s using. Then we can find out how to reverse it.”
“Ah that’s good. Yes, Potter, love your tight arse.” He slapped him on the thigh and Harry shuddered.
Draco did as he was told as Potter moved his hand from his eyes to his neck instead and start to squeeze.
“Yeah, yeah, fuck,” he groaned. Pushing his arse back against Potter’s deliciously long lubed up fingers.
“Look, I’m not entirely comfortable about this either, sweetheart, but you know what’s at stake here.”
“Well, I’m glad you managed to deliver our package safely, Draco. I’m sure you’ll keep him just as securely in your room?”
“Yeah, what you going to do? Tell Dumbledore? Doesn’t believe a word you say does he?” Malfoy sneered.
“Of course not.” Harry didn’t have to see Draco to know that he was rolling his eyes. “Too bloody powerful aren’t you boy wonder, you can see right through it without even trying. It’s sickening.”
“Yeah alright.” Draco sighed, kissed him again and pulled himself up and out of the bath. Harry followed him, dazed, already desperate to pull Draco back to him. Draco cast drying spells on them both and they pulled their clothes on in silence. Before Draco left Harry pulled him back and put his arms around him, holding him tight. Draco, to his surprise, didn’t object, but held him back, kissing him on the shoulder before pulling away.
It did feel better. It felt like every bit of tension he’d ever held in his back had been released. He didn’t want to tell Draco that though.
“What a lovely arse you have. I can’t wait to get better acquainted.” He sunk his teeth into Harry’s left cheek and slapped his other.
“He says it’s not fair that we’re given these tasks. That we’re just kids. He thinks Dumbledore…he thinks he’s using me. Not telling me everything.”
Harry let Draco take his weight and run his hand through his hair. Draco guided him back up and pulled him astride his lap. Harry rested his head on Draco shoulder and closed his eyes.
Harry slid out of the classroom before Ron and Hermione could miss him and doubled back into one of the alcoves, waiting for all the students to leave for lunch. He watched them look around, shrug, then carry on without him. He couldn’t lie to them. It would be far easier to avoid.
The hall was sparkling, his drink was sparkling, and Draco was somehow sparkling. Harry could have sworn it. He watched him under the chandelier, light from the candles bounced and twinkled off his platinum hair, his steel grey dress robes, as he glided from person to person.
She threw a brown liquid over Draco’s arm and Draco howled. She muttered a spell over his arm and the wound stopped spurting so enthusiastically.
“Surprisingly, she lost interest. Not that I really need one anymore anyway. They’re a status, children and carrying on the line sort of thing.”
Despite Harry’s instance that they were *never* doing it again, they spent most of their nights together in the days after that. They were a bit more sensible about leaving in the morning before anyone else woke up though.
“Of course I don’t.” Harry understood this at least, he’d had his fair share of people trying to ‘fix’ him.
“Malfoy...” Harry started again, trying to reason with him even a little, the feel of Malfoy’s rough hands on his cock weren’t really helping his ability to form sentences. “Can we talk about this?”
Malfoys hand was heavy on his hip, guiding him round the room and into every step for the next half an hour of the class. He’d been praying Malfoy would insist to switch partners, but he was apparently having far too much fun mocking Harry’s dancing.
Harry appreciated the amount of effort it must have taken for him not to make a face. He knew the Ministry had seized Malfoy Manor and all their possessions. He didn’t even know where Draco was living at the moment.
Harry knew Draco was right. He was tired, cold, his face still hurt where Draco had smacked him, and he felt like shit. He pulled out his sleeping bag and burrowed down in it. He rested his head on the pillow and was halfway through wondering how he was supposed to sleep on such hard ground with a rock jutting into his back when he passed out cold.
“You know…” Draco said, continuing to palm Harry’s cock through his boxers, “I don’t think I was far off.”
Harry had been hiding in this bathroom for longer than he cared to remember. He was sure she was still outside. Arms folded. Waiting. He could feel it.
“Are you going to miss me terribly, Potter?” Draco sighed dramatically as he walked over the closet and started to carefully fold some of his clothes into a bag he’d pulled out from under the bed.
Draco was pumping his own cock now, his eyes shut and his mouth open as he moved back and forth against Harry’s hand.
Draco felt Potter’s eyes on him across the club. It had been a good five years since he’d felt that stare. He definitely hadn’t expected to feel it here of all places, when he was zipped into skin-tight leather and currently leaning on the cast iron bars of one of the many cages that were bolted to the floor of the club.
He heard Potter kneel down in between his legs and looked determinedly down still. He didn’t want to give Potter the satisfaction of looking back, showing how nervous he was.
“You pathetic little brat. God, my only regret is your mother couldn’t have more children. Even a girl would have been less of a disappointment than you.”
“Let me look at you.” Potter ran hand through Draco’s hair almost fondly, then took a fistful and yanked his head back.
“Malfoy looks like shit,” Ron said. “Looks like whatever daddies asked him to do isn’t going so well.”
Draco reached down and slid open the iron bolt, his heart pounding in his chest. Potter pushed open the door, his face poker straight as he stepped inside the cage. There was plenty of room for them both in there, but Potter stepped straight up to him, pushing him back against the bars, his whole body firm against his. He grabbed Draco’s wrists and pulled them above his head, clicking his leather cuffs to the bars. Draco sighed out, aware of Potter’s size compared to his own. Shoulders that had widened as they’d ascended through the years, the muscles Potter had developed during his Auror training, held Draco hard against the bars. How easily Potter could throw him around a room was making Draco even harder.
“Does the Halfblood Prince not have any love potion antidotes scribbled in the margins?” she drawled.
Mrs Weasley was silent, but the appliances whirred into action again. She hadn’t said a word to him since they got here. She’d been wary of the plan all along to take the Manor and she had kept half an eye on Draco the entire time. When they declared the Manor their own and marched the Death Eaters out of there, she had still kept half an eye on Draco. Draco wasn’t particularly put out by this. In fact, he thought it was quite sensible of her. She had not asked the specifics about what was going on upstairs. For Harry’s sake, and hers, he was glad. He made a cup of tea and placed it on the side next to her.
He pushed Harry down into the mattress before he even had time to do it himself, pushed back into him and started fucking him hard and ruthless, how he wanted it. Harry was screaming again, Draco imagined the rough sheets on his hard cock weren’t doing his condition any favours.
It was one of the things he liked about Major. He wasn’t into gossiping, grudges and internal politics. He was always polite to Draco.
Harry’s stomach churned. At the slight, but also about what Draco was doing. He didn’t follow Draco, true to his word, but when he got back to the common room he opened up the map. Draco was in the room of requirement. Hermione sat down next to him and raised an eyebrow. They were alone in the common room for the moment.
Harry nodded, trying to get his breath back and regain some composure. He took another sip of coffee.
Potter put his hand over Draco’s eye before he could see who responded, who moved. Who’s hot mouth wrapped around his cock as Potter’s thumbs spread him again and pushed his cock back inside.
Draco slammed his hips back against him in protest and Harry cried out, grabbing Draco’s hips so he couldn’t do it again.
“Desperate little thing, aren’t you?” Potter muttered in his ear. “Is it true they put spells on all you subs so you can’t come until a dom lets you?”
Harry sat next to Draco in the office. They had identical sullen looks on their faces as their squad lead Morgan stood in front of them with her arms folded.
Oh god, he was using that voice. Harry had become aware some time after they’d started this that something had snapped in Malfoy, he didn’t know what had caused it, didn’t dare to ask, but it seemed as if Malfoy had become two people. The Malfoy he was used to, who talked dirty and wound him up but at the end of the day wasn’t so bad and would still wrap his arms round him afterwards, kiss him and maybe let him sleep in his bed. And then there was the Malfoy that came out occasionally that was cruel and vindictive, growling at him and pushing him to the limit of everything; pleasure, pain, sanity...He had at first thought that Malfoy had just created this after they’d been fucking once and he’d tried bringing his palm down on Harry’s arse as he fucked him, Harry wasn’t sure exactly what noise he’d made, but he knew that Malfoy had delighted in his response.
Draco hissed and Harry was suddenly aware of then dropping the few inches they’d been floating off the floor and his feet touching back down to the ground. Harry looked around quickly but no one seemed to have noticed.
Harry moved faster, snapping his hips back and forth, moaning and gasping as he did. It felt deeper like this, somehow, with all his weight pushed down on Draco’s cock.
“Maybe it’s because of my dancing skills?” He slid his hands round Harry’s waist. “Or do you just like bad boys?”
Harry leant back against the table and Draco wrapped his arms round his neck, moaning in his ear as Harry guided him up and down.
“You are desperate.” Potter undid his cuffs, spun him round and pushed him face forward against the bars.
Harry leant over him to whisper in his ear, making sure every inch of him was burried inside him as he did.
Harry pushed his now fully hard cock back inside Draco’s tight arse. He groaned at the heat and bit down on Draco’s shoulder. Draco squealed and pushed himself back on Harry’s cock hard.
“Why are you doing this?” Harry asked him. “You’re risking your life for this...for us...you’ve never shown any inkling towards us before...”
“Yeah? You been thinking of me? Twisting in your sheets wanking yourself dry?” Draco whispered in his ear.
“Oh, that’s the wonderful thing about getting fucked in the dark, Potter. It could be anyone,” Draco whispered in his ear.
“Shhh.” Draco slid his thumbs inside together, his fingers splayed over Harry’s arse cheeks. Harry squealed.
Harry managed to cast a cleansing spell on the tap before the water hit Draco’s mouth. He gulped it down and Harry winced. He looked around the rest of the room. There was a toilet in the corner that didn’t smell like it had any running water to it for quite some time. Once Draco had finished drinking he snatched the wand out of Harry’s hand, spelled the toilet clean and spelled the dishes to start washing themselves. He flicked Harry’s wand at a broom in the corner and it sprung to life cleaning the place.
Harry and Draco were silent as they stood in front of each other. Draco put his hand on Harry’s waist and took his hand. Harry resisted the urge to wrap his arms around him.
Draco shook his head at him and took out his wand, muttering under his breath. The coffee maker buzzed happily as Draco cleaned it, spelling all the dust and dirt into the bin.
Harry closed his eyes and tried to ignore him. Like this, against a wall, Harry could pretend it was someone else sending him into a state of ecstasy. He could feel his orgasm building already, no wonder, and felt Draco fucking him harder, brushing against his prostate. Harry let out something near to a squeak.
It was darker out here than he could ever remember it being. Except maybe on that ridiculous little island Uncle Vernon had driven them to all that time ago. The wind was howling just the same as that night. He shivered in the sleeping bag. He heard a tap as a raindrop hit the top of the tent. He prayed it was just the one.
Draco moaned in his ear and jutted his hips against Harry before Harry had even pushed his fingers inside. Harry shuddered.
“Like you’d know what to do with me.” Harry had panicked. It just slipped out. He had no idea what he was thinking of. He’d heard it in a movie once.
“My god. You Gryffindors are challenged.” Draco flicked his wand at the curtains. They shivered then sealed themselves together.
Harry quirked an eyebrow. Surely Draco wasn’t suggesting that they drank on the job. He turned the can and realised Draco had picked him up an iced late from the petrol station.
“Honestly, Potter, if you wanted to get closer you could have just said so...” Malfoy raked a hand through Harry’s hair and pulled him up against him hard.
“Fuuuuuck,” he moaned as Draco sucked him dry, drawing out every tremor and moan from him with his mouth.
He imagined just Malfoy waiting for him, smirking, with those all knowing eyes. I know your secret Potter.
“Oh god yes,” Draco said, wiggling his hips until the entire of Harry’s length was buried inside him. Harry put his hands on the small of Draco’s back. Draco took a handful of Harry’s hair and yanked his head back, kissing him hard as he put his other hand on the back of the chair and started to ride him.
“I’m not sure I’ve ever tried to before,” Harry said. “Ginny did the work for both of us.” He took a sip of the cordial. “That’s delicious, what is it?”
Draco didn’t answer, just carried on bobbing his head. Harry groaned, resigning himself to a humiliating early finish, letting himself buck into Draco’s mouth, he clenched his fists, ready to come down Draco throat but he just…couldn’t. He opened his eyes and looked down at Draco.
Harry groaned but did as he was told, already missing Draco’s dick inside him. Draco ran his hands up the back of Harry’s thighs and Harry shivered. He wanted Draco inside him, right now, pounding him into the bed frame. Harry cock throbbed heavy in between his legs.
He closed his eyes, but the image of Malfoy flashed up again. He snapped them open and stared at the curtains some more. Malfoy’s scent was everywhere, lingering. He couldn’t quite place it. A certain aftershave he’d not smelled before combined with a washing powder that Aunt Petunia wished she could afford.
Draco laughed and took his wand from the side, whispering something under his breath. Harry groaned as all the satisfaction he’d felt disappeared;  replaced by a lust so blinding he could barely think clear enough to realise it was that god damn spell again. He felt his cock growing rock hard.
Draco grinned at him and waved his wand, cleaning them both up. He kissed Harry again and Harry kissed him back, still stunned, groaning inwardly at the warm feeling spreading through him as Draco wrapped his arms and legs around him.
It's been five years since I first wrote this but I finally got a brain wave for how to continue it :D
“I know,” Harry said. “It’s too big for me really. I know it’s nice, but I don’t see why it can’t be given to one of the employees with a family, who might actually use the three bedrooms, and I can have a single bedroom flat.”
Draco rolled his eyes. They would do things the slow way. He turned away from his bedroom and went downstairs to the dining room. Tonks, Remus and Mrs Wesley still sat at the table, but it went quiet as he walked in. Mrs Weasley left the table.
He lay back down on Harry’s chest and closed his eyes. Almost instantly his breathing became rhythmic and deep. Harry stared at the gold fringe at the top of his curtains, his heart still thudding in his chest. How had he gone from a wet dream about Draco to ending up with him in his bed, fucking him senseless then sound asleep on his chest?
Pain already starting to tear at him every moment he looked at Draco, Harry turned away in the guise of putting the common room back to rights after the joyful carelessness of Christmas day. That enviable, oblivious carelessness before he had realized he was in love with him and fucked everything up. When he could look at him and not feel dizzy from the hurt.
“And she said yes, right?” Harry prodded, grinning wildly as he looked at his best mate, whose face was flaming more scarlet than his hair.
Draco nodded, brushing a soft kiss on Harry’s knuckles as he stepped away. Hermione caught Harry’s eye knowingly and smiled at him as he made his way into the kitchen, reaching for one of the few clean glasses left in the house and filling it with water.
The door to the classroom slammed open and Potter staggered into the room, excuses ready on his tongue when he stopped short, a puzzled expression slipping over his famous features. And then he asked the entire class a question that Draco had not known he needed to hear so badly: “Why does the entire classroom smell like Malfoy’s cologne?”
Harry got off of his broom, setting it on the ground beside the worn Quidditch chest that housed the Gryffindor team’s set of balls. He nestled the Quaffle inside, checking that the restraints holding the restless Bludgers were done up tight.
, assumed that you were being held hostage by the slimy git and had to pretend everything was alright or he’d Avada you. So that’s why I’m here to rescue you, but I bashed my head on the chimney coming int through the Floo and stumbled into the Christmas tree and knocked some stuff off of it, so now he’s been alerted to my presence, but don’t worry, Harry, I don’t need the element of surprise to take him down!”
“Yeah, alright, I’ll try to be more carefu— oh, shit!” Potter’s eyes widened as he knocked over his open inkwell, spilling the dark liquid across the table.
“It’s just, it’s the,” he coughed, trying to disguise the chuckle that had slipped out. “The snake sticker that you have on the back?”
“No. No, I suppose I wasn’t,” Malfoy admitted, with something like - amusement? - dancing in his eyes. “Ah well. I guess this is not perhaps exactly how I imagined this coming about, but I believe the Muggles have some sort of saying about how it’s the thought that counts?”
Pansy bristled, but Draco put a warning hand on her arm. He knew from experience that portraits did not take well to backtalk. At best, they would say something rude back. At worst, they would disappear and then they would be stuck out in the hall.
“Talking! You know, like on a date? A Hogsmeade weekend is coming up and I was wondering if you’d like to go.” She smiled shyly up at him, cheeks flushing darker.
Downstairs, Hemione and Ginny were seated on a sofa that they had pushed in close to the fire place, piles of presents stacked neatly in front of them. Harry dumped his unceremoniously beside theirs, before falling back onto another sofa and finding himself suddenly close to a sleepy Draco Malfoy. He had known that Malfoy was going to open presents with them; the Gryffindors had invited him when they had found out that he was the only upper year Slytherin who had stayed and he didn’t much fancy spending Christmas morning with half a dozen second and third years who he barely knew.
“Being my pretend boyfriend doesn’t mean that you can tell me what to do!” Malfoy’s eyes hardened, glinting dangerously.
Letting his sigh be swept away with the wind, Harry turned and stopped dead, sure that his eyes were tricking him. Perhaps he had lost his glasses while he had been flying. He reached a shaky hand up to his face. No, they were still there. Which meant that Draco Malfoy really was running across the Quidditch Pitch towards him, face slightly pinked from the cold and platinum hair completely awry.
Harry shook it off. Malfoy didn’t get to ruin his holiday for him. He had come too far to be fazed by a five minute run-in that was unlikely to ever repeat itself.
Draco grumbled, but conceded. “Bloody scarf is right though, with these bright red bands! It looks like it’s been stabbed! You Gryffindors, so violent!”
A flash of salt seemed to grind into the cracks of Draco’s rapidly crumbling heart. “That’s a damn lie, Potter, and you know it! You just have sidekicks to throw themselves into danger on your behalf, not friends!” He felt a slight pinch of guilt at dragging Granger and Weasley into this when they were blameless, but Harry had started it with his attack, and such things as questioning friendship demanded a response.
A classic smirk swept across Malfoy’s face. “You’re going to have to try a lot harder if you want to get rid of me, Potter, because believe me, the press is nothing and I’m not going anywhere.”
“O’Leary is going to get more ingredients,” the house elf growled. “Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Porter will roll out the dough we have. Do not touch anything.” And with that final warning, the elf disappeared.
Harry was fascinated to see the pale boy’s cheekbones become edged with pink and dared to lean down and brush a soft kiss against the colour, remembering from his stays at the Burrow that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would sweetly greet each other at breakfast in that way.
I hoped you enjoyed getting to see these two poor awkward boys try to figure out what flirting looks like! Kudos and comments are always a day-maker. ;)
Kudos and/or comments are as wonderful as being finished listening to horrific gingerbread kids songs.
“Well, we never were able to go to Hogsmeade together before, so I didn’t think it seemed relevant,” Draco explained, swinging his feet off the edge of the chair moodily.
“I could say the same about you,” Harry said coldly, hand near his pocket ready to grab his wand if necessary, no matter the bustling market of Muggles around them. “Following along at your parents’ heels, lapping up whatever they said, causing your own demise with no one to blame but yourself.”
“Well, unlike some people, I don’t inhale it so fast you miss the taste,” Harry replied, hands shaking a bit as he stood in front of Malfoy, staring into his grey eyes.
“The fuck you’re dying on me, Potter,” Malfoy growled, Harry watching through slitted eyelids as he leaned forward, hair falling over his forehead, as Malfoy moved to put a hand on his forehead, although what good that would have done if he was actually unconscious, Harry didn’t know.
Tired of sitting up in his room avoiding Malfoy, Harry curled up on the sofa beside the fire place, reading a book until O’Leary would announce it was dinner time. The fire was burned down to embers, which emitted a warm heat that sunk into Harry’s bones in a way his flat’s crappy heat system never did. When he got back, he would have to ask Hermione if there was a way to magically install a wood-burning fire place in his living room without making his Muggle neighbours suspicious.
Draco slipped into the Great Hall, pausing a moment beside the entry to prepare himself, before straightening, and marching across the room towards the Gryffindor table. His heart seemed to ache in time with his footsteps as he allowed himself one last look at Harry before it was all over. At the boy who had been his enemy. Who had become his friend. And ultimately, who he had fallen in love with, a torturous weakness that he despised with every bone in his body. He had always been brought up to seek revenge against those who had hurt him. But he had never been taught what to do when the person who had caused him pain meant so much to him that it would bring
“Mmhmm,” Draco said skeptically, smiling at the Gryffindor’s retreating back. Honestly, Potter could not lie to save his life. It was almost extraordinary how bad he was at it.
“Bullshit,” Malfoy pronounced smugly and Harry feared that he may have cracked a couple of ribs trying not to laugh at the gobsmacked expressions of both of his friends’ faces. This was better entertainment than the Quidditch World Cup.
With exaggerated motions, Malfoy made a great show of incorporating the flour into the rest of the mixture, still managing to throw some onto the floor.
Seething with frustration, Draco slammed the book shut, just as a panting Potter slid into the seat across from him.
Harry loved Hogwarts during the holidays. Granted, being at Hogwarts was always wonderful, but especially during break. Hermione made him, Ron, and Malfoy sit down and get through all of their assigned work on the first day, so the rest of the time they had nothing to worry about but getting sick from eating too many Bertie Botts.
Malfoy disappeared mysteriously for the rest of the day, with Harry only catching brief glances of him hurriedly downing a cup of coffee or a bowl of soup that O’Leary forced upon him. Puzzled at the lack of his presence, given that this was one of his last few days at the house, Harry tried to speak to him several times and suggest they play a game of cards or simply sit and read beside each other, but Malfoy brushed him off every time with some sort of excuse, running off before Harry got a chance to question him any further.
But Flitwick’s reminder was mostly lost under the sounds of students leaving class. Chair legs screeched across the floor and conversations spooled out into the air to form an intricate web of words, so blurred together that the individual pieces were barely distinguishable.
As always, kudos and/or comments bring me happiness akin to eating curry, wearing ballgowns, and listening to Hamilton, so go ahead! Do it! You know you want to!
Malfoy offered a hand, bowing his head with the trained courtesy customary of any Pureblood heir. “Madam Malkin, the pleasure is ours. It has been far too long since we’ve visited your fine establishment.”
“A likely story,” Malfoy said, his voice quiet when it should have been disdainful as he looked back at Harry, gaze tracing soft lines across his face as he leaned closer. Harry could smell the apple pie on his breath, cinnamon and sugar, as he softly closed the gap.
"While waiting for Draco to come home, Harry starts worrying that he may have gotten stranded in the blizzard."
The house elf sighed dramatically as he saw the mess of dough on the counter, immediately setting them to work rerolling it, placing Harry in charge of getting the cookies on the pan.
“Actually, Aunt Andromeda, he’s correct,” Malfoy admitted reluctantly. “Through some twist of fate, Potter is staying here for a few weeks.”
“What?” Harry distractedly, focused on the action below them. The Quaffle had just been dropped and multiple chasers from both teams were now flying down to the ground to try and retrieve it before Madam Hooch could blow for a time out.
“Alright then!” Draco breathed out a sigh of relief that was partly for himself and partly to fit into the act. “Shall we go work on that Charms paper?”
Draco shot him a grin that made him weak at the knees. They sat down. Harry winced at the bottle of pale liquid that was still waiting patiently by the door until Draco waved it over.
Harry did, again and again, sure that the only sound he ever wanted to here again was Draco’s squeals. Harry stood up, picking Draco up with him.
“Then why can’t you hit me? Why can’t you even cast the tamest curse against me? Why, time after time do you let me do whatever I want to you...”
He was awake late one night, Draco had gone and slept in his own bed for a change, to see if it might help him sleep better. Harry had suggested sleeping potions but Draco said they didn’t work on him. Something in Harry snapped. He got out of bed, put on his slippers and dressing gown and marched to Dumbledore’s office.
Harry turned, his cheeks burning, as he lay flat on his back. He kept his eyes closed. He didn’t want to see the tented towel he knew was covering his groin.
He’d delicately step into the water, in that delicate way that he did everything, barely making a splash, and would lie down on top of Harry. He’d slide on top of him, kiss him, their hot naked bodies together.
“Fucking hell, Potter,” Draco said breathlessly. “I wish you could see what you looked like right now.”
“Fuck!” That he had not been expecting. Doms did not tend to rim. At least not the ones he was used to.
Draco pulled back and turned Harry over; happy that he was still somewhat conscious, he stepped back and walked over to the bathroom to finally wash the dust off his skin.
“I’m sorry.” He knew far too well why Draco remembered all the dates that led up to the war so well.
“Why should I?” Draco asked, putting his forehead up against Harry’s and raising his eyebrows challengingly.
“That arse Potter, god.” He slapped his hand down on it and Harry jumped, his cock twitching to attention.
He moved faster, harder, letting his body take over. The natural snaps of his hips pushed him hard and deep into Draco’s arse and Draco moaned underneath him.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned, Malfoy’s body weight fully against his own was too much. He flipped Malfoy onto his back and Malfoy wrapped his legs round Harry’s waist, clamping them tight around him.
Draco leant his wait against Harry, pushing him flush against the door. Harry was very aware of the sound of students filling the corridors as they moved between lessons.
Draco pushed two cold fingers inside him and Harry tensed, usually Draco spent a fair amount of time playing with his cock before he went anywhere near his arse.
He cried out, shaking above Harry as he came in long threads of Harry’s face. Harry was surprised he didn’t come untouched from the display. Harry winced as he felt it hit his hair.
Harry splashed some water on himself as a last resort to quell the madness rising within. He didn’t not care how Malfoy smelled. He cared what Malfoy was up to. About what was so important that he had to stay at school to take care of. The task that Voldemort had assigned to him.
They walked out of the house with its all lights on glowing in the night as the Aurors scoured it for evidence.
Hermione threw her hands up in the air and stormed back out into the hall. It caused Draco great pleasure to think how outraged his father would be to have all these mudblood’s storming around in his house. He’d write a detailed letter to him about it in Azkaban if it wouldn’t compromise their position.
Malfoy was exhausting him already. He averted his eyes as Draco dropped his towel carelessly on the floor and climbed into bed with him.
What was unnerving about the recent development in his obsession with Malfoy was that to Hermione and Ron, nothing had changed. They rolled their eyes just the same when Harry didn’t answer because he was too busy staring at Malfoy. When he suggest they take a detour to ‘keep an eye on him’.
Harry nodded and picked it up off the table and took a few hurried gulps. He choked a little and swung his legs round to sit up on the sofa. Draco slapped him on the back.
“Yes,” Harry agreed, thinking anything was better than being like this. Besides, he’d have to be an idiot to try anything here. It was far too well guarded.
Harry rolled his eyes and turned off the shower. He wrapped himself in one of Draco’s fluffy towels and walked back to the bed. He spelled his hair dry and got into bed, lying on his back and staring at the ceiling.
Harry’s heart leapt. Jesus Christ. How could this feel so right? How could Draco fucking Malfoy who’d arranged the kidnapping of him and his friends for Lord fucking Voldemort feel so right.
“I don’t charge, if that’s what you’re thinking. You’ve just got some time left on your treatment and I would really love a go on that.”
“No, I wanna wank over you. I’m gonna come all over that face.” Draco ran his finger from the top of Harry’s forehead, down his nose, over his lips.
Harry gestured to the red machine in the corner of the kitchen then went and lay down on his back on the sofa. The room was open plan, with just the bathroom and bedroom being separate. He watched as Draco took some mugs down from the cupboard and turned on the coffee maker.
Hermione caught his eye and Harry shook his head. She gave an exasperated sigh. Harry waited until they were walking out together to talk to her privately. He’d pulled her to the side in one of the annexes but he hadn’t even opened his mouth before she shot him down.
“Good...sooo gooooddd.....” Harry moaned, he could feel it getting bigger, then shrieked as it pushed hard into his prostate. Draco grinned and waved his wand; it seemed lock it on that spot, fucking him hard.
“I haven’t been giving you anything, Potter, I swear. I have bigger things on my mind that amusing myself by making you fall in love with Professor Sprout or whoever it is you’ve developed sudden affections for.”
Draco cried out above him, still pounding away at his arse, drawing out every scream, every shudder, till they were both spent and the Slytherin collapsed on top of him.
“Look, Potter. Us fucking isn’t having any effect whatsoever on the war. I’m not telling you anything, apart from how delicious your arse is. And you’re not telling me anything, apart from how much you love my cock. There’s no problem.”
“Terrible posture? Tsk Potter, your knots have knots. Its a good job you came to have it sorted out.”
Harry whirled around, suddenly furious. Malfoy was sat with his legs crossed, regarding him cooly, eyebrows raised, waiting for Harry’s outburst. He didn’t understand how anyone could manage to look as threatening in a dressing gown as Malfoy did right then. Harry raised his wand at him. He had no idea what he was going to do, he just knew that he wanted to make him feel the same pain he did every time he thought about him.
“Yes, Malfoy, cos I’m not a spoilt little bitch like you...” Harry snapped at him. He didn’t know where he was getting this confidence from, normally he wouldn’t dare speak to Malfoy like that. He knew exactly what he was capable of doing to him.
Harry jumped as the clock struck 4pm. It caught him by surprise every time. Draco gave him an amused smile.
Draco slid his thumbs in between Harry’s cheeks and spread them open. Harry trembled in Draco’s grip.
“Don’t you dare. You stood up against your family, against Voldemort, you’re one of the bravest people I know.”
“I don’t know! You tell me! Part of Voldemort’s plan. Distract me, get me out of the way before he strikes?”
Harry winced. He knew exactly what Draco wanted. He didn’t know why he was resisting. Saying something didn’t necessarily make it true. Maybe it was because it was true. I must not tell lies.
Malfoy took a small step back, staring at him intently, jerking him off fast, waiting patiently for him to come undone.
Harry pushed himself harder, wanting all of it, ignoring his throats protesting. He closed his eyes in frustration as he gagged again and yanked his head back, gasping in a breath.
“Illegal goods,” Harry rolled his eyes. “It could be anything from muggle slaves to an enchanted sofa. You think they could have been a bit more specific.”
“You keep patronising me, Draco, I’m going to put you through the fucking window...” Harry growled at him.
The second Death Eater trained his wand on Harry and came towards him. Harry kept his hands up, watching the wand to Malfoy’s temple closely.
“Hours...” Malfoy laughed again and reached up and grabbed the back of Harry’s hair, pulling him roughly into a kiss. Harry pushed him back.
He made himself a cup of tea and sat down at the table, but frowned as he heard a banging noise coming from what appeared to be the cellar. Helook around, sure that he must be hearing things. He decided that Ron must have put something down there...some cursed object that was bouncing off the walls, no doubt. He sighed as he heard the banging becoming more insistent and reluctantly put his cup of tea back on the table, walking over to the trapdoor leading to the cellar.
“Fine.” Potter placed his hands over his ears with exaggerated motions, petulantly mouthing “Happy?”
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to pry. You don’t have to answer— well, technically you do have to answer, but we can forget about the game, I didn’t mean—”
“Your common room is a lot cozier than mine,” he said conversationally as Harry tucked the blankets around him. “There aren’t even any carpets to cover the stone floors. Leeches any heat right out of your bones! Wait a second, hey! What are you trying to do, Potter? Bloody re-sort me?”
“How do you feel about a bit of an adventure?” Malfoy glanced over at him, eyes gleaming despite his nonchalant tone.
“Alright, now Ron, first and foremost, I’m not in any kind of danger,” Harry said soothingly. “It turns out that Malfoy happened to own the house I was staying at during my vacation. No nefarious plan. Just simple coincidence.”
At one o’clock in the afternoon, they began preparing to go to the Burrow. Harry packed up the last of his things, looking around the room that had been his home for the past few weeks, thinking of his bedroom in his London flat where the sunrise didn’t sprawl through his window and the bed reached both sides of the room.
Better than the kind of enemy where you want to put your tongue in their mouth, Harry thought wryly.
“That would make sense,” Potter agreed, standing beside him, shuffling his feet awkwardly, a motion which Draco was quickly learning meant he was cold.
“Fine. Then get in the car and if I hear one more joke!” Malfoy slammed his door shut behind him, leaving the threat hanging in the air.
“Old house just outside of a small Muggle town,” Malfoy said conversationally, joining Harry at the window. “Wizarding family used to live here but it’s been abandoned for awhile and the Ministry hasn’t removed the Floo Network entrance yet. I come out here on Hogsmeade weekends to get away from it all and just have some peace and quiet. Well,” he sighed. “And for another reason too. Come on. Might as well get it over with.”
Draco waited until his friends’ carriage was out of sight, then started trudging back to the castle. He scuffed at the thick snow that covered the ground, the crystals stamped down and marked by a hundred footsteps. Not lain out in unmarred sheets like it had been the other night when he and Potter had been outside, flinging handfuls of the stuff at each other and then collapsing down and staring up at the stairs until past midnight. They had had to sneak back into the castle, nearly getting caught by Filch in the process. But for some reason, it had been worth it.
“Agree to disagree, Potter,” Malfoy said, chin tilted stubbornly in that way he always had when they had fought at school.
Wow, this chapter was surprisingly hard to write! It was nothing like what I'd been planning for their relationship progression, but when you get another mistletoe prompt, you've got deal with that challenge! And I think it turned out alright, so here we are!
Malfoy glanced over at him, caught off guard. “Well, uh, yes, yes they do,” he managed. “They have a national league, although their international team isn’t very good.”
Ron groaned, throwing his hands up into the air. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Harry! If you’re so worried, just bloody talk to the git about it! Just preferably not at dinner, so the rest of us can eat in peace without your drama! I’d rather like to eat my food without worrying about getting hit by a stray hex.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, you two, that wasn’t even our doing! The idiot did it to himself.”
Her face softened as she took him in, eyes flickering over the grouping at the table. “Hello, Harry. Sorry to bother you so late. I’m just here to retrieve my
But more importantly, Harry had gotten to see the respect that shone in Malfoy’s eyes every time he debated Hermione, a girl he had painted with a demeaning slur only four years before without a second thought. The honesty when Malfoy had told him about the Muggles he had befriended in France and how he had realized that he wasn’t so different from them after all. And just tonight, the utter sorrow he had expressed when told about the source of the scar on Harry’s hand.
Harry came back to the present with a start, cheeks reddening as he turned to Madam Malkin, who was eyeing him quizzically through her spindly wire glasses. “Sorry, what did you just say?”
“You’re such a child.” Draco said then paused. “Jesus Christ... I can feel the magic coming off you. Its a wonder you don’t explode.”
“Come on, Potter, is that the best you’ve got? If you want to make me come you’ll have to move a little faster...”
Harry was still trying to put his mind back the right way up when Draco pulled him over to his lap and rested his head on his shoulder. Harry’s heart flipped. His brain freaked.
Draco pushed him up against the wall by his chest with his forearm and held him there hard. Harry bucked in Draco’s unmoving hand and whimpered.
“Okay, Potter, let’s see what you’ve got…” Draco pumped Harry’s cock hard and fast, his other hand still unrelenting on his neck.
He poured himself a glass of water and walked into the bathroom. It ceased singing. It seemed disappointed. Harry had cut it off mid Car Wash chorus.
Draco sighed, stood up properly and crossed his wrists in front of his waist. Harry felt strangely proud of him, for not running, not hiding, not pleading or cursing at the jury like so many of their prisoners had today. He looked smart and respectable in his long black dress robes, his platinum hair and ivory skin shone in the candle light. He didn’t look haggard and unkempt like so many of their visitors today. Harry thought with a strange twinge in his chest that his father would be proud of him, if he’d been around to see it.
Dance classes with the Slytherins were never going to go well. It had been Neville’s fault, suggesting to one of the teachers that if the Yule Ball had been good for relations between the three schools, surely it could be good for strengthening relationships between the houses at ‘this challenging time’. Even the teachers knew Neville was just desperate to get his dancing shoes on again but they’d agreed anyway.
Draco enjoyed how quiet the library was later in the evening. Most students had already begun to make their way back to their common rooms to settle in for the night. This meant that he, Potter, Weasley, and Granger practically had the run of the place, save for Madam Pince and a few obligatory Ravenclaws that Draco suspected even slept among the stacks.
“Well, I’m here to rescue you,” Ron said matter-of-factly, jabbing his wand towards Malfoy, who he had just noticed over Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t even think about it, Malfoy! It’s two again one now!”
what your cologne smells like, Malfoy. Cinnamon and cloves with a hint of citrus. But I’m telling you, you don’t smell as good as you usually do. It’s different.”
“Well, Potter, one never can be too sure,” he drawled, his familiar competitive spark burning out any remaining anguish in his gaze.
Harry was fascinated to watch as Malfoy hummed along, eyes flicking consistently between his various sets of mirrors, even though they had yet to pass another car. He was relaxed in a way that Harry had never seen before, a small smile quirking over the corners of his mouth.
“I guess we will,” Harry said nervously, watching as Malfoy returned to his room and deciding right then and there to give the whole thing up before it got any more embarrassing. Obviously Malfoy had caught on to his mistletoe hijink.
Potter scowled, stepping towards him. “I know something’s going on, so why don’t you just tell me so we can have this over with?”
“Well, well,” Pansy drawled, a feline smile perching on her lips. “What do we have here? A little lost Gryffindor separated from his minions?”
“Thank Merlin,” he said, striding over to Harry’s side and leaning down to roll the person over to see their face, their ginger hair flopping unceremoniously over their brow.
The man in front of Harry had reached the stall and was speaking to the barista, hands gesturing to the menu.
Malfoy let out an amused snort, covering it up quickly with a forced cough as Harry stared at Pansy.
Draco watched with amusement as the two gathered up their things and pulled on their winter cloaks and scarves, which were all too necessary when going out into the castle’s drafty corridors now that December was well upon them. They muttered hurried goodbyes, before leaving him and Potter to smirk at their obviousness.
“Well, at least I wasn’t the one who was always throwing myself into danger just so people would notice me—”
“Give them here!” Malfoy hissed, gesturing impatiently while keeping a pleasant smile on his face for any onlookers.
They paused, looking at their respective tables where each of their sets of friends were still focused on their breakfasts.
“You’re on,” Draco said, taking hold of his gnome firmly and whirling it around and then releasing it, sending it flying through the air past the aforementioned snow bank.
Soon the floor was covered in boxes of candy, new books, thick-knit sweaters, and other various knickknacks and baubles, all strewn among scraps of colourful wrapping paper and strands of ribbon. Every so often someone would proudly thrust a gift into the air, chattering about its irrefutable merits and making a point of showing it to everyone else, who dutifully oohed and ahhed appreciatively, even if they didn’t understand the appeal.
“Right,” Malfoy said glumly, leaning back against the trunk of the tree. “You know, couples don’t have to do everything together! Us doing separate things for the Hogsmeade weekend will make it seem more authentic!”
Draco caught up to her, looking up at the portrait lady. “Hello,” he said politely, unsure how Potter thought they were going to get in without a password. They had never discussed this part of the plan.
“That’s why we’re not telling anyone about us yet," Draco soothed, before pausing. "Are you saying that you want us to go public?” Draco watched Harry’s face closely, pale eyebrows knotted.
Rolling his eyes, but feeling slightly better now that he had the final piece of his morning routine in hand, Draco opened the bottle and jotted on the cologne, feeling as though facing the day were a tad more manageable now. He brought his right wrist up to his face, hoping to breath in the familiar scent, but his nasal passages were too clogged to allow the comforting cinnamon and cloves to permeate.
It was snowing again, the flakes heavier than the day before, clumping on the sidewalk under his feet.
“I think he’s dying,” Ron said matter-of-factly, watching Draco with a sort of horrified fascination.
Immediately, Harry chucked the snowball in his hand as hard as he could, sending it smashing against Malfoy’s defensive wall. In response, a volley of three or four came careening towards him, forcing him to dive behind cover.
Draco sagged with relief, running a hand through his hair. “Brilliant.” He leaned over and kissed Harry fervently. The kind of kiss that promised many more to come. Over days and weeks and years.
I absolutely love the carol 'Silent Night' and piano renditions of it are beautiful, so I highly encourage you all to look one up and listen to it. This is the one I was listening to while writing and it's gorgeous: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhC90ReY49I&list=LL&index=2
“You have to get them nice and dizzy so it takes them awhile to find their way back,” Harry explained, turning around to see Draco’s look of shock at the method.
“No, it’s fine,” Draco said, picking up a tome bound in tattered purple cloth and streaked with something that looked suspiciously like pumpkin juice. “I can use Hutchen’s version instead.”
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, how good to see you both,” Madam Malkin greeted them, coming out of the back of the store. Her long burgundy robes swooped around her feet as she walked over to them.
Merlin, if only he’d been a Hufflepuff, living without a jot of ambition! Then he wouldn’t be in this situation!
Harry chewed his lip worriedly, eyes fixated on the classroom door, just as they had been since he had arrived. “He wasn’t at breakfast,” he pointed out anxiously for the umpteenth time.
Moments later, he got his wish as he suddenly struck into something else, halting his broom’s spinning motion. Gasping and blinking his eyes open to see what he’d hit, Harry looked around to see another broom hovering in the air beside him, bobbing softly in the wind swishing across the lake.
Hesitantly, Harry allowed the Slytherin to interlace their fingers. Malfoy’s hands were shockingly warm and Harry pressed their palms closer together to chase away the cold that had seeped into his bones.
“Thanks,” Harry said hesitantly, staring at Malfoy’s oddly guileless expression for a moment before scribbling the information down.
“In France. Did you get a chance to play any Quidditch?” Harry explained, fiddling with the stem of the fork at his place setting.
Draco sniffed delicately and rolled his eyes. “Honestly, Potter, for someone so famous for escaping death in clever ways, you are awfully dense. There is no magical instant cure for a cold. You just tough it out.”
Wow, it's hard to believe that actual Christmas Eve is only a few days away! I still have gifts to work on while being extremely tired, so wish me luck!
Bewildered, Harry came down the stairs into the foyer. “What are you two doing here?” He asked, hugging his godson and Andromeda.
“What?” Harry gaped at her, unsure of how they had gone from an offer to talk to a proclamation of love within the span of a minute.
“Yes, but that didn’t happen,” Harry said firmly, slowly walking towards Malfoy until he could place a hand on the other boy’s shoulder.
“Oh, so that’s how it’s going to be?” Potter called after him, and moments later a ball of snow smacked against his back. Draco elegantly flipped him off, using his other hand to brush the snow away.
Also, from my limited research on the UK’s drivers license regulations, it appears that you can’t drive a car until you’re 17, which Draco is not in this story, so I had to modify that a bit as well.
The second the words were out of his mouth, he regretted them. Harry went very pale for a moment, before a cruel light came into his eyes.
“Master Teddy!” O’Leary beamed, setting down the cookies and tea so he could return the child’s hug. “Would Master Teddy like a cookie? O’Leary made them himself!”
“We should take you back to the castle or you’re going to freeze,” Harry said slowly, tearing his gaze away from Malfoy’s.
Draco found himself choking on emotion, tears clogging his eyes from the pressure bottled up inside of him. He hated this. He hated
“And now we need to cut out the cookies,” he explained, passing Malfoy a cookie cutter in the shape of a star.
Harry found himself standing guard at the house’s front window, eyes peering anxiously through the whirling waves of snow for a shock of pale hair or a dark coat. O’Leary said nothing, only setting a cup of coffee beside him, which Harry ignored, not able to pull his gaze away from the window for a second.
Draco squeezed his hand, insides fizzing with happiness like he had drank a bottle of Butterbeer too quickly. “See you then.”
“So,” Pansy Parkinson said, leaning across the table towards Harry, a dark gleam in her eyes. “What are your intentions towards our Draco?”
“Yes, and he’s going to kill me,” Harry said grimly, crouching beside his best mate and muttering the counter-curse.
“Happy Christmas to you as well, O’Leary,” Malfoy said pointedly, tugging Harry down onto the sofa beside the fire place.
“It was in here somewhere,” she muttered to herself, scanning the smudged columns of text and rustling through the pages. “Ah, here it is!”
“Damn, these things really do taste bloody awful,” Malfoy said with a shudder, stretching his new form.
Stonily silent, the two boys walked out of the castle and across the grounds to the Quidditch pitch, where the stands were already filled with a roiling mass of students and teachers alike. Yellow and blue pennants snapped merrily in the fierce November gusts of wind and coordinated cheers rang up to the dark, cloud-strewn sky that looked as though flurries of snow could burst from it at any moment.
Harry was shocked by the thoughtfulness of the gift, warmth already sinking into his skin. “That’s brilliant, Malfoy.” He looked up at the other boy, smiling. “Really. I’ll use them all the time.”
“He could come too!” Harry insisted quickly. “Really. Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t mind at all. Please come.”
In which Gryffindors prove, once again, that subtlety is not their strong suit, and Harry and Draco experience the natural magic of snow.
And now this mark of the holiday season had been tarnished by the results of a fame he had stumbled across in self defense.
“You bought me a present,” Malfoy teased, sounding terribly smug and self-satisfied. “Presumptuous much, Potter?”
At last, Malfoy primly perched at the end of the bleacher, back so straight it looked painful. Harry slumped down beside him, gazing down at the Quidditch pitch and the brightly uniformed players gathering on either side. The crowd cheered excited and Harry caught sight of Ron seated on the other side of the stands. He waved and Ron grinned back, smile fading when his gaze shifted to Malfoy.
Anger was good. He could deal with anger. Anger made him feel alive; it would burn hot through his veins, and he could sneer at people, and plot revenge with his friends, who would only be too eager to be involved. The first thing Pansy had said to him after the break-up was that she was ready to go kick Harry’s ass as soon as he said the word. Her eyes had burned with the fury that Draco so desperately wanted to feel, her cheeks flushing with the heat as her hands clenched into determined fists, ready to hurt whoever had done him harm.
Draco’s heart automatically leapt at Harry’s name, before slumping back down. “I’m not devastated,” he replied carefully, trying to make sure his voice sounded neutral. “Now, if you’ll please hand me back my book—”
“You know me so well, O’Leary,” Malfoy said, smiling down at the elf so genuinely that Harry could barely believe his eyes.
“What a shame,” Snape said thinly. “Who can tell Mr. Potter what valuable piece of instruction he missed while he was off doing Merlin knows what?” He paused, surveying the class before reluctantly giving in to the only hand raised. “Miss Granger, what a surprise.” He pointed at Hermione’s -for once- timidly raised hand, gesturing for her to go forward.
“Oh, damn, did I spill porridge on my shirt during breakfast?” Harry cursed, looking down to see what blemish his uniform was sporting.
“How about some carols while we wait?” Harry suggesting, pushing Malfoy towards the piano before he and the elf could get into it again.
“Thanks.” Malfoy caught it and kept it out as he walked past Harry to see what was in the room beyond.
“I mean, idiot, it usually takes me about half an hour the first time. So, do you want to put a movie on or something?”
Harry tried to not to shake in anticipation. He did not want to be the trembling virgin again. His body had other ideas.
Harry grabbed Draco and apparated away. They landed with everyone else in a heap on the floor of headquarters.
Draco slid his lips down Harry’s cock, easily taking it to the back of his throat and bobbing his head like nothing Harry’s had ever known.
Harry didn’t feel nearly tired enough to sleep, but didn’t really see what else there was to do. He slid down and rested his head on the pillow and felt Draco do the same. He flicked the light off with his wand and lay on his side, facing away from Draco. Within about five minutes he felt Draco’s arm round his waist and his chest against his back as he cuddled up to him. It sent all kinds of confusing messages through his head and he tensed.
“You have fun without me, Potter. There’s a trunk under the bed, if you feel the need for assistance.”
“Oh god.” She stood with her back to them silently for a few seconds. Harry could imagine the look of horror on her face. He got up and pulled his dressing gown on then threw Draco’s shirt at him.
“He’s told me he’s been asked to do something, something awful. I don’t know what. But he’s not, he’s not bad Professor, but if he doesn’t do it they’ll hurt his family and he’s not eating and he’s not sleeping and I don’t know what to do… I can’t help him.” It poured out if Harry like a pensive memory, a gush of feeling that wracked his body as it was released. He realised he had tears pouring down his cheeks.
“You poor boy. Well. Let’s get you out of those Death Eater clothes, and get some nutrition in you.”
“Enough! I don’t care if you are the Great Harry Potter or you’re the noble redeemed Death Eater Draco Malfoy. You will be civil to each other. Or you will
“Is there a problem?” Sally asked, looking between the two of them as they continue to stare at each other.
“If you start trying to ‘save me’ and ‘show me the light’ I am ending this right now,” Draco said, realising what Harry was staring at.
“Yeah, you want that don’t you? Does it keep you up all night? Thinking about my prick? Do you think it’ll be even worse, now you know how big it is, how it feels in your hand?”
“Work out much?” Draco smirked at his ran his thumbs down Harry’s now defined arms and laced their hands together. Harry squirmed, Draco’s thigh kept brushing against his hard cock. Draco held Harry’s hands down pointedly, leant down until their eyes were inches apart and grabbed Harry’s lower lip with his teeth.
The candles were dim in the dungeons. They had been running these trials all day. Harry approximated the candles had only half an inch of wax left. Now, mentally exhausted, desperate for sunlight and if he was honest, a little bored, Harry found his eyes meeting Draco Malfoy’s. He was far too tried for what he was about to do.
“There are other ways of doing it, if you’re not fussy about your spells. You cast a silencing charm, right?”
Harry’s respect of Dumbledore won out and he clambered down under the grate. He felt Dumbledore cast the paralysis spell on him and swore. He never should have listened to him. Now he really was helpless as the Death Eaters, and Draco, burst through the door. Draco led, ashen faced, with Bellatrix right behind him, a deranged smile on her face.
“Fuck!” he yelled one final time and collapsed on top of Harry’s back. Harry’s arms gave way and he went face first onto the floor. He couldn’t bring himself to care.
The bath started singing to him to tell him it was full. He cursed to the moon and back which ever minister had had that installed. The housekeeping said it was old magic, and no one could remove it. None of the past ministers were owning up to having done it, and that was just the ones that were alive.
“Please what? Please fuck you wide open? Get balls deep inside you? Is that what you’ve been dreaming about?”
“Yesss...” Harry sighed. His body was melting. Coming apart in Draco’s hands as he pushed his fingers all the way in. He was sure to disappear through the cracks in the floorboard any second now. Draco’s fingers felt huge, delicious, but huge. Stretching him impossibly wide. He gasped as Draco’s fingers hit something inside, something amazing.
He held Draco down tight by his neck as he kissed him, pumping their cocks together with his other hand.
“Holy shit.” Harry focused on the poor brightly feathered bird as the two men staggered with it across the gravel driveway, skidding and crunching their way towards the door. He snapped.
“Come on now, Potter, you’re actually my prisoner now, just like you always dreamed in your sick little fantasies. They were my sick little fantasies too, of course, but...” Malfoy trailed off, grinning, clearly delighted that it had all worked out so well. He picked Harry up easily, apparently the spell made him weightless too, and carried him upstairs.
“If you’d like to underdress down to your underwear and lie down on the coach and cover yourself with the towel, I’ll be back in just a moment.”
“Oh right, yeah.” Harry flicked his wand at the collapsed table under the sofa and assembled it in the space he’d cleared for doing his exercises in the morning.
“How did they find out about this place?” Hermione took back over the questioning as Harry seemed reluctant to continue.
Harry heard the rustling of Draco rummaging in his bag before he stood back up again. Draco undid Harry’s cloak from behind and Harry heard him carefully fold it and place it on the side. He reached round and undid Harry’s belt matter-of-factly and let his trousers drop to the ground.
As Granger proceeded to explain the rules of the game, Potter passed out stacks of the brightly coloured tokens, which Draco learned were called ‘chips’. By the end of Granger’s speech, he still had barely a clue of how to play, but she stared so fiercely when she asked if there were any questions that he didn’t dare say a thing.
“Well, Mr. Potter, while you might get away with such behaviour with the rest of the world, such disrespect will not be tolerated in my classroom. 50 points from Gryffindor,” Snape snarled silkily, tossing the words over his shoulder as he walked back up to the front of the room. “And if you had not been so late, your other query would have been answered as well.”
Harry elbowed him in the ribs. “If you always order as antagonistically as you did when I ran into you, I’m amazed you’re not blacklisted from coming here.”
“I don’t think so,” she said, oblivious to Ron’s crushed expression. “It’s supposed to be pretty cold out and Gryffindor’s not playing, so I think I’ll just stay in and go over my Transfiguration notes.”
Harry couldn’t stop himself from laughing. Draco stared at him, frowning as Harry gripped onto the wall for support, fearing he would fall over he was shaking so hard with laughter.
As the sun dipped down below the horizon, streaking the sky with swathes of brilliant colours, Harry began to think about dinner, determined not to miss it like he had the day before.
Draco’s team barely inched out a victory just as they were all called in to do presents, and Harry knew Draco was never going to let him forget it, smirk seemingly etched permanently on his face.
“She out-Slytherined me,” he said ruefully, leviosaing the strands around the living room to settle on the book shelves.
Harry went silent, realizing what he’d just said. Malfoy was staring at him with wide-eyes, just as surprised as he was.
“Oh, I’m so sorry.” Hermione’s face fell with sympathy. She and Ron had seen how he had lit up every Christmas and how he had stared in delight at the decorations around Hogwarts and the dinners Mrs. Weasley would cook.
He smiled up at her half-heartedly. “It’s alright. I’ve made it through five years of this, I’ll survive this round.”
Harry picked up his broom, hoping that they could at least have this conversation on the way back to the castle. “What do you want, Malfoy?” He asked tiredly, stepping to move past him.
By the time that they were walking to Potions after lunch, Draco was leaning his weight nearly fully onto Harry while Ron and Hermione carried both of their bags with concerned expressions on their faces. Harry took the fact that even Ron was worried about Draco as a sign that things were really bad now.
Harry simply stood there, looking at Draco, who was staring up at him so earnestly. Still tilting over to one side slightly, but no amount of champagne in the world, wizard or Muggle, could wash away the unabashed love in his beautiful eyes.
He sobered, hands tightening on the wheel. “And that’s when I realized that . . . all these things that I had been told to believe . . . didn’t really matter. That really, me and them weren’t so different after all. Sure, I can use magic, but did you know that Muggles have gone to the Moon?”
Realizing that he had made a terrible mistake and likely just incited his own death, Harry scrambled to his feet and took off running, Malfoy chasing after him, issuing threats in a thundering voice.
By the end of the time limit, their gingerbread house was a perfect mess of candy and delicate icing, and Harry couldn’t be prouder.
Besides, Harry realized, heart sinking, he would be living a lie. Draco would never feel the same things that Harry felt for him. Not after everything.
Harry passed Draco the monogrammed handkerchief his boyfriend kept in the front pocket of his school bag. “No, you’re not.” Harry said firmly, before walking up to the front of the classroom to where Slughorn was puttering around with the test potion for the lesson.
Harry groaned, but Malfoy dragged him over to an older gentleman who was setting up a sign advertising pies outside of his bakery.
Harry felt his face begin to flush as his mind immediately brought up soft skin and strangely burning touches and stormy grey eyes that he was used to seeing only scorn in. “Um,” he coughed, suddenly unable to meet Ron’s gaze. “It started as a kind of competition thing, with flirting I guess, and we would each try to one-up each other and then out of nowhere he just kissed me. And then Parkinson got after us because apparently Slytherins are far more publicly prudish than we thought and he’s been acting strange ever since.”
“Uh-huh,” Harry said, settling down beside Draco and curling an arm around his shoulder. “Take your pick, Draco, we can’t be cozy and violent.”
He sighed, but took the large piece of luggage that Pansy was impatiently holding out to him. “Merlin, Pans, trying to smuggle out rocks?” He groaned, muscles protesting at the weight.
“Well, there’s something else too, I guess,” Harry said hesitantly, pulling back to look at Draco. “It’s just that, when they do start dating, no one’s going to care.”
Harry trailed off as Malfoy came to a sudden stop, turning and studying Harry’s face, as if it were a painting or a building that he wasn’t quite sure what he thought about.
Sighing inwardly, Draco summoned up some fresh resolve and tipped his chin up, gazing back coolly at the gawking onlookers with an air of utter boredom. He was just walking to dinner with his boyfriend. Nothing unusual to see at all.
Malfoy smirked, delightedly taking in their obvious reactions to the insinuation. “Sweet Salazar, you mean you two aren’t together?” He said innocently.
“Yes, you heard me right. Amortentia. The strongest love potion known to man.” The hint of a smile curled over Snape’s thin lips. “And while I will not be administering it to anyone, the potion is so strong that even the smell of it can reveal truths that even we ourselves do not know. In a moment, I will release the magical seal on top of the cauldron and immediately each of you will find this classroom filled with smells that represent things which you are most attracted to.”
Harry sat down at the island with his cup of coffee, watching as Malfoy cracked two eggs expertly into a pan. The entire scene felt extremely bizarre to Harry, sitting in a kitchen at six a.m. while his long-time nemesis cooked him eggs.
“It’s alright,” Harry assured him, stomach churning uncomfortably with panic. What had he been thinking?! And before his brain had a chance to catch up with his mouth, he said, “Let’s just get it over so we can go free.”
“So it is,” he said faintly, falling back against the couch. Spotting a glimpse of silver out of the corner of his eye, he turned and plucked his forgotten cufflink from in between the couch cushions and slipped it into his pocket.
“See you,” She said, waving at Harry as she and Ron turned to hurry over to the welcoming pub, the lighted windows promising shelter from the bitter wind sweeping down the narrow streets.
“If you freeze to death, it won’t be a satisfying victory, so sure,” Malfoy grumbled, tossing them towards Harry before tugging on his dark grey peacoat.
“What happened to your Gryffindor honour?” Malfoy asked slyly. “Have you given up on nobility so easily?”
The Slytherins joined the tangled mass of Hogwarts students flooding out of the castle and across the grounds to the line of carriages that waited to take them all to the train station. It looked as though the majority of the student body would not be staying at school for the winter holidays and the air was filled with excited chatter, faces rosy from the cold and the excitement of the break.
“No worries.” Ron clapped him on the shoulder. “Looking forward to the Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff match this afternoon? I’ll be interested to see how Hufflepuff’s new Keeper does against the Ravenclaw Chasers.”
Draco opened his mouth, then faltered. It was those damn Gryffindors’ fault. Their soppy, casually affectionate ways were corrupting his typical Slytherin approach to this. But he pushed on. “I just want you to know that, I’ll miss you, Pans.”
She looked at him expectantly, and, for the first time in weeks, Draco finally felt some warmth creep through his veins, igniting something inside of him. He was sick of feeling this way; going through his days numbly because it hurt too much to feel. Pansy was right. He had to go talk to Harry and tell him how he felt. And at least if he clearly rejected him, then he’d know, and wouldn’t be sitting around wondering about the what-if of it all. He could be angry again.
Finally the elf unfolded the paper to see the knit beanie Harry had gotten at the bookstore. He wedged it over his large ears immediately, utterly delighted.
And sure enough, moments later, the portrait opened up from the wall and Potter stumbled out from behind it, emerald eyes wild.
Draco’s mouth formed an ‘o’of surprise. “How did you know? Who told you? Weasley? Granger? I mean, I would expect it of Weasley, I always knew it was a risk telling him, but I thought Hermione would at least-”
“I am capable of walking, Potter, honestly. No need to be such a fucking hero all of the time,” he snapped, followed by a pronounced sniff, before turning on his heel leaving Harry to trail behind him out of the Great Hall.
A few minutes after she, Crabbe, and Goyle had left the common room, he finally dared to come out, stomach churning with every step he took on the way to the Great Hall. In ten minutes, he would no longer be Harry Potter’s boyfriend. Not that he ever really had been, he thought bitterly.
Scared to look back at his friend, Harry kept his eyes trained on Draco while he softly nodded. A moment of silence dragged through the Charms classroom and he verbally added “Yes,” in case Ron had missed his first admission.
He heard footsteps coming down the stairs, giving him a forewarning of Malfoy’s arrival. In a split second, before he even had time to think about what he was doing, Harry Potter did something foolish: he pulled out his wand and created a sprig of magical mistletoe, fixing it to the arch of the dining room’s entryway, just having time to slid his wand back into his pocket as Malfoy entered the living room.
He glanced up from the piano, surprised by Harry’s apology, before focusing on the keys again, shrugging. “I’m sorry too. About the whole mess that got us there. The thing you said about me just following my parents blindly, you were right. I love them, but I now know I don’t want to
“Do you have any games?” Harry asked abruptly, turning back towards Malfoy, who arched an eyebrow. “Chess? Exploding Snap? Maybe some Muggle board game?”
“Thank Merlin, Potter!” He said exasperatedly. “I thought you’d never get here. I’ve been stuck under this damn thing for ten minutes! How long does it take you to finish a slice of pie?”
“Maybe,” Malfoy admitted. “He does like that sort of thing. He’s always asking me if I’ll put lights up on the outside of the house or get a Christmas tree.” He laughed slightly. “As if I actually enjoyed all this holiday frou-frou.”
Harry flushed, hesitating before saying, “No one actually ever read me stories out loud when I was a kid.”
He didn’t even have their former rivalry to depend on, their old spats seeming petty compared to what had been said in the Great Hall.
Harry just looked up at him with the biggest eyes he could muster, hoping Draco would take some pity on him and let him be for a moment. As it was Draco just smirked at him.
He looked around for a coffee machine. A shining Costa coffee machine sat in the corner of shop. Unfortunately, it was wrapped in yellow out of order tape.
They looked at each other for a few more seconds then heard another scream. Harry looked down at the unresponsive phone.
He grabbed hold of the bed frame to stop himself starting again. It was useless and he knew it. There was a crack and a full roast dinner appeared on the table in the corner with a glass of water. Harry’s stomach rumbled. He supposed there was no point in torturing himself further. He crossed the room in three paces and wolfed it down. Orgasms always made him ravenous. It was absolutely delicious. Probably the best he’d ever tasted next to Molly’s. He guessed they must have a new house elf in. Hermione would be so thrilled.
“Ron, you sit there and keep your mouth shut. Harry and I will ask the questions after Malfoy drinks that.”
Harry was digging his own grave though, he knew he couldn’t come. He was driving himself towards the edge when he knew he couldn’t go over it. Malfoy grinned as he saw him growl in frustration. A beautiful noise Harry often made during their time together. He put his head back and let himself feel the sheer pleasure of Harry’s tight arse on his cock; that and the sight of Harry above him was quickly undoing him. He knew he needed this as well, not that he’d ever tell Harry that.
He wished he had a witty retort, or a way to tell Malfoy to just piss off, but his brain seemed to have wandered off with one of the beers he’d drank.
“Mr Malfoy was raised in a Death Eater household, was merely 16 when he was given the Dark Mark. You can’t even get married in most countries at that age. He was, no doubt, coerced, given no other option that taking the mark, and carrying out his father’s wishes. He did however, despite all this grooming, not kill Dumbledore when he was tasked with it. Dumbledore knew it, before he died, his last words were: “You’re no killer Draco.” He saved my life in the Malfoy Manor, pretending not to rescue me and allowing me to escape. Draco Malfoy has been given the Dark Mark, and yes, he was coerced and bullied as many were into aiding the Death Eaters and failed to fight against them. But he has never killed, kidnapped or tortured anyone – wizard, muggleborn or muggle. He does not deserve a life time in Azkaban.”
Harry groaned at the loss but Malfoy grabbed him and shoved him back round with his face against the door. He grabbed his hair tight and pulled his head to the side, snarling in Harry’s ear as he reached his hand round and pumped his cock.
“It just feels hopeless. Fighting against an enemy so hateful and cruel they could do this to one of their own.”
“I’m enjoying watching you squirm to be honest.” He pushed hard on Draco’s prostate and watched him tremble.
Harry grunted in agreement and zipped up the tent. Malfoy had already lay down with the lamp by his head.
Potter licked him hard, dipping his tongue inside him and making Draco wonder just how sturdy the bars of the cell were as he clenched his fingers around them. His cock bobbed in front of it and Draco wondered how hard he’d have to plead for one of their audience to come and tend to it. He doubted they’d dare come and interfere with Potter’s show.
