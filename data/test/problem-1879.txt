“Malfoy and I have an essay to finish, so we’ll stay up here.” announced Potter, staring pointedly at Draco, who huffed and sat down.
There was a great swell of conversation as people said hurried, final goodbyes. Harry found himself being hugged tightly by Amelie, who was sniffling a little. He hugged her back.
“Alright. Harry.”
“Oh, I didn’t read that.” replied Harry. “Do we have to?”
“Yeah. We had lots of fun. Mrs. Weasley is the best cook I’ve ever known, and they all seemed to enjoy having me around, which was a right sight better than the Dursley’s.” he
(See the end of the chapter for
He’d never liked another boy before, but now that he thought about it...Harry liked Draco. He liked his sarcastic, witty remarks, his fancy way of talking. His random french phrases, how they sounded like song. How dramatic he was, how fun he was to talk to. How smart he was, how passionate he was about school subjects he loved, that he was as good a Seeker as Harry was. That he had never been someone to care that Harry was famous, but who saw him only as Harry. He challenged him and kept him on his toes. He was beautiful.
Harry was lying on top of Draco, the breath knocked from his body. He could feel Draco’s steady heartbeat under his chest, and hear his soft, shallow breaths. Harry pushed himself upright, his arms on either side of Draco, and they locked eyes. There was still something joyous and free in Draco’s grey eyes, and his blond hair was windswept and irresistibly messy. His lips were parted, and they were looking at each other, and before Harry knew what was happening he had leaned forward and kissed him.
“Missed me?” said Harry, poker-faced, and Draco scowled.
“You sound very unenthusiastic.”
“I have, actually. You.”
“Just be you.” Daphne kissed his cheek. “Good night.”
“We’ll see how this goes.” Draco smiled dryly.
“Why’s that?”
“It was,” she agreed, and they all laughed. Amelie coaxed the story out of Harry, which distracted him until they got to the primary school.
“That’s classic you, you know. Making your moment about someone else.” He nudged Draco with his shoulder. “And it doesn’t matter to me if you like guys or girls. You’re still one of my best friends.” Draco had his head turned away, but Harry saw his lips curve up into a smile.
Memories are rushing through his head, almost larger than life, like he’s seeing it in front of him. Most of them are recent, with Potter and Hermione, or Daphne and Pansy and Blaise. His friends. And older ones, with his mother. All the people he cares for. It’s a jumble of voices and laughter and the overall feeling of happiness. All of his darker memories are still there, but for the first time Draco not only saw those but sees his happiest moments, and knew that the dark was not the only presence in his life. You have something worth living for, whispered a melodious voice.
“I’ll go get you some Pepper-Up. Drink the tea, it’ll help.” ordered Draco, and Harry blinked at him before smiling bemusedly.
“Night Harry.”
“More than a little bit.”
“Wait a minute.” Camille said. “Harry- like Harry Potter?” Draco pressed his lips together, amused. So much for Harry’s anonymity.
“You wish.” he replied, and they lock eyes before chuckling.
Draco decided to leave the train as late as he can, so he can avoid the masses of students. When the train began to hiss steam he finally disembarked with his trunk, stepping onto the deserted cobblestones of the station. It’s dark out, and Draco can hear the sounds of crickets somewhere. He blew a breath out of his mouth, watching it steam in the frigid fall air, and his eyes looked to the silhouette of the castle.
“Greengrass, you don’t want to be associated with a Death Eater.” If he was being honest he did kind of want to get to know her. She seemed like the type of Slytherin he would enjoy hanging out with. But he didn’t want people to bully her as well as him.
“You?” replied Draco, glancing at him as they left, and Harry shrugged.
“Excellent job, you two.” said Professor Eagry from over Harry’s shoulder. “5 points to Slytherin and Gryffindor.” The two grin at each other as she moves on.
“Oh, I have your Potions notes.” said Harry, suddenly remembering. He pulls them out of his school bag into Draco’s waiting hand.
“Yeah, I know.” Weasley’s tone is a little less flat now. “Still root for them every year, though. The Falcons were great in last year’s season.”
“Why do you always have to interrupt?” he snapped at Harry, as Pansy’s mouth dropped open and Blaise blinked slowly.
“You still have some glitter.” he teased, and Draco huffed.
Draco rifled through his book to page 32. “Valerian root, fluxweed, shrivelfig, porcupine quills.” he muttered, then lifted his head. “Potter, go get-” he stopped at the sight of the other boy dumping the first few ingredients on their desk.
“Aren’t you going to put your broom away?” Draco asked.
“You cheated!” exclaimed Harry loudly, and Malfoy laughed again. It’s the first time Harry’s heard Malfoy laugh, really laugh, not from spite or making fun of someone. It’s...joyful, and Harry’s weirdly glad that Malfoy’s happy around him, glad that they’re past the old rivalry and have a chance to know one another.
“Yeah, we’ve talked about it. We’re just going to try to ignore it.” replied Harry, uncomfortably aware that maybe what Hermione was implying was right and they should have a better plan. Hermione frowned slightly.
“Why do I what?”
“Yeah, I’m looking forward to it. Just going to be weird without Ron and Hermione, though. But I’m doing the teacher program.”
“You smell good. Like mint.” Harry defended himself, blushing a little at being caught.
“Whatever,” muttered Draco. “Have either of you seen Potter?”
Harry tried to get out of bed, but as he stood up a rush of dizziness went to him head and he wobbled.
“Did you see anyone while you were there? Someone could have done it earlier. Anyone with access to the broomshed could’ve placed a curse on his broom,” he said reasonably.
“Alright. I told Amelie she could take the bathroom, but we’ll just do yours out here.” announced Camille, unpacking various things.
“Hey, doesn’t Theo live in France?” Pansy said, her grin suggestive. Draco coughed.
Ron laughed through his mouthful of potatoes, and Hermione shot Ron an exasperated look, which Harry snickered at. Sometimes Hermione was the girlfriend, sometimes she was the overbearing mother hen.
“D’you know where my glasses are?”
“So why’d you try to cover it up?” asked Harry, and Draco thought he could see anxiety building in Harry’s eyes, and exhaled.
Draco’s lips were ever so soft as they moved against Harry’s, and their tongues were touching, and dancing around each other, and Harry’s head was filled with a pleasant dizziness, and his skin tingled where Draco’s hands touched him, pulled him closer, wandering over his shoulders and his neck and through his hair. It was intoxicating, like a drug, and Harry wondered woozily why they hadn’t done this sooner, and sparks were flying like the stars had been earlier behind Harry’s closed eyes-
“Fucking….Finnegan.” Draco muttered through clumsy lips. His vision went black and he succumbed to unconsciousness.
Eventually he gave in and swabbed roughly at his eyes, then walked back out of the Owlery. It’s a beautiful day. The morning chill has dissolved, and the sun warmed his skin as he made his way down a small path. He didn’t know where he was going, but he would rather be out here than inside. Being outside calmed him. Things are simpler out here, thought Draco. Just the sun and the wind and the plants. He found a flat, eroded stone that jutted out into the lake. When he sat, it was pleasantly heated from the sun. Draco exhaled and closed his eyes.
“I can’t explain it to you right now, it’ll take too long.” he said, lounging in his seat with an easy grace. Harry frowned.
Draco sat back in his chair to ponder all this and there’s a pause. Granger watched him, and he can see in her eyes that she’s waiting for him to insult her, or Muggles. He would expect it of himself, honestly. But things have changed.
“Draco,” said Harry softly. “I know you didn’t want to tell me this before, but what was it you wouldn’t tell me about that day in the clearing, the day we went stargazing?” Draco stiffened a little bit, his head dropping back onto Harry’s shoulder. “You don’t have to tell me,” apologized Harry quietly, berating himself for prodding again. There was a heavy silence, but then to Harry’s slight surprise Draco replied.
“Yeah, me either. Unless you count ballroom dancing, but I don’t think waltzing is something you do at a club. I’m not very good at that, either.” said Draco. Harry laughed.
“I call dibs on showering first.” commented Harry as they trekked down their dorm hallway. “I’m bloody freezing. And you always take forever.”
“That’s an idea,” said Weasley thoughtfully.
Draco got up with a contented sigh and quietly got dressed before beginning to pack, keeping an eye on the sleeping Harry across the room. About ten minutes later he was done, except for one sweater that he couldn’t pack yet because Harry was wearing it. He didn’t mind, though, he found it amusing that Harry had his own sweater now, one exactly like Draco’s, but still insisted on wearing Draco’s.
“Not in public, Harry,” he teased, and Harry grinned at the familiar scolding.
“I...guess so. I just remembered you didn’t know before, and it was kind of sprung on you.” said Draco, scuffing his shoes against the cobblestone. Harry smiled, shaking his head.
“I come down here a lot at night,” he says, and something in his tone is more open, less guarded. Like Harry passed a test when he made the choice to follow him down to the lake.
“We’re not married, Hermione, calm down.” he reprimanded, but it went right over her head, Harry could tell.
“Yeah. It should be a good experience, though.” he answered vaguely, trying to remember which stir he was on.
“When you say she’ll have words with me,” said Harry. “Why do I get the impression that’s a very tame version of what she actually means?” Draco chuckled.
“Is there some sort of spell that lets you speak seamless foreign language?” asked Pansy. “I feel like I’ve heard of something like that.”
“What, the snow?”
“Outside?”
He fell into step with her and they walked up to the classroom, chatting about superficial things like the weather, the ball, Christmas. Harry wasn’t really listening, though.
“Just trust me!”
“Yeah, that’s good. I’ll send it off this weekend.” Harry replied, and Draco rolled his eyes, flopping back onto his bed.
“It’s alright. You were very kind.” she replied. Draco couldn’t help but smile back. Luna began chatting to him, walking amongst the thestrals and introducing them to Draco, who trailed after her, the Marauder’s Map in his robes. Luna gave him a piece of meat, and the two of them fed the thestrals for a while, Draco listening placidly as she told him about Nargles and Crumple-Headed Snorkacks.
“No.” shot back Draco snidely. “I will not.” Harry laughed. “Prat.” Draco added.
“You’re welcome,” said Harry placidly, picking up and biting into a croissant. Draco narrowed his eyes and huffed but shoved him over and sat down next to him, plucking the pastry from his fingers and eating it himself.
Draco stood up and left, walking quickly to the stairs that lead to his dorm. He ignored Daphne calling his name and the curious stares from the other eighth years, and entered the dorm, slamming the door behind him. He flopped onto his bed and stared at the ceiling, thoughts rushing through his head like a waterfall. He’s so furious with himself, and with the two girls downstairs.
“You make him sound like he’s a cat, or something.”
“Hey,” replied Harry.
“Yeah?” asked Harry, a smile beginning to curve his lips.
To everyone reading my fic, thank you! I hope you like it! These chapters will jump back and forth between Harry's POV and Draco's, and a TW for this chapter, there is a brief mention of self-harm.  Note: I did fix the spacing on the whole fic.
Harry’s heart stopped again, as did his breathing. The whole world paused, and shifted as Harry took in what she’d said, emotion rising like a cresting wave within him.
“I did it,” he repeated, still sounding awed.
“Yeah, then I can beat Potter’s ass.” Draco announced, fixing the Gryffindor with a challenging stare, which he returned in full.
“Everyone loves food, Potty. And I am not like Weasley,” he sniffed, selecting a pastry.
“Alright.” he finally said cautiously, eyeing Harry like he thought he would announce it as a joke, and they pick up their bags and walk out of the classroom. Harry saw Daphne watching them leave, and she smiled a little when he met her eyes.
“Harry?” He sat up.
The next morning, Draco awoke to Harry’s prodding his shoulder and he smiled sleepily. They went down to the breakfast l, where an owl landed gracefully in front of them, a letter clutched in its beak.
But Theo was in France now, and that was one less friendly face at school. Draco’s carriage rolled to a stop and he pushed open the door and stepped out, moving quickly so he won’t have to deal with the three Gryffindors in the carriage behind him. He strode up the steps, following the trickle of students still making their way to the Great Hall, and set down his trunk with everyone else’s luggage.
“You passed out.” Draco flushed from embarrassment, but Harry kept talking. “I think you were too tired to provide all the energy the spell needed. But you were really close, your Patronus almost formed, I saw it coming together.” he finished.
“Very astute of you to notice, Potty.”
Harry and Amelie went down to the dining hall for lunch twenty minutes later. Harry could see Camille, Simon, Draco, and Daphne all sitting nearby, and he and Amelie strolled
“So-Patronuses.” began Harry briskly. “You know the movement, the incantation. Try a different memory. Search for the strongest one you have. It doesn’t even have to be happy, really, it just has to have strong positive emotions. Tell me when you have one.”
He’s gotten closer with the three Beauxbatons students, and Harry as well. Some nights they stay up late, talking to each other in the dark, laughing over shared memories. Every day Draco fell a little more in love with Harry. With his smile, his bright eyes, his funny comments, his enthusiasm. Every brush of their hands or shoulders is like a warm spark, and Draco has found himself always making excuses to sit next to him, talk to him, make him smile, laugh.
Harry wasn’t worried for Malfoy, he knew the other boy was capable of looking after himself. Harry was just a little confused, and curious as to where he disappeared to and why.
“Luna likes to visit the thestrals, there’s a clearing where they congregate. She feeds them and pets them and stuff.” explained Harry. “I went with her once in fifth year.”
“Yes, for the annual Crystal Ball. It’s wonderful,” sighed Amelie. “Ice sculptures everywhere, like huge diamonds. It’s a winter wonderland.” Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Hey, Draco. Can we talk?”
“Alright, then. Well, I think I’ll go up to bed now,” she announced, giving Ron a quick kiss. “And the both of you are still coming to my study group tomorrow. I am not letting you slack off on homework this year.”
“You should come with us, all of you this Wednesday,” invited Amelie. Harry nodded agreement.
“Well. That was unexpected.” stated Hermione flatly, and Harry laughed.
“And you can call me Daphne, you know. You boys are weird when you call everyone by their last name.”
Draco’s eyes fluttered open. White ceiling, high-set windows lit with afternoon sunshine, the smoky smell of Healing Potion, the low murmur of voices...the Hospital Wing.
“None of your business. And stop looking at me like that, Potter!” he exclaimed. Their eyes kept meeting and Potter had a gleam in his green eyes like he’s trying to figure Draco out. It made him uncomfortable.
“Wait a minute. That’s impossible. Muggles can’t go up in space!” Draco exclaimed incredulously.
His heart was beating furiously inside of his chest, and only those words repeated in his brain. Over and over.
“They can fly! In metal birds!” he exclaimed to Daphne later, as they walk back to the common room. She smiled.
“Yeah, Potter’s a decent flyer,” replied Draco nonchalantly. He tossed the Snitch back over to Potter, who snatched it before it can fly away again.
“Merlin,” muttered Draco once the door was closed behind them. “I thought they’d never stop asking all those damn questions.” Harry snorted.
“What? I’m hungry!”
“Wait,” he said suddenly as a thought struck him. “So if one of us dies-”
If Draco wanted to be alone, or not talked to, Harry would respect that, for the moment. But he still wanted to know what was up with him. Harry sighed, and downed his own Firewhisky, coughing a little at the burn in his throat. So far tonight wasn’t as he’d expected.
“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning. “You must be in a good mood, giving me compliments.”
“Draco! Are you alright?” came a loud voice, and he groggily opened his eyes to see Daphne leaning over him. His head throbbed, and he groaned at a wave of pain.
“Exactly!” agreed Draco, and Harry made an offended noise.
“What about- your father?” Harry questioned tentatively.
“And I’ll help you, Harry.” Amelie nodded decisively. “You would look amazing in contacts and eyeliner.” Now it was Harry’s turn to blink in surprise, and Daphne clapped her hands.
“So how do the programs work with the schedules?” whispered Draco to Simon, as more students filed into the bright classroom.
“Peeves,” said Harry by way of explanation, sitting down and serving himself a slice of steak and kidney pie.
So much for his Gryffindor bravery. More like bravado.
“Oh,” he said, uncomfortably aware that he had promised Draco not to tell Hermione. “They said they’d help us and Ron- well- guard Draco,” he told her in an undertone. It was the truth. Just not all of it.
“Not at this second,” said Harry, an amused expression on his face. “Give me a second and we can go check the Map.” Draco nodded, and followed him up to their dorm, where Harry set down his school bag and tossed the blank piece of parchment to Draco. He rested the point of his wand against the parchment.
He opened the window and allowed the owl to hop inside, where he gently tugged the letter from it’s beak. The envelope was of decent quality, creamy white paper addressed simply to Draco Malfoy, Beauxbatons. The handwriting looked vaguely familiar, but Draco couldn’t place it. Ah, well. Might as well open it. His writing hand was beginning to ache, anyways. Draco tossed a curious look at the owl, which was still hanging around. Usually they flew off as soon as the letter was delivered. Maybe he wanted a reply.
Draco’s quiet as they pack up and leave for the common room.
“Good night.” Draco took a deep breath as she went into her own dorm room. Another breath. Fuck. He opened the door and stepped inside.
“But- Harry, the things I’ve done, I don’t deserve you, I don’t deserve this, I shouldn’t be happy, I’m a horrible person-”
Harry pulled himself into a sitting position, bracing his hand against the warm stone floor. His elbow ached where it had hit the ground when Malfoy had pushed him off. The room is still wreathed with tendrils of smoke, and he can hear people coughing. Malfoy’s sitting with his head between his knees a foot or two away, his back to Harry, whose head is still spinning. When the explosion first went off, he’d fallen over. When Harry had tried to get back up, he’d tripped over something and fallen on Malfoy.
“...password is Aurea Anthos.” The portrait of a red dragon twisting gracefully against a sunset swung open and the eighth years began to file inside. Once everyone had entered and he was alone, Draco closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. He really needed a break if he was apologizing to Potter, of all people. If he and Potter weren’t insulting and jibing at each other, Draco really didn’t know what to do around him.
“Oh, please, stop lying-”
“I couldn’t tell you then.” he said, in a whisper so quiet Harry had to strain to hear it. “But- I think I can now.” Harry gave him as much time as he needed, and after another pause Draco continued. He drew up his left sleeve, gazing at the vivid phoenix tattoo. “I was going to- to…to off myself.” he said, voice trembling, and a wave of realization washed over Harry. He kissed Draco’s neck, trying to comfort him, as he was shaking slightly in Harry’s arms.
“Why?” asked Harry teasingly. “Need my help?” Draco takes a few more steps across the ice, his confidence growing as he goes.
“I see the way you look at him,” she said knowingly, and Harry was strongly reminded of Hermione, confronting him about Ginny. The words were the same. “And,” Daphne went on slowly, “the way he looks at you.”
Draco smiled. That was good, she’d had company for Christmas. He was glad she and her sister were reconciled. He could probably sneak away on a weekend and visit her, McGonagall was pretty lax about the eighth years. Although he wasn’t just any eighth year, technically he was still on probation, but that didn’t mean much at the moment.
“You’re welcome, Potter.”
“We found Theo, here isn’t that crazy?” exclaimed Daphne, exchanging a smile with the boy, who Harry now recognized as Theodore Nott, who’d moved to France after the war.
Potter came back with the rest of the ingredients and set them on the table. A little jar started to roll and Draco yelped and lunged for it.
Harry stumbled as they went down the steps, knocking his knee into the stone wall, and Draco felt the hard bang and the resulting throb on his own knee.
Draco gave him a withering look. “No. You’re too clumsy.”
Hey everyone! TW, brief mention of self-harm.
“Damn, sorry!” Potter’s sprawled across Draco’s body, his face inches from Draco’s. Wide grey eyes stare into vibrant green ones. Potter had nice eyes, thinks Draco woozily. He can’t seem to stop looking into them. Draco can feel the other boy’s warm palms on his shirt, from where he tried to brace his fall. Can feel every bit of Potter’s body pressed against his, can feel Potter’s heart beating erratically near his, can feel Potter’s warm breath on the shell of his ear-
“She was pretty good. She partnered me with Malfoy and Harry with that Greengrass girl for an exercise, but it wasn’t as bad as expected.” Hermione spooned peas onto her plate.
“What?” asked Harry curiously, glancing at Draco, who was staring at the floor, his cheeks flushed.
“They detained Johnson- the Ravenclaw boy- and found out the spell he’d used. It was an old curse, with no clear countercurse. And he was also the one who’d cursed Draco’s broom, Daphne told me about that incident. Apparently Johnson said his parents were murdered by Death Eaters. He’s kind of mad with grief, and that’s why he did it.” said Hermione with a slightly ill expression.
“Your hands are fucking freezing, Draco, damn.” complained Harry. He laced both of his hands with both of Draco’s, under the unspoken pretense of warming them up but also just to hold his hands, since Draco rarely let him do that. Especially in public.
“You say that like it’s a good thing.” he replied. “Everyone needs at least three good Slytherins in their life.”
here will take me, no matter what career I choose.”
“I don’t know if anything like that has ever happened to me in the romance department, thankfully,” said Daphne while she pours herself coffee. The Great Hall is almost entirely empty, dotted here and there with a few early risers, but their table is completely deserted apart from them.
“Tell Hermione I’ll help as well,” said Daphne, glancing at Pansy and Blaise.
Everyone else was out enjoying the last of the warm days, before fall remembers it’s supposed to be cold. Draco didn’t mind the lack of people, in fact he prefers it. Less hostile faces to keep track of.
The next day Harry goes to Transfiguration, accompanied by Ron, who’s deep in a monologue on this year’s Quidditch Cup.
“Hermione’s brilliant at those,” said Harry, smiling at the memory of her little beaded bag that she’d used when they were on the run in seventh year. “She used it on this little bag
“Not really, no. Although I’m not about to go trumpeting that, all the Prophet readers would mug me. I wish they’d remember I’m a person, not an idol.”
Harry caught Daphne’s eye, and he saw his own slight worry reflected in her gaze.
Draco explored his memories, speeding past all the negative ones, examining each good memory with a critical eye. What he’d been choosing before obviously hadn’t been strong enough. Draco thought he could tell why; the happy feeling he’d had had always been interlaced with some stress or worry- even when he’d been stargazing with his mother when he was younger, he’d been worried that his father would get mad at him for ruining his clothes.
“He said Harry was decent, but then he changed his mind and said he was great at it,” Amelie revealed, obviously enjoying herself, and Daphne cackled. Now it was Harry’s turn to blush. Even as some part of him was smugly satisfied at Draco’s words.
More students trickled in, and the Professor strode in gracefully and stood in front of her mahogany desk. The class gradually filled, a mix of eighth and seventh year students, and just before the bell rang Potter and Granger came in and sat at the desk next to Draco. Oh joy, he thought moodily, fiddling with his eagle-feather quill.
“Hey,” greeted Draco once Harry reached the eighth year table. “What’s going on outside?” His gaze was fixed curiously on a couple of Hufflepuffs, who had ink running down their hair.
Harry had never wanted to kiss him so badly. Kiss anyone that badly. It had been a struggle to keep those feelings from showing, and even then Harry wasn’t sure he’d accomplished it. He just wished he could tell if Draco liked him back. But Harry had always been rubbish at reading other people like that. Draco was better at that sort of thing.
kissing, the sensations that made his brain go fuzzy.
Draco grimaced, feeling a little guilty. “Sorry I dragged you outside for so long.”
“I can’t believe it’s almost Christmas,” Harry said, changing the subject. I wonder what he got me…
“I mean, yeah. I want to date you. Be with you. If that’s what you want.” replied Harry, some slight uncertainty in his voice, and Draco smiled at him.
“Yeah, I think I will.” whispered Harry. “You?” Amelie smiled at him, brushing her dark hair out of her eyes.
There was an immense whooshing noise and the silvery, transparent light swirled together, combining to form a spectral, silver winged horse, reiring back in the air, hooves flying. It’s huge, bigger than my stag, Harry thought in awe, watching it gallop in the air, mane flying in the wind before it faded away.
“No…” Harry let out a slight sob and Draco shook his shoulder gently.
“They can, Malfoy. Astronauts- that’s what the people that go up in space are called- go up in huge rockets. People have walked on the moon. There’s an American flag on the moon now. And Muggles have also sent out spacecraft that they control from Earth to explore things farther away, like Jupiter.”
“Alright. Close your eyes.” she said quietly, and Draco obliged, feeling the light sensation of the eyeliner pen. “You like him, don’t you?” continued Daphne in a whisper, and Draco opened his other eye to look at her. Fuck, she had noticed.
Draco thought that January had gone by entirely too quickly; it was the dawn of their last day at Beauxbatons, and he could barely wrap his mind around that. Lying in his bed, with the chilly morning breeze from the window streaming into the room, it seemed like any other day that they’d had, no different.
“We’ll be back just in time for lunch,” commented Amelie. “Thankfully. I need to talk to Draco about something.” Harry blinked, all the thoughts of the Slytherin swarming back into his head, and he cursed silently. They would be back at Beauxbatons soon, he needed to be normal.
“I think that’s Ron and Hermione,” Draco said with amusement. Harry squinted, and he could make out a lanky, red-headed boy in a maroon sweater being chased by a brown-haired girl in a knitted hat, weaving in and out of the other eighth years. Harry chuckled, and they began walking towards them, feet slipping on the snow.
Daphne grinned at him and laced her arm through his as they start walking across the common room.
Harry sighed, resigned to not buying anything for the Slytherin today. Maybe he could come back next weekend, or after dinner sometime. Harry looked around for Draco and found him walking away from the countertop, a new bag weighing down his arms. There was a satisfied gleam in his eyes.
Draco bit his lip absentmindedly, a little amused that Harry sounded like Hermione and his mother, but also touched that the other boy had cared enough to notice. Not that he was doing it for Harry’s attention, but it was nice when people fussed sometimes. Draco would never tell anyone that, though. They’d think he’d gone round the twist. He was starting to agree with that sentiment.
“Yeah. When she used the Porskoff’s Ploy, she was just unstoppable.”
“We have a magical hat called the Sorting Hat, and every year each first year puts on the hat, and it kind of magically digs around in your brain- not literally- but it senses your dominant traits and puts you in the House that matches. I’m in Gryffindor, it’s known for bravery, courage, chivalry, things like that.”
“Wait and see, nosy.” She huffed and Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry grinned. “Bye.” he said, and rushed out of the dorm.
“Pumpkin, cinnamon, and old books.” she responded. “Unfortunately no one I know smells like any of those, though I’m not sure I’d be attracted to anyone smelling of pumpkin.”
“You should do the Healer program with me!” Daphne said with a gleam in her blue eyes. Draco laughed. “No, really. I think you’d be good at it. You care about people more than you let show.”
“Sure, we’ll have tea,” agreed Ron, and Hagrid lead them inside. Harry’s instantly comforted by the familiar, cozy surroundings. Hagrid set down three huge mugs and a tea kettle
“Do you really want to do all that, Hermione?” asked Ron, a bemused expression on his face.
“Bye,” replied Harry. “Oh, hey- Patronus practice later?” Draco chewed on his lip absentmindedly. He wanted to spend time with Harry, of course, but the Patronus thing was so frustrating. Not to mention it made him tired.
“How did you do that? Counter the effects?” she asked, and Draco immediately began explaining to her, seemingly glad to get away from the previous topic. Harry glanced at Daphne, and saw that she was looking at him, too.
He made his way to the third floor corridor, cautiously peeking into the room where he’d found Malfoy previously, but it was empty. Figured.
“One last day of decent coffee,” sighed Draco, and Harry grinned.
Draco’s determined to win this Seeker’s game. Potter’s bested him in actual Quidditch games so many times, but he’s confident that he can beat him now. Draco’s flying even with Potter; neither of them can pull ahead of the other. But all of a sudden the Snitch turned to the right, and Draco’s closest, and he made a swipe for the tiny thing and felt his fingers close around the buzzing Snitch. He yelled in triumph and directed his broom upwards, away from the ground, and Potter followed him.
Ron snorted. “Still getting fan mail?” Harry nodded unenthusiastically as Hermione giggled.
“A Study of Elemental Transfiguration,” mused Harry, picking up a book. “I think she’d like- oh wait no, she already has this one.” Draco sniggered, smug that he already had a book picked out, as well as a distiller for Potions that Hermione was always eyeing in the post.
“Bye,” said Draco, tugging Harry down into a kiss.
“Weasley, I’m sorry for insulting you and your family. And any role I might’ve… might’ve played in your brother’s death.” Malfoy said in a rush, and Harry saw that his hands are clenched so tightly together that they’re turning a deathly white. Ron said nothing, but his face tightened- but from grief or anger Harry can’t tell. Finally Malfoy turned to Harry.
Ron snorted into his tea, and glanced at Harry with amusement. The last time Hagrid had wanted a lady friend for one of his charges, it had been for Grawp.
Horror was prickling his skin, not because of it, but because Draco had felt so bad that he’d- he’d tried to do that. Harry hated the idea of Draco being so miserable. He also hated the idea of a world without him. Could not imagine it, nor wanted to.
Harry’s voice sounded far away, as if they were standing at opposite ends of the Black Lake. Draco’s vision came slowly into focus, the blurred shapes and colors sharpening until he could make out Harry’s face above him. He was lying on the ground. Draco blinked up at Harry, confused.
Twenty five minutes later Draco strolled out of the bathroom, toweling his hair. He’d made sure his robes were impeccable, because he’d found a long time ago that a perfect outfit helped his confidence. And he needed all the help he could get, with Harry nearby all the time. It was maddening.
“No more running away today, alright?” she teased, and Draco stiffened a bit but nodded. He saw her note his reaction and her eyebrows furrow the smallest bit.
“So I take it the stargazing went well?” said Daphne, standing in front of them. Harry could see Camille and Amelie hot on her trail, getting closer to them. Draco’s mouth opened slightly.
Harry glanced back at Draco, who was staring at the place where his Patronus had been with an expression of wonder. Harry jogged over to him, an exuberant grin on his face.
At the end of class they were the last ones to leave, and Draco pointedly ignored all the nasty looks people gave him as they passed while he packed up. It was the last class of the day, so Harry and Draco headed back to the common room. The shoulder strap of his school bag dug into his shoulder as they walked through the stone hallways.
“And he agreed to it?” asked Hermione curiously.
Especially since this was Draco, Harry knew how much it took for him to say something like that. Or to trust Harry, and follow his lead on how to deal with the people at Hogwarts.
“Dorm buddies?” asked Harry, and Draco glanced at him, his eyes slightly hesitant.
“Hey, Buckbeak.” Hagrid boomed, tossing a dead ferret into the air. Buckbeak snapped it up and Harry’s eyes travel over the sharp yellow eyes, the blue-grey feathers, the clawed feet. He remembered the wonderful free sensation of flying astride Buckbeak and grinned.
“Are you sure it’s supposed to look all crooked and wonky like that?”
“No difference?” asked Ron quietly.
“Good job, Harry,” said Hagrid, patting him on the head. Harry’s knees buckle and he stumbled. “Sorry ‘bout that,” apologized Hagrid, and Harry laughed.
“Go on,” Draco told the owl. “Shoo. If I need to reply I’ll send it with another owl.” The owl blinked it’s large yellow eyes at him, hooting dutifully, and only flew off when Draco
“Sometimes…” Malfoy began- no, Draco, thought Harry. It seemed wrong to call him Malfoy now, because Malfoy was the boy from the past. Draco.. Draco was the boy in front of him. Still the same, but changed in irrevocable ways. Both of them were.
“As you all know what an Animagus is, I don’t need to explain it. But there will be an extracurricular after classes every Wednesday for those who would like to try for their Animagus form. If you reach it, however, just remember it’s the law that you must register. The group will be held in this classroom. Now…”
“Why am I in the hospital wing?” he asked, and she handed him the cup.
Draco’s breathing was slowing down, and Harry prodded him gently.
“Bloody wonderful,” he muttered under his breath.
“That was a good first try,” exclaimed Harry, striding over.
Harry cracked a grin, coming to lay next to him. “Yeah,” he agreed. He tugged Draco back against him gently, so he was curled around Draco. Draco sighed contentedly. He would never admit it out loud, but he did really enjoy the times when he could just lay with Harry, when they could hold each other. It made him feel calm, safe, like they were in their own little bubble. It was nice to feel like that for once.
“Sorry. Professor Athme also said we’ll be finishing a batch of Amortentia next class.”
Harry fidgeted in his seat in Potions. Professor Athme’s speaking, but Harry couldn't concentrate on that, only the empty seat next to him. Malfoy’s empty seat. During lunch he’d received a note, a piece of paper folded meticulously into a little dragon that had floated down next to his plate. He’d opened it, and Malfoy’s elegant writing had popped out at him.
“Donc, très magique alors?” Draco replied. So, very magical then?Harry snorted, and the girl laughed in delight.
“Fuck off, Malfoy. You should be in jail with your dear old dad.” Draco inhaled, trying to keep his calm. Some part of him agreed with the Gryffindor, a shadow lurking over his shoulder that he’d been so desperately trying to keep at bay all summer.
“I’ll try, at least. And if that doesn’t work out I can always help George with the joke shop.”
Draco’s in a fiery kiss that took his breath away and wiped all coherent thoughts from his head, heat pooling in his core.
“When I first learned in third year, it took me a lot of time. I kept passing out.” said Harry, trying to console the other boy. He was rewarded with a small smile.
Draco thanked her and she left to tend to someone else. Why had Potter brought him in? He frowned as he swung his legs off the bed. Maybe he’d ask Daphne later. It’s not like he could ask Potter, or wanted to, but he was still curious.
“No, I didn’t see anyone,” said Harry, feeling distinctly foolish for asking for their help with so little to go on. “No sign of any spells, either. No flashes of light, no noises.”
“I have this damn eyeshadow all over my hands.” Draco said, letting out a laugh. Or a sob. Harry couldn’t tell. But he chuckled, knowing that was Draco’s way of asking if things were alright between them.
“Us too,” offered Blaise, and Harry blinked in surprise.
“Whatever, Dragon Malfoy.”
“..Ron, just talk to him?”
“But we just got back,” protested Draco in a tone that sounded suspiciously like a whine, and Harry snickered.
“I’m not having a last hurrah hookup, Theo.” Draco said firmly. “I don’t like you like that anymore.” He walked back to the main room without waiting for Theo’s reply.
“We aren’t together anymore,” Harry replied, having anticipated the question. “We owled a bit over the summer, and we both realized that we didn’t really like each other that
“Oh?” replied Harry, not really knowing what to say. He hadn’t seen Narcissa Malfoy since the trials last summer. She’d been very kind to him, and he’d thanked her for what she had done.
“Do you play piano?” Harry asks suddenly. Malfoy frowns slightly.
“Yeah, I like it a lot.” replied the blond.
“It’s great.” replied Harry firmly, and Draco grinned almost shyly, not meeting Harry’s eyes. They stayed up and talked a little while longer, about their trip tomorrow, before finally going to sleep, and Harry’s final thought before drifting off was of the fiery tattoo, and how glad he was that Draco could cover something he despised with something he loved.
“Really,” he said to himself with some disgust, “Why on earth would I want to talk to him again? Does he really expect me to agree?” He shook his head in disbelief. “I suppose if I don’t reply he’ll come barging up to the school like a prat.”
“Actually, I wanted him to join us.” Daphne announced, and both Granger and Draco glare at her.
“Seamus started mouthing off at Malfoy and Malfoy was trying to leave, I think, but then Seamus...well, you saw the rest of it.” Dean told Harry.
“Sorry. I just…”
“Whatever. You’re telling me later. Daphne’s been very worried about you, you know.” replied Harry, sitting down next to Malfoy, who sighed, seemingly resigned to Harry’s presence.
“No, really.” Harry gave it to her and she pulled it on.
“See you,” repeated Draco, now immersed in his book. Harry sighed, half-exasperated and half-amused, before heading down to the common room with his school things.
Harry blinked. Nott...so Draco was gay? Or bi? He hadn’t known that. He’d always thought Draco was straight, because he’d dated Pansy. But he obviously wasn’t an expert on Draco’s love life.
“Hey, Harry,” greeted Daphne, smiling at him.
Harry heard the door creak open and close from where he was lying on his bed, and Draco’s shadowy figure came into the dark room. All the lights were off. He heard Draco’s bed squeak slightly as the blond sat down, and saw the moonlight shine off of the glitter on his skin, his hair.
“Did you know that there are five different variations of the Chinese Fireball dragon?” said Hermione suddenly, and Draco scoffed.
“It’s going to be fun, and you will show up. Knowing the two of you, you’d probably try to skip it,” she declared. “And you have to wear nice clothes, Harry.” Camille eyed him sternly, and Draco snickered.
“That’s- really interesting, actually.” he announced, and Granger smiled slightly.
“Morning.” he replied, wrinkling his nose as Harry leaned in to kiss in. “Harry, I haven’t brushed my teeth, don’t kiss me yet.” he complained weakly, but his hands were reaching forward of their own instinct and threading with Harry’s hair. Damn. When I’m around him, I just lose every bit of self control. It’s insane.
sure, practice.” Draco continued, a note of sarcasm in his voice. “Maybe that’ll be my extra Christmas present, getting my Patronus.”
“...Alright.” he agreed. Soft whooshing sounds came from in front of them as one by one, students stepped into the fireplace and Floo’d.
“Don’t tell Hermione about this,” insisted Draco, and though Harry wanted to protest he just nodded. Again, this was something to talk about later. It all tied back into the thing that Draco refused to address. Harry sighed.
Draco closed his eyes, trying to go to sleep, but it was in vain. He sighed again, angry with himself for stressing about this so much.
Draco was supremely grateful that Harry Potter had entered his life again. Because he brought out the best in Draco now, understood him, accepted him. Was one of the very best friends Draco had ever had. As was just as good a boyfriend as he was a friend.
“Write about the Patronus practice we’ve been doing?” offered Harry, raking a hand through his hair. Draco grimaced.
“What happened? Why have you been out here all day?” Harry asked as Malfoy sat down awkwardly.
The Gryffindor’s shampoo was vanilla-scented, and every now and then Draco got a faint whiff when they hung out. Treacle tart, well, Harry adored the blasted sugary thing, and played Quidditch.
Spending the day like this with all of his friends made him glad for his newfound friendship with the three people he’d abhorred for so long, as well as those he’d known for a longer time. He’d had found himself enjoying his time with the other three, as weird as it was for all of them at times.
and stored all her books in there.” Draco snorted.
“Is that the Slytherin way to greet someone?” he asked. “I would not have survived that.”
“If you want I can try to show you a video.”
“Because I knew you would act like this,” said Draco placatingly, approaching Harry, who huffed derisively.
“It’ll be dark soon, and our room is kind of far. Maybe skip the coats for one night.” replied Harry regretfully. It was getting colder every day, although there had been no sign of snow yet. Draco frowned.
“Maybe I was. A little bit.” he admitted.
“I’m fucking dandy.” replied Draco, and Harry raised his eyebrows slightly. So it was one of those nights where Draco was prickly. Brilliant.
“Is it good?” he asked. “The potion?” Malfoy tilted his head.
“Where do you want to go?” asked Harry.
“Once we’re in the dorm, yeah.”
McGonagall sighed. “Thank you Mr. Potter, Ms. Greengrass. When Mr. Malfoy is situated with Madam Pomfrey please return to the common room.” They murmured assent and the Headmistress entered the common room. Harry caught Hermione’s sleeve as she turned to follow McGonagall.
“But I can’t think of anything,” protested a frazzled Weasley, gazing at him beseechingly. Draco sighed. Weasley wouldn’t leave him alone until Draco helped him, probably, so he had to give him something.
“Yeah, I never learned healing spells.” Harry agreed. “Can you even walk?”
“Draco, get up, you’ll be late.” came Harry’s voice. “They said breakfast is in ten minutes.”
“You really hated that, didn’t you?” Draco replied, smirking. Harry shook his head with a sigh and they turned a corner towards the ballroom, the faint sounds of music beginning to reach Harry’s ears.
Harry had said goodbye to some people the day before, in classes. People like Charlotte, who had always been friendly to him in the classes they shared, and Wyatt, who’d partnered with him on a particularly difficult project for Charms. It had made him a bit sad. He always hated saying goodbye to people.
“Go up early, then.” answered Hermione with a small smile. “I want to work on my knitting, anyway.”
“Now who’s the one with a philosophical look on his face?” teased Draco, and Harry swept his meandering thoughts aside.
“Reading. I know it’s a foreign concept to you Gryffindors- oops, sorry, was that too complicated a word-”
“Now, your things have already been brought down and sent off, and you will be traveling by Floo…”
“Well,” said Harry conversationally. “I’m dating someone now.” Ron goggled at him.
After Harry and McGonagall had Apparated, Draco had quickly Floo’d to follow everyone else, and now he stood in a courtyard, surrounded by lush, delicate gardens. Fountains dotted the landscape, elegantly sculpted out of white marble. Neatly trimmed, low hedges bordered the gardens. Late sunlight glinted off of a lake beyond the gardens, and distant picturesque mountains completed the gorgeous painting.
“Better?”
Draco doesn’t, though. He and Potter might be tentative friends-honestly, tentative acquaintances- but they’re not that close that Draco can stick his wand in Potter’s face and cast a spell on him.
Transfiguration went relatively quickly; they practiced advanced human transfiguration, turning your arms into brooms, for one. Harry didn’t quite manage but all together he wasn’t that bothered (who needed brooms as arms anyway?) and had a cheerful lunch with Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Dean, who struck up a conversation about muggle soccer with Harry, while Ron and Neville looked on bemusedly.
“Sorry,” said Potter. “Can I do anything?”
“Yeah,” answered Draco, slightly breathless, but no one except him will ever know it’s from Potter and not the Seeker’s game. Another broom rose from the ground, and with his night vision still in use Draco could see Weasley with his arms wrapped around Hermione on the broomstick.
“Potter, I am not going ice skating with you, you pretentious prat!” exclaimed Draco, casting an apprehensive look at the pair of white skates dangling from Harry’s fingers.
“Seconded.” Draco added, and Camille rolled her eyes at them.
“...so eight of you will be taking the Floo Network back to Hogwarts,” Madam Maxime was saying in her heavily accented English. “Minerva has informed me that two of you will be Apparating together back to the castle in lieu of the Floo Network, Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter.” she finished, and Harry exchanged a surprised, but relieved look with Draco.
“No, because we have students from other places like Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, and more, so we offer a French language class but we all speak English in classes, since that’s what most people know.” replied Simon with a smile.
“I can’t believe it worked,” replied the blond, smiling self-consciously.
Draco’s fingers brush against Harry’s. His breath catches.
This time Draco treated Harry to the same thing he’d done; he licked and kissed his way down Harry’s neck, his hands trailing down Harry’s arms. Harry tilted his head back, his own hands on Draco’s hips. When Harry sighed, Draco could feel the vibrations, and that alone was enough to curl his toes.
“Probably not,” agreed Draco conversationally, and when Harry pouted he gave him a quick kiss. “You do have nice eyes, though. Distinctly un-toad like. Very green.”
“So you were jealous of her?” teased Hermione, and Draco glared at her.
“Yeah.” he replied faintly.
He walked out of the bathroom, finally dressed, to find Harry sitting in the armchair with two cups of coffee sitting on one of the bedside tables. Harry held out a hand and when Draco took it, pulled him down next to him on the armchair. It was not made for two people, and Draco’s legs were over Harry’s thighs while their shoulders pressed together. But it worked. They worked. And that blew Draco’s mind.
“Hell yeah.” enthused Amelie. “Riley’s?” she continued, and Camille and Simon agreed eagerly.
“That sounds neat. I’ve always wondered what my Animagus form would be,” Draco mused.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” replied Granger, none too delicately.
“Here we go,” sighed the Gryffindor, letting Amelie lead him into the bathroom. Draco snickered. “Oh shut up, Draco.” came Harry’s voice, but Draco heard the laugh in his voice.
He ran his fingers over the vivid colors inked over his scar. The phoenix tattoo. He thought of it as a symbol. A symbol of how he’d changed, a symbol of hope. Of better things. Just like how Dumbledore’s phoenix, that day in the clearing, had reminded him that just because there was dark in the world didn’t mean it blotted out the light as well.
He’d passed his Defense winter exams with good marks; having successfully summoned his Patronus twice before the exam, he’d managed it a third time, something he’d been quite pleased about.
When the last crumbs of food had been cleared away, Headmistress McGonagall stood up gracefully and tapped her spoon to the side of her glass. Everyone settled into silence.
“I could Apparate, yeah.” replied Harry, a little calmer now.
“Shut up, Potty.” Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m just not looking forward to my mother’s interrogation. She’ll go round the twist when I tell her. Probably start planning the wedding.” Harry snorted.
“Remember in first year, when you challenged me to that midnight duel?” he asked suddenly, laying back in his bed with his hands behind his head. He heard Draco chuckle.
“Ask Draco, I’m busy.”
“Dunno,” Draco replies, and Harry hides a smile but he knows Draco’s eyes caught it anyway. Draco always spoke so eloquently. Whenever he used words like “dunno” Harry knew Draco was teasing him.
“Oh, of course. Is that why you’re still failing Potions? Because you need me as a teacher?” teased Draco, laughing, and Harry flushed. True, he was still not doing that well in Potions, even though he’d been under the instruction of four different teachers.
Snow smacked against the back of his head, and Draco swore as it trickled down the back of his shirt. He shifted off of Harry, the moment- whatever it had been- broken.
“It went alright, actually. Except for this twat dropping in,” Draco said, glaring half-heartedly at Harry. It was hard to be mad at the person who you were cozied up with.
For the rest of the afternoon Draco stayed in the clearing and practiced his magic, safely hidden away from anything and everything. Including his memories.
Fuck, Potter. Draco groaned and covered his face with his hands as the events of yesterday came rushing back in. Why, oh why had he poured out his soul to Potter, Weasley, and Granger? He had been preparing to give some simple answer like “I didn’t want you to die” but then he’d lifted his head, heavy with the weight of all of the things in his past, and seen Potter’s piercing green eyes, and he had just started talking. Talking honestly. He had said way too fucking much. It was like he’d drunk Veritaserum.
her hair puffing up from excitement.
“What happened after that?” Harry asked.
“She wants you to visit?” Draco said, raising his eyebrows.
“You’ve been watching me in class ever since that night you wandered into the room I was in.” Malfoy says, and Harry thinks he hears a note of amusement in his voice.
“Thank you.” he said to the phoenix, tears swelling in his eyes, but tears of relief and joy instead of sadness and anger. The phoenix dipped its head, before flying off in a flurry of bright feathers. Draco watched the phoenix fly away, his breathing ragged, before closing his eyes and laying down upon the soft grass.
“Are you done with that book?” Harry said, trying to keep a neutral tone.
Draco frowned. “Seven, I think. It’s almost time.”
“You could stalk people on here,” mused Draco, attempting to distract Potter from his memories. Potter coughed and flushed a bit, scratching his neck.
AH! It's done! I hoped you liked my (quite) fluffy fic and it's small side of angst. Please feel free to leave a comment, or a kudos, they really make my whole week! :) i love you all <3
“All of us?” said Blaise skeptically.
That’s why it had felt so surreal at Beauxbatons. Because there, he was just Draco. Harry was just Harry. People didn’t care as much, and no one hated him, or the fact that he was dating Harry. A wash of longing to be back at Beauxbatons swept over him.
Finally they reached the spot Harry had picked out, and as Harry walked to the blanket he felt the air change from chilly to pleasantly warm, and sighed in relief. Another thing that was working out. He’d set the blanket on top of the hill, and laid out all of Draco’s favorite little snacks and desserts. As they sat down, Harry watched Draco, anxious for his response to all of this.
Harry walked down to the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione, still slightly hurt and confused from Draco’s abrupt departure. He hadn’t done anything to annoy him, Harry thought. Well, that he knew of. But maybe he was just overexaggerating things, Draco probably just had needed to talk to Daphne, like he’d said. No matter that something in the other boy’s tone had reminded him of when Draco had lied and told Hermione they were out watching a meteor shower when there had been none.
“Well, I’m trying to. I would’ve at dinner but you had a lovely scowl on your face so I figured it was best to wait.”
“I thought you said eyeliner,” he pointed out.
thought Harry.
“They’re comfortable! Why have you been poking around in my trunk anyway?”
“G’night.” came Draco’s voice, slightly sleepy, and Harry smiled again in the dark as he turned over and feel asleep.
The past week had been decent, in Draco’s opinion. After a rather, well, emotional Christmas, Harry had been treating Draco very delicately, like if he said anything remotely insulting he thought Draco would go back to the horrible mental state he had been in a few months ago, which Draco found slightly insulting, although he knew Harry didn’t mean it like that. So a few days ago Draco had confronted him about it
Draco eyed the two of them. “Is this because I got my head bashed in last night?” He tried to sound aloof, but didn’t pull it off like normal, because he’s not really mad at them for staying away. How could he be mad, when he would have done the same thing if their positions were reversed?
“You said not five minutes ago you were rusty!” exclaimed Daphne.
“No,” Draco replied, sneering slightly, before turning back to his essay.
“Yeah, the uniforms here are definitely a little neater. The whole school is, honestly.” Amelie chuckled.
Daphne snorted, tying her long hair back with a green ribbon. “Last night was glorious. When Potter and I got back to the common room, the Headmistress was ripping Finnegan a new one. He got detention three times a week for the rest of the year, and no Hogsmeade trips.”
“How were your classes?” Draco replied, pushing Daphne off of him.
It had been just between them, but after the dinner crowd walked into the common room and saw them snogging one night, well. No longer a secret.
“I don’t like this very much,” he said faintly, slightly distracted by Harry in front of him, who grinned slowly.
They were high above the pitch now, the Snitch leading them on a merry chase through the air. As Draco made a tight dive, his broom jerked. Surprised, he clung on, a sense of alarm coursing through his brain.
“Yes. I like him.” Draco replied in a whisper.
“Yes,” replied Draco, eyeing Pansy sitting on the other side of him. She looked quite composed, shockingly.
“As ready as I’ll ever be. And yes, Hermione, I’ll write to you.”
“Camille asked if you were a good kisser,” Amelie said, and Draco groaned, dropping his head to the floor amongst everyone else’s laughter.
“Chudley Cannons.” Weasley paused, but seemed inspired to say more when his bishop smashed Draco’s pawn. “You?”
“Alright Harry, now you go first and I’ll follow you with Teddy.”
“Camille?”
"Merlin, what happened?"
“Also, it reminds me of Colin Creevey. He died at the battle, but he was always asking me for an autograph or a photo.” he continued, more somberly. Draco looks a little surprised, but nodded. “I think the potion’s ready-” Draco leaned over the cauldron, his shoulder brushing Harry’s.
“Death Eater,” muttered one of the boys, glaring at Draco, who glared right back until the other boy looked away. Just because he didn’t bully people anymore didn’t mean he
“Okay, close your eyes. The only thing on your mind should be the memory you’ve selected. The happiest you’ve ever felt, or the strongest positive feelings you’ve felt.” Harry instructed. Draco nodded slightly, his wand raised in a steady hand, lips slightly parted. Harry resisted the urge to kiss him again and kept talking.
Draco silently cursed his makeup, however pretty it was.
“Alright,” said Harry. “You’ve almost gotten it, I think you’re going to get it really soon. Go ahead and try now. Remember to focus only on that memory, don’t let your mind stray.”
“Sorry, what?”
Draco laughed, catching the paper in one hand deftly and tossing it aside. I hope the presents we sent off got there in time, he thought. They’d sent their presents for Weasley and Hermione back with the letter, and then enlisted other owls to carry other presents back to London the other day. He’d received most of his presents from his friends back at Hogwarts, and from his mother, the day before, so he could open them today.
When Draco got to the common room he plunked down next to Daphne and Pansy.
“Yeah, Hermione, Ron and I are staying with him as much as we can.”
? Harry nodded back, and the two of them stood up.
A few minutes later Amelie reappeared and dragged him onto the dance floor, which he smiled begrudgingly at, but let her. Harry was still apprehensive about dancing, as he knew he was rubbish at it, so he mostly watched everyone else dance, leaning on a wall. Daphne was dancing with Nott, Simon was spinning Amelie around, and Camille was
“Yeah.” he responded. See if I can keep my shit together just a little bit longer.
“Yeah,” said Harry dryly, snatching his glasses off of Draco’s face. “I really didn’t know, thanks so much for telling me.” Draco smirked and Harry rolled his eyes as they stood up.
“So what was the best part of the trip?” said Ron, leaning back in his seat. Harry glanced at Draco again.
“Dreamless Sleep helps. With the nightmares,” said Malfoy quietly a few moments later. “I get mine from Pomfrey.” Harry blinked in surprise. So he’s not the only one with nightmares. It’s oddly comforting to know that.
Harry copied down an intricate diagram on how to Transfigure someone’s ears into leaves. “How was it with Malfoy?”
The four of them sat at the end of the eighth year table, ignoring Malfoy’s protests that other people will stare if he sits with them. Hermione’s next to Malfoy, while Harry and Ron are across from them.
Pansy poked his cheek and went upstairs, and Draco wearily walked over to the three Gryffindors sequestered on a sofa in the corner of the common room, sitting down next to Harry, who curved a steady arm around him and tugged Draco against him.
“Harry-” he started.
“I could see them together, actually.” Harry said thoughtfully. “Wait. You can take people? Damn, this really is the Yule Ball all over again.” he commented with a sad shake of his head. Parvati Patil leaned over from where she was walking with her sister.
Harry only realized he’d fallen asleep when Draco put ice-cold fingers up to his neck and it jolted him awake. He yelped and his eyes shot open reflexively.
“Are you two back together, then?” he asked, trying to sound casual. He heard Draco exhale.
“So what?” replied Draco impatiently. “That better be a so-I’m-done-with-these-dumb- braids and not a so-I-have-to-restart-for-the-fifth-time.” Harry snorted.
“Yeah.” replied Draco. He was not looking forward to rejecting Theo, not to mention he was way too drunk for this. His head was spinning, and the flashing lights and sounds from the dance floor weren’t helping. Theo began walking towards a hallway, beckoning Draco to follow him, which he reluctantly did, stumbling occasionally. “God, I hate being drunk.” Draco muttered, and Theo chuckled as they stood in the dark hallway, which was blessedly a little quieter than the main room of the club.
He knew he shouldn’t start fights, it would get him kicked out. But Merlin, he so desperately wanted to let spells roll off his tongue and knock Finnegan backwards. Not to mention, it would keep away the guilt and self hate for at least a little while.
But Hermione and Ron had been going, and over the course of the summer they’d convinced him to come back. And Harry had liked the idea of being in the familiar places- the common room, the dorms, having his last memories at Hogwarts being mundane, normal things, not the war. Also not being alone so much. Now he shares a dorm with the eighth year Hufflepuff and Gryffindor boys. Ron, Neville, Seamus, Dean. Ernie, Micheal, Justin. The rest hadn’t come back for an eighth year. Or couldn’t. For many reasons. One of them being mortality.
“Potter-AH!” Draco yelped, because Harry had just dropped him into the snow mound, and oh Merlin it was cold. Draco rolled out.
“I was not doing any of that. I’m not a lovesick Hufflepuff.” he said indignantly as they began down the final hallway to their Healing class. She poked his cheek.
“Sure, maybe in a day or two.”
If he was lucky, thought Harry, maybe Malfoy’s indifferent mood would stick and this wouldn’t be any harder than it had to be. He went and sat at the desk assigned to him and waited for the Slytherin to join him.
Before Harry could even smile at the thought of a friendly face from his Hogwarts days, he felt Draco go rigid beside him.  He glanced over and saw that Draco’s face had gone ashen and his jaw looked painfully tight.  Harry put a reassuring hand on his shoulder, feeling tense muscles that did not yield to his light squeeze.
Draco was taken to a holding cell where he stripped and put on the grey robes of an Azkaban prisoner. He took one last breath of freedom and then an Auror pressed his hand to a Portkey. Leading him into the prison, the Auror had taunted him about the living arrangements not being what he was used to, but Draco said nothing. He simply followed the Auror and an Azkaban guard to his cell, laid down on the bench that was to act as his bed, and had his first restless night of sleep.
Draco nodded, at Harry this time and not the book.  “I think I should write a letter to Mother,” he said softly.  Harry smiled at Draco’s retreating form.  He knew how delicate and painful this all was for Draco and his mother, but they had both come so far.  He was proud of them.
Stepping into a cosy living room lit only with warm candlelight, Draco decided that perhaps they were fully into Phase Four after all. Potter was at his side in an instant, offering wine and relieving Draco of the chocolates he'd brought with a smile and a hint of a blush.
’s before casting
Harry froze. Surely that was a joke. Charlie had instructed Draco to continue showing Harry the landscape and had specifically told him to keep clear of dragons. “Are you trying to get us in trouble?”
“Okello doesn’t like wandwork,” Draco whispered as he moved his chair even closer to Harry’s.  “If it can’t be cast wandlessly, he’s not interested.”
Draco briefly wondered if Potter would take him to one of those film things he'd read about. He'd never admit it, but he was desperately curious about them.
Potter was still silent, but Draco could almost see his mind trying to plan his next move.  When he finally opened his mouth, the words came out so fast Draco struggled to understand them.  He made out something about dinner.
Draco suspected the cat didn’t care what a person did so long as said person supplied food. It certainly didn’t look like it had ever missed a meal.
It took all of his control not to start laughing manically.
“A civilian expert who can recognise the plants we are looking for. You wouldn’t know Squib’s Friend from Bellis Perennis, especially in the winter when they aren’t flowering.”
Draco had to admit there was some sense in that suggestion, much as he hated to admit Potter was capable of being logical. He wanted a private location where he wouldn't been seen were he to stumble, but they didn't have a single mutual friends or . . . Well, actually, there was
“So you agreed to come on holiday at my hotel to, what? Show her it isn’t dangerous?”
boyfriend, but I would certainly want a different one.”
Best to try out being on Potter’s side. “The wedding is the third Saturday in April. Most guests are arriving on the Friday and staying until Sunday.”
The lack of warm feelings between the two of them made it all the stranger that Draco was now staying in
Harry felt his brow drop. Why could Malfoy be interested in Hermione's work with house-elf and werewolf legislation? It couldn't be out of support, so it couldn't be good. "What of it?"
Harry fled to the garden and was grateful for the cold air to clear his head. He found Parkinson alone on the back terrace clutching her purse and a flute of champagne. She was scowling at the sky as if the stars had affronted her.
Luna met them when they arrived with a tray of nettle tea and biscuits. She hugged them both and thanked them for luring sprites to the fields with their practices. She claimed the creatures were drawn to competitive energy and loves games and sport. Draco didn't know if any of it was true, but he smiled at her excitement.
Harry couldn’t make out much of what they said to and over each other, but a shriek from Hermione confirmed that it was from the Wizengamot. The two of them stood stalk still with their heads together—bushy brown hair like an invading army over straight, pale strands. Harry and Oliver shared a look of mutual hope and fear before Draco’s shout had them almost collapsing with relief.
“Not an idiot,” Harry protested as he sat up and rubbed the bump on his head. “But in some pain.”
After all, he
When Draco and Harry had eaten their fill, they thanked Aida and went back into the hallway. Draco stopped them at the small doorway between Aida’s kitchen and the dining room. “This is my kitchen.” He opened the door to a narrow room with warm wood counters and cheerfully colored ceramic bowls. There were glass jars filled with flours and sugars, and little pots of jam and spices. Draco marched to one end of the room and pulled out a stool. “You will sit here, where you will be out of the way.”
had happened when the Dark Lord lived at the Manor.
, and he dared not let him think he might be one.
Draco shook his head and released a small, slightly hysterical, chuckle. "When I think of all the hours of sleep I've lost worrying about his reaction to that conversation..."
“Don’t you
Kauko works hard. He is eager to learn, but not greedy. Mielikki tells her of his progress. He watches Antero and listens. He tries some things in their tongue and some in his own. He is following Antero’s path and will be able to heal like him with time.
Should he, could he believe it?  He'd made bad choices in his lifetime; he had put his faith in things that had blown up in his face.  Dare he put his faith in Harry?
Harry smirked back at him. “I was wondering if I could lure you to the Burrow. There’s food, drink, and Quidditch.”
“It's Euphora—not to be confused with the Elixir to Induce Euphoria, which is milder and legal to brew.  The street name is 'ice lolly', because it must remain cool for at least three days once it's brewed and it's best if it stays cold until used.  If it gets above 16 degrees during those first three days, it becomes toxic.  Fatally so.  It also reacts poorly to Cooling Charms and to those Muggle refreezerator things, so it must be kept in a naturally cold environment.  That's bad for the potioneers and good for Aurors trying to find them.”  Draco's grey eyes were shining and Harry had to shift in his seat as his cock responded to the intelligence shown there.
"Mmm." Draco tried to sound sleepy.
“No, hon,” she'd retorted.  “You're pale and slim now.  Then, you looked like you'd recently died of starvation.  And now he sees you again and you're all fit, and he's finally figured out he likes cock . . .”  She'd waggled her eyebrows in an unflattering manner.
He was sitting on the grass outside the Burrow. A cup was pressed into his hand, and he took it and drank without thinking.
"—he gave her a look to convey what could not be said in front of Scorpius—"but come morning…" He felt an echo of the pain in his chest when he had returned to his empty hotel room. No note. No sign that Potter had been there at all. All the hints that maybe Potter had actually cared were clearly either imagined or vanished when Potter woke up to remember who Draco was and what he had done. Seven years, and clearly nothing had really changed.
“And the other stuff. Like meals and whatnots. It seems like a whole weekend of stuff.”
had water pouring into it and then another few flicks set a second pan on top that chunks of chocolate dove into. Harry could barely follow everything that was going on as pans and bowls flew onto counters and butter and whisks soared around. Draco stood calmly in the center of the room, waving his wand like a conductor, making the music of his kitchen fly around him.
'Is it Flintridge?'
"It’s just tradition. No one ever told me why. They just laid down the law and expected perfect compliance.”
Confident in Draco's pleasure, he fumbled for the lube again.  He slicked his fingers again and, his mouth still sucking Draco's cock, began circling the puckered entrance hidden between firm buttocks.  He would have loved to watch his finger tease and ultimately penetrate that tight little hole, but he sensed that Draco's needed his ministrations to stay relaxed.  He sucked hard as he let his first finger push inside.  Draco tensed again, but quickly relaxed.
Was Malfoy here to fell a Christmas tree? The Great Hall was already decorated with a dozen large trees, but perhaps Malfoy wanted one for Slytherin or even his own room. Looking at the single tree glistening with tiny flakes of snow, Harry hoped Malfoy wouldn’t chop it down.
He found he couldn’t be bothered to object. Maybe he should pick up some marshmallows for toasting.
"C'mon, Malfoy. I won' bite," Weasley slurred. Draco slowly lowered himself onto the stool. "There's a good git," Weasley said, and he sent a Stinging Hex at Draco's thigh.
“Eight Sickles,” she said kindly, making him think that she had once again read his concern. “Wizarding Europe is all on the Galleon,” she explained. He paid her and followed his instructions to the Rent-A-Broom stand down the street.
“Ron and Hermione said!” He sounded like he was still a school boy trying to offer the right answer to a stern professor. “Also,” his voice dropped to a mumble “I promised a bride I would be there for her wedding.”
Draco groaned dramatically and dropped his head to the hand not currently clasped with Potter’s. He enjoyed the dramatics, but he was secretly pleased Potter’s friends wouldn’t be openly hostile.
* * *
others. Slytherin hadn't been a big place for hugging—Pansy excluded—and Draco's occasional pulls had always skipped those more romantic gestures.
Realising that the most stubborn wizard of their time—because how else had he survive two separate Killing Curses if not by pure will?—had sunk his talon's into Draco's life should have been at least slightly unnerving. However, Draco thought he might enjoy some of Potter's stalking for once.
“I gave a lot of testimony after the war.” He was struggling to keep his tone light. She might be enjoying it, but he wanted to get back to his tea. It would probably be cold and he’d have to begin again. Warming Charms made tea taste like liquid rubber.
Harry slipped his Auror robes on over his t-shirt and jeans then followed Ron down the hall to Robards’ office. A witch was already standing in front of Robards’ desk with her red curls tie back from her face. Auror Fernsworth turned to face them with one of her smug grins that pulled at the skin around her nose.
He barely noticed the sitting room with its comfortable looking sofa or the large round table beyond. He strode right past the lavatory and into the bedroom. Mercifully, there were two four poster beds waiting for them, each with crisp white bedding. There wasn’t as much room between the beds as there was in Slytherin, but Draco was grateful for every inch of it.
“Do you think he’s up to something?” Harry’s mind raced through possible scenarios, including Malfoy kidnapping dragons and training them to burn down Muggle cities.  He glanced at Hermione and cowered a bit under her withering glare.  Apparently that
Draco considered the possibility of getting his hands on Potter's naked flesh and decided he rather liked the idea. He ignored the voice in his head that suggested he really wanted to know how Potter felt about him.  "I could be persuaded," he drawled. "But I may need one more drink."
Harry wanted to laugh. It sounded more like an excuse than a confession. “Did you tell the press I’d be here?” Draco shook his head. “I am the one who chose to come here. And you haven’t even asked me to do an interview or anything. I think you’re a bit shit at using people these days.”
“So why dragons?” Harry couldn’t help but ask.  “Hermione said you were great at Arithmancy; I'd figured you'd work for Gringotts or something.” Draco's shocked look at hearing that Hermione had complimented him disappeared at the mention of Gringotts.
Instead, he realised that he was standing, naked, in front of Luna's and Draco's houses, staring at Malfoy's cock as his own was starting to fill.  Which would be quite obvious to Malfoy, what with the nudity and all.  Malfoy, who Harry had barely even seen in years.
'Drop it.'
* * *
He was an idiot.  He'd gotten Draco, the star of his dreams and wank fantasies, to agree to dinner, and then he'd run out without a proper explanation.  Then, he'd come to meet Harry at the pub, but Harry'd already gotten soused.  To top it all off, Harry had ended the night with Draco in his house, in his bed , and he'd fucking fallen asleep.  What was wrong with him?
“Draco.”
“You should go, Harry.”
, like make horrible noises when he was trying to sleep or grab at him when he walked by.
Draco Malfoy stepped out into the summer evening light and ran his eyes over every inch of Harry's exposed flesh.  Harry felt indignant.  Luna said that the people she lived with didn't do that!  But this was
Wasn't their close friendship proof of what a good couple they would make? Surely that gave him more rights than Flintridge or anyone else.
"Draco, are you married?"

, they were again presentable.
Harry nodded, pleased to hear Draco say the word Muggle with no hint of his past disdain. "Power lines. They carry electricity."
, Potter.'
Aamu smiles to herself as the young men approach in step with each other. Mehiläinen is holding a pot of his honey, and Kauko is smiling at her through the window.
“What do you say I get you a drink and see if I can't tame that temper?”
"C'mon, Malfoy. You only have to pretend you don't hate me for three weeks." Potter looked a little sad as he said it, and Draco had the oddest impulse to admit he didn't hate him. He didn't
“Now look what you've done,” Draco said to Blaise.  “You've set off the Saviour's hero complex.”  He leant to the side so he could see his would-be hero.  “I don't need rescuing.”  He threw in a dismissive hand flick for good measure.  “Go find a damsel in distress.”
Draco leaned around Weasley to smile lecherously at him. "Don't you want to see it, Longbottom?"
* * *
Harry pulled the long sleeved t-shirt over his head, marvelling at the soft fabric that clung to his arms and chest as he adjusted it into place. A glance at the mirror showed the shirt clinging to him like a second skin, and he had to admit that it showed off his physique better than his usual clothes. He’d worked hard to put muscle on his lean frame, so why not show it off?
He looked back at Draco and saw the question written across his tense features:
Potter must have noticed him feeling it.  “It's just fleece.”
"Well, he was receptive to Macmillan, yes? So that provides some insight into his taste. Macmillan and I are the same sex, age, and blood status, and we both—"
"Wine."  Harry would have loved a whisky, but he needed to keep his wits about him.  He stepped up to the French doors and saw a long garden that eventually fell off into the sea.  He wondered how many years it would take for the sea to claim the whole garden and then the cottage.  A hundred?  A thousand? A million?
“Did you just ask me out?”  Potter turned crimson and nodded.  Gryffindor chivalry must require buying someone a meal before trying to get in his pants.  Well, being seen in public as Harry Potter's date could only help Draco's reputation.  “Then my answer is yes.”
He got up and used his wand to restore his trunk to full size.  Digging inside, he found the bag of purchases he had made during his layover in Amsterdam on his way to England.  He hadn’t had a chance to use them yet, as he’d had little privacy over the past week, and they seemed the perfect solution to his current frustration.
"Besides, it's even more special if it's the first time for both of us."
"Oh. Right then."
“I look forward to working with,” he paused, “Draco.” He felt himself tilt his chin up slightly and hoped he didn’t look like a petulant child.
“No, dear.  But aren't you a darling for asking?”  She touched his cheek, and he did his best to smile through the urge to flinch.  She looked over his shoulder towards the meeting rooms.  “But I may have big news afterwards.”
“You aren’t even listening are you.” Draco sounded more teasing than annoyed, so Harry smiled at him.
“Muggle invention. Muggles use it to grow plants inside. They make fake sunlight.”
* * *
The problem was that the sex had never done it for him.  It was nice and all, and he'd reach orgasm, but it still left him wanting.  It wasn't until he stumbled into a sex shop—just out of curiosity!—and saw the full range of dildos that he started to realise why.  He had bought a bright pink dildo bigger than any cock he'd ever had and took it home to play.  That was the night he'd realised that size
Making their way to Draco's bedroom, Harry found himself growing nervous.  He wanted this desperately, he wanted Draco , but it still felt monumental.  Maybe it was because they had once been enemies.  Perhaps it had just been far too long since Harry had been with someone.  In fact, he hadn't had a real lover since Auror training three years ago.  He hoped Draco didn't find him lacking.  Harry knew that Draco had plenty of suitors—he seemed to get chatted up constantly—but Harry wasn't actually sure how experienced he was.  It wasn't something he really wanted to think about.  He'd nearly hexed Zabini in the toilets last week.
Toby smiled and patted him on the shoulder. “You’ll be in good hands. Draco’s brilliant.” He leered. “Quite nice to look at, too.”
“Well, he's a hell of a lot better than Caldwell and Brighton.  Do you realise what he's given us?  Remember the assistant at the apothecary?  The Scottish one?  I remember him saying that he spends his weekends visiting family.  MacGregor asked him whereabouts they live, and he said they live in Bramblethorn.”
“Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves,” Harry's calming words were undermined by his own enormous grin.  “Let's get these guys in custody and then celebrate!”
“And what is—”
beautiful.
Draco was grateful Potter valued privacy as much as he did. He didn’t want to spend the rest of the meal watching his tone and carefully considering his every word in case it showed up out of context in an article. Not that the
“No, it's a communication coin.  Ron sent me a message.  I have to go.”  He suddenly realised he'd said nothing to Draco about the case or the stake-out and there was no time to explain now.  “I'm really sorry,” he added as he took out some Muggle money and set it on the table.  “Stay and have dessert.  On me.  It's really good and Rosie will . . .”  He looked longingly at the man he'd fancied for the past three years and finally gotten out on a date.  He hated that it had to end like this, but he couldn't risk his suspect getting away or Ron or Neville getting hurt in his absence.  “I'll ring you,” he said from the door of the tavern.  He'd almost said “owl,” but had caught himself just in time.
Blaise nodded solemnly. "You tasted that cake, and Ginny is actually a better cook than most of her siblings."
He reached the long stretch of stone wall and placed his hand flat against it. The magic only recognised a handful of people, and it was only for them that the wall would become a passageway leading to the north stairs. Draco had done the charmwork himself, inspired both by the gates at Malfoy Manor—which had been charmed to only admit the Malfoy family but were later changed by the Dark Lord to allowed those with his Mark—and the entrance to Slytherin—a flat wall which became a passage with a password.
He spread the robes on the bed and tapped the iron, which looked like a polished stone triangle, with his wand.  The iron immediately began steaming and radiating heat as it danced around his robes.  Once his robes were perfectly smooth, it sat itself upright like a Crup sitting on its hind legs awaiting a treat.
'Fuck!' Draco pulled back and Harry saw his own release dribbling down Draco's chin as he coughed and frowned. 'I think I'd hoped it might taste a bit sweeter.'
“Oh, get off,” Ron said.  “I can be nice at Christmas like everyone else.  And Easter, if it’ll get you to visit then as well.  You know, if he only sees me at holidays, he’ll think I’m all friendly and changed.”  Ron winked at him and strode back to the cauldron of steaming wine.
are you an Auror?' It was more than a little odd to hear Parkinson ask the same question Hermione had repeated so many times, but Harry was too shocked by the earlier information to do more than stare.
The next morning, Draco woke with the sun. He couldn't lie in when he didn't feel at home, so he decided to put himself straight to work. As the sausages cooked, he wiped down the kitchen were dust had been accumulating since the matriarch’s departure.
She dropped into the chair next to him. "A sex manual? That's your plan?"
Draco ascended the stairs past the landing for Great Aunt Gwenna’s rooms and the next landing for his own until he reached the top floor of the wing. The rooms were spacious with high ceilings, but they made Draco feel smothered. Every curtain was drawn as if his mother could keep out the world beyond. Every bit of wall space was covered in portraits and other art from Malfoy Manor, and the rooms were tightly furnished with every piece his mother had refused to leave behind in a home she refused to return to.
Harry Potter was a virgin. Harry Potter—Saviour of the Wizarding World, winner of Witch Weekly's Most Eligible award, and the wank fodder of the masses—was a
Yes, there would be perks to Draco's plan, and one of them was Potter's body.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. As much as he liked the Cannons, he wasn’t blind to their failings like Ron was.
Draco would have to introduce him to sense. "Do you
* * *
So it was almost too much when Head Auror Robards walked up to Ron and him later that morning with a rare smile.
“Well, I don’t.”  Draco tried to kiss him again, but Harry side-stepped away.  He tried twice more, his pout deepening with each failure.  “Fine!  Then I’m going to bed.”  He turned and stomped away.  Harry followed on his heels.  “If you think you’re coming to my room, you had better be planning to please me.”
“No. How did you know which wedding—”
Arthur walked in and smacked the burly one upside the head with an ease that spoke of years of practice. "Charlie, leave Draco alone. He doesn't need you trying to seduce him when he has a murderous uncle to worry about."
* * *
* * *
Draco could imagine Potter squirming on the other end of the phone. And he would use a phone. He was Muggle raised, wasn’t he?
* * *
“Shhh. You’re okay. I’ve got you.” Potter held him close and murmured in his ear as Draco turned to bury his face deeper into his damp pillow.
"A bit overdone?"
The air back in Cornwall was definitely colder, but it felt more welcoming than any Mediterranean breeze. The harsh saltiness of it was familiar and entwined with memory. This was where Draco had found himself, where he had built a future for himself, and this was where Harry had come back into his life. A year later, Draco couldn’t smell sea air without being reminded of the smell of Harry’s skin after he went swimming.
As the other two Aurors secured the perimeter, Harry briefed Ron on what had happened. His best friend listened patiently before clapping him on the shoulder and telling him to go home. “Or not home. Just find your
'A wedding dress. She thinks Boot will propose soon, so she's already planning everything.' Draco sounded amused as he gathered the papers and adjusted the cushions.
Draco looked around the village tavern Potter had taken him to.  Yes, village.  Apparently even Muggle London was too risky when one's date bore the scar of the Dark Mark.  Nothing about the décor or location made the place memorable, although the large fireplace in the front room at least provided warmth and light.  A round-faced woman with black hair pulled into a messy ponytail greeted Potter by name and asked about Draco.  It seemed that he brought dates here often, and Draco wasn't sure if that made him feel better or worse.  It would explain why the Daily Prophet hadn't covered any of Potter's relationships since he'd left Auror Training.
Draco set the letter aside and began eating again with far more attention than toast really warranted.  “She wants to know if you’re coming to Christmas.”  It had been whispered to a fried tomato, but Harry heard it none the less.
By Friday afternoon, he was wondering if Potter had changed his mind about dinner and was now avoiding him.  His nerves were increased by Sothman lurking around his desk and making little comments about looking forward to working together closely .  It was his last day before the man became his supervisor, and he wasn't even sure he had a date , let alone a possessive lover.  Not that the date part was strictly necessary, but someone like Potter would feel obliged to buy a man dinner before taking him to bed.  And who was Draco to turn down fine food and a public appearance with the wizarding world's precious Saviour ?
“I will need to examine the plants.”
Heart pounding, he took the final step so that his foot slid between Draco's feet and their shirts brushed.
headlines. Rita Skeeter would have an early Christmas describing his sexual perversions and speculating about what
“Really?”
Potter smiled. "Can we try again tonight? We didn't actually get much practice in last night, even though we made a good start."
Harry couldn’t make out more than a word or two, but there were lots of photographs moving on each page. There was a large one on the cover of the French Minister shouting at some other politician Harry didn’t recognise. The photograph on page 3 made him laugh as he watched the Crup in a young girl’s arms repeatedly lick her ear despite her silent protests. On page 7, Harry watched the French national Quidditch team race across the sky.
Harry usually ended up at Draco's house in the evenings, and it was much clearer what his intent was then.  He ate Draco's food—despite having a house-elf, Draco found he liked cooking—drank his wine, and then fucked him into the mattress.  Harry would then be too tired to go home, so he'd sleep in Draco's bed.  After a couple of weeks of this, Harry even had clothes and some personal items stored there.
Draco had done his job and Harry had back-up.
Potter began nibbling at his neck.
Charlie nodded.  “It’s dangerous working with dragons.  Skill matters far more than personality.” He smiled wryly. “Much like the Aurors, I expect.”
"There had to be something wrong." Harry went on. "Don’t you see? I couldn’t believe that this handsome, charming man who sees me for who I am—full of flaws—" He smiled at Draco’s emphatic nod. "Someone like that couldn’t really want to be with me."

article and saw the tone was as savage as Gabby’s from a few years back, but far less likely to create any Malfoy sympathy. This article was written by Rita Skeeter and she was in her element, stretching any little fact to an outrageous conclusion. The mere mention that the hotel grounds homed pigs was followed by a list of Dark rituals requiring pigs' blood. There wasn’t a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing, but every sentence dripped with accusations. He looked up at Ron.
* * *
Ron just waved him off. “I’m glad actually. Maybe if you spend all day talking
Potter took the hint and let it drop, but he did not go back to ignoring Draco. Nor would he let Draco ignore him. He asked Draco about jazz music and Arithmancy and the book of Norse sagas Draco took to bed. More surprising was the fact that he listened to Draco’s replies.
And wasn’t that so Draco? To follow these archaic rules no one else cared about, but then bend them to his own purposes. The mere thought filled Harry’s chest with warmth.
Draco wrinkled his nose. "No. I've had quite enough of the Dark Lord, and if one of your lot is going to be Minister, it should be Granger."
"Potter."
Perhaps Draco wasn't yet comfortable enough with Hermione to laugh at her nagging. They were more colleagues than mates, and Draco often seemed nervous about offending her on certain topics, like house-elves. Or maybe this was related to Draco's troubles.
They lay panting and staring at the ceiling. He was warm, relaxed, and happy. It was a great feeling. Harry could get used to regular sex and Draco in his bed.
Draco stopped short and gave him a glare. “And how do you suppose we do that, Potter? They aren’t Crups who come at a whistle or a call. They are the largest, longest-lived, and most dangerous of all magical creatures. They are highly intelligent, and they do not want to be found and gawked at by impatient upstarts.” His pointed look made it abundantly clear who the upstart was. “What we are doing, because you clearly fail to appreciate the significance, is learning where there are possible nesting sites, where food sources are, and where potential hoarding lairs may be. We are learning how to
"I'm bored!"
“Draco!” He didn’t care if he revealed his position to his attackers. He needed Draco to find him. Two spells zinged by as he crawled back to where he’d felt Draco fall. His fingers met hair and frantically he ran his hands over Draco’s face and chest. Movement. Breathing.
Merryn shrugged and pushed her hair from her face with her arm. Her hands were covered in soapy water as she washed up. “So? Maybe it’s time I stop hiding it.”

“But Merryn—”
"No, I mean with someone else."
made sure to mention when Luna had been held captive in Malfoy Manor, once even suggesting that it was having captives which had inspired the idea of opening a hotel. No wonder people like this Kensa were worked up about it and didn’t feel it was a safe location for her brother’s wedding.
Draco’s colouring may have been the same, but his face showed the passage of time. His sharp nose looked less rodent-like on a man’s face than it had on the little boy he’d once been. His angular features now said aristocratic instead of ferret-face. Harry let his eyes fall to Draco’s chest and regretted the way his grey robes hid his body. From under the robes, smooth black leather shone from two well-polished, pointed shoes. The leather looked amazingly soft, and Harry found his fingers itching to touch.
And Harry did.
"He …"
sexually frustrated. He threw his roll against the wall and buried his face in the pillows.
Harry forced himself to process Draco’s words instead of fantasising about his footwear. The plant for the Potion. It couldn’t grow near electricity.

Draco couldn’t keep in the low chuckle. Merryn had told him all about Weasely’s eating habits in the autumn in a voice laced with awe. “That must be the flourless chocolate cake. Yes, we definitely still
When their eyes met, Malfoy's cheeks would turn pink and his smile made Harry's heart melt. Was he mad? Was he fancying Malfoy? The flutter in his chest was answer enough. And would it be so bad? Malfoy said he planned to come back to England, and Harry hadn't found anyone better in the past seven years. Why not see where this led?
Ron scowled. "You can be all philosophical and sharing. If I find out someone's wanking to thoughts of my wife, I'm going to Hex his balls off."
"You’ll never guess who wrote to me."
Robards ask?"
Harry smiled at Draco’s snobbery, but dutifully pulled out the gold and green tin of loose-leaf tea Narcissa sent each month and set about making Draco’s morning pot of tea.  The tin was running low, and Harry took that to mean he should expect Narcissa’s owl.  She seemed psychically connected to Draco’s tea leaf supply.  Harry could admit that Draco’s tea was superior to his own, but Draco refused to let him add milk to it, and that was how Harry liked his tea.  So Harry stuck with his bags and his milk, and Draco stuck with his disgusted comments and expressions.

As soon as she left, Draco grabbed the Auror Request and completed it with his own name as advisor.  He completed a few more forms and slipped the Auror Request into the middle of them just as Clearwater returned.
'Harry? You all right?' Draco knelt before him and looked at him with wide, grey eyes. Harry forced himself to nod. 'Harry? Do you . . .' Draco swallowed hard as if fighting not to gag. 'Do you fancy Padma?'
Potter's face danced through a series of subtle changes. There was the initial lift of the brow and then the slight twitch of the lip. Those intense green eyes wandered over Draco's face as if searching for some additional clue. The sound of laughter from other guests on the back lawn drifted over and reminded Draco that they were only superficially alone. He was about to make an excuse and leave—what had he been
He'd talk to Ron and Hermione once they escaped from Percy's latest story and made the way across the room to him. He'd probably chat with some co-workers—maybe sneak a bit of work in by conferring with Henderson on the McClain case. And when the time came, he would watch.
Draco gave him the smug smile he was expecting, even if it was a little forced. “Of course, Potter.
I didn’t have a mother." Then he leapt forward and swatted Teddy’s arm. "Your it!" He tore off into the mist with Teddy racing behind him. Draco and Harry were left standing in the growing silence.
have to wait this long to get in the field?” he asked Draco bitterly one night as he slapped his book down on their coffee table. He was lying across the couch in front of the fireplace, whilst Draco was sitting on the second couch with his long legs tucked up. Draco marked his place in his own book before setting it down with a gentleness that scolded Harry for his own book treatment.
Kensa stepped forward. “I owe you an apology. I acted horribly, but please understand, I was just trying to protect Jowan.”
“You wouldn't—We're . . .  Are we . . .”   Well that didn't come out right .  Harry just wasn't sure what he wanted to ask or say; they'd never really discussed their relationship before.  He tried again.  “There's no one else, right?  You wouldn't . . . you know . . .”
Harry bit down on his frustration at having made yet another mistake in Draco’s eyes. It was his sixth day in the field, and he was bored of discussing terrain and sheep grazing patterns. The past five days had been spent passed among Charlie, Pavel, Zhi and Dave, but they’d all been called away by a fight between two Norwegian Ridgebacks—not Norberta, Charlie had assured him—and left him with Draco as his instructor. Harry had hope that Draco would be more interesting, but he rabbited on about terrain and sheep just as much as the others had.
The actual news—as Draco learned in the department meeting the next Monday—was that Clearwater was being transferred to work on the International Substance Counsel based in Venice.  It was a very cushy position that she had done nothing to earn.  More upsetting was that all of Draco's hard earned points for favours rendered were now worth nothing.  He eyed up his colleagues and wondered who would take over the joy of bossing him around and fondling him inappropriately whilst he did their work with no acknowledgement.
Harry’s face flamed and his throat was painfully dry. He tried to swallow, but his tongue was too heavy to move.
“Are you just going to stare at it?” came the impatient voice from above.
Kauko will need help. Aamu hopes he learns to see it waiting for him.
"What?" Draco was becoming more and more confused with each passing moment. Had Hermione had a few too many at the Leaky? What did this have to do with Harry?
Their favourite of the village's two pubs had just opened the outdoor seating in the back garden, and Draco gestured to the table they had frequented the summer before.
No. Not a log. A body.
Harry turned to glare at Flintridge. 'I didn't need one. Their food is well worth the gold I paid.' He looked back at Draco, grateful to find Draco still watching him. He looked deep into Draco's eyes, willing him to understand what Harry had only just realised. 'You are worth it.'
Potter snorted. "Pot, kettle, black."
"Italian is fine. And I’m only staying for dinner." Draco’s eyes carried caution, and Harry knew he was the one to make Draco so wary. He still had work to do to regain Draco’s trust, but at least Draco would give him that chance.
“The Antipodean Opaleye,” he said decisively. “Their social structures are more complex than any other dragon and they venture the furthest from their homeland.” He sounded as fevered with passion as Charlie or Pavel ever did, and Harry envied him. “We have a few here at the reserve.” He turned and fixed Harry with an intense stare. “Would you like to meet one?”
Draco's smirk was haughty and smug, and it made Harry want to melt. 'Yes. I think I could be up for that,' he said as casually as one might agree to a cup of tea. He ran a smoothing hand over his shirt and hair and then retrieved his glass from the table beside them. Taking a sip, he winked at Harry before walking over to where Blaise and Parkinson were standing and staring. Harry just grinned at his back.
Harry laughed. “You’re a posh Wiltshire boy in rural Wales. They will
“You didn’t even
“Surely if Draco Malfoy has the Dark Mark, he is a Death Eater. You must allow that much.”
Draco looked down and realised he was still fully dressed. He flushed at being caught staring as Potter undressed and quickly stripped down to his own boxers. Once Draco removed his shirt, Potter removed his own to show that he was surprisingly toned for his someone so slender. He wasn't bulky, but there was a strength to his torso and arms that matched his natural intensity.
Malfoy didn’t reply. He just squeezed Harry’s hand back and smiled up into the falling snow.
She left him to finish his lunch and he found his head filled with thoughts in the quiet her absence created. Would he fit in? Would this make him happy? Would he find working with dragons as frustrating as being an Auror? Would he feel just as lonely as he had in London once Ginny had left to play Quidditch in the States and Ron and Hermione had gotten married and moved away to their little cottage? Would he miss Teddy too much to be happy so far away? He swallowed his doubts along with the sour soup and stood on much stronger legs than he’d had when he’d arrived.
member of the faculty. Perhaps a spouse, but no reason to have separate beds. While sharing a bed with Potter might have occurred in one or two of Draco's odder dreams since returning to Hogwarts, it was not an option for two weeks of painful reality. Infectious illness or no.
, but he was distracted by the pleading green eyes that were insisting he agree. "Just one drink."
“Malfoy is my real name, Potter.”  The glare grew fiercer.  “Fine, fine.   Harry .”  He'd never admit it, but it actually felt rather thrilling to call him that.  He couldn't resist trying it again.
Neville threw his head back and laughed with full amusement. If Neville hadn’t been wrapped in a travelling cloak, Harry probably would have seen his stomach shaking with the force of it. Instead Harry waited in bemusement as Neville wiped his eyes and slowly composed himself.
“Welcome back!”
Harry turned back to Charlie in time to catch that the ruddy-faced man next to him, Dave, was the final member of their team.  From his accent, Harry assumed Dave was American.
Draco laughed at the mere thought. “Oh God, no. Zabini is in love with himself, which is the closest any of my friends come to an intrest in men. Except Pansy, of course, but she’s not my type.”
“What's the difference?”
“Is Clearwater a stickler for punctuality?”
Two hours and several rounds later, the only thing that kept Harry from having passed out was Hermione's insistence on food and water between the rounds.  Nothing had prevented him from growing increasingly mopy as Ron and Hermione cooed together across the table from him.  He looked around for Neville and found him at the bar staring longingly at Hannah as she served customers.  Another glance at Ron and Hermione found them feeding each other chips and it made him feel sick with envy for that kind of comfort.  He couldn't keep his mind from Draco.
It was a test and his safety was at stake. He opened a narrow door and found a well-stocked larder. The Weasley matriarch had been gone long enough that the Stasis Charms had worn off, but luckily none of the produce had yet gone off. He grabbed pasta and various vegetables before stepping back into the kitchen to find pots.
!  There is no defying that witch once she’s set her mind on something.  Anyway, I attended my classes, ate quickly at meals, and studied in Granger’s room or my own bed.  And as soon as I’d graduated, I left the country.”
Harry smiled at the thought of Malfoy putting his desire for Harry before his profits.
“And then it'll be Caldwell or Brighton, who are basically useless,” Potter added, shoulders sagging along with his voice.  A moment passed in silence before Potter turned his big green eyes on Draco with a quizzical look.  “If Substances didn't send you . . .”   Why are you here? w as left unsaid.
For the rest of the day, Draco was haunted by Blaise's words.  Did he really plan to remain a virgin forever?  Of course not!  He was as randy as any young man.  He was good-looking and single, and he should be shagging his way through the Ministry!  What was wrong with him?
Draco grimaced a bit as he ran his tongue along his chin. He wrinkled his nose and looked thoughtful. 'Not
"You want to help Hermione." Harry didn’t manage to sound very convinced, but he was surprised to realise that he wanted to be. Deep in his stomach was a hope that Malfoy really had grown, that he was the man who had protected Harry and his friends during the war and not the snotty boy who had seemed to delight in the misfortunes of others.
Seemingly not, given the way Malfoy dug his hands into Harry’s hair and brought them more firmly together. Harry was suddenly glad for his lack of hat. Cold ears was a small price to pay for the thrill of having Malfoy’s fingers threading through his hair.
Maybe he and the cat could even get on. Granger seemed to enjoy her feline, so perhaps there was something to them. The purring was supposed to be soothing, right? And some of them were definitely cute. The large ginger cat blinked at him. Well,
He glanced back to Hermione and saw her expectant, and exasperated, stare.  There was something he was supposed to be saying; he just didn’t know what it was.  She huffed and crossed her arms as she turned to her garden.  “The name is apt,” she stated primly with a lift to her nose.
Great Aunt Gwenna appeared at the door, her silver hair piled elegantly on top of her head and her angular features softened by her smile. Her smile was so like Lucius’ that it hurt sometimes, but in that moment it filled him with warmth. Gwenna squeezed Rosamund’s shoulder as she walked forward. “Well now that he’s back, Rosie, you can fatten him up.” She turned to Draco and offered her warmest smile. “Welcome home, dear. Come sit and tell us how you’ve been.”
"Well I guess we worked up a good appetite for dinner," Draco quipped.
'I should get my things together,' Draco said as he stood. 'And have a snack. Padma refused to make it a dinner meeting. She doesn't even have a ring and she's worried about fitting into a dress.'
'You really are completely daft, aren't you?' Her tone was surprisingly gentle.
Draco nodded, knowing that was more than he could ever have expected.
The woman leans over him and he transforms into a bee. She watches him fly off to the sky carrying the weight of all her hopes. Then she looks down at her son’s body, which is once again before her. Aamu sees the tightness of her shoulders as she waits for the bee. She does not move, trying her best to hide her misery. Then her head jerks up.
of it all?
Draco had almost thanked Potter as they stood staring at each other in the courtroom. There were people moving and talking all around them, but Draco had seen no one but Potter. He wanted to speak, but his mouth was dry and his head was muddled. In the end, he just gave a nod before the Aurors dragged him out the doors to the long hallway beyond.  He had thought Potter called something after him, but the words were swallowed by the crowd.
Harry wasn’t sure what to make of that. He supposed Malfoy was entitled to think Harry was suspicious instead of curious, but it still made Harry’s heart feel heavy and tight. “I know. I just wanted to …” He shrugged. He didn’t know what he wanted, but the words that came to his lips rang true. “Join you.”
"Gay? But didn't you and Pansy … ?"
And instead of sitting on boards and committees, he imagined himself working as a Curse Breaker for Gringotts or the Ministry, or even for the eldest Weasley’s new company. He would come back from a long day of work feeling tired but satisfied and find his lover at work in the kitchen. They would have elves, of course, but Draco rather liked the fantasy of having a lover baking in nothing but an apron. Maybe there would be a dusting of flour through his wild black hair.
“Getting ready for sunnier skies,” he asked with a pasted-on smile—not that she could distinguish it from a real one.
Hermione’s brow furrowed in the way it did when she had yet to solve some riddle. "That’s what I can’t understand. He claims that he wants to help me pass the Directive Upon Magical Beasts. At first I thought he was joking or that it was a trick, but some of his advice is really good. He said that we should include centaurs with werewolf and then focus the media attention on centaurs since people are less afraid of them. He pointed out that Firenze is one of the most popular teachers at Hogwarts and suggested recruiting him as a spokesperson. Do you think Malfoy really wants to help with D.U.M.B?"
Harry all but leapt from the bed that no longer felt luxurious. He threw on his clothes and Apparated away before he could see the lying cheat again.
Draco flushed as he looked over to ensure Scorpius hadn’t heard Mother’s declaration. Luckily the boy was engrossed in building a castle with wooden blocks and showed no interest in the two adults finishing their tea. That was because the biscuits were all gone.
Well, Draco could still be polite. He still had his integrity. “Yes, of course. Thank you for calling. We do understand. What were the dates of your reservation?”
"Great! I'll see you both next week. Come by on Monday." She turned to walk back to her house without waiting for their consent.
"They're amazing." George was smiling as he gestured towards the apple. "I brought one back for you."
“Harry! Draco! C'mon over.” Draco took the seat on the end, leaving Harry sandwiched between him and a large, ruddy-faced man.  He moved to the side to allow the large man more room and found his upper arm pressed against Malfoy’s.  Malfoy didn’t move away.
But that was going to change.  Harry forewent his usual drinks with dinner, determined to keep his wits about him when they made it home.  The rush of lust that Draco always inspired in him was distraction enough from coherent thought.  Draco must have noticed Harry’s abstinence because he repeatedly offered him drink.
* * *
"Harry! Malfoy! Over here." Draco approached cautiously. "Malfoy, come sit here."
Four hours later, Draco still looked a bit wide eyed.  “Did you expect her to hex you?” Harry teased.  Draco blinked and looked at him as they walked through a grassy clearing.
He'd pined for Draco last Christmas because he'd had no idea the other man might have any interest in him.  There was no way he would repeat that fate when he and Draco all but lived together.
* * *
He waved his hand airily, clearly enjoying listing all the things he knew that Harry didn’t. “There certainly isn’t enough annual sunlight in Scotland. I would think South West England is most likely. Perhaps Wales.” He turned his smug grin on Harry and waved his finger in mock scolding. “And no, you can’t use sunlight spells because the plant destroys the magic.”
Potter had returned to his slicing, so Draco walked up behind him until their clothes brushed together. He wrapped his hand around an uncut courgette and lifted it in front of them. He ran his thumb over the skin of the vegetables and let a little moan sound in Potter's ear.
“Not like his father needs gold in Azkaban,” Harry said.  He could not help but feel a little satisfaction each time he thought of Lucius Malfoy finally having to pay for his crimes.  Even after so many years, he couldn’t quite forgive the man for setting a basilisk and Tom Riddle on his friends back in second-year.
Harry's eyes softened as they met Draco's. "You've been all but dead for days. You need a Healer and something to eat and drink."
He was torn from his thoughts when Draco reached the top of the stair and pushed open the wood door to his spacious bedroom.  He had only a moment to take in the large white bed before Draco was on him.  Hot kisses peppered his lips before deepening into a passionate kiss of tongue and teeth.  Harry focused on undressing them both, desperate to feel the other man's skin against his own.
love—how would he even know when he hadn't considered it before and was apparently a bit crap in the emotional self-reflection department?—but he knew that the feelings that had driven him to plan this party in such detail were certainly stronger than the desire to please a friend. In a way, he had been
"Mhmm," was all Draco managed as he tried to make sense of Potter's actions. He was almost acting as if they were a couple. A loud crack announced Potter's departure, but Draco stayed standing in the dark for long moments after.
“Why won’t you talk to me?” Harry pleaded.
Only some of that time was spent with Potter convincing him to borrow some Muggle clothes for the day. Draco wouldn't admit it, but the jeans looked rather good on his long legs and firm arse.
her house.
And then it hit him.
Well, time to start learning.
Kauko came from far away, his life saved by his mother and the bee. They are calling him back home. Aamu is sad to see him go, but she knows his legend continues in his own land. He must return to his mother without pride. He must see what life he can build with Mehiläinen.
was a gross exaggeration, but it
"Malfoy?"
“Harry?” The spell left him and he relaxed against the dirt. His head and shoulder hurt from where he’d fallen against a raised tree root, and his ribs flared up again to remind him they hadn’t been treated.
It was a nasty way to go, and Draco looked a bit peaky for a moment before collecting himself again.
"It's not like I went into your
'I'd rather have unhealthy than nothing.'
He had a sudden terrible thought that Draco might expect him to wear a dinner jacket or dress robes. He imagined showing up in his scruffy trainers and finding Draco dressed to the nines and sneering at him.
Was Harry supposed to strip? Or was he supposed to take off Draco's clothes? He rather liked the idea of Draco fully exposed for him to admire. Even when he'd see Draco half-naked in the mornings, Harry would force his eyes away so he wouldn't be caught staring at the trail of light blond hair that ran down his flat stomach from his navel.
The Angove-Bronstein wedding. They still hadn’t cancelled. Apparently they were just bringing in the Aurors. “What, like security?”
Draco was looking at him expectantly, and Harry realised he was daydreaming instead of responding. 'No, I like doing the crossword at home.'
Potter placed a hand on his shoulder. "But this is all your doing.  And Ron knows that! It's probably the only day in his life he'll be happy to see you. Please?"
That hope had been born three years ago when Draco first joined the Ministry, although he'd still been 'Malfoy' then.  Harry had just completed Auror training—training made even more intense by Kingsley's decision to have Harry, Ron, and Neville complete their N.E.W.T.s on top of all the usual training—and Harry had barely seen anyone who wasn't part of the Aurors since the war.
. The reminder that Harry now lived with him just made Draco smile more. It must have been a soppy smile because Merryn rolled her eyes and headed back into the house.  “You’re letting the heat out,” she shouted back at them.
He would miss this.
'Happy birthday to me,' Draco said and his hot breath made Harry's cock twitch. Draco stuck out his tongue and cautiously lapped at the head. The first brush of warm, wet pressure had Harry's knees trembling. Draco pulled back, and the warmth left whilst the wetness remained.
It shouldn't have worked.  It was a stupid line, but Harry's body was responding to Draco's heat and his smell and the fact that he was right there, naked, and beautiful.  Shit, he really was, wasn't he?  His pale hair and skin gave him an ethereal glow that contrasted with the feral look in his eyes.
Harry leant forward and kissed him.
Harry wandered into the kitchen hoping to find a pot of Draco's stew simmering on the back of the hob. He knew it wouldn't be there—Draco had been gone for three days—but it didn't stop him from hoping. Sure enough, the hob was cold and there was no pot of delicious lunch awaiting Harry's empty stomach.
Watching Blaise with narrowed eyes, Potter did not move.
Harry shrugged. “Not really sure. We went from agreeing to have dinner to about to start our third date in less than two hours.” At Neville’s confused look, Harry explained about the lunch that became a date after the fact and the ice cream that was made its own event.
Draco shot him a condescending look. “I’m not saying I joined Granger’s elf club or anything. I can see you looking all self-righteous. I still don’t agree with freeing house-elves. Bippy sobbed for a month when I freed her, and the others just moped around. Aunt Gwenna hasn’t been able to free her elf Totty because he refuses to take anything from her hand anymore. We only freed the poor things to keep the Ministry away once Granger started passing legislation. We knew the Ministry would still love to lock me up for something.”
"Well, I imagine you enjoy the fieldwork aspect of being an Auror—restless as you are—whilst being Head Auror is mainly paperwork, managing subordinates, and attending meetings. I would think you'd find it rather dull and tedious."
“My point is,” Hermione’s voice called him back from his memories, “even after they bought the Manor back from the Ministry, Malfoy and his mother would have had ample gold for them both to live comfortably. There was no obvious reason for Malfoy to take a job that is physically and magically demanding, socially isolating, and without any political influence.”
* * *
They Apparated to the Ministry together and stood in comfortable silence on the lift ride to Level 2.  When they reached the turn where their paths separated, Draco was surprised that Harry continued with him toward Substances.
“But he has the Dark Mark!”
“Where are we going to celebrate,” Ron asked as they made their way out of the office a few minutes later.  Harry was dirty, sore, and completely exhausted, but he knew going out for drinks was not optional.
Harry bit back a laugh at Draco’s surprised face. Draco shot him a look that was half question, half accusation.
Harry set the table with the plates he had checked for obvious chips or cracks and then added candles that he Charmed to hover above them. He had even dug out a small basket for the garlic bread he’d made to go with the spaghetti bolognese. It wasn’t the poshest meal he could have planned, but he knew his home-grown vegetables and herbs would provide a rich flavour to the sauce.
To get Draco to safety, he needed to know the direction of the attack. Another flash of light came from the darkness beyond where they had searched. Away from the wind tunnels.
Charlie went on to talk about the rest of the researchers, but Harry was too busy watching the way Draco’s whole body demonstrated his discomfort.
Draco forgot to pretend to be busy.
“Are you trying to bed Rolf?” he asked before he could stop himself.  Draco scowled at him.
Draco shook the past from his mind.  There was nothing to be done for it now.  Tonight his focus was to create a beneficial alliance.
Draco nodded, hope trying to bloom in his chest again despite his fears that he was misunderstanding completely. He needed to keep his voice casual. “You mean how we both agree Weasley is best off with Granger?”
Draco realised that Harry was no longer addressing him. In fact, he wondered if Harry remembered he was in the room at all as Harry and the cat rubbed their faces together. Draco bit back the urge to tell them to get a room.  Draco knew full well that Harry didn’t find jealousy becoming, and the fact that it was a cat wasn’t likely to change that. Best to play nice.
The rest of August passed in a blur of tour groups and researchers.  Draco and Harry had only two nights together at their flat, and both times, Draco had jumped Harry the moment the door had closed, kissing and undressing him as he pulled him down the hall to his room.  And both times, Harry had awoken alone in Draco’s large bed in his much larger room.
“No. No risk of that. I love Ron, but only in a brotherly sort of way.” Potter stared for a moment, while Draco pretended to look at his book. “And you? Are you pining for one of your friends?”
and you’re holding up the game.” Harry snickered; he loved the name of the wizarding version of the Muggle board game.  He always got an image of groupies chasing Gilderoy Lockhart.
"The children are fine," Draco chided, "I’m the one who needs a hand." The fact that he was willing to accept help was impressive. That he would actually ask for it showed just how exhausted Draco was. He peered down at a long sheath of parchment blinking more times than should be necessary with such clear penmanship and then fumbled with a jar of cinnamon sticks until Harry gently took it from him.
Potter closed the book on the quill and tossed them aside. “How are you feeling?” He put the back of his hand to Draco’s forehead with an ease that implied he had done it several times before. “Fever’s still gone. Been gone since this morning.”
It was likely this was Potter’s attempt to express his own interest, but Draco would proceed with caution until he was sure. No way in hell was Draco risking himself first. “Are you asking for a list of traits I find desirable in a partner or a list of men who could interest me?”
The bottle of wine Draco held out to him reminded Harry they were not to spend the evening in the doorway. He invited Draco in and led him to the kitchen. Conversation was awkward at first, but once they each had a glass of wine in hand and a safe topic (Quidditch), they fell into an easy exchange of opinion and gentle barbs. Harry was sure Oliver would lead Puddlemere to the cup, but Draco was too loyal a Falcon’s fan to accept that.
Potter laughed.  “No, not sheep-fleece, fleece-fleece.  It's made from poly-tecni-something.  It's like plastic or something.”  Draco's face must have shown how unhelpful that explanation was, because Potter continued.  “Plastic's a Muggle material.  They make stuff with it.  Hell, they make almost everything with it!”  Draco was feeling even more out of his depths than when he was trying to figure out what to do with his hands whilst Potter kissed him.  At least that had felt good, so he went back to his fumbling.
to be asking Charlie about an apprenticeship at the dragon reserve.”  She shot Harry a little glare as if the entire tangent had been his fault.
Potter's eyes flashed and his jaw set. "I'm
Draco ran a firm hand along Harry's cheek and under his chin.  "Shower?"
Draco had decided to finish his usual assignments that afternoon and not start reviewing the Auror case until after hours.  No one else stayed a minute past five in Substances, so he knew he'd have the area to himself.  He didn't want Caldwell or Brighton to discover that he'd stolen their assignment and complain to Clearwater.  While Clearwater would never admit she hadn't made the assignment herself—it might bring to light that she let Draco do her work without so much as a review—she might “change her mind,” and assign one of the old wizards instead.
Draco kissed him hard, biting as much as kissing him. He pulled back with a hungry glare. “Fuck me. Fuck me hard with that huge cock of yours.”
"What peddler? Who was here?" That was Harry's voice. Yes, Harry. Arthur had insisted that the given name rule extend that far, but it was Harry calling him, "Draco" that decided it. The way Harry's lips curved around the "o" made Draco a little hard. It made Draco want to call him, "Harry."
Harry almost hated to say it. “Muggles have heaters, too.”
naked.  Even knowing that it was a naturist commune, Harry waited for an old lady to appear and call him a pervert and then a Bobby to come arrest him.  He just couldn't wrap his brain around this being legal.
When the coffee appeared before them, Draco took the opportunity to busy himself with preparing two cups and ignoring the topic at hand. Potter just sat watching him.
“Too tired to fuck?”  Harry took a step into Draco’s space and watched a smug grin spread across his face.
* * *
The odd thing about Harry and Parkinson's animosity was that it had vanished for a while. When Draco first moved in two years ago, she had apologised to Harry for wanting to hand him to Voldemort and he had willingly forgiven her. She had been almost friendly and had encouraged Draco and Harry to work out their differences.
"It is. And I'm hungry. Shall we get something warm to eat?"
Robards twisted his lips in a knowing smile. “Fair enough. Weasley, you work with Miss Bey.”
In that moment, Harry no longer cared about wrong moves or consequences. He only cared about those lips and that tongue. The space between them vanished and their chests were pressed close as their lips met for the first time. Malfoy’s lips were soft and warm despite the cold, dry air, and Harry hoped his own chapped lips wouldn’t put him off.
“I'm fine, Potter.  He was benign.”
“Why do you think we wanted someone from Substances?”
have a report to write.
Hermione was very sympathetic to his plight and arranged for him to be able to work from home. She brought him every file and document he needed from the Ministry and filled him in on each meeting he missed. His supervisor didn't seem to care so long as Hermione was checking in on him and the reports were being done. Draco had actually grown rather fond of spreading his paperwork across the large kitchen table and having the kettle to hand for easy tea refills. It was warmer, cosier, and quieter than his cramped Ministry office.
"Argh!!!!"
Draco felt his eyes widen. Potter had admitted attraction, and the tender kisses and hand holding had hinted at more, but Draco was still shocked to hear Potter all but confess to liking him. Afraid of being wrong, Draco schooled his features and decided to see where things went.
Potter sucked on his collarbone and Pansy left his thoughts completely. Draco pulled back and captured Potter's mouth with his own. Maybe they'd shag that night or maybe they would just enjoy amazing kisses. Draco didn't care. He just loved the feel of Potter's body pressed against him and the heat of their mouths together.
Draco opened his eyes and saw Potter with a quill resting against the book in his lap. He was equal parts smug and disturbed than he knew Potter so well.
He could do this.  He'd planned everything out to avoid as much human contact as possible.  It was just like going to the Healer or showering in Gryffindor.
Whatever Draco was doing over the past few years, it clearly included flying. He had always been naturally graceful on a broom, but the way he took to the Ministry broom as if he’d flown it for years spoke of experience.
“Come here, Harry. Stand up.” Draco’s words were insistent but so gentle. Once Harry was standing, Draco wrapped him in his arms and pressed kisses into his neck. “That was so good, Harry. So good.” Harry felt his cheeks heat and his chest swell at Draco’s words.
wanted to go to Romania and work with dragons, and if being civil to Malfoy was what it took, so be it.
A ripple of excitement ran down Harry's spine and spread into his stomach.  "Only if you join Luna and me for dinner."
Harry startled to realise that he had not only lost sight of Malfoy, he had let Malfoy sneak up behind him. He ignored the additional realisation that he could recognise Malfoy's voice from one word after seven years apart.
Best to move on to lubrication, then. He hoped Potter had some, because he certainly hadn't thought to bring any. When asked, Potter crawled up to his nightstand and pulled out a tube. Draco squeezed a huge amount onto his hand and it slipped through his fingers and down his arm onto Potter's rug. Shit. He quickly rubbed some of it onto himself to stop the dripping. Potter had moved back into his position at the end of the bed with his arse displayed for Draco's benefit, so Draco pressed one slick finger between the globes of Potter's arse and began to push in. Potter tightened immediately.
* * *
He heard a pop and Potter instructing an elf to change Draco’s bedding. There were mentions of food, too, but Draco just thought about the softness of the sheets and of Potter’s voice. It all felt very safe and comforting, so he slipped back to sleep.
'I don't mean now!' His voice sounded a little panicked, so he took a breath before starting again. 'I mean, I worked damn hard to plan this party, and I want you to enjoy it. I know how you love parties, especially ones centred on you.' He'd loved kissing Draco, but he didn't want to rush into too much that night.
It didn't help that Pansy and Blaise had finally stopped dancing around each other and were now trying to make up for lost time.  He glared to his side where Pansy was now straddling Blaise in her attempts to suck his soul out through his mouth.
“You saw the sitting room and kitchen,” Malfoy stated without turning around, and Harry wondered where the kitchen had been. Malfoy stopped at a corridor with three doors on one side and a fourth at the end. “First door is a closet,” he gestured lazily ahead with a long pale finger. “Next is a bath. You’re the third, and I’m at the end.” Malfoy spoke clearly and with no hint of emotion. He walked to the third door and opened it before stepping aside to let Harry enter his new room.
observational skills at all, you’d be able to see that he’s completely arse over tit for Lovegood.”  He stormed off in the direction of the rest of their group, and Harry was sure the words muttered under his breath were nothing but insults about Harry.
“I assume you have a bathroom?”
“Well, maybe I can find the energy for that.”
Harry fell to his knees on the rug without question. There in front of him was Malfoy’s crotch, the crisp grey fabric of his trousers hiding Malfoy’s cock inside. With fingers that felt thick and clumsy, Harry undid the button and pulled down the zipper. Malfoy’s cock was still covered in the smooth black material of his pants, but it was clearly full and straining forwards against the fabric.
* * *
'Race' was the first word that caught his eye, and a shiver ran down his back. Draco had learned to fly before he could walk, and his body had never showed the same talent on the ground that it displayed in the air. He could run, physically, but it wasn't a particularly fast or graceful act. It was certainly nothing that he wanted to do competitively or with an audience.
When Ron found out Toby was gay, he’d suggested that Harry ask him out. Harry had quickly pointed out that he wasn’t attracted to Toby. That, and the fact that Toby only had eyes for older men, preferably built like lumberjacks.
“Hannah's working at the Leaky tonight,” Neville offered in a small, hopeful voice.  Harry laughed joyfully.  If Neville wanted to flirt with the girl he fancied, he should.
Ron walked in, setting down the bag of takeaway before stripping out of his soggy travel cloak and gloves. He passed Harry his curry and dropped into the chair opposite Harry’s desk with a conflicted look in his eyes. It was the look he always got when he wanted to talk about anything more serious than Quidditch scores but didn’t know how to broach the subject.
For once, Potter didn’t blush at all. He just smiled at Draco with tender eyes. "Yeah. Once I gave Pansy a chance and got to know her, she started talking about you all the time. I liked her stories and realised I should give you a chance, too. And, well, I liked talking with you even more than Pansy's stories about you."
Draco sighed in clear annoyance, then leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s. Caught off guard, Harry might have made an embarrassing sound before seizing the opportunity to put his hands on Draco’s waist and pull him closer.
Draco looked gobsmacked for a moment before his face contracted in a familiar scowl. “Bollocks. That throws the field wide open again.” He pulled the parchment back as he got up from the desk and began pacing. “Okay, forget sun. Let’s look at heat.”
It was a quiet three days, during which Draco tried his best to pretend he was entirely alone. Potter seemed to be enjoying the same fantasy.
will bake them.” Harry said in the firm voice he used when the children misbehaved. “Astoria sent very detailed instructions that even I can’t mess up." Harry was actually a rather good baker, but Draco always assumed that Harry couldn’t do anything that shared skills with Potions. He guided Draco over to the couch and draped a tartan blanket over him. "
Harry wasn’t sure how he had become the villain in this tale, but he was getting more than a little annoyed.
Potter scowled and pressed the hair over his brow again.  “Scar,” he grumbled.  Was Potter really hiding his scar?  Was that why he let his hair grow out so oddly?  Potter had taken hold of Draco's hand and was holding it against his cheek.  The soppy gesture made Draco self-conscious and he glanced around to see if anyone had noticed.  Weasley and Granger were speaking softly to each other and seemed oblivious to the rest of the room.  Longbottom was over at the bar looking like a rejected puppy and mooning over a Hufflepuff from their year.
Footsteps announced Harry’s arrival before he entered. He was dressed in an old t-shirt and flannel bottoms that were frayed where his heels stepped on the hem. His damp hair explained his absence from the kitchen when Draco first arrived, although Harry usually was showered and making drinks by the time Draco got off work.  Harry’s greeting was cursory--his kiss barely making contact with Draco’s skin--before he started on about the cat.

constellation,” she explained in that voice of hers that made Harry think she really ought to be a professor at some point; she was McGonagall’s natural successor.  “His name
Draco lapped at his cock and then sucked it down again with an excitement he usually reserved for éclairs. Oh, fuck. Harry would never be able to watch Draco eat an éclair again. At least not in public. It was the image of Draco sucking the crème out of his favourite pastry that had Harry coming in Draco's mouth.
* * *
Harry let go. "No! No.
Draco had assumed that his difficulties with making peace with Harry would begin once they spoke. What he hadn’t anticipated was that he would be unable to speak to him at all. When he had sought Harry out in the Auror office, Harry had scooped up a memo, waved it about with some comment about an emergency, and then fled. Three times.
“G?” Harry questioned under his breath.  He could feel Malfoy’s chuckle through their touching arms.
Rolling his eyes, Draco pushed Potter away but was secretly pleased. "Egg, Potter. And toast. Golden brown with real butter. Tea goes without saying. I suppose it's too much to hope you have something other than teabags."
He silently finished bundling up against the cold and led Draco to the supply cupboard that housed the Auror brooms with built-in Notice-Me-Not Charms.
Did he really think Harry held a grudge after all this time? Well, Harry would put right to that. “How is Park—Pansy these days? I heard she didn’t return to Hogwarts.”
“Honestly, Potter. What did you think I did when I left?” Harry knew Draco had left England after Hogwarts, but there had been no word about where he’d gone or what he was doing.  Harry had never considered that Draco might have gone to another school after Hogwarts. “I earned three more N.E.W.T.s,” Draco went on, “as befits my intellect. I have eleven now.” Draco lifted his nose and smiled smugly. “I did so well, my professor asked me to stay on and research with him.”
“No.  I want to talk,” Harry stated.

Tuisku barks his greeting to the visitors and Aamu follows. Mielikki is there, her smile warm as her heart. At her side is Kauko. He looks hesitant until he sees Aamu smiling at him and then he smiles. She has waited to meet him. To watch the legend continue.
He laughed. “It would be a refreshing change if you did.”
As he heard Merryn answer the phone, he looked down at the nearly blank page for April and wondered which of the few remaining reservations would be cancelled next.
The little tree didn’t glow and flash like the charmed trees in the castle, but it was stunning in its own right. Harry turned to the side and took in the satisfaction and contentment on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy was proud of himself. He was proud of his accomplishment.
kind of virgin. He hadn't so much as snogged since Ginny three years ago. He had no idea—other than his fingers in the shower—what he was supposed—
“Is there a problem?”
“Nothing important.”  She glanced at her desk with disinterest.  “It'll all get done in the end.  Oh!  I wanted to book my Portkey.”  She stood up and gathered her things.  “You’re welcome to take a look,” she said, gesturing dismissively at her desk.
. Not that the fur was the worst thing currently on that counter. The way the
"So … um …" He wasn't sure what to say, but standing around wasn't helping and he
They were falling.
Draco nodded sleepily, and let Harry Apparate him to a soft bed and quiet.
“Tails and steak?  What are you on about?”
Harry crossed to Draco and knelt by his feet until Draco looked at him.  “If your mother will welcome Teddy, son of a werewolf and grandson of a Muggleborn, I think Andromeda will believe that she’s really changed.  And if Teddy
. It's not healthy because you clearly have
Draco rolled his eyes but climbed into bed beside Harry. “They aren’t ancient. Medieval at best.” He looked Harry up and down with feigned disinterest. “Nothing happens after six dates, but at some point my parents will expect a visit.”
Draco's first memory of Christmas is of presents. He remembers Grandfather Malfoy trying to draw his attention to the realistic details of the model Hogwarts Express he had given Draco, but Draco had been too enamoured of his new toy wand. The wand didn't really channel his magic, and he wasn't really casting spells, but the sparks that shot from the end when he waved it felt like an omen of the powerful wizard he would grow to be. Draco had never once worried he might be a Squib because his father had always assured him that the Malfoy line couldn't make Squibs. Squibs were what happened to families that mixed with Muggles: a worthy punishment for those who did not appreciate the superiority of their heritage.
"Not everyone limits themselves to a bedroom.” Her tone was losing her haughtiness as she gave in to her anger. "If Neville and I want to shag in the kitchen, we're damn well going to. It's
"Fuck you." Potter was smiling, and it almost sounded like an offer.
“I’ll take ingredients, Sir.” Harry looked right at Robards so he would miss Ron’s and Draco’s reactions. “I was much better at Herbology than Potions.”
The message had to be just right. The jeans showed that he was progressive and pro-Muggle. The pale blue shirt and grey jumper were to flatter his colouring and accentuate his eyes. The blazer was to give him a touch of formality to show that he took the party—and thus Pansy and Longbottom's relationship—seriously. The dragonhide boots were to give a hint of rebellion in case Potter liked bad boys.
"And does alcohol still lead to snogging blokes at parties?" Draco arched a brow but made sure to keep his lips curved in a smile. He hoped he looked playful and relaxed despite his heart pounding in his chest as he waited for Potter's answer.
* * *
Draco dipped his head. “Touché. I’m impressed, Potter.”
Their legs moved in tandem, propelling them forward faster than before. They were like one body moving together with the grace of a single mind. Unfortunately, Draco's natural grace in running had not improved completely over the past few weeks, and his outer foot stumbled. He tried to catch himself with his bound foot, but only succeeded in pulling Potter off balance. They staggered to the side, stumbling from the flat field into the small valley that ran along side it.
Occasionally Potter shouted out in terror or anger. Other times, he clutched Draco’s leg and sobbed against his thigh. It was very awkward, but Draco took comfort that Potter was simply fevered and unlikely to remember anything. He helped Potter take a Chill Out Potion, but the fever persisted, and Potter burned and sweated through the night.
“That’s all you’re getting until you buy me dinner.” Draco took a step away and adjusted his cloak. “You only got that because I am counting lunch as a first date.”
The seven Weasleys were seated at the kitchen table and they fell silent for only a moment before each of them was calling questions at him. It took ages before they told him the tale of Harry, Ron, and Hermione walking in for an early lunch to find Draco collapsed on the floor with only the faintest pulse. They had quickly ripped the constrictive robes away and it was then that Draco briefly regained consciousness.
Harry just smiled. It might have been a daft sort of smile given the look Tom gave him along with his change. Good thing Hannah wasn’t anywhere to be seen. She certainly would have had a comment or two for him.
"Morning," Potter murmured. His hand ran down Draco's arm and around his waist, pulling their bodies together.
“Don’t you dare!” Draco called after her. “Stay out of my kitchen.”
'No one.' Her voice was flat and she remained turned away.
Potter’s snort broke the tension, and Draco gave him a lazy smile.
It was amazing enough that they got along at all given their history, and their version of
Luckily, Malfoy didn’t seem to mind. He smiled as he led Harry to the Floo. “Keep the clothes you’re wearing. You finally look like an adult.” His brow lowered as he frowned. “I shouldn’t have Vanished your old clothes. I should have put them on trial for crimes against humanity and then
Harry thought back to their brief kiss on the street and realised he didn’t care, madness or not.
“Mean what?”
The ground did not swallow Harry up.  It never did.  Stupid ground.  So Harry was forced to look up into Malfoy's face and accept the ridicule and scorn.  Except it wasn't there.  Malfoy's lips were quirked to one side, but it was simple mirth without malice.  More significant was the dark and hungry look in his eyes.  He had caught Harry looking, and he liked it.
“Why not a pastry shop?”
of us immediately.”
* * *
“Sorry.”
He didn't need to look up from his book to know it was Pansy who had marched out of his Floo and across his wood floor onto the Persian rug that was the centrepiece of his living room. He knew the sound of those ridiculous heels she wore whenever she wasn't in the garden, and he could tell from the rhythm she tapped into his floor that the apology he was due would not be offered.
” he could almost hear Draco scold.  Harry took a resentful bite and felt some satisfaction as crumbs sprinkled down on the fabric below him. Draco wasn't there to notice.
Draco raised a pale forearm. His right one, Harry noted. “This complexion goes straight from white to pink to red, Potter. There is no such thing as a tan Malfoy. And trust me, the pink isn’t cute and the red is atrocious. Sun Protection Charms are as much part of my morning ritual as cleaning my teeth and putting on socks.” Having made his point, he dropped his hand back to his pint.
Weasley rolled his eyes.  “Reading about the case.  The report talks about the symptoms of the abusers.  Although you can start with the apothecary thefts if you'd think that'd be better.  I don't really care, so long as you can tell us what the potion is and help us catch these guys.”
Astoria passed him another biscuit. She knew how he loved lemon biscuits. "Well, if it really doesn’t work out in England, you can always move to Italy with Luca and me." She pinched Scorpius’ cheek lightly. "I’d get to see more of my favourite nephew."
Potter asked what he wanted for breakfast. That was new.
He carefully removed himself from bed without disturbing Potter and walked to the mirror over the sink. His eyes were red-rimmed and shadowed in pale purple. His face was very pale while his nose, cheeks, and lips were flushed.
“Z-H-I, ignoramus.  Not the letter.”
Shit. Why hadn’t he grabbed Potions? “Just thought I’d read ahead a bit. N.E.W.T.s and all.”
Harry was having none of it.  He let his determination show in his eyes, and Draco looked a bit wary.  In fact, he seemed afraid to be left alone with Harry, judging by how much later he stayed at the table than most nights.  Harry and Draco were usually the first to retire, but now Dave and they were the only ones left.
. It made him oddly nostalgic for boyhood days at Hogwarts.
* * *
The twitch of her lip suggested that she was happy indeed. "I told you to post a divorce announcement in the
Draco was murmuring something as he leaned forward and stroked the dragon’s snout. After several long moments, Draco gestured to Harry to approach. Harry took cautious steps forward. “Stoop as you get closer,” Draco instructed firmly, and Harry slumped his shoulders automatically. “And speak quietly and reverently. To him and me.”
Ron sat up straight and scowled.  “But he’s a pompous git!”
Malfoy was hard. For Harry. A rush of relief ran through Harry as he realised how much he had wanted Malfoy to feel what he felt.
Pansy was nodding, but it was the humouring type and not a sign of agreement. "You are overlooking some differences between you and Macmillan that might be relevant. Macmillan was a war hero. He was in Harry's little club in fifth-year.
Draco smiled widely.  “I’ll be winning that bet.”  Secretly, Harry hoped he did.
Forcing his gaze back up, he met Draco’s eye. Draco’s lips were tugged to the side in obvious amusement, and a single eyebrow lifted as if to say,
Draco’s smug grin was back, and Harry realised he would do anything to keep it there. “You ask someone who worked with it for years before it became illegal.” He gathered his file and gave a little salute. “Until tomorrow.”
Potter muttered something about high-maintenance before offering a shower. Draco accepted and it took them a good hour to make it out of Potter's flat.
Kensa was facing him and showed only a moment of annoyance at his interruption before she recognised him and changed completely. “Oh, Mr Potter! Yes, can you believe it? How is it allowed? How can such a vile man be allowed to run a hotel? He’s ruining my brother’s wedding!”
As they strolled the tidy formal garden, Harry tried to focus on Malfoy’s words. He was saying something about a charitable garden party he and a friend helped organise each year, but Harry could only hear the smooth tone of his voice and the way he pronounced the Latin names of flowers with a French accent. Harry wondered if Malfoy would help him with his own garden at home. Neville had helped some, but he didn’t understand that Harry was more interested in how the flowers looked and smelled than in what they could do. In fact, Harry would rather they not do
She steps back and smiles.
A key dangled in his face, and he saw Abbott smiling at him. "I'm psychic," she teased as he took the key. "Goes with the job."
“I spend time with Rolf because he is good company, Potter.  I’m not a dragon that only seeks company to copulate.”
Harry hated seeing Draco look disappointed. He was so enticing when he was smug. “Well, you said it can’t be near magic without destroying it. Since no one has reported charms suddenly failing in certain areas...”
Potter opened his eyes at Draco’s voice. He looked from the potion to the glass before meeting Draco’s eye. He looked defensive, so Draco cut off any protests against weakness.
, but Draco was completely mistaken. Harry was starting to suspect he could definitely come to need Draco.
Draco was trying to decide what to feel about Potter's sudden departure.  Embarrassment?  Disappointment?  Anger?  A glance at Rosie showed no surprise.  “Does he do that often?”
Harry felt his face flush as he wondered if he could indeed die of mortification.  He was currently lying flat on his back, completely frozen with a pink dildo still fucking his hole.  “Stop,” he instructed the dildo in a broken voice.  The dildo stopped and Harry fumbled to pull it out.  His face burned with his humiliation.
“What?” Harry wasn’t sure what they were even talking about anymore.
Silly thing. Of course his plan would work. It had six stages formulated to prevent any risk of failure. He would carefully infiltrate Harry's social circle and slowly earn his trust. Once they were friends, he would choose subtle gestures to introduce an element of romance to their relationship. Once Potter was devoted to him, Draco would seduce him. The whole thing would surely take months—maybe a year—but in the end Potter would be thoroughly shagged and free of the burdens of his virginity.
Harry was about to say yes when he thought of Teddy.  He hadn’t seen the boy since the summer and hated the thought of spending the holidays without him.  “Let me think about it.”  He didn’t think to check Draco’s expression as he rushed to his room to find his mobile phone.
Draco ran a hand down his chest and over his stomach as his relaxation gave way to interest in his fantasy.
Holding Draco in his arms, with two of his friends’ by his side, and Teddy and Scorpius in bed upstairs, Harry felt he had rather a lot to celebrate. He kissed Draco back, deepening the kiss to feel Draco’s tongue move against his own. He pulled back enough to see Draco’s face shining with pride and excitement. "Yes, let’s.”
Draco had briefly considered skipping work, but it would not do to admit shame or defeat. He would face the abuse about his fall just as he had faced it for being on the losing side of the war: with his head held high.
to be Head Auror?"
hadn’t cheated on his wife. He was
“Well he obviously didn’t meet the owner!” Kensa hissed. “I can’t believe that filth wasn’t thrown in Azkaban. The Ministry claim they cleaned up the Death Eaters, but at least one of them is still out there ruining your wedding!”
"I'll cook."
Harry couldn't stop the grin that was now making his cheeks ache.  “I'm glad to have been of service.  And I'm so glad you approve of my choice of boyfriend.”
“Hold on. Hold on. You’re okay. Here come lie in my bed. It’s cleaner.”
“Aren’t you going to invite me in?” She was twirling a strand of smooth black hair around her finger and looking up at him coyly, but he wasn’t having it.
It felt like Draco was drowning. Fluid was filling his lungs and no amount of coughing got it free. He had already taken a Cough-No-More, but it was no longer working and he couldn’t take another dose for hours. He coughed into his handkerchief and checked the white fabric for blood. Nothing yet, but it was only a matter of time. He pulled a bottle of blood replenishing potion from the case Pomfrey had given them and set it by his bed.
Harry looked at the two figures reflected in the glass. Malfoy stood with straight shoulders and spine in a jumper that hugged his body despite the collared shirt beneath. His trousers draped neatly down his long legs before creasing once above his shiny leather shoes.
Harry schooled his face as blank as he could, but he couldn’t help noticing Draco’s argument against freeing elves had rested on his elf’s feelings. Draco could act as callous as he liked, but Harry could tell he cared.
"No one … Are you sure?" The man's voice sounded very small and barely carried to Draco's ears over the drumming of the rain.
Harry blinked himself from his fantasy as he realised that Draco’s plate was empty and he was delicately wiping his fingertips on his napkin. The meal was over. Now Draco would leave. Harry wished he’d planned more courses.
Of course, they all knew that whoever solved their own mystery first would make life much easier for the others. Not that Harry was working alone. When he got home, he owled Ron’s findings to Draco.
“You are always right, Aida,” Draco murmured into her shoulder.
“Just walking Draco to his desk,” Harry replied as he wrapped an arm around Draco's waist and gave a squeeze.
"That's great!"  Luna sounded like she really believed it and was finally looking at Harry again.  "I'm a bit behind on dinner, so why don't you go over to Draco's and catch up.  I'll come by when dinner is ready."
The man extended a meaty hand. “Jens, Jens Karlsen.” Harry shook Jens’ hand and took the firm warmth as a good omen. “Let’s get you settled.” Jens put the broom in the shed and then led Harry up the village's only road.
Draco shook his head and dropped his napkin. "No, thank you." The disappointment weighed on Harry until he noticed Draco walking towards him with a hungry look in his eye. He kissed Harry hard, his mouth still sweet from the cannoli. When he pulled back, he tenderly cupped Harry’s cheek. "Thank you for dinner, Harry. I had a wonderful time." He placed his lips to Harry’s once more before pulling away and heading for the door. Harry automatically followed as if his body could not be more than a metre from Draco’s. His mind whirled as he wondered what the next step for them was but worried to press Draco for too much too soon.
“Auror Potter.  What brings you to Substances?” Sothman asked in the sycophantic tone he saved for those who might prove a powerful ally or threat.
Draco briefly imagined Potter being brought back to McGonagall’s bedroom and grimaced. At least it was more evidence that Rita Skeeter’s bullshit about Potter and Dumbledore having an affair was total rot. Not that Draco had believed it. Potter had all but walked around Hogwarts with a badge on his chest flashing “fumbling virgin.” At least until the Weasley girl took him up. Draco found himself scowling again, and realised Potter was watching him nervously.
She pointed to his parchment with one of her bright red nails. "Three-legged race with Harry. You have to tie your legs together."
Snape was leading Draco down a hallway to the Charms classroom. He was shouting about Draco’s oboe and how irresponsible it was for Draco to have Transfigured it into the Eiffel Tower. Draco had no idea what to reply, but then Dumbledore was there talking about Irish Dancing and Snape was hitching up his robes to properly demonstrate a step.
to, rather than for power or fame.”
The plan!
Harry smirked at the thought of Draco being out of bed so early on a Saturday, especially without tea in his belly. Even the
“That's right,” Blaise cooed.  He shifted Draco's weight to his left arm and began fumbling with Draco's robes with his right.  His hand reached Draco's trousers and began fumbling with the top button.  Was he seriously planning on fucking Draco right there?  Yes, Draco wanted to have sex—someday—but losing his virginity against the wall of a Ministry loo was not on .
Draco rolled his eyes behind her back.  “As if anyone else would want those gaudy baubles anyway.”  Harry snickered and received a sharp grin from Draco in return.
Several Weasleys met them at the door of their twisty, creaky home. Seven, to be precise: the Muggle obsessed father, the one with Greyback's scars, the dragon tamer, the Ministry boot-licker, the twin who was no longer one of two, Granger's Weasley, and … Ginny. Draco had actually grown rather fond of the youngest Weasley now that her Hexes were on his side.
As he turned to the bar, he heard Potter mumble, “m'kay, Draco.”  Had Potter just used his given name?  It must have been the first time ever.   He had certainly never heard it.  Why now?  Why when he was drinking?
"But why?"
* * *
'Just tell me!' Harry barked. He was very close to ripping at his hair.
Harry turned to face his friend and then turned back to Draco to see what Ron saw. Draco was dancing with a Czech dignitary. The man was tall and handsome, and clearly an accomplished dancer. He kept pace with Draco perfectly, and Harry saw the delight on Draco's face to be able to challenge himself.
Draco looked slightly awkward at they entered the pub, but did not object to eating amongst the Muggles. He drank his cider without comment and thanked the server who brought them their sandwiches.
From there the night settled into banter and conversation. There was plenty of ribbing and insults, but each was soothed with further drink and smug smiles. By the time Tom called last orders, Draco could admit that he was enjoying himself. His former enemies were surprisingly good company.
Leah, who had been sitting with her back to him, turned to face him with wide eyes. “Hermione Granger? She goes there?”
Potter bit his lower lip, making Draco uncomfortably aware of how soft and red it looked. "That's a good question. I know he wants someone young, especially as he wants a couple more years to train them before he steps down. He likes me because I lived through the war first hand, and some of the younger or foreign Aurors didn't really get that close. But Ron is a lot better at the networking and policy crap than I am. Plus, he knows the wizarding world in a way I still don't."
He was grateful that the road was surprisingly free of rocks, because no clothes meant nothing protecting his feet.  It had also meant no obvious place to stow his wand, so he clutched it awkwardly by his side lest someone think he was on the attack.
“Snob,” Harry responded with a smile.
Draco didn't see Potter again for the rest of the week.  No “thank you for the impressive report.”  No follow-up questions.  No details about Friday's dinner plans.  Nothing.
Idiot.
Even as he thought it, he knew the idea didn't really have any appeal.  Shagging?  Yes.  Shagging everyone in the Ministry?  No.  He was picky—no— selective.  He needed to find someone worth his time, but Blaise was right about the advantages of doing so promptly.
“You know,” Harry cleared his throat. “Um, people usually bring dates to weddings, right? I’m sure my invitation said plus one.”
Draco rolled his eyes at his mother offering her approval. "I’m not asking you for his hand, mother. It’s dinner. I’m just trying to make things civil so we can be at events together.
It was hard to tell in the dark, but he thought Draco rolled his eyes as he mumbled some gentle insults.
Or maybe Potter wasn't disgusted but Granger and the Weasel were. Maybe they would—
Malfoy completely missed Harry's attempt to lighten the mood.  "Yes, actually.  Just as I was raised to define a person by their family, I was raised to do so by what they wore.  Clothing can share obvious information like one's profession and rank, but it can also provide more subtle information about cultural norms, wealth, and connections."  Malfoy's eyes fell to the floor, and Harry was relieved to be free of their intensity.  "I can't simply get dressed in the morning without being aware that I am making a deliberate statement."
"So what d'ya say, Malfoy? Can we get along long enough not to embarrass ourselves in front of the entire Ministry?"
Harry nodded and shoved a large spoonful of ice cream into his mouth. Yes, it was Butterbeer. It was sweet and creamy, but completely unsatisfying. He managed another bite.
Draco meant to say, but what came out was a serious of sounds even Draco couldn’t piece together. He hoped they sounded scathing anyway.
He lost himself to the bright light and the rushing in his ears.  Sweat was dripping into his eyes, causing them to sting.  He ran the back of his hand across his eyes and realised he still had some of Draco's semen on his cheek.  He would have laughed, but his body was spent.  It took the remains of his energy to pull out gently from Draco's body before collapsing next to him on the bed.
Draco's mind filled with thoughts about the Abbott family's mediocre standing and wealth or how the particular witch was as plain as she was pretty, but he knew those things meant nothing to Longbottom. From the look on Longbottom's face, it was clear that he was happy in a way that Draco
Then Malfoy tugged again at Harry’s hair as he mumbled something incoherent and came down Harry’s throat. Harry sucked at him as he softened, marvelling at the way Malfoy barely kept his feet and shuffled closer to the wall. When he made a whine of protest, Harry released him to focus on his own needs. He pulled his jeans open and grabbed himself.
He had originally made contact with Luna and her father as a political move to improve his reputation, but Luna had decided they were to be friends. Surprised to be offered an invitation by someone who wasn't Goyle or Pansy, Draco had actually found himself accepting offers of meals and walks in the countryside. His head often hurt after talking with her for too long, but he had the feeling it was somehow good for him.
The next year was Draco's first Christmas away from home. He had been proud that his father had told him about the Chamber of Secrets and tasked him with monitoring and reporting on the situation at Hogwarts. He didn't let his father see how disappointed he was not to go home to his own room, the obedient elves, and his mother's adoration. He knew what his father thought of
Now, having delivered their three suspects to the holding cells and the contents of the lab to the evidence room, he stood in Robards' office receiving the man's rare praise.  Ron and Neville beamed beside him.
“It’s my blood on your hands if you’re wrong, Gawain.” The witch’s voice was sharp, but she lowered her hood to reveal a shrewd face with a large nose surrounded by a mass of grey curls.
He picked up the round fruit and turned it in his hand to appreciate the flawless skin and bright colour. Curious if the taste matched the appearance, he took a bite. The sound was a clear crunch and then tart juice with a hint of sweetness filled his mouth. He chewed slowly enjoying the flavour.
“I swear, Malfoy, if I wet myself because you’re having a leisurely wank—”
Draco coughed and gave him a pointed look before flipping open his copy of the file and beginning to read. Not wanting to appear useless, Harry opened his own file at his desk and did the same.
He didn't know how long they kissed, but the room seemed much quieter when they pulled back enough to rest their foreheads together.
“No, but I’m tired.”
Potter’s face was flush and his eyes were hazy as if he were half in a trance or dream. "Yeah. I think I'll be relaxed if you're sucking on me." Potter handed him the tube of lube again, and Draco managed to keep the lube in his hand this time. He sucked Potter’s cock back into his mouth as he gently ran a slick finger over Potter’s hole.
“I didn’t think I’d ever like an orange scarf, and that’s coming from a Cannons fan.”

"I won't be disappointed, Pansy. Do remember that
him to know your family.
He’d been sure his interest would ease once he was busy with Auror training, but somehow Hermione’s visits to London always included an update on how Draco and the other Slytherins were adjusting back at Hogwarts. And when Harry went to Hogwarts to visit her and his other friends, he couldn’t help but search the halls for tall, pale blonds.
They were listening to Charlie tell an exciting story about his narrow escape from a Horntail that winter, but Harry found his mind wandering as he gazed out over Ron and Hermione’s back garden.  He loved Charlie’s stories, but they also made him ache for the outdoors and adventure he had found surprisingly lacking in the Aurors.
Draco had yet to resist this odd witch who looked enough like him to be family and yet was nothing like him at all. "I promise."
Because surely he was dead.
Draco continued his defence of the size of what they were baking, but he did a poor job hiding he was enjoying the argument. Harry would have been happy to stay there watching the three person scene play out, but he suddenly realised he could be caught eavesdropping. He knocked on the door and pushed it open more. “Hello? Sorry to interrupt.”
* * *
. Well that answered that. One of the house elves wiped Abbott’s face as they finally led the girls away.
“You're going to have to give it up eventually,” Blaise said.  “Why not let me fuck you?  I'm handsome, charming, and strong.  And I can keep the others away.  You'd be all mine.”  Blaise's eyes flashed possessively as he rolled his hips forward.  Draco was completely aware of the large, heavy cock pressed against the crease of his thigh and groin.  He knew Blaise was hung—everyone who had shared their dorm knew that—but now that Blaise's cock was so very near his arse he began to panic.
Potter kissed him softly on the brow. "Of course. I've fancied you for months. I'm not going to give up just because our first attempt at sex hit a bump."
They exchanged awkward greetings and sat together at the one set table Draco had been fuss—preparing. Draco’s trouser’s had barely touched the velvet seat before Merryn came gliding in with two champagne flutes. Potter stared at the pink bubbly liquid with a childlike curiosity. Draco was glad he’d told Aida to keep it simple if Potter was looking at a Kir Royale as if it were new and amazing.
"You still live at the Manor then?"
"Tomorrow?"
Draco looked sheepish, and he and Harry allowed themselves to be led to a little table in the back of Aida’s kitchen where she set out plates and cutlery for them. Cheeses and fruits flew onto a platter from different parts of the room as Aida brought over a flaky golden baguette, sweet-smelling sliced ham, and two types of pâté.
Patil was rather a clever witch and caught on immediately. “We will be fine,” she announced as she took Abbott’s side and wrapped an arm around her. Draco knew his friend Nott was rather taken with the sensible Patil sister, and he was finally understanding why.
Harry pushed open the large oak door and stepped out of the castle. A cold breeze met him, rustling his hair and pinking his cheeks. As he pulled his cloak tighter around himself, he conceded that he should have listened to Hermione and worn a hat. But time was an issue.
One moment he was listening in rapt attention as some gasbag told a tale. The next, he was flirting with a young woman with buck-teeth and bushy hair who looked like an alternative-universe version of Hermione.  A moment later he was telling a story that had even the grumpiest member of the Wizengamot laughing and wiping his eyes.
'Git,' Harry mumbled against Draco's lips, but Draco pulled back to look over Harry's chest and stomach.
"Don't be sorry. I just panicked a bit. I just need a bit more time."
Well, at least he's alive .  Draco leant over and brushed the soot off the other man.  “Come on, Potter.  Let's get you to bed.”  He helped him to his feet.  “Which way's the bedroom?”
Potter opened the buttons of Draco's shirt without breaking the kiss, but they separated for Draco to pull Potter's t-shirt off. They fumbled with each other's trousers before switching to their own. Draco dropped his trousers and pants as easily as if he were at home in his own room readying for bed. This would be easy.
Oh.  Right.  Getting Potter to shag him.
What if he remembered and was disgusted? Would he say Draco took advantage of him? Potter had been drinking the whole night, but he had never seemed too deep in his cup. But maybe he was one of those drunks who seemed sober.
, the Weasel—fuck, he was supposed to call him
It took a long moment for Draco's brain to process Potter's words. Potter had planned pre-dinner shag time into their evening? It was certainly unexpected, but who was Draco to complain about Potter trying to get on his cock? Plan be damned, Draco was going to see this through. "I did think that four was an ungodly hour for dinner."
He chose a more subtle vantage point when he returned, and saw Draco standing with Jason Flintridge. Flintridge was very handsome with curly brown hair, jewel-blue eyes, and a disarming smile. Draco and Hermione had often commented on the young wizard's popularity in the Ministry.
