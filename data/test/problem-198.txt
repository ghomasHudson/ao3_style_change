‘Long, but we’ve started on Redcaps with the third years, that’s always fun.’
‘Not really.’ Harry said with a smile. The place looked amazing. There were drawings all over the place. Missy was clearly very talented. She also looked pretty much exactly like what Harry expected a tattoo artist to look like.
‘Oh crap, it was the labyrinth wasn’t it.’ Ron asked softly. ‘Shit mate, I should have known that would be bad for you.’ Harry waved him off.
‘We’re still young and
Harry had frozen with his fork halfway to his mouth.
As the court proceedings started, Harry was once again happy he’d decided that politics weren’t for him, because this was
‘Pansy, Daphne, Blaise, Greg, maybe Millie if she’s got the day off. I’m never sure.’ Draco shrugged. Right, so basically the Slytherins in their year. Harry was being invited to have lunch with all the Slytherins in his year. He could almost hear Ron in the back of his mind “this is a terrible idea” he’d be saying, but when had Harry ever let
Harry burst into the nearly empty offices. Amelia was sitting in the breakroom, alone with a cup of tea.
“What?” Harry asks.
“It never feels like enough.”
Tell your mother I said thanks for saving my life and all that.
The clock is about to strike midnight, people are already pairing off for their New Year’s kiss and Harry doesn’t want any part of
. I’m not some emotionless martyr ready to be of service whenever you bloody well need me!” Harry’s grateful that this particular row is happening in the privacy of Ron’s dorm room. His roommate, Justin Finch-Fletchley, has already left for holiday leaving them with some semblance of privacy.
I mean, I get what you said about Snape. He was a bully, though. Especially to people like Neville. And even though he was in love with my mum he still went out of his way to put me down. I think he’s a bad person, who didn’t want my mum to die and then fell into a debt he owed Dumbledore - one he couldn’t pay back.
There’s a knock on the door, and everyone turns to see Blaise standing in the doorway, face serious and lips drawn into a hard line. “Draco.” His eyes shift back and forth between all three of them. “It’s Pansy.”
Draco nods his head, eyes trained on the floor, chin held high. “Okay.”
“Harder,” Draco says, sitting up. “Hit me harder.”
Malfoy,
“Not even on a date?” Harry says in jest, arms crossed across his chest.
“Yes, yes, Potter I’m well aware. I don’t mean anything by it,” Draco explains. “I do, however, mean to say that I truly doubt she’d keep this little secret under wraps, not for me of all people.”
Harry sits up, moves slowly, doing his best not to wake his friends. He stands, looking around the messy room.
“I want you,” says Draco. “I hate you.”
I think it’ll be Christmas by the time this letter reaches you, I’ll be at the Weasley’s for holiday. Will you be going home? Did you? If you didn’t, what about your mum?
“I’d like that very much, yes.”
“Of course.” Harry’s hands are pushing back Draco’s fringe. “I’ll send you love letters every day if you’d like.”
Draco,
“I love you,” Draco echos.
Christmas comes and goes, and they don’t worry about giving one another a gift because what better gift than your worship of another person’s body. Harry gets on his knees for Draco, sucks him off messily and he’s nervous about it — worried Draco won’t like it, but it proves to be a fruitless concern because Draco is loud and vocal about what he likes and he encourages Harry which makes Harry feel so good about himself, hearing Draco say things like
Dean’s sitting on the cobblestone sill, of all people, in Harry’s usual spot, Draco sat up next to him, cigarette between his two fingers. Harry blinks, clenches his fists, swallows down the bile in his throat. Dean is touching Draco, touching his face, touching the bruises Harry had left him with. Harry wants to break his fingers, push him away from Draco.
Malfoy sighs. “The red leather looks sexy on you Pansy, trust me. Potter here doesn’t know a thing about fashion.”
“Okay,” Harry says aloud, into the silence of his kitchen. He moves to wash the dishes, nodding his head now and again as his thoughts become linear with what he can do. It’s scary, he thinks, to love someone and know that there is a version of them you cannot touch. To love someone and know they have a wound that may never heal.
Coloured in their history, Harry sees with stark clarity what he has always been capable of. There is a version of them where Draco lays on a waterlogged floor bleeding, Harry above him. There is a version of them, the one that exists here and now, where Harry traces at the slightly raised skin, almost unnoticeable in the blur of candle-lit sight, raised and alive.
Harry blinks. “What?”
“Do you have dessert?”
That night, with his cheeks red with drink, Draco sits next to Harry on the couch, sharp grey eyes glazed over as he stares into Harry’s green ones.
Harry presses play on the clicker and together, they watch a happy movie.
“You know what they’re like,” Neville had explained. “Judgemental.” He brushed a hand through his hair. “Fuck, of all people, why do I have to like him? His friends bullied me, y’know, but he – and I –”
“They’re already dead.” Draco swallows harshly. “Please don’t fuck me,” he begs, hands coming to wrap around Harry’s wrists, pulling Harry’s hands away, pulling Harry’s body towards him. Pulling
“We went to the kitchens for a snack,” Harry confirms with a shrug.
Also, get this. Tom was an orphan (like me) and lived in the Muggle word before Hogwarts (also like me). Truth or Dare
“What’s up, Potter?” Parkinson says after whistling at him. “Draco says you’re cool now.”
“Maybe because he’s trying to get something in you,” Draco says, voice chiming in through bouts of his own laughter.
Hope you enjoy your holiday!
“Yes, that.” Draco looks at him, eyes devoid of any easily discernible emotion.
By the way, your tattoo looks amazing. The linework and shading are both incredible. I also got a tattoo recently, in honour of Sirius and Remus. Check out the polaroid I included. The moon is for Remus, and the Grim-looking dog is for Sirius, I also included his constellation.
Often.
, he says over and again. Harry’s body shakes with the overwhelming draw of it, with the burning heat that boils under his skin, turning him raw, burning his doubt away. Malfoy wants him and Harry finds a pleasure that twists his gut in the fact that Malfoy, someone who had hated him so vehemently, wants him just as desperately.
Lack of critical thinking on Harry's part (I'm joking, sorta)
Draco comes to him, and kisses him, and then flinches away from Harry’s touch. Every time. Harry can’t help but kiss him back, his mind will always fog with the easy desire of lust underneath the swirl of several complicated emotions that drive him to push Draco away.
Happy New Year! 1999 has been great so far, only one more year before we enter a new milenia, crazy right?
Draco,
“Mine?” Harry gasps.
“We’re going to a Muggle gay bar,” he had used the same tone he would use when discussing the weather. “I suppose it’ll be fun.”
“What about me? What about what I fucking need? Why don’t I get a say in anything? I’m not some bloody
Harry takes a long drag from his cigarette. “Don’t pretend to know me,” he says, leaning his head back and exhaling the smoke in his lungs.
Ok first of all, it's 2008 but they got 2021 social media bc...if you were around on twitter back in the day - those were the damn dark ages and we ain't goin back!
Blaise takes the crown-jewelled little spoon from the mirror and puts a little powder on it, snorting it with skilled ease. “Because it’s the new year,” he says, sniffing harshly, loudly, and handing the spoon off to Pansy.
Draco’s hold loosens, and he moves his hand to the middle of Harry’s chest, bracing himself against it. His head is tilted down, and he hides his face behind his almost shoulder length hair.
Harry feels a mess of things so tightly coiled in his chest, behind his heart; he can’t easily pick at one emotion and make peace with it. He wants to reach out to Malfoy and wonders why the three-pace distance between their beds feels like a cliff-dive away.
What is forgiveness anyway?
A few more rounds of Wizard’s Cup later and Harry’s feeling properly buzzed. It takes a lot for him to get drunk and he thinks he’s got a good hold of himself; maybe that’s why he feels like he’s not having any sort of fun.
Then Draco’s casting, and taking Harry’s throbbing cock into his hand, lining it up with his rim and teasing himself. Harry’s hovering above him, breath ragged and uneven, and his hips stutter and he’s thrusting in, and Draco’s mouth is falling open.
Harry doesn’t know when he makes it over to Draco, has no clue when he grabs onto the other man’s hips, all he knows is that he’s there and he’s touching
Harry’s head spins, desperate for release, desperately in love with Draco – Harry moves his hips, shifts his weight, pushing himself up with his free hand, now on his knees, grabbing at Draco’s thigh, the hand that still holds onto Draco’s squeezing harshly.
“Okay,” says Draco, finally looking at him.
They share a deep breath.
“Are you?”
“You know the ones… they play pictures with sound?” Draco gestures with his two pointer fingers, outlining a square in the air.
Ron nods, swallows the burn of grief in his throat. How many nights had they stayed up, cradling one another after fighting a war they were much too young for? This feels just like that. And yet, it feels so different from that too – maybe because their grief is further away from them now than it was back then, when everything was pain, when the world seemed darker; devoid of a brightness they both thought they’d never see again.
“That’s not true, Neville still talks to you,” Luna points out, pulling up the sleeves of her pink jumper. “Besides, I don’t really care that you’re sleeping with Draco Malfoy.”
, get inside me. Please.” Draco whines.
“I’ll keep you warm,” Draco says, moving even closer, leaning into Harry.
Harry doesn’t answer, instead choosing to slam their door shut and throw his books on the floor by his bed. He changes out of his school clothes, moving with fierce-short movements as he rips his clothes off him. Harry feels Malfoy’s light-grey eyes on him the whole time, and it sends a shiver of
“Sometimes, I wish there was a less messy way to travel between homes,” Draco says, taking his black over the shoulder bag and setting it down on the couch.
Harry leans in slowly, let’s Draco meet him in the middle, bringing their lips together in a soft greeting. In a warm hello. Harry cups Draco’s jaw, tilts his head, deepening the kiss with a lick at the other man’s bottom lip.
He decides on something simple: steak and rice. Steak that Kreacher always keeps chilled and fresh in the stasis charmed back-room of his kitchen, rice that comes in a little plastic bag, pre- washed and ready to cook. Everything is easy to make, all he needs to do is cut up some onions and cilantro, squeeze some fresh lemon, and the food is ready for him and Draco by the time Draco’s finished showering.
Harry has always been on the move, in constant motion, but now he stills even further. If this is what he must do to unravel the mystery of Draco’s actions, if this is what he must do to hold onto the softness that he knows exists between fractured lust-filled memories and the burning chill of the emptiness after Draco leaves him, then so be it. He tries not to think too hard on the why and move onto the
“You mean soda?”
Myrtle’s not in her bathroom as far as Harry can tell but Pansy and Draco are, sitting on the tiled windowsill, snorting Pixie Dust again.
“What do you mean?”
“It’s written all over your face,” Draco says, “how badly you want me.”
boy, he wasn't involved with this type of lifestyle until, of course, he started spending time with your son," Molly sounds disheartened.
Draco freezes and Harry notices the way his chest begins to fall and rise rapidly. “Is that what we’re doing?” Draco frowns. “Dating?”
I know you gave me the number for your landline (did Richard help you set that up?) but I think I’d still prefer sending you letters. That alright with you?
Blaise seems like an interesting guy, maybe Ginny would like him after all. She’s not my girlfriend, by the way. I don’t think I mentioned this to you earlier, but we broke up. We tried to get back together after the war, but it was like - well, like the spark was gone. She still comes and visits on her weekends, since she’s still at school and I’m living with Ron and Hemrione - just to make sure we’re all doing alright. But, I fell for her when I was a kid, and then I don’t know - dying and killing a man really would do a number on just about anyone. Sometimes, I think I came back wrong. I don’t know.
“You’re perfect,” Harry breathes, biting down into Draco’s neck. He sucks on a bruise he’d left just the night before and feels his orgasm slowly building. “
Hermione sniffs, closes her eyes, leans into her man, into the warmth of his touch.
Nott puts an arm around Draco and laughs into the blond man’s neck, burying his face in it. “Oh, you’re so dirty,” he says, pointing at Neville. “Draco, did you know, he’s been trying to get it out of me for weeks now.” Nott’s cackling, and the sound of it grates at Harry.
“Oh, I know.”
Harry has black spots in his vision and Draco’s legs are wrapped around his hips, holding him in place. With rapid, shallow breaths, Harry kisses up and down Draco’s sweaty neck. Licking in the salt and breathing in the smell of musk and the softer scent of lavender and myrrh.
Harry opens his eyes, unsure of when he closed them and drags his hands up Draco’s biceps, holding on tight, nails digging in. Harry wants to touch him everywhere and wraps his legs around Draco, moving in time with his thrusts and kissing up into his neck.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks. “Do you need anything?”
, it’s so good! Let me know if you like it!
Draco places a hand over Harry’s mouth. “Shhh,” he hisses. “It’s not – you aren’t responsible for me in that way.” He moves his hand away.
There is something wholly more intimate about Draco nuzzling into him, seeking his warmth, without pretence – Harry wonders if Draco can feel the spike in his heartbeat and then decides it’s alright, if he can.
Draco bristles and frowns. “No,” he says. He turns away then, his face pinched, and Harry knows he’s lost him to the thunderstorm that never stops raining inside the world of his mind.
, he’s inside Draco and his hole is warm and inviting, clenching around his finger.
“With me,” he’d say, later.
Draco’s friends do fuck off eventually, whispering to each other and making bedroom eyes at one another that makes it rather obvious what they’re fucking off to go do. Now, it’s just Harry and Draco and the drugs.
Draco,
Harry wants to yell at them to leave him alone, wants to run away from whatever this is.
Harry rises to his knees, grabbing at the bottle of lube at the foot of the bed, squeezing a generous amount onto the palm of his hand, wrapping his hand around himself, slicking himself up, using the excuse to wank himself a bit, memorising the sight of Draco as he lays like a prince waiting to be attended, head tilted, teeth on his knuckle, gently biting down.
“Oh, I love that one,” Draco said taking off his googles. “I’m always there on weekends.”
One minute left.
“You think?”
About the advice you passed onto Gin, she wanted me to thank you. She didn’t tell me what they talked about, but she says Blaise really opened up to her - and she was shocked to learn the truth about his mother and her past. She did say that the rumours were utter crap, and that anyone who believed them was jealous of Mrs. Zabini’s grace and decorum. I’ve never been one to believe rumours, had too many spread about me to believe what the gossip mill says about others, so I don’t believe what they say about Blaise’s mother either. I think she really likes him. I’m not going to lie, I’m rooting for them!
So for now he was just letting it sit. They were busy (and that wasn’t even an excuse, their caseload was huge) and there was barely time to sleep and eat, let alone
‘I like working with Ron and Amelia. I like it when we help people, when we can save people.’ Harry added, smiling smugly at Draco. Even if he wasn’t quite sure
‘No I don’t.’ Harry managed to choke out.
He didn’t realize how bad it was until he was at Ron and Hermione for dinner one day and she burst into tears. Ron looked pained, but not surprised.
Draco was standing with his back towards him and right there, curling over his entire back, along his spine, was a dragon. The tattoo of a dragon. It was
They ordered her to pay a large sum towards the rebuild of Hogwarts and she was also placed under house arrest. She would be confined to the Manor for a year and if after that, she had caused no problems they’d take her off house arrest. If she ever caused trouble again though, the Ministry reserved the right to send her to Azkaban for even minor infractions of the law. She would have to live on the straight and narrow, or go to jail.
Robards took off at a run and Harry followed automatically. When Robards ran, you better run too.
Harry sat with that for a little bit as he shovelled the last of his pasta into his mouth. He came to the conclusion he wanted to spend a little time simmering on this. He needed to look at his normal interactions with Draco with this knowledge in the back of his head. So what he needed right now, was a subject change.
Harry kisses what’s his, with a wet, open mouth, licking up the skin. Sucking on a marred nipple, biting gently at first, and then more roughly when Draco gasps and tangles his hands in Harry’s curls. Harry kisses down his chest, palms at his cock, unbuttons Draco’s trousers and pulls them down roughly.
“Lay down with me, will you?”
“You heard me,” Hermione says, circling around to face Harry with a finger pointed towards his chest. “Are. You.
“Are you going home for Christmas?”
–” Harry picks up speed. “– for no fucking –” Another harsh thrust. “–
Hermione keeps trying to get me to see a mind healer, but I’ve had enough people in my mind thank you very much!
“Fuck,” Harry says, with a joyous laugh.
But then Hermione’s hair is in his face, and Ron is snoring into his ear.
They watch The Parent Trap and Draco cuddles into Harry’s heat, kissing at his jaw, telling him, “Thank you,” and acting far sweeter than Harry has ever seen him. This time, there is no countdown, Draco remains soft until he turns to leave, and when Harry tells him he can stay, if he wants, Draco says, “Maybe next time.”
“Is it because of me? Is that why you’ve told Ron you’re not coming home for holiday?” Ginny’s got her arms crossed over her lilac jumper. She’s cornered him on the weekend, which is totally unfair because he’s nursing a pretty killer hangover.
Draco fucks him with his fingers nice and slow, kissing Harry's jaw, rubbing his stubble against him, biting and sucking down Harry’s neck harsh enough that it’ll definitely leave bruises.
Neville sits up. “How did you–?”
Draco pauses, tilting his head. “Would we just ride back and forth in it, then?”
“Yes, Headmistress. I can have everything arranged with my solicitor, all we’ll need is your signature to have it approved by the courts.” Narcissa pushes back her son’s hair. “We’ll be leaving for France as soon as tomorrow morning if everything goes smoothly.” She makes her way over to McGonagall, pulling a piece of parchment from her robes.
“We can watch something if you’d like.”
Draco nips at Harry’s shoulder, lightly at first, before digging his canines into Harry’s flesh, biting harshly. Harry moans, wondering if Draco wishes to see him bleed. Harry had made Draco bleed once, when they were boys, but now they are two men, having recently shed the last year of their teenagehood like molten skin.
you said to me?”
like it was singing a tune long since forgotten to the conscious bits of Harry’s mind.
Of course, the bubble’s meant to burst because everyone’s decided to ruin Harry’s life — sometimes it feels like the universe has it out for him, and it’s not an unfair assumption considering his track record. Everyone’s decided it’d be fun to return for New Year’s Eve and throw a big party in the common room, something about celebrating their life and the end of the year touched by war or whatever.
“He was a bully, a bigot, a horrible person, a criminal, but –” Hermione says, fiercely. Ron pushes away her curls, kisses the spot between her shoulders. “Why get mad at me for letting go of my anger? It’s my pain, it belongs to me – I was so scared you’d be mad, because I saw him, because I moved on from it. I know he’s hurt you too and I’m–”
“I love you too,” says Harry, with the softest smile Draco has ever seen directed his way.
She knows we’ve been exchanging letters, because she’s usually the one who picks up the mail (since she’s the first to wake up in the morning) and she’s been weird about it. She was hurt at first, but I think she understands that us exchanging letters is our way of making peace with our complicated history.
Draco keeps coming over to Harry’s, and he stops trying to initiate sex he so obviously isn’t ready to have. Instead, he brings gifts in the form of snacks for them to try and food for them to cook together.
“Is it fair to us? For her to forgive him. For her to want him around?”
Draco,
Harry be sadposting on his priv and honestly? Same.
Later, after Dean’s left and Harry’s stripped into his pants and one of Draco’s long-sleeved shirts, Harry lays in bed waiting for Draco to return. The comforting scent of lavender and myrrh is all around him, and he breathes it in deeply.
“Yeah, fuck. Yeah.”
Richard sounds like a cool guy, maybe one day I’ll get to meet him. I like what he said about “moving through your negative emotions,” I’ve been working out a lot lately, building some muscle, but when I get too overwhelmed I go for a run, and clear my head. It’s really been helping. Maybe that’s what he meant?
“What the actual fuck is wrong with you? You’re getting upset over what exactly?” Ron calls from behind him.
“What’s there to think about?”
I love Blur! You've also got to check out Nirvana and Pearl Jam, enclosed are some CDs of theirs to check out! They have songs for all the different types of moods an angsty teenager might find themselves in, haha.
Harry laughs, head leaning back, tongue stuck out through his teeth a bit. “Let’s get something from the kitchens.” It sounds like a brilliant idea, and it seems that Malfoy thinks so too because he’s jumping off the cobblestone sill and wrapping a silk robe around his lithe form.
This is my Human Communication degree popping out lol.
“What’s going on?”
Draco,
“Wha –” Harry doesn’t understand where this is going.
Malfoy’s looking down at him, analytical look boring into Harry’s skull. “What?” Harry bites.
Draco turns his chin towards his shoulder, smiling, face turning an even more beautiful shade of red. “I think I’m ready,” he says, eyes finding Harry’s. “I want to try having sex again.”
“Harry,” Ron bites. “It’s true.”
“I think it’d be different if she hadn’t been caged in his dungeon.” Ron sighs. “I think it’s not fair to tell someone who they can and can’t forgive.”
“I’m in love with you,” Draco answers.
“Remember when we broke up? After eighth year?” Ron asks, lifting up her hand, loosely interlocking their fingers. “You said, I had to be my own person and that you needed to be your own person too.”
“Look at me,” Harry commands. Because he needs Draco to look at him, needs Draco to see that it’s
“How do you like it?”
“Be careful,” Harry says, licking his lips, tasting the salt of sweat on his upper lip. “I’m,” he tries, breathing roughly. “I could –”
“What’s all this?”
Why? Do you plan on needing them?
“I’m hungry,” Draco says, beginning to pull away. “Let’s eat.”
“Mmm, that was nice,” Draco mumbles into his ear, sometime later. Harry’s still on top of him, inside him, around him, but Draco doesn’t seem to mind, plays with Harry’s hair and brushes the sweat loosened curls out of Harry’s face. “I needed that.”
Let me know if you have any more questions,
“The first step to healing is admitting that something is wrong,” Luna nods sympathetically before adding, “You’re not broken, Harry. You don’t need to be fixed.”
Parkinson doesn’t seem phased, simply turns and starts to strip. Right there, right in front of them both. Malfoy grabs at the bottle and wonders if perhaps he’s jealous that Parkinson is undressing in front of another man. Harry remembers Sixth Year, when he’d thought Parkinson and Malfoy might be dating, and wonders if they were — if maybe they still are. Though, he seriously doubts they are.
“Have you?”
“Fuck, you’re so tight.”
Harry wants to understand, wants to be there for Draco. He decides then that the answer is simple: don’t fuck this up. Harry takes a deep breath and makes his way back upstairs, a cool glass of water in hand.
“Draco…” Harry looks up towards heaven, another deep breath entering his lungs, as he finds purchase of his Gryffindor courage.
After a few weeks, Malfoy switches from cigarettes to weed. Harry smells it before he even opens his door, greets Malfoy with a quirk in his brow and a tilt of his head.
“I’ve seen him cry before.”
“Alright,” interrupts Seamus. “We’re jus’ trynna play a simple game. Let’s play the bloody game already, yeah?”
“I need to be alone.” Draco turns his body away from Harry. “I need to shower.”
2. Draco's friends are biased against Harry, point, blank, period. Meaning, they obviously are not going to see Harry's words in the same light that Draco does.
Draco,
I moved to a diff country, and it was a lot going on.
really like to know what you think!
Also, about Richard: just kiss him. Go up to him and if the mood feels right, don’t think about it too hard and just go for it.
Harry looks at Draco’s pale fingers wrapped around the brown of his wrist, relishing in the cool touch. “I know.”
“We don’t have to do it, then.”
Draco,
What other CDs are you listening to?
“Jesus
Harry nods his head, to show he’s listening.
“What’s it feel like?”
Harry rubs oil onto his throbbing shaft and lines the head of his cock against Draco’s plump rim. He’s just started to put his prick inside of Draco when he needs to stop and control his ragged breath. He doesn’t want to come too soon but Draco is clenching around him, and his head feels like it’s spinning.
Draco puts his forehead to Harry’s shoulder, taking in a shaky breath, releasing it with a shudder. “You can’t possibly want me like this.”
Eventually, Malfoy grabs hold of a little phial, and holds it up towards Harry with an accomplished grin.
Harry aka The Bi Who Lived aka Walking Bisexual Disaster
Harry kisses him, because he can taste now, because he’s wanted to know what Draco tastes like for so long and now, he knows, and he never wants to forget. Harry finds a rhythm that suits him, loves the feeling of Draco clawing at his back, loves the way Draco is thrusting up to meet him, loves the way Draco is biting up into his neck, kissing at Harry’s jaw.
“Don’t be foolish, my boy. You’ve also been noted by your teachers as being late to all of your classes, sometimes skipping them altogether. You’re failing most of your classes, Harry, if there’s something going on, please, just,
that throbs against his skull.
“A little.” Draco sniffs.
Draco knows this to be an undeniable truth, their matching tattoos a heavy reminder of where unwavering loyalty for another person can lead you – how Theo faced a darkness he did not need to, if only to be able to save his best friend from losing his own self in it.
Malfoy doesn’t talk to him that year, and it nearly drives Harry mad.
Harry changes into a pair of grey joggers, throwing on Draco’s black long sleeve. He sniffs, scratching at his morning stubble and goes to use the loo.
That’s so fucked up about
Harry moves his head out of the way from her outstretched hand. “It’s not that big of a deal, Hermione.”
Hermione sighs next to him, rubbing her hand across her forehead. “Professor, maybe we should give Harry a few days to think about what you’ve said.”
I think it’s sweet that you have a crush on Richard, he sounds like a nice bloke. But, wouldn’t the Statute get in the way of anything meaningful? Maybe, if he knew about you the way I do, he’d be hurt at first - that you joined a group that wanted to cause his demise. But maybe, just maybe, he’d also see that your heart is in the right place. You’re obviously trying to be better than you once were, and you’re easy to talk to (er, write to) and you have such an interesting outlook on the world. Maybe, he’ll see that too and think - wow, he’s kind of incredible. Maybe.
, I fucking know why. I’m not, it’s – please don’t touch me,” he says when Harry reaches out a hand. Harry’s fingertips curl in on themselves as he pulls away.
, what I
Draco brushes back some hair that’s fallen in front of Nott’s eyes and Harry wants to knock Nott out cold, but then the blond says, “That’s a bit pathetic, Theo,” and Harry feels a sick sense of satisfaction.
Harry pulls up, putting another finger in, his mouth falling slightly open at the sight before him, leaning down to kiss Draco, sliding his tongue in and out and grinding down onto Draco’s thigh. The other man pulls away with a whimper as Harry brushes just below the little nub inside Draco. “Fuck,” Harry growls. “Oh fuck.” He’s going to fuck Draco and he might just cry because his body is shaking with the immensely powerful desire to do so.
“It’s a favourite of Ginny’s,” Harry explains. “I think she left it last time she was over, we have – er – movie nights.”
The strands of Draco’s hair stick together, dripping water onto Harry’s white shirt, and Harry can’t help himself from staring. Draco’s eyes are red, like he’s been crying some more, and Harry’s body feels tight. He places the food in front of him, trying his best at delicacy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s ears are ringing. He wants to cry. He stands. “He’s fucking lying!”
Dean snorts. “You get to really know a guy when you live in his dungeon, you see.”
“We were told about it, Harry." Hermione has her head in her hands. "As Head Boy and Girl we were asked to keep an eye out and make sure he wasn’t using again.”
Harry complies, sliding his finger out of Draco, leaving only the tip in. Grabbing the bottle of lube, still open next to him and squeezing more of the cool liquid onto his fingers, circling Draco’s hole gently, pushing back in with leisure, watching as Draco’s head tilts back on his pillow, enjoying the view as he rolls his body with pleasure.
“Harry?” Hermione mutters. “You wouldn’t happen to know anything about it, would you?”
“No,” says Draco, suddenly serious.
“Only if you meant it.”
I do know where I'm taking this story, but updates are going to slow down just a bit bc, well, I gotta make everything lmao!
It’s the anniversary of The Battle of Hogwarts as I write this.
“What?” Harry breathes.
“First time?” Harry asks, moving his hand, the one with the words
“Have you ever…?” Malfoy asks between kisses.
“Where are you even getting this stuff from anyway?” Harry asks one night, sitting in his usual position, legs stretched out in front of him as he melts into the rough cobblestone behind him.
“Draco?”
“Exercise bikes,” Harry tells him. “I took Ron to the gym once,” Harry begins through a yawn, “He went so fast he fell forward – off it.”
Harry can’t help but feel a little smug. The monster in his chest, the one he’s made a bit of peace with, the one he had told Draco about once (which had earned a hearty laugh from the blond) purrs happily in his chest. Mostly though, he feels the same relief Draco must be feeling – or, perhaps, it’s a different kind of relief. Perhaps this relief comes from the clarity of them both being on the same page.
“I’m studying for my potions mastery,” Draco tells him, light-grey eyes on the marker of a young boy turned man’s destiny. He moves his hand into Harry’s tight curls. “Is this okay?”
Parkinson’s lingerie set is all lace and Harry can’t help himself from looking at her body and admiring the view. Malfoy nudges him with the bottle, but his eyes are reserved for Parkinson, who’s got a sinister smirk splayed across her lips as she dresses.
Harry wants so badly to hear him beg for it, for Draco to show some semblance of desperation – for him to show Harry that he was never alone in this.
“Come on, Draco. Down you go,” Theo says, helping Draco sit on his bed and take off his shoes. Harry curls his lip in distaste at the easy affection Draco offers Theo, leaning into the dark-haired boy with an arm around him and pulling him to his chest, running his hands through his hair.
Draco’s lip twitches. “Can today be the day you made me your boyfriend?”
Zabini joins them a bit later, telling them it’s officially 1999.
Harry slams the door behind him once he’s made it to his room, startling Malfoy, who’s sat atop his duvet reading a paperback novel.
, you make, I want - I can’t, you’re –”
Harry kisses down from Draco’s neck all the way to the top of his abdomen where trimmed blond curls wait in greeting. Harry breathes in his musky scent and licks up his throbbing shaft, putting just the head in his mouth and twirling his tongue around it. Harry rubs the oil into his hand and wordlessly casts a quick cleaning charm, the way Draco taught him to, and teases his rim with a circling finger.
“Thank you for being someone I can trust.”
“That’s just the drugs,” Dean exhales the words along with smoke in his lungs.

Harry snorts, opening his eyes. “Really?”
“Shit. You think he’s shooting up Unicorn Blood?” Neville asks, eyes twitching between Ron and Theo, who’s on his left. Theo seems disinterested in the conversation and sighs, leaning his head back.
“Fuck,” says Harry, because quite honestly –
“We can hang out,” Harry suggests. “Like we have been.”
Draco will catch him staring and when he does, he’ll look away, hide his face.
Pansy cackles. “
Draco opens his mouth, allowing the warm slide of Harry’s tongue against his own, letting out a sweet little yelp that’s a response to Harry’s hands in his hair, Harry tilting Draco’s head back, Harry lowering Draco down onto the bed, trying his best to be gentle.
Malfoy’s there in the room, smoking a cigarette of all things. He’s sitting on the cobblestone sill with the window pushed partially open, exhaling smoke into the cool night air. When Harry enters, Malfoy turns, sniffs, and says, “You’re not going to throw a fit over this are you?”
Draco’s kissing down his chest, hands rubbing up and down his sides, moving his legs to straddle him. They’ve never done this before, never has Draco put his lips to his chest like that, never has he teased the delicate skin above his groin with featherlight touches.
“You only want me around because you want to
One night, over dinner, Harry finds the courage to say, “I’m quitting the Auror training program.”
Draco brings his hand between them, lazily wanking Harry’s cock, using the precome leaking out of him to help. “It’s never like this with anyone else.”
“Good job, Draco.”
Harry puts his hand down, nods his head. Where there was once the stark sting of rejection there is instead the relief that Draco trusts him enough with this, feels safe enough to say no. What a powerful thing: touch, Harry thinks, what a powerful word, no.
surprised by Dumbledore’s letter in your defense. Who knew he had a nasty git like you in mind? After everything.
“Yeah?”
Harry is very grateful indeed and pulls Draco into a seething kiss, slipping his tongue into the other man’s mouth. They kiss like that for a while, there’s no rush all of a sudden. Now that Draco’s got that little phial in his hand, Harry feels like he’s got all the time in the world.
Harry turns his head in time to see Draco, eyes glazed, take his finger, and swipe it across his come stained chest, bringing it to his lips. Harry’s mouth falls agape as Draco turns to him and says, “You ever wondered what you taste like?”
“Loads of it, actually.”
“But –”
I wouldn't mind helping you out.
Harry’s laughter is deep in his chest, he feels so good. He hits Draco harder, drawing blood this time. It’s just about the funniest thing he’s ever experienced. “Hit me. Come on, come on. Hit me too, yeah?”
Harry’s annoyed and brooding all afternoon when he realises everyone’s returned from holiday early, but then Draco’s kissing at his jaw and saying shit like
“What is forgiveness anyway?” Hermione asks, relaxing into Ron’s soothing touch. He moves the flannel against her back in a comforting circular motion as they sit together in the soapy water. “I think you can forgive someone, and it doesn’t absolve them of their responsibility to be a better person.”
Draco lets out a soft chuckle, getting up, wiping his lips, working his throat. He smacks his lips, tilting his head as if he’s discovering something. He looks the way one might when eating a new sweet, licking his lips and trying to discern the flavouring.
2. Draco then has a separate tab for donations.
“Muggle studies.” Malfoy shrugs. “It’s so fucking boring,” he says, throwing the book out in front of him. The pages make a noise as the novel falls down onto the floor with a soft thud, turned down and still partially open.
Malfoy exhales the smoke from his pointed nose. “Longbottom.”
,” Draco moans, when Harry hits that sweet spot inside him. Draco’s practically mewling from the pleasure of it. “Oh fuck, Harry!”
“He said he wanted to hear that he’s sorry.” Hermione frowns.
“Ah, yes, does my phrasing sound too intimate?” Luna’s airy voice is non-judgemental, simply curious. “Would you prefer I say you’re fucking?”
Harry opens his eyes, begins to pump his fist as he watches Draco gasp, groan, whimper all because Harry’s touching him.
Theo gets up to leave mumbling something about leaving them to it.
That’s his name, you know? Or one of them. Voldemort. The other being, Tom Riddle. I mean honestly take your pick, Malfoy. But still calling him the Dark Lord? Like he’s some esteemed member of your little Pureblood society, bleh.
“Black.” Parkinson twirls, strips as Harry watches her from over the bottle, and turns back to them once she’s changed and asks, “Or red?”
“I don’t like to be touched when I’m angry or hurt,” Draco says, head turned down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No bloody way,” Harry says, mouth agape.
Malfoy,
“Take me home,” Draco chokes out, hands tangled in Harry’s hair, body pressed against his. “Now, take me home, fuck I need to – I want.”
is wrong with you?”
“Hmm?”
Theo puts down his knife, turns, hugs Draco tightly. Theo puts a cold hand to the back of his neck, touches the skin there softly. Oh, the ways in which a platonic touch can heal a wound turned sore from the bitter salt of a believed truth that has been rubbed into it one time too many.
“Do your friends know we’re sleeping together?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yours.”
“You don’t know him the way I do,” Harry mutters, taking the meat she’s handed him and throwing it towards the baby Thestral stumbling towards him.
Drinks had been their amicable truce. “Brothers fight,” Ron had said. It warmed something deep within Harry, and soothed the ugly, decaying boyhood that still clogged his chest.
“Hit me.” Draco says. He’s laughing so hard, and Harry feels elated at the sound of it. It’s the best thing he’s ever heard. Ever.
Don't forget how twitter be: for each page break you gotta read from the bottom to the top babes!
“Whoa slow down there,” Ron says, voice a soothing whisper. The floating candles flicker around them, making them feel cocooned in the safety of their intimacy. “I don’t have to forgive him, and you don’t have to hate him.”
Harry has a few guesses of what could have hurt Draco so terribly, scarred him so drastically. Harry has his own wounds, his own monstrosities he has tried to bury over and again. Maybe the relief he feels is found in the recently learned truth that they can come together like this, vulnerable, afraid, falling easily into one another; in love, all the same. Harry falls asleep pondering, Draco’s even breathing a soft tickle against the hairs of his chest.
“This is good,” Draco says between bites. “I didn’t know you could cook.”
Draco kisses him, roughly, before softening under Harry’s tentative exploration. Harry shakes with the delicacy of Draco’s trembling body under his touch, and he wonders how he can hold onto this. He wonders if this is how he ruins himself and hates that his self-destruction is saccharine in its uncoiling.
Then, Draco nudges Harry, wants to move them, wants to be on top and
Everything always feels so wrong, every day is an empty monotony. He just wants to forget, to relax, for his brain to shut the fuck up for a few hours — besides, it helps him sleep.
Draco asks, “Do your friends know we’re dating?”
The minute he’s inside he starts throwing anything he can get his hands on, yelling incoherently. He wants to cry, but the tears won't come. Ron runs in, grabbing at him, holding him, shushing him.

cool now.”
“Oh.” Draco moves the rice across his plate, putting his elbow to the table and leaning his cheek against the fist of his left hand. “We could have ordered takeout.”
“I’ve already forgiven him for that.”
“Are you –”
How do you know about Muggles knowing about it though?
A moment's pause passes between them.
Malfoy,
“Aw, look at you, taking care of me like the good old days,” Draco coos. “Before you went and replaced me.”
Harry turns his head; he hadn’t known that about Malfoy. “But do they think it’s weird that, y’know, you and I are smoking?” After a beat Harry adds, “Together, I mean.”
“I know.”
towards him. “Make love to me."
Harry complies, sitting up to pull his pants down and away. Now it’s just skin on skin and it feels fantastic. There’s sweat starting to form on the both of them and they’re kissing into one another and rutting against each other, and Harry wants so badly to feel what it’s like to be inside Draco, wants to feel Draco clench around him as he comes.
People are mean to Draco and Harry has some questions!
“That’s my take on it,” Draco rasped, sniffing and messing with something on his phone. The screen paused, letting Harry know that Draco was doing something in another app or on the screen itself. When Draco returned the light coming from his screen was softer. His hair still shone white gold in the softened hue. His eyes still gleamed a clouded grey. “You can fuck anyone—but with whom can you sit in silence?”
“About what?”
Harry watches as Neville moves closer to Nott, who leans into him in return. Draco grabs at Pansy’s hand and they disappear together.
and undoing the button on his trousers. Draco’s hard and there’s a wet spot on his pants as he wiggles out of his trousers and lays down onto the bed, pulling Harry on top of him.
“Will I see you there?” Harry still hadn’t looked at him, but his whole body buzzed with excitement.
Harry harshly brushes a hand through his hair. “I didn’t –”
“Not really, I mean it used to. But now…”
"Need I remind
Nott and Draco turn towards one another, lock their arms around each other as they throw back their shots. They’re laughing, probably high on something, and it’s making them fall into each other with loose-limbed ecstasy.
Business as usual
The mystery man, who Harry now realises is Theodore Nott, grabs Draco’s hand and drags him over to the floor where everyone’s sat around a large gauntlet.
Draco moves his hand from inside Harry’s pants making him groan at the loss of contact and takes Harry’s hand off him too. Harry wants to keep touching him, needs to keep touching him — is already moving to kiss his neck, kissing, sucking, biting. Hard. Because Harry thinks Draco might just like it a bit rough too.
And then, get this Draco, Dumbledore knew I had to die from the very beginning. Ha fucking ha, he raised me as a pig for slaughter. Snape's words, not mine. From the moment he left me with the Dursleys, he knew I had to die. Makes you wonder what I would be like if I had been raised by people who actually loved me instead. Maybe I wouldn’t be such the eager fucking child soldier everyone is so excited to celebrate. Maybe I wouldn’t have been ready to die if I hadn’t been raised for literal murder.
“I do not wish to think.” Draco turns away then, righting himself, gathering his scattered clothes.
So, basically what you’re saying is you think I’m attractive? Thanks, you too, mate, haha.
for us not to let her bring him around?” Hermione tilts her head, considering. “Is it fair of me to make her choose? To say, you’re being a bad friend to me if you bring him around?”
“Harry, still, I mean he’s. Well,” Hermione cuts herself off, eyes shifting around her. “People have been saying things about him.”
“I’ll never stop hating him.”
“Need to see them on, if you’re asking me to share my honest opinion.”
P.S. The thought of you calling him Riddle is hilarious, I hope he’s rolling in his grave.
“Good?” Draco pulls away from him then.
Harry wanted to touch, to taste, to feel – and here he is, it’s his birthday and his head is spinning under the strobe lights electrifying ambiance. His heart is pounding to the beat pumping through the speakers, and his eyes are trained on Draco’s tantalising form.
Harry feels hope, the treacherous thing, and it scares him. He focuses on the feeling of Draco’s cock inside him and hot breath over him instead.
“Alright.”
And then, with those words ringing in his ear, Draco thrusting into him at just the right angle, Harry’s mouth against Draco’s scarred skin, Harry comes with a loud moan. He’s coming and coming, hard, and his brain is swimming, filled with the thickness of honey and syrup, and he’s seeing white in his vision — Harry’s never come this hard in his life and wants so badly to see Draco come now; his legs tightening around Draco’s waist as he rides out the high from his orgasm. Draco comes a few moments later, with a deep groan and his hand in Harry’s hair and mouth at Harry’s jaw.
Harry stares at the light that seeps through the bottom of the door and wonders why things can’t simply be easy between them and is unable to stop the breath that sits between a scoff and a laugh when his mind unhelpfully supplies him with the thought:
I’m so tired all the time. I don’t want to have gone through this just for the next generation to go through it too. It feels like a waste of everything, like it was all for nothing - if nothing changes.
“Yeah, pop some Butterkist, have the mates over for drinks and movies.”
“Alright, Theo, this one’s for you,” Neville begins, mischievous glint in his eyes. “Who’s the last person you slept with?” He smirks, like it’s a game between them two. It makes Harry quirk a brow at the sight of it.
“I heard you’ve been smoking spliffs with Draco bloody Malfoy of all people,” Ron says, arms crossed over his Weasley knit jumper. They’re sat in the common room by the fire; they’re supposed to be studying but Hermione’s the only one who’s actually making any kind of effort to revise tonight.
“You’re not –”
“Do you?”
Hope, the treacherous thing, still clings to his lungs and fills his chest with the wish that this all end differently than it’s going to.
Draco hums. “Well,” he says, squeezing at Harry’s cock. “We can’t have that, now, can we?” Draco brings his lips to Harry’s, kissing him gently, sliding his slick tongue in slowly, making love to Harry with his mouth. “I want you to come inside me,” Draco says, pulling away from Harry’s mouth, soft breath a tickle against Harry’s skin.
Harry breathes through the overwhelming feeling of having something inside him for the first time, relaxing and feeling himself loosen up as Draco whispers into his ear about how good he’s doing, telling him,
Harry & Draco have their first fight. Sorry.
Riddle doing that to you. That sounds awful.
, marking – he wants there to be something for Draco to poke at and remember that Harry was there.
Sorry, that’s so fucked up. It’s stupid. I’m rambling. I’m sorry. I’ll end it here.
A blond eyebrow quirks up on Malfoy’s pale face, but he smirks and silently offers him one, even holding out a lighter for Harry to use. Harry takes the cigarette into his mouth, uses the lighter, and sits down on the floor by Malfoy’s feet.
I’m sorry I haven’t written, it’s just been a weird two months. There was this bloke that I was starting to really like, but then he started seeing someone else and it was - I didn’t even really realise I was falling for him the way I was until I realised he was with someone else and I felt like my insides were boiling over.

“Yeah,” Draco breathes. “You’re my baby.”
Malfoy,
to do.”
Even now, after everything, the smell is still comforting.
“Not bloody likely.”
“I hate you for that.”
Harry sits in Draco’s spot, glad suddenly that he’s claimed it instead of having to see Dean sit here. He hands back the spliff to Dean, who has to relight it.
It’s a year of them dating, dancing around each other, sharing a bed, learning how to touch, and be touched, with explicit consent, with non-verbal consent, learning their boundaries, carving them out in the space they take up together before they have sex again.
About my whole skin thing, so you noticed it shining in the sun, did you? I’m definitely reading into that. Kidding. Don’t worry, Draco, I also had my moments. I mean, I have eyes too. It’s weird, but sometimes the people you dislike can also catch your attention. I blame puberty, haha. Your hair was always gleaming in the sun, I couldn’t help but notice that. Speaking of eyes, I always noticed yours.
“I just don’t understand why you won’t come home,” Ron’s voice is tight, his posture too stiff. Harry wonders if Ginny told Ron what he’d said, but the thing is, Ginny and Ron haven’t spoken more than two words to each other since her birthday party in August. They'd gotten into a huge fight about something or the other, it’s hard for Harry to keep the facts straight and he feels bad making Hermione repeat herself.
“Yeah,” Draco says, voice sounding dreamy and far away.
“I want to.”
I don’t think Ginny’s that interested in him, I’ll give her the heads up though, thanks for your input.
“I might start to believe you.”
“Show me.”
Draco grinds into him with one particularly hard thrust that has Harry’s head rolling back, gasping and huffing out heavy breaths of air. He turns his head to the right, humming in pleasure when he notices it.
, but Theo’s always been a bit obsessed with me –”
“I died in a forest, Professor. Sorry if that makes school seem rather dull nowadays.”
“Told you,” Malfoy whines, tongue sticking out.
“You shouldn’t say things like that,” Draco says, kissing against the sensitive spot of Harry’s neck.
Ginny takes a step back, blinking at him in shock. “What the
Details! Details! Details!
“I have one,” says Harry, eyes on Draco’s downturned lips — fists on his hips, grey eyes distant. “One of those boxes that play pictures with sound.”
Ron leads Hermione out, slamming the door behind him. Harry moves to sit on his bed but then decides to sit on Draco’s instead, kicking off his trainers and laying down into the comforting scent of lavender and myrrh.
Harry swallows the lump in his throat. “I don’t know.”
know – we can
The answer has always been obvious, Harry realises, as Draco breathes him in, kissing at his bare skin.
“You’re fit and you bloody well know it.”
The music below is still loud enough that from the floor Harry feels the bass from the speaker's massage through him, it makes him feel hot and his cock thickens as the arousal he’s been carrying around for Draco all night makes itself known.
Draco’s quiet for so long Harry worries he’s gone to sleep. “You’re pretending,” he says eventually. “We promised not to pretend.”
“But –”
About my mum, I am interested to hear stories about her - but I’m not sure I’m ready.
The audience should assume that Harry quickly becomes one of Draco's regulars.
“Where’ve you been?” Harry holds out his hand, Draco takes it and interlocks their fingers, bringing Harry’s bruised knuckles to his lips.
He feels humiliated, and then he feels guilt at being uncomfortable with the shift in things, and then he feels like Malfoy is regretting this,
“Being chased by an egomaniac for the last seven years really does a number on a person, Gin. That’s what the fuck is wrong with me,” Harry grits hit teeth as he speaks to her, fists clenched tight at his sides; he feels himself trembling and wills himself to stop.
From your return address - it looks like you're in Muggle London now? I would assume so seeing how this was delivered by the postman and not an owl. Why go there of all places?
Harry has every right not to forgive Malfoy, but what he does not have a right to do is determine how other people forgive him or move forward in their relationship with him - if, and only IF, they have also been hurt by them too.
Ew! I cannot believe your Aunt and Voldemort had a love affair. That makes so much sense, though. She was weirdly obsessed with Voldemort.
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe Ginny had said something after all or maybe Ron was doing that thing again where he was oddly perceptive without ever actually trying to be — not that Harry solely wanted the Weasley family around when they were happy, but Harry had his own grief to drown in, and much preferred to deal with it on his own.
Harry moves his hand, using it to brush a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “Today’s good.”
“I’m not gonna lie,” Harry said, lying down, eyes heavy from a sleep he did not want to fall into. “I like how we’re just sitting in silence at this point.”
“Draco, it was Draco – he’s the last person I slept with.” Nott admits, arms open before him.
“Do you think she will?”
“She’s always been full of surprises, my girl.”
“Sex makes me angry. It makes me
to us,” Hermione pleads, voice cracking.
“I have ice cream in the fridge.”
The second time Draco and Harry come together, it’s the night before graduation and they make it all the way to the very end before Malfoy cries.
“Alright, Ms. Granger. Perhaps you’re right and a few days will be just what he needs.”
“Please,” Draco sobs, and Harry takes him deeper. “Need to feel you inside me, I want to come with you inside me.”
Harry feels tears swell in his own eyes and he swallows the saltiness of their sting down his throat, breathing deeply and evenly before saying, “Whenever you’re ready, I’ll be here to listen, even if it makes you sick.”
Malfoy,
The soft murmurs of the cafe create an ambiance of peace, Draco feels as if he’s in his own little world. A word that exists outside of the past, the present, but perhaps it’s a world that can exist in the future.
“Hey,” Harry croaks.
It’s better that nothing happens, Harry decides,
Is this some kind of joke? You keep it, throw it away. I don’t care. I don’t want it either.
Harry pushes past her, turning away from the dining hall and instead heading back up towards his dorm. His blood is boiling from the rage that seeps into his brain, making his ears ring and body feel tight against his skin.
Alright, look, I’m sorry okay? The war’s gotten to my head. I’m having a rough time of it. I know it’s over but sometimes I feel like it isn’t. Hermione says I can’t get mad at you for being a complete arsewipe if then I run around and act like a complete prick to everyone I know (even you).
They find their pants and then Draco moves into bed and grabs a loose-limbed Harry up and puts his head against all the pillows by Draco’s headboard and tucks them both under the duvet.
me if –”
They eat in silence and Harry is acutely aware that this is the first time he’s ever done this with Draco; sit and eat, guard down.

“Alright.”
want to fuck you.” Draco’s hand palms at Harry’s cock through his pyjama bottoms, making Harry’s eyes roll back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry undoes the front button of Draco’s trousers, moving back, peeling them away slowly, kissing the top of Draco’s bare knee, the front of his thigh, the tip of his hip jutting out from above his briefs. He turns, shimmies his jeans off, turns again, feeling electrified.
“I want you to sleep with me." Harry digs his nails into Draco’s shoulders. "Only me.”
“Ron!” Hermione sounds aghast, eyes wide and frantic. She looks sort of like she did when they had all been fighting the night Ron left them behind in that shabby old tent. “You don’t mean that, I know you don’t.”
Harry doesn’t know what to say back to that, just like he doesn’t know what to say when Draco clears the cleaned dishes, when he wipes down the kitchen counter, or when he grabs the broom that hangs by the garden back door and sweeps around the table and stove. Harry decides that it’s better to stare at him than say something foolish. Instead, he sits, chin in his hand, elbow on the table, eyes trained on Draco in his clothes, cleaning his kitchen, moving like he owns the place.
“Merlin, that was fucking amazing.” Draco says, running a hand through his slightly damp hair.
“That’s different, Harry.” Hermione’s brows curve in. She’s frowning. “You were getting better,” she says and when Harry clicks his tongue she adds, “You were!”
“Thank you for trusting me.” Harry reaches out his hand and Draco walks forward to take it, letting himself be led down onto the couch, sitting next to Harry, curling up into him.
So, here's the thing about being a sex worker and sharing personal tidbits of your life. You always have to be careful about what you share - and you have to consider how much of your authentic self you can bring to the table. How much is too much, versus just enough?
I’m glad you liked Sade’s album. I love it too, a lot. I actually had sex for the first time, listening to that album. It was really nice. Sorry if that’s too much information, haha.
“Yeah.” He smiles. “Turns out you just needed to let yourself feel your hurt.”
Draco doesn’t even have to finish his question because Harry knows what he’s trying to ask and he also knows that,
“Can I?” Harry asks, reaching out, desperate to hug him, desperate to take his hurt away, to comfort him, to love him.
Your Muggle neighbour, does he have a name? Seems like a cool guy, showing you all this stuff although I can imagine how hard it must be trying to keep up the Statute of Secrecy. Feel free to ask me stuff you're unsure about before going to him, just in case.
Neville sits up straight. “Might just take you up on that, mate.”
Harry smiles, feeling smug and sated with Draco’s praise. “You’re fucking amazing.”
“I love you too.”
Equally curious,
They had wandered around a little bit at first, exploring different parts of the now mostly empty castle (barring a few members of the staff, those of whom they had swiftly avoided, doing their best to keep down their fits of laughter) and then going out into the snow-covered grounds wearing only their pyjamas and snow boots. By the time they had deigned to return to the castle, after a rather intense snowball fight, they were both flushed red from the cold, but it didn’t really matter that much because the cold wasn’t that biting against Harry’s skin. Better said, because he was high on acid, he didn’t really feel it all that much.
Slowly, Harry starts to thrust against Draco’s finger, his brain beginning to fog up and he feels like Draco’s all around him and he wants —
“You must be fun at parties.”
Harry looks as breathtakingly handsome as ever, his gold jewelry shimmers in the light. He has his hands tucked into the pockets of his denims as he watches Draco approach.
Malfoy — no,
“He was the first man to ever touch me.”
“Have you ever been on the underground?” Harry asks, rising to his feet from the sofa couch he had been sitting at, waiting for Draco, following the other man into the kitchen.
“You know I’m Head Boy, right? This is some serious shit, not just the spliffs everyone’s been getting from Neville.”
“Just by the sight,
The fifth time Harry wonders what Draco tastes like, it’s pub night after a successful Auror raid. Draco had been brought in because of the mark on his arm. He’d recently opened an apothecary shop; sold popular potions and ones he’d made by himself. He’d patented five unique potions in the last year alone, all of which he had been working on the last two years – and he had been a suspect in the illegal potions ring until he had offered to bring down the potions smugglers who were selling fake potions with labels from his apothecary.
Hahahah.... yeah ;)
Malfoy leans forward, claps his hands, and takes in a few shaky breaths as he tries to quell his laughter and respond. “Who told him to die for my sins?”
“You just did,” says Draco, fighting against his body’s need for rest.
Draco stares at Harry, a soft hue of red spreading across white skin, his uneven breathing reflected in the rapid rise and fall of his scarred chest. Draco slides his hand down Harry’s arm, fingers curling around Harry’s wrist, pushing Harry’s finger into his body.
“Do you have one of those boxes?”
Draco doesn’t wait for Harry to signal that he’s ready for a third finger, instead slowly starting to slip it in, staring down at Harry with a flushed face and chest, waiting for Harry to nod so that he can continue. It’s nice, Harry thinks, having someone inside him like this. He feels almost full, in a way. He likes the way Draco’s looking at him, like he’s the only person that matters in the world. Harry briefly wonders what he looks like but quickly stops worrying about it once he sees the way Draco bites his lip.
“Is this because of Malfoy?”
“You think because you were worse, you don’t have a right to be angry.” Theo says, moving onto the red pepper. “I’ll be angry for you.”
Oi vey...besties!! SOS!!
Tight grip on Draco’s thigh, so tight he’s sure it’ll bruise, Harry thrusts harshly into Draco’s hole, the sound of Draco’s rapid breathing and pleasured moans, mixing with the slap of their bodies, with low groans that escape the back of Harry’s throat — with his whispered
“Are you and Finnigan together?” Draco raises his brow in challenge.
Ron lifts up a shoulder beside him, sipping on his butterbeer. “I think they might want to,” he says, voice humourless but honest.
He loved those.
“Are you threatening me, Weasley?” Theo asks, eyes squinting down into a glare.
“Yeah?”
I'm glad you ended up liking Nirvana.
He pours the water, refills the filter, sets it back in his fridge, softly sets the water on the counter, places his hands against the kitchen sink, and turns his head down. His heart is beating so fast he feels sick with the way it makes him tremble. His mind, useful as ever, keeps spinning and crumbling with horrifying images of what exactly could have made Draco react so strongly tonight, what excruciating torture he must have undergone. He knows that he’s been given something delicate, a small sliver of trust, and that if he fucks this up, he won’t be given this again.
‘Yes, I will.’
no one wanted to be paired with Malfoy.
Friends. A friend hug. Sort of. A maybe-more-than-friends hug. A you-just-glanced-at-my-mouth-but-I-don’t-know-what-we’re-doing hug. A hug to try and make sure the guy you were half-way in love with didn’t die.
It was pretty good, Harry was of the humble opinion. Sure, if anyone looked too closely, they’d still see his eyes, which were immensely recognizable.
‘Just shh for a second.’ Harry said. ‘I wanna enjoy this without having to deal with your smartass comments.’
‘Here.’ Harry startled so bad he nearly threw his coffee cup at Draco’s head. His other hand went for his wand, but he managed to stop himself. He forced himself to put his cup down and turned around.
‘Yes it is. Breaking free from its past.’
That had not been
With the shortened training programme, they’d introduced the term Junior Auror. It meant that they had technically graduated, but that they still had to get more practical experience, which Harry found  a little silly for the ones that had fought in the battle of Hogwarts, but he’d take it.
‘It’s 4am, why aren’t you asleep?’ Draco asked after three heartbeats. Harry sighed. He untangled himself from Draco with some effort.
‘Thanks, do you want the last piece?’ Draco shook his head before Harry had even properly finished the question.
business?’ She asked, approaching slowly.
‘Don’t be dramatic.’ Harry said.
He had taken most of the fancy stuff off before they came out to the pub (unlike Gaulding who was still strutting around in his full outfit). He didn’t want to spill beer on them, so he’d taken the robe and the waistcoat off. The grey shirt would soon be too warm, but he’d cross that bridge once he got there.
After the third break things get a little more dark, but nothing too graphic I don't think.
(See the end of the chapter for
Getting out of Hogwarts and away from the tension of a looming war was apparently good for people.
‘Why exactly were you two together this morning? I thought even Junior Aurors got the weekends off unless there was some kind of emergency?’ Ah, that’s what she was after.
‘You’re welcome.’
And finally, Grant Blueroot, who was a bit of a strange fellow, smart as a whip, but very quiet. He’d been paired with Gaulding for most of his Auror training (after Gaulding’s first partner had ran screaming) and he mostly let the loudmouthed wanker walk all over him. Malfoy compared him to Goyle, but smarter.
They waited as mother and daughter both sobbed and spoke in half-sentences for a few minutes. eventually the mother wiped her cheeks and picked up her daughter, setting her on her hip as she got up from where she’d been kneeling on the ground.
Once Gregory Goyle arrived and had gotten over the shock of seeing Harry there, their lunch was… interesting. The girls were nice enough, if Harry ignored their needling about his hair and glasses. Goyle was quiet, he seemed unsure what to do about Harry, which was fair. Zabini was… well, at first Harry thought he was kind of a dick. He seemed very miffed that Harry had been invited to
‘Well, I would assume the Aurors are professionals and if he qualifies, would put themselves past that, but otherwise,
good about myself today.’ Harry mumbled sarcastically, blowing into his mug, trying to cool the boiling water down to a point where he could drink it. ‘I had a rough night, I feel like shit.’ Harry said, shrugging his shoulders up a little higher, snuggling into the hood of his hoodie. It was a testament to how bad he looked that Malfoy hadn’t even commented on the oversized, obnoxiously red monstrosity Harry was wearing today. He normally never passed up on an opportunity to harp on Harry’s Muggle clothes.
‘Oh please, once a Slytherin, always a Slytherin.’ Harry sighed again, looking to Hermione for help. She gave him a look.
-‘ Ginny said forcefully and Harry realized Ron and Hermione had been bickering. ‘I think Harry just had a revelation, maybe you could stop arguing and feed the poor guy. He looks too skinny.’ Hermione’s eyes darted over him critically.
‘Yep. Seems like we had a similar idea.’
‘Mostly. I would just like to reiterate that I believe
‘Well, that’s what we were discussing. They think this supplier might be part of a larger network and they want to take out the whole thing in one go, make sure to kill it at the roots. They think this might take months-‘

Shawna Baez, she was an American witch who had moved to London after a falling out with her parents. She’d worked for MACUSA (the American version of the DMLE) before she moved to London and she’d completed the Auror training programme with little difficulty.
‘I remember why I know this town.’ His hands suddenly darted over the map, he traced along a sideroad. His fingers hesitating over what looked to be an empty plot of land. ‘There.’
‘Teaching. You taught a whole bunch of other students Defence.’
remembered that he couldn’t pay with his wizarding money everywhere. Harry had been tempted to let him try so many times, just to see the faces of the poor people in whatever place they were in, but he’d resisted so far. One day though, one day.
‘Would you just please be a little more careful?’ He sounded so earnest for a second. Too bad he ruined it by following it up with: ‘The St Mungo’s hospital gowns are not a good look on you.’
We're officially halfway there!
‘Oh thanks Draco.’
‘That’s professor Dray to you.’ Draco said in response, but he was grinning, so Harry didn’t take him seriously.
‘Well, if that is everything we should take this to a vote.’ Minister Shacklebolt said and Harry jolted. He stood up quickly.
‘I think you need a break. We’ve had a lot of rough cases lately. Talk to Robards, take a week off.’ Draco said. ‘We haven’t really had any time off since we started.’
‘My lunch with the others.’ Draco said after rolling his eyes. ‘I did say you were my friend now and on Saturday’s I have lunch with my friends.’
‘Alright, well. If it is tradition and you’re still alive, somehow, it must be good luck too.’
‘Come on.’ He told Draco, who rolled his eyes.
‘Cheers, to us.’ They all clanked their glasses together and chorused:
‘Are you saying you couldn’t afford a new shirt if this one is “ruined”?’ Harry asked with a smirk. Malfoy rolled his eyes and pulled up his nose.
‘So, do you want to have dinner with Hermione and I today? You could stay over?’ Ron offered, drawing Harry’s attention away from Malfoy.
‘I request that Harry James Potter speaks on my behalf.’ He eventually said in that stupidly posh voice, turning to the Wizengamot. There were some confused murmurs, but no one protested. Minister Shacklebolt motioned for Harry to head down to the little bench where witnesses were brought to give testimony.
‘Ron should go first.’ She had a stubborn tilt to her chin, but Harry was nothing if not stubborn.
‘It’s going to be fine.’ Harry said, but it didn’t quite have the conviction he wanted it to have. Malfoy mumbled something he couldn’t quite catch.
‘No one will ever know we solved it.’ Draco pouted.
‘Potter.’ He looked over at her, she looked both apprehensive and annoyed at the same time. Like she was annoyed at her own apprehension. ‘Do you have a second?’ He made sure to smile at her.
‘Harry, are you okay?’ Draco asked, his hand tightening a little on Harry’s arm. He realized his feet had been trying to move away and Draco wasn’t letting him.
figured a
. Saying he’d known all along. That he’d never trusted him. That he’d been right. Harry hated him. Gaulding even had the guts to try and get Harry to be his partner now that Dra-
‘The whole thing?’ Draco asked with a raised eyebrow.
‘I know, but you’re going to like this even less.’ Harry forced himself to take a deep breath before Draco continued. ‘As we’ve discussed before, I have a recognizable face, much like yours, so going in with my own face seemed like a no-go. When I graduated as an Auror it was all over the papers and we’ve been in them since. Anything else we could do would either be too risky or unsustainable. So, Amelia had the idea to make it as real as possible. That way if they have me take Veritaserum, I’ll be able to pass because I won’t
‘Yes well, not everyone wants to be as big of a know-it-all as Granger.’ There was a little of the familiar venom. ‘And it’s not like I’ve had much else to do than study. Not all of us have to do interviews, get medals and sign people’s foreheads all day.’
However, the universe clearly hated him because it was not simple. Well, finding the man responsible was, he really hadn’t made that big of an effort to conceal his identity, but the arrest wasn’t. They could have just send the Hit Wizards after the guy, but from the description they had he seemed like a nervous, squirrely kind of guy. Not exactly a huge danger.
‘Amelia, this is my sister Ginny and that’s my brother George.’ He said gesturing at the siblings in question. ‘Guys, this is Amelia Frost.’
‘He’s
That night Harry had nightmares of the Triwizard Tournament labyrinth. He slept even less than usual.
It was strange, he’d never really thought about doing anything besides become an Auror, but he hadn’t anticipated the amount of paperwork that was involved in what they did.
And he's back! I didn't want to leave you all in suspense too long! We're heading into the final few chapters now. This has been fun!
‘What do you know? Is it bad? Is he okay?’ She pushed herself back, frantically trying to push her hair back behind her ear where it had sprung free from her tight bun.
‘It’s pretty.’ He traced a finger along the green, gold scales of the snake. As it slithered around his wrist a little further, it made its scales shimmer and shine. He looked up at the student. She looked unimpressed.
‘Fine, I’ll think about it.’ Malfoy still looked unsure, like he thought there was no way it would ever work out.
‘Now that sounds vaguely dirty.’ Malfoy rolled his eyes so hard it had to hurt.
‘They’re over there!’ He called out, flinching as a spell impacted nearby and blew something up.
‘What would we even do, if we weren’t Aurors anymore?’ Harry asked as Draco draped his arm over his shoulder.
‘You won it from me, it’s allegiance is to you now.’ Malfoy said, but Harry could see his fingers twitching at his side.
would work with him.’ He shrugged. Ron elbowed him in the side, but Harry ignored him. ‘Look, Minister. I understand that this is a strange situation, but the Wizengamot cleared him, he was found not guilty. Should he not be allowed to go after a job he wants? Should he not show an interest in catching wizards hurting others?’ Shacklebolt turned to Malfoy.
And they were good at it too. Very good. Draco and Harry quickly gained the reputation of being a great pair. Draco was the more cautious and calculating one while Harry was the better in stressful situations. They complemented each other, but they were different enough to make it so that they had different views on cases. They both had a different expertise, a different way of looking at the world. They just worked.
‘Well, I would have
He’d been unable to look away from those pale grey eyes since he’d gotten close enough to touch. There was a warmth in them that Harry only ever saw around himself and he’d seen once around Narcissa. Something different than what was on his face around his friends.
‘I wouldn’t be worried about
. Now that he was an adult (and yes that was still strange), he could make his own choices and he wanted to get a tattoo to represent his parents. He wanted to have a reminder of them that wasn’t a lightning bolt on his forehead. That was a reminder of their sacrifice, he wanted a reminder of their
‘Okay first of all, keep your voice down. Second, we’ve been over this okay. You want to hold on to Hogwarts rivalries, you’re allowed to do that, but I don’t want to anymore. I want to try and get along with him because for Merlin’s sake Ron, haven’t we fought enough?’ Harry said in a low tone.
followed closely by “where the bloody fuck is Amelia I am going to kill her”.
‘Okay, but if I take a break, you’re taking a break too.’ He wasn’t about to get rest while Draco did the work for the both of them. Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling.
.’ Harry stressed. ‘He was a kid, a
Draco nodded in approval when Harry came from his room again. They headed out of the apartment and Apparated to the Manor. Seeing it again, after such a long time, looming over him made Harry stop dead in his tracks.
Ginny said he had a bleeding heart, that he was caring about the wrong people, but she didn’t understand, she hadn’t been there.
‘Okay, sure.’ Draco’s eyes widened minutely, like he hadn’t expected Harry to agree. Was- was this a test? Well, that only made Harry more determined to make this successful.
He could see the exact moment where Malfoy realized which wand Harry was holding.
. He stopped and turned to face Draco, sitting on the edge of his own desk.
‘And how did you come up with this idea?’ Minister Shacklebolt asked. Malfoy glanced at Harry.
The plan was set in motion three days later.
Over his heart, there was lighting. Proper lightning, coming from a dark stormy cloud. It forked out and Harry could almost hear the crackle of it, that’s how real it looked. Draco had lightning tattooed over his heart. He blinked a few times before looking up. Draco had smoothed out his face.
‘Yes, I got that.’ Harry bit out before snapping his mouth shut and forcing himself to breathe. ‘Polyjuice?’ He started to pace between their desks.
‘I would hope so.’ Malfoy said turning and walking backwards a few steps. ‘I was amazing. I’m an expert at being interrogated by now.’ He smirked before turning back around and heading off again. Harry found himself rolling his eyes at his retreating back, but also… smiling?
Draco was right. Beyond the grandeur of some of the rooms, the Manor really didn’t seem all that familiar to him. There was nothing he recognized about the small sitting room Draco lead him into.
.’ Ginny sighed deeply.
‘Weird.’ Ginny said, making a face. ‘It’s very strange to be the only Weasley there, first of all. Also, even though the castle has been repaired, it’s like you can still feel what happened. Some of the older students who were involved in the battle have nightmares, there’s a few repeat seventh years that are really struggling, you can just
trust me.’ Draco dropped himself in his chair with uncharacteristic loose limbs. ‘They’re sending me undercover.’ Harry’s fingers froze in the middle of the rhythm he’d been tapping.
he like?’ Draco looked a little surprised.
‘You’re welcome.’ Draco said setting his own mug down before sticking his hand in the pocket of his red Auror jacket and producing something wrapped in a tissue which he came to drop on Harry’s desk as well. He didn’t wear his jacket often, but they’d been out in the field this morning for official business, so both of them were wearing their official outfits. ‘Eat that.’ He pointed at the little mystery package.
‘That was months ago.’ Harry stopped himself from arguing, recognizing the distraction for what it was. ‘You still haven’t told me how they’re planning on concealing your identity if you’re going to be undercover for months.’ Draco actually flinched a little at that.
and Draco had just sort of taken it all in stride. Harry had expected he would drive Draco mad within the first few days.
‘Well you don’t have much room anymore on there, but I’m going to guess torso. Left side.’ Harry grinned. He might have been keeping that spot open deliberately and Draco seemed to have noticed.
‘No, that’s fine.’ Harry said, unable to stop himself from keeping her in his sightlines as she herded Draco towards a different door than the one they’d come in through. Harry sighed. The room was very nice, very Malfoy, very expensive. All dark wood and silver and green accents. A lot of thought had probably been put into the interior and Harry was most certainly not fancy enough to understand the intricacies of it.
the time for one of their patented arguments. He forced himself not to snap at Draco.
‘Relax, Harry. It’s good news, they finally,
‘What the bloody hell are you on about-‘ Draco asked, Merlin he got grouchy when he was hurting. ‘Oh.’ He said when the buildings moved to make place for number 12.
‘I’m sorry mister Potter, the trail has already started and you are not on the registered list of witnesses for the prosecution.’ The Auror said. Harry smiled.
‘Of bloody fucking course I’m upset.’
‘Not everything is about Hogwarts houses, Potter.’ Harry rolled his eyes but headed into his room to search for the green shirt. He left the top few buttons open and rolled his sleeves up to above his elbows. A little of Draco and a little of Harry.
, this one was his.
‘I didn’t know tattoos could do that.’ Harry managed, his voice sounded a little choked. For Merlin’s sake, what the hell? What was wrong with him?
‘I send Ron home a while ago.’ She said as a greeting.
‘Sorry to interrupt, but I have something I need to give you.’ Harry said, again trying not to look threatening as he took the wand from his pocket. The two Malfoys still tensed. The two Aurors didn’t seem worried though. Whether that was because it was Harry or because they wouldn’t care if he hexed them, he wasn’t sure. He hoped it was the first option.
Harry shrugged.
He went back to Grimmauld place. He had Kreacher get a singular bedroom and the kitchen liveable and spend the next two months living there.
He hoped that time would help him get better. If he had known this was the price he’d have to pay for defeating Voldemort, he would still have done it, of course he would have, but at least he would have known what he was getting himself into.
‘Because I’m nervous about it?’ Draco sighed.
‘That is not the only way to control someone.’ Harry said firmly. He was glad Hermione had helped him prepare for this, even if she hadn’t done it entirely voluntarily. ‘In fact, the easiest way to get someone to do what you want is to threaten them or their loved ones with bodily harm or death. Both mister Malfoy’s father and mother were at one point
It was one of his favourite things to be honest. He really liked Draco’s hands, they were so elegant and to see them work on the little buttons was very nice. There was also the slow exposure of pale skin, of collarbones and stomach.
‘Was there some kind of Sleeping Draught in this?’ Harry asked, motioning with the mug as they headed from the room.
‘Just tell me what’s going on. I was worried.’ Harry didn’t mean for his voice to come out that sincere, but it did.
‘Thank you, Harry.’
‘Well, I never asked
Harry also noticed him in Potions (unsurprising), Transfiguration and DADA. Hermione mentioned he’d also been in her Ancient Runes and Arithmancy NEWTs (she might not have offered the information without prompting, Harry
‘If this gets me fired I am going to be very upset.’ Malfoy muttered when Harry caught up with him.
He didn’t seem bothered by that. He just stood there looking all proper in his expensive robes with his shiny hair and perfectly blank expression. Harry was impressed by his ability to appear unbothered. He’d probably been prepared for this.
‘Oh shut up, Potter.’
‘No, no, like I said, it’s fine. I can be professional, please don’t ship me off to Gaulding or something.’
It wasn’t until the ceremony (which lasted about thirty minutes too long as far as Harry was concerned) was over and their group had moved to a nearby Wizarding pub that Harry got a few seconds alone with Malfoy. Malfoy dragged them to a table in the back corner of the pub as Ron and Amelia veered off to get the first round. Baez and the other two had gotten stopped as soon as they entered the pub by what seemed to be Gaulding’s father. The Weasley family was there too and Hermione would be joining them a little bit later.
So he went and found Robards and just told him straight up that he needed a break. Robards looked at him up and down and nodded.
This chapter is a bit of a jumbled mess, but I'm not sure how to make it better so you'll just have to deal with it.
‘It’s up to you.’ Draco said like it pained him. Harry snorted.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Junior Auror, technically.’ Harry said. ‘Parkinson, how are you?’ Her eyebrows twitched upwards.
‘Gryffindor red.’ He whispered and if looks could kill, Harry would have dropped dead on the spot.
‘That’s your defence?’ She asked with a grin.
stop him?
‘Basically, yes. It’s flame burns so hot it is blue as well, it goes with my aesthetic.’ Draco actually grinned at that. He did that so rarely, Harry found himself basking in it every time. ‘I take it you don’t have any tattoos?’
After lunch, they went their separate ways and Harry found himself sitting on his couch grinning stupidly at the wall. It had been his favourite Saturday in a while- wait. Saturday? Didn’t Draco have his Slytherin lunch on Saturday’s? Yeah no, Harry remembered because he’d joined them at some point. Had Draco blown off his friends to have lunch with Harry? He hadn’t even hesitated or mentioned he had somewhere else to be. Huh. Maybe they’d skipped a week? Maybe he’d already said he wouldn’t join them because he knew his thing with Harry might run late?
‘Did you see the cut on Amelia’s forehead? Or how she was clutching her ribs? She wouldn’t have been able to cover you properly. Now get your Portkey and get Ron to St Mungo’s.’ Draco’s head snapped towards him from where he’d been peering out from behind their cover.
‘Alright, Mister Potter, go ahead.’ Minister Shacklebolt said.
‘Yeah, pretty much.’ Harry shrugged.
‘Get the Minister here.’ Oh great. Malfoy took a few tentative steps closer to Harry, his eyes still on Robards.
‘And why is that?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Right, because that is so me.’
Harry flew through the Resilience training like it was nothing and Malfoy kept up.
First, Harry secured the note he’d written to the owl’s leg and he let Malfoy tell the owl where to go. Someone named Missy Fletcher, who was apparently the witch who’d done Draco’s tattoo. Then as the owl smoothly took off out of the room, he went and unwrapped the little mystery tissue present. It was one of the chocolate chip cookies from the cafeteria.
‘Are we really having this discussion again?’ Draco asked. He was wearing an almost pearly white shirt today and it made him look ethereal. Sometimes Harry wondered who exactly he got dressed like that for.
‘Good.’
‘Sod off, Malfoy.’ Harry said, but it lacked any heat. Huh. Banter. ‘I’m serious though, this is impressive. What are you going to do with these?’ He waved the parchment at Malfoy. His face sobered immediately. His smirk disappeared and his face went tight. He shrugged, a sharp little gesture. Every little bit that he had relaxed was gone now.
‘Yes well, I was putting off telling you.’ He looked mildly concerned. ‘You’re not going to like this part.’
Maybe that was part of why he wanted to forgive Malfoy so badly and start over with him, because
A tawny owl came fluttering into the room right before Draco who was carrying two mugs. The owl landed on his desk, hooting softly. Draco set one of the mugs on Harry’s desk and he caught a whiff of tea.
better than he’d done two months ago.
Draco, but Harry just stared back defiantly. Robards didn’t comment as he started the briefing. Harry threw Draco a self-satisfied smirk, he rolled his eyes.
The character and aptitude tests felt a little bit like an interrogation. They circled back to the same questions several times and put more and more pressure on him, trying to get him to admit he was lying or holding something back. Harry could feel his temper flare, but he bit his tongue as he knew that was exactly what they wanted. He managed to be only mildly sarcastic and he managed not to laugh at some of their more stupid questions. When he stepped out into the sunshine (him and Ron had agreed to go grab some dinner before heading home), he found himself squinting. It wasn’t sunny very often in London and Harry was glad he’d taken off his robes before he stepped out, because the sun actually had some warmth to it.
‘So, what are your plans now?’ Harry asked, turning back to Malfoy. He wasn’t sure
‘Ah, but the rest of it is true?’ Malfoy smirked.
‘I haven’t decided.’ There was a challenging lit to his voice now. Like he wanted Harry to argue with him. ‘It’s not going to be easy to find someone willing to employ me with that whole deal.’ He motioned towards his left arm. Right. The Dark Mark, a permanent reminder of the war, of what he’d done or hadn’t done.
‘I know that, because you’re a stupid self-sacrificing Gryffindor, but I don’t
‘Yes. We all did things during the war we’re not proud of. I know I did, but I’m Harry Potter so no one judged me for it. You deserve better than what they were going to give you.’ Draco stopped walking. Harry stopped and looked back at him. His face was blank but his eyes were searching Harry’s face.
‘We have reached a verdict.’ Harry was drawn from his musing. He immediately felt his nerves spike. He could see Malfoy swallow thickly. ‘We, the Wizengamot, find Draco Lucius Malfoy not guilty on all charges.’ Harry released the breath he hadn’t even realized he was holding. The media’s cameras flashed. The spell holding Malfoy to the chair must have been released as soon as the verdict was announced because Malfoy sagged forward and set his elbows on his knees burying his face in his hands. His stupidly blond hair formed an extra little curtain as it fell over his forehead, giving him a few moments to himself to process whatever he was feeling.
Their graduating class was dubbed the Post War 7. They were the largest graduating Auror class since the First War. It consisted of Harry, Ron and Malfoy and:
It was incredible.
‘To us.’ The beer was smooth and made him feel warm from the inside.
‘Malfoy here wants to apply to become an Auror.’ He said with clear disdain in his voice. Malfoy straightened up a little further, making Harry feel even more self-conscious about his slouching posture.
‘Okay, please heal my friend, Kreacher.’ Kreacher simply snapped his fingers and the wound on Draco’s side started knitting itself back together. Draco gasped, swayed and actually went a little green. Harry tightened his hand on Draco’s knee.
‘Get us out of here Potter.’ So he did.
Months passed, Malfoy turned nineteen and Harry got him (along with some help from George) a truly obnoxious birthday card that wouldn’t stop singing Happy Birthday until Malfoy actually said “Thank you, oh great birthday card” to the card. He refused for three hours. It was hysterical. Harry had even been able to add Malfoy’s name. “Draco” had felt a little weird on his tongue, but Malfoy’s face was worth it.
They fell back into silence for a while. A few times, Harry tried to make himself say that they should go back inside, but the words wouldn’t come. He didn’t want to go back, he wanted to go home.
‘See you later mate.’ Ron grinned before taking Hermione’s hand and taking off.
‘That’s better than pizza,’ Harry grinned back. ‘and there’s very little that’s better than pizza.’
‘Look mate, I know you miss Malfoy. Hell even I miss the smarmy git a little bit, but you need to take care of yourself.’ Ron said. His face went a little blank before he continued. ‘Oh Merlin and Morgana.’ Ron sounded horrified. ‘I am friends with Draco Malfoy.’ Harry snorted out a laugh and Hermione smiled. ‘Not the point, anyways, Moine’s right. You look awful.’
’ He asked, actually sounding confused.
‘I will admit he didn’t say a single nasty thing to any of my family while he was here.’ She pursed her lips. ‘But I’m not convinced. Ron has a conspiracy theory that Malfoy is hypnotising you or has you under Imperius.’ Harry rolled his eyes.
‘But how often do we actually get to do that?’ Draco’s smile was softer than it had any right to be. ‘Most of the time we’re coming in after the bad thing has already happened. Have you not seen enough darkness to last you a lifetime?’ Harry considered that for a second.
‘There’s no one out back.’ There were reporters at the front of the house, falling over each other to try and get the story first. Thinking about them made Harry feel even more sick. Harry pushed the door open with his magic, unwilling to touch anything here with his bare hands.
his coffee was done. Now things were starting to go his way.
He searched around in his bag (he’d gotten a bottomless one, just like Hermione) for something to entertain himself with while he waited for Ron. He didn’t find anything, but it wasn’t necessary.
‘You went behind my back?’ Harry realized his hands were shaking.
‘Well, why a snake? You were a Gryffindor, right?’ The blue lining of her robes was distinctly Ravenclaw, but the way she asked the question reminded him a lot of Hermione when they were younger. The near annoyance with herself because she didn’t understand something.
Harry glared, but downed the potion. It tasted bloody awful, but the effect was immediate. Harry’s stomach stopped rolling every time he moved, his limbs didn’t feel like lead anymore and his head stopped pounding. The headache didn’t go away completely, but it was leagues better than before.
. It had amazing silvery-blue scales, with tiny blue flames coming from its nostrils. It looked wild, with long, nearly silver talons. It had a collar around its neck with a chain attached to it, its head tilted towards the sky, up over Draco’s shoulder blade. In a loop it would bare its teeth, tense its body and break its chains. Harry couldn’t figure out if some parts were actually coloured for the tattoo or if that was just Draco’s skin.
Comments make me squeal with delight!
, now get out of my way.’ He was about three seconds away from hitting his friend with a Body Bind Curse just so he could get past him. He did not have time for this. Ron sighed deeply, he looked exhausted and Harry felt a spark of guilt in his stomach, but he told it to shut up and he held firm. This was important. ‘Just- just get some rest, okay? Let me do this.’ Harry softened his voice and tried to look calm and collected.
‘I’ll be undercover, so no.’ Draco sighed. ‘Relax, Potter, I’m a big boy, I’ll be fine.’ Harry tried not to sound like he didn’t believe a word of it.
“I don’t know,” he says, breaking away from Harry’s held gaze and turning his grey hues towards the loose thread on Harry’s duvet. “I mean, I don’t know if it counts.” He picks at the white thread with his long fingers, and Harry reaches towards them.
“I prefer this to us fighting,” Harry admits eventually. “Hermione and Ron are being weird about it, but I prefer this, actually.”
“I’m relieved,” Draco tells him.
“Yeah?”
P.S. I like your tattoo idea, a lot actually. I’m curious to see how it comes out. Send a picture of that too, if you like?
Harry squeezes Draco’s foot harder, only loosening his grip when Draco jerks back and whispers “ow,” scooting closer to Harry then, leaning into his space.
“I have a spliff for you, don’t worry.”
“Maybe we should just obliviate him, Draco.”
It’s not that Harry’s ever really cared much about his social status, people are fickle with their opinions and always will be, but the part that made Harry feel good was that the reason they thought he was cool had nothing to do with him being some sort of almighty saviour and everything to do with his ability to chug down three-fourths of a bottle of Firewhiskey without issue.
“You don’t want me, you just want to fuck me, you’re sick you know – to want me so badly when you’re so disgusted by me, when you –”
Where did you get a CD anyway?
CW: Pics of food!
“Oh my god, it’s not like we’ve never fought before–”
“I am sorry, you know. For everything.” Draco blinks rapidly, trying to keep his voice steady. “I was awful, I was so, so awful. I never want to be that person ever again, I hate what I’ve done, hate the person I was - I wish I could take it back, do things differently, but I’m so sorry –” Draco stops talking, doesn’t think it’s fair if he cries like this. Would rather he didn’t cry.
Draco had been nervous until the very last minute, but then it came time for him to go undercover and play nice and he had been brilliant. His face an unbreachable mask of apathy as his monotone voice earned the trust of those he would soon betray.
“No,” Harry rasps. “I don’t want to be with anyone but you.”
1. Sociopath is an outdated term, and the proper diagnosis is ASPD (Anti-Social Personality Disorder).
“Nothing.” Harry’s voice is rough, low, bitter.
“Mother knows,” Draco says. “My father doesn’t deserve to know.”
“Fancy a cheeky top up?” She says, dark red lips at Draco’s ear and arms wrapped around his neck.
“Movie nights,” Draco says, slowly.
P.S. I've always wondered, did it scar?
“You’re getting crumbs all over your shirt,” drawls Draco, picking up his now empty cup. “Who is it?”
“Baby, please, tell me what’s wrong,” Harry asks, lifting himself up, body pressing into Draco. He’s still hard inside him and Draco’s own desire sits at aroused attention in the space between their bodies. “Who did this to you?” Harry places Draco’s head between his calloused hands. “I’ll kill them,” he says, and it’s not an empty threat. The first time he killed a man he was eleven. The second, seventeen. Harry presses the hands that burned a man to death and uses them to pull Draco to him, to kiss him. “I’ll kill whoever did this to you.”
Harry could just cast a warming charm, but maybe Draco’s request not to be touched also has to do with not being touched by any part of Harry, even his magic. He reaches for a beige knit-blanket on the sofa-chair to his right instead and hands it over to Draco. “It’s infused with an ever-lasting warming charm,” he tells him.
“Yes,” says Draco. “I realised after I spoke with her that I might have been unfair towards the people I was reaching out to.” Draco takes a breath. “That my guilt was weighing me down, and still I was making other people responsible for it.”
“Mate, I need you there. It’s our first Christmas without Fred – how can you, you’re just going to–?”
Their clothes come off, it’s hard to keep track of how when all Harry cares to stay focused on is the growing heat in his body and the ice-cold feel of Draco’s hard lines against his own.
“Are you not going to tell me then?”
They sleep, Harry holding Draco in his arms, feeling something uncoil in his chest, feeling the monster relax against the chains he’s placed it in. That’s the first night Harry wonders if perhaps he’s being a bit cruel to himself, keeping a part of who he is then and now chained due to an implacable shame.
“Very,” says Draco. “I thought you were bad, but he was so much worse.”
“Do you need me to pull up his medical records, Potter? I’ll gladly do it, if only to show that my son has been struggling with his addiction for the past three or so years." Narcissa Malfoy sneers at him. "He was getting better. Of course, until he started living with you.”
, the blond git is a fucking Death Eater – and yet, his brain malfunctions.
Anyways, thanks for sending back the VHS. I really appreciate it actually, this one was my Godfather's copy - and it does indeed have a lot of sentimental value. He passed away, I'm sure you know the story - my Godfather was Sirius Black, cousin to your mother. Anyway, since you liked it so much, I bought you a copy that you could keep for yourself.
permanently scarred into his skin. Harry licks up the come that’s spilled onto the back of his hand, eyes hot and heavy on Draco who watches him with his mouth slightly open.
He’s thinking of Ginny in one moment and then in the next, his mind shifts, and chocolate brown eyes melt into clouded grey, fiery red burns into white-blond ash, and Draco Malfoy is pinned sharp beneath him where there once was Ginny’s soft curves. It fucks with his head, really.
Yeah, I don’t remember Dumbledore fondly most days. He’s...he did something I can never forgive. Maybe he did love me, but does that mean I have to forgive him? Have you forgiven your Father for what he’s done?
Harry touches his lip, it’s scabbing now. “At least someone thinks so.”
P.S. I completely relate to your point of not being able to see a Muggle therapist because of the limitation provided by Statute.
Harry stares at the white blond atop Malfoy’s head for a long time, before his eyes weaken with the nothingness that claims him and sends him into the carnage of his dreams.
Zabini mentioned to her that you just disappeared! I hadn’t realised that this move to the Muggle world was a secret. Anyways, they’ve been talking a bit. He said some nasty stuff to hear in 6th year about her being a blood traitor, and he’s trying to make it right now. I think he might like her though, not sure.
“Do you want to see me there?”
“Draco you don’t have to –"
“Yes.” Another shaky breath.
I hope it helps.
What do you think?
Draco sits up, bringing his kiss-swollen lips to the scar at Harry’s sternum, trailing his lips lower, in a devotion Harry hadn’t expected.
Draco hums, taking the blanket in his hand and wrapping it around himself from the shoulders, scooting closer to Harry. “You sure you’re not cold?”
Harry swallows.
Harry shrugs and takes the Firewhiskey from her, throws it back and chugs it down, taking deep gulps that burn the back of his throat in all the right ways. When he’s done, he wipes the moisture from his lips and hands the bottle back to her. Parkinson is smiling at him, all cat-like and predatory, and Harry hates that he knows it must mean he’s amused her.
Draco’s fingernails are scratching up Harry’s back, the sting of which sends a shiver of pleasure down his spine, making him thrust harder, faster, deeper.
Harry’s laughter is deep in his chest, he feels so good. He hits Draco harder, drawing blood this time. It’s just about the funniest thing he’s ever experienced. “Hit me. Come on, come on. Hit me too, yeah?”
Draco’s come is all over Harry’s hand, the one with the words
Draco doesn’t answer, instead moving to sit on the couch, pulling his long legs into his chest, resting his chin on his jogger-clad knee.
Harry lets Draco set the pace and is rewarded with the red that blooms across Draco’s pearly white skin, gifted with Draco’s hooded gaze, with his slick tongue, with the velvet heat of his mouth.
2. Always communicate what to expect in an argument (if you need to walk away, if you need to know the person is coming back).
“Only if you meant it.”
“Mate, we’re not asking you to–”
Theo and Draco stumble through the door eventually, holding each other up. Draco’s far more drunk than Theo if Draco’s half-lidded eyes and swaying head is anything to go by.
The lines get blurry because Harry knows who Draco is and Draco doesn't know it's Harry (yet) - but, we'll cross that bridge when we get there!
Malfoy is tense, tight – as rigid as Harry suspected him to be, and Harry realises that Malfoy likes to be coaxed into his pleasure. Malfoy responds to softness where Harry had expected Malfoy to goad him toward roughness.
Harry whimpers and helps Draco undo his belt, throwing it to the floor with a
Draco,
“S’alright, I think I’m starting to speak their language,” Neville shrugs, eyes glittering as he watches Nott over his butterbeer.
“But –” Harry cuts off with a groan, because Draco’s just brushed against that spot inside him, that spot that’ll drive him mad with pleasure. Draco notices it too and is focusing in on that spot, thrusting long and hard into Harry. Now Harry can’t stop, he has Draco’s arm to his face and he’s kissing with intent now. His heart is fluttering, he’s overwhelmed, and he can’t help the hurt he feels at the sight of Draco’s harm towards himself. “I want to, please just let me do what I
“Is that why I can never see the grey in your eyes?”
A flash of hurt crosses Theo’s face before he slips on the infamous Slytherin mask. “He’ll never love you,” he says, eyes on Harry, but it’s Draco who answers with, “I know.”
“Have your mates over and hang out.”
“Not really,” Harry says, eyes on Draco, watching the hues of blue highlight the silhouette of his sharp face. “I think I run hot.”
“Like where?” Draco asks, turning back to the task of rummaging through the lower cabinet for what Harry assumes is his saucepan, or maybe the pasta strainer. They’d decided on chicken Alfredo for tonight, simple, and easy after Draco’s long day of lessons.
“I wish you’d talk to me about important things,” Harry says, eyes fixed to the digital clock on his nightstand. If he’s done the math right, he has two, maybe three more minutes of Draco in his arms before he pulls away again.
‘What in Merlin’s name is the problem here?’ He asked. ‘Robards?’ He prompted when no one immediately started to speak.
‘I’ll miss you too.’ The words were as earnest as anything that came out of Draco’s mouth. Harry pushed himself off his desk and stepped closer to Draco. He didn’t miss the way his breath hitched, but he ignored it.
to get himself and his boyfriend a position at Hogwarts, I’m sure that will go over
Draco didn’t try to argue, so Harry hurried up the stairs and did indeed find an old bag of his with some shirts stuffed in it. They smelled clean if not a little musty, so he cast a refreshing spell on it and brought it downstairs. It was a plain, dark blue shirt, soft and worn, but without holes. All in all, it could have been way worse. He stepped back into the living room, shirt clenched in his fist. He was half way towards saying something when he stopped dead in his tracks. He knew his jaw dropped.
‘After we finish, you and I are getting drinks.’
5 experienced Aurors were supposed to come give them a talk about protecting yourself in combat and how to know when your foe was weakest.
‘You could have just let it go.’ He said, surprised by how tired his voice sounded.
‘Only if necessary.’ Harry said with a grin of his own, he fought not to let it turn into a smirk as he continued. ‘To make you smile like that I would do whatever it takes.’ Draco stared at him for a few seconds before making a face.
‘Who needs this many pillows? What are they all
They had already had a Junior Auror practically running out of the location while looking green and honestly, Harry was about three seconds away from doing the same. The wizard that lived here had been a very disturbed individual. There were, for lack of a better word,
‘I’m planning on speaking for your mother as well.’ He said and Malfoy’s head snapped up. He was quiet long enough that Harry had almost accepted he wasn’t going to say
‘Could you go through the wards and get her out?’ Harry asked. ‘We can deal with dismantling the house itself later?’
It had started with Mrs Malfoy and how he wouldn’t have been able to defeat Voldemort in the end if she hadn’t lied and told Voldemort Harry was dead that day in the forest. That’s what started his thoughts about the Malfoys. From Mrs Malfoy, he’d started thinking about Malfoy (Draco, that was) and his terrified face up in the tower the night that Dumbledore died.
‘Me neither.’ Harry admitted. ‘Also, we should probably have an actual proper, no shouting, no kissing conversation about our bloody job, but for now, can we just… not?’
His chin seemed pointier, probably because of his slightly sunken cheeks. He had dark circles under his eyes and his hair had gotten longer. He almost looked a little like his father, which send an involuntary shiver down Harry’s spine. Instead of the proud, Malfoy strut he was used to, he moved around the room like he was begging everyone to pay as little attention to him as possible. Like if he could have, he would have put on his strongest Notice-Me-Not charm. But Harry did notice. He’d spend years making sure that he knew where Malfoy was at all times and that hadn’t just stopped because they weren’t technically on opposite sides now.
When Robards came out, Hermione was finally allowed in, almost exactly when what had to be Amelia’s sister came bursting into the hospital. Draco had apparently sent her an owl to inform her that her sister had been hurt. She looked like a honey-blonde version of Amelia, maybe a few years older. She didn’t look at any of them, she only seemed to have time and energy to focus on her sister, which was fair.
‘Harry, sweetie. You’ve had a crush on Malfoy for
first and-’
‘Alright, I think I’m done for today.’ He announced. He could finish the rest tomorrow before he went for lunch at Ron and Hermione’s. Draco looked up, then at the clock and sighed.
‘Not really.’ Harry admitted. ‘I just- I don’t understand how you could do that to another living thing. It makes me sick.’
Harry cleared his throat as he stepped back.
‘Do you want to work on your rapport here? We could work together, it’d be quicker that way.’ Harry offered. He wasn’t about to let this tension stay in Draco’s spine. That wouldn’t do. Draco looked a little surprised at the offer, but quickly smoothed out his face.
‘I told you to drink.’
. ‘Or did you-‘ Harry wasn’t sure how to continue that sentence.
‘I just love how they pretend I can’t hear every single word they’re saying.’ Malfoy mumbled. Harry huffed out a soft laugh.
‘I didn’t, my mother did. She had a lot of time on her hands during her house arrest.’
‘I- I don’t really know what’s going on exactly, but I am not really interested in going on a- a date with you, sorry.’
but as soon as Harry started to walk away Malfoy spoke up.
‘Alright.’ The two of them headed down the quiet street towards the centre of town.
Harry worked on his paperwork for a while. It was perfectly boring as usual. It wasn’t until he finished his report and dropped it in his outbox where it disappeared with a soft
stayed over?’ The corner of her mouth quirked up in a smirk. ‘That is interesting.’
(also I haven't read the actual books in a long time, I did do research for this fic though)
‘You chose it because it fits your colour scheme?’ Harry offered with a slight smile. The corner of Draco’s mouth quirked up.
‘No one has lived here in a long time, now come on, shirt off.’ Harry snapped his fingers twice and with a pop, Kreacher appeared. Harry had actually been snapping his fingers at Draco, not to call for Kreacher, but alright.
Harry didn’t enjoy coming to Diagon Alley much anymore. The magic that had surrounded the place when he was younger just wasn’t quite there anymore. Especially when people stared at him like this. He generally tried to be a little more inconspicuous when he came here but today he’d come straight from work and he was wearing his Auror coat. He tried to ignore the stares and just get what he needed and get out, but all those eyes on him made his skin feel itchy.
‘It feels pretty bloody bad too Potter, for Merlin’s sake, do something about it.’ Draco snapped.
‘Well, yes. Great. Now can we focus?’
‘We solved a pretty big case yesterday, so we had a drink to celebrate it. Draco stayed over.’
‘Walk in the front door?’
‘That’s good.’ Harry said. Draco smirked again.
‘Well thanks. It’s good to see your lovely face as well. With the bruises and the dark circles.’ Harry made a few exaggerated motions at his own face. Draco rolled his eyes, but the gesture was so familiar Harry didn’t even really care.
The only reason Harry didn’t go and complain to Robards about it was because he knew it wasn’t exactly his choice either. He’d basically lost an Auror duo because now he always had to assign both Harry’s team and Gaulding’s team to the same case and they didn’t even work well together.
He looked exhausted. That was probably the first thing that made it through the wave of “bloody hell he’s actually here”. The second was the bruises on the side of his face and his split lip.
‘You are so dramatic, Potter.’ He said, those silvery eyes drilling into Harry’s.
‘Merlin knows why.’ Draco groaned as he turned the corner. Harry walked at a brisk pace and that’s probably why it took him a second to realize Draco had stopped walking. They’d been moving past a tall hedge and Harry hadn’t noticed anything, but Draco clearly had.
‘No.’ He eventually admitted. Harry wasn’t exactly about to mention that might be because Harry had asked him not to.
‘Oh, well, alright then.’ She shuffled out of the booth after George and Ginny and disappeared into the crowd with Ron trailing after them.
got some rest but now I’m working with Young and I don’t know how she does it but she doesn’t need sleep like normal people do and so I forget the time and then suddenly it’s 8pm and I haven’t eaten and then I’m too tired to make something and so I just crash, but then I have nightmares because I don’t have Dreamless Sleep anymore and I keep not getting a new supply and I’m just- I’m just overwhelmed.’
‘Fine, suit yourself.’ Harry shrugged as he headed into the communal lounge. The coffee there was terrible, but there was something about that that felt comforting. Plus, coffee was half the reason Harry managed to stay awake when he wasn’t running on adrenaline.
‘Yeah.’
Comments make me squeal with delight!
Harry found himself standing in a room in a house on the outskirts of London. It had looked abandoned at first and once you stepped through the Glamours, it honestly didn’t get much better. Just more bloody. It had to be one of the worst locations they’d been at.
have something to say about your glasses.’
‘Good morning everyone, I am positively sta-‘ Blaise Zabini came waltzing into the room and stopped mid-word.
‘About you.’
was an example of something he probably wouldn’t have said if he’d thought it through first. Another Gryffindor trait, however? Going backwards wasn’t really something they subscribed to, so forwards it was.
‘Just- just don’t die, okay Malfoy?’ He wasn’t sure why he suddenly slipped back into the last name habit, but he did. Distance. If Draco was really leaving for months, maybe a year, Harry needed distance. He’d lose his mind otherwise.
.’ Harry complained, trying to step past his best mate who was blocking the way to the fireplace.
Ron chose that moment to swoop in and steal Harry away. Harry didn’t leave Malfoy’s side very often anymore. Harry’s presence meant that others left him be and when Harry
‘Well, he never said this outright but I think he felt like he made his choice during the first war. I don’t think he gave himself a second chance.’ Not like Draco did. ‘At the end, I don’t think my father believed the Dark Lord would win, but he did, of course, believe in what the Dark Lord was preaching.’
‘I’m apologizing’ she said through clenched teeth. ‘for trying to turn you over to the Dark Lord.’
He started heading in their general direction. He wasn’t trying to approach them per se (except he really was), he would just casually pass by them on his way to… Padma who he was pretty sure he’d seen somewhere in the hall. He didn’t have to figure out a way to casually start up a conversation with them (luckily because he had no idea how to do that), because Greengrass spoke up when he came near them.
‘I supposed that would be alright.’ Which was Malfoy for “yes, I’d love to!”.
‘Like a date? But I thought if I asked you out you’d kick me in the nuts?’ Harry had fled into the office to get some reprieve, but now he was just feeling even more off balance.
‘Alright, fine. Maybe you should owl her, see when she has time.’
‘Parkinson?’ He said, unable to keep his voice entirely blank. She squared her shoulders, seemingly telling herself to just get it over with.
‘I do, for both of them together. I want something for them individually.’ Draco nodded and then shrugged.
As soon as Narcissa’s eyes landed on Harry she pulled back. If Harry hadn’t known better he would have said that Malfoy made a wounded noise at that. She cleared her throat and pointedly looked at Harry who approached them as non-threateningly as he could.
‘But not you?’
‘I want to get a tattoo.’ He said as he put his empty plate on the coffee table. Now it was Hermione’s turn to look surprised. Ron released a sigh of relief.
Here I am again! Back for chapter 2!
‘I mean, probably. I think Robards is a great Auror, but I don’t really want to become like him. So tired and jaded and angry at the world, I don’t want that, but I already feel like it sometimes.’ Harry admitted.
In the courses that Malfoy struggled, Harry excelled and the other way around. They were strangely good together and Harry would not say it out loud, but they were kind of
been him, that he’d had a lot of help from a lot of people, it didn’t seem to matter.
Their next week was tense. They’d had minor arguments before, but most of them had been about cases, not about… them. Harry just didn’t really get it.
Also I have no idea if a house elf would actually be able to heal someone, but I'm just running with it.
‘I hate this new Wise Potter thing you have going on.’ Draco groaned as he stood and grabbed his own Auror coat. They hurried towards Robards office where the intel would be shared. Robards raised a single eyebrow as Harry came into the room
‘Afternoon.’ Sure enough, Draco’s voice drifted over from the living room. Harry kicked his shoes off and headed to where he’d heard Draco’s voice. He was sitting on one of the loose soft velvety chairs, looking serious and more… soft than he’d looked in a while, his hands folded under his pointy chin.
‘What. Do. You. Want?’ Malfoy asked again. Harry threw his hands to the side in frustration.
He remembered everything, which was both good and mildly horrifying, considering that he’d said some
‘Oh come on, if you’d just let me and Daphne teach you how to take your hair from “attacked by angry Hippogriffs” to “oh I just rolled out of bed”, it would make such a difference.’ She was actually pouting at him now. This was strange. Strange because it didn’t feel incredibly strange. He was having an actual, civil conversation with Pansy Parkinson. About his hair.
‘I know, but Hermione did some research and she said it’s possible for it to switch back if the wand is returned to the original owner. So,’ Harry pushed the wand a little closer. ‘take it. I have no use for it anyways.’
‘Oh! Mom said that she would love to meet you. Come on, let’s go find her, I’m sure she’s around here somewhere.’ Ginny said with a bright grin, but also very much a grin with an edge of “do not bother arguing with me”. Harry knew that grin very well. Ron shrugged and got up.
‘Well I’m glad
‘Mate! Wasn’t that super weird?’ Ron immediately asked. ‘It was just an interrogation, how is that supposed to tell them if we’ll be good Aurors or not?’
Harry almost didn’t want to put his shirt back on and he spend about five minutes staring at his new tattoo in the mirror Missy had set up for this exact purpose.
‘Harry, I know you want to believe that the Slytherins aren’t inherently evil, and I agree with you on that, but for most of the ones in our year one or both of their parents went to Azkaban after the war. You need to be careful. Just because you want to leave the war and Hogwarts Houses behind you doesn’t mean they will do so as well.’ She said using her most pleading look to try and convince him.
At first, Ron was horrified that Harry was letting Draco supply him with Dreamless Sleep now. He was convinced Draco would try to poison him. Luckily, when Ron and Amelia (along with Gaulding and Blueroot) were promoted a month after Harry and Draco, Ron figured out that they had a common enemy.
in fact put thought into this. A lot of it. All of his life he’d had people look at him and then their eyes would dart up to his scar. Ever since he was a baby he’d been marked with something he had no choice in. He had never gotten to
a tight fit. Still, there was something in the way that she was looking at him that made something uncomfortable bloom in Harry’s stomach. He focussed on not dropping the beers and setting them down gently. Ginny had pulled up a chair and Ron allowed Harry to slink past him back to his old seat.
‘Just be careful.’ She reached over to squeeze his forearm. ‘We’ll see you at dinner.’
‘Are you- are you just proud that you’re better at something than I am?’
‘What exactly are you apologizing for?’ Hermione asked, her tone making it immediately clear that she thought there were a lot of things. Parkinson clenched her jaw so tightly Harry was concerned for her teeth.
‘Ugh, I am dating a Gryffindor, this is going to be an adventure.’ Draco sighed, but he looked immensely pleased with himself.
doing it!’ They all turned towards the yelling voice and found that it was Zabini who had snapped at Malfoy. Malfoy straightened up, drawing himself to his full height, for the first time since the trial he looked like himself. Whatever Malfoy hissed back at him was too quiet for Harry to catch, but it didn’t look friendly.
‘Potter, in here.’ Robards ordered as he marched past their cubicles with an extra serious expression on his face. Robards always looked serious, but in gradations. This was heading towards his “someone died” look. Harry pushed himself away from his desk and out of his chair, grabbing his coat from the back of the rolling chair (one muggle invention Harry insisted on having in the office).
I'll be back tomorrow for another one!
‘Look, I’ll go to the Ministry, inform Granger and see what contact info we have on file for Amelia.’ Draco squeezed his arm and Harry looked up at him automatically. He’d been staring blankly at the doors. ‘Would that make you feel better?’ Those silly grey eyes were so sincere, Harry felt a treacherous wave of affection. He forced himself to smile.
She was also the reason he’d actually started thinking about why so many Slytherins ended up on the Dark Side.
‘That’s not going to happen.’ Harry said with as much conviction as he could muster. Their badges were a little different from proper Auror badges, that just had a large A on a silver badge, theirs said JA. ‘We’re young, so it might be a year or so, but they’ll promote us when we prove we’re ready.’
‘Yes, that would make me feel better. Thank you Draco.’ He nodded slowly. His smile was still a little tight, but the look in his eyes was genuine.
‘Very cool.’ Ginny agreed. ‘I’ve been wanting a tattoo for ages, but mom would kill me, so I’m waiting until I’ve at least got my own place.’ She’d just started playing for the Holyhead Harpies and Harry knew she could
‘Alright.’ Missy said, rolling her chair around so that she was properly on Harry’s side now. She’d brought along a little tray and some instruments that Harry wouldn’t even dare to try and name. ‘So we’re having it run along your hip right? She motioned at the skin about an inch or two above the waistband of Harry’s jeans.
‘Oh please, they love the bloody ones.’ Harry said with a shrug. ‘As long as I don’t release one in the room and say whoever survives passes the class, they don’t care.’ Draco let out an inelegant snort.
‘Thank you sir.’
Okay, now for the not-so-fun part: telling Robards they’d left the office on a hunch without telling him. Harry jogged back to the main street. It wasn’t hard to find the trio of Aurors that included Robards (the advantage of the red robes). Harry knew exactly when Robards spotted him because his face went from “I am mad” to “What in the actual hell are you doing here?!”
‘Just tell me about the case oh wise Potions Master.’ Harry made an impatient motion with his hand.
‘We’re not talking about me.’
‘It’s been a while.’
He and Malfoy were dropped off somewhere on the outer edges of London and they had to find their way back without being caught by the Aurors send out to hunt them. Harry would have argued him and Malfoy were certainly at a disadvantage, considering there was no mistaking who that blonde hair belonged to.
‘I was thinking that maybe I’d want to get something for my parents, you know. I recently learned that Wizarding tattoos can move, how cool is that?’ Harry grinned.
Malfoy pushed him down on the chair furthest in the back and disappeared. He came back about a minute (or five) later and shoved a large glass of water into Harry’s hands.
), but Draco most likely also had feelings for him. He did things for Harry he didn’t do for anyone else, he allowed Harry to do things he didn’t allow anyone else. Besides Harry, his closest friend in the office was probably Amelia and he
‘So they’re just for- for fun?’
‘He takes a lot of credit for other people’s work.’ Young was leaning against the wall next to the door, her favourite spot. ‘There’s a reason all Junior Aurors hate him.’
Amelia heard them first. The voices coming down the hallway. Excited voices, happy voices. Harry was out of his chair immediately. He nearly ran into Proudfoot as he rushed out of the breakroom.
‘Well, this is technically still Dawlish and Proudfoot’s case, they’re just bringing me in. You’ll probably have to work with a Junior Auror for a while.’
‘I don’t miss how it was in the end.’ Draco said, looking straight ahead. ‘But, I guess I do miss how things were in my childhood sometimes.’ He swallowed and a wry smile spread over his face. ‘It wasn’t perfect, but my father wasn’t a bad man.’ Harry wasn’t sure if he agreed on that, but then again, how well had he known Lucius Malfoy? ‘He really changed after our fourth year.’ After Voldemort came back.
‘I don’t ever really do this so you better enjoy it, but I wanted to say I’m sorry and thank you.’ She did sound a little bit like it pained her to get the words out.
? Buddy, you gotta help me here cause I’m bloody confused.’ Harry held up his hands in a helpless gesture.
‘Well, yeah.’ All the fight had drained out of him pretty quickly. Draco stared at him for a good minute, Harry fought not to squirm. He wasn’t ashamed of this and he was 95% sure Draco loved him back. Like 90% at least. Maybe 85%. The number may have dropped to about 60% in the time that Draco was silent.
(See the end of the chapter for

to really sit down and talk to
‘Hello Minister, I hope you don’t mind me sitting in on this?’ Harry said.
get it, because if you want to talk about debt, I owe you for trying to kill you in our sixth year.’ Malfoy rolled his eyes.
