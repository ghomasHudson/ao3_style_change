"Of course. Your curse or whatever seems to only affect the death eaters. Not all of them either, Draco was perfectly fine. I've never seen magic like that before, the whole room collapsed in on itself. It was awesome." Harry said with a mixture of pride and awe. I felt nothing but dread.
I thought I had gotten off easy, but when it came time to put our potion sample on his desk he looked up from the work he was marking, his anger still radiating from him.
He couldn’t kill me. I was far too valuable. The realization that I had worried all this time about him killing me when I was far safer than I had realized came to me. I couldn’t help but laugh. I stood up laughing feeling triumphant even as his anger increased.
"Finally! You were out cold my girl. How are you feeling?" Poppy asked her to try to gage her mental health. She looked around confused and sat up abruptly realizing she was in the hospital wing. Her eyes locked with mine and I expected anger, but I saw just pain instead.
“He has a few he has used around me. I haven’t found them in any book though.” I said not having really paid much attention to it before now. It was really peculiar he had so many spells he used that I had never heard before. Half the time he just flicked his hand and didn’t even say anything aloud casting magic effortlessly. I think the only time he actually verbalized them was when he was distracted with something.
I contemplated telling Harry, but he would no doubt freak out about having a piece of Voldemort inside him. It was up to me to track down the remaining pieces so we could kill Voldemort once and for all.
“I wish it would warm up already. I want to sit by the lake. All this snow and cold rain is driving me insane. Our manor is in south France you know? Its warm still this time of the year.” Draco fussed angrily. Since Voldemort had accepted his goal of spying on Harry they were hanging up publicly almost 24/7.
I was in awe of the huge panther, both in fear and amazement. It was much larger than what I ever thought and the way it growled at Lucius sent a shiver down my back. I was terrified.
"The Dark Lord's." I said nervously biting my lip. I wanted to indulge myself, but without an audience this time. He smiled darkly and leaned in whispering in my ear.
"I'll take your word for it. Whatever you want, take it." He said feeding me French toast apparently serious about his desire to fatten me up. I smiled, shaking my head.
"Let's go. Wear something warm." He said quietly, pulling me out of bed easily. I nodded nervous about the impending death eater meeting hoping nothing too dire was requested of me.
"Mmm...you know why you're here, don't you?" He asked me silkily, the threatening nature of his anger only thinly veiled. He paced around me slowly like a lion with its prey ready to pounce.
I wanted him to be wrong since I knew he was a horrid person, manipulative and cruel person. I wanted Dumbledore to be right and have only done the things he did out of kindness and love. That wasn't reality though. The more I thought about it, the less realistic the traditional black and white way of looking at things seemed.
“I never felt…I could literally feel my magic that time.” I said bewildered. He raised an eyebrow to this surprised at my statement.
"Sorry sir…I just…I was hungry." I stuttered my mind betraying me and taking me back to when he was slowly entering me, holding me steady so he could have total control. I blushed looking down at the cereal realizing at least twenty people had seen me at my most vulnerable. It was horrifying embarrassing.
“Not her.” I whispered more to myself than him, drinking my drink in a single swallow. I leaned over stressed closing my eyes trying to block out my misdeeds.
We walked silently through the halls and I slowly woke fully up. I was curious why he was already in full death eater robes, but I didn't question it too much and risk angering him.
"Yes, well he loves history doesn't he? The horcruxes are as much vanity objects as they are safeguards for his soul." I said with a smile.
"I've been busy!" I said defensively all the while knowing it was incredibly foolish to not have thought of such a thing before. I was royally fucked if I ended up having the child of a death eater. My studies would go out the window in an instant, not to mention the rumors that would swirl around me for the rest of my life.
"I know you have Severus's darkness. It calls to you. Beckons you. To use his power without fear...I know you want it." He said quietly, his voice barely more than a hiss.
"She's making a potion to fix the headmaster's hand." Potter said, giving me a hard glare for her telling me to back off in his own way. I let my icy glare linger on him, but he was unfazed.
His black eyes darkened and he picked me up getting up and dressing himself quickly making sure to hide his mark first.
"Let me make something perfectly clear. I don't care." He said squeezing my arm even tighter for extra effect I glared at him and Hagrid stepped in between us forcing him to release me.
“Your drunk.” I said with a tremor in my voice, his hands gliding over my hips and pulling my shirt out of my skirt to explore beneath it.
The days seem to meld into one another, each day my anxiety building more than the last one waiting for the Dark Lord to call me to take over the ministry.
“I will see you soon.” She said with a smile that looked worried before she vanished. Just like that. She was gone. I tried to think of her, bring her back, but it was useless. The darkness became overbearing lonely and even the firelight couldn’t light up the space anymore.
“I HAVE been kind. I haven’t insulted her recently.” I retorted annoyed he would assume I’m so stupid. He sighed and rolled his eyes.
"Now we can plan our forever." He said quite happily once I pulled back from the hug. I wiped away my tears.
“What did you do to make him this angry? I swear, I thought he had tortured you to madness.” I said grabbing a vial of the potion I had created myself from his potions cabinet relieved he had it stored here.
“He called me filthy. He deserved it.” I said stubbornly knowing there was no way he was going to get me to apologize for it. He raised an eyebrow, but nodded his head understandingly.
"Yes, so one time Harry and I were fooling around in the room of requirement. We wanted to get lost so told the room that. Well, low and behold there's a room just for lost stuff. Including her diadem. It fell off a shelf during some of our...more physical moments." He said trailing off with a happy smirk at the end, innuendo full in his explanation. I didn't believe he would be so lucky to have just stumbled across something so important, but when we got to the room and he showed me the diadem, it was for sure Ravenna's.
“Obviously. Nevermind that. You need to stop worrying about her daily activities and focus on the bigger picture of getting her to bond with you.” He advised as if I hadn’t already considered this.
"My Lord. It's...it's in my pocket." I breathed weakly. I pulled out the pocket watch showing him it, the silver heirloom falling to the ground, my hands had seemed to lose their grip.
"What's going on in here?" Poppy said rushing back in with Potter just to see Hermione sitting up shakily, dirty from the floor but alive.
“Severus, she is a fun one. How long do we have before Potter shows up to rescue his beloved pet?” He asked stalking around me like a lion on his prey.
“Granger, when did you last eat?” Snape said from somewhere to my right. I took a few deep shaky breaths and my vision came back slowly as well as a pounding headache.
"If he gets control over her…we are done." I said numbly thinking about a manic like him controlling magic itself, able to make her bend it to his will.
She was curled up against me sleeping peacefully, her soft breathing the only sign of life in her. She was clearly exhausted and didn’t stir even when I was moving around. I felt an overwhelming wave of guilt being in such a compromising situation with a student, no matter of age or not. I tried to play it off like I didn’t care about ethics to get her relaxed enough to bond with me, but really I hated myself for crossing that line.
"The Dark Lord wanted to bring you to the last meeting and he said no. You were his. Pretty sure you couldn't be claimed anymore than that." He said haughtily. I stumbled in my steps surprised he had protected me.
I put the necklace on, rubbing the ring gently able to feel his magic enveloped in the metal object. It was the only tangible thing that connected us which made it even more perfect. It was the most thoughtful present I had ever received and when I slept, the warm magic enveloped me keeping my dreams happy ones of him and I.
“I’m pretty sure this is my dream actually.” She said bemused. She looked me up and down. I was wearing a muggle style suit, Italian made with gold cuffs. It wasn’t my style, but she seemed to like it.
Was it possible my mind was changing about fighting for Dumbledore or the Dark Lord because my loyalty had shifted to Severus? It wasn't just logic, but a natural innate desire to protect him at all costs? I wondered if that was why he had lost his temper and transformed when he saw Lucius with me. The bonding clearly didn't work one way. He was completely out of his mind with anger at someone for touching me, but recalled back to me at my slightest wish.
I needed to know more. I was sure there was a spell, something that could protect me from them. Voldemort had used me as a toy, something for amusement, and I hadn’t even fought back. I should have fought back, but I was just too weak. I knew I couldn’t overpower them all.
I got in my room and sighed, truly exhausted from the emotional turmoil of the day. I started to plop down on my bed, but a small box caught my attention. I picked it up and was caught off guard not having expected anything for Christmas since my parents were barely talking to me and Harry and Draco were not exactly the most festive people I had ever met.
"Harry!" I said going to him, but as quickly as the pain came it seemed to vanish and his green eyes were wide with fear.
"I barely talk to him really. I have other things to focus on." I said refusing to play the love sick helpless girl I knew he wanted me to play. He had promised the Dark Lord I would bond with him, but I made no such guarantees.
“Fine. Most of the time.” He agreed. I nodded accepting the second apology hoping he left it at that this time.
"I apologized to Snape and he brushed it off and said you were the only one hurt. I know that's a lie. The seventh year girls have been relentlessly flirting with him now. He positively balks when he sees them and leaves so fast he's almost running." Ginny said, shaking her head. My lips quirked into a tiny smile at the thought of Snape running from a bunch of horn teenagers.
Everyone worked silently and since it was a repeat potion they mostly did a tolerable job. I finally got up part way through the class and did my rounds. Neville had managed a slightly less toxic sludge than usual. Draco's was almost good enough to be sold in my company. Almost. Potter had done good for the first time this year, perhaps even better than Draco. Weasley's was a barely passable mess that might or might not turn the drinker into a troll.
“Why would you do that Severus? Surely you don’t doubt his willingness to torture you?” The Headmaster chided him carefully helping him get on the sofa. I brought back the potion. And sat beside him running a few quick diagnostic spells I had studied up on for this exact sort of thing.
Defense against the dark arts had been canceled for the first part of term since we didn’t have a teacher, but after the parents got desperate enough to not have their students unprotected during a war, they finally agreed to let Lupin back in as our teacher.
"Ah Severus! You have brought our guest." Voldemort said with a hidden drawing everyone's attention to me. Snapes arm was tight around me not letting me shy away from the attention, so I just leaned in closer to him.
"He hates that he doesn't have his own." The retort actually stuck pretty hard. It made sense. He spent all day caring for other people's kids and had. None for himself. It would make anyone bitter.
"You have blood on your shirt still." He said pointedly. I had tried to spell my clothes clean and fix the rip, but I had missed some. Of course he would notice since he could smell even the slightest amount of blood.
“Do you have to be such a bookworm? We need to get you a boyfriend. Or girlfriend if you swing that way.” He said tilting his head observing me obviously never having considered the idea I might be into girls. I chuckled at him bemused.
“Oh no! Why didn’t you tell me? I could have covered your classes.” Minerva said quite worriedly over her owlish glasses. She always seemed to think she was my mother, which was nice at times since mine was trash. Now was not one of those times.
"Get up foolish girl. He was never going to vanquish me. Surely you knew that, right? He is a weak wizard at that. I can spare your life if you don't want to end up like him and overlook your betrayals. For a cost of course." The monster said coldly watching the scene play out without a shred of emotion.
"Oh. Well, then I can help you with that." He said changing directions back down the stairs after I just spent so much energy climbing them.
"Good. Get some sleep. You need it. You too Severus, I'm sure its been a long night for you too." She said with pity that I didn't deserve knowing what typically went on at meetings.
"If you hurt her though, I swear on my fathers grave you will wish you-know-who was the one coming for you." She warned me before sweeping out leaving us alone.
I gently slid from behind her making sure to not wake her and went to change and drink some more of her miracle potion needing to distract myself. I was so sore, but I managed to get a shower and put sweat pants on. I didn’t bother with a shirt since I was just so pained even after the pain potion.
She didn't say a word to me, just gave a gobsmacked Ginny a wink before storming out, her point made.
"How much longer can you keep this up?" Lupin said sitting opposite of me, sidetracked from his original issue. I raised an eyebrow.
“Sana Laxo.” I whispered tapping my wand to the potion pot. The only indicator that I had made any changes was the slight shimmer it seemed to add to the potion. I put out the fire and letting cool before making my sample bottle.
I barged in the Headmasters office without knocking my anger barely reeled in. I paced in front of his desk barely controlling myself processing how this changed everything.
“I will meet you in your office in five.” He said waving the old man away after giving in. Once he left Snape looked at me for a long moment seeming to take in my disheveled appearance without emotion.
"I have a plan to keep both of you alive and safe. You just have to trust me. I know that's a lot to ask. Just know when I give you my word, I won't break it." He said carefully, choosing his words refusing to let me in enough to know what said plan was.
"Whatever you do, don't put it on." Draco warned me firmly, looking at the cursed piece wearily. I smiled and put it on before he could stop me.
She gasped in front of me stepping back shaking her head as if trying to clear her thoughts and bury the memory again.
I didn't go to him or try to make up for the horrid things I said. I had been entirely selfish while he had been absolutely self less thinking only of me.
I wanted nothing to do with anyone for the next week after Snape accused me of practicing the dark arts. I poured myself into my studies and my research for destroying the horcruxes. I couldn't find anything specifically about how to destroy them, but I had some ideas from various books that described other ancient artifacts that had been destroyed. Most normal means wouldn't work, but I did see one that was destroyed by a special kind of fire that wasn't described.
I assumed she was kidding, but she got up to leave with Harry so I didn’t have time to confirm. I just had to hope she was there.
I didn't grade like I usually did, but sat back in my chair drinking the second glass of pain relieving potion. It was so relaxing, but my pain had mostly left. It just relaxed me in a way that whisky never could. She had managed to make the most addictive potion ever and she was clueless.
Controlling magic wasn't about brute force, but rather connecting with the magic and letting it consume you. Something the Dark Lord and even the Headmaster would never be able to master. I smiled at the thought and opened my eyes knowing I was successful before I even looked.
“You can’t kill me! You need me. You know what I bring to you is invaluable. Isn’t that just irony? All this time I thought YOU were in control. Yet here I was…wow. How the tables have turned.” I said with delight at the power I had over him. He stood up towering over me. The crucio curse hit me before I could prepare myself.
"The Headmaster is alive?" I said thickly, my mind finally slowing down enough to grasp what was going on.
"Well, Voldemort has access to Dumbledore through Severus. Yet no one is available to spy on you. Here I am serving his goals and not even asking for recognition. How Death Eater esq of me." He said with a smirk giving himself a bow at his own brilliance.
I didn't even notice him leaving. My chest hurt watching the students filing in, her eyes settling on her. I had missed the signs and been clueless. She was paler than normal and clearly hadn't slept well. She barely talked to Harry and didn't smile. I spent all Christmas with her and had missed such an important detail. I thought she had managed to hold such a great mask at the Dark Lords dinner, but it wasn't a mask after all.
“You look exhausted, get some sleep.” I said rubbing Snape’s hand gingerly. He hummed yawning widely.
“Lucius! I wasn’t expecting you.” He said with a hint of annoyance that seemed highly restrained. He spun around and walked over to Lucius as if I didn’t exist, still too tired to stand up on his floor. Malfoy Sr. didn’t seem to notice me and smiled at Snape pouring himself a whisky.
"Any idea what he has planned besides annoy Harry? It was weird. When they kidnapped me it was made to look spontaneous, but I think it was actually staged. I feel like the plan went much deeper than just annoy Harry. I just can't figure out what." I said lost as to what Voldemort's next steps could be.
Spelling your blood to boil yet you were unable to die so you were subjected to the pain continuously, removing teeth through the top of the head was another one. A particularly disturbing spell would enable the witch or wizard to only be able to procreate with beings of a different species and would create an insatiable desire to do so until the women conceived. That was how werewolfs and vampires started. They were both originally entirely feral creatures until bred with humans giving both enough in common with witches and wizards to make their bites transfer some of the DNA and for it to stick.
"Will you forgive me? I miss my best friend." She begged me, grabbing my hand for emphasis, giving me a puppy dog pout. I smiled, sighing and closed the book.
I felt a sharp stab of pain realizing he had betrayed me. I wanted to get away from him, as far away as humanly possible. I turned to leave, but he grabbed my arm and pulled me back to him easily.
"Except you." The faith he put in me was astounding. I did so many horrific deeds and dappled in the dark arts constantly. I didn't think doing it, but then trying to bring it down really quantified as not indulging. I got my fix as much as I wanted and maybe more. One of the reasons I wasn't sure I even wanted to survive the war was the withdrawal of not having that dark power at my disposal. Controlling people, punishing them…destroying them. It was a dangerous addiction I didn't know if I could overcome.
"I haven't ever seen a pregnant house elf before." I commented, surprised that I had missed such a thing.
"When I was brought back I lost my charming good looks, something I'm sure you can attest to with having worn the diadem." He mused darkly.
“I wont do what he requested with you. I can’t give details. It’s not your fault. It’s mine. I can’t always please both masters.” He said with a shrug drinking some more. I had never seen him so relaxed and casual. He always held himself up with such a regal manner seeing him calm and at ease was bizarre.
I wanted to argue that a monarchy was a bad idea and would silence the voices of those under its rule, but a monarchy carefully chosen to be honorable and charitable could actually help the discrimination that minorities felt. Many monarchy’s focused most of their power on civil rights violations and equitability for all citizens. They had no political stake in trying to appease the majority to win an election. They could appeal to the smaller groups as well and help create a voice where there wasn’t one.
“What are you doing?” I turned around to see Granger standing there looking around confused as if trying to get her bearings. There was only the fireplace, so it was a pointless cause.
"I didn't know you could cook." I said walking over nervously to see what he had made. Eggs and sausage were already done, he was just flipping some perfectly made French toast over. He looked at me skeptically with a raised eyebrow.
"Severus, you know not every case is easy to pursue, we do the best with the resources given." The judge said shifting uncomfortably in his chair, his old age showing. Severus raised an eyebrow to this.
"Oh he's been positively horrible to you, hasn't he. I'm so sorry." She said groaning a bit. I debated if I should say anything, but then decided it didn't really matter at this point. The whole school thought I was a hoe anyways.
I had only ever felt Snape's magic before, which was dark but pulled my magic in a strange but strong way. He seemed repulsed by me, or perhaps scared of me.
After what felt like forever his onslaught stopped, his attention turning to a commotion at the doors.
I just tossed it under the bed happy to not have the cursed thing calling to me continuously and went to sleep, dreaming of a future without Voldemort.
I was in a black box of nothingness totally separate from the world and pain around me. A fireplace appeared slowly in the center of the room and I felt heat. I had always loved fireplaces, ever since I was a kid. My parents fought all the time so I would sneak to my friends house and would roast marshmallows in their fireplace. The sound of the crackle from it lulled me into a peaceful state and I stared in it just watching it flare and flicker for an undetermined amount of time.
"Let's go raid the kitchens. This popcorn isn't nearly enough for a growing baby. You need some real food." Ginny joked rubbing my stomach playfully. I sighed, but smiled waving my hand, sending all my books back to their shelves, feeling my mood pick up since I had my best friend back.
"He made me dinner on the astronomy tower, one of my favorites actually. It was just divine." I said a bit sadly. Her mouth dropped from shock.
"Shouldn't you be trying to get me to your side?" I said with a bit of a laugh. He smirked and tilted his head a bit taking me in.
"Volde..the Dark Lord's house?" I asked unsure since he hadn't specified. She looked at me like I was the insane one of the two of us.
“Miss Granger! What is the meaning of this?” Professor McGonagall asked having caught sight of the drama and rushing to Ron’s defense. She glared at me accusingly when I was silent.
"You use the potion yourself. That's why you look so young! You don't look a day past twenty-five." I announced with a giggle. He gave me a curt nod.
"I am a potions master. I'm fairly sure that qualifies me automatically as a good cook." I could have smacked myself in the head for my stupidity. Of course he could cook, it was all the same following directions. He picked me up easily and set me on the counter immediately feeling me a bite of eggs that were still piping hot. They were so fluffy and light it was heavenly.
I expected him to be beside me when I woke up, but I was alone in the large bed. I took the chance to look around his rooms wondering how I could have missed it being his. It was exactly reminiscent of his Hogwarts rooms. They were warm and inviting in the best of ways. Opposite of the bed was large bookshelves filled with books that had to be hundreds of years old.
"Well, I suppose we best go check on her then. She should be eating breakfast right about now and I'm sure she will be quite upset." He said with a clap getting up happily leaving quite abruptly to go check on her. I followed realizing as we walked that his plans were far more thought out than I realized.
“Strange though. They generally only like other magical creatures. They hate regular witches and wizards. Isn’t that something.” Hagrid said taking the bird back and cooing at it before putting it away.
That bothered me more than anything. He was right. The very future of magic depended on us preserving the magical lines.
They took us silently to a large round room we had never been in, the ranks of death eaters closed in around us pushing us forward to the Dark Lord, who sat in a make-shift throne in the center of the room.
“Of course you do! You realize you are far surpassed most of the teachers here right? Myself included. Your not a student in anything more than the Headmasters need for a babysitter.” He said pouring himself some whisky and myself some wine. I never drank even though I knew technically I was of age, but took the glass anyways.
If my suspicions were correct Dumbledore knew as much and there were more. Including one that had killed his hand.
“Well of course old man. Who else? I’m supposed to be making her bond with me, and she’s over there kissing Weasley! Its unfathomable what she sees in that redheaded, stubborn, self-centered fool. Don’t get me wrong. I know I’m not personable. I’m good looking though and she was eating out of the palm of my hands. She was so into it…then she goes around and kisses him! I swear she did it just to make me angry.” I ranted until I felt the anger starting to lessen up and I plopped down in the chair opposite of the headmaster.
“Its my fault. I should have found a way out. I thought she was underage though and you know the Dark Lord takes a hard pass until they are of age. I didn’t know she used a time turner.” I said wondering how I could have miscalculated so badly. The headmaster sighed and brought me some whisky and a glass knowing what I needed on a night like tonight.
“Look, can we talk. Privately?” He asked. I debated refusing him. He was very persistent and annoying though so after a moment I sighed and waved my hand putting up a muffalito charm.
It called to me, like a siren, beckoning me to put it on. I had always thought I was the strongest person I knew, but the dark magic I held onto from Snape was far more mischievous and I felt a smile come over my face that wasn't entirely my own.
“I think you need to woo her Severus. You’re a ladies man, I hear about a new girl every week for you. You don’t do commitment.” He said matter of factly.
"Minnie is not exhausted. Minnie is tired of doing nothing all day. Minnie wanted to see Mister's friend which Minnie cannot do from bed." She said, giving me a smile quite happy with me, but giving Severus a glare. He returned the glare evenly.
“True. Severus, your up.” He announced directing Snape to me like a prize up for the winning. I tried to scream out, but my voice was gone somehow even though I hadn’t screamed. Voldemort chuckled at me suddenly finding energy to protest.
“Yes, that’s how we know who’s a good an bad witch or wizard. We feels their magic!” He announced happily. I had never considered they had any special powers since most books only spoke of their serving of humans. It made sense though, since how would humans mistreat them and the elves continue to serve them? There had to be a magical bond there.
"You're more like him than you realize." Severus said, evenly taking a long drink of his wine. It was my turn to be surprised.
The statement hung in the air thickly. It was impossible. She wouldn't study the dark arts let alone perform them on a teacher. She wasn't that stupid, was she?
"I didn't want Granger to ask about it. Some things are too personal for me to share my Lord." I explained changing a glance up at him. He was calmer for sure, and I thought I might have noticed a hint of regret. I was quickly feeling dizzy and I tried to raise my wand to heal myself, but the Dark Lord himself started the healing charm, quietly and thoughtfully.
I knew we didn't have much time together, but it didn't matter, I just wanted to savor what time we did have and foster the connection I felt. I knew the moment we went back to Hogwarts though we would have to act like we barely knew each other again, the distance difficult when I had to be so close to him.
"I SAID NO KILLING CURSES, WE NEED THE GIRL ALIVE." The Dark Lord screamed at one of his followers who sent a killing curse at Lupin. He thankfully was able to dodge it, but it came within feet of me.
“Severus. I have to find you. I have to go.” She said getting on her tippy toes and pulling me down to kiss my cheek.
"Yes." The confession lingered in the room, the shock quite tangible in every death eater, including Snape. I was better at this than I thought, I thought wryly to myself.
I felt guilty realizing I had thought the worst of him when he had given me such blind trust with drinking my potion. I went back to my seat quietly waiting for everyone else to finish mulling over this in my head.
“Kill me for failing your plans, but don’t touch her. If you kill me, you are promising me that.” The magic I knew would protect her. A life for a life. It was what had protected Harry when his mother gave her life. It was ancient and dark magic, but it was what I needed to save her.
"Turns out I was a Horcrux or something. Basically I had a piece of Voldemort's soul. Quite disgusting if you ask me. So he just killed his own soul. Quite ironic if you ask me." He said with a grin. I had never anticipated such a thing could be possible.
"If I didn't care for you, you would not have any clothes left and I would be deep in you making you scream in pleasure." He said, his dark eyes grazing over me in a way that suggested he was ready to do exactly that.
"So do you have anything to say for yourself? You should be ashamed! I can't believe you would have an affair with a student!" Minerva said harshly, drawing my attention back into the world of the living.
I could sense bitterness in her response, though it didn't seem to be for me. I had to assume it was for Ginny based on her attitude towards her earlier.
"How did you afford this house anyways?" I asked curious how he managed to afford such a thing. He glanced up at the large manor and shrugged nonchalantly.
“You have failed clearly Longbottom. Leave class and study more so maybe there will be one class you don’t fail this year.” Snape said with a sneer waving his hand evaporating the potion and smoke instantly.
“Let me start, I’m sorry for how much of a douche I’ve been. I don’t care about purity, I was just angry. I know you didn’t want that to happen. So…can we be friends still?” He said interrupting me, but actually apologizing, though how sincere it was, was questionable.
"Oh. I almost forgot the bribe. Don't worry. The bank will transfer a hundred thousand gallons to your account before the end of the night. How foolish of me to forget." He said with a mock bow walking past the aurors pushing their wands aside uselessly.
"Is that what this is? You're going to kiss him because I won't kiss you?" He said angrily, his hand going across my face in a split second. The feeling of his hand across my face stung sharply and I gasped in surprise.
"Yes, well we can't all marry rich." I said feeling slightly guilty about the ring around my neck. I didn't want to divulge the scandalous relationship to her just yet.
"Hermione, why are you out at this time of night, surely you know what lurks in the darkness." Hagrid said good naturedly following us up to the castle.
I felt the hair on my skin standing on end almost feeling a change I couldn't quite place a name too. I glanced around several times thinking I was being followed, but no one was there.
“That’s it exactly.” I admitted just to annoy him even more. He paced towards me backing me up to the walls, his eyes flashing dangerously.
"I guess I just want to make sure I keep up on my studies so I can get a good job after school." I said vaguely not really knowing what to say. She scoffed at this.
I hadn't seen Snape all day, maybe he had gotten out of having to bring me. I wouldn't know and didn't really care. I went outside by the lake and sat in the snow after casting a warming spell on myself so I wouldn't freeze to death.
I sobbed hard holding him tightly, my pain as much from losing him as it was from the lies I was fed from the person I loved the most.
"I'm just saying, you put the diadem on remarkably fast. It was kind of scary how little control you had." He said worriedly glancing over at me with more than a hint of suspicion. I didn't want to explain I was sure I wasn't evil, it was just Snape's magic controlling me, but I didn't think that would go over well, so I just kept quiet and let the subject go.
"A split second. Why? What did you see?" He asked curiously, but also worried. I backed away from the diadem that still called out to me. Beckoned me to put it on again. Wear it. Become a beautiful powerful queen like only it could make me.
My mind wandered during my classes and I barely managed to take decent notes on the topics we covered. Even defense against the dark arts struggled to keep my attention. It wasn't like we were learning anything useful anyways, should learning how to destroy dark objects be somewhere in our syllabus? No. It was nowhere to be found.
"You knew…didn't you. About Granger." I hissed knowing there was no way such a big detail would get by him. He sighed quite used to my temper.
I didn't have a chance to react when she tipped the glass back quickly drinking it with a smile. Potter's jaw dropped open and he snatched the bottle from her before she could drink more. Her hair color left starting at the roots and going all the way down to its tips in one soft swoosh.
"I thought you would never wake up." He said cooking what looked like French toast skillfully. The smell was delicious and made me realize I was absolutely starving.
I sighed closing the book on Horcruxs exhausted and my mind overwhelmed. It was a lot to consider after a long sleepless night and I knew Snape would be up shortly.
"How valiant of him. Except you can't win a war alone Granger. He was a fool." The Dark Lord hissed, raising his own wand ready to hit me with a curse at a moment's notice.
"STOP." The Dark Lord yelled at last ending the onslaught. He parted his ranks stepping forward seeing Harry and I in the circle.
"Oh no Hermione. You're in my house." He unzipped my dress and I realized where we were. In his bedroom. He really had every intention of doing this.
“Shit.” I heard Snape mutter and for a brief second he looked scared before his bastard mask was back in place perfectly.
“I hope so.” I said breathing a deep sigh feeling my tension leaving. I got up and went over to his table of knick knacks absent-mindedly the lecture over.
I slammed my fist into his face as hard as I could feeling a satisfying crack under my fist I was fairly sure I broke. He screamed like a girl and grabbed his nose that started bleeding profusely.
I woke up panicked. The dream had been so vivid, so realistic it seemed like I had actually been there. My heart was racing and I knew something was wrong. It was hard to explain, but I was confident that something had happened to Snape.
“I’m not his toy. I was doing detention.” I snapped annoyed at his vulgarity. He smiled and looked me up and down vulgarly, his blond hair shorter than before. If he wasn’t a death eater and horrible human being I might have been flattered
"The death eaters had dinner, then I just hung around. I can't really say too much." I said pointedly nodding to the students chattering away not too far from us. Harry raised an eyebrow questioningly.
I shouldn’t be so tempted by his offer to show me the dark. I needed a therapist, I was sure of it. And a nice light, not death eater boyfriend to distract me. ASAP.
He threw me down at the feet of the Dark Lord, the room filled with a ring of death eaters all wearing masks and waiting with anticipation.
She had been pointedly ignoring me again and had skipped our next meeting apparently trying to keep her distance. I knew her magic would try to keep pulling her closer and closer to me. I had her within fingers grasp and I was terrified of loosing her.
“Well, well. Look what we have here! Severus, you have yourself a little toy and you didn’t even offer to share?” Lucius said stalking around Snape and to me eagerly taking in my disheveled appearing and assuming the worst. I glared at him and struggled back to my feet refusing to let him tower over me. I was just over five foot so he was unfortunately still towering over me, but I felt better at least.
“We ya see, I have this old friend I went to see. He was quite ready to be rid of it to be truthful.” Hagrid explained poking his finger into the birds cage fondly letting it nibble on his finger.
"I have two masters Hermione. What do you think the chance of me getting out of this alive are? My goal has always been to get Potter to the end scene alive. Knowing I would die. I didn't want to be attached to anything that would make me want to stay alive. It would only make accepting my death harder." He explained getting quieter as he walked closer to me. I felt my breath hitch realizing he was right. He was going to die. Yet another person I had become attached to that wouldn't make it to see the end of this war.
I sat down in the chair lost in thought, just absorbed with watching the trusting way she looked at me.
He led me through the massive gardens with the bushes and trees covered in snow. I could imagine it was beautiful on a summer day.
“Levimus.” I said again more instantly. He jerked up and down fast, but the result was nothing like Snape’s.
"We don't come for a fight. We want only Potter and Granger. If you give us them, we will spare your pitiful lives." The death eater said harshly. It was Antonin. Harry and I looked at each other frightened, but ready.
"Please Severus, I'm sorry, it was like she was drawing me in! I couldn't control myself. Please don't kill me!" Lucius begged quite comically. I gasped in shock and stood up shakily.
“Okay. Good. You’ll have to help me pick out something to wear of course. I’m tired of wearing the same uniform everyday.” She said going through her clothes trying to find something that would look good without being slutty.
"Oh yes, I can feel him on you. My most trusted servant Severus. Bonded to an empath? I am truly the greatest that ever lived. With you at my disposal..." He trailed off watching me with admiration and pride.
I screamed and tried to kick him so Yaxley and Igor stepped on my feet holding them down quite painfully.
“Out of my way!” I yelled at a group of annoying third years who were hanging out in the hallways like this was the kid zone. I managed to make it to the headmasters office in record time and slammed open his door seething still. Blaise was in the headmasters chair and jumped up at being intruded on.
"Normally they aren't well fed neighbors for it to show." He said with a shake of his head. The sun was starting to set and it was getting colder fast. I started shivering so he immediately pulled me to him to warm me up. The protective way his arms wrapped around me lulled me into a false sense of security, so when I saw some people approaching his wrought iron gates, I was a bit surprised.
“Wonderful. As if Potter didn’t do enough to try to get me killed already. Fucking idiot.” He muttered his sour mood returning thinking of the danger their relationship put him in. I couldn’t deny he was right. One whispered to Voldemort and Draco would be dragged down to be killed, or worse, used as a pawn to kill Harry.
"Absolutely not. They have nothing. This picture shows me touching her chin. That's it." I said shaking my head.
“Out. Now. You can finish your whining about  failing another class tomorrow I have business with the headmaster.” I snapped angrily shoving him out of the room and slamming the door in his face.
"It would make sense. I don't know of very many empath's that didn't turn evil though. I don't think its something you should exactly hope for. My father told me some stories about a few growing up. Nasty endings to all of the tales." He explained slowly considering the ramifications of if it were true.
“Self defense.” I said uncomfortably. I wanted to yell at him YOU. I didn’t think that would go over well though. I didn’t need to verbalize it though, he seemed to understand even though I hadn’t said it and his anger eased up heavily.
"The Dark Lord wants to do a hostile takeover. In just a matter of a few weeks. You will be his shiny trophy helping him do exactly that. He wants to place himself as the new ruler, whereas the Headmaster wants to be the new ruler. The ensuing battle will determine the future of our very society." He explained calmly, but his eyes held more worry than I had ever seen before. My breath hitched a bit realizing how serious that would be.
“Clearly.” He waved his hand and in seconds my potion in the cauldron was in glass bottles and stacked quite nicely on one of the shelves with its own label.
"What is this? Sterling silver melts with the incendio spell. Someone must have placed some sort of protections on it." Draco said annoyed. I hadn't thought of how to destroy it, just that I needed to get it.
A giant black panther was on Lucius who was screaming like a little girl. Yaxley and Igor had ran off nowhere to be seen clearly not wanting to deal with the massive beast.
You better hold your chin up. Every man in this room wishes they could have you and every women wishes they were you.
“What are you doing down here?” He seemed surprised to see me, but when I got down I noticed he was not alone. Lavender was at his feet reading a story to him from her gossip column.
Professor McGonagall looked at me quizzically, but stopped seeming to understand I couldn't go without doing this.
"You see it too now. Albus tries to hide the reality behind a veil of happiness. What he really wants is control. Power. Just like me. This isn't a battle of right or wrong. Its been a power play all along. He wants to replace the ministry entirely with a group of his chosen leaders. He doesn't care about magic, or equality. He cares about power. He always has." He said closing the distance between us. He reached out to touch me and I flinched back expecting him to hurt me, but he didn't. He just put his hand on my shoulder in a trusting way that I wasn't expecting.
“What did I say about putting your head down Granger?” He asked quietly watching me with an unreadable expression.
“Mine is done.” Draco announced proudly, his potion looking quite competent and the first one finished.
“Don’t miss another class Granger.” He warned me darkly before sweeping away. Just as he was leaving the door opened and Harry came in. It was well past curfew, but Snape said nothing, the silent agreement being you keep my secrets and I keep yours.
"Everyone out!" Draco shouted, startling me out of my reverie with a sharp jolt. I was to her side in an instant the panic hitting me full force. She wasn't breathing, her eyes were closed as if dead and she was limp when I lifted her up a bit.
“Would you preferred I let Lucius do the honors? Granger, I don’t know what you wanted me to do.” He said his anger seeming to die down a bit after a moment. I could see his own tension at the memory come through his mask that was heavily thinned by the alcohol.
“Look, I have far more pressing things on my mind. If this is all you have, I’m leaving.” I said standing up and walking out.
"You really don't remember?" I asked sure she was kidding me. She shook her head befuddled, her eyes wide and a slight bit terrified.
"Do you think they fired him?" Ron asked pointing to the empty seat at the head table, his mouth full of food like the hyena he was.
"You can't be alive. I watched you die." I said sure of what I saw. He sat down cool and relaxed, also going through the gifts for something to eat. He grabbed some caramel popcorn.
"He...he made you dinner?...but why?...wait...were the rumors true? I thought I just picked up on a cute bonding moment but I kind of wondered..." She trailed off excitedly.
"Yes. It's odd. Only one has been destroyed, and I know Dumbledore did it. Yet the other one was simply moved. Perhaps to use." He said, his thoughtfulness giving way to a happy smirk.
"It's not me that you desire, is it? Tell me one good reason you should deny yourself your desires Hermione." His voice was soft yet kind. Accepting. Enticing. I found my thoughts running much slower than normal.
“Not yet, but I should have something soon. I was actually in the middle of something Lucius.” Snape said tersely drinking his whiskey quickly from what I could see. Lucius seemed to finally notice me slumped against the cauldron still gathering myself from almost passing out. His excitement was almost tangible seeing me.
“I’m right, aren’t I? He wasn’t just taking me to annoy Harry, there’s more at play here.” I said feeling my anxiety increase and my heart racing at the thought of being kidnapped again.
She knew the deep dark parts of my past and my soul and still accepted me. Just like that. I had anticipated horror on her part and quite a lot for anger. Instead it was almost like...like she was proud of being with me?
“Well, just do that!” Harry announced triumphantly. As we went up the last flight of stairs to our dormitories.
"Ah, Tom. We meet again. I wish it was under better circumstances of course, but it seems like you have something of mine." The Headmaster said calmly coming in flowing purple and silver robes looking quite dramatic in the seas of blackness from the death eaters.
“Always! Look at you! Your eyes are all puffy and you look downright exhausted! You need sleep. I have some rose water that should help.” She said grabbing my hand and dragging me away excitedly. Harry refused to rescue me and yawned waving me off and plopping on the red couches ready to sleep.
"Of course it's worth it! Why won't you fight back Hermione? Did you want it or something?" He asked giving me a disgusted look. The air thickened around me and in a split second Ron was thrust back out of his chair, spilling over in a messy heap on the floor.
"I want to trust you, but you're literally the most fucked up person I know. You tell Voldemort you're on his side to appease him, you say the same thing to Dumbledore, two of the most intelligent, bright people I know. Honestly I don't think your loyal to either of them." I said wanting to trust him, but not quite there. He seemed surprised. Clearly he wasn't used to being called out for his trickery.
"Granger, get down here. Did you forget you're a witch?" He asked with a sigh grabbing me by the waist without asking and setting me down on the floor like a toy.
"I'm just saying…that was a bit…hot. The way he looked at you. I swear he would have taken off your clothes if not for us. Your welcome." Harry said with a laugh grabbing a chocolate milk to drink.
“Everyone is capable of running a marathon everyday, that doesn’t mean they will do it. People go to for the easiest way out usually, which in this case is nice predictable spells they learn as kids. Also saying words is not enough. You have to direct the magic.” He explained twirling his wand in his hand calmly observing me.
The number of times I had watched Severus drink it after meetings, just casually knocking it back dwelling in its pain relieving properties shot to the forefront of my mind.
“You have lost weight.” He said simply. That got my attention. I looked out of the massive cauldron surprised. No one had noticed.
His words came into my mind soothing me and reassuring in an unexpected way. I looked over at him, but he was engaged in a light conversation with the tall dark auror about some Quidditch team, the complete epitome of relaxation.
Harry nudged me pointing to the side of the room and I gasped seeing the bodies of the previous administration lying piled together lifeless.
"I am a controlled person, but surely you realize how difficult it is for me to restrain myself when you do this Hermione." He warned me darkly, his eyes glazing over my body, his desire apparent.
"Thanks Sev. I'm sure it's just her curiosity getting the best of her." He said a bit lighter trying to convince himself as much as me.
"Doing what exactly?" I asked firmly, trying to not let myself feel anything for her. I needed to stay distant, cold. I managed it with everyone else, why couldn't I manage it with her.
I was quiet while he drug me across the grounds to the apparition point and took me to the familiar Malfoy manor.
“If this is what he does to his supporters, imagine what he does to people he hates.” I said sure they hadn’t grasped the reality of what they were suggesting.
If I wasn’t in a room full of people I was sure he would have killed me for my insolence. I didn’t have to look at his fiery expression long because he swept away angrily, his cloaks billowing behind him.
“Yes actually. Is that such a bad thing?” He asked leaning forward and brushing my hair out of my face tenderly tucking it behind my ear. It was so unexpected I felt my breath hitch and my heart race.
"Fine." I said unlocking the classroom and letting him come in. I grabbed some pain reliever and a blood replenishing potion and sat behind my desk sourly.
"I love you." He said breaking the kiss and whispering the words as he kissed down my stomach, each kiss lighting up a new part of my body.
“It’s just taking your magic. I can’t seem to call mine back.” He said frustrated. I grinned quite pleased with that.
"She is in shock it seems. Very peculiar. I don't see any physical damage except to her face, some sort of bruising." She mumbled more to herself than me bustling around running more spells and casting spells on her to help fix her damage from the cold.
"Oh? Only you can look at me like that then?" I questioned him, folding my arms defiantly. I didn't like being told to change so someone else wouldn't look at me, it was entirely unfair.
"Is that what you're doing?" I asked innocently. He growled annoyed and grabbed me by my arm dragging me out.
"If not you, then who? The old man is much too busy to be bothering with a diadem." The Dark Lord mused pacing a bit, which was usually what I did.
"You are the only person I know that organizes their trunk. Just really! Your socks are actually matched! What kind of voodoo is that?" She asked jokingly, distracted from her original intention and just going through my things now.
"Look, I'm really sorry for everything with Professor Snape. I took a picture and I showed it to Ron, who gave it to Blaise, who gave it to Colin who said something to some journalist he was bugging at Hogsmeade." She explained, clearly torn up by her unintentional betrayal.
“Your detention starts immediately after class so don’t bother leaving.” He said without any room for argument. I smirked trying to hide how tired I was and not wanting to give him the satisfaction of getting to me.
The moment the magic flowed through my hands I felt it in a rush. The energy was dark, yet so enticing. I could feel it bending to change the mouse to a floating state responding to the command before flowing back through the wand and to me. It was heavier than I would’ve anticipated and it felt more playful also. Dark yet playful.
"The Dark Lord will not accept the excuse 'I am busy Granger'." He whispered quietly, his black eyes lighting up with a fire I had become well accustomed to.
"You are mine and mine only Hermione. Do you understand?" He asked before pushing me back on the bed roughly getting on top of me in one swift motion.
“What Miss. Granger? All talk and confidence, yet scared of me? Its almost like you like playing with fire more than you will admit.” He said darkly, the lack of space between him and I taking my oxygen away. His hand went to my face and I flinched back expecting him to hit me, but he gently ran his fingers down my cheek instead. I closed my eyes instinctively and let the sensation wash over me.
“She was due back in about half an hour. Knowing him you have an hour maximum.” Snape explained casually. I could only see the lower half of his face with the mask on and his eyes and it gave nothing away. He didn’t seem to be taking pleasure in watching me suffer, but he didn’t seem to be bothered either.
I wore a simple black dress that was thick and lined with wool. The white pearl buttons gave it a classic feel, the soft material hugging my curves quite nicely without being provocative. I didn't want to risk Lucius coming after me again.
"That was interesting. I could feel the heat between you two. Things aren't settled at all clearly." Harry said grabbing an apple and biting into it eagerly.
"I have no idea what you mean." I said honestly watching him hating myself for actually being curious. He laughed maniacally, his humor as fake as his body.
By dinner time I was eating my Yorkshire pudding in peace happily ignoring her existence and drinking down the whisky in my goblet feeling the stress of the week leaving.
“Take the edge off.” He said before pouring himself his own nightcap. I drank it slowly letting the warmth ease my aching muscles.
"Meeting, she got quite cold." I said not wanting to go into details. The shame of my outburst weighed heavily on me and I would much rather blame the Dark Lord than myself.
"No. I'm coming with." I said stubbornly. The aurors gave each other a surprised look, but then shrugged.
My mind flashed back to my childhood and I felt shame realizing I had become everything I hated, everything I resented.
Its not like the headmaster could fire me, this was just a job I took to appease the Dark Lord to keep eyes on Albus. All my real money was in actually selling the potions I brewed in my off time. I made more money than I could ever hope to spend from that and the best thing was I didn’t have to deal with stupid, idiotic staff meetings. If I did it full time I would be in seven figure income easily. I was one of the only potion masters left and yet demand was never better for a high quality product.
“I just wanted to make sure you didn’t have dibs on him or something. I know last year both Ron and him tried their chances with you. And I know you told them no but…”
"Not money. Love. I dare say, it's a price I'm willing to pay though." He said smiling a bit and I realized he was playing with me.
"Surely you know what you are, don't you?" He said after a moment, his expression becoming serious as he gazed at our reflection in the mirror.
“Let’s go.” He was devoid of all emotion grabbing me by my arm and shoved me on the fire throwing the floo powder in. He didn’t send me to Malfoy manor since it was blocked off so even once we got into the little shack he sent me to he, we had to walk to Malfoy’s house.
We walked in the snow together slowly towards the evening, the cold nothing compared to the warmth being with him brought me.
He looked up when there was just one other student in the room coming out of his grading trance and sighed annoyed they were taking so long. His eyes met mine and I bit my lip again feeling anxious.
“I know.” I said watching her interact with Ron, who she seemed to have fixed things with. She seemed slightly less happy around him, but her smile was still there. She glanced up at the head table and saw me watching her.
I didn't know what to say to that, but a split second later he drew back suddenly and opened the gate for me, his expression annoyed.
I expected Hogsmeade to cheer me up and pull me out of the bad mood I had been in lately. I found myself just wandering aimlessly while the happy couples and groups of friends enjoyed themselves laughing and smiling together.
"Miss. Granger, I needed to make sure you weren't practicing the dark arts." I said making sure not to use her first name and anger her more. She huffed. astonished I would be so bold.
"You won't be able to bring down Dumbledore without me. He won't let you stay in power. So kill me then." I hissed. My eyes meeting his without a trace of fear. He was surprised.
I ate my cereal in peace after he left and went to go change my robes before I had to get to class. When I got in the common room Harry was already waiting with Ron looking very worried.
“A magical bonding takes time. Little jumps. A baby elf bonds with their master in a year. If baby is taken from Master, he doesn’t bond fully. He is a bad elf.” He said offering me a puff pastry filled with some sort of cream.
The box was small, but looked expensive. I opened it carefully hoping it wasn't from the Dark Lord and I would die in a few seconds. Luckily for me it contained a beautiful white gold ring on a simple thin chain. It was stunning, but unexpected. When I pulled it out of the box a note was charmed to appear and I picked it up recognizing the familiar scrawl instantly.
It could have been ten minutes, or an hour, I wasn’t sure, but when their onslaught finally ended I didn’t even feel relief. My brain was fuzzy and I was having trouble remembering where I was.
“Great. Who’s next? If I can’t kill the Potter brat, the least I can do is destroy his toy.” He said with a chuckle of happiness. I had never seen him in person, but the aura of insanity oozed off of him in waves. I bit my lip and tried to right myself, but the next curse hit with an almost silent incantation and I was back shaking under the pain biting my lip so hard I drew blood just trying to keep quiet.
“Levimus.” Snape said firmly. When doing spellwork I had only ever relied on technicality to do my spells. Do xyz while doing this motion and your spell worked every time. I never really felt the magic or recognized its existence.
"It's a girl." He said, glancing to my stomach pointedly. My mouth dropped open. I had only been trying to get him to hold on so I could save him. I never thought I was ACTUALLY pregnant.
Of course he would keep it close to him, he would want extra assurance that he knew where the horcruxes were, especially if he thought I was trying to find them. I had to hide my smile, the meeting not a total waste of time after all.
He looked at me darkly observing my reaction before drinking more as if daring me to confess what I did. He was literally insane.
“I just didn’t get to appreciate your good looks last time.” She said with just a hint of playfulness. I wanted to be angry and beat it into her not to touch the books. Terrify her and leave her traumatized if that’s what it took.
Getting back into Hogwarts my mood was sour and I still had my last class to teach and Hermione to train, which was going horribly. I was starting to doubt she was a witch let alone an empath. She couldn't direct the magic to even the slightest change I tried to get her to do. There was no way she would be trained before my time would run out with the Dark Lord.
“Look. I’m sorry about the things I said. I was jealous. Lavender said I can be a jerk sometimes.” He said finally. I let out a snort of amusement.
"It's okay Hermione. Save yourself. I'm an old man and lived my life already." The Headmaster said gently without judgement. It was the first time I had ever truly seen him for what he was.
“Obviously not. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t...I guess I forget you probably had other people you would rather do that to anyways.” I said with a depressed sigh deflating refusing to meet his eyes shamefully. He was just as much of an unwilling participant in Voldemort’s plans as I was. I couldn’t judge him too harshly.
“You want more?” He asked me breaking the kiss, out of breath himself. I started unbuttoned his shirt my intentions made clear. He was my professor, but here he wasn’t. He was just another person and quite an attractive one at that.
When she went back to bed, silence overtook the room and I didn't know what to say, but I knew I needed to say something.
I was a nervous wrecking taking it to Snape and I had to take a deep breath before handing him the glass bottle. I knew he would hate it.  He was going publicly humiliate me, I was sure of it. He glanced up from his grading finally noticing me lingering and took the bottle. Without even checking to make sure it was decent, he opened the stopper and swallowed a large gulp. My hand shot to my mouth in shock.
"Well, not all of us can be as disorganized as you." I said playfully brushing out my hair. Since I had started to use hair straightening potion in my hair, it looked so much nicer. It still fell in curls around my face, but manageable loose curls.
“You’ve brought me a gift?” Voldemort hissed sitting in what had to be described as a throne in the middle of a hall at Malfoy Manor. My breath came in ragged and my exhaustion was going to be a severe hindrance in my fight with them, I was sure of it. I looked up at his snake like face and gasped in horror seeing myself surrounded by the hooded figures. That’s why they were coming here, they were already coming anyways for some sort of meeting.
"I'm pretty tired. I need to go to bed, Good night you guys!" I said with a fake smile kicking myself internally for acting so damn suspicious. Severus was over here faking an entire personality and I couldn't even get a shred of information past two very oblivious people.
I didn't want to open my eyes and face life without the warmth of his dark magic swirling with mine, surrounding and caressing mine as he had for months now.
"Am I not unstoppable if I stay light?" She asked me, tilting her head a bit confused and hurt by my logic. She was entirely right. She pulled herself from my arms and turned to leave stopping realizing we had been watched.
"I don't suppose you're going to let me in on what this master plan is, are you?" I asked annoyed, but calming down a bit. The fact he hated Harry and was still making sure to protect him eased some of my anger at being manipulated.
I didn't try to do an incantation like I normally did with my practices with Snape, but just let the feeling control the direction the magic was going. My magic seemed elated and swirled through my fingers and into him taking on the challenge I gave it with a pent up excitement. It was so natural and all this time I had been trying SO HARD to change the magic. I didn't realize I just had to relax and let it flow, directing it to my whim.
"She's drawn to you and hates herself for it. The headmasters pet bonding with a death eater? Oh that's scandalous for sure. But the other night, she melted right into your hand. Every inch of her wants to bond with you, you guys are both just fighting it." He said tapping his wand slowly on the throne as if considering what to do with me next. I swallowed thickly hoping he wouldn't just outright kill me. I would never have willingly allowed her to bond with me and betray him. It put us both in peril.
The only time I had ever felt anything similar was when the dementors had come on the train. Everyone in the room looked around at each other confused and I realized then that they felt it too.
I was in the hallway with her and my hand was raised, the anger of her actions fueling my anger in an indescribable way.
I entered the common rooms eager to get out of the halls and saw everyone gathered around, faces ashen. Professor McGonagall was standing near the fire mid sentence and she stopped seeing me.
"I can talk to her. In my mind. At first I thought it was legimancy related, but then I realized I don't have to look in her eyes to do it." I said quietly wondering why I hadn't thought more of it.
I was an idiot for having told him I didn't trust him, but it was the truth. Was it so insane that I loved someone that I knew would turn me over to my death at a moment's notice? Probably. Sadly the pain that flowed through every inch of my body watching him walk away didn't get the memo that I was far likelier to survive the war without him.
He took his time kissing me slowly, letting my body become alight with a heat I didn't know it held. I wanted to go faster, but he forcefully refrained himself, slowly working my body making me moan with pleasure.
The picture wasn't moving as much as most did in the Wizarding world, but she tucked her hair behind her ear, her smile faltering just ever so slightly. It was the moment she realized I was going through her memories and betrayed her trust.
"If you're going to arrest him, surely you have to tell him the charges." I said running to keep up. The skinny auror snickered a bit at this.
"Why do you need me? Looks like you already got what you want." I said harshly refusing to show fear. His eyes darkened and he stalked towards me quietly. I glanced around for Nagani and the goblet that he always kept near him, but they were both gone.
I didn’t need to hear more. I didn’t want to hear more. I just nodded and left not even saying bye. He didn’t want to share with me what he knew so I wouldn’t ask. It didn’t change my plans anyways, I was still researching ways to protect myself from the death eaters in the future. Now that I had Snape helping me I might even be able to make progress. At least I hoped so.
“I didn’t. My moneys on Malfoy. You know the saying…the closest thing to love is hate.” He said guessing it right somehow first try. My jaw literally dropped open surprised he had figured it out that fast. He sighed seeing my reactions.
"I have been a gentleman this far Hermione, but I can't see myself resisting temptation much longer." He said lowly, the dangerous way his dark eyes flickered, grazing over my body, enough to keep me warm in the coldest of winters.
I wanted to last longer, but the way he took control, his eyes filled with desire and even his dark mark all just turned me on even more than I could handle.
When we got in the courtroom, it was already filled with people including a presiding judge that I didn't recognize. The rows of people looked at us walking in curiously from their high seats.
I inhaled her lavender scent trying not to let myself dwell on how perfect it smelled. She couldn't be with me. She was innocent and sweet and everything that I wasn't.
“Yesss, very well. You’ve done good. That will work for me. As for your Granger…after much debate, I’ve changed my plans. I want to kill her instead. She’s too powerful to control.” He said uncaringly.
“Who would’ve thought the rule following know it all would be so easy to corrupt?” He said clearly enjoying himself. I laughed a bit despite myself.
"He wasn't exactly faithful while he fucked me, was he?" I asked, loving the horrified look on his face. He released me as if burned shoving me as far away from him as possible.
“I wouldn’t be so sure of that if I were you. Miss Granger here attacked Mr. Wesley.” She said getting right to the point pushing me into the chair opposite of the headmaster firmly.
"Ah Severus! How wonderful. We were just talking about you!" The Headmaster said drawing Minerva's attention to me. I sneered and was annoyed. They always seem to talk about me when I was away. I didn't have time to ask what the conversation was about . Minerva rolled up the newspaper and started smacking me with it harshly, chasing me when I tried to dodge her.
"It's possible I suppose. She has the power for sure. And her mind is just spectacular." He mused going through the book until he found the page he was looking for.
“Well I’m pretty sure I’m not supposed to be here. In your rooms. It’s indecent, crossing a line of mortality.” I said nervously. He stood up frustrated  at this going to the kitchens.
I jumped in helping Tonks with Greyback who was cursing her so rapidly he was quickly becoming overwhelmed. I cursed him from behind stunning him.
There was no response. I put a heating charm on myself while I looked, but I didn't see her anywhere. The snow was piling up fast and I struggled to walk through the thick snow banks.
"You aren't going to accuse me of being dark again are you just because I like him, right?" I asked her. She shook her head.
“Maybe. Its just…Professor Snape won’t talk to me, but I just have this bad feeling.” I said with a sigh. The gold wheel only kept my attention for a few moments before I moved onto a tiny silver bowl of balls that stuck together.
I glanced over the article, but got the main gist of the scandalous article quickly. The picture itself was pretty self explanatory. It was of Granger and I staring into each other's eyes. My fingers were tipping her chin up to look in her eyes to read her mind.
"There are seven billion other people I would rather have dinner with than him. Trust me." I said shaking my head. He had a glimmer of a smile, but it was quickly gone and we walked rapidly down the hill.
"The Dark Lord can feel her magic trying to meld with mine. I had been wondering…I feel way more protective of her than I have anyone else. It makes sense. You HAD to know, right?" I asked my anger dying down a bit realizing he didn't seem to have picked up on it at all. He shook his head, but I could see the gears in his head turning wildly at the possibility. He stood up suddenly and went to one of his bookcases taking out an ancient tomb I had never seen him read before.
"Please. Let me finish." He asked me, showing an uncharacteristic vulnerability. I was angry and hurt and wanted to punch him in his face, but nodded reluctantly.
I felt my energy draining and I wasn't able to deflect even half of the spells. Strangely enough the ones I couldn't block didn't seem to hit me. I had to assume it was my empath magic working, but I was too exhausted to think too much.
"I am going to die. That was the plan." He said. I stopped cold. He was behind me, but I knew he was watching me intently.
“Strange that she would be so hurt by such a comment.” The Headmaster said pointedly, happy she was clearly developing some sort of feelings for me.
"I used to fight just to make it to the next day alive. Now, I fight for you." He said, his voice barely above a whisper. He leaned in and kissed me, soft and longing, his emotion felt entirely by me. My hands came up around his neck and I unclasped the pocket watch in a quick motion. He drew back surprised, but amused.
“I’m sorry for barging in, I just thought…I wasn’t thinking clearly.” I said for once not being fully composed. Something about her made me loose my composure.
In a weird way it almost made sense. Cold blooded death eater was his alter ego almost. A façade that he hid behind to protect himself from the terrible crimes he had to commit.
He responded back drinking his whisky, swirling it absently not even looking at me. It made sense, but I had never considered them just having normal festivities. I assumed they met for rally's and that was it. Looking around the room I could see what he meant. They were exceptionally close, the casual laughter and feeling of warmth in the room was infectious.
I smirked seeing his nose was still quite bruised. I had gone to Madam Pomfrey and she had fixed up my hand good enough to write with it, but it was still swollen. Something that was well worth it.
Each item had emotional significance to him which was ironic considering how cold and calculated he was. I saw some drawings in a book about Salazar Slytherin with a locket in it, and I remembered Ginny saying Riddle's memory had a locket on him. I didn't think we were lucky enough to have killed the locket with him since it was just a memory and not the real thing.
“Severus. She was just in here a few hours ago for having punched him. I hardly think its love.” He confessed enjoying himself quite a lot. My anger died down even more.
He tilted my chin to look at me his fingers lingering on my face for just a moment longer than needed.
The curse stopped just short of me and the dark energy I had taken from Snape seemed to recoil realizing its master was dieing.
I mulled over this idea and had to admit, it had merits. I was all for freedom, but he was right. It was one party system right now. There were no checks and balances and no way for it to remain incorruptible. I hated the idea of being a part of overthrowing an entire government, but in this case it was needed.
"I told you Minerva, see. Can we go now?" Lupin said relieved, obviously having assumed we were sleeping together but having been trying to convince her otherwise.
“To what do I owe this pleasure?” He asked me giving Fawks a note he had just finished writing with his quill.
"You think I don't want you? Hermione, how can someone so brilliant be so idiotic?" He said darkly, focusing on me finally.
"You can't be seen in that. These guys are creeps." Snape said, releasing me instantly, his eyes grazing me over in an not appropriate way for the first time since the lake talk. My clothes had become messed up in the spin and my shirt was showing more than what I typically allowed.
"Conquests? I'm not sure I know what you mean. He just said Voldemort requested he bring you to a meeting to annoy Mr. Potter so you two might be tired. What sort of conquests did he have last night?" She explained gently thoroughly confused by my behavior. I felt dumb. Of course he wouldn't go bragging that he was messing with a student. Even he wasn't that stupid. I took a shallow shaky breath and calmed myself down forcing myself to relax.
I tried to focus on his conversation, but my thoughts went back to her and what I saw and felt in her mind. She was not dark, she was full of lightness and emotions I couldn't even place. She deserved so much better than me and I had a feeling having someone know her secret would bring her back to reality. I tried to tell myself it would be fine and I didn't care, but part of me knew I had already decided she was mine and would lose my mind if anyone else ever touched her.
"Finally. I thought you had gone mad or something. I was asking if you would be so kind as to do a duel with me? I wanted to show the proper defense against the confundus charm. If you will?" He said not leaving much room for argument, waving for me to stand up. I swallowed thickly hating how everyone's attention had shifted to me.
As if I could sleep with her on my mind. I knew it would be a long restless night so I poured myself some more whiskey ready to be drunk at least so the guilty feeling stung slightly less.
"Why are you out here alone?" A familiar voice said, interrupting the silence of looking over the frozen lake. I felt my heart skip a beat and I chanced a glance over my shoulder. He was waiting with his death eater robes already on.
"Hermione, it will help the pain. Goodness, Madame Pomfrey said you would be in pain, but I didn't think it would be this bad. Draco, go get her." I couldn't stop sobbing long enough to even explain it wasn't a physical pain I was dealing with.
“Are you sure? Nothing seems different to me. Her looking at you doesn’t mean she is bonding with you.” The Headmaster said rubbing his thick beard curiously.
“That’s what I thought. You can have him. Filthy.” He said muttering the last word under his breath. I had been so controlled holding back all my emotions lately I felt like a thin window that had been holding it back cracked.
“Ron, why don’t you go with her. It’s not safe to go alone at night, you know.” Lavender said sweetly giving an unwilling Ron a shove.
"Fine." I gave in reluctantly. He waved his wand down me and my school uniform changed into an elegant light white dress that covered every inch of me, yet showed off my figure in a slightly scandalous way. I loved it. It was perfectly safe, yet still a hint of adventure.
"No. Go to your next class." Professor Lupin said leaving no room for discussion. I sighed heavily feeling like the air was going back to normal finally. It had to be all in my mind. The air couldn't become thinner randomly, and there were no dementors here. Maybe everyone was staring because Professor Lupin's magic had vanished. It was quite peculiar actually. I had never seen someone's magic dissipate ever. Deflect, yes, but not dissipate.
"I was looking for dittany, and you know that can ONLY be picked in the moonlight and there is a patch just beyond the gates. Ow! Can you let me go, that hurts!" I retorted hotly playing into the scenario, but also very pained by how strong his grasp was. He turned on me in a second, his anger surprisingly believable.
"Obviously its Stockholm syndrome, you know when you fall in love with your attacker." Draco said with a smirk biting into one of the fruit from a basket on the center table.
"We have to destroy all the horcruxes before the battle. I have the diadem. You have the pocket watch. I know that he has the Helga Hufflpuffs cup with him and I'm fairly sure Nagani is another one." I said, my methodical brain going through the list quite quickly. The look of shock on his face was priceless.
“Okay students! Everyone gather around now. Come on! Don’t be shy! We have a real treat for ya today.” Hagrid said urging everyone to come to him where he had a large cage he was bringing out of his hut. In it sat a tiny beautiful white and gold bird that was watching everyone cautiously.
"Severus...you won't die. We will find a way to save you." I said shaking my head refusing to accept defeat. I couldn't lose him, I had only just started to fall for him. I didn't want to move on, I wanted to stay with him forever. He smiled softly, kissing my forehead.
“I will let you get some rest. Tomorrow we will plan for how to keep Voldemort busy so this type of thing doesn’t happen again. For tonight though, get some sleep.” He said getting up and giving me a pat on the shoulder.
"Ab intus interficere!" Voldemort yelled to kill me. I spun around and saw the green light fly towards me sharply, my fate accepted.
"You've been helping Dumbledore destroy my horcruxes, haven't you?" He said, his eyes red with anger and lack of sleep. I knew I had only minutes to calm him down and heal the wounds before I would die from blood loss.
"The alternative is still on the table." He said twirling his wand ready to hit me with another cruciatus curse. I winced dreading the pain all too much, still shaking from the last rounds.
"Oh, you're an interesting one. Already so brilliant, yet still wanting more, are you?" He asked me stalking through the large columns of things, his power almost tangible in every step.
“Does that mean were done with class today then? I have some studying to do.” Harry asked excited at the prospect of ending early. The only studying he had planned was exploring the inside of Draco’s mouth.
"You're not dead yet Hermione." The soft words startled me in the loud screaming curses and hexes from the two sides.
"I was thoroughly impressed by her self control. Not screaming after nearly an hour being tortured? I have never seen anything like it before." The dark lord mused glancing at quickly book on a small table near his throne.
“Ah…Severus. You feel better. More…energetic.” He hissed joyously taking in Grangers magic around mine.
"Severus, can you at least give us an explanation WHY you killed him?" The judge asked tiredly as if they went through this quite often.
"Hermione!" Harry gasped, very much alive from a few feet from me playing wizards chess with Draco. He rushed over and gave me a hug that I gingerly returned.
"So you see the signs too? I was sure I was mistaken, but I tried to perform a basic spell on her and in a split second my magic evaporated. Her expression was entirely blank, it wasn't like she was shocked to see it vanish. I think she's practiced before." He said with a sad sigh. Hermione. My Hermione. I couldn't let her go.
"Of course you do. All this time...I thought my trusted servant Severus was working against me to destroy my horcruxes. I almost killed him you know?" He asked me, his smile widening at my horror realizing where this was going.
“Not surprised with how much crazy stuff he gets up to. Double spy and all. One of these times, he’s going to get himself killed.” Ron said having no idea how much that idea stressed me out. I didn’t even know why it stressed me out.
“Yes, well, clearly I did well to study up on those spells. I didn’t anticipate using them on you obviously, but they are useful nonetheless.” I said propping his head on the pillow stressing over how pale he was. I poured more of my potion in his mouth and surprisingly he seemed to perk up with it and his shaking died down.
"He will kill you if you hurt me." I yelled trying to pull myself free. Between being a fraction of their size and the wine it was a hopeless cause.
"I'm not hungry." I said with a sigh pushing the plate away and pulling out my transfiguration book.
“A spell Snape has used a few times. I think it silences us to other people.” I said hoping I had cast it right. He only ever seemed to do wandless magic so it was hard to tell.
"I can't defeat him though." I mumbled trying to clear my head, quite sure the dead boy smiled at me.
“I was just looking up spells and such. Studying. Nothing much.” Harry looked me up and down noting my disheveled appearance with my hair taken down and my shirt untucked. I blushed and hurriedly put my hair back up.
I would never normally consider dabbling in the dark arts. It was forbidden and I knew how dangerous it was, how addictive it could become. I was desperate though and I knew if anything held the answer, that was the most likely option.
"I'm...I'm not sure..." Hermione said, confused rubbing her head. Poppy fussed her over instantly running a whole host of spells while giving me a spare glare when she had a second.
When I walked in his office the next day he wasn't alone, a very peeved Minerva was at his desk angrily explaining something to the headmaster who wore his usual empty smile. Lupin was just hanging out in the corner lurking seemingly drug in here not out of his own free will.
"Harry said Draco has been getting called away more and more lately. I think they're gearing up for something personally." She said quietly and more seriously.
"Severus Snape, you have been charged with the murder of Mccoy Finnely on the night of the twenty fourth of December. How do you plead?" The judge asked lightly.
“I think that’s enough for today.” He said abruptly putting away his wand and rolling his sleeves down as if trying to hide the darkness. He grabbed his glass and refilled it.
As if he was the one to accuse someone else of becoming dark. The irony was not lost on me. Not to mention the invasion of privacy of going through my mind. He could have just asked me what happened.
“Your blood pressure is dangerously high. You need to take tomorrow off and just sleep.” I advised him uncorking the potion for him. He just grinned childishly.
"Dead. You didn't kill him, but weakened him enough for Potter to kill with a single spell." He explained with a shrug. As if his entire adult life hadn't been devoted to getting rid of the monster. As if he hadn't almost died by the hands of the very same monster.
His bald scalp was replaced by jet black hair that flowed to his ears perfectly straight. His red eyes had become a light brown that sparkled mysteriously in the most charming of ways. His skin was thick and while still pale, soft and youthful more resembling someone in their twenties than fifties like he was.
“Yea, after you had your fun, huh? Dumbledore will never let you stay at Hogwarts after this!” Harry yelled from the floor getting back up ready for round two. Snape ignored him and turned his focus back to me.
"No. He's a maniac, he always thinks someone is out to get him. I mean, usually someone is, but it's Christmas for heaven's sake. Who would go pissing him off today?" Draco brushed off his leader's sanity. I gulped hoping that's all it was, paranoid mania.
"Why are you stopping? I want you. No one can say what we can do now. What more can you ask for?" I asked, pulling him down a bit not ready to stop. He chuckled and kissed my cheek not giving into my demands.
“Studying. Sure...learn anything new?” Harry asked smiling knowingly but not commenting thankfully on who was just in here.
“Well I’ll be! He seems to like ya!” Hagrid said excitedly as if he hadn’t almost gotten us all killed.
"Of course. He said to do as much. Never take it off." He said, he light mood darkening a bit at the memories. I hummed struggling with finding a way to break the bad news to him.
"Yes, very curious indeed. I decided to do a little digging. First into Grangers history. Did you know that she has empaths in both her mom and dads bloodlines?" He asked me. I shook my head having thought she was just a random genetic fluke.
“I wouldn’t be so sure.” The headmaster said optimistically with his characteristic smile. I sighed and looked back to Hermione feeling my self loathing grow by the second.
"You've been very busy today, haven't you little princess? Killed my snake, my goblet, and my diadem!" He snarled dangerously, every step he came closer I knew I was getting closer to death. My mind reeled a bit. Someone had killed Nagani and destroyed his goblet?
"What the hell Hermione!" He yelled, the entire rooms attention on us now. I didn't even realize I could do wandless magic, but I could feel the air around me crackling with charge and I felt a rush that was unlike anything I felt before.
"Yes, because all I am is a death eater." He said harshly waving his wand and vanishing the table and lights storming away. I chased after him.
I poured over the dark texts feeling disgusted, but also intrigued by the horrid spells they contained. I had no idea the horrible thing humans could think of doing to each other, but it seemed the evil we dealt with nowadays was nowhere as bad as the cruelty that magic folk had back when magic was created.
I remembered reading about the wars they started controlling magic and creating havoc. At the center of almost every war was their bonded. If I was an Empath I would bond with one person and would fight to the death with them.
"She's not poisoned! That won't work. We need an antidote." Draco said pointedly to me. Every potion I had ever brew came to mind in my panic rushing through in a chaotic jumble.
I spent all day trying to get her out of my mind. I was just relieved it was Friday so I wouldn’t have to see her for a few days. I needed to clear my mind and get my bearings before I did something I would regret with her.
Whatever I thought would happen next didn’t. He seemed to remember himself and pulled his hand away taking a large drink of whiskey, his mood changing.
“Ron, that’s fine. No hard feelings, I have to go.” I said trying to push around him to figure out what Snape wanted. Ron grabbed me and swung me around and into his arms, his lips locking with mine in a kiss.
He said having the audacity to seem amused by the whole thing. I had no idea how easily he could put on an evil professor front. It made it even more so apparent how much of his personality was for show. I couldn't blame him since any wrong move would mean death, but it was difficult to digest anyhow.
"It will only be a moment." He insisted, the look in his eyes bothered to a degree that I knew there was no shaking him off.
"Of course my Lord. Anything you need." I said bowing out when he flicked his wrist shooing me away. I had to convert Granger to the dark side. No problem. She was only one of the most staunch supporters of the Order.
“What colors do you prefer?” She snapped her annoyance increasing knowing I wasn’t paying attention.
The pain coursed through my body with a stronger intensity that I had ever felt. I had truly pissed him off.
The moment I got into the headmasters office I felt my panic starting to come back. He was awake, but in long flowing pajama like robes as opposed to his normal robes. I had to wonder if the old man ever slept.
I swept through the halls, the students parting letting me pass terrified of my horrible mood. I had almost made it to my class, which I only had a few minutes before it would start when Lupin found me. I growled trying to walk faster, but his werewolf side let him keep pace.
By the time I got back to Gryffindor rooms we were both exhausted and ready for sleep so gave a quick hug and a goodbye.
"The war is going to be intense, just remember whatever happens I will make sure you are not killed. You CANNOT let him take power. I can't guarantee he won't torture you, but he will try to kill you, and I will stop him." He warned me firmly, his eyes locking with mine trying to make sure I understood the seriousness of what he was saying.
“Come on Severus. Up you go.” He said helping him to his feet seeming to understand his unspoken need. The walk to his rooms was silent and I couldn’t get there fast enough, ready to help him get healed. He was dirty and shaking so I knew the torture had to have gone on for some time. As soon as his room doors closed behind me I couldn’t resist and had to ask.
"R.R." Draco said once class dismissed coming over to us once we were the only ones left in the room. It was our code for room of requirement that we made incase there were nosey students lurking around d us.
I had often wondered why Voldemort didn’t die when the killing curse had rebounded, but had never gotten far in figuring that out. Voldemort’s sudden loss of interest in killing Harry had triggered my suspicions that there was something in it for him to keep Harry alive. I wasn’t sure what, but it had to be significant.
"You can make that choice when you are sober." He said plainly, reminding me of my inebriated state. He was right, I wasn't thinking clearly. I hummed letting my hands roam over his body hungrily. Did I need to be thinking clearly for that? I was pretty sure I was sober enough to give a passable performance, though I didn't really have much experience to go off of.
The Dark Lord slashed his wand without warning attacking Dumbledore, the curse easily waved off. Chaos ensued with both sides erupting in battle. It was pointless. I was going to die anyways so I crumpled next to Harry letting the coldness from blood less overtake me.
"They will let themselves out." He said not caring about formalities. I found myself caring significantly less also feeling the relaxation of being with him edging me towards a deep sleep.
"Yes. The only thing left to do is give you what you want, right?" He asked with a bit of a devilish implication. I blushed finishing my plate and drinking some more wine. The goblet filled up automatically so I had no idea how much I had drunk.
"NOOOOOOO." My scream echoed in the round room as his body crumpled to the floor lifeless , his green eyes open, but without their sparkle anymore.
If everyone wants to talk about how I'm going to the dark side, or whoring myself for grades...well I might as well do it? Why hide when they enjoy talking about it so much.
"Two." The curse that Antonin had cast on me leapt to the front of my mind, the purple streak across my chest causing a blinding pain.
The decorations donned every inch of the cold castle and the red and gold colors overwhelmed even a Gryffindor like me. I would have been fine with a bit of silver here and there, but the color scheme was two tone only.
"You heard me. No. She got dragged into this entire mess to save our asses and buy us time to figure out how to get rid of the Dark Lord. I'm not going to then turn around and tell her she needs to give up time at school also. She has yet to complain about anything asked of her. Didn't complain when she was tortured by him. She forgave me when she found out I was intentionally manipulating her for my own selfish goals." I explained realizing how true the words were as I spoke them. She wasn't an angel, she had a defiant devilish streak, but she was also very selfless. I couldn't force her to drop her classes also. She was going to hate me once she read the paper, but I didn't want her to suffer anymore than necessary even if she wouldn't be with me.
The holidays came up with a speed that gave me some much needed alone time without him. I spent much of my time in the library looking up possible horcruxes and going over history that would help me figure out what he had been up to.
"Say what you want, but justice has been served. I did what you were too cowardly to do. Not that it didn't suit my needs as well. The Dark Lord was pleased I killed a disgusting squib and the Headmaster was pleased I killed a child abuser. I couldn't thank you enough for your lack of action actually. Its served me perfectly. Now...if you don't mind I must be back to Hogwarts. I have things to attend to." He said with a smirk getting up to leave. The Aurors immediately had their wands drawn and pointed at both of us. He chuckled sourly.
My reflexes were slowing down with blood loss, but I did my best to help everyone out. We were severely outnumbered though and the order members were quickly stunned or bound.
"Of course. If you had the chance to stop time, wouldn't you?" He asked me seriously, stopping under a tree that was bare in the cold winter, but still gave us a good relaxing spot in the winter. He cast a wandless warming spell and sat down with me.
"Your kidding! There's no way...I mean I was just kidding. The hell. No wonder. It's the biggest potions supplier in all history. I mean the monopoly you have on the market for potions and ingredients is just...wow." I said when I recovered from the shock. He chuckled a bit and glanced to me enjoying my reaction.
We walked slowly towards her and her eyes shot up from the paper to us, her expression of utter fury. She would probably hate me now and want nothing to do with me. I had ruined her perfect reputation and the embarrassment she felt would have been overwhelming.
"Save him. He can owe me a life debt. He deserves the shame of owing his life to a muggleborn." I said barely above a whisper. He growled a bit obviously not liking my plan, but reluctantly gave in, releasing Lucius who got up scampering away faster than I had ever seen anyone run before.
“I knew my father was behind this! This is my fault. Last year I talked so much about how annoying she was and it was a shame she was pretty for a mudblood.” Draco admitted guiltily sitting next to Harry on my rug.
"Imagine my surprise the first time she responded to my thoughts in my mind. I thought she had learned some sort of wordless spell to read minds. Foolishness now looking back." I said tipping over a small magnetic contraption darkly annoyed at my own idiocy.
"You fucking IMBECILE! You thief! How dare you steal AGAIN?" My father roared picking me up by my collar despite my shrieks of terror, shaking me roughly.
"She looks happy." I said quietly, only looking back at Minerva after a long moment, letting the words linger.
“Maybe. They are based on existing spells, but he seems to have modified them for his liking. I don’t they you can create new magic rules anymore. You have to work with what’s established putting together smaller spells and enchantments to make different effects.” I explained not sure if I really understood it well.
“Well yes obviously. He was so geeky looking when I first started Hogwarts but now…” She trailed off blushing.
"THIS!" She said throwing the paper at me. Part of the daily prophet tumbled to the floor, but the other part I managed to grab just to see my picture in the first page.
I didn’t think she had bonded with me yet. It was a step in the right direction. Somehow I had assumed the bonding was only one way. I didn’t anticipate her taking my magic or being left with a piece of hers. It was somehow far more intimate than her kiss had been, and that had been fiery in the best of ways.
He ended the curse and changed tactics, the curse whispered with an urgent air under his breath. I felt my body slam into the wall opposite of me, several bones cracking in the process.
"History books obviously." He shook his head and his eyes roamed over me hungrily in a way I was quite unfamiliar with.
"I shouldn't have said anything. The things they wrote about you were horrid. I don't know why they would assume you guys were sleeping together just because I took a picture of you looking in his eyes. I took the picture originally to prove Ron was wrong. He thought Snape was using you, but the way he was looking at you was so...protective. Caring." She explained, filled with more regret than what the situation deserved. I was quiet letting my own anger at her simmer down. It seemed like she really didn't mean for it to happen.
"Oh really? I know most of us would be ecstatic to get more than a one night stand out of him. He just refuses to commit. A player in every sense of the word." Bellatrix said watching Snape dreamily making sure her dress was down in the front enough to give him a good view. Snape just rolled his eyes and talked to some death eater I didn't know. I thought back to his comment at the lake. He never got attached so he could die easier. It was such a dark thing to go through life with.
If I thought we were going in alone I was mistaken. At the entrance of the ministry the entire order waited for us.
“Severus if your done playing with your toy our guest has arrived.” Voldemort said switching the attention off of me. I looked behind me and sure enough an enraged Harry and Draco were both quickly approaching the group of death eaters wands pulled out. They would die if they fought, for sure. Strangely enough Voldemort made no move to attack either boy, he just sat on his throne thoroughly pleased to have riled them up.
I assumed she would pass us, but she grabbed the front of my robes and pulled me in for a kiss. I stopped in my tracks, all rationality entirely gone. I had always kissed her, not the other way around. Somehow the fact she initiated the kiss made it even more delectable than usual and I slid my arms around her pulling her in then slid a hand into her hair turning her head to deepen the kiss.
"No idea. Maybe he's just lost what little sanity he has left." Draco said brushing off my worry. Harry frowned worrying just like me of what the end game was.
"I was looking for Ravenclaw's missing diadem." I admitted taking the stairs up to the Gryffindor common room much slower than usual in my tired state.
"I think that's why they were killed off. People like him getting control." Dumbledore said quietly. I walked over to his table of trinkets, my mind reeling from what this meant for the war.
"I'll keep it to myself. It's not like anyone would believe me anyways." I said wondering how no one had figured out who he was yet. Perhaps years of being a spy just made him that much better at hiding personal details.
There were countless trees on my property, but I headed towards them looking for her in their midst.
“I think that’s enough.” He said with a chuckle backing up leaving me alone on the pedestal desiring him even more. It was only then that I remembered the audience.
“Of course it is. I corrupted it many year ago Granger. I can see if I can take it back.” He said unsurely. We were in uncharted territory for sure, I had never heard of magic stealing in the many, many books I had read before.
“Crucio.” The slick words were followed by the most immeasurable pain I could have ever felt. My body writhed and I collapsed to the floor rolling up in a ball instinctively trying to fight the pain. I wouldn’t scream. Not for him. I wouldn’t give him the pleasure.
"Oh, I'm sorry Miss. Granger. I missed the update that you are too special to make the correct potion. Surely you don't assume you are so beautiful you wouldn't have any use for a beautification potion?" I said silkily, my anger at her for practicing the dark arts coming out full force. She looked shocked, then hurt. I could hear a few of the slytherins snickering at this comment despite the fact that I knew they had been talking before the break about her attractiveness.
"I suppose you're now her personal speaker are you? Since your busy helping her with hers, I assume your is perfect?" He paled a bit giving a shrug.
"I asked him to do it." The silence that followed this admission was thick. I couldn't imagine ever asking for one of my family members to die. It was such a cold and calculated murder, how he could sleep at night knowing what he did baffled me.
“Nonsense! He doesn’t even like girls. Surely you realize that?” I snapped over his childish tactics. His eyebrows went up at my statement not having known that.
He sat on his throne and took a drink from his goblet thoughtfully watching me unsure of how to proceed clearly. The emblem on the goblet stood out to me.
“Ten points to slytherin for being first done. Bottle and put your sample on the table.” Snape said distractedly, not really impressed with the blonds accomplishments.
"Hermione!" Mr. Wesley hissed, but I ignored it walking forward knowing chances were I would be walking to my death.
"She has enough credits to graduate. I hardly teach her anything of use. Oh by the way. She was the one who created the potion to fix your hand. Not me." I snarled angry motioning to his now healed hand. I didn't understand how he was turning his back on her so quickly. She would be devastated.
"Think you're so clever, don't you? Think you're going to kill me, eh? Well guess what mudblood. You missed one. And you will never. Ever. Find it. My most trusted servant has kept it safe all this time. I'm still immortal, while you...you are not my pretty." He said stopping mere inches from me. My eyes widened realizing what had happened.
"Waiting to be kidnapped." I said truthfully. He raised an eyebrow and held his hand out to help me up.
"What so every stressed student is a death eater now? I don't think the Dark Lord realizes how strong his ranks are." I said sarcastically swirling her pain potion savoring the relaxing feeling it gave me.
“Miss Granger, I know you have had a rough few weeks, but taking it out on your friends is not becoming of someone with your brilliance.”  The headmaster chided me while still managing to give me a compliment. I tipped my chin up like Snape told me to, my confidence somehow growing even just with not hanging my head .
"It's just...immoral. He's my teacher. He's a death eater, you people kill people like me normally. I don't get why you haven't killed me yet." I said trying to sound more confident than I felt. He raised an eyebrow questioningly.
"As if." I said sure I would not ever end up in his bed, let alone expecting his child. The thought was so humorous I found myself laughing despite myself. Voldemort heard it and smiled pleased I was enjoying myself and I was finally relaxed enough I didn't even care.
"What's a king without a queen?" He asked with a smirk taking my hand and kissing it. It was only then that I realized what I was missing.
“Be that as it may, I think maintaining your control is important. Using magic while angry can have devastating consequences for all involved. Controlling your magic is very important.” He advised me sagely. It took me a second to catch up to him.
"I didn't realize you wanted me to. Pretty sure we have to do more than kiss for that." I said with a laugh. He smiled, kissed my cheek and went back to his cooking.
“Dumbledore only has two more votes than us. I tortured Rowley and Quinton and they agreed to switch sides and give us the vote in exchange for their families protection. That leaves just McKinney, who I was able to bribe which will give us the majority. The plan is take control of the parliament seats first, give away lots of money to everyone and show good will and acceptance. Once the next election comes up Lucius will be put forth and we will secure the Ministry of Magic.”
"They both groomed you from such a young age to be exactly what they wanted. Its...horrid." I said tearfully. He came to me and brushed away my tears, smiling a bit his head quirked.
"I want you to encourage it. Keep your enemy's close, right? If we turn her, we turn Potter. You saw how he came running in to her rescue. I have Draco working on Potter also. If I can't kill him I might as well have him at my disposal and not have all my plans ruined by him. Plus, I get a new weapon." He explained referring to Granger. I relaxed slightly realizing I wasn't going to die. Today at least.
I would ignore him next time I saw him. I would be strong. I had to forget him. It couldn't be that hard, could it?
"Professor, ummm, I think perhaps you shouldn't..." Draco tried to step in alarmed, but I silenced him with a deadly glare. Potter looked at the potion nervously adjusting his glasses clearly having no confidence in his own potion making skills.
“I wanted to see if there was anything I could learn about using a spell on multiple people at once.” I admitted trying to get thoughts of him in the dark with me out of my head. He glanced down at the book and shook his head.
"So did you guys...you know...I've always wondered what he looks like under his robes. He clearly takes care of himself, you know?" She said grabbing some of my popcorn I had gotten from the kitchens since I missed lunch again and eating it loudly.
"The plan was to make you fall in love with me and not develop feelings, but here I am at midnight in the middle of the night risking everything just because you looked a little sad." He said quietly with a bit of a sarcastic laugh, his frustration with himself evident.
"You could feed an extreme village for a year with that kind of money. I've never read about that in any books." I said surprised.
I turned the page in the old dusty tomb I was reading on old spells that were good for combat type situation. Everything I was reading assumed you were in one on one combat though. A fallacy of magic I supposed the death eaters took advantage of. They never worked alone.
"We don't have as much time as I had hoped. I know I won't make it through this war, but I want you to be treated like a queen tonight so when you move on you will demand the same from wherever you choose to be with." He said lifting my hand and kissing it gently. His black eyes glimmered with an unspoken emotion that took my breath away.
“Great! It’s wonderful stuff eh? Good for beasts wounds and such and his is much stronger than the knock offs they make in the stores and all.” He explained feeding the thunderbird some rat meat. The small bird gobbled it up hungrily giving a little steak of appreciation.
"Then there will be a fight! We are not letting you take them!" Tonks said full of attitude and about to curse him, but I stopped her.
“He took notice of your strength last time you were there, yes. It was mentioned.” The headmaster admitted.
"How dare you? What is wrong with you?" She snapped gasping a bit for breath and shaking slightly. I felt incredibly guilty.
By the time I made it to the castle she had gained some of her color back and I could see the bruise from my hand quite nicely on her cheek.
Harry, Draco and I trudged down to care of magical creatures Monday early having woken up quite early unintentionally. I was extremely nervous about my meeting with Snape later today, but they seemed highly energy without any real reason.
“Well, what are you waiting for? Go get her. I’m already annoyed enough Severus, don’t test my patience.” I ground my teeth and closed my eyes for a second, the reality of the decision I was about to make weighing on me. Yet it was also the easiest thing I had to do.
Christmas Eve came with much anticipation. Harry was in a festive mood celebrating with Draco who was soaking up all the free time to do nothing of importance.
"I bet it's just divine having Severus here at your beck and call. I've tried for years to woo him, but clearly the intellectual type is more his taste." Bellatrix said over the chatter leaning in. She was stunning in a dark celebrated type of way with a black dress and silver accents in her attire.
“I suppose he just knows I won’t hurt him.” I said with a shrug. Hagrid hummed thoughtfully but waved me off to my next class.
I could feel his breath behind me and his arms wound around me comforting me and pulling me to him. I heard him whisper some spells to give us some privacy, his voice calming despite my anger with him.
It was amazing to have that kind of power over someone, but also terrifying. What if I made bad decisions and brought him down with me? He was a key part of ending the war and if I distracted him in the wrong way he would end up ruining everything. A world with the Dark Lord as leader. It would be a nightmare.
"YOU TRAITOR!" I screamed, the pain of every lie he ever told me infuriating me. My magic crackled around me dangerously and even the Dark Lord took a step back surprised. Snape just had a slight ironic smile under his mask.
"JUST a witch? No. You're the future. The present. Your everything you desire and more." He said dramatically, his sincerity was just overwhelming and I could entirely understand why people would fall for him. I could humor him while remembering he was a psychopath. Other people would fall for his charm like dominos.
I was silent on the walk and endured Professor McGonagall’s lectures without being bothered. By the time we got to the headmasters office she had spent all her energy lecturing me and seemed calmer.
Harry yelled with a fury I had never seen out of him before when he saw my state. He turned his wand to Snape and charged slinging every curse he could think of at the man. Snape just rolled his eyes and waved his wandless hand making Harry's wand fly into his hand and brushed away all the spells that were carelessly thrown.
I zoned out paying the bare minimum attention to her many outfits she had gotten from the second hand shop that looked amazing on her. She could wear rags and look good. Snape had intentionally went out to find me tonight. He was drunk, sure, but it was like he couldn’t resist the urge to come play with my mind. Make me think he wanted me just to leave. I was curious how far he would have gone if Dumbledore hadn’t shown up when he did. His comments about what he regret come back up and I had to force my heart rate to not speed up unbearably.
“You know perfectly well I would never lay a finger on a student under normal circumstances.” He ground out lowly, his eyes flashing dangerously at the accusation.
She was still sleeping when I got out, so I went to make breakfast when the bookshelf caught my eye. The books were out of order. I sighed seeing that every single one she had pulled out was dark magic. My magic in her was undoubtedly pulling on her trying to get her to release it. Obsess over learning more magic in such a subtle way you didn’t even realize the darkness was manipulating you.
I was going to hell for what I wanted to do to her, but she was heaven itself so worth it in every way.
"Why do you think that?" He asked curiously. I bit my lip nervously not wanting to confess about the horcruxes knowing he would tell Harry.
"Draco, it's me." I whispered trying to hold back my laughter at his horror. He called down when I took the cloak off so he could see me.
Yet, the burning light of life woke me from my deep painful sleep refusing me the death I wanted so dearly.
"God dammit, wake up woman!" I yelled furiously losing control of my magic for the first time that I could remember since I was a small child. It flowed through my hands into her shocking her with an electric shock that opened her eyes immediately.
“I will consider it. Your advice is helpful as always.” I said finishing the hot chocolate and giving him his cup back, my hands shaking slightly less now.
"Not everyone is all good or all bad. I picked the side with the least comparable evil. I don't fight just for the Headmaster. I fight for our entire side. Freedom to marry who we want and love who we want." He said tipping my chin up gently looking in my eyes with such a depth that I couldn't look away.
"Miss. Granger!" The Headmaster said coming in, quite alive and well in stunning blue robes, the evidence of the battle quite nonexistent on him.
Snape’s plan for changing our governing system was bold. It went against everything we were taught to respect in a government. Freedom was supposed to be a given right of modern day countries, so to intentionally take away peoples freedom was not going to go over well with all people.
"Where are we going?" I asked, getting more concerned as we climbed the spiraling stairs round and round up through the tower.
I vaguely heard Poppy fussing over me and several calming spells being cast on me until I finally stopped sobbing, my emotions held back by her spells.
"Oh, I'm not allowed to kiss Lucius, but it's not like you're making any moves." I said snarkily, snatching my arm out of his vice grasp. He spun on me fast stopping in his tracks.
"I'm sorry. I'm busy." I said brushing him off going back to my reading refusing to acknowledge him. He slammed his hands on the table and leaned in angrily, his mood sour.
I was stunned by how the fuck he was alive, but I nodded numbly following his lead. I would fight until the death even if that was only minutes away.
His voice rang through my foggy brain and I realized he could do reverse legilimency on me to put his thoughts in my mind. Which was odd since my mind was a scrambled mess.
“What? Never seen a man shirtless before?” I snapped wanting to get back on track to keeping her out of the books, but confused why she didn’t seem scared of me.
"Fiendfyre." I said emotionlessly holding my wand aloft focusing my magic on destroying the two dark objects. The fire washed over the horcruxes, heating them and making them rattle noisily. After a long moment I ended the curse, but the horcruxes were still there.
“He’s not bad looking at all.” I mused thinking of how fast he had gone from plump kid to chiseled with a little help from puberty over the last few years.
"The Dark Lord gave it to me the day my father died. Its not a locket though, it's a pocket watch." He said showing it to me, flipping over the silver cover to reveal a ticking clock inside. The carving around the edge of the pocket watch was unsuitable though. I reached out to touch it and immediately recoiled feeling the dark magic wafting off it.
"He killed my mother." He said after a moment with a sigh. It was the sadness in his eyes that I knew I wouldn't forget.
"Don't be silly Severus. How would I have arranged such a thing?" He said in a way that only made me more sure I was right. I knew he was a master puppeteer, but I had always assumed all his plans were for his own personal glory.
He pulled me towards him not concerned with someone seeing us with how dark it was and before I could stop him, kissed me in a way that made my heart soar.
We didn't have to worry about moral conduct here. No one was watching or would stop us, it was just us alone.
“It was my fault. I goaded him. Well worth it though. We just came to a new understanding of our mutually beneficial relationship.” He said casually as if they had just rewritten a contract.
I started to panic and tried to grab them, but the moment I touched them, they crumbled into a pile of ashes.
I found a text that focused on horcrux and knew I found my target. When the killing curse backfired it had made Harry the horcrux. Of course. It made perfect sense. To kill Harry would mean killing part of himself.
“I found some important research I thought you might be interested in for one of your…tasks…you’ve been assigned.” The headmaster said giving me a small smile before turning his attention on a drunk Snape.
"How can they just turn a blind eye to murder! Child abuse! Its horrid. I can't believe someone can just stand by and let it happen all for money." I said disgusted at the vermin that filled this place. He smiled wryly at me closing the metal gates on the elevator taking us back out.
Perhaps me pushing him away was my heart's way of protecting itself from the oncoming loss I knew I would be devastated by.
"Severus?" The massive panther had just drawn his claw back to slash Lucius across the face and kill him, but it froze, seeming to realize I was still there.
"Severus, Severus. Rise my trusted servant." The Dark Lord hissed from his throne at Malfoy manor. My heart was pounding from screaming from the cruciatus curse for so long and my throat felt swollen. His good mood from the holidays was gone and I had managed to royally piss him off.
"It depends on who you ask of course." Severus said nonchalantly sitting in the large chair in the middle of the floor. The judge looked down at me standing beside him and I only then realized the aurors had left.
"What is today? Hermione has no right day? Who is he to tell you what happened? Bragging about his conquests, was he?" I snapped fighting back tears hating how rude I was being, but just so frustrated with everyone. She looked taken aback and then concerned.
I wanted to scream for help. Run away. Do something to get away from them, but no sooner had I decided on an exit plan did Snape give me a dark warning glare. I wasn’t sure what would happen if I tried to escape into the darkness but I suspected it was worse than Voldemort.
"Just a few things for Hagrid." I said wincing realizing he hadn't actually realized I got into his stores yet. He shook his head but thankfully didn't blow up.
"It's everything you wanted, isn't it?" I didn't have to turn around. It was the Dark Lord. I could feel his presence behind me like a dark cloud moving in.
“You deliberately disobeyed me. If you want to be dark I can take you to the Dark Lord and you can feel the pain that comes with going to his side. Did you not see what he did to me?” I yelled, grabbing another book and throwing it at her. She leapt up to doge it and was still grinning not seeming terrified of me. I growled and stalked to her wanting to put the fear of God in her. I couldn’t lose her. I would do anything to not lose her, even if she hated me for it.
"Don't make more promises you can't keep, I know he has to die. And stop reading my mind!" I said upset with myself for having trusted him more than anything. He was a death eater, what did I expect?
This life isn't my own to live, but with my actions I hope one day you will get to enjoy yours to the fullest. I can't give you myself as we both know where the future will take us, but I can give you everything else you desire.
Malfoy's house was grand and had exquisite marble everywhere we walked. I didn’t have time to process. I was at the feet of Voldemort in seconds of coming in, thrown in a heap like garbage being tossed to the curb.
"What took so long? You left last night." Harry said sounding honestly relieved, dragging me over to the warm crackling fire they had made camp at.
"A teacher's salary isn't much to get by on." I responded knowing there was no way he could support two people on his meager earnings. Her eyebrows went up dramatically.
“Thanks so much. I’m freezing.” I said taking the drink gratefully. She watched me for a long moment not immediately leaving.
"Shh...I got you." He said controllingly somehow managing to force me to stay in the heightened state of arousal but refusing to let me cum. He thrust in and out harder and faster, his pace picking up, moving my hips to suit his needs.
I knew Snape had told me to refuse, but I didn't know if I was willing to trust that. If I refused, the Dark Lord would undoubtedly kill me, finding me not useful anymore. If I gave in, I was risking the entire collapse of society. The options were exceptionally dim for me.
“There’s no meeting tonight. You’ll be fine.” He said quietly mistaking my nervousness about potentially poisoning the potions master for nervousness about being kidnapped again. I smiled meekly realizing that is where my concern should have been.
Elijah was standing there, his eyes wide having witnessed me question her about her loyalties and me hug her. It was entirely inappropriate and was not allowed by any means. I wasn't scared of being fired, I was untouchable legally, but I knew she would be devastated if word got out. Judging by the way she rushed past him looking down, she was already embarrassed. She wouldn't want anyone to know she had feelings for someone like me, I was sure of it.
"Ah Professor Snape, should've known it was you out here. Always making sure everyone's indoors, are ya?" Hagrid said bearishly before his eyes caught sight of me.
"I can feel it. His soul is stuck in it. Begging me to release it. I don't know how to destroy it, but I am very confident in what it is." I said surely looking at the cursed object uneasily.
"Why else would Voldemort be interested in me? I mean, it makes sense. Snape said the plan was to make me bond with him, it was Voldemort's plan. I assumed he just meant to develop affection, but now that I think about it, I think he meant magically bond. Which Empaths do." I confessed realizing as I said it aloud that it really did make perfect sense. He was quiet for a long moment considering.
“Knowing you, you probably planned this just to have a reason to continue aggravating me even more.” He snapped giving me a little shove. I smirked.
I looked at the top section of the bookshelf realizing in my short stature I was missing out on a whole realm of books.
“I can assure you, I couldn’t be more straight.” He said with a smirk pulling my hair out of its ponytail letting it fall down around my face. My mind raced realizing what he had planned. My mind said fuck no, but my body ached for more. I had never really wanted to kiss or go further with guys because I never enjoyed it. My body knew what pleasure he could give me and wanted more.
“He’s a jerk to everyone.” I explained  not wanting rumors to start about us. Especially since there was no us.
"I assumed you were a gold digger. Evidently not. Just thirsty." She said with a salacious smile eating her food amused.
"Well then. She seems to have made up her mind. Teacher's Assistant it is." The Headmaster said clearing his throat giving me a look of happy shock and motioned for me to go to the head table.
“I like guys, thank you very much. At least that’s something we have in common Draco.” I retorted with a grin. Just then Ron came down the hill and he immediately glared at me then went to the other side of the grass area we held classes at with a few other lingering students.
"I hope you enjoy the dish? I went with something non traditional. After all, your not quite the steak and potatoes type." He said with an amused smirk eating his own food steadily. I noticed the slight shake of his hand and realized he had to have just come from a meeting. Obviously it hadn't gone good.
I was silent and began working trying to hold back my thoughts that threatened to overtake me in the silence of the room. I had gotten by on the loud chatter of the castle for the last few months and managed to avoid silence, but now it hit me like a freight train.
"Eh, almost is nothing. Unless you actually kill her, don't be too hard on yourself." Draco said with a nonchalant shrug. He could stand there and act like he didn't care all he wanted, but when she passed out he was the first to respond, so I knew it was just his defensive wall he showed the world. In that way we were very similar.
“I suppose he learned his lesson then, didn’t he?” The headmaster said amused at my tactics relaxing weirdly relieved I wasn’t using my magic. I was just relieved he wasn’t angry and wanted to kick me out.
"Granger. I need your presence." Snape said, interrupting seeming urgent. I humphed, folding my arms glaring at him and ignoring the library's pointed glances. Snape just seemed confused why she was staring at him so creepily.
“No. What’s funny is you thinking you have any right to care what book I’m reading. If I want to practice the dark arts, then so be it.” I said refusing to back down.
I was obsessed with Wizarding history. The more history was in an object, the more fascinating it was to me. I spent most of my time pouring over old tombs that were written hundreds of years ago absorbing the wisdom of precious generations.
I expected Severus to complain more, but he just rolled his eyes at my stubbornness and sighed, resigning himself to the fact I wasn't going to leave.
“Then what? People will never trust the ministry again. They will rebel.” I said shaking my head sure the plan would fail.
If he had tried to kiss me a month prior I would’ve swooned happy to have the attention. He’s not bad looking either and had filled out over the last year almost as much as Neville.
"Quite alright." She mumbled more to herself than me as the students started to trickle in. I counted down the minuets until class was over making sure not to make eye contact with Ron at all. Harry, ever the sweetheart sat by me and drew funny cartoons of Ron flying off his chair and animating them to cheer me up, a tactic that actually worked slightly.
"Bitch, instead of sitting there crying, why don't you teach your child how to behave!" My father snarled, giving her another kick just for emphasis before taking the crackers and leaving, stomping with every step.
It proved a point, but also I have wanted to do that for so long. Kill two birds with one stone type deal. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I've created a whole mess for you I'm sure.
"You can't tell anyone. I have enough difficulty beating off the suitors as is, not to mention the student's constant advances." He said with a mockery of seriousness.
“If its that easy, why doesn’t everyone just make their own custom spells for everyday life?” I asked curiously.
When he finally opened the latch to the top of the tower I was stunned by what I saw. A hundred small glimmering orbs hung suspended all around the top of the tower lighting up the space delicately. There was a small table with hot food on it and two glasses of wine with its own candle on it. It was a beautiful setup fit for a queen.
"What did she think of that?" The headmaster asked surprised since that wasn't in the list in his book. It was hardly a comprehensive list.
"Hopefully whatever happens, happens soon. I want to get on with my life. The drama they cause is enough to make me want to leave the Wizarding world altogether." I said with annoyance knowing I could never actually turn my back on them. Ginny nodded understandingly.
"I suppose so. How old were you when you started taking it?" I asked, feeling slightly less guilty about our age difference now. I had sped time up, while he was stopping time.
"That locket, where did you get it?" I asked curiously. He glanced down at it surprised by the change in topic.
I twisted the ring he gave me in my hand forgetting where I was in the advanced healing book yet again, my thoughts drifting to that night under the stars. The way he kissed me wasn't like I had been kissed before. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what the difference was. It held a desire that I felt within myself. A passion that drove me mad just to think about wanting to forget everything I said and kissing him again like that.
"Yes, well he paid for it heavily." He said, a bit sad remembering it. I felt my throat clench up wondering what he endured just to keep me safe.
"Go ahead now." He said with anticipation ready for me to work my magic literally. I was assuming I would have weeks or maybe even months to prepare. I looked to Snape a bit desperately.
I wanted him to make it through this war so we could enjoy a future together, not just passing moments. He seemed resigned to the fact that he would die, but I knew I had to find a way to save him. I didn't want to spend my life with someone else. I wanted to spend it with him.
Snape glared at me, his normal loathing coming back full force. Of course it would, we were enemy's. Nothing more of course.
"Nevermind him. So did I tell you what Longbottom was doing while I was…" I zoned out of the rest of the conversation, my mind taken over by thoughts of what Voldemort's plan could be now. I seemed to be apart of it, but why?
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know you would drink it.” I blurted out suddenly feeling so guilty. He just chuckled.
"Severus...are you sure we should do this in his house?" I asked not sure if the Dark Lord had some sort of monitoring setup or something. It was the creepy thing he would do. Severus hummed against my skin and stopped for a moment confused.
“What are you doing here? Ginny said you didn’t come back again and asked if I could find you. She was worried. I don’t know why considering you always sneak off.” Harry said grabbing the book I was reading and putting it on a random shelf annoying my OCD mind.
“I can smell her on you.” It shouldn’t have been such a terrifying statement, yet it was. I fidgeted with my wand absently debating how to respond.
“You want to learn how to make spells? Lucky for you, I am your person. We will start small and work up. My only condition is you don’t practice anything you don’t know the effects of on anyone until we have had time to test it ourselves. If we don’t know the counter curse this can turn deadly fast.” He explained going back to teacher mode, his playful air from earlier evaporating.
Like a waterfall came over me I felt his magic pass through my wrist and back to me, this time pulling mine back out with it. His eyes grew wide and he let go abruptly.
"I don't want to be without you and Azra." He said giving me a hug relishing the complete feeling I had hugging him.
“Oh, of course, your friend coming over wasn’t a normal occasion. You had to celebrate.” I mocked him knowing that wasn’t how it was at all, but so angry that he wouldn’t leave that I didn’t care if he was angry. He seethed and his fist clenched, but he didn’t try to attack me surprisingly.
After what felt like forever I found her sitting at the base of an apple tree, slumped over and blue from the cold.
“Now, let’s say we want to change things up. I want to levitate this mouse, but wingardium leviosa doesn’t have the desired effect. Wingardium leviosa will make the object fly up, whereas I want the mouse to levitate slowly. I would use levimus" He said showing me a mouse in a plastic container he had prepared for my lesson. It was cute and brown and I just wanted to let it roam free instead of being all caged up.
"Why save Harry? Is it because you loved his mother?" I asked remembering Harry said they were close during school. He shook his head.
I couldn't understand how if Snape hated me, why did he take care in how he went about Voldemort's orders? Looking back he was clearly decisive about doing things his way.
"AGH!" I made a pained noise and he ended the hug abruptly, his dark eyes so much lighter than what I remembered. They were almost a light grey.
"Headmaster, you know that's not how this works. No one gets a taste of the dark arts and DOESN'T convert. They are more powerful than any drug you could take." I said shaking my head knowing it was a useless cause. He gave me a pointed look.
"Your admires. We had so many gifts we had to use one of the store rooms." Harry said unabashedly while eating my candy. I wasn't a fan of sugar anyways so its not like I would ever eat it.
I was such an idiot. I was supposed to be making her bond with me, and here I was hitting her and letting her freeze to death on my very own property.
“Sorry.” I said jumping back not wanting to hurt him. He ran his fingers down my cheek letting them linger before dropping them, looking to the Headmaster a bit desperately.
"Severus. Hold on. I will figure something out!" I said panicking sure I could save him. He reached up and touched my cheek shakily, his warm hand growing cold.
"He put the thought into Lucius's head to get her. I'm fairly sure he was having some of the Slytherins annoy her to get her in detention so she would be an easy target. He suspected she was an empath, but he wanted to see for himself. I tried to connect with her as much as possible when I…" I trailed off unable to finish my statement.
"He was going at me, I never saw him that angry before EVER. When I told him I was gay he didn't even flinch, he just said 'obviously' so I hoped he wouldn't flip his shit too much, but DAMN. My mom had to step in to give me time to explain." Draco said shaking his head remembering his dad's blow up.
"Age freezing potions. Each potion only lasts thirty days but stops the aging process for that time. Each bottle costs five thousand gallons so it's just for the elite clientele or those wishing to spend just a little more time with their loved ones. Brewing the potion is finicky and its one of the few I brew myself personally." He explained. I could never imagine spending so much money on vanity.
"We want to preserve magic Hermione. The more diluted it is, the weaker it is. Is that such a bad thing? I'm not thinking of what happens in five years, I'm thinking of what happens in a hundred, thousand even. You've read the books describing the power we used to have. We are a shadow of our former selves." He explained logically. I tried to think of a way he was wrong. Discredit his theory. Yell in his face that this wasn't the right way.
"I don't know why I put it on. I didn't want to." I said stunned at myself more than anything. I didn't want more knowledge or power, but Snapes magic had taken over. For a moment it was like I was possessed by him instead of his magic just living alongside mine. It was a terrifying loss of control.
“Lucius came to my rooms directly. Saw her. Got the idea to bring her. The Dark Lord has been bugging me to find a way to get to Potter. I’m in his good graces and she doesn’t die from Lucius at least.” I said emotionlessly.
“Your magic feels so dark. I can feel it.” I said confused still able to feel his magic swirling inside of me, aware of it in a way I had never been aware of my own.
She was too bright to lose to the dark side. I grabbed a book and threw it at her, roughly waking her up unceremoniously.
"Well, don't you think you can just give us some privacy?" He asked pointedly, obviously wanting me to put up a silencing charm. I shrugged trying not to look too suspicious.
"Of course I did. They are controlled by the Dark Lord primarily unfortunately. They had to arrest me or the papers would've had a field day, but reality wise they know they can't put me in Azkaban. They would be dead before I even got there." He explained his mood lightning very slightly, but still much darker than before.
“Any’on have an idea what this is?” He asked the crowd. The girls were cooing at baby bird excitedly and were hardly paying attention.
"No. I can't." He said pulling me in a bit more now that I had relaxed a bit. I wanted to be angry still, but my tension was leaving me fast feeling his calmness rubbing off on me.
"Peace? No. They are horrible people. Neither deserves to take power! Why can't we fight it and take them both down?" I asked angrily. He was quiet for a long moment.
It was perfect. I just hoped my suspicions were correct. I had spent years going through every corridor in the school and never saw anything of importance like the diadem, but I knew it had to be around here somewhere.
“Well, I had this dream. A very vivid dream. It was mainly blackness, but he was there. It was like…like I was in his mind or something. He seemed happy and that in itself was just weird. We were dancing and…” I trailed off since he had jumped up, grabbing his wand and rushing around me. I had to run to keep up.
"I have to go to the loo." I said softly to Snape who was so busy talking to Lucius and Antonin that he didn't even notice me leaving.
I reluctantly got up and took out my wand facing him, all eyes on us. He gave me an encouraging smile, but my anxiety had never been worse. The last time I was in a real duel was in the ministry of magic. I tried not to think about it, but the quick powered spells being thrown everywhere trying to kill me came back to mind.
"Not much else to say really." I said vaguely. Harry and Draco shared a look and I knew they were going to ask more questions so I got up.
A parliament without checks though was the reason this war started to begin with. The death eaters, Voldemort, all his supporters should have long ago been locked up. Instead they bribed and bought their way out of the most hideous of crimes. Umbridge was the perfect example of the corruption our system caused. She tormented children and yet was not ever held accountable even with explicit evidence.
"She wasn't a good person, but she was still my mom. One night on summer break when I was fourteen I was pulled into the Headmaster's office and told he killed her with a pan during one of their fights. I had tried to leave to kill him myself, but the headmaster pleaded with me to let the Dark Lord handle it. Allowing him to kill my father would fulfill my initiation requirements and would also leave me blameless so I could be apart of normal society." He confessed darkly, the memory of that night still troubling him. I couldn't imagine being placed in that position at such a young age. My heart went out to him for his loss and getting caught up before he could ever understand what was going on.
"Fine." I agreed reluctantly. He stood up happily oozing triumph and held out a hand to me. I didn't want to touch his pale stretched inhuman skin but I let him help me to my feet.
Hagrid tried to grab the bird back panicking, but the bird flew up and got caught in the wind. In a split second he was in my hands and the storm dissipated as fast as it started.
I was shaky from the cruciatis curse and my muscles were sore from tensing up so long, but I made it somehow. Looking around I finally found his cereal in the upper most cabinet. There was no way I could grab it with how short I was so I got up on the counter to grab it.
"DON'T LIE TO ME. I know when they are moved. You have been moving them!" He roared, dropping me to my knees, kicking me for emphasis. I had to think fast and figure out a way out of this. Unfortunately blood loss made that damn near impossible.
"I will speak with her." I said emotionlessly keeping my mask firmly in place so he wouldn't see my guilt at doing that to her.
"Hermione, I am a death eater. Yes I can be loving and protective, but I'm still a death eater. I have killed and have ordered people to be killed. Surely you don't think I will walk out of this war with clean hands? I'm fairly sure they will run out of space in my obituary to list all the people I killed." He reminded me crudely. He was right, I couldn't love the darkness that he tempted me with, but then judge him for that very same thing. He had never lied or hid who he was. I bit my lip nervously at the reality of who I was with hitting me for the first time.
The future of what I was about to do had flashed through my mind In a flash of blinding realization. I almost hit her. I almost made her hate me with an unforgivable act of violence that she didn't deserve.
"Hmmm...well of course not with your nose always in a book. If you marry rich you won't need all this studying and with your good looks you could easily catch a nice rich wizard." She told me wisely, nodding to herself at the idea. My mouth literally dropped open at her backwards comment realizing she was dead serious.
“I’m not here to judge. You know the age difference between Tonks and I…Clearly love doesn’t have boundaries.” He said thoughtfully. I spun on him quickly.
"Is something the matter Miss. Granger?" She asked in her thick accent, adjusting her spectacles to see me more clearly.
“Something? No. I felt everything. She’s going to wake up tomorrow and hate my guts and I will not be able to move on.” I explained staunchly knowing there was no way around it no matter how badly I fought it.
"If I may My Lord. She is generally more receptive to torture." Snape said stepping forward from the ranks. My anger turned towards him, seeing his cold expression watching Harry die.
That was not withstanding Severus's genetics. His child would be horribly conniving and his dark sense of humor would be intolerable to deal with.
"He bought you time. Until Christmas Eve. So prepare yourself. You'll have visitors." He advised quietly pausing for a moment while a professor passed by before we resumed our trek.
I felt my chest clinch at the thought. I didn’t have time to decide if my anxiety was because I had feelings or just a self-serving feeling since her death would come back negatively on me.
I felt like I would die with the pain. I kept waiting for him to end the curse, but it went on and on, the pain overwhelming my every nerve.
"My Lord, you will kill her." The voice cut across the pain and finally I was released and I could finally breathe. I gasped shaking and looked up hating him with every fiber of my being. Like Snape said, I had to act.
"Would never disobey me? Missing something Severus?" He sneered pointing at my chest that only had blood everywhere.
"Severus. We have to consider what people will say." He said pissing me off in one single statement.
He followed behind me quickly offering me a seat on his soft red sofa. He pulled up a kitchen chair so he was sitting directly across from me, sitting backwards on the chair and taking sips of my potion. His gaze was intense and I shifted uncomfortably.
"None. Some are pretty severely injured and still at St. Mungos, but Voldemort seemed unwilling to kill them and risk killing you before he was done with you, and your curse only seemed to affect certain people. It was out of control. Yet perfectly controlled." Harry explained grabbing some of the chocolates that were left on the table next to me. It was filled to the brim with gifts and candy.
"I can't believe she drank Harry's potion. She has some balls, that's for sure." Draco said with a slight smile, much more relaxed now that she wasn't dying.
What I was really interested in was healing though so I was debating asking Madame Pomfrey for an apprenticeship instead. Rather than bother with that, I hid out in the library and studied healing on my own just wanting to be alone.
"My Lord, I would never disobey you." I pleaded with him. He smirked evilly before ripping open my shirt with one swoop exposing my bare chest.
I felt like I was in a fog. It didn't seem real that in just a few moments we would battle the darkest wizard J had ever seen.
We were in the room of requirement quickly after that and I could take a deep breath sitting down on the large bean bag chairs Harry cojoured up for us. He always made the room warm and inviting much like a muggle bedroom, just with more snacks.
There was a long pause. I waited for my death. He had killed people for breathing too loudly. Surely he wouldn’t hold back if explicitly asked to kill someone. I chanced a glance up to see him staring at me angry…yet his wand hadn’t moved.
"You'll see." He said vaguely not to give me more than that. I bit my lip nervously but followed him obediently hoping I wasn't marching to my death.
I carefully measured each ingredient trying to make sure I got the measurement and timming perfectly right.
"What the fuck are you talking about? Will someone tell me what's going on" I asked my own anger flaring at her outburst.
"So has Snape said anything to you. I personally thought he would skin me alive." She said rummaging through my notes absently. My mind went back to us fucking.
“We will obliviate her before we bring her back. No harm done. She will assume it was just me if I’m the one who brought her back.” Malfoy Sr. reasoned thoughtfully. I thought Snape would argue more and come to my defense, but he just watched me darkly not moving or doing anything to indicate he cared at all.
When he appearated back at Hogwarts grounds I tried not to feel sad knowing we would have to go back to how things were, but I still hesitated at the gates biting my lip wondering if we had to go back already. Severus gave me a questioning look, but seemed to read my mind.
I normally didn’t allow that kind of touching since it would lead in directions that I wasn’t ready for, but something about how he was holding me made me stay. I felt safe, secure, like I could finally relax even if only just for a few hours and knew he would have my back. I drifted off so fast I didn’t have nearly enough time to savor the feeling as I sunk into dreamland.
Her light magic practically left from me reminding me of its presence. Of course I held some of her magic with me, but what could that do? I shook her trying desperately to wake her.
"Kill him." The Dark Lord hissed at me commanding me to do his bidding. I looked up at Dumbledore, horror building. This is what Snape had warned me the Dark Lord would command of me.
"The Dark Lord required you to bond with me. I assumed this would be a one way street." He explained. I scoffed at him.
“I think Voldemort had Snape bring me on purpose. I think the entire kidnapping was staged.” I admitted reluctantly. He stiffened at this.
"Chocolate of course. They like semi-sweet chocolate. Nothing too bitter of course." He advised clearly having taken much more thought into their desires than he let on.
“She is a task the Headmaster has assigned to me. That’s it. I don’t love her.” I said forcefully. He sighed, his aged features softening quite a bit.
“Levimus.” I called out hoping I didn’t hurt the little mouse who was now scattering around the container he was in.
“What? Lavender Brown said girls like when you take control.” Ron said confused why I pushed him away. I growled a bit backing up so he didn’t try it again.
“Great. Leave it on my desk.” Snape snapped pulling me back to him ready to finish what we started. He raised a hand to cast the spells around us again, but the headmaster stopped him.
"OW!" I moaned relieved he at least was alive. He pulled back realizing my pain instantly handing me a bottle of my own pain relieving potion.
"Thank you my Lord." I said when he was done, death evading me for one more day now. I had never regretted inventing that spell more than I did today.
“Of course not. I just wanted to stop in and see how things were going before our meeting. I know you have a lot on your plate trying to figure out why the Dark Lord can’t kill potter.” He said pouring Snape his own whisky. Snape took it gratefully and turned so that I couldn’t see Malfoy. My mind turned processing what he said. So Harry WASN’T killable?
As the students filed out I waited for him to drop dead, start foaming from the mouth, anything that would show his poisoning, but he seemed to be fine and his mood less intense. Was it possible my potion had ACTUALLY worked?
"Its not love. That's for sure. I'm pretty sure he was plotting my death and that's what the intensity was for." I said softly not entirely convinced that was what it was.
“I knew they weren’t done with me. Why won’t anyone tell me what his plans are since they clearly involve me.” I said a bit annoyed at being left out again.
"That too was his plan. Force me to cross that line he knew I would never cross. He knew I wouldn't be a bastard like the other guys and that would only spur her to bond faster." I said finally seeing the brilliance of his plan. It was a beautiful plan. The headmaster shook his head slowly thinking over the details also.
"That's just for me to know. You can't judge too harshly anyways. You've been playing with time quite a bit anyways yourself." He admonished me playfully. I wanted desperately to know his actual age, but didn't push things. I had used the time turner so much the ministry of magic had recorded my age as nineteen. Most of the extra time was spent studying which wasn't an approved use of the time turner. The headmaster thought I had returned mine in third year, but I had kept it just in case, and used it more than what I should have.
“Dobby is happy free, but not all elves want to be free Misses. Just like you don’t want to be free of Professor Snape.” I choked on my food a bit taken aback by his assessment.
“I hardly think you saw my inner most desires Granger. You just saw a fireplace and yourself.” I said with a sarcastic grin folding my arms triumphantly.
I took the cloak off when I got a few feet from him and he instantly spun around with his wand out and a curse on the tip of his tongue.
I stumbled to my feet, but I didn't stay there long. He hit me with a sectumsempra, my skin ripping open horrifically. I immediately started bleeding out, but he grabbed me by my collar, his snake-like face inches from my own.
“Eh…I guess. Don’t go causing no trouble though.” Hagrid said rubbing his beard nervously before waving us off.
"Indeed. What do you want this time?" I asked, meeting his disapproving glare with one of my own. He smiled evilly taking pleasure in my defiance.
I tried to see him as soon as I got back but he wasn't there so I had to wait until the next morning much to my annoyance.
My arm burned and I quickly left her needing to get away before she realized. I couldn't let something so bright and full of life be burned by something so dark and evil.
"Everything was planned. He's been five steps ahead this whole time." I said turning to the Headmaster smiling sarcastically.
Maybe it was the wine, or whatever it was spiked with, but I felt a sharp stab of guilt for having ignored him for weeks. He had opened up to me sharing a personal detail that he clearly hadn't shared with anyone else and I just walked away. I was horrid.
“I’m here alone because…I’m here, aren’t I? No boy wants a bookworm.” I said amused at her ridiculousness.
“So you think I’ve bonded with him?” I asked unaware witches could actually bond with a wizard. He would be pissed when he realized this. If it was one thing he wanted, it was control, so for me to have bonded with him without his consent, it wouldn’t go down well with him.
"What was that Hermione? He is pissed. Very, very pissed." Harry said shaking a bit. I helped him back up, urgency picking up now that he knew we destroyed the horcruxes.
"She woke up in hysterics. I had to put several calming spells on her. I think she might need a psychiatric evaluation, she's been through a lot Albus." Madame Pomfrey said worriedly as if I wasn't there. The Headmaster gazed at me deeply as if reading me.
I got her quickly to the hospital wing knowing this wouldn't look good for me at all, but knowing she needed healing to prevent frostbite from settling in.
I started to come around feeling weak but at least well rested. My body was desperate for some food after being starved for entirely too long. I opened my eyes and to my surprise I wasn't in my bed. Snape was sleeping at the end of the couch, his head on his chest looking quite powerful even asleep.
"Screw Dumbledore. Screw the Dark Lord. We are much better people than they are. Let's stop doing what they want and do what we want." She said closing what little distance we had between us. The innocent way she looked up at me, I knew she had no idea how dangerous it was to tempt me.
"Who else would we have to correct Professor Binns on the war of 1103 between the goblins and witches?" She asked me relaxing.
“NO.” The words escaped from my mouth before I could catch myself. My head shot up and I realized a second too late he had been testing me. His smile was dark and sinister.
He was panting, catching his breath and slightly sweaty between our activities and the heating charm. He looked at me wearing nothing on with even more desire, but as he came down from his high I could see he was troubled.
My anger from earlier seemed so foolish feeling her lifeless form in my arms. I had just wanted an excuse to give her detention, not to have her killed.
She was dressed up in a white light dress that went to her knees and fit her curves perfectly with a gold belt around the middle. Her hair was down, but she had a crown of small pink and purple flowers on her head like a tiara. She looked like a goddess to me.
"Yes, well I'm not the person you want to sneak up on." He said annoyed slightly turning back to the lake watching the waters calmly lap on the shore. I watched for a few moments with him surprised by how calm he seemed.
“Not really. All the spells I know are targeted for just one person. I need something that would take out a whole group of people.” I said with a sigh getting up to go to our dormitory.
I could feel her fear surface the moment I touched the memory, her breathing went from relaxed to sharp and panicked. I could see Lupin throwing the spell at her and then a rise of her panic remembering the battle at the ministry of magic. She had PTSD. The memory went grey as soon as the spell was fired and all emotion vanished.
"It's a horcrux." I said dropping the pocket watch to the table, the dark magic overpowering even just to touch for a few moments. He laughed at this and went back to his cooking.
"Oh, it won't hurt one bit. I will take things slow." He said with a wicked smile running his hand up my dress.
“I saved him from the wind. That’s all.” I explained. Draco didn’t look convinced but brushed it off.
"No. I almost got him fired and his only comment was you need to talk to Miss. Granger, she needs friends right now, not enemy's. I think he's not quite as bad as everyone assumes." She explained, her close call with death by his hands apparently changing her perception.
“Hermione.” He gasped taking in a shaky breath before collapsing to his knees. I was to his side in a slip second not caring what anyone thought if they were out at night. I threw my arms around him hugging him tightly so relieved he was okay I felt I might burst. He chuckled returning the hug gingerly.
"Oh, I'm sorry, but CLEARLY you wanted it. Right?" I asked him smirking at the dumbfounded look on his face. I slammed my book shut and stomped off not caring if I got points docked or not. He had no idea what I was going through, how confusing this all was. Who was he to mock me asking if I wanted to be put in the position of dying or doing whatever Voldemort wanted?
“Dobby, I’m fine! I promise.” I said reluctant to bug them, but the moment I entered the kitchen with the amazing smelling food that they cooked my hunger came out full force.
"Have you lost your mind? Do you realize what would have happened if I didn't find you? You foolish insufferable idiot!" He yelled loudly, his voice echoing off the walls and marble.
"Hermione? Why did you put that on! Are you mental?" Draco yelled, taking it from me as shocked as I was.
It hadn't been a playful slap, I had been so angry I couldn't stop myself. The moment I hit her I felt regret, but she was gone in a split second.
Somehow his mood had changed and I was sure he would regret all the alcohol he drank and his actions in the morning.
“You know, she’s quite brilliant. I don’t know why you hate her so much. She’s come to me crying over some of the horrid things you say to her.” Minerva said disapprovingly, tisking at me.
“Granger, you have to control the magic. In a way magic is much more alive than you or I. It needs to be tamed though, and you are its master.” He said quietly. I didn’t have time to respond.
"Yes what you failed to realize all this time was he was never loyal to you. Or even Dumbledore. He was loyal only ever to himself...and then me even though I didn't deserve it. He sacrificed everything to try to make the world a better place even as the world hated him." I said passionately getting off the floor grabbing my wand all trace of the loss I felt left. All I had remaining was anger and a burning desire for revenge.
I trekked down to the lake under the invisibility cloak I had borrowed from Harry trying not to get caught. I could only imagine how it would look to be caught meeting up with a professor after curfew, but luckily I saw no one on my trip down.
"What's the most profitable potion?" I asked curiously. He was thoughtful and contemplated my question.
I waited until break started and snuck out after curfew using Harry's cloak wandering the halls trying to find some room that hadn't been explored. It was boring, tedious work.
I gasped and he took advantage, kissing me deeply, his body pressed against mine. I knew I couldn't have gotten him off me if I tried, but I didn't want to either. He was addicting and I wanted more than just kissing. All rationality had gone out the window and my mind was ready to go all the way.
“Don’t be ridiculous Ronald.” I said trying to leave. He grabbed my arm forcing me to stay. If he wasn’t my friend I would have hexed him to next year that moment.
The students had mainly gone home for the holidays, but my family was doing a mission in Uganda so I had nothing to do but stay here. Since becoming a witch we had slowly drifted apart as our worlds became less and less similar. They didn't want me to stay when they found out about Voldemort, but I knew I had to stay. This was the only place I felt at home. Not to mention, it would put them in danger for me to be with them. I could leave, but we would be found.
