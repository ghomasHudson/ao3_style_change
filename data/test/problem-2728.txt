Before Draco could think any more on the subject, a house elf popped into the bedroom and bowed politely.  “Master,” he addressed Blaise.  “Miss Ginevra Weasley has arrived with friends Mr. Harry Potter and Mr. Neville Longbottom, sir.”
“Um, yes.  But so does Hermione.  Lives here, I mean,” His smile turned nervous.  “She’s not here now though.  On holiday with her parents.  And um, I told Ron not to come over tonight.  That I had company over and that I’d see him tomorrow...”
“Could you keep it down?” Draco hissed, slinking down further into his chair across from Pansy.  “I think they heard you across the pond.”
“Did you like it?”  He continued with that same troublesome smile, having no idea the effect he had on Draco.
“Sounds like my 5th year,” he laughed.  “Was it with Pansy?”
He stared at the card for what felt like ages.  His eyes reading the words over and over again.  There was no way this was actually happening.  But when Draco tried to pinch himself, he realized he was really awake and not dreaming.  The card in his hands was real, and of course the horrible script was Potter’s.  Draco memorized the look of his awful handwriting back in 3rd year.  There was no other person that wrote like him, as far as Draco knew.
This snapped Harry out of it and he stood up abruptly.  No way was that tosser going to come just yet, Harry hadn’t even fucked him!  He wrapped an arm around his waist, effectively pulling the other man up even more, so his arse was perched at the perfect angle.  Not waiting another moment more, Harry gripped his leaking cock and drove on home.
“Right,” he smiled once more.  Why was Blaise Zabini so fucking attractive?  Draco tried to not stare too closely at his perfectly refined jawline, or those tempting lips.  They’d briefly had a thing at Hogwarts, but it was purely physical.  He had too many love interests, and Draco was a jealous person.  It never would have worked out.
“Really?”  Draco frowned, “I thought Ginevra and Potter...”
“Pansy!”  Draco wailed.  Blaise was no help either, and he started giggling hysterically.
He held up his hand, “Please, that won’t be necessary.”  He absolutely didn’t want her intervention.  Less attention drawn to him, the better.  The only way he could get out of this program in one piece would be for him to stay in line, keep his head down.  He didn’t need her stirring up trouble.
“I’m sure if you were to ask Parvati,” he continued on, lifting their joined hands, “she’d have told you I was the worst dancer to ever partner with her.”  Draco would have laughed at that, if he weren’t so lost in what was happening.  “But I can assure you,” he leaned closer, resting his cheek against Draco’s as he whispered into his ear, “I have learned a lot since the Yule Ball.”
Seamus sighed, walking over to him and giving him a small hug.  “Of course.  You’re our friend now.  Pansy can have one too, since she’s a friend of yours.  Plus, well, we heard about you and Neville.”  He winked over at her and Draco frowned.
“Wow,” Harry breathed out for both of them.  His gaze was heated as he took in all of Draco, and his mouth fell open of its own accord.  He couldn’t seem to keep his own gawking in check, and normally Draco would have found that highly amusing.  But Harry Potter looked fancy and delectable and Draco was having a hard time thinking anything else.
,” he quickly corrected.  His mind was still blank.
“Draco...” Pansy reached for him, wrapping her arm around him and rubbing small circles along his back.  “It’s fine, darling.  You have nothing to worry about...”
It was as if he was on autopilot.  Draco reached blindly into his wallet and pulled out plenty of that Muggle paper money and set it on the table.  Then he stood up, Harry mirroring his actions.  Draco didn’t hesitate, and as they were walking out of there, he put his hand on Harry’s back.  Immediately Harry leaned into his touch, and Draco resisted the urge to grab the back of his shirt and pull him close.
Draco watched the clock closely above the fireplace.  Harry had told him to wait by the Floo and he’d come to get him around 6.  As each minute drew near, Draco grew more nervous.  He still had another ten minutes so he needed to focus on something else.  He reached for the Prophet Dean had left on the coffee table.  Staring blankly at the photo of the front of Gringotts, the words barely made any sense.  Apparently, there was another attempt at a break in—but they proved to be unsuccessful.  Nothing new there.  Harry was the only one that could steal something from there and live to tell the tale.
While Draco was distracted with their kissing, Harry brought his hand to Draco’s cock and began to stroke him slowly.  Draco gasped against his mouth.  Harry grinned, picking up the pace and relishing in the feeling of Draco filling in his grip.  “You feel so good,” Harry muttered along his lips, shaking to keep from pushing that much deeper in Draco.
.  If that makes any sense.”
“We’ll be right here with you if things go awry,” Pansy leaned in, kissing his cheek.  “We are happy for you and Harry.  It’s going to be fine, love.  You have nothing to worry about.”
Harry shut his eyes for a moment, almost in disbelief.  When he opened them again, Draco was looking at him with renewed determination.  It’d been so long since Harry had seen that look on Draco, it took him a little off guard.  His lips broke out into an unexpected grin.  “Right,” he chuckled.  Reaching over into the bedside dresser, he pulled out a vial of lube.  “This might take some time...but I don’t want to hurt you.”
He had to close his eyes.  It was absolute torture.  But eventually Harry began to take him deep and Draco had nothing else to think of but the tight heat of Harry’s mouth wrapped around him.  He started out slow and steady, the pressure almost too much.  He could feel his body strung tight and clenching, trying to hold it all back.  There’d be no way Harry wouldn’t take the piss if Draco finished so quickly.  Draco shouldn‘t have been surprised.  It was just another of Harry’s many talents.  Who knew the boy who lived was a natural cocksucker?  Draco tried not to let the jealous thoughts come forward.  But he was naturally curious as to whom he’d been practicing on.  Clearly this wasn’t his first time.
“Well I wasn’t going to just barge into his room!  I was hoping to catch him out here,” Draco frowned, considering.  What if Potter didn’t even come out of his room till he was leaving?  Draco might have to actually knock on his room, and his stomach lurched at that idea.  The last time he was in that room—ugh, Draco wanted to think about it, but he also didn’t.
“So how
“Bye Draco!” Seamus called cheekily before they slammed their bedroom door shut.
To Draco’s horror, Dean and Seamus started to look around the kitchen and surrounding living room for a comparison.  “Guys, stop,” he pleaded as Dean held up various kitchen utensils, considering.  This was so embarrassing.
This seemed to spur Harry into action because he slipped an arm around Draco’s waist and held him in place.  “You’re such a fucking prat,” moaned Harry, his lips parting to finally seal around the tip.  Immediately, Draco wanted to press forward and he whined when Harry’s fingers dug into his waist and held him firmly in place.  He pulled off on a loud pop, the noise so obscene in the living room.  “I’ll let you fuck my face another time, but for now I’m setting the pace.  Buckle up, Malfoy, you’re at my mercy.”  He grinned slyly, licking along Draco’s entire length.  Draco had never seen anything so fucking hot in his whole life.
“That’s my boy,” she replies, patting him on the arm. “Would you mind calling Arthur in? Everyone else should be arriving at any second. I think he’s just in the back there.”
Harry shrugs. “Didn’t know there was one.”
She rolls her eyes and bends down to pull on a pair of socks. “Keep this up and you won’t be. Ready to go? By the way, Blaise and some of his friends are meeting us there. I hope you don’t mind.”
Harry stands at the entrance to Malfoy’s flat, mouth agape. He was not making it out to be much worse than it is. Malfoy’s home is a terror. It goes against everything Harry’s ever known about him.
“Top left drawer,” he calls, going straight to the sofa and pulling out the different cartons. Harry sets everything on the floor, deciding that eating at the table isn’t worth the effort. Luna rejoins him with two tall glasses of water as well and hands one over. They eat in silence for a while, just enjoying the meal. Harry’s not in the mood to talk and Luna is never one to force anything out of him, always happy to just sit in silence. Sort of like Malfoy, he thinks, and then promptly pushes the thought out of his head.
“Ronald, I absolutely
His flat was…Wait.” He stops, frowning. “Nothing rhymes with Malfoy, you know.”
love what it loves.
He can see Malfoy trying not to smile, but it doesn’t work and the sides of his mouth curve upward against his will. “You’re a horror, Potter,” he says, sounding a bit fond. “Do you want to hear more poetry?”
“Yes, how generous of you,” Harry replies. “You had no problem calling me a thumb.”
“Don’t test me,” Malfoy warns, half-joking. “My patience with that man is growing very thin.” He eyes Harry, as if trying to determine whether or not to actually send Blaise to him. “Whatever happened to your arms?”
Ginny blows on her tea before taking a sip. “Yeah. She doesn’t want me to break up with him for her. But I’m not -- I’m breaking up with him for me, you know?”
“Right? Like we’re so stuck in the past with all the pureblood vs. Muggle-born shit, we haven’t even thought about other injustices going on. I think we’re making progress, though,” Seamus replies. “Things have really changed for the better in the past year. I thought the Slytherins were gonna get it real bad after the war, but I haven’t heard of people treating them any worse.”
“Dear Merlin.” Harry sinks onto the sofa, not quite prepared to deal with this. “Okay, walk me through this. Why?”
“Me too,” admits Malfoy. “I wasn’t sure both the stir fry and I were going to survive the trip from the kitchen to the table.”
Malfoy trails off. “I couldn’t think of a last line. Or I could, but it was too mean.”
After the better part of an hour spent saying hi to everyone and catching up, Harry finds a moment of reprieve in the kitchen. His head is beginning to ache from the loud music and nonstop conversation. He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes, but finding it doesn’t do much of anything, decides to step out and get some fresh air.
“They’re nice,” agrees Harry.
“Merlin, Ginny, way to warn a man!” Smiling, Harry sets down his mug and attempts to mop up the wet patch on his jeans with his blanket. “What can I do for you this fine evening?”
“What’s up?” he asks, standing over her.
“Come on.” Harry nudges him. “What else are you gonna be doing? It’ll be fun. You can read me some poems.” He gestures to the book he’s clutching.
Harry laughs. “Believe me, I know. That’s why I didn’t do them. Studying was even a struggle for Hermione, which is saying something.”
Catching a glimpse of the title, Harry can see that it’s
Malfoy gulps. Harry can tell that he’s thinking about their fight in the bathroom -- he is too, remembering Malfoy’s ear splitting scream, pale face, blood on the tile of the bathroom floor -- oh god, he thinks he’s going to be sick.
Harry is reading on the couch in the living room of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, when suddenly a head appears in his fireplace.
by Mary Oliver.
“Yes,” Seamus agrees, taking his hand. “Bar.”
“Come in,” he says, opening the door wider to invite her in. He hugs her tightly. “Thanks, Luna. Glad you came by.”
Blaise, Malfoy, and Pansy are already sitting at a booth when Harry and Ginny arrive. Harry takes one look at them laughing at some inside joke and stops at the front of the room, refusing to go further. “Ginny!” Harry hisses. “I did not sign up for this.”
“I need your advice about something and I don’t want Ron to know yet because he’ll judge me,” she replies.
Malfoy clears his throat, examines his hands. “Haven’t the foggiest.”
Ginny wrinkles her nose, thinking about this for a few minutes. Harry lets her contemplate in silence and stares into space, mind full of thoughts. “Okay, actually, I changed my mind,” she says. “I do want to be in a monogamous relationship, just not with him.”
Harry nods. “Probably should.”
She swats at him. “No, you dummy, I didn’t want to make you wait for me while I showered. Side-along?”
He nods and steps into the Floo, longing for a hot shower and his bed.
Malfoy watches him. “Be right back.”
He nods. “Blaise seems really great, I’m happy for you two.”
“Seriously, Gin, I don’t want to be here,” he pleads. “I thought it was going to be just us tonight.”
Harry smiles at him before turning away to cheer with the rest of the crowd. Luna drops back to talk to them until the procession ends at Trafalgar Square.
He knows he’s being ridiculous. Ginny’s one of his best friends and they spend loads of time together, plus she makes it very clear when she dislikes someone. They tell each other literally everything. He shakes his head, heading into the bathroom to take a cold shower. Maybe he shouldn’t smoke with Malfoy anymore.
She sniffs, tugging on a pair of black boots. “Not when it comes to Malfoy.”
“He has been, hasn’t he?” Hermione agrees. “So are you guys friends now?”
Astoria smiles. She’s beautiful, Harry will admit, but also terrifying even in a tank top and jeans. With her blonde hair pulled back into a sleek bun, she’s the epitome of wealth and class. “Went to get some water,” she replies. “Come sit! Good to see you all.”
isn’t a good idea, but he doesn’t care right now. It’s three in the afternoon and he’s got nothing better to do than make a couple bad decisions — and really, he’s done much stupider things in his life. “Sure,” he agrees.
Malfoy looks down, as if he’s just realizing what he’s doing. “No, not really. I found some of them in different shops over the years and some of them are family heirlooms. I just like wearing them.”
After a bit of wandering around, Luna spots Malfoy and Astoria sitting on a blanket under a tree. They look up as Harry and his friends approach, scooting over on the blanket to make room.
“Er, does Luna feel the same way?” Harry asks tentatively. “Like, does she know this is something you’re thinking about?”
They make it to a grungy diner where they have to split into two separate tables because there’s too many of them to fit at one. Harry sits between Ron and Malfoy, across from Hermione and Luna. The waitress hands them a couple menus and places five glasses of water on the table.
“All yours,” he says, gesturing to the bike.
Hermione sits down next to him and they begin discussing something Potions-related. Harry tries to keep up with their conversation for a few minutes but finding it impossible to follow, he tunes them out and begins talking with Luna and Astoria instead about psychics. Pansy has returned with three bottles of water, one of which she hands to Astoria before shrinking the other two and shoving them at Malfoy to put in his pocket. She pulls Astoria into her lap and they share a brief kiss before continuing the conversation.
He rolls his eyes. “I take it back, you’re a git.”
It’s easier talking about these things with Luna for some reason. “It does help,” he admits, a welcome change from his usual tendency to bottle up all his feelings. “I ran into Malfoy this morning, he said he was going to therapy. And that I should try it. He was being sarcastic of course, but it’s not a half-bad idea.”
Harry lets out a bitter chuckle. “Yeah, right. Did I mention that time I accidentally released a snake from the zoo?”
“I just think what they have to say is too general and can be applied to anyone,” Astoria says. “They don’t have real magic, they’re just Muggles pretending.”
It’s almost midnight, they’ve spent over twelve hours together today. Malfoy stands as well, rubbing his eyes. “This was nice,” he says. “I’m never getting on your fucking motorcycle again, though.”
“Sometimes talking about it helps,” she says gently.
Luna takes a bite of paneer and chews thoughtfully, examining Harry. “I thought I’d check in with you today,” she says. “I always feel horrible after big social gatherings. Like I’ve done something wrong, somehow. I can’t stop overanalyzing all the interactions I’ve had with people.”
“Are you going to the evening festival after this?” he asks.
He spends a bit of time after she leaves puttering around his flat and cleaning the kitchen, not that there’s much to clean. His apartment is still extremely bare, but Harry’s excited to begin filling his shelves with the books he’d bought earlier. He decides to start one of them,
“How do you know so much about
That night he apparates to Ron and Hermione’s flat for dinner, uninvited but knowing he will be welcome anyway. The pair are sitting on the couch drinking wine and greet Harry when he appears in the middle of the room.
“Harry,” he exclaims, gripping Harry’s arm tightly. His chest clenches in fear. “We forgot the hash browns.”
He shrugs, uncomfortable with the compliment. “Thanks, ‘Mione.”
“Hello!” Ginny greets them brightly. “Happy Pride! Where’s Pansy?”
“Didn’t know you were a poetry fan,” Harry comments. “She’s brilliant.”
“You have a point.” Harry accepts the blunt from him and after taking the final hit, grinds it out on the railing. He coughs. “Er, where’d you get this from, by the way?”
“Muggle money,” Harry explains.
Arthur emerges and wipes his brow, leaving a smear of dark grease across his forehead. “Harry! Why yes indeed! I think there was nothing wrong with it in the first place, actually, and it just needed…what do they call it…petrol? Yes. But I wanted to get a good look before I handed it off to you.”
Harry swallows, his mouth suddenly dry. “Merlin, Arthur. I--thank you. Wow.”
“A painting!” he gasps. “Not a chance. Although, I will admit there is one of my grandfather hanging in the dining room.”
Breakfast in hand, he turns to look for a table. Out of the corner of his eye Harry spots a head of blond hair sitting in a window seat at the end of the café.
“I’m tired,” Ginny complains, propping her feet up on a chair. She, Ron, Hermione, and Harry are sitting at a booth in the back of the club, sipping on water after many hours of drinking nothing but alcohol. “How do they
Harry opts to sit on the grass, not wanting to take up unneeded space. He nods at Malfoy, who’s wearing a tight black t-shirt tucked into a pair of elegant olive-green slacks. He’s got on his rings as well, along with slim black boots that look extremely expensive and circular sunglasses with lenses so dark Harry can’t see his eyes.
She rolls her eyes. “Why am I the decider of these things? Yes, we can get milkshakes and waffles. Go tell the others that we’re leaving.”
“It wasn’t just me,” Harry mumbles. “Dozens of people helped. All the professors, and everything…”
The first night in the flat, all of Harry’s friends invite themselves over for a housewarming party. It was supposed to be a casual thing, Ginny had said she’d just mention it to a few people, but Neville arrives first with Hannah Abbott and it’s just dominoes from there. Seamus and Dean come next, enthusiastically greeting Harry and saying it’d been much too long since they’d last gotten together. Luna appears with Ron and Hermione, and then Ginny, Blaise, Pansy and Malfoy step out of the floo. Harry inwardly groans. As much as he loves his friends, this was turning into a much bigger event than expected. Even George and Angelina show; Harry is delighted that they’ve brought prototypes from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes for everyone to test out. Sure, there might be some scorch marks on the ceiling the next day, but it would be worth it.
“Er—” Harry fidgets. He’s always found it a bit uncomfortable when people praise him or thank him, and Ginny is no exception. Not sure how to respond, he instead changes the subject. “Are you hungry? Can we watch the Bake Off and order takeaway?”
“Ah, so your grandfather was the family member full of sin and corruption,” Harry says wisely.

Harry exchanges a look with his best friends. “Might as well.”
“Balcony?” he asks. “Or in here? My neighbors don’t care,” he explains, seeing Harry’s expression.
They step outside and Harry watches Malfoy as he lights the joint, lips around the filter, brow furrowed as he flicks the lighter. After taking a hit he passes it to Harry, who inhales and immediately starts coughing.
Malfoy shows him the cover of his book --
‘Dancing Queen’ ends and ‘SOS’ immediately starts playing, and of course the dancing has to continue. Harry sings until his voice grows hoarse and he’s out of breath, when Dean lowers the music and they take the party to the living room. The living room is decked out with rainbow flags and two protest signs lean against the wall in the corner, which Harry is glad to see. He sinks onto the couch between Ginny and Seamus and starts on his second drink. Ginny’s brought a pitcher of margaritas, and they spend the early afternoon day-drinking and enjoying each other’s company, listening to old music and making stupid jokes.
“What’s this about McGonagall?” Ron comes up behind them and interrupts the conversation, slinging one arm around Harry and the other around Hermione.
to acknowledge the awful things I’ve done to grow from them.”
said I would become an old ugly bat!” Malfoy retorts. “As if. Malfoys age very gracefully, I’ll have you know.” At this, Harry bursts out laughing. “What is it?” he snaps.
“Yeah.”
Harry blinks, suddenly feeling a bit overwhelmed. “Er. Wow. Thank you.”
“Oi! Over here!” Seamus calls from by the door, interrupting Harry’s train of thought. He’s standing beside Luna, Ginny, and Dean. Harry is correct in that he has more plans for the group and soon they find themselves at another bar, and when that one gets boring they are off to another.
Malfoy ignores him and continues. “All I’m saying is that now that Blaise and Ginny are together, I’m sure we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other and I would rather avoid arguing every time, if it’s all the same to you.”
Luna hums her approval. “Oh, that would look very nice on him.”
have energy? It’s like nine o’clock. Can we get food?”
Harry meets Ginny after her quidditch practice the next day. They haven’t caught up in a couple weeks, and have decided to go for happy hour drinks. Not long after Harry arrives at the pitch, Ginny walks up to him, her ginger hair in a ponytail, face red from the exercise and heat of the day.
His shower is considerably shorter than Malfoy’s was, and he spends the whole time thinking about what to cook for dinner. After rummaging around in the fridge, he decided to whip up a stir fry and proceeds to spend the rest of the evening chopping vegetables, making rice, and finishing the rest of the bottle of wine with Malfoy. He’s on his way to being sufficiently drunk by the time the stir fry is finished.
Harry rests his cheek on the top of her head, her hair tickling his face. “Not sure about nice, but honestly, they’re not bad. I could use another drink, though.”
, he writes, smiling to himself. She always loves to be right.
. Somehow, he finds the fact that Malfoy’s reading a Muggle book stranger than the fact that he’s queer. Harry shrugs. “I’ve been focusing on other things. Dorian Gray, really? Don’t you find that a bit on the nose, considering?”
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
They toast, and Harry throws back the rest of his drink, expecting that they’ll be leaving soon for the march. He’s correct, and everyone scurries around the apartment, gathering up their things for the march. Ever prepared, Hermione has several bottles of water and granola bars in her charmed backpack. Seamus and Dean grab their signs, one of which says “The first pride was a riot” and the other reads “Love is a human right”. Luna comes up to Harry and sticks a pride flag into his pocket and fastens a rainbow pin to his shirt.
“Nice outfit,” Dean grins, slapping Harry on the back. Seamus and Dean are wearing matching rainbow shirts and look every bit like regular Muggles going to a pride parade.
Eventually the morning slips away and Harry changes into more appropriate flying gear, grabs his broom, and heads down to the park. Malfoy is already there, sitting on a bench and reading a book as he waits. He looks up and gives Harry a small smile as he approaches, closing his book and tucking it into his robes.
He is very mean
Harry protests. “Wait, wait, I can’t make one up off of the top of my head. Do you have a pen?” Malfoy stares at him. “A quill?”
Malfoy makes a face but says nothing.
“Well Ronald, you did miss all the dancing,” Ginny tells him. “But don’t worry, there’ll be more.”
nose piercings, oscar wilde references, good friends
“What a relief,” he sighs. “I don’t think I could have lived if there was no dancing for the rest of the day.”

Dinner itself is uneventful. More people than usual show up, including Percy and his fiance, Penelope. Percy has mellowed out a bit over the last year but he’s always been slightly insufferable, so Harry and Ron assign themselves seats at the other end of the table.
“I mean. Yes. I just wanted you to tell me if I was being stupid and talk me out of it,” she replies. “But you haven’t done that, so.”
Malfoy finishes the poem and reaches for Harry’s glass of water. Harry passes it to him silently, still absorbing Mary Oliver’s words. They sit for a minute, quietly reveling in her genius, before Malfoy turns over to lie on his back and look at the ceiling, just as Harry is doing.
Malfoy snorts. “Not everything is about you, you know. I came over here because Ginny and Blaise were being overly adorable and Pansy was being annoying. That woman, honestly.”
listen, when i began this fic i did not intend to make this many references to classic literature. it just happened. thank u for reading! hope u enjoy!
He really was dumb
“You wouldn’t dare.”
“Fuck!” Harry says. His sentiments are echoed by Malfoy behind him.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clear blue air,
?” Malfoy asks warily. “You’re not secretly some superfan, are you?”
“Oh, er, thanks.” He coughs. “It wasn’t all me, though. Just helped out a bit.”
Five days later, Ginny and Luna are officially dating and Harry has learned to ride his motorcycle, collected an abundance of new bruises, and runs into Malfoy at the cafe-bookshop. Malfoy’s drinking iced coffee and reading
“For what it’s worth, I’m sorry about that,” says Malfoy, glancing at Harry. Harry’s a bit surprised at the shift in conversation, the sincerity in his tone. “I don’t think I’ve ever apologized. It was a really shitty thing to do.”
“Fascinating as this conversation is,” Pansy interrupts, “I think the march is starting. Oi, Draco!” He looks up. “Time to go!” They all climb to their feet, sweating already in the summer heat, and join the crowd of people heading towards Piccadilly.
After a cold shower, Harry still feels bored. He wants to do something, go somewhere that’s not part of his usual routine. He has all this pent up energy that needs to go somewhere, and Arthur still has his motorcycle so a drive is out of the question, not that Harry knows how to ride a motorcycle anyway. Casting around for something to do, he’s suddenly struck with the urge to play Quidditch. Now that Ginny’s playing for the Harpies, Harry’s been thinking about Quidditch more than he used to, and anyway he misses his old hobbies from Hogwarts, when he would do things just for the fun of it. Harry has no idea what he enjoys anymore, and thinks Quidditch might be a good place to start. Problem is, there’s no one around for a quick game. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are all at their respective jobs, and Harry doesn’t think either Luna or Neville will be up for it. He supposes he could give Seamus and Dean a call, but doesn’t feel like they’re the ideal Quidditch companions. And they’re not all that close.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Ginny makes a face. “I asked if he wanted to come but he’s visiting his mum this weekend. He was so uncomfortable when I brought it up, though.” She giggles. “He was like, ‘am I allowed to come if I’m straight?’ and I was like, ‘well, I’m queer and I say you can come, so yes’ and he just got very flustered. He’s cute.”
“Sorry mate,” Harry says to Ron sympathetically. “Hermione’s won this one.” Ron grumbles as he pushes himself off the couch and heads into the kitchen, but Harry can tell he doesn’t really mind. He pours himself a good helping of their wine, helps set the table, and begins to daydream about what his new flat will look like. He’s thinking somewhere close to Ron and Hermione and Ginny, somewhere with lots of windows and a big fireplace and absolutely no screaming portraits.
They lapse into silence again, something Harry is more than happy to do. Everyone always expects something out of him, but not Malfoy. With Malfoy, he can just sit in peace and enjoy the fresh night air, left to his own thoughts. It’s interesting, really, how he used to care so much about everything Malfoy did, how Harry would work himself up, convinced that he was always up to something. After the war, somehow he forgot that the Slytherin was ever such a prominent figure in his life. He had other things to worry about, or perhaps this was the first time in his life where he hadn’t had to worry. But, sitting quietly on the balcony, Harry doesn’t know how he could have ever forgotten. Except now Malfoy’s presence is refreshing rather than irritating. He seems perfectly content to enjoy Harry’s company without exchanging a word.
“Good grief, Potter!” cries Malfoy as he merges sharply into the left lane, rudely cutting off the car behind him and receiving a nasty honk.
Harry shrugs. “Dunno. His name’s Adam, just some random Muggle I guess. Are we leaving soon?”
“Where to now?” Ginny asks. “My place isn’t too far, we could easily walk there and watch a movie or something.”
“Who was that?” teases Hermione, raising an eyebrow. “He was cute.”
The kettle whistles, and Harry pours two cups of tea, milk and honey for Ginny, milk and sugar for himself.
“It can’t be that bad,” he responds, already beginning to head out of the park. Malfoy hurries to catch up with him. “Is it far from here? Pansy mentioned you didn’t live too far from that bookstore we both like.”
Harry’s forgotten that same-sex marriage is still illegal in 1999. “LGBT people also experience extremely high rates of homelessness, so corporatizing Pride is just making it inaccessible to actual members of the community,” he adds.
Malfoy smirks, leaning forward and pulling up beside him. “You’re on, Potter.”
Malfoy shrugs. “Don’t apologize to me, it’s your roof.” He has a fair point, and so Harry makes his way towards him.
“You fell off your broom!” argues Malfoy.
Eventually Malfoy’s voice grows tired and he sets down
He sends it off with his owl, Esmerelda. She’s a gorgeous, if not a bit temperamental barn owl that he’d received earlier that year from Andromeda Tonks and he’d felt like he couldn’t refuse her generous gift. Esmerelda hoots once before flying out of the window to deliver his letter. While he waits for a reply, Harry makes his bed, starts a load of laundry, and sweeps his entire flat. It’s habit really; Harry finds he’s incapable of doing anything unless his space is organized. When he doesn’t know what to do he just...cleans. What else is there to do?
Malfoy shrugs. “I’m not sure. Something beautiful, I guess.”
poetry, smoking but on a balcony this time, boys are gonna get hurt from all the eye rolling they do
“Are you sure you don’t want to come to the ball?” She frowns. “You spent all that time and effort in helping rebuild Hogwarts, and you don’t even want to celebrate its reopening?”
now that he’s got this idea in his head he can’t get rid of it. He idly wonders what Malfoy’s up to, and then realizes -- he could just ask Malfoy.
He doesn’t want to stay for longer than he has to, and so within the same week, he’s completely moved into his new flat. There’s not much by way of decoration, just what he needs, but Harry hopes that over the years he’ll collect things that mean something to him and the blank walls and empty bookshelves will slowly fill up with beautiful and interesting objects.
“You’re acting like a dog,” he complains, shielding his face with his hand.
He starts. “Malfoy? Since when are Malfoy and Blaise friends?”
“Well, when you put it that way,” Malfoy sneers. “I’m sure announcing to the world that I’m a raging queer would have him rolling over in his grave, but I wanted to add a little something just in case.”
Adam nods. “Hope to see you around, Harry with the cool scar,” he says, pulling him in for one last kiss before releasing him. Blushing, Harry looks around for his friends. He catches a glimpse of Ron and Hermione at the bar, and manages to make his way over.
Malfoy smirks. “
“Me either.” Harry winces. “Is it bad that I don’t remember Blaise from school? Is he in your year?”
Ron shrugs. “No worries, mate. Consider it our housewarming gift to you.” He disappears the last beer bottle and makes his way to the door, Hermione following close behind. “You’re coming to Mum and Dad’s tomorrow, right?”
for a critique of my style?” she says, tossing her towel over the back of a chair and doing up the buttons on her jeans. “They’re amazing. Playing with them is a dream come true, really.” Ginny pauses, contemplative, and tucks in her cream-colored blouse. “I won’t be playing much this season, of course, but even practice with everyone is incredible. I can’t wait for you to come to our first game.”
“It’s in Finsbury Park,” replies Malfoy. “Fucked that they’re charging ten pounds for people to attend. I don’t even know what a pound is.”
“Not funny!” he protests, only half-joking. “That was a very traumatizing experience for me in third year, thank you very much.”
Harry snorts. “Thanks for letting me know at the last possible minute, Gin. You and Blaise still going strong, then?”
“And yet, somehow I don’t believe you.”
“Oh, yes,” replies Malfoy. “Only, I don’t want to go get it right now. You’ll have to live without it.”
“Floo powder’s on the mantle,” answers Malfoy.
They haven’t determined where they’re even racing too but they take off. They’re equally matched and fly beside each other for a while until Harry begins to inch in front of Malfoy. Once he’s several lengths ahead he tucks into a dive, stopping just before he reaches the ground and tumbles off his stick into the grass, laughing breathlessly.
Malfoy makes a face. “It’s not really in a state for visitors.”
“You’re lying.” Malfoy stares at him.
She rolls her eyes, pushing him forward. “Keep going, you great oaf. I know how much you hate talking to people who aren’t part of your immediate friend group, but it’ll be fine.”
Malfoy smirks. “It was kind of funny, though, you have to admit.”
Malfoy snorts. “What a casual thing to drop in the middle of a sentence. But I guess I’ll have to watch it.”
Her head disappears and Harry is left to the crackling of his fireplace and his book. He feels a tinge of guilt at leaving his friends to attend the Hogwarts Reopening without him, but the thought of returning to the castle and seeing everyone who survived the war – and remembering those who didn’t – seems like too big a task for this Saturday evening. He keeps in contact with everyone he wants to see anyway. And he is expecting quite the rundown the next day at the Weasley’s weekly Sunday dinner.
One mid-afternoon in early June he forces himself out of bed, walks down the long dark staircase of Grimmauld Place, through the dark narrow kitchen, into the ugly dark sitting room, and realizes he is sick of it.
She reaches for the pint. “Of course, Harry. I thought it was rather obvious.”
“Want to race?” Harry calls.
Harry rolls his eyes and heads into the kitchen to put on the kettle. When he emerges, Ginny is laying upside-down on the sofa with her legs in the air and hair brushing the carpet.
Ron gasps. “Hermione!”
“Make sure that you do. Oh hey, did you hear about Ginny and Blaise?” he asks, changing the subject.
“Astoria Greengrass,” Ginny confirms. “I’ve only met her once but she’s gorgeous and intimidating as hell. I think they’ve been together for a while.”
“Did I
Blinking, Harry takes a second to respond. “You really just come out and say it, huh?” he says, though he suspects he shouldn’t be one to talk. “Er, I dunno. I didn’t feel like going back to school after everything that happened.”
He looked like a thumb…”
ty for reading & pls excuse my copious comma usage! also i'd like to say fuck jk rowling and her transphobic ass, what a time to be publishing this fic.

“Handed it off to me?” Harry shakes his head. “You can keep it, Arthur, I really have no use for a flying motorcycle. You could use something to keep you busy now that you’re retired, besides.”
Malfoy frowns, mouth moving as he counts the syllables in the last line of his haiku. “Okay, fine. What about ‘We are extremely high’?”
moving, smoking on the roof, overthinking
Ron nods. “Right, well, we’re off then. Cheers, Harry.” They exchange hugs and Harry is left to the silence of his new flat. It’s not quite the same as Grimmauld Place’s dusty atmosphere, and he doesn’t have to deal with the burden of an enormous empty house anymore, but the loneliness is still there. Now it’s accompanied with a new feeling of guilt for not being a better friend. He really shouldn’t have ditched everyone, especially after they put so much work into welcoming him into his new home. His friends were only trying to help – if he hadn’t wanted a party, he probably should have told them. Harry is struck with the overwhelming urge to firecall Ginny and ask her if she hates him. He can imagine how the conversation would go:
In the crowd were all the Weasleys with their respective partners - except for George, Ron and Ginny - Gabrielle Delacour, Hagrid (who occupied three seats), Xenophilius Lovegood, Hannah Abbott, who was sitting next to Neville, Susan Bones,Laura Granger , the surviving components of The Order Of The Phoenix and many more people who must have been family friends of the Grangers and the Weasleys.
"I hope the new one is a beautiful snowflake who hates Nargles." Luna said , crossing her fingers. She still had her lion hat on.
She stared at where Ginny was now floating, then she reached her at ease.
True. If Draco had spent the whole of Christmas Break alone in Hogwarts, he would not have left his bed. He had become somewhat dependent on Harry, he had created a routine with him which included seeing him daily, sleeping in the same bed... as of now, the thought of even a week without him was unbearable, as he was all that he had.
Muggles' memories would have been modified anyway, though, as some of them had actually been jinxed.
"I do hope you're right. Now, about our plot, is it sensible for me to act after you do?" Lucius questioned.
Ron, too, cheered for the team, accompanied by a clapping Hermione.
Then, the Weasley boy tackled Pansy so that she wouldn't be able to escape.
Often times Draco would find himself suffering from his father's frequent outbursts, which included being hit or emotionally abused.
"Just my reaction to your lying." said Harry, his tone cold.
But it didn't mean she never would have felt ready.
"During this past month," Harry continued. "I found myself letting go of that ancient hate I felt for you. I guess it was there because we'd never got to resolve the sexual tension between us..."
But he would miss those moments, too.
"A father always knows."
Oh. Draco formed an 'O' with his mouth at the realization. This was the first time, ever, in which he had called him by name. And it felt kind of weird. But a good kind of it.
Then Draco broke the kiss, licking his way to Harry's neck. "Oh..." Harry whispered. It felt so good, better than anything with Ginny had ever felt. The taller boy hummed as he sucked on his neck, thus making him even more aroused. Draco was now unbuttoning his shirt, so painfully slow, Harry observed. He then removed it and traced his body with his hands, from the neck to the lining of his pants.
"Ok now I'd say that before we cut the cake," Hermione began, giving Luna a look. "I think we should all say something about the Birthday girl here."
"Thanks, Malfoy!" said Ron "Shut him up, already!"
"Well,we will leave you to it." said Hermione, then she grabbed Ron's hand and together they left for Hogwarts.
"Oh no, it's not a girl! It's complicated... It doesn't seem fair to you that I should be with you if I don't love you, right?" Try as he might, he couldn't calm her down.
Draco laughed and wriggled around, all while the others giggled or, in Luna's case, looked at them lovingly.
Once in Hermione's room, the girl cast muffliato so that the noise from the screaming letter wouldn't bother the other inhabitants of the house.
He would try going in the Gryffindor common room, but the password had changed, so there was nothing he could do about it.
She walked into a room.
They were both starting to feel like big brothers to her and she couldn't deny how much they loved each other. Almost as much as she and Luna did.
"The way I see it, they're not worth beating yourself up over. Honestly, your parents are... despicable. And I mean no offence." said Harry. "I mean... throwing you out of their lives because you like men? Not even a Christmas card. Sadly as it sounds, you need to try and learn to let them go." he looked down with sad eyes.
She shook her head at the Lovegoods' naivety.
And now there she was, threatening to end him.
Harry felt a strong sense of jealousy gnawing at his insides when he saw that Draco had just patted the French boy's shoulder playfully.
"This is where you're wrong." came Ginny's voice. She was walking towards the Slytherin girl, followed by Luna and Professor McGonagall.
Additionally, it was strange to see that girl, as, in Ginny's room, a poster of her would often seem to stare at the two girls while they were having intimate moments.
"Don't make me laugh, Hermione." Harry scoffed. How could she proclaim him their 'best friend' after she had spent a whole month giving him the cold shoulder over something so futile.
"Girls." Ron said to his best friend, who gave him a fake smile.
It looked almost exactly as it did for Bill and Fleur's wedding.
Bless bubbly baths.
"GRYFFINDOR WINS!" the commentator yelled.
But Harry wouldn't have been there, he was supposed to spend it with the Weasleys.
Harry detached himself from Ginny and ran to where Pansy was, Draco tried to do the same but they were too late. Pansy had already formulated the spell.
That night, Draco slept in Harry's dorm.
Hermione's parents were still in their seats, looking terrified. This was one of the disadvantages of having a witch for a daughter - strange things would manifest.
Ginny covered her mouth with her hands.
"Well, wow. Then I guess, once again, you should have listened to me." Harry admonished, slapping his shoulder lightly. "She almost broke us up."
He wasn't going to think about them, not for the whole duration of the Easter Break.
"What? Oh, that's marvelous! Grandma of two in only one go!" Molly exclaimed excitedly.
Luna had spent the whole flight with her face on her girlfriend's shoulder, babbling that at their height they could have been attacked by Flying Cramplehorned Snorkacks.
Sometimes, when she and Luna would go study under the big tree, she would turn around, laughing, thinking that she was addressing one of her friends.
Percy always had to be the party crasher, but he didn't argue. He ended up clapping his hands.
Ginny nodded, then she blushed.
Blaise suddenly cast an impedimenta on him. The blond boy hadn't seen it coming as he was kneeling down to where Harry had fallen, trying to wake him up even if he was wandless.
They sat on her bed, all gathered around Draco.
"All water under the bridge, Mr Weasley." Draco said with a smile.
"I don't even know anymore." said Draco.
"Oh, he's going crazy in there." said Harry, walking out of the dorm. "He keeps undressing and putting his suit back on because he says it doesn't look good on him!"
"No, don't go near him. This is Draco's father. He's a dangerous man." Hermione warned, grabbing her father's arm.
"Ah, yeah.. but I don't really mind." he said, lying.
Harry and Draco didn't know about it, either, so she had to keep it from them as well.
"Do it quickly!" Ron shouted at her from the Quidditch pitch.
"Be careful what you say or I will throw you on the ground!" Harry sassily responded.
They were George, Angelina and Arthur. Draco gulped nervously.
Luna loved the effect she had on her girlfriend. Everything about her was beautiful, her hair, her freckles, her bright brown eyes, her lips... but she was also beautiful on the inside. She was fun to be around, she had a good heart and a bright mind... she loved her. She had never told her before, not in the 'girlfriend way'. Now, it was the right time to do so. Without further hesitation, she blurted it out.
"The eggs are spread among the garden. Who finds the most in ten minutes, comes out on top. To catch them, it's necessary to learn this dance. I'm going to need Luna for our demonstration."
Luna was lying on her back with her legs bent, moving them slightly. Ginny sat on Ron's right, she had Luna's head on her lap and would caress her hair from time to time.
"One day." He said, pointing his finger at his reflection in the mirror.
All eyes were on him. Silence was king in the whole of the tent.
"Um... Harry?" Ron awkwardly called to his best friend, thus having them break the kiss. Ginny and Harry broke apart, blushing a little. Ginny was the most embarrassed one, though.
He then kissed her cheek softly and went back to his seat.
When the girl finished speaking, Hermione told her own side of the Hair Salon story.
"Yeah, sure. I'll try not to win too much." Draco teased. "Either way, you will end up with a sore ass, as I'll throw you off your broom."
He wrapped him into a tight hug and cried freely in his arms.
"The best decision we ever made, my love." Harry mused.
As each Weasley made a toast, Harry felt his anxiety grow stronger and stronger.
Draco smiled through his tears, then he took his boyfriend's face in his hands. "I know."He breathed.
Hermione and Ron looked at Draco, perplexed.
"Look, Ginny," said Draco, looking at her. "My dad is a piece of shit. I didn't lose much, really."
"Depends." Ginny teased. then she went back to her own broom.
He snapped out of his thoughts and looked at her. Ron was too busy stuffing his mouth with food to notice them.
Draco's fear was, indeed, what usually pushed him to make the worst decisions. "I'm not afraid, I just don't like you in any way other than physically, you're arrogant-"
"You can take this from here." Ron said to Draco, then both he and Hermione left the room, leaving the estranged lovers to deal with their own issues.
"Babe, I should have listened to you... I was just fooled by my mother's ways... I should have known it was too good to be-" he began, but the boy with the messy hair interrupted him.
"I know, sis. I miss him too." Ron said, sadly. "But he wouldn't want us to be this sad, he would want us to have fun."He put his arm around his sister's shoulders.
Hermione was the first one to come downstairs.
Harry had to be in character, though, so he quickly pretended to protest. "Oh, but I have Quidditch practice!"
"I'll think about it... For now, keep it under your hat. Especially you, Luna." Hermione demanded.
"Given your love for potions," Harry explained, "I thought you'd like this miniature set, so that you could make any potion you like, wherever you go. Courtesy of George there."
"What...?" Both the Malfoy spouses said in unison, Narcissa letting go of her son.
"It's just a lot to take in... You've changed so much since this...happened and I guess I blamed it all on Potter..."
An harmonious and soft music pervaded the whole room as four hearts beat faster than those belonging to anyone else in the vicinity.
"I don't mean to interrupt a moment but... Harry, what are your intentions regarding the Quidditch team?" After all, they were missing a chaser, now.
Ginny nodded, then she grabbed her arm.
This was their first time hanging out all together since Draco's change of heart.
"No, but, I don't understand why he should ask me this when he's just met me." said Draco.
"Is it just me or did she just call her son 'best man'?" Draco asked, amused.
"Calm down? I'm not calming down for shit, you piece of crap! How dare you cheat on me? After all I've done for you! I'll turn you into a beetle and I'll set fire to your body-"
"And now, look at us! Married!" The blond boy said excitedly, accentuating the word 'married'.
"You will see," Narcissa went on, confident. "we will get our son back, this time. He won't have a choice."
"Yeah." Harry said. He was moving his fork idly in his plate, not daring to eat. "That guy's just so stubborn sometimes."
As requested, Luna slowly removed the Gryffindor's panties, smiling as she saw that they were soaked.
"How dare you betray my trust like this? After years of friendship! I used to think a lot of you, I even forgave your photo incident, but this... Is beyond me!" The boy said, furiously. "I can't believe you molested me twice and almost turned me against the boy I love."
Ginny's laugh echoed through the courtyard and Draco could have sworn that was the most annoying sound he had ever heard, even more annoying than Granger's know-it-all interventions in class. "Draco? Will you pay attention to me? I've been calling you for minutes!" Blaise's voice boomed in his ears and that was enough for him to get out of his trance. Blaise was his study buddy for the day, he was a good fella, most of the times, but he had just interrupted his deep thoughts. "What do you want?" He asked, irritated.
Draco looked at their hands. He stroked the other boy's back of his hand and gave him a smile.
It was almost every night. Harry didn't know how to feel about that. Sure, the sex was good, but it was all there was. Just mindless hate sex.
There was a very long line to get to the autograph signing, but the waiting was worth it.
"Oh, Arry, how good to see you!" She said at the sight of her former Triwizard fellow.
"Yeah, that's not what you felt earlier today when you thought I was going in for a kiss, eh?"
He didn't want to interfere with Draco's issues with his dad, but he found it rather hard not to.
On her right side sat her girlfriend and Harry.
"I'm so, so nervous." Draco muttered to his boyfriend as they were walking towards the Great Hall for Breakfast.
"No, you are no father of mine." Draco said, stiffly.
"I don't know..." The blond boy said, looking away.
"You mean, like a surprise for the bride and groom to be?" the woman asked, dipping her quill in the ink.
"Bon appetit!" said Molly ten minutes later, as everyone was now in their seats.
"Harry..." Draco said after he had done eating, "I'm so glad that I got to share this experience with you."
Everyone stopped, waiting for him to say it.
Also, he had woken up at 5 am, making so much noise, much to Draco's annoyance.
"Oh, is that Santa Claus? I didn't remember him to be this hot." she said, fanning herself.
He could add this experience to the list of things that Harry was right about.
"Maybe you deserve someone else, someone who will make efforts for you, someone who would do anything for you..."
"Just focus, ok?" Ginny instructed. "Or I will think that you're failing this class on purpose just to win your ticket to the convention, am I right?"
He extended his arm to get his glasses, which had detached themselves from his face upon impact.
"Lies? What lies?" he asked, acting vaguely.
couldn't she just say no?" He whined, as he was pacing the floor.
Ron stopped walking and gave him a look. He was right, there was no denying in that, but he was right there, in his house, alongside his boyfriend.
Then, she cleaned him up with a napkin, still laughing.
Draco let out a sigh of frustration mixed with a squeal, then he planted a kiss on his lips.
"You're here smiling , but I'm still shaken! That's perfectly normal in France, so he says..." Draco replied.
“What the fuck, Ron?” He heard Potter shout.
They walked side by side, Pansy’s London flat was several blocks away.  The air around them was getting colder, and Draco cast a quick discrete warming charm over them.  When they were comfortable, Pansy began once more, “I just am ready for something new, Draco.  There’s only so much shopping and fashion shows and galas a girl can do.  I’m ready for a change.  I want to do something meaningful.”
“Over
“Figures,” she muttered, scooping out the rest of her pudding.  “This is pretty good, Parkinson.  Mind if I get the recipe?”
“Ugh, please don’t call him that.  He’s not the Muggle Jesus or anything...”
“Ugh, shut up Blaise.”
doing here?” Weasley asked, his sharp gaze focusing on Draco.
He flipped through the paper, finding the Quidditch section and noting the leaderboard with the Holyhead Harpies set to take the top spot.  His eyes scanned the rest of the page, falling on a photo of Ginny Weasley flying through the air and throwing the Quaffle.  The caption read,
?  Hotter than 6th year when I made those goals for Gryffindor?”
,” he whispered, waving his wand over the card.  He was careful to focus his magic solely on the handwriting and not on the cover.  He didn’t want to vanish the snow charm on accident.  Either way, his spell had no effect.  So, it seemed this actually was a card from Harry Potter.  Potter, who not only thought they were friends and Draco deserving of such a gift—but also hinting at possibly going to this place together.  Merlin,
The gym was a horrible idea, Draco soon realized.  How was he supposed to focus on anything else but the sweat accumulating at Harry’s brow and sliding further down his neck?  His face was beautifully flushed, muscles clenching as he performed his pushups, crunches, and various other stretches.  Draco attempted to meet him for each stretch, but after a while he lingered behind.  Harry was just too distracting, and those form fitting joggers hid
The rest of the group congregates around them, first Pansy and Astoria and then Malfoy appears, his blond hair sticking to his forehead and t-shirt clinging to his chest from sweat. He wipes his face with the back of his hand.
“Thanks,” she says, gratefully accepting the mug he hands her.
“Weaselette is quite the pushy one, isn’t she,” comments Malfoy, blowing smoke out of the corner of his mouth. Harry starts to tell him off, but Malfoy beats him to it. “Calm down, Potter, it wasn’t an insult. She’s lovely, but you can’t deny that she likes to get her way.”
“On the contrary. It’s a relief that you’re not obsessed with me anymore.” This time Malfoy’s words have a bit of bite to them, but before Harry can retaliate, Ginny and Blaise reappear. Ginny passes him a pint and then slides into the booth next to him.
“You could always become a poet,” he tells Harry a bit snidely. “Like how the Muggles did, sitting on street corners and reading their poetry to anyone who walks by.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Nodding, he takes a gulp of water, realizing just how dehydrated he is. “I can’t either. It’s horrible.”
As soon as they walk back into the house, Hermione ambushes Harry with a hug.
“Harry?” Luna’s soft voice calls from outside. Sighing in relief, he slowly makes his way across the flat and opens the door. “I’ve brought curry,” she says, holding up a plastic bag. As the smell of Indian food wafts through the hallway, Harry is eternally grateful that he has such amazing people in his life.
“Er, likewise,” he responds. “I’ve heard a lot about you from Ginny, it’s good to finally, um, meet. Malfoy, Parkinson.” Harry nods at Blaise’s companions, who remain seated. Pansy wears a pleasant expression on her face and is sipping delicately on a glass of rose.
“She got the internship, then?” murmurs Malfoy. “She was very concerned about it the last time we spoke.”
“I don’t care,” says Harry. “And can we stop at a sandwich shop on the way? Seriously, I’m so hungry that I feel like I might pass out.”
“Oh, this?” Malfoy gestures to the septum piercing that has somehow appeared in his nose overnight. “Your little party ended a bit early and so after I left I thought to myself, what else could I do that will disappoint my father more than smoking pot with Harry Potter?”
Harry shrugs. “Er, sleeping, probably. Why?”
Harry bristles. “Nothing’s the matter with me,” he says defensively.
“I know it must be hard to not be the center of attention,” Harry replies coolly.
“Thanks,” Harry responds, pleased with the compliment. “Can’t really taste it fully tho. ‘M a bit drunk.”
“Stop overthinking, we’re fine, we barely even dated and anyway we were so young, it’s literally never come up once, you know I love you but not in that way.”
“What’d we miss?” she asks innocently, batting her eyelashes.
Harry looks over at the boy next to him. Malfoy is leaning against the rail, arms resting casually atop his knees. He’s playing with his rings, Harry notices, twisting them around his fingers as he stares off into the night.
“I can’t read the menu right now,” he complains.
As he looks at Malfoy’s pinched face, all the fight drains out of Harry and he sighs. “Look, mate, I didn’t mean to insult you. Crowds just aren’t my thing, and I don’t like talking to strangers.”
“Not even that dirty. Potter, you astound me.” But after casting a careful cleaning charm he takes a seat, to Harry’s delight.
Harry scrubs his eyes with the palms of his hands. “I don’t understand, though. I was fine this morning but then I got home and just felt like everything I did was wrong. And I keep thinking about the war--” he stops.
“What were you and Malfoy up to this whole time?” she asks innocently.
“No!” exclaims Harry. “My aunt was obsessed with the books. When the TV drama came out she made us watch it like ten times. You know, the summer I was attacked by dementors and almost expelled. I’ve basically got the whole thing memorized.”
happy pride, queers! got a bit political in this one huh
It’s a whole ordeal. Seamus and Dean are hosting a party before the parade begins later in the afternoon, so Harry arrives at their little apartment around noon. He hadn’t been quite sure what to wear, and ended up pulling on his favorite jeans and calling Ron to ask to borrow a pink t-shirt (of which he had many, for no reason Harry could discern besides the fact that he liked them).
She sighs, exasperated. “Really, Harry? We’re already here, come on. I knew you’d act like this and that’s why I didn’t tell you earlier, okay? But you’re my best friend and I really want you and Blaise to get along, it would mean a lot to me.”
“I cooked yesterday!” he protests. “
Harry hadn’t given it much thought before, but he does suppose it had suited Malfoy quite well. Before he can reply, he gets distracted by the movie and doesn’t give Malfoy another thought for the rest of the night. The movie ends and Harry says goodbye to Luna, hugging her tightly and thanking her for coming. They make plans to get dinner again soon, inviting Ron, Hermione, and Ginny next time.
“Oh, yes,” remembers Harry. “Do they have hash browns too?”
Malfoy nods and pats him on the arm. “Quite right. Glad we are on the same page about this, Potter,” he says softly. His sunglasses have slipped to the end of his nose and his grey eyes, visible over the rim of his glasses, burn into Harry. “It’s important to know your history.”
After a while, Harry breaks the silence. “You’re really not that bad, you know.” His voice sounds miles away from him, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice.
Harry wants to know what Malfoy really thinks about the trip, with the exception of the reckless driving, but it’s too loud to make conversation and so he instead just appreciates how much fun it is to explore the city on a motorcycle.
She rubs her eyes. “I think I need to break up with Blaise.”
He returns shortly with a glass of water and trades it for the joint. Harry thanks him, feeling much better after a few sips. Eventually the joint burns down to the nub and Malfoy grinds it out and places it in the ashtray before holding the door open for Harry to head back inside.
Harry is suddenly glad he wasn’t at the ball. It’s not that he has anything against any of the Slytherins – he spoke at their trials, in fact – but he doesn’t need their presence in his life right now. Right now, he is with his best friends and family, enjoying Molly’s terrific cooking, and finally celebrating the restorations after the war. Bringing himself back to the moment, Harry pokes Ginny in the side. “Heard you had quite the adventure last night. Care to fill me in?”
She hoists herself up and swivels around to fix him with a piercing look. “This is your fault, Harry.”
Ron cuts her off with a screech. “Gin! I did NOT want to know that.”
“No need to be sarcastic,” Malfoy drawls. “Although I’m surprised you were able to forget so quickly that Granger and I are friendly.”
Harry squints at the object between his fingers. “That’s not a regular cig, is it?”
Despite himself, Harry laughs. “You have a point. Thanks, you both.”
“Are you coming up or what?” Ginny calls out the window, her red hair whipping around her face in the wind. Rolling his eyes, he makes his way back up the stairs to his flat.
“How are Granger and Weasley?” Malfoy asks, playing with the wooden stirrer in his drink. His voice is deeper than Harry remembers, a bit rough, and surprisingly soft.
Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to these rapid mood swings, but tries to take it in good humor. “Just wondering,” he says lightly. “Seeing as I have absolutely nowhere to be.”
“I had no idea,” he says, shaking his head. “I thought your life was perfect.”
They reach Ginny’s flat and she unlocks the door and lets them in. Ron dives for the sofa and so Harry is relegated to the floor, where Ginny throws him a couple blankets. Malfoy joins him on the ground and Harry spreads the blanket over his legs as well, leaning his head back against the couch as Ginny turns on Pride (2014) dir. Matthew Warchus. It’s a fantastic film, but Harry’s exhausted and finds himself nodding off in the middle of it. He thinks he might be leaning on Malfoy’s shoulder, but he’s drifting off into sleep and can’t be sure of anything at the moment.
They ride back through the city at a more reasonable pace, Harry a little more cautious of hydroplaning and skidding out given the river of water that seems to be cascading down the street. The rain beats down on his shoulders and every inch of him is completely soaked to the bone, but it’s a warm summer thunderstorm and the smell of wet pavement is oddly comforting.
the epidemic until 1985 because it primarily affects LGBT people and African-Americans. Clinton isn’t much better, as he hasn’t enacted legislation addressing the fact that almost 50% of HIV cases are people of color.”
“Balcony,” decides Harry. Malfoy’s flat is bad enough, it doesn’t need the smell of weed on top of all the mess.
“Exactly,” says Malfoy vehemently. “Fuck the neoliberal agenda. You can’t fight against injustice without also fighting against capitalism.”
“Potter, we are
Ron leaps to his feet and goes to find Dean and Seamus. Harry thinks Ginny says something, but all he can think about is waffles with cream and strawberries, the perfect meal for his inebriated state. The next few moments are a blur as they finally leave the club and walk down the street in search of a diner that’s still open. Harry’s vision is a bit fuzzy and he thinks he’s telling Pansy how much he loves everyone, but recognizes that he’s not making much sense and she probably thinks he’s an idiot.
Kreacher is happy to help Harry pack up everything he needs to leave. Harry isn’t selling Grimmauld Place, instead he thinks he’ll donate it to the Ministry to use as a safe house for any employees that don’t have a home or need a safe place to stay for a little while. That way, Kreacher can stay (and won’t have to feud with Harry about the housework), and the Black home will be used for something good. Harry thinks Sirius would be proud.
Malfoy stands up, interrupting Harry’s thoughts, and mounts his broom once more. Harry follows him and they fly leisurely around the park for a while longer, taking it easy and enjoying the summer day, until Harry’s stomach begins to grumble and he forces Malfoy to stop.
Hearing her name from across the kitchen, Ginny hollers, “WHAT WAS THAT?” She hands George a serving spoon before making her way to the trio. “You talking about me?”
“And that’s the truth,” Luna agrees. “Not about him being cute, though he is. About how you being in a relationship with a guy doesn’t make you straight.”
Harry shrugs. “Yeah. It’s okay. On the scale of shitty things we’ve done to each other, that’s like the least of it.”
hello! as always, thank you for reading <3 i feel like i did not do this chapter justice but i was tired of writing it so i hope it is satisfying. i also think i really went off with the commas i just do not know how to use them properly...u know what? it happens
“No, it looks fine!” he protests, but drops the subject. “Help yourself,” Harry adds, gesturing to the wine on the table. “I’ll be right back.”
“Harry.” He sticks out his hand and Adam shakes it firmly. It’s a bit ridiculous they’re shaking hands after Adam’s tongue was down Harry’s throat seconds ago, but that’s life. “I’d better get back to my friends,” Harry sighs. They’ve been at this bar for at least an hour and he’s sure Dean and Seamus will have picked out at least two other places to go to.
hello thank u for reading! i wrote this fic mainly so i would start writing again -- and hey, it worked! i had a lot of fun with this, it's rather silly and really i just wrote whatever i felt like writing (and it shows) but regardless i hope you enjoyed. if u feel so inclined u can find me on tumblr @ gnseyiii :-)
“There once was a boy they called Scarhead
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting--
Harry considers this. He knows getting high with Malfoy
“Morning,” Harry greets him.

. I don’t think this quote fully resonated with me back then, or it did, but it was like this unattainable goal at the time.”
“Join us, Harry!” Luna calls over the music, taking his hands in hers. Of course Harry has no choice but to dance with them. He knows all the lyrics to ‘Dancing Queen’, as it should be. Seamus and Dean crowd into the kitchen after him and all five of them jump up and down, screaming the words to one of their favorite songs. It’s exhilarating and Harry can’t stop smiling as he moves his body to the music, simultaneously afraid that the neighbors will call in a noise complaint and not caring less about what they think. Nothing could be more beautiful in this moment: it’s a perfect day and the sun is shining, the windows are open and a summer breeze is wafting through the apartment, and he’s so lucky to be part of a community full of so much love and resilience.
whole compliments? Truly, I’m honored.”
Arthur pats him on the back. “Not at all, dear boy. Will you be able to get it home alright?” he asks anxiously.
Blaise is sitting across from Pansy and Malfoy but climbs out of the booth when he sees them approach. “Harry Potter!” He exclaims, firmly shaking Harry’s hand. “Pleasure.”
“Movie?” he asks.
“So you three keep saying. Now, are you going to tell me, or leave me wondering for the rest of time?”
“No,” Draco responded, his voice firm.  As much as he wanted to be Potter’s friend (and who was he kidding, that was something he
Dean immediately stood up from the table, his eyes never leaving Seamus.  “Draco, sorry mate, we’re going to have to call it a night.”  He waved his wand at their table, scrolls and books flying into a neat pile and zooming into their bedroom across the way.  He closed the distance between them, yanking Seamus up by the shirt collar.  “Let’s go, I can’t wait another second...”
Finally, he reached Draco’s bottom lip, and the combination of the paste on his skin and Potter’s fingers caused Draco to let out a gasp.  Potter instantly removed the fingers on his lips, his eyes widening in alarm.  “Have I hurt you?” he asked, his eyes finally moving up to meet Draco’s.
“Oh,” Draco felt his flush rising past his cheeks and up his neck.  “So, Granger knows?  What um...how did she react?”
“All right,” Harry grinned, clapping his hands.  “Let’s go downstairs.  I have the absolute best movie to show you.”
“In a way,” she said simply, closing the distance between them by wrapping her arms around his waist.  “You just need to let it go.  Stop punishing yourself for what you did while we were kids.  We can’t go back and change the way things happened—but we can go forward.  I’m proud of what you’ve done so far, even knowing you have had little choice.  You’ll make a fine Auror someday.”
“Maybe he was just in shock or something,” she shrugged, finishing off her coffee.  “Has he done anything else since you moved in there?”
“Merlin, we have Gryffindors,” Draco muttered, taking a large gulp out of his own glass.  “What has happened to us?”
“Oh fine, I asked him what he wanted...”
Perhaps, since he was already dressed, he could go visit the gym downstairs and finish what remained of his daily workout.  He typically preferred running outside, avoiding people at all costs.  But he figured it’d be early enough that maybe no one would be there.  And that seemed to be the case, when he pushed open the door and stepped inside.  He let out a breath of relief, pulling one leg up to stretch, followed by the next.  Then he started to run the track surrounding the perimeter of the room.  His mind wonderfully blank for once.
He felt his smile come back full force, and Draco answered, “Sure.  Let’s go.”
“Come with me,” He demanded, hitting that spot that made Draco scream once more.
“Have you told him, Harry?”
Draco had been gripping the sheets on either side tightly, but as Harry stroked him, he grabbed a hold of Harry’s sweaty back, pulling him in even closer.  The movement caused Harry to slide further inside, immediately making both of them moan through their kiss.  “More, Harry,” Draco begged, his fingernails digging in his skin.  “Give it to me.”
Harry mirrored his own smirk with one of his own.  He walked slowly to where Draco was standing, and didn’t stop till his sweaty chest pressed against Draco.  From this proximity Draco could smell his cologne and sweat and his mouth ran dry.  Potter smelled delicious—almost too good.  Draco had to desperately refrain from leaning in and inhaling.  But before he could even attempt such a thing, he turned his head and whispered close to Draco’s ear, “Hit me, Malfoy.”
“Well, it’s certainly a start.  Especially Harry’s big cock,” laughed Dean.  Seamus and him waltzed into the kitchen right at that moment.  Dean had his arm draped over his shoulder, while Seamus was rifling through the cabinet for their own cups.  They joined them at the table.
He turned swiftly around and there stood Potter, several feet away with a shit eating grin.  In his hand was another snowball.
Eventually Weasley came out of the building, squinting to see what they were doing.  Draco couldn’t resist this opportunity, and threw his next snowball right in his face.  Potter laughed hysterically at that, rolling around on the snow.  The girls took that opportunity to gang up on Potter and launch an assault of snow at him, soaking his hair and shirt.  “Ow,” he laughed, wiping his hair and causing it to stick up in an even more wild angle.  “Draco, help me,” he pleaded.
“Right, well,” Draco looked pointedly at Dean.  “I’ll need some alone time with him.  Do you think you can manage to not walk in on us this time around?”
Releasing his hands from Draco’s hips, he reached around to grab Draco’s arse and opened him up even wider.  Groaning from the scent of sex and sweat and Draco, Harry’s tongue formed a tip and tentatively he pushed inside.  Immediately, Draco’s hands buried into Harry’s hair and he tugged hard, urging him forward.  Harry plunged further in, noting just how hot and tight Draco was.  His right hand slipped, fumbling around blindly for the bottle of lube.  It was practically a miracle that he was able to open it and coat his fingers, all the while his tongue stayed buried inside of Draco.
was.  Was it after the war?  After his trial?  Or before?  During the war?  During their time at Hogwarts?  Draco honestly couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment their rivalry faded but perhaps it was something that had grown over time.  Slow, and barely noticeable at first.
“What in Merlin’s beard is all this?”
“I’ve always noticed you,” Draco whispered, saying it so soft that Harry could have easily missed it.  He gulped, clearing his throat and tried to divert his gaze from Harry licking the sugar off his lips.  “Harry...what are we even doing?”
Pansy watched their exchange intently, then smirked.  Moving her eyes from them, she focused on Neville instead.  She pulled away from Draco and she clicked her heels on the marble floor over to him.  He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and she leaned into his embrace.  “Dear, let’s go leave the two love birds, shall we?  There’s a party in the dining hall, and I fancy dancing right now.”
“Oh bugger off, Draco.  These smell too amazing,” then she took a ginger bite into her lemon square and moaned softly.  “Guys, I need your recipe,” she whispered after she’d devoured half of it.
?”  He demanded, his face flaming in frustration.
Malfoy snorted, as he bent down to slip into his Auror boots.  “Bringing him in, what else would I do Potter?  Don’t want him killing any more people.  That’d be bad, don’t you think?”
“Still,” he started as he opened the door to his room.  “I should have asked.  I’ve been so busy with Potter, I’ve forgotten.”
So, it was sort of a shock when she spoke next.  “I’m thinking of getting a job.”
Ginny was laughing at something Neville was describing.  He was waving his hands around and gesturing wildly, and he practically knocked over the drink tray a house elf offered to them.  This then caused Harry to laugh also.  Pansy was done with watching this fiasco unfold, and dragged Draco down the stairs with her.  “Just what on earth is so funny?”
The bartender laughed, pulling out a line of glasses and filling them with the same vodka that was in Draco’s drink.  He winked at them then said, “For you and your friend.  If you’re the only one that drinks them miss, then that’s fine too.”
“Ugh, this feels just like fourth year all over again, except entirely worse because I’m actually going to ask him this time...”  Draco’s eyes widened in shock as soon as the words left his mouth and he paled.  Seamus dropped his cup in shock, thankfully Dean was right there to grab it before it spilled all over.  Draco let out a small manic laugh, cursing himself silently as he felt his whole face burn.
It was as if the fingers digging into Harry’s hair at the base of his neck caused him to go full force.  Harry ran his own hands through Draco’s hair, cupping his cheek softly, caressing his neck, all the while his lips never left Draco’s.  Then his touch grew bolder, as Draco started to get louder and before he knew it, Harry’s hands were working the buttons of his vest.  His hands were clumsy and hurried and Harry huffed in their kiss, breaking away to look down at Draco’s chest.  “Too many buttons...god, Draco...”
Both men laughed hysterically.  Draco flushed, the letters on the mug assaulting him.  In bold, black letters the mug read
in the soapy water
The Wizengamot couldn’t try him as an adult.  He had a brief sentence of house arrest and then was to report to a probation officer.  He was urged to finish his schooling and take his NEWTs, which came as no surprise to him when his results came back all Outstanding.  From his exam scores, he drew the attention of the Aurors and was urged to apply to the program.  Given his record it was a little unorthodox, however they seemed to think Draco possessed useful knowledge of what it was like on the other side.  With nothing left of the manor, no other job prospects (because who would want to hire him?), Draco had very little choice.
“Right,” Harry whispered, the movement of his lips was felt under Draco’s finger that was still resting there.  Draco watched, transfixed as his finger moved along the line of Potter’s bottom lip.  Harry’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed thickly.  “You’re probably right...we should stop.  Before it gets to be too much...”
“Well did Blaise got out with him?!”  He screeched out a second later.  He honestly didn’t think Ronald Weasley even liked blokes, but Blaise did have a track record for convincing the straightest of men.
“Yeah....”  He responded, as if in a trance.  Harry had pulled out the peppermint stick and was nibbling on the tip and Draco had lost all rational thought.
Humming thoughtfully, she walked over to the mini bar in the corner.  Summoning each of them a glass, she began to pour the wine.  “Well honestly, I think you should take him up on the offer.  Ask him out.  Show him just how friendly you could be,” she winked.
“What do you want, DEAN?”  He practically shouted.
“I think it’s sweet,” Dean smiled ruefully.
“Yes, exactly—what?  NO!”  She laughed manically as Draco turned a brilliant shade of red.  He thumped his head against the table.  “Pansy, you’re evil.  Pure evil,” he mumbled into the tablecloth.
“MERLIN!  SHUT UP!”  Pansy gasped, her hands covering her cheeks.  “Are you proposing?!”
He avoided all of them, kept to his room.  Occasionally, yes, he had to run out into the communal living room and kitchen to make a meal now and then.  But he always waited till it seemed quiet, or late at night when everyone else had turned in.
Harry’s blush deepened, his mouth agape.  He stood shock still for what seemed like hours.
“I just wanted to let you know, we agree with Dean and Seamus.  You shouldn’t have to hide in your room any more than the rest of us.”  She paused, her gaze turning thoughtful as she took in his appearance.  Draco was dressed in his typical running gear, his hair not even brushed.  He didn’t bother with putting himself together properly till after his run.  His hair would get frizzy mingled with the sweat and wind from outside.  There was no point to it, really.  But now with Padma looking at him full of concern, perhaps he should have tried at least a little bit.  “I don’t think Parvati or I have even seen you eat anything here.  Are you taking your meals to your room?”
Ron Weasley looked right pissed off.  His face was practically purple, and his nostrils were flared.  But the way Dean looked down on him, eyes burning and fists clenched there was no other option.  Potter pulled him by the sleeve and walked him to their room.  “Ron, it’s ok,” he said, trying to diffuse the situation before they disappeared inside.
blazed sharply along the corner of the store, drawing everyone’s attention.  But not for long, because as if on cue the remaining buildings along the rest of the street lit up with all colors of the rainbow.
“He threw snow in my face, mate!  I can barely fucking see, the bastard!”
was almost too much.  But Harry helped him with gentle hands, guiding him to the bed and settling him amongst the pillows.  Draco was the one watching now, as Harry slowly removed his pajamas.  Draco stopped breathing entirely when Harry’s hard cock sprang free, red and flushed and leaking.  Harry pressed his hand against himself, biting his lower lip.  “You just...look really good.  In my bed...”
Then the pace quickened, and Draco started to pant.  There was no way he could hide what this was doing to him anymore.  At last, he slipped his fingers inside Harry’s mess of hair and tugged tight.  “Fuck,” he exhaled shakily.  His thighs were trembling, and Harry’s fingers were gripping him so hard, they were sure to leave bruises.  He knew if Harry wasn’t holding him down though, there’d be no way Draco would have stayed still.  “I’m going to,” he mumbled, feeling so close already.
An hour later, they had met up and Pansy was leading him through the same path he’d taken earlier that day.  The park was lined with many benches, but this time the snow had melted.  They watched as Muggles slipped around in the slush, and Draco had never been more thankful for the charms on his boots.
“Fuck,” groaned Harry, and he needn’t be told twice.  At last, he pushed the final stretch and was fully sheathed inside Draco.  Underneath him, Draco wailed and arched even further off the bed.  Harry kept his grip tight and hot on Draco’s cock, his other hand helping guide Draco’s legs to his shoulders.  Once Draco was positioned the way Harry wanted him, he slid almost completely out and then thrusted once more.
Harry laughed, pulling Draco back down with him.  Draco allowed himself to be kissed lazily, but then drew back and looked at him curiously.  “Oh fine,” pouted Harry.  “I like Christmas.  I’ve accumulated a lot of decorations since the War, people giving me ornaments and the like.  I couldn’t possibly throw it all away...”
“Are you all right?” he asked, his face leaning in and closer than he really needed to be.  That certainly wasn’t helping Draco breathe any easier right now.
“Yeah, I wouldn’t dream on cutting in on those two again.  Don’t have to worry about us, mate,” he winked at Draco.
“Darling, that’s
Seamus rolled his eyes, twirling a spoon in his tea.  “Obviously.  How many years have we shared a room with him?  And well, given how big he is, it’s hard for him to hide something like that anyway.”
He took a shuddering breath, her words affecting him more than he’d like to admit.  Sipping at his wine, he finally was able to say, “Yeah right.  It’s just something Potter will be better at than me...”
“Harry,” Draco groaned, his voice suddenly a lot closer.  Harry’s eyes flew open and Draco had moved from his spot on the arm chair and was standing in front of him.  He was palming his own erection through his trousers, lips parted, and his grey eyes looked like molten silver from the way he was staring Harry down with such want and intent.  “Please...” He groaned once more, biting his lip as he finally moved his eyes to Harry’s lap.
The smell from the kitchen was heavenly.  Draco’s mouth watered as he waited by the fireplace, the aroma from the oven enticing him.  Dean and Seamus were
Draco coughed behind his mug, neither of them noticing.  Dean’s grin lit up his whole face.  “Oh
Pausing along the sidewalk, Draco turned to his friend and really looked at her.  Pansy was biting on her lips, anxiously looking back at him.  Her browns eyes, always so large and expressive were earnest and waiting.  Even after all these years, after Draco’s fall from grace and his loss of fame and fortune, she still regarded Draco and his opinion over anyone else.  No one else cared what Draco thought these days—no one else paid him much mind at all.  Draco’s breath caught in his chest, suddenly overwhelmed at the idea.  He had no one else, no other friends or family.  Just Pansy.
The two lovers pulled away, they had to sit at their House table for the announcement.
When the four of them left the bar, it was snowing outside and there was a strong wind.
Harry didn't leave the room. He was really, really falling head over heels for this boy. His arch enemy. He wasn't really able to process this without having an internal panic attack.
They did not have the friendliest faces, at all.
"Oh, Luna, it's been a month and I still have no answers..." Ginny gave an exasperated sigh. She was with her best friend, Luna, in the library to study for a project, but she couldn't focus on it as her brain was haunted by the possible reasons for her break up with Harry. Plus it was getting quite late and she started feeling tired.
Harry was visibly nervous.
Draco and Harry froze in their tracks.
"Oh."Harry said, grinning widely. "You are so romantic."
"Can we trade, Ginny?" Harry joked, although there was nothing playful in his voice. He would have given anything just to spend another year in the place he called home.
The next day, they took the Magicobus again to reach the stadium.
Some days later, on Christmas eve, most students were ready to go back home for the Holidays.
"Hardly. Just joking here. You were all great out there." Draco admitted.
"It's just..." Draco took a breath.
"Is that a good thing?" the redhead asked, putting a comforting hand on Hermione's forearm.
Harry felt his cheeks flare up and his hands begin even sweatier that they were already.
"Sure! To my biggest fan Ginevra, I hope you make it big." Gwengo pronounced the words as she wrote them.
The girl covered her mouth with her hands, unable to say a word.
Draco watched as his parents were forced out of the room, thinking that it would probably be the last time he'd see them. He felt as if they had just died, right in front of him.
Draco nodded. "Oh, Harry, I love you." he suddenly breathed.
"Draco..." his dad murmured, grabbing him by his shoulders. "Remember who you are. You can have the glory with us... you can be as rich as you'd ever imagined..."
Arthur nodded in response.
The truth was that she wasn't that bad at flying herself - when in Ginny's backyard, she pretended to be terrible at things just to get her attention.
And Draco knew that he was serious. This was the moment in which he had to choose between his family and his boyfriend. He took a long breath, then he spoke, "Do it, if you dare. You always wanted me to turn into you, but I will tell you... I am NOT willing to do that. I am gay and in love with Harry." As Draco finished talking, he took Harry's hand in his own.
In no time, the girl was already making eights in the sky at a moderate speed.
Not long after, Draco relaxed into his boyfriend's embrace.
Hermione couldn't help feeling guilty for shoving her perfect family life in Draco's face.
On Saturday night Draco didn't sleep in Harry's room.
Upon arriving in their new room, Jean Jacques had fallen asleep just by touching the bed, still dressed.
Harry and Draco cheered, anyway, even though they felt that Ron had been inspired by their engagement.
That weekend Draco was meant to sleep in Harry's dorm. The last few nights with his perverted room mate had been surprisingly calm, but he hadn't dropped the Protection Charm surrounding his bed.
"Oh so you told him." Ron said, looking at Harry, who nodded.
"I saw her in the common room, she says she's too busy for dinner." Hermione explained Ginny's absence. Harry didn't feel sorry at all. He wasn't sad that his girlfriend couldn't see him.
"Well, Malfoy... um... Draco.." Hermione said as she pulled away. "I guess we need to establish a truce." She extended her hand for him to shake.
"Hi, everyone..." the redhead awkwardly waved his hand, then he put it back down, wiping it on his robe. "Hogwarts is where I met my best friends, but also where I met my one true love. Well, I didn't know that when I met her, but, with time, after many fights and tears, we fell in love. Here is also where we conceived a child..."
As soon as she saw her granddaughter, the old lady trotted to her happily. "Ah, my dear! You've gotten so beautiful." she said, wrapping her into a tight hug.
Hermione nodded, holding on to the washbasin for support. "Since I wasn't getting my period, I took about twenty tests, magical and muggle, and they all turned out to be positive."
Ginny and Luna didn't seem to listen, either. They weren't violent with him, they just wouldn't acknowledge his existence.
The end of the difficult exams meant that soon it would be time to leave Hogwarts permanently.
Something inside of her, though, told her to push her away. She wasn't a lesbian, she had dated so many guys and that should have confirmed her heterosexuality.
"I know it's not been too long, but I'm in love with him, you know? I feel as close to him as can be, now, and I want to take advantage of this." He replied.
"Oh, he's become such a pest. He's uncontrollable, I swear I almost tripped on him once." The brunette whined.
All of his friends looked at each other, then Hermione spoke. "Well, he's got a point. I mean, he's always hanging around us, isn't he? While you don't even try with his people."
Pansy raised her eyebrow. What if that gingerbread girl was referring to Draco? "Wait, what do I need to see?"
So, he thought he would ask a professor to let him leave the school for a day for his mission.
His house mates didn't consider him much, only a few of them clapped their hands lazily.
Chapter Warning: BoyxBoy, NSFW
"Ginevra Weasley now in possession of the Quaffle- that was close! Good skills, girl!" Adrastea Sivan said, whistling. Ginny had just dodged a Bludger.
Harry sighed. He had to fight the urge to fling his arms around the other boy. He had just spent a good amount of time crying over him, but now, he looked so beautiful and pure...
With shaking hands, he took the letter out of the animal's beak.
One day, she would have definitely done that. But, at that moment she felt too young for that big step.
"Oh, I didn't think..." Ginny said. She was very ashamed of herself, more than she had been the day before.
"Do it again and I'll hex you." his girlfriend warned.
This Foreign Exchange guy, who was sitting next to me, had struck up a conversation. As we spoke, I was hit by his looks. He was dashingly attractive, he was European... he could have looked French and from Beauxbatons, his looks were possibly a match for Draco's liking... so, acting like I had dropped something, I took some of his hair from the floor and brought it here. This is when I made the potion. I didn't know when to act or how to do that, since I had to trick the teachers into believing that this guy was transferring from another school.
Ginny smiled widely. "I'm the lucky one here." she said.
"Get gone, Luna! This is mine!" Ginny said, all while laughing.
Harry was ready to fight her, but Draco stopped him. If Harry wasn't in anyway inclined to forgive her and Ginny, Draco didn't have the same idea. He wanted to hear what she had to say.
"No, Ron, don't touch that!" Hermione shouted back, fearing that Ron was talking about the toilet brush. She rushed upstairs to stop her boyfriend from doing regrettable things. While on the stairs, she met Harry and Draco, who were already dressed.
But Draco still loved him. He was a hero to him.
"Know that I am perfectly fine with this." Neville said, looking at the two of them.
It had been Harry's one true home.
Draco broke the embrace to give Hermione a single hug, since he had been between Harry and Ron.
"Oh, Thank you." Draco said as he shook her hand.
Mr and Mrs Weasly hadn't been informed about the true reason behind their son's engagement to Hermione, so they just thought that it was Ron's way to settle down and take things seriously.
"I think it's best if we open it at home." Hermione suggested.
"He's right." Draco said. "This was a mistake. I shouldn't have..." that said, he rushed off upstairs.
"You should not be holding hands!" He said, furious.
They ran out the classroom as fast as they could, although they were terrified that in that period of time Ginny and Pansy had already leaked the photo throughout the whole school.
He was starting to take his life back in his hands and he couldn't be more excited for him.
Luna didn't worry about making sounds, as she had already soundproofed Ginny's bedroom, in hope that they'd be having sex there.
Draco wondered what might have happened between the happy couple, and he couldn't help smiling at that. Ah, finally they were crashing. This meant that his chances of seducing Potter were becoming more and more.
"Ron, do you still have the veritaserum? I guess little miss double face here has some explaining to do." he simply said, seeing something in the distance.
How could he be so damn pestering? It was too late for him to be awake, anyway, since he had to wake up at 5 or so, as he had been doing those past days.
Ron, however, had got it worse than anyone else.
"Happy fourth month-and-a-half-a-versary, Lu. Hoping this will the fourth of many." Ginny said, smiling fondly.
"So, I've known these two since we were all midgets and I couldn't stand Draco, it was no secret..." she continued.
"No, there's no need, for now..." said Draco, chuckling nervously.
"We won!" He yelled, then he hugged his fiancè excitedly.
"I like it when you hold my hands like this. Also, your body is so close to mine and I love it." Luna purred.
"So, you two are a thing?" Neville asked when Harry and Draco sat in front of him. He wasn't afraid of the latter anymore, it seemed.
"Oh, Ron..." Ginny suddenly turned sad. "This will be our first Christmas without Fred."
Harry wanted to look perfect for the occasion of the day, so he also proceeded to pluck his eyebrows.
Was she really going against her own husband for her son's 'tantrum'?
"I mean, I never saw him look at you the way he did him."
"Hey, I'm not that ugly," said Ron in defence. It was useless though, as Harry had already left, clearly to avoid his reaction.
"Um, too much PDA, this is a good Christian household guys!" laughed Harry.
"Wow," Harry said. "Wow." He looked up at Draco. "You know, I always had a crush on you at school. Maybe it was your inbred, perfect features, but you were always the hottest person at school."
"Oi, Harry," Ron said while staring in the mirror. "Do you think these robes look good? Actually, never mind, you have as much fashion sense as a frog. I'll buy them then ask 'Mione."
"Fuck, dude, you really wanna know?"
"So did I, but it's Hogwarts," answered Draco.
Harry Potter sat in his bed, his only company being the soft snores of the Dursley's as they slept. The storm outside raged on, as did the one in his head; he fingered the razor, all thoughts of common sense leaving his mind.
Harry stood there, crying in front the mirror, and silently got out his blade. He quickly cast an advanced locking charm, one that a simple alohorma wouldn't unlock. He brought the blade down to his skin, not one ounce of regret in his eyes. It was different from last session though, this time he had emotions. He could feel, and he didn't want to. He wanted it to be like last him; painful and emotionless, but he was weak. Weak. He wasn't supposed to feel. He pressed harder, desperate for his relief. He slowly made one cut, then two, then five, six, and seven and he kept going, he kept going until blood was pouring out. He deserved it though, he deserved it for being such a fuck-up.
"Merlin, what happened?" asked Ron, voiced laced with concern.
"Yes, she is, Harry," Draco contributed, a hint of a smile on his face.
"Bloody hell Harry, don't just open the door, what if I'd been changing or something?" Ron said, the harsh words meaningless due to the amount of humor detected in them.
Harry felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around, and, seeing Hermione, let a look of annoyance arrive on his face.
"See ya, 'Mione," came Ron, before giving her a kiss.
"So," Ron said. "Eighth year, huh. I wonder how this is gonna go."
"Yes, 'Mione? And, yeah, I know what this is about, so please, just say it, and get it over with."
"Well, nice to see you still have the same pompous attitude," laughed Harry.
"Maybe that would be better," Harry mused, evident that this was not an uncommon thought. "Maybe I want to die, Draco. Ever thought about that?
"What about you, huh? What are you hiding."
"Yeah, man," Harry murmured in agreement.
The dinner was boring, with the sorting being the only source of entertainment. But maybe that was just Harry's opinion. Just before they were about to head off, the Headmistress stood up, indicating an important announcement.
"Harry, what the fuck was that? You were in there fucking cutting your body to shreds. You think that I'm just going to ignore that?" Draco cried out.
He knew that what he was doing was wrong; but he couldn't seem to stop. He didn't want to stop. it was a self inflicted punishment, he was the judge, jury, and executioner.
"Now, as most of you know, with the returning of the eighth years, Hogwarts WILL be crowded. So, we have decided to room you in the Room of Requirement. Boys will room with boys, and girls with girls. Houses will not be present for you, so many of you will share with someone from a different house, such as Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, or Slytherin and Ravenclaw." She cocked her head, as if daring someone to disagree. "I assume that will be of no trouble? Good. You may leave."
Harry and Draco stared at Ron walking away, before allowing an awkward silence to befall them. The cautiously entered, as if they were afraid to make a noise.
Harry opened his mouth, and closed it, for words were not enough. Instead, he just lifted his sleeve, showing the abundance of scars littering his wrists. The shock on Hermione's face was evident; she knew that he had been doing something, but to see it like this made it all too real. She didn't want to believe it, how could she have been so oblivious to the amount of pain her best friend had been going through.
"i thought you were trying to stay away from handouts...?" George said, hint of a smirk present.
The trio nodded their heads in unison, as this was the first time they had heard Malfoy say please. Hermione and Harry shared a look, as they both had the same confusion. What was wrong with Malfoy?
"Some people never change," muttered Draco, with the intention of falling asleep.
The walk continued in silence, before finally reaching the door. Upon entering, they noticed a sign for the girls dorms and boys.
He passed out, dried blood coating his arm as a painful reminder of what he really is.
Harry was gently snoring in his bed at the Burrow, blissfully unaware of his friend Ron sneaking a glance at him from across the room. Usually Ron wouldn't be one to stare, but this was different. Harry was different. He had come home strange, distant, and Ron didn't know why. What had changed?
Harry laughed. "Alright, now you guys are ganging up on me. C'mon, let's go find our roommates," he said, heading off towards fourth floor.
"You did?"
"Really?" Draco questioned. "I mean, I liked you since we met at the shop."
"No, man, not at all. I'm gay too, and I know how you feel."
Harry woke with a start, with sunlight streaming into his windows. He looked over and saw Ron still asleep, and started to get up. Harry quickly snuck out of his room towards the stairs, heading towards the kitchen, where, by the smell of things, breakfast was waiting. Harry's stomach rumbled, and he was reminded yet again of just how hungry he gets overnight.
He laughed and cut once, twice, three times, until the steady flow of blood was threatening to increase. It wasn't enough, though. He needed more. More pain, more blood. he wanted to feel something. Anything. The war had left him broken; an empty shell of what he once was.
The rest of the trip was peaceful for some; Ron and Draco were asleep, and Hermione was absorbed in a book.
Ron didn't answer, and instead chose to abruptly buy the robes and head out. Harry laughed and shook his head, amused with Ron. He turned his head and noticed someone coming in the shop. Someone hot, as seen from their body, and clothes, and... 'Shit,' Harry thought in disbelief. 'It's Malfoy. And he's fucking hotter than ever, too."
"I'll be back," Harry whispered. "I just need to go to the bathroom."
I'm regretting this more and more.
"Those are thestrals, Ron, calm down," Hermione replied. "And the reason you can see them NOW is because you've seen death. Calm DOWN, Ron, and let me finish. They were always here, they're not dangerous, and you can see them because of the war. Now stop staring, and let's go."
"Why?"
"Sure," replied Hermione, her eyes never even leaving her book. She should've seen Harry's face, though, or she never would've let him leave.
Several moments later, he caught up with his friends, and began heading towards the station. Upon arriving, he noticed there were quite a lot of eighth years; Neville, Susan, Ernie, Pansy, Blaise, Seamus, Dean, Ginny, Luna, and themselves. And those were only the ones he recognised. Harry climbed aboard the train and went towards his normal carriage, leaving Ron and Hermione to follow.
Too late, though, as the train had already made its way to Hogwarts.
"Well, basically."
Their tongues brushed once, twice, before opening both their mouths. "Fuck," said Draco, moving his hands up to Harry's hair. He tugged gently, allowing a small moan to escape Harry's mouth. Harry bit Draco's lip in response, and put his hands on the bottom of Draco's shirt.
"I'll.. I'll try, Harry," she said, and with a small nod, left, already thinking of remedies and healing potions.
"Honestly, I don't know how I could handle it, with all the memories that would come flooding back to me," he exclaimed. "And it's not like I NEED my NEWTS, as Kingsley has already offered me a spot as an Auror."
"We have to share?" said Harry and Draco in amusement.
"Hah! Later guys, I'm going to hangout with MY roommate, Neville."
"Hey, I thought the Room of Requirement burnt down last year?" asked Ron.
"Well, knowing us, I'd say it'll end up being quite eventful," Hermione said with a laugh.
"That I'd be homophobic? No. It made me more gay, honestly."
"Excuse me, Miss, I, uh, I need s-some robes?" Malfoy stuttered, and Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, the one who had a massive superiority complex all throughout Hogwarts, had a stutter? Harry pushed all those thoughts aside, cast a tempus charm, and realised he had to meet up with Ron and Hermione. He could think about Malfoy later.
"So, what?' said Harry nervously. "Got a problem?"
"So, Malfoy," Hermione started.
"Trust you..?" repeated Harry, confused. "What exactly do you mean by that?"
"That woman is scary," exclaimed Ron.
"Look, can we forget about what happened earlier? I just- I'm trying to find ways to stop, and I can't deal with more stress, okay? Please, man."
"Yeah."
"Whatever, man. If it means so much to you, I'll go." He said with a smile. This action had an immediate effect, with Arthur and Molly hiding a gasp, and most of the Weasley kids (with the exception of Ron) dropping their forks. Harry continued eating, oblivious to the disturbance he caused.
Harry wasn't exactly convinced with her behaviour. Narcissa Malfoy going to a semi-muggle wedding? Making this effort for Draco?
Watching their friends confirm, once again, their undying love for each other made her think of her relationship with that blonde girl. She had jumped, head first, into that new thing that she had been afraid of for so long. That had been the best thing she had ever done.
"Oh, no, we don't do that." the redhead replied.
"Drink up." Hermione instructed, as she sat him on a chair. She didn't have to tell him twice.
When Ron tried the Whiskey, he grimaced. It burned his throat and it tasted too strong - stronger then the Wizard version.
"Um... Draco." He said, staring at the guy opposite him.
"What now, Malfoy?" Harry said in an annoyed voice. Damn him. Couldn't he just leave him alone for once? What did he want from him now?
One time, he even flirted with Ron, enraging Hermione.
"But, somehow, we ended up together and I'm sure, now, that we are each other's soulmate. Mione, I promise you that I will love you for ever." Ron finished with a throaty sob.
He tried fire communication, but he never found Harry by the fireplace, it was always someone else or it was empty.
The best decision Draco had made was agreeing to becoming Harry's boyfriend, that had sucked him into a world full of emotion like he had never felt before.
Their eyes were locked, their breaths uneven, as the feeling of excitement towards exploring new territories pervaded them.
While dancing with him, he had kept his head rested on his chest.
"I don't want to listen to-" Harry said, but he was interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from his boyfriend. "ow!"
"He wants to steal my man, can't you see? Hell with 'innocent dick cuddling' in fucking Beauxbatons, he was trying to seduce him. " Harry spat.
He needed to break things, it would numb his brain momentarily. Then , his eyes caught a moving picture of him and Draco ice skating. He took the photo in his hand and threw it to the ground, shattering the glass.
"Pff, Mione, you should have seen Ron when you left for New Year's Eve, he wouldn't shut up about how much he missed you! 'Where is Mione Poo, I need my Mione Poo.'" Ginny said, mockingly, coming to Harry's rescue.
They didn't know how long their kiss had lasted, but, as they broke it, they were both out of breath and gasping for air. "I guess this is what you wanted to tell me about." Draco smirked. Harry glared at him before grabbing his shirt and pushing him in a second, more passionate kiss. And in that moment, Draco's brain refused to work.
They both got Omnioculars.
"That's awesome!" he said, "Thank you, it means a lot."
The Gryffindor held him close."Shh," he cooed. "It's for the best."
Luna and Ginny, however, had decided to spend their day differently.
"Oh, shut up!" Draco said, slapping his face lightly.
"Pansy?" Harry said, in shock.
"Yeah, good idea. She's not that happy with you... she confessed that she didn't feel wanted by you lately... or ever. She said she doesn't feel like you are attracted to her."
"Get out of my face, Potter!" Draco spat. "Your messy hair is blocking my view."
"You can't stop me, Harry!" the girl said. She was in no way seeing that she was about to make a very big mistake.
She had just given birth to her first son.
Harry felt gut wrenching guilt as he looked at the girl walking happily towards him. He was about to rip her heart in a million little pieces... He would have watched her fall apart, helplessly. But this had to be done. He needed to man up and face this. He was a Gryffindor, after all, and Gryffindors didn't know fear.
"You're joking, right? I risked falling on this stupid ice, I look like a freaking monkey with this walk and I'm afraid we'll drown into the freezing waters of the lake!" Draco whined, this only made Harry laugh more. "What's so funny about this?" The blond boy asked in a semi-infuriated tone.
Turns out, Arthur had gone to fetch George and Angelina in Diagon Alley, but they were stuck inside Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, due to the snow.
Luna stopped torturing her neck to give her a lust-filled look. Her pearly eyes were almost fully black with desire.
That night had been quite weird for Draco.
That Easter Sunday of 1999, when Lucius descended from a chimney, Draco was at loss for words.
"I knew I'd find you here." Came Harry's voice. He watched as his boyfriend undressed and went into the water with him.
He had the impression that it would fall apart any minute, as the floor creaked after he stepped foot on it, but it surely felt warmer than his enormous Manor.
"I will take the veritaserum. I will do it in front of you." he finally yelled.
"Oh Merlin, what if I am pregnant, too? I haven't had my period in a while." The Ravenclaw voiced her concerns.
He felt their bodies and souls intertwine completely as they became one thing only.
"Fine," the redhead expressed, "but this is your last chance."
